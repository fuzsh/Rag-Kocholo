However, if you would prefer to receive paper copies of our proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability.\n\nWhether or not you attend the Annual Meeting, it is important that your shares be represented and voted at the Annual Meeting. Therefore, we urge you to promptly vote and submit your proxy via the internet, by telephone, or by mail, in accordance with the instructions included in the Proxy Statement.\n\nOn behalf of the board of directors, we would like to thank you for your continued interest and investment in Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJames G. Conroy\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis proxy statement contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this proxy statement are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the âSecurities Actâ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Actâ). Forward-looking statements refer to our current expectations and projections relating to, by way of example and without limitation, our plans, objectives, strategies, future performance, business and industry. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as âanticipateâ, âestimateâ, âexpectâ, âprojectâ, âplanâ, âintendâ, âbelieveâ, âmayâ, âmightâ, âwillâ, âcouldâ, âshouldâ, âcan haveâ, âlikelyâ and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events, but not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. For these reasons, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors â âSummary of Risk Factorsâ of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024 and our subsequent filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ). Furthermore, the forward-looking statements included in this proxy statement are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nPROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY\n\n1\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\n2\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n6\n\nOur Board\n\n6\n\nBoard Structure and Director Independence\n\n10\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\n10\n\nThe Boardâs Role in Risk Oversight\n\n11\n\nCompensation Risk Management and Other Policies\n\n11\n\nBoard Participation\n\n12\n\nBoard Committees\n\n12\n\nIdentifying and Evaluating Director Candidates\n\n14\n\nBoard Diversity\n\n14\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters\n\n15\n\nAvailability of Corporate Governance Information\n\n16\n\nCommunications with our Board of Directors\n\n17\n\nPROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\n17\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\n18\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\n19\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\n\n20\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n20\n\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n21\n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\n31\n\nCEO PAY RATIO\n\n44\n\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE\n\n44\n\nPROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (âSAY-ON-PAYâ)\n\n50\n\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\n51\n\nPROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n52\n\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\n\n52\n\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\n54\n\nDEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\n56\n\nOTHER MATTERS\n\n57\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBOOT BARN HOLDINGS, INC.\n\n15345 Barranca Pkwy.\n\nIrvine, California 92618\n\n2024 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\nThis Proxy Statement and the enclosed form of proxy are solicited on behalf of Boot Barn Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as our âCompanyâ), by our board of directors for use at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (referred to as the âAnnual Meetingâ), and any adjournments, continuations or postponements thereof. The Annual Meeting will be an in-person only meeting held at Boot Barn Holdings, Inc., 15345 Barranca Pkwy., Irvine, California 92618, on Wednesday, August 28, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. local time.\n\nInternet Availability of Proxy Materials\n\nIn accordance with rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (referred to as the âSECâ) that allow companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet, we are mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of our proxy statement and our 2024 Annual Report to most of our stockholders. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains instructions on how to access those documents and vote over the Internet. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials, including our proxy statement, our 2024 Annual Report, and a form of proxy card. We believe that this process will allow us to provide our stockholders the information they need in a more timely manner, while reducing the environmental impact and lowering our costs of printing and delivering the proxy materials.\n\nThese proxy solicitation materials are being first released on or about July 18, 2024 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.\n\nRecord Date\n\nStockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2024 , which we have set as the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting.\n\nNumber of Outstanding Shares\n\nOn the record date, there were 30,502,351 outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share.\n\nRequirements for a Quorum\n\nThe holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Each stockholder voting at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, may cast one vote per share of common stock held on all matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting.\n\nVotes Required for Each Proposal\n\nAssuming that a quorum is present, the vote required for each proposal is as follows.\n\nDirectors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Therefore, the eight nominees who receive the greatest number of affirmative votes cast shall be elected as directors. We do not have cumulative voting rights for the election of directors.\n\nThe advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal 2024 (commonly referred to as a âsay-on-payâ proposal) and the proposal to ratify Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of our Company for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2025 each require the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon.\n\nAlthough the say-on-pay proposal is non-binding, it will provide information to our compensation committee and our board of directors regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies, and practices, which our compensation committee and our board of directors will consider when determining executive compensation for the years to come.\n\nThe vote on each matter submitted to stockholders is tabulated separately. Computershare Trust Company, N.A., or a representative thereof, will tabulate the votes.\n\nOur Boardâs Recommendation for Each Proposal\n\nOur board of directors recommends that you vote your shares:\n\nââFORâ each director nominee;\n\nâ\n\nââFORâ the âsay-on-payâ proposal; and\n\nâ\n\nââFORâ the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of our Company for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2025 .\n\nâ\n\nVoting Instructions\n\nYou may vote your shares by proxy by doing any one of the following: vote via the Internet at www.envisionreports.com/BOOT; call 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) to vote by telephone; or if you have requested the proxy materials by mail, sign, date and return your proxy or voting instruction card in the prepaid enclosed envelope to vote by mail. When a proxy is properly executed and returned, the shares it represents will be voted at the Annual Meeting as directed.\n\nIf a proxy card is properly executed and returned and no voting specification is indicated, the shares will be voted (1) âFORâ the election of each of the eight nominees for director set forth in this proxy statement, (2) âFORâ the âsay-on-payâ proposal, (3) âFORâ the proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of our Company for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2025 , and (4) as the persons specified in the proxy deem advisable in their discretion on such other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have received no notice of any such other matters.\n\nIf you attend the Annual Meeting, you may vote in person even if you have previously voted via the Internet or by phone or returned a proxy or voting instruction card by mail, and your in-person vote will supersede any vote previously cast.\n\nBroker Non-Votes and Abstentions\n\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares held in âstreet nameâ and do not provide the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is commonly referred to as a âbroker non-vote.â\n\nThe election of directors (âProposal 1â) and the say-on-pay proposal (âProposal 2â) are matters considered non-routine under applicable rules. Therefore, a broker, bank, or other nominee cannot vote without your instructions on Proposals 1 or 2; as a result, there may be broker non-votes on Proposals 1 or 2. For your vote to be counted on Proposals 1 or 2, you will need to communicate your voting decisions to your broker, bank, or other nominee by the deadline specified in the voting instruction form using the voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank, or other nominee.\n\nThe ratification of appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending March 29, 2025 (âProposal 3â) is a matter considered routine under applicable rules. A broker, bank, or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected in connection with Proposal 3.\n\nBroker non-votes and abstentions each are counted for determining the presence of a quorum. The election of directors requires a plurality of votes cast. Neither broker non-votes nor any withhold votes in the election of directors will have any effect thereon. With respect to Proposals 2 and 3, abstentions will have the same effect as votes âagainstâ such proposal because they represent shares present and entitled to vote that are not voted in favor of such proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on Proposal 2 because they do not represent shares entitled to vote on such proposal. Broker non-votes are not applicable to Proposal 3, because Proposal 3 is a routine matter, as described above.\n\nRevoking Proxies\n\nAny stockholder giving a proxy may revoke the proxy at any time before its use by furnishing to us either a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy (via internet, telephone or mail) bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request.\n\nElection Inspector\n\nWe have engaged Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to be the election inspector. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by such election inspector, who will determine whether a quorum is present. The election inspector will treat broker non-votes and abstentions as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, and as described in the âBroker Non-Votes and Abstentionsâ section of this proxy statement for purposes of determining the approval of any matter submitted to stockholders for a vote.\n\nVoting Results\n\nThe final voting results from the Annual Meeting will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days of the Annual Meeting.\n\nCosts of Solicitation of Proxies\n\nWe will bear the cost of this proxy solicitation. In addition, we may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for expenses incurred in forwarding proxy solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies also may be solicited by certain of our directors and officers, personally or by telephone, text message or e-mail, without additional compensation. We do not expect to engage or pay any compensation to a third-party proxy solicitor.\n\nHouseholding\n\nWe have adopted a procedure called âhouseholdingâ, which has been approved by the SEC. Under this procedure, certain stockholders of record who have the same address and last name, and who do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials, will receive only one copy of our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, and as applicable, any additional proxy materials that are delivered. A separate proxy card for each stockholder of record will be included in the printed materials. This procedure reduces our printing costs, mailing costs and fees. Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Notice or, if applicable, the printed proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of any of those documents was delivered. (1) If you received a single copy of the 2024 Notice or, if applicable, the printed 2024 proxy materials, at a shared address and wish to receive a separate copy of the 2024 Notice or Annual Report or, if applicable, the printed 2024 proxy materials, (2) if you wish to receive separate copies of the Notice or proxy materials in the future, or (3) if you are currently receiving multiple copies of the Notice and proxy materials at a shared address and wish to participate in householding in the future, please notify us by\n\noral request at 949-453-4400 or by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at 15345 Barranca Pkwy., Irvine, California 92618. Street name stockholders may contact their broker, bank or other nominee to request information about householding.\n\nAvailability of our Filings with the SEC and Additional Information\n\nThrough our investor relations website, http://investor.bootbarn.com, we make available free of charge all of our SEC filings, including our proxy statements, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5 reports of our directors, officers, and principal stockholders, together with amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a), 15(d), or 16 of the Exchange Act. We will also provide upon written request, without charge to each stockholder of record as of the record date, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC. Any exhibits listed in the Form 10-K report also will be furnished upon request at the actual expense we incur in furnishing such exhibits. Any such requests should be directed to our Corporate Secretary at our executive offices set forth in this proxy statement. The inclusion of our website address in this proxy statement does not include or incorporate by reference the information on or accessible through our website into this proxy statement.\n\nAll of our SEC filings can also be accessed through the SECâs website, http://www.sec.gov.\n\nThe common stock of our Company is listed on the NYSE, and reports and other information on our Company can be reviewed at the office of the NYSE at 11 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005.\n\nInformation Deemed Not Filed\n\nOur 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, which was made available to stockholders with or preceding this proxy statement, contains financial and other information about our Company, but is not incorporated into this proxy statement and is not to be considered a part of these proxy materials or subject to Regulations 14A or 14C or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act. The information contained in the âCompensation Committee Reportâ and âReport of the Audit Committeeâ shall not be deemed âfiledâ with the SEC or subject to Regulations 14A or 14C or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act.\n\nIn addition, this document includes several website addresses. These website addresses are intended to provide inactive, textual references only. The information on these websites is not part of this proxy statement.\n\nOther Information\n\nWe report our results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in March, unless April 1 is a Saturday, in which case the fiscal year ends April 1. In a 52-week fiscal year, each quarter includes thirteen weeks of operations; in a 53-week fiscal year, the first, second and third quarters each include thirteen weeks of operations and the fourth quarter includes fourteen weeks of operations. Our fiscal years ended on March 30, 2024 and March 26, 2022 were both 52-week periods. Our fiscal year ended on April 1, 2023 was a 53-week year. We refer to our fiscal years ended March 26, 2022, April 1, 2023 and March 30, 2024 as âfiscal 2022â, âfiscal 2023â and âfiscal 2024â, respectively.\n\nAs used in this proxy statement, unless the context otherwise requires, references to the âCompanyâ, âBoot Barnâ, âweâ, âusâ and âourâ refer to Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.\n\nBoard Structure and Director Independence\n\nCurrently our board of directors consists of eight directors. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that our board of directors will consist of the number of directors that our board of directors may determine from time to time, up to a maximum of nine directors. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Starrett, Mr. Bruzzo, Mr. Burt, Ms. Laube, Ms. MacDonald, Ms. Morris and Mr. Weston are currently independent for the purpose of serving on our board of directors under the independence standards promulgated by the NYSE. As Mr. Conroy is our Chief Executive Officer, he is not considered independent under the NYSE listing standards.\n\nIn reaching this determination of independence, our board considered, among other things, the following facts and circumstances with respect to Peter Starrett and Brad Weston.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Starrett, the board considered that Mr. Starrett served as our interim Chief Executive Officer from May to November of 2012, prior to our initial public offering. Under NYSE rules, a director who serves as chief executive officer in an interim capacity is not disqualified from being considered independent following such service, and in any event, any person who formerly served as a companyâs chief executive officer, even on a non-interim basis, is not disqualified from being considered independent three years after having ceased to serve in such capacity. Our board of directors concluded that Mr. Starrettâs service as interim chief executive officer over ten years ago has had no adverse impact on his independence. However, certain proxy advisory firms and institutional shareholders have considered Mr. Starrett non-independent as a result of his interim role in 2012.\n\nMr. Weston served as the Chief Executive Officer and as a director of Party City until November 3, 2023, and James G. Conroy, our Chief Executive Officer, served as a director of Party City until October 12, 2023 (the âParty City Director Interlockâ). Consistent with the boardâs historic practice, in connection with the boardâs annual independence determination for fiscal 2024, the board considered the Party City Director Interlock, and concluded that Mr. Conroyâs service on the Party City board of directors and Mr. Westonâs service on our board of directors has not and does not adversely impact Mr. Westonâs independence as a Boot Barn director.\n\nAdditionally, during his tenure as a director of Party City, Mr. Conroy was not a member of Party Cityâs Compensation Committee, and Mr. Weston is not a member of our Compensation Committee. Accordingly, there is no disclosable âCompensation Committee Interlocksâ under SEC rules for fiscal 2024. While the board of directors determined that the Party City Director Interlock neither impacted Mr. Westonâs independence nor his qualifications to serve on our board, the Company believes that certain proxy advisory firms and institutional stockholders may have previously considered the Party City Director Interlock in providing a vote recommendation and/or voting on whether Mr. Weston should be elected to our board in prior director elections. In recommending that the Companyâs stockholders vote âFORâ the re-election of Mr. Weston to our board, the board notes that the Party City Director Interlock relationship has terminated, as neither Mr. Weston nor Mr. Conroy are currently affiliated with Party City. Accordingly, the board of directors believes that Mr. Weston is a valued resource for our board, and recommends a vote âFORâ his election to the board, along with each of the other named director nominees.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nOur board of directors has no policy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. It is the view of the board of directors that rather than having a rigid policy, the board of directors, with the advice and assistance of the nominating and corporate governance committee, and upon consideration of all relevant factors and circumstances, will determine, as and when appropriate, whether to institute a formal policy. Currently, our leadership structure separates these roles, with Mr. Starrett serving as our Chairman of the Board and Mr. Conroy serving as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our board of directors believes that separating these roles provides the appropriate balance between strategy development, flow of information between management and the board of directors, and oversight of management. By segregating the roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, we reduce any duplication of effort between the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board. We believe that this provides guidance for our board of directors, while also positioning our Chief Executive Officer as the leader of our Company in the eyes of our customers, employees and other stakeholders. As Chairman of the Board, Mr. Starrett, among other responsibilities, presides over regularly scheduled meetings of the board of directors, serves as a liaison between the directors, and performs such additional duties as our board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate. By having Mr. Starrett serve as Chairman of the Board, Mr. Conroy is better able to focus his attention on running our Company.\n\nThe Boardâs Role in Risk Oversight\n\nOur board of directors is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes. Our board of directors, as a whole, determines the appropriate level of risk for our Company, assesses the specific risks that we face, and reviews managementâs strategies for adequately mitigating and managing the identified risks. The board executes its oversight duties in part by assigning responsibility to committees of the board to oversee the management of risks that fall within their respective areas. In performing this function, each board committee has full access to management, as well as the ability to engage advisors. The chair of each committee reports on the applicable committeeâs activities at each board meeting and has the opportunity to discuss risk management with the full board at that time\n\nâ\n\nCompensation Risk Management and Other Policies\n\nCompensation Risk Assessment\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Korn Ferry supported management and the compensation committee in conducting their risk assessment of our incentive compensation plans and practices. Included in the review were all cash and equity-based incentive plans, insider trading prohibitions, and independent oversight by the compensation committee. Management and the compensation committee evaluated these compensation policies and practices to ensure that they do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. They considered the Companyâs growth and return performance, the mix of compensation between fixed and variable pay, financial and non-financial metrics, and the time horizon of the compensation policies in place. As a result of this analysis, as well as the regular review of compensation policies and practices, management and the compensation committee have concluded that the Companyâs compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Accordingly, there were no material adjustments made to our compensation policies and practices. We will continue to monitor our compensation policies and practices to determine whether our risk management objectives are being met with respect to incentivizing the Companyâs executive officers.\n\nPolicies Prohibiting Hedging, Pledging, and Speculative or Short-Term Trading\n\nOur Insider Trading Policy (the âInsider Trading Policyâ) prohibits employees (including executive officers) and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries (each an âAssociated Personâ) and members of an Associated Personâs immediate family who live in the same household as such Associated Person (each a âCovered Personâ) from pledging, hypothecating, or otherwise encumbering shares of the Companyâs stock as collateral for indebtedness. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, holding such shares in a\n\nmargin account or any other account that could cause the Companyâs stock to be subject to a margin call or otherwise be available as collateral for a margin loan.\n\nThe Insider Trading Policy also prohibits Covered Persons from engaging in short sales (sales of securities that are not currently owned by the seller), short-term trading, transactions in put or call options, margin trading, or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to Company securities at any time.\n\nBoard Participation\n\nOur board of directors held four meetings in fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2024, each of our directors attended 75% or more of all of the meetings of our board of directors and of the committees on which he or she served. We regularly schedule executive sessions in which independent directors meet without the presence or participation of management.\n\nWhile we do not have a formal policy on directorsâ attendance at annual meetings, we encourage our directors to attend each annual meeting of stockholders. All of our directors who were directors at the time of our 2023 annual meeting attended the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders either in person or by telephone, with the exception of Ms. MacDonald.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nOur board of directors has the authority to appoint committees to perform certain management and administration functions. Our board of directors has an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee are described below. Members will serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by the board of directors.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nOur audit committee provides oversight of our accounting and financial reporting process, the audit of our financial statements and our internal control function. Among other matters, the audit committee is responsible for the following:\n\nâassisting the board of directors in oversight of our independent registered public accounting firmâs qualifications, independence and performance;\n\nâ\n\nâthe engagement, retention, oversight, evaluation and compensation of our independent registered public accounting firm;\n\nâ\n\nâreviewing the scope of the annual audit;\n\nâ\n\nâreviewing and discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the results of the annual audit and the review of our quarterly financial statements, including the disclosures in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC;\n\nâ\n\nâreviewing our risk assessment and risk management processes;\n\nâ\n\nâreviewing and monitoring our accounting principles, accounting policies, financial and accounting controls and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n\nâ\n\nâestablishing procedures for receiving, retaining and investigating complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or audit matters;\n\nâ\n\nâapproving audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm; and\n\nâ\n\nâreviewing the performance of the audit committee, including compliance with its charter.\n\nâ\n\nOur audit committee is comprised of Brenda I. Morris, the chair of the committee, Eddie Burt, Anne MacDonald and Brad Weston. All members of our audit committee meet the requirements for financial literacy under the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE. Our board of directors has determined that Ms. Morris is an âaudit committee financial expertâ as defined under the applicable rules of the SEC and has the requisite financial sophistication as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE. Ms. Morris, Mr. Burt, Ms. MacDonald and Mr. Weston are all independent directors as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE.

Laube, the chair of the committee, Anne MacDonald and Peter Starrett. Ms. Laube, Ms. MacDonald and Mr. Starrett are all independent directors as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE. Our nominating and corporate governance committee has a written charter that sets forth the committeeâs purpose and responsibilities. A copy of the charter is available on our website and described under âAvailability of Corporate Governance Informationâ on page 16.\n\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee met four times during fiscal 2024.\n\nIdentifying and Evaluating Director Candidates\n\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee will consider persons recommended by stockholders for inclusion as nominees for election to our board of directors. Stockholders wishing to recommend director candidates for consideration by the nominating and corporate governance committee may do so by writing to the Corporate Secretary at 15345 Barranca Pkwy., Irvine, California 92618, and providing the requisite information as set forth in our amended and restated bylaws, including, without limitations, the recommended nomineeâs name, biographical data and qualifications, accompanied by the written consent of the recommended nominee.\n\nThe evaluation process for director nominees who are recommended by our stockholders is the same as for any other nominee and is based on numerous factors that our nominating and corporate governance committee considers appropriate, some of which may include strength of character, mature judgment, career specialization, relevant technical skills, diversity reflecting ethnic background, gender and professional experience, and the extent to which the nominee would fill a present need on our board of directors.\n\nBoard Diversity\n\nWhile we do not have a formal policy outlining the diversity standards to be considered when evaluating director candidates, our objective is to foster diversity of thought on our board of directors. To accomplish that objective, the nominating and corporate governance committee considers ethnic and gender diversity, as well as differences in perspective, professional experience, education, skill, and other qualities in the context of the needs of our board of directors. Nominees are not to be discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or any other basis prohibited by law. The nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates its effectiveness in achieving diversity on the board of directors through its annual review of board member composition.\n\nstores, implementing Title 24, utilization of programmable and lockable thermostats in retail locations, retrofitting to more energy efficient lighting in existing stores, adding low flush toilets to save water, joining local recycling programs, utilizing janitorial products that are ecofriendly and water based, and upgrading to more environmentally friendly freon for our HVAC units. We have also recently engaged in an initiative to proactively replace aged HVAC units in our stores with new energy star-rated HVAC units. This initiative will help to reduce store utility costs per square foot and accelerate our use of environmentally friendly freon in our HVAC units. In our distribution centers, we use shipping boxes made from 70% post-consumer product, recycle pallets and corrugated boxes, utilize a professional warehouse management system that operates in an efficient environment, and strive to utilize propane or natural gas over oil-based fuels.\n\nSocial\n\nWe are committed to partnering with manufacturers and brands that run their business and treat their employees under fair, responsible and ethical standards.

We have standards that are in line with common, expected industry practices and international laws. All agents and factories are expected to comply with these standards in order to continue doing business with us. We are committed to ensuring that fair labor practices are followed with all our partners. We require workers to be employed in conditions that are safe, free of harassment, abuse and without discrimination and do not tolerate child labor or forced labor of any kind.

The Boot Straps Fund is an employee-supported charity where every dollar donated goes to an employee in need. The Company also contributes to the Boot Straps Fund.\n\nGovernance\n\nOur board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines to help it fulfill its responsibilities to the Companyâs stockholders to oversee the work of management and the Companyâs business and operations.

Each nominee is presently a director of our Company and has consented to serve a one-year term if elected, concluding at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, and each nominee was elected at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders for which proxies were solicited. Biographical information about each of our director nominees, is contained under âOur Boardâ above. At the Annual Meeting, eight directors will be elected to our board of directors.\n\nRequired Vote\n\nThe eight nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative âFORâ votes shall be elected as directors. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted âFORâ each of these eight nominees.\n\nRecommendation of the Board\n\nOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE âFORâ THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE ABOVE-NAMED NOMINEES.\n\nâ\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nOur board of directors has adopted a compensation policy for our directors who are not our employees (âOutside Directorsâ). There were no changes to the director compensation policy from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. Accordingly, during fiscal 2024, under this policy, Outside Directors received an annual cash retainer of $75,000, payable quarterly, and reimbursement of reasonable expenses relating to attendance at board of directors and board committee meetings. In addition, the chairperson of our board of directors received an additional annual cash retainer of $100,000, the chairperson of our audit committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000, the chairperson of our compensation committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000, and the chairperson of our nominating and corporate governance committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000, payable quarterly.\n\nIn addition to the cash compensation discussed above, we grant to our Outside Directors under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan restricted stock units, payable in shares of our common stock. The restricted stock units are subject to time-based vesting conditions that lapse on the first day following the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued service as a member of our board of directors. Settlement in respect of the restricted stock units is made upon the satisfaction of the applicable vesting requirements; however, beginning in fiscal 2020, our Outside Directors may elect to defer receipt of such shares of common stock. Consistent with fiscal 2023, in fiscal 2024, we granted to our Outside Directors under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan restricted stock units with a market value of $110,000.\n\nOur board of directors recognizes that stock ownership by directors may strengthen their commitment to the long-term future of our Company and further align their interests with those of our stockholders. Accordingly, our Outside Directors are subject to the Companyâs Stock Ownership Guidelines (see page 29 of this proxy statement for more information regarding our Stock Ownership Guidelines for Outside Directors).\n\nDirector Compensation Table\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the compensation paid to our Outside Directors in fiscal 2024.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nName\n\nFees Earned or Paid in Cash\n\nStock Awards (1)\n\nOption Awards\n\nAll Other Compensation\n\nTotal\n\nPeter Starrett\n\nâ\n\n$\n\n175,000\n\nâ\n\n$\n\n109,979\n\nâ\n\n$\n\n-\n\nâ\n\n$\n\n-\n\nâ\n\n$\n\n284,979\n\nChris Bruzzo\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n90,000\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n109,979\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n-\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n-\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n199,979\n\nEddie Burt\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n75,000\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n109,979\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n-\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n-\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n184,979\n\nLisa G.

Based on such review and discussion, the compensation committee recommended to our board of directors, and our board of directors approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024 for filing with the SEC.\n\nChris Bruzzo, Chairperson\n\nLisa G. Laube\n\nPeter Starrett\n\nâ\n\nThe information contained in the âCompensation Committee Reportâ is not considered to be âsoliciting material,â âfiledâ or incorporated by reference in any past or future filing by the Company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act unless and only to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAnnual Cash Incentive Bonus\n\nOur NEOs are eligible to receive annual cash incentives as part of our Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Plan. Our Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Plan was designed by the Committee to reward our senior executives for achieving targeted amounts of a variation of Consolidated EBIT, defined for this purpose as earnings before income taxes, excluding certain one-time selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in the case of NEOs other than our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, certain additional financial performance goals related to such NEOâs duties and responsibilities, are as follows:\n\nâLaurie Grijalva, Chief Merchandising Officer, consolidated merchandise margin and consolidated exclusive brand sales penetration;\n\nâJohn Hazen, Chief Digital Officer, consolidated exclusive brand sales penetration; and\n\nâMichael A. Love, Chief Retail Officer, consolidated exclusive brand sales penetration.\n\nIn early fiscal 2024, the Committee established a target performance objective for Consolidated EBIT. In setting the performance measure, the Committee approved a target performance objective that it considered to be challenging, but achievable. At the same time that the target performance objective was approved, the Committee also set each NEOâs targeted payout as a percentage of his or her base salary â with potential payouts ranging from 0% to 200% of the targeted amounts based on actual performance. While the fiscal 2024 bonus plan was substantially the same as that in fiscal 2023, the Committee did approve increases in the target bonus percentage for Mr. Conroy and Mr. Watkins, and for the other NEOs, added a provision where future bonus payouts will be capped at target level for secondary measures if the Company fails to meet its minimum threshold on Consolidated EBIT.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, target Consolidated EBIT was set at $209.9 million. In determining the Consolidated EBIT target, the Committee considered the Companyâs performance with respect to Consolidated EBIT in fiscal 2023, as well as factors that may impact fiscal 2024 performance. Taking into consideration that fiscal 2023 was a 53-week year and fiscal 2024 was a 52-week year, as well as general declining sale trends in the macroeconomic environment, the Committee determined to set the fiscal 2024 Consolidated EBIT target below the Companyâs actual fiscal 2023 Consolidated EBIT (i.e., $231.8). The minimum threshold to receive a Consolidated EBIT bonus (at 85% of target) was set at $178.4 million, and annual Consolidated EBIT of $241.3 million or more would result in a 200% payout percentage. Actual Consolidated EBIT for fiscal 2024 was $200.2 million, which was 95% of the target and resulted in a payout percentage of 85%. In addition, the Committee determined that the individual financial performance goals for each NEO had been achieved at various levels. Consolidated exclusive brand sales penetration resulted in a payout percentage of 114% and consolidated merchandise margin resulted in a payout percentage of 50%.\n\nThe below table highlights the annual cash incentive bonus potentials and payouts for each of our NEOs in fiscal 2024.\n\nâ\n\nFiscal 2025 Bonus Plan\n\nThe fiscal 2025 bonus program will be substantially the same as the fiscal 2024 bonus program, with a few changes. The Committee approved increases in the target bonus percentage for Messrs. Watkins, Hazen, and Love and Ms. Grijalva.\n\nLong-Term Equity Incentives\n\nUnder our long-term incentive program, the Committee has the authority to award various forms of long-term incentive grants, including stock options, performance-based awards and restricted stock units.\n\nAll awards granted in fiscal 2024 to our NEOs were restricted stock units or performance share units granted under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the â2020 Planâ). While all types of awards incentivize retention, the value of restricted stock units increase as our stock price increases, and the number of performance share units ultimately received depends on the Companyâs cumulative earnings per share over a three-year performance period relative to the established performance target. The Committeeâs objectives for the fiscal 2024 long-term incentive awards were to establish a direct link between compensation and Company performance as demonstrated through our stock price and earnings per share and to retain the services of our executives through multi-year vesting provisions. The Committeeâs objective with regards to NEO compensation is to continue to increase the component of pay tied to long-term incentive awards. The Committee believes that long-term incentive compensation becomes a more critical component of NEO pay and retaining key executives through challenging economic periods.\n\nIn determining the fiscal 2024 long-term incentive award levels for our NEOs, the Committee compared the target total direct compensation of each NEO to applicable market data including both salary and equity-incentive awards.\n\nThe fiscal 2024 restricted stock units granted to the NEOs vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period subject to continued service or in connection with certain events as defined by the 2020 Plan and as determined by the Committee. The performance share units granted are stock-based awards, under which the number of shares ultimately received depends on the Companyâs cumulative earnings per share over a three-year performance period beginning April 2, 2023 and ending March 28, 2026 relative to the established performance target. This performance metric was established by the Committee at the beginning of the performance period. Given its relationship to our annual operating plan and business strategy, the pre-established cumulative earnings per share goal and its specific target levels for the performance period are confidential and commercially-sensitive information that we\n\ndo not publicly disclose. We believe that such information would provide our competitors, customers, and other third parties with significant insights regarding our confidential business strategies and could cause us substantial competitive harm.\n\nAt the end of the performance period, the number of shares to be issued in settlement of the performance share units is based on the Companyâs actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the cumulative three-year performance is at a level below the threshold level, the number of performance units to vest will be 0%, if performance is at the threshold level, the number of performance units to vest will be 50% of the target amounts, if performance is at the target level, the number of performance units to vest will be 100% of the target amounts, and if performance is at the maximum level, the number of performance units to vest will be 200% of the target amounts, each subject to continued service by the applicable award recipient through the last day of the performance period (subject to certain exceptions described below under the headings âEmployment Agreementsâ and âPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Controlâ). If performance is between threshold and target goals or between target and maximum goals, the number of performance units to vest will be determined by linear interpolation. The number of shares ultimately issued under the performance unit award ranges from 0% to 200% of the participantâs target amount. The awards are forfeited if the threshold performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period.\n\nThe grant mix shown below was chosen to provide a majority emphasis on driving performance results and stock price appreciation, while also providing retentive value.

Consistent with fiscal 2024, the Committee has not granted any stock options in connection with its routine annual grants for fiscal 2025.\n\nOther Elements of our Fiscal 2024 Compensation Program\n\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\n\nSince fiscal 2019, we have maintained the Boot Barn, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the âDeferred Compensation Planâ). Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may defer up to 80% of their base salary, 90% of bonus payments and 100% of restricted stock units. Our Company may make discretionary contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan on behalf of participants. Any Company-based contributions are subject to a five-year graded vesting schedule. Cash amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are deemed invested in one or more investment funds made available by the Company and\n\nselected by the participant. Mr. Love was the only NEO to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan in fiscal 2024. The Company did not make any discretionary contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan in fiscal 2024.\n\n401(k) Plan and Other Benefits\n\nEach of our NEOs is eligible to participate in our 401(k) Plan. Participating employees may defer compensation into the plan, up to the statutory maximum set by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, our Company provides matching contributions under the plan to eligible employees, including our NEOs. The matching contributions provided by our Company under the 401(k) Plan are equal to 100% of employee contributions, up to 3% of their compensation and 50% of further employee contributions, up to 5% of their compensation, subject to the annual limits established by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nRole of the Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Committee made all decisions regarding the compensation levels of our executive officers.\n\nIt is the Committee's responsibility to (1) oversee the design of our executive compensation programs, policies and practices, (2) determine the types and amounts of most compensation for NEOs, and (3) review and approve the adoption, termination and amendment of, and to administer and, as appropriate, make recommendations to the Board regarding, our cash incentive and equity incentive plans. The Committee has the authority to exercise discretion with respect to executive compensation awards and performance metrics and may authorize adjustments to targets and/or awards as it deems necessary or appropriate. No such discretion was exercised with respect to the NEOsâ fiscal 2024 compensation.\n\nIn addition, as described below, the Committee directly engaged Korn Ferry (US) (âKorn Ferryâ) to assist in its review of compensation for our executive officers.\n\nRole of Management in Executive Compensation\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Conroy, provides input and makes recommendations to the Committee regarding our executive compensation program. He also reports to the Committee on individual NEO performance and provides recommendations regarding each NEOâs compensation (except with respect to his own compensation).\n\nRole of Independent Compensation Consultant\n\nThe Committee engaged Korn Ferry in October 2023 as its independent compensation consultant to advise on NEO and director compensation for fiscal 2024. The independent compensation consultant generally advises the Committee on the appropriateness of our compensation philosophy, peer group selection and general executive compensation program design. As part of its engagement with the Committee, the independent compensation consultant:\n\nâadvised on the selection of a peer group of companies for executive officer compensation comparison purposes;\n\nâ\n\nâprovided guidance on industry best practices and emerging trends and developments in executive officer compensation;\n\nâ\n\nâanalyzed peer company proxy and other survey data as appropriate; and\n\nâ\n\nâadvised on determining the total compensation of each of our executive officers and the material elements of total compensation, including annual base salaries, target cash bonus amounts, and the structure and target amount of long-term incentive awards.\n\nâ\n\nThe Committee annually reviews the independence of Korn Ferry as its consultant under applicable SEC and NYSE rules on conflicts of interest. Following this review, the Committee determined that Korn Ferryâs work for us does not raise any conflicts of interest. The Committee's evaluation included consideration of all services provided to us, the amount of fees received as a percentage of Korn Ferryâs annual revenue, its policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest, any business or personal relationships between Korn Ferry and the members of the Committee or executive officers and any ownership of our stock by the\n\nadvisors providing executive and director compensation services to us. Korn Ferry did not provide any additional services unrelated to executive or director or broader equity strategy compensation consulting in fiscal 2024.\n\nPeer Group and Benchmarking\n\nIn making executive compensation determinations for fiscal 2024, we relied on the significant experience of our directors in establishing compensation across many companies in multiple industries, as well as the input of our Chief Executive Officer, who has many years of experience in our industry. We have also established a peer group of firms in similar business sectors, most notably specialty retail. The peers selected are of a comparable size and complexity. There were no changes in fiscal 2024 to our peer group used in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2024 peer group was comprised of the companies listed below.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co.\n\nChildrenâs Place, Inc.\n\nCrocs, Inc.\n\nFive Below, Inc.\n\nFloor and Decor Holdings, Inc.\n\nHibbett Sports, Inc.\n\nLeslieâs, Inc.\n\nMarineMax, Inc.\n\nNational Vision Holdings, Inc.\n\nOllieâs Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.\n\nSally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nShoe Carnival, Inc.\n\nSleep Number Corporation\n\nStitch Fix, Inc.\n\nThe Buckle, Inc.\n\nUrban Outfitters, Inc.\n\nZumiez Inc.\n\nThe pay levels and award practices of these firms were considered as inputs when establishing the fiscal 2024 compensation programs for our NEOs. The Committee periodically evaluates competitive market data to include the most suitable peer group, as well as other market data deemed relevant. The Committee reviews our NEO compensation against an appropriate peer group on a more formal basis and also considers other relevant market data to ensure that our NEO compensation is competitive and sufficient to recruit and retain our NEOs. The Committee periodically reviews and updates this peer group for benchmarking and peer group analysis in determining and developing compensation packages for our NEOs.\n\nTax Considerations\n\nAs a general matter, our Board and the Committee review and consider the various tax and accounting implications of our existing and proposed compensation programs.\n\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the âCodeâ), generally disallows publicly-listed companies a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain current and former executive officers. Although the Committee considers tax consequences as a factor when it makes compensation decisions, it retains the discretion and flexibility to make compensation decisions resulting in the grant of non-deductible compensation to the extent it deems that it is appropriate.\n\nStock Ownership Guidelines\n\nThe Compensation Committee maintains stock ownership guidelines to further align the interests of our executive officers and directors with the interests of our stockholders and to encourage long-term stock ownership. The guidelines apply for so long as the executive officer or director occupies such positions.\n\nThe stock ownership guidelines for NEOs and directors are shown below as multiples of base salary and annual cash retainer, respectively:\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nRole\n\nMultiple\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n5x\n\nOther NEO\n\n2x\n\nDirector\n\n5x\n\nQualifying holdings include: (1) shares held directly or jointly with a spouse; (2) shares held individually or by a spouse or children residing in the executive officerâs or directorâs household; (3) shares held by a family partnership or trust created by the executive officer or director or for which he or she or their spouse acts as a general partner or trustee and for which the executive officer or director, their spouse or children are among the qualified beneficiaries; and (4) the executive officerâs or directorâs vested and unvested time-based restricted stock and RSUs. Vested and unvested stock options and unvested shares subject to performance-based vesting awards do not count towards satisfaction of the guidelines. The above stock ownership guidelines were adopted in fiscal 2024 and are expected to be met within five years of the adoption date. As of March 30, 2024, all named executives officers and directors are expected to be in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines within the five-year compliance period.\n\nClawback Policy\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Committee adopted a new incentive compensation recoupment policy. Our policy, which is administered by the Committee, complies with the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC, and the NYSE. This policy provides for the mandatory recoupment of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement. During fiscal 2024, the Company was not required to recoup any compensation under our incentive compensation recoupment policy.\n\nAnti-Hedging Policy\n\nThe Companyâs Insider Trading Policy prohibits NEOs from the hedging of securities. For more information, please see âCompensation Risk Management and Other Policiesâ on page 11 of this proxy statement.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nJames G. Conroy\n\nWe entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Conroy on November 12, 2012, which was amended and restated as of April 7, 2015, pursuant to which Mr. Conroy serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Conroyâs employment agreement had an initial term of three years, after which it automatically renews each year for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal or his employment is otherwise terminated, in each case pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement.\n\nUnder his employment agreement, Mr. Conroy is entitled to a base salary, which as of March 30, 2024 was $1,000,000.\n\nHe is eligible to participate in our annual incentive bonus program with Mr. Conroyâs actual bonus for any year determined based on Company and personal performance. Mr. Conroy is also entitled to participate in our health and welfare benefit plans that are generally available to our executives.\n\nIf we terminate Mr. Conroyâs employment without âCauseâ or if he resigns for âGood Reasonâ or if we provide Mr. Conroy with notice of non-renewal, Mr. Conroy is entitled to receive, subject to his execution of a valid release of claims, severance pay equal to his base salary for a period of 12 months, an amount equal to 75% of his base salary payable on the sixtieth day following his date of termination, and any accrued but unpaid bonus relating to the fiscal year ended prior to his termination that would have been paid if he had remained employed as of the scheduled payment date for such bonus (the âAccrued Bonusâ). In addition, if he timely elects COBRA health benefits coverage, Mr. Conroy shall be entitled to receive up to 12 monthly payments, each equal to the portion of the premium paid by us for COBRA coverage for active senior executives immediately prior to the termination date (the âHealth Severanceâ). If Mr. Conroyâs employment is terminated without Cause, or if he resigns for Good Reason or if we provide Mr. Conroy with notice of non-renewal within one year following, or three months preceding, a âChange of Controlâ (as such term is defined in his employment agreement), Mr. Conroy is entitled to receive, subject to his execution of a valid release of claims and in lieu of the severance benefits described above, the Health Severance and severance pay equal to his base salary for a period of 24 months, an amount equal to 150% of his base salary payable on the sixtieth day following his date of termination, and any Accrued Bonus. In addition, in the event of such termination, all of his unvested equity awards will immediately vest on his date of termination and become exercisable in accordance with their terms (âAccelerated Vestingâ). If any amounts payable to Mr. Conroy pursuant to his employment agreement, taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise payable to him by us and any other person or entity required to be aggregated with us for purposes of Section 280G of the Code, under any other plan, agreement, or arrangement (the âCovered Paymentsâ), would be an âexcess parachute paymentâ as defined in Section 280G of the Code and subject Mr. Conroy to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, and Mr. Conroy would receive a greater net after tax benefit by limiting the amount of such Covered Payments, then his employment agreement requires us to reduce the aggregate value of all Covered Payments to an amount equal to 2.99 times Mr. Conroyâs average annual compensation as calculated in accordance with Section 280G of the Code. If Mr. Conroyâs employment is terminated due to his death, his personal representatives or heirs are entitled to receive, subject to execution of a valid release of claims, Accelerated Vesting, if applicable.\n\nUnder Mr. Conroyâs employment agreement, âCauseâ means his:\n\n(A)intentional refusal or intentional failure to perform his duties and responsibilities under the employment agreement or to follow any reasonable instruction issued by the Company or our board of directors;\n\n(B)failure to comply in any material respect with any written policies or procedures of the Company or our board of directors (including, but not limited to, the Companyâs anti-discrimination and harassment policies and the Companyâs drug and alcohol policy);\n\n(C)engagement in any act or omission involving willful misfeasance or nonfeasance by Mr. Conroy of his assigned duties, which includes, without limitation, the intentional refusal by Mr. Conroy to follow the directions of our board of directors or any committee thereof or the intentional refusal by Mr. Conroy to perform his assigned duties in any material respect;\n\n(D)engagement in any act of theft, fraud, embezzlement, falsification of the Company documents, misappropriation of funds or other assets of the Company or in any misconduct which is materially damaging to the goodwill, business or reputation of the Company;\n\n(E)conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction of, or his pleading guilty or nolo contendere to, any felony or crime involving moral turpitude that is damaging to the reputation of the Company; or\n\n(F)material breach of any of his obligations contained in the employment agreement.\n\nPrior to any termination for Cause pursuant to (A), (B) or (F), the Company must give written notice to Mr. Conroy within 60 days of any event triggering the applicable subsection and Mr. Conroy shall thereafter have the right to remedy the condition, if such condition can be remedied, within 30 days of the date Mr. Conroy receives the written notice from the Company. If Mr. Conroy does not remedy the condition within the 30-day cure period to the reasonable satisfaction of our board of directors, then our board of directors may deliver a notice of termination for Cause at any time within 30 days following the expiration of such cure period, in which case termination will be effective upon delivery of such notice.\n\nUnder Mr. Conroyâs employment agreement, âChange of Controlâ generally means any of the following events:\n\n(A)A merger, consolidation, reorganization or arrangement involving the Company other than a merger, consolidation, reorganization or arrangement in which our stockholders immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, reorganization or arrangement own, directly or indirectly, securities possessing at least 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger, consolidation, reorganization or arrangement in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of such voting securities immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, reorganization or arrangement;\n\n(B)The acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any person or related group of persons acting jointly or in concert (other than the Company or a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company) of beneficial ownership of securities possessing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the Companyâs outstanding securities pursuant to a tender offer made directly to our stockholders;\n\n(C)The sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company other than a sale, transfer or other disposition to an affiliate of the Company or to an entity in which our stockholders immediately prior to such sale, transfer or other disposition own, directly or indirectly, securities possessing at least 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the purchasing entity in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of such voting securities immediately prior to sale, transfer or other disposition; or\n\n(D)A change in the composition of our board of directors over a period of 24 consecutive months or less such that a majority of our board of directors ceases to be comprised of individuals who either have been: members of our board of directors continuously since the beginning of such period (âIncumbent Membersâ), or appointed or nominated for election as members of our board of directors during such period by at least a majority of Incumbent Members who were still in office at the time our board of directors approved such appointment or nomination.\n\nâGood Reasonâ is defined in Mr. Conroyâs employment agreement as the occurrence of any of the following events without Mr. Conroy's written consent:\n\n(A)any diminution in base salary or target bonus amount;\n\n(B)any material and continuing diminution in Mr. Conroyâs authority or responsibilities, such that Mr. Conroy no longer has the title of, or serves or functions as, the chief executive officer;\n\n(C)changing the geographic location at which Mr. Conroy provides services to the Company to a location more than 35 miles further from Mr. Conroyâs residence;\n\n(D)a material breach by the Company of its obligations under the employment agreement; or\n\n(E)requiring Mr. Conroy to report to someone other than our board of directors.\n\nHowever, Mr. Conroy may only resign for Good Reason if he provides written notice to our board of directors of any event constituting Good Reason within 60 days after Mr. Conroy becomes aware of the occurrence of any such event, our board of directors does not cure said event within 30 days after receipt of the notice, and Mr. Conroy terminates his employment within 90 days of the date of his written notice.\n\nJames M. Watkins\n\nWe entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Watkins on October 26, 2021, which became effective on November 1, 2021, pursuant to which Mr. Watkins serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.

Mr. Love is also entitled to participate in our health and welfare benefit plans or other programs of our Company that are generally available to other similarly situated executives.\n\nIf we terminate Mr. Loveâs employment without âCauseâ or he resigns for âGood Reasonâ, then he is entitled to receive, subject to his execution of a valid release of claims, severance pay equal to his base salary for a period of six months.\n\nUnder Mr. Loveâs employment agreement, âCauseâ means his:\n\n(A)refusal or failure to substantially perform the duties of his position or follow the reasonable instructions of the Company or our board of directors;\n\n(B)failure to comply in any material respect with any written policies or procedures of the Company or our board of directors (including, but not limited to, the Companyâs drug or anti-harassment policies, etc.);\n\n(C)engagement in any act of theft, fraud, embezzlement, willful misfeasance or misconduct, falsification of Company documents, misappropriation of funds or other assets of the Company, or committing any act which is materially damaging to the goodwill, business or reputation of the Company;\n\n(D)breach of any of his fiduciary duties to the Company;\n\n(E)conviction or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to any felony or crime involving moral turpitude; or\n\n(F)material breach of any of his obligations to the Company or the confidential and proprietary information agreement.\n\nâGood Reasonâ is defined in Mr. Loveâs employment agreement as the occurrence of any of the following events without Mr. Loveâs consent:\n\n(A)any material diminution in base salary, other than a diminution that was in conjunction with a salary reduction program for similarly-situated employees of the Company or its affiliates;\n\n(B)any material and continuing diminution in Mr. Loveâs authority or responsibilities; or\n\n(C)changing the geographic location at which Mr. Love provides services to the Company (in Orange County) to a location more than thirty-five (35) miles from both the then existing location and Mr. Loveâs residence.\n\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\n\nThe Company has a Deferred Compensation Plan permitting a select group of management employees and our directors to defer compensation to a future date. The value of the deferred compensation is recognized based on the fair value of the participantsâ accounts. Our Company established a rabbi trust for the purpose of funding the benefits payable under this plan, with the assets invested in a variety of marketable securities and cash equivalents, excluding our Companyâs stock. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Company may credit participant accounts with discretionary contributions. Any Company credits are subject to a five-year graded vesting schedule; however, the Company did not make any discretionary contributions during fiscal 2024. The table below reflects the contributions made and aggregate earnings/(losses) during fiscal 2024 for Michael A. Love, who was the only NEO who participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan during the fiscal year.\n\n(1)The amount shown in this column reflects the base salary and Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Plan payout for fiscal 2024 that was deferred by Mr. Love, who was the only NEO to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan in fiscal 2024. Of the $177,321 reported for Mr. Love in this column, $46,547 is included in the âSalaryâ and $130,774 is included in the âNon-Equity Incentive Plan Compensationâ column totals for fiscal 2024 reported in the âSummary Compensation Tableâ beginning on page 31 of this Proxy Statement.\n\n(2)The amount shown is not considered above market or preferential earnings and is not reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n(3)$922,424 is included in the balance as of March 30, 2024 and previously was reported as compensation to Mr. Love in the Summary Compensation Tables for past fiscal years.\n\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\n\nThe Committee recognizes that the possibility of the termination of an executive officerâs employment, and the uncertainty it creates, may result in the loss or distraction of the executive officer, and present challenges in recruiting potential executive officers, all to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders. The Committee considers the avoidance of such loss, distraction and challenges to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. To help ensure that the Company has the continued attention and dedication of these executives and the availability of their continued service, to facilitate the Companyâs recruiting efforts and to provide severance benefits upon a qualifying termination that are consistent with market practices, the Company provides certain severance payments and benefits to our NEOs pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements and equity award agreements.\n\nAs noted in the CD&A, we employ our executive officers, including all of our NEOs, âat will.â We do not provide any Internal Revenue Code Section 280G excise tax gross-up payments and none of our change in control payments are âsingle trigger.â Refer to the âExecutive Compensation--Employment Agreementsâ section above for a description of our âdouble triggerâ arrangements with our NEOs.\n\nThe table below reflects the amount of compensation that would be payable to our NEOs in the event of a termination without âcauseâ or for âgood reasonâ (a âQualifying Terminationâ) (each such term as defined in the applicable employment agreement (except that for Ms. Grijalva the payments are only triggered by a termination without cause)), assuming the NEO had terminated employment on the last day of fiscal 2024.\n\nCEO Pay Ratio\n\nSEC rules require us to disclose the total annual compensation of our principal executive officer for fiscal 2024, who was James G. Conroy, and the median of the total annual compensation of all employees other than our principal executive officer, as well as their ratio to each other (the âCEO Pay Ratioâ). Total annual compensation for our principal executive officer and for the median of the total annual compensation of all employees is calculated in accordance with SEC rules applicable to the Summary Compensation Table. For fiscal 2024, these amounts were as follows:\n\nâOur principal executive officerâs total annual compensation was $6,973,503.\n\nâ\n\nâOur median compensated employeeâs total annual compensation was $13,365. Our median compensated employee works part-time for the Company.\n\nâ\n\nâBased on this information for fiscal 2024, we estimate that the ratio of our CEOâs annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 522 to 1.\n\nâ\n\nTo identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:\n\nâWe determined our employee population as of March 30, 2024, our determination date. As of this date, we had a total of 11,346 employees, excluding our CEO. Of this total, 73% were part-time employees and seasonal or temporary workers.\n\nâTo identify the âmedian employeeâ from our employee population, we measured the employee populationâs total annual compensation for fiscal 2024, including salary, stock awards, option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, non-qualified deferred compensation earnings and all other compensation.\n\nâWe identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the âmedian employee.â\n\nâWe annualized compensation of employees who were not employed with us for the full fiscal year.We did not annualize compensation for seasonal workers, and we did not make full-time equivalent adjustments for part-time employees. In determining our median compensated employee and calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, we did not use any of the exemptions permitted under SEC rules.\n\nOur Company believes that the CEO Pay Ratio set forth above is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2024, determined in a manner consistent with SEC rules. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the CEO Pay Ratio based on that employeeâs total annual compensation permit companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exemptions and to make certain assumptions, adjustments or estimates that reflect their compensation policies. Accordingly, the CEO Pay Ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported by other companies, which may have used different methodologies, assumptions, adjustments or estimates in calculating their pay ratios.\n\nâ\n\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE\n\nâ\n\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of âcompensation actually paidâ (âCAPâ) to our principal executive officer (âPEOâ) and other NEOs (âNon-PEO NEOsâ) and our, and certain of our peersâ, p"
