        "text": "The twin appointments reflect the brand’s certainty that the future of media-driven marketing is inextricably tied to data and technology\n\nMedia investment management group, GroupM, has appointed Brian Lesser (pictured left) to the role of Chief Executive Officer for its operations across the United States and Canada. The new North American head was previously Global CEO at Xaxis, on the biggest programmatic media and technology platforms in the world.\n\nLesser succeeds Kelly Clark who will be transitioning to a new advisory role over the coming months, which is focused on strategic initiatives with clients and specialty businesses. Meanwhile, the agency’s Global Chief Digital Officer, Rob Norman, adds the position of Chairman, North America to his responsibilities.\n\nThe appointments reflect the brand’s certainty that the future of media-driven marketing is inextricably tied to data and technology. Key investments over the past several years that support the positioning include WPP’s investments in comScore and AppNexus as well as GroupM and Kantar Media’s tie-up with Rentrak.\n\nOther partnerships include further alliances with BuzzFeed and Networked Insights; the introduction of the industry’s first data management platform and programmatic audience platform; and debut of Modi Media, an advanced TV specialty business delivering addressable TV ads at scale.\n\nMeanwhile, the outfit’s progressive positions on digital ad viewability and measurement are focused on raising the bar for effectiveness and trading currency. Lesser and Rob will continue serving on GroupM’s global executive committee led by Dominic Proctor (pictured right), Global President and Irwin Gotlieb, Global Chairman.\n\n“Our future is being built on tech, data, talent and scale. Brian absolutely gets that and is perfectly suited to help us shape that future to best serve advertisers. We’re very fortunate to have him leading our business in the world’s biggest market,” said Proctor."
