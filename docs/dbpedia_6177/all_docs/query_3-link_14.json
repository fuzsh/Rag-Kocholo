        "text": "A seasoned executive with 24+ years of digital media, marketing and operations experience, Angelina Eng has focused her career on supporting agencies and brands to define, build and manage digital media and marketing efforts while enabling teams to operationally work efficiently and effectively with both internal and external partners and platforms. She’s been responsible for the development and management of internal systems and workflow, establishment of deliverable standards, designing ad trafficking and tracking guidelines, implementation of emerging platforms, as well as establishing best practices at companies such as Morgan Stanley, Merkle, Dentsu Aegis and Publicis Modem.\n\nOver the years, She has been involved with multiple organizations and events to help define, establish and advocate some of the industry standards that we see in today’s digital media ecosystem (such as ad verification/brand safety, ad fraud, viewability and programmatic, social, etc)\n\nAngelina has been awarded the AdMonsters 2018 Power List, IAB Data Rockstar 2016 and AdMonsters Digital Media Leadership Award 2016.\n\nMichael Vinson, PhD brings a unique blend of expertise in mathematics, theoretical physics, and data science as applied to media measurement and advertising to his role as Chief Research Officer at Comscore.\n\nDr. Vinson has played a key role in developing and reinventing Comscore’s measurement solutions across TV, computers, and mobile devices. Under his leadership, Comscore launched its groundbreaking TV measurement capabilities, and is now redesigning all its measurement systems to enable the privacy-focused methodologies demanded by consumers.\n\nDr. Vinson’s stewardship of Comscore’s analytics strategy builds on a strong, 25-year track record of achievement. Prior to joining Rentrak and Comscore, he served as Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Digital Insights and Analytics at Starcom MediaVest Group and, before that, as Chief Research Scientist at erinMedia, where he was granted multiple patents relating to mathematical methods for estimating demographics from privacy-safe digital set-top box data.\n\nPrior to joining the media measurement industry, Dr. Vinson – who holds a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago – was an academic and educator. He completed his post-doctoral work at Syracuse University in Physics, won a Fulbright Scholarship to teach and do research in computational physics at Yarmouk University in Jordan, and served as Chairman of the Department of Physics at Shippensberg University in Pennsylvania. Dr. Vinson has lived and worked in four countries around the globe, and his family includes his wife, three adult children, two dogs, and three cats. He currently lives in Oakland, California.\n\nPam is a 30+ year veteran of the media and marketing industry who is a proven media strategist across digital, programmatic, and traditional platforms. Known for innovative approaches to media and marketing challenges that turn the complex media eco system into understandable ideas for both the C-Suite and day-to-day tacticians. Pam sees the world as a white board – empty, boundless space to create, transform and innovate for growth; to re-imagine how media and marketing can work to grow brands and build companies. Pam believes winning at the intersection of data, content, marketplace, and technology means refusing to let the status quo be good enough and being humble enough to know true transformation takes collaboration, iteration, willpower, and trust.\n\nPam spent her first 25 years on the agency side at Publicis Media leading clients such as Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Activision, Yahoo and others. In addition to client leadership Pam built new practices for the agency including Advanced TV and Experience Design. To broaden her experience, Pam also spent 3 years leading Media for Starcom Mediavest Group in Russia when that market first opened to media in the mid-1990s. This taught Pam that anything is possible to create in the marketplace with some ingenuity, marketplace knowledge, and a relentless push creates win – win – win experiences for consumers, marketers and publishers. Following her work on the agency side, Pam spent five years consulting for the media and technology companies (NBCU, Fox, Viacom, Double Verify) helping them design custom programs and market their digital assets for growth. For the past fifteen months, Pam has been at Amobee, an Ad Tech firm, leading their marketing and sales strategy efforts to bring new identity, performance and new targeting techniques to the DSP and cross channel planning marketplace.\n\nPam lives in Hastings on Hudson, NY with her two sons."
