        "text": "Paul: Actually, there was a short interlude at a company called RD Percy. Roger’s still a very good friend of mine, and that was the day when there were four people meter services competing in the US. There was AGB, there was Arbitron, there was Nielsen, and then RD, the smallest of them.\n\nPercy closed. We were about to be bought by McGraw Hill. That didn’t happen, but McGraw Hill did hire me as a consultant. I worked for Kenny Clark, who is head of strategy research and a good part of McGraw [00:07:00] Hill. And then eventually I just got a call from then the CEO of Simmons, Ellen Cohen. So I sort of was somewhere in the print industry at McGraw Hill and then went over as president of the syndicated division of Simmons, which was the Big Simmons study.\n\n[music]\n\nSimmons and MRI– MRI I was a newcomer. Simmons was the established writing service through the book. The big issue in the industry, what the differences between ‘through the book’ and ‘recent reading’. So ‘through the book’, you actually have copies of the magazines, not the entire magazine, but their stripped down issues.\n\nMaybe fifteen pages of a magazine and it’s all personal interview and you ask people to go through the magazine and ask them whether they’ve read this particular issue of the magazine as opposed to recent reading, which is what we have now, which is to ask whether you’ve read any issue of the publication within the last publishing period.\n\nSo weekly, within the last week, a monthly, within the last [00:08:00] month. And as you can tell, recent reading is a much faster methodology, and you– recent reading has visual aids, it has logo cards that you shuffle through. But it’s a much faster methodology than actually having people look at a copy of the magazine, even though the magazine is stripped down to about 10 pages.\n\nSo the Hallmark studies, seminal studies back then was Dick Lysaker doing work on ‘recent reading’ versus ‘through the book’ and ‘recent reading’ really had the advantage of being able to measure many, many more magazines. And that ultimately is what hurt Simmons as a currency. They just— ‘through the book’, was just so much more of a time intensive.\n\nI think it was a much better methodology, but it was so much more of a time intensive methodology. It couldn’t handle the hundreds of magazines that needed to be measured the way an MRI could. And now Simmons and MRI are one company.\n\n[music]\n\nPaul: No. It was acquired by GFK. Old timers, well, don’t sell luck. He started audits and surveys. He started his career as a 19 year old physicist working for the Manhattan Project.\n\nCoke was probably represented about 30 or 40% of its revenues. We did worldwide tracking for Coke. Basically, if you ask, you know, people top of mind, awareness of the soft drink, sort of a change in half of a percentage point could be translated into what would happen in sales in that country. And so I was hired to go to audits and surveys to open up a media business.\n\nAnd you once asked, sort of, maybe this is kind of a seminal point in my career, but it was the roaring nineties in Latin America, economies were stabilizing except Mexico in the ‘94 crash. But we gave them a big loan and they’ve managed to repay it in two years. So there was a lot of optimism about Latin America and for the US cables.\n\nThis was [00:10:00] a continent which had two languages. Relative homogeneity, one religion, far more homogeneous than many other regions in the world. And so cables were very bullish in terms of launching their Latin American networks. And they needed research. They needed research that would sort of, you know, serve as a method for understanding across all the countries in Latin America, what the audience was and what the demographic composition was.\n\nAnd we did that, we started that at arts and surveys went at first by the name of Lat Tap, Latin American, something or other, and then moved to Tap LA and these were all organizations of cable networks who felt that it was all in their mutual interest to have research that properly represented cables in Latin America.\n\nAnd then that led to my consulting for what was then the largest rating service in research company in [00:11:00] Latin America, both out of Brazil. And so I became the chief technical officer for a boat. People will laugh ‘cause they don’t think of me as a chief technical officer, but I was, I don’t know. [laughs]\n\nAnd we competed against Nielsen. We beat Nielsen. Nielsen eventually assumed an 11% stake in IBOPE and closed down shop in Latin America. And IBOPE continues to be the premier research in rating service in Latin America.\n\nPaul: Richard Sellman, myself [00:14:00] and Andy Brown. I think I left first to go to Nielsen. Then Richard would leave and Andy became CEO. There was an SMR conference in Edinburgh and Phil Bernard, who was chairman of, I believe Kantar overall, met me there and asked me would I be interested in joining WPP. And, you know, we talked a little bit about South America and IBOPE and he let me know that there’s an interest in South America. So I said yeah. You know, there were a couple of MRBs, so Simmons used to be called Simmons Market Research Bureau.\n\nBMRB is British Market Research Bureau. IMRB was Indian Market Research Bureau. A number of the– they’ve all probably changed their names except BMRB, still has its name, but it was a collection of companies, not all of which were owned by WPP, [00:15:00] but they were, they were kind of cousin companies.\n\nThey went with the same name. They offered the same kind of product. Basically a multimedia survey and in Britain it was called TGI, Target Group Index, same as MRI Survey, MRI Simmons Survey. And what we did at Kantar was basically extend those, we developed them in about 10 countries in Latin America.\n\nWe developed them throughout Asia. And I think they’re probably about 40 different countries in which there’s a TGI study right now. Since we started it, it’s grown. It was a few hundred million in revenue and I don’t know what the numbers are today, but I’m sure it’s probably close to a billion dollars in revenue today.\n\n[music]\n\nPaul: You’re absolutely right. Like they own the city like six to eight. They absolutely own all the advertising inventory. And that’s where so much of that and the morning programming also, the morning news programming and [00:22:00] that’s where a large bulk of their revenues came from.\n\nAnd one unnamed network decided to go political in its fight against the introduction of people meters arguing that it didn’t fairly represent minority populations. And the next thing you know, I mean, I believe this is during the Gulf, I remember saying to myself, this is during the Gulf War, and I’m in Washington explaining to Senator Schumer how a people meter works compared to how a diary works and why the numbers correctly changed.\n\nAnd so we wound up doing two Senate subcommittee hearings. One Congressional subcommittee hearing. By the way, there was one of the guys who called this hearing, I forget his name, but he was a senator from Montana who the New York Times would call the most corrupt senator in Washington at the time.\n\nThis was… [laughter] And so what was his name? But all I know is he, the Times called him the most corrupt senator in Washington, and he’s the one [00:23:00] that this network got to call a Senate subcommittee hearing. [Duane laughs] We were like, well, this is something we’ve never done before. You know, all of a sudden now Nielsen started pulling together advisory groups, representing senior leaders in the multicultural world.\n\nYou know, many of whom were either ministers or leaders or celebrities, but all of whom were very influential in the multicultural world, and we just got very much more sophisticated in terms of dealing with issues like that and dealing with politics and politicians. For the first couple of years at Nielsen, I spent probably two days a week in Washington.\n\nI remember spending a lot of time with Xavier Becerra, who’s now on President Biden’s cabinet, who is then head of the Hispanic Caucus. Very nice guy, very understanding. I remember my first meeting with then Senator Clinton’s aid, Umma, and after about 20 minutes, she said, “this is a commercial dispute, isn’t [00:24:00] it?”\n\nAnd we said, “yes”. And she’s a smart woman. She’s in the press now quite a bit, but she dismissed the whole thing after 20 minutes meeting with us. So that’s what we did. We spent two days a week in Washington just walking in the halls talking to congressperson, senators, you know, about what this was all about.\n\nAnd that, yes, we understand that this was tough for stations to handle, but it does represent a more accurate measurement.\n\n[music]\n\nPaul: Sure. So I started my career, there were two currencies in local. There’s Arbitron and Nielsen. And many of the old timers remember doing comparagraphs about the two services. And the, you know, the nature– I guess most economists would say a currency [00:25:00] is, hate to use the word but a natural monopoly because it’s sort of an agreed upon valuation both the buyer and seller agrees upon.\n\nThis is a little bit different. Arbitron and Nielsen were doing exactly the same thing, producing just pure audience ratings. A lot of the new currencies started out as people doing attribution. In fact, many of them only really were evaluating ads, not programs, and then discovered they had data.\n\nThey had set up box data or automatic content recognition, Visio data, that could serve as a measurement of audience. So this is a little bit different in that many of them are still providing those other services like attribution. I don’t know where all of this will go. I will say, as an example, NBC was successful probably 12 years ago offering as a secondary guarantee IAG data, if you remember that company. But IAG did [00:26:00] telephone research on yesterday viewing and whether or not you remembered the ads. So it was ad awareness that was basically a secondary currency. It didn’t affect Nielsen or use of Nielsen at all, or use of Comscore at all.\n\nAnd of course today, realistically, you could say that we have a duopoly, Comscore and Nielsen, and then there are a number of other secondary currencies that started more on the attribution side. It’s pretty hard to predict the future, you know, it’d be easier if the services were offering exactly the same as Nielsen and nothing but the same as Nielsen, but very often they’re offering additional advertising services, so…\n\nPaul: I don’t know. [chuckles] I wish I did. It’s a different environment in that, and you know, as I mentioned, all the other currencies are currency plus. I think sort of, you know, our grounding thought ought to be the ANAWFA call for what it takes [00:32:00] to do cross-platform. You know, if you look at some of the interviews that came out of com, cross-platform is like the number one issue on the buy side’s mind.\n\nBuy side spends as much money with Google and Facebook as they do with television or almost as much. So television is the 70 billion dollar enterprise. Google and Facebook combined are probably close to 70 billion dollars. There’s no integration of data of what people are exposed to on Facebook, Google, and traditional television, and the winner in all of this will be someone who really gets cross-platform correct. I think that’s where it’s going.\n\nIt doesn’t mean that if you’ve got 30 million set top box Invisio households that you’re not gonna make, I don’t know if there’s gonna be nine multiple currencies or eight multiple currencies, but I think as long as you’ve got something differentiating, like attribution and something like that, that there will be additional… and I don’t know if currency is the right word.[00:33:00]\n\nIAG wasn’t a currency, but IAG people made guarantees based on IAG. So it was currency like. And I think that’s where the two or three, you know, additional currencies will make it. And I think, you know, Comscore, Nielsen, whoever gets cross-platform right, is gonna have a huge advantage.\n\n[music]\n\nPaul: Well, you know, Nielsen has always been called a fast follower. They weren’t the first with people meters. But they were fast followers with people meters. They certainly weren’t the first with big data. They’re trying to follow fast right now. The other thing is that a lot of, you know, the MVPD had a rate card that had [00:34:00] two prices.\n\nThere was the Nielsen price and there was everybody else’s price, and they knew that everybody else couldn’t afford a 10th of what Nielsen might be able to afford. I was working with big data 10 years ago. We had direct– I forget who the director of DISH data was 10 years ago, and it never made it into the currency. I don’t know why.\n\nYou know, I mean, well, I left Nielsen five years ago, but obviously Big Data is part of their plans right now. They are, I guess they are, they just published for, not for currency, but for evaluation, not for transaction, their first big data and obviously have plans of integrating it as part of the currency, and that’s what the WFA plan calls for.\n\nA bonafide panel, which Nielsen has probably the highest quality panel out there. And then big data. And big data is biased. Use the panel to correct for biases in big data. Panels don’t have the sa– it’s not possible to have the sample size capable of [00:35:00] dealing with today’s fragmentation, but that’s where you use big data, so…\n\nYou tamp down the variants with big data. You correct for biases with panels. The reason we need a panel is there’s a pretty big debate over whether set top box data or ACR data is like Vizio data. It’s smart TV data, automatic content recognition, so Vizio knows, you know, what stations you’re tuned to, what networks you’re tuned to.\n\nThere’s a big debate over which one is more accurate. There are limitations to both with respect to set top box data. You know, if you have a Frontier, if you have Comcast, it’s a limited geographic footprint and therefore you’re– it comes with the biases associated with a limited geography and all the demographics and consumer trends that go with that.\n\nAlso, set top box data. Typically, it’s not uncommon for the set top box to be on but the TV set is off. I’ve heard people who are using it say that they wind up [00:36:00] tossing 50% of the tuning minutes because if there’s been no channel change or no activity coming across for over two hours, they’re assuming that the set top box is on, but the TV set is off.\n\nACR Vizio data as an example. And there’s some others. I think LG is about to provide its data to some of the new currencies. Is also limited in that Samsung is the largest OEM. I don’t believe Samsung shares its data. 30% of the TV sets out there are Samsung. Samsung has its own ED network. About 15% of the TVs out there are Vizio.\n\nVizio is a less expensive television and therefore has biases associated with the demographics. And that’s also a smart TV, which means when you turn the TV set on, you also have Netflix icons on your screen and Amazon Prime icons on your screen. And therefore, you know, how do you measure? How viewing on [00:37:00] that television is different from, you know, an eight year old Sony TV, which is not a smart TV, and that’s where a panel is necessary.\n\nWhat big data does bring is stability. In that once you have millions of households and the typical new currency has anywhere from about 10 to about 30 million. I think Comscore actually has the most, they have about 35 million households, which started with Rentrak.\n\nAnd all the others are kind of catching up. Almost everybody has Vizio through Inscape, which is a business that Vizio set up to basically sell its data, to process and sell its data. So most of those companies have about 20 million households. I think it’s kind of funny when people talk about Nielsen’s response rate of 30%, and you know, 30% is not where it used to be.\n\nYou know, it used to be in the forties, but if you have 20 million households, you’re dealing with de facto of 15% response rate. And so, [00:38:00] there needs to be mechanisms for correcting biases and panels, and there needs to be mechanisms for correcting biases and big data sets.\n\n[music]"
