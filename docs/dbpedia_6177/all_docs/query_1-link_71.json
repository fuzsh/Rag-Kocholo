        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Rentrak Corporation (NASDAQ: RENT), the leader in multi-screen media measurement serving the advertising, television and entertainment industries, released both the Hispanic Programming Stickiness Index and Social Media Index for the week ending September 16, 2012.\n\n\"Rentrak and Trendrr.TV partnered on this project to better serve the Hispanic television media landscape. As the Hispanic population continues its double-digit growth, the television industry has responded by launching more and more networks and programming targeted to this key demographic. Advertisers and agencies want to better understand TV viewing engagement and Rentrak and Trendrr.TV are serving that need,\" said Bruce Goerlich, Chief Research Officer at Rentrak.\n\n\"The Hispanic marketplace has embraced simultaneous and complementary experiences as their attention across different devices and services increases exponentially. Understanding how programing is resonating and identifying ways that new user behaviors inform and grow their business is why are excited to partner with Rentrak on the Stickiness Index,\" said Trendrr CEO and Founder, Mark Ghuneim.\n\nThe Stickiness Index lists the top-30 primetime programs based on level of viewer engagement as determined by how much the average percentage viewed of the program varies from an average of all programs of the same duration during Monday-Saturday primetime (8pm-11pm) and Sunday primetime (7pm-11pm). The Social Media Index combines Rentrak's leading TV Essentials system with Trendrr.TV's social response analytics to show how Hispanic television programming triggers reactions through social media, which can affect audience visibility and engagement.\n\nPrograms with the most engaged viewers will have a higher Stickiness Index rating number, indicating that more of the audience is tuned-in for the duration of the program. Similarly, programs that generate the most social media comments will have a higher Social Media Index rating. The Social Media Index covers a range from 0 to many thousands; its value indicates the amount of social media \"chatter\" that a given TV show is generating among all the shows that were discussed via social media. An index of 100 means that the show is generating an average amount of discussion, and because the amount of social media discussion varies widely, the Social Media Index ranking numbers can go up to many thousands.\n\nWeek of 9/10/12 to 9/16/12 – Combined Hispanic Broadcast and Cable:\n\nIndex Rank\n\nRating Rank\n\nSeries\n\nNetwork\n\nStickiness Index*\n\nTrendrr.TV\n\nIndex**\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAbismo de pasion\n\nUNIV\n\n148\n\n24,198\n\n2\n\n7\n\nFutbol Mexicano: Leon vs. Guadalajara\n\nTELMUN\n\n148\n\n744\n\n3\n\n5\n\nAmor bravio\n\nUNIV\n\n143\n\n7,508\n\n4\n\n2\n\nCopa Mundial - Eliminatorias - Multiple\n\nUNIV\n\n136\n\n37,239\n\n5\n\n4\n\nPor ella soy Eva\n\nUNIV\n\n136\n\n18,965\n\n6\n\n3\n\nMira quien baila!\n\nUNIV\n\n132\n\n94,880\n\n7\n\n11\n\nCorazon Valiente\n\nTELMUN\n\n123\n\n18,876\n\n8\n\n8\n\nAqui y ahora\n\nUNIV\n\n118\n\n2,152\n\n9\n\n6\n\nSal y pimienta\n\nUNIV\n\n118\n\n3,733\n\n10\n\n254\n\nBananas in Pajamas\n\nDFAM\n\n116\n\nN/A\n\n11\n\n239\n\nMecanimales\n\nDFAM\n\n116\n\nN/A\n\n12\n\n248\n\nJustin Time\n\nDFAM\n\n115\n\nN/A\n\n13\n\n251\n\nFishtronaut\n\nDFAM\n\n115\n\nN/A\n\n14\n\n241\n\nHi-5\n\nDFAM\n\n114\n\nN/A\n\n15\n\n10\n\nSabado gigante\n\nUNIV\n\n112\n\n13,683\n\n16\n\n329\n\nVida Nueva para el Mundo\n\nENLACE\n\n111\n\nN/A\n\n17\n\n42\n\nEl justiciero\n\nTELF\n\n110\n\nN/A\n\n18\n\n238\n\nMister Maker\n\nDFAM\n\n110\n\nN/A\n\n19\n\n9\n\nPablo Escobar: El patron del mal\n\nTELMUN\n\n104\n\n27,818\n\n20\n\n20\n\nCrimenes de pelicula\n\nDSC\n\n101\n\nN/A\n\n21\n\n64\n\nLa Isla\n\nAZA\n\n101\n\nN/A\n\n22\n\n13\n\nEl rostro de la venganza\n\nTELMUN\n\n100\n\n2,493\n\n23\n\n19\n\nCon quien me case?\n\nDSC-ES\n\n100\n\nN/A\n\n24\n\n322\n\nSenora del destino\n\nPSNES\n\n99\n\nN/A\n\n25\n\n180\n\nNinera S.O.S.\n\nDFAM\n\n99\n\nN/A\n\n26\n\n23\n\nScorned: Love Kills\n\nDSC-ES\n\n99\n\nN/A\n\n27\n\n210\n\nIsabel\n\nTVE\n\n98\n\nN/A\n\n28\n\n18\n\nPecados mortales\n\nDSC-ES\n\n98\n\nN/A\n\n29\n\n22\n\nEl tesoro de Osama bin Laden\n\nDSC-ES\n\n97\n\nN/A\n\n30\n\n54\n\nExtranormal de impacto\n\nAZA\n\n97\n\nN/A\n\n[Azteca America is owned by TV Azteca; Discovery Channel en Espanol and Discovery Familia are owned by Discovery Communications, LLC; Enlace is owned and operated by TBN; Pasiones is owned by Imagina U.S.A.; TeleFutura and Univision are owned by Univision Communications, Inc.; Telemundo is owned by NBC Universal; TVE Internacional is a unit owned by Corporacion de Radio y Television Espanola, S.A.]\n\n*Stickiness Index powered by Rentrak TV Essentials (www.rentrak.com)\n\n**Hispanic Social Media powered by Trendrr.TV (http://trendrr.tv)\n\n© Rentrak Corporation 2012 - Content in this chart is produced and/or compiled by Rentrak Corporation and its TV Essentials data collection and analytical service, and is covered by provisions of the Copyright Act.
