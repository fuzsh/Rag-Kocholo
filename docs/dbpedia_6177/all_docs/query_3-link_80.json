        "text": "Judge: Surveillance OK\n\nThe heated debate over the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of millions of Americans’ telephone records fell squarely into the courts yesterday when a federal judge in Manhattan upheld the legality of the program and cited its need in the fight against terrorism just days after another federal judge concluded it was likely not constitutional.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III and an opposing view earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., sets the stage for federal appeals courts to confront the delicate balance when the need to protect national security clashes with civil rights established in the Constitution.\n\nPauley concluded the program was a necessary extension of steps taken after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n1.3M losing unemployment today\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million Americans are bracing for a harrowing, post-Christmas jolt as extended federal unemployment benefits expire today, with potentially significant implications for the recovering U.S. economy. A tense political battle likely looms when Congress reconvenes in the new, midterm election year.\n\nNudging Congress along, a vacationing President Barack Obama called two senators proposing an extension to offer his support. From Hawaii, Obama pledged yesterday to push Congress to move quickly next year to address the “urgent economic priority,” the White House said.\n\nHollywood 2013: Top box-office year\n\nDespite a string of summertime flops, Hollywood is expected to have a banner year at the domestic box office, coming in just shy of $11 billion, the largest annual take ever. But because of higher ticket prices, actual attendance at North American theaters remained flat after a decade of decline.\n\nWith the current domestic box office tally nearly 1 percent ahead of last year at this time, 2013 could surpass 2012’s overall haul of $10.8 billion by more than $100 million, according to box office tracker Rentrak.\n\nFirst Night Boston now has an app\n\nFirst Night Boston will have an app ­— available for download now — with schedules, maps and event information, the mayor’s office said yesterday.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have this useful tool available for visitors to this year’s First Night,” said Mayor Thomas M. Menino in a statement. The app was made by Boston company Sparkline Digital."
