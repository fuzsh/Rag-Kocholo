        "text": "CBS has agreed to use Rentrak audience-measurement services, becoming the first broadcast network to make use of the company’s efforts to marry demographic information with consumer-purchase behavior.\n\nThe agreement also includes CBS Sports Network.\n\n“As more advertisers move beyond age/sex demographics for their media buying, there’s been a shift to combine viewing data with product-purchase data to create comprehensive evaluation tools,” said David F. Poltrack, Chief Research Officer, CBS Corporation, in a prepared statement. “Rentrak’s analytical solutions provide a single-source framework that will lead to more effective use of the television medium and, more importantly, to the documentation of that effectiveness. Working with Rentrak, our goal is to advance this transition to a new era in television advertising execution.”\n\nThe pact is announced as both TV networks and advertisers are starting to think more seriously about TV’s annual upfront market, when marketers purchase the bulk of T. Ad time for the coming season.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMore advertisers have sought information about audiences for TV programs that go beyond simple measures of quantity, age and gender. A number of companies have formed in recent years offering to connect TV viewing to data about purchasing behavior."
