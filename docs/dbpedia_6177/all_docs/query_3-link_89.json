        "text": "Ben Affleck -- who portrays Batman in Warner Bros.' current superhero release Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and will reprise the role in Suicide Squad later this year, as well as in next year's Justice League: Part 1 movie -- has moved into the role of executive producer of the Justice League project. Affleck will also assist screenwriter Chris Terrio in rewrites to the Justice League script, partly to help better align the Justice League film with Affleck's solo Batman project -- which I hear is tentatively expected to release in 2018, and which Affleck cowrote with DC Comics Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns. Johns has had a significant role in the development of not only DC Comics' monthly comic releases, but also the planning for Warner's DC cinematic universe, and that includes a role with Justice League as well.\n\nPart of Ben Affleck's work on the Justice League film will include participating in the post production phase with director Zack Snyder and the film's editing team. Affleck is an important creative voice and talent at Warner, with films including The Town, Argo, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, Live By Night, The Accountant, Justice League: Part 1, and the solo Batman film constituting an impressive list of collaborations between the studio and the filmmaker. He won the Academy Award for Best Picture with Argo -- a film that also brought an Oscar to Chris Terrio for his adapted screenplay.\n\nDespite some of reactionary media reports, Ben Affleck is not taking the Justice League film away from director Zack Snyder, whom Affleck praised repeatedly for his work on Batman v Superman. The need to coordinate the slate of upcoming DCU films, and the fast-tracking of the Batman film project, make Affleck's expanded involvement in the Justice League production a necessity at this point.\n\nWhile Affleck is expected to direct the solo Batman movie, those details haven't been finalized yet, so it's hypothetically possible someone else could sit in the director's chair for that project while Affleck serves as lead actor, cowriter, and (likely) producer to help oversee the project with another director. I still fully expect Affleck will indeed wear his director's hat when the Batman movie starts production, but if he doesn't then there are a few names who could show up on the short list as alternates -- but I'll talk more about that scenario and the possible names if and when I can nail down information one way or the other (meaning if things develop suggesting Affleck really might not helm the Batman solo film himself).\n\nThe last few days and weeks have been filled with lots of gossip about the future of the DCU, including the announcement Seth Graham-Smith stepped aside from his directing duties on the Flash movie, and rumors James Wan was feeling trepidation about directing the Aquaman movie. Wan subsequently seemed to put those rumors to rest by tweeting out a picture of himself in front of a giant Aquaman mural, and via press interviews in which he discussed his plans for the aquatic superhero adaptation.\n\nLikewise, repeated rumors and claims among some press that Warner was on the verge of replacing Snyder as director of Justice League were nonsense. So, too, were rumors of trouble with Suicide Squad and vast, expensive reshoots -- the film did indeed have some typical reshoots and pickups recently (as do most films of this sort several months prior to their release), but they weren't the \"tens of millions of dollars\" in filming to remake large portions of the film as so many fan sites claimed. Once a film is finished with shooting, there are often problems with scenes due to sound, lighting, continuity, or other reasons that require doing some additional shots. There can also be a need for extra footage needed due to edits of other scenes, or to clarify something in a different scene, or because some actors weren't on set for certain sequences and need to shoot their additional footage.\n\nBatman v Superman took $864 million to date at worldwide box office, and should wind up with about $870+ million by the time it leaves theaters. While that figure is lower than the $1+ billion range many hoped for/expected, it is still a huge number and makes it the seventh-highest grossing superhero movie of all time. It sits behind only The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises among Warner Bros.' superhero offerings, with The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, and Spider-Man 3 rounding out the top-six superhero movies higher on the all-time chart. Meaning Batman v Superman may have underperformed, but no it didn't fail, and it sits in very successful company on that list.\n\nSuicide Squad comes almost exactly three months from today, and gives us more of Ben Affleck's Batman as he faces off against the Joker for the first time in live-action cinema since The Dark Knight and Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning final performance as the Clown Prince of Crime. Buzz for Suicide Squad is very strong, and the pairing of Affleck's Batman with Jared Leto's new Joker, coupled with what everyone expects will be a scene-stealing turn by Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, should ensure the film is a hit. It needs to score at least in the $500+ million range to help get public sentiment back into the positive column for the DCU, and I think it'll wind up more in the $700+ million range. Then, Wonder Woman has a chance to further improve the reputation of the DCU in the public and press, when it hits theaters on June 2.\n\nSo by the time Justice League arrives, things should be looking much brighter for Warners' DCU plans. And the eventual announcement of the solo Batman movie's release date -- which I expect we'll hear sometime this summer, or perhaps around the release of Suicide Squad perhaps -- will be another moral booster for fans and everyone at Warner and DC, I'm sure.\n\nToday's news about Ben Affleck taking a more hands-on role in the writing and production of Justice League is good news for the film and for the future of the DCU. As an Oscar-winning screenwriter and producer, and one of the best filmmakers in the business, Affleck is an asset who can only improve the film and increase the chances it hits the sort of box office and critical approval necessary to really ensure the future stability of the DCU.\n\nBox office figures and tallies based on data via Box Office Mojo , Rentrak, and TheNumbers."
