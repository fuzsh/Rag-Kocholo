        "text": "Comscore on Tuesday made several leadership appointments, the first since Jon Carpenter was named CEO in July following the retirement of Bill Livek.\n\nEffective immediately, Dr. David Algranati, currently chief product officer, will assume the role of chief innovation officer. He joined Comscore in 2011 and previously held various roles with Simmons Market Research/Experian. As chief innovation officer, Algranati will lead the company’s efforts to deliver best-in-class cross-platform products across ad measurement, content measurement, and planning solutions to help solve some of the most complex problems for the industry.\n\nGreg Dale has been appointed chief operating officer. Dale, who was part of the Comscore team from 1999 to 2016, recently rejoined Comscore through the 2021 acquisition of the social media measurement company, Shareablee, where he also was chief operating officer.\n\nDuring his prior time with Comscore, he held various leadership roles including chief operating officer, chief technology officer and evp for international sales. Dale also previously held senior leadership roles at Persado and Paragren Technologies. As chief operating officer, he will report to CEO Carpenter and will lead key functions overseeing technology, business and sales operations, along with product execution and delivery across Comscore’s Local and National TV and syndicated digital offerings. As COO, Dale will spearhead Comscore’s efforts to drive focused execution and greater profitability.\n\nJon Lieberman, who also joined Comscore through the Shareablee acquisition, will assume the role of chief technology officer. He has extensive experience starting tech companies as a founder, developer, leader and innovator at companies including Advanced Motion Technologies, OpenSlate, RapidRatings, InfiniteAgent and others. Lieberman will report to Dale and will lead Comscore’s engineering, infrastructure, and development teams.\n\nCarpenter said: “Comscore is highly focused on delivering currency grade solutions across linear and digital platforms while driving profitable growth. The changes we are announcing today are reflective of the way we intend to operate going forward, driving discipline, focus, and innovation so that we can meet — or exceed — our customers’ needs for best-in-class solutions that drive outcomes for our clients.\n\n“David, Greg and Jon have significant experience leading through periods of growth and innovation and have a deep understanding of our industry and the needs of our clients. I am looking forward to working alongside them, and the rest of the leadership team, to deliver success for our employees, customers and shareholders.”\n\nComscore also announced that Chris Wilson, chief commercial officer, will be leaving the company. Carpenter said: “Chris has been a key member of Comscore’s leadership team. During his tenure with Rentrak, and then Comscore, Chris was responsible for many of the partnerships and customer engagements that are core to our success today. I join the board and the rest of Comscore in thanking Chris for all he has done for the company over the past twelve years.”\n\nFollowing Wilson’s departure, Chief Revenue Officer Carol Hinnant will report to Carpenter, along with Tania Yuki, EVP, digital and chief marketing officer."
