        "text": "— Comcast Corp. announced Thursday that it plans to buy a majority stake in NBC Universal for $13.75 billion, giving the nation’s largest cable-TV operator control of the Peacock network, an array of cable channels and a major movie studio.\n\nAlthough the deal could mean that movies could reach cable more quickly after showing in theaters, and that TV shows could appear faster on cell phones and other devices, it was already raising concerns that Comcast would wield too much power over entertainment.\n\nConsumer advocates and even other cable operators worry about the deal, saying people could end up paying more for TV.\n\nIf the deal clears regulatory and other hurdles, Comcast would rival the heft of The Walt Disney Co. - which Comcast CEO Brian Roberts already tried to buy.\n\nPhiladelphia-based Comcast, which serves a quarter of all U.S. households that pay for TV, would gain control of the NBC broadcast network, the Spanish-language Telemundo and about two dozen cable channels, including USA, Bravo and Syfy. It also would have regional sports networks, Universal Pictures and theme parks.\n\n“Does the world ever stand still?” Roberts asked. Bringing NBC Universal into the Comcast family is “pro-consumer” and would allow the company to more quickly deliver “what consumers want, which is access to all different types of content on different platforms and different times.”\n\nIn agreeing to buy 51 percent of NBC Universal from General Electric Co., which has controlled NBC since 1986, Comcast hopes to succeed in marrying distribution and content in a way Time Warner Inc. could not. AOL and Time Warner are undoing their ill-fated marriage Wednesday. Time Warner has already shed its cable TV operations.\n\nShares of Comcast rose 97 cents, or 6.5 percent, to close at $15.91. GE shares fell 7 cents to $16.\n\nThe deal means Universal Pictures movies could get to cable faster and TV shows could appear on mobile phones and other devices faster. Comcast already is letting subscribers watch cable-TV shows online in trials, with a nationwide launch in December.\n\nOn Thursday, Comcast pledged that NBC Universal shows that now cost money over its cable video-on-demand service would be free for three years after the deal closes.\n\nComcast said it would maintain free, over-the-air TV on NBC stations and pledged to improve public-interest programming. It also said it would not let its business interests affect NBC News.\n\nComcast wants the company largely for its cable channels, analysts said. Comcast is seeking more programming to beef up its video-on-demand offerings and rely less on cable revenue as the company loses subscribers to rival providers - such as phone companies that are offering TV services - or the Internet.\n\nNBC Universal is profitable, with operating earnings of $1.7 billion on revenue of $11.2 billion in the first three quarters of 2009, despite weakness in the fourth-place NBC broadcast network and Universal Pictures, ranked sixth in North American box-office gross this year by Rentrak Corp./Hollywood.com.\n\nUnder the deal, expected to close in nine months to a year if regulators and shareholders approve, GE would buy Vivendi SA’s 20 percent stake in NBC Universal for $5.8 billion. Of that, $2 billion is payable in September 2010 if the deal hasn’t closed by then, and the remaining $3.8 billion would be due at closing. Universal is to be separated into a new joint venture.\n\nComcast would buy a 51 percent stake of the new company by paying $6.5 billion in cash and contributing $7.25 billion worth of cable channels it owns, including E!, Style and Golf Channel. GE would retain a 49 percent stake, with the option of unloading half its stake in 3 1 /2 years and all of it after seven years. The new NBC Universal would borrow $9.1 billion that would partially go toward covering the money GE owes Vivendi.\n\nComcast would name three people to the board and GE two, and Comcast would manage the joint venture. Jeff Zucker would remain NBC Universal’s CEO and report to Comcast Chief Operating Officer Steve Burke. NBC Universal’s headquarters are expected to stay in New York.\n\nConsumer groups fear that a Comcast-NBC combination would be so threatening that rivals would strike similar deals just to compete.\n\nAnd if media ownership were further concentrated, consumers would see higher prices and fewer choices, said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, chief executive of the Media Access Project. He warned that online video and other new forms of competition could be squashed “before they can gain a toehold in the market.”\n\nThe Comcast-NBC deal is widely seen as a test of the Obama administration’s resolve to fight media consolidation. Although consumer groups aren’t confident regulators will find a legal means to block the transaction, lawmakers quickly promised hearings.\n\n“When major media companies swell to control both content and distribution, we need to make sure consumers are not left with lesser content and higher rates,” said Sen. Jay Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate committee that oversees commerce.\n\nComcast would likely have to agree to some restrictions, such as treating rival cable, satellite TV and phone companies equally in programming talks instead of favoring its own cable operations.\n\nShareholders haven’t been happy, either, at what they see as a renewed attempt at empire building after Comcast’s failed $54 billion hostile bid for Disney in 2004.\n\n“These kinds of big mergers always have a ‘crapshoot’ element to them,” said Peter Fader, marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “You can never predict with certain success or failure. You can always see it with 20-20 hindsight. This one will be no different.” Information for this article was contributed by Ryan Nakashima and Stephen Manning of The Associated Press."
