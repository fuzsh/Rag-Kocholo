I don’t think you will be able to integrate it properly as a Client Side Web Part in Share Point. Putting Discourse in an iFrame also results in a bad user experience.

Discourse assumes it has full control over the page, and our recommendation is for it to live in a dedicated subdomain, where it can be themed to your company visual identity.

Perhaps I’ve a different use case than the OP; we don’t want to embed Discourse in its entirety into a Community’s Sharepoint CMS, but rather to provide a dynamic activity feed to drive people to engage with one another in Discourse. As such, I’ve been able to embed a list of topics filtered to a tag or category into a Sharepoint site without any dev effort by:

Following the highly configurable embed instructions here

Saving the result as an .aspx page

Uploading the page to the site’s asset library

Going to a modern page and pasting the URL of the uploaded .aspx page into an ‘Embed’ webpart

Would be great to replace that clunky cluster-fudge with a configurable sPFX webpart…
