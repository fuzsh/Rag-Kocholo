project server 2013 automatic read access to everyone

I have Project Server 2013 On Premise in SharePoint permission mode. I want everyone in the company ('Everyone') to have read access to every new project site. I want to be able to do this without having to manually add after the project site is setup.

I know the resources still need to be setup in PWA; I'm OK with that.

I need to know if it is possible to have 'Everyone' have read access to every project site that would be created. All this in SharePoint permission mode.

Thanks for any help!

PWA 2010 Cost Custom Field Not Available for Reporting in Dashboard Designer

Hello

In PWA's Server Settings I have created an

Enterprise Custom field as follows:

Entity: Task

Type: Cost

As this is a cost field no look-up table or formula are assigned.

There are no calculations for Summary or Assignment rows.

Values to display: data.

The field is available in MS Project

Professional project plans for population.

The field has been added in to the OLAP database

(Cube Measures, Assignment cube), however even after a cube rebuild this field is not available to pull in to a PerformancePoint report (Analytic Chart or Grid) using Dashboard Designer.

Could you please offer advice on how this field can be added to reporting in Dashboard Designer or where the set-up of the field should be changed?

Thank you in advance.

sharepoint mode permission for new team members

I have Project Server 2013 On Premise in SharePoint mode of permission. I'm familiar with the classic Project Server mode of permission. In the classic mode, a PM had to build team and publish project for read access AND assign task and publish project for write access.

In the SharePoint permission mode, if a PM wants a new member to have access to project site (assuming the resource is setup, will the build team and assign task take care of it or will the PM have to manually add that person to the corresponding SharePoint group.

Resource Assignment Limitation

Hi,

How many resources can be assigned to a task in MS Project 2013?

Can we assign more than 20 resources to a task? Will that create any problem in MS Project Server 2013?

Top-Level Booking

Hi,

We currently use top-level project bookings only with Enterprise Resources, and not at task-level placing resources against any part of the schedule.

Is there any way of displaying any/total hours booked so far to a project actually within the schedule? i.e via a standard field or a custom field?

We export time booked to top-level to an out of the box project server pivot-table spreadsheet, and the field used for time booked is 'Billable Actual Work'. What feeds into this, or what reverse engineering is required to display this in MS Project?

Using Project Server 2013, with MS Project 2013 Project Professional.

Thanks,

Andrew

Active Directory Username Changes

Our organization will soon need to change some AD usernames because they will be duplicates in a future AD merge with a larger company that acquired our org. My assumption is our 2013 MS Project server will simply update any affected user's AD username through the daily AD sync that occurs, and the time sheets and assignments will not be adversely impacted because the resource names and AD groups will remain as they were. Is this a valid assumption?

Project Server User Security + Custom SSRS Reports Project List Parameter

Hello, below is the issue / challenge scenario:

I'mnt. We have to remove the smaller chunk of queries that are hitting the published database to get the user security permissions. I'm using custom SSRS reports that are pulling data from Reporting database and other custom financial SQL DB's. I need to figure out a solution to get the list of accessible projects for a particluar user using PSI. I did find this technet article that addresses my issue in a way

http : // technet . microsoft . com/en-us/office/ee862408(v=office.14).aspx#pj2007_ta_SecurityInReports_DevelopingThePsiProxiesClassLibrary

the above solution means that I need to change many of my existing report queries (going to published DB)

Is there a simpler way to maintain a table that I can populate with the Project GUID's, name , user id, name using PSI? I can then refer the existing SQL's procs, TVF's to point to this table instaed of going to the published DB (unsupported method)

Any help/ direction is greatly appreciated

thanks,

SG

Versions cannot be accessed at this time, because the server is busy

Project Server 2010 environment:

I'm going to a project site

In Project Documents (where minor version control is turned on), I have a test document called "My Document Name"

That document's Version History shows a lot of versions

I want to compare two versions, so I open the document by clicking on the "My Document Name" link

I click on Edit Document

Then I select the Review tab

Then I select Compare->Specific Version

A window opens named "Versions saved for My Document Name.docx"

It looks like this window should be populated with the various versions of the document, just like 'Version History'

If you float the mouse in the window, you will see a busy cursor

After about a minute the busy cursor disappears and this error pops up:

"Versions cannot be accessed at this time, because the server is busy. Please try again later."

Resource Assignments View updates ok but not in the Availability Graph

Can anyone suggest why resource assignment work might be different when comparing the Resource Assignment view versus the Resource Availability Graph/data grid (ie the generic PWA views within Resource Center). After making a change in the project plan and publishing the Resource Assignment view data is correct but the graph is not! Does the graph run eg from the Reporting database and the assignment view from the Published database or should they be drawing on the same datasource?

This seems to be a new problem within the last day..

thanks in advance

Project Details Web Part Unable To Load

We have recently migrated a customer's Project Server 2007 instance to Project Server 2013. While opening some of the projects in PWA to edit the project custom fields, we encountered an error "This Web Part was unable to load.". Further investigation found that it was due to some non-mandatory custom fields having lookup tables and graphical indicators, but were entered as blank. We did not have any problems in Project Server 2007. Is there any solution for this?

The ULS log shows the following error:

Remaining availability colors

In one of the resource availability views there is no colors except the blue color when more than 10 resource are selected

Repro steps:-

1-Go to Project Tab

2-Choose either Build team or Resource plan

If you will choose resource plan then choose Build team after

3-Select more than 12 resources

4-Click on Resource availability

5-New IE window tab will be opened with the default view (Assignment work by resource)

6- As you see here there are 12 resources selected with 12 Colors assigned for each resource

7-Now go to views in Ribbon and change it from Assignment work by resource to Remaining Availability

8-As you see all resource are in blue and the same with bars

9-Now untick two resources from the right side list to decreasing the selected resource to 10 or less

10-Now colors are back to the graph

So why in Remaining availability has a limit of 10 resource selected to show colors ?

When attempting to edit a project in the PWA I receive the error: 'An error occurred while opening your project. Give us a few minutes and try again...' Project Server 2013

Hello,

I am hoping someone can assist with the error we are encountering when trying to edit a project from the PWA in Project Server 2013. I can click on the project name and go to the detail page and I can click and see the schedule. However, if I click on a task in the schedule and attempt to edit it, I receive the following error:

'An error occurred while opening your project. Give us a few minutes and try again. If this happens again, contact your administrator.'

At this point I must click cancel twice to get rid of the error pop-up message. At this point, I am no longer able to look at the schedule of the project either. Can someone assist with this issue?

Thanks
