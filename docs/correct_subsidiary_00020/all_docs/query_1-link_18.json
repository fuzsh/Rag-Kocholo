        "text": "Note: By clicking on the link below you can find the install page for the plugin.\n\nVersion 1.0.0.0\n\nCatenda SharePoint\n\nIf the Catenda SharePoint Application is added to a SharePoint site, files can be published from SharePoint to Catenda and the Catenda document structure can be viewed in SharePoint. When configured, the application can look as follows:\n\nThis article contains information about how this application works\n\nSee here for more information about how this application can be useful.\n\nSee here for how to add the SharePoint application to a site\n\nThis article contains information about the following topics:\n\nSharePoint to Catenda - Catenda Webpart - Authorization\n\nPublishing to Catenda with the list command\n\nWith the list command it is possible to publish one or more files to Catenda.\n\nNote: It is only possible to publish files. Folder structures can be downloaded from SharePoint and uploaded to Catenda via zip upload or Desktop Connector.\n\nFinding the list command\n\nOne file\n\nIf you want to publish a single file to Catenda, the easiest way to do so is by clicking on Publish to Catenda in the hamburger menu of the file.\n\nMultiple files\n\nIf you wish to publish multiple files to Catenda you will have to select the files you wish to publish. After your files in SharePoint, users will be able to see a Publish to Catenda list command.\n\nIf there is not enough space in the command bar you might see the command in the hamburger menu.\n\nNote: Files can only be published from list view as the list command is not available in grid view.\n\nPublishing the file\n\nAfter clicking on Publish to Catenda the following menu will open that can look something like this:\n\nIf you have not given SharePoint access to your Catenda account yet you will see a dialogue in SharePoint that can look something like this:\n\nSee below for how to authorize your account.\n\nSelecting a folder\n\nIf you have granted access to your Catenda account you can select the project, library and the destination folder on Catenda, and publish.\n\nThe view of the folder structure in SharePoint is consistent with the view in Catenda.\n\nIf a document with the same name as your file does not exist yet in the folder you are publishing, it will appear as a new document in Catenda.\n\nIf the file you are publishing has the same name as a document in the folder you are publishing it to, the file will be a new revision to that document.\n\nNote: It is only possible to publish documents and not upload drafts\n\nAfter a file is published, users will be able to move, rename and delete the file.\n\nâ€‹Catenda Access required: Full access, usually given to users like the publisher or an administrator\n\nChanging the file on Catenda does not change anything on SharePoint. Likewise, if the file changes on SharePoint, nothing changes on Catenda.\n\nCatenda Webpart\n\nWith the Catenda webpart you can let users browse the areas that they have read access to in the document section of a Catenda project. If the have write access to any part of the document structure they will also be able to upload files there.\n\nAdding the webpart\n\nEdit an existing or create a new page in SharePoint and edit it.\n\nYou will then be able to and add a Catenda webpart.\n\nIf you have not already authorized your Catenda account you will be asked to authorize it.\n\nRead more about how to authorize your account below.\n\nAfter authorizing your account credentials, click on Open webpart settings or click on the pencil icon to select the Catenda project for which the SharePoint page visitors will be able to see the documents section.\n\nUsing the webpart\n\nThis is what a configured webpart can look like:\n\nEach user has their own access in Catenda so some of your project members might see different folders and documents than others.\n\nIf you do not have access to the configured project you will see the following error.\n\nThe blurred part is the project GUID.\n\nIf there are none, or you do not have access to any documents in the project it will say No Content - folder is empty.\n\nBreadcrumbs\n\nThe path towards the top of the webpart shows you where in the folder structure you are.\n\nYou can also use this to go back to the parent folder.\n\nCreate folder\n\nCreates a folder in the part of the document structure you are in.\n\nCatenda access required: Write access - If you do not have write access you will see this:\n\nUpload file\n\nAfter clicking this a file navigator will open up, and you can select which document(s) you want to upload. After uploading the document you will see it both in Catenda and in the webpart. You will not see the uploaded file in the SharePoint document area this way. Only in Catenda.\n\nCatenda access required: Write access - If you do not have write access you will see this:\n\nYou can drag and drop files from your system onto a destination in the Webpart in order to upload these files to Catenda.\n\nNote: If you drag and drop a folder it will be published as a zip file.\n\nIf you wish to upload a folder structure you will have to download it from SharePoint and upload it to Catenda either via the zip upload or Desktop Connector.\n\nReload\n\nIf someone else has made changes in the Catenda project, it could be that you do not see them yet. In that case it can be a good idea to reload the webpart to get the most up-to-date information.\n\nContent interactions\n\nClicking on a folder will open the folder\n\nClicking on a document will open it directly in Catenda.\n\nAuthorizing your Catenda Account\n\nAn authentication window to authorize your account will pop up. You might have to allow popup windows in your browser for this to work.\n\nIf you are not already logged in, you will be asked to log into Catenda in this window.\n\nIf you do not already have one, you can create a Catenda Account here.\n\nNote: The email address connected to the Catenda account you sign in with has to be the same as the address connected to the SharePoint account you are signed in with.\n\nThe authentication window can look something like this:\n\nBy allowing the app access to your account you will be able to publish documents from SharePoint to any part of your Catenda project(s) that you have write access to in the document section.\n\nIf a webpart has been added to a page on your site you will also be able to see all documents you have read access to in the Catenda project that was configured by the person that added the webpart. With the webpart you will also be able to publish documents from your system to any part of the configured Catenda project that you have write access to in the document section.\n\nNote: Catenda will not have access to your SharePoint documents. If you publish a document to Catenda, Catenda receives it in a one way transaction.\n\nIf you no longer wish to give the app access to your Catenda account, you can always revoke the access on the applications page of your Catenda account."
