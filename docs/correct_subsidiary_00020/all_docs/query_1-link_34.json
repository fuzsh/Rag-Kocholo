Unfortunately, there is NO upload a web part link to be found .\n\nSo the way you get around this is to navigate to Site Collection Settings (or ask your Site Collection Administrator) and Web Part Galleries area.\n\nUpload your web part file and assign the best possible group including a custom group if you wish. Once uploaded, then it becomes available to add your web part in your web page.\n\nHope this post saves you time if you’re faced with this situation!"
