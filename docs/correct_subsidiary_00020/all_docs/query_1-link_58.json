        "text": "The other day ...\n\nI was working on the SharePoint pages after so many years and realised our favorite SP is not the same anymore ! I am not here to point my finger to the fact that how adding your code to a page was so much easier before, just by dropping a content editor web part or the script editor web part (or using Embed code) in edit mode. Both of these are now unavailable in new SharePoint online modern pages.\n\nHowever, I actually feel like the modern pages are filled with way more features and they look super clean in the edit mode as well, even after adding so many webparts . It also supports several 'out of the box/pre-added' webparts for smaller things such as 'youtube-video', 'Spacer', and 'images' etc.\n\nBefore we proceed, please note that you can still add a classic page to your new SharePoint site and still add your code/webpart the way you were doing in some of the older versions ( SP 2010/ 2013). It goes like this :\n\nEnter Sharepoint Classic experience . You can do this from All Site pages > left side navigation (multiple ways)\n\nThen add a webpart page\n\nThen you will have a classic page to edit ( the old way)\n\nNow, coming back to the Modern Page enhancements : -\n\nIf you want to add your own HTML/CSS/JS you will need a place where you can add your own code (obviously!). You can download a compiled version from many sources available in the internet or if you want to compile the project yourself, you will get the source code as well.\n\nBefore you follow the rest of the steps, depending on your organization's policy and site permission you may want to check your Site Owner's control panel - /SitePages/Site-Owners-Control-Panel.aspx , as you won't see the functionality to directly upload any SPFx packages unless you have a superior access.\n\nIf you are not a site collection admin then enable the below two features, which will allow you to upload a new SPFx (SharePoint Framework) package and edit the scripts.\n\nHere are the steps at a high level:\n\nBuild the SPFx solution package.\n\nYou can build the SPFx solution package from https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-script-editor. I downloaded the file directly from here :https://www.sharepointdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pzl-script-editor.sppkg\n\nUpload and deploy the .sppkg file to your site's App catalog.(/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx)\n\nNow you will find the app under 'SharePoint Apps'(_layouts/15/appStore.aspx/)\n\nAll done!\n\nNow simply create a new page or chose from the existing gallery of modern pages. Apply theme if you want to and drop the newly added webparts\n\nEdit the web part to add your code as usual\n\nHappy days again ! ! !"
