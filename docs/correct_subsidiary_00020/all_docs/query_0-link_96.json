        "text": "By João Ferreira May 22, 2016 Development, Office 365, SharePoint 5 Comments\n\nThe SharePoint Framework was announced on 4th of May and it introduced a new model to develop SharePoint webparts that is radically different from its predecessors.\n\nOver the years SharePoint development required a specific environment, with SandBox and Farm webparts is required at least one server with SharePoint and Visual Studio to develop and debug, with the App model introduced in 2013 the SharePoint server is no longer needed but it requires Visual Studio and a Developer site collection hosted on Office 365.\n\nWith the new framework you are absolutely free to choose your environment, the only requirement is a computer able to run the latest web technologies, you can even use Mac OS or a Linux distro.\n\nAt the moment I’m writing this article the SharePoint framework is not publically available. While it’s too soon to put your hands in the code it might worth invest some time to learn the new technologies used by the framework.\n\nThe new api will not replace any of the existent models, all the knowledge that you acquired over the last years will be valid and will help you to make the parallelism between the old and the new model.\n\nIf you are already a Senior SharePoint developer or if you are just a web developer, this are the technologies that you should learn in the next months in order to be prepared to the new framework.\n\nNode.js\n\nNode.js in an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment to develop applications it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. The runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.\n\nOn the other hand, Node.js has npm, the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world you can build your own packages to use in your solution or you can use the ones already available from the community.\n\nIn the SharePoint framework Node.js has the same role that .NET had in the previous development model, and npm is the replacement to the NuGet.\n\nTo learn more about Node.js visit https://nodejs.org/en/\n\nYeoman\n\nYeoman is the template engine in the SharePoint framework and it runs on top of Node.js, the templates used by the framework are downloaded from GitHub, this means that you need also to install Git in your machine.\n\nYeoman is responsible to create the project structure with all the files and folders like visual studio does but using the console.\n\nTo learn more about Yeoman visit http://yeoman.io/\n\nTypeScript\n\nTypeScript is an open source language created and maintained by Microsoft, it is a super set of set of JavaScript that extends the language it’s executed on top of Node.js and it’s suitable for client and server side applications.\n\nIf you are coming from C#, TypeScript is the easiest way to start developing with script languages, all the concepts like classes and objects are available in TypeScript.\n\nIf you are already a web developer the learning curve is smaller, JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, TypeScript converts all the code to native JavaScript but it’s recommended to take a look at the TypeScript documentation to take fully advantage of the technology.\n\nOther JavaScript libraries like jQuery will also work with the SharePoint framework you just need to import them to the project, I’ll cover this topic in a future article.\n\nTo learn more about TypeScript visit https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n\nReact, AngularJS or other framework\n\nAll the above are great frameworks to develop web apps, at the moment I’m writing this the Yeoman generator only includes an empty template and a template that uses React.\n\nReact might be the appropriated choice as it was chosen by Microsoft to develop Delve and the new document library, but if you are familiar with other frameworks go with it there is absolutely no limitation related with the frameworks.\n\nTo learn more about React visit https://facebook.github.io/react/\n\nTo learn more about Angular JS visit https://angularjs.org/\n\nREST api\n\nWith REST api you can perform basic create, read, update, and delete operations by using the Representational State Transfer (REST) interface provided by SharePoint.\n\nThe REST interface exposes all of the SharePoint entities and operations that are available in the other SharePoint client APIs.\n\nOne advantage of using REST is that you don’t have to add references to any SharePoint libraries or client assemblies. Instead, you make HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints to retrieve or update SharePoint entities, such as webs, lists, and list items.\n\nTo learn more about the REST api visit https://msdn.microsoft.com/\n\nGulp\n\nGulp is a task runner to automate processes built on Node.js. It can be used to compile TypeScript or Less files, in the new framework Gulp does the same that MS Build.\n\nGulp is used in the SharePoint framework in a variety of tasks like build the webpart or upload it to the CDN.\n\nI’ll cover this topic in detail in a future article.\n\nTo learn more about Gulp visit http://gulpjs.com/\n\nOffice UI fabric\n\nOffice UI Fabric is the front-end toolkit that makes your app or add-in blend seamlessly into Office.\n\nIncluded are all the web components, styles, icons and fonts used by Microsoft SharePoint and other Office application.\n\nThis is not directly related with the SharePoint framework and it’s not mandatory use it to build your webparts.\n\nIt’s a good starting point to build an application that breaths Microsoft style, out of the box the end user will be familiar with the layout and components of the application.\n\nTo learn more about Office Fabric UI visit http://dev.office.com/fabric\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the first time Microsoft embrace the open source technologies and we no longer need proprietary software to build webparts to SharePoint.\n\nThis might take a few months to land in the new version of SharePoint, it will be first available on Office 365 and later on SharePoint 2016 on prem.\n\nIf you are not a web developer and are not familiar with the web stack you still have a few months to learn the basics before starting building things in the new framework.\n\nIn the meantime, check the table below that makes a parallelism between the new and the old development model.\n\nWeb Stack Microsoft Tools Node.js .Net framework npm NuGet Yeoman Visual Studio Project Gulp.js MSBuild TypeScript C#"
