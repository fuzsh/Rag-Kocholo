        "text": "Software update policies.\n\nYou can create the following types of software update policies:\n\nA policy that distributes all updates for a particular software bulletin.\n\nA policy that distributes only selected updates for a particular software bulletin.\n\nLater you can edit the partially staged policy and select and stage previously non-staged updates.\n\nWhen distributing updates, you should consider the effects it can possibly have on your network environment. Symantec recommends that you distribute new updates to a test environment first.\n\nThe\n\nDistribute Software Updates\n\nwizard lets you create software update policies. If the associated software updates are not yet downloaded, Patch Management Solution creates a download task. When download is completed, the software update policy is distributed to the target computers.\n\nIf you want to install a Service Pack, Symantec recommends that you create a software update policy for this service pack only, without any other bulletins included in it. Also, in the wizard, check the\n\nAllow immediate restart if required\n\nbox.\n\nYou can access the software update policies that you create at\n\nManage > Policies > Software > Patch Management > Software Update Policies\n\n. On a policy page, you can view the details of the policy and change its settings if necessary.\n\nStarting in 8.6 RU3, the\n\nManual Download\n\ncolumn was added to the Software Bulletin details to help identify updates that need to be manually downloaded. These are software updates that cannot be downloaded automatically from the corresponding software vendorsâ€™ web sites.\n\nThe\n\nDistribute Software Updates\n\nwizard also has additional informational fields, that you can also use in the\n\nAdvanced\n\ntab's search filter field:\n\nDownload type\n\nautomatic\n\n- the Patch Management solution can download the file itself\n\nmanual\n\n- no public URL is available for download, customer must download files from a vendor and upload them to the package\n\nStatus of a manually downloaded update\n\navailable\n\n- all required files either already included or are uploaded to the package\n\nmissing\n\n- no required files in the package and need to be added\n\nFor more information, see the following section entitled Install Support Updates that Do Not Have a Download URL.\n\nYou can also access the list of the software update policies at\n\nHome > Patch Management\n\n, in the left pane, under\n\nWindows\n\n, by clicking\n\nWindows Policies\n\n. In the central pane, you can click the policy that you need, and then view or edit its settings on the policy page that opens in the right pane.\n\nSoftware update tasks.\n\nYou can create the following software update tasks and sequence them in a single job with other tasks:\n\nWindows Software Update Assessment\n\ntask\n\nWindows Software Update Installation\n\ntask\n\nYou may want to use the software update tasks instead of software update policies for the following reasons:\n\nYou need to perform management operations before and after the installation of software updates as part of a sequence of events.\n\nYou need to assess and install some particular updates once and as soon as possible on the limited number of target computers that you specify. The tasks come to target client computers faster than a software update policy."
