These Member Agreement Terms & Conditions, as well as all additional policies, terms, and conditions referenced and incorporated throughout, all of which may be amended from time-to-time (collectively, the “Terms”), contain information about the relationship between you and CNH with respect to the Program and apply to you if you enrolled in the Program.\n\nII. GENERAL.\n\nBy enrolling in, or otherwise participating in, the Program, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and unconditionally accept to be bound by the Terms.

Any updates to these Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued membership in the Program constitutes your acceptance to such modifications. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between CNH and each individual who enrolls or otherwise participates in the Program. Accordingly, you expressly represent and warrant that you are eligible for the Program (as described below) and will otherwise comply with these Terms.\n\nIII. ELIGIBILITY.\n\nThe Program is only open in the United States (excluding Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and territories) and Canada. You must be at least 18 years of age to be eligible. You must also have a MyCNHStore.com Account. Program membership is available only to natural persons, Farming Entities and Construction Entities.

MEMBERSHIP.\n\na. General.\n\ni. Eligible customers who enroll in the Program (referred to herein as “Member(s)” or “Parts Perks Members”) will each be assigned a unique rewards identifier (“Parts Perks Identification Number”) which will be associated with such Member’s membership account (“Parts Perks Account”).\n\nii. Each Member may only have one Parts Perks Account, which may be associated with only one phone number and one email address. Should CNH determine, in its sole discretion, that a Member has created multiple Parts Perks Accounts, CNH may consolidate, deactivate, close, and/or terminate a Member’s Parts Perks Account(s) without notice.\n\niii. Your membership is nontransferable.\n\niv. No purchase is required to become a Member.\n\nb. Enrollment.\n\ni. Enrollment Channels. Eligible customers may enroll in the Program through MyCNHStore.com.\n\nii. Enrollment Process.

You will also be requested and/or required to create a password upon enrollment, and if you belong to a Farming Entity or Construction Entity, provide certain information, including without limitation, the business name, country, business address, and postal code. Failure to provide valid/accurate information may be determined to be a violation of these Terms and subject to termination, closure, and/or deactivation (as set forth below).\n\niii. Parts Perks Identification Number. Upon enrollment into the Program, you will be issued a Parts Perks Identification Number, which will be the Member’s phone number.\n\nV. PROGRAM FEATURES & BENEFITS.\n\na. Offers and Limited Time Promotions. Members will receive several special offers throughout a twelve (12)-month period. Offers may include, but are not limited to, percent-off and dollar-off coupons.

PARTS PERKS ACCOUNT CLOSURE.\n\nCNH may, in its sole discretion, terminate, close, and/or deactivate any Parts Perks Account(s) that it deems, in its sole discretion, is inactive. Inactive Parts Perks Accounts may include, without limitation, any Parts Perks Account(s) that have not been used to purchase parts, components or services at an authorized dealership within the preceding twelve (12) consecutive months. Members who independently desire to close their Parts Perks Account may do so by unchecking the checkbox located in the My Parts Perks section under Account Summary within your MyCNHStore.com Account (Login to your MyCNHStore.com Account  Account Summary  My Parts Perks  Uncheck the Terms & Conditions checkbox).\n\nIn addition, CNH may terminate, close, and/or deactivate any Parts Perks Account without notice if, in CNH sole discretion, a Member becomes ineligible at any time and/or if any of these Terms are violated, including, without limitation, if the Parts Perks Account appears to be used for a commercial purpose such as re-sale, the information associated with a Parts Perks Account is invalid/inaccurate (e.g., false name, invalid/inaccurate phone number, email address), and/or if the Parts Perks Account is otherwise associated with abusive or fraudulent activity.\n\nIX. ADDITIONAL TERMS.\n\na. License. Subject to these Terms, CNH hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) for so long as you participate in the Program and adhere to these Terms, to access, participate in and use the Program services. You agree that you obtain no rights other than the rights and licenses expressly granted herein.\n\nb. Entire Agreement. You agree to comply with terms and conditions of this Membership Agreement, as well as the terms and conditions of the following (all of which are referred to as “Terms” in Section II of these Membership Agreement Terms & Conditions): (i) CNH Privacy Notice (referenced below); (ii) CNH Legal Notices available at Legal Notices on CNHiStore.com; and (iii) any and all other policies and rules as set forth in Program materials, either in print or on the Program web site. New Terms may be added and/or existing Terms may be amended from time-to-time. The Terms, as so amended, will be posted on the Program web site, and your continued participation in the Program thereafter will constitute acceptance of all such updated terms.\n\nc. Privacy Notice. By enrolling or otherwise participating in the Program, you acknowledge, consent and agree to the collection, use and processing of all personal information collected, used and processed as a member of the Program by CNH and CNH’s affiliates as well as third parties to carry out the Program on CNH or it’s affiliate’s behalf and as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Notice.\n\nd. Trademarks. “CNH Industrial”, as well as related product and service names, design marks and slogans, are registered trademarks of CNH or its affiliates.\n\ne. ARBITRATION. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED IN THIS PROVISION, OR OTHERWISE FALL UNDER AN EXCEPTION AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOU. THIS SECTION PROVIDES THAT PARTS PERKS DISPUTES MAY BE RESOLVED BY EITHER YOU OR CNH THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, HAVE A JURY TRIAL OR INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. IN ARBITRATION, DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES CAN BE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (FAA), AND SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN THE BROADEST WAY THE LAW WILL ALLOW.\n\nAs used in this arbitration provision, a \"Parts Perks Dispute\" means any claim or controversy between us that in any way arises from or relates to a Member’s participation in the Program, including, without limitation, the receipt of any offer or other Program benefit(s). Parts Perks Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that a Member may assert claims in small claims court if the Member’s claims qualify. In addition, CNH and Members each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement to arbitrate Parts Perks Disputes. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. The scope of discovery is usually more limited in arbitration than in court. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms.\n\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to CNH Legal Department, located at: Legal Department, 700 State Street, Racine WI 53404 or we must send a written notice to you at the most current address we have on file for you. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. A Member may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\n\nCNH and Member each agree that any Parts Perks Dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. CNH and Member each hereby waive the right to participate in any class action, whether in court or arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, CNH and Member each waive any right to a jury trial.\n\nThis arbitration provision shall survive changes to these Terms and termination of the Program, Parts Perks Account, and/or the relationship between you and us, including the bankruptcy of any party and any sale of your Parts Perks Account, or amounts owed on your Parts Perks Account, to another person or entity. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the other terms shall remain in force, except that there can be no arbitration of a class or representative claim. This arbitration provision may not be amended, severed or waived, except as provided in these Terms or in a written agreement between you and us.\n\nLast modified: March 20, 2024\n\n1.

CONSUMER DATA REQUESTS\n\nThe CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You may exercise these rights yourself or through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights, please see the Exercising Your CCPA Privacy Rights section.\n\nRight to Know. You have the right to request that Company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months (a “Right to Know” Consumer Request). This includes: (a) the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you; (b) the categories of sources from which that Personal Information came from; (c) our purposes for collecting this Personal Information; (d) the categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Information; and (e) if we have “sold” or “shared” or disclosed your Personal Information, a list of categories of third parties to whom we “sold” or “shared” your Personal Information, and a separate list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed your Personal Information to. You must specifically describe if you are making a Right to Know request or a Data Portability Request. If you would like to make both a Right to Know Consumer Request and a Data Portability Consumer Request you must make both requests clear in your request. If it is not reasonably clear from your request, we will only process your request as a Right to Know request. You may make a Right to Know or a Data Portability Consumer Request a total of two (2) times within a 12-month period at no charge.\n\nAccess to Specific Pieces of Information (Data Portability). You also have the right to request that Company provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from a third party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request). If you make a Data Portability Consumer Request electronically, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily reusable format that allows you to transmit the Personal Information to another third party. You must specifically describe if you are making a Right to Know request or a Data Portability request. If you would like to make both a Right to Know Consumer Request and a Data Portability Consumer Request you must make both requests clear in your request. If it is not reasonably clear from your request, we will only process your request as a Right to Know request. In response to a Data Portability Consumer Request, we will not disclose your driver’s license number or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, or your account password or security question or answers. We will also not provide this information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to your Personal Information, your account with Company, or the security of our systems or networks. We will also not disclose any Personal Information that may be subject to another exception under the CCPA. If we are unable to disclose certain pieces of your Personal Information, we will describe generally the types of personal information that we were unable to disclose and provide you a description of the reason we are unable to disclose it. You may make a Right to Know or a Data Portability Consumer Request a total of two (2) times within a 12-month period at no charge.\n\nCorrection. You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. You may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into the Online Parts Store and visiting your “My Account” page. You may also request that we correct the Personal Information we have about you as described below under the Exercising Your CCPA Privacy Rights section. In some cases, we may require you to provide reasonable documentation to show that the Personal Information we have about you is incorrect and what the correct Personal Information may be. We may also not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect or if the Personal Information is subject to another exception under the CCPA.\n\nDeletion. You have the right to request that Company delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your Consumer Request (see the Exercising Your CCPA Privacy Rights section), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies pursuant to the CCPA. Some exceptions to your right to delete include, but are not limited to, if we are required to retain your Personal Information to complete the transaction or provide you the goods and services for which we collected the Personal Information or otherwise perform under our contract with you, to detect security incidents or protect against other malicious activities, and to comply with legal obligations. We may also retain your Personal Information for other internal and lawful uses that are compatible with the context in which we collected it.\n\nOpt Out of Sell or Sharing. You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information for monetary or valuable consideration, and the right to opt out of the sharing of your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising. For more information, see Section 9 below.\n\nNon-Discrimination. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following as a result of you exercising your CCPA rights: (a) deny you goods or services; (b) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; (c) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or (d) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. We may, however, offer you certain financial incentives as described below.\n\nExercising Your CCPA Privacy Rights\n\nTo exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:\n\nFilling the online form available HERE;\n\nWriting an email to Privacy-NA@cnhind.com; or\n\nCalling us at the following toll-free numbers: 877-422-7344 (preferred contact for Case IH Consumers); 866-639-4563 (preferred contact for New Holland Consumers); 866-542-2736 (preferred contact for Case CE Consumers).\n\nIf you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request.\n\nOnly you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to your Personal Information. To designate an Authorized Agent, see the Authorized Agents section below.\n\nAll Consumer Requests must:\n\nProvide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an Authorized Agent of such a person as described below.\n\nDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\n\nVerifying Your Identity\n\nBefore completing your request to exercise your rights, we will verify that the request came from you by comparing the identifying information provided by you in your request with any Personal Information we maintain about you at that time. For all requests, we will need the Consumer’s (i) name; (ii) email address, and (iii) telephone number.\n\nTo protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information, we may also request additional information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. This information may include all or a portion of your driver’s license or other government-issued identification number. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. You may also be asked to complete and provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the Consumer who is the subject of the request or their Authorized Agent in certain circumstances. We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.\n\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you are making the request as their Authorized Agent. Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.\n\nAuthorized Agents\n\nYou may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CCPA on your behalf by registering your agent with the California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they have the authority to exercise your rights.\n\nResponse Timing and Format\n\nWe will confirm our receipt of your Consumer Request within ten (10) business days of its receipt. We will generally process these requests within forty-five (45) calendar days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional 45 calendar days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\n\nIf you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.\n\nIn response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\n9. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING OUR “SALE” OR “SHARING” OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\n“Sale” of Your Personal Information\n\nIf you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt out of future sales at any time.\n\n“Sharing” of Your Personal Information\n\nIf you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media based on your browsing history with our Online Parts Store (the “right to opt out”). We do not share the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these purposes may opt out of future such sharing at any time.\n\nHow You May Opt-Out of Our Sale or Sharing of Your Personal Information\n\nTo exercise the right to opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration and of “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, you (or your authorized representative) may do so by:\n\nFor the “sale” or “sharing” through the use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies, adjusting your cookie preferences by visiting the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” or “Cookie Settings” links on Company websites, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below.\n\nFor the “sale” or “sharing” through our disclosure of your Personal Information to Company authorized dealers or other third parties, either:\n\nFilling the online form available HERE;\n\nWriting an email to Privacy-NA@cnhind.com; or\n\nCalling us at the following toll-free numbers: 877-422-7344 (preferred contact for Case IH Consumers); 866-639-4563 (preferred contact for New Holland Consumers); 866-542-2736 (preferred contact for Case CE Consumers).\n\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time by (a) adjusting the settings through the same links for the the “sale” or “sharing” through the use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies, or (b) providing the Company with your consent.\n\nYou do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.\n\nIf you (or your Authorized Agent) submit a request to opt-in to our “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, we will use a two-step process in order to confirm that you want to opt-in for such “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. This process may require confirmation of your choices.\n\nBrowser Privacy Control Signals\n\nYou may also exercise your right to opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration and “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising by setting the privacy control signal on your browser, if your browser supports it. We currently recognize and support the following privacy signals sent by browsers:\n\nGlobal privacy control (for more information on how to configure your browser to send this signal, please see https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).\n\nWhen we receive one of these privacy control signals, we will opt you out of any further “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information when you interact with our Online Parts Store through that browser and on that device. We will only be able to propagate your choice to opt out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be opted out of “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged in, and for both online and offline “sales” and “sharing.”\n\n10.
