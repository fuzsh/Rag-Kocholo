You can set the correct permissions using the SharePoint Management Shell:\n\n$WebApp = Get-SPWebApplication «https://MySite.domain.com»\n\n$WebApp.GrantAccessToProcessIdentity(«domain\\PortalUser»)\n\nWhere «https:/MySite.domain.com» is the MySite Host and «domain\\PortalUser» is the service account of Web Application which is hosting the site from which you try to upload the picture."
