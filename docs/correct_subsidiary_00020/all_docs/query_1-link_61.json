        "text": "END-USER netDocShare LICENSE AGREEMENT\n\nThis is a Legally binding agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and KLoBot, Inc. (“KLoBot”) for the “netDocShare” Software and associated media and printed materials, and many include online or electronic documentation for netDocShare Software Product or netDocShare Software (collectively “netDocShare”). By installing, copying or otherwise using netDocShare, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement, including netDocShare license and disclaimer of netDocShare software warranty below. Please read this document carefully before using netDocShare. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this agreement you should not install or use netDocShare.\n\n1. GRANT OF LICENSE; netDocShare USE RESTRICTIONS.\n\nIn consideration for your payment of any applicable license fee for netDocShare, KLoBot hereby grants to you a personal, non-transferable (except as expressly provided in Section 4 below) and non-exclusive right to use and execute netDocShare on a single Microsoft Office 365 SharePoint Online Tenant or Microsoft SharePoint on-premises farm (collectively “tenant”), without right to sublicense netDocShare. Under no circumstance may you store, use or allow the use of netDocShare in any manner on more than one tenant at a time. You agree that you will not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of netDocShare. If you dispose of any media or apparatus containing netDocShare, you will ensure that you have completely erased or otherwise destroyed any netDocShare contained on such media or stored in such apparatus. Except as expressly provided in Section 4 below, you may not distribute, lease, transfer for profit, loan or otherwise convey netDocShare or any portion thereof to anyone.\n\n2. COPYING RESTRICTIONS.\n\nIn order to effect your license rights hereunder, you may install netDocShare by copying it onto the tenant for use thereon, and you may make full or partial copies of netDocShare, but only as necessary for backup or archival purposes. You agree that\n\n(i) your use and possession of such copies shall be solely under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and\n\n(ii) you shall place the same proprietary and copyright notices and legends on all such copies as included by KLoBot on the authorized copy of netDocShare that you downloaded from the netDocShare web site.\n\n3. OWNERSHIP OF netDocShare AND MEDIA.\n\nYou agree and acknowledge that KLoBot transfers no ownership interest in netDocShare, in the intellectual property in any netDocShare or in any netDocShare copy, to you under this Agreement or otherwise, and that KLoBot and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted to you hereunder. After you pay any applicable license fees and/or the purchase price of the applicable KLoBot, you will own the media on which netDocShare was originally provided to you hereunder and on which you subsequently copy netDocShare, but KLoBot and its licensors shall retain ownership of all netDocShare and copies of netDocShare or portions thereof embodied in or on such media.\n\n4. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.\n\nIf you transfer ownership of netDocShare you may transfer netDocShare and all licenses and rights in netDocShare granted to you under this Agreement to the transferee provided that:\n\n(i) such transferee agrees in writing to accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and\n\n(ii) you also transfer all netDocShare, including all copies thereof, to such transferee. Except as provided in this Section, you may not sublicense, transfer or assign this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations under this agreement, in whole or in part.\n\n5. U.S. GOVERNMENT USERS.\n\nIf netDocShare is acquired by or on behalf of an entity of government of the United States of America, the following provision applies: U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND. Use, duplication or disclosure of SOFTWARE by the Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in FAR 52.227.19( c)(2) or subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer SOFTWARE clause at DFARS 252.227.7013 and/or in similar or successor clauses in the FAR or the DOD or NASA FAR Supplement. Unpublished rights reserved under the Copyright Laws of the United States. Contractor/manufacturer is KLoBot, Inc.\n\n6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.\n\nThe software is exported from the United States in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. Diversion contrary to U.S. law is prohibited. You agree that you will not:\n\n(i) export or re-export the software, directly or indirectly, to Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba or North Korea; or\n\n(ii) release the software to a person on the denied persons list, unverified list, entity list, specially designated nationals list, debarred list or nonproliferation sanctions list (see http://www.bis.doc.gov/complianceandenforcement/liststocheck.htm ). The foregoing obligations will apply to you unless the Office of Export Licensing of the U.S. Department of Commerce has granted authorization to you in writing for the export or re-export of the software. Your obligations under this section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\n7. ENFORCEMENT OF TERMS; TERMINATION.\n\nIf you fail to fulfill any of your material obligations under this Agreement, KLoBot and/or its licensors may pursue all available legal remedies to enforce this Agreement, and KLoBot may, at any time after your default of this Agreement, terminate this Agreement and all licenses and rights granted to you under this Agreement. You agree that KLoBot licensors referenced in netDocShare are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may enforce this Agreement as it relates to their intellectual property. You further agree that, if KLoBot terminates this Agreement for your default, you will, within thirty (30) days after any such termination, deliver to KLoBot or render unusable all netDocShare originally provided to you hereunder and any copies thereof embodied in any medium.\n\n8. DISCLAIMER OF SOFTWARE WARRANTY.\n\nKLoBot PROVIDES netDocShare TO YOU AS IS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY ANY KLoBot EMPLOYEE, REPRESENTATIVE OR DISTRIBUTOR WILL CREATE A WARRANTY FOR THE netDocShare, AND YOU MAY NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.\n\n9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION.\n\nIf any third party brings a suit against you that is based on a claim that netDocShare, solely as furnished to you under this Agreement, constitutes direct infringement of any patent issued by, or copyright registered in, the United states, KLoBot shall defend such suit or proceeding and shall pay any damages and costs finally awarded therein against you with respect to such matter, provided that you promptly inform KLoBot of any such claim, furnish KLoBot with a copy of each communication, notice or other action relating to the alleged infringement and give KLoBot the authority, information and assistance necessary to settle, compromise or litigate such suit or proceeding. Following notice of a claim or a threatened or actual suit, KLoBot may, without obligation to do so, at KLoBot sole option:\n\n(a) procure for you the right to continue to use netDocShare as furnished,\n\n(b) replace or modify netDocShare to make it non-infringing, or\n\n(c) discontinue your license for netDocShare and refund to you any license fee that you paid for it, less a reasonable value for use, determined by prorating such license fee on the basis of a thirty-six (36) month straight line depreciation method, applied to the period of actual use.\n\nKLoBot shall not be obligated to defend or be liable for costs and damages if the infringement or claim thereof arises out of:\n\n(i) use or combination of netDocShare with products or data not provided by KLoBot,\n\n(ii) use of other than the latest unmodified release of netDocShare made available to you by KLoBot if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of such release of netDocShare,\n\n(iii) modification of netDocShare by anyone by KLoBot,\n\n(iv) use of netDocShare after receiving notice, or having reason to believe, that netDocShare infringes a patent or copyright of a third party, or\n\n(v) a claim based on any portion of the Windows(r) software that may be included with netDocShare.\n\nTHE FOREGOING STATES YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND KLoBot ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT OR COPYRIGHT BY netDocShare, AND KLoBot SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.\n\n10. GOVERNING LAW.\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with New Jersey law, excluding its choice of law rules."
