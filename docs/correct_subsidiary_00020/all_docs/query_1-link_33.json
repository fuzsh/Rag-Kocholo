        "text": "There are changes coming with a new version of Stream, which affects how videos are saved and shared.\n\nThe big change is this: Stream as a concept for videos still exists, but how videos are saved is different. Videos for the new Stream need to be saved into SharePoint/OneDrive libraries.\n\nThis post explores the rationale behind the change, and what you need to do migrate to the new experience.\n\nIn terms of naming: the new version is called Stream (on SharePoint). The older version of Microsoft Stream is still available, and will be for the foreseeable future, but it’s now called Stream (Classic).\n\nNote: at the time of this writing, Stream (on SharePoint) and the migration tools are in preview mode, so some capabilities may vary at the general availability release.\n\nWhy are videos changing in Microsoft 365?\n\nStream (Classic) worked well for intranets as you could embed videos on SharePoint pages with the Stream webpart, and they showed up in a Feed webpart as either a single video or multiple videos in a list.\n\nThe major downside with Stream (Classic) is that videos are stored in a specific Stream repository — the files live in a standalone app in the back end of Microsoft 365 (M365). As a result, video files are missing content management features that you expect with a platform like M365. For example, Stream (Classic) videos don’t work with records management capabilities, metadata settings, privacy features, sensitivity labels, etc. As the M365 feature set grows, this becomes a growing compatibility issue with Stream (Classic).\n\nAs a result, Microsoft is re-platforming Stream. This is Microsoft’s vision for the new Stream:\n\n“With video that will be stored in Microsoft 365, the new version of Stream builds on the rich content management features of SharePoint and unlocks the intelligence of Microsoft Graph to enhance videos across Microsoft 365.”\n\nVideos that work with the new Stream need to be saved into SharePoint libraries, and not within the separate Stream app. With this move to storing video files in SharePoint libraries and updating the Stream ‘app’, Microsoft believes it will provide the best of both worlds:\n\nEasy to use and intelligent video experiences powered by Stream across the Microsoft 365 suite\n\nAND\n\nManagement of video that leverages the power of SharePoint content services for permissions, sharing, compliance, governance, and customizable portal experiences.\n\nHow Stream (on SharePoint) works\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how the new version of Stream works:\n\nThe Stream start page\n\nThere is still a Stream “app” or landing page. You access it by going to https://stream.office.com\n\nThis will update the tile in the Apps launcher.\n\nWe recommend that intranet admins use this setting as soon as possible because it will encourage users to start saving videos in SharePoint/OneDrive. People will still be able to get back to Stream (Classic), but the default experience will be the new version of Stream.\n\nThere is no getting around that this is a significant change to how videos are stored in Microsoft 365, and there will be migration work for intranet owners and admins. We don’t expect Stream (Classic) to disappear soon, however the sooner you start getting end-users made aware of the change, the better. We’ll cover migration tips later in this post.\n\nVideo playback features\n\nLet’s get to the most important area – playing videos! There are a few features that help with the experience of watching videos including: adding a custom thumbnail, setting chapters, comments, automatically generated transcripts, and more.\n\nThese settings show up under Video Settings:\n\nTranscripts can also be generated automatically for Stream videos. Transcripts are helpful for productivity by making it easy to scan and find the most relevant content. And, by clicking on the text in the transcript, you can quickly jump to respective points in the video. Transcripts also assist in search because searching in Microsoft 365 finds videos not only based on title and description, but also on the text in the transcript. Transcripts and captions can take a few minutes or hours to display depending on the length of a video, but it’s helpful to have those enabled for accessibility and clarity.\n\nFinally, the last feature we’ll highlight related to video playback is comments. You can add comments to videos just like you would in an Office document. Microsoft is also working on time-synced comments and @mentions, so you can easily draw someone’s attention to a specific part of a video without them having to scrub through for what they need.\n\nAdding videos to SharePoint pages\n\nWith the new Stream, you can still easily feature videos on SharePoint pages including your employee portal homepage, team sites, etc.\n\nFeaturing one video\n\nHighlighting one video that plays in context on the page is very straightforward using the File Viewer webpart. If you want to feature a single video on a page or part of a page, add the file viewer webpart and link to a video that you’ve uploaded to a SharePoint/OneDrive library. It displays like this:\n\nThis takes a user away from the context of the SharePoint page, and they need to navigate back to the page they came from to get back to the task at hand.\n\nFor most intranet scenarios where you want to show multiple videos, we recommend using the Hero webpart.\n\nThe Hero webpart specifically is being updated (Feature ID: 93351) to play videos in context with changes rolling out now. This feature allows users to watch a video without being taken off the SharePoint page and allows users to browse or scroll through the other contents of the page while the video plays.\n\nA feature that is missing from the SharePoint webparts that display videos are the Views and Likes on a video. Stream (Classic) displays these items under the video metadata as so:\n\nFor now, to access this new page, you need to append /_Layouts/15/Video_Collections.aspx to the site URL. You can then edit and publish this page as you would any other. It will also be available to add as a tab using the SharePoint or Pages app in Teams when you click the \"+\" add a tab button (Roadmap ID: 93352).\n\nTop-down video landing page\n\nStream (Classic) could function as a video portal for organizations as it was a landing page for people to discover videos. The new Stream (on SharePoint) landing page is more personalized, so it takes configuration to create a top-down curated experience.\n\nThe updated SharePoint webparts and modern sites and pages support creating an internal video portal for most scenarios. It just takes a little bit of information architecture planning and webpart configuration to figure out how you want to display videos in ‘channels.’\n\nWe recommend managing ‘channels’ as sites – for example, put all the executive videos in the “My Company” site, training videos in the “Learning” site, and topics such as safety and operations in their respective sites. With this structure, you can then use the Highlighted Content webpart configured to the different sites to rollup videos.\n\nThere is no getting around it: organizations will need to plan for someone to go through the Stream (Classic) videos and decide which videos to migrate, and more importantly WHERE to migrate them. There is an inventory report as part of the migration tool to help with this.\n\nThis is a good time to review your SharePoint site information architecture and start assessing how it aligns with video topics/channels you created in Stream (Classic). Do you need a new video portal site? Can you move videos to multiple sites that already exist?\n\nThe next step will be deciding on what webparts to use to display videos. As discussed above, there are more options with SharePoint pages, so start thinking about what you will advise your intranet authors to use.\n\nIn the short term, there is no end date for Stream (Classic), so planning doesn’t need to start immediately. We recommend organizations start planning for video migration in 2023. This is no small task for intranet owners and admins, so if you need help with planning, we have services that can help.\n\nHelpful links\n\nLearn more and keep up to date with the evolving Stream public roadmap with these links:\n\nMigration overview: Overview of migrating from Microsoft Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Microsoft Stream | Microsoft Docs\n\nBuilding blocks for creating a video portal: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/portals-overview\n\nStream public roadmap: https://aka.ms/StreamRoadmap\n\nFor more information on the migration tool see Migrate your videos and Migration tool details."
