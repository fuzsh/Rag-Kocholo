        "text": "In this blog I’m going to show how to quickly create a set of ‘jigsaw’ images to power the SharePoint Hero webpart to provide one image across the banner.\n\nThe new SharePoint page authoring experience that accompanied the arrival of Communication sites recently introduced us the Hero WebPart. This is an awesome flexible control that provides a wow to the homepage of your site and often a top level navigation. The webpart provides 1,2,3,4 or 5 images with titles, call to action and a click to get to any provide link. If these are underlying pages the Hero will extract their primary images. You can read all about how to use Hero in Microsoft’s help here.\n\nSometimes it’s awkward to find enough images to fill the sections, the quality of the layout deserves good high quality graphics. It’s also important to avoid being too literal, picture of a calendar for a calendar, piles of paper for policies and so forth. By taking a single attractive image and slicing it up into the right segments you can creating something compelling while being economic with photography.\n\nA competent graphic designer would be able to create this pretty quickly in Photoshop, but I like to show how you can get close to the same using PowerPoint and standard Office tools.\n\nFirst up you need to have a grid to guide the cutting. I took the relative sizes of each section using developer tools in Edge and drew rectangles of the right proportions in PowerPoint, like this ..\n\nYou can download my template here.\n\nNow, as you might be expecting the Hero webpart adjusts itself to different size screens. For most of it’s range the ratio’s seem to stay the same, but there do seem to be some weird points, on my screen at just under half width the panels become quite portrait, ruining the effect, but by a third of the screen it switches to a carousel.\n\nNow you need to pick your image. Overall the image is always going to be 2.33:1, so you need something that will look good in a wide panorama. Also at smaller sizes the webpart becomes a carousel, so you should make sure the right panel makes a good standalone image. Images of landscapes and cityscapes work well, if there are people you probably want them at the left of the image. Import your image into PowerPoint and send it to the back behind the grid. Adjust it’s size and position to get the best cropping by the frame, try and avoid having the image boarders line up with edges in the image as that reduces the effect of the overall jigsaw. Zoom the page in PowerPoint to fill as much of your screen as possible.\n\nPowerPoint doesn’t have a handy tool to slice images, but we’re going to cheat using the Windows screen clipping tool. Choose a rectangular clip and go from just inside the red lines at the top right or each segment to just inside at the bottom right. Super precision doesn’t seem to be required, just don’t include the red. I produced mine using the touchpad on my laptop just fine. It’s a good idea to use a numbering scheme you’ll remember, otherwise the jigsaw becomes more of a game.\n\nSet your Hero webpart and choose to upload your images for each segment, and your done. Sometimes it’s nice to leave the right panel as just an image, define the link to link back to the page you are on and turn off the text. All in it’s about 10 minutes work, but looks much more!"
