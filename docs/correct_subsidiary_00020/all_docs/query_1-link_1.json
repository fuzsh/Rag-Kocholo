(see image below)\n\nFrom one of the above URLs (insert the proper URL elements in bold in the above URL examples) you can enable items in the webpart gallery for the relevant site by checking off the webparts you want enabled and clicking the ‘Populate Gallery’ button.\n\nAlso, try checking it immediately after performing the above, it sometimes works instantly, otherwise give it a couple of hours (it should not take a whole day - but might) for the classic webparts to appear in the gallery on classic pages.\n\nAlso, I think it would be helpful to other users who may come upon this question if you actually posted with your description as to how you enabled classic site pages on a Modern SP site."
