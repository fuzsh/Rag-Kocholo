No errors.\n\nI then upload the package to my SharePoint sites App Catalog in SharePoint Online (365), successfully, with no errors, then choose deploy, in this case to all sites:\n\nThe app is enabled, valid, deployed and tenant deployed:\n\nThe app does NOT show up in my site contents. The app does NOT show up in \"My apps\" for the site. The app does NOT show up in the WebPart picker of a page. If I create a simple helloworld app scaffolded from yo, it works as expected."
