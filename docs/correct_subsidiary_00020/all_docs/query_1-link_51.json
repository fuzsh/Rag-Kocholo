Putting Discourse in an iFrame also results in a bad user experience.\n\nDiscourse assumes it has full control over the page, and our recommendation is for it to live in a dedicated subdomain, where it can be themed to your company visual identity.\n\nPerhaps I’ve a different use case than the OP; we don’t want to embed Discourse in its entirety into a Community’s Sharepoint CMS, but rather to provide a dynamic activity feed to drive people to engage with one another in Discourse. As such, I’ve been able to embed a list of topics filtered to a tag or category into a Sharepoint site without any dev effort by:\n\nFollowing the highly configurable embed instructions here\n\nSaving the result as an .aspx page\n\nUploading the page to the site’s asset library\n\nGoing to a modern page and pasting the URL of the uploaded .aspx page into an ‘Embed’ webpart\n\nWould be great to replace that clunky cluster-fudge with a configurable sPFX webpart…"
