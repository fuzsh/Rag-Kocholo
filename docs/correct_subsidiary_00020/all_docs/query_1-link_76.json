        "text": "Mermaid is composed of three parts ​\n\nDeployment\n\nSyntax\n\nConfiguration\n\nThis section talks about the different ways to deploy Mermaid.\n\nIf you are a beginner:\n\nCheck out the Diagram Syntax page\n\nCheck out the Tutorials page\n\nWays to use Mermaid ​\n\nUsing the Mermaid Live Editor\n\nUsing the Mermaid Chart Editor\n\nUsing Mermaid Plugins and Integrations\n\nCalling the Mermaid JavaScript API\n\nAdding Mermaid as a dependency\n\nTo learn more, visit the Usage page.\n\n1. Using the Mermaid Live Editor ​\n\nAvailable at the Mermaid Live Editor website.\n\nFeatures ​\n\n• Diagram Code ​\n\nIn the Code panel, write or edit Mermaid code, and instantly Preview the rendered result in the diagram panel.\n\nHere is an example of Mermaid code and its rendered result:\n\n• Configurations ​\n\nConfiguration options are available in the Configuration panel. The options are applied to the diagram in the Preview panel.\n\nTo learn more, visit the Configuration Reference page\n\n• Editing History ​\n\nYour code will be autosaved and appear in the Timeline tab of the History section. Edits are saved every minute and only the last 30 edits are viewable.\n\nAlternatively, you can manually save code by clicking on the Save icon from the History section.\n\nINFO\n\nHistory is stored in the browser storage only.\n\n• Saving a diagram ​\n\nThere are multiple ways of saving your diagram from the Actions section:\n\nexport PNG\n\nexport SVG\n\nexport as Markdown\n\n• Editing your diagrams ​\n\nTo edit your diagram, you can copy paste existing Mermaid diagram code into the Code section of the Live Editor.\n\nOr:\n\ncreate a new diagram from scratch\n\nuse a Sample Diagram from the Sample Diagrams section\n\n• Loading from Gists ​\n\nThe Gist you create should have a code.mmd file and optionally a config.json, similar to this example.\n\nOnce you have created a Gist, copy paste the Gist URL into the respective field in the Actions section and click on the Load Gist button.\n\nHere is an example of a Gist being loaded into the Editor:\n\nhttps://mermaid.live/edit?gist=https://gist.github.com/sidharthv96/6268a23e673a533dcb198f241fd7012a\n\nAnd, here is the diagram view from the above example:\n\nhttps://mermaid.live/view?gist=https://gist.github.com/sidharthv96/6268a23e673a533dcb198f241fd7012a\n\n2. Using the Mermaid Chart Editor ​\n\nAvailable at the Mermaid Chart website.\n\nMermaid Chart is a web-based diagram editor that allows you to create and edit diagrams in your browser. It is built by the team behind Mermaid.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nAI diagramming\n\nCollaboration & multi-user editing\n\nStorage\n\nand more\n\nTo learn more, visit the Mermaid Chart page in the Ecosystem section of the documentation.\n\nOr go to the Mermaid Chart website to sign up for a Free account.\n\n3. Using Mermaid Plugins ​\n\nMermaid Plugins ​\n\nYou can generate Mermaid diagrams from within popular applications using plug-ins.\n\nFor a list of Mermaid Plugins and Integrations, visit the Integrations page.\n\nMermaid Chart Plugins ​\n\nMermaid Chart plugins are available for:\n\nChatGPT\n\nJetBrains IDE\n\nMicrosoft PowerPoint\n\nMicrosoft Word\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\nTo learn more, visit the Mermaid Chart Plugins page.\n\nNative Mermaid Support ​\n\nFor apps that support markdown (e.g. GitHub and GitLab), you can add Mermaid diagrams by making a mermaid code block.\n\n4. Calling the Mermaid JavaScript API ​\n\nThis method can be used with any common web server like Apache, IIS, Nginx, and Node Express.\n\nYou will also need a text editing tool like Notepad++ to generate an html file. It is then deployed by a web browser, i.e. Firefox, Chrome, Safari.\n\nINFO\n\nInternet Explorer is not supported.\n\nThe API works by pulling rendering instructions from the source mermaid.js in order to render diagrams on the page.\n\nRequirements for the Mermaid API ​\n\nWhen writing the html file, we give two instructions inside the html code to the web browser:\n\na. The Mermaid code for the diagram we want to create.\n\nb. The importing of the Mermaid library through the mermaid.esm.mjs or mermaid.esm.min.mjs, and the mermaid.initialize() call, which dictates the appearance of diagrams and also starts the rendering process.\n\nExamples ​\n\nThis is an example of an embedded Mermaid diagram definition inside a <pre class=\"mermaid\">:\n\nThis is an example of a Mermaid import and the mermaid.initialize() call.\n\nstartOnLoad is one of the parameters that can be defined by mermaid.initialize()\n\nParameterDescriptionTypeValuesstartOnLoadToggle for Rendering upon loadingBooleantrue, false\n\nIn this example, the mermaidAPI is being called through the CDN:\n\nIn this example, mermaid.js is referenced in src as a separate JavaScript file:\n\n5. Adding Mermaid as a dependency ​\n\nBelow are the steps for adding Mermaid as a dependency:\n\nInstall node v16\n\nInstall yarn using npm with this command:\n\nnpm install -g yarn\n\nAfter yarn installs, enter this command:\n\nyarn add mermaid\n\nTo add Mermaid as a dev dependency, enter this command:\n\nyarn add --dev mermaid"
