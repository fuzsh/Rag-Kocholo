        "text": "We explain two ways to manage user and group permissions in SharePoint Online permissions — ensuring the right people have access to the right things.\n\nSharePoint online permissions are managed through a set of membership groups within some types of sites (owners, members, visitors, etc.).\n\nWe know, and Microsoft also knows, that secure collaboration is crucial when working online. You have a wide array of users with access to site content, and you need to ensure that the intern doesn’t somehow stumble onto the company’s secrets.\n\nWith SharePoint Online, you have broader capabilities to secure collaboration in M365 while giving your users more control.\n\nHere at ShareGate, we enable you to implement SharePoint permissions best practices in one handy multi-tool.\n\nIn this article, we simplify the process of SharePoint permissions management across different types of sites. By the end, you’ll get a clear picture of the flexibility you now have when looking to collaborate securely inside and outside your organization.\n\nWhat are SharePoint permissions?\n\nIn a nutshell, SharePoint lets you grant permissions to users in SharePoint. But another important follow-up question would be, “How much can I play around with these permissions?”\n\nTo answer that question, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with all the permissions available in SharePoint. They include:\n\nTeam permissions: Depending on whether you add a user as an owner or a member of the associated Microsoft 365 group, permissions to the team site are assigned accordingly. When Dave is added as a team member in the group, he’s automatically a ‘member’ of the SharePoint team site rather than an ‘owner’ or ‘visitor.’\n\nCommunication site permissions: Unlike SharePoint team sites, communication sites aren’t part of Microsoft 365 Groups. Owners, members, or visitors added to a SharePoint communication feature are only associated with that particular site. Of course, different SharePoint permission levels can be granted (as an owner, member, visitor, or custom SharePoint group) to a single user, security groups, or an entire Microsoft 365 group.\n\nUse case: Inviting visitors to a communication site for collaboration. Visitors can be added as part of a security group where permissions are standardized for a large number of visiting collaborators.\n\nHub site permissions: SharePoint admins control which users can add more sites. Hub permissions can go either of two ways:\n\nFor team sites, permissions should be managed from the corresponding Microsoft 365 group.\n\nPermissions should be managed from the SharePoint group for communication sites (since communication sites aren’t part of Microsoft 365 Groups).\n\nShareable links permissions: Any user assigned SharePoint permission to access a site, group, or team automatically has SharePoint access to the corresponding site data. Shareable links allow you to share specific data rather than the entire site content. You can edit permissions so that the shared link is accessible by everyone or specified users.\n\nGuest sharing permissions: SharePoint allows guest-sharing capabilities to make collaboration with outside parties easier. Permissions can be edited so that only specific site data is accessible by outside parties.\n\nAn overview of permission levels in SharePoint\n\nFirst, let’s have a closer look at all the SharePoint permissions levels available in SharePoint:\n\nSharePoint permissions best practices: Custom permission levels\n\nOn top of your existing SharePoint permission list, you can use custom permission levels to tailor permissions management around your organization’s specific needs.\n\nKeep the following information in mind about custom permission levels in SharePoint, and you’ll be all set:\n\nWhen you create custom permissions\n\nAdministrators can create custom SharePoint permission levels and define what a user can do within the boundaries you create for them. This can include creating a custom permission level where a user can edit documents, manage permissions, change site settings, etc.\n\nFor example, say you have an HR executive who should be able to view, edit, and delete employee records but shouldn’t be able to tamper with any site settings. You can create a custom permission level around this and name it “HR Executive – Employee Records Management.”\n\nBest practice for custom permission levels\n\nBased on our experience, we have a few suggestions before creating and assigning custom permission levels within your organization.\n\nThe following practices help avoid confusion and roadblocks for end-users:\n\nThoroughly analyze user roles and responsibilities to understand what a user requires for seamless workflow and what they don’t, based on their job description.\n\nConsult with stakeholders to understand their point of view, what they require access to, and why.\n\nDocument the purpose and scope of each SharePoint permission level to keep things clear for everyone.\n\nConduct periodic reviews to ensure permissions are consistent with organizational requirements and security policies.\n\nBest practices for permissions inheritance and breaking permissions inheritance\n\nConsistency of security policy enforcement directly influences how secure your Microsoft 365 environment actually is. If we specifically talk about the role of SharePoint permissions management in ensuring consistency, here’s how permissions inheritance will help:\n\nPermissions inheritance\n\nIn SharePoint, permission inheritance means permissions assigned to a ‘parent object,’ like a site collection or site, are automatically passed down to the ‘child object’ created within that site.\n\nThe parent-child relationship with permissions means that the child object gets the same permissions as the parent object, reducing the manual effort required to constantly assign permissions whenever a new object, such as a site, is created.\n\nThe best practice for security within your SharePoint environment is to leverage permission inheritance to your advantage to create a structure where permissions are automatically assigned without repeating the same process of assigning new permissions.\n\nBreaking permission inheritance\n\nInstances will occur within your SharePoint environment when you’ll need to assign customized permissions to certain objects. In instances like this, you’ll be changing the inherited permissions which that object got from the parent object. This is called breaking permissions inheritance. This allows for role-based access control (RBAC) and enables unique permissions for specific objects.\n\nThe best practice is only to break permission inheritance when absolutely necessary and document it so all customized permissions can be tracked. Also, when documented, make sure the reason for the discontinuity in default permissions is also explained.\n\nBut still, know that breaking permission inheritance too much will create an overly complex permissions structure that will be difficult to manage. You might be able to understand the customized structure because you’re making these changes, but you’ll end up making lives difficult for new administrators who have to deal with this.\n\nBest practices for the principle of least privilege\n\nOne critical aspect of maximizing security within your organization is only allowing users necessary access to information. Needlessly giving permission to the intern to access a folder that contains the company’s finances isn’t smart, is it?\n\nThe principle of least privilege emphasizes just this.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe principle of least privilege states that users should be given the lowest possible permissions required to fulfill their job responsibilities. This minimizes unnecessary risk and reduces security issues such as data leakage, data modification, or unauthorized access.\n\nImportance and best practice in permissions management\n\nThe importance of implementing the principle of least privilege within your organization is paramount, as the risk of security breaches is minimized. Regularly review and adjust permissions based on this principle. This will help maintain a secure SharePoint environment and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or misuse.\n\nBest practices for simplifying SharePoint permissions management using groups\n\nPlan and organize: Before creating SharePoint groups, carefully analyze your organization’s user roles and responsibilities. Group users based on their common permissions requirements and responsibilities. This helps ensure that SharePoint roles and permissions are assigned efficiently and consistently across your document library.\n\nLimit unique permissions: Aim to minimize the number of unique permissions within your SharePoint environment. Too many unique permissions can lead to complexity, making it challenging to manage and troubleshoot permissions. Whenever possible, leverage permission inheritance and SharePoint groups to maintain a consistent and manageable permission structure.\n\n2 ways to manage user and group permissions in SharePoint Online\n\nMethod #1: Using Microsoft\n\nAdd users to a group\n\nOn the SharePoint site, click share/members.\n\nClick on Add Members.\n\nEnter the names or e-mail addresses of the users you want to add will appear in the dialogue box.\n\nYou can also set SharePoint permissions levels when sending the invite.\n\nOnce done, click on Share, and the invite will be sent.\n\nRemove users from a group\n\nGo to the SharePoint site and click Settings.\n\nClick Site settings/Site Information.\n\nClick View all site settings/Site settings. (Some users might need to click on Site contents before viewing the Site settings dialogue).\n\nOn the Site Settings page, go to Users and Permissions—> People and Groups.\n\nGo to People and Groups—>Quick Launch and select the user you want to remove.\n\nClick Actions—>Remove Users from Group.\n\nA confirmation dialogue box will pop up. Click Ok to proceed and remove the user.\n\nGrant site access to a group\n\nGo to the SharePoint site and click Settings.\n\nGo to Site Permissions.\n\nClick Advanced Site Permissions once the site permissions page opens.\n\nOn the Advanced Site Permissions page, click on the Permissions tab.\n\nClick Grant Permissions.\n\nClick on Share, and enter the group name to who you’d like to give access.\n\nAfter you click on Share, a prompt will appear asking you the level of permissions you want to give to the group. By default, the group will be able to edit. But, you can change permission levels by clicking on Show options—> Select a Permission Level/Select a group or permission level.\n\nOnce permissions for the group are finalized, click Share to proceed.\n\nAssign a new permission level to a group\n\nGo to the SharePoint Site and click Settings—>Site Settings/Site information on the SharePoint site. (Sometimes, you’ll have to click on Site contents and then Site settings).\n\nOnce on the Site Settings page, click on Users and Permissions—> Site Permissions.\n\nHover over the user/group to which you’d like to assign a new permission level. Tick the check box to select them.\n\nGo to the Permissions tab and click on Edit User Permissions.\n\nYou’ll be prompted to a screen where you’ll be able to grant custom permissions to the group. If you check multiple boxes, the user will get a combination of all those SharePoint permission levels.\n\nMethod #2: Editing permission assignments using ShareGate\n\nShareGate simplifies the permissions management process. You can add permissions, copy user permissions, and remove permissions—among other actions—straight from the quick actions menu.\n\nAdd permissions\n\nTo grant permissions to users or groups in a target location, go to Explorer and select the sites where you want to apply the changes. Click + Add from the Permissions section in the Quick actions menu.\n\nIn Add permissions, you can select one or multiple users and grant them new permissions over the items previously selected in the Explorer. You can add them to existing SharePoint groups, assign them as Site Collection administrators, or assign them explicit SharePoint permissions. These can be out-of-the-box permission levels or custom ones. You can also assign permissions to SharePoint groups and Active Directory groups.\n\nCopy user permissions\n\nOne particularly interesting feature is the ability to copy the permissions of a user to another.\n\nFor example, your company makes two hires for the Sales Team: Alex and David. As an IT admin, you know Alex and David’s permissions should be the same. In ShareGate, copy Martin’s already existing permissions and assign them to Alex and David. That’s it! Alex and David now have the same access to site content as the rest of the team. You can select a tenant, sites, or any SharePoint object for this operation.\n\nRemove permissions\n\nIt’s been a few months, and Alex and David have been promoted to new positions with different job descriptions. As a result, the old permissions are no longer required.\n\nOur Remove Permissions option is there to help you remove permissions from users or groups.\n\nWith Remove permissions, you can select your tenant, sites, or other SharePoint objects to:\n\nRemove from SharePoint group membership\n\nRemove from site collection administrators\n\nRemove their explicit permissions\n\nRemove all permissions\n\nShareGate’s Permissions Matrix Report: An answer to permission management problems in SharePoint\n\nPermissions must be managed efficiently and regularly audited to maintain an ongoing compliance standard of high-level security for your organization’s data.\n\nShareGate offers a built-in Permissions Matrix Report, which covers all those bases. Think of it as your all-knowing personal security assistant.\n\nWith one click, you get comprehensive visibility of what users and groups have access to and their permission levels in your SharePoint and Microsoft 365 environments.\n\nWith the results from our Permissions Matrix Report, you can:\n\nSee who (and which groups) can access what, including external users and the content shared via anonymous links.\n\nPlan your migration by helping you answer, “Are these the SharePoint permissions I want to have when I migrate to the destination?”.\n\nCompare pre- and post-migration. Before you make the move, get a snapshot of your SharePoint permissions list. You can compare your source to your destination when your migration is completed.\n\nIt’s safe to say that there’s a fair amount of attention spent on permissions management in SharePoint. The platform is evolving to cater to digital and secure collaboration.\n\nAdvanced permissions capabilities allow you to track who has access to what across the organization. And if you want more flexibility in staying updated about these permissions, you always have ShareGate’s Permission Matrix Report to rely on.\n\nHowever, another crucial aspect often overlooked is user training for maintaining data governance and security compliance within organizations. Educating users on proper permission protocols can mitigate the risks of data breaches and ensure smooth collaboration. By incorporating user training into your SharePoint governance strategy, you empower users to understand their roles and responsibilities regarding access management. This proactive approach will promote a culture of security awareness and accountability among all stakeholders.\n\nAdvanced permission capabilities allow you to track who has access to what across the organization. And if you want more flexibility in staying updated about these permissions, you always have ShareGate’s Permission Matrix Report to rely on.\n\nSharePoint permissions management FAQs\n\nHave questions about managing permissions and user access in SharePoint?
