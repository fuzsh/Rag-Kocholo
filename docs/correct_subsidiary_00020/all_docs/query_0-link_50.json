        "text": "5 SharePoint Communication Site Examples and Templates\n\nCommunication site in SharePoint is a template that makes it easy to share company-wide information with many or all employees. For instance, a site for new employee onboarding, safety information, or training are all great examples of communication sites. Communication sites are best when you have many page visitors and a few content authors.\n\nWhat is the difference between team site and communication site in SharePoint?\n\nTeam sites make it easy to:\n\nRestrict who can access the team site\n\nGive site members the ability to add new content and documents\n\nCollaborate and track project and team tasks\n\nShare and co-author documents\n\nConnect a team site to Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) channel (so documents shared in MS Teams chat can be automatically stored in the team site)\n\nCommunication sites make it easy to:\n\nEnable all employees to access the site\n\nCreate and share company news with all employees\n\nCreate an intranet homepage or a landing page for a department\n\nCreate pages with engaging website-like designs\n\nNavigate between sites using a mega-menu\n\nSharePoint communication site examples and templates\n\nWebsite-like SharePoint site examples\n\nHere are the top examples of communication site templates we created for our customers. Some of these templates use Origami apps to make pages more user-friendly.\n\nmodern Sharepoint communication site\n\nSharePoint communication site for 2024\n\nThis modern communication site is bold, clean, and clutter-free. It includes quick links to frequently used applications and a news center organized by news categories. It also has a calendar that allows employees to RSVP events right from the homepage, links grouped into tabs/categories, staff directory and employee shout-outs.\n\nSharePoint communication site homepage\n\nUse this design to share information with the entire organization. This design can serve as an intranet homepage, a division or a business unit homepage, a subsidiary or regional office homepage.\n\nWhat makes this template great?\n\nCreative and engaging news carousel.\n\nEasy access to the most frequently used tools and apps.\n\nPlenty of space to make the page easy to read.\n\nQuick and user-friendly access to forms, templates, policies and procedures.\n\nSharePoint communication site for a company department\n\nSharePoint communication site example for HR department\n\nUse this design to share department-specific information with all employees. This design can serve as an HR department landing site or new employee onboarding site.\n\nWhat makes this template great?\n\nRelevant HR resources are immediately available at the top of the page\n\nLinks to HR topics such as Benefits, Pay, Career, Learning can help direct to specific pages with details.\n\nInformative onboarding timeline makes first days in the company a great experience.\n\nHR forms, templates, and documents are linked for easier access.\n\nSimple and easy-to-use FAQ section answers new hires' most common questions\n\nSharePoint communication site example for marketing and sales resources\n\nUse this design to share department-specific information with the entire organization. This design can serve as a marketing or sales resources landing page or another department resources landing page.\n\nWhat makes this template great?\n\nIndustry events and news prominently displayed on the page.\n\nEasy access to the most frequent resources.\n\nUser-friendly display of relevant performance information.\n\nOther SharePoint communication site features\n\nAmong a few other notable SharePoint communication site features, we’d like to point out:\n\nFull-width section\n\nAll of the examples above show the top part of the page stretching across the entire page. That’s a full-width section, and it’s is only available in communication sites. The full-width section makes the site landing page look more attractive. In contrast, this feature is not available on team sites.\n\nVertical section\n\nThe vertical section allows you to add a sidebar to the right of the page, and this sidebar will stretch all the way down. The vertical section is mainly used for social feeds, quick links, tickers and trackers. Here is an example of how the sidebar looks on the page with the social feed added to it:\n\nStaggered site launch\n\nThis feature allows you to launch your page in stages which could be useful for larger organizations with thousands of employees accessing the site. For example, when you make a significant change on the intranet homepage, you can make this change visible to a smaller audience first, so if there is an issue – you’ve only impacted a sub-set of your visitors.\n\nHow to create a basic SharePoint communication site?\n\nLog in to https://portal.office.com with an account that allows you to create new sites.\n\nIn the top left corner of the page, select the app launcher icon and click the [SharePoint] link. Click the [All] icon if the [SharePoint] link is not visible.\n\nAt the top of the page, click the [+ Create site] button.\n\nWhen asked what kind of site you’d like to create, select a [Communication site].\n\nGive the new site a name, description, and optionally the URL of the site.\n\nClick [Finish].\n\nCan I convert a team site to a communication site?\n\nIt is currently impossible to convert a team site into a communications site and vice versa.\n\nSharePoint communication site design\n\nWhen creating a basic communications site in SharePoint, many describe the result as simple but sometimes too plain. It can often take a lot of time to make the site appealing to employees and sometimes require buying individual tools to provide functionality on pages.\n\nIf you like the examples you see here, check out our SharePoint intranet project implementation process.\n\nYaroslav Pentsarskyy is a Digital Workplace Advisor at ORIGAMI. Yaroslav has been awarded as Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for 8 years in a row and has authored and published 4 intranet books.\n\nYaroslav is also a frequent presenter at industry conferences and events, such as the Microsoft SharePoint Conference and Microsoft Ignite."
