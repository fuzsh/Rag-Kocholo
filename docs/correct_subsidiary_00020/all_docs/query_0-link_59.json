So you could say we take security pretty seriously!\n\nHow do I buy a Commercial Edition of Verint Community?\n\nWell, that is quite simple. Drop us a note at telligent-sales@verint.com and we’ll follow-up.\n\nHow is Verint Community deployed?\n\nVerint Community can be run on-premises or in the cloud and Verint Community gives you 100% control of what your community looks like.\n\nVerint Community is a developer/designer-friendly product with a well-documented set of RESTful APIs and numerous open source integration kits. Verint Community is implemented and used by numerous agencies that deliver incredible communities for their customers.\n\nYes, basically it is awesome sauce for building customer communities. Be sure and check out our Resource Center for case studies, e-books and other great resources about Verint Community.\n\nWhat is the most current version of Verint Community?\n\nVerint Community 12.0, download here, was released in February 2021. For more information about that release, check out our Community Blog\n\nWhat are the system requirements for running Verint Community on-premises?\n\nRunning Verint Community can be as simple as running a single server to multiple clustered servers with dedicated task / job servers. It is designed as a service-oriented architecture that can easily scale up and is built on Microsoft .NET technology, Microsoft IIS web server, Microsoft SQL database server, and Apache Solr search technology.\n\nPlease review system requirements for specific details.\n\nWhat database technology does Verint Community use?\n\nVerint Community uses Microsoft SQL Server for its database technology.\n\nPlease review system requirements for more details on versions and configuration recommendations.\n\nWhat search technology does Verint Community use?\n\nVerint Community uses the Lucene/Solr open source enterprise search platform as the default internal search provider. Solr is further optimized by Verint Community to weight search results based on content interactions (analytics) and quality scoring (content and people).\n\nPlease see system requirements for specific details.\n\nHow often is Verint Community updated?\n\nWe release a major version of Verint Community approximately twice per year (one major and one minor version, e.g. 12.0 and 12.1). Service packs are made available every 10-12 weeks. For support customers, we also offer a hotfix escalation process.\n\nWhat are my options for where Verint Community runs?\n\nWe’re flexible – Verint Community can be deployed with one of the following options with the ability to change at a later point in time.\n\nFor example, a lot of our customers start with our Cloud or SaaS option and later move to on-premises. Why? As their community becomes a more critical part of their business they want to integrate with other systems that may be hosted in another data center or with a provider like Azure or Amazon Web Service.\n\nYou Host (On-Premises) – you run the software ‘on-premises’ in your own data center, Azure or Amazon Web Services.\n\nWe Host (Cloud or SaaS) – we run the software in our Cloud or SaaS environments. Cloud option has the same great service levels and support, monitoring and upkeep as our SaaS offering The difference between Cloud and SaaS options is if you decide during the term to self-host in a data center or service provider of your choice, you can. You just give us 30 days notice and you only pay for the hosting services you’ve used. Note: We’re told by many happy customers that we’re the only forums and community software provider at our level that offers this kind of flexibility.\n\nBasically, we want to make it easy to run our software for whatever way works best for you.\n\nWhat does a typical deployment look like?\n\nA typical commercial community will have two web servers and a single database server. On average, you can expect each web server to handle 120,000 – 150,000 page views per month.\n\nOur larger customers have 10+ servers, but these are for communities that serve over 1b requests per month (page views, RSS, and API calls).\n\nPS: we would be more than happy to sell you 10 servers, but you probably don’t need that many.\n\nDoes Verint Community have an API?\n\nYes, Verint Community was designed first and foremost as a platform. This includes:\n\nNative API\n\nDirect Platform API (RESTful web service)\n\nRemote iFrame widgets\n\nEmbedded native functionality\n\nRSS feeds\n\nWe also provide a number of open source SDKs (published on GitHub) and tools for creating new UX using Verint Community’s Widget Studio development tools that retain API compatibility with the platform APIs.\n\nDoes Verint Community integrate with CRM systems?\n\nYes, Verint Community integrates with a variety of CRM systems, the most popular of which is Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics. Verint provides an open source Salesforce SDK on GitHub that enables customers to integrate activities, cases, identity and more between Salesforce and the community. Custom integrations have been done for SAP as well as Microsoft Dynamics though the Verint Community platform API.\n\nDoes Verint Community integrate with CMS systems?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides deep integration with CMS systems this is a fundamental part of our go-to-market strategy. The best examples of this is Verint’s long-standing commitment to Sitecore. Verint Community provides a full suite of integration samples and a Sitecore specific SDK on GitHub. The base Verint Community .NET SDK can be used to integrate with any ASP.NET content management system includes Umbraco, Sitefinity, Kentico and others.\n\nDoes Verint Community integrate with analytics systems?\n\nYes, Verint Community integrates with the analytics providers including Google Analytics, Tableau, Omniture, Webtrends, Sitecore and Smarter Stats. Verint Community has added specific integration points for web analytics products to make it very easy to enable web analytics tracking.\n\nWhat integrations are available?\n\nThere are several integrations available with more on the way. We publish all of the integrations on GitHub with full source:\n\nVerint Community SDK for Sitecore – use Verint Community functionality in Sitecore.\n\nVerint Community Samples for Sitecore – samples for using Verint Community in Sitecore.\n\nVerint Community WebParts for SharePoint – use Verint Community functionality in SharePoint.\n\nSharePoint Connector for Verint Community – use SharePoint functionality in Verint Community.\n\nSalesForce Connector for Verint Community – use SalesForce functionality in Verint Community.\n\nLync Connector for Verint Community – use Lync functionality in Verint Community.\n\nMobile SDK for Verint Community (Cordova-based project) – built iOS and Android apps for Verint Community.\n\nVerint Community .NET SDK – use Verint Community within any .NET application.\n\nWhat languages are available?\n\nVerint Community uses double-byte storage and supports right-to-left layouts – that is a technical way of saying that we support content and layouts in any language. Now, technically we haven’t tried Klingon, but our developers assure us that it would work too. We also have partners, like Lionbridge, that have built some great tools to auto-translate content so people in Germany could see content that was posted in English auto-translated to German (and vice-versa).\n\nIn addition to allowing any content to be stored, we also support language translations of the application itself. These include things like the menus and other display elements. We support the following (in addition to English):\n\nSimplified Chinese\n\nFrench\n\nGerman\n\nItalian\n\nJapanese\n\nSpanish\n\nDutch\n\nBrazilian Portuguese\n\nOur language translations are simply XML files that you can modify and we have customers that have translated our community software into several languages on their own.\n\nCan Verint Community capture user profile data through registration, social networks, and other systems of record?\n\nYes, community managers and administrators determine what data is captured in addition to common user information (i.e., username, email address).\n\nAdditional data fields may be set up as required. Verint Community also allows for authentication and registration through Open Standards (OAuth), enabling users to sign in and create user accounts using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and other OAuth providers.\n\nAdditional profile data can be synced automatically from other sources such as Active Directory, SalesForce or proprietary data stores.\n\nDoes Verint Community display user profiles on the site?\n\nYes, each member in Verint Community has a unique profile page that displays relevant information the user provides at registration or after joining the community. Users may provide as much or as little information about themselves as they like (including profile fields required at the time of registration).\n\nNote: the user profile page can be disabled for scenarios where the community is integrated with an existing website. For example, customers that integrate us with popular CMS’s like Sitecore typically prefer that the CMS host the user profile.\n\nWhat details about the user does the profile include?\n\nThe community manager may create any profile fields and decide which of those fields are required/optional, which are displayed, and which are editable/read-only. Profile data can be synced automatically from other sources such as Active Directory, SalesForce or proprietary data stores.\n\nIs Verint Community optimized for SEO?\n\nYes, Verint Community is optimized for search engines. Content title, body text, tag and other elements used for SEO are published within the page in an SEO friendly manner. Furthermore, the URL can be optimized by the end publisher to control what keywords are shown. All content is accessible via standard links and an auto-generated XML sitemap helps popular search engines quickly find content. Lastly, other techniques are used to ensure the search engines only find relevant content with some content being automatically blocked from search engines.\n\nHow is Verint Community content searched?\n\nVerint Community uses the Lucene/Solr open source enterprise search platform as the default internal search provider. Solr is further optimized by Verint Community to weight search results based on content interactions (analytics) and quality scoring (content and people). Search results are also integrated with the security infrastructure to trim search results based on the searching user’s permissions – in other words, you can’t find what you aren’t allowed access to.\n\nCan Verint Community manage question/answer tracking?\n\nYes, Verint Community’s forums application includes question & answer threads with a verification workflow. This works as follows:\n\nPeople post questions in the forums and invited other users to suggest answers.\n\nEither the question asker or community manager may mark any reply as a verified answer.\n\nVerified answers may also later be rejected and replaced with a new answer if information subsequently changes, invalidating the original answer.\n\nIndividual answers may also be rated by site users.\n\nAnswers can be promoted into wikis or articles as well. The new Articles feature in v12 have feedback loops and approval workflows, too!\n\nCan Verint Community manage threaded discussions?\n\nYes, Verint Community’s forum application supports open discussion threads. Community managers determine which types of discussions are allowed in an individual forum, enabling users to select either Q&A or discussion, if both are enabled.\n\nCan Verint Community handle ratings and reviews?\n\nYes, Verint Community uses a rating service to allow people to like and/or rate content, as well as a commenting service to enable more detailed feedback. These services are not necessarily tied to user generated content types (e.g., blog posts, forum threads, etc.) only and may be extended to be used on external content, such as a product page hosted on a separate content management system.\n\nHow are blogs created within Verint Community?\n\nBlogs may be self-provisioned and community managers can put in rules. For instance; only accounts with an email address belonging to the company may create blogs. Blogs can also be easily created by community managers through a new blog wizard.\n\nCan blog content be posted anywhere?\n\nYes, blogs may be added anywhere within the community and through the APIs blogs can be embedded within other websites. However, unlike the popular WordPress blogging platform, Verint Community is best used as a pure blogging platform vs. a hybrid blog/CMS platform. Instead we recommend integrating with a web content management system such as Sitecore.\n\nCan user-generated content from social networks be published in the community?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides several capabilities to include content from social networks:\n\nWidgets and plugins to pull content from broader social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These components can be configured to target specific search terms.\n\nBlog mirroring configures a Verint Community blog to mirror content from a public RSS feed.\n\nRelevant updates from Twitter can be included in the site’s activity stream.\n\nCan Verint Community syndicate brand-generated and user-generated content?\n\nYes, through Verint Community’s APIs, content can be published and pushed from Telligent Community to any website. This includes:\n\nRemote iFrame widgets\n\nEmbedded native functionality\n\nDirect Platform API (RESTful web service)\n\nRSS feeds\n\nFor Web Content Management Systems Verint Community provide open source SDKs designed to integrate directly into those WCM platforms (see Verint Community SDK for Sitecore).\n\nCan Verint Community embed/encode videos and other rich content?\n\nYes, the included HTML5 video transcoding service enables videos of any format to be uploaded to Verint Community. These videos transcoded to HTML5 are playable in the browser without requiring client-side plugins (including mobile devices). Video, audio and other rich media can be added to any user-generated content through the standard rich text editor.\n\nCan Verint Community provide document previews of popular Office document formats?\n\nYes, Verint Community includes a document preview capability which allows for common document formats such as Microsoft Office PowerPoint, Excel, Word and other document types such as PDF to be displayed in the browser and on mobile devices without requiring the corresponding applications to be installed.\n\nCan Verint Community help clients manage user activity within the community?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides a number of tools to help manage user activity within the community:\n\nAutomated rules engine – automate actions within the community.\n\nKeyword filtering – remove/replace keywords that occur in content.\n\nWhitelist HTML filtering – whitelist of allowed HTML that can be included in user-generated content.\n\nDoes Verint Community include tools to control spam and other types of unwanted content?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides a number of tools to help manage user activity within the community:\n\nAutomated rules engine – automate actions within the community.\n\nKeyword filtering – remove/replace keywords that occur in content.\n\nWhitelist HTML filtering – whitelist of allowed HTML that can be included in user-generated content.\n\nAuto-Spam Management – enables community managers to establish rules to measure user-generated content against configured scoring thresholds prior to publication.\n\nForum and comment moderation – ability to move content into a moderation queue prior to publication.\n\nAbuse management – tools that allow end users to vote content as abusive to help community managers moderate content.\n\nWhat security controls does Verint Community provide?\n\nVerint Community provides extensive security controls. Telligent Community makes use of authentication (validating identity) and authorization (grant that identity rights or denying them rights). Authentication is can be self-registration, invitation-based, or private.\n\nAuthentication can be configured to use a variety of different sources, such as open standards OAuth providers (LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter), SAML, LDAP, Active Directory, and any custom single sign-on provider.\n\nAuthorization is done through roles which are logical groupings of community members. Example roles: Everyone, Anonymous, Community Manager, etc. You can create your own roles to model your business needs. Applications within Verint Community expose permissions controlling what actions are allowed. For example, read a blog, post to a blog, delete a blog, edit a blog, create a blog. Permissions are granted to roles and users are assigned to roles.\n\nCan Verint Community ensure the authenticity of users and content?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides several mechanisms for ensuring authenticity. This starts with the authentication system, which can use trusted identity sources such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. All content passes through a set of rules before being published and customers have the opportunity to add additional safety measures and checks to ensure content meets certain standards prior to publication.\n\nDoes Verint Community support permissions and access levels to different users?\n\nYes, all users in Verint Community are assigned to one or more roles (logical groupings of community members). Roles can then be assigned permissions that dictate what a user in the role may do within the site. These permissions are configurable at the site, group and application (blog, forum, wiki, etc.) level to enable very fine grain control over who views published content.\n\nCan Verint Community restrict who has access to content?\n\nYes, this is a fundamental strength of Verint Community. Through the configurable permissions and access levels, content that a user does not have permission to see is never seen within the site. Content is automatically trimmed from search, activity streams, forums, RSS, APIs and more.\n\nCan Verint Community integrate with my website?\n\nYes, Verint Community is designed to easily integrate with 3rd party Web Content Management platforms. Integration can be as simple as shared sign-on (SSO), aggregating Verint Community RSS feeds, embedding Verint Community iFrame widgets or can be more natively integrated directly through Verint Community’s platform API (RESTful web services) and native SDKs designed specifically for Web Content Management Systems (such as Sitecore).\n\nDoes Verint Community include gamification features?\n\nYes, Verint Community includes a full gamification, rules engine and points systems. The rules engine allows non-technical community managers to create rules which can be used for gamification of the community: allowing users to earn recognition through badges, unlock new capabilities, and participate in leaderboards.\n\nDoes Verint Community analyze the actions and behaviors of users?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides a number of analytics capabilities focused around user behavior, user reputation and content quality scoring. This quality scoring features tracks interactions of the user and the content they publish and applies internal scores/weights to both. Those score impact where content shows up, whose content gets promoted.\n\nCan Verint Community recommend content?\n\nYes, using the quality scoring of both content and users, the recommendation engine can filter content that is most appropriate to either the user or the content being viewed.\n\nDoes Verint Community measure the quality of content through readership, comments, and ratings?\n\nYes, Verint Community measures content contributions and interactions through a set of analytic capabilities delivered as site widgets (reusable UX element). These widgets may be configured to create a Telligent Analytics dashboard at the site level and/or within individual groups.\n\nDoes Verint Community’s analytics include a community health or ROI?\n\nYes, Verint Community includes a Community Health Summary that measures the “heartbeat” of the community (or group). Verint has been investing in making the analytics data available to specialized 3rd party analytics tools as community data is often combined with other digital marketing activities.\n\nIs Verint Community accessible from mobile devices?\n\nYes, Verint Community is fully responsive and adaptive and will work “as-is” on any modern mobile device.\n\nWhat social / community applications does Verint Community include?\n\nVerint Community includes the following applications. These applications can be organized into groups or can be used separately:\n\nForums\n\nBlogs\n\nWikis\n\nArticles\n\nIdeation\n\nMedia / File Galleries\n\nCalendaring\n\nPolls\n\nPages\n\nPrivate Messages\n\nChat\n\nWhat social / community services does Verint Community include?\n\nBelow is a partial list of the services that Verint Community includes.

Groups are effectively micro-communities that can have their own permissions and members. Groups provide a logical mapping for business use cases. For example, you could create a public group for product support and a private partner enablement group. Verint Community provides a set of applications that are used to manage the community:\n\nProfiles\n\nSearch\n\nControl Panel\n\nRules Engine\n\nAbuse Management\n\nWho is Verint?\n\nVerint is The Customer Engagement Company, and our focus is helping organizations worldwide to meet their strategic goals.

Note: We’re told by many happy customers that we’re the only forums and community software provider at our level that offers this kind of flexibility.\n\nBasically, we want to make it easy to run our software for whatever way works best for you.\n\nWhat does a typical deployment look like?\n\nA typical commercial community will have two web servers and a single database server. On average, you can expect each web server to handle 120,000 – 150,000 page views per month.\n\nOur larger customers have 10+ servers, but these are for communities that serve over 1b requests per month (page views, RSS, and API calls).\n\nPS: we would be more than happy to sell you 10 servers, but you probably don’t need that many.\n\nDoes Verint Community have an API?\n\nYes, Verint Community was designed first and foremost as a platform. This includes:\n\nNative API\n\nDirect Platform API (RESTful web service)\n\nRemote iFrame widgets\n\nEmbedded native functionality\n\nRSS feeds\n\nWe also provide a number of open source SDKs (published on GitHub) and tools for creating new UX using Verint Community’s Widget Studio development tools that retain API compatibility with the platform APIs.\n\nDoes Verint Community integrate with CRM systems?\n\nYes, Verint Community integrates with a variety of CRM systems, the most popular of which is Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics. Verint provides an open source Salesforce SDK on GitHub that enables customers to integrate activities, cases, identity and more between Salesforce and the community. Custom integrations have been done for SAP as well as Microsoft Dynamics though the Verint Community platform API.\n\nDoes Verint Community integrate with CMS systems?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides deep integration with CMS systems this is a fundamental part of our go-to-market strategy. The best examples of this is Verint’s long-standing commitment to Sitecore. Verint Community provides a full suite of integration samples and a Sitecore specific SDK on GitHub. The base Verint Community .NET SDK can be used to integrate with any ASP.NET content management system includes Umbraco, Sitefinity, Kentico and others.\n\nDoes Verint Community integrate with analytics systems?\n\nYes, Verint Community integrates with the analytics providers including Google Analytics, Tableau, Omniture, Webtrends, Sitecore and Smarter Stats. Verint Community has added specific integration points for web analytics products to make it very easy to enable web analytics tracking.\n\nWhat integrations are available?\n\nThere are several integrations available with more on the way. We publish all of the integrations on GitHub with full source:\n\nVerint Community SDK for Sitecore – use Verint Community functionality in Sitecore.\n\nVerint Community Samples for Sitecore – samples for using Verint Community in Sitecore.\n\nVerint Community WebParts for SharePoint – use Verint Community functionality in SharePoint.\n\nSharePoint Connector for Verint Community – use SharePoint functionality in Verint Community.\n\nSalesForce Connector for Verint Community – use SalesForce functionality in Verint Community.\n\nLync Connector for Verint Community – use Lync functionality in Verint Community.\n\nMobile SDK for Verint Community (Cordova-based project) – built iOS and Android apps for Verint Community.\n\nVerint Community .NET SDK – use Verint Community within any .NET application.\n\nWhat languages are available?\n\nVerint Community uses double-byte storage and supports right-to-left layouts – that is a technical way of saying that we support content and layouts in any language. Now, technically we haven’t tried Klingon, but our developers assure us that it would work too. We also have partners, like Lionbridge, that have built some great tools to auto-translate content so people in Germany could see content that was posted in English auto-translated to German (and vice-versa).\n\nIn addition to allowing any content to be stored, we also support language translations of the application itself. These include things like the menus and other display elements. We support the following (in addition to English):\n\nSimplified Chinese\n\nFrench\n\nGerman\n\nItalian\n\nJapanese\n\nSpanish\n\nDutch\n\nBrazilian Portuguese\n\nOur language translations are simply XML files that you can modify and we have customers that have translated our community software into several languages on their own.\n\nCan Verint Community capture user profile data through registration, social networks, and other systems of record?\n\nYes, community managers and administrators determine what data is captured in addition to common user information (i.e., username, email address).\n\nAdditional data fields may be set up as required. Verint Community also allows for authentication and registration through Open Standards (OAuth), enabling users to sign in and create user accounts using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and other OAuth providers.\n\nAdditional profile data can be synced automatically from other sources such as Active Directory, SalesForce or proprietary data stores.\n\nDoes Verint Community display user profiles on the site?\n\nYes, each member in Verint Community has a unique profile page that displays relevant information the user provides at registration or after joining the community. Users may provide as much or as little information about themselves as they like (including profile fields required at the time of registration).\n\nNote: the user profile page can be disabled for scenarios where the community is integrated with an existing website. For example, customers that integrate us with popular CMS’s like Sitecore typically prefer that the CMS host the user profile.\n\nWhat details about the user does the profile include?\n\nThe community manager may create any profile fields and decide which of those fields are required/optional, which are displayed, and which are editable/read-only. Profile data can be synced automatically from other sources such as Active Directory, SalesForce or proprietary data stores.\n\nIs Verint Community optimized for SEO?\n\nYes, Verint Community is optimized for search engines. Content title, body text, tag and other elements used for SEO are published within the page in an SEO friendly manner. Furthermore, the URL can be optimized by the end publisher to control what keywords are shown. All content is accessible via standard links and an auto-generated XML sitemap helps popular search engines quickly find content. Lastly, other techniques are used to ensure the search engines only find relevant content with some content being automatically blocked from search engines.\n\nHow is Verint Community content searched?\n\nVerint Community uses the Lucene/Solr open source enterprise search platform as the default internal search provider. Solr is further optimized by Verint Community to weight search results based on content interactions (analytics) and quality scoring (content and people). Search results are also integrated with the security infrastructure to trim search results based on the searching user’s permissions – in other words, you can’t find what you aren’t allowed access to.\n\nDoes Verint Community support Open Search?\n\nYes, Verint Community supports Open Search and can be integrated with other search platforms already in use.\n\nCan Verint Community personalize content?\n\nYes, the widget-and-layout framework in Verint Community allows for extensive customizability, including the ability to create bespoke content pages at the site and/or group level. However, we recommend integrating with a CMS for delivering deeper personalization of targeted content.\n\nCan Verint Community help with content discovery?\n\nYes, Verint Community includes a content recommendation engine, an “Ask a question” feature that promotes potential answers while a question is being asked, and a weekly or daily email newsletter that contains content personalized to the end user based on analytics and the recommendation engine.\n\nCan Verint Community help me meet new and interesting people?\n\nOk, we put that in to see if you’re actually reading these frequently asked questions. But the answer is yes, our communities connect people around the world.\n\nCan Verint Community manage question/answer tracking?\n\nYes, Verint Community’s forums application includes question & answer threads with a verification workflow. This works as follows:\n\nPeople post questions in the forums and invited other users to suggest answers.\n\nEither the question asker or community manager may mark any reply as a verified answer.\n\nVerified answers may also later be rejected and replaced with a new answer if information subsequently changes, invalidating the original answer.\n\nIndividual answers may also be rated by site users.\n\nAnswers can be promoted into wikis or articles as well. The new Articles feature in v12 have feedback loops and approval workflows, too!\n\nCan Verint Community manage threaded discussions?\n\nYes, Verint Community’s forum application supports open discussion threads. Community managers determine which types of discussions are allowed in an individual forum, enabling users to select either Q&A or discussion, if both are enabled.\n\nCan Verint Community handle ratings and reviews?\n\nYes, Verint Community uses a rating service to allow people to like and/or rate content, as well as a commenting service to enable more detailed feedback. These services are not necessarily tied to user generated content types (e.g., blog posts, forum threads, etc.) only and may be extended to be used on external content, such as a product page hosted on a separate content management system.\n\nHow are blogs created within Verint Community?\n\nBlogs may be self-provisioned and community managers can put in rules. For instance; only accounts with an email address belonging to the company may create blogs. Blogs can also be easily created by community managers through a new blog wizard.\n\nCan blog content be posted anywhere?\n\nYes, blogs may be added anywhere within the community and through the APIs blogs can be embedded within other websites. However, unlike the popular WordPress blogging platform, Verint Community is best used as a pure blogging platform vs. a hybrid blog/CMS platform. Instead we recommend integrating with a web content management system such as Sitecore.\n\nCan user-generated content from social networks be published in the community?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides several capabilities to include content from social networks:\n\nWidgets and plugins to pull content from broader social networks like Facebook and Twitter. These components can be configured to target specific search terms.\n\nBlog mirroring configures a Verint Community blog to mirror content from a public RSS feed.\n\nRelevant updates from Twitter can be included in the site’s activity stream.\n\nCan Verint Community syndicate brand-generated and user-generated content?\n\nYes, through Verint Community’s APIs, content can be published and pushed from Telligent Community to any website.

Telligent Community makes use of authentication (validating identity) and authorization (grant that identity rights or denying them rights). Authentication is can be self-registration, invitation-based, or private.\n\nAuthentication can be configured to use a variety of different sources, such as open standards OAuth providers (LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter), SAML, LDAP, Active Directory, and any custom single sign-on provider.\n\nAuthorization is done through roles which are logical groupings of community members. Example roles: Everyone, Anonymous, Community Manager, etc. You can create your own roles to model your business needs. Applications within Verint Community expose permissions controlling what actions are allowed. For example, read a blog, post to a blog, delete a blog, edit a blog, create a blog. Permissions are granted to roles and users are assigned to roles.\n\nCan Verint Community ensure the authenticity of users and content?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides several mechanisms for ensuring authenticity. This starts with the authentication system, which can use trusted identity sources such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. All content passes through a set of rules before being published and customers have the opportunity to add additional safety measures and checks to ensure content meets certain standards prior to publication.\n\nDoes Verint Community support permissions and access levels to different users?\n\nYes, all users in Verint Community are assigned to one or more roles (logical groupings of community members). Roles can then be assigned permissions that dictate what a user in the role may do within the site. These permissions are configurable at the site, group and application (blog, forum, wiki, etc.) level to enable very fine grain control over who views published content.\n\nCan Verint Community restrict who has access to content?\n\nYes, this is a fundamental strength of Verint Community. Through the configurable permissions and access levels, content that a user does not have permission to see is never seen within the site. Content is automatically trimmed from search, activity streams, forums, RSS, APIs and more.\n\nCan Verint Community integrate with my website?\n\nYes, Verint Community is designed to easily integrate with 3rd party Web Content Management platforms. Integration can be as simple as shared sign-on (SSO), aggregating Verint Community RSS feeds, embedding Verint Community iFrame widgets or can be more natively integrated directly through Verint Community’s platform API (RESTful web services) and native SDKs designed specifically for Web Content Management Systems (such as Sitecore).\n\nDoes Verint Community include gamification features?\n\nYes, Verint Community includes a full gamification, rules engine and points systems. The rules engine allows non-technical community managers to create rules which can be used for gamification of the community: allowing users to earn recognition through badges, unlock new capabilities, and participate in leaderboards.\n\nDoes Verint Community analyze the actions and behaviors of users?\n\nYes, Verint Community provides a number of analytics capabilities focused around user behavior, user reputation and content quality scoring. This quality scoring features tracks interactions of the user and the content they publish and applies internal scores/weights to both. Those score impact where content shows up, whose content gets promoted.\n\nCan Verint Community recommend content?\n\nYes, using the quality scoring of both content and users, the recommendation engine can filter content that is most appropriate to either the user or the content being viewed.\n\nDoes Verint Community measure the quality of content through readership, comments, and ratings?\n\nYes, Verint Community measures content contributions and interactions through a set of analytic capabilities delivered as site widgets (reusable UX element).
