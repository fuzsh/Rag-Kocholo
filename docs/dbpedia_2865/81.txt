London Biggin Hill Airport History

The airfield was opened during World War I by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Reconstruction work at the airfield took place between 1929 and 1932 and during World War II the airfield housed Spitfires and Hurricanes for the Battle of Britain.

After the airfield was vacated by the RAF in 1958, and following the forthcoming closure of nearby London Airport in Croydon, the airfield was used for light aviation relocating to Biggin Hill and once Croydon shut its doors for good, Biggin Hill was mainly used by civilians and occasional military use.

Today, the airport is mainly used for civilian flights, business aviation, and corporate shuttles.
