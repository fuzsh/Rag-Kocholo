        "text": "At the Executive meeting on 25 November, the decision was taken to agree the finalised proposals for the extension of operating hours. However this decision was called in on 14 December by 12 Councillors, including local ward Members Keith Onslow, Chris Pierce and Richard Scoates. The Executive & Resources Policy Development & Scrutiny Committee will examine the decision on 5 January 2016 (See Agenda). See also the article on the GSG website for comments from a retired senior air traffic controller.\n\n25 March 2015\n\nThe decision to approve the airport's application to extend operating hours was made by Bromley Council at Full Council meeting on 25 March (see Minutes - when available) - see News Shopper articles:\n\n13 March and 27 March 2015\n\nSee also article on Green Street Green Village Society website by Bob Trott (Chair), a retired senior air traffic controller\n\n© www.bigginhillairport.com/about/\n\nClick on link below to go to e-edition of Bromley Times\n\nBRAAD advertisement in 19 February Bromley Times\n\nClick on image to enlarge\n\n\"London Biggin Hill Airport 2\" by Philip Talmage. Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBelow are articles in the Bromley Times editions of 19 and 26 February, including an advertisement placed by BRAAD plus their 'Open Letter to Bromley Council'\n\nClick on image to enlarge\n\nBRAAD issues in their 'Open Letter to Bromley Council'\n\nThe Parliamentary report of the Transport Committee dated 2 February 2015 makes interesting reading (not that I (Margot Rohan) have read it from cover to cover yet!): Transport Committee - Oral Evidence on Smaller Airports\n\nIncluded is a link to Written evidence from Kent County Council. The following extracts are of particular interest:\n\n\" - Smaller airports have the potential to deliver economic growth and job creation. KCC is disappointed at the closure of Manston Airport,\n\nbut has welcomed the plans of its new owners to create a £1billion redevelopment of the 800 acre site into a mixed use scheme\n\nhelping to create more than 4,000 new jobs over a 20 year period. Lydd (London Ashford) Airport is planning to extend its runway and\n\ninvest in new terminal capacity. London Biggin Hill Airport provides an important role serving London with specialist business aviation\n\nfacilities and this adds high skilled jobs into the local economy. Smaller airports are part of the UK’s airport network and are strategic\n\naviation infrastructure assets at a regional or sub-regional level.\n\n- Smaller airports provide a niche role for point to point flights, general and business aviation. Smaller airports, by providing this role,\n\nhelp remove this added demand pressure at larger congested airports in the South East. The underused capacity at Kent's smaller\n\nairports can serve the London market. Rationalisation of the UK's airport network is not desirable in the longer term because it will\n\nresult in increased demand on larger capacity constrained airports and lead to further congestion and reduced aviation connectivity.\"\n\n\"Kent County Council recommends to the Committee that action is taken by the Government to:\n\n- Recognise the strategic importance of the UK’s network of smaller airports; and designate smaller airports as either regional or sub-\n\nregional aviation infrastructure assets which will support the growth of UK aviation in the longer term.\n\n- Implement reduced APD and financial support through the Regional Air Connectivity Fund to support smaller airports' commercial\n\nviability. As well as improving aviation connectivity, successful regional airports will help to create new jobs and economic growth.\"\n\n\" London Biggin Hill Airport in the London Borough of Bromley provides specialist aviation for predominately the business market. The airport is a home to commercial aircraft and also a service centre for business and general aviation aircraft; making it an engineering and technology centre in its own right.The Airport generates modern, high tech and well paid jobs.The airport allows business passengers to quickly access London as it is just eleven miles from Canary Wharf. Each aircraft landing at the airport provides economic benefits to south-east London and jobs for people across the region, including in West Kent. Biggin Hill is designated a Strategic Outer London Development Centre in The London Plan. The airport estimates that there are approximately 1,000 jobs on or around the airport and it has the potential to create up to 2,300 jobs in the next 15 years through careful and managed growth.\"\n\nFurther questions raised following the meeting on 13 February - responses supplied by Will Curtis:\n\n1. There is a statement on one of the web sites that BHAL has bought the land so as to extend the 21/03 runway at the NNE corner of the\n\nairport. I know you say that there will be no development beyond the current boundary, but (if the land purchase is correct) would that\n\nstill be true?\n\nYes – we purchased the land last year because the owner was trying to sell it to a developer. We don’t want any inappropriate development around the airport which might cause more complaints. We have leased the land to a local farmer. It will remain as farmland and we do not need to expand beyond our current boundaries now or in the future. The land will remain as farmland. As an aside, it would be impossible to use it for extending the runway as I believe that BRAAD seek to claim because the land drops away to such a degree that this would be impossible.\n\n2. What increase in level is expected compared to now, by enforcing a requirement to fly no lower than 2000ft over villages/towns – e.g.\n\nOrpington - bearing in mind the Rule 5 Regulations for alighting clear of a congested area/safely etc currently in force\n\nAs you know the regulations that we will introduce apply only to aircraft using Biggin Hill Airport. Such aircraft are exempt the 1,500 ft rule because they are taking off or landing at a licensed aerodrome. We believe that in practice, it will cause light aircraft using Biggin Hill to avoid you altogether since they will want to be lower than 1,500 ft if landing at or departing from Biggin Hill.\n\n3. What is the estimate for overall noise reduction by aircraft on a 3 ½ degree Glide Path rather than 3 degrees?\n\nI cannot give a specific answer to this as it will vary from aircraft type to aircraft type but, based on my experience in the Hawker 125 800 and the Learjet 45, it will typically result in a power reduction of circa 5% N1 once established on approach. Our current ILS is actually set at 2.86 degrees.\n\n4. What reduction is expected by asking for minimum use of reverse thrust - again, bearing in mind that most operators want minimum\n\nfuel used now, subject to safety?\n\nBusiness jet aircraft are slightly different to airliners in that the brake wear associated with idle reverse costs more than the fuel used by reverse thrust. Consequently, unless instructed otherwise, most crew will apply a good dose of reverse thrust on landing. There is operationally no need – the brakes will do the job fine – but they do so because it is the cheapest mode of operation. By changing their behaviour, we should be able to reduce noise.\n\n5. On page 64 of the Lease, para (c) - do you interpret the term 'ground running of aircraft' as including taxiing?\n\nNo – ground running is a maintenance exercise only. Clearly aircraft that have just landed must taxi in and shut down safely and without being unduly rushed.\n\n6. Where is the list of Noise Certified Aircraft published?\n\nThe list can be found attached and forms an attachment to the Lease. It has not been reviewed since 1998, but the vast majority of the aircraft listed will be struck off if the Council approves our operating hours as we have agreed to ban anything that is not fully Chapter 3 compliant. List of approved aircraft\n\n7. How is the requirement to cross the upwind end of the runway not above 500ft going to impinge on the (if approved) straight to 4000ft\n\nfor IFR traffic going to DET?\n\nThis requirement applies to VFR circuit traffic. It is designed to ensure that aircraft joining the circuit cross wind did not get into conflict with a departing aircraft. Now we separate by lateral distance.\n\n8. You spoke of a change from 1nm before turning having been changed to 2nm – I cannot find this in the current AIP entry. What is its\n\nstatus?\n\nIt has not yet made it through the Airac cycle as it was submitted with our last AIP amendment. It should be in the AIP next month and so should begin to make a difference after that.\n\n9. The latest Minutes of the Consultative Committee that I could find are July last year. In those comments, the VFR traffic increased with\n\nthe ‘Business’ element decreasing. Has this changed since then and when will the Minutes of the last meeting of 2014 and those for\n\nthis year be promulgated?\n\nI will check with the secretary but last October’s minutes should be on the website by now- I believe that at the January meeting some amendments were called for by some members. Business aviation is certainly declining because we are losing market to other aerodromes (primarily RAF Northolt) due to our restrictive operating hours. Light aviation showed a small increase last year due to an unusually fine summer, but nevertheless we forecast an ongoing reduction in numbers (see the attached graph which shows movement numbers from 1994 to current year).\n\n10. If the hours are increased do you anticipate an increase in maintenance companies home based?\n\nYes – in fact our entire business plan is based on aircraft maintenance companies and aircraft being based at Biggin Hill. Each aircraft based here creates on average 8 new jobs and takes off on average once every 14 days and then goes off around the world before returning in due course. On return it needs, cleaning, maintain and servicing, restocking, hangarage, flight planning for the next trip, catering, accounting and other services. Typically each based aircraft will spend around $5 million annually on based services."
