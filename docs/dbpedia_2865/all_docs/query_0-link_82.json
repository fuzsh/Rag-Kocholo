        "text": "What Can I Expect\n\nBiggin Hill Spitfire flights - two-seater Spitfire flights with a factory tour included! These very special experiences operate out of former RAF Biggin Hill, one of the principal fighter bases of the Battle of Britain in WW2.\n\nWe are very proud to be able to offer these incredible Spitfire flights at Biggin. We often talk of 'once in a lifetime' opportunities and these two seater Spitfire flights really do fall into that category.Ã‚\n\nSo what about the Spitfire you'll be flying in? Well, Spitfires with two seats are incredibly rare. Over 20,000 single seat Spitfires were built, with only a few dozen remaining airworthy today. After WW2, creators Supermarine modified a handful of Mark IX Spitfires into two seaters, called TR9s. The Spitfire Factory at Biggin Hill counts several fully-restored two-seater Spitfires on the flying roster.\n\nYou could be flying in G-BMSB (serial number MJ627, code Q-9G). Resplendent in her invasion stripes, this Spitfire has an amazing log book. She flew numerous ground attack, bomber escort and patrol missions during WW2. That includes being credited with the downing of an enemy Messerschmitt Bf 109 on September 27th 1944.\n\nAfter being damaged and put into storage, the aircraft was bought by Vickers Armstrong in 1950. MJ627 was one of the Spitfires converted to a TR9 and sent to the Irish Air Corps, before retiring in 1960. The Bayliss family breathed life into the old girl, when she was fully restored and took to the skies again in 1993, exactly 50 years since she first flew.\n\nImagine what it'll be like to sit under your bubble canopy in the rear cockpit, waiting with bated breath as the Merlin engine kicks into life on the apron. You can choose from a flight over the Weald of Kent, Leeds Castle, the White Cliffs of Dover, or Beachy Head for these amazing Spitfire flights out of Biggin Hill.\n\nWhichever flight path you head out on, we're sure the day you got to fly in a TR9 Spitfire out of historic Biggin Hill and through the Kentish skies, will be indelibly inscribed in your mind and your heart forever. Buy your voucher for your very special two-seater Biggin Hill Spitfire flight online now."
