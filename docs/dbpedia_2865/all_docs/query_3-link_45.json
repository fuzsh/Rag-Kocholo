        "text": "Too true! It is also a disgrace that the listed buildings in the West Camp are slowly deteriorating because the present owner doesn't seem to do any maintenance on them. The Fighter Pens on the east side of the airfield could also do with some attention as well as the wooden sheds hidden in the undergrowth over that side.\n\nRegards,\n\nDan\n\nNew\n\nScrambles had gone downhill in recent years, (since the previous owner sold it) the food was awful and the place filthy, basically it went a bit chavvy. It was a shame to pull the building down as it was used during the war, although I don't know what for. The previous owner has opened a new cafe further into Biggin Hill, it's called The Spitfire, the food is good but the tea tastes just the same as it always did - bloody awful.\n\nThere is still a very rare original wooden dispersal hut on the airfield from the Battle of Britain, but it's so knackered, it's now unsafe to enter. I have some photos of it. What a piece of history, very eerie to look through the windows an imagine what went on.\n\nThings like this should be saved as there are few left.\n\nNew"
