        "text": "Biggin Hill or ‘Biggin on the Bump’ as it is affectionately known is synonymous with the RAF station that was based there from 1917 and the early days of the Royal Flying Corps to October 1992 when the last connections to the RAF were closed down. There is still Biggin Hill International Airport based there and you can still see planes flying in and out across the valley.\n\nGrowing up in Bromley, and with many family connections in Biggin Hill, I have many fond memories of visiting the Biggin Hill Air Fair, seeing the Harrier Jump Jet ‘bow’ to the crowd, the Vulcan Bomber shake the ground under my feet as it soared into the sky and the Red Arrows skimming across the top of the hill as they came into land.\n\nThe St George’s Chapel of Remembrance stands on the site as a memorial to the air crews who died flying from Biggin Hill in the Second World War, there are 455 names inscribed on the altar that come from 52 squadrons. Winston Churchill described Biggin Hill as the ‘strongest link’ in a chain of airfields that protected London.\n\nThe current Chapel was built in 1946 to replace a military Chapel that was destroyed by fire, its parquet floor is composed of laminated timber strips cut from propeller blades. Inside the chapel are 12 stained glass windows designed by Hugh Easton, best known for his Battle of Britain Memorial Window in Westminster Abbey. Seven windows contain the badges of Squadrons who served at Biggin Hill during the Battle of Britain, there are also portraits of the Spitfire and Hurricane. If you look very closely you can also find a tiny ‘mosquito’ in the glass perhaps in reference to the de Havilland Mosquito which was used by the RAF, but its full significance is a bit of a mystery.\n\nThe ‘Gate Guardians’ are a well known site for those driving into Biggin Hill, a replica Spitfire and Hurricane. They each have individual dedications – the Spitfire represents a plane flown by Geoffrey Wellum, one of the youngest pilot to fly in the Battle of Britain, and the Hurricane represents a plane flown by Pete Brothers.\n\nWith so much history attached to the site is is not surprising that the Chapel hit the headlines in 2015 after the Ministry of Defence tried to offload it to save themselves £50,000 a year in running costs. It has been a complicated and at times controversial journey to save the site but supporters of the Chapel and the London Borough of Bromley finally opened a new museum with funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund in January 2019.\n\nWhilst it is often the stories of fighter pilots that garner all the attention there are other lesser-known stories that deserve equal attention. The museum’s new exhibition focuses on the remarkable untold stories of the women based at Biggin Hill during the Second World War.\n\nThe WAAF – Women’s Auxiliary Air Force was established in June 1939 and by July 1943 reached a peak strength of 182,000. By 1945 250,000 women had served in the WAAF in over 100 different trades and yet we rarely hear about their dedication and commitment.\n\nOnly 6 Military Medals were given to women during WWII for ‘exceptional service’ and 3 of those medals were given to women serving at Biggin Hill in the Control Room. On the 31st August 1940 the worst day in the history of Biggin Hill unfolded in the midst of the Battle of Britain when a trench shelter took a direct hit and 39 people were killed, the youngest just 20. Corporal Elspeth Henderson, Sergeant Helen Turner and Sergeant Joan Elizabeth Mortimer stayed at their posts even though everyone was ordered to take shelter in order to stay in touch with Fighter Command. Joan even ran outside as bombs fell to mark unexploded devices with red flags.\n\nThere are a number of personal objects belonging to the women on display including a replica of Mortimer’s Military Medal, the recasting of the original award after she fell on hard times and sold it to a ‘rag and bone man’ in 1960.\n\nThe exhibition also explores the contribution women made to the ATA – Air Transport Auxiliary, at the press view I spoke to Jackie Moggridge’s daughter, Candida Adkins, who told me about her mother’s love of flying and the prejudice she faced as one of the first 5 women to receive full RAF wings in the 1950s. Moggridge was one of a number of ATA pilots who would deliver Spitfires, Mosquitos and Hurricanes to bases all over the country.\n\nAdkins pointed out Moggridge’s ferry pilots notes she would use to get to grips with different planes as she didn’t get a chance to fly the same plane each time but had to have a working knowledge of different cockpits for each journey.\n\n“…I got out the Tempest pilot’s notes and refreshed my memory before starting up. Heads shook disapprovingly at this cavalier treatment of the mighty Tempest. Enjoying the effect, I propped the book up agains the windscreen and pretended to read whilst starting up and taxi-ing…”\n\n“Spitfire Girl – My life in the sky by Jackie Moggridge”\n\n1 in 8 ATA pilots were female and it was a dangerous job, in total 174 men and women pilots died, around 10% of those who flew for the ATA. Remembered in the exhibition are First Officer Dora Lang and Flight Engineer Janice Harrington who were killed on 2 March 1944 while delivering a De Havilland Mosquito MKVI.\n\nSo often missed out of the history books the impact and active involvement of women in World War II is often under represented in museums and it is a great opportunity to learn more at the Biggin Hill Memorial Museum which has such rich stories to share. It is worth bearing in mind that the WAAFs were paid just two-thirds of the wages of the male counterparts and had to combat social expectations and stereotypes alongside their ground breaking roles.\n\nAlongside the exhibition there is an opportunity to try out a VR Spitfire experience (Fridays and Saturdays during the school holidays £3.00 per person). The museum also has a cafe and a number of family activities on over the summer.\n\nWhilst the Chapel has been saved and a museum has begun to tell the story of Biggin Hill there are still a number of buildings that capture the RAF history that are on Historic Englands’ Heritage At Risk Register with no current solution to secure their future.\n\nxxxxxxxx\n\nThe Biggin Hill Memorial Museum is open Tuesday – Sunday for more details please see the website – https://bhmm.org.uk/\n\nWomen & War: Hidden Heroes of World War Two runs till spring 2023.\n\nThis exhibition received funding through the Association of Independent Museums (AIM) Biffa Award History Makers Programme https://aim-museums.co.uk/aim-biffa-award-support-new-exhibition-biggin-hill-memorial-museum/\n\nSources\n\nSpitfire Girl – My Life in the Sky by Jackie Moggridge published by Head of Zeus https://www.jackiemoggridgespitfiregirl.com/\n\nGhosts of Biggin Hill by Bob Ogley published by Froglets Publications https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-ghosts-of-biggin-hill/bob-ogley/9781872337463"
