        "text": "Unreliable service and unprofessional staff\n\nIf I could give negative star reviews, I would. Our flight was a complete disaster. We had to transit through Biggin Hill. A transit that would last all of 20 minutes, without us ever leaving the airport. We spent months figuring out regulations, liasing with both Biggin Hill and the British Government. Biggin Hill never gave us a clear answer, although the government did. We called them and wrote to them several times, but they never reverted back. Extremely unprofessional.\n\nOn the day of our flight Biggin Hill told us we do not meet regulations, the exact opposite of what the Government told us. We worked with the Government, who told Biggin Hill they had to relent, but Biggin Hill lied to us and told us that the Government told us we cannot fly. If we hadn't personally checked the regulations, and spent all day figuring out regulations with the government agent, we would have believed Biggin Hill's bold-faced lie. Eventually the Government forced Biggin Hill to reluctantly relent and let us through.\n\nWhen we got there Biggin Hill staff was extremely callous, unprofessional and made sure we got the message that we weren't welcome there. They refused to admit that they misinterpreted information from the Government, and that they had lied to us about what the Government told them.\n\nPhone calls with Biggin Hill agents, when they did finally pick up, were an ordeal. They insulted us and put the phone down. They even implied that we were terrorists (we are Asian), so they are racist too, apparently.\n\nI would never ever set foot back there again. This place should be closed down, because clearly the stuck-up staff does not know how to work with clients, and they do not know how to do their job."
