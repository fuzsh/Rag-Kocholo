This is so that we can offer the most bespoke and exclusive service every time. When you charter a private jet with Admiral Jet the price for an aircraft does not change, whether you fly alone or with every seat occupied, apart from the amount of airport passenger tax applied to the flight. Each country has different regulations for the passenger tax applied.\n\nWhat’s the difference between private jet charter and fractional ownership?\n\nPrivate jet charter involves paying to use an aircraft when the owner is not using it. This is normally a one-off charter agreement with no long-term financial commitment. The owner may be an individual or a business. Fractional ownership involves sharing the full cost of purchasing and operating an aircraft. Chartering a private aircraft is by far the most cost-effective and convenient way to travel by private jet. However, with Fractional Ownership you will be responsible for paying all the costs listed.\n\nYour preferences\n\nWhich kinds of aircraft could I charter?\n\nWe have access to charter the following aircraft for you; Turbo Props , Very Light Jets, Light Jets, Midsize Jets, Super Midzise Jets, Heavy Jets, Long Range Jets, VIP Airliners and Commuter Aircraft\n\nCan I see photos of the actual private jets included in the quote for my flight?\n\nEach private jet flight quote we provide includes images of the actual aircraft we are offering, the images are not generic. This enables you to see the exact seating arrangements, gives you a sense of space inside the private jet, and allows you to visualise your trip.\n\nI only want to fly on a brand new aircraft, is that possible?\n\nIf you would like to travel on the very latest private jet aircraft, then simply let us know the maximum age of the aircraft that you would like to book. We will be able to provide a quote to fulfil your specific criteria.\n\nAt the Airport\n\nCan we use any airport?\n\nPrivate jets tend to land at regional airports, avoiding slot delays at major airports. For example, rather than landing at Heathrow or Gatwick, we might use Biggin Hill or Farnborough airport to keep your journey running smoothly. There is great flexibility in where we can land so we can work with you on this to get you from A to B smoothly.\n\nWhere do I need to go once at the airport?\n\nMost larger airports will have a dedicated private terminal with VIP lounges for you to enjoy. Your Personal Account Manager will confirm the exact location in your flight itinerary pack.\n\nWhat is an FBO?\n\nA Fixed-Base Operator (FBO) provides ground support services to private jet operators and their passengers. These services include everything from fuelling, aircraft handling, hangar storage, maintenance, and concierge services. In short, an FBO is like a one-stop-shop for everything a private jet operator needs on the ground. FBOs are typically found at private airports and offer a luxurious experience for passengers and crew.\n\nDo I get a use of a VIP terminal?\n\nYes, private air travel means private terminals for you and your group. Private jet terminals offer a high level of privacy and security for passengers. Avoid the crowds in the discretion of a private terminal.\n\nCheck in and security\n\nHow does check-in work?\n\nMost airports have dedicated private jet check-in facilities. These are normally provided by specialist handling agents (often called FBOs). Admiral Jet will send you detailed directions to the airport facilities.\n\nHow long before my flight do I need to check in?\n\nYou can arrive as early as 15 minutes before departure.\n\nWill I have go through security?\n\nYes, in most cases you would go through security in the private terminal.\n\nDo I still have customs/ immigration when travelling by private jet charter?\n\nCustoms and immigration procedures must be complied with for all private jet flights. Private jet customers are often not aware of any checks as in most cases these can be completed prior to the flight. At larger airports the private jet terminal will have dedicated customs and immigration staff.\n\nWhat documents will I need?\n\nThe same as you would need for a commercial flight, valid passport and in some cases a visa. Your Personal Account Manager will let you know if you need a visa for the country you are visiting.\n\nOnce on Board\n\nHow many pilots will there be on my aircraft?\n\nAdmiral Jet always recommends that you have 2 pilots on every flight – indeed this is often a legal requirement depending on the type of aircraft. There are some examples of when only having one pilot is acceptable, such as daylight helicopter flights.\n\nHow many pieces of luggage can I bring?\n\nThe size of aircraft dictates the amount of luggage that can be carried on board. If you are travelling with items outside of usual suitcases such as skis or golf clubs or any other items – let your personal account manager know and we will ensure that your aircraft is suitable to carry all your items needed for your trip.\n\nWill there be Wi-Fi?\n\nSome aircraft will have WI-Fi capability.

It is a legal requirement to remove all ice and snow before departure from any aircraft. This is the only cost that is not included in the price of your charter and will be invoiced to you after the flight.\n\nAre Private Jets Safe?\n\nYes. Private jet owners and operators prioritise safety and invest heavily in the maintenance and upkeep of their aircraft. This ensures that they are in optimal condition at all times. Private jets operate under strict regulations set by aviation authorities. These are the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in Europe and the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. These regulations stipulate mandatory inspections, maintenance checks, and repairs for private jets to ensure that they meet safety standards before they can be cleared for take-off.\n\nIs the air clean on a private jet?\n\nThe air on board private jets is filtered through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. These block over 99% of airborne particles over 0.3 micron in size. Systems will vary slightly by aircraft. Some aircraft draw in 100% fresh air while some systems mix fresh air with recirculated. Whichever system your aircraft has you will always have a clean private jet.\n\nWhat if I leave something behind?\n\nLeaving items behind when travelling happens, if you realise you have left some belongings, let the team know as soon as possible and we’ll do our upmost to try and help locate your items.\n\nPassenger experience\n\nWhat to expect during your flight\n\nSit back and relax and absolute comfort and luxury during your private flight.

For example, very light jets with short flight durations may not have toilet facilities. Longer range jets will do. If toilet facilities are required on your flight, do let the team know and we will ensure the aircraft offered have toilet facilities.\n\nCan you sleep on a private jet?\n\nSome of our ultra-long-range jets are capable 12-hour flights or more, and so there’s a considerable emphasis on comfort and style. Some of these aircraft convert into a private a master bedroom, with a double bed and all the extra comfort items that you would expect in a 5-star hotel making sure you get the best possible rest. It’s an essential part of any long journey and we would try and encourage you to make the most of it.\n\nCan I bring my dog?\n\nYes! In most cases this is possible, and it is one of the benefits of choosing to charter a private jet. Your Personal Account Manager will confirm what documents you will need. Generally speaking , they will need a pet passport, their rabies vaccination history and a microchip.\n\nCan I smoke or vape on board?\n\nYou can bring your electric cigarette on board the flight if you want, but please don’t use it.
