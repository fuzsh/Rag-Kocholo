        "text": "Club correspondent Jon Wiggins reports\n\nTell us about your day at the Heritage Hanger\n\nIt was around 2pm when the cloud lifted for us. Suddenly it was a beautiful day with a blue, Battle of Britain sky. And the Spitfires were thundering – just an incredible noise. But the team communicated every part of the process, so I wasn’t as as nervous as I thought I’ d be. As soon as we were in the air, it was like every cliché brought to life. All those boyhood dreams, but a reality. Genuinely once-in-a-lifetime stuff.\n\nWhat was the most jaw-dropping moment?\n\nI had headphones on and so I could hear the pilots communicating and everything going on. Then, as we flew over Beachy Head and the channel, the radio was turned off. And, no word of a lie, it was the most tranquil thing I’ ve ever experienced. The light broke through the clouds. You’ re floating. I’ m obsessed with military history and I couldn’t help but think that this was the same passage that young guys would have taken during the war. But they didn’ t know what was on the other side. I found I became very grateful for a lot of things very quickly. Even though you’re up in the air, it really brings you down to Earth .\n\nDid you get to fly the Spitfire?\n\nFor about 30 seconds, yes. Anna, the pilot, let me fly and said to me, “Just let go of everything, it’ll look after you, she’ll look after you.” And it just levelled out. It’s such a beautiful bit of kit. I thought to myself, this is why people say it’s the only machine with a spirit, with a soul.\n\nClub correspondent Jon Wiggins reports\n\nWhat was it like flying in tandem?\n\nIt’s nothing you could ever experience on a commercial air flight. The other Spitfire is flying right next to you, the wings are almost touching. Let’ s say you’ re on the motorway – it’ s like you’ re in lane one, and they’ re in lane three. I could make eye contact with the passengers in the other aircraft and could see their facial expressions.\n\nDid you do any aerobatics?\n\nWe did a victory roll. So you fly level and you lose some ground, then throw the throttle and barrel roll all the way around – 360°. That’ s when you really feel the power of this 1,200-horsepower machine.\n\nSpot anything cool during the hangar tour?\n\nFirst of all, our guide knew everything. Everything and anything. It was so impressive and informative. As a military history fan, I loved seeing the Spitfire Mark I (there would eventually be 19 marks in total) that had been dug up from a field somewhere and was being worked on as we visited. Steve McQueen’ s jeep was pretty cool, too.\n\nSpeaking of history, Peter knows more than most (perhaps indeed, more than anybody) about the life and times of the legendary Spitfire, having turned his teenage enthusiasm for the aircraft – which started at a local air show in the early 1980s – into his life’s passion. “Everyone knows of the Spitfire, but I wish everyone could know more about its roots,” he enthuses. “It’s a machine of Britain, through and through, and each one has its own story to tell. These are the stories we love telling here at the hangar.”"
