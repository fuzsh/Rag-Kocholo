        "text": "BBGA is delighted to introduce aerospace engineering student Nick Danner via our media partner The Emerald Network. Nick (19) has agreed to contribute some insightful observations on a regular basis from a student’s viewpoint as he starts his educational journey towards a career in aviation.\n\nThere was a buzz about the hangar when I arrived at the London Biggin Hill Airport Careers Day last week, writes Nick Danner. Eighty-plus guests had registered. London Biggin Hill Airport and its resident companies Bombardier and luxury private charter helicopter operator, Castle Air, were represented, along with new boutique hotel, The Landing, TalentView and the BBGA. It was my first visit to the renowned, dedicated business aviation airport and I was immediately drawn to the machines on display, including the iconic Spitfire; BAe 146 (that I’d flown in as an Air Cadet) Learjet 45; a shiny Agusta Westland AW139 from Castle Air; a sustainable aviation fuel truck; fire engine and a Case IH tractor.\n\nOpening the event, David Winstanley, CEO at London Biggin Hill Airport, explained how he had started his aviation career as a ramp agent at Servisair, had gone through a number of career changes before securing his current role. Very inspiring, I thought. All ages were encouraged to seek a career in business aviation, he said, stressing that was a growing and successful industry to join. Biggin Hill (which is now the number one business aviation airport for movements I was told) has survived the testing times of Covid and continues to grow. There is a rich history of aviation innovation at Biggin Hill and business aviation itself is all about innovation and change, he said. David concluded by saying: “I love my job and I love my industry.” What more could you want from a career?\n\nLindsey Oliver, Managing Director of BBGA added: “There are thousands of roles in business aviation… it’s not only about becoming a pilot,” (a role I had been considering myself). Some 150k flights in 2019 were by executive aircraft – 6% of the total, she said. In a business aviation career, you can be located around the world, it’s varied, you would typically work for a smaller organisation with career progression.” That was a major part of the appeal highlighted by those I spoke to.\n\nMagician at Hamleys toy store to ramp manager\n\nOne of the Biggin Hill sales managers told me how he had started as a ramp agent and had quickly progressed up the ladder. Career changes didn’t seem to be barrier to entry either. Another ramp handler I spoke to had previously been a magician at Hamleys! I was struck how everyone seemed contented and positive about their work.\n\nI met Richard Smith, Engagement Director for Aviation at TalentView TRS www.talentview.org who highlighted its government-backed database created to help young people join the industry. TalentView has spun out of the Aviation Retention Scheme Programme (ARSP) launched in 2021 to encourage people who previously worked in aviation to rejoin the industry, post Covid. Great jobs and great opportunities exist on the platform he said. Age wasn’t a barrier either, with those in their 60’s encouraged to apply. “The industry has pressed the reset button,” he said.\n\nBusiness aviation OEM Bombardier, who are expanding their MRO facility at London Biggin Hill Airport are offering an apprenticeship programme for aviation maintenance students – apply in June to start next September, I was told. Castle Air directed me to opportunities at their base at Gloucestershire Airport which is close to my current base at UWE Bristol.\n\nOverall, I was struck by the range of opportunities on offer in business aviation and the enthusiasm I’d felt from those I’d met. I had gone to find out more about this side of the industry, to see what might be best for me when I complete my aerospace engineering degree.\n\nI was excited by what I’d heard – lots of opportunities and thousands of roles. Biggin Hill sounds like a great place to work and Bombardier really impressed me. Castle Air is definitely one I’ll check out too. I left with very positive vibes and a sense of excitement for what lies ahead. Thank you, London Biggin Hill Airport."
