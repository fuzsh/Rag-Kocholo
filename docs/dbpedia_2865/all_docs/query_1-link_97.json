        "text": "Aircraft including 18 Spitfires and six Hurricanes have flown over south-east England to mark 75 years since the Battle of Britain's \"Hardest Day\".\n\nThe event recalled 18 August 1940, when Bromley's Biggin Hill and other South East military bases came under attack from the German Luftwaffe.\n\nIt became known as the \"hardest day\" as both sides recorded their greatest loss of aircraft during the battle.\n\nThe Battle of Britain lasted throughout the summer of 1940.\n\nWhat a sight. Watching those iconic World War Two aircraft take to the skies above Biggin Hill was something to behold. Spectators gasped as they then circled the airfield in formation.\n\nThe roar of the Merlin engines and the grace with which the Hurricane and especially the Spitfires, climb, bank, dive and weave through the air is a joy to behold.\n\nAll the aircraft have now landed with spectators invited to see them up close and take pictures.\n\nAnd although they are beautiful to look at on the ground, it is in the sky where they truly shine.\n\nThe Hardest Day commemorations in pictures\n\nHe said: \"I don't think I was ever afraid. You've got to make sure you don't get too enthusiastic. You couldn't take on the German air force by yourself.\n\n\"It's lovely to see these aircraft. Beautifully designed aircraft and there's no doubt about it. The people who made them... they did a good job.\"\n\nWill Curtis, managing director of Biggin Hill Airport, said it was remarkable that the Spitfire was \"still a joy to fly\", adding that \"real credit\" goes to its designer RJ Mitchell.\n\nHe said: \"It is as finely tuned and as well-balanced, if not better balanced, than a modern aircraft.\"\n\nThe day was marked with three flight formations, which took off from the airport at 13:00 BST:"
