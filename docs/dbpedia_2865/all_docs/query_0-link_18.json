        "text": "About six miles from my home, where London meets Kent, is one of the most famous Second World War airfields, Biggin Hill. When I was very young, I was fascinated by the Spitfire and Hurricane standing by the gates to the site. Those real planes are long gone and now fibreglass replicas stand in their place. During World War Two, Biggin Hill was one of the principal fighter stations protecting London and south-east England. Over the course of the war, fighters based there claimed 1,400 enemy aircraft, at the cost of the lives of 453 Biggin-based aircrew.\n\nThe airfield was originally opened in 1917. During WWI, 141 Squadron was based at Biggin Hill, equipped with Bristol fighters, to defend the capital against German Zeppelins and bombers. Biggin also saw its own mutiny in 1919, when technical staff objected to their poor food and living conditions. Between the wars, the airfield was used by a number of experimental units, working on instrument design, ground-based anti-aircraft defences and night flying. The base was closed between 1929 and 1932, during which time reconstruction work took place, including the building of new hangars.\n\nDuring the Second World War the airfield was one of the commanding bases for RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain, with both Spitfires and Hurricanes from a variety of squadrons based there. Between August 1940 and January 1941, the airfield suffered 12 attacks, the worst of which wrecked workshops, stores, barracks, Women’s Auxiliary Air Force quarters and a hangar, killing 39 people on the ground.\n\nFrom 1958, Biggin Hill ceased to be an operational RAF station, becoming the Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre for the RAF. Due to the impending closure of the nearby original London Airport at Croydon, from 1956 much of the civilian light aviation from Croydon relocated to Biggin and it became a joint civilian and military airport. Croydon closed completely in 1959, at which time Biggin Hill became a mainly civilian airport, with only occasional military flying taking place.\n\nToday, RAF Biggin Hill Museum & Chapel is a popular visitor attraction. On the same site is St George’s RAF Chapel of Remembrance, built in 1951 to preserve the legacy of those who served and died at Biggin Hill during the Second World War. The current chapel was created in 1943 when RAF personnel thought it would be appropriate to have a permanent memorial to the increasing number of aircrew who were being killed on operations from within the Biggin Hill sector, remembering especially those who had died in the Battle of Britain. Three prefabricated huts, made with steel angle-iron frames and lined with fibreboard, were acquired and placed together to form a single rectangular unit as a chapel, similar in size and layout to today’s chapel. A commemorative service was held on 19 September 1943 – Battle of Britain Sunday – to unveil and dedicate the Memorial, which takes the form of a reredos (an ornamental screen covering the wall at the back of an altar), and the Book of Remembrance.\n\nThe original chapel was destroyed by fire in 1946 and a new chapel was built in 1951, which is as it is today. The Book of Remembrance holds the names of the aircrew killed flying from the Biggin Hill Sector. The pages are turned daily to the current date, or the closest day to it on which there are names written. If you visit the chapel you will see, behind the altar, on the wall, the names and details of those men killed.\n\nIf, like me, you are not a believer in the religious entities, you will still be struck silent not only by the special atmosphere in the chapel but also the remembrance of all those men who gave up their lives for each and every one of us."
