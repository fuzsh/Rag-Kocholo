        "text": "The Biggin Hill Spitfire Factory is a restoration facility dedicated to returning Spitfires back to the skies. The Spitfire Factory was founded in early 2011 under the name of The Spitfire Company (Biggin Hill) Limited, with the purpose of restoring a single Spitfire MK1 X4650 and subsequently TA805 ‘Spirit of Kent’.\n\nAs of September 2022 it has restored a total of 15 Spitfires to flying condition, with several other projects currently in progress. This warplane workshop is a hive of activity with numerous Spitfires on site along with a 1940 Hawker Hurricane and Battle of Britain veteran Messerschmitt 109 on display.\n\nIn the past up-close access to Spitfires has been available to only the lucky few, but now you can take a tour around our warbird workshop and see at first hand what goes into putting a Spitfire back into the air, how they are maintained and what’s involved in their day to day running.\n\nAs seen on TV’s ‘Warbird Workshop’and ‘Inside The Spitfire Factory’\n\nOur engineers can be seen restoring wings, building fuselages and installing Merlin engines. The techniques used today are the same as those when the Spitfire Factories were in full production mode with hand tooling, riveting and sheet metal work requiring skill and dexterity.\n\nUnlike the 1940’s Spitfire factories we have the luxury of time so can ensure every aircraft that leaves our facility is the very best it can be. Our team utilise as much of the original donor aircraft as possible blended with new ‘old’ stock parts or hand crafted replacement components.\n\nGuided tours of our Spitfire Factory are available every week."
