        "text": "Bromley’s economy is set to benefit an extra £230 million a year if planned changes to London Biggin Hill airport’s opening hours are approved, a new report says.\n\nTown planning consultants Nathaniel Lichfield and Partners said the airport would be able to attract more business and create around 2,300 jobs.\n\nThe report says the borough will feel the benefits by 2030.\n\nIn a consultation last October to which 15,000 people in the borough responded, 12,473 people supported longer opening hours for the airport.\n\nAirport managing director Will Curtis said: “A rising tide lifts all boats. The extra economic activity will result in 2,300 new jobs, which means more wages for local people. It means more aviation companies spending money in the area with small businesses.”\n\nBromley Council has now sent letters to all the borough’s 180,000 households for its own official consultation. The consultation closes on March 13."
