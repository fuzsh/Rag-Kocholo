Throughout each day of this series, I have been drawing stars next to statements made that I felt drawn to. This portion regarding servant leadership made me really master how to draw a star because I drew so many during it. With that being said, it made it extremely difficult to cram everything into one post. Deputy Chief Rusty M., introduced this leadership style by stating the following, “It is not about telling your people what to do, it’s about taking care of your people.” This really connected with me because of how overwhelming important my family is to me. When I say family, it does not only include those who I am blood related to. For me, family extends past that and extends to my police “brothers and sisters”. That was why my departure from the Culpeper Police Department was so hard on me. I developed a bond with my brothers and sisters at that department that made each one of them feel like a part of my family. I have been extremely lucky to be accepted with open arms to the family at the College of Charleston Department of Public Safety. It is very evident that my command staff believe in this leadership style. As I grow in my career in policing, I plan to form my leadership style around this idea. This style can be easily accomplished my making sure you do one simple task. That task is LISTENING. Deputy Chief Rusty M. stated the following, “You were given two ears and one mouth for a reason. You are supposed to listen twice as much.” Officer Ryan Burke, of the Moncks Corner Police Department, stressed the importance of keeping up with not only your mental health but your fellow officers’ mental health. The suicide numbers seen in law enforcement officers can only be described by one word, OUTRAGEOUS. As a leader you are directly impacting those whom you lead. Take that opportunity to provide them with a positive atmosphere and build trust with them. Having that trust built between you and those you lead will open a line of communication. That line of communication could potentially save a life. A requirement for this class was to create a presentation on a leadership book. I crafted my presentation around the book titled, “Leading Beyond Tradition”, which was written by Chief William Cooper. This book was about how to modernize leadership in law enforcement. This book also provided the idea of continuous improvement. I closed my presentation by asking the following question, “Throughout the years of law enforcement, a classic phrase that is often said during trainings is get off the “X”. Why do law enforcement leaders have such a hard time implementing that into their leadership?” The amount of knowledge I have gained about leadership the past three days was undeniably the best experience I have had in this career. Part of my Culpeper Police Department family is pictured below."
