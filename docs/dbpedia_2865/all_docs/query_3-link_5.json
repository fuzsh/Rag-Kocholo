        "text": "Our ambition is to secure our future as a world class business aviation centre of excellence, investing in the airport estate and infrastructure to create job opportunities for Bromley residents and provide an economic boost to the region.\n\nSince our operating hours were changed in 2015, the airport has attracted tens of millions of pounds of investment from new and expanding businesses, creating hundreds of high-quality, well-paid jobs and is now one of Bromley’s largest employers.\n\nLondon Biggin Hill will always have a rich history founded on its legendary role in the Battle of Britain, but it now combines this with leading-edge aerospace technology businesses.\n\nOur Ecosystem\n\nOver the last decade, sustained investment in new hangars and infrastructure has attracted global business, and there are today over 70 companies employing more than 1,700 people on the 500-acre site.\n\nResident companies include Bombardier and F1 – both major tech innovators employing highly skilled engineers, interns and apprentices.\n\nBusinesses that call London Biggin Hill home\n\nOur ecosystem is founded on opportunities that exist for these companies – plus new ones who will join them – to grow and capitalise on new and expanding markets. The future of aviation is a world away from its polluting, slow moving past – it is rapidly embracing pioneering technologies that will make the industry cleaner, greener and quieter, achieving net zero carbon by 2050.\n\nWorking together with the London Borough of Bromley, we aim to lead this revolution from our special corner of south east London, for the benefit of our community. Thereby creating jobs and prosperity for local people, while building a sustainable aviation hub.\n\nIntroducing electric aircraft\n\nHaving been developed over the last 10 years or more, electric aircraft are now gaining certification with the first passenger flight expected to take place in 2025. The vehicles take off and land vertically, are fully electric and noise studies show they are significantly quieter than a helicopter.\n\nCritical mass is not expected until 2035, however planning for and accommodating this growth must start now, if London is not to miss out.\n\nFor London Biggin Hill Airport, these aircraft will begin to complement, then replace helicopters, and then, eventually, light aircraft.\n\nA greener business\n\nThe future of the airport will combine a mixture of the established industries, brought up to a modern standard and new industries, utilising new technologies. Biggin will remain a home base, a gateway for London (and Europe) and centre of excellences as an aircraft service centre.\n\nHowever, new fuel technology will mean that the aircraft (and other vehicle movement around and to the airport) will be quieter and emissions will be reduced – the Airport will operate as it has always done, but as a cleaner, greener and leaner business.\n\nRead more about our sustainability strategy"
