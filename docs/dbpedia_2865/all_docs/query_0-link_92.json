        "text": "Thanks Tuck1940.\n\nGuys please follow the link and add your comments, surely this is winnable.\n\nThere was a lot of opposition to the expansion and I attended one of the meetings to give it support as a way of keeping the airfield active and not lost to housing developers who are very keen to get their hands on this prime peace of real estate. I hope I do not regret that now.\n\nMy post\n\n\"The important words here are \"London Borough of Bromley with a view to it being restored for use as a museum, this was not found to be economically viable. \" Why does honouring the Few have to be economically viable? It should be a condition of the development that both the hut and pen are fully preserved for future generations. Put your landing fees up to cover the cost if necessary. Several years ago I attended the meetings about expansion to support them. No mention was made of destroying the heritage of the site. Preserving the heritage of the site is part of your responsibility while you make use of the airfield, you are but transient custodians of history.\"\n\nDevelopers are forced to build subsidised housing, sorry \"affordable\" housing, as part of granting planning permission and supermarkets are often required to make infrastructure improvements in order to obtain planning permission. If the will was there this could be done.\n\nThe hut should be preserved \"as is\" not fully rebuilt with just the name tag surviving!\n\nNew\n\nTypical of a world handed over to Accountants, where every dollar has to be justified and every \"Public Service\" has to at least break even. Government has become a \"business\"\n\nthat needs to show a profit and most large businesses spout at great length about the small size of their \"Eco Footprint\" and put a dollar value on their \"Corporate citizenship\" whilst\n\nshifting their workforce to $2.50 an hour Chinese sweatshops.\n\nWhy on earth would some crumbling old buildings have the least bit of relevance to anyone?? Far better to use the space to erect mobile phone towers to give that extra 9th bar of\n\nreception to those stumbling drunk off a private jet and desperately requiring it to call for some chips at 0330 on a Sunday morning.\n\n(and before anyone leaps to defend Accountants and say I'm being unfair, I've been one for the last 30 years)\n\nNew\n\nThe fact that they have been demolished does not mean it was the correct thing to do. We have a nasty habit of destroying things in this country when we see no value in them and then regretting it years later.\n\nThe Euston arch pulled down and chucked in a canal now being recovered with the intention of restoring it.\n\nFilled in cuttings on railway lines being dug out to be used again.\n\nThe fall length of the narrow gauge railway from Caernarfon to Barmouth rebuilt almost from scratch and there are many other rail examples.\n\nMany canals that had been filled in have been dug out and restored again even to the extent of building boat lifts.\n\nSteam engines constructed from scratch.\n\nNumerous reconstructions of aeroplanes, some flying. Isn't that partly what this forum is about.\n\nOne thing is for sure if you destroy it it will not be available for future generations to see, surely this is what museums are all about, something tangible rather than in a book or should I say on the net.\n\nThis examples at Biggin may not be truly significant but much of what was significant has already gone.\n\nWhat are we now, 76 odd years on and has it been forgotten? Tangible things like the BBMF and a growing number of memorials help keep the memory alive and it is our responsibility to those who gave their lives to ensure that they are remembered.\n\nThe National Trust have just paid £2M for a cabinet miniature portrait of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1581-1648) to hang in Powis Castle, so surely we can spare just a tiny fraction of that money on a world famous Battle of Britain site to preserve at least something from the actual time that's still left. I am not sure what Lord Herbert did for me but I am damn sure I know what the pilots from Biggin did for me and my children and grandchildren.\n\nNew\n\nA lot of ranting here about the typical stuff that comes up whenever a bit of history may be lost. By that I mean people attacking other things (take fine art in this case) as been unworthy of needing money and that it should go to things like this cause which obviously people on here feel strongly about. That doesn't really help.\n\nInterestingly though no hard facts about the viability of saving the hut and what's actually in it. Doesn't retain original fittings and furnishings? Is it far from its original design. Is it currently accessible and if not can it be made accessible.\n\nMy thought would be that if it can be moved it should be sent to a museum like duxford or Hendon where it can be erected, restored and accessible within the framework of a museum that already has the visitor facilities in place and staff. Making it accessible at Biggin and staffing it will cost a lot. It's not like Scott's hut in that it's preserved perfectly, it's been a scout hut for years. A lot of history has been lost already but actually new history created. Here's a thought, could it be erected at an airfield and used again by pilots?\n\nNew\n\nExcuse me while I fasten the straps on my flak jacket...........There must be a way of remembering our history and those that came before without having to keep everything \"intact\" If we keep all our past where do we put the future? It seems to me that Duxford does a good job of being such a place? Maybe It or something like it could be the repository of such things? move the hut and remember it and the sacrifice it represents? I always remember visiting the Pre-Fab at Duxford why? because I used to live in one, didn't matter that it wasn't in Balham where ours was, it still bought the memory's of child hood back. Seems to me when I was a lad it was all about \"living history\" Now it's all about the interactive experience from the comfort of the millions of little screens across the globe. People don't need to be in the actual place anymore just connected via the internet, once were all gone all this brick and mortar will mean squat to those left, All that will be left will be little blue plaques everywhere and maybe that's the way it should be? Save a few, document whats left and move ahead.\n\nNew\n\nA lot of ranting here about the typical stuff that comes up whenever a bit of history may be lost.

Is it far from its original design. Is it currently accessible and if not can it be made accessible.\n\nBy \"ranting\" you mean putting forward a view illustrated with many examples where we have destroyed something and then spent a lot of money re-instating it.\n\n\"Viability\" yes like Bromley Council saying it is not \"viable\".\n\n\"By that I mean people attacking other things (take fine art in this case) as been unworthy of needing money and that it should go to things like this cause which obviously people on here feel strongly about.\"\n\nNot \"attacking\" or saying \"unworthy\" but drawing comparisons of the different values people put on things and in this case the relatively small amount required. \"fine art\", please!!, I think my mistake with the name was a Freudian slip, the kings clothes come to mind but then maybe I am a Stuckist, but then she would say that wouldn't she.\n\nThe Telegraph critic \" calls Emin a \"phoney\". In 1999 he wrote: \"Emin shows memorabilia amassed during the course of a life marked by promiscuity, rape, abortion, alcohol abuse and financial destitution, but also by phenomenal critical and financial success, achieved by marketing graphic descriptions of her most intimate feelings and degrading experiences as works of art. Billing herself as a modern day Expressionist, Emin brings life — in the forms of videos and things taken from the real world — into the art gallery and leaves it there, more or less unchanged, like unprocessed sewage. . . .What interests me about Emin is not her relentless self-absorption, limitless self-pit or compulsion to confess the sad details of her past life, but that all of this adds up to so little of real interest\".\n\nCraig Brown wrote a satirical piece about My Bed for Private Eye entitled 'My Turd'.:highly_amused:\n\nSeems I am not alone.\n\nI was merely pointing out that what have subsequently been considered \"mistakes\" have been made in the past and maybe, just maybe, we should stop and think about this. If people do not make their feelings known then some aspects, possible alternatives, will not be considered. It would please the locals if the airfield was closed and the site declared a national memorial, perhaps with a grass runway for historic aircraft only.\n\n\"It really doesn't help\". Unfortunately, it has to be. A very bad example is the scaffold wielding protesters in the Poll Tax protest. Certainly not advocating that though.\n\nAd re- rota fingere nobis in generatione generationum?:apologetic:\n\nNew\n\nPaul. It is fine art whether you like it or not. It might not be good fine art but it meets the widely accepted definition of fine art. Look it up. I think you've applied a different meaning of what fine art is. You mistaking 'fine' with an acceptance that something is good. For the record I think it's an interesting piece of art though vastly overrated. But it doesn't wind me up. I don't really like it though. But I'd rather discuss and learn about it than attack it.\n\nI'm not sure why you're going on about the telegraph. You mention the telegraph and in another thread the mail. Fine, enjoy them but you won't get a rich enough variety of sources to form a balanced opinion. You form your own view from a variety of sources surely.\n\nBack to that bed. Some people think it's great. There is no fact here. It's purely down to opinion whether it's good or not. You can quote the telegraph all you want and I'll find you an opposing view. It won't get us anywhere :) I'm not trying to convert you. You can think it's crap if you wish. You don't need to tell me you are not alone. I know you're not. Not the point I was making.\n\nAs for grassing over Biggin Hill and making a memorial. Seriously? This country is full of memorials to various aspects of WW2. How many more are needed before we stop. It's as if some people think the more we build the more we remember.\n\nAs for your Latin. I was never taught Latin and whilst I recognise the odd bit I've given up googling to find out. It seems Latin is used now more as a demonstrative way to aggrandise than as a practical way of communicating.\n\nNew\n\nGetting a little confused here, Wings. We clearly use different dictionaries I usually go for Oxford rather than Urban but there you go. \"Creative art, especially visual art whose products are to be appreciated primarily or solely for their imaginative, aesthetic, or intellectual content\". Thanks for following my contributions to threads. I was quoting the Telegraph purely as an example I like to support my comments with references, where possible. The Mail was, of course, a joke, of which you are well aware. This was not an intellectual debate about researching topics and you should not make assumptions based on so little evidence.\n\nGoing back to that bed, I have already said \" Pulchritudo in oculis aspicientis.:apologetic:. Sorry if that went over your head but I was just going along with the humorous post by Tony. Why are you suddenly being so serious after your comment about me selling my own bed?\n\n\"As for grassing over Biggin Hill and making a memorial. Seriously?\" Yes seriously. Rest not really worth commenting on other than referring you to the recent building of a number of monuments which would seem to indicate that many would not seem to agree.\n\nAs for Latin, Oh dear have we touched a nerve here then, \"aggrandise\". I almost certainly know less Latin than you do. But I like a joke with a bit of work in it.:D\n\nI think we have had a disagreement of opinion before? Which is fine but I am moving on now and will leave you to have the satisfaction of having the last word.;) Absit iniuria.:highly_amused:\n\nNew"
