        "text": "A family-run flight school says it has been asked to leave Biggin Hill Airport after 70 years as the airport focuses on \"more lucrative\" private jets.\n\nFalcon Flying Group, which runs two flying schools on the site, said it was \"heartbroken\" after being given six months to move from the premises.\n\nThe airport, a famed RAF base during the Battle of Britain, called the move \"necessary\" to maintain safety.\n\nA group of MPs has written to the airport, urging managers to reconsider.\n\nGrant Shapps, chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on aviation, called the move a \"short-term decision which is going to damage both Biggin Hill and British aviation in the long run\".\n\nHe said the Boeing Company projected the global aviation industry needed an extra 1.2 million specialist staff, including 500,000 pilots, by 2032.\n\n\"There's a responsibility that goes beyond improving the business model that looks at the future of the whole sector,\" Mr Shapps said."
