        "text": "Workstations: Armour Workbench\n\nThe Lambeth Walk is a small park area nestled in the far Western area of Fallout London's map on the southern side of the river Thames, across from Westminster. You can find it almost directly south of the London Eye ferris wheel, behind the British Lion HQ's parking lot, and just north of the St Peter's Church to the west of the Flak Encampment.\n\nThe settlement features a wide open area comprised of both a parking lot with some cars (which you cannot build on), and a large garden area complete with a small pond, a few defensive walls, and a metal shack with an Armour Workbench, fridge, and bed. There is also a ruined building you can modify the interior of near the main workstation.\n\nThe area itself is easy to defend with its many walls, with a small ramp leading out north toward a car park filled with Hooligans, some ruined buildings to east where the settlement workstation is, and a parking lot's entrance to the south.\n\nBe wary, as there is a high chance that a Radger may spawn into the park area before you can \"clear\" the settlement and activate it.\n\nVauxhall Grove Construction Site Settlement\n\nWorkstations: None\n\nThe Vauxhall Grove Construction Site is a large, wide open construction yard that is chock full of supplies, tools, and constructs to salvage, making it a great place to quickly gather and store materials. You can find it in the far west of London, not far from another Settlement, the Lambeth Walk, just further south down the road, located past St Peter's Church, and just above the Meadow Point Apartments, and just southeast of the US Embassy along the river.\n\nThe settlement includes a very large open space that includes both the main construction site, plus a small road and smaller construction area to the east. Because it features a lot of building foundations, its a great place to make housing on flat surfaces which can be hard to come by in other settlements.\n\nHowever, its wide open design also leaves a lot of holes in your defenses, as the main fence is broken in several places, and there's several flooded areas to the south and to the west that can be a breeding ground for Bloatfiles, Bloodbugs, and other creatures.\n\nLondon Bridge Settlement\n\nWorkstations: Cooking Station\n\nThe London Bridge hasn't quite fallen down yet, and has been repurposed as a sketchy toll crossing by a man named Beefy. You can find the bridge near the dead center of London's region, between the Submarine Dock to the south and the Ferryman's Dock to the north, in between the Tower Bridge and the Southwark Bridge.\n\nAt first, you'll need 10 Tickets to cross the bridge in either direction, and can't make use of the Settlement Workshop... yet. You'll need to pass a few speech checks to get things moving - with 5 Charisma, you can call Beefy out on his scam (if you haven't invested that many points, remember you can use aid items like Beer or Chems to help.\n\nOnce he confesses and lets you in on the scam, you'll have to get him to admit the ugly truth. This one isn't as easy to parse, as you need 8 Intelligence. Luckily, there are also certain skill perks you can invest in, like Heavy Hitter, to intimidate him into revealing his past as a cannibal Beefeater. After this, he'll agree to let you have control of the bridge if you can take out his former cannibal friends across three different outposts.\n\nYou'll find them not far to the east, located in close proximity at the Tower Hill Station, Tobacco Dock, and the iconic Tower Bridge. Each location has an assortment of Beefeater enemies, but you'll want to be sure to loot the Sargeants, as well as the Beefeater Witch at the dock to grab their body parts. Return to Beefy with the loot, and he'll award you all his toll crossing money, plus the collectible record, London Bridge is Falling Down.\n\nThe settlment itself is modest, but easily defensible with its two access points. You'll not only have Beefy to help guard, it, but 6 other Settlers all ready to go, plus several shacks already in place with a small generator. As an added benefit, you can also build below the bridge itself, thanks to the already built scaffolding to the bridge base below. This can let you go wild with some inventive designs to create a base above as well as below the bridge.\n\nCovent Garden Settlement\n\nWorkstations: None\n\nThe Covent Garden is an outdoor plaza that's technically inside an enclosed space within Fallout London, located in the northwest of the region across the river across Waterloo Bridge, and east of Trafalgr Square, just to the west of both The Strand and Bush House. The easiest path to reach it is by crossing the Waterloo Bridge northeast of the London Eye ferris wheel, taking a left down the street after crossing the bridge, then right to find a door to the square.\n\nThe settlement is the home of a large Hooligan encampment, and you'll need to clear out everyone before its cleared to be used as a settlement. Be prepared for a lengthy firefight across its large grounds.\n\nCovent Garden is a large outdoor area behind a large building on its west side, featuring a big plaza with rows of small ruined shops and buildings in the middle where the Settlement Workstation is located in, alongside many other small empty shop rooms. There are also a few flooded moats running along these shops.\n\nAlong its outskirts, you can find two wooden defensive shacks in both the northeast and southeast, and in one of the wooden shacks, you'll find a collectible record, \"I've Wandered the Wastes\".\n\nTennis Museum Settlement\n\nWorkstations: None\n\nThe Tennis Museum is a large wide open area that includes a vast section of enclosed tennis courts found far in the southwestern region of Fallout London. You can find it by exiting the city and traveling southwest of the large Wimbledon Park Lake, and directly south of the Chain Home Radar.\n\nThe settlement is fairly expansive, including both many fenced off tennis courts that can be modified into home areas, as well as several bleachers, and the main stands with the actual \"museum\" below it where the workstation is located, which is comprised of a spacious (though unfurnished) two level interior that's easy to build a storehouse inside.\n\nYou may have to get rid of more than a few Feral Ghouls to clear out the Tennis Museum, which can also include a dangerous Glowing One inside the museum under the main stands itself.\n\nBiggin Hill Airport Settlement\n\nWorkstations: Cooking Station\n\nThe massive Biggin Hill Airport is a large druid encampment that's secreted away in the far southeast outside the city of London, and is fairly isolated due to its location. It sits east of the giant lava-filled maze of Croydon and Brickton, and south of the giant walls that surround Lewisham, and is also separated from Bromley in the southeast corner by a giant fissure that's hard to get over.\n\nEven reaching the airport won't be enough, as you'll have to assist the Elder Druid Gordo (or Gordon) with a few tasks before you gain the privilege of using their settlement workshop.\n\nYou'll need to complete the lengthy Side Quest, Gordon's Alive, which involves both clearing out a Dryad nest to the west, and delving into a hidden bunker below the Bromley Pindar on the southern edge of the airfield. Once you've completed the quest, wait for at least 2 days before returning to Gordo, and he'll name you Head Druid to help run things.\n\nUnfortunately, you won't exactly get access to tinker with all of the Airport's vast sprawling area. A small shack on the north side will activate the workstation, but only give you a modest flat ground nearby and a pool of water to work with. This means you won't be able to tinker with the nearby windmill, the Druid's Circle, or their vast farm that includes fields of crops, and an entire hangar devoted to livestock."
