        "text": "This is Notre Dame. It took almost 200 years to complete. The architecture is nothing short of magnificent. Reflecting on what it took for this edifice to materialize, I was awestruck. Generations of people toiled. Whole families were born and died without ever seeing it finished. I imagine on that first day when the first workers started construction on it, they did so knowing that no one they had ever known nor anyone their children would know would ever be prayed for in this hallowed space. And even more history would forget that they ever had anything to do with bringing this marvel to fruition. And then on April 15, 2019 what took 200 years and thousands of lives and generations to build was almost destroyed in hours. How humbling is that? And yet, that is the way of everything that has time as a main ingredient. Which, of course, is everything in the phenomenal world whether it is a relationship between two people, a company of thousands, or a concept such as democracy. This is human vulnerability. And it is built into all we come in contact with. When we forget this, we do so to the detriment of our own conscious awareness. Creating under the illusion that anything that you do can last forever and under all conditions is to build on denial of the very thing that makes us human—the awareness that nothing we are a part of will last. And yet, we must give this life everything we have. Considering this, I am reminded of the Romero Prayer by Bishop Ken Untener of Saginaw, who composed it in honor of the martyred Archbishop Oscar Romero, who died in service of the people of San Salvador. It reads: “It helps, now and then, to step back and take the long view. The Kingdom is not only beyond our efforts; it is even beyond our vision. We accomplish in our lifetime only a fraction of the magnificent enterprise that is God’s work. Nothing we do is complete, which is another way of saying that the kingdom always lies beyond us. No statement says all that could be said. No prayer fully expresses our faith. No confession brings perfection. No pastoral visit brings wholeness. No program accomplishes the church’s mission. No set of goals and objectives includes everything. This is what we are about. We plant the seeds that one day will grow. We water the seeds already planted, knowing that they hold future promise. We lay foundations that will need further development. We provide yeast that produces effects far beyond our capabilities. We cannot do everything and there is a sense of liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something and to do it well. It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step along the way, an opportunity for the Lord’s grace to enter and do the rest. We may never see the end results, but that is the difference between the master builder and the worker. We are workers, not master builders; ministers, not messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our own.” What will you build with your life?\n\nIn search of Iron Age Cornwall? Evidence of how Iron Age people lived in Cornwall is abundant and includes some magnificent places that we care for. Carn Euny is a well-preserved example of Iron Age village located near Sancreed, Penzance. The walls, up to a metre high in places, are well-preserved; only the wooden, thatch and turf elements of the houses have gone, leaving it relatively easy to stand in the heart of the village and reconstruct what it must have looked like 2000 years ago. At the heart of the village is the site’s most enigmatic feature - its fogou. A huge underground chamber with a side “beehive” room and creep passage leading off, this use of this impressive structure by its Iron Age builders remains a source of heated discussion between archaeologists and historians. Diverse explanations such as food storage chambers, refuges and meeting places have all been put forward. It is more than likely that they had a mixture of functions, including ceremonial and religious uses. The fogou at Carn Euny is magnificent and a wonderful space in which to speculate quietly about what our ancestors were up to! Often, though not always, these villages had nearby hillforts or cliff castles. We protect some impressive Iron Age hillforts, including Caer Bran in West Penwith and Castle an Dinas near St Columb Major. Hillforts are thought to have been less a military fortress and more a place of focus for the community, symbols of the wealth and power of the tribe, a central place for social ceremonies, trade and ritual. The historic sites we protect are open to the general public and free to enter 365 days a year. Image description: 1.

Smith, which tells the story of the struggle (still ongoing) for the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground (the city of Richmond's 2nd African Burial Ground) and one of Virginia's most endangered historic places: \"Disappearing the Enslaved The Destruction and Recovery of Richmond’s Second African Burial Ground\" Buildings & Landscapes 27 (Spring 2020): 17-45 Abstract The hilltop at the intersection of Fifth and Hospital Streets in Richmond, Virginia, served as the city’s primary burial ground for enslaved and free blacks from 1816 through emancipation, making it one of the longest-serving and most populous burial grounds of its kind in the nation. The site’s early history and active use show its profound role in the lives of the city’s African American residents as well as intimate connections with resident whites buried in adjoining cemeteries. Yet today the burial ground stands as the site of an abandoned gas station, its historic core unrecognized like so many other smaller burial grounds for the enslaved elsewhere. By tracing the process of obliteration at Richmond’s “second African Burial Ground,” this article illustrates how those in power—in this case a New South coalition of government officials, city engineers, and private developers—worked to truncate the highly charged memorial landscape related to human remains. The loss of this immense burial ground, untouched in the scholarly literature until now, underscores how essential the landscape and even human bodies are for the maintenance of social space and memory. As this site continues to face threats by roadway and railway projects and a proposed auction, it poses a key challenge to the concept of material “integrity” at the heart of federal preservation guidelines that have placed such properties at a disadvantage. As descendants and activists work to reclaim this burial ground without benefit of archaeological discoveries, the historic importance of its destruction may offer one of its few ways forward... The article is available here through the Richmond Cemeteries website. https://lnkd.in/gXeyWF6q The Vernacular Architecture Foundation (VAF) awarded \"Disappearing the Enslaved: The Destruction and Recovery of Richmond’s Second African Burial Ground\" the Catherine W. Bishir Prize in 2022 for best article.

The archives are meant to be a safe gathering place for people to learn about their lost families. The Macleod Lake Indian Band of the Tse’khene Peoples have been very dislocated from three trauma’s: Residential Schools, 60’s Scoop and the Bennett Hydro Dam. Their membership is over 400 but only half live on reserve and the others are scattered. They want people to be able to come back to McLeod Lake, find information about their family, family photo’s and genealogical records in the archives. Then they want them to be able to access cultural programs to help with recovery. There will be several types of storage units for both documents and cultural belongings/artifacts. The document storage will be separate from the archival storage so that the climatic conditions (especially humidity) can be managed. During the development of the program circular rooms were requested. One elder wanted a circular platform and semi-circle seating for ceremony and drumming. The narrow site at the corner prevented a circular building. Thus, the building is wrapped in a circular stone wall at the intersection celebrating both the Macleod Lake People, known as the people of the stone, and the importance of the circular form.
