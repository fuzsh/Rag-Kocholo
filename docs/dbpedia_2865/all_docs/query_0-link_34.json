        "text": "Despite the foggy start to the day, Wednesday 30 November saw the clouds lift for business jet manufacturer Bombardier as it unveiled its new London Biggin Hill Service Centre, which began operations in July 2022. The official opening of the new centre (an expansion on Bombardier’s original facility which was opened in 2017) marks the largest business jet maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) facility for business aviation in the UK.\n\nAs the latest addition to the company’s extensive worldwide customer network, the $60 million, 23,225 sq.m. centre (twice the size of Bombardier’s Berlin facility) features a suite of new maintenance and modification capabilities as well as full-service interior finishing capacity for its family of Learjet, Challenger and Global aircraft. The new hangar offers 22 service bays (an increase of 14 bays from the previous offering of 8). And, with an environmentally respectful approach to its design and project development, the entire roof of the new building will also be covered in solar panels in early 2023, while electrical charging stations will build on Bombardier’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.\n\nDescribing the new centre as a “beacon for Bombardier in Europe,” Jean-Christophe Gallagher, Executive Vice President, Services and Support and Corporate Strategy, Bombardier, added: “With the expansion of the London Biggin Hill Service Centre, we are taking another step in showcasing our unwavering commitment to our European customers with industry-leading services on a global scale.”\n\nUnderlining the company’s growth in recent years, Gallagher also noted that Bombardier’s Q3 results show profitability of approximately $210 million (a 48% year-on-year increase) and the company is currently sitting on a $15 billion backlog, which is largely composed of aircraft that are sold for the next two years. “We have a very clear path forward and a solid backlog, so when you combine that resilience on the manufacturing side to the impressive growth of our after market operations, you’re looking at a compnay that’s performing well and we’re very proud of that,” he said.\n\nThe company’s Certified Pre-owned Aircraft programme, which it launched in July 2021 is also showing strong signs of growth, as Gallagher explained, “We are proactively seeking pre-owned aircraft in the global marketplace that we can bring in to our facilities for servicing and retrofitting with the latest and greatest technologies available.”\n\nBombardier, which currently employs 250 people at Biggin Hill and is looking to increase that by another 100 staff over the next 12 months, is the largest tenant at the business aviation hub. “Our ability to service and bring aircraft back into the air as quickly as possible is one of the big reasons customers are happy to come back to us,” said Gallagher. “We have the manpower to work as efficiently as possible so our aircraft can spend their time flying instead of on the ground in maintenance.”\n\nIn addition to heavy maintenance capabilities, the service centre also offers wheel and battery shops and a component paint shop. It can accommodate a variety of aircraft, including up to 14 Global 7500 aircraft at one time, as well as Bombardier’s newly launched Global 8000 business jet when it enters into service in 2025.\n\nAustrian-based aircraft interior manufacturer F/LIST has collaborated with Bombardier on the interior design of its new facility, which features locally-sourced, aviation inspired furnishings in its reception area. F/List is also partnering with Bombardier on the development of the enhanced interior shop at the service centre, which will support and service operations for customers. Meanwhile, business aviation services provider JETEX has been selected to provide FBO services at the centre and will offer concierge services onsite.\n\nBombardier is also working with UK-based Marshall Future Skills to increase apprenticeship and employment opportunities within its Biggin Hill facility. “Our ties with the local community are paramount for us,” said Gallagher. Commenting on the engineering skills shortage in the UK, he added, “Working with local colleges and educational institutions to build a pipeline for the future workforce is key.”\n\nWith the new facility officially inaugurated and business set to boom, Gallagher remained tight lipped about committing to where Bombardier might set its sights on expanding in the future. However he did acknowledge there are obvious gaps in the market, including the Middle East. Watch this space!"
