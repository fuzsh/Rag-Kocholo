The Wireless Testing Park was renamed the Wireless Experimental Establishment, and Aperfield Court, a large house on high ground two miles south of the airfield, was requisitioned. Wireless workshops were set up inside, together with a powerful transmitter for ground-to-air control of fighters defending London from aerial attack. The team at Biggin Hill created the first air to air speech transmission in 1917. White Background In June 1917 the Germans began using aeroplanes to drop bombs o London, twin-engined Gothas and ‘Giants’ (Zeppelin-Staakens).

        "text": "In 1940 Britain stood alone with only the RAF and the English Channel between and expected invasion from the enemy that had marched through most of Europe. In order for an invasion of Great Britain to go-ahead, the German Air Force, known as the Luftwaffe, had to neutralise the RAF and take control of the skies above the south east of England. From the 10th of July 1940 until the 30th of October 1940 the might of the enemy raged overhead in what has been called the ‘greatest aerial conflict ever’. Despite overwhelming odds, the aircrews and groundcrews remained steadfast.\n\nThe Biggin Hill Sector formed a crucial part of Fighter Command’s 11 Group, defending London and the South-East. With three squadrons at Biggin Hill, each flying three to four times a day between July and October, the station saw the departure and return of over 1000 sorties during the battle.\n\nThe role RAF Biggin Hill played in the War is respected around the world and the story of Britain’s most famous fighter station is told through the personal experiences of those who served here and the community that supported them at the RAF Biggin Hill Museum and Chapel.\n\nWe remember with pride and gratitude Churchill’s Few who flew with skill and courage from RAF Biggin Hill throughout the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, supported by dedicated ground crews and operational staff and recognise in particular the key role that they played in securing the defence of the realm and freedom from tyranny.\n\nThe museum is situated on the same site as St George’s RAF Chapel of Remembrance, dedicated to preserving the legacy who served and died at Biggin Hill during the Second World War."
