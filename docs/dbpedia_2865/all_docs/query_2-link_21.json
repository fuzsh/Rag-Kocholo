        "text": "In my earlier post, I'd taken a short flight from KBFI (Boeing Field / King County International Airport) to the small Private Airport of Fall City (1WA6), approximately 20 miles east of Boeing Field. Located just outside of the town of Fall City, this airport is a \"Private Airport Community\". See, below (in shot #1), the large \"PRIVATE\" marking on the Rwy, where the Rwy marking would normally be... (FAA and AirNav sites list the Runways simply designated as \"E/W\" = i.e., \"EAST/WEST\"... 90/270 degrees respectively) ...\n\nThe town of Fall City, though small, actually seems to pack a big punch as a major tourist attraction. It got its name (most likely) due to its location near the (famous) Snoqualmie Falls. The Snoqualmie Falls, a popular tourist hotspot, in all of Washington and beyond, (btw, also of \"Twin Peaks\" drama fame), is where the Snoqualmie river (spectacularly) falls 270 feet down a precipice (see 2 shots of the Snoqualmie Falls, below). The Fall is located just about 4 miles further east of Fall City airport. In fact, I could clearly see the waterfall, immediately after being airborne from the East Runway of Fall City airport. The township, located barely 30 miles from the (large) Seattle metropolis, is scenically tucked-away, and grew up around the Snoqualmie river, that runs twisting around the community (see pictures of the river and the town, in the very last 3 shots, below).\n\nI read somewhere, \"From August through November (i.e., starting just about now), in the RW, it’s possible to see thousands of spawning salmon in the rivers of the Snoqualmie valley. Each fall, \"native\" salmon (i.e., native to Snoqualmie) make the impressive journey all the way from the Pacific Ocean to their birthplaces in these streams and rivers that feed into Puget Sound (Note: Salmon fish always return to the place they were born to lay their own eggs). The native salmon complete this incredible feat thanks to their extremely strong sense of smell, which is about one million times stronger than ours...\"...Oh well...Also, though the salmon can easily swim upstream, the Snoqualmie Falls present a formidable (upstream) barrier for fish, so there are no salmon found above them...but abundantly only in the river below...\n\nOrbx, as usual, has done a great job bringing out an authentic feel of this tiny place (airport and town) ...with plenty of a/c activity, roaming service vehicles, and residential housing, spotted around the airport,..visited, here, virtually, in the Fall Season, but Winter in the town, would surely have its own distinctive appeal. I read in the Orbx introduction, \"...5 seasons color matched imagery...\" and \"...In the fall, you'll see leaves falling from trees onto the ground...\" etc. Though I did not test (and wait for) the \"falling leaves\", I did test the (remarkable) seasonal differences in the color of the trees, for several successive months, across the Fall season...See e.g., the 3 identical (B2B) screenshots below of the same trees in the months of September/November/January. In the fall, the state of Washington is known to glow with the colors of Autumn beginning in late-September...but, for now, these virtual pictures, below, will have to do, for most of us, in lieu of a RW visit in the Fall season... (noting that the Fall colors around the Midwest can also be quite spectacular) ...\n\nHope you enjoy this sample of pictures from (and around) the Fall City Airport. The airport, being privately owned, you'll normally not visit it, as you could any other public airport, except, of course, right here, by virtual means, with yours truly, as the guide...🙂... (On the FAA bulletin, the (1WA6) Airport use is listed as \"Private use. Permission required prior to landing\", and contact information is provided for those of you who may be able to fly in piloting your own (real) a/c into this scenic airport and this quaint little town...) ...Sounds like a place for good fun and great sights...!\n\nThanks for viewing these virtual sights from my tour of Fall City (Washington)...!!"
