        "text": "Regional Airports Limited (RAL) was formed in 1990 to acquire and regenerate smaller airports in the UK following legislation passed in the Airports Act 1986.\n\nThe business and assets of London Southend Airport were acquired in April 1994 and those of London Biggin Hill in May 1994. Both airports were in a rundown and loss making condition.\n\nIn 2008, and after successful and extensive re-development of London Southend Airport, with planning consent for a new railway station and CAA agreement in principle for a runway extension, the business and assets were sold to Stobart Group Limited.\n\nAndrew Walters\n\nAndrew is a former military helicopter pilot and has since become an entrepreneur in the aviation industry. On leaving the Army he founded IML Air Services Group, which operated freight charter services to and from Africa and the Middle East, and developed a network of 150 offices in 35 countries operating as IML Air Couriers. In 1986 he sold the business and went on to found Regional Airports Limited in 1990 after attending the International Senior Management Programme at Harvard Business School\n\nJock Lowe\n\nJock is a distinguished former Senior Concorde pilot and Director of Flight Operations for British Airways. Jock joined the Board of RAL in 2002 and was instrumental in helping the company to resolve issues that led to the extension of the runway at Southend Airport considered vital for its future. A former Master of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigator, Jock continues to fly and remains actively involved in aviation projects, management and development.\n\nMichael Del Mar\n\nMichael joined the Board of RAL in 2005 after a long career in the City of London with S.G. Warburg and latterly UBS Investment Bank. Michael has a wide experience of advising both public and private companies on listings, fund raising and acquisitions, and was until recently also on the Board and Chair of the Remuneration Committee of the Johnson Services Group."
