        "text": "\"History \"The airfield was originally opened by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during the First World War. At first in 1916 Koonowla House was requisitioned by the War Office in 1916, for the RFC to conduct wireless experiments. Then on 13 Feb 1917 the RFC transferred there (from their long time HQ at RAF Joyce Green, Dartford, and established it as part of the London Air Defence Area, using the adjacent Cudham Lodge estate which contained a huge undivided field, ideal for aircraft. The station was responsible for defending the capital against attacks by Zeppelins and Gotha bombers. To this end, 141 Squadron of the RFC was based at Biggin Hill and equipped with Bristol Fighters.\"\n\nCreated by: , Jonathan101862"
