        "text": "London Biggin Hill airport has extended its operating hours, effective from May 1.\n\nThe changes will see the airport open from 6.30am to 11pm on weekdays and 8am to 10pm on weekends and bank holidays.\n\nBiggin Hill has witnessed steep growth in business aviation movements over the last year, predominantly due to more activity in the Bombardier and Gulfstream sector of the long-range corporate types.\n\nRobert Walters, business development director at the airport, said, “This extension allows us to accommodate earlier transatlantic flights getting people off and out, be it to London and the City, or Europe for the working day or night.\n\n“Flights from the Middle East can now also take off and arrive in the early morning. We have never been able to do that before.”\n\nThe extended operating hours will bring benefits to customers including lower costs of operating flights through Biggin Hill, no slot restrictions and the fastest transfer to London with the six-minute journey via the London Heli Shuttle service.\n\nThe new hours have launched as construction of an additional 140,000ft² office, hangar and business aircraft parking facility at Biggin Hill begins. Construction of a 50-bed four-star hotel is also planned to start at the airport later this year."
