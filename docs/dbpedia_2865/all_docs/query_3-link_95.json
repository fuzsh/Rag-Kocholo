        "text": "London Biggin Hill Airport is joining the Canadian Business Aviation Association (CBAA) and, for the first time, will exhibit at the organizations’ 2019 convention and exhibition in Calgary, Alta.\n\nThe CBAA is a non-profit association representing more than 400 companies in the Canadian business aviation community. Members span the industry, including operators, management companies, airports and suppliers.\n\nAndy Patsalides, marketing manager at London Biggin Hill Airport, said: “We are proud to be joining the CBAA, Canada’s leading voice for business aviation. Our airport has experienced a significant rise in the number of ultra-long-range jet movements, as more customers from North America choose us as the gateway to London. Connecting with the CBAA’s esteemed members is a natural and important step, ensuring we enhance support to our Canadian customers.”\n\nTaking place from July 9 to 11, 2019, at Calgary International Airport, the annual CBAA Convention and Exhibition brings together the industry’s biggest players for Canada’s top business aviation event. This year’s show includes a full two-day exhibition and static display, as well as informative educational sessions designed to support the business and career goals of delegates.\n\nPatsalides continued: “CBAA’s annual show is the key event in the Canadian bizav industry’s calendar. We are looking forward to being part of next year’s exhibition, and to welcoming professionals from across the country, North America and the world, to our stand.”"
