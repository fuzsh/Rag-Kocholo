        "text": "When the Beatles' Let It Be film premiered in May 1970, it was met with negative reviews and painted a bleak portrait of the world's biggest rock band on the brink of destruction. But as a restored version of the documentary arrives on Disney+ this week, it's poised for a reappraisal — including from Ringo Starr.\n\n\"I was always moaning about the original film, because there was no real joy in it,\" Starr told the Daily Beast. The drummer cited a heavily dissected scene between Paul McCartney and George Harrison, where they snipe at each other while trying to work out a song arrangement.\n\n\"It was all based on this little downer incident,\" Starr said of the argument. \"But that's just how it was; four guys in a room, you know? You're bound to have a few ups and downs.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Peter Jackson Fighting for Extended Cut of 'The Beatles: Get Back'\n\nThe drummer also credited McCartney for keeping the Beatles active during periods of turmoil. \"It was always Paul who would want to get back to work,\" he said. \"I lived near John [Lennon], and so I'd be at his place, lounging and having a bit of a smoke in the garden, and the phone would ring. We'd know even before we answered that it was Paul, saying, 'C'mon, let's get in the studio and make a new record.'\"\n\nRingo Starr Says 'Get Back' Adds Context to 'Let It Be'\n\nBeatles fans finally got a close look into the ill-fated Get Back / Let It Be sessions with the release of Peter Jackson's six-hour Get Back docuseries in November 2021. Starr said that, viewed together, Get Back and Let It Be offer a more complete picture of the band during its most fraught period.\n\n\"Now it's got a start, a middle and a finish. The start is very slow, and then we get into creating, and then we're at it and then we're out,\" he said. \"I love it. But I'm in it, of course, so six hours is never long enough.\""
