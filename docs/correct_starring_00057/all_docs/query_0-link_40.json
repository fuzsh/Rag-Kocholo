        "text": "If you were lucky enough to be young in the summer of 1964, you would’ve been in a movie theater watching A Hard Day’s Night—not just once, but over and over again. Gobsmacked theater managers and frightened ushers (they had ushers in movie houses then) had trouble prying kids from their seats to let in a fresh crop of ticket holders. When you heard from George Harrison’s Rickenbacker that beautiful, thick, clanging chord, hanging in the charged air like a scimitar, you held your breath, and then, suddenly, miraculously, you saw them—running for their lives through the black-and-white streets of London, chased by their fans. Your own heart racing, you felt that the kingdom of youth had suddenly arrived. Who did that? Who drew this picture of the Beatles in their first flush of fame that will never be wiped away from our collective memories?\n\nHis name is Richard Lester, and A Hard Day’s Night was his first big movie. Like Icarus in reverse, he started out near the sun. Where could he possibly go from there?\n\nAs a matter of fact, he followed up with 20 more movies, including The Knack . . . And How to Get It, The Three Musketeers, and Superman II and Superman III, and he influenced a generation of younger directors, such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, Steven Soderbergh. “It’s difficult to convey now exactly how important Lester’s films were,” wrote Scorsese in his appreciation of Help!, prepared for the 2007 DVD release. “Each new picture was eagerly awaited, and they set the style for so much—in commercials, in television . . . and certainly in movies—that it’s easy to take his influence for granted. He was one of the key figures of the era.”\n\nThe real mystery is why this brilliant director abandoned his post at the age of 57, when he made his last feature film, The Return of the Musketeers, in 1989. “I don’t know exactly why he left,” says screenwriter Charles Wood, a longtime friend of the director’s who co-wrote a number of his movies, including Help! “All I know is, it’s a shame, a terrible waste.”\n\nNot only did Lester mysteriously walk away from a vibrant career, he largely stopped giving interviews as well. “I’m not optimistic about his sitting down with you,” his agent told Vanity Fair, in 2008. “He’s a lovely man, but I can’t get him to agree to anything.” However, Lester did finally consent to meet with us at a gastropub near a marina in Chichester, England, on a chilly March morning that year.\n\nTall, lean, aristocratic-looking, now in his 80s, he had gotten in three sets of tennis before lunch (“Mind you, I’m the only one on the court that doesn’t have an artificial hip”). There he was: cheerful, witty, gracious, if a bit reserved, with the slight English accent and impeccable manners of a lifelong expat—he was born and raised in Philadelphia—sharing an elegant lunch of fresh trout and a bottle of sauvignon blanc. Like any good director, he took charge, recommending dishes, ordering the wine, making sure the tape recorder worked. He seemed more like a retired member of Parliament than the man who, 50 years ago, found himself at the center of the youthquake in mod London.\n\n“I think I have an amateur’s approach to filmmaking,” he explains when asked how he started out. “I tried to learn technically, but having never been an assistant, or a cameraman, or an editor. I never saw how anybody else made films. I used to call myself the Rousseau of Twickenham Studios. When Rousseau was shown Cezanne’s paintings, he said, ‘They’re very good. I could finish all those.’ ”\n\nLester—a prodigy who started school at three and went to college at 15—cut his teeth working as a stagehand in Philadelphia during the early years of television. “Nobody knew how to do anything,” Lester remembers. “We were working out of a radio studio and trying to move scenery up the stairs. It was easy to go from stagehand to floor manager, to assistant director, to director, within a year.”\n\nWorking on a set opposite The Ernie Kovacs Show, Lester fell in love with the anarchic comic. Kovacs, with his dark moustache, his Cuban cigars big as smoke stacks, and a voice like burnt toast, was a local legend before taking off for Hollywood. “I thought he was wonderful—his live television shows were brilliant,” says Lester.\n\nAfter working on a variety of programs for nearly three years, Lester walked away from it all—just as he would walk away from filmmaking three decades later. “I found myself, at 22, with a girlfriend, a car, and an apartment,” he explains. “I thought, My life is settled and over. This is crazy. I want to get out. So I came to Europe and lived by my wits for a year.” He decided to stay in England because he “had to find someplace where English is the language and I can do the jokes.” He turned up at the beginning of commercial television in England, “and was grabbed . . . well not grabbed, but they said ‘if you agreed to teach other directors, we’ll allow you to stay for 13 weeks.’ So, I did.”\n\nOne of the shows Lester produced for English television lasted only one episode: The Dick Lester Show. “The premise was basically a show that had to go on an hour before it was ready. Everything was going wrong, but everything was there—cameras and booms and stage managers and arguments. It went appallingly. I promise you, it was atrocious.” Nonetheless, Peter Sellers—before Dr. Strangelove and his international fame as Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies—called Lester the next day, saying, “Either this is the worst television I have ever seen, or you’re on to something. Would you like lunch?”\n\nBy l952, Sellers was already famous on the legendary BBC radio series The Goon Show, with Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, all comic performers who had been through the horrors of World War II. They redefined comedy for the next generation, inspiring Beyond the Fringe and Monty Python’s Flying Circus. When Lester first met him, “Sellers was happily married, living in a semi-detached house with two little terrier dogs and two young children. He was just an average lad. Quirky. Liked his toys even then.” Sel­lers introduced Lester to Milligan, his brilliant but unstable collaborator, convinced that this was the man who could put The Goon Show on television. Which is exactly what he did, in 1956, in A Show Called Fred (five episodes) and Son of Fred (eight episodes).\n\nMilligan, an Irishman born in India, referred to himself and Sellers as “comic Bolsheviks.” What they had in common, besides their antic zaniness and theatrical gifts, was that they both suffered from psychiatric problems. Milligan, who was bipolar, had had his first breakdown in 1944, when discharged from the Royal Artillery and diagnosed with battle fatigue. “In those days,” Lester recalls, “the only way he could manage through the day was by giving him pills which were tranquilizers for horses. He had two of those pills each day, just to survive. Peter started to go towards madness, he passed Spike going in the other direction; Spike was able to control it better. But for Peter, who was a deeply troubled lad, it got harder and harder.”\n\nThe Goons’ inane parodies grew more dyspeptic, perhaps spurred by Milligan’s and Sellers’s bouts of depression. Many years later, Milligan would publicly describe his biggest fan, Prince Charles, as “a groveling little bastard.” The prince forgave him. You might say that the dark humor of the Goons—which made fun of the stiff-upper-lip stoicism of the Men Who Fought the War—would find a newer, lighter incarnation in the Beatles.\n\n“We were the sons of The Goon Show,” John Lennon later remarked. From the age of 12 on, Lennon belonged heart and soul to the Goons: “We were the extension of that rebellion, in a way.” And it was Lester’s association with the Goons that led him to the Beatles. When United Artists’ producer Walter Shenson, also an American living in London, asked the band who they wanted to direct their first movie, Paul McCartney said, “The only person we could think of was, ‘Whoever made that Running Jumping and Standing Still film? Who did that? ’Cause it was brilliant’ . . . It was just what we liked, we could relate to the humor wholeheartedly.”\n\nRichard Lester had made that 11-minute short, which consisted of Milligan and a few friends running, jumping, and standing still on Muswell Hill in North London, recorded on Sellers’s newly acquired 16-mm. movie camera. Lester composed the brief score. It was basically a home movie that found its way to the Edinburgh Festival and, remarkably, wound up being nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nEver since the success of using Bill Haley’s “Rock Around the Clock” over the opening and closing credits of Richard Brook’s 1955 movie, The Blackboard Jungle, movie producers were falling all over themselves to cash in on the popularity of rock ’n’ roll, churning out commercial claptrap such as Rock Around the Clock; Don’t Knock the Rock; Rock, Pretty Baby; Rock Around the World; Let’s Rock; Mister Rock and Roll; and Rock, Rock, Rock!—the titles pretty much tell the story. The Beatles—and Lester—knew all those pop-exploitation films and were determind to do something livelier and more original.\n\nIt was part of Lester’s genius to see A Hard Day’s Night in the tradition of the Marx Brothers and the Little Rascals, with homages to the silent-film-era comedies of Buster Keaton and the Keystone Cops. Film critic Andrew Sarris has called A Hard Day’s Night “the Citizen Kane of Jukebox musical.” He’s right. Not only did Lester get the fresh, exuberant tone of the Beatles’ early music, he introduced techniques he’d learned as a master-of-all-crafts working on television shows and commercials. He’d already used those techniques—three cameras instead of one, fracturing the screen into multiple images, showing us the cameras and the glaring lights—in his first music film, called It’s Trad, Dad, a 1962 survey of traditional jazz and pop groups in London just two short years before the Beatles changed pop music forever. (The Beatles also knew and admired It’s Trad, Dad, especially for the scene with rocker Gene Vincent, whom Lester filmed in white leather singing “Spaceship to Mars.”)\n\nWhen A Hard Day’s Night opened, it was unlike any other pop-music movie that had come before. Here were the Beatles as we first knew them, on black-and-white television, arriving on tarmacs and interviewed in press receptions, before their drug busts, the Maharishi, and their divorces. “I suspect that the documentary style was the most logical, because you didn’t particularly want acting classes for the four boys while we were actually filming,” Lester modestly explains. “And the decision to film in black-and-white was an economic one.”\n\nAs for the day-in-the-life motif, that idea was inspired by the Beatles themselves. “The boys had just recently played Stockholm. I asked John, ‘How did you like it?’ ‘It was lovely,’ he said. ‘It was a car, and a room, and a stage, and a cheese sandwich.’ That became the script!”\n\nLester, Shenson, and Alun Owen, the brilliant, chain-smoking Liverpudlian actor and playwright who wrote the movie’s original screenplay (and who’d appeared in that one episode of The Dick Lester Show), followed the Beatles to Paris for their concerts at L’Olympia Theatre. They all checked into the George V, occupying the same floor. “The film was writing itself right in front of us,” Lester said to Steven Soderberg, referring to the screaming girls, the escapes into waiting cars, the day-and-night room service, the patronizing press conferences. Paul recalled, “Little jokes, the sarcasm, the humor, John’s wit, Ringo’s laconic manner”— all made it into the screenplay. Shenson felt that “the script was so good it sounded like they were making it up as they went along.” The spontaneity was helped by the fact that Lester kept multiple cameras going on the Beatles at all times.\n\nWhile they were shooting, a lot of what seems planned happened by chance. At one point, all he had to do was turn one of his cameras on a group of screaming girls who had burst through the security barricades, surrounding the Beatles’ limousine. The exuberant sequence in which the Beatles escape to a field outside the studio to the music of “Can’t Buy Me Love” captures not only Lester’s own Running Jumping & Standing Still Film but, with its sped-up action, the look and feel of silent-film comedy. (It’s a curious footnote that Lester—skinny and in Beatle boots—stood in for John in the sequence, as Lennon was at Foyles bookstore at a literary luncheon for his first, Goon-inspired book, In His Own Write.)\n\nThe cinéma vérité quality “led to the fact that we shot on an actual train,” Lester explained. They started filming on Monday, March 2, 1964. For six days, cast and crew stayed on the train, which moved slowly through small suburban stations in England’s West Country — Minehead, Taunton, and Newton Abbot.\n\nThe scene in the train’s baggage car is a pure delight. Not only is their performance of “I Should Have Known Better” fresh and alive, they’re behind the iron mesh of the baggage car, caged in, surrounded by a handful of pretty girls in school uniforms. Lester had come to see how completely the Beatles were imprisoned by their fame. One of the girls is inside the Beatles’ cage—prophetically, it’s Pattie Boyd. The blond, cherubic-faced model first came to Lester’s attention when he chose her to appear in a commercial he was directing for Smith’s Crisps. “We had fun filming,” Boyd recalled from her home in England, “because part of the commercial required me to have a lisp as I said, ‘Smith’s Crisps.’ Quite difficult to say without laughing!” She found the director “terribly attractive, with his soft American accent. He seemed really cool, with a quirky sense of humor. Not being English himself, he could identify their humor in a fresher way than, say, an English director. He had no constraints or barriers.” In her 2007 memoir, Wonderful Tonight, she recounts how George Harrison proposed marriage to her on their first meeting. Though she turned him down, they did famously fall in love while filming A Hard Day’s Night, and she was indeed chosen to share George’s velvet captivity. Boyd inspired one of George’s most winning songs, “Something”.\n\nThe climactic concert performance sequence was filmed, with six cameras, before an audience of 350 screaming fans, including a 13-year-old Phil Collins, at the Scala Theatre on Charlotte Street, in London. A cameraman in the audience, Lester tells me, later complained that his fillings had been loosened by the fans’ deafening screams.\n\nThe famous press-conference scene—using some real journalists—was also filmed at the Scala, in the upstairs bar. Lester and Owen wanted to re-create the condescending quality of a reception that had taken place in New York, on the Beatles’ first tour of America, where they found themselves treated like a newly discovered species. Later, in Washington D.C., when someone cut off a lock of Ringo’s hair, the boys were so taken aback they fled the reception. It was part of Lester’s wit to edit several questions and answers so they’re mismatched: when asked if he had any hobbies, John scribbles on a piece of paper, and Paul replies, “No, we’re just good friends.” And when a reporter asks Ringo, “Are you a Mod or a Rocker,” his answer—“I’m a Mocker”—caught the movie’s irreverent spirit.\n\nLester even mocks himself, in Victor Spinetti’s role as the arrogant, paranoid television director putting on the live show in which the Beatles will perform. “Victor played the opposite of how Dick really was,” according to Boyd. Tall, lean, with a high dome like Lester’s, Spinetti wears an unfashionable mohair sweater while coping—badly—with the pressures of live TV. “I actually had one of those sweaters,” Lester admitted over lunch. It’s an inspired performance, and Spinetti would turn up again as the craven scientist in Help!, the second Beatles movie.\n\nIn Ringo’s scene, in which he goes AWOL in a self-pitying mood (spurred on by Paul’s irascible granddad, played by Wilfrid Brambell), he finds a grim landscape waiting for him. Without the protective mantle of the Beatles, he’s told, “Get out of here, Shorty,” by a working-class girl, he’s thrown out of a pub, and he’s arrested for malicious mischief. It’s a glimpse of what Ringo’s—Richard Starkey’s—life might have been like without the Beatles, but it’s also a glimpse of what Britain might have been like without the Beatles—the dispirited canal, the tired old Turk’s Head pub, the bored, joyless faces of adults with hard lives. The Beatles brought joy back to England. Their wild popularity ushered in the British invasion (the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Searchers, Freddie and the Dreamers, Peter and Gordon, Billy J. Kramer, Chad and Jeremy) and brought in its wake Britain’s 60s-era ascendancy in fashion, music, and style. London owned the Swingin’ Sixties. In the final scene of A Hard Day’s Night when the lads escape by helicopter and their glossy photographs, like so much manna, swirl out of the open hatch.\n\nLester only had four months to shoot, edit, and present the film before its royal premiere at the London Pavilion, on July 6. Despite tremendous pre-release orders for the movie’s soundtrack, United Artists was worried about how the Beatles would translate into film: at one point the studio considered re-dubbing their voices with those of trained actors, but Lester absolutely refused.\n\nA Hard Day’s Night was a phenomenal success, the first movie in history to realize a profit while it was still being filmed, because United Artists—and not the Beatles’ record label, EMI—owned the soundtrack, for which there were 2 million advance orders. (“If the truth be known, Brian Epstein was not a very good businessman,” Lester says.) Made for about $500,000, the movie brought in $5.8 million in six weeks, and it set an industry record for return on investment for years to come, so there was no doubt that Lester would direct their second film, Help!, in 1965. Ringo e-mailed to say that “Help! was A Hard Day’s Night for Richard Lester.”\n\nA lot had happened to the Beatles in the intervening year, and one of them was Bob Dylan. If A Hard Day’s Night was done “on pills,” Help! was done “on pot,” John later admitted to Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner. It was Dylan who had turned them on to grass at the Delmonico Hotel, when they first met. (In fact, Dylan was surprised the Beatles had never gotten high before. He had misheard the refrain “I can’t hide, I can’t hide” from “I Want to Hold Your Hand” as “I get high, I get high.”)\n\nThey had moved beyond being the Fab Four by then; they were more interested in making new music than in being the Beatles. (Paul said about this period of their lives, “It’s like working in a bell factory, you don’t hear the bells anymore.”) They were bored with the process of filmmaking, and smoking dope was their way of dealing with it, so Lester knew to shoot most of their scenes before lunch. “Help! was great, but it wasn’t our film—we were sort of guest stars,” Paul said. John went further and compared the Beatles to extras in their own movie. “Help! was a drag,” he famously remarked, “because we didn’t know what was happening. In fact, Richard Lester was a bit ahead of his time . . . but we were all on pot then, and all the best stuff ended up on the cutting-room floor.”\n\n“The actual writing of Help! is a blur,” recalls Charles Wood, one of the movie’s screenwriters. “I don’t remember much about it—it only took me a week, I think.” Shot in England, Austria, and the Bahamas, it was a James Bond spoof in glorious color. Though the plot was comic, the subtext was not: the Beatles had gone from being chased in A Hard Day’s Night to being hunted in Help!. Strung throughout are fabulous new songs: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” “Another Girl,” “The Night Before,” “Ticket to Ride,” “You’re Going to Lose That Girl,” “I Need You,” and, of course, the title song, “Help,” which was written and recorded in just 30 hours.\n\nUnited Artists had a three-picture deal with the Beatles. The third movie was going to be adapted from a novel by the author of The Manchurian Candidate, Richard Condon, called A Talent for Loving—a Western! When that didn’t work out, Lester commissioned a script from the cheeky, subversive playwright Joe Orton, Up Against It. Orton was well on his way to transforming English theater with his outrageous, witty farces, such as Loot and What the Butler Saw.\n\n“I took Up Against It and tried to turn it into something a bit different,” Lester remembers. The day he was supposed to meet with Orton at Twickenham Studios, however, something terrible happened. “We sent a car for him. It was our driver who looked through the letter box and then called his agent, Peggy Ramsay. They broke in and found the body.” Orton had been bludgeoned to death in a murder-suicide by his resentful companion, Kenneth Halliwell. In a wry observation that would have delighted Orton, Lester was able to joke, “Hence the expression, ‘People will do anything to get out of going to lunch with Lester.’ ”\n\nThe Beatles—after vetoing the idea to appear in Musketeers sequel—eventually fulfilled their third-picture requirement with Let It Be, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. But by then they had pretty much broken up. It was like watching a divorced couple break bread for the sake of their children.\n\nLester followed up Help! with a wide range of movies over the next two decades. Many featured acting legends and were met with critical acclaim and box-office success. In 1965 he directed The Knack . . . and How to Get It, which won the Palme d’Or. Two years later came Lester’s satiric, anti-war movie, How I Won the War, with John Lennon playing a World War II soldier, Private Gripweed.\n\nMuch was made of John’s appearance in the movie. He showed up on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine as Gripweed, in an army helmet and those wire-rimmed, National Health eyeglasses, which launched a fashion trend. Lester was impressed with John’s ability and he told him, “If you really wanted to, John, you could be a very interesting actor.” John replied, “Yeah, but it’s fucking stupid, isn’t it?” He hated the endless waiting around between takes, but it wasn’t a total loss—he’d managed to write “Strawberry Fields Forever” while on location.\n\nLester directed George C. Scott, Richard Chamberlain, and a luminous Julie Christie in the 1968 film Petulia. Lester returned to America, shooting in San Francisco. And though the movie opened with concert footage of the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, the rock music is more background than an integral part of the film. “There was still the sense of optimism in 1966,” Lester recalls, but “by the time we got back [to America] in ’67, the hard-nose drug culture, and the commercialization of it, had taken over. The Vietnam war was building up. There was that sense of anger. I suppose it’s a quite a cynical film in that respect.”\n\n“Julie was a nervous actor and took a while to overcome inhibitions,” Lester recalled. He found it was best to catch her off-guard, “so if you look at the film, almost everything is done over the shoulder with closeups each way. It worked.” George C. Scott, on the other hand, “was the most instinctive actor I’ve ever worked with. The finest. There would be moments of insight which were so extraordinary that we would film everything that he did.” Photographed by a young Nicolas Roeg, who would go on to direct David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Petulia was set to premiere at the Cannes Film festival that year. That was the good news. The bad news was that the 1968 May riots in Paris caused the festival to collapse.\n\nOther notable films include A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, with two of Lester’s hereos, Buster Keaton and Zero Mostel; Superman II and III, and a trio of films based on the Three Musketeers. The third of these, The Return of the Musketeers (1989), was marked by a tragedy that occurred during production and altered the course of Lester’s life.\n\nWith filming on the movie almost completed, Roy Kinnear, a comedic natural who was one of Lester’s favorite actors, was supposed to thunder across the Alcantara Bridge near Toledo, in one of his scenes as Planchet. He was thrown from his horse, fractured his pelvis, and suffered massive internal bleeding. At least two of his fellow actors, Oliver Reed and Michael York, regarded the stunt as hazardous and felt Kinnear should have been offered a stunt double. The following day, Kinnear suffered a fatal heart attack in the hospital. He was 54 years old.\n\nLester was devastated. Even now, 25 years later, he can’t talk about it. All he says when the subject comes up is, “It’s painful. I’m sure you appreciate that. He is—he was—wonderful.”\n\nSix years after Kinnear’s death, his widow, Carmel Kinnear, filed a lawsuit against Lester and the film’s producer, Pierre Spengler of Falconfilms, for exposing her husband to unnecessary risk. Though Lester and Spengler maintained that the immediate cause of death had been by the Madrid hospital’s alleged medical negligence, Carmel was awarded £650,000 in damages.\n\nWhether it was the death of his friend, the ensuing lawsuit, or changes in the movie industry, Lester would never again direct a feature film.\n\nActors with whom he had long collaborative relationships, like Michael Crawford and Rita Tushingham, who both starred in The Knack, lament his departure. Crawford confides, “You only meet that kind of director, who appreciates all that comic genius, once in a career. And I was lucky enough to meet him. I so wish Richard were still directing.”\n\n“His retirement is such a loss,” says Tushingham. “But Richard always knows what he wants to do. He’s the only person who really knows why he retired so early. All I know is I’d love to do another film with him.”\n\nAfter all, the pop musical came of age under Lester’s ingenious eye. After A Hard Day’s Night, other English bands started making movies (the Dave Clark Five in Catch Us If You Can, Gerry and the Pacemakers’ Ferry Cross the Mersey). Traces of Lester’s DNA can be found in the l966–l968 television series The Monkees, about the antics of a pre-fab Fab Four. You can see Lester’s influence in Trainspotting, and in the advertising campaign for High Fidelity, which copies Robert Freeman’s poster art for A Hard Day’s Night. Todd Haynes even slipped in a sly homage to A Hard Day’s Night in I’m Not There. And many believe that the music video, launched by MTV in the summer of 1981, was preconcieved by Richard Lester. He recalls being sent a vellum scroll citing him as the father of MTV. With typical modesty, Lester jokingly insisted on a paternity test, but you can tell it’s his offspring just by looking at it.\n\nWhatever the reasons for his great disappearing act, we have little choice but to accept his decision that the joke is over. The public one, at least. While the fun may have gone out of it for Richard Lester, fortunately for the rest of us, the inspired mischief, the astonishing music—the pure joy of it—are still there."
