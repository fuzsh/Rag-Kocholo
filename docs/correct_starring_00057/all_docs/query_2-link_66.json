        "text": "As the great Joan Jett said, I love rock and roll. (Actually, she borrowed those lyrics from The Arrows, but that’s another story.) The other day, I was talking to my children about rock drummers and had an epiphany that I’d like to share with you. It’s about teams and teammates.\n\nI was asking my children to name the best rock drummers of all time. The usual names were proffered. Few such lists can exclude, with any sense of integrity, Neil Peart, John Bonham, Keith Moon, Alex Van Halen, Ginger Baker, and various other legendary drummers. Then I asked, what about Richard Starkey (a.k.a. Ringo Starr)? They laughed.\n\nNow, much has been said and written about Ringo as a drummer. Some say he was great, and others say he was not. It appears that The Beatles had to hire a session drummer to fill in for him on a couple of songs, and there have long been rumors that Paul McCartney was actually a better drummer than Ringo. (Paul did take Ringo’s place on a few songs.)\n\nBut here’s the thing. Neil Peart (Rush), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Keith Moon (The Who), Alex Van Halen (Van Halen), and Ginger Baker (Cream) may very well have been better drummers technically than Ringo, but Ringo stands above all of them in terms of his impact on the world of rock and roll and the legacy that he helped to build.\n\nWhy is that? It’s because he was part of a better team and because he played the particular role that his team needed him to play. I have the greatest respect for Rush, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Van Halen, and Cream. They are among my favorite bands – but they are not The Beatles. Say what you will about The Beatles, but they stand above all rock bands for what they did, what they were, and how they forever changed popular music around the world. Some might say that Paul McCartney and John Lennon are the Beethoven and Mozart of rock and roll. (Actually, I say that all the time.) George Harrison might not be the Brahms or Bach of rock and roll, but he’s at least the Schumann or Schubert of the genre.\n\nRingo is usually seen as the fourth most important member of the four-person band that changed the world, but he played his part well, and The Beatles would not have been The Beatles without him. He was the right type of drummer for that particular band. He made important contributions when he could (and he did make many), but he mostly enabled his bandmates to do what they needed to do. He himself humbly said that “I’m no good on the technical things.” Yet, he knew that he still played a vital role in the band: “I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there. … If there’s a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.”\n\nBy the way, this is the case for many rock drummers. Vocalists and guitarists usually get to be up in front, and it’s the drummers who also sing that often become more famous than those who do not. Don Henley and Phil Collins are examples, as is Ringo. Karen Carpenter was an excellent drummer, but she is known almost exclusively for her vocals (which admittedly were extraordinary).\n\nYet, it is a band’s drummer who dutifully keeps the beat, ensuring that all the other band members can do their work together and in perfect coordination. In some respects, the drummer is the glue for the band and for every song.\n\nRingo Starr may not have been the best rock drummer of all time, but simply by virtue of doing his job well, his legacy will endure for generations to come – even when people, many years from now, no longer recognize his name. And so it is with team members generally. Want to make a real difference in the world? Don’t worry so much about whether you’re the star. Worry instead about being part of a great team and doing your part to support the team and enable it to function optimally. Help your teammates however you can, and you will forever be tied to the legacy of the greater team of which you are an important part."
