Though his contributions to the band rarely received the same degree of praise as Paul McCartney and John Lennon's songwriting and George Harrison's guitar skills, Starr's consistently solid beat and natural charisma were hailed by modern musicians and critics alike for helping to elevate the status of the drummer to an equal partner in a band. Starr continued to promote the Beatles' brand of peaceful harmony and joy into his solo career and as the leader of frequent tours with his celebrity-filled All Starr Band. He was, in fact, such a natural on camera in the band's films \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964) and \"Help\" (1965) that he pursued an ongoing acting career post-Beatles alongside his musical endeavors.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n87% George Harrison: Living in the Material World\n\n61% The Magic Christian\n\n50% 200 Motels\n\n36% Candy\n\n33% Caveman\n\n25% Give My Regards to Broad Street\n\n25% Sextette\n\n0% Water\n\nPhotos\n\nRingo Starr A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, Ringo Starr, 1964.
