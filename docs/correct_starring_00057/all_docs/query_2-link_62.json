        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n8 May 2024, 11:48\n\nCredit: Getty/Disney+\n\nThe Beatles’ Ringo Starr has revealed he felt the band’s 1970 documentary film Let It Be was lacking joy before it was restored for re-release on Disney+.\n\n“I was always moaning about the original film, because there was no real joy in it,” the drummer told The Daily Beast in a recent interview about the film, which was released on the streaming platform today (8th May).\n\nThe musician opened up alongside the documentary film’s director Michael Lindsay-Hogg about how Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which offered an in-depth look at the band during the making of Let It Be) elevated Let It Be to now be a more enjoyable watch.\n\n“Now it’s got a start, a middle, and a finish. The start is very slow, and then we get into creating, and then we’re at it and then we’re out,” Starr explained. “I love it. But I’m in it, of course, so six hours is never long enough.”\n\nLindsay-Hogg added: “If we hadn’t met Peter Jackson, and if he and his team hadn’t developed the amazing technology they developed to restore the picture and sound of the original film we shot, I’m not sure how we would talk about Let It Be.\n\n“Now, we talk about it in the context of Get Back. Peter said to me, ‘What I’m doing is making a documentary about making a documentary.’ And that’s what Peter did. So he did a lot of the legwork for the rest of us.”\n\nDespite how Let It Be chronicles the band’s difficult time working on their last album, Lindsay-Hogg explained how there’s joy to be found even when the band were splitting up.\n\n“All that had been going on before—them not getting on or them having spats, like people who work together often do—[when] they started really playing and they knew there was a crowd… they were 16 again,” he shared, thinking back to the legendary impromptu rooftop show which closes out the film, and which was to become the band’s last performance together.\n\n“Once I got them on the roof—and that was the hard part, because they didn’t really make up their minds until they were standing down in the little cubby hole of a room about to go on the roof—they were great,” he shared."
