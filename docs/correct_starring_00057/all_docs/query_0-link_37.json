        "text": "William F. Buckley may have been a guru of conservative ideology, but when it came to pop music criticism … perhaps he should have stuck to politics. In a column on Beatlemania, he made John, Paul, George and Ringo look like the Four Horsemen of the Cultural Apocalypse. In his florid opinion, “They are so unbelievably horrible, so appallingly unmusical, so dogmatically insensitive to the magic of the art, that they qualify as crowned heads of anti-music. …”\n\nThat fascinating revelation is among the tidbits in “The Beatles A Hard Day’s Night: A Private Archive,” a newly released photobook by Phaidon that features a trove of previously unseen publicity stills from the Fab Four’s 1964 debut movie of the same name, as well as collected ephemera from their ascent to the global cultural pantheon.\n\nThe movie, directed by Richard Lester, starred John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr as they take the train to London for a night of clubbing and a promotional television appearance the next day. Although scripted, the film took inspiration from the musicians’ real lives, and its title from their affable drummer, whose “Ringoisms” rivaled Yogi Berra’s penchant for malapropisms.\n\n“A Hard Day’s Night” was released shortly after the Beatles entranced the United States on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” but they were already superstars in England. In his introduction to the book, the Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes, “No adjective can adequately convey how huge they were in their homeland.”\n\nFor the rest of the world, the film gave the first glimpse into the group’s distinct personalities, as well the inscrutable lingo from Liverpool, the northern English city whence the lads came. Outside of England, people might not have known what “stroppy” or “grotty” meant, or why “swine” might be used as a term of endearment, but they couldn’t possibly miss the film’s subtext: Longhaired, working-class young people were leading an insurrection against traditional values.\n\nAnd they would not be denied.\n\nEarly on, John and Paul challenge the inherent privilege claimed by a war veteran in a first-class rail car. Later, George taunts an uptight advertising executive. Ringo calls a London policeman “Southerner” as an epithet and then tells a pretentious television employee: “There you go. Hiding behind a smokescreen of bourgeois clichés.” According to Mr. Lewisohn, this was no accident, as the self-confident musicians believed themselves anyone’s equals.\n\n“They had no inferiority complex of any kind, in any company,” he said. “But recognize they were existing in a world that could look down upon them for not speaking in BBC English. This was Britain in those days. And it was part of the Beatles’ immense charm that they were able to just surf all of that, and not be bothered with it in real life.”\n\nThe movie handles this sense of rebellion with a zany touch, as the loose narrative periodically gives way to the pleasure of catchy tunes like “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “If I Fell” and, of course, the title track. It also allowed the bandmates to display their comic talents, with each Beatle getting at least one opportunity to mug for the camera.\n\nPaul comes across as earnest; John a bit cynical; George possessed of a grounded cool; and Ringo, by the end, is the star. He provides the film’s dramatic tension by leaving the group to go “parading” with a Pentax 35-millimeter camera, after Wilfred Brambell, the actor playing Paul’s rascal grandfather, persuades him to walk out on the impending TV concert. (Don’t worry, he comes back just in time.)\n\nAccording to Mr. Lewisohn, the Pentax was real: All of the band members were interested in photography, and Ringo even had a photo book published in 1964, too.\n\nThe Phaidon book’s images capture the linear action, as well as behind-the-scenes moments that will excite any Beatles fan. And the film’s mocking tone toward the conservative establishment presaged how history would not be kind to Mr. Buckley’s opinion, as the Beatles evolved as trailblazing musicians.\n\nMr. Lewisohn, who has devoted his career to chronicling the band and is currently writing a definitive three-volume history, referred to the Beatles as “the pumping heartbeat of the ’60s.” While he admits that the same musicians, playing the same songs, could never have an identical effect on today’s striated, market-surveyed micro-audiences, he insists it’s no accident they became the most influential musical group to date.\n\n“I think if you set out to consciously try to effect cultural change, you’ll probably fall at the first hurdle,” he said. “But if you just set out to please yourself, and it happens to be something that delights millions, then you’ve got the perfect combination.”\n\nJonathan Blaustein is an artist and writer based in New Mexico.
