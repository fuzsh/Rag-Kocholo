Allcroft denied he was chosen because of his Beatles fame, since she was not a fan of the band at the time.\n\nAllcroft met with Starr in Autumn 1983, and he originally declined narrating the series since he had not read any of The Railway Series books at that time. However, after reading the books, he decided to narrate the series. He signed onto the series in December 1983.[1]\n\nStarr would occasionally refer to Thomas as “Tommy”, to which he would be gently corrected by Wilbert Awdry to call him “Thomas, never Tommy”.\n\nStarr recorded the narration for the first series in eight days. That includes re-doing four episodes due to the tone of his voice.\n\nHe also recorded narration for the Ladybird audio books.\n\nStarr narrated episodes on the following American home media releases.\n\nThomas Gets Tricked and Other Stories\n\nJames Learns a Lesson and Other Stories\n\nTenders and Turntables and Other Stories\n\nThomas Breaks the Rules and Other Stories\n\nBetter Late than Never and Other Stories\n\nBest of Percy (Percy Takes the Plunge)\n\nThe Early Years (Series 1; UK Dub)\n\nThe Greatest Stories (Thomas Gets Tricked and Edward Helps Out; UK Dub) (Diesel's Devious Deed)\n\nEngine Friends (Thomas and Bertie's Great Race, Trouble in the Shed, Saved from Scrap, and A New Friend for Thomas)\n\nStarr returned to voice Thomas in the 2009 Children in Need Charity Single.\n\nOn the BBC game show \"Pointless\", when asked who took over narrating the UK version of the series from Starr in 1991, four out of the one-hundred people remembered that it was Michael Angelis.\n\nStarr is the only UK narrator to portray the role of Mr. Conductor for Shining Time Station.\n\nHis favourite character is Diesel.[2]\n\nWriter Michael White stated that an episode proposed for the cancelled Series 25 would have had, if possible, Starr returning for a cameo narration when Thomas has a fantasy sequence about time travel.\n\nHe owned an 8% stake of The Britt Allcroft Company.[3]\n\nReferences"
