        "text": "In addition to the Beatles' films A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Yellow Submarine (1968) and Let It Be (1970), Ringo Starr also acted in films such as Candy (1968), The Magic Christian (1969, alongside Peter Sellers), Blindman (1971), Son of Dracula (1974) and Caveman (1981). Starr directed and appeared in Born to Boogie (1972), a concert film featuring Marc Bolan and T. Rex. For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, The Kids Are Alright, Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon.[3] He starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels (1971).[4] His voice is also featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point! (1971).\n\nIn 1972, Starr made a brief cameo appearance at the end of an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, entitled \"Mr. and Mrs. Brian Norris' Ford Popular\". He co-starred in That'll Be the Day (1973) as a Teddy Boy, and went on to appear in The Last Waltz, the Martin Scorsese film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band, a favourite of the Beatles. Starr played 'The Pope' in Ken Russell's Lisztomania (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in Paul McCartney's Give My Regards to Broad Street in 1984. He also appeared as himself, and downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats, in Ringo (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on The Prince and the Pauper.\n\nStarr was the first narrator of the children's programme Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends from 1984–86 for the British broadcast and from 1989–90 in the United States.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
