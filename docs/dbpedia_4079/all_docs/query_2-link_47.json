Usually, the shuffle is a flavorful and sweet mix, but today we’re aiming for the sour side of things. As a result, today the Shuffle Thread is embracing all things BITTER!\n\nShare your favorite songs featuring the word “Bitter” in the title of them! But if those songs leave a bad taste in your mouth, don’t be looking for a palate cleanser just yet! You can post any playlist that you’ve been listening to on shuffle this past week! Happy shuffling, and I’ll see you all next time!"
