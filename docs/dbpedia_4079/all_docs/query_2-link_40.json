Just got some kernels from the last couple of issues to catch up on: Mike Mooney was musing a couple of issues ago about what influenced of some Dukes songs, to which I would add this: \"25 O'Clock\" reminds me a lot of an old Electric Prunes song called \"I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night.\" That connection seemed to click a few years back, after having become thoroughly steeped in Dukes-mania, when I heard the Prunes tune on the radio for some reason. I don't know much about the Electric Prunes. They were a late '60s psychedelia band (American, I believe) that released several albums culminating with a record of Gregorian chants called \"Mass in F minor (or was it major??) When I was in high school, a friend of mine and I stumbled across a Prunes record in a second-hand shop and thought it looked weird enough to be interesting. Anyway, try that song (their only hit, I think) if you feel the need to give 25 O'Clock some kind of reference point. I'm happy to report that in Madison, the unofficial XTC capital of the U.S., \"Cherry in Your Tree\" has been getting a fair amount of airplay on WMAD 92FM, a local \"alternative\" radio station. I've heard it three times in the past two weeks -- and I only listen to the radio when I'm in my car. The first time I heard it I was so surprised by the unmistakable sound of Mr. Partridge's voice (singing something NEW) that I nearly had a heart attack! I'm a bit curious though...This is supposed to be a CHILDREN'S song? I guess they don't think kids can understand double-entendre... Thanks to all who have chimed in about the song by They Might Be Giants. I've been a fan for several years now and am seeing them later this month at the Barrymore Theater (named after Drew's Granddad) in Madison. If you get the chance, catch their show. And speaking of Madison -- why *not* a convention here? Some people in the last couple of issues have mentioned Elvis Costello and condemned nearly everything he's done since 1981 or so. (Or am I exaggerating?) While I agree that \"Goodbye Cruel World\" was a most hopeless failure, I must stand up for his last several albums. I can understand knocking \"Spike.\" It didn't hold up. But \"King of America\" remains a sentimental favorite of mine and I still believe that \"Mighty Like the Rose,\" while pretty densely realized, was his best and most wittily bitter work in a long, long time. \"The Juliet Letters\" was difficult at first, but I now find it to be incredibly powerful. \"Brutal Youth\" is of course spectacular. Back to XTC: I neglected in my introduction some weeks back to mention my XTC favorites. \"Black Sea\" and \"English Settlement\" are at the top of my list, followed by \"Oranges and Lemons,\" \"Nonsuch\" and \"Skylarking\" in no particular order. \"Drums and Wires\" is okay, but anything earlier than that doesn't get onto my CD player much. A thousand apologies to whomever this may offend, but no matter how hard I try, I just can't hear \"The Big Express\" as anything but a temporary creative impasse. To finish the \"All of Me\" discussion: It was written by Seymour Simons and Gerald Marks and published in 1931. Nearly every jazz performer has recorded a version of this nifty little standard. Anyway, sorry for prattling on so long. I guess there were a few things on my tiny little mind. Ed time.\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] From: \"Allan Blackman\" <BLACKMAN@alkali.otago.ac.nz> Date: 12 Apr 94 17:20:51 GMT+1200 Subject: Re: Introducing a New Member >From: PETER ANDREWS <PRAND1@cfs01.cc.monash.edu.au> >Organization: Monash University >Hi there, or perhaps G'day, >My name is Peter Andrews and perhaps I am a contender for the >\"Chalkhillian residing the greatest distance from Swindon\", as I live >in Melbourne, Australia.

My friend's older brother had most of their albums and i made tapes, tapes, tapes . I was also wondering if someone would clear up the TMBG-XTC talk I've been reading. I live in Seattle, WA and the very large alternative radio station here 107.7-KNDD has been playing the new song \"Cherry...\" almost every hour. This station has been responsible for helping some lesser known bands along the path of success and response to the new song has seem to have been very good. I do hope it is a hit. Sid Glenn Thankx and whatever! sid@dew.org\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Tue, 12 Apr 1994 00:20:32 -0700 (PDT) From: Steve Johnson <steve-j@teleport.com> Subject: Johnny Nexdor & His Neighbors Well, I thought it was pretty obvious that it was Andy and John singing on \"Change My World,\" though I THOUGHT it could have been just Andy. However, BOTH John Linnell and Andy Partridge have mentioned or alluded to the song in exchanges with a few fans to whom I've spoken.\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Tue, 12 Apr 1994 11:26:26 -0500 (EST) From: Wesley Van Kilgore <trout@pinn.net> Subject: Re: Doesn't \"jump\" on Mummer sound like PPH? For the life of me I can't remember a jump on Mummer. Perhaps I have an import version of the album. I haven't checked my album yet, but it's one of my favorites and (I thought) I pretty much knew it inside and out (then again, I'm the knucklehead who called white music \"white noise\", Somehow I accidentally confused that album with a Gang of 4 song about white noise.) I bet I can even list the songs while I'm sitting here at work. Side 1: Beating of hearts Wonderland Love on a farmboy's wages Great fire Deliver us from the elements Side 2 Human alchemy Ladybird In loving memory of a name Me and the wind Funk, pop a roll Where in blue blazes is \"jump\" Also, I've been away from the net for a while, trying to find a computer to use in my new office, so I missed the deluge of corrections my aforementioned White Noise gaffe received as well as my hendrix/Dylan faux pas. I offer no excuses. I will keep the anal retentiveness of some of my fellow chalkhillians in mind in my future postings.\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Tue, 12 Apr 1994 08:49:13 -0600 (MDT) From: Andrew Dorfman <dorfman1@csn.org> Subject: Re: regarding new member intros... Hello to Chalkhills. I've been away from the net for a while and am busily catching up. I found Chalkhills posted in one of those huge lists of mailing lists and promptly forgot about it. I then saw the FAQ and signed up that moment. Thanks for all the pertinent reading material. If memory serves, the first XTC I heard on the radio was either Tower of London or Senses Working Overtime. At that time I was living in western Kentucky and XTC was on nobody's playlist. Upon moving to Denver, I heard XTC every day on at least two different radio stations, they are quite popular here. In fact, new releases might get a bit overplayed. I guess the disc that really sold me was English Settlement. I've been hooked ever since. I also resonate with a good bit of the other music cited in this group, especially Richard Thompson. I'm still kicking myself for missing his latest in Denver a week or two ago. Well, I'll be watching and reading. Looking forward to hearing much more, Andy\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Tue, 12 Apr 1994 13:42:42 -0500 (EST) From: CANEVIT@utkvx.utcc.utk.edu Subject: Various notes Hey, gang! I just wanted to add one more expression of support for the two albums getting so much buzz here. I bought the Carmen Sandiego disc last week and found the Sam Phillips cd as well (I also found the Animaniacs soundtrack, which would be better than Carmen if not for \"Cherry in Your Tree.\"). The XTC song once again proves that there is no more aptly named band running around these days. Who would have thought that such a simple song could be so haunting (in a good way)? I liked Martinis and Bikinis, but I haven't yet had too much of a chance to let it grow on me. I would have to qualify the statement made a week ago that it was really psychedelic a la \"Tomorrow Never Knows\"; to my mind, it's a lot more subtly so. I found the album at almost every turn to pull a sort of trick on me: whenever I started to worry that a song was going to be sort of bland, Sam went and changed something in the singing/music and made it really seductive. I think that's the best way to describe the disc; it's not really for all Chalkhillers, but a few listenings would make it attractive to quite a few of you. The Animaniacs soundtrack has nothing at all to do with XTC except that it combines youthful wonder and fun with amazingly clever lyrics. Very, very highly recommended. For some reason, I have been listening a lot to the Dukes of late, and personally, I would say that they sound a little like the Rutles. One last note: I have caught references here made to the Lemon Dukes, and I am wondering if \"Cherry In Your Tree\" would be pretty much what we should expect from them. Does anybody know? What's the probability of seeing a cd from them? be seeing you, Craig E. Canevit, who listened to the Carmen Sandiego, Animaniacs, and Sam Phillips cd's while reading the latest issue of Jeff Smith's Bone, and wonders why he didn't explode!\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Tue, 12 Apr 1994 15:18:23 -0400 (EDT) From: \"Jason C. Langley\" <jlangley@nynexst.com> Subject: Jennifer Trynin & Carmen Dear Chalkhills: I picked up the Jennifer Trynin single (Everything's Different Now / Snow) last week. \"Everything's Different Now\" credits Dave Gregory as \"The Soloist\". It's actually quite good, very raw, funky, with two guitars (one distorted, one with wah wah). Dave's solo is brief; its fluid drenched in distortion and feedback. The single is on Squint Records, PO BOX 562, Boston, MA 02130-0005 (617) 522-2289 I also picked up _Carmen SanDiego Out of this World_ a week ago. \"Cherry In Your Tree\" is wonderful. I love the cello in the intro, the guitar part reminds me of something, but what it is escapes me (T. Rex?). Actually I know nothing about bubble gum so I might have to check with my older sister, \"the bubble gum queen\". From: Dave Franson <72277.311@compuserve.com> >Carmen Sandiego: Out of this World also passes the intended audience >test-- my 6- and 9-year old love it. Highly recommended. Here, Here!! We listened to it in the car easter weekend. My five year old daughter runs around the house singing \"I got toys like the other boys\". Carmen has been a guilty pleasure for me lately, I like \"Half a World Away\", \"Lucky to be my Parent's son\", and the Johnny Nexdor tune. From: Wesley Wilson <WWILSON@forumbos.mhs.compuserve.com> >I *didn't* know, until I read the liner notes, that Dave Gregory >and Colin also play on \"Cherry,\" so it is a true XTC track. Actually, according to the Little Express, he didn't. From: Wesley Wilson <WWILSON@forumbos.mhs.compuserve.com> >First, where is the (is it Christine?) Trynin CD single available? Wes, it's a 45. Try Newbury Comics. I got the last copy at the Newbury Comics in Natick (Sherwood Plaza). From: seanbe@microsoft.com >For more 80's psychedelia, y'all might check out the Three O'Clock (first >couple of albums, before they got too homogenous). _Sixteen Tamborines_ RULES!!! Great sixties pop, well worth checking out if you can find it. I've had little use for their other stuff. Other highlights from that \"Paisley Underground\" scene in the early eighties is Dream Syndicate _Days of Wine and Roses_, Rain Parade _Emergency Third rail Power Trip_, and _Rainy Day_ a great comp. (w/ Three O'clock, Rain Parade, Bangles, Dream Syndicate,) turned me on to Velvet Underground and Big Star. > I also am a huge Let's Active fan and would like to put in a plug for >the dB's, whose first two albums were incredible gems. Once again, the dBs are great also. All of there stuff is recommended by me. From: \"John Relph\" <relph@presto.ig.com> >Steve Johnson <steve-j@teleport.com> writes: >>Another song on the album, CHANGE MY WORLD, is also sung by Andy >>and John Linnell of They Might Be Giants (the song performance is >>credited to \"JOHNNY NEXDOR & HIS NEIGHBORS\" -- a very 'Partridgesque' >>pseudonym). >Steve! How did you find this out? Can you state without a doubt that >it's Andy and John? What a great thing! I love both XTC and They >Might Be Giants (and I'm going to see the Giants real soon now). I have to ask the same question. I've listened to it over and over, and while I'd like to believe it's Andy, I'm leaning to believe its not. I hope I'm wrong, by brother swears its Andy, as does my wife.

I'm 29, live in Bedford U.K, and have been into XTC on and off since English Settlement (I missed Mummer and TBE due to being too poor at the time, but I will definately aquire themsomeday :-). Anyway, Damian Foulger wrote: >word. Also, if there are any fans out there, and I know that there is at >least one, how do people pronounce SIBERRY as in JANE? Well, you can make that two fans now!

I've been listening to Eno's \"Before and After Science\" and \"Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)\" lately. Terrifically innovative ! I have also heard \"801 Live\" and \"Stage\" by Bowie (which features some Eno/Bowie songs done live, sans Eno). Can anyone recommend more Eno worth checking out? What about Eno and Cluster? What about the Eno box set currently in stores? Thanks 4 any recommendations... \"Looking up and down the radio...uh-oh, nothing there this time!\" --Eno\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Wed, 13 Apr 94 18:58:28 EDT From: \"Gene (Sp00n) Yoon\" <ST004422@brownvm.brown.edu> Subject: plugging into Nonsuch Wesley Wilson <WWILSON@forumbos.mhs.compuserve.com> writes: > >Third, anyone have any ideas on why studio-conscious Andy would >want the sound of a guitar cord being plugged into an amp to >start of _Nonsuch_...? I always thought that the sound was supposed to evoke the sound of gunshots (five, to be exact--which happens to be the number of shots in a very famous presidential assassination). The popping sound is not unlike the popping sound of a gun being fired from far away, or in a very loud motorcade with cheering Dallas residents. Can you imagine the effect of shooting a bullet through a Pumpkin(head)? Very messy, I'd think. Just a thought, Gene\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Wed, 13 Apr 1994 13:25:00 EDT From: BJWILSEY@suvm.acs.syr.edu Chalkhills, I am another new member. I first learned of XTC on the college radio station at Louisiana State Univ. (KLSU) in the mid to late 80's. They played a lot of Skylarking and Psonic Psunspot. My favorite CD's are the Big Express and Nonsuch, but I think their best work is going to be in the future. Enough about me.

Hi all...everybody seems to be discussing the Dukes' influences and I haven't seen anybody mention that the opening guitar riff for \"Vanishing Girl\" sounds very similar to the melody of \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". I don't know if this was intentional, but knowing the Dukes it probably was. Well, that's all I have to say now. Bye! -Chris P.S. By the way, in addition to XTC I'm also an avid Prefab Sprout fan...if there's anyone out there who cares to make a similar claim, they can reach me at chwirtalla@acad.ursinus.edu.

The reason I ask is that I noticed recently that Mr. Hugh Padgham is listed as the al- bum's producer. Though i had my doubts about a band that would name them selves after a Vonnegut character, the Padgham connection has left me somewhat curious. Anyone heard it? Thanks.

At the end of nice little article summarizing the Dummies' rise to popularity in Canada with their first album, and then in the USA with their marvelous second album GOD SHUFFLED HIS FAN (every XTC fan should hear it!) band leader Brad Roberts reveals his feelings publically: \"[Andy Partridge] is the best songwriter in pop music,\" Roberts says, suddenly leaning in to the tape recorder to make a direct appeal. \"Andy, I love you, I love you. Come to me, Andy.\" Until Andy answers this heartfelt call, the Dummies will have to make due with Elvis Costello. They open for him on his reunited-with-the- Attractions tour this spring. --Mike\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] Date: Sun, 17 Apr 1994 20:02:41 -0400 (EDT) From: JahUbik <PRSAVAGE@delphi.com> Subject: The Dukes As a first post from me, here are just a few thoughts on the Dukes of Stratosphear's \"Chips From The Chocolate Fireball,\" which I heard for the _first time_ this week. On the floor within two minutes! I know there has been a recent thread on this topic, so pls excuse any duplication. Some of this is easy to figure... some isn't. Being of an age and cultural background where I o-u-g-h-t to remember some of the influences the first time through (frankly, I was too blitzed!), here are my guesses at what they had in mind, based on one pass: 1) \"25 O'Clock\": intro--Pink Floyd (\"Dark Side\" era). Then other Floyd eras, King Crimson, the Nice. Instrumental breaks: The Doors, live. 2) \"Bike Ride To The Moon\": though it has some Who-like qualities (\"Happy Jack\", \"Pictures of Lily\", \"Quick One\" era), the correct reference point is The Move, a horrible shower. They were Roy Wood's first band, and really pricelessly bad. The reference is exact. Check out \"Night Of Fear,\" their first single. [Quelle horreur! Pure Spinal Tap, right down to the quotes from the \"1812 Overture\".] On \"Bike Ride,\" though, the borrowings are the sloppy bassplaying, and the \"now we rush to the front of the stage and scowl\" chunka-chunka sections at the end of verses. These were--if anything--the band's only distinguishing features apart from droopy mustaches and horrible satin shirts their mums made them! 3) \"My Love Explodes\": Jeff Beck-era Yardbirds. Nearest point: \"Over Under Sideways Down.\" But in terms of delivery (more Jagger-ish than Keith Relf-like), it could just as easily be related to Rolling Stones' \"Paint It Black.\" 4) \"What In The World\": lyrically, the daft \"In The Year 2525.\" Musically, it's the Beatles, esp. \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" 5) \"Gold Dress\": Yardbirds again: this one's \"Heartful Of Soul\" 6) \"The Mole From The Ministry = \"I Am The Walrus\" 7) \"Vanishing Girl\": The Hollies, around \"Bus Stop,\" Carrie Ann\" time 8) \"Have You Seen Jackie?\": intro: Traffic (\"Hole In My Shoe\"). Rest: Syd Barrett-era Floyd. \"Arnold Layne\" or \"See Emily Play\" are very similar in many respects, both subject and music 9) \"Little Lighthouse\": Jefferson airplane, a la \"Surrealistic Pillow,\" though there's more to it than that... 10) \"You're A Good Man Albert Brown\": Small Faces (\"Lazy Sunday), Kinks pre-1967 11) \"Collideascope\": Beatles/Lennon--\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\" crossed with \"Instant Karma\" 12) \"You're My Drug\": Byrds' \"So You Wanna Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star\" 13) \"Shiny Cage\": Lennon/Beatles' \"I'm Not Sleeping.\" Note \"Mr.Kite\" references 14) \"Brainiac's Daughter\": McCartney-flavor Beatles. Elements of \"Lady Madonna,\" \"Good Day Sunshine\" and \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" 15) \"The Affiliated\": intro is generic, Kinks-ish. The doubletime section (chee-ee-zy!) is Unit Four Plus Two, \"Concrete And Clay\" 16) \"Pale and Precious\": Beach Boys/Wilson...bits of \"Smiley Smile,\" inc. \"Good Vibrations\" (note theramin), \"Wild Honey\", then later ('up she rises'...) \"Help Me Rhonda.\" Early on, there are direct quotes from \"Heroes & Villains.\" For crazed deconstructionists, \"up she rises..\" is also taken from a sea shanty called \"Early In The Morning,\" inflicted on all English schoolchildren of a certain age. And (here's the point folks), as well known to them as \"Sloop John B\" is to kids in the US. Nice circular reference! In English Lit., there's a book called \"Books At The Wake,\" a compendium of references to other books in James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\". You could almost do that here...among other bands fleetingly heard: Spirit, Electric Prunes, Thirteenth Floor Elevators, Steppenwolf, Moody Blues (the intertrack kid's dialog), Moby Grape, and (maybe this is \"Little Lighthouse\" --Love, and their long (a k a sleep-inducing) \"Alone Again Or\" from \"7 and 7 Is\". Or was it the other way round... ) Also, the whole thing is very Mothers-ish (\"We're Only In It For The Money.\" Which is intended as a compliment... But is it good? I'm speechless...an amazing record. Completely daft, and wonderful too. I think I'll notice more influences on subsequent listenings. I asked myself halfway through: \"Does anyone else know how to laugh at themselves like the British? And is there any group more surreal?\" And \"they\" replied: \"The puffin sipped at his herbal tea and sighed: 'You can't get the buttons these days...' \" --JahUbik a.i ---------------------------------------------------------------- \"I am the mole in your potting shed; I'm the bad thoughts inside your head...\" --The Dukes ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][] For all administrative issues, such as change of address, withdrawal from the list, fan club addresses, discography requests (last update 17 April), back issues, FAQ list, etc., send a message to the following address: <chalkhills-request@chalkhills.org> The Chalkhills archives are available at \"http://chalkhills.org/\".
