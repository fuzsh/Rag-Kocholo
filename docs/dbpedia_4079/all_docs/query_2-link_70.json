        "text": "I can hardly believe it, a sincere question, and nobody dares to respond. No, just more Beatles/Floyd /Doors - \"but surely no serious scholar of the Art would consider Revolver to be anything but the crassest sort of pandering, how sad for you\" \"Oh yeah, well the Beatles!\" Let me hip you to a couple of things.\n\nNo. 1: there is no such thing as \"psych\". There is no such word as psych. Psych is a commercial category invented by used record dealers to try to add value to a Percy Faith album that has a picture of a girl in a miniskirt on the cover.\n\nAlso: Psychedelic music can be any music, if approached in the right frame of mind. The most transcendent exalted musical experience of my younger days was listening to Link Wray - \"Batman\", \"I'm Branded\", and especially \"Hidden Charms\" (all on a Chiswick compilation album of very dubious legal status); when Link sings the word \"charms!\", I can't really describe it, but it's like he has entered your ear and taken a bite out of your brain.\n\nBut of course, such experiences usually require drugs to really work. So there was an effort to synthesize them by clever studio trickery. Leslie speakers (how Tommy James did \"Crimson and Clover\", where his voice gets all ootzy), phasing (\"Itchycoo Park\", \"Sky Pilot\" and others too numerous), filtering (that thin, distant sound on some Bee Gees records), echo chambers that make a nice little Sunday pop combo into the Moody Blues, oddball instrumentation (Dr. John at his Night Trippiest), weird sounds coming out of nowhere, and often for no reason (the Yardbirds' \"Glimpses\"; what's that, a train whistle? A bunch of kids? Oh, that's heavy), and I could go on. Well, you know what Noel Coward said, \"Extraordinary how potent cheap music is.\" Or maybe he didn't say it. What is certain is, he was an old dude! Probably the most psychedelic moment of his life was throwing down two Bullshots on a blustery day! Screw that guy! He wasn't tuned in!\n\nWell, the New World that was a'borning had no time for Bullshots, or blueberry tea with the Major, and all your Bons Mots - all part of the past, and that past would surely be swept away and nobody would shed a tear. Popular favorites, those fussy little Cole Porter balls of Good Taste, what right do they have to exist?\n\nPsychedelic music was just what the world needed; well that plus Black radicalism. Protest songs were fine, but began to seem powerless against the real ememy, the horrible class-centered stasis that kept us all unfree and afraid, so here's something new on the radio that will make you sit up and take notice - and it sounds cool and you can dance to it, or maybe just reflect on how things could go so wrong. So if Pearls Before Swine invited us to \"Drop Out\" - what the hell? Makes more sense than staying on the old, righteous, My-Three-Sons, cornflakes from Battle Creek, Howdy Doody squaresville we were handed, and told this is the best you deserve.\n\nWell, I hope anyway that answers some of your question. But before anyone attacks me, I have no bone to pick with Beatles/Floyd/Doors. Or the Fudge, or even Ginger Baker's Air Force. But man, if you weren't there, you gotta trust me, we changed the world thru a lot of crazy records, and records have never been crazier.\n\nMy take is there is no such thing as \"psychedelic music\" unless you're tripping and then all music is \"psychedelic.\" The list proves that."
