There is no doubt whatsoever, they will always be known for their 1974 No 1 European wide hit ‘Sugar Baby Love’. A record that divides most people between those who love it and those that loathe it! Whichever camp you were in at the time you certainly couldn’t ignore it! it was played constantly everywhere. The song actually had quite an interesting background. Written by established songwriters Wayne Bickerton & Tony Waddington it was originally intended as a possible GB entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. It was offered to both Showaddywaddy and ex Move lead singer Carl Wayne who both passed on it. So Wayne & Tony took a bunch of session musicians into the studio and recorded it. The distinctive and remarkable falsetto was provided by singer Paul Da Vinci. When the record subsequently took off (in it’s demo form) with a TOTP performance (with the band a last minute substitute for a planned Sparks slot) the band was shown with Alan Williams (one of the aforementioned session players) performing as lead singer, miming to Paul’s vocal, Paul due to contractual reasons, having already signed a solo deal with another Record Company (Penny Farthing). Alan would subsequently re-record the single with his (very similar) vocal and mime to that (as was BBC policy at the time) on further TOTP appearances. That is the SBL story and one i have a bit of an issue with, of which more later! It’s easy to think of The Rubettes as a ‘one hit wonder’ but it shouldn’t be forgotten that although SBL was an immense hit, they followed it with 3 more Top 10 hits ‘Juke Box Jive’ (No 3) ‘I Can Do It’ (No 7) & ‘Baby I Know’ (No 10) plus another 3 Top 30 entries with Foe-Dee-Oh-Dee’, ‘Little Darling’ & ‘You’re The Reason Why’, a respectable, if not lengthy chart history. Away from the hits the other tracks spread over this 2CD set don’t settle down into any particular ‘style’ for the band or direction’ as they wander from soft pop ballads, to several Country-tinged numbers, Doo Wop & Sha-Na-Na inspired rock & roll. It’s this lack of any discernable established solid style & progression that the listener/buyer can follow that probably formed the reason that saw their recording career stall within a couple of years. The material chosen to record is pleasant, yet unremarkable and somewhat random. Included are 3 solo singles issued by Alan & John Richardson (the bands drummer) which include a rather fetching version of the Goffin/King classic ‘Take Good Care Of My Baby’ originally a big hit for Bobby Vee, which stands out and could have stood a chance of success with some good promotion. Without going into protracted reasons which space doesn’t allow, the band have had acrimonious falling out’s over the years resulting in Court appearances and 2 versions touring, one led by Alan Williams and the other by Bill Hurd. Disc2 of the set contains tracks featuring Bill such as ‘Fools And Lovers’ & ‘Everybody Knows’ which offer an interesting contrast to Alan’s vocals. The compilation concludes with ‘Cherie Amour’ (not the Stevie Wonder song) with vocals traded between Alan & John and of all the later tracks that followed after their hit period this is i think the strongest example, with shades of SBL and proof that Alan can deliver a good falsetto. Which leads me to conclude this review with that ‘issue’ i mentioned earlier. As is the case with many groups of the 70’s & 80’s The Rubettes are often called on to make guest appearances on TV in Europe on ‘Retro’ shows, especially in Germany, Holland & France. Naturally the producers of these shows want them to perform SBL. So why nearly 50 years on do these TV performances ALWAYS have Alan STILL miming to Paul’s original vocal every bloody time?! Stop it Alan, use your own vocal or credit Paul! My old friend & stalwart member of many years of Manfred Manns Earth Band, Steve Kinch was a Rubette for 3 or 4 years in the late 80’s early 90’s. Steve if you happen to read this review….thoughts on this please? As ever, the compilation as you might expect from 7T’s, comes in a sturdy clamshell box complete with an interesting booklet full of info and photo’s. Enjoy. All together now….Ah…Ah…Ah…Ah…..La!…La!…La!….\n\nfor more information go to https://www.cherryred.co.uk\n\nTil next time….take care & stay safe….Colin\n\nGerry Fortsch… I remember my mate Graham playing the drums and singing the high bit and he was so loud that he never needed a mike. Keep on Rocking in the Free World.\n\nMerv Kennard… I seem to remember that Sugar Baby Love was written for Showaddywaddy but they turned it down.\n\nColin Bell… Yes true, full story in my review\n\nMick O’Dowd… Had a lot of respect for these guys. Made a few floor-fillers in their time!\n\nSteve Kinch… Hi Colin, I think you’ve very accurately summed it up. Re: the “issue” – As you know, much of what the public sees and hears in the pop world is not entirely honest I don’t think The Rubettes are any worse than many other “pop” artists. I did quite a few TV shows with the Rubes… I don’t think TV producers would be interested if the band said, “We want to use this new re-recording”. It’s a sad fact of life that with manufactured pop groups, it’s all about the money and little to do with musical integrity .\n\nColin Bell… Hi Steve, thanks for the reply and insight about The Rubes, yes it’s a sad fact as you say regarding ‘manufactured bands’ It so happens i knew Paul Da Vinci back when SBL was recorded & he was a helluva nice guy who deserves his due recognition.\n\nDoes anyone remember Battersea Fun Fair? asks Colin Bell\n\nphoto Stewart Townsend. Cover from the 2020 book. More details… https://joylandbooks.com/books_new/battersea-fun-fair.htm\n\nColin Bell… After recently watching the film, ‘The Day The Earth Caught Fire’ which featured lots of memories of Battersea Fun Fair, I wondered who else has memories of this fair?\n\nRobert Carey… Worked right on Queenstown Roundabout in 60s and always over there. Great fun.\n\nPaul Crimin… Sure do!\n\nSteve Thorpe… Went there as a kid, I remember the high level walk through the trees and the water splash\n\nAlan Esdaile… I remember going on The Rotor at Battersea funfair and probably about 9/10 years old. Excited to tell my mates at school and explaining it went really fast, then you got stuck to the wall when the floor disappeared. No one believed me!\n\nPhil Little… Used to visit Battersea funfair when I first moved to London in 1972, it was one of the cheapest things to do.\n\nJane Hartley… I remember going as we had friends in South London, can’t be more specific though!\n\nColin Bell… The best thing for me was the Schweppes Grotto with its four caves ‘air’ ‘fire’ ‘earth’ and ‘water’ i’ll never forget crossing over the ‘molten lava’ in the fire cave, it was all magical for a 10 year old. The tree walk at night was amazing with its illuminated ‘dragons’ ‘pixies houses’ and animals etc. Then when you had seen all that next to it was the Guinness Clock with all its animations, a version of which came to Hastings seafront opposite the entrance to Robertson Street in the 1950’s. Different world but brings back so many happy memories in this grim time. Stay safe and well everyone x\n\nRick Pentecost… I went there a few times when I was very young. I loved it! Was there a Guinness Clock,- or did I imagine that?\n\nNicola Dobson… Yes my dad used to take me there..loved it and the roller coaster\n\nPeter Houghton…My partner comes from Battersea And he used to ride the rides before the fun fair opened. And he used to work on some of the stalls + worked in the cafe there\n\nJanet Horton… I had relatives in Middlesex at the time, it would be 1964 and I was 10. They took me to the fun fair, and I went in the grottos. Magic. It was funny at the time though, because I didn’t know you glowed purple and this woman came walking towards me. I thought she was a ghost, lol. Then she said, look at your own clothes and I was glowing purple. I remember it so well, we all laughed about it for ages.\n\nG Tatton… In reply to Colin Bell, Yes I do 1969, School trip for a week in London.\n\nLast night was spent at Battersea fun fair. My favourite was the motor boats three times on them. There was a governor on them below the accelerator, needless to say I wound mine down on one of them. We were under orders not to use the big dipper, because of our age. I’m watching , “Up The Junction” at the moment with Susan Kendal. The movie is from 1968. All about Battersea.\n\nDennis Torrance… Used to go there a lot late sixties with mates apart from the Big Dipper remember the gondola ride with mates there holding on tight to boat then seeing the walls go around we all cracked up lol\n\nCharmaine Bourton… Yes I remember Battersea Funfair = a treat for good behaviour! Two of the girls who were injured in the 1972 Big Dipper accident went to my school Ravensboure School for Girls in Bromley. I remember seeing one in hospital on “News at 10” and the other was very seriously injured but survived.\n\nRuby Whitman… I went on a works outing to Battersea fun fair in the 50’s. I loved it. What’s in its’ place now?\n\nDavid Gill… My girl friend and I when to the Battersea Fun Fare on a number of occasions, but one sticks out as being different. I was due to go into the RAF the next week and I wanted to leave my girl friend with something to remember me by. I won a teddy bear for her to cuddle only it was 5ft tall. Can you imagine trying to get on a tram with. 5ft teddy bear. We don’t have the teddy any more but more importantly we still have each other. In October we will have been married for some 62 years. But we still have a laugh at “teddies” expense. Dave and Pat Gill.\n\nJean Peck… (in reply to Colin Bell) Trying to trace the magical smell in the grotto. Aitkinsons perfumery of Mayfair London had some connection. They have moved to Italy. Wonder if Schweppes would have a record of it. Never forget that magical place. Our childhood treat .\n\nSMART SOUNDS by Colin Bell reviewing March Of The Flower Children: The American Sounds Of 1967, 3CD Boxset Various Artists\n\nMARCH OF THE FLOWER CHILDREN – The American Sounds of 1967 (3CD SET)\n\nAs anybody that has ever read any of the thousands of reviews I’ve written over the past 50 + years will know only too well, Psychedelia is my first and enduring musical love. So with apologies to those for repeating the fact yet again! but there’s always new readers to consider. This latest compilation from the ever excellent Grapefruit Records could have been compiled especially for me, and I couldn’t be happier settling in for a smorgasbord of sound lasting 4 hours spread over 3 Cd’s in this spanking collection featuring 85 tracks from some of the greatest names to feature in this mind bending musical genre. All the facets that make up the whole Psychedelic movement can be heard here, from hard acid rock, to folk rock. punk garage, toytown & sunshine pop & whimsical solo entries. Big names include Love, Vanilla Fudge, Young Rascals, Moby Grape, The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Steppenwolf, The Velvet Underground & many more, including the band who first got me hooked in 1966/67 the glorious & unique ultimate garage band The Electric Prunes. It was the latter’s use of twisted, distorted fuzz laden instrumentation on ‘I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night’ (not included) that set me out on my voyage of mind bending musical discovery. The big names mentioned are sprinkled across the compilation which is bolstered in the main by the less well known & some outright obscure bands & artistes, although a lot of whom will be known to fellow aficionados, such as The Seeds, The Cryan Shames, Blue Magoos, The Beau Brummels, The Rare Breed, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lemon Fog etc. Psychedelia had it’s roots in the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco and the Hippie movement with artistes like The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin & others in 1966 and by the ‘Summer of Love’ in 1967 reached it’s crescendo on both sides of the Atlantic. Here in Britain, which has been covered by previous Grapefruit compilations relating to 1967,we were listening to the likes of Traffic, Tomorrow, Spooky Tooth, The Nice, Cream etc etc, most of whom had drawn their inspiration from the San Francisco movement, although on the whole British psychedelia often tended to come in ‘softer’ form than its American counterparts. Anybody that’s already into the genre will understand what I’m relating, however for anybody new to the genre or want’s to revisit that most magical and experimental period this new compilation is an ideal starting point. There’s little point in me bombarding you with a lot of names to conjure with, especially for newbies, but here from across the 3 CD’s are, in my opinion, some of the standout tracks. The whole set kicks off on Disc1 with a band that I’ve always loved, The Peanut Butter Conspiracy, with a tasty morsel (see what i did there) with the up-tempo mix of snarling guitar & Fifth Dimension style harmonies that make up their excellent offering ‘It’s A Happening Thing’. This is followed by, what for me, are the ultimate & finest exponents of the whole genre, Love. Arthur Lee’s vocal and lyrics have always had the ability to transport me to another world, here represented by iQue Vida!’ lifted from their superb 2nd album Da Capo. As is common with a lot of Love’s songs on first hearing they sound all sweetness and light, but on closer inspection are often unsettling and menacing, yet always superb. Great to see the inclusion of old friend, the late Tim Rose with the original recording he made of the classic ‘Morning Dew’ still the definitive version as far as I’m concerned. I was working with Tim on some gigs when he sadly and unexpectedly passed away in 2002, a great loss. Elsewhere on Disc1 are great tracks from the underrated Paul Revere & The Raiders, The Lovin Spoonful, The Mothers of Invention, The Kaleidescope, Harpers Bizarre & Eternity’s Children. Disc2 gets us underway with a stunning Prunes type track from a band unknown to me The Zodiac with a track entitled ‘Aries’ replete with a solemn spoken part, interwoven with melding Eastern music with rock, all very dark and mysterious. Then it’s on to a stone cold classic, with the majestic strains of Vanilla Fudge with their famous alternative version of the old Supremes hit ‘You Keep Me Hanging On’, here in it’s edited radio 3minute version as opposed to the full length album version that ran to 7 & a half minutes. This is followed by my all time favourite garage/psyche band, the previously mentioned Electric Prunes with ‘Hideaway’ a ‘B’ side of one of their lesser singles, but nonetheless a great track. The familiar names follow on with Moby Grape & The Stone Poneys with ‘Fall On You’ & ‘Evergreen Part One’ respectively. The track that lends the compilation it’s title follows with the splendid The Seeds and ‘March of the Flower Children’ which sounds more akin to something one of our own homegrown esoteric bands might have produced. Other tracks on Disc2 that stand out come from The Byrds with the seldom heard ‘Lady Friend’ & also The Cyrkle, The Lemon Drops, Captain Beefheart & The Endd amongst others. Disc3 features another personal favourite band with Steppenwolf & ‘The Ostrich’, another seldom heard track. The excellent Strawberry Alarm Clock are represented with ‘Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow’ ( a real psyche title if there ever was one!). Buffalo Springfield with ‘Bluebird’ and The Velvet Underground with ‘White Light/White Heat’ put in welcome appearances. There is an additional plethora of great songs from many obscure and unlikely artists such as Nilsson and surfer boys Jan & Dean! An honorable mention must also go to The Chamber Brothers with their classic experimental ‘Time Has Come Today’, a big personal favourite. The compilation concludes with The First Edition fronted by Kenny Rogers, who would of course become a solo Country superstar later in his career. Here he appears with his band who produced some classics of their own, famously with ‘Ruby Don’t Take Your Love To Town’ the wonderful ‘Somethins Burning’ and the psyche offering ‘Just Dropped In – To See What Condition My Condition is In’ (you can enjoy this in the video at the end of this review). It just remains for me to compliment David Wells once again, the head honcho at Grapefruit Records, for another superb compilation, lovingly compiled and accompanied as ever by an informative booklet crammed with info, photo’s & images. So, draw up a comfortable mushroom to sit on, put on your favourite headband, pass the Hookah and drift awa………y…..enjoy.\n\nfor more information go to https://www.cherryred.co.uk\n\nTil next time…stay safe….Colin\n\nStephen Moran… Great review Colin\n\nMick O’Dowd… This contains so many bands that I never classed as psych! Maybe that’s why I never caught on to it until recently, through your posts Colin. Great stuff by looks of it and as I say i’ve heard and appreciated a lot of these artists\n\nColin Bell… Mick, I think to be fair, some of the artists you didn’t class as psyche, ultimately weren’t, but went through a period of experimenting during ’66/’67 before returning to, or moving on to other more suitable genres for them\n\nMick O’Dowd… Got into a lot of these from the samplers The Rock Machine Turns You On & Thr Rock Machine Loves You. Priced at an amazing (even in those days) 14/6d!\n\nColin Bell… Mick, Great samplers, really got a lot of people interested and as you say cheap, even then\n\nPete Prescott… So many bands ! Wow !\n\nClaire Lonsdale… Would love to hear it! X\n\nAlan Esdaile… Some great names here and a good sleeve.\n\nPop All Niter – Black Widow, Casuals, Voodoo Chile, Martyn James Expression and Colin Bell Disco Show. Hastings Pier 20th August 1971\n\nMick ODowd… Was that the same Casuals that hit with Jesamine? If so they are a strange addition to a “heavy” bill.\n\nJan Warren… yes, I remember this track and included on a compilation double album called “Fill your head with Rock” which I used to have!!\n\nDen Bray… Oh dear…\n\nColin Bell… So, this was what i was doing 39 years ago on this day. I had to glue the night together with one of the strangest line ups. from lightweight pop band The Casuals (Jesamine) to ‘satanic rockers’ Black Widow, who needed a volunteer ‘virgin’ for their ‘sacrifice’ on stage, i politely told them they were asking the wrong person….\n\nConan Howard… was that not truly awful? what utter rubbish\n\nGerry Dawson… was roadie for Voodoo Chile, best Hendrix tribute band ever, note for note…..\n\nAlan Esdaile… tickets were available from someone called Carlton in Warrior Square. Maybe the promoter?\n\nColin Bell… Still remains one of the weirdest gigs i ever did, mainly for reasons i can’t put in print! More than the edited version I said above!\n\nSMART SOUNDS by Colin Bell reviewing The Who : Concert Memories from the Classic Years, 1964 to 1976 Book\n\nTHE WHO – CONCERT MEMORIES FROM THE CLASSIC YEARS – 1964 to 1976 Edoardo Genzolini\n\nA couple of weeks back, i brought you a review of Italian author Edoardo’s book on Cream. I somewhat cheekily ended that review by noting that Edoardo had also had a work published on The Who, prior to that of Cream in December 2022 and if the publisher, Schiffer Publishing, would like to send me a copy……Thank you Victoria for doing just that, here are my thoughts on this hefty tome, in all senses of the word. As i mentioned in my summation of Edoardo’s work on the Cream book, i found myself in the company of a new author (to me) who i could completely empathise with, who loves music and film passionately and whose passions were ignited at the age of around 13, as indeed were mine. Edoardo came to The Who by watching the film of Woodstock. That in itself is paradoxical as i know from Pete and Roger that they hated the event and would happily forget all about it personally in many ways, although it did of course bring The Who to a worldwide audience. I was intrigued by the premise of this new book as it takes a fresh approach to the story of the band during the decade + it focuses on, and uses, in the main, the reminiscences and thoughts of a wide ranging group of fans and the authors insights. As Eduardo puts it ‘It’s the reflection of what my thirteen-year-old self would have loved to read about The Who from someone else’ i.e. from a fans perspective as an audience member watching the sights and sounds of the band. Now here i should just explain briefly for those not familiar with my own ‘career’, i first saw The Who on Hastings Pier back in May 1967 when i was just starting out in the music biz working backstage. Since those first early days i have had a lifelong association with the band, which includes working at their Record Company Track Records, attending dozens of gigs and parties with the band, interviewing them for Press and Radio etc etc. So, in short i have been a lifelong fan of the band and their music, and also had the privilege of seeing and hearing a lot of the stories recounted in this book at first hand. Indeed it has been really interesting to compare the contributors thoughts on central characters involved in The Who’s story, such as early mentor Pete Meaden and infamous later band Managers Kit Lambert & Chris Stamp. The whole question of were The Who a Mod group? or rather a reflection of a whole movement. What was the reason for all that wanton destruction of guitars, amps, drums etc? and how was it financed? Is there really at the heart of the band a great tension between Pete & Roger? all these questions and so much more are discussed and chewed over. Each year is prefaced by a ‘scene setting’ editorial from Edoardo before it’s given over to the thoughts from all the many participant’s he has tracked down for this exemplary book. And i haven’t even mentioned the dozens of photos, many, many of which appearing for the first time in black & white & colour. And it’s fascinating to see the ‘amateur’ shots taken by fans which painfully reminds me personally, of all the wasted opportunities i had in front of me at the time, had i only had the presence of mind to whip out my Kodak’Brownie’. But i was by then in ‘work mode’ and taking photo’s wouldn’t have occurred to me, an everlasting regret. But to return to the book. I am frankly amazed by the clarity of peoples memories of the bands, but then i shouldn’t be, where as i may have become ‘blase’ to a Who gig, for many it was one of the highlights of their youth (or indeed lives) because rarely have i attended any concert by ANY band that contains so much ferocious energy as that that emanated from Pete, Roger, John & Moony at their height. It’s quite clear to me that Edoardo is fascinated with the character of Pete in particular, for reasons i perfectly understand, he is a complex and mercurial individual and not always an easy person to know. But as the creative force of the band his outlook and views are always interesting and often controversial. I have always got on much more easily with the down to earth approach of the less intense, yet equally interesting Roger. Many books have been written about The Who over the years, mostly from a scholarly musicologist point of view, this work is from a huge fan who has taken the time, as he did with the Cream book, to once again assemble a work that includes meticulous attention to detail, coupled with a fund of stories and anecdotes from avid fans that illustrate the love and respect this most seminal of bands is held in. Without sounding smug, i may have not personally learnt much that i didn’t already have some knowledge of. but it’s been fascinating comparing notes with other like minded people. If i have one critiscism at all, well more of a minor niggle really, it’s that many of the contributions are from American sources, i would have liked to have heard more from the British side, nonetheless, I hope Edoardo continues to write further books on other bands as I am increasingly attracted to his whole style and approach. As i said at the start of this review this is a hefty A4 + sized hardback tome, that weighs in at several pounds, and runs to 304 pages complete with the 100’s of photo’s mentioned earlier. It’s not cheap at a recommended price of £54.99. but it’s produced to the highest standards, on fine quality materials and as a treasure trove of material for the true Who fan it is quite truly indispensable.\n\nAvailable from https://gazellebookservices.co.uk Amazon, etc.\n\nSee you again soon. Take care and happy reading….Colin\n\nEdoardo Genzolini… Hello Colin, your two reviews about my two books were simply wonderful, and it was a pleasant surprise to find a kindred spirit in you. It comes as even more surprising to realise you were THAT close to The Who in the sixties! Giving the book a more American take, as you rightly observed, became a necessity, as I must admit I was getting a lot of scepticism from the majority of the UK fans I have met. But I am sure I was just out of luck! In fact, I am working patiently on a new volume with mostly UK material and memories, including people who were very close to the Who. Now that I know you were a fortunate insider, I would find wonderful if you could participate! We’ll go into that in private, if you like. Thank you again and best wishes!\n\nColin Bell… Hi Edoardo, thank you for the kind words, feel free to DM me anytime. Best wishes Colin.\n\nRichard Porter… Edoardo, My wife’s first husband was Roger’s accountant. We socialised with him and his family.\n\nKen Wilson… Saw them on the pier Hastings they were brilliant ,early 60s\n\nBarry French… Was lucky enough to get tickets to see the WHO at the Central Cricket ground Hove a couple of weeks ago. A breath taking show that highlighted that Roger Daltrey is still one of the great voices in rock (The scream at the end of “Wont get fooled again” got a huge cheer from the crowd & nearly made my ears bleed ) & that Pete Townsend is a genius guitarist with more tricks than Paul Daniels & more windmills than the Netherlands. Absolutely Brilliant !!! (These guys are nearing their eighties!!)\n\nSMART SOUNDS by Colin Bell reviewing Cream: Clapton, Bruce & Baker Sitting on Top of the World San Francisco, February–March 1968 Book\n\nCREAM, CLAPTON, BRUCE & BAKER – SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD -SAN FRANCISCO- FEBRUARY-MARCH 1968 Book. Edoardo Genzolini (additional contributions Tony Palmer & Bill Halverson)\n\nIt’s not so often these days I review music books, compared to the many reviews of new editions of mainly 60’s & 70’s music i regularly publish. However, I am more than happy to present this new handsome tome to you, kindly sent to me from its American publishers Schiffer Publishing. Given its subject it couldn’t really have arrived at a more apposite time given the recent passing of Pete Brown, lyricist for much of Cream’s and Jack Bruce’s work. I know many of you reading this will have encountered Pete in the last few years, when he chose to live in our part of the world up until his passing in May. So, let’s get the physical book details noted first. The book comes in hardback form, 9inch X 9inch, beautifully printed from its embossed cover to its 144 pages containing (on high quality paper) some 175 colour & black & white photo’s many not seen before, there are some glorious performance shots. The title is self explanatory, this is a meticulous and lovingly crafted in-depth look at Creams performances at 2 legendary San Francisco venues. The Fillmore and The Winterland. It was at these 2 venues in February 1968 that Cream established their reputation in the States and were captured on film by British documentary filmmaker Tony Palmer and recorded on audio by Atlantic Records. This, i have to say, quite remarkable work, will tell you EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know, on and off stage, about those legendary times when Cream were arguably at their pinnacle. Reading the foreword by the author Edoardo I immediately recognised a kindred spirit. Edoardo is an Italian who lives and works as a teacher in Perugia, Italy. Born in 1991 as he morphed into a teenager from 12 to 13 he discovered Cream through hearing their music whilst indulging in his other love, the movies. I can completely empathise with that, music and film have been my 2 lifelong passions. This leads him to write with an enthusiasm, and yes, a complete love of his subject. The amount of research he must have done is phenomenal, but I’m guessing it was a complete ‘labour of love’. He delves into the minutiae of the band’s performances with relish, whilst providing anecdotes and meticulously examining what may have been a short time period, but an incredibly important one in music history. A lot of music books are often ‘dry’ but not this one. Obviously, it will appeal to Cream’s most die-hard fans the most, but the casual reader will also be well rewarded. The venues the concerts took place at are also historically important in the annals of rock. The old Fillmore Auditorium still exists, sadly The Winterland Ballroom doesn’t. This book apart from providing all the information on Cream’s performances, will also serve as an invaluable reminder to those patrons that were lucky enough to attend these venerable venues in their heyday. And that’s important, i know from my own perspective from all the venues i have played at in my career that no longer exist physically, but live hugely in our memories. To summarise, this is a book that preserves for posterity in infinite detail an exciting period in the raw power trio that was Eric, Jack & Ginger who in their time set the rock world alight. And finally, here’s the kicker for this reviewer, where i have to be nonest, before i get letters from regular readers of mine who will know, i am not and never have been a Clapton fan. it may be heresy to all you guitarists, but its the truth. However, did i enjoy Cream in their day? the answer to that is a big fat truthful yes! I understand Edoardo has also written a book on The Who, Schiffer if you want to send a copy this way………\n\nTil next time…..stay safe…..Colin\n\nAvailable from Gazelle Book Services. https://gazellebookservices.co.uk/\n\nSMART SOUNDS by Colin Bell reviewing Matt Monro: The Complete EMI Recordings 1971-1984, 4CD\n\nMATT MONRO The Complete EMI Recordings 1971-1984 (4CD SET)\n\nIt’s going to be impossible for me to get through this review without experiencing a great deal of remembered early emotions. I could have sung ‘Portrait of My Love’ or ‘Softly As I Leave You’ to you when i was aged 8 or 9. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you who recorded the songs. They came to me through my Dad an inveterate whistler & singer at work and around the house, i would listen to him and sing along, he loved Matt and all these years later so do I. This new 4 CD set from Strawberry Records is several hours of blissful recordings from what could be said to be the ‘second coming’ of Matt. As the title says this is his complete output for EMI spanning 1971-1984, which takes the listener up to shortly before Matt’s untimely death in February 1985 aged just 54. There are 4 separate albums, 15 singles, out-takes, rarities, previously unreleased live recordings and alternate mixes. Whenever i see the words ‘new mix’ attached to songs i know from any artist, it often fills me with dread as to what some engineer has done. Here however there is not cause for alarm but indeed for rejoicing as what we have are the finished mixes taken from the original masters as opposed to the ‘rough’ mixes that have been previously issued. Such as with Matt’s second album released on EMI’s Columbia imprint ‘The Other Side of the Stars’ which had sat on a shelf for 2 years before given an inferior release. On that release and other albums like ‘For the Present’ even vinyl dubs had been used previously. Now with this exhaustive new issue the full extent and power of the recordings can be heard as they should be. Matt had originally started his recording career at Decca & Fontana in the mid to late 50’s with little success. It really started for him when he was paired with the great Sir George Martin at EMI in 1959 and they would go on together to produce Matt’s biggest hits like the ones i referred to above. After a highly successful period of record success, international tours and worldwide acclaim, collecting accolades from the likes of Frank Sinatra who described him as ‘the best singer in the world’ in 1966 EMI transferred Matt from their Parlophone label to Capitol Records which necessitated a move to the USA, given that he was by then an international star it would seem a logical move. However the next 4 years up until 1970 were largely filled with frustration for Matt who became increasingly disenchanted, if not angry at his treatment by Capitol, who it has to be said were more concerned with the bottom line rather than allowing him the time he had previously enjoyed to make quality recordings as he had done back in the UK with Sir George. I was astonished to read in the accompanying booklet to this set, how Capitol would send Matt across town to record at another studio whilst they ‘re-mixed’ or ‘overdubbed’ recordings he had made without any regard for how Matt felt. It seemed like a deliberate act to keep him out of the way.. The situation couldn’t go on and by June 1970 Matt had had enough, recorded his last work for Capitol and returned to the UK and back into the arms of EMI & Sir George where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1971 he returned to the studio with Sir George at the helm, however by then Martin was increasingly busier with the independent and highly successful Air Studio’s he had created in Oxford Street & ultimately producing duties would pass to Martin’s close friend and partner in Air Studio’s, John Burgess, a guy i had the pleasure of meeting around 1973 who showed me around the studios. It was at Air in 1972 that a charming occasion took place whilst Matt was recording a cover of The Beatles ‘Michelle’. Normally whilst at work Matt did not encourage family to be in the studio. However, on this occasion his daughter Michele was invited to her puzzlement to be in the control room. Matt was finishing up recording his take on The Bee Gee’s ‘First of May’ (see YT clip at the end of review). With Sir George conducting the orchestra Matt beckoned Michele into the studio and with Sir George counting in the orchestra sang his version of ‘Michelle’ to her live whilst holding her hand. That must have been a wonderful moment. Like many artists songs Matt covered, he could take them and with that unique way of phrasing he had make them his own, as he did with ‘Michelle’ & the aforementioned ‘First of May’ which i actually prefer to the original. Throughout the 90 + tracks spread across the 4 CD’s there are some other cracking covers such as ‘What A Wonderful World’ ‘Over The Rainbow’ ‘I Can’t Stop Lovin You’ to name but 3, sitting amongst a wealth of original songs, and how nostalgic to hear Matt singing ‘let the train take the strain’ reminding you of much loved commercials from years past. For those seeking a full tracklist go over to Strawberry Records page on Cherry Red Records website. I simply don’t have the space to list them all here. But i can say without hesitation there is not a duff track in sight. I admit i could live without the inclusion of foreign language versions of a few songs, but that applies to any artist I’m listening to, it’s not just confined to Matt. When it comes right down to it, every superlative adjective in the dictionary has been used when discussing his wonderful voice over the years. I have no new ones to add. Was he the best ‘crooner’ this country ever produced? As far as this writer is concerned the answer is a resounding yes. One listen to this handsome new compilation will I’ve no doubt convince you of the same. The compilation itself, is beautifully presented as a fold out 5 piece, complete with some excellent colour photos and a very interesting booklet featuring reproductions of album sleeves along with a full account of the period covered. Congratulations Strawberry Records on a truly splendid release. Enjoy.\n\nFor more information go to https://www.cherryred.co.uk\n\nTil next time…..stay safe…..Colin\n\nAlan Esdaile… What a Voice! Wonderful.\n\nPete Prescott… One of the very best for me. After Beatles Day I would spend time listening to Matt Monro albums. Wonderful singer. His pronouncement of the name “Michelle” was the only thing he ever did that annoyed me. That’s just me. A “singers singer!”\n\nSue Skilling… He had a wonderful voice\n\nSMART SOUNDS by Colin Bell reviewing Frijid Pink: The Deram Recordings 1970-1971, 2CD Remastered Edition\n\nFRIJID PINK The Deram Recordings 1970-1971 (2CD)\n\nI’ve been looking forward to this 2CD set from Esoteric Records containing the 2 albums they released on Decca’s ‘progressive’ offshoot label Deram back in 1970 & 1971. Both albums have been re-mastered sympathetically I’m pleased to say & sound great. The band from Detroit will always be known for their 1970 psychedelic rock re-working of traditional song ‘House of the Rising Sun’ using the template recorded by The Animals 5 years previously in 1964. By the time Frijid Pink released their version in early 1970 a lot had changed in the intervening years. Psychedelia had come & gone (almost), R&B had evolved, Rock & Pop were splitting in different directions & Prog Rock was on the rise. In many ways Frijid Pink were late to the party with their blend of psyche rock & blues & in other ways were on trend with the way rock was evolving. Sadly, they have long been written off as that ‘one hit wonder’ band with the fuzz driven ‘Sun’ single. Detroit has always been known mainly for Motown, however it also had a thriving rock scene where ‘Pink’ would share the stage with the likes of The MC5 & The Amboy Dukes. Their self-titled debut album released in February 1970 which forms the first disc in this new set was never bettered by them in my opinion. Comprising 9 tracks, plus the addition of 2 bonus tracks for this release. It is a far more cohesive collection of psyche rock/blues than their subsequent albums. It kicks off in fine style with ‘God Gave Me You’ a melodic rocker that was to have been their debut single before being pulled in favour of issuing ‘Sun’ which although more commercial i think ‘GGMY’ would have probably fared well. Track 2 ‘Crying Shame’ heavilu features the fuzz toned overdriven guitar sound the band would become known for & rocks hard with some driving drums. Track 3 ‘I’m On Mt Way’ switches gears to deliver a fast driving blues number which doesn’t seem out of place or jar with the preceding tracks. Followed by Track 4 ‘Drivin’ Blues’ which continues the vibe in the same vein. Track 5 ‘Tell Me Why’ seamlessly switches back to the emphasis on a hard rocking fuzz laden mid tempo rocker which showcases their distinctive sound. Track 6 lands us back in a rock/blues mix, complete with some excellent drum work on ‘End of the Line’ Track 7 needs no introduction it’s their signature song & Top 10 version of ‘House of the Rising Sun’. Track 8 ‘I Want To Be Your Lover’ delivers more uptempo blues/rock with a fine lead vocal from Tom Beaudry (aka Kelly Green) & more fine drum work from Rick Stevers. The final Track 9 ‘Boozin Blues’ is a laid back number which wouldn’t sound out of place in a John Mayall set with some fine little blues licks tinged with a hint of fuzz & some nifty piano & closes the album in fine style. All in all a very satisfying album & thoroughly enjoyable. Then we come to the 2 ‘bonus tracks’. The final one, Track 11 ‘Music For The People’ which was released as a single the following year in March 1971 is really rather good with its Gospel choir backing, Hammond organ & fine central vocal performance on a mid tempo ballad. The problem for me comes with the preceding Track 10, where the band obviously hoping to repeat the success of ‘Sun’ picked another classic song to re-vamp, in this case ‘Heartbreak Hotel’. An unwise move, frankly it’s a mess, with its clunky mix of Jerry Lee Lewis piano, screaming vocal & overwrought guitar. Somebody should have stepped in & said let’s forget this, but that didn’t happen & I’m not the least surprised it sank without trace. I would love to say Disc2 in this new compilation lives up to Disc1 but in my estimation it just doesn’t. Released only 5 months after their debut album, which seems hasty to saythe least, ‘Defrosted’ featured here in this new release with it’s original 8 tracks plus an additional 4 bonus tracks lacks the cohesion that made the debut album a great listen. It kicks off with some promise with opener ‘Black Lace’ a heavy rock number, with a bluesy element that promises much but ultimately becomes, dare i say it, somewhat mundane. Track 2 ‘Sing A Song of Freedom’ , which although it doesn’t say so here, I’m fairly sure got a single release, is better & harks back to their superior material on Disc1. Track3 ‘I’ll Never Be Lonely’ sounds like the composer has been spending his time listening to ‘Whiter Shade of Pale’ on repeat, let’s just say it’s derivative. The remaining 5 tracks are a hotch potch of numbers, none of which really hang together & do nothing to dispel the lack of any defined direction. I really wish i could be more enthusiastic but by the time i reached instrumental ‘Sloony’ I’m sad to say my interest had waned considerably. However, there is one shining moment that redeems Disc2 & that is the inclusion (as one of the bonus tracks) of ‘We’re Gonna Be There’. Now thereby hangs a tale. Back in 1971 when i was writing my ‘Top Sounds’ column for local newspaper the Hastings Observer i raved about this particular track in my column of Saturday July 10th 1971 when it was then titled ‘When Johnny Comes Marchin Home’ (the famous old Civil War song). The band had taken the song & like ‘Sun’ put their unique spin on it to great effect. And if any of their single releases was ever going to repeat the success of ‘Sun’ this was the one. Years later i was looking for the track to play on a radio show only to find the band had re-christened it ‘We’re Gonna Be There’ a play on the original lyrics of ‘Johnny’. And cheekilly given themselves a writing credit! Not sure how they got away with that, however I’ve always loved it whatever! I’m thinking maybe I’ll record ‘Rule Brittania’ & call it ‘Rule the Waves’ & grab a writing credit….no probably best not!… In conclusion Frijid Pink have always ranked well in my estimation, especially, as discussed above, for that first album & how many bands can say that Led Zepplin opened for them in Detroit? Frijid Pink can! That & the psychedelic ‘Sun’ bestows everlasting immortality on them.

But that won’t do will it.. That’s just the view of this reviewer who has been in love with psychedelia since it’s apogee in 1967, as any regular reader of my reviews, columns, or listeners to my specialist radio shows will know. Back in 2016, Cherry Red’s psyche label Grapefruit Records released the glorious 3CD set ‘Let’s Go Down And Blow Our Minds’ which was hugely well received ( & reviewed in these pages) now after a long anticipated wait, here 7 years later is its companion piece. Once again the whole 3CD set has been given all the love and attention it deserves. 3 Discs each housed in separate sleeves sporting their own cover designs (& disc designs) housed in a beautiful sturdy clamshell box, accompanied by a lavish 48 page booklet annotated by label boss David Wells, a guy for whom my admiration grows with each release he oversees. The booklet contains many rare photo’s together with sleeve covers & fascinating facts on each track to introduce the reader to the collection, & it kicks off with a quote from John Peel. Which could not be more apt, a) given his well known love of the genre & b) on a personal note, he was to become an early mentor & friend to me back in those halcyon days. So let’s get into all the delights on offer for your ears & senses to revel in. We kick off our lysergic drenched journey on Disc1 with what is probably most people’s’s idea of a classic piece of psychedelia in Traffic’s ‘Paper Sun’ which perfectly sets the scene for the 78 tracks to follow in its wake, over what will be a 4 hour journey down the rabbit hole. Immediately following Traffic is one of my all time favourite psyche bands Tomorrow, with ‘Revolution’ (no not The Beatles track!), the band comprised of several luminaries including Twink (Pink Fairies) & Keith West (of ‘Grocer Jack’ fame). ‘Revolution’ was the follow up to their near hit earlier that year with a cover of Nazareth’s arrangement of ‘My White Bicycle’ awash with ‘phasing’ & backward tape loops & all manner of effects so redolent of the whole scene Tomorrow for me have always been a major favourite & the version of ‘Revolution’ included here arrives in an alternate mix which is a bonus. I should add that many alternate takes, debut appearances & rare nuggets surface throughout the collection, to mine & I’m sure over aficionados delight. Tomorrow are followed by Caleb ( who will be known to those aforementioned aficionados) an early bandmate along with a certain Reg Dwight in Bluesology, prior to releasing such nuggets as ‘Baby Your Phasing is Bad’ included here, the i think the title says it all! As ever it’s the obscure that delights me, but here Grapefruit Records have done a great job balancing this box set with its plethora of the little known, with the big names such as The Troggs, Elton John, The Strawbs (with Sandy Denny), Eric Burdon & the Animals, The Marmalade, The Flower Pot Men etc. Highlights for me on Disc1 come with some favourite tracks from excellent acts Tintern Abbey, The Syn, The Alan Bown! Johns Children & Hastings Pier stalwarts Episode 6 with ‘Love, Hate & Revenge’ bringing back some happy memories for me of working with the latter many times. And so onto Disc2 which opens with the piercing vibe of ‘Dive Into Yesterday’ by the criminally underrated & largely forgotten band Kaleidoscope, who like so many bands that surfaced at the time didn’t quite make it, but thoroughly deserved to. The Move put in an appearance with one of my favourite ‘B’ sides they ever made, in ‘Wave The Flag And Stop The Train’, which was originally coupled with ‘I Can Hear The Grass Grow’. The Move are joined on Disc2 by other big names The Who, Simon Dupree (& it’s not ‘Kites’!), Procol Harum. The Bonzo’s, DD,DBM&T, Nirvana, The Spencer Davis Group etc Some of the most interesting, & greatest psyche bands put in stellar appearances such as The Attack, The Virgin Sleep, The Mirage & The Artwoods with a special mention to another band i had the pleasure of working with on several occasions, in the shape of Orange Bicycle with ‘Hyacinth Threads’. They were a great band who combined vocal harmony work on par with The Beach Boys combined with intoxicating melodic psyche, a band i could listen to happily all day. As usual when writing about music i love I’m conscious i don’t have the space to discuss EVERY track! (as much as I’d like to), so we must move on to the final disc in the set Disc3. Starting with The Hollies and their foray into psychedelia (headed by Graham Nash) with Top 20 hit ‘King Midas In Reverse’. a great classic, but unfortunately it would also turn out to be the record that would cause the split within the band, that broke them apart with Nash leaving to form CS&N, but that’s a whole other story. Of all 3 discs this one serves up the greatest number of recognisable names with David Bowie, The Idle Race, The Pretty Things, The Small Faces. The Herd The Zombies etc, although you won’t find the ‘usual suspects’ tracks that most compilers put together, another plaudit to David Wells. Amongst the obscure & delightful are contributions from The Creation, The Tickle, Norma Rowe, The Action & Circle Plantagenet. Also, great to see the inclusion of Dave Davies with his second hit follow up to ‘Death Of A Clown’ with, to my mind an equally great record ‘Susannah’s Still Alive’ which sounds better in quality here (it usually sounds muddy) so thanks to whoever cleaned it up. New to me was The Bystanders track ‘Royal Blue Summer Sunshine Day’ a band that usually covered American harmony hits, they later morphed into Man the rock band. I never cease to marvel at all the tracks that surface after all these years that even die hard fans of the genre like me can still be surprised by. The whole collection comes to a close with the wisdom of Pete & Dud & ‘Bedazzled’ which to those of us of a ‘certain age’ brings a warm nostalgic smile. As the compilation alludes to with its title ‘Too Much Sun’. There were many bands in that wonderful ‘summer of love; in 1967 that took flight, some soared to happy heights and were rewarded with fame and glory and some, like Icarus, (the legend, not the band!) flew too close to the sun and crashed and burned to be forgotten. However like the man said, better to crash and burn than slowly fade away….enjoy\n\nfor more information go to https://www.cherryred.co.uk\n\nTil next time….stay safe……Colin\n\nAlan Esdaile… Great sleeve Colin and some interesting tracks. 1967 a Great year for music!\n\nMick O’Dowd… Even me who as you know wasn’t aware of what psych was i’ve actually heard a lot of these bands and hadn’t put them it that pigeonhole!
