No need to get into the outtakes that were added to later deluxe editions. At least in my view, they detract from an otherwise excellent and coherent album.\n\nReleased approximately a year after the stunning performance at Monterrey Pop in June 1967, Cheap Thrills was much anticipated by all and somewhat maligned by critics, Rolling Stone critics in particular, who thought the album was not up to the by then fabled live performances and that Big Brother was not up to the task of Janis Joplins back-up banda position that James Gurley, Sam Andrew, David Getz, and Peter Albin, a well-known and said to be respected top five San Francisco band, said to have been the house band at the Avalonin the thick of the heavy, psychedelic SF sound, with the finger picking electric guitarist James Gurley named by some as the father of the psychedelic guitar; seemingly born to trade licks with Sam Andrew; died Dec. 20, 2009--before Janis Joplin was brought on-board, were probably surprised to find themselves relegated to. Within months after release, Joplin would leaveprobably encouraged to do so by Clive Davis and/or Albert Grossman, the band's then management, taking Sam Andrew with her temporarily.\n\nJohn Simon, the producer (notably for his work with The Band on Big Pink and The Band, famously found Big Brother very hard to work with and refused to put his name on the album credits. Less famously much of the band apparently found John Simon to have no clue whatsoever as to the psychedelic music that was coming out of SF. (May be a fair analysis. Hard to think of a band less psychedelic than The Band. But was Big Brother with Janis really a psychedelic band?)\n\nProbably not much can be added about Janis Joplin. Found dead on October 4, 1970 of an apparent intravenous heroin overdose. Alcoholic, a druggie, promiscuous probably even by late 1960s Haight-Ashbury standards, but sensitive, vulnerable, insecure, a good sister, a reliable correspondent. But absolutely the real deal. Those that doubt it should watch the Monterey Pop clips. Or for that matter, the Festival Express clips from June/July 1970. Looking rather road hard and put up wet, and sounding rather scratchy, only three years after Monterey, and with an extremely competent back-up band that did not have nearly the energy and none of the spontaneity of Big Brother nor the chemistry with Janis. She delivers in spades, although that is one rather lame rap in the middle of Cry Baby.\n\nBig Brother could not seem to do much after Janis left, even after Sam Andrew came back. And Janis put out a series of albums with various back-up bands, none of which in retrospect was very good, at least to me. You know you have not down great when your best known and probably best efforts from the time are a novelty song about cars, and a somewhat adequate version of a genius Kris Kristofferson song. Such a waste. Such a shame. Folks used to blame the record company and management back in the day. Here is it richly deserved. Folks like Rolling Stone deserve blame, too. Turns out they did not know as much as they thought they did, perhaps. On the other hand, Lester Bangs write-up of Janis at the time of her death seems spot on, although it is not always clear what he is concluding. Maybe it is impossible to draw conclusions and that is the point!\n\nRe the album itself: To me every cut good. Sound very immediate. Would anyone want to make this album some smooth and over-engineered, non-live sounding, say Sargent Peppers? Musicianship not polished exactly, but authentic and creative. Enormous chemistry among the entire group. Was the music of the late 1960s really as good and groundbreaking as it seemed at the time? I think this album says \"yes.\" Clearly one of the best and most enduring albums of 1968, which is saying something.\n\nSo, I present, for your consideration, in Bill Grahams words, Four gentlemen, and one great, great broad . . . \n\nRaisendot, do you like Janis' later work better? Top musicians. I am sure money was going into material.\n\nTo me, but for Big Brother, Janis would be remembered maybe at the level of Joss Stone or Joan Osborne. Nice pipes, sounds Black, nothing particularly original, much less fresh. Did nothing a score of Black singers did not do better decades ago. EDIt: For intance, we have (or had, she seems to have thrown a rod somewhere along the line) Etta James. We do not need a white Etta James. END EDIT At least that is the way it seems to me.\n\nAnd I do not think Janis would have had the energy on stage but for the SF experience. EDIT: I think she started in the Austin, TX folk scene. It woudl not have been a natural progression! END EDIT\n\nEDIT: BTW, as I indicated, the material that was added to the deluxe versions of the album does show pretty weak and sloppy work by Big Brother. I tried to find some source as to how consistent they were in concert. The New York critics did not like them like--though they were too loud for one thing, which may mean they really did not get the point. I forget who backed Janis at Woodstock, but that was a distinctly weak effort, if memory serves!\n\nTo me the stuff that seemed good at the time that came out of SF, seems all the better today. (The Doors were LA, but I still think their first album is absolutely killer and most of their work was pretty good. I do not think you can criticize the banks musicianship!) The stuff that seemed bad then--The Dead's early albums, for instance, still seems bad to me. QSM early stuff on record seems weak, even though they were suposedly very good live. The Airplance from \"Surrealistic Pillow\" through say \"Volunteers,\" or at least through \"Crown\" seems great. Again, hard to fault the musicianship, at least to me.\n\n<Sure Janis may have made more iconic recordings with more polished bands.>\n\nHenry, Do you mean she \"could have\" or \"actually did\" make more iconic recordiings? I can envision where Hendrix would have gone if he had lived. I am not sure about JJ, though. I think J Morrison was spent no matter what, but who knows, if he had had modern rehab, maybe not. The Doors were collectively pretty intact.\n\nSorry to keep chiming in, but I agree wonderful cover art by R Crumb and absolutely perfect for the album. R Crumb was among the central figures--or at least his comix were, he is one wierd guy personally and I do not know whether he even got out of the house much--to the SF scene. I could not find much detail on it, but apparently the first Zap Comix issue was published \"early in 1968.\" \"Cheap Thrills\" was release in June 1968, so I wonder what the timing was on the cover art. If someone found R Crumb and had him do the cover before the first Zap comic, someone was really onto something.\n\nA few related factoids: The band wanted to call the album \"Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills\" and wanted the cover to be a picture--a photograph as I understand it--of the band members \"naked\" in bed together, but Columbia Records nixed both. I am not sure who brought in R Crumb to do the cover art or when that happened, but apparently what became the front cover was originally intended by R Crumb for the back cover, but the band nixed whatever RC had drawn for the front.\n\nI was not able to track down an image of whatever it was that R Crumb orginally drew for the front cover, but I did not try too hard to find it. It must be out there on the internet somewhere. Also, sources seemed a bit ambiguous to me as to whether the band simply wanted a \"picture\" of themselves in bed \"naked\" for the cover, or whether that photo was actually taken and then nixted by the record company. I do not think I have ever seen it but it must be out there if it was actually taken.\n\nJanis and the married and father of as small child James Gurley rather famously became lovers, but split up soon after--but apparently not immediately--after JG's wife showed up one day at the flat Gurley and Joplin were sharing with babe in arms and family dog by her side to guilt trip him back home. Apparently, Gurley's wife and Janis were friends and managed to stay reasonably good friends throughout. In 1966, all members of Big Brother, and all wives and children, and presumably dogs, moved into a house and lived together. Those were rather \"heady\" days, so to speak. I think Marty Balin said that Grace Slick had slept with every member of the Airplance but him. But I could not find anything on whether JJ ever had any romantic or sexual involvement with any other band members. It was likely no small thing emotionally/mentally for JJ to leave Big Brother in late 1968.\n\nNancy Gurley died of a heroin overdose n 1970 and James Hurley was charged with murder for giving her the injection. He spent the next two years fighting the charges and eventually pleaded, I take it, to some charge or other for a sentence of probation. This may help explain why Big Brother never quite got its feet back on the ground even after Sam Andrew returned to the group. Its star was a bit heartbroken and preoccupied. If I recall, a drug bust of one of its leading members similarly doomed QSM.\n\nThe other item I was not able to track down, is that I thought that Big Brother was somewhat \"outside\" many of the SF groups such as the Dead, the Airplane, QSM, and a bunch of others (Blue Cheer comes to mind), who were in turn pretty tight among themselves. That Big Brother was perhaps more of a \"blue collar\" SF band and more closely associated with the Hells Angels than others were. I could not find anything directly on that though. It appears that Big Brother was playing similar gigs in similar places to any of the other SF bands--Marty Balin's Matrix Club, for instance, and the Avalon, and, of course, later the Filmore--and that various SF bands, especially perhaps the Dead, played Hells Angels sponsored functions, as much or more than did BB.\n\nI also do not know when JJ started using heroin. I would have thought that as late as 1968-69 junk would have been a very uncommon thing in SF hippie circles. But to have both Nancy Gurley and JJ die in 1970 of intravenous overdoses of heroin suggests maybe the BB crew got started earlier and perhaps they were hanging out with a different crowd. I had somewhat of a recollection that Janis overdosed, similar to John Belushi, on a speedball--a coke-heroin combination. But what I looked at seemed to reference only heroin for Janis, with some indication that alcohol too may have played a part. Somewhat a confusing picture, my impression is that most real junkies are beyond bothering with alcohol. Yet, Janis seemed to be fixing by herself in a hotel room--unlike party boy Belushi. So was she strung out? Was this an occasional thing or what exactly? To me, toward the end she looks way more like an alcohol than a junkie.\n\nAlso, I would have thought that JJ's hard alcohol use would have been very unusual in 1967 among SF-scene people, yet I think she was drinking Southern Comfort on stage from the bottle at Monterey Pop in June 1967. BTW, I was very pleased to learn that she much preferred Jack Daniels to SC.\n\nIf anyone has any further information on any of this or images, etc., please share!\n\nSorry to keep chiming in, but I agree wonderful cover art by R Crumb and absolutely perfect for the album.

I am a long time fan of bay area music scene, and the 67-70 period is the most interesting and influential time of them all!\n\nPete\n\nyou sure know your stuff strother. I guess I would just add Moby Grape to that pre 1967 list, they formed in '66 although they only became well known after they played at Monterey Pop in '67. The only reason i remember this is that they and/or their lead guitarist Jerry Miller, used to play a lot in the bay area during the 70s when I was in college.\n\nWow! Sounds like you come by it more honestly and reliably though, RP! I am not worthy given that you were actually there, or were there soon after. No telling what incorrect Wikipedia and/or internet stuff I am passing on. Some of the things I remember never happened.\n\nDid Skip Spence really leave Airplance pre-1967 to help form Moby Grape? I thought he was with Airplane longer than that after Grace Slick came on board. MG did play Monterey Pop, though, for sure, I saw a reference to that in looking at MP stuff. I won't cheat by looking any of this stuff up on the net, but my recollection is that MG was something of a supergroup, made up of guys that all had reputations and all could sing and/or write songs. A great group from that era and the genre, except I had a slight recollection that MG was really an LA group, for some reason. I will look it up after this message. Anyway, MG is underremembered and underappreciated, but they did not last very long. I forget whether it was Skip Spence's mental problems that brought it to an end.\n\nMaybe we should collectively come up with a list of the groups that were a part of that Bay area sound?! There are lots that I have left off. Again, trying not to cheat, was Beautiful Day SF? Youngbloods? Love? (Talk about a monster underappreciated group!) Even Electric Prunes, Iron Butterfly. And after awhile there was New Riders, maybe Hot Tuna, groups like that, which were sort of spin offs. Where was Tracy Nelson from? The group that did \"People\"?\n\nHere is Wikipedia's list Bay area bands part of the SF sound. I am not sure why the split between \"Main\" and \"Other Groups.\" I would say that Country Joe was in the thick of it. I do not have a good feel for whether Sly was a real part of the scene or sort of separate. Great Society may have been important early. I do not know. It was Grace Slick and her then husband's band, but my impression was that it was more of a folk group. Clearly Steve Miller needs to be on here and I would sure think Mother Earth, which was Tracy Nelson's band and which was SF, although Tracy N being originally from Madison. I do not know how I left off Santana, for crying out loud, formed in 1964. The Charlatans need to be on the list. Beau Brummels seem a bit early for present purposes. Some of these folks I do not know. (Love, Spirit, Iron Butterfly turn out all to be LA, along with folks like the Doors.)(Youngbloods were an east coast transplant to SF and Sir Douglas Quintet from Texas, and clearly both belong on the list. Prunes were NYC. Paul Butterfield, et al. were associated with SF stuff, but unlike Steve Miller, I do not think it can be said that they actually moved out of Chicago.):\n\nBands\n\nMain Groups\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nThe Great Society\n\nSantana\n\nFrumious Bandersnatch\n\nMoby Grape\n\nQuicksilver Messenger Service\n\nSly and the Family Stone\n\nIt's A Beautiful Day\n\nBlue Cheer\n\nBig Brother and the Holding Company\n\nThe Flamin' Groovies\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage\n\nWe Five\n\nThe Beau Brummels\n\nSopwith Camel\n\nThe Mojo Men\n\nThe Charlatans\n\nFifty Foot Hose\n\nThe Ace of Cups\n\nOther Bay Area Bands\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\n\nChocolate Watchband\n\nCount Five\n\nSyndicate of Sound\n\nCountry Joe and the Fish\n\nThe Loading Zone\n\nThe Immediate Family\n\nThe Vejtables\n\nPeople!\n\nDoes anyone remember a group called \"Blue Crystal\"\" or \"Crystal Blue,\" something like that from this same time period that was very psychedelic? I remember listing to such a group back in the day but have never been able to track them down!\n\nThe Bay Area certainly had its Beat pioneers, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, originally from NY, and Peter Martin who jointly opened the famousl CityLights among them, although it is probably more fair to them to consider them broadly avante guarde than Beats, which might be narrower. And the City seemed to have a very solid coffeehouse culture in general. And where there are Beats there is art and literature/poetry.\n\nIt was very hard to tell from what I saw how various things connected. Some of the musicians, such as Marty Balin, seemed to have solid connections to coffeehouse folk type circuit. And West Coast jazz had an element in the City. Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesch I think were connected to that.\n\nBesides R Crumb, from Ohio, as I recall, there were folks like Mouse, from a drag racingn background if I recall and probably from Southern California, also drawn to the late 60s SF scene. Very hard for me to tell though how the pre-existing local scene whether art/music/literature meshed with the hippie movement exactly.\n\nAnd there were those Esalen Institute types such as Fritz Perls that really originated in NY, too, but were too wild for that psychotheraputic community.\n\nI guess in general SF was a tolerant community--as well as a wonderful place in general--which also helped the gay community along there.\n\nIt is actually very curious to me what happened that the Bay area seems like a fairly influential city as far as avante guard culture in the 50s, which was followed by enormous activity in music and other popular culture really for a few years in the late 60s, and then not so much. I know there is a blues scene in SF, but heck there is a decent blues scene in Washington, DC, and DC is not usually considered all that hip. John Lee Hooker did settle there late in life via Clarksdale, Mississippi. Folks from the 60s groups we have been talking about were involved with the founding of the Doobie's as I recall--Dino Valente--aka Fred Power maybe?\n\nOne would think the Bay area would support a enormous amount of music and number of groups of all kinds though and it does not seem to. Of course, Detroit and Philly, and Macon, Georgia, were once thriving music centers, too, but they are not any more. The US seems to consistently have NYC, LA, Nashville, Chicago (although as Kanye says, everyone leaves Chicago) and arguably New Orleans and/or Lousiana in general, maybe Austin, then to have room for one other place at a time--Athens, Georgia; Seattle; Minneapolis, maybe, Memphis, maybe. Maybe it was just SF's turn, although SF seems like it is a bigger city and cultural influence than that. It makes sense that LA is where the recording studios are so maybe LA draws off all the musical groups these days.\n\nAnd folks like Sly Stone did not seem to be a part of the same thing as many of the others. Maybe Santana was not either. He was around a long time before the late 60s.\n\nAnyway, it did seem hard to follow the cultural connections."
