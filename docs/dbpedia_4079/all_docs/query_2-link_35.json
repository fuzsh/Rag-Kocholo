        "text": "I hope you are all doing okay out there and keeping you and your loved ones safe. A crazy time to be alive as this pandemic takes the world by it’s ankles and shakes it silly. This new collection of commingled balearic beauties has been lovingly curated by myself and will give you a moments peace and a time to breath. So rest and close your eyes and wander upon anywhere you want to be . . .\n\nKeep you and your love ones safe x\n\nBlimey, it’s turned right chilly here at the top of Folk Funk Towers. November is limping by and winter will soon be upon us. I’m all layered up to keep warm. It would be lovely to be riding a Lambretta around bathed in mediterranean warmth right now.\n\nI had a scooter once years ago, I was more a mini fan in my youth, had 5 of them in various colours and conditions, but once I had a Vespa. I always wanted a Lambretta, but not being very useful with a spanner I opted for a PX125, burgundy with metallic checks. I was bloody useless at riding the bloody thing, and it would jump gears all the time. It was like trying to ride a noisy bucking bronco.\n\nThis mix is of a balearic nature, whatever that means. It was going to be called European Journey but I opted for the Terje Rypdal track title. This is the sort of mix I’d have done for Balearic Social, or Maldelsauce or Lions Milk, or Eclectics but I’m not on Social Media anymore, for my own sanity. I hated Facebook, always comparing myself to the happy people posting images and fun updates, and as for the music pages I was forever thinking “I NEED THAT RECORD” but I haven’t the money. It was making me sad. Well even more sad.\n\nAny way, here is an hour of lovely music you don’t need to own as I have uploaded it for you to hear for free. Listen to it and think of riding a scooter or driving a mini around somewhere warm.\n\nA scooter ride in the sun would be nice right now.\n\nThe First Darshan (Song For Ameera) by Ingrid Chavez\n\nFrom A Flutter And Some Words released on Ten Windows Records in 2010.\n\nMexican-American poet and vocalist Ingrid Chavez, born in 1965, was a Prince protégé from 1987 to 1991, and was married to David Sylvian from 1992 to 2005.\n\nHer debut album was initially intended to just set her spoken-word poetry to atmospheric music supplied by Prince, but when Warner Brothers pushed for the album to have sung vocals, Prince abandoned the project, so half of the album ended up as intended, and the remainder consisted of pop songs co-produced by Ingrid with Prince’s studio hands Michael Koppelman and Levi Seacer Jr.\n\nChavez also wrote the bulk of Madonna’s hit “Justify My Love”, and received a large out-of-court settlement for not being credited on that single’s initial release. In later years, Chavez focused on parenthood and photography, and occasionally contributed vocals to various David Sylvian releases.\n\nCerddi celain [David Colohan Remix] by Wermod\n\nFrom 2018 in conjunction with Sunstone Records.\n\nThis remix is by David Colohan, an Irish Folk vocalist, guitarist, songwriter and producer.\n\nRecordiau Wermod are proud to present the fifth release of Wermod featuring reworkings and inspirations from three leading lights in the acid Folk World.\n\nFeaturing contributions from Australian psych folk act Trappist Afterland (who has recently released their seventh album on Sunstone to critical acclaim ) Irelands’ David Colohan (of United Bible Studies) and the United States troubadour Bee (In Gowan Ring) Songs of Temporary Displacement will accompany a UK tour featuring the three acts as well as the legendary Keith Christmas.\n\nThe contributions of these artists have been loosely categorised as Folkphonic utilising the original Wermod master tapes and incorporating them into their intricate acoustic compositions.\n\nThe CD was released in conjunction with a Neuadd Ogwen , Bethesda gig that featured Keith Christmas, Trappist Afterland, Bee (In Gowan Ring) and Dave Colohan on the 6th of April 2018.\n\nArtwork\n\nBy myself, more can be found here\n\nTime Is Passing by Sun\n\nThe orange vinyled album Sun Power was released in 1977 on Capitol Records.\n\nAmerican funk group from Dayton, Ohio, led by Byron Byrd.\n\nSun was a brainstorm of Byron Byrd, a young Ohioan given to stargazing and eventual pursuits of Aerospace engineering and research science, developing the use of wireless microphones and guitars for the stage.\n\nBut music began for him as a hobby. Byron’s first bands were Over Night Low and the Ohio Majestics, which gigged around the area and as support for acts like The O’Jays and The Spinners. The horn section even cut a session for James Brown at King Studios for VP Henry Glover. Members of this band included James “Diamond” Williams, Marvin “Merv” Pierce and Clarence “Chet” Willis, all of whom went on to The Ohio Players.\n\nIt was in 1974 that Over Night Low, while opening for Mandrill at the Ohio Theatre in Columbus caught the attention of record producer Beau Ray Fleming, who’d worked with Mandrill, Jon Lucien and Zulema up to this point. He heard them on stage and came from the dressing room to peep the scorching band – up close. At the after party, Beau was doubly surprised to see them again.\n\nDetermined to connect he went backstage, met the players and they exchanged numbers. In under a year, he flew back to Dayton from his New York offices with contracts in his briefcase. Sensing the need for a stronger band concept, Byron, Beau and the group began searching for a new name, something that would give them a more universal and cosmic vibe. Beau said Celestial Sun, but band member John Wagner suggested they make it less of a mouthful and just call it Sun.\n\nThey thought surely somebody already had that name, but they didn’t. Thus. Sun was born. Shortly after that, the group was being signed to Capitol by Larkin Arnold.\n\nShe’s Lost Control by Grace Jones\n\nThe Joy Division cover version is the B side of the 45 Private Life released 1980.\n\nIan Curtis primarily drew lyrical inspiration for She’s Lost Control from a young woman with whom he had become acquainted through his employment as an Assistant Disablement Resettlement Officer at a Macclesfield occupational rehabilitation centre between 1978 and 1979.\n\nThe woman had epilepsy and had been desperate to find employment, yet she suffered seizures whenever she came to the exchange, which would greatly disturb Curtis.\n\nAt one stage, this young woman ceased attending her appointments at the occupational rehabilitation centre. Initially, Curtis assumed she had found a job, but he would later discover she had died of an epileptic seizure.\n\nHer unexpected death and Curtis’s subsequent awareness and experiences of the stigma endured by individuals suffering from neurological impairments formed the lyrical inspiration for the song."
