        "text": "By the time Wilson first took LSD in April of 1965, he had experienced panic attacks and made the decision to stop touring with the band. Upon taking the drug, he says that his creativity spiked dramatically, which elevated his songwriting abilities to unprecedented levels. Suddenly, the pop tunes he was creating were considered high art with complex, multi-layered production. His genius shone more clearly than ever. Unfortunately, his behavior became erratic and he became reclusive and unproductive. He stayed in his bedroom, ate unhealthily, and became obese.\n\nWilson claims that LSD “fucked with” his brain. He says the auditory hallucinations started when he first took LSD and now advises people not to take drugs.\n\nIn spite of Wilson’s belief that it was the LSD that caused him to start hearing voices, it is much more likely that the drug exacerbated his pre-disposition to schizoaffective disorder. Since LSD is known to mimic the effects of schizophrenia, it’s easy to see how Wilson could believe that his first LSD experience put him on a path to a life of auditory hallucinations and delusion thinking.\n\nAll five of these mad musical geniuses suffered from schizophrenia, or (in the case of Wilson) a related illness like schizoaffective disorder, which simply means that there is a mood disorder in addition to the schizophrenic symptoms. The onset of schizophrenia typically occurs between the teen years and the early 20s for men. Each of the men discussed here was within that age range when their psychotic symptoms first manifested themselves. Given that experimentation with LSD was so common, particularly among musicians and creative types, in the mid to late 60s, it’s no wonder that the schizophrenic tendencies of these five men correlated with their hallucinogenic experimentation.\n\nIn summary, the term acid casualty is typically misused and antiquated. We now know that LSD consumption doesn’t cause schizophrenia and that it can actually be used to improve mental health (e.g., when it’s employed to treat addictions). It’s time to stop referring to Peter Green, Syd Barrett, Roky Erickson, Skip Spence, and Brian Wilson as acid casualties because doing so diminishes the perception of their art. Instead of lamenting what could have been, let’s appreciate the great music that they did leave behind. Their legacies are rich and their music brought and continues to bring, joy and purpose to countless numbers of people across the globe."
