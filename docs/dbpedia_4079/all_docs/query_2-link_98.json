        "text": "1966 and 1967, years in which I respectively turned six and seven years old, are often considered the time when rock’n’roll “grew up” and became “rock” thanks to the pointedly unrolling and perhaps theoretically conceptual nature of albums such as Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band; when Elijah Wald named his often cluelessly maligned (and only occasionally clueless) 2009 “alternative history of American popular music” How the Beatles Destroyed Rock ‘N’ Roll, this is clearly the Beatles era he had in mind.\n\nSgt. Pepper’s he says, and George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue 43 years before as well, “were hailed not only for being different from the dance music of of their periods but also as signposts for the future.” For evidence he cites a London Times headline proclaiming that “The Beatles Revive Hopes of Progress in Pop Music,” and points out that no rock critics seemed to comprehend how James Brown might be more musically advanced than the Beatles, just like almost none heard how Chic might be more advanced than the Ramones or Bruce Springsteen a decade later. You could say (Wald doesn’t) that the musique-concrète sound montage of “I Am the Walrus” at least kind of anticipated Grandmaster Flash’s adventures on wheels of steel and other hip-hop mastermixing of that sort. But then so did John Cage.\n\nAnyway, I should leave the Beatles alone; they’re the only artist with four albums in the countdown below, and rock’n’roll “dying” was hardly all their fault — or even the Beach Boys’, who drowned the three or so beautiful hymns on Pet Sounds amid atmospheric film-soundtrack schlock. By the tail end of 1967, when The Who Sell Out came out in the UK full of cutesy commercial parodies as tedious and punchline-free as any subsequent generation’s rap-music skits, less-than-the-sum-of-their-parts “concept albums” were clearly a thing of the present. With albums suddenly being conceived as artworks, it’s no coincidence that rock criticism itself more or less came to be at this same moment — Crawdaddy‘s first issue was dated February 1966.\n\nMeanwhile, Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention and the Fugs (and even more so solo Fug Ed Sanders on the utterly gross coda of ESP-Disk’s aural underground newspaper East Village Other compilation) decided playing orgiastic perverts was the ultimate in transgressive freak bohemia. More wholesomely, the Byrds and Syd Barrett’s Pink Floyd figured out how to treat rock as space exploration, just as Apollo missions were first getting off the ground; unidentifed-flying-rock idiot-savants (or at least future contrarian obscurantist cult heroes) like the Monks, Godz, Red Krayola and Hapshash and the Coloured Coat blasted off even further, setting controls for black holes deep inside their own brains. And after the Spring of 1966, when within just a couple months Bob Dylan (“Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands”), the Rolling Stones (“Goin’ Home”) and the Fugs (“Virgin Forest”) all closed albums with tracks that ran longer than 11 minutes, everybody from the Mothers (“The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet,” 12:22) to the Seeds (“Up in Her Room,” 14:27) to Love (“Revelation,” 18:57) took that as a permanent green light (as the Godz would say).\n\nWell okay, not everybody. Not even close. The thing about this supposed surge in progressiveness is that, at least by the end of ’67, it had only affected a fraction of pop music out there. There was still plenty of absolutely unpretentious rock’n’roll for cleancut teenagers to dance to (Tommy Roe! the Monkees! Paul Revere and the Raiders! Tommy James and the Shondells!), even if increasing amounts of it (Electric Prunes, Chocolate Watchband, Strawberry Alarm Clock, not to mention Simon and Garfunkel’s dorky obsession with “feeling groovy”) did emit a certain absurd smoking-banana-peels-thinking-they’ll-stone-ya aroma. If Jefferson Airplane, the 13th Floor Elevators, Jimi Hendrix, Big Brother and the Holding Company and the like experimented with euphoria-inducers for real, their music still rolled regardless. And bros like Mitch Ryder, the Sonics, Downliners Sect, the Hombres, Standells, Shadows of Knight and so on still sound more like their chosen intoxicant was beer — in the Swingin’ Medallions’ case, several pony kegs of it. Heck, Hank Thompson (a country not rock guy but whatever) even actually credits beer in his album title!\n\nIt could even easily be argued that the predominant rock sound of ’66/’67 was blue-eyed soul absolutely oblivious to impending artistic self-consciousness or any psychedelic so-called Summer of Love: Mitch Ryder, Swingin’ Medallions, Animals, Them, Box Tops, Rascals, Soul Survivors, American Breed. If Van Morrison and Alex Chilton and even Ryder got more self-conscious later, and if the morose worldview of Eric Burdon (and maybe Sean Bonniwell of the Music Machine) helped make the world safe for the blow-hardiness of Jim Morrison (and ultimately Iggy and Ian Curtis and a million goths), well, you can’t fight ambition. Soul of the less blue-eyed variety was even more abundant, though maybe also less concerned with making albums you could enjoy from start to end — Though to be honest I’m not sure whether longplayers over this two-year stretch by the Bar-Kays, Bobby Bland, Dyke and the Blazers, the 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, Robert Parker, Otis Redding, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Sam and Dave, Joe Tex, Dionne Warwick, Jackie Wilson and the like were actually more bogged down by filler, or whether I just prefer the kind of filler that bogs down dirty-white-boy garage-punk (not called that at the time by the way) LPs. I’m perfectly willing to concede the latter.\n\nWhat I can say for sure is that, per the pre-Pepper’s norm dating back through the Beatles’ and Stones’ early albums via the Brill Building to Tin Pan Alley, most artists I’ve mentioned were still recording covers like crazy. My 12-year-old daughter: “Why are you playing so many different versions of ‘These Boots are Made for Walkin'”? Because they were there, that’s why. The Sonics do a surprisingly doo-wop-worthy take on the jazz-pop standard “Since I Fell For You,” and I love that Brenton “Oogum Boogum” Wood tried his beach-sanded hand at the Count Five’s “Psychotic Reaction.” I must also sadly report that the 4 Tops’ rendition of “Last Train to Clarksville” is every bit as embarrassing as Cassandra Wilson’s three decades down the line.\n\nAnd let’s just say that everybody interpreting each other’s material (because strategic publishing income perhaps) makes for at least as palpable a sense of pop-music community as the intermittently refreshing if usually inexplicable Haight-Ashbury utopianism that, after a Summer of Race Riots, would before long be supplanted by the dystopianism of early heavy metal and, well, There’s a Riot Goin’ On and so many backstab-forewarning ’70s soul successors. Say what you want about Zappa (never had much use for the guy myself) but at least his atypically unsarcastic “Trouble Every Day” on Freak Out! sounds in sync with what was really happening in the world. Pessimism (nihilism? or maybe I just mean lack of hippie-dippie naiveté?) doesn’t hurt the Velvet Underground or Doors, either. And maybe what helps make the Lovin’ Spoonful and Desmond Dekker so convincing when they’re optimistic and sunny (which is usually) is that in “Summer in the City” and “007 Shanty Town” they’re anything but.\n\nI sort of alluded to this earlier, but seems to me one thing post-Pet Sounds/Pepper’s progressivism solidified was the idea of a young adult audience. In the ’50s when 45 and 33 1/3 rpm were new (they’d both been introduced to stores in 1948), record companies initially pitched LPs to grownups and singles to kids. But as young’uns weaned on (particularly early ’60s) rock’n’roll grew older, they matured into a new market. I’m guessing the primary precedent would have been the largely college-age folk-revival fans who pushed six Kingston Trio albums to Billboard‘s pinnacle for 50 weeks total between late 1958 and late 1960 — who were also probably Dylan’s first fans, and who by ’66 were no doubt merging with Beatles fans. Or something.\n\nOr maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about. How old were most jazz fans who’d relied almost exclusively (and most Latin rhythm fans who’d relied at least heavily) on the album format from the start, and whose genres are generously represented among my ’66/’67 top 150 below? Cinema and theater soundtracks (I list one) and avant-garde compositions (John Cage and Amm) and Folkways-style musicology field recordings (two, including a colonialist-titled real-life Inuit precursor to the Residents’ 1979 hoax Eskimo) had likewise been longtime 33 1/3 standbys. On the other hand, the Beatles scored seven #1 Billboard albums themselves that first charted in 1964 and ’65 (total weeks in top spot: 60!), while Dylan didn’t top Billboard‘s album chart until Planet Waves (huh??) in 1974. And after Dylan and possibly the Lovin’ Spoonful or Byrds or Simon and Garfunkel (two albums apiece), the most famous folk-revivalist on my ’66/’67 list (since the Holy Modal Rounders and my Gold medal winners Kaleidoscope aren’t as famous as they should be) is Janis Ian, who at 16 years old was not quite a young adult herself yet when she released her unjustly ignored debut album in 1967. So what the heck do I know?\n\nWell, to answer that, I have deduced that albums were a fresh enough commodity during this period that several couldn’t even decide what they were called, either being branded right off the bat with two different titles (often the two biggest hits), or changing titles as years trucked on or minds changed or foreign territories craved their own pressings. Also, despite LPs’ increasing prominence in the world of rock, many of the albums I include are by acts universally remembered, if they’re remembered at all, as singles artists — many of whose albums barely charted in the first place. Some, like say the American Breed, have to my knowledge no presence whatsoever in the annals of rock criticism; histiographically, it’s like they never existed. And as far as the 5 Americans and Jay & the Americans and the Association go, they still don’t — None of those groups made even my list. I’d love to know how many of these 150 records were out of print, say, a decade after their release. Quite a few, I’d wager. The streaming age seems to have rectified that somewhat, if anybody even cares anymore. Regardless, with or without the roll, rock still has a fickle memory."
