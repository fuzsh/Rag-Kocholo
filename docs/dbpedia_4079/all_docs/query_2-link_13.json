        "text": "Growing up in San Francisco, walking down Haight Street regularly after High School was out, pondering what it was like to live through the Summer of Love…wishing I could have experienced that moment in time: it was inevitable that I would be drawn to the psychedelic music that came out of that era. In the mid-80s you could still find relatively inexpensive classic psych records from the late 60s and early 70s in the bins of Revolver Records and Street Light. You could submerse yourself in the incredible compilations that had been more-recently produced like the game-changing Nuggets and Pebbles releases, The Garden of Delights series, Acid Visions and so many more.\n\nBy freshman year of High School I was digging in deeply to the genre, with three bands being my triumvirate of psych brilliance: The Electric Prunes, with one of the quintessential psych singles I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night, The Chocolate Watchband, the psychedelic meets garage powerhouse from Los Altos via a riot on the Sunset Strip, and The 13th Floor Elevators, hailing from Texas with their transcendental lyrics and iconic fuzz-guitar-meets-jug-band sound. I collected their records, played them to death, read whatever I could about them, and bought records of other bands that were mentioned in the articles I could find. I was a rabid consumer of lysergic sounds.\n\nPsychedelic music is much like the surrealist art movement, an unexpected and powerful defier of reality and in some cases the social and political unrest of the day. It is blissful escapism, it presents dreamy utopias…intriguing looks into strange, wonderful worlds that are ever-changing and free…often deeply philosophical, pondering what it is meant to be an evolved human. And some of it is just pure, tripped-out nonsensical bliss. Leave your body behind.\n\nThe best way to get into psychedelic music is to connect with other fans of psychedelic music. There used to be a store called Mod Lang in El Cerrito that was a ground zero for paislied discoveries, which is where I first heard July, and when I started working at Warner Bros., record collecting legend Geoffrey Weiss would make me tape after tape from his vast and far-out collection while writer and Imperial Dog Don Waller would host me for sessions in his Laurel Canyon house, where he would spin single after single of psych/punk/garage brilliance while hopped up on his delicious and addictive coffee cookies.\n\nLast week, I decided to ask a bunch of friends—writers, musicians, enthusiasts—to offer up their favorite psychedelic records, stressing that I did not want a list of records they THOUGHT defined the genre, but records that they found themselves listening to the most on a regular basis. And many got back to me, with inspired lists that included albums I knew, that I forgotten about, and some that I had not yet heard (which blows my mind after all these years of collecting). As psychedelia is somewhat amorphous…shifting…melting and undefined…each contributor ingested my ask in different ways. Some gave me a list of albums, some sent over a list of singles…there are lists that contain new AND old bands and there are lists that show that the “psychedelic” moniker can be more liberally used for different kinds of bands and sounds. Some simply listed their favorites, and some gave wonderful analysis. All of the lists sent to me are below…in no particular order…and they are all super compelling, with the most often sited band being, yes, The 13th Floor Elevators while Pink Floyd’s Piper At The Gates of Dawn reigned supreme from their regal UK throne. As far as modern psych bands mentioned, The Flaming Lips are the torch carriers. Which makes total sense.\n\nI’ll start with my list, which is purely focused on records that came out in the late 60s and early 70s (if I had included more modern music, The Spacemen 3 would have definitely been featured). These lists combined are a triumphant musical answer to Timothy Leary’s question: “What do you turn on, when you turn on?” This newsletter is dedicated to the memory of Greg Shaw, who was such a huge proponent of psychedelic music.\n\nLost Dreams by The Electric Prunes (which I was lucky enough to work on)\n\nEaster Everywhere by The 13th Floor Elevators\n\nThe Best of The Chocolate Watchband by The Chocolate Watchband\n\nJuly by July\n\nJust Colour by The Lollipop Shoppe\n\nSell Out by The Who (especially the mono mix)\n\nPebbles Vol. 3 (Various Artists)\n\nFuture by The Seeds\n\nAfter Bathing At Baxter’s by The Jefferson Airplane\n\nPiper At The Gates Of Dawn by Pink Floyd (especially the original UK mono pressing)\n\nDreaming With Alice by Mark Fry\n\nJoel Selvin, Critic, Author\n\nExcuse my SF bias…\n\nBombay by It’s a Beautiful Day\n\nSection 43 (Rag Baby version) by Country Joe & Fish\n\nViola Lee Blues by The Grateful Dead\n\nLSD-25 by The Gamblers\n\n1982-A by Sons of Champlin\n\nTomorrow Never Knows by Steve Marcus\n\nInterstellar Overdrive by Pink Floyd\n\nRainy Day Raga by Peter Walker\n\nMemphis by Sandy Bull\n\nWho Do You Love by Quicksilver Messenger Service\n\nJaan Uhelszki, Journalist, Creem, Jeckle\n\nI broke it down into old and new…\n\nForever Changes by Love\n\nAxis Bold As Love by Jimi Hendrix\n\nBuffalo Springfield Again by Buffalo Springfield\n\nSgt.

My fav psych band.\n\nMusic in a Doll’s House by Family\n\nFuture by The Seeds\n\nVanilla Fudge by Vanilla Fudge\n\nThe Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor by The 13th Floor Elevators\n\nOdessey and Oracle by The Zombies\n\nAxis: Bold as Love by The Jimi Hendrix Experience\n\nSF Sorrow by The Pretty Things\n\nThe Soft Machine by The Soft Machine\n\nPiper at The Gates of Dawn by Pink Floyd\n\nWell, I was wondering why I didn't put any of The Beatles albums on the list and realized that some of their best psychedelic stuff came out on the singles, which were non-LP songs. And also with Donovan, I only had these as singles, not the albums, so I was tripping to these at 45rpm. So here's a dozen psychedelic singles that I played the hell out of, to add to my favs.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nPaperback Writer/Rain 1966\n\nYellow Submarine/Eleanor Rigby 1966\n\nPenny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever 1967\n\nAll You Need Is Love/Baby, You're a Rich Man 1967\n\nHello, Goodbye/I Am the Walrus 1967\n\nLady Madonna/The Inner Light 1968\n\nDonovan\n\nSunshine Superman/ The Trip 1966\n\nMellow Yellow/ Sunny South Kensington 1966\n\nWear Your Love Like Heaven/Oh Gosh 1967\n\nAtlantis/I Love My Shirt 1968\n\nHurdy Gurdy Man / Teen Angel 1968\n\nIron Butterfly\n\nIn-A-Gadda-Da-Vida/Iron Butterfly Theme 1968\n\nCheryl Pawelski, Omnivore Recordings\n\nProbably more than 10, psychedelic by my own definition of course…\n\nFarewell Aldebaran by Judy Henske & Jerry Yester\n\nSecos & Molhados by Secos & Molhados\n\nThe Notorious Byrd Brothers by The Byrds\n\nMerryweather Post Pavilion by Animal Collective\n\nSwaddling Songs by Mellow Candle\n\nForever Changes by Love\n\nYoshimi Battles The Pink Robots by The Flaming Lips\n\nGod Bless The Red Krayola And All Who Sail With It by Red Krayola\n\nJoy Of A Toy by Kevin Ayers\n\nTheir Entire Catalog by The Spacemen 3\n\nNo Other by Gene Clark\n\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico by The Velvet Underground and Nico\n\nTago Mago & Ege Bamyasi by Can\n\nOs Mutantes by Os Mutantes\n\nAnd way too many more...\n\nBill Bentley, Writer, Producer, Texan\n\n1. 13th Floor Elevators/Psychedelic Sounds. Out of the central Texas hills came a sound so advanced, so wondrous, so downright psychedelic that it still seems like a miracle it happened at all. Higher states of conciousness were studied from every angle--from the world on fire to the glorious colors of hallucinations in a church--and then sung by a voice that knew the several levels of human knowledge. Leader Tommy Hall had seen the center of the universe and was committed to sharing it with others. Which he did in 1966.\n\n2. Red Krayola/Parable of Arable Land. Houston is a tough town, dubbed the Murder Capital of the World in 1967 when the Red Krayola trio made their recording debut. Released on the same label as the 13th Floor Elevators, this band saw the darker side of life and used it to take listeners on a wild ride up the ladder of knowledge. Feedback became elixir in their hands, and mental gyrations a way of life. Needless to say, the Red Krayola had a short run at divinity before an early explosion.\n\n3. 13th Floor Elevators/Easter Everywhere. The perfect psychedelic album that almost had a chance at changing the world before the Texas law enforcement dynasty put a knee on the band's life. There are enough revelations of eternal truths on the songs, though, that nothing can stop their march forward. 55 years later the three-eyed man who wrote many of these prophetic lyrics is still yo-yoing where he will: in a Tenderloin den in San Francisco where he lives in a time of its own.\n\n4. Grateful Dead/Anthem of the Sun. When their first album missed the bubbling bullseye, the Grateful Dead regrouped, double-downed on their LSD intake and went for the glory. These suite of songs surely found what they were looking for, and for the next near-thirty years the Dead saddled up the troops and left for the frontier sratosphere. The bus came by and all got on for the journey to never ever land. The musical inventions and celestial visions offered here will not be topped. Cowboy Neal lives.\n\n5. Country Joe & the Fish/Electric Music for the Mind and Body. Being from Berkeley in the 1960s was like being dared to soar in the Bay Area's lysergic galaxy. Which is what Country Joe & the Fish did: what had started in a political zeitgeist became a fast-fueled zoom into cosmic consciousness. Songs like \"Bass Strings\" and \"Grace\" proved that it's not where one lives but rather where one dreams. And no band ever had more Technicolor wanderings than this one.\n\n6. Moby Grape/Moby Grape. Roaring into the Haight-Ashbury maelstrom with vivid pride, Moby Grape bowed to no band. Instead they wrote undeniable rock anthems as three-minute jewels, blew apart listeners with a musical prowess still unequaled and then destroyed the quintet's career by having their debut album feature the drummer flipping off their audience on the front cover. No matter how undeniably amazing the band was, it was over before it started. Heartbreak in the City by the Bay.\n\n7. Quicksilver Messenger Service/Quicksilver Messenger Service. Guitar explorations were a San Francisco staple. And no one could explore like this band's John Cippolina. He took a tiny Gibson SG and turned it into a volcano-producing machine. Luckily the man had a band that could keep up with him. This debut album said it all, and even though they never quite reached the same height, it wasn't for lack of trying. Adding a returning lead singer on their third album took them down a different road, but one listen to their song \"Silver and Gold\" on this first release will permanently sear their mark on the brain forever.\n\n8. Jefferson Airplane/After Bathing at Baxter's. If anyone needs to hear how advanced the rock bands of the 1960s could be, this is the album to start with. It lives as an extended take on everything psychedelic music promised: extended songs, miniscule symphonies and flat-out craziness. Clearly fueld by Owsley's finest, the Jefferson Airplane met their match, which turned out to be themselves, and managed to prove their prowess for all time. No man is an island, as they sing, he's a peninsula. The riddle of life in a lyric.\n\n9. Alexander Spence/Oar. Moby Grape spearhead Alexander \"Skip\" Spence paid the price for freedom and was sentenced to incarceration in New York's Bellvue Hospital psych-ward in 1969. Literally. He ran the rooms there and when he was released rode a motorcyle to Nashville and recorded OAR in two days at the Columbia Records stduio. Then he left for the California sunshine and never really came back--to reality at least. These are songs created by someone who had seen inside the secret works that demonstrate the real freedom of the human mind. Caution is suggested.\n\n10. Grateful Dead/Aoxomoxoa. As the 1960s slashed its way to an end with the final burning of the bush at Altamont Speedway, the Grateful Dead had already recorded one of their true masterpiece albums with Aoxomoxoa. Not always a happy ride, the music twists and turns the human condition into one that promoses everything but warns of the pitfalls ahead. \"China Cat Sunflower\" rips open the brainpan only to make its way to the time-old question, \"What's Become of the Baby?\" In-between all those mental rollercoaster machinations lies a secret to the universe that is still being uncovered by the hallucinoginec warriors of the Modern Age. There won't be anymore so it's best to remember what they all gave us, and keep it close to the heart and mind. Forever.\n\nLSD or else...\n\nGeoffrey Weiss, Manager, A&R Vet, Problematic Record Collector\n\nList One (His favs change from day to day.

The track “The Island” is a fav.\n\nIn Search of the Lost Chord by The Moody Blues\n\nDays of Future Passed by The Moody Blues: I wore this record out and still hit it from time to time. A lot of inspiration came from this record, especially for the latest Spree record coming in 2023.\n\nIn the Court of the Crimson King by King Crimson: I know it’s more progressive but I still consider the residue psychedelia, and in my mind it’s far out.\n\nThe Psychedelic Sounds of The 13th Floor Elevators by The 13th Floor Elevators: Being from Texas, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention The 13th floor Elevators…\n\nMagical Mystery Tour by The Beatles\n\nHead by The Monkees: “The Porpoise Song” is a staple in the Spree’s repertoire, we also had the honor of playing the song with the Monkees in England at a festival Bellingham.\n\nOdessey and Oracle by The Zombies: A masterpiece\n\n….Hell, I consider easy listening to be psychedelic, with artists such as Percy Faith, Montavani, and Paul Weston to name a few, they tell stories with classical instrumentals that take trips that never leave the farm!

Hope you like this, though:\n\nTHE BEST RECORD TO ACTUALLY GOBBLE UP STRYCHINE-HEAVY ACID TO IN THE 1980s\n\nFLIPPER,Album Generic Flipper (Subterranean, 1982): Nothing takes a bad trip and flips it on its ass like this perfectly maniacal and beautifully nihilist dirge symphony. The urban myths surrounding the band—that Falconi was attempting to replicate PTSD-induced visions of bombs exploding with his guitar, and that the group had nearly perfected the “brown note” with the bass so be careful to not actually shit your pants when you see them live—gave them the aura of living trixter gods. No other band had that kind of power at the time, not Necros or the Buttholes, no one. And heavy-dosing to Flipper was the most fun way to run the gauntlet of your own mind. We all know how drugs make you so suggestible and stuff and it turns out that having “Nothingnothingnothingnothing” running through your brain was a good thing in the real world. It prepared you better than the flowers in the hair that had animated your elders, most of them former psychedelic warriors. I have a soft spot for “To rot beneath the earth!/ As we rot and live and breathe. No tears wasted no sorrow no pity/ No, no crying no loss!”\n\nSOMEHOW THE BEST PSYCHEDELIC RECORD IS ARGUABLY THE FIRST PSYCHEDELIC RECORD\n\n13TH FLOOR ELEVATORS, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators (International Artists, 1966): You can climb the mountain, but did you build it in the first place? Were you your own guide along the way or did you pay these other sherpas to carry all the shit up with you? And how the hell is it that this thing is so consistently amazing when the guy on the jug is making piddley-pooh noises up and down all the time? Where in hell is the first press I bought at a record show for $15 in 1983?\n\nI HAVE LIKE 28 YEARS CLEAN AND SOBER THESE DAYS BUT IF I DO DOSE AGAIN BEFORE I DIE WHAT WOULD I WANT THE SOUNDTRACK TO BE?\n\nMUSTAPHA SKINDRANI, Musique Classique Algérienne - Stikhbar (EM reissue as Istikhbars And Improvisations, 2012): An actual application of sounds which one would want to get lost inside of leads me to consider music that creates its own world. This is the principal application of the psychedelic experience by/through/with music. Fuck a microdose, I would macrodose, but make it mushrooms so I can come back after a few days, and not get another heart attack or anything like that. Sublime plinkety-plonkety, minimalist music with percussive elements would be ideal. Piano works by Julius Eastman, La Monte Young, Emahoy Tsegué-Mariam Guèbru, and Charlemagne Palestine would probably be the best—but this here mid 1960s recording by the Algerian pianist and composer Skindrani almost has as much silence as it does sound. Not that it’s a Morton Feldmanwork; it almost swings at moments. But it constantly forces you to listen due to subtle pauses. And it’s just gorgeous, too. I can’t think of a better accompaniment to an adventure to the center of the mind than these gentle improvisations which meld classical and Chabbi styles.\n\nTHE ONLY PSYCHEDELIC RECORD I MYSELF RELEASED, WHICH I LOVE SO MUCH\n\nFANTASTIC PALACE, Early Recordings/ Hello the Mellow Man (Audio Dregs, Social Music, 2013): Working on this with Eric Mast in Portland, we paired two very limited cassette releases of unexplainable instrumentals. It sounds like happy time in the Chrome universe (or, conversely, like dark psychedelic soundtrack jams). To me, it's always sounded like circus music meets the Faust/ Wümme aesthetic. It totally would have been on the NWW list if it had been issued earlier. Back in the early 1990s, my first failed record label was a collaboration with Shimmy Disc called See Eye. We only released a few things; the very best was the Fantastic Palace side of the Chinny Chin Chin record. There was never any information released then as to who made these hypnotic four-track home recordings, but with the reissue we could finally reveal that it was all the work of noted (and highly psychedelic) visual artist Alexander Ross.\n\nGeoffrey Weiss, Product Manager for The Boredoms\n\nList Three (Because his favs change from day to day)\n\nStudio by Tages\n\nJuly by July\n\nOs Mutantes by Os Mutantes\n\nExtradition by Hush\n\nThe Plastic Cloud by The Plastic Cloud\n\nPerfect Prescription by Spacemen 3\n\nSpace Mantra by F/I\n\nIn Search of Space by Hawkwind\n\nMonster Movie by Can\n\nOn The Shore by Trees\n\nScary Heard, Enthusiast\n\nHere’s a list of records from my hometown (Ed note: if your town is the world):\n\nCatalyse by Ame Son\n\nIlluminations by Buffy Sainte-Marie\n\nSoon Over Babaluma by Can\n\nEdge of Time by Dom\n\nYpsilon in Malaysian Pale by Edgar Froese\n\nForever is a Dream by Food\n\nKanguru by Guru Guru\n\nSidewalks Talking by Hollins and Starr\n\nA Game For All Who Know by Ithaca\n\nSho Is Funky Down Here by James Brown"
