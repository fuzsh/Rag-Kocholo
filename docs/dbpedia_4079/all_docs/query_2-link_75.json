        "text": "True Love, Rock’n’roll & Penny Keno: Dead Moon Talk:\n\nKim Cooper And Doug Miller Listen\n\nI’m ashamed to admit that until recently I was not hep to the glory that is Dead Moon. Oh, sure, I knew ‘You Must Be A Witch,’ the blistering punk 45 by Fred Cole’s sixties band The Lollipop Shoppe ‘ but who would equate a drippy-psych name like that with the icy-tuff symbolism of Dead Moon? As it turns out, L.S. was a name dreamed up by their management ‘ the band was really called The Weeds!\n\nFred & Toody Cole are one of the great rock and roll couples, both for the uncompromising music they’ve made together, as The Rats and (since 1988) Dead Moon, and for the strength of their personal and creative bond. Having the chance to hear some of their stories before a show at Spaceland in late May was a hoot and an inspiration. They have a new album, Destination X, and it’s great, but for an introduction I’d suggest you pick up Hard Wired in Ljubljana. They are almost uncannily good live, as well as being the nicest folks you could hope to meet. ‘ The Editrix\n\nDOUG: …And this is my 58th roommate, Mike. Mr. Cole and Mrs. Cole.\n\nTOODY: Hi.\n\nMIKE: Hello Mr. Cole and Mrs. Cole, pleased to meet you.\n\nTOODY: [chortling] What respect! I’m impressed.\n\nKIM: Oh, we’re very well-mannered, if nothing else. Fred, I gotta ask you about Deep Soul Cole ‘ is that true?!\n\nFRED: Oh, god!\n\nTOODY: [Cackling] Of course it’s true! We don’t create these rumors for nothing.\n\nKIM: How old were you?\n\nFRED: I was fifteen. It was Larry Williams, who played guitar on that, which was amazing. I played bass on record, and in the band it was me, a white singer doing a James Brown trip, jumping all over the place, with four kids my age who were all black.\n\nKIM: Where did you live?\n\nFRED: Las Vegas. Our manager was running all the R & B acts coming through Vegas, so we played with nothing except black acts.\n\nDOUG: Did you play the Strip?\n\nFRED: Nah, the Convention Center, basically. We were the opening slot for a lot of these different soul bands that came through.\n\nKIM: Had you gotten together with these kids on your own, or were you put with them?\n\nFRED: Mike Tell, who was the manager, just threw this band together.\n\nKIM: How long did you play with those guys?\n\nFRED: About four to six months.\n\nDOUG: Were you going to high school, or were you a ‘drop out’?\n\nFRED: At that point I was in the Sophomore year.\n\nDOUG: Anyone else have a band at your high school?\n\nFRED: Oh yeah!\n\nTOODY: Everyone played in a band ‘ or tried to play, anyway.\n\nFRED: I was going to Western High School, but the following year I wouldn’t go back. My hair was way over my ears, and I had to cut my hair or get a G.E.D., so I got my extra credit.\n\nKIM: Was this around 1965?\n\nTOODY: Earlier than that, ‘cause I graduated in ‘66.\n\nKIM: How did your folks happen to be in Las Vegas?\n\nFRED: My mom got a job (chuckles) at Mercury Test Site, in atomic energy, for the bomb testing. She was a Fecal Tester! (everyone cracks up) Yeah, really, she picked up all the animal shit out there and tested it in the lab!\n\nKIM: From the animals that were running around on the desert?\n\nFRED: Yeah, she’d go out there in this radioactive suit and pick up shit all day long!\n\nTOODY: And then work in the lab. They got paid big-time money!\n\nKIM: Did she have to go to school for that?\n\nTOODY: Nah, I think it was on-the-job training.\n\nKIM: Fred, your band appeared in one of those motorcycle movies.\n\nFRED: The Lollipop Shoppe, yeah. That was a crazy thing. Our bit was filmed over two weeks. We got put up in the Bakersfield Hotel’\n\nKIM: They filmed it in Bakersfield?!\n\nFRED: Yeah. They put us in the hotel and said we had room service.\n\nTOODY: Which was a bad thing to say to five 17, 18-year-old guys! (laughter)\n\nFRED: When it finally got done the film company wanted to sue us, actually. We had a $1300 bar tab, alone!\n\nTOODY: That was hard to do in the sixties!\n\nFRED: In the sixties drinks were a buck! They figured we had thirteen hundred margaritas.\n\nKIM: Lessee, there were five of you… were you tipping or something?\n\nFRED: Not really. We were just sloshed all the time.\n\nTOODY: They were ordering shrimp cocktails!\n\nDOUG: What time did you have to show up on the set?\n\nFRED: Well, they’d just bring us out there on the truck every day, and then we’d hang out for about four hours. Then if they decided to film us that day, they would. And then finally the budget was so bad that they refused to sign a deal over to the Actor’s Guild, because I was being filmed singing. So they cut me’\n\nTOODY: It would have been a ‘speaking role.’\n\nFRED: So you see the band, and my tambourine’\n\nTOODY: You can hear him, but if they showed his face on screen they would have had to pay him as an actor. Two weeks, and they have thirty seconds in the film, and you never see Fred. It’s just ridiculous. There were two songs on the soundtrack album.\n\nKIM: What was the name of the movie?\n\nFRED/*TOODY:* (in bombastic unison) Angels from Hell! (hysterics)\n\nDOUG: Tombstone should re-release the soundtrack.\n\nFRED: Hans at Music Maniac wants to do a Lollipop Shoppe album, and I didn’t want to just reissue The Lollipop Shoppe, so I’m doing a bunch of stuff with different tracks and things, and I’m re-issuing it as The Weeds/ Lollipop Shoppe. I don’t know what I’m gonna do yet, but I’ve got old photos of The Weeds’\n\nTOODY: The way the band really looked before Hollywood got hold of ‘em!\n\nKIM: You were The Weeds before you were The Lollipop Shoppe?\n\nFRED: Same band.\n\nTOODY: They went to this management company and he said, ‘Okay, we’re gonna go for the teeny market, so clean your act up! He took ‘em all in, got ‘em haircuts, little multicolored turtlenecks.\n\nKIM: And is it ‘shop’ or ‘shop-E’?\n\nTOODY: It’s ‘shop.’ The English spelling!\n\nFRED: The manager [Lord Tim Hudson] was a disk jockey here in L.A. at the time, and he was the guy who was appropriately the vulture in The Jungle Book. Remember the two vultures, the one with the English accent? That’s him! I didn’t see dime one from that goddamn thing! (laughter) We were in England about four years ago, and someone goes ‘Is Lord Tim around here?’ ‘Oh yeah, he’s managing wrestlers now!’ Well, that’s gonna give him some protection, because there’s about twenty people out there who just wanna kill him!\n\nTOODY: If you can’t get ‘em young and stupid, get ‘em big and stupid.\n\nKIM: You guys had your own record label in the early seventies, right?\n\nTOODY: We had two different record labels, and we named them after our music stores both times. The early punk stuff we did on Whizeagle Records ‘ we had a store called Captain Whizeagle’s at the time.\n\nKIM: Where’s that name come from?\n\nTOODY: It’s something Fred made up. He wrote a story for the kids about Captain Whizeagle’\n\nFRED: And the Snake Troopers! (laughter)\n\nTOODY: He likes making up names. And later, after we started Dead Moon, we had Tombstone Records. ‘88 was the first release.\n\nKIM: Have you always distributed them yourself?\n\nTOODY: Early on we did. We sold some through Cargo, Get Hip and Dionysus and a lot of the smaller mail order distribution networks. Get Hip became the biggest, and I dealt with those guys the most. Now everything’s going through Mordam, cause we’re doing stuff on eMpTy, which has much better distribution than we ever had.\n\nKIM: Meghan from eMpTy tells me that you’re building a ghost town.\n\nTOODY: Well hopefully it won’t be a ghost town! We’re building it to lease it out as retail space.\n\nFRED: It’s called Tombstone Territory.\n\nKIM: Cool!\n\nTOODY: We did an addition to the store at first, in a western style with the false-front and the big wide cedar siding. Same with the new building, it’s like some country-western bordello. It’s got porches around it, staircases, the whole nine yards. And it’s turning out absolutely immense, I had no idea it was really gonna be this big till we started it. Cause you’re looking at prints on paper, it’s hard to get an idea of dimension. (laughs)\n\nDOUG: Will there be a saloon?\n\nFRED: Eventually, that’s the next plan.\n\nTOODY: The Boot Hill Saloon. We’ve got about two acres to work with, so we still got some space left if we can get up the energy and the capital.\n\nFRED: We’re doing all the building ourselves. We’re almost done with the framing, and that’s taken us a year. Toody does the 8D nails, I do the 16D.\n\nKIM: That’s so cool. You got wooden sidewalks?\n\nTOODY: Yeah, it’s got a wooden porch all the way around.\n\nDOUG: I wanna see you in a toolbelt, Toody.\n\nTOODY: (laughing) Well, my nail pouch broke.\n\nDOUG: Do you guys sell used musical equipment?\n\nTOODY: New and used both.\n\nDOUG: When people bring in guitars to sell, isn’t it tempting to keep them for your personal collection?\n\nTOODY: Every once in a while, but not much comes through. Years ago, when we used to have Whizeagle’s downtown, that stuff was all over the place. Unfortunately, because of the economy in Oregon, everything sold for quite a bit less and we had shitloads of dealers come up from California to buy twelve pieces at a pop ‘ and no sales tax on top of that! So a lot of the stuff from the Portland area ended up down here in California, or in Japan. It’s rare now that we see any ‘vintage gear.’ We’ve got a few things stashed. We love all the stuff that’s kinda worthless, real funky old Japanese stuff’\n\nFRED: Vegamatic control switches, lots of chrome, action like a dog. (laughter) You gotta play with a pair of pliers to keep the strings down.\n\nKIM: You guys were just down in New Zealand and Australia?\n\nTOODY: Yep. About a week ago now.\n\nKIM: Have any really wacky things happened on this tour so far?\n\nFRED: Nothing except missing all the planes. We got into San Francisco and they had all of our gear but our kick drum. We had to come back the next day and get it.\n\nTOODY: Luckily we had a day before we had to play. But everything went pretty smooth.\n\nFRED: (laughing) Except customs wouldn’t let us back into New Zealand from Australia! We had to get a special visa for them to process us again.\n\nKIM: You were going back to play some more?\n\nFRED: We played one more show.\n\nTOODY: You have to send your passports to the embassy, down here in L.A., and they do a work permit. They asked me if a single entry would be fine, and I go ‘Oh yeah, we’re just doing one entry from the states. I thought New Zealand and Australia are both Commonwealth countries, that can’t be a problem, right?\n\nKIM: It’s just one country!\n\nTOODY: Well, to us it is, but to them, it’s no-no-no-no-no! So we just got stuck waiting for about half an hour, they extended it, no big deal.\n\nFRED: The first tour was a nightmare, because we didn’t know it was winter over there! It was the middle of summer here. They called us and said, ‘You guys have got to bring all your clothes, because it’s literally snowing here.’\n\nTOODY: We were thinking ‘New Zealand, it’s gotta be tropical!’\n\nFRED: ‘Bring everything you got that’s warm, ‘cause you’re gonna freeze your asses off!’ They’re clear down by the South Pole. We had the vision when we first went over there that it was up by the Fiji Islands, that it was nice. Man! So we packed everything ‘ we wore everything! We put all of our clothes in the drums, just to try and get all our weight in on the plane.\n\nDOUG: You brought drums overseas?\n\nTOODY: We take everything; that’s our luggage.\n\nFRED: We flew from Seattle down to L.A. We had long coats on, sweaters.\n\nTOODY: (in hysterics) It was almost a hundred degrees!\n\nFRED: We’re sweating bullets, and we can’t take the shit off ‘cause we got nowhere to put it! We’re carrying guitars. And we get to L.A. Airport, everyone’s in shorts. We come walking in in these coats, I got my cowboy hat, sweaters on ‘ we are all just wet with sweat.\n\nTOODY: And we’re getting looks’\n\nFRED: ‘What planet did these assholes just come from?!’ Then we had the flight from hell: Seattle to L.A., L.A. to Hawaii, Hawaii to Fiji, Fiji to Auckland.\n\nTOODY: It’s like being on a milk run.\n\nFRED: Twenty-six, twenty-seven hours’\n\nKIM: And you never took your clothes off?\n\nFRED: We couldn’t!\n\nTOODY: How’re you gonna take your clothes off?\n\nKIM: How could you not?\n\nTOODY: Oh, you can take your clothes off and stuff ‘em in the overheads, but then you’re stuck carrying all this crap around!\n\nFRED: By the time we got there we’d been sweating so bad, we smelled like we had been on the road for weeks! We were mildewed! And we came off the plane and it was snowing in Auckland, and we thanked god we had those clothes! Cold as hell.\n\nTOODY: Freezing the whole time. This one place we played on the south island, in Christchurch, the bar owned a backpackers’ hotel. They put us in the section they had been remodeling ‘ it wasn’t finished! All the other rooms were full."
