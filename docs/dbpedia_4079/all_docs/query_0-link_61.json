        "text": "11. “8:05” by Moby Grape\n\nMoby Grape got its name as the punch line of the joke, “What’s big and purple and lives in the ocean?” “8:05” was written by guitarist Jerry Miller and drummer Don Stevenson. It was a highlight of their self-titled 1967 debut album. “I wrote most of ‘8:05’ when I going across the Golden Gate Bridge,” Miller told Rock Cellar.\n\n“I asked the toll guy what time it was and he said, ‘8:05.’ So halfway across the bridge I sang, ‘8:05, I think I’ll drive off this bridge.’ And I said, ‘It’s got a nice little melody so I think I’ll keep the melody and forget about the driving off the bridge.’”\n\n“We got a guitar and it just turned into kind of a love song,” added Stevenson. “Jerry and I sing harmony on that song. That’s the Everly Brothers touch, you know?”"
