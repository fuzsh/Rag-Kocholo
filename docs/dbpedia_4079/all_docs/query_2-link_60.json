(SONG) SEEING (RATING) ***** (COMMENTS) Definitely one of the great American groups! As a full-time musician here in Nashville, I can tell you that I run into players all the time who remember the Grape with great love and respect! I never saw the Grape live, but did manage to see the Rhythm Dukes in '70 at a all-day music festival at Urbana Junior High School in Champaign/Urbana, Illinois. They were great, and Jerry Miller was definitely SMOKIN'. I hope the reunited Grape make it to Nashville sometime. Best of luck in the fight against M. Katz!

(RATING) ***** (COMMENTS) The first time I saw Moby Grape on TV. was in Holland in the sixties. They performed at some lousy Tv show. And it was seen they were in a very bad temper. I'll never forget that performance, I thought it was impressive. In 1970 I bought my first Moby Grape album, when I was at Art-school in Stockholm., and I became a fan for life. I have all the albums, and some solo albums of Bob Mosley. Everything was/is very hard to get, in regular music stores overhere. I recenttly have internet, and Your site is one of the first I looked for. I want my collection completed. Since 1970, when I listen to music, apart from other favourites, I always listen to The Grape. Especially when I'm working in my studio(I am a visual artist) Your music is very valuable for me. And I know many friends in Holland, who are also fans for more than 30 years. with friendly regards, Herman van den Boom Fri, 9 Oct 1998 05:02:52 (NAME) Edwin Hagendoorn (EMAIL) ehagendo@best-dep.minjus.nl (LOCATION) The Hague, Netherlands (SONG) Omaha (MEMBER) Peter Lewis (RATING) **** (COMMENTS) This is really a beautiful site, and Moby Grape it.

Would love to see them in a bar type of setting where everybody could get a little loose. Did I read right that the upcoming New York tickets are $15? That's a hell of a deal! I think they'd do well down here and $15 is a steal to see these legends. I have the Oar LP, but had no idea it was out on CD. I'm going to order 2 copies and give one to WMNF the local community radio station. Best regards to all you guys. Wed, 7 Oct 1998 19:05:55 (NAME) Gregory B.

For once, three guitars that worked and the best harmonies since the Byrds! Let me know if you play in the NYC area again, separately or ( hopefully ) together.

So I just did a search for \"moby grape\" and found your excellent site. Didn't know the band was having the legal problems, I sure hope that comes out favorably. Is there any connection between the legal difficulties of Moby Grape and CCR? Keep up the great site I'd love to hear that Moby Grape is coming to play in Phoenix.

San Fran music was so new then and fresh (Airplane, Butterfly, etc), loved it all. I would like to purchase cassette or even Lp of Moby Grape again. Thanks for the nostalgic joggin'.

(MEMBER) Bob Mosley (RATING) ***** (COMMENTS) GREAT SITE, GREAT BAND! A couple years ago, in my conversion to CD heyday, I actually allowed myself to let go of '69, 20 Granite Creek and Truly Fine Citizen. Earlier this year, Whilst perusing one of the local used vinyl shops, what did I find but these fine Grape albums with my signature on them (an old habit of mine to try to prevent theft back in my wild and reckless youth) I convinced the shop owner to trade them to me for taped versions of the first 2 albums which I had the sanity to keep. Unfortunately, the poster from my 1st album disappeared eons ago, but the cover is the original c/w finger. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jerry playing guitar along with Jay Geils on the Bluestime CD. And was really looking forward to their coming to town a year or so ago, unfortunately all the dates in the local area were cancelled.

I picked up a copy on CD and it has the original cover art (\"finger\") on it. The only problem with it is it was recorded at a time when about 35 minutes was all you could cram on two sides of wax. If you guys had recorded that album with todays technology, it would have to be considered in the top three all time rock-n-roll recordings.

I just got back from a reunion we had yesterday of my cohorts from the sixties (1968 to be specific) who drifted in and out of a house at 1817 1/2 Delaware St. in Berkeley, and our various friends of the time. I was looking for some examples of psychedelic posters of the era, so that I can use our group photo from the reunion as well as a montage of photos from that time to make up a commemorative poster to send on to the people who showed up. It was neat to find the repository of guitar tab of all the songs!

Really, the main reason that I surfed on over here was that I used to receive \"Truly Fine Citizen\" from Scott Sather (via email) and now I've noticed that it's missing. I miss it. Thanks. I'd reiterate my story of how I turned on to the Grape, but I'm sure that's already in your guest book from last time. Thanks again. Oh, I forgot... I finally had the money recently to acquire a copy of \"Vintage Grape,\" but now I can't find a copy. Any advice where to get it cheap (not import)? Thanks.

We imported a lot of USA LP's and were known as the ony West Coast type band in the UK. We covered Love, buffalo springfield, Byrds ets. Still got the original LP. Graet Stuff.

(MEMBER) Skip Spence (RATING) ***** (COMMENTS) Being a Grape fan is sometimes frustrating, cause even in the sixties there was usually only a small circle of people who knew AND appreciated THE record (the first album, that is). Having played it for over 30 years now, I'm still baffled by the richness and variety of the singing, playing and melodies and lyrics of the songs. \"Omaha\" has always been a big favourite (I still owe the original Dutch single release with photo sleeve) it also was the very first Moby Grape song I ever heard. Thanks guys for having made the greatest record ever.

Can't believe I found it and it has tons of great info I always wanted to know! The 1st Moby Grape album has ALWAYS been one of my favorites. This album and the 1st Byrds album are like part of my \"fiber\"! I play them frequently and never tire of the songs. I'm 47 and have been playing music myself for over 30 years currently playing bass for \"The Satellites\", who specialize in 60's music - (American & British Invasion). I love Bob Mosley's bass work and the great harmony on that 1st album. I totally agree that Moby Grape were UNBELIEVABLE musicians and their songs and licks still blow me away, even after 30 years! Please let me know of any future concerts near Baltimore. Thanks.

So scratch the suggestion in my recent email. One thing I would say is that some of the color combinations in the web page make it a little difficult to read some of the stuff. For instance, the white type on the 'wiggly' purple on the Guest Book page. Might be better in simple black. Also the 'used' link color of red kind of gets lost in the purple too. One solution might be a more finely detailed and less intrusive background pattern. Of course it's gotta have that goofy late-60s free-love psychedelic look to it! (Seriously.) Cheers, Henry J. B.

Even now, at 47, I'd love to know just who played what on the first album. I remember seeing the Grape on the \"Mike Douglas Show\", playing LIVE, with the crappiest sound ever broadcast over national TV!

If anyone can help me with any information, anecdotes, tips of unheard of material etc... I'd be really grateful. Also, a Grape interview would be a real winner! I've got to submit a proposal to the station management in a week or two and hope to gather as much support as possible before then. If there's anything I can help anyone out with I would be MORE THAN willing :) It really is good to see things going so strong.

I was a musician in the 60's and 70's and a major fan of the Grape. Don and his wife Janice have been here in Sedona on vacation for the past week and have had dinner with my family and me three of the last five nights. Last night my son and his guitar teacher (Bill Barns) and Don and I jammed for about three hours, playing old R&B songs, some Grape tunes, and some of Don's new material. I'm delighted to report that Don is married to a terrific woman, is doing well in business and is healthy and happy. Don is as sweet and gentle a man as I have had the pleasure to have known. He still stays in touch with the Grape members as much as possible. Jerry Miller flew up to Vancouver last year to be best man at Don's wedding. He tells me that Skippy and Bob are doing much better these days and that Peter is in fine voice and good health. Peace to you all.

I host a radio show on KPFA in Berkeley, Sunday evenings from 11:00 pm to 1:00 am and would love to have members of the band in for an interview and music (perhaps evena little live acoustic music?) Also, I am on the faculty at SFSU and teach a rock history class. Perhaps one of the original band members would like to come and talk to my students one day. Unfortunately, we can only offer a very modest honorarium (about $75, perhaps a little more), but it might be fun and might also be a way to draw for any upcoming concert. Let me hear from you.

Nice guest page, too! Reading some titles still gives me gooseflesh. I still have the first five on vinyl, the first album twice - my very first copy became too scratchy. I once placed an ad Hitweek saying \"Jerry Miller is the best guitar player in the world\" - it was a long time ago, but the band can still bring tears to my eyes. And I still don't know all the words to the songs, especially *oar* is a tough one... \"her hair hanging northwards, as she travels south...\" \"dawn to dusk a lifetime...\" I know it's only rock'n'roll, but I love it.

I was hooked!!! I wanted to run away to SF but my parents wouldn't let me. I believe that my mother bought the LP as either a birthday gift or Christmas present. I remember how great the music and lyrics sounded but there was no poster in the Canadian pressings! Today I searched into my vast record collection dusted off the old MG vinyls (4) and I tried to relive the glorious golden past of the sixties. MG welcome back to the nineties!!! P.S. do you have any of those original MB 1st LP posters left? I would like to buy one. Lastly do you remember the underground magazine called 'Paperbag' that was published in the late sixties. Where can I find a copy? Please advise. Sat, 24 Jan 1998 10:11:19 (NAME) John Pierce (EMAIL) jp@ns.gemlink.com (LOCATION) Culpeper,Va. (SONG) Gypsy Wedding (MEMBER) Bob Mosley (RATING) ***** (COMMENTS) the grape represented everything that was uplifting, hopeful and chaotic about growing up in the sixties. the thing that separated them from the rest of the hippie pack was their sophisticated musical range. Here's a test: Listen to some of the recorded output of most of the other san francisco based groups of the time next to any grape song. no comparison. the grape stuff still sounds fresh to me. alas, talent of that magnitude comes with a cost, and it was inevitable that the band would implode. i love the grape and will always have a special place in my heart for their music and that time. john pierce Sat, 24 Jan 1998 07:59:27 (NAME) mark bjorke (EMAIL) pinfold@ix.netcom.com (LOCATION) annapolis, md (SONG) first album, every track.

There is so little variety and every one trying to follow a guided path to success in the industry. People lose sight of their creative nature for the possibility for financial gain.

Have since built a decent collection of vinyl and now CD's. Always knew Moby Grape was cool but could never find their albums. When I found Vintage, I got into the right frame of mind and listened to these songs I had never heard before. I was absolutely blown away! The best rock music came out of Bay Area in '65-69, esp '67. Although a loyal Deadhead, I gotta say Moby Grape is even better than the Dead! Thanks, Scott, for bringing this page to the world.

Played with a band through high school and tried to play any Grape song we could. I took my album with me to Viet Nam and played it every chance I could. Many of my navy buddies became \"Grape Fans\" back then. On my return to the real world in 1973 some of my belongings were lost in-transit as you have already figured out my treasured Grape album was gone forever. I was lucky enough to see them live on three occasions and nobody can ever steal that memory. Thanks for listening and Thanks to Moby Grape for all the great music.

I bought WOW! based solely on the cover (but that's the way it was in the 60's, you know?) and loved it. Believe it or not, I never heard the debut album till the 80's (I'm slow, I suppose). I wore my vinyl copy of WOW! to nothing. One day I thought of it again and went searching a local small CD store when the silver discs were just beginning to appear. Lo and behold, there was a European 2-CD import but the $40 price tag stopped me (I didn't' have as much disposable cash, even then) Now I thoroughly regret not hocking my life away and buying it. I'm very disappointed that the San Francisco Sound disc is truncated. If you know of a way to find the 2 disc import, PLEASE let me know. Thanks again. This place is fun.
