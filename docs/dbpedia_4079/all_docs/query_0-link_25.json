        "text": "Would you pay $134 for a NM copy of Moby Grape S/T mono, finger cover, with poster?\n\nWould you consider that a stupidly high price to pay, or a bargain (assuming the album IS as described)?\n\nWell, I just paid that much for one. I've been a Grape fan since 1967, but I've never had a mono copy of the album. And then this popped up at ebay:\n\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dl...MEBI:IT&viewitem=&item=150124523028&rd=1&rd=1\n\nI don't normally have that much money to spend on such items, but I've been lusting after one of these for years, but I've been waiting until a high quality copy turned up.\n\nI'm quite willing to take a public flogging if I spent too much, and I'll even admit that had the bidding gone higher, much higher, I was ready to spend a lot more. But I have to admit, I feel like I got a relative bargain, again if the condition is as advertised.\n\nNow, here's a question (and if it's inappropriate according to the forum rules, would the resident Gort notify me by PM and I'll edit this last paragraph out?): is there anyone out there with a high quality turntable and other assorted high end playback equipment who is willing to do a first-rate needledrop to CDR for me?\n\nI've owned various (vinyl) stereo reissues of this over the years. I have the Columbia Legacy two-CD set from the early nineties back in the US in storage, and I have an original NM mono vinyl copy here with me in Japan. To my ears, the original mono vinyl is by far the best the debut LP has ever sounded, buried guitar parts notwithstanding. The vocal midrange is right, airy, you can hear the bass, the overall impact is crisp and clear without the overtinniness you get with reissued stereo (digital or analog). I haven't heard the original Columbia stereo in a very long time, though, so I don't know how that sounds.\n\nI think if it's in the condition advertised you will be quite happy, even if you had to pay a premium. Who knows when or if the mono mix will be reissued, and who knows how it will turn out if it is. A NM mono vinyl copy of this phenomenal LP is an object of desire for sure. IMO it can only appreciate in value...not that I'd EVER sell mine.\n\nDale\n\nTell me about it! I worked at an FM underground radio station in 1972 that hadn't gone stereo yet. The turntables had stereo cartridges, IIRC, but the output was combined to mono.\n\nOn many of this album's tracks, the vocals simply disappeared! These things weren't as well-understood in those days...or at least, not by the station's chief engineer. I have a distinct memory of him reversing the leads on the cartridge and fiddling about in all kinds of different ways to try to make this album work...all in vain!"
