        "text": "This is a great topic, but what makes it tough is who would know for sure except the engineer... and the really good engineers would probably never tell. When I worked in a studio I saw all kinds of stuff go on... the band recording and everyone glad handing and telling the guys good job and they leave and other guys came in and recut parts to get them right...\n\nEven with the Beatles there are a zillion accounts of who played drums or guitar solos.... even for a hack like me when I've recorded stuff with friends and acquaintances.... after every one leaves and I'm working on the mix or editing... I always end up 'fixing' stuff... I've found it easier to say nothing when everyone hears it back... and usually everyone says 'wow, mixing and eq'ing sure sweetened it up!' uh, yeah....\n\nlots of egos, drugs, poor documentation etc involved to ever really know...\n\nSome stuff you can just hear and know it is THAT player... other stuff, not so much. Fun to do though!\n\nActually, it was only the first single \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and the B-side \"I Knew I'd Want You\" that had the Wrecking Crew playing the backing track. The Byrds played on the other songs on the album.\n\nAnd they did occasionally use supplemental musicians on their records, Clarence White most prominently (before he actually joined the band); Red Rhodes, Jay Dee Maness and Sneaky Pete Kleinow on steel; Hugh Masakela on trumpet on \"So You Want To Be A Rock'n'Roll Star\"; Jim Gordon on drums on a song or two after Michael Clark left the band...\n\nCheers, Tim (major Byrds fan!)\n\nHey Tim. me too, major Byrds fan. I have always considered Clarence White to be a Byrd, even though that's probably not technically correct. To this day McGuinn speaks longingly about how good Clarence was. There once was a time when those five guys had hold of something really special. It slipped away.\n\nHey Tim. me too, major Byrds fan. I have always considered Clarence White to be a Byrd, even though that's probably not technically correct. To this day McGuinn speaks longingly about how good Clarence was. There once was a time when those five guys had hold of something really special. It slipped away.\n\nYeah, Crosby gets mighty nostalgic about the Byrds, too. He said as much to our fellow TDPRIer Paul Honeycutt once, when Paul mentioned that he's run sound for McGuinn's local performances. I expect Paul will correct me if I get it wrong, but it was something like \"Next time you see him, tell him I want to play with him again!\"\n\nHillman has likewise said his time with the Byrds was pretty special.\n\nLightning in a bottle.\n\nCheers, Tim\n\nI've heard various stories about the Monkees involvement in their albums, as least as far as playing instruments.\n\nOn \"Headquarters,\" the Monkees play everything, save for occasional bass by producer Chip Douglas and French horn and and cello on \"Shades of Gray.\" After that, they decided is was too big a pain (lots of retakes and editing), and thereafter used a mix of Monkees and session men.\n\nEarlier, as mentioned before, Nesmith played the fuzz box lead on \"Pleasant Valley Sunday.\"\n\nEven with the Beatles there are a zillion accounts of who played drums or guitar solos.... even for a hack like me when I've recorded stuff with friends and acquaintances.... after every one leaves and I'm working on the mix or editing... I always end up 'fixing' stuff...\n\nI know that one. I have some friends whom I consider to be much players than I, but when it comes down to recording they can't be coaxed to play cleanly, concisely or consistently on the beat, and they don't have the anal retentive will to get it right.\n\nWho would have thought it would come to this? Now that the Wrecking Crew is becoming more widely known--and very, very deservedly--this leaves me wondering who actually played on their own records? I've recently read that the many did, in fact, play all the the instruments on their own records (discounting strings and special instrument parts). The ones that come to mind are the Lovin Spoonful and Herman's Hermits. But did Zal Yanovsky really play the lead on Nashville Cats? What other bands did or didn't play their own instruments? Paul Revere and the Raiders? Hollies?\n\nI actually doubt that Herman's Hermits played a single note on any of their records (that's what I've always \"known\" anyway ).\n\nThe Lovin' Spoonful certainly did, but I can't guarantee that it's Zal on \"Nashville Cats\" though, but I believe it is.\n\nI've also read that the Wrecking Crew played on many Paul Revere & the Raiders records.\n\nThe Hollies were known for their ability in the recording studio, and \"Bus Stop\" was recorded in one take. They may of course still have used session musicians for certain things.\n\nAll of this is information that I've gathered through the years, and I can't guarantee any of it ...\n\nsmitty54017 said:\n\nI've heard various stories about the Monkees involvement in their albums, as least as far as playing instruments.\n\nThe Wrecking Crew at least played all the instruments on their first album \"The Monkees\" (1966).\n\nTwo New Jersey bands from the 60's who mostly played their own instruments in the recording studio were The Young Rascals and The 4 Seasons.\n\nThe Young Rascals actually had no bass player, and organ player Felix Cavaliere played bass on the organ pedals. (They were a fantastic live band!)\n\nOn most of their records however, Chuck Rainy played bass and they often used session players for additional instruments (horns etc.)\n\nThe 4 Seasons had played under different names and line-ups since the early 50's and they were very accomplished instrumentalists and singers when they had their big break-through with \"Sherry\" in 1962. They had no regular drummer however, and used two road drummers (Ron Roach and Joey Cass).\n\nIn the studio they used Buddy Saltzman on drums, in addition to some top session players including guitarists Al Gorgoni and Vinni Bell.\n\nNo matter how good you are, it's impossibel to play all the instruments on a recording with big arrangements if the band consists of 3 players plus a lead singer ..."
