        "text": "The Los Angeles based Hardwater was a quartet of two guitars, bass and drums, who released just one album of psychedelic pop in 1968. Perhaps this was a case of the wrong band at the wrong time. Even though this was released on a major label (Columbia), it quickly disappeared into obscurity, and that is a genuine shame. The 10 tracks on the album contain some of the best psych pop of the era, yet few know them by the name Hardwater. This is ironic as they were once one of the more popular surf rock bands of the decade: The Astronauts.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1967, The Astronauts produced nine albums of surf rock, some instrumental and some with vocals. They also made appearances in at least four movies, such as Wild on the Beach. One such performance comes from Surf Party, and one of their more creative pieces, Firewater. Rich Fifield is the one to the left of the drummer who has the sweater on when the camera is facing him and off when the camera is behind the band.\n\nAs popular music was getting more creative, thanks in large part to the psychedelic bands on the west coast, The Astronauts relocated from their home in Boulder, Colorado to Los Angeles. Having already recorded several songs by Boyce and Hart, the band tried out for The Monkees, but were unable to pursue that opportunity when RCA wouldn’t let them out of their contract.\n\nThey recorded a single under the name Sunshine Ward, but when guitarist Mark Bretz left, they changed their name again, this time to Hardwater. Now a quartet of Rich Fifield (guitar, vocals), Pedro Wyant (guitar), Rob McClerren (bass) and Tony Murillo (drums), they were soon signed to CBS Records. David Axelrod (Lou Rawls, Canonball Adderley and The Electric Prunes) produced their sole record, squeezing every bit of West Coast psych out of them. The result is a brilliant piece of psych pop, with more than enough to thrill a fan of Moby Grape, The Electric Prunes or even Buffalo Springfield.\n\nThe opening track is a long two part medley and firmly establishes them as Buffalo Springfield influenced West Coast psych, with layered vocal harmonies, some killer fuzz guitar leads, and a twangy rhythm guitar.\n\nMy favorite track is the short Moby Grape-ish City Sidewalks, their version of California Dreaming. In this case, it is something of the exact opposite as Rich Fifield laments being away from the wide open area and fresh air of Colorado. As the choruses repeat and get more desperate, I almost want to pick up the phone and send him an airplane ticket. Fifield’s voice is particular effective here as are the layers of harmony in the chorus.\n\nOne final sample, to give you some notion of their diversity, is the long extended Sanctuary. This is where they show off their Electric Prunes influences, perhaps aided by David Axelrod’s production. This one nicely showcases Pedro Wyant’s guitar work in the long free jam middle section.\n\nListening to this album, it is hard to understand how it could have fallen into such obscurity. Timing is everything, and that appeared to work against Hardwater. Delays in getting the album released, lack of a label sponsored tour and more attention being spent on other new signings (The Band and Steve Miller) meant that this little gem would soon be forgotten. Until 2011, that is, when Cherry Red reissued it on CD, expanded with some rather nice bonus material from demos of a follow on project. Thankfully we can all enjoy Hardwater now with crystal clear production, instead of second or third generation cassette tapes made from a scratchy LP.\n\nInterestingly, the same year that Hardwater released their album, The Yankee Dollar’s sole release, also self-titled, would include three covers from the album, including City Sidewalks, a shortened Sanctuary and Good Ol’ Friends. Their treatment of City Sidewalks is a bit heavy handed, but they nailed Sanctuary with a groovy Shocking Blue treatment.\n\nI apologize for the length of this particular posting. This is one of those albums I never expected to be reissued."
