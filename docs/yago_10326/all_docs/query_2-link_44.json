        "text": "When Doves Cry is the sixth track on Prince’s sixth album Purple Rain, the first album to be credited to Prince and the Revolution and, five weeks prior to the album’s release, When Doves Cry was released as the album’s first single (credited only to Prince). The track is also featured in the movie Purple Rain.\n\nIn 1993, the track was included as the first track on Prince’s first compilation album The Hits 1 (also included as the first disc of The Hits / The B-Sides).\n\nIn 1994, Kirk Johnson remixed the track at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, Minnesota, and the remix, while unreleased, was partially included in the Purple Medley and the Kirk J’s B Sides Remix medley.\n\nIn 2001, the track was included as the fourth track on the compilation album The Very Best Of Prince.\n\nIn 2006, the track was included as the sixth track on the first disc of the compilation album Ultimate.\n\nBasic tracking took place on 1 March 1984 at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California (some days after Traffic Jam and two days after Love And Sex), as the final track recorded for Purple Rain. Of note is that both the track’s ascending synth-string ending and the extended part as it was played on the Purple Rain Tour are both quite reminiscent of Traffic Jam, recorded only days earlier.\n\nIt was included as the fifth song on the 23 March 1984 configuration of the album (before Take Me With U was added for the final configuration, compiled on 14 April 1984).\n\nThe single version of the track was included as the tenth track on the first disc of an early configuration of the compilation album Ultimate before the album was reworked for release."
