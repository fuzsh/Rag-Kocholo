It’s fairy tale, horror movie, and coming-of-age story all at once, like Alice in Wonderland with medieval and religious overtones.” -Criterion\n\nA girl on the verge of womanhood finds herself in a sensual fantasyland of vampires, witchcraft, and other threats in this eerie and mystical movie daydream. Valerie and Her Week of Wonders serves up an endlessly looping, nonlinear fairy tale, set in a quasi-medieval landscape. Ravishingly shot, enchantingly scored, and spilling over with surreal fancies, this enticing phantasmagoria from director Jaromil Jireš is among the most beautiful oddities of the Czechoslovak New Wave.\n\nValerie and Her Week of Wonders will be preceded by The Pied Piper, Jiří Barta’s haunting 1986 stop-motion telling of the medieval rat-catcher of Hamelin."
