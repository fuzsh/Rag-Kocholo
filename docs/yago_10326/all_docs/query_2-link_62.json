Clunky dialogue, cheap sets and Ella Raines really getting the short end of the stick in this female dominated ensemble piece. Imagine M*A*S*H from the nurses tents.\n\nWe follow a group of new and very green volunteer replacement nurses and aides arriving at a WW2 Philippines field hospital. Short on supplies, food, medicine these scrappy dames survive on pride, street smarts and a quick wit.\n\nThis gets progressively darker and knowing the real life circumstances one gets to wonder how these young women are going to get outta…\n\nMark Antony: “raging for revenge, with Ate (goddess of mischief and ruin) by his side come hot from hell, shall in these confines with a Monarch's voice cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war.\n\n\"Havoc\" is a military order permitting the seizure of spoils after a victory: rape, pillage, and plunder.\n\nThe \"dogs of war\" are the political and societal restraints against war that operate during times of peace.\n\nThis film was initially released about a year after the Battle of Bataan and the Bataan Death March (but this event was not made public until January 1944 so the film was widely released February 1944) so it would have been perhaps even more stirring than it is today.…\n\nThe context of this film is certainly interesting, even for a WWII film.
