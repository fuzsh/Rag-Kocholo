        "text": "The last time I cried at a film – and I don’t mean a dewy eye or a lump in the throat, I mean really, properly crying – was early this year. It was a Saturday night. I sat down in my living room to watch Maestro, Bradley Cooper’s Leonard Bernstein biopic. It was touch and go from the beginning, the film crafted with an exquisite tenderness, soundtracked by the huge orchestras Bernstein spent his life conducting.\n\nSure enough, about three-quarters through, the floodgates opened. I broke. Malfunctioned. Totally lost it. I was hysterical, snot everywhere. (“They – just – love – each other – so – much”, I managed to stammer to my boyfriend, pathetically, through heaving sobs.) This outpouring of emotion felt momentous, and memorable, because it had been a while since a film moved me in such theatrical proportion.\n\nYet there was a time in my life when crying at a film was less a surprising and involuntary physiological response, an interruption to an otherwise uneventful Saturday night in, and more a deliberately sought social activity. As teenagers, my friends and I would wade through a rotation of lachrymose slush on repeat at sleepovers, theatrically announcing to one another the first signs of optic dampness, competing to see who cried the most at the same bits we knew would make us cry to begin with.\n\nYou may think watching the Titanic sink 15 times a year is a form of masochism – but to us, it meant connection. On the floors of our parents’ living rooms, through makeovers and Domino’s pizza and “would you rather” and “never have I ever”, we found ourselves, and each other – and then consummated our discoveries, later in the evening, through this controlled expression of vulnerability.\n\nNow, the tearjerker feels hopelessly dated. One of our go-to films was The Notebook, which was released 20 years ago this week. Based on Nicholas Sparks’s 1996 novel about teen sweethearts torn apart by class disparity and war and starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling (who, 14-year-old me would tell everyone who’d listen, ACTUALLY dated after filming together), it’s the kind of schmaltzy romance that simply does not get made anymore. The soaring strings! The bird metaphors! The sheer amount of kissing! (To be fair, it won “Best Kiss” at the MTV Awards in 2004, with McAdams and Gosling recreating the scene live on stage.) And of course, it culminated in what can only be described as a happy tragedy.\n\nAt the time, though, this was par for the course. In 2004 there was a canon of three decades of tearjerkers for such films to slot into, even beyond 1997’s Titanic. Weepy dramas like Terms of Endearment (1983), Steel Magnolias (1982), Watership Down (1978), Black Beauty (1994), ET (1982), and The Railway Children (1970) gave way to amped up, manipulative Noughties tragedies – from PS I Love You (2007) to My Sister’s Keeper (2008) and also that year, Marley and Me (2008). But since then, it’s difficult to think of a film offhand that fits the tearjerker formula. So what’s become of them since?\n\nTearjerkers vary in plot, but what they have in common is that they make a contrived effort to move their viewer. This could be via one specific scene of overwhelming release (The Railway Children) or two hours of mawkish poignancy (The Notebook). But both these techniques, deployed in such an obvious way, now feel clichéd: in recent years, as we have become more aware of cynical Hollywood marketing, more guarded, perhaps, about exactly whom we allow to toy with our emotions, we have collectively become more cynical and critical of such a deliberate structure.\n\nAt the turn of the 2010s, mega-producers like Disney and Marvel, and film franchises like Despicable Me and The Hunger Games, began to dominate the box office completely.\n\nWe were perhaps increasingly wary of having our sadness extracted by multinational corporations – though, of course, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house during Disney’s Toy Story 2 (1999) – but such dominance also meant less reliance on story and more emphasis on character, branding and production, drawing in viewers to the same world again and again.\n\nEven aside from the CGI and superhero megahits, human interest films in the late 2000s and early 2010s tended towards outrageous comedy (The Hangover, 2009) or genre subversion (Bridesmaids, 2011). Audiences were, perhaps, just a little bit bored of being brought to the brink – instead seeking entertainment with edge.\n\nSuch disillusionment with the “tearjerker” genre has continued, and it’s easy to see why. The genre tends to be synonymous with lowbrow: easily deployable by LA fat cats, each tear collected being converted into a dollar bill. We have become justifiably cynical – but sentimentality is also an easy attribute to criticise.\n\nWriting in Art Review at the end of 2023, in a year-in-review film article headlined “If it makes you cry, it must be good”, Caitlin Quinlan considered Lukas Dhont’s Close and Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale to be “squeezing by hand the tears from audiences’ eyeballs”. These tears were, she thought, a heavy price to pay for products essentially light on substance: “These films all took from their audiences without giving much back… asking viewers to project their own experiences and feelings onto a blank canvas narrative.”\n\nThe same could undoubtedly be said of ET, The Notebook, and even Titanic, in which the primary source of our teen heartbreak wasn’t the death of 1500 people but the untimely demise of floppy-haired rapscallion Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose three-day love affair with a stunningly beautiful wealthy debutante (Kate Winslet) was the Platonic ideal of love itself.\n\nBut the notion of routine crying brought on by art goes back much further than Hollywood. Aristotle first used the term “catharsis”, a medical term for purging or cleansing, as a metaphor in Poetics, describing the emotional effect of dramatic tragedy. Its purpose, he wrote, should be to induce terror and pity in the audience, and thereby effect the catharsis of those feelings.\n\nNow, we understand that art can provide a manageable space for us to excise and explore our emotions (which, says modern psychology, is a healthy thing for us to do). It allows us to let go of grief that we hadn’t quite identified yet, and consequently – in line with the scientific view that crying releases a feel-good hormone – feel better and lighter. It’s no wonder it’s so important for teenage girls.\n\nIt’s also no coincidence that we were teenage girls: tearjerkers tend to be marketed to women, and overlap with romcoms or pure romances – which women are presumed to enjoy, and which have also declined steadily over the past decade.\n\nHistorians disagree about when exactly crying took on feminine associations, but by the 19th century, such outward displays of vulnerability were firmly a womanly pursuit; needless to say, most modern teenage boys are not losing it over Rent at 1am every other weekend.\n\nAnd crying’s perceived femininity – in opposition to the masculine imperative to control one’s emotions – is wrapped up in how we view sentimental art. In fact, “sentimentalism” as we know it can be traced back to 18th– and 19th-century literature – novels that deliberately sought to evoke an emotional response in their readers. Victorian romance novels in particular soon came to be seen as unserious pursuits of women whose feelings, in turn, were not particularly serious either.\n\nMany classic tearjerker films have the same connotations of feminine weakness. But the context of crying more generally has changed significantly. After Freudian ideas spread in the early 20th century, “catharsis” of the subconscious became the status quo; in the past few decades, outward displays of emotion represent bravery and honesty. The “crying selfie” that took hold of social media a few years ago, championed by celebrities like Bella Hadid, and this year, Justin Bieber, has developed into the startlingly common practice of filming oneself crying and posting it online. Instagram and TikTok are awash with videos of the heartbroken, lonely and disappointed, wailing and sobbing as they wipe their face with one hand and hold their phone in the other.\n\nThough this may feel nauseating and excessive – in some cases even pornographic – it’s difficult not to see it as an extension of that sleepover bonding. Darwin said that crying had no evolutionary purpose – but more recent science has shown it’s socially beneficial, fostering empathy and connection. Connection being, of course, the entire purpose of social media and more literally, the internet at large.\n\nMany of those crying videos use films and books as their source material (the bestselling romance author Colleen Hoover, for example, found her fame on TikTok, where readers film themselves weeping exuberantly after finishing one of her many books). Yet their prevalence shows it’s no longer necessary for us to be guided by the steady hand of Hollywood into a place of emotional release. We still cry at films; the producers may, in some cases, still try to “squeeze [us] by hand”. But we are not backed so neatly into that corner: different kinds of stories make us cry, more organically, for different reasons.\n\nIn the past decade, the likes of Moonlight (2016), Paddington (2014)and Little Women (2019) have opened the collective floodgates – but rarely do they feel as sensationalist, purposefully inviting a physical response, as the early tearjerkers. One conventionally tragic example, which had the whole cinema sniffling, is A Star Is Born (2018) – but this was the fourth remake of a film originally released in 1937.\n\nIt was, in a way, a relief for me to cry at Maestro. Not only because I felt lighter afterwards, or because it proved my heart hadn’t turned to stone since Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird (2017), which had me in a similar state (this time in public). It was also because it reminded me of those early experiences with my friends. Moments of deep connection forged over something we knew, even at the time, was artificial.\n\nSociety, which is increasingly both emotionally intelligent and performative, no longer needs tearjerkers like The Notebook to push us to the brink with syrupy strings – but that’s because we, as individuals, know all too well the benefits of sitting on the sofa and crying at a movie."
