        "text": "Dominic Cooper (“Mamma Mia”) and Sarah Gadon (“A Dangerous Method”) are co-starring in “Cry From The Sea,” a Canadian-Irish movie directed by cinematographer-turned-helmer Vic Sarin (“Cold Comfort”).\n\nThe movie, which is currently shooting, is represented in international markets by Cinema Management Group, with WME and Laura Rister handling U.S. rights and Level Film on board as the Canadian distributor.\n\nPenned by Ciaran Creagh (“Parked”), “Cry From The Sea” is set in the aftermath of World War I and the Irish Civil War. It revolves around Seamus Óg Mac Grianna (Cooper), an Irish lighthouse keeper who has created a life of isolation and ritual in penance for a tragedy he feels he should have prevented. Seamus’s only company is Maire (Bolger), his housekeeper and protector, who enables him to remain closed off from the world while quietly waiting for him to see her. His meticulously structured world begins to crack when he meets Edith (Gadon), an outspoken American war widow whose quest for closure ignites something in Seamus that will forever change them all.\n\nThe international cast is completed by Sarah Bolger (“In America”) and Aidan Quinn (“Benny & Joon”)\n\n“Cry From The Sea” is being produced by Vancouver-based Sepia Films and Dublin-based ShinAwiL. Producers are Tina Pehme and Kim Roberts at Sepia, and Larry Bass and Aaron Farrell at ShinAwiL.\n\nThe film is due to wrap production late October 2023 and is being financed by Telefilm Canada and Screen Ireland."
