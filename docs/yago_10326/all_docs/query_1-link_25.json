        "text": "\"THE JOKE,\" a film by Jaromil Jires of Czechoslovakia shown at the New York Film Festival last night, is a bleakly humorous vignette that dramatizes the dehumanization and defeat of one man under very specific circumstances. Although it is an intelligent, well-made film, it is also — surprisingly — somewhat banal. It achieves its goals so early that there isn't much for the mind and the eye to do but to consider the incriminating, repetitive details of lives made bitter, empty and hypocritical under Stalinist Communism.Ludvik Jahn (Josef Somr), a middle-aged bachelor, returns to the small town where he grew up to the sounds of slogans (\"Strength Through Optimism\") during the postwar years of Communist Revolution. Ludvik remembers his dismissal from the university and from the Communist party 15 years earlier for counterrevolutionary activities—he had written a postcard to a rather doltish girl, a type more interested in politics than in sex, announcing that \"Optimism is the opiate of mankind!\"By chance, Ludvik meets the wife of the man who was responsible for his dismissal and plots revenge by cuckolding his former friend. For Ludvik, sex has become a weapon, but, as it turns out, one of rather dubious value.\"The Joke,\" which mixes the past with the present in neatly chronological flashbacks, is a movie heavy with ironies. Confident songs of the revolution (\"We are building a bright new world,\" proclaims one; \"No more masters, no more slaves,\" says another) overlap scenes in labor camps and Army prisons. Teen-agers, members of the post-revolution generation, drown out a live band playing gentle folk music with transistor radios playing rock. The ultimate irony occurs when Ludvik meets his former enemy—the pious student revolutionist has become a sophisticated bourgeois with a 20-year-old mistress. Thus even Ludvik's fantasy of revenge is denied him. In effect, it is expropriated as some piece of personal property might have been under the Stalinists.As a narrative, \"The Joke\" is somewhat too neat for my tastes — too perfectly balanced. Jires is, however, a filmmaker of humor and perception. As a result, individual scenes often take on a sudden life that seems isolated from the over-all frame—a lethargic relay race in an Army prison is very funny, as is the humiliation of a lady who thinks she is committing suicide only to learn that she has taken a large number of laxative tablets.Since \"The Joke\" was made, Czechoslovakia has entered a new era of progressive repression. This fact gives the exhibition of the movie here a poignant political significance that has nothing to do with art. The film will be shown again at Alice Tully Hall Sunday at 6:30 P.M.\n\nTHE JOKE, screenplay by Jaromil Jires, based on the novel of the same name by Milan Kundera. Directed by Mr. Jires; produced by Smida-Fikar—Studio de Cinema de Barrandoy. At the New York Film Festival, Alice Tully Hall. Running time: 79 minutes.Ludvik Jahn . . . . .
