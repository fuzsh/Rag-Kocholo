        "text": "When Stanley Kubrick advertised his masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, as “The Ultimate Trip” in 1968, he was signalling a sign of the times. The 60’s had been a convulsion of social and cultural change, and cinema was no different. Notably, in Europe and Asia, filmmakers, writers, and actors began to provocatively experiment with radical, non-linear ways of presenting film to audiences.\n\nThe titles in the Calgary Cinematheque’s Phantasmagoria series are but a brief sample of these experiments. Funny, scary, romantic, and psychedelic, these movies utilize some of the greatest strengths that the motion picture has yet discovered. Exotic images, kaleidoscopic colours, otherworldly sounds and chimeric illusions suggest a primordial, Jungian realm of the senses that only cinema can reveal.\n\nHouse (1977) Directed by NOBUHIKO OBAYASHI\n\nOCTOBER 6, 2022\n\nThe most berserk comedy-horror film ever made, the feverish House has everything. Malevolent fluffy cats, fingers without hands that play possessed pianos, even a flying head that bites unwary rear ends. Seven girls (with names like Gorgeous, Kung Fu, and Fantasy) go to visit the aunt of one of their group, and quickly encounter poltergeist phenomena pitched somewhere between Suspiria (1977), Jaws (1975), and a slapstick episode of Buffy on acid. Based on Japanese legends of Jikininki (hungry ghosts), House is completely impossible to predict, and may possibly be the most unforgettable movie you’ll ever see.\n\nJuliet of the Spirits (1965) DIRECTED by federico Fellini\n\nNovember 3, 2022\n\nFederico Fellini at his frothiest, Juliet of the Spirits was not only the Italian maestro’s first film in colour, it was his first after his well-publicized personal experiment with LSD. To the tune of Nino Rota’s acid cocktail lounge score, a spiritual guru reveals a scandalous truth to housewife Giulietta (the ever charismatic Giulietta Masina), plunging her into a cacophony of spiritual encounters. Swirling with circus-like phantasms, Giulietta’s world is floridly visualized by Fellini (with the help of Phero Ghirardi’s sugary sets, and Gianni de Vincenzo’s eye popping cinematography) to the hilt of psychedelic expressiveness."
