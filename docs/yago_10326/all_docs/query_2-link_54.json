        "text": "LAS CRUCES – Moviegoers will once again see Clint Eastwood grace the silver screen in his newly released “Cry Macho,” a movie filmed in New Mexico about a former rodeo star who finds himself teaching a boy what it means to be a good man.\n\nEastwood starred in and directed the film — the latest in a string of movies the actor/director has worked on in the state. His previous New Mexico-filmed movie was “The Mule,” a 2018 film about a man who becomes a drug mule for a Mexican cartel. “The Mule” was filmed in locations around Las Cruces as well as White Sands National Park.\n\nCounty music singer Dwight Yoakam (“Sling Blade,” “Panic Room”) and Daniel V. Graulau also star in the new film. It is based on the 1975 novel of the same name by N. Richard Nash.\n\nThe story takes place in Texas and rural Mexico, but was filmed in in Belen and Polvadera, New Mexico — in Valencia and Socorro counties, respectively.\n\nMore: 1960s to today: Popular movies filmed in the Las Cruces area\n\n“Cry Macho” was released in theatres Friday, Sept. 17 and for streaming on HBO Max through Oct. 17. It runs at about two hours and is rated PG-13."
