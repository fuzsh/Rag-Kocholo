        "text": "The Library of Congress has announced the annual addition of 25 important American movies to its National Film Registry, and two important LGBTQ titles are among them.\n\nThe National Film Registry selects 25 films each year showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage to increase awareness for its preservation. This year’s inductees are heavily weighted toward diverse content, with several films directed by women and people of color, in addition to the two LGBTQ-themed titles, “Before Stonewall” and “Boys Don’t Cry.”\n\n“Before Stonewall,” Greta Schiller’s 1984 documentary looking back at the LGBTQ community of the 20th century before the 1969 protests at the Stonewall Inn and other key instances of LGBTQ resistance sparked the rise of the modern equality movement.\n\n“Boys Don’t Cry,” released in 1999, is the fictionalized docudrama about the rape and murder of real-life trans teen Brandon Teena, played by in an Oscar-winning performance by Hilary Swank. The film’s director, Kimberly Pierce, commented in the Registry’s official release, “Twenty years later, it still feels like a miracle that ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ got made. I fell in love with Brandon Teena and his desire to live and love as himself in a time and place where that was impossible. I felt a powerful conviction to bring Brandon to life on screen, so audiences would love him as I did and share my horror at his rape and murder. To our amazement, the world embraced Brandon. It is meaningful to me as a filmmaker, a genderqueer and as a person that the Library of Congress has recognized ‘Boys Don’t Cry.’ This moment is a culmination, unimaginable and wonderful.”\n\nPrevious LGBTQ-themed inductees have included “Brokeback Mountain,” “Paris is Burning,” and “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Nevertheless, the Registry has acknowledged the lack of representation for queer titles on its list.\n\nSpeaking with Time, Professor Jacqueline Stewart, who heads the registry board’s inclusion task force, told the magazine, “One of the things we uncovered when we looked at the registry is that we have a long way to go in terms of reflecting LGBTQ+ experiences.”\n\nOther films included among this year’s additions are “Amadeus,” “Clerks,” “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” “Gaslight,” “The Last Waltz,” “Platoon,” “Purple Rain,” “She’s Gotta Have It,” Disney’s “Sleeping Beauty” and “Zoot Suit.”\n\nYou can see the full list here.\n\n‘Olney Outdoors’\n\nDrag and Drinks\n\nSunday, Aug. 25\n\nOlney Theatre Center 2001 Olney-Sandy Spring Road, Olney, MD 20832 $35Olneytheatre.org\n\n“Mosquitoes aren’t a problem. But doing drag in 90-degree heat is. And this summer has been brutal.”\n\nSo says Devon Vaow, the director and emcee of Drag and Drinks, a popular part of Olney Outdoors, a selection of summertime shows performed al fresco at Olney Theatre Center (OTC). As the show’s emcee Evon Michelle (Vaow’s longtime vivacious drag persona), he helms the action onstage.\n\nDrag and Drinks consists of three different Sunday afternoon performances. With two down there’s still one to go on Sunday, Aug. 25 featuring special guest Ada Vox (from “American Idol” and “Queen of the Universe”), Sapphire Dupree, Enigma, and Tiara Missou.\n\n“It’s a relaxed, PG-rated show,” says Vaow. It’s also a true drag mélange, and depending on the performance, the lineup might feature drag kings, live singing queens, dancing queens, and lip-sync assassins. Building on previous summer successes, the show continues to attract an eclectic audience and ranks as the most well-attended of Olney Outdoors’ offerings.\n\n“As a queer of color, I was skeptical,” says Vaow. “Are we what a theater in suburban Montgomery County wants? Apparently yes, the drag shows are the most attended programming.”\n\nRaised in small town Meadville, Pa., an hour north of Pittsburgh, Vaow studied voice and piano at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. He first donned drag at a college frat party where girls drank free. The ruse worked and he was hooked.\n\nGay and single, Vaow, 29, has been doing drag professionally for seven years. His initial experience included quick gigs in far-flung clubs including Orlando’s Pulse, site of the horrific mass shooting in 2016. Fortunately, he wasn’t there that night. He says, “It’s not been without its trials and tribulations, but I like it, and I strive to do things that haven’t been done before.”\n\n“In Baltimore, I was the first queen to have a billboard. I was also the first drag queen to have a residency at Baltimore’s National Aquarium,” adds Vaow who’s based in Charm City where he was named drag queen of the year. The unique yearlong residency was divided into six months of research, lab work, and culminated in a sold-out floor show. Vaow focused on survival through adaptation, comparing how both the LGBTQ community and marine aquatic life have had to adapt to continue.\n\n“With wildlife we look at the ecosystem, pollution and global warming. I related that to queer people getting through the AIDS epidemic, legalization of marriage and the drag ban. It demonstrates the strength of our community.”\n\nAdditionally, the self-described “serial entrepreneur” has parlayed drag into business opportunities. During COVID, he cleverly conceived Driveway Drag Show, a concept where the queens bring the show to the audiences. Also, a massively attended drag brunch at a restaurant in Glen Bernie, Md., grew into SAD Brunch, a large LGBTQ entertainment company. Vaow is both founder and director of entertainment.\n\nActor/director Kevin McAllister who also serves as OTC’s director of curated programming is definitely a fan: “Evon has hosted and performed in every drag show I’ve produced at Olney since I started in 2021. I never want to work without her. She truly does it all. She’s hilarious. She always looks amazing with fresh looks and wigs for every performance. She dances. She lip-syncs ferociously. And, just when you think she is out of skills, she pulls out a microphone and sings the house down with her gorgeous voice. As a host, she has a way of making every audience feel connected to her.\n\n“She’s engaging and always quick with a one liner. Evon is the reason so many come back to our shows again and again. We are so grateful for her and the gifts she shares on the Olney stage year after year.”\n\nAt OTC, Vaow also worked as drag consultant for the company’s production of “Kinky Boots.” He recalls, “Any and everything that drag touched on the show I was there. Everything from costumes, hair, and makeup, I was basically a second opinion.”\n\nThroughout the 1940s, Olney was a busy summer stock destination, presenting shows featuring theatrical luminaries such as Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Tallulah Bankhead, and Helen Hayes.\n\nWhile Vaow is honored to tread the same boards as these monumental names in live theater, he says “it’s an even bigger honor to not only create a culture in Olney, like drag, but help shape it as well. Jason Loewith (OTC’s artistic director) along with Kevin McAllister have given me the tools to facilitate some of the best drag shows Maryland has to offer.”"
