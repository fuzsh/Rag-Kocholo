        "text": "An entire generation of skateboarders fell in love with The Cry in the early 90s after hearing songs from their LP Beautiful Reasons in the 1990 skateboard video Hokus Pokus from H-Street Skateboards. Hokus Pokus is now regarded as one of the most iconic skateboard videos ever with the soundtrack always praised.\n\nIt was then, as they were getting more and more attention and being courted by a major label that they did something completely unexpected. They disappeared.\n\nBeautiful Reasons, which only had a limited cassette release, became a thing of legend. THE CRY’s heartfelt vocals, jangly guitars, upbeat drumming, and distinct bass lines never stopped attracting new fans, or growing in the hearts of old fans, and over the next 25+ years they achieved something of a cult status.\n\nThe digital streaming world just recently brought their music back into the light and empowered by their fans and supporters The Cry have now returned new music. The songs are just as upbeat, earnest and unforgettable as the music that built their myth. Maybe even more so. Their songwriting is more confident than ever, their current releases see them exploring new tones and embracing catchy hooks and sad nuance like few can.\n\nGlide is thrilled to premiere “It Is As It Seems” from The Cry, a near-perfect exhibition of quiet rage, gloomy vocals and big-hearted guitar rock. With the take or leave it approach of The Fall and the modern brazen delivery of Fontaines D.C., The Cry are indeed once again a musical reprieve.\n\nThe Cry are releasing a string of new singles and are working toward a full-length LP expected in 2020"
