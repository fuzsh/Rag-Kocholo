        "text": "Everyone's been there—and by there, I mean in need of a good sob. Maybe you’ve had a tough work week, you've spent one too many hours doom-scrolling, or you’re nursing a throbbing heartbreak. Whatever the reason, a big, cathartic cry can make you feel better.\n\nThere's a reason for that, too. Researchers have shown that crying releases oxytocin and endogenous opioids (a.k.a. endorphins), the feel-good chemicals that help ease emotional and physical pain, according to Harvard Medical School. And when you need that very specific type of release, there's no better way to stir up a fresh set of tears than a sad movie—so, cue these tear-jerkers.\n\nIf you're one of those people who love getting emotionally destroyed by movies, you've come to the right place. Maybe you absolutely lose it over movies with animals (and inevitably, their death) like Marley and Me, or bawl like a baby through sappy, dramatic Titanic-esque romance flicks. You could be a purist and go straight for the jugular with My Sister’s Keeper and Sophie’s Choice. Or let the silent, stricken sorrow of a film rooted in reality unravel you *cough* The Florida Project *cough*.\n\nGrab some tissues or not (skincare by your tears), get your emotional support blanket, and let yourself feel all the feels with these 50 best sad movies."
