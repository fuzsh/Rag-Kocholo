Jaromil Jireš Spine: #761 Blu-ray Release Date: June 30, 2015 Screen captures below are taken from The Criterion Collection Blu-ray disc, but resolution has been reduced from 1920x1080 to 900x506 and slightly compressed. You may click on them to view the 900x506 image. Because my own Blu-ray drive broke this past week, Gary Tooze of DVD Beaver has kindly granted me permission to use stills he posted on his website DVD Beaver (here) until I get my drive fixed.\n\nAfter the Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1968 ended a brief period of (relative) artistic freedom that flowered into the mysterious and fascinating films of the Czech New Wave, director Jaromil Jireš, who’d honed his craft fighting political censors to expose the communist regime during the 1960s, stayed in the country and continued to make films, albeit films that were less politically contentious. One such film, riding the final oscillations of the Czech New Wave, is 1970’s phantasmagoric take on the maturation of a young girl, Valerie and Her Week of Wonders. Containing the energy and creativity of the Czech New Wave — as well as a healthy dose of its metaphorical subterfuge — Valerie and Her Week of Wonders is a playful fairy tale, filled with darkness and wonder, the wonder, as the title suggests, usually winning out. Today marks the film’s release on Blu-ray and DVD by The Criterion Collection.\n\nThis non-linear quasi-horror film is based on a novel by Vitezslav Nezval, himself an avant-garde, surrealist poet. Avant-garde, surrealist, poet: those words might be the best way to introduce the essence of the film, which doesn’t concern itself with narrative cohesion that might appeal to our logical side; rather, it appeals to our senses and impulses, making perfect, if quite different, sense — and it is very effective. I first saw this film when I was in my early twenties, and, honestly, more than any other film I watched in my younger days it helped me to understand and sympathize with the perils of a young woman’s adolescence. There are monsters there we men just don’t see.\n\nValerie is a thirteen-year-old girl who still lives in a white room that isn’t quite a nursery but isn’t too far from it. This is where she think and also retreats to should there be a need, though childish playthings cannot always protect one from leering monsters.\n\nWe follow the young Valerie as she sleeps in a gazebo and loses her earrings to a thief, then curiously looks upon the world around her, intrigued, for example, by the vibrant playfulness of a group of white-clad women bathing in a lake or enjoying a parade. Sure, we don’t understand what all of this means, but, then again, neither does she. It’s a time of puzzlement, but one that more than merits its intrigue. These seemingly unrelated events set the course for this week of discovery that will usher Valerie, in more dream-like imagery, from the innocence of childhood to the experience of the adult world, particularly the adult world of sexuality. The journey is perilous and wondrous, and there are plenty of individuals who have been wounded and who look to wound amidst all of the Freudian dreamscape that has its various corollaries in the world we live in.\n\nValerie lives with her grandmother, a pasty, gaunt woman, who may be seeking to protect Valerie from the adult world or who may be one of those individuals so wounded by her own adulthood that she suffers from her own perverse desires to inflict pain.\n\nWhen Valerie talks to her grandmother about some of her recent experiences, her grandmother is not particularly happy. However, we get a sense of her grandmother’s own pain when Valerie tells her she has seen a particularly frightful man, someone the grandmother seems to know.\n\nAt about this point in the film, we become certain that all attempts to follow clear lines of logic will fall apart, wonderfully. The grandmother disappears, and in her place is a much younger woman who may or may not be the grandmother herself as a vampire, but who definitely is interested in Valerie’s blood. The monstrous man also has a porous identity, associated as he is to many of the men — or potential men (the lover of Valerie’s grandmother, Valerie’s own father, the priest) — in the film, who may be the same man but not necessarily so (after all, they cannot all be the same man in reality, right?). I do not want to suggest all men in the film are portrayed as monstrous, as there are those who seem to genuinely care for Valerie; in fact, some of these very men who may be the monster appear at other times to be quite noble and loving.\n\nIt’s is invigorating to let expectations of coherence and logic go and simply considers the multiple ways of thinking about the film itself. This is reality cast upon multiple planes, mimicking quite nicely that strange time when we become adults, when we become aware of and start to see more clearly the dots in the world around us, though our abilities to connect the dots are not quite developed.\n\nFor example, Valerie knows that in some way — perhaps not literally, but perhaps too literally — the men are connected, particularly in their menace. Just as interesting are the many other forces that act upon Valerie — these dots that surround her — in particular Christianity and other women who have also found predominantly joy or suffering, and can dole out either.\n\nDeliberately jumpy in its editing and pacing (and plot!), the film is held together by its fantastic imagery and aural delights that come by way of an enchanting score by Luboš Fišer.\n\nBetween this release and last week’s release of The Bridge, Criterion brings a nice conclusion to the first half of 2015.\n\nSupplements:"
