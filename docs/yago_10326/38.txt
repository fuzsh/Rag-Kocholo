Jaromil Jires, one of the Czech New Wave-generation film directors, died Oct. 24 in Prague. He death was the result of head injuries sustained in an automobile accident two years earlier. He was 65.

Jires was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, but left the Slovak capital to study camera and directing at Prague’s film academy, FAMU. He began his directing career in the 1960s with “The Cry,” but it was his 1968 adaptation of “The Joke,” based on the novel by Milan Kundera, that was perhaps his most important work in a career that spanned four decades.

Jires was best known for films adapted from literature. He worked at Barrandov Film Studio until 1992, directing films including “Valerie and the Week of Wonders, “… And My Love to the Swallows,” “Catapult,” and “Lion With a White Mane.”

After leaving Barrandov, his last three films were “Helimadoe” (1993), “The Dance Teacher” (1995) and “Double Role” (1999). The latter two films won Czech Lion awards for the leading actor and actress. Jires was honored at festivals including Oberhausen, Bergam and Harare and was recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award in St. Etienne.

In addition to directing films, Jires directed documentaries and adapted operas for television. He also collaborated on productions at Prague’s Laterna Magika Theater. Jires served as the Czech Republic’s representative to Eurimages and spent several years in the 1990s working toward the establishment of a Czech Audiovisual Center.
