Such a southern atmosphere, in which satyrs and fauns pursue nymphs by means of trickery and take their midday naps in the shade of reeds, guides us when designing and leads us to pictures that are determined by vegetation and seem timeless and serene. Whether in a park or on the side of a street, on public squares or in gardens: spatial qualities create locations that invite spending time. One senses a prankster behind one’s back—or is it a faun?"
