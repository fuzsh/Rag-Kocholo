        "text": "THE OBRIST FAMILY NAME\n\nUntil the Middle Ages, both men and women were onlyknown by their first names. As thepopulation grew, however, first names no longer were sufficient todifferentiate between members of different families. The current system, basedon last names, developed at this time. The evidence of this change is first found in city registers, but by the13th and 14th centuries, the custom had also spread torural areas. In the areas under investigation in this work, last namesdeveloped around the year 1300, created out of a combination of the oldfirst name, origin, place of residence, occupation, classor reputation, or based on physical and personality traits of the person inquestion. In the Obristfamily tradition, the place of residence was most often used as the identifyingcharacteristic. In time, however, this combination of first and last name was no longersufficient and additional names were added to the family name. These extra names served the purpose ofdifferentiating between different lines of the same family and remained in useby many municipalities for centuries. The practice has now disappeared.\n\nTHE LINGUISTIC ROOTS OF THE“OBRIST” FAMILY NAME\n\nThe Old High German forms of the name were Oberost(also Niderost), ze Oberost, ze Oberest, Oberst and, finally, Zobrist andObrist. As there was no officiallyrecognized version of the name, there was wide variance in the way it waswritten. Each family used the version to which it was most accustomed.\n\nThere is no doubt that the family stems from thearea that is now Switzerland, even if it was widely dispersed over this territory. In the work entitled “Old Zollikon”(Das alte Zollikon), written in 1899by Neusch and Bruppacher, the Obrist family of Zollikon maintained that theyhailed “from Hungary”, or perhaps in two lines from Hungary and Bohemia, andfled because of religious persecution”. Similar claims were posed (whichundoubtedly relied upon the information in Dasalte Zollikon) by individual members of the Obrist family from Riniken andthe Fricktal. In his book entitled “TheHistory of Möhlin” (Geschichte von Möhlin), Dr. Karl Schibwrites : “After they rid the Danubearea of the Turks, the Austrian government tried to gain control over the population of Hungary and the“Banat”……because the government wanted to encourage emigration of thesepopulations, they paid the travel and shipping costs of the fleeingresidents.” Given that at least one ortwo of these families would have, presumably, attempted to return to theircountry of origin, it can be assumed that this legend is of Hungarian orBohemian origin. (Please note: this is born out historically – The Hapsburgsorganized three migrations of “Swabians” from southwestern Germany andSwitzerland into Hungary. See my note)\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPERSIONOF THE OBRIST FAMILY NAME\n\nCANTON BASEL\n\nTherwil: The registry of Basel lists a Rudolphusdictus zu Oberst in the year 1336.\n\nReinach: A Ruodinus ze Oberst (the same person?)is named next to a Cuonradus ze Niderost.\n\nHemmikon: We find evidence of a tax debt fromHeinricus ze Oberst in 1363 and 1366 related to his construction effortson behalf of his brother Heine ze Oberst.\n\nThe Obrist family line has not been represented inany of these three municipalities for years, and they are no longer listed inthe Swiss Family Book of Names. SomeObrists did, however, immigrate into the Basel Area at a later date.\n\nCANTON BERN\n\nThere are numerous Obristslisted in the “Fontes Rerum Bernensium” between 1300 and 1400 for the areas ofLauterbrunnen, Unterseen, Grindelwal, Wegen and Mürren. In the families that stem from these areas,the name was transformed to Zobrist instead of Obrist (Information from theState Archives of Bern). The familyZobrist is still resident in Frutigen and Brienz, and stems from this ancestralline.\n\nAarwangen: (Sources: The civil registry of Aarwangen, State Archives of Bern andthe Das Amt Aarwangen by PaulKasser.) It is unclear whether theObrist family immigrated to Aarwangen already in possession of this name,or whether they were given this name after settling. There is some evidence that the namedeveloped after arrival.\n\nThe first Obrist in Aarwangen is listed inconnection with the building of a new bridge in Aarwangen in 1571. A Weibel Bendich Obrist appears in 1641,when he refused to pay the war taxes exacted by the government in Bern. He was then stripped of his government postand prohibited from running for office for the rest of his life. A Peter Obrist was part of the opposition inthe Farmer’s War (Bauernkrieg) of1653. He was bribed with 100 Gulden andforfeited his post at the court. TheObrists of Aarwangen were well respected, and were often involved in disputeswith the officials of the town. The records show the Obrist family namerepeatedly. The mills of Aarwangen werein the hands of a member of the Obrist family for many years. After 1739, we also find evidence of theObrist family in Thunstetten; and also, after 1750, in Bützerg.\n\nJohann Obrist. (Born 1823) had 9 daughtersand 5 sons from two marriages. Thefamily lived first in Burgdorf and moved to Vevey in 1854, where Johann Obristwas in charge of wine stocks. He laterestablished his own business in vineyards, wine making and the wine trade,which is highly regarded and has an excellent reputation in the area.\n\nCANTON ZURICH\n\n(Sources: Habsburger Records 1303-1308, RevocationRegister of Regensberg). The RevocationRegister was a list of all persons who were missing in the governed areabecause they had moved without official permission, and had become “entfremdet”,as it was expressed colloquially at the time. Oberost Rudolphus dictus ze Windlach, his two sons Heinricus andJohannes and his wife are listed in this register- “et sui liberi.” Three additional men with the name zuOberost are also mentioned in a subsequent entry.\n\nZollikon: (Source: Nüesch and Bruppacher- Dasalte Zollikon, 1899). Thissource mentions “Rudolph der Oberost, one of the twelve oldest jurywitnesses in Zollikon” as the first Obrist in Zollikon. Whether this Rudolf der Oberost is thesame person as the one from Windlach is subject to debate.Nüesch and Bruppacherpresent a description of the evolution of the Obrist family inZollikon. Those interested canreference their work; I will not replicate it here.\n\nThe old Obrist line is no longer represented inZollikon, but can be found other outlying municipalities of Zürich. One gets a picture of the previousimportance of this family in Zollikon, however, by the fact that therepresentative house or House of Representatives is named “Obristhof!”\n\nZürich: (Sources: Nüesch and Bruppacher Dasalte Zollikon, 1899 and The Historical-Biographical Encyclopaedia ofSwitzerland, HBLS.) The Obrists ofZollikon spread relatively quickly to Zürich. The HBLS maintains the following: “The genealogy is unclear.Ulrich Obrist was the master of guilds in 1359, 1363, and 1370. Heinrich led the representative body in1396; Jakob held the same position in 1406, and became a master ofbuilding construction in 1419. Hans Obrist was the chaplain in 1531, thehead of the representative house in 1536 and overseer of Schwamendingenbefore his death in 1540. HansRudolf was a portrait painter in Zürich from 1809 until the end of the1860s. The Obrist line thatnumbers among the patrician families of Zürich no longer exists.\n\nMoreover, the coat of arms of the Zürich Obrist isoften mistaken for the coats of arms of the Obrist family as a whole.\n\nRüschlikon/Kilchberg: (Source: Civil Register). Rüschlikon belonged to the municipalityof Kilchberg until 1721. One ofthe by-products of its independence was the creation of its own churchregister.\n\nIt seems that even residents from outside of themunicipalities came to Kilchberg for baptisms and marriages. Hans Heinrich Oberist (of Zollikon) andBarbara Abegg, for example, had their sons Hans Rudolf, Johannes and HansHeinrich baptized in Kilchberg on March 25, 1717, November 19, 1719 andNovember 7, 1722, respectively. HansHeinrich died soon after birth, but the family baptized a second son HansHeinrich on April 3, 1724. In addition we have the following information with regards tomarriages of couples from outside of the municipality:\n\nNovember 1754: Mr. HansUlrich OBRIST and Elisabeth Ruppert, both of Zürich.\n\nJune 20,1759: Mr. SalomonOberist VDM and Catechist ofHottingen and Anna Maria Elisabetha Michel, both of Zürich.\n\nJune 8, 1789: DavidGutmann and Susanna Obrist, both of Zürich.\n\nA number of the Obrists from Zollikon and Zürichwere obviously drawn to Kilchberg. Bartli Obrist, probably of Zollikon, appears as early as 1598 as abaptismal witness in Kilchberg. Therewere most likely family ties between Obrists in Kilchberg and members of theseoutside communities, which led to a general immigration of Zollikon Obristsinto the Rüschlikon-Kilchberg area. The first Obrist from Rüschlikon was presumablyHans-Rudolf, who was brought to Rüschlikon-Kilchberg by his parents on March25, 1717. He later became a member ofthe jury and Sekelmeister and marriedCatherina Tuggener on May 14, 1739. Thecouple lived in Böndler. Their childrenwere: Jakob (bap. May 31, 1745). Thewitness at this baptism was Jakob OBRIST of Zollikon. Susanna (bap. August 29, 1747) and Regula (bap. July 15, 1753). These daughters had the same baptismalwitness as their brother.\n\nJohannes Obrist. (later called Kilchmeyer) and AnnaBarbara Schwarzenbach baptized a son Jakob on August 6, 1753 (died. March 16,1829) and a daughter Elisabeth on December 25, 1755. Another Jacob Obrist. married Anna Treichleron September 24, 1775. Jacob OBRIST,who was later a jury witness in Kilchberg and Sekelmeister, and Anna Treichler baptized a son Hans Jacob on March27, 1777, who died soon after. A sonJohannes was baptized on April 18, 1779, then Hans Heinrich on May 7, 1780,Anna Barbara on February 26, 1786 (died soon after), and a son Heinrich on May2,1784. They baptized a second daughterwith the name of Anna Barbara on February 26, 1786, who died as a child. Anna was baptized on January 20, 1788 and athird daughter was baptized Anna Barbara on June 12, 1791. Two sons, Hans Jacob and Johannes, werebaptized on May 29, 1794 and November 15, 1796, respectively. Johannes died in 1825.\n\nThere were three families with the name Obrist inRüschlikon in 1824, and one living in a community of approximately 400-500residents outside of the area. By 1967,there was only one remaining Obrist family, among 4700 other residents inRüschlikon.\n\nThe Zürich newspaper, the “ZürichTagesanzeiger”, ran a report on a famous Obrist from Kilchberg under the title:“A Swiss Pathfinder in abstract art: Hermann Obrist’s Exhibition the Münich Art Nouveau Museum.” We quote: “the rediscovery of art nouveau isreminiscent of the wood cutters of Kilchberg, who in 1897, long beforeKandinsky painted his first abstract piece (1910) had already created abstractforms. The son of an affluent Swissdoctor and a Scottish noble (who was already honored in 1967 with an exhibitiondevoted to his work in Bern), studied natural science and medicine before hebegan to study art at the age of 25 in 1887. He was thoroughly bored by this course of study.” Herman Obrist became a potter, and then in1892, he founded an embroidery salon, which he brought with him when he movedto Münich in 1895. At the height of hisartistic career, he underwent a difficult stomach operation in 1914, and hedied on February 26, 1927 of a stroke. He was honored by the Bavarian National Museum in an exhibition on1928. His villa and two daughters allperished in the war.“Hermann Obristwas a leader of the Art Nouveau movement.”\n\nDübendorf: (Source: Civil register). The Obrists livedpreviously in the outlying village of Gfenn. Johann Obrist (born in Zollikon on May 6, 1759) and his wifeRegula Winkler lived in this village and ran a guesthouse. Their children were:\n\n-Caspar: baptised. mid-August 1785 (died soon after)\n\n-Heinrich: baptised. March 18, 1788\n\n-Felix: baptised.August 30, 1789\n\n-Regula: baptised. October 26, 1790\n\n-Barbara: baptized (died soon after birth)\n\n-Anna: baptised. November 3, 1793 (also died soon after).\n\nThe mother of these children died of complicationsin the birth of her last child on January 9, 1794, at the age of 34 years and 3months.\n\nJohann Obrist, also known as “Altwirth”, married hissecond wife Anna Magdalena Attinger (also from Gfenn) in 1795. They baptized Johannes on May 10, 1795(buried January 6, 1798), Anna Susanna on May 22, 1798 (buried on July 1,1798), Anna on October 15, 1798 (died soon after birth), and Hans Jacob onOctober 15, 1798 (buried on March 23, 1799). The mother of these twins died ten days after their birth at the age of35. The unlucky Johann marriedfor a third time, this time to 21 year-old Anna Barbara Künzli (also fromGfenn) on June 11, 1799. “ The marriagecould not be consummated on time due to war unrest and the presence ofHelvetian and Frank troops in the community.” The couple baptized Johann on March 3, 1800, Hans Jacob on March 1, 1801(died as a small child) and Hans Jacob on January 19, 1804. In 1805, four daughters and one son ofJohann’s 13 children were still living.\n\nThere was a second Obrist family in Gfenn zuDübendorf at the time- that of Johann Caspar Obrist and Barbara Trüb. “The father is from Zollikon and owns aguest house in Gfenn.” The couplebaptized Anna Margaretha on July 6, 1788 (died after two months- baptismalwitness was Jacob Obrist from Zollikon) and Hans Conrad on January 12, 1790,who also died soon after his baptism.\n\nThere are currently 23 residents in the areasurrounding Dübendorf with the Obrist family name (21 men and 2 singlewomen). Of these, only one is residentin the village.\n\nCANTON ST. GALLEN\n\n·Eichberg:Dr. Johannes Rohner of themunicipality Altstaetten found the following entries in the old tax register ofthe area:\n\n1497: Ursel Obrestin paid one Schilling forAltstaetten taxes.\n\n1499: UrselObrestin paid 2 Schillings for Alstaetter taxes and Hensli Oberest paid 4Manmaad, 1 Schilling for Hinterforster taxes.\n\nBetween 1500-1503, only Hensli Oberest is mentionedin the register. The next related entryis found in 1586, when Clas Oberest paid only the Eichberg taxes inAltstaetten. Dr. Rohner maintains that,“we can gather from these entries that the Obrist family line in neighboringEichberg reaches back to 15th century, although the family’s originis unclear. The name appears in manydifferent forms: Obrest, Obrist,Oberst, etc. The flourishing Obrist line in Eichberg is Protestant.” Dr, Rohner also maintains that a nownon-existent line in Altstätten was Catholic. The first citizen registry thatshows Eichberg as an independent municipality begins in 1766. The registry lists 28 people with the Obristfamily name; the first of these were Johannes and Johann Jacob Obrist. Theregistry shows that following entries from births and marriages around the turnof the century from the 18th to the 19th century:\n\nJuly 30, 1799: Thomas of Jören-Thomas, Süsswinkel married BarbaraWalt. Children: Johann Jakob (bornOctober 24, 1800), Johannes (born December 31, 1801) and Johann George(born January 2, 1804)\n\nNovember 26, 1799: Heinrich (born April 16, 1778) married unknown women Child: Magdalena (born July 4, 1801)\n\nJuly 1, 1800: Jakob (bornDecember 31, 1777) married Salome Rechsteiner. Children: Susanna (born June 4, 1802), A.Magdelena (born. October 12, 1810), Anna (b. January 16, 1816).\n\n4. May12, 1801: Kaleb (birth date unknown)married Wibertha OBRIST nee Piers (born August 24, 1766) Child: Anna Barbara (b. December 1, 1803)\n\n5. March8, 1803: Jakob (b. October 8, 1775) ofRizen-Bub, Studen, married Anna Walt (born. May 11,1777)\n\n6. January13, 1807: Johannes (b. December 15,1781) of Jören-Hanses married Anna Haltiner. Children: Johann Jakob (b October 17, 1815), Johannes(b. June 27, 1820)\n\n7. November8, 1808: Johannes (b. June 22, 1788) ofKlosen-Ritzen-Bub, Hinterforst married Anna Katharina Dietrich. Children: Anna Barbara (b. May 25, 1809), Johann Jakob(b. September 13, 1812) and Anna Elisabeth (b. August 4, 1819).\n\n8. June27, 1809: Johannes (b. August 14, 1776)of Kloses, Härdli married Susanna Enzler. Childless.\n\n9. August31, 1812: Hans Jakob (b. March 27,1791), butcher from Süsswinkel married Anna Magdalena Dietrich. Children: Johann Ulrich (b. December 12, 1814), JohannJakob (b. December 7, 1816), Thomas (b. February 15, 1819), Kaleb (b. October4, 1820), Anna ( b. March 17, 1824), Samuel (b. February 14, 1826), Paulus (b.September 20, 1829), Johann Kaspar ( b. December 19, 1831), Heinrich (b. July12, 1836).\n\n10. August 8,1820: Johannes (b. September 29, 1797)of Klaebs, Au married Elisabeth Dietrich. Children: Johannes (b. December 7, 1820), Johann Jakob (b. November 16,1823), Niklaus (b. August 31, 1826), and Anna (b. November 20, 1830.)\n\nThis entries show that an Obrist family line beganto flourish in Eichberg about 150 years ago. There are approximately 7 Obristfamilies currently living in Eichberg proper, and an additional 25 living thesurrounding areas.\n\nCANTON GRAUBUNDEN\n\nUrmein bei Thusis: (Sources: Herr Pfr. E. Zuan and HBLS)\n\nThe municipality of Urmein was originally connectedin religious matters to the municipality of Flerden, although it had been“reformed” since 1526. In 1719,however, the resident of Urmein decided to build their own church and concludeda written contract for church construction. The baptismal registry of Flerden shows that the following people werebaptized on October 26, 1720: JohannesObrist, son of Johannes- this is the last entry for the Obrist family in thebaptismal registry of Flerden. Inaddition, Johannes Obrist is not mentioned in the written contracts for church constructionin Urmein listed above. Given thisevidence, Herr Pfr. Zuan maintains that the older Johannes came to Urmein latein 1719, or early in 1720. Thisconclusion is supported by the fact that the Priest in Urmein, atypically,recorded neither the name of the younger Johannes’ mother in the baptismalrecord nor the family’s place of origin. Herr Zuan holds that omissionmost likely resulted from the fact that the Obrists had moved to the area sorecently. The older Johannes wasapparently involved in the actually construction work for the Urmein church,and then settled in the Urmein/Flerden area. The origins of this part of the Obrist family remain, thus, unclear.\n\nUrmein became responsible for its own religiousmatters after church construction was finished in 1724. All entries on the Obrist family can befound in the church registers of the municipality of Urmein after thisdate. The younger Johannes Orist mentionedabove later married a daughter of the Liver family, which the HBLS calls one ofthe oldest and most respected “reformed” families in Flerden. Johannes and his wife welcomed their firstchild on January 15, 1751. In the yearsthat followed, the Obrist family proliferated in the area- about 70 yearsbefore publication of this examination; however, the Obrist family haddisappeared from Urmein. We assume,however, that at least a portion of the Obrist currently resident in the Churarea originally came from Urmein. TheObrist family members that migrated to the Sta Maria area came from Riniken andwill be mentioned in the section on the Aargau below.\n\nCANTON AARGAU\n\na)The Frick Valley (das Fricktal)\n\nResearch in this area has proven especiallydifficult because historical records for this area have been divided betweenarchives in Karlsruhe, Innsbruck and Vienna. Only a very small portion of the existing records has remained in thestate archives of the Aargau (Source: Dr. Karl Schib, History of the village of Möhlin, 1959). The compiler of this work was not able toaccess foreign records to supplement this work and, therefore, had to rely onmore recent records in the municipal and church records, and on the records ofbaptisms, marriages and deaths that date back through the 17th and18th centuries.\n\nHellikon:\n\n(Sources: Records of theJohanniter-Kommende of Rheinfelden and of the Deutschordenshauses in Altshausenby Dr. Emil Welti, 1933.)\n\nUlrich der oberst, miller,is listed as a witness to a trade contract from 1340. It is unclear, however, whether, “der oberst” is to be interpretedas a family name in this case. Hans zeObrest, together with Cuoni an der Zil, appears in 1390 as the owner andbuilder of the property “Hellinken.” The Obrist family line has not been represented in the Hellikon area formany years.\n\nMöhlin:\n\n(Source: Records of the St. Martin Foundation (StiftSt. Martin) in Rheinfelden, Dr. Emil Welti, 1935.)\n\nA Hans Oberst of Mehli (Möhlin) is listed as a taxdebtor in 1533 and in 1551. Hans Oberst of Mehli (the same?) had to appear incourt on a charge of abuse of hotel regulations, and was punished (Dr. KarlSchib, Geschichte des Dorfes Möhlin). The same source shows Hans Obrist (the son of Hans Obrest) as the judgein a trade contract case, and the heirs of Hans Obrist in Möhlin were named astax debtors to the hospital in Rheinfelden in 1589. The Obrist family line nolonger exists in Möhlin.\n\nLaufenberg:\n\n(Source: Records of the state archives of Laufenberg,Dr. K. Schib).\n\nCristhionen Oberstin islisted a witness to a testament in 1558. Ulin Obrist appears as a judge and witness in several trade contracts in1591, 1598, 1601 and 1609. JaglinOberst is listed as a tax debtor and landowner in 1666, and Ulin Obrist (adescendent of the Ulin Obrist mentioned above) appears as a judge and witnessin a number of contracts in 1680. Fridli Obrist of Hochsell, a “sworn witness from Hochsell,” presided asjudge over two contract cases on 1729. It can be assumed that theObrists resident in and around Hochsal (Baden- Würtemmburg) and near the Swissborder heralded from the Laufenburg area, although the Obrist family line is nolonger represented in Laufenburg.\n\nMumpf:\n\n(Source: Civil register).\n\nIn the 65 years between 1679(origin of the baptismal registry) and 1744, we have evidence of only oneObrist family- that of Joannes Oberst and Catharina Hurdi in lower Mumpf(Niedermumpf). Joannes and Catharinabaptized four sons (Martinus (1653), Richardus (1655), Joannes (1667), andLeonardus (1670), and two daughters. Richardus and Joannes were confirmed in Mumpf and listed asOberists. The family seems to havemigrated from Mumpf relatively soon afterwards, however, given that there areno further entries for the sons in either the marriage or death registers after1680. The origin of the father, JoannesObrist is also unknown. In addition,there is some doubt as to the reliability of these registers, as they were notheld in strict chronological order during these years.\n\nGansingen / Galten / Büren:\n\nGalten and Büren belong tothe municipality of Gansingen. In thepast, Galten church records were distributed among those of Gansingen and ofSulz - evidence of the Obrist family name is this area must, therefore, besought in the registers of both Sulz and Gansingen.\n\nWe find evidence of the first Obrist in Gansigen inconnection with the sale of one half of the Rheinsulz property in 1485. A. Senti writes in “Our Sulz Valley” (UnserSulztal) 1954: “The deal was closedbefore the court of Mettau. Witnesseswere called from the whole valley and neighborhood; among these witnesses werea Kleinfridlin Obrist and a Fridli Reinlin of Galten.” In the “State Archive records ofLaufenburg”, Dr. K. Schib uncovers a Hans Obrist, listed at the court inGansingen in 1611, and a Martin Obrist, listed as a guarantor for a loan of 100Gulden in Galten in the same year. In1619, Geörg and Heinrich Obrist are both listed as landowners in Büren. Thechurch registers from Gansingen date back to 1639. The first entry records the birth of Georgius Obrist, son ofHenrico Obrist and Anna Baltzin on September 14, 1639 (died as a smallchild). The following baptismal recordsfollow:\n\nHenricus OBRIST and Anna Baltzin: a second son Georgius on October 17, 1640, and a daughter, Anna, onAugust 31, 1648.\n\nHenricus OBRIST and Eva Deuberin: Elisabeth (April 1, 1641), Verena (December 26, 1642), Maria(November 1, 1644), Joannes (June 23, 1646), Fridolinus (December 31,1649), and Anna Maria (November 28, 1651).\n\nJoannes Fridolin OBRIST and Anna Vögelin: Anna (December 12, 1639), Fridolinus (January26, 1642), Joannes (March 1, 1645), Magdalena (December 8, 1649) andFridolinus (July 25, 1653).\n\nHans OBRIST and Anna Weissin (married on June 15, 1645): Verena (August 4, 1647), Fridolinus(September 22, 1649), Joannes Georgius (April 29, 1652), Anna (March 28,1655), and Martinus (September 23, 1656).\n\nFridolin OBRIST and Verena Erdin (married on October 29,1641): Verena (June 11, 1649),Joannes Melchoir (May 5, 1651), Anna (July 27, 1653) and Joannes Casparus(July 1, 1656).\n\nMartin OBRIST and Veronica Roll: Martinus (April 8, 1656.)\n\nThe names Anna, Joannes, Stephanus, Fridolin,Verena, Hans, Henricus, Magdalena, and Martinus OBRIST appear repeatedly asbaptismal witnesses. The registers alsorecord the following new marriages (in addition to the ones already listedabove): Georgius OBRIST married AnnaVögelin in January 1650 and Fridolin OBRIST married Elisabeth Deuberin onFebruary 25, 1659. Martinus OBRISTmarried Maria Forsterin on August 6, 1662. As shown above, the Obrist family spread heavily throughout the threeregions in the 17th century. The municipality of Gansingen listed 47 residents (from 685 total) withthe Obrist family name on July 24, 1964.\n\nLeibstadt / Hettenschwil / Leuggern:\n\nThe following entries are taken from a family treecreated by Mr. Hans Obrist, a businessman in Langenthal in 1892, and summarizedby Mr. Hermann J. Welti in 1937:\n\n“The Obrist family has spread abundantlythroughout the Frick Valley. The familyis mainly resident in Gansigen, Büren and Galten on the land previously ownedby the Roll zu Bernau AG. They are alsoresident, however, in Sulz, Wallbach and Möhlin and around the Hotzen Forest(Hotzenwald); Obrists in this area seem to have come originally from Laufenburg.”Records from Laufenburg show that a Joseph Obrist was a judge in Gansingen in1611. Another Joseph Obrist (bap.October 11, 1691, son of Remigius Obrist appears in 1717 in a marriage contractwith Anna Rettich from Leibstadt. Thecouple seems to have been married in Leuggern and settled in Leibstadt, wherethey had five sons and five daughters. The oldest son, baptized Joseph Obrist in 1717, married the widow VerenaWacker-Willi of the House of Schweden from Hettenschwil in 1760. Of Joseph’s four brothers, Jakob (b.1724),Meinrad(b.1728), Johannes (b.1730), and Ignaz (b.1732), the last three marriedand produced numerous descendants. Themajority of these descendants, now settled in Leuggern, are employed in theagricultural and forestry sectors- very few Obrists from this line seem to havesettled outside of this area.\n\nMagden:\n\n(Sources: Civil registry; Records of the municipalarchives of Rheinfelden, Dr. Emil Welti, 1933).\n\nMagden’s church was built in 1620; Magden’sbaptismal registry, however, begins in 1614, at which time there were already anumber of Obrists resident in the area. The records note the following baptisms:\n\nConradus OBRIST and Maria Ackermännin: Johannes (1614),Andreas (1629), and three additional daughters.\n\nLaurentius OBRIST and Maria Bitterelei: Joan (1623), Martinus (1624), Nicolaus(1627), Michael (1629), and two daughters.\n\nConradus OBRIST and Anna Haserlin ( married April 9,1624): Ursula ( 1624).\n\nIn the 24 years between 1682 and 1706, 22 childrenwere baptized with the Obrist family name (9 males and 13 females), from atotal of 8 couples. Aside from theunions listed above, we find evidence of the following marriages in the Magdenchurch records:\n\n1630: FridolinOBRIST and Maria Godlina Conradi\n\n1646: FridolinOBRIST and Maria (illegible)\n\n1693: MichaelOBRIST and Elisabetha Adlerin\n\n1695: JospehOBRIST and Maria Schneiderin\n\n1697: FridolinOBRIST and Elisabetha Stalderin\n\n1698: MartinusOBRIST and Maria Bürginin\n\nDr. Emil Welti’s “Records of the MunicipalArchives of Rheinfelden,” written in 1933, gives the following evidenceof the Obrist family:\n\nMarch 13, 1687: MichaelOBRIST appears as a judge over a trade contract\n\nJanuary 12, 1695: MichaelOBRIST is listed as a witness in a land consolidation contract\n\nFebruary 15, 1718: JosephOBRIST is a witness at the Magden Court for a deposit contract.\n\nUnfortunately, it is equally unsure in Magden wherethis line originated from, and the manner in which the name is Obrist iswritten varies widely.\n\nWallbach:\n\n(Source: Civil registry)\n\nThis municipality belonged to Mumpf until 1803 andonly became politically independent after the Canton itself was officiallyestablished. In church matters,however, Wallbach remained tied to Mumpf until 1928. The first civil registry of Wallbach, established at thebeginning of the 19th century, shows that the forefather of theWallbach Obrists migrated to the area from Galten/Gansingen. Joann OBRIST (b. February 19, 1760, married1786, d. 1839), had four sons: Johann(b. November 18, 1786, d. December 12, 1860), Jakob (July 28, 1789), Joseph(December 8, 1793), and Georg (b. October 5, 1800), as well as three additionaldaughters. In addition, another Obrist brother followed Joann from Galten,namely Joseph Obrist (born 1751, died 1814). He had two sons: Joseph OBRIST(b. March 11, 1784, produced no heirs) and Sebastian OBRIST (b. September 20,1788, married February 3, 1823 and had four daughters, but produced no maleheirs.) Joann Obrist (b. 1769) is viewed as the forefather of the Obrist linein Wallbach, although other Obrists surely migrated to the area during andafter this time. In 1967, of 1000 residents in Wallbach, 12 families (and thus32 people) carried the Obrist family name. The majority of these, like their ancestors, were employed as craftsmen;only two were involved in agricultural ventures.\n\nSulzbei Laufenburg:\n\n(Sources: Civil registry, “Our Sulztal”, 1954).\n\nThe church registry in the municipality of Sulzbegins in the year 1599. The listingsthat are of interest to us are as follows:\n\nJoannes OBRIST married Catharina Stägler in 1605, and theybaptized Salome (1609), Georgius (1611) and Joannes (1613).\n\nTheobaldus OBRIST from Leysacker, Sulz married Barbara Wäberin in1607, and they baptized Anna (1608) and Jacobus (1613).\n\nJoannes OBRIST from Obergalten (in the municipality of Gansingen)married Anna Merkhoferin in 1615 and they baptized Anna (1622) andFridolin (1624) in the church in Sulz.\n\nDuring these years, a Johannes and Verena OBRIST arelisted numerous times as baptismal witnesses; at Easter 1626 Hans, Elisabeth,Verena, Anna and Cathaerina OBRIST, all from Galten, were confirmed. All of the Obrists listed above originatedfrom the Leysacker area, raising the question of whether their forefathermigrated from Gansingen or from Galten?\n\nThe work “ Our Sulztal,” written in 1954, tells usthat the Obrist family line is one of the 11 old family lines that still existin the Sulz Valley. As an honor toFridolin, who supposedly founded the nunnery in Säckingen in 522, many childrenin the area were named Fridolin or Fridli. The Obrist family seems to have long played an important role in thedevelopment of the area, especially after the incorporation of the municipalityinto the new canton. Obrists seems tobe especially prevalent as teachers and local government officials.\n\nb)Bern Aargau right of the Aare River\n\nThe Obrist family seems to have originated inRupperswil, given that the topographical requirements for the consolidation ofseveral groups under one name were present in this area. The name then spread north to Aarau, southto Othmarsingen, and much later, could be found in the area left of the AareRiver, now in Brugg County. We findevidence of the following members of the Obrist family in the city archives ofAarau and of Lenzburg:\n\n1312: Brother Ruodolf andHeinrich Zobrost begin construct on property in Reinach.\n\n1419: Siblings Jenni, Uli,Elsa and Anna ze Obrest receive and divide an inheritance.\n\n1461: Heinin ZObristrepresents the members of the Church Council of Suhr in a dispute with themother Cloister in Aarau.\n\n1526: Werni ZObrist islisted as a land owner.\n\n1529: Heini Zober andHannss ZObrist are listed as tax debtors.\n\n1553: Jost and WerniZoberst take part in an action against the city of Aarau over problemswith a water canal.\n\n1556: Werni, Marty andPoley ZObrist (3 brothers) are involved in a dispute over a pasture. The brothers were supported in theiraction by 2 citizens from Othmarsingen. It seems probable that the Obrists of Rupperwil had blood ties orstrong friendships with many of citizens of Othmarsingen.\n\n1556: Marti Zoberst isnamed assistant surveyor.\n\n1561: Poley and HannssZobrest are members of the court.\n\n1586: Caspar Zobrest isnamed as a “beystand”\n\n1605: Caspar Zobrest andJoachim Zobrest represent the municipality of Rupperswil in a dispute withthe city of Lenzburg.\n\nHunzenschwil:\n\n1361: Heini zu Obrostbuilds on his land.\n\n1385: same for Uli zuObrost.\n\nAarau:\n\n1501: Johannis Obrest is achaplain at the village chruch in Aarau.\n\n1510: “her Hanns Zoberistcaplan” ( Mr. Hanns Zoberist, chaplain) inherits land in Küttigen.\n\n1525: Ruodolf ZObrist,resident, citizen and member of the Council of the City of Arow (Aarau) isinvolved in a dispute\n\n1527: Fridli Zoberist is ajudge\n\n1536: Heini ZObrist owns“bündten”\n\n1544: The children ofRuodolf ZObrist must pay land taxes\n\nSuhr:\n\n1522: Fridli ZObrist,resident of Sur (Suhr) buys land\n\nLenzburg:\n\n1587: Ulin Zoberistinherits a hammersmith shop and business.\n\nHendschiken:\n\n1602: Ruodolf Zobrest is ajudicial aide.\n\nBuchs:\n\n1600: Ulrich Zibrest takespart in a dispute with the city of Aarau.\n\nOthmarsingen:\n\n1490: Uli Obrest/Zoberest\n\n(Source: taxregister of Königsfelden in 1490) (“her Hanns Zoberist” and the ChaplainJohannis Obrest listed under Aarau are undoubtedly the same person.)\n\nc)Left of the Aare River\n\nThe first carriers of the Obrist family name in thisarea are as follows:\n\nSchniznach:\n\n1414: “Bertschi Zobrest and Ruedi ZObrist” areboth listed as members of the court in Schniznach. (Source: Records of the City Archives of Brugg, Dr.G. Boner)\n\nRiniken:\n\n1514: “Hanns Zoberrist and Urs Hirt paid 5 ( somemeasure) seed and 30 eggs.” (Excerptform the tax register of the village church in St. Niclausen in Brugg, listedin “M. Hannss Stapfer’s Tax Registry in the territory of Schneckenburg”,written in 1514. Hans Stapfer was a laypriest in Baden and started a grant fund for the church in Brugg, based on theincome collected on land taxes in Schneckenbuerg. Hanns Zoberrist was listed, among others, as land tax debtors.\n\n1555: “Hanns Oberrist gives 5 (some measure) ofgrain, one hen and 25 eggs to Jans.”, “Hanns Zoberrist receives 3 ( somemeasure) of grain, 1 rooster ( perhaps?) and 25 eggs from Jans.”\n\nBothof the entries listed above can be found in the budget register of MeisterHanns Stäbely for the years 1555-1560. We assume he was a tax collector for the village church of St. Niclausenin Brugg.\n\nAsis evident from the entries listed above, ZObrist and Obrist seem to have beenused interchangeably in Riniken, and the use of the family name spreadsimultaneously under both spellings. Hanns Zoberrist is, however, the same person as Hannss Oberrist. Zoberist is used in the Stäblis book entriesuntil 1560; after this point however, only Oberist or Oberst are used.\n\nItis still unclear when the first OBRIST arrived in Riniken. Given that the taxregister of Königsfeld lists no Obrist in 1490, and that the first evidence ofthe Obrist family comes with the register of Hanns Stapfer in 1514, we assumethat the migration of the Obrist family to the area occurred around the turn ofthe 16th century.\n\nAglass window was created sometime between 1560-1565, which according to the Zürcher Tagesanzeiger is now in theprovincial museum in Innsbruck, shows the Stilli Court at Schneckenburg andlists a Hans Oberst as one of the members. We must assume that this Hans Oberst was the only son of the HannsOberrist / Zoberrist listed above. The Obristfamily seems, therefore, to have risen fairly quickly to a position of authorityand good repute in the area. The first Obrists listed in the population recordsof Königsfeld, Schneckenberg, and Leuggern, as well in the “records of themunicipal archives of the city if Brugg” and in the baptismal, marriage naddeath records of the church in Umiken are shown in chronological order below:We use the following abbreviations:\n\n· Kf.U. Königsfeld Population Records\n\n· Sch.U.: Scheckenberg Population Records\n\n· Leugg: Leuggern Population Records\n\n· Eff.G.: Effing Population Records\n\n· Urk.B.: City Archive Records of Brugg\n\n· Rod.U. Umiken Church Records\n\n· Kf.U. In 1536, still no mention of theObrist family\n\n· Urk.B.: Hans Oberist is named a land ownerof a piece of rented land in Überthal in 1583.\n\n· Kf.U.: Hanns Oberist is mentioned twice as a taxcollector, which stands as evidence that he was a respected member of thecommunity at this time.\n\nThereare a total of eight fiefdoms that belong to residents of Riniken, two of whichbelonged to Hans Jacob and three to Jacob Obrist:\n\n3.Fief: “Jacob Obrist owes annual taxes to theCloister at Königsfelden.” (list of goods used to pay taxes follows, but is inSwiss German dialect and difficult to translate. Among the goods, however, seem to be chickens, grain, eggs andsome money)\n\n4.Fief: “Jacob Obrist owes further taxes to theCloister Königsfelden.” (samedifficulty in translation)\n\n5.Fief: same\n\n6.Fief: “Hanns Jacob Obrist owes taxes to theCloister at Königfelden.”\n\n7.Fief: same\n\nAccordingto the entries in Hannss Stapfers “Pfrund, Zins und Gülten in the SchneckenbergTerritory” (1514-1612) “Jacob Oberst” owed taxes in the form of “five (somemeasure) grain and 30 eggs” for a property that had been previously owned bythe Caspar Sutor of Ryniken. It is also obvious in the entry about the fifth fiefdomthat, in 1585, the property had only recently come in to the hands of theOberst family. It seems to point to the fact that the OBRIST family wasbecoming more affluent and could afford larger amounts of property, rather thanto support the proposition that the old property had become too small for theOBRIST family.\n\n1.) Urk.B. 1592: HansOberist owns a guesthouse and restaurant in Remigen. & 1598: Hans Oberist is the guarantor on a loan of50 Gulden from the administrative council of Brugg at an interest rate of 2.5Gulden/year.\n\n2.) Leugg. 1598: Hansand Jagli Oberist are land owners\n\n3.) Kf.U. 1598: HannsOberist, Jeremias Geissberger, and Jacob Läder sign for the municipality ofRiniken in a land exchange contract.\n\n4.) Urk.B. 1604: JagliOberist appears as the main loan debtor on a capital loan of 1000 Gulden.\n\n5.) Eff.G. 1605: HannsOberist and Jacob Oberist, his brother, are landowners and tax debtors. By 1652, we have evidence that these two,and many of their family members, owned many land parcels: Jacob Obrist, Heini OBRIST, Hans, Jagli,Jagli the young, Hans Schaffner, Hans Huser, Caspar Wülser, Jagli Schaffner,Hans Läder, and Rudi Märki are all sons-in-law of Hanns and Jacob Oberist.\n\n6.) Hansand Rudi OBRIST seem to have owned land that still belonged to Uli Schaffner in1605 and the owner of Hans Oberist’s property was Hans Geissberger in1605. Hans and Jacob OBRIST are listedrepeatedly as land owners in both the Schneckenberg records of 1605, and thoseof Königsfeld from 1614.\n\n7.) Urk.B. 1615: Jagli Oberst of Ryniken appears as the guarantor for repayment oftaxes on a piece of property in the amount of 550 Gulden. The main debtors seem to have been “Hans andHeinrich, brothers.” In 1649: ConradOBRIST of Riniken, debtor, and Heini OBRIST, guarantor, both appear on a loancontract for a piece of land in the amount of 150 Guldens. Heini OBRIST is listed as the owner of theproperty.\n\n8.) Sch.U. 1605: Theserecords seemed to have been changed in 1652. Old, incorrect information seems to have simply been corrected bystriking out invalid entries and in 1652: anObrist is a member of the city council, and a number of Obrists appear as landowners at this time (no first names are mentioned). Heini, Hans Jagli theyoung, Hans and Hans Jungli, Heini, Hans Jagli ( the son of Heini), Hans andRudi, Hans the tailor, Heini and Jagli are all listed as land owners.\n\n9.) Urk.B. 1662: HansJagli is the primary debtor, and Hans the young is listed as a guarantor on aland loan of 200 Gulden. Heini, Jagli,the heirs of Heini OBRIST, and Hans the tailor are all listed as landowners. And in 1665:\n\n10.) HansOberist of Riniken appears as a joint guarantor on a debt created by brothersHans and Rudin Schaffner. Although it is not clear whether they actually ownland, Jagli, Hans the young, Heinrich der Sattler, Hans the tailor, the heirsof Heini Oberest and Rudi are also mentioned in this text. In 1687: “The state of Baden in the Aargau mustimpose land taxes for the territory of Schneckenberg. In Riniken: Conrd Heiniand H. Jagli OBRIST must pay yearly taxes.\n\nAccordingto the church records of the town of Riniken, “Hanns Oberist juvenus” baptizeda son Jacob in 1599. “Hans Oberist theyounger” was the baptismal witness. Jacob Oberist and Anna Seeberger baptized a daughter Anna one year laterand Hans Jacob Oberist is the baptismal witness. In this same year, Hans Oberist and Verena Schmidlin baptized adaughter Elizabeth.\n\nUntilthe middle of the 16th century, Hans OBRIST (the descendant of HansOBRIST) and his family seem to have been the only OBRIST family line inRiniken, which made it easier for him to amass a relatively large land andmonetary fortune in a short time. Thenumber of Obrists in the town of Riniken increased drastically after 1600. We can tell from the baptismal records ofthe church in Umiken that there were three couples that bore children with theObrist family name in Riniken around 1600. Sometime later, we find evidence of six couples.\n\nDueto the fact that the Obrist family multiplied exponentially in a relativelyshort time, and because the church records in Riniken were unreliably kept atthis time, as well as due to the repetition of names, it is practicallyimpossible to truly trace all Obrist family lines back to their roots. Until the year 1650, in addition, the onlytwo male first names listed were Hans and Jacob, or a combination of the two(Hans Jacob.) Only after this time didnew first names appear in the genealogy.\n\nProliferationof the Obrist family necessarily brought with it further divisions in theoriginal land holdings of the Obrist family forefathers. It also forced the adoption of a system bywhich the heirs who did not inherit land were compensated with cash. This tradition was not always upheld, due atone point, for example, to the population decimation as a result of the plagueof 1668. The register of the deceased for this year mentions:\n\n“Theplague continues. 230 residents fromthe municipalities of Umiken, Villnachern and Riniken died and were buried inthe year 1668.”\n\nThenumber of dead reported in the death register represents at least one-half, ifnot one-third of the total population in this area. The population did begin to increase, however, soon after theplague withdrew. After this time, thenumber of Obrists in Riniken increased, as did the number of Obrist heirsdenied their right to land. ManyObrists began to seek jobs as day laborers and craftsmen, and some encounteredreal difficulties in providing for their families. This topic will also be further explored under the heading“Dättwil bei Baden”.\n\nThepopulation of this area in 1824 was approximately 330 residents; about one half( 165) of these were men, approximately 80 of whom were old enough to serve inthe military or fire brigades. Of these80 men, 34 took part in the fire brigade and 19 (more than half) were membersof the Obrist family. The fire brigaderoll read as follows:\n\nFirerunners:\n\n1.

JakobObrist\n\nAround1800, we see that Obrist family members were often differentiated by additionalnames. Among these names were: Caspars, Casperlis, Zogis, Büblis, Dotzlis,Heinibuben, Hansjacoben, Hofjacobs, Tobiasen, etc. By 1830, Stumpfweber, Obal, Leders, Müggis, Funkels, Heichels,Tschuppisbauren, Oppels, Hofheiris, Heichelheiris, Schniders, ab dem Hof,Küfers, Kasparruedis, Schniderruedis could also be included in this list.\n\nd.)Migration of the Obrists from Riniken\n\nPopulationgrowth exerted as large amount of pressure on the municipal government ofSchneckenberg, as it did in many other areas. In 1657, there were 17 fireplaces (hearths) registered in Riniken,amounting to approximately 70 residents. This number had tripled by 1764, andRiniken’s population was 213 residents. In the 39 years between 1764 and 1803, the number of Riniken residentsonce more increased by about 50%, reaching a level five times that of the 1657population count. There were similarpopulation explosions in Elfingen, Gallenkirch, Umiken and Kauffohr.\n\nRiniken’seconomy was very dependent on agricultural production, and in 1764 hadapproximately one hectare of land for every resident (excluding the surroundingforests), which meant that there were approximately 4 hectares of land per familyin Riniken at this time. This figurebarely reaches the lower limit for modern standards regarding the landsubsistence level for rural families dependent on agricultural production. The amount of the produce this land wouldyield today, however, is far more than the same figure for 1764. At the time, the average family simply couldnot live off of what they produced on this amount of land.\n\nAdditionalplots to supplement family income were given out sparingly from the municipalgovernment. The method of agriculturalproduction employed at this time was the same one that had been used forcenturies and could not be intensified by this point. It was not until the second half of the eighteenth century thatthe average farmer began to think in new ways about farming, and thus that realchanges came about in methods of agricultural production.\n\nTheactual agricultural profit that the average family could reap from theirallotted land was further decreased by the repeated division of land holdingsthat lay outside of the center and that were small, among an increasing numberof heirs. It is no surprise, inaddition, that the land quickly became fallow due to overuse, which gave riseto increased migration to other villages, cities and provinces in search ofland to farm and to provide for their families. This trend is mirrored in the migration movements of Rinikenresidents; in the following sections, we examine the main areas to which theObrist family branches in Riniken migrated.\n\nDÄTTWIL BEI BADEN: (VARIEDSOURCES)\n\nThemain figure in the passages that follow is Hans Jakob OBRIST, who was born in1700. He was the owner of a farm andhouse on Remiger Street in Riniken, built on a 52 section piece of landproperty, which had been divided between Hans Jakob and his threebrothers. One of brothers was married,and the other two were single. Becausethe land was too small to provide for 4 families, Hans Jakob Obrist. first leaseda large farm and house in Dättwil bei Baden in 1740, and later bought it: Thearea known as Dättwil consisted at the time of 4 farm areas:\n\n1.) Theoldest area was named Dättewilhof, which enjoyed certain specialprivileges. It was also known as theMeyerhof because the Austrian ambassador had a house there until 1415, whenAustria withdrew its presence from the area. Henrich Truchsees of Wolhusen apparently owned the property in 1508,although he later sold the property to the Baden Hospital. Soon after this, the property once morechanged hands and was sold to the noble von Schnorf family from Baden. It was not until 1741 that Hans JakobOberist of Riniken took over the property. The Hof Hofstetten, which belonged to what is now known as Hof Dättwil,was transferred from Hans Jakob’s descendants to Major Renold from Dättwil in 1889(Renold also owned the Hof Hochstrass at the time.) The owners of the Dättwil and Hofstetten properties had, for sometime, had a contract with the city, by virtue of which they received wood forconstruction and for firewood. Thiscontract was a subject of much debate at the time, and would remain so untilMarch 13, 1912, when a judgment by the Federal Court required the City of Badento repay farmers in the amount of 35,000 Francs for back payments. 22 parties benefited from the decisions,including 9 Renolds, 5 Obrists and other individuals.\n\n2.) TheHofstetten property, which was situated to the north of the Dättwil property(also known as Unterhof) is no longer considered a property of its ownright. This land, along with theDättwil property, belonged to the von Schnorf family during the first half ofthe 18th century, and was transferred to the ownership of Hans JakobO, in 1741. Melchoir OBRIST inheritedthis land in 1827 and the buildings on the property were renovated. Major Renold, as mentioned above, tookcontrol of the land in 1889. Includedin the deal was a building that was designated as a “play house”, and which wasknown to the townspeople as “s’höch Haus” or the “Schlössli (the littlecastle).” The building, which had beenempty for several decades, was sought after by the city of Aargau in the 1950s,but then was gradually demolished in the construction for the newNationalstrasse in October 1966. TheHistorical Preservation Association attempted to protect and save the building,but their attempts failed.\n\nWewill not deal with the other two properties that made up the Dättwil complex,Hochstrass (still standing) and Säglen (disappeared). All four of these properties, along with Rütihof, Münzlishausenand the Eschenbach lands, were joined in 1803 to form the consolidatedpolitical municipality of Dättwil. This area was eventually incorporated intothe larger city of Baden. Up until1804, the Dättwil property was still inhabited by a total of 11 families- 8Obrist families (who had their rights through the city of Riniken) and 3 Renoldfamilies ( rights holders in the city of Brunegg.) Two Obrist brothers, Rudolf and Jakob, lived on the Rütihofproperty.\n\nTheoutbreak of the second Villmerger War seems to have been quite detrimental tothe financial situation of the von Schnorf family. When the city of Baden decided it was not interested in buyingeither the Dättwil or the Hofstetten properties, the family first had to rent,and then later to sell, both properties to the city of Bern. Presumably with the help of officials fromBern, and at a price of 15,000 Gulden, however, the family was allowed toretain the title to the land, although legal responsibility was transferred toa Steinegger from Rupperswil. Overtime, the lands were divided and leased to individual farmers; it is this waythat Hans Jakob Obrist from Riniken first gained access to the land in1740. It is unclear whether Steineggereventually gave up his rights to the land, or was pushed off of the land by thecity of Bern; that his control ended, however, is clear, and Jakob Oberistbought both properties at the beginning of 1741 for 9090 Gulden. With ownership of the land came all of thespiritual and bureaucratic duties to his tenant farmers. Jakob Obrist was soon absolved of theseduties, when the city of Bern commuted the original sale price, and requiredthe Obrists to pay off the land in 1000 Gulden yearly installments at a 5%interest rate. Both of the propertieswere listed as collateral for the loan and are described as follows in the loancontract:\n\n· Dättwil: Residence with 2 gardens, one large barnwith stalls, horse farm and 2 beautiful fountains. Behind the house is a large orchard, with at least 6 types offruit-bearing trees.\n\n· Hofstetten:Farm house with garden, shed and stalls, opposite of this a fish pond. Included in this property is a contract withthe city of Baden for free delivery of wood for building and burning.\n\nInexchange for the loan of 9090 Gulden, Hans Jakob Oberist and his three brothersConrad, Hans Heinrich and Caspar Oberist also had to use their collectedproperty in Riniken as collateral. (note: Although the contract speaks of the three sons of Hans JakobOBRIST, Hans Jakob’s partners must have been his brothers. Hans Jakob (b. 1700) did not marry until1740, while his brother Conrad married in 1731. We also know that Hans Heinrich was confirmed in 1727, and wouldhave been approximately 30 years old in 1740. Hans Jakob brought his brothers Conrad and Jakob, as well as a sisterAnna with him when he moved to Dättwil.)\n\nAswe are already aware, fate would not be kind to either Conrad or to Jakob. A widowed farmer and former school teacher,Rudolf Renold, migrated to Dättwil from Bruegg concurrent with the sale of thefarm in 1740. The Obrist and Renold families were joined soon after inmarriage, and due to rapidity with which the two families multiplied, thequestion of religious responsibility in this community soon arose. There seem to have been members of thereformed church already present in the area from 1715, as evidenced by the factthat the municipal government decided in that year that residents of Dättwilwould be connected religiously to Baden, while those of Hofstetten would beconnected to Gebesdorf. Following thisdecree, all Obrists and Renold were baptized, confirmed, married and buried inGebesdorf until the great religious transformation. After this time, the entiremunicipality of Dättwil was associated with Baden in all matters of religion,although the area remained an independent and strong reformed enclave within amajority Catholic region.\n\nFreedomof movement and of belief were guaranteed with the Aargau Peace, which wasaccepted on August 11, 1712. As aresult, an independent reformed church was built in Baden and was dedicated in1714. It seems as though the officialsin Zürich and in Bern supported the growth and protection of the reformedchurch in Baden at this time. Thisposition, however, did not truly flourish for some time, and for many years,the only reformed families in Baden were those of the priest, the historian andthe judge. The cities of Zürich andBern inherited, however, a house from the von Schnorf family in 1740, whichthey reserved as a parish church.\n\nUntil1740, the reformed church in this area was limited in its competence tomarrying members of the Reformed community, and the permission to develop atrue Reformed church parish was effectively denied until enough reformed churchmembers migrated to this area and demanded religious representation. The first civil law-related activity of thereformed church was in 1740, when Conrad Obrist was baptized by the ReformedChurch. We can assume that themigration of reformed church members to Baden was fully supported by the governmentsof Bern and Zürich and began shortly after the Aargau Peace of 1712.\n\nTheheirs of the Dättwil and Hofstetten properties seem to have left Rinikenpermanently, primarily due to the exponential population increase and thesubsistence shortages that came with it. Hans Jakob Obrist, an ancestor of the author of this work, was baptizedin Umiken in November 1700. He marriedAnna Schaffner of Riniken ( bap. September 15, 1700) on January 15, 1740 in Umiken. Hans Jakob died on April 16, 1741 and Anna died on January 15,1760. His son, Caspar, was baptized onApril 16, 1741 in Umiken and married Barbara Schälchli on June 13, 1798, bywhose hand he would be murdered on October 18, 1805.\n\nWeknow the following about Hans Jakob’s siblings: Conrad married Catharina Märki of Mandach on February 9, 1731;their two daughters died as small children. Conrad died at the age of 42 on September 10, 1744 after falling from atree. He had lived out his days on theDättwil property. Caspar Obristbaptized a son Jakob on August 6, 1752 and lived on the Hofstettenproperty. Jakob Oberist marriedElisabeth Schaffner of Riniken and the couple baptized a son Emanuel onFebruary 9, 1742. “The father wasburied in the same hour as the son was baptized.” Elisabeth Schaffner eventually remarried, this time with RedolfRenold, who had migrated to Dättwil with a son Heinrich and a daughter AnnaMaria. They were married in thereformed church of Baden. Hans JakobOberist’s sister Anna married Heinrich Renold, the son of the Rudolf Renoldmentioned above. It is not clearwhether Hans Jakob’s brother, Hans Heinrich, actually lived in Dättwil, or(which is more probable) remained in Riniken and assumed responsibility for theland Hans Jakob had left behind.\n\nThecivil affairs registry of the Reformed Church in Baden was not complete at thetime; deaths, for example, were not recorded at all. In addition, there were a very limited number of first names inuse at the time, and thus the same entries seem to be repeated multiple times. It is difficult to compose a trustworthyfamily tree based on the information contained in this register- the same canbe said for the civil registry of Umiken. It is certain, however, that Jakob Oberist, the grandfather of theauthor of this piece, lived for a time in Dättwil with his wife and thenmigrated to Windisch. A similar patterncan be assumed for many other families at this time, due to the populationgrowth in Dättwil and accompanying shortage of resources.\n\nWe do know for certain that the Obrists ofDättwil spread to, and settled in, many different areas; due to the researchdifficulties listed above, in addition, it is difficult to establish a directand sure connection between many of the Riniken and Dättwil Obrist familybranches. In the first few decadesafter their move to Dättwil, Obrist men, in the interest of upholding oldconnections and for religious reasons, primarily sent for their brides fromRiniken. Many families, in fact, still holdvoting rights in Riniken to this day.\n\nInthis interest of furthering research efforts on the Dättwil branch of theObrist family tree, I have listed below all of the information on the Obristfamilies contained in the church records books for the Reformed Church ofBaden:\n\n“Register of Baptism and ofthe Deceased for the Reformed Church of the newly built Chruch of Baden in theAare Valley, 1714.”\n\nBaptisms:\n\n·Conrad Obirst (born in Riniken), the sonof a farmer on the Dättwil property and Catharina Marky of Mandach baptized adaughter Anna Maria on September 11, 1740, in the presence of two baptismalwitnesses from Riniken. The child diedon September 30, 1740?\n\no A daughter Anna was baptizedon January 14, 1742, but died on October 10, 1745.\n\n·Jacob Obrist, farmer on the Dättwilproperty but originally from Riniken, and Elisabeth Schaffner of Rinikenbaptized a son Emanuel on February 9, 1742. “ The father was buried in the samehour that the child was born.”\n\n·Johannes Obrist, resident on the Dättwil property, baptized a daughter Elisabethon April 9, 1747 ( d. April 7, 1748), a son Heinrich on February 9, 1749(married Verena Sibli in December 4, 1778), a daughter Regula on February 2,1755 and a son Johannes on August 14, 1757 (who married in 1779 and moved toRiniken.) The name of the mother ofthese children is unknown.\n\nMarriages:\n\na)Dättwil property\n\n· January19, 1755: Heinrich OBRIST married AnnaHollinger of Seeengen\n\n· February9, 1766: Hans Ulrich OBRIST marriedSusanna Hochstrasser of Fahrwangen\n\n· December4, 1778: Heinirch OBRIST married VerenaSibli ( Schibli)\n\n· March22, 1790: Jacob OBRIST married ?\n\nb) Hofstetten property\n\nBecause Hofstetten was connected in all religiousmatters to Gebesdorf, all baptisms are recorded only summarily in the Badenrecords, and no marriages or deaths are recorded. The Baden records show that the following Oberists were baptizedin Gebesdorf\n\n· April17, 1746: Johann Friedrich of Riniken\n\n· August16, 1750: Hans Jakob OBRIST pof Riniken(married January 3, 1780, d. January 4, 1836). Had one son named Melchoir (b. November 4, 1781, married October 14,1802, d. May 4, 1851).\n\n· August6, 1752: Jakob OBRIST of Riniken.\n\n· November25, 1753: Caspar OBRIST\n\nb)Rütihof\n\n· November1774: Hans Jakob OBRIST of Rinikenmarried Barbara Müllhaupt\n\n· 1780: HeinrichOBRIST married Barbara Bertschi v. Dürrenäsch\n\n· February27, 1784: Rudolf OBRIST marriedmargaretha Meyer\n\n· April14, 1788: Rudolf OBRIST married ?\n\nWefind evidence of a number of other Obrist family members in the civil registryof Dättwil, which has been preserved by the state of Baden. The oldest of these was born on April 17,1746; the connections between these Obrists and the ones mentioned above,however, is difficult to pinpoint. Obrists form Dättwil settled in many of the surrounding areas. Heinrich OBRIST (b. September 17, 1835), forexample, settled in Würenlos with his wife form Oetwil (they had four sons andfive daughters). Andrea OBRIST (b.December 11, 1757) moved in October 1817 with his wife, daughter, and marriedsons Jakob ( b. February 14, 1790) and Friedrich (b. August 24,1794) to theSchönenberg property in the mountain municipality of Dietikon. The family later bought the propertyoutright.\n\nThereis a relatively large number of Obrists in Rein-Rüfenach, one of theneighboring villages of Riniken. Thefirst Obrist to come to this area was Abraham OBRIST, born on March 18,1781. He settled in Rein, which wasthen an independent municipality, and married Elisabeth Suter (b. 1784). The couple had four sons and four daughters:\n\n1.) Kasper(born. October 13,1805) Elisabeth (b.September 23, 1814)- died young\n\n2.) Barbara(September 20, 1807) Abraham ( December20, 1816)\n\n3.) Anna(February 27, 1809) Hans Jakob ( June 8, 1819)\n\n4.) Heinrich(October 20, 1811) Elisabeth ( September 11, 1822)\n\nAccordingto an oral communication with the historian Obrist of the Rein-Rüfenachmunicipality on February 2, 1965, all Obrists in Rein-Rüfnach are descendentsof this Abraham. An Obrist must havebeen draw to the wheat mills in Brugg. This ancestor had two sons, both referred to by the last name ofBrunnenmüller:\n\n1.) Heinrich: born on April 23, 1824, and married AnnaHorlacher of Umiken in 1850.\n\n2.) Johannes: born on October 27, 1821, married MarieFricker (b. March 25, 1825) of Altenburg on March 24, 1846. Joahnens had to give up his voting rights inRiniken because of this marriage with an outsider.\n\nHeinrchOBRIST had one son. Heinrich (born October 9, 1852 in a suburb of Brugg.) Married on January 27, 1882 and died onJanuary 19, 1937. One of his sons,Hermann, was a banker and classmate of the author of this piece. Also a HansJakob OBRIST, ( b. January 17, 1788) of Riniken settled in Villnachern. He had six sons:\n\n1.) HansJakob b. April 18, 1823 – diedyoung\n\n2.) Kaspar b. March 5, 1827\n\n3.) Joahnnes b. January 19, 1834 – migrated\n\n4.) JansJakob b. May 15, 1836\n\n5.) Melchoir b. July 11, 1838\n\n6.) Daniel b. November 25, 1840\n\nThelast three children were baptized in Uerkheim, and we can assume that thefamily had migrated there permanently.\n\nTherecords seem to show that Johannes O. ( b. November 3, 1782) migrated to “aufKappelerhof,” near Baden, alone. Weknow that he came from Riniken and married Susanna Wueest from Birrhard onOctober 10, 1784. Susanna died onAugust 16, 1852; Johannes in June 18, 1853. The couple left behind, however, a large family and numerous heirs:\n\nAbraham (b. January 21, 1807) Jakob ( b.January 20, 1818)\n\nJohannes (b. January 16, 1811- died young) Hans Jakob ( b. November 5, 1821)\n\nSamuel ( b. September 26, 1813) Lisabeth( b. April 14, 1824)\n\nAnna Maria ( b. January 28, 1816) Johannes( b. September 15, 1832).\n\nTherecords hold no specific information about any of these descendants. A HansJakob Obrist. (born April 18, 1823) settled in Rupperswil, where he wasemployed as a train station attendant and married Anna Berner on October 4,1866. He died on November 20, 1886,leaving behind three sons:\n\nJohann Jakob (b. June 23, 1867)\n\nAlbert (b. September 22, 1868)\n\nHermann (b. May 23, 1871)\n\nAnotherHans Jakob Obrist ( b. May 15, 1836) also lived in Rupperswil. His son was Jakob (born September 10,1870). A Kaspar Obrist. ( b. November6, 1847), his son, Hans Emil ( b. April 17, 1878), and an Ernst Karl Obrist. (machine technician, b. July 21, 1889, married July 24, 1913, d. April 11, 1932)were also resident in Rupperswil. ErnstKarl Obrist. had a daughter Heidi (born September 21, 1919), who was married atthe time of publication to a Zimmerman, a teacher in Beinwil a. S.\n\nAHermann Obrist, (brakeman, born July 31, 1872, married May 18, 1899, diedOctober 17, 1943.), is listed as a “resident of Aarau since 1942.”\n\nFinally,we find evidence of Conrad Obrist. (originally from Riniken) in Safenwil, wherehe worked as a shepherd. He died onDecember 17, 1840 and left behind four sons:\n\nJakob (born June 28, 1795)\n\nFranz (born July 17, 1796)\n\nJohann (December 1, 1799)\n\nConrad (November 1811)\n\nAllof these sons were born in Koelliken. All that we know of their father Conrad is that, in 1790, he still paidhis citizens taxes (3 Batzen, 3 Kreuzer) to the municipality ofRiniken. He died in 1819 in the Kantonhospital, which was located in Koenigfelden at the time. The records show no additional informationabout any of Conrad’s four sons.\n\nJohannesO. (b. February 22, 1761) and Elisabeth Keller, who were married on February18, 1785, lived on the Roethlerhof in Ormalingen BL. The couple had five daughters and three sons ( all of whom wouldlater marry people from Baselland). Thethree sons were Caspar ( b. September 16, 1792), Heinrich ( b. January 21,1798) and Hans Jakob ( b. November 2, 1806). Their father Johannes worked as an agent for the municipality of Rinikenduring the Helvetik period (1798-1803). It seems that none of the citizens of Riniken wanted.\n\nHebitterly turned back to the Röthlerhof after five years of work in France. We have no further evidence of his activitiesin the Riniken area, except that he signed many of the reparation contractsbetween Riniken. and the French Occupation Army. This branch of the Obrist family seems to have been fullyseparated from their home municipality. Of the three sons, two gave up their voting rights in Riniken and thethird migrated “accompanied by his wife and all of his children,” toAmerica. The date and place of death ofthe father Obrist is unknown. Other Obrists in the Baselland Kanton included:\n\n1.) DanielOBRIST (born. July 3, 1780 in Baselaugst). Married Susanna Amseler of Augst. Died October 17, 1827. His son,Daniel, was born on June 13, 1803 and died in 1809.\n\n2.) JakobOBRIST (born. September 30, 1798) in Hofhansheiris. Married Maria Oberer of Sissach. Had 2 sons and three daughters, The family migrated to America in 1833.\n\n3.) PeterOBRIST (born. May 31, 1801) inHofhanheiris and was Jakob’s brother. Married Barbara Haas of Waldenburg in 1826. Had four daughter and one son, Peter Emil (b. February 20, 1839.)\n\n4.) HeinrichOBRIST (born. February 25, 1770) in Hansjaoggen. Married Susanna Wüest of Birrhard. The marriage ended on divorce. Heinrich died in Burgfelden in 1840 under uncertain circumstances. Children:\n\n5.) Peter:born. September 24,1799\n\n6.) Jakob(born. May 28, 1804) in Kaiseraugst.

March 2, 1894, d. 1964 in Liestal.\n\nDanielOBRIST (born. November 27, 1837) had three sons and two daughters. One of these sons was Robert (born August 8,1869) and was a telegraph operator. Hemarried on May 1, 1897 in Zürich and died on March 27, 1953 in Langenthal. In addition to one daughter, Robert also hadtwo sons:\n\n1.) Hans(born August 6, 1899) and married in Bern\n\n2.) Werner(born December 21, 1901), doctor in Langenthal, single.\n\nOneof Robert’s brothers migrated to Augustusburg bei Chemnitz (theRussian-occupied zone of Germany) and started a biscuit factory there. His two sons have apparently now settled inZürich. Robert’s other brother, Alfred,died without producing any heirs. Heinrich OBRIST ( b. August 9, 1854), type setter. Married Nanette Reber on November 15, 1884in Neuenburg. The couple had twodaughters and four sons:\n\n1.) HenriAlfred: (b.

Married AnnaBrehm of Lupfig on September 23, 1853. They had six sons, one of whom (Samuael OBRIST b. April 14, 1862)migrated to Wales. Samuel married thereon November 17, 1888 and died on April 7, 1948 in Zug. The civil registry records that he “ livedin Ste Croix, was a citizen of Cernier.” Samuael OBRIST had one son, Karl Albert (b. December 10, 1892), a bankerin Paris and three daughters. All ofthe children were born in Ste Croix. All male heirs of the line seem to have died out.\n\nRudolfOBRIST (b. April 5, 1778) had five sonsand four daughters. One of these sons,Johann (b. 1812) migrated to Puschlav, where he attempted to harvest tobacco(some years earlier, a Samuel Weber had also attempted this in Waadtland, andhe later established the tobacco industry in the Aargau.) Johann intended to create tobacco farming asa mode of work for those in Riniken and to make Riniken the seat, or a maincenter, of tobacco production. LikeWeber did in his early attempts, however, Johann also failed to establishhimself in tobacco farming. After thisfailure, Johann was invited by a friend, Madlain, to Sta Maria in the MünsterValley, where both men tried once again to establish themselves in the tobaccoindustry. After another failed venture,Johann opened a store in the village, and later took over the guest house “PizUmbrail,” which remained in the family until 1920. The property was sold at this time because no one in the familywas willing to continue to maintain it.\n\nOneof these ancestors, Georg Obrist, (who was a parish minister and to whom I amgreatly indebted for his help on this project), married Martina Maurizio (whosegrandfather was Gian Marchet Colani, the hero in J.C. Heer’s novel “Königs derBernina”). Mrs. Georg OBRIST still ownsa bed and other pieces that once belonged to Colani.\n\n1.) JohannOBRIST (born August 3, 1812) marriedUrsula Bott in December 1852 and produced:\n\n2.) RudolfOBRIST: (born September 23, 1854). Married Annette Binna of Sta Maria on March22, 1885.

Enrico Matossi, the husband ofErika O, was a pilot and trainer with Swiss Air and died in a plane crash nearRegensberg on February 10,1967.\n\nSamuelOBRIST (born October 5, 1800), son of Jakob OBRIST (born. February 14, 1762),married Susanna Ballbach from Wädenwil on September 21, 1823 at the age of23. The couple seems to have dividedtheir time between Gachnang, Frauenfeld, Neftenbach, and Töss. Their children were:\n\n· Joh.Heinrich b. January 18, 1825 inGachnang\n\n· Friedrich b. November 21,1826 inFrauenfeld\n\n· Anna b.March 5, 1828 in Frauenfeld\n\n· Hermann b. March 28, 1831 inNeftenbach\n\n· Johannes b. January 21, 1838 in Töss\n\n· Joh.Jakob b. November 16, 1840 inTöss\n\n· Karoline b.June 21, 1843 in Töss\n\n· Wilhelm ?\n\nSamuelOBRIST migrated to Brazil with his wife and four youngest children (all of whommay have been the product of a second marriage) in 1855. His son Friedrich married Dorothea Vogelfrom Neftenbach (b. 1820) in 1851 and they had three children: Emil Friedrich (b. December 22, 1850), KarlFriedrich ( b. September 1, 1852, d. August 18, 1853) and Karl Friedrich ( b.January 29, 1863.)\n\nAccordingto an oral communication between Karl Friedrich (b. 1863) and the author ofthis piece, Emil Friedrich worked in Florence as a locksmith. He seems to have been the first to use ironscrews in the building of the bridge over the Arno river, and won much famebecause of it. As a result, he was ableto open a small repair shop for farming machinery- the shop, however, was quiteunsuccessful. He was so popular withhis workers, on the other hand, that many of them gave their children the firstname of “Obrist.”\n\nEmilFriedrich called his brother Karl Friedrich, a dental hygienist, to Florenceand soon opened a dental business and practice. Emil married Eugenia Ersilia Campolini (b. 1869) in 1892, and the couple had one child namedArturObrist He studied macro economicsand finished with a doctoral degree. The author of this piece visited the family in 1927. Arturo was a true Italian in every way, andwas also an officer in the Italian army. The author exchanged letters with Arturo for many years preceding thewar, at which point contact became impossible to maintain. By 1969, Arturo (still single) had moved toMilan, but his relatives in Florence would not or could not provide a newaddress. The Italian branch of theObrist family will die with Arturo, given that the uncle Emil Friedrich diedwithout producing any heirs.\n\nTHE OBRIST COATS OF ARMS\n\nTheObrist family does not seem to posses an ancestral coat of arms, with theexception of Obrist branches in Zürich, Zollikon and Aarwangen. The Liebstadt Obrist coat of arms wascreated by the local teacher J.H. Welti of Leuggern and was placed by Wetli inthe Aargau provincial archives in 1956. This coat of arms presents “Obrist” as a reflection of “zuoberst ( orthose who are above, on top) “ through the use of the church spires.\n\nTheObrist coat of arms from Laufenburg, Lenz and Mandach were created by theprovincial archivist Nold Halder, and were influenced heavily by the Liebstadtcoat of arms. They are now in the provincial archives. The identity of the creators of coats ofarms from Magden (1952), Wallbach (1953), Dättwil (1955), Brugg (1955),Rüfenach (1956) and two from Riniken is unknown. Because they were introduced into the archives at around the sametime, however, we may assume that Nold Halder is either fully responsible fortheir creation, or had a hand in the process. Evidence to support this position, however, is scarce and it must,therefore, remain conjecture."
