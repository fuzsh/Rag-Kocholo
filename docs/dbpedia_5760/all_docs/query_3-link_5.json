        "text": "This lake, which was created in the eighties, is situated in the middle of a beautiful forest in the district of Obersteckholz. There is a small fire pit at the lake. A toilet is also available.\n\nThe capital city of Bern is 35 minutes from the hotel by train or 50 minutes by car. In addition to the Parliament building, the Old Town, the Zytglogge Tower, the cathedral and the Käfigturm are also worth seeing.\n\nHave you always wanted to know how the holes are made in the king of all cheeses? On the self-guided \"digitional\" tour through the show dairy in Affoltern, you will learn more about the production of Emmental AOP, the history of the brand and the big secret regarding its holes.\n\nBern's local mountain is not only an open-air festival site, but also a popular destination for nature lovers and families. With the observatory, a 500-m-long toboggan run, downhill trails and numerous hiking tours, the Gurten offers something for everyone. Ski and toboggan runs are also available in winter.\n\nBuilt in the 17th century, this monastic church is one of the most impressive examples of Baroque and Cistercian architecture in Switzerland, and is just a few minutes' drive from our hotel. There is also a sculpture park in the abbey garden.\n\nAcross eight stations, Pixie and Murkel show our little guests the beauties of nature, the richness of the forest, and the power of friendships. The trail leads through the forest by the zoo and can also be accessed with prams.\n\nThere has been a brewery and distillery here since as early as 1857. The \"Langatun\" single malt whiskies have been produced since 2005. There is also a gin in the range. The distillery can be visited, and the whiskies can be tasted.\n\nBurgdorf Castle is one of the oldest and most important castle complexes in Switzerland. The castle has been open to everyone since 2020. In the new museum, visitors can also experience a richly varied exhibition about the history of the castle and the region.\n\nThis more than 300-year-old castle is home to a cosy castle café and a museum that gives insights into the history of the first Baroque castle on Bernese soil. In the castle park, you can enjoy a magnificent view over towards the Jura mountain chain.\n\nThe beautiful baroque town of Solothurn is a 45-minute train ride or a 35-minute drive from the hotel.\n\nThe lively Old Town, the Mediterranean Riviera on the Aare, the extraordinary museums and the many shops invite you to experience and discover the area. And you'll be amazed at the meaning of the magic number 11.\n\nThe water meadows north and south of Langenthal (the so-called \"water mats\" in German) are \"eternal meadows\", which are percolated several times a year with water from the Langete or water ditches. They were included in the \"Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments of National Importance\" in 1983 and can be visited freely on foot."
