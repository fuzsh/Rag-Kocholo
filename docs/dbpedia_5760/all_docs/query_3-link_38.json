        "text": "A miniature version of the world-famous castle of Louis XIV: Thunstetten Castle is rightly known as the \"little Versailles\". The picturesque manor house in the Oberaargau region invites visitors to marvel, discover and linger. You can find out more about the history of the 300-year-old castle in the museum and then enjoy coffee and cake in the pretty castle caf√© with a view of the impressive park.\n\nThere is also a lot going on culturally at Thunstetten Castle. Guided tours, workshops on various topics and the popular Baroque Day are organised on a regular basis. The premises can also be hired for your own event. Especially recommended: you can also get married here like in a fairy tale. The castle even received the Swiss Location Award for one of the most beautiful wedding venues in Switzerland for its unique location."
