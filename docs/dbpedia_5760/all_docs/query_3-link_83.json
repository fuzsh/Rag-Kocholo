        "text": "At Baden, the route finally splits of from that previously travelled on Route 6 and heads South on Regional Cycle Route 34.\n\n“At Mellingen, the river Reuss is crossed by a wooden bridge. Some have supposed that the battle in which the Roman general Cæcina beat the Helvetians, A.D. 70, was fought here.”\n\nWhilst the wooden bridge, built in 1798, was replaced with a simple steel one in 1928, the Old Town is still entered through a bridge gate tower and gives an idea as to what Murray would have walked into.\n\nBack in A.D. 70, the town was actually located on the opposite side of the water.\n\nThe only details I could unearth about the Roman invasion of Mellingen was this interesting account in the 1895 book, “The History of The Swiss People” by F. Grenfell Baker:\n\n“Aulus Caecina, one of the legates of Vitellius, had just entered Helvetia, on his way to Italy, with an army of 30,000 men. On learning that a Roman centurion had been arrested by the Helvetii he at once marched to his rescue.”\n\nBut this was no Saving Centurion Ryan story…\n\n“Caecina is described by Tacitus as a blood-thirsty, ferocious commander, delighting in slaughter, who simply made the act of the Helvetii a pretext for gratifying his taste for war. And right well he sustained his reputation. On his progress he laid waste the whole country, pillaging and destroying every town and village he passed, and slaughtering thousands of the unfortunate, unresisting inhabitants. Amongst other places he burned was the important town of Aquae (Baden), then, as now, renowned for its thermal springs. The helpless peasants, driven to desperation, tried to face the Romans ; but, being without arms, discipline, or cohesion, were easily defeated and slaughtered wholesale.”\n\nHistory, and indeed many of the Routes I had already travelled in this book, is full of tales of wholesale slaughter of innocent people like this, particularly in advancing religions at the expense of non-believers, or in expanding empires and borders. It’s partly why I get annoyed when I hear people talk of the horrendous barbaric acts committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria as being representative of “the evil of Islam” when in fact you could equally apply that tag to any religion, empire or ideology.\n\nFor me, as horrified as I am at the crimes committed by ISIS on entire populations and ancient monuments, I’m almost as equally appalled that, in this day of age, the rest of the world allows it to happen. I can’t quite imagine Caecina being allowed to take the same route to Italy nowadays, although what’s going on in Syria, Nigeria or the Congo has me wondering as to what we have actually learned from history.\n\nTalking of history, it wasn’t long before I reached Lenzburg.\n\nBack on Cycle Route 34,\n\nAt a village called Hunzenschwyl, the road to Aarau turns off to the right, and that from Schintznach and Brugg joins our route.\n\nRESTAURANTS IN OFTRINGEN (73km):\n\nInn: Lowe\n\nYou pass the “good inn” Murray recommends on the way through the village, before reaching the busy crossroads. “The Lion” (Alter Löwen) on Dorfstrasse, is now home to the cafe of the Ortsmuseum, which shows how the rural population of the town used to live during Murray’s time. [MORE INFO]\n\nIf you haven’t already visited Aarburg (Route 4), then I recommend making the 1km diversion at the crossroads to view one of Switzerland’s most spectacular castles (now a young offenders institute).\n\nBack on the Regional Cycling Route 34, I followed the signs to Rothrist.\n\nI reached Murray’s next port of call, just 2km from the “Kreuzstasse” crossroads…\n\nRESTAURANTS IN ROTHRIST (75km):\n\nAt Rothrist, 1 ½ farther on, there is a good inn (Cheval Blanc – Rossli), kept by a civil landlady.\n\nThe restaurant Rössli, on the approach to Rothrist sits on a pretty roundabout and is still, to this day, ran by “a civil landlady”, Irene Bolliger, whose team serve up a tasty daily menu of Swiss classics, including fondue in winter. [MENU]\n\nThe road runs along the right bank of the Aar to Morgenthal\n\nCycling along the side of the Aare through the village of “Morgenthal” (Murgenthal), I was amazed at all the old houses, which would have been around when Murray walked by, many now in desperate need of some TLC, having lost their importance as people whizz by by at high speed in their motor cars, choosing to buy their milk and cheese from petrol stations or supermarkets on the edge of the major towns rather than these once important commuter villages.\n\nAlthough he doesn’t mention it, Murray probably continued along the busy main road which passes through the industrial outskirts of Langenthal. This presumption is based upon the fact he also completely omits any mention of the alternative route (directly opposite the Löwen) which runs alongside the river, taking in stunning farmland and the historic village of Aarwangen, through which I followed the cycle route 34. It’s arguably the highlight of the entire route and a baffling omission, especially given the non-descript villages he does include.\n\nThe Gasthof zum Wilden Mann dates back to around 1600, and is worth adding to the inns already recommended by Murray, making this possibly the best pub crawl of some of Switzerland’s oldest taverns.\n\nIntroduced after Murray’s time is the beautiful old railway station which still greets the quaint trams which run down the centre of the town’s main road.\n\nThe main landmark of Aarwangen though is the magnificent 12th Century Schloss Aarwangen, now a council building, 1km off the cycle route on the Aare river.\n\nBack on track and following the Route 34 cycle signs again, I passed through some of the most beautiful riverside farmland that Switzerland has to offer, for a picture postcard stretch of road that should be high on the “must see” list for every first time visitor to the country.\n\nRESTAURANTS IN HERZOGENBUCHSEE (98km):\n\nJoining Bernstrasse, I followed Murray’s directions into the Emmental and the village of “Hochstetten” (Höchstetten),\n\nbefore continuing on towards “Alchenfluh” (Alchenflüh), which is now an uninteresting modern town merged into the neighbouring town of Rüdtligen (four years before Murray’s visit) and separated from Kirchberg only by the narrow Emme river.\n\nI avoided the heavy traffic of Alchenflüh town centre by following the Route 34 cycle path, crossing the river from Kirchberg over a footbridge and cycling amongst stunning old Emmental farms in Rüdtligen, a far more picturesque route than the incredibly busy main road through Lyssach’s industrial units and world famous Swedish £1/€1/$1 Hot Dog store (which, this being Switzerland, costs CHF2).\n\nLeaving the cycle route once again, I headed to Hindelbank.\n\nMurray’s highlight for the entire route wasn’t the impressive castle at Laufenburg or the pretty Emmental farming villages en route, but the pretty normal looking Reformierte Kirchgemeinde Hindelbank church, dating back to 1275 but rebuilt after a fire in 1911.\n\nIn the village church is the celebrated Monument of Madame Langhans, wife of the Minister, who died in child-birth.\n\nIt is by a sculptor, named Nahl, and represents her with her child in her arms, bursting through the tomb at the sound of the last trumpet.\n\nThe ‘over-rated’ sandstone tomb, built “into the pavement of the church” in 1751 by the celebrated German sculptor, plasterer and odd-job man, Johann August Nahl the Elder, is quite a somber piece of work.\n\nStood there alone in the dark church, staring at this celebrated monument, it suddenly dawned on me that Murray would have done exactly the same back in 1837 and my imagination quickly drifted into a timewarp placing him in the very same tiny room as me, our conversation going something like this:\n\nIts merit, as a work of art, has been much exaggerated.\n\n“Ah, come on Johnny boy, don’t be so miserable, it’s not that bad.”\n\nIts chief excellence seems to be the natural manner in which the crack in the stone is represented.\n\n“I agree with you there mate, but it’s still an impressive statue nonetheless. Well, apart from her nose that is; he seems to have missed a bit there.”\n\nThe chief figure is injured by the loss of the nose, which Glutz Blotzheim asserts (it is hoped unfoundedly) was the wanton act of an Englishman.\n\n“Typical! Bloody Brits abroad! Probably some rowdy stag do from Hartlepool who arrived here on a budget diligence.”\n\nMurray quotes the revised 1830 edition of the Swiss historian Robert Glutz von Blotzheim’s “Handbuch für Reisende in der Schweiz” (“Handbook for Travellers in Switzerland”), which inspired the title for his own guide, in which is written “The nose is somewhat injured by an Englishman who showed a proud insolence here, and not quite the noble image.”.\n\nInterestingly, in the 1818 and 1823 editions of the book, no blame is attached to the English and Glutz simply informs the reader that “the nose is slightly injured”. Whether he had uncovered new evidence as to the culprit or if he was just less than happy at the sudden influx of rich British travellers making the Grand Tour, is probably only for his own conjecture.\n\nIt was hard to tell if the nose still remained “slightly injured” or if Mrs Langhans had been referred to a top plaster surgeon to have work done. Either way, not knowing if the locals still held a grudge, I escaped sharpish with the guilt of a nation hanging heavily on my conscience.\n\nThe castle on the neighbouring height, belongs to the Erlach family.\n\nThe Erlachs were one of the most powerful families in Bern during the 17th and 18th Century, and, obviously not content with just Schloss Hindelbank, also owned castles at Erlach on Lake Biel, Jegenstorf, Thunstetten, Zollikofen, Wyl, Riggisberg and Bümpliz. Demonstrating the power of nepotism, no less than seven of the family served as Schultheiss (Mayor of Bern).\n\nThe final 17km into “Berne” (Bern), along the Route 34 cycle path, through rather pleasant countryside and amongst large houses, are not described by Murray, and he saves the city itself for Route 24.\n\nThe Abbayes, or houses of the guilds, also, accommodate travellers: the best is the Distelzwang, or Abbaye aux Gentilshommes.\n\nThe beautiful Distelzwang building at Gerechtigkeitsgasse 79 still belongs to one of Bern’s thirteen guilds. It can be rented for private events, but not for accommodation.\n\n~ CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS ~\n\nFor a hotel that would have been around during Murray’s visit to Bern, try the 3 Star Hotel Goldener Schlussel, the oldest hotel in the Old Town."
