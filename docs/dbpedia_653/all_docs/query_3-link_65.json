        "text": "\"Three independent immature sized dugongs were sighted. The first dugong was sighted on the south eastern side of Havelock Island (11056’-11059’N & 92056’-92059’E) and behavioural observations were made for 47h. The individual was approximately 2m long, with distinct scars on its body; an X-mark on its head, a line running back from the right pectoral, roughly circular marks above the left pectoral and on the underside of the base of the tail and 2 notches on the tail. It was observed feeding on seagrass (Halodule sp. and Halophila sp.) at an average depth of 6 m and at a maximum distance of 100m from the shore. It spent a mean period of 9.4 ± 0.7h, n=15 a day feeding in an area of 0.1km2. The density of seagrass was sparse and the lengths of the shoots were less than 100mm. When feeding on these low growing sea grasses, the dugong dug into the bottom with its muzzle, extracting and consuming leaves, stems and interconnecting rhizomes. In this process, it reworked the upper 20-30mm of substrate raising clouds of fine sediment and leaving behind distinct long, serpentine feeding trails (Image 1). It surfaced at mean intervals of 231.8 ± 13.5 s, n=22 (submergence time) to breathe at an angle of 450 exhaling once it reached the surface. The breathing pattern comprised of 2 short breaths at mean intervals of 31.1 ± 6.0 s, n=22 followed by a longer third breath. The mean total surface time was 59.2 ± 6.0 s, n=22. This was followed by an arching of the body and a forward roll which raised the mid-dorsal region and then the tail above the surface giving a downward thrust. The descent was generally at a steeper angle and on reaching the bottom; the dugong supported itself on its pectorals without the body actually touching the sea bed. The pectorals were also used for locomotion on the bottom.\n\nThe second dugong was sighted around Neil Island (11049’-11050’N & 93000’-93°02’E) and behavioural observations were made for 54h. It was approximately 2.5m long, had a distinct crescent scar on the left side above the pectoral, a notch on the inner side of the left and right pectoral and the left side of the tail and a scar running along the lower half of the trunk. It was observed feeding on Halodule sp. and Halophila sp. at an average depth of 9m, and at a maximum distance of 100m from the shore during the neap tide. While feeding, it surfaced at mean intervals of 268.4 ± 14.6 s, n=41 and spent a mean period of 2.9 ±0.8 h, n=36 a day feeding. During the spring tide it was observed idling and resting at this site (Image 2). While idling, it swam at an average depth of 3m and up-to a distance of 300m from the shore. It moved with the help of its tail and surfaced at mean intervals of 326.1 ± 11.8 s, n=29 and spent a mean period of 4.1 ±0.8 h, n=14 a day idling. While resting, it remained close to the surface without any movement and closed its eyes. It was observed resting for a mean period of 1.2 ±0.3 h, n=4. While idling and resting, it just submerged while moving forward without arching and rolling. It was observed communicating in the form of long squeaks. Both the dugongs sometimes had 1-2 remoras attached posteriorly and ventrally to their bodies and were always preceded by juvenile pilot fish. The third dugong was sighted at Kodiaghat (11031’49.25’’N & 92043’36.68”E) in south Andaman and was observed for a brief period of 590 s at a depth of 7m. It was approximately 3m long and it showed observer directed behaviour. It curiously approached us and stopped at a distance of 2m from us. It then circled us twice surfacing to breathe between each circling. It followed the similar breathing pattern of two short breaths and a third long breath. All three individuals were identified as males and confirmation of the sex was done by an observation of the genital parts.\"\n\nDsouza E., Patankar V. (2009).
