        "text": "Introduction to Manatees\n\nOne of the most unusual of all the aquatic life out there is the manatee. You may also hear them called by the name of sea cows due to the resemblance they have to such land animals. They lead a very solitary life in the water unless they are mating or they are female with young to care for. They are plant eaters so they really don’t bother any other creatures in the water.\n\nThe manatee does have some natural enemies though to worry about when they are in the water. Most of the time it is the young and the weak that are the most vulnerable to such predators though. They include crocodiles, alligators and sharks. What predators they have to worry about depends on the location where they live.\n\nOf course their biggest threat comes from humans. They continue to destroy the natural environment. They also pollute the waters and this has lead to a significant number of them being killed in the past couple of decades.\n\nYou will only find manatee’s where they water is at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit. They tend to like it much warmer than that. This is why so many of them migrate towards Florida in the winter time. They do communicate among each other at this time as well as time part in the mating rituals. Many tourists from around the world head to Florida during this time of year to observe the manatee’s as they migrate. In fact, there are some areas that allow the humans to swim with them.\n\nThe manatee spends most of its time either eating or sleeping. They spend their entire lives in the water. They are herbivores and enjoy a variety of many different plants that are found towards the bottom of the body of water they happen to be in. They tend to stay close to the coastal areas that are shallow to search for food unless it is scarce. Then they will move to deeper waters.\n\nA great deal of what we know about the manatee comes from satellite tracking devices. They are in place by many different agencies including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership. Due to their dedication we are able to see patterns of migration and other behaviors of this mystifying animal.\n\nIn the wild, a manatee can live up to 60 years of age with the right condition. They do seem to do quite well in captivity. However, the females can show signs of stress by not mating for several years after they are placed in captivity. Right now the oldest living manatee in captivity is 51 years of age. His name is Snooty and he was born in captivity in 1948.\n\nWhile there is evidence that the manatee evolved more than 60 million years ago to survive in water, their time may be running out. They are considered to be vulnerable for extinction at this time. This is due to a combination of things including humans in the water, swallowing fishing line, natural predators, and even global warming. There are many conservation efforts in place though so hopefully these amazing mammals will be able to continue being a part of the Earth for millions more years.\n\nManatees are mammals that do not form groups, do not have evident leaders or hierarchical structures. They are semi-social animals that can live peacefully with other partners without relying on them for protection or cooperation in any situation. However, manatees sometimes form groups or aggregations which are called herds. Baby Animals names and groups.\n\nThese groups are referred as aggregations because manatees can gather at some place to meet their individual needs, not to get something from the group. For example, they rest in some communal areas or look for food in the same location than others, but they do not cooperate to perform any of these activities like a group.\n\nOn the other hand, the “mating herds” are the groups of several males in search of receptive females during the breeding seasons. These groups follow females in heat for a few days or weeks until some of the group succeed in copulating.\n\nManatees are slow-moving animals and do not have convincing defense characteristics like sharp fangs or claws to deter their strongest and most aggressive opponents such as sharks, alligators or very rarely jaguars. However, they have other peculiarities that do not make them easy prey.\n\nFirst, manatees stay most of the time in shallow waters; also, some of the bodies of water they inhabit have crystalline waters where they can see the bottom, something that does not help crocodiles or alligators. Second, its size and body thickness is not something that facilitates its capture.\n\nFinally, while they usually make slow movements, few know an essential tool for survival: Fleeing. Some manatees flee from the danger at more than 30 kilometers per hour, while most of their lives they move at no more than 10 kilometers per hour."
