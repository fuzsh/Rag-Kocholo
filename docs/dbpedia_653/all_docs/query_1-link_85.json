Thii^ iir parfN tie may not be reproduced in any form without fhr Library of Congreas Catalog Card Xuini«T: 57 PREFACE Tho author has been most gratified with the reception accorded the first edition of 'h\\natomy of the Chordates.'^ The numerous communications he has received from teachers and students in various parts of the world have indicated that the labor involved in gathering, organizing, and pre- senting the vast amount of material included in a volume such as this has been worth the effort. In preparing the new edition an attempt has been made to correct the disconcerting errors and inconsistencies that unfortu- nately seem to appear no matter how meticulously one tries to avoid them. Many of the pages have been completely rewritten in an attempt to present the material more clearly; portions which the author and some of his critics have found to be inade<|uatc have beem revised; new concepts and inter- pretations have been incorporated; several illustrations have been changed, and a numlxu* of new ones added. The general plan of the text, which is designed for use in introductory cours(‘s in comparative vertebraU^ anat- omy, has not been changed. Part I is primarily a revi<^w of the ph^dum Chordata. Much of this portion is presented in accordance with the n^cognized system of classifi- cation of chordati^s. Here (n’olutionary tn‘nds and nont;(K*hnical aspt^ds of the animals concerned are discussed. Emphasis has been placed on familiar living species. R<‘ferenc(^s to fossil forms, however, have been included wher(‘ desirable and finisible. The material is meant to parallel that with whieh the subject of vert(‘brate paleontology is concerned, rather than to include it. Tlie gimeral discussion of th(J phylum Chordata is fol- low(‘d by a ehapt<U’ on dc^velopment, since much of th(‘ subserpuait infor- mation is pres(mt<*d from an emhryological point of view. A knowledge of th<‘ significancu* of germ layers and tissues is basic, in many <*as<‘s, to an undf*rstanding of th<j comparative anatomy of the organ systf‘ms of <‘hordatc‘s. The structure of the organ systems is diseussed in Part 11. Functional asp(*cts of the various organs have b(‘en iiududed throughout this scM^tion. At tlu* cmd of each <diapt(*r is a summary of the main points (‘mphasized in that cliapter. Borne crit ics have objected to th(‘ s<Hjuential urrange*inent of the chapters on organ systems. Th<‘ subject mutter, howe‘ver, is in most cascis jiresentf^d in such a manner that the inftrrmution distaiss(‘d in one cliapter d<M*H not presupposr? a knowledge of that containtHl within a pnndous chapter. The instructor may therefore prefer to follow a s(H|uence of his own choice. V VI PREFACE Part III is concerned with the detailed anatomy of four n^jn’e.^pntativM chordates usually studied in laboratory courses in eomparati\\'e anaforny; the marine lamprey, spiny dogfish, mud pnj)py, and cat. Suppiemeiit*^! by a few directions from the instructor, this section may lie useti a> a laboratory manual. Anatomical terms have been printed in bffldface typ*' for emphasis. The illiLstrations of the various anattmiicid features tif the representative chordates ar{‘ included in onier to htdp tlie student in ifienti- fying structures, not to serve in lieu of dissection. By far the greattu' num- ber of persons who have communicated with the authtir havt* exfire-M-d approval of this type of presentation. A summary chapter, giving characteristic's and advances of members of the phylum, has been placed at the end of th(» l>ook wht're it profwaiy belongs. Although this chapter is organized in a manner similar ti» that of Chapter 2, there is little <luplication of subject mattta. Thanks are due to the many int{‘r<*st<‘d pta'sons who have ofTerer! sug- gestions for improvement of the second edition. T!te criticLsms and recom- mendations offered, in particular, by Dr. Hazel K. Field of Occidental College and Dr. Roland Walk(‘r of Rens.^elaer Polytechnic Institute have been invaluable. The author gratt'fully at'knowlt*dgcs the help given him by his students Joanne Moore, Roswitha Schugt, Halpti Archer, Jame^ Dohm, Arthur Page, Ceorge Schwemk, and Ronald Speigle in the prepara- tion of many of the figur<‘s. Tlie drawings <jf Ceorge Hchweuk, now working in the field of mt'dical illustration, are noteworthy. He also wishes to take this means of e.xprt'ssing his appreciation to his wife, Kath- ryn H.

The scope of biology is so vast that no single person can hope to master all its ramifications. Since most living things come under two general groups, plants and animals, biology is conveniently subdivided into two great stud- ies, hoiamj^ which deals with plants, and zoology^ which treats of animals. Biology, chemistry, and physics are closely interrelated. Many biological phenomena can he most r(‘adily explained in chemical and physical terms. Without a knowledge of chemistry and physics the biologist cannot go far in his study of living things. METHODS OF APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF ZOOLOGY There are several general methods of approach to the study of zoology. The more important onCvS are listed as follows: Study of the physical and chemical properties of protoplasm, the only known fmm of matter in which life is manifested. Such study is, for the most part, relegated to the biocliemist and biophysicist. Morphology, the sekmee of form and structiin* of living things. It may he suixiivided in turn into a numfx?r of more vspecializcd fields of study which include*: Gwhh analarny, dealing with struc‘tures which can be seen with the un- aided eye without the aid of optical instruments. Dissection is the method of approach that is used in gross anatomy. Ilustology, or microscopic anatomy, which is the study of the more mi- nut(‘ details of the relations of normal tissiass. Preparations which can be e.xamin<*d under th(‘ mi(‘roscope are used in histological studi(*s. Cytology, or cellular anatomy, which involves study of the d(*tailed struc- ture of (‘{‘11s. Embryology, or developmental anatomy, which treats of tlu* structure of th(‘ dt*veloping embryo and which utilizes both gross and histological meth- ods fjf approach. Physiology, the bnm<‘h of zoology which deals with tlie functions of the living organism and its parts. Tlu.*sc activities an* so complex and the various structures of the body are so clost*ly intern*luted that the fumdions of organs must always be studied in relation to thos(‘ of other organs. Ecology, tlie sekmex* of organisms as they are afft‘(*t(‘d by th<‘ir environ- Both morphological and physiological aspects of aiiimals in relation to tlieir environment are considered in the study of ecology. 1 2 HEVIEW of the phylum chordata Tnw. I The study of evolution, Iho theoiy that twisting orp:anirims aw n'<uit of descent, with modification, from thos(‘ of past times. I%vol?iriun is a fundamental hiolopdcal principle which advances the idea that, in O'latifnt to natural changes which have occurred on tht‘ eartli, the hiuher form- of life as \\vc know them have evolvful from hnvf*r forms. Taxonomy, or systematic zoology, the stdtaice which lias to do with the classification of animals according to tlnar natural relationships. It also includes the laws and principles of such classification. Although taxonomy is based primarily upon morphological ilata, changes whieh take plaee during embryonic development are also taken into consideration. Mor»- over, taxonomic affinities an^ often sui>stantiated hy certain physirdogii-d likenesses and difTerences. Serological stiniies, in wlu<*h n\\'ictioris of {-ertain blood groups have been ol).s(*rvcth have estahli.sht*<l the aceuraey or in- accuracy of taxonomic relationships based on stnadnral similarities an*! differences. THE STUDY OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY The student of chordate anatomy should realize at the hegirnnng that taxonomy, ecology, and the study of (‘volution are all \\nisvii in part upon comparative anatomical relationships, (’omparativa* anatomy may al^u be used to explain some? of the phenom(‘na that app(*ar during emhryornr development. A knowledge of struct un* alone, however, has very lit fie meaning unless it is interpreted in terms of function. Morphtdogy and physiology complement (‘ach c)t!u‘r. Ho far as is po.ssiblt% it is dc‘sirahle that both structure and function b(‘ considenni tog(‘tIu‘r in studying aniinaN. Nevertheless, a preliminary kn{)wl(‘dgc of morphology is a great aid to tlie study of physiology. In the following pagi*s sonu* discussioti of fund ion i> included whenever feasible hut the (‘inphasis is phuTd upim anatomical **b- servation. Method of approach to comparative anatomical study. W hen similar- ities and differences in structural organization of tin* hodit‘s (jf diiTerenf animals are made obj(‘C‘ts of study, and when the facds obtaint*d are eotn- pared, then from the study of structure* genera! prirudphxs art* tiorivt**! froui which deductive conclusions may be drawn. This is tlu* iiudlaHi of llu* comparative anatomi.st, who se(*ks to e.xpluin the variations in struetuo* that are found in the bodies of animals with a vi(nv to trucirjg Idolt^git'al re lationships. Most students of biology are interested in man, but a study of man alt^nt* would lead to an extre^medy narrow conception of his place on tlu* (*art h. In order properly to understand the position of man in tin* world of lift*, u knowledge of his relations to other living things i.s almost e.s.st‘ntia!. Man is classified as a member of a large* group of aninntls calh‘d tlu* virlw braies. They are forms which have a backbone, or vt*rU*bra! column, and include such diverse creatures as snakes, fislujs, birds, frogs, eh*phants, and Chap. 1] INTRODUCTION 3 mice. The anccvstors of these animals are the ancestors of man; the stor>^ of their ongin is similar to his. A thorough understanding of the body, mind, and activities of man involves a study of his vertebrate ancestry. Although the method of comparative anatomy has been used in studying the relationships of almost all forms in the animal kingdom, the scope of the subject is too vast to be considered in a single volume. We shall confine our attention here to a comparative study of the vertebrates and a few of their closest relatives, all of which are included in the phylum Chordata. The student, when in the laboratory, studies and dissects representative chordate animals and gains an intimate knowledge of the detailed structure of each. This knowknige does not constitute a science unless the facts learnc‘d are properly correlated and blended into a harmonious whole. It is the aim of this volum(' to effect such a correlation. At the beginning of a course of study it is valuable for the student to have an id(^a of its objectives so that time may be most profitably utilized in putting the emphasis upon the facts of greatest importance. The com- parative anatomist recogniz(‘s that the vertebrates and some of their close relatives are built upon th{‘ sam<' fundamental plan and that there is often a close correspondence even in d(‘tail. Within the gcmeral vertebrate plan there may be mtmy valuations which are, for the most part, adaptive in nature. By this is mvimi that they are modifications which meet particular n(‘e<is in ndation to th(* environment in which the animal lives. The object of a course in comparative anatomy of vertebrates, tlien^forc, is to accpiuint the stu<lent with the plan of vertebrate stnudure. Such knowI(‘dge serves as a background for th(^ better appreciation of the studies of embryology, human anatomy, and medicine. Homology, llie term homology refers to the correspondences in type of structure* Indween parts or organs of ditT(u*ent animals. Because of evolu- tional diiTtuumliation, these may have diverged considerably from the same or conu'sponding part or organ of some remote ancestral form, so that super- ficially tluw lH*ar but little n*s(‘mhlanc<* to one another. For example, ob- servation of the skeleton of a cat shows that its forelimb is composed of a singh* bone in the upp(‘r l(*g, two in tin* lower leg, an<I a number of inier- mediat<* bones .*::ituat<*d b(*twi‘en the lower leg and tlu* toes. The wing of a lanl, which is utilized in .so diff(‘rent a manner, woukl at first sight s(*em to be a thing apart and in no way like th<* forelimb of a cat. The skeletons, however, n*v(*ul basic .siniiiuriti(*s in structure. The arm of man, th(* flipper of the whak*, tlu* hoofi^d k*g of tlu* horse, and the wing of a bat are all built upon thesanu* fundamcuitul plan and an*, ihertd'ore, homologous (Fig. l.I). In some cases <iitTen*iu‘i‘s in structure are so gr<*at that their liomologies might In* unHUsptvtcni. Observation of a s(*ries of intermediate stages bt*- twet*n tlu* twt) (*xt rentes may oftt*n clearly indicaite their basic similarities. Tin* .study of homolog^v of purls in various forms i.s one of the most interest- ing features of comparative animal studies. Observations on the d{‘tails of 4 l^EVIEW OF THE PHYLCM ('HORDATA I embryonic development have in many instaiK'es reiiciered ^rreaf ^erviee f/i the comparative anatomist in revealing sucii homologies.

For example, at a certain stag(^ ai <ieveIoi>ment in nil x ertebratev a series of pouches pushes out from the phaiyn.x to establish conm*ctitm witli the outer covering of the body. In such low<‘r forms as tisfies perforations occur at the points of contact, becoming gill slits whitdi persist throughout life.

Why should pharyngeal |X)Uc1u‘h appear at nil in lugher forms? Another illustration of the principk? under tiiseussion is to In* found in the appearance, in the region of the pharynx in ul! vertebrates during embryonic development, of certain blood vesH<*ls ealhsj tmiit arrh^H. *rhe structural plan of the aortic arches in tlie emhnjo of a bird, for exunifile, is very similar to that found in the gill region of adult fishes. It is nlwmt identual with that found in the embryos of such diverse forms as (ish(*s, Chap. 1] INTRODUCTION 5 snakes, frogs, and man. In the bird, as well as in other higher forms, the aortic arches soon undergo considerable modification, ultimately forming an arrangement of vessels in the posterior part of the neck region or in the anterior part of the thoracic region which is characteristic of each partic- ular group. Several ideas have been advanced to explain why such stmetures as pharyngeal pouches and aortic arches should make their appearance in the embryos of higher vertebrates. Perhaps the best-known of these is the FISH TORTOISE CHICK PIG CALF MAN SAUMANDER Fi<;. 1 ,2. Three eomparabh^ sta^!;(‘s in the <.iev{‘Iopmont of (‘mbryos of Hev(*nil vertebniteH.

In other words, ontoijcny (individual life hlstoiy) recapitulates phyhfjiny (racial history).

CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORDATES There are three characters of prime diagnasli<* irn|K>rtance which are possessed by all chordates, us follows. stoiniich supraesophageal ganglion Fig. i.3. Diagram showing exoskelcton, digestive truet, aiul iWHitkm <»f veHtni! gan- ghonated nerve cord of crayfish. A notochord is present sometime during life. A more or loss typieai invertebrate animal, such as a crayfish, posstisses a hard, nonliving, wxtornai covering, the exoshektm, which is deposited on the surface of the bo«ly by Chap. 1] INTRODUCTION 7 the secretory activity of the underlying cells. It protects the animal, serves for muscle attachment, and is provided with joints which permit movement and locomotion (Fig, 1.3). The vertebrate skeleton, on the other hand, is essentially a living endoskeleton, which provides protection for the delicate internal organs, gives support to the body, and is jointed so that movement is possible. Although all chordates have an endoskeleton, turtles, armadillos, and a few others possess exoskeletal structures as well, but the exoskeleton in thes(‘ forms is primarily composed of living material and is not at all com- paral)le to that of the invertel>rate. In all chordates a notochord, which is a primith’c endoskeletal structure, is present during embi-yonic life. It is pli- ant, rodlike, and made up of vesicular connective tissue (Fig. 1.4). The noto- chord is located along the mid-dorsal line, where it forms the axis of support for the body. In some animals it persists as such tliroughout life, but in most chordates it serves as a foundation about whi(*h the vertcl>ral column, or bac'kbone, is built. A salamander larva or a frog tadpole, for example, at first possesses a notochord (Figs. 1.5 and l.b), l)Ut it is gradually replaced, first l>y a cartilaginous and then by a bony vertc‘bral column. By the time Fir.. 1.4. Vesicular connective tissue of which notochord is (composed, as seen uiuler the microscope. 1.0.

A hollow, dorsal nerve tube is present sometime during life. The tyfxi of ctuitml niu'v'ous system found in arthropods, as well us in some lower phyla, is located o» the ventral side of the Ixidy except for a dorsal gangli- onic mass, known a.s tlic brain, whiidi connects to the ventral portion by ewiphageiil connetftives (Fig. 1.3). This type; of nervous .sy,st.em is aome- time.s called the \"ladder type” because it is made up of a double chain of en- 8 RFAIEW OF THE PHYirM cmmOATA Wnw. i largements, called ganglia, united by ner\\’ous eennr^rtiofis in Inrrli Ifintri- tudinal and transverse directions and so lias a larififuiike apiiearaurf*. in the crayfish there is a considerable degrtn* of fnsit>n lietween rij^ht and halves.

Many ty|ies of resjiiratory organs are found among animals tiel*iiig« ing to phyla below the clauilafes in the evolutionary s«*nle. Some nsspire tfinMigti moist iniegumiuits, somt» tiuve tratdiea! tubtvs, others fiave book lungs, and still others have gills of various kinds (Fig. 1.7), In none of these types, howe\\^(‘r, do the n\\spira* tory organs have any connection with tin* digesti\\’'e tract. A great many aquatic eiiordates respire by means of gills made up of viiscular lamellae or filaments lining the borders of gill slits wliitdi connect to the phaiynx and open directly or indirectly to the outside (Fig. 1.8). Bv(*n' ter- restrial cliordatc^s, which nc*ver breatla* by means of gills, nevertheless have traces of giil slits present as transient structures daring cnuly development.

CHAPTER 2 CLASSIFICATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE CHORDATES Before undrrfaking a study of the anatomy of the chordates it is de- sirafde to hav(» a working knowlt^dgo of the animals included in the phylum. Zoologists have gnaipini ihvav animals in an orderly fashion according to their natural aiai anatomical affinities. This grouping serves as a basis for classifying all rneml»ers of thi^ phylum. It is important that the student of <*om|>arativf‘ anatomy have some knowledge of the classification of the idiordates: otherwise a study of their anatomy from a comparative view- point will have little meaning. In a hook of this kind it is not feasible, nor is it rMia\\*<sary, to disctiss all the animals concerned. In ilie following pages, thfU'efore, em|>hasis has be(*n jdaced on those forms of which some knowl- c*tlge is alneist i*ssenlial an understanding of tlie principles underlying tiie sulgeet eoiaparative anatomy.

'I'he nerve ganglion lies embedded in the mant le in the region lad ween tint siphons. This is the dorsal side of the animal. Almost completely sur- rounding the ganglion is an adrmral gland which opens by means of a Chap. 2] CLASSIFICATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE CHORD ATES 15 duct into the pharynx. Some zoologists have homologized the adneural gland with the pituitary gland of vertebrates, but there is a difference of opinion concerning this. A ciliated groove, the endostykj extends along the midventral line of the pharynx to the esophagus. Food particles that enter the pharynx with the incurrent stream of water are gathered by the endostyle and swept down to the esophagus. Some biologists believe that the endostyle may be the forerunner of the thyroid gland of higher forms. Certain other structures of Molgula are indicated in Fig. 2.2. Sea squirts were formerly classified as mollusks because of their peculiar structure in the adult stage. It was not until 1860 that the proper classi- fication was determined when Kowalevski, a Russian biologist, found that the aseidian larva possesses typical chordate characteristics. During its larval existence a sea sf|uirt somewhat resembles a tadpole in appearance. It has a notochord which is confined to the tail, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, and a pharynx perforated with gill slits. After a free-swimming period it finally attaches itself to some object and becomes sessile. The animal then undergoes a metamorphosis during which the notochord disappears and the nerve cord is reduced to a simple ganglion (Fig. 2.3). The only one of the three essential chordate characters which persists is the pharynx with its numerous gill slits communicating indir(‘ctly with the exterior. Sessile tunicates may be either solitary or colonial. Not all tunica tes are sessile, however, for some are fme-swimming, transparent pelagic forms throughout life. SlJBPH YLUM III.

Further details concerning its anatomy are discussed under appropriate headings in the following pages. Group B. Vertebrata (Craniata) All chordates, with the exception of the protochordates, are included among the vertebrates. In these the anterior end of the dorsal hollow nerve cord is enlarged to form a brain, and a protective and supporting endoskele- ton is present. With the appearance of the brain a skeletal structure called the murch cranmnij or simply the craniim, makes its appearance, serving to protect that delicate organ. The cranium forms part of the skull. Openings, or foramina, are present for the passage of cranial nerves, blood vessels, and the spinal cord. The latter is likewise protected by a series of metamerically arranged skeletal elements, the vertebrae, associated with the notochord in their development. Openings for the passage of spinal nerves are present between adjacent vertebrae. The group Vertehrata is usually divided into two subphyla: Agnatha and Gnathosiomaia. SuBPHYLUM IV. Agnatha Agnathans lack jaws and paired appendages, even in the embryo. There is but a single median nostril. The mo\\ith in living species is round. Class I, Ostracodermi. There are no living ostracoderms. Fossil re- mains indicate that these were probably the earliest vertebrates on record. Some forms possessed lateral body lobes which have been interpreted us possible forerunners of paired pectoral appendages. One species, Pterich^ thys (Fig. 2.7), even had paddlelike flippers, but not true pectoral fins. Un- like living agnathans, the bodies of ostracoderms were covered with a heavy armor of dermal bone. It was foi'merly believed that the earliest verte- brates poss(?ssed cartilaginous skeletons much like those of the lowest verte- brate living today and that the appearance of bone was a later develop- ment. The presence of bony plates (and even of a bony endoskeleton, of a sort, in a few forms) in the fossil remains of the oldest vertebrates has cluing<*d tin* ideas of zoologists and paleontologists in this regard. The medium concept is tliat the presence of bone was a primitive character and that living eyelostomes and elasmobranch fishes with cartilaginous skele- tons re|>n\\sent degraded descendants of bony ancestors which have lost their bony skeletal elements and armor secondarily. Class IL Cyclostomata* Living agnatlians, wiiidi include lampreys and hagfishes, are included in this class. Altliough primitive in many re- spects, th<‘y are believed to l>e modified and degenerate offshoots of the primitive vertelamte stock. In some respects they are so highly specialized that liomoiogies with other vertebrates are difficult to ascertain. ( •ycloHtomes have roiin<led, (‘(‘Hike bcxlies with laterally coinpress<*d tails.

The cranium is better developed than in agnath- ans. The subphylum is divided into two great superclasses which include the fishes and the four-footed animals, respectively. Superclass I. Pisces, Fishes are entirely aquatic and in most cases re- spire by means of gills lining the pharyngeal gill slits. The paired append- ages are fins, of which there are usually two pairs. Median fins are also present. Dermal scales of various types are found in the skin with few ex- ceptions. Fishes are generally divided into three classes: Placodermi, Chondrichthyes, and Osieichthyes. Placoderms are known only through fossil remains. Class I. Placodermi. During Devonian times approximately 400 mil- lion years ago ostracoderms gradually became extinct and primitive placo- deims replaced them. The placoderms developed primitive jaws and paired fins but retained, to varying degrees, the bony armor of ostracoderms. This consisted of large bony plates arranged in different ways, and which prob- a{)ly gave rise to the several types of dermal scales found in modern fishes, Placroderms were not successful on the earth from a long-range point of view. Tiuy gradually disappeared as two new types of fishes evolved— the <jartikiginous and the bony fishes. Class 11. Chondrichthyes. Sharks, dogfishes, skates, rays, and chi- maiu’us are examples of cartilaginous fishes. Most arc marine forms witli cartilaginous skeletons, placoid scales, and ventral, subterminal mouths. All ha\\x! tails of th(j lieterocercal type (Fig. 10.44) in winch the dorsal flange is larger than the ventral. These fislies are descendants of those whieli lived in Devonian times and which evolved from placoderms or plae- cKiermlike ancestors. The skeleton in this class of fishes is primitive in many respeets but not in the fact that it lacks bone and is entirely cartilaginous. The lack of bone is iH^ieved to represent a retrograde condition. Tlie bone in the basal plates of the piacoid scales in the skin is all that remains of the ancient bony armor. OK 0 KE L SELACun (EtASMOBEANCHii). The clasmobranch fishes, as membem of this order are generally called, include those cartilaginous fishes in which the gill slits o|X!n s<*parately to the outside.

Frogs and toads, ofUui thought of as primitive t(dra- pods, are actually far removed from the original amphibian stock. Borne skeletal structures of certain amphibians show a higher degree of specializa- tion tiiun do c<^rr(nsponding parts of lizanis, which belong to the class Rep-- lilia. Not all amphibians, therefore, are at a lower level in the evolutionary scai<‘ than reptiles. It is |)r(>bable that both groups arose from a common ancestral stock lait that amphibians, in mo.st cases, failed to attain the <k‘gr(*i‘ of advan<M‘ment and specialization generally found among reptiles.

Several groups of r<*ptih‘s mnm to have evolved from the cotylosaurs. Rome were important for a time ami then lost ground and disappt>ared; others have perHiHt(‘tl to the presimt day with but little change; still others evolved further ami not only gavt» ris 4 * u> most of our modem reptiles but to birds and mammals m well (Fig. 2. lb). Among early forms which went up a blind alley, so to speak, were such large aquatic reptiles as the short-necked iethyomurs and long-ma^ktd plesiosaurs. Modem turtles also are believed to have skimmed directly Chap. 2] CLAS.^IFICATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE CHORD ATES 29 from an early side shoot of the cotylosaurs. They have shown but little advance. Another group tracing its origin to any early branch of the cotylosaurs was that which gave rise to naammals. Among the earliest of these mammal-like reptiles were the cynodonts, the skulls and teeth of which more nearly resembled those of mammals than those of other reptiles. vStill another stem from the early base is believed to have branched in two directions. One branch gave rise to Sphenodon and to the lizards and snakes of today. The other was made up of a great group of reptiles, the archosaiirs, sometimes called the “ruling reptiles.” The varied types of dinosaurs and the flying pterosaurs belonged to the subclass Archosauria. The only reptilian survivors of archosaurian origin are crocodiles and alliga- tors. E\\^en they have become considerably modified from the ancestral stock. Birds probably evolved from another branch of archosaiirs. Like pterosaurs they developed the ability to fly, but the structure of the wings in the two groups is very different (Fig. 10.57). At the close of the Age of Reptiles great climatic changes occurred af- fecting both animal and plant life. Thousands of years elapsed before the great dinosaurs, their vsmaller relatives, and the pterosaurs disappeared and mammals, heretofore an insignificant group, began to flourish. Although reptiles and amphibians arc believed to have arisen from a com- mon ancestral stock, the gap between the two groups is large. This is most strikingly l>rought out by their manner of development. Eggs of reptiles are always laid on land, and a resistant shell covers the large-yolked eggs. Of (jven greater significance is the presence of the embiyonic membranes mentioned above. As in lower forms, the body temperature of reptiles varies wdth the en- vironment. In this respect they are said to be poikilothermous. The skel- etons of r(‘pliles are more compk^teiy bony than those of amphibians; their hodi(‘s are covered with dry, horny scales, and the skin is practically devoid of glands. Except in snakes, and in certain lizards which lack appendages, tht^ limbs are characteristically pentadactyl. (HU pouches are present only in th(' i^mbryo, and respiration is entirely by means of lungs except in cer- tain a<|uuiic turtles in which cloacal respiration is (‘mploytvi as well. The young resemble tlanr paremts, and metamorphosis docs not occur. OHDKU I, CHKLOXIA. Chcloiiians are not closely related to other modern reptiles since they n‘present a very old group which has persisted with but little change for some 175 million years. Terrestrial forms are usually called tortoises, whereas turtles are generally semiaciuatic. Terrapins are edibU‘ fresh-wat<‘r speci<‘s. TIk^ l>odu*s of chcUonians are relatively short and wide. In certain marine forms the pentadactyl limbs have been mwiifial to form flippers. Teeth art* lacking, the jaws being covered aith sharp horny beaks. The anal opening is in th<‘ form of an elongated, longitudinal slit. Most noteworthy is the presence of a shell which encases the body. The more rounded dorsal 30 REVIEW OF THE PIfYUWI f llOROATA 2 poliion is the carapair; the flatter ventral rf‘^ 2 :iou is the phh'ifnm, The sftell has an underlying layer of bone over which h<»rriy s<*a!v's an* arranged in a rather similar manner in most spet’it's.

As in SphenodoTij the anal opening is in the form of a transverse slit. Chap. 21 CLASSIFICATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE CHORDATES 31 SUBORDER I, SAURiA (lacertilia). Lizards usually have two pairs of pentadactyl limbs, but some, known as glass snakeSj as well as certain oth- ers, do not have legs, so this feature cannot be used to characterize lizards as a group. The eardium, or tympanic membrane, is not flush with the surface, and external ear pits arc visible. Contrary to the condition in snakes, lizards have movable upper and lower eyelids as well as a nictitating membrane. The two halves of the lower jaw are united, and the animals lack the ability to open their mouths in the manner of snakes. Lizards and salamandem are commonly confused by the layman. The shape of the body in these two groups is essentially similar, but the smooth moist skin of the salamander and its toes without claws are quite in contrast to the dry scaly skin of the lizard, the toes of which bear claws. One characteristic for which certain species of lizard are famous is their ability to change color rapidly {7netachrosis) so as to blend in with the back- ground of their (uivironment. Not all lizards have this ability, however. The largest species of lizard extant is the dragon lizard, Varamis komo- doeniSy of the East Indies. It may r<‘ach a length of 12 ft. The gila mon- ster, Heloderma, is the only poisonous lizard known. There are two species. SUBORDER 11. SERPKXTKS (ophidia). Snakes have lost their limbs in the course of evolution, but some, like pythons and boa constrictors, still retain vestiges of the pelvic girdle and limbs. Locomotion is accomplished in two ways, by sideward muscular undulations of the body and by m(>^'e- ments of the transverse ventral seah‘s. Snakes lack external ear pits and tympanic membranes. The eyelids are immovably fused, and are trans- parent. The loose ligamentous attachment of the jaw bones to each other and to the cranium enables the snake to stretch its mouth to a remarkable degree. Snakes vary greatly in size, ranging from species only 6 or G in. long to 30-ft. pythons. Poisonous snakes fall into two groups, the vipers and the cobras. Some of the mor(' familiar vipers, su(‘h as the rattlesnake and copperhead, arc called pit vipers because of the prescuicc^ of a pitlike depression Ix^twetm the eye and the no.stril. The pit is a sense organ, sensitive to heat, enabling the animal to b<‘eom(? aware of a warm object some distance aw'ay, ORDER IV. CHOCODILIA (loricata).

Numerous adaptations of birds are of intercHt to the comparative anati>- mist. Those which fit them for aerial life as well as for life on lantl or water; the extraordinary migrations of many 8jx*c*ies; their methtsls oi courtship and nest building have all been carefully studied. The fec*t and bills tjf birds show many curious adaptive variations (Figs. 2.22 and 2.2*3). Class IV. Mammalia, Mammals are homoiothermou.M gnuthoHtomt*s which have hair and mammary glands. All mammals have some liair, Chap. 2] CLASSIFICATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE CHORD ATES 37 and only mammals have hair. ^Mammary glands are special skin glands which secrete milk iimi to nourish the jmung. It is believed that mammals evolved from cynodont reptiles. Probably the intricate mechanism which ensures a constant body temperature inde- pendent of the environment has had much to do with the present wide distribution and supremacy of mammals. BirdvS, the only other homoio- thermous animals, are also widely distributed. They have specialized along lines which enable them to fly. Mammals have specialized in another direc- tion, Z.C., development of the nervous system, particularly the cerebral por- tion of the brain. Mammals have become adapted to a diversity of habitats. Some, like moles, live almost entirely underground; whales are at home only in the wat(‘r; bats rival birds in their ability to fly; most monkeys are arboreal; but the large majority of mammals walk or run on the ground. Many mammals, entire orders in some cases, have become e.xtinct. In the follow^- ing account only living forms are stressed. A few mammals (thn^e species) lay eggs, but the rest give birth to living young. Accordingly, the class has been divided into two subclasses, of which the first contains only the egg-laying forms. Subclass I. Prototheria. Eggw of prototherians are incul)ated out- sid<‘ the bod 3 % but the young are nourished by milk from mammary glands. No nipples are present, the glands optuiing dinadly on the surface of the skin. The tliree living species an» included in a single ord(‘r. Fitj. 2.21.

The platypus (Fig, 2.24) is scmuiquatie in habit, its Inaiverlike body, tail, and webix'd feet adapting it to life in the water. Its ducklike bill is soft, {i<».Kible, arid moist an<l rir^lily supplied with organs. It Ixairs only a superficial r(*sc‘inblance to the bills of cffrtain birds. No biologist today believes that the platypus is a connecting link Ix^tween birds and mammals. 38 OF THE PHVU'M (TIOHDATA [Chap, 2 In tho spiny anteaters the skin is covf^n'd with sjiinns and foarsf* hair (Fig. 2.25).

The peculiar geographical distribution of marsupials is iliflicult tt> explain Chap. 2] CLASSIFICATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE CHORD ATES 39 and has aroused many interesting speculations. Fossil remains of numerous marsupials have been found in South America, indicating that they once were a thriving race on that continent. A rather widely accepted explana- tion suggests that when mammals arose to a dominant position they had already split into two basic groups, the marsupials and the placentals. At tins time Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America were united into a con- tinuous land mass, or World Continent, whereas Australia and South Amer- ica were probably island continents. It is known from the fossil record that primitive marsupials of little relative importance were present, at least in Fit}. 2.2r>.

Pla- cental maininuls, however, were predominant. In Australia and Soutli Amt‘rica \\hv mammalian populations differed from thost^ of the World Con- tinent.
