        "text": "Three orders of the class Mammalia contain marine mammals: Cetacea, Carnivora, and Sirenia. (There is a section on each of the three orders in this appendix. Each includes a table listing the marine mammals in that order.) The size range of marine mammals is immense, varying from a newborn sea otter weighing perhaps 1 kilogram (kg) to the largest female blue whale weighing about 100,000 kg. Their habitats are also quite varied, encompassing all seas and numerous coastal areas and shores as well as some freshwater lakes and rivers.\n\nAll extant Cetacea and Sirenia normally spend their entire lives in water. In contrast, marine mammals of the order Carnivora are semiaquatic, often hauling out on land. Some of these semiaquatic mammals spend considerable periods of time (many months) in the water, often hundreds or even thousands of kilometers at sea away from haul-out or breeding areas. Families of marine mammals of the order Carnivora are these: Otariidae, or eared seals (fur seals and sea lions); Odobenidae (walrus); Phocidae (true seals); Mustelidae (chungungo and sea otter); and Ursidae (polar bear).\n\nIn the United States, all marine mammals are legally protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). The species of the order Cetacea and suborder Pinnipedia that live strictly in freshwater are also protected under this law, and thus they are included in this discussion. Under the 1972 act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) of the U.S. Department of the Interior is responsible for administering regulations concerning polar bears, walrus, sirenians, and sea otters; the National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals not regulated by FWS. In addition, another independent body established under the MMPA, the Marine Mammal Commission, maintains a scientific committee to advise on issues related to marine mammal conservation. Those species designated as endangered are further protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nThreats to marine mammal populations worldwide are many. They result, for example, from fishing (the use of gillnets, driftnets, ghost nets, long lines, the yellowfin tuna purse seine, rolling hooks), pollution (agricultural runoff, industrial waste, petroleum spills, trash dumping), deforestation and development of the rain forests, damming, oil field development, mining, heavy-vessel traffic, and other human activities."
