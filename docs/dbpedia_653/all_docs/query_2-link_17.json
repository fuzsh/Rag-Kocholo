        "meta_description": "There is one living species in this family. The dugong is found in coastal waters off of Africa, India, Australia, New Guinea, and other South Pacific Islands. At 8-10 feet in length, it is the smallest member of the Sirenia order. Dugongs are found in warm, shallow coastal waters. They have cleft lips; small eyes; dark brownish-gray skin, lightly covered with hair; paddle-like front flippers; and a tail with a dolphin-like fluke. Dugongs eat sea grasses and algae. Females give birth to a single calf 12-14 months after mating. A calf may stay with its mother for a few years. Dugongs can live to be 50 years old in the wild. The dugong is an endangered species. - Wildlife Journal Junior",

At 8-10 feet in length, it is the smallest member of the Sirenia order.\n\nDugongs have cleft lips; small eyes; dark, brownish-gray skin that is lightly covered with hair; paddle-like front flippers; and a tail with a dolphin-like fluke.\n\nDugongs eat sea grasses and algae. Females give birth to a single calf 12-14 months after mating. A calf may stay with its mother for up to six years. Dugongs can live to be 70 years old in the wild.\n\nSteller's sea cow is an extinct member of this family. It was once found in the North Pacific Ocean along the coasts of Alaska and Russia, and unlike other members of the Sirenia order, it thrived in cold waters. It was around 28 feet in length. It had no teeth and ate kelp and algae.\n\nIt was first reported by Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist who was part of the crew of Vitus Bering 's ship the St. Peter. The St. Peter shipwrecked off the coast of Kamchatka in Russia in 1741. The crew killed six of the slow moving creatures for food to survive. The crew was able to leave in 1742 and reported what they had found when they returned home. Other crews returned hunted the sea cow and by 1768 it had been hunted to extinction.\n\nWorld Status Key\n\nLeast Concern Near Threatened Vulnerable Endangered Critically Endangered Extinct in Wild Extinct\n\nStatus and range is taken from ICUN Redlist.
