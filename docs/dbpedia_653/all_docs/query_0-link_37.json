        "text": "They must be eukaryotic, meaning they have nucleus, and in the domain Eukarya. In the Linnaean classification this could be in the kingdom Protista like a paramecium. Another Linnaean classification of this could be in kingdom Animalia, since they are heterotrophs and their cells contain a nucleus. They could be grouped as predators, since the organism is engulfing another organism. They could also be grouped based on their locomotion. They could have cilia, legs, or even flagella.\n\nThere are many different types of reefs but the most common type of reef is the Fringing Reef. There are also many different types of species that live in this reef. There are tons of different species of fish that live in large groups and come in all different colors. Although, the two main groups of fish that live in this reef are vertebrates and invertebrates. Among the different types of vertebrates living in this reef includes Fish, Sea Snakes, Sea Turtles, Dugongs, and Manatees. These are the only fish that usually swim in large groups. Among the coral reef the invertebrates, which is the most common group of different types of living in this reef, are the constructors and\n\nWhen society thinks about starfish, perch, chordate, and fetal pig they become extremely curious about how their bodies operate because of how they are made up. I will give a brief synopsis of all animals before going into major detail about them. According to the online website named dictionary.com, Starfish are any echinoderm of the class Asteroidea, having the body radially arranged, usually in the form of a star, with five or more rays or arms radiating from a central disk; asteroid (dictionary.com). It is known that a chordate is an animal belonging to the phylum Chordata, composed of true vertebrates and animals having a notochord (dictionary.com). According to research, a fetal pig is an animal in the phylum Chordata and class Mammalia (dictionary.com). A perch is known to be a certain kind of fish with very spiny fins (dictionary). Starfish, perch, chordate, and fetal pig are some very interesting animals that possess some exclusive qualities both similar and different.\n\nEchinoderms such as starfish, sea cucumbers, and urchins are identified by their symmetry and central mouth. This species is found decorating the coral reefs by their variety of color and sizes. Because some of these animals like to burrow in the sand, they can supply oxygen to some of the depths in the ocean. Echinoderms are a staple food in many sea animals diet.\n\nOne of the most mystifying creatures of the deep blue sea, the cuttlefish is not a fish it is some squid-like mollusks. The cuttlefish has a large out stretched body with its mouth being surrounded by tentacles, giving it the nickname head-footed. Cuttlefish around the world varies from sizes of 15cm to 60cm and weigh from the range of 6lb to 23lb. This creature is found throughout the warm tropical shallows of the ocean to the cold depths of the deep ocean.in order for the cuttlefish to survive they are able to change their body color and they body texture to blend in with different marine environments, while being prey upon dolphin, sharks, seals, cuttlefish, and other big fish. The cuttlefish uses its ability of changing colors to hide itself\n\nMoon Jellyfish are in the “Animalia Kingdom, Phylum Cnidarian, Class Scyphozoan, Order Semaeostomeae, Family Ulmaridae, and Genus Aurelia” ( Myers, 2016 ; Espinosa, ; 2016 ; Parr, 2016 ; Jones, 2026 ; Hammond, 2016 ; Dewey, 2016). The morphological description of Cnidarians are corals, sea anemones, jellyfish and hydroids. These cnidarians form a diverse phylum that contains ~9000 species, which live in aquatic (predominantly marine) environments. The phylum-defining trait of Cnidaria is the stinging cell, the nematocyte an extrusive organelle used for predation, adhesion and defense (Holstein, 1981; Lengfeld et al., 2009; Tardent and Holstein, 1982) (Steele and Technau; 2011). Also, this phylum, Cnidarians, are divided into two groups, “Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals and sea pens), which live as\n\nStarfish and crayfish are both invertebrates, but they have many differences. Last week, our class did a dissection on each and learned more about them. This research paper will explain some differences between the two that were learned during dissections and by doing outside research.\n\nCephalopods, meaning \"head-foot\" due to the muscular feet near the head, is an important class of the mollusks that includes species like the squid, octopus, nautilus, and cuttlefish. Octopi have eight tentacles, the squids and cuttlefish have ten, and the nautilus can have eighty to ninety. The feet of octopi and squids are developed\n\nMy species is the Ocellaris Clownfish! This is the one that looks like Nemo on Finding Nemo. Its body is an oval shape and has three vertical white stripes outlined with a fine black line. They are saltwater fish and live in an anemone. They live in a core habitat. They have symbiotic relationship with the sea anemone. The anemone gets pesits it doesn't want living on it off of it, and the clown fish gets protection from the tentacles of the anemone. Young clownfish have difficulty finding an anemone to live in. The young clownfish begins at the bottom of the social ladder when it enters an anemone. It is often the victim of aggression by other clownfish. Clownfish are a very social group. They like to live in colonies.There are two types of"
