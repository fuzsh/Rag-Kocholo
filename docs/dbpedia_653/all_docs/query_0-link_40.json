Serves as an anchor for muscles. Replaced in gnasthomata by carilaginous or bony vertebrae.\n\nDorsal, tubular nerve cord\n\nAbove the notochord and digestive system, on the dorsal side of the animal. Tubular because it is in an infolding of ECTOdermal cells.\n\nPharyngeal pouches or slits\n\nSeries of slits which are used for respiration, or filter feeding in protochordates. Developed from endo- and ectodermal grooves\n\nEndostyle or thyroid gland\n\nSecretes mucus. Also secretes proteins.

Lungfishes and coelacanths.\n\nThe lungfishes can gulp air and survive out of water!\n\nCoelocanths were believed to be extinct for a long time.\n\nSwim bladder\n\nA sack in the animal. It can be filled with gas using the Ovale in order to increase buoyancy, and regulate pressure (check on this one)\n\nTeleostei\n\nSubclass. In the class Actinopterygii. These account for 96% of all living fish species known to us, including over ~27000 species.\n\nFast swimmers versus slow swimmers\n\nEels are slow swimmers because they undulate over the entire body.\n\nTuna are fast swimmers.\n\n2 signs of speedy swimming:\n\nUndulation is primarily in the tail region, the body is stiff.\n\nThere is a sickle-shape to their tail fin.\n\nChondrostei\n\nSubclass of Actinopterygii. 26 species. They are commonly known as sturgeons. Their spawn is used for as caviar (Roe), and since they take so long to develop, they are now threatened\n\nHolostei\n\nA subclass of Actinopterygii. Do we know anything about this one?\n\nOvale\n\nA gas gland which can take up gas, or put it into the circulatory system, this in combination with the swim bladder, allows the fish to manipulate the amount of gas in its system. (check on this one)\n\nProtostomia\n\nMouth develops first from the blastopore.

Comprised of Caecilians. 160 species. These look like snakes, but are not. Burrowing, blind, moist skin. Moist skin's a big difference from snakes. Reproduction: internal fertilization, oviparous or viviparous. Just because they don't have legs doesn't mean they're not tetrapods.\n\nUrodela\n\nOrder of Class amphibia. Salamanders. 500 species.\n\nLimbs at right angles, moist skin. Moist skin, no scales seperates it from lizards. Reproduction: internal fertilization, oviparous. Their development includes a metamorphosis, sometimes the larval form is aquatic.\n\nAnura\n\nOrder of Class amphibia. Toads and frogs. ~4900 species.\n\nCaecilians\n\nOf the order Gymanophiona. Like snakes but moist skinned.\n\nPaedomorphosis\n\nRetention in the adult of features that (in the ancestor) were present only in the juveniles forms.\n\nThe difference between toads and frogs.\n\nToads have a rough skin with poison glands while frogs have smooth skin.\n\nBulfonidae\n\nSuborder of Anura. True toads.\n\nHylidae\n\nSuborder of Anura. Tree frogs.\n\nRanidae\n\nSuborder of Anura. Bullfrogs.\n\nAmplexus\n\nWhen many amphibians are ready to mate the male latches onto the females back, and they enter this state. The female begins to deposit eggs in the water, and at the same time the male releases the sperm, so the eggs are fertilized outside of the body.\n\nParts of the egg.\n\nAmnion (water seal), allantois (waste products), chorion (gas exchange, embryo, shell, yolk sac (food).\n\nLeathery shell\n\nThis is a feature of the eggs of class reptilia. It protects the eggs from external damage.\n\nEmbryo\n\nThis is the developing offspring, for which the egg-environment exists.\n\nAmniotic membrane\n\nthe \"pond within the egg,\" this is a watertight sea around the embryo within the egg.\n\nYolk sac\n\nThis exists outside the amniotic membrane. It contains food for the developing embryo.\n\nChorion\n\nOutside the amniotic membrane. allows for gas exchange.\n\nAllantois\n\nPart of the egg responsible for storing waste products. Outside of the amniotic membrane.\n\nAnapsids\n\nSubclass of reptilia. These only have one opening in the skull, behind the eye. Primarily, this describes turtles (testudines)\n\nDiapsids\n\nSubclass of reptilia. These have multiple openings in the skull, lateral and dorsal. This allows for better jaw motion, stronger jaws. Includes lizards, worm lizards, and snakes (order: squamata)\n\nWhat's the trouble with \"Class Reptilia?\"\n\nIt is not a monophyletic group because it fails to acknowledge birds, which are in the class aves.\n\nSynapsid\n\nType of skull... I know humans are this, but what is it?\n\nTestudines\n\nOrder of Class Reptillia. Turtles. Anapsid. Dorsal carapace, ventral plastron. No teeth, keratinized plates for gripping.\n\nReproduction: Internal fertilization, oviparous.\n\nSphenodonta\n\nOrder. Within the subclass Diapsida. the tuataras of new zealand.\n\nSquamata\n\nOrder. Includes lizards, snakes, and worm lizards. Within the subclass Diapsida.\n\nRough, scaly skin\n\nOne of the features of reptiles. Reptilian scales come from the EPIDERMIS, whereas fish scales come from the dermis.\n\nReptilia\n\n\"Class\" (should include birds) 1. Characterized by dry skin, 2. crushing jaws, 3. amniotic eggs, 4. internal fertilization, 5. water conservation via uric acid,\n\nGlottis\n\nSnakes breathe through a hole in the bottom of their mouth. This is useful when they're stuffing a giant bit of prey into their unhinged maw.\n\nSphendonta\n\nOrder of Reptillia. Tuataras... only two or three species in new zealand. They have a photoreceptive third eye which is associated with thermoregulation and hormone reproduction.\n\nCrocodilia\n\nOrder. Alligators and crocodiles. Subclass Diapsida. They exhibit homodont dentition.\n\nHow can you tell between a crocodile and an alligator?\n\nCrocodiles have a narrow snout, and you can see both the top and bottom teeth when their jaw is closed. Alligators have a wider snout, and you can only see the top teeth.\n\nAves\n\nClass. It's birds! Primarily distinguished by feathers, and usually, flight. Belongs to chordate groupings aminota, gnasthstomata, certebrata, craniata, chordata, tetrapoda.\n\nDiapsid. 10000 species described.\n\nHow did flight develop?\n\nReptilian forbears either...\n\n1) ran away from predators, eventually happened to take off, so that was useful.\n\n2) tree climbing reptiles jumped from tree to tree, and gliding became useful.\n\nkeel\n\na large bone in the bird's sternum, where flight muscles attach.\n\nParts of Feathers\n\nMade of Keratin, the feather begins at the Quill, which turns into the Shaft. Protruding from the shaft are Barbs, and from these barbs protrude Barbules in one direction, and Hooklets in the other. This forms a strong, woven plane which is called a Valve\n\nQuill\n\nThe base of a feather, the thick part which attaches to the bird's skin.\n\nShaft\n\nThe central part of the feather, the quill becomes this.\n\nBarb\n\nStrands protruding from the shaft of a feather.\n\nBarbule\n\nstrands which protrude, in one direction (say: north), from the barb of a feather. Hooklets protrude in the opposite direction (south).\n\nHooklet\n\nThese are tiny hooks which extend from a barb to curl around the barbules from many other barbs. this allows the feather to form a strong vane.\n\nVane\n\nThe smooth, strong surface formed by interhooked hooklets and barbules. This is important to provide the wing stability necessary for the lift birds need to fly.\n\nMolting\n\nBirds look ruffled. This can occur seasonally, or once, in the transition from juvenille to adult. It is a risky period, because the bird will have difficulty flying.\n\nPerching\n\nSaid of birds, they have a system in their feet such that they do not have to actively grip what they are standing on.\n\nOdd flight muscle attachment\n\nA massive muscle pulls the wing down, but it's actually a small muscle that pulls the wing back up, and it does so on the same side (dorsal?) as the down-muscle. it does this by actually wrapping around the wing bone.\n\nThe respiratory system of birds.\n\nBirds have two air sacs where they can hold air. The first inhalation is directed first to the posterior air sac, then the lungs, then the anterior air sac, and finally it is exhaled. Birds effectively have two lungfuls of air at any given time.\n\nSpecialization in bird features.\n\nBeaks are based greatly on the type of food the bird generally feeds on. Wings are based on the type of flying the bird is required to do. You can't be a great glider and at the same time be a fast take-off.\n\nBird reproduction\n\nThe male does not have a penis. Rather, the cloaca come into contact, and the egg is fertilized internally.\n\nAltricial\n\nA type of development in which the offspring is helpless, with closed eyes and no feathers/fur\n\nPrecocial\n\nA type of development in which the offspring already has fur/eyes, and are not entirely defenseless.\n\nMammalia\n\nClass. Distinguished by hair/fur.\n\nBelonging to the chordate groupings Vertebrata, craniata, gnasthomata, amniota, chordata. The hair is made out of keratin, not chitin, btw. Mammals are endothermic. Mammary glands are a common feature of mammals. They are synapsid. Includes orders: Insectovore (shrews, moles, hedgehogs), Carnivores (cats, dogs, wolves, sea lions, walruses), Primates (monkeys, humans, lemurs), Chiroptera (bats), Rodentia (rodents), Lagomorpha (rabbits), Cetaceans (toothed whales, dolphins), Artiodactyla (sheep, goats, cattle), Perissodactyla (rhinos, horses), Sirenia (manatees, dugongs), Proboscidea (elephants).\n\nPrototherian Lineage/ Monotremes\n\nEgg-laying mammals. Eggs are laid, undeveloped young are born and feed from milk in the mothers fur. (no nipples).\n\nExemplified by platypus, echidna.\n\nMetatherian lineage\n\nMarsupials. Embryos are gestated for some time which is then birthed, and re-enters the mother in a pouch, where it develops further while feeding on milk.\n\nEutherian lineage\n\nMammals, like humans, with placenta. These give birth to live young.\n\nKangaroo reproductive systems\n\nKangaroo can actually have one young in the pouch while another is developing in the uterus, and when the first is still suckling, and another is in the pouch, a third can be in the uterus. Stranger still, the kangaroo can halt the development of the developing embryos so that they are \"stored up\" in case their current offspring dies.\n\nBiological fitness\n\nNumber of offspring produced over lifetime.\n\nHow do behavioral responses affect biological fitness?\n\nAvoiding predators, choosing what to eat, choosing where to live, finding suitable mates.\n\nDifferent stages of predator prey interaction\n\nEncounter. coming across prey.\n\nDetection. distinguishing prey from objects.\n\nIndentification. distinguishing prey as edible.\n\nAttack.\n\nSubjugation. preventing escape.\n\nConsumption. consuming caught prey.\n\nCrypsis\n\na type of camouflage in which the prey blends in with a random sample of the environment. Affects the detection stage of predator prey interaction.\n\nResemblence of an inedible object.\n\nThis is a type of camouflage which works at the identification level of predator prey interaction.\n\nMimicry\n\nA type of camouflage in which the animal imitates another creature, usually a toxic one. Batesian Mimicry occurs when a non-toxic species mimics a toxic one. Mullerian Mimicry occurs when a toxic species mimics another toxic species.\n\nBatesian mimicry\n\nA non-toxic species imitates a toxic one. This is detrimental to the toxic species, because the predator might eat things that look like the toxic species and not get sick!\n\nMullerian mimicry\n\nThis is a type of mimicry in which a toxic species looks like another toxic species. This benefits both of the species.\n\nHomodont dentition\n\nAll the teeth are the same. exhibited by Order crocodilia. Good for catching fish.\n\nHeterodont dentition\n\nteeth are different for different food types. Mammals and other omnivores possess this.\n\nHemiptera\n\nClass of arthropods, subphyla hexapoda.

Includes class insecta.\n\nArthropoda\n\nPhylum. distinguished by segmented appendages, antennae, tracheal system.\n\nChelicerata\n\nSubphylum of Arthropoda. distinguished by chelicerae, which are...\n\nMerostomata\n\nClass. Horseshoe crabs. feature book gills, chelicerae.\n\nArachnida\n\nClass. Includes orders Aranea, Scorpionidae, Acarina, Opiliones.\n\nOpiliones\n\nOrder. Daddy-long-legs.\n\nAraneae\n\nOrder. Spiders, 40000 named species.\n\nScorpionida\n\nOrder. Scorpions, 1400 named species.\n\nAcari\n\nOrder. Ticks and Mites, 40000+ named species.\n\nClosed circulatory system\n\nmeans there's closed vessels that comprise the circulatory system. The blood consists of both intracellular and extracellular fluids. Mammals, most phyla except molluscs (minus cephalopods, who do have a closed system.) Blood always contained in vessels.\n\nOpen circulatory system\n\nNo closed blood vessels, so there's just the one type of fluid. Found in Molluscs and Insecta\n\nSmaller and smaller blood tubes? starting with the heart.\n\nHeart-arteries-arterioles-capillaries-venules-veins\n\nVein\n\nBlood flowing toward the heart is contained in these.\n\nArteries\n\nBlood flowing away from the heart is contained in these.\n\nSystemic circuit\n\nThis circuit moves blood out from the heart to the body. In mammals, it connects to the right atrium.\n\nPulmonary circuit\n\nThis circuit moves blood to the lungs/gills to be reoxygenated.\n\nAmphibian heart\n\nAmphibians possess both pulmonary and systemic circuits, but the blood in each of these circuits mix within the ventricle of this organ. This makes it somewhat inefficient. However, amphibians breathe through their skin, this inefficiency in nutrient transport is not as crippling as it might appear.\n\nMammalian heart\n\n2 atriums, 2 ventricles.\n\nSystemic system dumps into the right atrium, pulmonary into the left. (by the way, it's the creature's right and left). The septum divides the right ventricle from the left.\n\nCirculatory system\n\nUsed for gas exchange and nutrient distribution. Can be open or closed, and utilizes the heart, pulmonary and systemic circuits.\n\nPericardium\n\nThis is the sac which contains all of the valves, atria, and ventricles of the heart.\n\nAtrium\n\nconnection between a system and a ventricle\n\natrium\n\nsmall chamber within the heart\n\nRight atrium\n\nthis chamber within the heart receives blood from the systemic circuit.\n\nleft atrium\n\nThis chamber within the heart recieves blood from the pulmonary system.\n\nTricuspid\n\nthe right atrioventricular valve\n\nBicuspid\n\nthe left atrioventricular valve\n\nventricle\n\nlarger chamber within the heart. There are two in most animals, right and left.\n\nSystole\n\ncontraction within the heart. Atrial systole causes ventricular diastole (relaxation).\n\nDiastole\n\nrelaxation within the heart. Atrial diastole causes ventricular systole (contraction).\n\nNeuron\n\nA nerve cell.\n\nDendrites\n\nThe \"input\" of the cell. Many other neurons may connect to the dendrites via there synapses.\n\nSynapse\n\nGaps between neurons, crossed by neurotransmitters.\n\nCentral nervous system\n\nIncludes the brain, spinal cord.\n\nForebrain\n\nIncludes Cerebrum (higher cognition), Thalamus (sensory integration), Hypothalamus (basic drives).\n\nMidbrain\n\nIncludes optic lobes (visual processing), midbrain nuclei (sensory processing)\n\nHindbrain\n\nIncludes cerebellum (motor coordination), pons (function unknown), medulla oblongata (basic body functions).\n\nCerebrum\n\npart of the forebrain. contains higher cognition functions.\n\nThalamus\n\npart of the forebrain. contains integration of different senses\n\nHypothalamus\n\npart of the forebrain. contains drives like reproductive function, hunger, thirst.\n\nOptic lobes\n\npart of the midbrain. responsible for visual processing.\n\nMidbrain nuclei\n\npart of the midbrain. responsible for sensory processing\n\nCerebellum\n\npart of the hindbrain. responsible for coordination, timing of movements.\n\nPons\n\npart of the hindbrain. not well understood except sort of as a gateway between brain and rest of nervous system.\n\nMedulla oblongata\n\nPart of the hindbrain. responsible for regulation of basic body functions\n\nMeninges\n\n3 layers of membrane surrounding the nerves in the spinal cord. surrounded by the vertebrae.\n\nGrey matter\n\nNeurons\n\nWhite matter\n\naxons\n\nReflex arc\n\nA neural system in which the sensory neuron moves into the spinal cord, and then right back out to the motor neurons, with NO brain interaction.\n\nPeripheral nervous system\n\nall sensory and motor neurons. divided into two parts, sensory and motor.

So, once a cure is developed, the virus can adapt...\n\nHow does HIV attack its host?\n\nThe varions enter the host through blood, semen, breastmilk. It then moves into the circulatory system and attacks specific immune system cells. It uses the host cell's enzymes in order to rewrite the cell's DNA with its own RNA using reverse transcriptase. the cell is then compelled to create new virons.\n\nRequirements for evolution by natural selection\n\n1) Traits are varied.\n\n2) Variations are passed on to offspring.\n\n3) Reproductive success is varied (this is universally true).\n\n4) Reproductive success is altered by inhereted traits.\n\nDifference between natural selection and evolution\n\nnatural selection occurs within the lifespan of an individual. Evolution occurs between the generations.\n\nEvolution\n\nChange in allele frequencies over time\n\n4 evolutionary mechanisms\n\n1) Natural selection\n\n2) Mutation\n\n3) Migration\n\n4) Genetic drift\n\nNatural Selection\n\nWhen specific genetic traits are selected because they lead to the greatest biological fitness. Can be Directional, Stabilizing, or disruptive.\n\nMutation\n\nRandom changes in the genetic material. Essential that they are random, not targeted. Provide the raw material for evolution: genetic variation.\n\nGenetic Drift\n\nrandom changes in allele frequency (not in the alleles themselves, that's mutation. Change in the frequency. Reflective of sampling error)\n\nIs occuring continuously, especially in small populations. Reduces genetic variation.\n\nMigration\n\nWhen individuals from isolated populations move from one population to another, they have an affect on allele frequency. This tends to produce more genetic variation, because different populations will have different frequencies, or even different alleles. The immigrants must reproduce to have an impact. Also, migration can sometimes work against natural selection (snakes on islands).\n\nFounder effect.\n\nWhen a species migrates to a new region and establishes the population, the original founders have a large effect on the allele frequencies of that population. Multiple founder events have the effect of reducing genetic diversity.\n\nDirectional selection.\n\nNatural selection in which one extreme of a given trait is favored. (eg larger beaks, or thicker shells)\n\nStablizing selection\n\nNatural selection in which the medium phenotype is favored.\n\n(eg medium sized palps)\n\nDisruptive selection\n\nA type of natural selection in which BOTH extremes are favored, and the medium phenotype is reduced.\n\nNatural selection versus sexual selection\n\nNatural selection encompasses sexual selection... but more specifically, sexual selection is comes in two varieties, intrasextual selection and intersexual selection. A creature which is favorved by sexual selection will often have greater mating success, even if it's less ideally adapted to the environment.\n\nIntrasexual selection.\n\nAdaptations which make an organism better equipped to compete with other suitors are favored.\n\nIntersexual selection\n\nFeatures which make an organism more attractive to mates are favored.\n\nSpecies concept\n\n\"Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other groups.\"\n\nSpeciation\n\nThe process by which one species becomes two or more. Occurs in the absence of \"gene flow\" (migration). reproductive isolation is essential to speciation.\n\nReproductive isolation\n\nEssential for speciation. No offspring. Could be at the level of courtship, or they can't fertilize, or the offspring aren't viable, or the offspring are viable but sterile, like mules.\n\nAllopatric model\n\nA physical barrier arises between populations. When the barrier is removed, they can no longer interbreed.\n\nAllopatric dispersal\n\nType of speciation where a new population is founded and loses contact with the old one until they can no longer interbreed.\n\nAllopatric vicariance\n\nType of speciation in which a barrier cuts into a species' range, dividing them into two populations.\n\nStomatopoda\n\nOrder, of Class Malacostraca.\n\ndistinguished by strange club-claws, and ruffled stomach\n\nDecapoda\n\nOrder, of Class Malacostraca.\n\nShrimp, Lobsters, Crabs.\n\nBryozoa\n\nPhylum.
