It was a luna moth! My heart was pounding with the excitement of new knowledge as I ran to share the discovery with my parents.\n\nEarth is teeming with life. No one knows exactly how many distinct organisms inhabit our planet, but more than 5 million different species of animals and plants could exist, ranging from microscopic algae and bacteria to gigantic elephants, redwood trees and blue whales. Yet, throughout this wonderful tapestry of living creatures, there runs a single thread: Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. The existence of DNA, an elegant, twisted organic molecule that is the building block of all life, is perhaps the best evidence that all living organisms on this planet share a common ancestry. Our ancient connection to the living world may drive our curiosity, and perhaps also explain our seemingly insatiable desire for information about animals and nature. Noted zoologist, E. O. Wilson, recently coined the term “biophilia” to describe this phenomenon. The term is derived from the Greek bios meaning “life” and philos meaning “love.” Wilson argues that we are human because of our innate affinity to and interest in the other organisms with which we share our planet. They are, as he says, “the matrix in which the human mind originated and is permanently rooted.” To put it simply and metaphorically, our love for nature flows in our blood and is deeply engrained in both our psyche and cultural traditions.\n\nI consider myself very fortunate to have made a living as a professional biologist and conservationist for the past 20 years. I’ve traveled to over 30 countries and six continents to study and photograph wildlife or to attend related conferences and meetings. Yet, each time I encounter a new and unusual animal or habitat my heart still races with the same excitement of my youth. If this is biophilia, then I certainly possess it, and it is my hope that others will experience it too. I am therefore extremely proud to have served as the series editor for the Gale Group’s rewrite of Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia, one of the best known and widely used reference works on the animal world. Grzimek’s is a celebration of animals, a snapshot of our current knowledge of the Earth’s incredible range of biological diversity. Although many other animal encyclopedias exist, Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia remains unparalleled in its size and in the breadth of topics and organisms it covers.\n\nOur own personal awakenings to the natural world are as diverse as humanity itself. I spent my early childhood in rural Iowa where nature was an integral part of my life. My father and I spent many hours collecting, identifying and studying local insects, amphibians and reptiles. These experiences had a significant impact on my early intellectual and even spiritual development. One event I can recall most vividly. I had collected a cocoon in a field near my home in early spring. The large, silky capsule was attached to a stick. I brought the cocoon back to my room and placed it in a jar on top of my dresser. I remember waking one morning and, there, perched on the tip of the stick was a large moth, slowly moving its delicate, light green wings in the early morning sunlight. It took my breath away. To my inexperienced eyes, it was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. I knew it was a moth, but did not know which species. Upon closer examination, I noticed two moon-like markings on the wings and also noted that the wings had long “tails”, much like the ubiquitous tiger swallow-tail butterflies that visited the lilac bush in our backyard. Not wanting to suffer my ignorance any longer, I reached immediately for my Golden Guide to North\n\nThe revision of these volumes could not come at a more opportune time. In fact, there is a desperate need for a deeper understanding and appreciation of our natural world. Many species are classified as threatened or endangered, and the situation is expected to get much worse before it gets better. Species extinction has always been part of the evolutionary history of life; some organisms adapt to changing circumstances and some do not. However, the current rate of species loss is now estimated to be 1,000–10,000 times the normal “background” rate of extinction since life began on Earth some 4 billion years ago. The primary factor responsible for this decline in biological diversity is the exponential growth of human populations, combined with peoples’ unsustainable appetite for natural resources, such as land, water, minerals, oil, and timber. The world’s human population now exceeds 6 billion, and even though the average birth rate has begun to decline, most demographers believe that the global human population will reach 8–10 billion in the next 50 years. Much of this projected growth will occur in developing countries in Central and South America, Asia and Africa—regions that are rich in unique biological diversity.\n\nGrzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nvii\n\nForeword\n\nFinding solutions to conservation challenges will not be easy in today’s human-dominated world. A growing number of people live in urban settings and are becoming increasingly isolated from nature. They “hunt” in supermarkets and malls, live in apartments and houses, spend their time watching television and searching the World Wide Web. Children and adults must be taught to value biological diversity and the habitats that support it. Education is of prime importance now while we still have time to respond to the impending crisis. There still exist in many parts of the world large numbers of biological “hotspots”—places that are relatively unaffected by humans and which still contain a rich store of their original animal and plant life. These living repositories, along with selected populations of animals and plants held in professionally managed zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens, could provide the basis for restoring the planet’s biological wealth and ecological health. This encyclopedia and the collective knowledge it represents can assist in educating people about animals and their ecological and cultural significance. Perhaps it will also assist others in making deeper connections to nature and spreading biophilia. Information on the conservation status, threats and efforts to preserve various species have been integrated into this revision. We have also included information on the cultural significance of animals, including their roles in art and religion.\n\na system of protected areas where wildlife can roam free from exploitation of any kind.\n\nIt was over 30 years ago that Dr. Bernhard Grzimek, then director of the Frankfurt Zoo in Frankfurt, Germany, edited the first edition of Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia. Dr. Grzimek was among the world’s best known zoo directors and conservationists. He was a prolific author, publishing nine books. Among his contributions were: Serengeti Shall Not Die, Rhinos Belong to Everybody and He and I and the Elephants. Dr. Grzimek’s career was remarkable. He was one of the first modern zoo or aquarium directors to understand the importance of zoo involvement in in situ conservation, that is, of their role in preserving wildlife in nature. During his tenure, Frankfurt Zoo became one of the leading western advocates and supporters of wildlife conservation in East Africa. Dr. Grzimek served as a Trustee of the National Parks Board of Uganda and Tanzania and assisted in the development of several protected areas. The film he made with his son Michael, Serengeti Shall Not Die, won the 1959 Oscar for best documentary.\n\nDr. Grzimek’s hope in publishing his Animal Life Encyclopedia was that it would “...disseminate knowledge of the animals and love for them”, so that future generations would “...have an opportunity to live together with the great diversity of these magnificent creatures.” As stated above, our goals in producing this updated and revised edition are similar. However, our challenges in producing this encyclopedia were more formidable. The volume of knowledge to be summarized is certainly much greater in the twenty-first century than it was in the 1970’s and 80’s. Scientists, both professional and amateur, have learned and published a great deal about the animal kingdom in the past three decades, and our understanding of biological and ecological theory has also progressed. Perhaps our greatest hurdle in producing this revision was to include the new information, while at the same time retaining some of the characteristics that have made Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia so popular. We have therefore strived to retain the series’ narrative style, while giving the information more organizational structure. Unlike the original Grzimek’s, this updated version organizes information under specific topic areas, such as reproduction, behavior, ecology and so forth. In addition, the basic organizational structure is generally consistent from one volume to the next, regardless of the animal groups covered. This should make it easier for users to locate information more quickly and efficiently. Like the original Grzimek’s, we have done our best to avoid any overly technical language that would make the work difficult to understand by non-biologists. When certain technical expressions were necessary, we have included explanations or clarifications.\n\nProfessor Grzimek has recently been criticized by some for his failure to consider the human element in wildlife conservation. He once wrote: “A national park must remain a primordial wilderness to be effective. No men, not even native ones, should live inside its borders.” Such ideas, although considered politically incorrect by many, may in retrospect actually prove to be true. Human populations throughout Africa continue to grow exponentially, forcing wildlife into small islands of natural habitat surrounded by a sea of humanity. The illegal commercial bushmeat trade—the hunting of endangered wild animals for large scale human consumption—is pushing many species, including our closest relatives, the gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees, to the brink of extinction. The trade is driven by widespread poverty and lack of economic alternatives. In order for some species to survive it will be necessary, as Grzimek suggested, to establish and enforce viii\n\nWhile it is clear that modern conservation must take the needs of both wildlife and people into consideration, what will the quality of human life be if the collective impact of short-term economic decisions is allowed to drive wildlife populations into irreversible extinction? Many rural populations living in areas of high biodiversity are dependent on wild animals as their major source of protein. In addition, wildlife tourism is the primary source of foreign currency in many developing countries and is critical to their financial and social stability. When this source of protein and income is gone, what will become of the local people? The loss of species is not only a conservation disaster; it also has the potential to be a human tragedy of immense proportions. Protected areas, such as national parks, and regulated hunting in areas outside of parks are the only solutions. What critics do not realize is that the fate of wildlife and people in developing countries is closely intertwined. Forests and savannas emptied of wildlife will result in hungry, desperate people, and will, in the long-term lead to extreme poverty and social instability. Dr. Grzimek’s early contributions to conservation should be recognized, not only as benefiting wildlife, but as benefiting local people as well.\n\nConsidering the vast array of knowledge that such a work represents, it would be impossible for any one zoologist to have completed these volumes. We have therefore sought specialists from various disciplines to write the sections with Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nForeword\n\nwhich they are most familiar. As with the original Grzimek’s, we have engaged the best scholars available to serve as topic editors, writers, and consultants. There were some complaints about inaccuracies in the original English version that may have been due to mistakes or misinterpretation during the complicated translation process. However, unlike the original Grzimek’s, which was translated from German, this revision has been completely re-written by English-speaking scientists. This work was truly a cooperative endeavor, and I thank all of those dedicated individuals who have written, edited, consulted, drawn, photographed, or contributed to its production in any way. The names of the topic editors, authors, and illustrators are presented in the list of contributors in each individual volume.\n\ndetailed a treatment as did the birds and mammals. Due to practical and financial considerations, the publishers could provide only so much space for each animal group. In such cases, it was impossible to provide more than a broad overview and to feature a few selected examples for the purposes of illustration. To help compensate, we have provided a few key bibliographic references in each section to aid those interested in learning more. This is a common limitation in all reference works, but Grzimek’s Encyclopedia of Animal Life is still the most comprehensive work of its kind.\n\nThe overall structure of this reference work is based on the classification of animals into naturally related groups, a discipline known as taxonomy or biosystematics. Taxonomy is the science through which various organisms are discovered, identified, described, named, classified and catalogued. It should be noted that in preparing this volume we adopted what might be termed a conservative approach, relying primarily on traditional animal classification schemes. Taxonomy has always been a volatile field, with frequent arguments over the naming of or evolutionary relationships between various organisms. The advent of DNA fingerprinting and other advanced biochemical techniques has revolutionized the field and, not unexpectedly, has produced both advances and confusion. In producing these volumes, we have consulted with specialists to obtain the most up-to-date information possible, but knowing that new findings may result in changes at any time. When scientific controversy over the classification of a particular animal or group of animals existed, we did our best to point this out in the text.\n\nI am indebted to the Gale Group, Inc. and Senior Editor Donna Olendorf for selecting me as Series Editor for this project. It was an honor to follow in the footsteps of Dr. Grzimek and to play a key role in the revision that still bears his name. Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia is being published by the Gale Group, Inc. in affiliation with my employer, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA), and I would like to thank AZA Executive Director, Sydney J. Butler; AZA PastPresident Ted Beattie (John G. Shedd Aquarium, Chicago, IL); and current AZA President, John Lewis (John Ball Zoological Garden, Grand Rapids, MI), for approving my participation. I would also like to thank AZA Conservation and Science Department Program Assistant, Michael Souza, for his assistance during the project. The AZA is a professional membership association, representing 215 accredited zoological parks and aquariums in North America. As Director/ William Conway Chair, AZA Department of Conservation and Science, I feel that I am a philosophical descendant of Dr. Grzimek, whose many works I have collected and read. The zoo and aquarium profession has come a long way since the 1970s, due, in part, to innovative thinkers such as Dr. Grzimek. I hope this latest revision of his work will continue his extraordinary legacy.\n\nReaders should note that it was impossible to include as much detail on some animal groups as was provided on others. For example, the marine and freshwater fish, with vast numbers of orders, families, and species, did not receive as\n\nSilver Spring, Maryland, 2001 Michael Hutchins Series Editor\n\nGrzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nix\n\n• • • • •\n\nH ow to use this book\n\nGrzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia is an internationally prominent scientific reference compilation, first published in German in the late 1960s, under the editorship of zoologist Bernhard Grzimek (1909–1987). In a cooperative effort between Gale and the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, the series has been completely revised and updated for the first time in over 30 years. Gale expanded the series from 13 to 17 volumes, commissioned new color paintings, and updated the information so as to make the set easier to use. The order of revisions is: Volumes 8–11: Birds I–IV Volume 6: Amphibians Volume 7: Reptiles Volumes 4–5: Fishes I–II Volumes 12–16: Mammals I–V Volume 3: Insects Volume 2: Protostomes Volume 1: Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes Volume 17: Cumulative Index\n\nOrganized by taxonomy The overall structure of this reference work is based on the classification of animals into naturally related groups, a discipline known as taxonomy—the science in which various organisms are discovered, identified, described, named, classified, and catalogued. Starting with the simplest life forms, the lower metazoans and lesser deuterostomes, in volume 1, the series progresses through the more complex classes of animals, culminating with the mammals in volumes 12–16. Volume 17 is a stand-alone cumulative index. Organization of chapters within each volume reinforces the taxonomic hierarchy. In the case of the volume on Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes, introductory chapters describe general characteristics of all organisms in these groups, followed by taxonomic chapters dedicated to Phylum or Class. Species accounts appear at the end of the taxonomic chapters. To help the reader grasp the scientific arrangement, each type of chapter has a distinctive color and symbol: ■ ⫽ Phylum Chapter (lavender background) ! ⫽ Class Chapter (peach background) x\n\nIntroductory chapters have a loose structure, reminiscent of the first edition. Chapters on taxonomic groups, by contrast, are highly structured, following a prescribed format of standard rubrics that make information easy to find. These chapters typically include: Opening section Scientific name Common name Phylum Class (if applicable) Number of families Thumbnail description Main chapter Evolution and systematics Physical characteristics Distribution Habitat Behavior Feeding ecology and diet Reproductive biology Conservation status Significance to humans Species accounts Common name Scientific name Order Family Taxonomy Other common names Physical characteristics Distribution Habitat Behavior Feeding ecology and diet Reproductive biology Conservation status Significance to humans Resources Books Periodicals Organizations Other Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nHow t o use t his book\n\nColor graphics enhance understanding Grzimek’s features approximately 3,000 color photos, including nearly 110 in the Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes volume; 3,500 total color maps, including approximately 130 in the Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes volume; and approximately 5,500 total color illustrations, including approximately 350 in the Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes volume. Each featured species of animal is accompanied by both a distribution map and an illustration. All maps in Grzimek’s were created specifically for the project by XNR Productions. Distribution information was provided by expert contributors and, if necessary, further researched at the University of Michigan Zoological Museum library. Maps are intended to show broad distribution, not definitive ranges. All the color illustrations in Grzimek’s were created specifically for the project by Michigan Science Art. Expert contributors recommended the species to be illustrated and provided feedback to the artists, who supplemented this information with authoritative references and animal specimens from the University of Michigan Zoological Museum library. In addition to illustrations of species, Grzimek’s features drawings that illustrate characteristic traits and behaviors.\n\nAbout the contributors Virtually all of the chapters were written by scientists who are specialists on specific subjects and/or taxonomic groups. Dennis A. Thoney reviewed the completed chapters to insure consistency and accuracy.\n\nIn addition to IUCN ratings, chapters may contain other conservation information, such as a species’ inclusion on one of three Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) appendices. Adopted in 1975, CITES is a global treaty whose focus is the protection of plant and animal species from unregulated international trade. In the species accounts throughout the volume, the editors have attempted to provide common names not only in English but also in French, German, Spanish, and local dialects.. Grzimek’s provides the following standard information on lineage in the T axonomy rubric of each Species account: [First described as] Actinia xanthogrammica [by] Brandt, [in] 1835, [based on a specimen from] Sitka, Alaska. The person’s name and date refer to earliest identification of a species. If the species was originally described with a different scientific name, the researcher’s name and the date are in parentheses. Readers should note that within chapters, species accounts are organized alphabetically by order name, then by family, and then by genus and species.\n\nAnatomical illustrations While the encyclopedia attempts to minimize scientific jargon, readers will encounter numerous technical terms related to anatomy and physiology throughout the volume. To assist readers in placing physiological terms in their proper context, we have created a number of detailed anatomical drawings that are found within the particular taxonomic chapters to which they relate. Readers are urged to make heavy use of these drawings. In addition, many anatomical terms are defined in the Glossary at the back of the book.\n\nStandards employed In preparing the volume on Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes, the editors relied primarily on the taxonomic structure outlined in Invertebrates, edited by R. C. Brusca, and G. J. Brusca (1990). Systematics is a dynamic discipline in that new species are being discovered continuously, and new techniques (e.g., DNA sequencing) frequently result in changes in the hypothesized evolutionary relationships among various organisms. Consequently, controversy often exists regarding classification of a particular animal or group of animals; such differences are mentioned in the text. Grzimek’s has been designed with ready reference in mind, and the editors have standardized information wherever feasible. For Conservation Status, Grzimek’s follows the IUCN Red List system, developed by its Species Survival Commission. The Red List provides the world’s most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of plants and animals. Using a set of criteria to evaluate extinction risk, the IUCN recognizes the following categories: Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Conservation Dependent, Near Threatened, Least Concern, and Data Deficient. For a complete explanation of each category, visit the IUCN Web page at . Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nAppendices and index In addition to the main text and the aforementioned Glossary, the volume contains numerous other elements. For further reading directs readers to additional sources of information about lower metazoans and lesser deuterostomes. Valuable contact information for Organizations is also included in an appendix. An exhaustive Lower Metazoans and Lesser D euterostomes order list records all orders of lower metazoans and lesser deuterostomes as recognized by the editors and contributors of the volume. And a full-color Geologic time scale helps readers understand prehistoric time periods. Additionally, the volume contains a Subject index.\n\nAcknowledgements Gale would like to thank several individuals for their important contributions to the volume. Dr. Dennis A.

Introduction The Metazoa, today taken as a synonym of Animalia, comprises a large grouping of organisms that may be characterized as being multicellular and heterotrophic, i.e., they do not synthesize their own food, but obtain it from external sources. While there has been some debate in the past, it now seems overwhelmingly likely that the metazoans are monophyletic, and thus that all living examples are descended from an animal that lived some time in the Proterozoic (probably at least 600 million years ago [mya]). Even this statement is controversial, however. Molecular evidence suggests that metazoans had emerged up to one billion years ago or more; but the fossil record is most reasonably read as implying a much later origin, with definitive metazoans not appearing before 600 mya, and perhaps even later. Unfortunately, most “lower” metazoans today lack substantial hard parts such as mineralized shells, so their fossil record is correspondingly very poor. Telling the true time of appearance of such animals just from the fossil record may therefore well be inaccurate.\n\nflection of animal relationships and evolution, although the more thoughtful authors have refrained from definitively stating this. In this view, it makes sense to talk about animal evolution being a more or less stately progress from simple to complex; thus, one can label the simple animals, which are at the bottom of the tree, the “lower” metazoans, and the more advanced ones, the “higher” metazoans. To be more precise, animals without coeloms or segments are typically thought of as being “lower.” These sorts of organisms show a variety of functional adaptations. Sponges and cnidarians typically have some sort of central fluid-filled cavity, which is critical to many roles including support, nutrition, excretion, and reproduction. Small bilaterians, on the other hand, have typically no need of any such system, as they are small enough to\n\nAnimal evolution Because of their long history and enormous adaptability, animals are organized in a remarkable number of different ways, ranging from simple sponges with only a few cell types through to the vertebrates with their complex nervous and immune systems. Indeed, it is possible to arrange animals in a broad series, from organisms that do not possess true tissues (e.g., sponges), through organisms with tissues but no organs (e.g., cnidarians), into the bilaterally symmetrical animals (the Bilateria) with both. The Bilateria typically also possess a central nervous system and muscles; some of them are segmented; and some possess a body cavity called a coelom. The evolution of the animals has long been a contentious issue that has generated a huge number of theories. Nevertheless, at the heart of the issue is whether or not the organizational gradient that can be erected tells anything at all about animal evolution, or whether it merely reflects different adaptive needs of each organism. To put it more simply: are all the simple animals more basal than the more complex ones, or is animal evolution less tidy than that? The traditional assumption has been that organization is indeed a reGrzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nA thre e s tripe d flatwo rm (Ps e udo c e ro s tris triatus ) s ho wing apo s e matic c o lo ratio n.

Although lower metazoans by the definition here lack a true coelom, which can be used as a hydrostatic skeleton, such a tack is replaced either by the use of a rather solid array of muscles, or by some other type of body cavity, such as the so-called pseudocoelom. It should be stressed that this “lower” terminology is a remnant of certain types of eighteenth century views of the world that are in many ways entirely inappropriate to the modern evolutionary ways of thinking about animals. Furthermore, modern systematic practice forbids the use of taxonomic units that are defined by exclusion—lower metazoans defined by being everything except the higher metazoans, which are usually taken as deuterostomes, arthropods, mollusks, and perhaps annelids, together with their close allies. Nevertheless, the central issue of the relationship of overall form to evolution remains unsolved, and, indeed, has been in hot contention since the last years of the twentieth century. 4\n\nThe debate has become sharp because of the introduction of entirely new sources of data that have bearing on the problem, i.e., evidence from molecules. Analysis of the nucleic acids allows a view of animal evolution that is completely, or largely, independent from that provided by classical morphological studies, and the results have sometimes been surprising. The sponges, with their relatively poorly organized morphology, remain basal within the tree, followed by the cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, and allies) and the ctenophores (the comb jellies), although the exact relationships between these three is contentious. All other animals fall into the Bilateria, but the relationships within this group remain highly debated. On a strictly “progressionist” view, the most basal bilaterians would be the flatworms, followed by animals that possess a body cavity that is not fully bounded by mesodermally derived epithelium (i.e., the coelom), followed by the coelomates themselves. However, this view, prevalent among scientists in Great Britain and the United States until a few years ago, was always rejected by many zoologists in GerGrzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\nLanc e le t\n\nWhat are lower met azoans and lesser deut erost omes?\n\nSpo nge\n\nno to c ho rd (s ke le to n) s pic ule s (s ke le to n) Sc allo p She ll (s ke le to n)\n\nDiffe re nt type s o f s ke le to ns .

In their view, the basal metazoans already possessed a coelom and segments, and the bilaterians that lack these features have therefore lost them secondarily. Therefore, there are at least two radically differing views of what a “lower metazoan” is, at least as applied to the bilaterians: one, a relatively simple organism with no through-gut, blood vascular system, or coelom, and another with all of these features present. The advent of molecular systematics has had a dramatic effect on the view of animal relationships, especially within the Bilateria. Two important features stand out. First, the group of lower metazoans referred to collectively as pseudocoelomates, possessing a body cavity that does not fall under the definition of the coelom, is seen to be a highly heteregeneous group. The most surprising aspect of their reassignment has been the proposal that some of them, notably the nematodes and priapulids, are close relatives to the arthropods (forming the Ecdysozoa), displacing the annelids that are traditionally placed in this position. Secondly, at least some of the flatworms have been largely displaced from the base of the tree to form a group loosely related to the annelids and mollusks in a remnant of one of the old branches of the bilaterians, the protostomes. Both these developments lend support to the idea that Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nthe ancestral bilaterians were rather complex. Nevertheless, at least some of the flatworms, the acoels, have now been reinstated at the base of the tree.

Genes that control the layout of the complex morphology, including segments, eyes, and the development of the heart, are all highly conserved between the “higher” metazoans such as the arthropods and chordates. The implication is that these genes are present in the lower bilaterians (and indeed, this has been shown in some cases), and that they may originally have functioned as they do today—implying the very deep origin of the structures these genes now regulate. Such conclusions are controversial, and have by no means been accepted by all, especially morphologists.\n\nSummary\n\nA no rthe rn s e a s tar (As te rias vulgaris ) fe e ding o n s e a urc hin.

While they all have their own specializations, it is possible, and to be hoped for, that they retain some features that were characteristic of the very earliest stages of metazoan and bilaterian evolution. Although it is widely accepted that the sponges are basal within the animals, broadly followed by the ctenophores and cnidarians, the relationships of the bilaterians remain highly controversial. Molecular systematics places the bilaterians into three groups: the Deuterostomia (including, among others, echinoderms and chordates); the Ecdysozoa (principally arthropods and nematodes), and the Trochozoa (annelids, mollusks, most flatworms, and several other small groups, including the brachiopods). At least one group of the flatworms may still be basal within the bilaterians, but the implications this position may have for the evolution of the lower metazoans are presently unclear. The fundamental questions about bilaterian evolution, including the origin of the coelom and segmentation, remain unanswered, and, indeed, as vigorously contested as ever.\n\nResources Books Nielson, C.

Despite claims about their primitive appearance (e.g., simple anatomy, small size), the lower Metazoa collectively displays some of the greatest morphological and developmental diversity within the Animalia. There is also mounting evidence to suggest that the primitiveness of many lower metazoans is a secondary phenomenon, i.e., the lack of complexity is interpreted as a loss of derived features of more complex ancestors. Moreover, many animals once thought to have simple anatomy are now regarded as morphologically complex by way of advanced techniques to explore their organ systems (electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and molecular probes). Still, debate exists over the evolutionary relationships of many of the lower Metazoa, and a proper examination of metazoan origins is necessary to discern the basis of these arguments. The evolutionary origin of the Metazoa has long been a source of major controversy, and several theories have been proposed to explain the phylogenetic jump from unicellular organism to multicellular animal. Ernst Haeckel (1874) was the first biologist to speculate that animals share a common ancestry with unicellular protists, and his subsequent theories on metazoan origins revolve around the perceived similarities between unicellular protists and the process of animal embryology. In Haeckel’s 1866 penultimate work, in which he formulated his fundamental biogenetic law, he posits that embryonic development (ontogeny) recapitulates evolution (phylogeny), or rather, that the development of individuals (from zygote to larva) is a stepwise progression through adult ancestral forms. While the idea of recapitulation (one-to-one correspondence between ontogeny and phylogeny) has in the ensuing period been rejected, developmental characters still play an important role in reconstructing metazoan evolution. Two of Haeckel’s theories on the origin of the Metazoa have relied almost exclusively on developmental characters and the biogenetic law: the cellularization theory and the colonial theory. In Haeckel’s cellularization theory, a ciliate-like ancestor became multicellular through a process of cellularization, i.e., cytokinesis that results in the synchronous formation of many Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\ncells. This organism, variously regarded as planula larva-like (phylum Cnidaria) or even an acoel flatworm (Platyhelminthes, Acoela), served as a model of the metazoan ancestor and was subsequently championed in numerous theories on metazoan evolution (e.g., planula or planuloidacoeloid theory of von Graff in the 1880s and Hyman in the 1950s; the syncytial or ciliate-acoel theory of Hadzi in 1953 and Steinböck in 1963). The implications of these theories are threefold: first, the cnidarian planula larva or adult acoel flatworm represents the most primitive metazoan; second, that acoel flatworms are the link between Cnidaria and the rest of the animal kingdom (Bilateria); and third, that the acoelomate body organization is primitive within the Bilateria. Recent findings using ultrastructural and molecular sequence data have essentially disproved these theories. Haeckel’s second theory, and one that has received more widespread acceptance, is the colonial theory (1874), which states that the most primitive metazoans were derived from a colonial amoeba-like organism (synamoebium) that later became ciliated, similar in appearance to modern-day Volvox (phylum Chlorophyta). While protists such as Volvox are colonial flagellates, and not amoeba-like (phylum Rhizopoda) or ciliated (phylum Ciliophora), they nonetheless have a characteristic hollow, spherical appearance analogous to the blastula stage of metazoan embryos. Haeckel coined this metazoan precursor a “blastaea.” Following his biogenetic law, Haeckel suggested the blastaea evolved into a “gastraea,” a two-layered sac with two germ layers, corresponding to the gastrula stage of animal embryogeny. This theory is important for two reasons: first, it introduced comparative embryology into phylogenetic discussions that would later have prominence in the creation of Protostomia and Deuterostomia; and second, it presupposed the ancestral metazoan to have had primary radial symmetry, as is the case for some primitive metazoans (e.g., Cnidaria). Adding further support to this theory was the discovery of choanoflagellates (phylum Choanoflagellata), a group of protists that possesses a collar complex (a forwardly directed flagellum surrounded by an inverted cone-shaped collar of 30–40 retractile microvilli). The collar complex is interpreted as a synapomorphy uniting Choanoflagellata and Metazoa (=Animalia) because a homologous structure is present in basal metazoans (e.g., the choanocyte layer of sponges). In 1880, the British protozo7\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\nHumans\n\nPro to s to me s\n\nApe s\n\nLo pho tro c ho zo ans\n\nEc dys o zo ans\n\nMammalia\n\nDe ute ro s to me s Re ptilia\n\nAmphibia Pe tro myzo ntida\n\nAc o e l wo rms\n\nMyxino ide a\n\nTriplo blas ts\n\nPlac o zo ans\n\nCrus tac e a\n\nCnidarians\n\nA c lado gram, the mo de rn day ve rs io n o f the tre e\n\nArthro po da\n\nCte no pho re s\n\nEc hino de rmata Anne lida\n\nPo rife ra\n\nThe firs t phylo ge ne tic \" tre e \" trac e d the o rigin o f life to Mo ne ran.

(Illus tratio n by Chris tina St. Clair)\n\nologist Saville-Kent went so far as to consider the sponges (phylum Porifera) as colonial protists derived directly from choanoflagellates. The existence of colonial choanoflagellates such as Proterospongia (Greek: protero = earlier or former) has added fuel to this theory, and since this time, it has remained conventional wisdom that Choanoflagellata is the most likely sister-group of Metazoa. The early radiation of the Metazoa still remains a major puzzle in animal evolution. The earliest known metazoan fossils were once thought to extend only as far back as the Cambrian Period, 540 million years ago (mya). The Cambrian marks a time when most of the major animal phyla first appear in the fossil record. The period of time over which much of this diversification appeared, approximately 30 million years, is relatively rapid compared to the known age of metazoan life (low estimate: 600 million years based on paleon8\n\ntology; high estimate: 1,100 based on molecular clock). Consequently, it is often referred to as the Cambrian explosion. However, intriguing evidence suggests that there was a cryptic Precambrian metazoan history. Some of the most recent finds (Xiao et al., 1998) include the smallest known fossils, in the form of embryos and early larval stages, dating back to the Neoproterozoic (570 mya). These fossils clearly indicate the existence of a fauna prior to the Cambrian explosion, and perhaps allude to the presence of small, planktonic or interstitial organisms that did not readily fossilize. While molecular and fossil evidence verifies Precambrian existence, most of the larger animal phyla clearly diversified during the Cambrian. Some of the earliest molecular studies (Field et al., 1988; Christen et al., 1991) also provided evidence to suggest that the Metazoa was diphyletic, and that two subkingdoms, Radiata and Bilateria, arose independently from flagellated protozoa in the Precambrian. Both terms allude to the aniGrzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\nArtis t’ s re nditio n o f Pre c ambrian life fo rms bas e d o n fo s s ils fro m the Ediac ara Hills o f So uth Aus tralia.

These ground-pattern characteristics are still found in basal and derived metazoans, despite up to one billion years of animal evolution. As of recent times, most phyla are considered monophyletic, i.e., a clade consisting of an ancestral species and all its descendants and all sharing a characteristic combination of specific anatomical features (Nielsen, 2003).\n\nSystematics of lower Metazoa Molecular, morphological, and paleontological evidence suggests the most primitive phyla are found within two paraphyletic groups, Parazoa and Radiata. The Parazoa includes two phyla, Porifera and Placozoa, which display the most primitive grade of organization and are at the base of the evolutionary tree. The Radiata contains the radiate phyla, Cnidaria and Ctenophora, the first true metazoans prior to the evolution of the bilateral body plan in the Precambrian. Some enigmatic groups with questionable affinities to either Radiata or Bilateria include the Monoblastozoa, Orthonectida, and Rhombozoa, often included under the name Mesozoa. The Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nlargest assemblage of animals is found within the Bilateria, a monophylum consisting of two large clades, Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Branching order within these clades is unresolved, though molecular evidence indicates the Protostomia may be subdivided into Ecdysozoa (molting animals) and Lophotrochozoa (ciliated animals). Lophotrochozoa contains several phyla, including the Lophophorata, a superphylum of Brachiopoda, Ectoprocta and Phoronida, still considered by many authors to be deuterostomes. Additionally, subordinate clades within the Protostomia define certain groups of lower Metazoa. These groups go by a variety of names, including Aschelminthes, Nemathelminthes, Gnathifera, Cycloneuralia, Introverta, and Cephalorhyncha. Nemathelminthes and Aschelminthes are older terms proposed in 1859 and 1910, respectively, to consume a variety of acoelomate and pesudocoelomate taxa; neither group is considered monophyletic. The monophylum Gnathifera was erected in 1995 to include three phyla, Gnathostomulida, Rotifera, and Acanthocephala. The Micrognathozoa, discovered in 2002, is now included in this clade, and some biologists also place the Chaetognatha within Gnathifera. Cycloneuralia includes six acoelomate and pseudocoelomate taxa: Gastrotricha, Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Kinorhyncha, Loricifera, and Priapulida. The Introverta makes up a subset of Cycloneuralia, and Cephalorhyncha is yet a smaller subset of Introverta. Phyla of uncertain taxonomic affinity include the Entoprocta and 9\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\nCycliophora. Some biologists consider entoprocts closely related to ectoprocts or a sister taxon of Cycliophora. Within Deuterostomia, subordinate clades include Lophophorata (also considered protostomes), Neorenalia, and Cyrotreta. The animal, Xenoturbella bocki, is perhaps the most enigmatic bilaterian to date, being variously regarded as a species of protobranch bivalve (Mollusca), member of the Acoela (Platyhelminthes), relative of acorn worms (Enteropneusta) and Holothuroidea (Echinodermata), or as the most basal bilaterian; Xenoturbella’s affinities remain undetermined. The Parazoa (Greek: para = beside, zoa = animals, Metazoa) includes animals with the most primitive grade of organization: they lack definable nervous systems, true tissues, or organ systems, and epithelia do not rest on a basement membrane. Sponges (phylum Porifera) are the most basal parazoans. According to some researchers, sponges are little more than colonial choanoflagellates, but arguments can be made to classify sponges as more advanced than colonial, heterotrophic eurkaryotes such as Proterospongia. Sponges contain many more specialized cell types (including sex cells similar to other metazoans), have at least a rudimentary ability to form tissue-like epithelia via septate junctions (between choanocytes), and undergo an embryonic process of tissue formation (though probably not homologous to gastrulation of eumetazoa). The Porifera is a well-defined monophylum characterized by two synapomorphies, cellular totipotency and acquiferous systems of choanocyte chambers. Nearly all sponges are benthic, sessile suspension-feeders with the exception of Asbestopluma, a carnivorous demosponge. More than 5,000 living species of sponge are known globally, and many more fossil species exist, some dating as far back as 600 mya. Four sponge-like fossil groups are well known to have produced massive reef-like structures back in the early Paleozoic (550–480 mya): archaeocyathans, stromatoporids, sphinctozoans, and chaetetids. Unlike Porifera, the phylum Placozoa has no known fossil record. Discovered in 1883, Trichoplax adhaerens, the only known member of Placozoa, is best characterized as a minute (0.07–0.11 in [2–3 mm]), flattened bag of epithelial cells with dorso-ventral polarity and no anterior-posterior polarity or symmetry. The outer epithelium is composed of monociliate cells (one cilium per cell) interconnected with belt desmosomes and perhaps septate junctions. The narrow space between epithelial layers is filled with a gel-like mesenchyme. Asexual and sexual reproduction is known, but details of sexual reproduction are incomplete. The existence of striated ciliary rootlets in the monociliate cells suggests an evolutionary link to eumetazoans, and the lack of autapomorphies defining the placozoan body plan suggests a placozoan-like ancestor may have given rise to the Eumetazoa. Eumetazoa (Greek: eu = good) refers to the remaining animal groups, approximately 30 phyla. Eumetazoans share several synapomorphies, including a synaptic nervous system, gap junctions between cells, a basal lamina, striated myofibrils, organized gonads, definable germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm), and body symmetry. The Cnidaria is the most basal eumetazoan phylum and contains approximately 10,000 extant species and several thousand fossil species. The fossil 10\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\nrecord extends back to the Precambrian (540 mya), though many fossils, especially those of Ediacara and Burgess Shale, have questionable affinities to the Cnidaria. The phylum is defined by at least three synapomorphies: cnidae (nematocysts), planula larva, and coelenteron with mouth surrounded by tentacles. Other synapomorphies might characterize the group, depending on one’s view of the interrelationships. The phylum is traditionally divided into four classes: Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, and Anthozoa. Body morphology is highly variable within the classes but is generally a variation on one or two basic body plans: polyp and medusa. Polyps are generally sessile, benthic forms with a ring of tentacles around the mouth, although some polyps have become colonial and taken up a pelagic existence (e.g., Velella velella). The medusa, or jellyfish, is often a flattened disc-shaped animal that lives in the water column, though some species have adopted a polypoid form and become benthic (Haliclystus). The polyp may be a sexual form that produces gametes (e.g., Anthozoa) or an asexual form that produces medusae (e.g., Cubozoa, Schyphozoa, Hydrozoa). Only polyps within Anthozoa form large reefs in mostly tropical seas. Interrelationships within the phylum are contentious. Two prominent theories on the origin of Cnidaria have become established: the medusa theory and the polyp theory. The medusa theory postulates that the cnidarian ancestor was a planula-like animal that first gave rise to the medusoid form, subsequently followed by evolution of the polyp stage. Such a scenario places the trachyline hydrozoans as basal cnidarians, and therefore the medusoid body form would be a synapomorphy of the phylum. The polyp theory states that the polypoid form is ancestral, and therefore the Anthozoa is the most basal group within the phylum. In this scenario, Anthozoa is a paraphyletic taxon and the medusoid form is a synapomorphy of more derived clades within the Cnidaria. These theories have played important roles in the understanding of metazoan evolution, particularly regarding the origin of flatworms, the origin of the coelom, and the origin of mesodermal muscles (Rieger, 1986). The triploblasts, or Triploblastica (Greek: triplo = three, blast = bud), refer to phyla that possess three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) formed during gastrulation, though mesoderm is probably not homologous between protostomes and deuterostomes. Prior to 1985, the phylum Ctenophora was generally considered a diploblastic phylum because true mesoderm (entomesoderm) was not found; however, subsequent studies have revealed the presence of mesoderm during embryogeny. Ctenophora is considered the most primitive of the triploblastic phyla because it is hypothesized to have originated prior to the evolution of the bilateral body plan. Ctenophora is a small phylum of approximately 80 gelatinous animals known as comb jellies and sea gooseberries. Their paleontological history extends back to the Cambrian. The phylum is well defined by the presence of adhesive colloblasts, eight rows of ciliary plates, a unique apical sense organ, and a cydippid larval stage. Interrelationships among the seven inclusive orders are not well resolved, and there is disagreement around which form of ctenophore is most primitive, the tentaculate or atentactulate form. The ctenophore body plan has played a historical role in various Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\ntheories on metazoan evolution (e.g., ctenophore-polyclad theory, ctenophore-trochophore theory). The Bilateria (Greek: bi = two, latus = side) is a welldefined monophylum characterized by a bilaterally symmetric body plan, a pronounced antero-posterior axis, and cephalization (brain). The phylum Platyhelminthes has figured prominently in nearly all discussions of the origin and relationships of the Bilateria. Originally classified within the taxon Vermes by Linnaeus in his 1735 book, Systema Naturae, the Platyhelminthes has since had a contentious history. In 1851 Vogt was first to isolate the phylum (with the nemerteans) into a single taxon called Platyelmia, later changed to Platyelminthes (now Platyhelminthes) by Gregenbaur in 1859. Platyhelminthes was subsequently erected to phylumlevel status containing four classes: Turbellaria, Nemertea, Trematoda, and Cestoda. Minot (1876) later dropped Nemertea from this taxon. As of recent times, the Platyhelminthes contains close to 20,000 species of free-living and parasitic flatworms, with very little fossil record. The phylum is divided into three monophyletic clades: Acoelomorpha, Catenulida, and Rhabditophora. The terms Acoelomorpha and Rhabditophora are recent systematic additions to the platyhelminth literature (Ehlers, 1985). Acoelomorphs include the subclades (orders) Acoela and Nemertodermatida, and Rhabditophora includes all remaining groups (free living and parasitic), with the exception of Catenulida. Historically, the Catenulida, both acoelomorph taxa, and all free-living groups of Rhabditophora (approximately nine orders) made up class Turbellaria; however, since recently, the Turbellaria is considered paraphyletic and there is little agreement on its precise composition because of the lack of well-defined synapomorphies. Turbellarian worms are best characterized as lower platyhelminths with a ciliated epidermis and most use cilia for locomotion. The remaining parasitic classes within the Rhabditophora are often referred to together as Neodermata (Latin: neo = new, derm = skin), in reference to their tegument. Class Trematoda historically contained all parasitic flukes (endo- and ectoparasites), but has subsequently been changed to include only the digenetic and aspidogastrean flukes. Class Monogenea contains only monogenetic flukes, and class Cestoda contains the tapeworms. Relationships among all major clades and classes are unknown and highly speculative. Morphological and molecular data argue for a major restructuring of the Platyhelminthes, particularly in the removal of the taxon name Turbellaria, recognition of its (potentially) evolutionary independent clades, and a search for synapomorphies to unite the major taxa. Arguments based on molecular data, mostly sequence data in the form of 18S rDNA, assert a polyphyletic Platyhelminthes, with complete removal of the Acoelomorpha and its transference to a position at the base of the Bilateria. Morphologists recognize the uniqueness of the Acoelomorpha, but contend removal from the phylum is not yet warranted. They emphasize the search for shared, derived characters to unite the three main clades, and assume a cladistic stance that accentuates the similarities that unite taxa (synapomorphies), not the differences that separate them. Potential synapomorphies exist at different levels within the phylum. According to Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\nRieger and Ladurner (2001), the mode of epidermal replacement during growth or general maintenance appears to be unique to the Platyhelminthes. New epidermal cells arise from neoblasts below the body wall, instead of from dividing epidermal cells as occurs in all other metazoans. Tyler (2001) mentions the unregionalized sac-like gut as a potential autapomorphy of the phylum, and the structure of the hermaphroditic reproductive system and presence of biflagellate spermatozoa may be synapomorphies of Acoelomorpha and Rhabditophora. Within the Rhabditophora, the exclusively parasitic classes, Trematoda, Monogenea, and Cestoda, are related by the shared presence of a syncytial tegument that arises through the developmental replacement of the larval epidermis. Relationships among the smaller clades of free-living and symbiotic “turbellarians” are still a work in progress. The phylogenetic position of the Platyhelminthes remains unknown and will likely prevail as the main topic of discussion among biologists interested in the origins and early radiation of the Metazoa. Enigmatic animals such as Xenoturbella and the turbellariomorph annelid, Lobatocerebrum, along with enteropneust models proposed by Tyler (2001), may also figure prominently in understanding platyhelminth evolution. The phylum Nemertea is a small group of approximately 900 predatory worms occupying marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. There is no reliable fossil record. Nemerteans have been known since 1758, but it was not until 1876 that they were recognized as a group distinct from the turbellarian flatworms. The monophyletic nature of Nemertea is confirmed by the presence of their unique proboscis apparatus, but other synapomorphies may exist depending on their accepted theory of origin. Two classes exist, Anopla and Enopla, based on the structure of the proboscis and the position of the proboscis pore. The Anopla is generally considered primitive to the Enopla and may be a paraphyletic taxon since the defining features are symplesiomorphies. Relationships to other metazoans are less well known. Spiral cleavage and the presence of a true coelom place the nemerteans within the Protostomia, but questions have been raised as to the homology of the nemertean coelom (rhynchocoel, bloodvessel system) with other protostomes. The traditional placement of Nemertea close to the Platyhelminthes is often favored because both groups are functionally acoelomate, though no synapomorphies are evident. The clade Gnathifera contains four phyla defined by the ultrastructure of jaw-like elements in the mouth, though the orientation and number of elements are phylum specific. Historically, Rotifera is the best-known group of gnathiferans, containing approximately 2,000 species of exclusively microscopic, pseudocoelomate animals with a ciliated wheel-like organ on their head (Latin: rota = wheel, fera = bearer). The fossil record is sparse and only dates back to the Eocene epoch (54 mya) where animals are preserved in Dominican amber. The phylum is monophyletic and characterized by the ciliated corona, a retrocerebral organ, and unique jaw structure. Some researchers prefer to include the phylum Acanthocephala within the Rotifera based on the shared presence of an intracytoplasmic lamina and anterior flagellum on the sperm. The name Syndermata is often used to refer to both phyla together. Acanthocephala consists of approximately 11\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\njaw structure. A fossil record is lacking. Micrognathozoa is the most recent group of gnathiferans to be discovered, described by Reinhardt Kristensen and Peter Funch in 2000. The group consists of microscopic, ciliated, jawed worms found in a cold spring at Disko Island, Greenland. Only a single species has been described, Limnognathia maerski. The authors chose to treat Micrognathozoa as a class within the phylum Gnathifera, relegating the phyla Rotifera, Acanthocephala, and Gnathostomulida to classes within Gnathifera. Gnathostomulida is the sister group to the clade containing Micrognathozoa, Acanthocephala, and Rotifera. Cycloneuralia is a morphologically defined clade containing Gastrotricha, Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Priapula, Kinorhyncha, and Loricifera. Molecular evidence indicates the clade is paraphyletic, but several potential synapomorphies exist: terminal mouth, radial pharynx, and tripartite peripharyngeal brain. The phylum Gastrotricha is the most primitive group of cycloneuralians, and the one often considered having the weakest affiliation with the clade. Gastrotrichs are microscopic (0.003–0.11 in [0.1–3 mm]) ciliated worms that bear cuticular adhesive organs. There is no fossil record. Synapomorphies defining the small phylum of approximately 600 species include a multilayered cuticle that covers the cilia, tube-like dual-gland adhesive organs, the unique structure of their sensory cilia, and helicoidal muscles that surround the digestive tract. The two orders within the phylum are monophyletic. Relationships of gastrotrichs to specific clades within the Protostomia are uncertain; the possession of both a cuticle and external cilia places gastrotrichs in an intermediate position between Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa.\n\nMiddle Silurian c rino ids (Callio c rinus c ro nutus ) bas e d o n fo s s ils fro m the Rac ine Do lo mite o f the Chic ago -Milwauke e are a.

Traditionally, acanthocephalans were closely aligned with turbellarians or Aschelminthes, but recent studies support the sister-group relationship of Acanthocephala and Rotifera. If considered part of Gnathifera, acanthocephalans must be considered highly derived, having lost the main gnathiferan characteristic (jaws) in their evolution towards parasitism. Autapomorphies of Acanthocephala include a hook-bearing proboscis with unique ligament system and the absence of a gut. The phylum is traditionally divided into three classes, though relationships among the classes are poorly known. Gnathostomulids were first described in 1956 by Peter Ax as turbellarians, but later raised to phylum status in 1969. The phylum is small, containing approximately 100 species divided into two monophyletic classes and characterized by the unique 12\n\nOnce considered closely related to Gastrotricha, phylum Nematoda (also Nemata) is the largest phylum of cycloneuralians, containing greater than 20,000 described species. Together with its sister group Nematomorpha, these two phyla form a basal group within the Introverta, a subclade of Cycloneuralia defined by the loss of external cilia, a molted cuticle, and an introvert (an anterior part of the head than can be invaginated). The Nematoda is monophyletic and well defined by the presence of sensory organs called amphids and a unique form of excretory system (renette cells). The presence of an introvert is not often considered part of the ground pattern of the phylum (only known in Kinonchulus), so relationships to other Introverta are tenuous based on this character. The fossil record is sparse and dates back only to the Carboniferous Period (354–290 mya). Molecular evidence suggests the class of predominantly marine, free-living nematodes, Adenophorea, may be paraphyletic as it includes the ancestors of Secernentea, the class of terrestrial parasites. The closely related phylum, Nematomorpha, contains approximately 325 species of exclusively parasitic worms, often called horsehair worms. The phylum is defined by the presence of a unique larval stage that parasitizes arthropods, and an adult body devoid of a gut. The fossil record is sparse and extends only back to the Eocene (15–45 mya). Nematomorphs share several characteristics with nematodes that suggest a sister-group relationship: collagenous cuticle without microvilli, absence of circular muscles, and ectodermal longitudinal cords. According to some zoologists, nematomorphs may have evolved from the mermithoid nematodes that they resemble. Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\nThe Cephalorhyncha, a sub-clade of Introverta within the Cycloneuralia, contains the phyla Priapula, Kinorhyncha, and Loricifera. These phyla are united by the shared presence of chitin in their cuticles, of rings of scalids on their introverts, flosculi, and two rings of introvert retractor muscles attached through their brains. Phylum Priapula is the most primitive of the cephalorhynchs, contains fewer than 20 extant species, and has an extensive fossil record. Recent species range in size from minute to inches (millimeters to centimeters) and are exclusively benthic predators. Autapomorphies of Priapula include a large body cavity containing amoebocytes and erthryocytes, and perhaps the unique structure of their urogenital system. The fossil record for priapulans is unique within the Cycloneuralia because it extends back to the Cambrian: Ottoia prolifica is the most abundant fossil species and closely resembles the extant Halicryptus spinulosus. The two remaining phyla, Kinorhyncha and Loricifera, are closely united by the structure of their introvert, which actually protrudes out rather than evaginates out (turns inside out by eversion of an inner surface) as in priapulans. The Kinorhyncha is a small phylum of approximately 150 species, all microscopic with a body composed of 13 segments, and with an internally segmented musculature and nervous system. Despite the tough cuticle, no fossilized kinorhynchs have been found. Reinhardt Kristensen, the co-discoverer of Micrognathozoa and Cycliophora, first described Loriciferans in 1983. The Loricifera is a small phylum of 100 species characterized by scalids (spines) with intrinsic muscles and a lifecycle with a Higgins larva. No fossils are known. The phyla Entoprocta and Cycliophora comprise a monophylum, according to cladistic studies. Phylum Entoprocta consists of 150 extant species and few fossilized forms that extend back to the Upper Jurassic (200 mya). Species are either individual or colonies of globular polyps with ciliated tentacles on a short stalk. Entoprocts are functionally acoelomate but may have small pseudocoelic sinuses. Embryonic cleavage is clearly of the spiral pattern and results in a trochophore larva, placing entoprocts within the Protostomia. Traditionally, entoprocts were allied with ectoprocts in the phylum Bryozoa, but a lack of synapomorphies led to their eventual separation in 1921. Danish biologist Claus Nielsen (2001) still supports a close relationship between the taxa and suggests several possible synapomorphies: myoepithelial cells in the apical organ, similar metamorphosis, and the ultrastructure of larval eyes. Cladistic studies have pointed out a potential relationship to Cycliophora, a recently discovered phylum of symbiotic micrometazoans that live on the mouthparts of lobsters (Funch and Kristensen, 1995). The phylum is characterized by a highly complicated lifecycle involving asexual female stages, sexual female stages, sexual dwarf males, and a variety of larval forms (pandora larvae, chordoid larvae). The chordoid larva is thought to be homologous with the typical protostome trochophore larva, and may have developed neotenically from entoprocts, according to some researchers. A single synapomorphy unites the two phyla: mushroomshaped extensions from the basal lamina into the epidermis. The Deuterostomia is a morphologically well-defined group with a long fossil history. Traditionally, the Deuterostomia is characterized by embryological criteria such as radial Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\ncleavage (a symplesiomorphy), blastopore becomes the anus, enterocoelous archenteric mesoderm, and a tripartite coelom. The deuterostome clade generally includes the Chaetognatha, Lophophorata (Brachiopoda, Ectoprocta, Phoronida), Hemichordata (Enteropneusta, Pterobranchia), Echinodermata, and Chordata. Several phyla, namely Chaetognatha and the lophophorate groups, share characteristics with both protostomes and deuterostomes, and their phylogenetic affinities are muddled. The advent of molecular phylogenetics in the 1990s also raised several questions regarding traditional deuterostome relationships. The hemichordates, echinoderms, and chordates make up a characteristic clade of derived deuterostomes defined by at least five synapomorphies, depending on views about their evolutionary origins: glomerular complex, epithelia that binds iodine and secretes iodothyrosine, separate gonoducts, pharyngeal gill slits, and a dorsally concentrated nervous system. The Hemichordata is a small phylum of a few hundred species, with a fossil record dating back to the Cambrian, and generally considered monophyletic by the presence of an anterior evagination of the gut called the stomochord. Brusca and Brusca (2002) consider the glomerulur complex, an excretory organ comprising a heart and blood vessel network in the prosome of the proboscis, an additional synapomorphy, but Nielsen (2001) regards it as a synapomorphy of Neorenalia (= Deuterostomia: Hemichordata + Echinodermata + Chordata). Nielsen also considers the Hemichordata to be polyphyletic with pterobranchs forming the sister group of Echinodermata. Alternatively, molecular studies suggest that enteropneusts and echinoderms are sister groups, or echinoderms are the closest sister group to the chordates. Despite their extensive fossil record extending to the Cambrian, echinoderms and chordates have been notoriously difficult in terms of identifying a closest sister group. Echinoderms are defined primarily by the endoskeletal system of plates with a stereom structure, and external ciliary grooves for suspension feeding. Two extinct groups, the Carpoids and Helicoplacoids, are basal groups with the phylum. According to some authors, the Carpoids represent the ancestor to most fossil and modern echinoderms, but the lack of radial symmetry and evidence of a water vascular system make their presence within the phylum debatable. The Helicoplacoids, however, had triradial symmetry and water vascular systems with open ambulacral grooves, and are so considered basal echinoderms. The six remaining classes are united by the characteristic pentaradial symmetry, with mouth and anus on oral surface, and attachment to the substratum by the aboral surface. According to the paleontologist R. P. S. Jefferies (1986), a group of extinct echinoderms called calcichordates gave rise to the chordate lineage. Jefferies claims to have identified chordate-like structures such as gill slits, a brain, notochord, and dorsal nerve cord in fossils of calcichordates. This calcichordate theory is still hotly contested, although many paleontologists have rejected the theory because they do not accept Jefferies’ identification of the chordate features in these extinct echinoderms. The traditional branching of the chordate line is generally well accepted with Urochordata arising first, followed by Cephalochordata and Vertebrata. The 13\n\nEvolut ion and syst emat ics\n\ncephalochordate-vertebrate line is hypothesized to have evolved via paedomorphosis from a urochordate-like ancestor. Some zoologists even prefer Garstang’s theory (1928) that vertebrates evolved directly from a larval urochordate by paedomorphosis.

Each animal species can be viewed as a collection of individuals, all sharing a common pool of genes. The genes determine all of the animal’s characteristics, and are made of the complex molecule known as DNA. The genes are exchanged among the members of the species through a variety of mechanisms, all of which are related in some way to the process of reproduction. For this reason, the ability to reproduce is often considered to be one of the most important defining characteristics of life. But reproduction, like most basic biological functions, occurs primarily at the level of a single individual that may interact with another individual to exchange genetic information through the transfer of DNA. This individual parent animal reproduces to form another new individual offspring. The offspring, however, begins its individual life as a single cell rather than as a multicellular animal like its parent. If it is to reproduce, it must usually become multicellular as well, and must ultimately mature to be anatomically similar to its parent. This entire cycle of development is generally known as the life history of an individual animal. In other words, the life history of any individual animal comprises the processes of reproduction and development; in turn, each of these processes is broken down into other more specific processes, each designed to accomplish a particular function.\n\nAsexual reproduction Fundamentally, reproduction is the copying of an individual animal’s DNA combined with transferring the copy into a newly formed individual. In some cases, the copy of the DNA is nearly exact, and the offspring develop from a single parent. This is typically the case in what is known as asexual reproduction. In its truest form, asexual reproduction involves simple cell division, or mitosis, without any reorganization of DNA fragments during the process. Asexual reproduction also involves only one parent, and thus involves no new combinations of genes resulting from mixing complementary genes from two parents. Asexual reproduction has the advantage of allowing a very fast rate of reproduction, with a resulting rapid increase in the population of a given species. The primary disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that it does not permit much genetic variability; as a result, the population as a whole Grzimek ’s Animal Life Encyclopedia\n\nis relatively unable to adapt to diverse or changing environmental conditions.\n\nSexual reproduction In most cases, the DNA copy is not exact, so that the genetic makeup of the newly formed offspring differs from that of its parent. This programmed variability is accomplished primarily by sexual reproduction. The genetic process that defines sexual reproduction occurs only during a very brief specialized phase of cell division, and only within cells belonging to the germ cell line. A germ cell is defined as a cell belonging to a cellular lineage that, at some point, will deviate from normal cell division (i.e., mitosis, which results in exact duplicate copies of DNA) to engage in meiosis. Meiosis is often known as reductional division, because it results in reducing the number of chromosomes by half in preparation for an exchange with the complementary chromosome of a mating partner that restores the full set. The most important aspect of meiosis, however, occurs long before this reduction of chromosome number, which occurs late in meiosis. Early in meiosis, gene segments are actually recombined by the exchange of DNA sequences, so that the individual chromosomes are transformed into genetically unique combinations of genes. This process is known as crossing over; it is the defining event that distinguishes sexual from asexual reproduction. In this way, germ cells become genetically unique while they are still in the parent animal, long before they become fully formed sperm or oocytes, and even longer before they fuse with gametes from another parent. At the later point of gamete fusion, the recombined genes in the chromosomes from two parents will fertilize each other to produce new chromosome combinations. Thus, the genetic recombination that takes place during meiosis, combined with the reaggregation of the chromosomes that occurs during fertilization, results in the distinctive offspring that characterize most animals. It is important, however, to recognize that sexual reproduction does not require either fertilization or two parents. If meiosis takes place, the reproduction is sexual. In some lower metazoans, a single parent animal may produce gametes by meiosis, which can then develop into fully formed offspring by various processes known collectively as sexual parthenogenesis. 15\n\nReproduct ion, development , and life hist ory\n\nVol. 1 : Lower M et azoans and Lesser Deut erost omes\n\nHydras re pro duc e by budding. (Illus tratio n by Barbara Dupe rro n)\n\nReproductive duality Many animals, particularly the lower metazoans, actually use both asexual and sexual reproduction at various times. This reproductive duality gives them the advantages of both modes. It is rare for both asexual and sexual reproduction to occur simultaneously, however. In many lower metazoans, the asexual and sexual processes are cyclical, occurring in different seasons. Examples include many marine sponges (phylum Porifera), in which a single individual may alternate between reproductive modes. Another example may be seen among the freshwater rotifers (phylum Rotifera), in which the two reproductive modes will be restricted to sequential generations that are otherwise anatomically similar. In other lower metazoan groups, asexual and sexual processes are segregated into two distinct stages in the life history, with radically different anatomical and behavioral traits, or even different habitats. The best examples of these stages are found among the hydroids and jellyfishes (phylum Cnidaria), and among the parasitic flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes). Since the life history stages responsible for asexual and sexual phases a"
