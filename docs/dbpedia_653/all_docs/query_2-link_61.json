        "text": "The word “dugong” comes from the Malay language, where it is called “duyung”. The term “duyung” is thought to have originated from the Old Javanese word “duyungon”, which means “lady of the sea”.\n\nThe Malay language has a significant influence on the languages spoken in the Southeast Asian region. As a result, the word “duyung” was adopted by other languages in the region, such as Indonesian and Tagalog.\n\nWhen the term was introduced into English, it was initially spelled as “dugong” instead of “duyung”. The exact reason for this change in spelling is unknown, but it is believed that it may have been due to the difficulty of transliterating certain Malay sounds into English.\n\nEach living creature is classified first according to one of the overarching 7 kingdoms (Bacteria, Archaea, Protozoa, Chromista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia). From there it is gradually separated and divided all the way down to the individual species level. This is done to assist scientists when they study specific species to know what it is and to effectively communicate their findings without creating confusion.\n\nKingdom:\n\nThe Dugong is first classied as an animal (Animalia)\n\nPhylum:\n\nIt is further an animal with a vertebrae or backbone (Chordata)\n\nClass:\n\nAs a Vertebrate is is classified toether with the mammals (Mammalia), due to specific criteria, such as giving live birth and feeding the young milk.\n\nOrder:\n\nBased on several characteristics, it is further classified in the Order Sirenia. One of these characteristics is that it is a mammal that can live in water and has a herbivorous diet. The dugong shares the Order with the Manatee.\n\nFamily:\n\nThe Order is split into two Families with the dugong therefore being the only member within the Dugongidae Family and Genus\n\nEach of the species, no matter from which Kingdom, has two words in its scientific name. This helps with the exact naming and identification. This naming process is called scientific nomenclature.\n\nThe nomenclature of this species means\n\nFamily – Dugongidae: Meaning those of to the Dugong. The suffix “-idae” is used in taxonomy to denote a family of organisms. It comes from the Greek word “eidos”, which means “form” or “species”.\n\nGenus – Dugong: A similar root as the Family name\n\nSpecies Name – Dugong dugon: The word “Dugong” comes from the Malay language, where it is called “duyung”.\n\nAccording to the current scientific classification, there is 1 species with n0 subspecies."
