In what phylum & kingdom are the vertebrates found? ANIMAL\n\n2. List the classes of vertebrates. LAMPREYS, HAGFISH, MYRINI\n\n3. Discuss the characteristics of chordates & vertebrates.\n\nThe subphylum Vertebrata consists of about 43,700 species of animals with backbones. Vertebrates exhibit all three of the chordate characteristics at some point during their lives. The embryonic notochord is replaced by a vertebral column in the adult.\n\n4. What were the 1st vertebrates & describe them?\n\nThe first vertebrates were fishlike. Fishes are aquatic, gill-breathing vertebrates that usually have fins and skin covered with scales. The larval form of a modern-day lamprey, which looks like a lancelet,\n\n5. Sketch a lamprey & describe the characteristics of this fish. Where are they found?\n\nThese long, eel-like, jawless fish are free-swimming predators on other fish. Lampreys hatch in freshwater and many live their lives entirely in freshwater\n\n6. Describe a hagfish.\n\nHagfish lack jaws,\n\nHagfish have long, slender bodies, measuring 16-32 inches long. Their eyes, located under their skin, are rudimentary, deeming them virtually blind\n\n7. In what group are lampreys & hagfish found & why?\n\nclassified with the lampreys in a group called the Agnatha (\"no jaws\") or the Cyclostomata (\"round mouth\").\n\n8. Do agnathans have paired fins? no they have a scaleless, eel-like body without paired fins\n\n9. What were the 1st jawed fish & describe them. the cartilaginous fish & The class Chondrichthyes contains approximately 850 species of skates, rays, and sharks. They have jaws, lots of teeth, paired fins, and a cartilage endoskeleton. Cartilaginous fish first appeared during the Devonian Period and expanded in diversity during the Carboniferous and Permian before nearly disappearing during the great extinction that occurred near the end of the Permian.\n\n10. What are the 2 classes of jawed fish?\n\nthe cartilaginous fish and the bony fish\n\n11. What is in the class Chondrichthyes & what traits do they have in common.\n\nskates, rays, and sharks.They have jaws, lots of teeth, paired fins, and a cartilage endoskeleton.\n\n12. Sketch & describe sharks.\n\nThe great white shark feeds on dolphins, sea lions and seals (and people sometimes)\n\n13. Sketch a ray or skate & describe them.\n\nThe electric ray family can feed on fish that have been stunned with electric shock of over 300 volts. Sawfish rays have a large anterior \"saw\" that they use to slash through schools of fish.\n\n14. Name the class for bony fish.\n\nOsteichthyes\n\n15. Name the 2 groups of bony fish.\n\nhe lobe-finned (Sarcopterygii) and ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii)\n\n16. Give several examples of ray-finned fish & describe them.\n\nThe ray-finned fish include familiar species such as tuna, bass, perch, and trout. Ray-finned fish are the most successful and diverse of the vertebrates (more than half of all vertebrate species belong to this group). Thin, bony supports with radiating bones (hence the term ray-finned) hold the fins away from the body. Ray-finned fish obtain their food by filter feeding and by preying on insects and other animals. Their skin is covered by scales formed of bone. These scales are homologous to our own hair (and the feathers of birds), being derived from the same embryonic tissues.\n\n17. Name 2 lobe-finned fish & describe both of them.\n\nlungfishes and one species of coelacanth that has muscular fins with large, jointed bones attaching the fins to the body. Lobe-finned fish have fleshy fins supported by central bones, homologous to the bones in your arms and legs.\n\n18. What was the 1st group of vertebrates to move onto land? What is in this group?\n\nterrestrail,\n\n19. Describe characteristics of amphibians.\n\n20. Amphibians are ectotherms. What does this mean?\n\nLimbs with girdles of bone that are adapted for walking on land.\n\nA tongue that can be used for catching prey as well as sensory input.\n\nEyelids that help keep the eyes moist.\n\nEars adapted for detecting sound waves moving through the thin (as compared to water) medium of the air.\n\n21. How are amphibians still linked to water?\n\nAmphibians (class Amphibia, from Amphi- meaning \"on both sides\" and -bios meaning \"life\"), such as frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians, are ectothermic (or cold-blooded) animals that metamorphose from a juvenile water-breathing form.\n\n22. What is in the class Reptilia?\n\nReptilia\n\n23. Reptiles do not need water for reproduction. Explain why this is true.\n\nReptiles have internal fertilization: their gametes do not need to be released into water for fertilization to occur.\n\n24. Describe the amniote egg of reptiles. Include a labeled sketch of the egg.\n\nEgg had protective membranes & porous shell enclosing the embryo\n\nHas 4 specialized membranes --- amnion, yolk sac, allantois, & chorion\n\nAmnion is a thin membrane surrounding a salty fluid in which the embryo \"floats\"\n\nYolk sac encloses the yolk or protein-rich food supply for embryo\n\nAllantois stores nitrogenous wastes made by embryo until egg hatches\n\nChorion lines the inside of the shell & regulates oxygen & carbon dioxide exchange\n\nShell leathery & waterproof\n\nInternal fertilization occurs in female before shell is formed\n\n25. What reptile group is thought to be the ancestors of mammals?\n\nALIGATORS\n\n26. What were pterosaurs?\n\nPterosaurs were flying reptiles that dominated the Mesozoic skies. They had a keel for attachment of flight muscles and air spaces in bones to reduce weight.\n\n27. What 3 groups of retiles are still alive today?\n\nturtles, snakes/lizards, and crocodiles/alligators.\n\n28. Describe characteristics of the reptiles.\n\nReptiles have a thick, scaly skin that is keratinized and impermeable to water. This same keratin is a protein found in hair, fingernails, and feathers. Protective skin prevents water loss but requires several molts a year. Reptilian lungs are more developed than those of amphibians.\n\n29. How can snakes swallow such large prey?\n\nTheir jaws can readily dislocate to engulf large food.\n\n30. What is the purpose of the Jacobson’s organ in snakes?\n\nThe snake's tongue collects airborne molecules and transfers them to the Jacobson's organ for tasting. Some poisonous snakes have special fangs for injecting their venom.\n\n31. What takes the place of teeth in turtles?\n\nthey lack teeth but use a sharp beak;\n\n32. Describe crocodiles & alligators & tell some of their habits.\n\nCrocodiles are tropical or subtropical, usually nocturnal, reptiles found in Africa, Asia, South America, & southern Florida\n\nAlligators are found in China & the southern United States\n\n33. What class contains birds?\n\nLinnaean taxonomy\n\n34. From what did birds probably evolve?\n\nArchaeopteryx\n\n35. What are the distinguishing features of birds?\n\nFunction to provide lift for flight & help conserve body heat\n\nFive kinds of feathers --- down, contour, flight, filoplume, & bristles\n\n36. Sketch & label the parts of a feature.\n\nevelop from tiny pits in the skin called follicles\n\nShaft emerges from the follicle\n\nTwo vanes develop on either side of shaft\n\nBarbs branch off of each vane & have projections called barbules\n\nBarbules have microscopic hooks to hold barbules together\n\n37. Birds are endothermic. What does this mean?\n\nEndothermic means the organism produces its own heat from itside through metabolism. ... Mammals are endotherms as are birds\n\n38. Name some flightless birds.\n\nostrich, emu, cassowary, rhea, kiwi, and penguins.\n\n39. Name some swimming birds.\n\nGen too Penguin\n\n40. What are the 3 main characteristics of all mammals?\n\nEndothermy - maintain high, constant body temperature through their metabolism\n\nPelage - hair or fur made of protein called keratin covering all or part of the body for insulation & camouflage\n\nFour chambered heart ( two atria & two ventricles) keep oxygenated & deoxygenated blood from mixing; double circulation\n\n41. What in female mammals produces milk?\n\nMammary glands\n\n42. What is mammalian hair made of & give its 4 functions.\n\nThe shaft of a hair is made up primarily of a protein called keratin\n\n43. What bones are modified in mammals to help them hear sounds?\n\nthe helix and corresponds to the true ear tip of the long-eared mammals.\n\n44. Name a flying mammal.\n\nBATS\n\n45. Give examples of mammals that are herbivores.\n\nRAIN DEER, MOUNTAIN GOAT, WILD SHEEP, MUSK OXEN\n\n46. Give examples of mammals that are carnivores.\n\nWOLF, LION, RACCOON, SKUNK, BADGER\n\n47.

Tell where they are found.\n\nYoung monotremes are small & partially developed at hatching so depend on mother for protection and milk from mammary glands\n\nMarsupials have short development period inside of the mother & newborns must crawl to the mother's pouch or marsupium after birth, attach to a nipple for milk, and finish developing\n\n50. Give examples of marsupials & tell their characteristics. Tell where most of them are found.\n\nFound in New Guinea, Australia, & the Americas\n\nDominate animal in Australia due to lack of competition from placental mammals\n\nKnown as pouched animals\n\nPouch called marsupium\n\nViviparous (live birth)\n\nTiny, immature young must crawl to mother's pouch after birth\n\nYoung attach to mammary gland nipple to nurse until able to survive outside of pouch\n\nIncludes opossum, kangaroo, wombat, & koala\n\n51. Most mammals are placentals. What does this mean?\n\nYoung carried in uterus & nourished by placenta\n\nGestation periods (time of development within uterus) varies among species\n\nAdapted for life on land in water, and in air\n\nMammal species make up 95 % of all animals\n\nAt least 18 orders exist\n\n52.
