The dugong is a mammal distributed in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific Ocean, and this species is the only member of the dugong family. However, despite their vast habitat, their numbers are very small and they are in a critical situation.\n\nWhat is a dugong? About basic status\n\nDugongs are mammals classified in the genus Dugong, family Dugongidae, order Dugongales. English is Dugong, scientific name is Dugong dugon. The body length is 3 meters and the weight is 450 kg. The list of information is as follows. Dugongs are also said to be “model mermaids”. Even in Pokemon, there is a monster called Dugong.\n\nAbout classification\n\nThe dugong is a mammal distributed in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific Ocean, and this species is the only member of the dugong family.\n\nAbout habitat\n\nDugongs can be found in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and even the Red Sea. It can also be seen around Okinawa in the Philippines and Japan.\n\nfeature is? What kind of creature is it?\n\nThe dugong has a spindle-shaped body with a very thick upper lip and a flat, rounded tip. The ear holes are small, and so are the eyes. The forelimbs are fin-like and have no claws, and the hind limbs are degenerated. Hair grows sparsely all over the body, and the body color is gray, brown, or bluish gray. Dugongs live in areas with coral reefs and can dive to depths of more than 35 meters.\n\nWhat is your personality like?\n\nDugongs have a very calm personality. However, they are also very sensitive animals and have exceptional hearing, which allows them to detect enemies.\n\nWhat is the ecology like?\n\nDugongs are herbivorous and subsist mainly on seaweed such as eelgrass. There is no fixed breeding season, and the gestation period is 13 months. They can give birth to one cub at a time. Both males and females reach sexual maturity as early as 6 years. They have a very long lifespan, with some living for over 50 years, and some can live up to 70 years.\n\nAre there any natural enemies?\n\nDugongs’ natural enemy is sharks. Killer whales are also very large prey. Looking at a lot of research and survey data, there is a possibility of extinction because there is no defense against these things.\n\nIs the dugong an endangered species?\n\nThe dugong is an endangered species (red list) animal. The meat is edible and is considered extremely delicious, so it is widely hunted. Furthermore, marine pollution and the resulting decline in seaweed, which is their food source, are also having a major impact. In Japan, it was designated as a national natural monument in 1972, and since 2003, capturing and killing it has been prohibited under the Wildlife Protection Act. Dugong is also listed in Appendix I of CITES, so international trade is severely restricted.\n\nCan dugongs be kept as pets?\n\nDugongs live in extremely harsh conditions, making it extremely difficult to keep them in captivity. We recommend viewing it at an aquarium."
