        "text": "Phylum Chordata\n\nAnimals in the Phylum Chordata share four characteristics: • Dorsal hollow nerve cord – homologous to your spinal cord • Notochord – long supportive rod that runs through the body just below the nerve cord- is homologous to your backbone • Pharyngeal pouches/slits – paired structures found around the throat region (can become gills, yours closes up in utero) • Postanal tail – tail that extends beyond the anus\n\nBasic Chordate structure\n\nChordates • These characteristics are present sometime during life. Most chordates are vertebrates, but a few are not. • The two groups of invertebrate chordates still share the four other characteristics that identify them as chordates. • They are the link between vertebrates and invertebrates.\n\nTunicates- label the parts • Urochordata (tunicates) are mostly sessile, but some free floating\n\nLancelets- label the parts • Cephalochordata( lancelets) dig into sand with anterior end sticking out\n\nVertebrates – animals that have a true backbone • Fish! • Amphibians! • Reptiles! • Birds! • Mammals! Greater Siren Bush baby lionfish Texas Banded Gecko Okapi Manta ray Snake neck turtle Asian leaf toad\n\nFish • Fish – aquatic animal that has paired fins, scales, and gills (from the pharyngeal slits). • Metabolism: heterothermic, meaning their body temperature varies; ectothermic, meaning that their body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings • Movement: carried out by fins and trunk musculature movements.\n\nRespiration: gills are made up of feathery, threadlike structures with a network of fine capillaries that provides a large surface area for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Water flows over the gills and gas exchange occurs here. Circulation: closed circulatory system, meaning the blood is contained in vessels , single loop system (heart to gills to body) Fish\n\nFish • Nervous System: highly developed senses and have an extra sense called the lateral line system that helps them detect gentle currents in the water.\n\nFish • Reproduction: some have internal fertilization, some external; some egg birth, some live birth, very little to no parental care The eel uses its strong trunk musculature to swim\n\nGroups: There are 3 classes of fishes; Agnathans: “no jaw” jawless fish (ex: lampreys, hagfish) Fish classification Lamprey Shark Carp\n\nGroups: There are 3 classes of fishes; Agnathans: “no jaw” jawless fish (ex: lampreys, hagfish) Chondrichtheyes: cartilaginous fish (ex: sharks, skates, rays) Fish classification Lamprey Shark Carp\n\nGroups: There are 3 classes of fishes; Agnathans: “no jaw” jawless fish (ex: lampreys, hagfish) Chondrichtheyes: cartilaginous fish (ex: sharks, skates, rays) Osteichthyes: bony fish (ex: salmon, flounder, carp) Fish classification Lamprey Shark Carp\n\nAmphibian • Amphibians “double life”– lives in water as a larva and on land as an adult (mostly), lack scales and claws. • Earliest amphibians evolved several adaptations that helped them live at least part of their lives out of the water. • Link to life on land.\n\nAmphibian • Metabolism: heterothermic, ectothermic • Movement: Bones supporting the appendicular skeleton of amphibians became stronger; permitting more efficient movement. Splayed posture of limbs.\n\nAmphibian • Respiration: some retain gills, most breath with lungs as an adult, has moist skin that contains mucus glands, and can also have gas exchange across it. Skin is VERY sensitive to pollution Some salamander species retain external gills Leopard Frog with extra legs\n\nCirculation: closed circulation with 3 chambered heart with double loop circulation (heart to lungs back to heart, then out to body), mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the ventricles. Amphibian\n\nAmphibian • Nervous System: Like fishes, amphibians have well-developed nervous and sensory systems. • Reproduction: most are externally fertilized except some salamanders; lay hundreds of eggs, little parental care\n\nGroups: Anura: 4 legs, jumping limbs, aquatic or land dwelling (ex: frogs, toads) Amphibian Classification Green Tree Frog Tiger salamander Caecilian\n\nGroups: Anura: 4 legs, jumping limbs, aquatic or land dwelling (ex: frogs, toads) Caudata: 2-4 legs, long tail, can have external gills (ex: newts and salamanders) Amphibian Classification Green Tree Frog Tiger salamander Caecilian\n\nGroups: Anura: 4 legs, jumping limbs, aquatic or land dwelling (ex: frogs, toads) Caudata: 2-4 legs, long tail, can have external gills (ex: newts and salamanders) Apoda: legless worm-like amphibians, burrowers (ex: Caecilians) Amphibian Classification Green Tree Frog Tiger salamander Caecilian\n\nReptiles • Reptiles (Class Reptilia)– Has dry scaly skin that sheds and terrestrial eggs with several membranes. Anole Diamondback rattlesnake Sea turtle\n\nReptiles • Metabolism: heterothermic andectothermic, many of them bask in the sun to warm up • Movement: splayed posture with more leg musculature, some have no legs with very advanced trunk musculature (SNAKES!) • Respiration/Circulation: Well developed lungs, a double-loop circulatory system with a three-chambered heart (with partial septum in the ventricle) OR four-chambered heart. • Nervous System: well developed senses, enlarged cerebrum and cerebellum as compared to amphibians. Snakes smell through an organ on the roof of their mouth \n\nReproduction: internal fertilization, shelled terrestrial eggs called amniotic eggs that enable reptiles to live their entire lives out of water. Some have very little parental care.\n\nGroups: Crocodilians: alligators and crocodiles and gavials Testudines: reptiles with fused skeletons to the shell (ex: turtles and tortoises) Serpentes: legless, advanced trunk musculature makes them extremely successful (found everywhere except New Zealand and Antarctica) ex: snakes Lacertilia: lizards Reptilian classification Gavial Red-eared Slider Coachwhip Gila Monster\n\nSphenodontia: tuataras, lizard-like reptile found only in New Zealand Amphisbaenia- legless, wormlike reptiles (“grave digger worms”) Reptilian classification\n\nBirds • Birds (Class Aves) – Reptile-like animals that maintain a constant internal body temperature. They have an outer covering of feathers, two legs that are covered with scales and are used for walking or perching, and front limbs modified into wings. Puffins Cassowary\n\nBirds • Metabolism: homeothermic, meaning their body temperature remains constant; endothermicmeaningthat they generate body heat internally • Movement: have a number of adaptations that enable them to fly such as aerodynamic feathers and wings, strong lightweight bones, and strong chest muscles. Some do NOT fly, like ostriches and kiwis.\n\nBirds • Nervous system: The cerebrum, which controls such behaviors as flying, nest building, care of young, courtship, and mating, is quite large. The cerebellum is also well developed, as you might expect in an animal that uses precise, coordinated movements. • Reproduction: internal fertilization, lay amniotic eggs and incubate them, lots of parental care\n\nRespiration/Circulation: Four-chambered heart. When a bird inhales, most air first enters large air sacs and then it flows through the lungs. Air travels through the lungs in a series of small tubes. These tubes are lined with specialized tissue, where gas exchange takes place. It is a highly advanced two cycle breath. Birds\n\nBirds • Groups: too diverse to list, but examples include: pelicans, penguins, ducks, owls, ratites (flightless birds like ostriches), grackles, parrots, etc.\n\nMammals • Mammals (Class Mammalia) – animals that have hair, the ability to nourish their young with milk produced by mammary glands (modified sebaceous glands)\n\nMammals • Metabolism: homeothermic and endothermic • Movement: four legs or two legs with legs beneath the girdles, not splayed • Respiration/Circulation: lungs and 4-chambered heart • Reproduction: lots of parental care, mammals divided into three groups based on birth canal structure and development\n\nMetatheria (Marsupials): bear live young but at a very early stage in development and young finish development attached to a nipple; only 50% of them have the trademark pouch, some open anteriorly and some open posteriorly; have a separate opening for solid waste from birth canal and liquid waste; (ex: kangaroos, possums, opposums, koala, wallaby) Mammalian Classification Monito del Monte Virginia Oppossums Koala Pretty faced Wallaby\n\nMammalian Orders • Perissodactyla- odd toed hoofed animals: tapirs, rhinos, horses, zebras • Artiodactyla- even-toed hoofed animals: goat, sheep, camels, deer\n\nMammalian Orders • Proboscidian- elongated nose is trunk- elephants • Carnivora- defined by their teeth, examples include: dogs, cats, raccoons, bears, skunks, seals, walruses • Lagomorpha- two pairs of incisors- rabbits, hares, pikas\n\nMammalian Orders • Cetacea- whales and dolphins • Sirenia- manatees and dugongs\n\nMammalian Orders • Primates- highly developed brains, opposable thumbs: lemurs, apes, gorillas, humans, aye ayes\n\nMammalian Orders • Others including scaly anteaters, shrews, insectivores, anteaters, armadillos, sloths,\n\nAnimal Behavior • When an animal responds to a stimulus(a detectable signal), the body systems (usually sense organs, nervous systems, and muscles) interact to produce the resulting behavior.\n\nAnimal Behavior • There are 2 types: • Innate – behaviors that appear in fully functional form the first time they are preformed, even though the animal may have not had previous experience with the stimuli to which it respond. Example: a spider weaving a web, suckling of a baby to the nipple\n\nAnimal Behavior • Learned – behaviors that are a result from watching or doing that develop over time. Example: training you dog to sit on command.\n\nLearned Behaviors • Classical conditioning: an animal learns to respond to a stimulus not normally associated with that reward or punishment. (Pavlov’s dogs)\n\nLearned Behaviors • Operant conditioning: an animal learns by trial and error to obtain a reward or avoid a punishment (Skinner’s box)\n\nLearned Behaviors • Insight learning: an animal applies knowledge to a new situation without trial and error, common in primates (solving problems)\n\nPatterns of Behavior • Migration – movement of animals from one place to another seasonally – birds, butterflies"
