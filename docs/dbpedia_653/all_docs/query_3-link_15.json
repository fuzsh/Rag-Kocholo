        "text": "Natural history\n\nThe order Sirenia was named after the Sirens of Greek mythology, and sirenians are believed to be the basis for the mermaid myth. Modern sirenians have two front limbs in the form of flippers but no hind limbs; even the pelvis is vestigial, and there are no skeletal remnants of leg or foot bones at all. Sirenian bodies are basically round in cross-section and taper toward the tail, which is flattened horizontally and provides propulsion. Dugong tails are deeply notched, similar to those of whales, whereas in manatees the tail is rounded outward like a paddle. Sirenians in general are slow-moving but capable of short bursts of speed. There are no marked differences between the sexes; females have two inconspicuous mammary glands with one teat near the base of each flipper. Both dugongs and manatees have thick tough skin (that of Stellerâ€™s sea cow was even tougher). All sirenians are nearly hairless except at the muzzle, where there are thick sensory hairs called vibrissae. The upper lip is enlarged and muscular and serves to grasp and manipulate food plants. The eyes are small, and the external ears consist only of tiny pits. Nostrils on the upper surface of the snout function as valves to exclude water. Sirenian bones are exceptionally dense, most of them lacking marrow. This adaptation is thought to help maintain neutral buoyancy.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nDeadliest Animals Quiz\n\nManatees and dugongs differ in a number of traits besides the shape of the tail. Manatees lack incisor teeth, but incisors do occur in dugongs, erupting as tusks in the males. Manatees grow a never-ending series of molars that continuously move forward in the jaw to replace those that wear and fall out at the front. Dugongs, on the other hand, have a finite number of six molars and premolars in each jaw, and they are not replaced; in older individuals only two remain. Manatees have six neck vertebrae instead of the seven typical of mammals. Dugongs are exclusively marine, but manatees inhabit both marine and freshwater systems."
