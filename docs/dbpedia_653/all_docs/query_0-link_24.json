        "text": "Presentation on theme: \"Phylum Chordata.\"— Presentation transcript:\n\n1 Phylum Chordata\n\n2 Animals in the Phylum Chordata share four characteristics:\n\nDorsal hollow nerve cord – homologous to your spinal cord Notochord – long supportive rod that runs through the body just below the nerve cord- is homologous to your backbone Pharyngeal pouches/slits – paired structures found around the throat region (can become gills, yours closes up in utero) Postanal tail – tail that extends beyond the anus\n\n3 Basic Chordate structure\n\n4 Chordates These characteristics are present sometime during life. Most chordates are vertebrates, but a few are not. The two groups of invertebrate chordates still share the four other characteristics that identify them as chordates. They are the link between vertebrates and invertebrates. Sometime during life… where is our notochord? Where is our tail? In all vertebrates, the notochord develops into our vertebral column- it grows around our dorsal hollow nerve cord to protect it. We have a tail in utero that is lost during development (we do have a tail bone which are fused vertebrae called the coccyx). In vertebrates without gills, the pharyngeal slits develop into part of the inner ear.\n\n5 Tunicates- label the parts\n\nUrochordata (tunicates) are mostly sessile, but some free floating\n\n6 Lancelets- label the parts\n\nCephalochordata( lancelets) dig into sand with anterior end sticking out\n\n7 Vertebrates – animals that have a true backbone\n\nFish! Amphibians! Reptiles! Birds! Mammals! Greater Siren Bush baby lionfish Texas Banded Gecko Okapi Manta ray Snake neck turtle Asian leaf toad\n\n8 Fish Fish – aquatic animal that has paired fins, scales, and gills (from the pharyngeal slits). Metabolism: heterothermic, meaning their body temperature varies; ectothermic, meaning that their body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings Movement: carried out by fins and trunk musculature movements.\n\n9 Fish Respiration: gills are made up of feathery, threadlike structures with a network of fine capillaries that provides a large surface area for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Water flows over the gills and gas exchange occurs here. Circulation: closed circulatory system, meaning the blood is contained in vessels , single loop system (heart to gills to body)\n\n10 Fish Nervous System: highly developed senses and have an extra sense called the lateral line system that helps them detect gentle currents in the water.\n\n11 Fish Reproduction: some have internal fertilization, some external; some egg birth, some live birth, very little to no parental care The eel uses its strong trunk musculature to swim\n\n12 Fish classification Groups: There are 3 classes of fishes;\n\nLamprey Groups: There are 3 classes of fishes; Agnathans: “no jaw” jawless fish (ex: lampreys, hagfish) Shark Carp\n\n13 Fish classification Groups: There are 3 classes of fishes;\n\nLamprey Groups: There are 3 classes of fishes; Agnathans: “no jaw” jawless fish (ex: lampreys, hagfish) Chondrichtheyes: cartilaginous fish (ex: sharks, skates, rays) Shark Carp\n\n14 Fish classification Groups: There are 3 classes of fishes;\n\nLamprey Groups: There are 3 classes of fishes; Agnathans: “no jaw” jawless fish (ex: lampreys, hagfish) Chondrichtheyes: cartilaginous fish (ex: sharks, skates, rays) Osteichthyes: bony fish (ex: salmon, flounder, carp) Shark Carp\n\n15 Amphibian Amphibians “double life”– lives in water as a larva and on land as an adult (mostly), lack scales and claws. Earliest amphibians evolved several adaptations that helped them live at least part of their lives out of the water. Link to life on land.\n\n16 Amphibian Metabolism: heterothermic, ectothermic\n\nMovement: Bones supporting the appendicular skeleton of amphibians became stronger; permitting more efficient movement. Splayed posture of limbs.\n\n17 Amphibian Respiration: some retain gills, most breath with lungs as an adult, has moist skin that contains mucus glands, and can also have gas exchange across it. Skin is VERY sensitive to pollution Some salamander species retain external gills Leopard Frog with extra legs Some amphibians retain external gills throughout life like this one \n\n18 Amphibian Circulation: closed circulation with 3 chambered heart with double loop circulation (heart to lungs back to heart, then out to body), mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the ventricles.\n\n19 Amphibian Nervous System: Like fishes, amphibians have well-developed nervous and sensory systems. Reproduction: most are externally fertilized except some salamanders; lay hundreds of eggs, little parental care\n\n20 Amphibian Classification\n\nGroups: Anura: 4 legs, jumping limbs, aquatic or land dwelling (ex: frogs, toads) Green Tree Frog Tiger salamander Caecilian\n\n21 Amphibian Classification\n\nGroups: Anura: 4 legs, jumping limbs, aquatic or land dwelling (ex: frogs, toads) Caudata: 2-4 legs, long tail, can have external gills (ex: newts and salamanders) Green Tree Frog Tiger salamander Caecilian\n\n22 Amphibian Classification\n\nGroups: Anura: 4 legs, jumping limbs, aquatic or land dwelling (ex: frogs, toads) Caudata: 2-4 legs, long tail, can have external gills (ex: newts and salamanders) Apoda: legless worm-like amphibians, burrowers (ex: Caecilians) Green Tree Frog Tiger salamander Caecilian\n\n23 Reptiles Reptiles (Class Reptilia)– Has dry scaly skin that sheds and terrestrial eggs with several membranes. Anole Diamondback rattle snake Anole Sea Turtle Diamondback rattlesnake Sea turtle\n\n24 Reptiles Metabolism: heterothermic and ectothermic, many of them bask in the sun to warm up Movement: splayed posture with more leg musculature, some have no legs with very advanced trunk musculature (SNAKES!) Respiration/Circulation: Well developed lungs, a double-loop circulatory system with a three-chambered heart (with partial septum in the ventricle) OR four-chambered heart. Nervous System: well developed senses, enlarged cerebrum and cerebellum as compared to amphibians. Snakes smell through an organ on the roof of their mouth  Splayed means the legs are angled out from the pelvic and pectoral girdles. They do not support as much weight.\n\n25 Reproduction: internal fertilization, shelled terrestrial eggs called amniotic eggs that enable reptiles to live their entire lives out of water. Some have very little parental care.\n\n26 Reptilian classification\n\nGavial Groups: Crocodilians: alligators and crocodiles and gavials Testudines: reptiles with fused skeletons to the shell (ex: turtles and tortoises) Serpentes: legless, advanced trunk musculature makes them extremely successful (found everywhere except New Zealand and Antarctica) ex: snakes Lacertilia: lizards Red-eared Slider Coachwhip Gavial Red-eared slider Western Coachwhip Gila monster Gila Monster\n\n27 Reptilian classification\n\nSphenodontia: tuataras, lizard-like reptile found only in New Zealand Amphisbaenia- legless, wormlike reptiles (“grave digger worms”)\n\n28 Birds Birds (Class Aves) – Reptile-like animals that maintain a constant internal body temperature. They have an outer covering of feathers, two legs that are covered with scales and are used for walking or perching, and front limbs modified into wings. Cassowary, Australia Puffins, Canada Puffins Cassowary\n\n29 Birds Metabolism: homeothermic, meaning their body temperature remains constant; endothermic meaning that they generate body heat internally Movement: have a number of adaptations that enable them to fly such as aerodynamic feathers and wings, strong lightweight bones, and strong chest muscles. Some do NOT fly, like ostriches and kiwis.\n\n30 Birds Nervous system: The cerebrum, which controls such behaviors as flying, nest building, care of young, courtship, and mating, is quite large. The cerebellum is also well developed, as you might expect in an animal that uses precise, coordinated movements. Reproduction: internal fertilization, lay amniotic eggs and incubate them, lots of parental care\n\n31 Birds Respiration/Circulation: Four-chambered heart. When a bird inhales, most air first enters large air sacs and then it flows through the lungs. Air travels through the lungs in a series of small tubes. These tubes are lined with specialized tissue, where gas exchange takes place. It is a highly advanced two cycle breath.\n\n32 Birds Groups: too diverse to list, but examples include: pelicans, penguins, ducks, owls, ratites (flightless birds like ostriches), grackles, parrots, etc.\n\n33 Mammals Mammals (Class Mammalia) – animals that have hair, the ability to nourish their young with milk produced by mammary glands (modified sebaceous glands)\n\n34 Mammals Metabolism: homeothermic and endothermic\n\nMovement: four legs or two legs with legs beneath the girdles, not splayed Respiration/Circulation: lungs and 4-chambered heart Reproduction: lots of parental care, mammals divided into three groups based on birth canal structure and development\n\n35 Mammalian Classification\n\nMonotremata: lay eggs, have a single opening for birth canal, solid waste, and liquid wastes (ex: Platypus, echidna) Duck- billed Platypus Echidna\n\n36 Mammalian Classification\n\nMonito del Monte Metatheria (Marsupials): bear live young but at a very early stage in development and young finish development attached to a nipple; only 50% of them have the trademark pouch, some open anteriorly and some open posteriorly; have a separate opening for solid waste from birth canal and liquid waste; (ex: kangaroos, possums, opposums, koala, wallaby) MOnito del monte, Chile Wallaby, Australia Virginia Opossum, USA Virginia Oppossums Koala Pretty faced Wallaby\n\n37 Mammalian Classification\n\nEutheria (Placental): nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and wastes are exchanged efficiently between embryo and mother through the placenta, live birth fully developed, have three separate openings Flying fox, Australia\n\n38 Mammalian Orders Rodentia- ever growing incisors (front two teeth), most diverse group; ex: beavers, porcupines, squirrels, mice, groundhogs, capybara, etc. Chiroptera- bats; there are macrochiroptera like flying foxes, and microchiroptera like the ones found in the Americas\n\n39 Mammalian Orders Perissodactyla- odd toed hoofed animals: tapirs, rhinos, horses, zebras Artiodactyla- even-toed hoofed animals: goat, sheep, camels, deer\n\n40 Mammalian Orders Proboscidian- elongated nose is trunk- elephants\n\nCarnivora- defined by their teeth, examples include: dogs, cats, raccoons, bears, skunks, seals, walruses Lagomorpha- two pairs of incisors- rabbits, hares, pikas\n\n41 Mammalian Orders Cetacea- whales and dolphins\n\nSirenia- manatees and dugongs\n\n42 Mammalian Orders Primates- highly developed brains, opposable thumbs: lemurs, apes, gorillas, humans, aye ayes\n\n43 Mammalian Orders Others including scaly anteaters, shrews, insectivores, anteaters, armadillos, sloths,\n\n44 Animal Behavior When an animal responds to a stimulus (a detectable signal), the body systems (usually sense organs, nervous systems, and muscles) interact to produce the resulting behavior.\n\n45 Animal Behavior There are 2 types:\n\nInnate – behaviors that appear in fully functional form the first time they are preformed, even though the animal may have not had previous experience with the stimuli to which it respond. Example: a spider weaving a web, suckling of a baby to the nipple\n\n46 Animal Behavior Learned – behaviors that are a result from watching or doing that develop over time. Example: training you dog to sit on command.\n\n47 Learned Behaviors Classical conditioning: an animal learns to respond to a stimulus not normally associated with that reward or punishment. (Pavlov’s dogs) The most famous example of classical conditioning is the work of the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, around Pavlov was studying salivation—an innate behavior—in dogs. He discovered that if he always rang a bell at the same time he fed his dog, the dog would eventually begin to salivate whenever it heard a bell, even if no food was present. The activity at right shows how the dog in Pavlov's experiment learned to associate the bell (stimulus) with the arrival of food (reward).\n\n48 Learned Behaviors Operant conditioning: an animal learns by trial and error to obtain a reward or avoid a punishment (Skinner’s box) Operant conditioning was first described in the 1940s by the American psychologist B. F. Skinner. Skinner invented a testing procedure that used a certain type of box called a “Skinner box.” A Skinner box contains a colored button or lever that, when pressed, delivers a food reward. After an animal is rewarded several times, it learns that it gets food whenever it presses the button or lever. At this point, the animal has learned by operant conditioning how to obtain food.\n\n49 Learned Behaviors Insight learning: an animal applies knowledge to a new situation without trial and error, common in primates (solving problems) For instance, if you are given a new math problem on an exam, you may apply principles you have already learned in the class in order to solve the problem. Insight learning is common among humans and other primates.
