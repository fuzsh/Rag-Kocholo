The major advances that are made, continuously affect our life on earth. Some of these important advances are included here. The results of a recent survey on the attitudes to existing literature available to high school students showed that many were unhappy with the material used in teaching and learning. Those questioned identified a lack of the following; accompanying supplementary material to main text books, current information on new developments, clear figures and diagrams and insufficient attention to design and planning of experiments. This book aims to improve the level of understanding of modern biology by inclusion of the following; main texts, figures and illustrations, extensive questions, articles and experiments. Each topic is well illustrated with figures and graphs to ease understanding. Supplementary material in the form of posters, transparencies and cassettes will shortly be available. It is the intention and hope of the authors that the contents of this book will help to bridge the current gap in the field of biology at this level.\n\nWe are grateful to all the people who have helped with this book.

Atoms and molecules are organized into cells, cells are organized into tissues, tissues are organized into organs, and organs are organized into organ systems. Four basic types of tissue make up the organs. The complex animal body has many systems which are closely related to each other for the survival of the organism A complex organism includes six groups of components. In order of size, these are atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs and systems.\n\n1. Atoms - Molecules - Compounds Atoms are the simplest structural elements of living things, and more than 100 elements have been identified in the world. Each element has a unique atomic structure. The elements most frequently found in living things are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. Figure: Atom and Molecule\n\nTwo atoms of the same element generally associate to form a molecule. For instance, two hydrogen atoms associate to form a hydrogen molecule. Compounds differ from molecules in that their formation results from the combination of two or more atoms from different elements. The most well-known compound is water, formed from the association of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Carbon dioxide is formed from the association of two oxygen atoms and a carbon atom.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\n2. Cells\n\nFigure: Multicellular organisation.\n\n6\n\nCells are the building blocks of all living things, either unicellular or multicellular. All metabolic activities are performed within cells. Metabolism, excretion, reproduction, respiration, irritability and growth are the basic functions that cells must perform.Cells have vital roles in the survival of an organism despite their differences in structure and function. All are involved in different functions such as movement, support, energy, etc. Thus, the unity of an organism is maintained by differentiated cells. Although cells differ in function and shape, they all possess an almost identical structure. All are composed of a plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. The plasma membrane is involved in the protection of the cell, providing shape, transport of materials and communication. The cytoplasm is the liquid portion of the cell located between the plasma membrane and the nucleus. It is composed of organelles, organic and inorganic molecules. The organic molecules of the cytoplasm are carbohydrates, proteins, fats and nucleic acids. The inorganic molecules are minerals, water, etc.\n\nThe organelles of the cytoplasm are ribosome, peroxisome, Golgi body, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, mitochondrion, vacuole, and centrosome. The nucleus is the most vital component of the cell. It contains coded genetic information within its chromosomes. DNA and RNA store the genetic information. The cell can not survive if the nucleus is removed. A cytoskeleton provides support and maintains cell shape. Flagellum and cilia provide movement of cells.\n\nFigure: Animal cell\n\nCell components\n\nDescription\n\nFunction\n\nCell membrane\n\nLipid bilayers in which proteins are embedded.

Tissues A tissue is a group of cells specialized for a common purpose. Tissues are composed of cells and interstitial fluid involved in material exchange with the environment. Tissues are classified according to their location and structure.\n\na. Animal tissues Epithelial tissues; They are involved in secretion, protection and absorption and cover the body of most vertebrates. Additionally, they cover the inner surface of those organisms that possess a body cavity. Epithelial tissue also encapsulates the blood and lymph vessels and is classified according to its functions.\n\nConnective tissue; It is generated from the mesoderm layer of the embryo. It is involved in the connection of all tissues and also supports the body. Connective tissue is composed of 6 main types; Loose connective tissue\n\nCartilage tissue\n\nBone tissue\n\nBlood tissue\n\nFibrous connective tissue\n\nAdipose tissue\n\nMuscle tissue: The body as a whole, as well as individual internal organs, moves by means of muscle tissue.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nIt is classified as skeletal, smooth or cardiac according to its structure. The skeletal muscles work in conjunction with bones to provide movement of the body. The smooth muscles participate mostly in the structure of internal organs and in the movement of blood in the vessels. The cardiac muscles are responsible for the function of the heart.\n\n8\n\nNervous tissue: It consists of neuron and glial cells and is involved in the transmission of impulses in the body. A nerve cell known as a neuron consists of the following components : dendrites: They receive information from other neurons. cell body: It contains all cell organelles and all metabolic reactions occur in the cell body. axon: It transfers information to other neurons.\n\nFigure: A typical neuron\n\ncardiac muscle and heart\n\nThe heart (Latin, cor) is a hollow, muscular organ that pumps blood through the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. The term cardiac means \"related to the heart\", from the Greek cardia for \"heart\". Cardiac muscle is a type of striated muscle found within the heart. Its function is to \"pump\" blood through the circulatory system; contraction. Cardiac muscle generally operates \"involuntarily\" and rhythmically, without receiving nerve stimulation. Cardiac muscle is myogenic, which means that it is self-exciting. This is in contrast with skeletal muscle, which requires either conscious or reflex nervous stimuli. The rate of cardiac contractions is generally determined by pacemaker cells. However, each individual cell will contract without input. When individual cells are in close proximity they can share their signal and will contract in unison, their frequency being determined by the cell with the shortest interval. Individual cardiac cells are joined by intercalated discs. Structure: Mammals and birds have four-chambered hearts. Amphibians and reptilians have three-chambered hearts. Fish have a single circulation system and a heart with two chambers. In mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the heart’s left upper chamber contains oxygen-rich blood. The hearts of arthropods and mollusks have a single chamber. Heartbeat: Smaller animals have a faster heartbeat. This is evident within a species as well, as the young have a faster heartbeat than the adults. A gray whale’s heart beats 9 times per minute, a harbour seal’s 10 when diving and 140 when on land, an elephant’s 25, human’s 70, sparrow’s 500, shrew’s 600, and a hummingbird’s 1,200 when hovering. The earthworm has a series of multiple, primitive hearts.\n\n9\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nREAD ME\n\nTYPES OF VERTEBRATE TISSUE Tissue\n\nE P I T H E L I A L\n\nFunction\n\nCharacteristic Cell Types\n\nSimple Squamous Epithelium\n\nLining of lungs, capillary walls, and blood vessels\n\nallows material exchange by diffusion\n\nEpithelial cells\n\nCuboidal\n\nLining of some glands and kidney tubules; covering of ovaries.\n\nSecretion and absorption\n\nGland cells\n\nColumnar\n\nSurface lining of stomach, intestines, and parts of respiratory tract\n\nProtection, secretion and absorption.\n\nEpithelial cells\n\nStratified Squamous Epithelium\n\nOuter layer of skin; lining of mouth\n\nTough layer of cells, provides protection Epithelial cells\n\nPseudo-stratLining of parts of respiratory tract ified columnar\n\nC Loose O N Dense N E C Cartilage T I Bone V E Blood M Smooth U S C Skeletal L E Cardiac\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nTypical Location\n\nSensory N neurons E R Motor V neurons E Association neurons\n\n10\n\nBeneath skin, between organs\n\nSecretes mucus; movement of mucus; protection\n\nGland cells; ciliated epithelial cells\n\nProvides support, insulation, food storage, nourishment for epithelium\n\nFibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, fat cells\n\nTendons; sheath around muscles; Provides flexible, strong connections kidney; liver; dermis of skin.\n\nFibroblasts\n\nSpinal disks; knees and other joints; Provides flexible support, shock absorpChondrocytes ear; nose; tracheal rings tion, Most of skeleton\n\nProtests internal organs, provides rigid support for muscle attachment\n\nOsteocytes\n\nCirculatory System\n\nImmunity, transport\n\nErythrocytes, leukocytes\n\nInvoluntary contractions of internal Walls of blood vessels, stomach and organs commanded by central nervous intestines system\n\nSmooth muscle cells\n\nVoluntary muscles\n\nPowers walking, lifting, talking, and all other voluntary movement\n\nSkeletal muscle cells\n\nWalls of heart\n\nHeart contraction and relaxation\n\nCardiac muscle cells\n\nEyes, ears; surface of skin\n\nReceive information about body's condition and external environment\n\nRods and cones; muscle stretch receptors\n\nBrain and spinal cord\n\nStimulate muscles and glands\n\nMotor neurons\n\nBrain and spinal cord\n\nIntegrate information\n\nInterneurons\n\n4. Organ and Systems An organ is the association of two or more tissues to perform a specific function. For instance, the lungs, liver, stomach, kidney and heart are organs that perform a unique function. When body organization in multicellular organisms was discussed, it was mentioned that there is a perfect division of labour between body parts in such organisms, meaning each part of the body has a specific function to do. It was also mentioned that organisms are formed of many organ systems. Among multicellular organisms, the bodies of animals are extremely complex structures dependent on the synchronization of the following systems:\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nRegulatory System (nervous and endocrine) Sensory Reception (sense organs) Circulatory System Respiratory System Digestive System Excretory System Locomotion in Animals\n\na. Regulatory System It was already explained that there are systems in the body working in harmony, but how is this balance (homeostasis) maintained? This section will explain that the endocrine and nervous system provide organization and cooperation between organs, and regulate important functions in complex organisms, such as animals.\n\nFigure: Interaction of body systems\n\n11\n\nNervous system The nervous system of an animal coordinates the activity of the muscles, monitors the organs, constructs and processes input from the senses and initiates actions. In animals with brains, the nervous system also generates and conducts thoughts and emotions. Thus it is the system that animates \"animals\" (sponges are an exception). Chemicals that target the activity of nerves generally are the most rapidly acting toxins, typically causing paralysis and/or death. The nervous system consists basically of two types of cells: Neurons are the primary cells of the nervous system Glia are secondary cells involved in nourishment and structural support. Nervous system invertebrate The nervous system varies greatly among living animals. Cnidarians, such as sea anemones and jellyfish, have a nerve net, in which the activation of any one neuron triggers a wave of activation across the entire network. These waves are both afferent and efferent, representing both the sensation of chemicals or touch as well as the stimulus of the animals' reflexive mechanical response.The worms and flukes of the phylum platyhelminthes possess a network of nerves that operates like a more conventional nervous system, but lack a brain. Annelid worms mollusks and arthropods and tunicates have a primitive brain called a ganglionic mass, which is a bundle of several nerves. Figure: Organization of the nervous structures in hydra, Planarian, insects.\n\nVertebrate nervous systems For heuristic and other purposes, the nervous systems of vertebrate animals are often divided into a central (CNS) and a peripheral nervous systems (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists of sensory pathways and motor pathways, the latter being divided into the somatic (voluntary) nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system is the voluntary part of the system, where movement, such as posture and walking, are coordinated. The autonomic nervous system is the involuntary part of the nervous system where all of the internal maintenance is taken care of. Vertebrate Brain The brain is the most complex organ of all vertebrates and consist of 3 divisions: hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nThe hindbrain is composed of the cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata. The cerebellum is involved in the coordination of muscular movements and balance. In developed vertebrates, it is correspondingly larger than it is in fishes. The pons controls certain respiratory functions. The medulla oblongata regulates such vital activities as heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, swallowing, etc. The midbrain is involved in control of reflexes originating from the eye and ear.\n\n12\n\nThe forebrain is the largest portion of the brain and is composed of two main divisions: the cerebrum and the diencephelon. The cerebellum controls voluntary movements and coordinates mental activity. The diencephelon includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus. The thalamus functions as a central relay station for all sensory reception. The hypothalamus maintains homeostasis, controls water balance, blood pressure, body temperature, emotions etc.\n\nFigure:: Comparison of brain structure among vertebrates\n\nSpinal Cord The central nervous system is the main part of the nervous system, but it must be connected to all other parts of the body. The nerves that provide this connection form the peripheral nervous system.\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nThe spinal cord, the second part of the central nervous system, is the center of reflexes. A reflex is the transmission of impulses generated by receptors, to the target, where a sudden response is generated. The brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system. The spinal cord is located in and protected by the vertebrae.\n\nThe Endocrine System The nervous system sends electrical messages to control and coordinate the body. The endocrine system has a similar job, but uses chemicals to \"communicate\". These chemicals are known as hormones. Hormones regulate metabolism, growth and sexual development. Glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream, where they are transported to organs and tissues throughout the entire body. When a hormone is received by the target organ, it causes changes in its function; it responds to the hormone. The production of hormones is controlled by a feedback mechanism that acts much like a thermostat in a house. Pheromones Pheromones are also communication chemicals, but they are used to send signals to other members of the same species. Pheromones are widely studied in insects and are the basis for some kinds of Japanese beetle and gypsy moth traps. Common uses for pheromones are as attractants in mating, marking the territory, or indicating social status in the population.\n\n13\n\nThe Endocrine Glands In Invertebrates It is known that many hormones, such as adrenaline or acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) and similar hormones which regulate body temperature, secreted by vertebrates, are also produced by invertebrates. A low concentration of hormones is needed to accelerate development and growth in unicellular organisms whereas a high concentration of hormones inhibits these processes. Development, metamorphosis and molting are regulated by the aging hormone ecdysone, as well as other hormones. The Endocrine Glands In Vertebrates Endocrine glands in vertebrates are more developed than those in invertebrates. Generally all vertebrates have the same hormones as humans. The hypothalamus is the control center of the vertebrate endocrine system because it affects the pituitary gland. It secretes releasing and inhibiting hormone to control the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is the master gland which controls most of the other endocrine glands. The anterior pituitary secretes many hormones, especially three, known as tropic hormones, that control the secretion of other glands.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nFirst, melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) determines the color of the skin of vertebrates. Second, prolactin (PRL), also known as luteotrophic hormone (LTH), triggers milk production in mammary glands in mammals and initiates the mothering instinct in many vertebrates. Third, growth hormone (GH) controls body growth. Figure: The regulation of growth and metamorphosis is controlled by juvenile hormone and ecdysone. Level of secretion of juvenile hormone decreases gradually from the egg to the adult stage. The level of ecdysone secretion remains constant. Metamorphosis is triggered by a high concentration of ecdysone in relation to the concentration of juvenile hormone.\n\n14\n\nFourth, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) activates the thyroid gland to produce hormones. Fifth, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the adrenal glands above the kidney to secrete hormones. Sixth, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are two gonadotrophic hormones that promote the production and secretion of reproductive hormones in both males and females.\n\nPosterior pituitary hormones are produced in the neurosecretary cells of the hypothalamus. Two posterior pituitary hormones are found in all vertebrates. First, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin, regulates the water balance by controlling reabsorption of water in the kidneys of mammals. Similarly, vasotectin (a derivative of vasopressin) is found in other vertebrates and has the same function. Second, oxytocin stimulates contraction of uterine muscles and milk secretion. Derivatives of oxytocin are found in other vertebrates.\n\n15\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nFigure: Interaction of endocrine gland.\n\nThe thyroid gland, which is found in all vertebrates, accelerates metabolism and heart rate and regulates the normal absorption of glucose and fats. In mammals and birds, calcitonin, the second hormone, reduces the concentration of calcium. The function of the thyroid gland in cold-blooded (poikilathermic) vertebrates is not known overall. Thyroid hormones take a role in amphibian metamorphosis and are necessary for skin molting in amphibians and reptiles. Parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases the concentration of calcium in the blood in mammals .\n\nFigure: Thyroid and parathyroid gland\n\nThe pancreas contains both endocrine and exocrine glands. The islets secrete insulin and glucagons. Insulin decreases the blood glucose level by promoting the penetration of glucose into tissue cells, especially liver and muscles. Glucagon increases blood glucose level by converting glycogen in the liver into glucose. Exocrine glands produce secretions for digestion. The adrenal glands of mammals are located on top of the kidneys and consist of two distinct regions. The outer region is known as the adrenal cortex and the inner is known as the adrenal medulla. The hormones secreted from the cortex are known as corticoids, and are steroidal in structure. Adrenal cortex hormones are divided into three groups according to their functions: glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids, and sex hormones. Glucocorticoids affect carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism. Aldosterone is the most important mineralcorticoid. Mineralocorticoids regulate the mineral balance of the body. The third group of adrenal cortex hormones is sex hormones. Sex hormones are secreted in both males and females. Small amounts of estrogen and testosterone are secreted from the adrenal cortex in both sexes. In fishes, the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla are completely distinct. In other vertebrates, the cortex and medulla are partially associated, and finally, in birds and mammals they are completely associated.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nTwo hormones are secreted by the adrenal medulla: Epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is found in all vertebrates, whereas epinephrine is found in mammals and is more powerful. They increase blood pressure, glucose level and flow rate. They are secreted in stressful situations. Epinephrine forms about 80% of adrenal medulla hormones. However norepinephrine has long lasting effects in the blood. These hormones can increase metabolic activity 100%. Figure: Adrenal gland\n\n16\n\nThe main function of the male and female gonads is in the development of the reproductive system.\n\nb. Sensory Reception (The Sense Organs) Sensory receptors enable sensory organs to detect variation within an animal's internal and external environment. The eyes, ears, nose, taste buds, and skin are all sensory organs that consist of sensory receptors that permit animals to see, hear, smell, taste, feel, and maintain balance. The five different kinds of sensory receptors, classified according to the energy that they transduce, enable animals to survive in their environment through the use of many different senses.\n\nMechanoreceptors Mechanoreceptors respond to being mechanically pushed and pulled through touch, pressure, gravity, stretch, and movement. As their contour changes, mechanoreceptors supply information to the animal about shape, texture, weight, and the landscape of objects in the external environment. Through the use of mechanoreceptors, organisms can feel, maintain balance, and even hear. Figure.: The structure of skin\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nFeeling occurs when mechanoreceptors detect touch, pressure, and pain as objects come in contact with the skin. Another kind of mechanoreceptor is responsible for balance, which enables an animal to know the position of its body. Mechanoreceptors also facilitate hearing. The cochlear nerve then transmits these impulses to the brain. The Ears Animals can detect certain vibrations over a limited wavelength. The cricket is an example of a type of organism which has a tympanic organ in order to detect sounds. Vertebrates have well developed ears to detect sounds. Fish, however, lack an eardrum, malleus, incus and cochlea. Conversely, the ears of reptiles, amphibian and birds are located within bony structures. These bony structures, termed cholumella, are located between the eardrum and the oval window. Amphibians lack a cochlea while the cochlea of reptiles and birds is short. Mammalian ears, in contrast, are more developed than in other organisms. The ears are responsible for both hearing and maintaining equilibrium of balance, and are composed of the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. They are extremely sensitive to variations in sound and gravity. Furthermore, they are closely connected to the brain.\n\n17\n\nThe Lateral Line System In fishes, the lateral line system detects water movement. Arranged along a line down the length of the body are two waterfilled canals, just under the skin. The canals are open to the outside, and water movements cause water to move in the canals. Nerve endings detect the movements. A system of sense organs in fishes and larval amphibians (tadpoles) that detects water movement, it usually consists of a row of interconnected pores on either side of the body that divide into a system of canals across the head.\n\nChemoreceptors Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli. Two very important chemoreceptive activities are the senses of taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction). Taste The taste bud, located on the tongue of animals, is the functional unit that permits us to discriminate between the tastes of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. Each taste bud contains many taste receptor cells. One of the important senses used by animals to find and sample food is taste. Animals detect tastes by gustatory receptors. In arthropods, these receptors are located on the mouthparts, feet and some other regions of the body. Many fishes and larval amphibians have taste buds distributed on the body surface and supplied by the facial nerve. Smell\n\nFigure: Lateral line system\n\nMost vertebrates can get information about their surroundings and neighbors by odor because they have an advanced ability to smell. For example, polar bears can detect their prey from 10 km away. In most terrestrial vertebrates olfactory receptors are located in a specific region from the rest of the nasal cavity. This region is known as the vomeronasal organ. Generally this organ is connected to the mouth cavity by a pair of passages.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nInsect Insects may have about 100,000 hairs on each antena. Each hair is one olfactory organ (nose). Figure: Tongue\n\n18\n\nPheromones are specific substances secreted by animals. They are a means of chemical communication. These chemicals are usually detected by the vomeronasal organs of most terrestrial vertebrates.\n\nPhotoreceptors specialize in detecting light by using pigments to absorb light energy. Most animals have photoreceptors. Rudimentary eyes, called eyespots, detect only light. Image formation needs a complex eye that is usually equipped with a lens (structure that focuses light onto a group of photoreceptors). There are two complex eyes in animals: the camera eye of vertebrates and some mollusks (squids and octopods), and the compound eye of arthropods. In vertebrates, the light-sensitive structure is the retina. Photoreceptor cells in the retina are called rods and cones, based on their shapes. Rods function in dim light, enabling us to see shapes and environment. Cones are responsible for sight and for color vision. Binocular vision, crucial to distance and depth perception, enables both eyes to focus on the same thing. The specific placement of the eyes can provide a variety of benefits for the animal. For example, zebra eyes are positioned to let the animal see in two directions, while the location of the eyes within the orbits of the hippopotamus is elevated, enabling the animal to see even when most of its body is immersed in water. The Vertebrate Eye Different organisms have different types of eyes for detecting light. The eyes of vertebrates are similar to each other in structure and function, resembling a simple camera. The eyeball and accessory structures are parts of the vertebrate eye. The eyeball is made of three parts:\n\nFigure.: Eye structures in different organisms\n\nScorpions can detect air moving at only 0.072 km/hr with special hairs on their pincers. They can have as many as 12 eyes.\n\nStarfish arms are covered with light sensitive cells. Light that projects on an “eyespot” on each arm causes the arm to move.\n\nSclera Choroid Retina The eye is like a camera. The external object is seen like the camera takes the picture of any object. Light enters the eye through a small hole called the pupil and is focused on the retina, which is like camera film. The eye also has a focusing lens, which focuses images from different distances on the retina. The colored ring of the eye, the iris, controls the amount of light entering the eye. It closes when light is bright and opens when light is dim. A tough white sheet called the sclera covers the outside of the eye. The front of this sheet (sclera) is transparent in order to allow the light to enter the eye, the cornea. Ciliary muscles in ciliary bodies control the focusing of the lens automatically.\n\nChameleon The eyes of the chameleon can move independently. Therefore, it can see in two different directions at the same time.\n\n19\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nPhotoreceptors\n\nKeenest vision Falcons can see a 10 cm. object from a distance of 1.5 km.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nVisual acuity is 2.6 times better than humans, who can see sharp images even when diving at 100 miles/hr.\n\nFigure: The structure of vertebrate eye\n\n20\n\nThe choroid forms the vascular layer of the eye supplying nutrition to the eye structures. Images are formed on the retina. Stimuli arriving here are transmitted by the optic nerve to the CNS, and vision is produced. The image is finally perceived by the brain. A jelly-like substance called vitreous humour fills the space between the lens and retina. The lens, iris and cornea are nourished by a clear fluid, aqueous humour, formed by the ciliary body and filling the space between lens and cornea. This space is known as the anterior chamber. The fluid flows from the ciliary body to the pupil and is absorbed through the channels in the angle of the anterior chamber. The delicate balance of aqueous production and absorption controls pressure within the eye.\n\nREAD ME\n\nCompound eye\n\nAll compound eyes have a geometric pattern. Most crustacea and insects possess this type of eye, which is a highly functional organ of observation since the insect can perceive objects in its field of vision from slightly different angles. Compound eyes differ from those of vertebrate eyes both morphologically and functionally. The focusing of an object and the formation of an image in a compound eye, for example, is completely different. The ability to collect light is poor in a compound eye. However, the field of vision is wider than that of vertebrates, since each unit of a compound eye scans only a marginal area. A scorpion for example, can observe its environment through an angle of 200°. The compound eye is composed of many repeating units ranging from only a few to thirtythousand. Each unit has its own optical system. The outermost layer is a hexagonal cornea. Directly beneath the cornea are four conical cells known as the iris. The retina, consisting of light cells, forms the basal layer.\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nThe number of cells in each optical unit varies according to the type of organism. Since each unit is separated from the others by pigment cells, each unit is optically isolated. Insects do not focus light and can use UV light to find food or mates.\n\nFigure.: The compound eye of an insect, with longitudinal detail of one optical unit\n\n21\n\nPit vipers Pit vipers are poisonous snake with long, hollow, erectile fangs that are folded back against the roof of the mouth except when the snake is striking. In addition, the pit vipers have developed special organs of heat reception that help them to sense warm-blooded animals, an ability that is especially useful at night, when many of them hunt. These organs consist of pits, for which the group is named, located just behind the nostrils and covered with a temperature-sensitive membrane. Some pit vipers may also use these organs to find cool refuges from inhospitable daytime temperatures.\n\nThermoreceptors Thermoreceptors detect changes in temperature. Specific nerve endings that feel heat are present within specialized cells and free nerve endings in the skin and tongues of animals. The Pit Organ The pit organ is located between the nostril and the eye on each side of the head. It is supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The pit has a thermoreceptor function and is sensitive to infrared radiation. It is capable of responding to changes in temperature of only fractions of a degree. Thus pit vipers can detect the presence of animals with body temperatures only slightly different from that of the environment.\n\nFigure.: Pit viper\n\nElectroreceptors\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nElectroreceptors are also found in some nonelectric fishes and in some amphibians. Even the duckbill platypus, a mammal, has electroreceptors (located in its bill). With these it can detect the weak currents created by the muscle activity of its prey (e.g., small crustaceans) as it noses around in the muddy bottom where it feeds.\n\n22\n\nElectroreceptors respond to electrical stimuli. Muscle activity can emit electrical fields that certain fish, such as sharks, make use of in locating prey. Many kinds of fish have electric organs, which are specific muscle or nerve cells that generate external electrical fields. Electric organs may help an animal determine orientation, particularly in muddy waters, Figure: Electric eel. where visibility and olfaction are decreased. Electroreceptors also can help certain animals communicate. For example, electroreceptors can aid in locating a mate. In certain species of fish, males discharge a different frequency from females. Some other fish, such as electric eels, have electric organs that can deliver strong shocks capable of stunning prey or attackers.\n\nc. Circulatory System The simplest meaning of “being alive” is having the ability of energy production. In order to produce energy, body cells need food and oxygen. In complex multicellular organisms, there is a specialized transport system which carries oxygen and food to the cells. When energy is produced as a result of metabolic activities, some unnecessary (waste) products are also produced. To keep the body in homeostasis these unwanted substances must be removed. The transport system is also responsible for carrying off these substances to the organs which remove wastes. For instance, digested food (nutrients) is absorbed from the intestines and carried to all cells of the body by means of the circulatory system. When these nutrients are used, some wastes, including CO2 and urea, are produce. They are then carried to either lungs or to the kidneys to be removed from the body.\n\nFigure: The grasshopper has an open circulatory system. Its blood flows throughout the body cavity as well as in the blood vessels.\n\nOpen circulatory system (OCS)\n\nIn organisms with an OCS, such as arthropods and mollusks, blood is pumped into an artery, from the artery to the body cavity, then to veins (after material exchange between the blood and body cells), and back to the heart.\n\nBlood is not always red. Some animals have blue or green blood.\n\nClosed circulatory system (CCS) Organisms with closed circulatory systems (segmented worms, cephalopods and all vertebrates), have capillaries between arteries and veins. Very tiny blood vessels, capillaries are the site of material exchange. Blood never leaves the blood vessels. A true circulatory system includes a heart, blood and blood vessels. Blood is fluid containing special cells and plasma. Blood cells are erythrocytes (red blood cells), that give blood its red color and are responsible for carrying gases, leukocytes (white blood cells), which protect the body from infection, and thrombocytes, responsible for blood clotting. The heart is the most important part of the circulatory system. It is the pumping organ which pumps the blood to the body cells. Its structure is different in different organisims.\n\nFigure: Earthworms are the most primitive organisms with a closed circulatory system.\n\nd. Respiratory System Under the topic of the circulatory system, it was mentioned that nutrients and oxygen are needed for energy production. When these two react with each other in special parts of the cells, energy and wastes, including CO2, are produced.\n\n23\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nOCS consists of a pump (heart), veins and arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that take blood from the heart to all parts of the body, while veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart from all parts of the body.\n\nRespiration is the exchange of gases between an organism and its environment (taking in oxygen and releasing CO2). There are different organs used as respiratory organs by different organisms, including body surfaces, gills, trachea and lungs. Trachea is a system of pipes. Branches of these pipes penetrate all tissues to facilitate the diffusion of gases into all regions of the body. Mollusks, echinoderms, crustaceans, fish and amphibians respire with gills. The most important feature of gills is that they absorb oxygen dissolved in water. Adult amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals respire through lungs. The lungs and complementary structures of these organisms have some unique features. Mammals have two lungs, located in the chest cavity. The respiratory pathway includes the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. The sites of gas exchange, alveoli, are covered with millions of capillaries. Oxygen absorbed from the alveoli is transported to the body via the circulatory system, and carbon dioxide is brought to the lungs to be exhaled.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nFigure.: Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged at alveoli and tissues.\n\nFigure.: Respiratory organs of different organisms\n\n24\n\ne. Digestive System Organisms obtain the energy required for all their metabolic functions, growth, and the repair of their damaged tissues, from food. There are five major categories of food, according to its composition. Carbohydrates\n\nLipids\n\nMinerals\n\nWater\n\nProteins\n\nIn digestion, food is ingested from the medium, then hydrolyzed into its sub-units and absorbed from the digestive canal into the bloodstream. In all animals, vitamins and water pass directly into the bloodstream without any digestion. Carbohydrates, lipids and proteins need to be digested into their components.\n\nThe digestion process takes place in certain steps, as follows: 1. Ingestion of food: Food is taken from the external medium into the body.\n\nFigure: Comparsion of carnivore and herbivore digestive system.\n\n2. Mechanical digestion: Food is physically ground or chewed into smaller pieces by teeth, in the mouth.\n\n4. Absorption: The final stage of digestion. The subunits of food pass into the bloodstream. Digestion can take place inside cells. In intracellular digestion, food is taken into food vacuoles and digested. Extracellular digestion occurs when cells secrete enzymes to digest the food outside the body. The digested food then enters the cell through the cell membrane, by diffusion. Extracellular digestion is seen in invertebrates and in all vertebrates. In invertebrates: In lower animals there is no particular digestive system, but some specialized cells (primitive organs) carry out this function inside a digestive tract.\n\nFigure: The simple digestive system of a planarian.\n\nIn vertebrates: Among vertebrates, primitive as well as well-developed digestive systems and organs are observed. Vertebrates have a mouth, teeth, tongue, esophagus, stomach, and intestines as digestive organs. Birds have a beak instead of teeth, and a gizzard to soften and grind the food. Mammals have the best developed digestive structures among the animals. Organisms can be classified according to their diet. Carnivores eat meat, herbivores eat plants, and omnivores eat both meat and plants. Digestion of plant matter is difficult so herbivores have long digestive tracts. Scavengers feed on dead animals and decomposers provide material recycling.\n\nFigure: The digestive system of an earthworm\n\n25\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\n3. Chemical digestion: A series of chemical reactions in which food is hydrolyzed by water and enzymes.\n\nf. Excretory System Digestion of food and uptake of oxygen were already mentioned in previous sections. Digested food and oxygen are transported to the cells by the circulatory system. The cells utilize these molecules in their metabolism to produce energy. In addition to energy, some other, unnecessary metabolic wastes are produced, e.g., CO2, urine, excess water. In this section, the methods of excreting waste products from the animal body will be examined. In brief, excretion is the elimination of metabolic wastes from the body.\n\nExcretion In Invertebrates Excretion in lower animals, such as planarian, is carried out by protonephridia, which consist of tubules and interconnected flame cells. In earthworms and mollusks, the excretion organs are nepridia that eliminate NH3 and CO2 directly from the body via anal openings. Insects excrete CO2 by means of tracheal vessels, and nitrogenous wastes by way of the Malpighian tubules branched throughout the body.\n\nExcretion In Vertebrates The kidneys are the main excretory organ of vertebrates. There are three types of vertebrate kidney:\n\nFigure: The excretory system of a planaria\n\nPronephros kidney: This type of kidney is found in the embryonic stage of all vertebrates and in adult sharks. Mesonephros kidney: This type of kidney is found in the embryonic stage of reptiles, birds and mammals and in the adult form of fish and amphibian.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nMetanephros kidney: This type of kidney is found in adult reptiles, birds and mammals including humans. Metanephros kidneys are found in pairs and are located in the abdomen of the body. Each kidney contains millions of nephrons.\n\nFigure: Kidney\n\n26\n\nFigure: The excretory structures of an arthropod.\n\nUrogenital system The excretory and reproductive systems of vertebrates are interrelated and this complex is known as the urogenital system. The first excretory channel, or Muller channel, splits into two and is also known as a wolf channel. It is blind-ended in males but develops into the reproductive channel in females. This channel and its associated structures originate from the Muller channel during embryonic development. In fish and amphibians, it functions as part of both the excretory and reproductive systems. In birds and reptiles its function is limited to that of reproduction. The wolf channel is lost in females during postnatal development. In males however, it contributes to the reproductive system.\n\nAll vertebrates except mammals have a cloaca through which urine and undigested nutrients are removed. The same organ also forms part of the reproductive system. In mammals however, a separate organ exists for the expulsion of urine and for reproduction.\n\nAll vertebrates excluding mammals have a single channel through which all waste is excreted. The same channel also forms part of the reproductive system. In mammals however, a separate channel exists for the expulsion of waste and for reproduction.\n\ng. Locomotion In Animals Like all multicellular organisms, animals also need support structures: the skeletal and muscular systems. The skeletal and muscular systems of animals enable locomotion and support, with the help of the nervous and endocrine systems. The locomotion system carries out the following functions: Support the animal body\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nContribute to locomotion Provide body shape Protect internal organs Store some minerals Produce blood cells\n\nSkeletal System Two skeleton types are observed among animals: Exoskeleton Endoskeleton\n\n27\n\nFigure: Exoskeleton in some animals.\n\nExoskeleton gives power The strongest animal, relative to body size, is the Rhinoceros Beetle. It can support 850 times its own body weight on its back. Consider that, in human terms, it would be as if an 80 kg man could carry 68,000 kg. ....bet his back is sore in the morning!!!\n\nExoskeleton: An exoskeleton forms the complete outer covering around the animal’s body. Structurally it is composed of organic and inorganic substances. It is made of compounds secreted by cells, and contains no living structures. Snails, oysters, and clams have calcium carbonate shells. When these animals grow, they change their exoskeleton by secreting a larger one. The exoskeleton is a hard structure, very useful for protecting animals from enemies, but external skeletons restrict the growth of organisms. An exoskeleton is a characteristic of some invertebrates. Crustaceans, such as lobsters and many insects, have an exoskeleton made of chitin, a complex sugar. Chitin is a nitrogenous polysaccharide and has a unique quality in that its light and hard structure imposes no limit on the movement of an organism. The shells of middies and snails are composed of calcium carbonate. The heavy weight of this exoskeleton restricts the ability of the organism to move.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nThe exoskeleton limits the growth capacity of organisms. During development, some organisms shed their exoskeleton and generate a larger one. This process is known as ecdysis, and only occurs during development from a juvenile to an adult form. Conversely, middies and snails continue to grow by adding new sections to their shell. Scorpions soften the exoskeleton at the back of their body by excreting excess salt. The animal leaves its exoskeleton through the softened region. It then grows rapidly and generates a larger one. This process is hazardous since the organism has no protection against its enemies until its new exoskeleton has hardened.\n\n28\n\nEndoskeleton : All vertebrates, starfish, and sponges have an internal skeleton. The internal skeleton does not limit the growth of the organism. In most vertebrates, the skeleton is cartilaginous during embryonic development, but later is ossified. However, it persists as cartilage throughout life in sharks and rays. Vertebrate Skeleton During embryonic development, the skeleton of fish and higher organisms is cartilaginous in structure. This structure is then ossified by the deposition of minerals. The cartilaginous skeleton of sharks however, persists throughout their life span. Fish Skeleton The fish skeleton can be examined in detail in dogfish (a kind of small shark). The axial skeleton is composed of several parts. The vertebral column consists of vertebrae. Intervertebral discs fill the space between vertebrae. These discs distribute force equally from one vertebra to the other. Short ribs are attached to the vertebrae. The skull involves the brain, eyes, nose and inner ear. No sternum is present. The dogfish has a simple appendicular skeleton. A pectoral girdle, U-shaped cartilage, supports the pectoral fins. Similarly, a pelvic girdle supports the pelvic fins.\n\nTerrestrial vertebrates have skeletons with a high capacity for movement and support. The vertebrate skeleton can be classified into axial skeleton (composed of vertebral column, ribs, sternum and skull) and appendicular skeleton (girdles, limbs) The vertebral column is the most important supporting structure in the tetrapod skeleton and is composed of repeating units of vertebrae. The skull is composed of cranial bones and facial bones. Cranial bones protect the brain, whereas facial bones surround the eye sphere, nasal cavity and mouth. The appendicular skeleton of tetrapods is composed of upper and lower extremities. The bones of the skeletal system are covered with muscles which, by contracting and relaxing, provide for movement of the skeleton. There are three main types of muscle in animals.\n\nFigure: A dog is good example of an organism that has an endoskeleton.\n\n29\n\nMulticellular Organisation and Animal Physology\n\nTetrapod Skeleton\n\nThe Muscular System Of Vertebrates Vertebrates have both smooth and striated muscle in their body structures. Striated muscle articulates with the skeletal system to provide movement, whereas smooth muscle is involved in the activities of internal organs. 1. Smooth muscle: Involuntary muscles found in the internal organs, like the stomach and intestines. 2. Striated muscle: Voluntary skeletal muscles, attached to bones. They are necessary for locomotion. 3. Cardiac muscle: Involuntary muscles that form the heart structure. Stronger and more branched than other muscles.\n\nTHE MAJOR VERTEBRATE ORGAN SYSTEMS\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nSYSTEM\n\nFUNCTIONS\n\nCOMPONENTS\n\nCirculatory\n\nTransports cells and chemical compounds through- Heart, blood vessels, blood, lymph, and lymph strucout the body tures\n\nDigestive\n\nBreaks down food molecules into diffusable form\n\nMouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas\n\nEndocrine\n\nCoordinates and integrates the activities of the body\n\nPituitary, adrenal, thyroid, and other glands\n\nImmune\n\nRemoves foreign bodies from the bloodstream; Lymphocytes, macrophages, and antibodies maintains homeostasis of the blood\n\nIntegumentary\n\nCovers and protects the body\n\nSkin, hair, nails, and sweat glands\n\nMuscular\n\nProvides body movement\n\nSkeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth mucle\n\nNervous\n\nReceives stimuli, integrates information and directs Nerves, sense organs, brain and spinal cord the body\n\nReproductive\n\nCarries out reproduction\n\nRespiratory\n\nExchanges of gases\n\nSkeletal\n\nProtects the body and provides support for locomoBones, cartilage, and ligaments tion and movement\n\nUrinary\n\nRemoves metabolic wastes from the body\n\n30\n\nTestes, ovaries, and associated reproductive structures Lung, trachea, and other air passageways\n\nKidney, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra and associated organs\n\nzoology\n\nchapter\n\n2\n\nAnimal Classification System There are lots of different types of organisms out there. The science of naming and classifying organisms is called taxonomy. Taxonomy attempts to organize all of these organisms into increasingly smaller and smaller groups until you are left with a group of all the same type of organism (namely, a species). The founder of modern systematics was Carl von Linnaeus. He applied his binominal nomenclature method to plants (in 1753) and to animals (1758) in his book Systema Naturae. Phylogenetic systematics used today depends on Linnaean systematics and homology. Homology is used in determining the level of relatedness, e.g. bats and cats are in the group mammalia. The basis of modern systematics is the grouping of organisms according to similarities. In the classification of organisms, the following criteria are used: Figure: Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778).\n\n origins,\n\n relatedness,\n\n developmental stages.\n\nIn the binomial system created by Linnaeus, species is the basic unit of nomenclature. A species is a group of organisms from the same population sharing the same embryological, morphological, and physiological features, and are capable of giving birth to fertile offspring when mated under natural conditions There are two points in Linnaeus' hypothesis:  There is an ideal type for each species. This ideal type represents the standard features of every single individual of the species.  The number of species and their types is constant and unchangeable. According to Linnaean systematics, a species is named with two names. First is the genus name with the first letter capitalized. Second is the specific epithet (species name) and the first letter is not capitalized. Both are written in italics and in Latin. The reason for this is to have a single name in the scientific world, thus simplifying the study of species. For example, Canis familiaris is the name for dogs, whereas Canis lupus is the wolf. The first name (Canis) shows that these two species are in the same genus.\n\nKINGDOM\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nFigure: Systema Naturae.\n\nPhylum\n\nChordata\n\nSubphylum\n\nVertebrata\n\nClass\n\nMammalia\n\nOrder\n\nCarnivore\n\nFamily\n\nCanidae\n\nGenus\n\nCanis\n\nSpecies\n\nCanis lupus (wolf)\n\nSpecies\n\nCanis familiaris (dog)\n\nFigure: Classification of canis\n\n32\n\nANIMALIA\n\nA group of species similar in some characteristics forms a genus, similar genera form a family, similar families form an order, similar orders form a class and similar classes form a phylum. Similar phyla form a kingdom.\n\nFigure: Members of genus Canis: Canis lupus and Canis familiaris\n\nFigure: Organisms first get classified into one of five KINGDOMS. Each kingdom has certain defining characteristics. The kingdoms, which are a large and varied group of organisms, then get divided up into smaller subgroups (called phyla), which in tern get subdivided, and so on ... A kingdom then, is the largest group. Within a kingdom you have organisms that share certain characteristics. At the same time, organisms in the same kingdom can be very different from one another. For example cats, frogs, eagles, salmon, hydra, earthworms, grasshoppers, and clams are all animals, and yet they are all quite different from each other. So we take the wide variety of organisms in a kingdom and subdivide them into other groups. The subgroups (from largest to smallest) are: KINGDOM, PHYLUM, CLASS, ORDER, FAMILY, GENUS, SPECIES Classification units. As you go from species to kingdom the number of organisms and variety increases while from kingdom to species the number of organisms and variety decreases. Organisms with common features form a species.\n\n33\n\nAnimal Classification System\n\nIn this system, species level has the largest number of common features and the least number of individuals compared to the higher levels. As you go up, common features decrease while the number of individuals increases. So the fewest common characteristics and the highest number of individuals are found in the kingdoms. The table below shows the classification of several species.\n\n1. General Characteristics Of Animals Animals are some of the most common organisms found from the oceans to the high mountains. Except for some animals like sponges, most animals are easily differentiated from other groups (e.g. plants or fungi). For definite separation, the characteristics used are these:  All animals are eukaryotes and metazoan (multicellular).  All animals are heterotrophs. Most digest their food internally.  Most animals are motile during at least a certain period of their life.  Many animals have a well-developed nervous system and sensory organs.  Most animals reproduce sexually. The organism develops from a zygote through embryonic stages.  Animals possess organs for respiration, excretion, and circulation, except for primitive phyla which use diffusion for these functions.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nOver one million species are already known to science, and millions more are expected to be discovered in the future. A minority (5%) of all animals are vertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone. Those without a backbone are called invertebrates. Examples of the latter, much larger group are sponges, jellyfish, insects, snails, etc.\n\n34\n\n2. Animal Anatomy a. Cellular Organization All animals are made up of cells. Organized groups of cells form tissues, organs and systems. The diversity and organization level of cells become more complex in higher groups. Different functions, e.g. respiration, reproduction, feeding and protection, are performed by different cell groups. Organ systems form the organism and work in harmony. Diversity and organization of cells is a factor in the classification of animals.\n\nb. Symmetry Except for a few groups, the majority of animals exhibit bilateral symmetry and can be divided into parts e.g. head, torso and limbs. For identifying various features of such animals, the terms anterior, posterior, dorsal and ventral are used. In the same way, for understanding the inner structures, vertical, transversal, and horizontal planes (sections) are defined.\n\nFigure: Terms used for determination of symmetry in animals\n\nSymmetry is the presence of one or more planes that divide an organism into identical sections. Parazoans (sponges) are asymmetrical (no equal parts). In metazoans, radial (cnidaria) and bilateral (many groups) symmetry is seen. Organisms with radial symmetry can be divided into equal pieces by any number of planes passing through the main body axis. Bilaterally symmetric animals can be divided into two pieces by a single longitudinal medial plane. Figure: (Hydra) Animals exhibiting radial symmetry can be divided by any number of planes passing though the body axis. (Fish) In bilateral symmetry, an animal can be divided by only one longitudinal plane passing through the axis.\n\nAnimal Classification System\n\nGenerally, slow or sessile animals have radial symmetry, whereas faster animals have bilateral symmetry. Examples of the former are jellyfish, hydra and some sponges. All higher organisms including mammals are bilaterally symmetric.\n\n35\n\nc. Embryonic Layers At the beginning of embryonic development, cells are arranged in two or three embryonic tissue layers, called germ layers, from which organs and systems will be produced. Two layers (ectoderm and endoderm) are seen in sponges and cnidarians. All higher animals have an additional intermediate layer (mesoderm) that is present in the embryo. The outer germ layer, called the ectoderm, gives rise to the outer covering of the body and to the nervous system (if the animal has one). The inner layer, or endoderm, forms the lining of the digestive tract. Mesoderm, the middle layer, gives rise to most of the other body structures, including the muscles, bones, and circulatory system\n\nd. Body Cavity Animals can be classified based on the presence (or absence) and type of body cavity. The body cavity is a fluidfilled space between the outer body wall and the digestive tube.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nThe flatworms have three germ layers and a solid body with a single opening to the outside used as mouth and anus. These animals have no body cavity and are called acoelomates (without coelom or body cavity)\n\nFigure: Embryonic development\n\n36\n\nFigure: In the classification of animals, body cavites are one of the most basic criteria. In earthworms and simpler organisms, the only body cavity is the digestive tract. In higher groups, including mollusks, there is an additional cavity called the coelom.\n\nOther, more complex animals generally have a tube-within-a-tube body plan. The outer tube is the body wall. It is covered with tissue that develops from ectoderm. Tissue developed from endoderm lines the inner tube (the digestive tract, or gut) which has two openings, the mouth and the anus. Beneath the ectoderm, the outer tube often consists of tissue developed from mesoderm. The space between the two tubes is the body cavity. If the body cavity is not completely lined with mesoderm it is called a pseudocoelom (\"false coelom\"). Animals with a pseudocoelom are called pseudocoelomates, such as roundworms and rotifers. In more complex animals, the body cavity is completely lined with mesoderm. Such a body cavity is a true coelom. Only animals with true coeloms are referred to as coelomates. Based on their pattern of early development, animals can be classified as protostomes or deuterostomes. During embryonic development, the embryo consists of a little ball of cells known as a blastula. A group of cells move inward to form an opening called the blastopore. In most of the mollusks, annelids, and arthropods, this opening develops into the mouth. These animals are protostomes (from Greek words meaning \"first, the mouth\").\n\nThese animals are echinoderms (for example, sea stars and sea urchins) and chordates (the phylum that includes the vertebrates),\n\ne. Analogous Organs These are organs generally similar in shape and function. For instance, wings in butterflies or birds provide flight, whereas legs in flies and cats function in walking. But these organs are embryologically different. Therefore we say that butterflies and birds aren't related.\n\nFigure: Body cavities of organisms\n\n37\n\nAnimal Classification System\n\nIn deuterostomes (\"second, the mouth\") the blastopore does not give rise to the mouth. It develops into the anus. The opening that develops into the mouth forms later in development.\n\nf. Homologous Organs Some similarities may be seen in structures seemingly unrelated in appearance. For instance, a monkey's arm seems quite different from a bat's wing. But these are seen to be similar both anatomically and embryological. Organs sharing the same origin and similar embryological stages are called homologous organs. Functions of homologous organs may be the same or different. Homologous organs are the basis of modern classification.\n\ng. Segmentation Some animals are segmented (annelids, etc.) while some lack segments (vertebrates). Segments may be identical, although different in size.\n\nh. Body Systems Animals can be classified according to their body systems. Skeleton: Many animals have hard tissues functioning as support structures. These structures differ in their chemical composition, e.g. bone, cartilage, or structures made of silica, calcium carbonate, keratin or chitin. Chemical composition of the skeleton is important in classification. Bony or cartilaginous skeletons are found in vertebrates, whereas invertebrates have other skeletal forms. Animals intermediate to invertebrates and vertebrates are called primitive chordates and their vertebrae (backbone) are called notochords. Circulatory System: The circulatory system of animals may be one of two types: open or closed. In a closed circulatory system, blood flows inside vessels. Hemoglobin carries O2 and CO2 in the blood and is found in the plasma (in annelids) or inside erythrocytes (in all vertebrates). Nervous System: Primitive invertebrates (sponges) have no nervous system. In coelenterates there is a nerve net (diffuse ganglions). The simplest, \"ladder-type\" nervous system is first seen in the flatworms. The nervous system lies along the ventral surface in invertebrates and along the dorsal surface in vertebrates. Respiration: Respiration mechanisms vary among animal groups. Gas exchange occurs through the body surface in sponges, cnidarians, and flatworms. Fishes and larval amphibian have gills. Trachea are the respiratory organ of many arthropods. Mature amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals breathe with lungs. Excretory System: According to the level of organization, animals have different excretory systems. Poriferans and Cnidarians have no excretory system and their wastes pass by diffusion. Protonephridia (flatworms), nephridia (annelids), and Malpighian tubules (arthropods) are common excretory organs.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nKidneys are the excretory organs of vertebrates, but they differ in various vertebrate groups. A mesonephros system is present in the embryos of all birds, reptiles, and mammals, and in mature fishes and amphibia, while a metanephros type is found only in mature reptiles, birds and mammals.\n\n38\n\nzoology\n\nchapter\n\n3\n\nAnimal Systematics There are millions of different animal species around the world. Because of this diversity, all groups have to be studied separately. In this chapter, kingdom Animalia will be divided into the sections porifera, coelenterata, platyhelminthes, nemertea, nematoda, rotifera, mollusca, annelida, arthropoda, echinodermata and chordata. We will now explore the great diversity of animals according to their similarities and differences. Biologists have identified more than a million species of animals. Several million more remain to be discovered and classified. Most biologist divide kingdom Animalia into 35 different phyla. Actually the Animal Kingdom consists of two subkingdoms. 1. Subkingdom Parazoa: Animals that lack a definite symmetry and have no tissue nor organs. The subkingdom Parazoa includes phylum porifera. 2. Subkingdom Eumetazoa: Animals that have a definite shape and symmetry. Mostly they have true tissue and organs. It includes all animal phyla except porifera.\n\nKINGDOM ANIMALIA Name of Phylum Parazoa\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nEumetazoa\n\n40\n\nBody Symmetry\n\nBody Cavity\n\nEmbryonic Development\n\nPhylum Porifera\n\nAsymmetry\n\nAcoelomate\n\nPhylum Cnidaria\n\nRadial Symmetry\n\nAcoelomate\n\nPhylum Ctenophora\n\nRadial Symmetry\n\nAcoelomate\n\nPhylum Platyhelminthes\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nAcoelomate\n\nPhylum Nemertea\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nAcoelomate\n\nPhylum Nematoda\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nPseudocoelomate\n\nPhylum Rotifera\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nPseudocoelomate\n\nPhylum Mollusca\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nCoelomate\n\nProstomata\n\nPhylum Annelida\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nCoelomate\n\nProstomata\n\nPhylum Arthropoda\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nCoelomate\n\nProstomata\n\nPhylum Echinodermata\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nCoelomate\n\nDeuterostamate\n\nPhylum Chordata\n\nBilateral Symmetry\n\nCoelomate\n\nDeuterostamate\n\nNOT APPLICABLE\n\n1. Phylum Porifera (Sponges)\n\nHabitat: They are mainly marine animals with the exception of a few freshwater groups. Today there are about 10,000 species alive. Only about 1% of the species live in freshwater. They are sessile and mostly attach themselves to hard surfaces like rocks and shells. They may be flat, ball or vase-shaped. Their size varies from a milimeter to 200 cm in length. They may be yellow, grey, red, blue or even black in color. Body structure: Sponges are the simplest animals. In Latin, porifera means \"having pores\". Actually this indicates their body structure. They have a lot of pores on the body through which water is taken to the body cavity. Sponges belong to the subkingdom parazoa. Parazoans are asymmetrical animals so sponges do not have symmetry. But a few species have radial symmetry. One of the other characteristics of parazoans is that they are diploblastic animals. They have only two germ layers: ectoderm and endoderm.\n\nHow fast Some sponges are able to move about 4 mm per day.\n\n41\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nFor a long time people thouth that sponges were plants because they don’t look or act like most animals you know. Like plants, adult sponges are immobile, but all other features qualify them as members in the animal kingdom.\n\nThey don't have any specific type of tissue, system or organ. The body wall is covered by ephithelial cells. Lining the inside cavity of the sponge are specialized, flagellated cells called choanocytes or collar cells. Choanocytes are also responsible for food transport and function in digestion, respiration and excretion. Moreover, they help keep the water moving by beating their flagella. Between the two layers is a gelatinous intermediate layer called mesohyl. The mesohyl includes special ameboid cells which secrete hard spicule and spongin. Ameboid cells are also resbonsible for reproduction. Supporting the body: Sponges have an endoskeleton and differ on the basis of the type of skeleton they secrete. Some species secrete a skeleton of calcium carbonate, some have a skeleton made of spicules containing silicon, and some others have skeletons of a protein known as spongin. These spicules support the organism.\n\nFigure: Structure of sponges. Pores connect the inner cavity to the outer surface. A section from the body wall shows spicules, choanocytes and epidermal cells with pores.\n\nFigure: The reproduction of sponge\n\nGetting food and oxygen: Moving water carries food and removes wastes. It is the key to the sponge's survival.They are filter feeders that filter the water passing through the pores to trap particles or plankton. Collar cells trap these food particles and digest them. A sponge gets its O2 from water too. O2 moves from the water into the sponge’s cells by difussion. Difussion also removes waste from the sponge. Reproduction in Sponges: In Porifers, reproduction is sexual or asexual. Asexual Reproduction in Sponge: Budding or regeneration are asexual forms of reproduction. In budding, small new sponges grow from the sides of adult sponges. Eventually these tiny sponges detach and form a new sponge on or near the parent sponge. Sponges have a remarkable ability for regeneration. When injured they can repair themselves and regenerate lost parts. When the cells of sponges are separated from one another in the lab they regenerate, forming a complete sponge again. Sexual Reproduction in Sponge: Most sponges are hermaphroditic: male and female gametes are produced by the same sponge. But some others may be monoic. That is, the gametes are produced by different individuals. In the sponge body, some Amoebocytes develop into sperm cells and others into egg cells. However, hermaphrodite sponges usually produce egg and sperm at different times, and they cross fertilize with other sponges.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nMature sperm are released into the water and taken in by other sponges. Fertilization (internal) and early development take place within the jelly-like mesohyl. The embryo eventually moves into the spongocoel and leaves the parent along with the stream of out-flowing water. After swimming about for a while, the larva finds a solid object, attaches to it and settles down to a sessile life. 42\n\n2. Cnidaria (Coelenterates) These animals get their name from their stinging cells, called cnidocytes (from a Greek word meaning \"sea nettles\"). Coelenterate means \"hollow (animal)\" in Greek.\n\nBody structure: Like sponges, Cnidarians are diploblastic (have two cell layers). However, cnidarians are more complex than sponges because their two cell layers form tissues. There are two dermal layers in hydra: ectoderm and endoderm. The outer epidermis is a protective layer which has a nerve net and muscle fibers that control or coordinate body movements. Another type of cell is cnidocytes, which contain stinging nematocysts and function in feeding and protection. There is an intermediate gelatinous layer, mesoglea, which is the common product of the two layers.\n\nLargest Creature The jellyfish Cyanea may be more than two meters in diameter and have 30 meter tentacles.\n\n43\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nLife style: There are over 10,000 species in this group. Most are marine but there are a few freshwater representatives. They live solitarily or in colonies.\n\nEndodermal cells, which form the gastrodermis, coat the gastrointestinal cavity. Some endodermal cells secrete mucus and digestive enzymes into the cavity. Flagellated cells lining the body cavity circulate water inside the cavity and function in digestion and absorption of food. Cnidarians have radial symmetry and they have a hollow body with one opening, the mouth. Surrounding the mouth are arm-like structure called tentacles. In general they have two body forms, polyp and medusa. Polyp: These are sessile (immobile) forms. Their bodies are tubular, one opening functioning as mouth and anus. Around the opening there are many stinging tentacles. Figure: The simple structure of a cnidarian eye.\n\nMedusa: These swim freely in the water. They have a flat umbrella and jelly-like body. Some groups have both forms (medusa and polyp) in their lives. But others have one of the stages, polyp or medusa, their entire life.\n\nFigure: Medusa form of cnidaria.\n\nHow Cnidarians move: The contractile cells in the epidermis and endodermis provide movment. The cells, together with the water-filled gastrovascular cavity, form a hydrostatic skeleton that supports the body and allows movement by contracting and relaxing. So the cnidarian can shorten, lengthen, or bend its body. Getting food and performing body functions: Digestion occurs in the gastrovascular cavity. They use cnidocytes to capture animals for food. Figure: Polyp form of cnidaria.\n\nThey inject venom, a poisonus substance that paralyzes fish and other prey. Then the cnidarians’ tentacles pull the prey animal to its mouth. They have a digestive cavity with one opening, so undigested food is expelled through the mouth. Cnidarians are simple animals with no special body systems. However, the first nerve cells in the animal kingdom are found in this group. They have a nerve net that coordinates body functions. Also, cnidarians have a simple photoreceptor (simple eye). They have no special respiratory nor excretory systems. These functions are carried out by simple diffusion.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nReproduction in Cnidarians: They can reproduce either asexually or sexually. In sexual reproduction, a larval stage (planula) is present.\n\n44\n\nThere are 3 classes in the phylum Cnidaria (Coelenterata):  Hydrozoa\n\n Scyphozoa\n\na. Hydrozoa (Hydra)\n\n Anthozoa\n\nPortuguese manof-war anemones can grow up to 61 meters long.\n\nNearly 2700 mainly marine species, but some freshwater; both polyp and medusa stages in many species, some form colonies. This class includes hydra, obelia and the Portuguese man-of-war. Hydra is the typical representative of this group. Hydra have only polyp body form (appr. 5-6 mm in length), and live in streams, ponds and lakes. Aboral side is attached to the substrate. The mouth is positioned on the upper tip. Around the mouth there are 6-8 tentacles active in movement and feeding. Reproduction in Hydrozoa: They reproduce asexually by budding or regeneration, but they can also reproduce sexually. Sexual organs can be seen as small buds on the tubeshaped body. They may be hermaphroditic or monoic.\n\nFigure: Hydra anatomy\n\nObelia reproduce by metagenesis in their alternation between asexual and sexual reproduction. In the sexual stage, polyps for reproduction produce male and female medusae by budding. Free-swimming medusae reproduce sexually and form zygotes. Zygotes develop into swimming larvae called planula. Larvae attach to some solid object and devolop into a polyp which may form a new colony. Figure: Life cycle of obelia\n\n45\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nSome hydrozoans, such as Obelia sp., can form colonies. There is a remarkable organization in these animals. Some individuals of the colony are specialized for feeding, while some others lack tentacles and even a mouth, serving only in reproduction.\n\nb. Scyphozoa (jellyfish) They have nearly 200 species and all are umbrella-shaped, mostly pelagic, marine organisms. Their polyp forms are usually reduced. The jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) is an example of this group. They may attain large sizes. Coloration is translucent bluish or even pinkish. They are jell-like: 96% water by weight. They have photoreceptors and organs for balance and chemical reception. In Aurelia, the umbrella has 8 lobes. Lobes carry peripheral tentacles. In the center, there is a mouth and reproductive organs arranged around it. Scyphozoans have separate sexes. They include the largest invertebrates.\n\nFigure: Photographs and schematic view of jelly fish.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nThe sea wasp has the most potent venom of any creature on earth. It can kill a full grown man in three minutes with only one sting.\n\nFigure: Jelly Fish.\n\n46\n\nc. Anthozoa (Sea Anemones and Corals) Nearly 200 species, sea anemones and the colonial coral groups are anthozoans. This group is remarkable for lacking a medusa generation. Radial symmetry is seen in some members (sea anemones). Most are colonial and sessile. Tentacles encircling the mouth are present in general and they capture small plankton, and even fish and sea invertebrates. They usually reproduce sexually. A planula larva attaches itself to a hard surface, and a colony develops by budding (in colonial species). Calcium carbonate in the skeletal structure provides a hard covering in coral colonies. The accumulation of the skeletons of dead colonies creates coral reefs and atolls especially in the Pacific Ocean. Red coral is used in jewelry. Photosynhetic symbionts of corals and algae play an important role in the development of coral reefs.\n\nFigure.:A photograph and schematic view of a sea anemone.\n\nRepresentave Animals\n\nCharacteristic\n\nHydrozoa\n\nHydra, Obelia, Portuguese man-of-war.\n\nMainly marine, but some freshwater; both polyp and medusa stages in many species, some form colonies.\n\nScyphozoa\n\nJelly fish,\n\nMarine, live mainly in coastal water; free-swimming medusae most dominant forms.\n\nAnthozoa\n\nSea anemone, Corals\n\nMarine, sessile, solitary or colonial polyps; no medusa stage; large gastrovascular cavity for digestion.\n\nClass\n\nFigure.: Coral reef.\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nCLASS OF PHYLUM CNIDARIA\n\n47\n\nREAD ME\n\ncoral reef\n\nCoral reefs are among the most diverse and productive communities on Earth. They are found in the warm, clear, shallow waters of tropical oceans worldwide. Reefs are important land builders in tropical areas, forming islands and altering continental shorelines. Reefs have functions ranging from providing food and shelter to fish and invertebrates to protecting the shore from erosion. Through symbiosis with unicellular algae (zooxanthellae), reefbuilding corals are the source of primary production in reef communities. Biologically active compounds produced by reef-dwelling organisms possess antimicrobial and antiviral activity . These compounds may be important sources for natural-product-based drugs and medicines. Reefs are formed by calcium carbonate produced by tiny coral polyps. While corals are the chief architects of reef structure, they are not the only builders. Coralline algae cement various corals together with compounds of calcium, and other organisms such as tube worms and molluscs donate their hard skeletons. Because many coral reef organisms can tolerate only a narrow range of environmental conditions, reefs are sensitive to damage from environmental changes. Corals are susceptible to diseases and bleaching. Also, dramatic natural events such as hurricanes can damage coral reefs. In addition, many problems to reefs are anthropogenic (human caused). Because of the important ecological and economic roles coral reef communities fulfill, an understanding of the stresses and dangers to the reefs is necessary. Fortunately, many of the human induced hazards to coral reefs can be remedied. Why conserve coral reefs? Coral reefs are beautiful, diverse and important habitats on earth. The world needs its coral reefs.  They provide homes for more than a third of all known fish species and a myriad of other sea creatures.  They are nature's own front-line sea defense, protecting 100,000 km of coastline from storms and floods.  They provide the main source of animal protein for 1 billion people in Asia alone.  They are a source of medical compounds for treating leukemia, skin cancer and cardio-vascular diseases.  They provide a crucial source of fishing, tourism and other income to some of the world's poorest nations. Coral reefs are threatened by:\n\nZOOLOGY\n\n Commercial overfishing which is forcing many subsistence fishing communities to resort to poison, dynamite and other destructive methods;  Smothering run-off from rainforest clearance;  Pollution from factories, mines, agriculture and tourist developments;  Dredging, oil dumping and coral mining;  Irresponsible boating, diving and other recreational activities;  Climate change leading to rising seawater temperatures, lethal to corals.\n\n48\n\n3. Ctenophora (Comb jellies)\n\nThe largest animal using cilia for movement.\n\n49\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nThere are about 100 marine species. All are very delicate and often luminescent organisms. They acquire their name from their apperarence, with eight plates of fused cilia that resemble long combs.They are the largest animal using cillia for movement. They capture prey with either a long, sticky tentacle or entire mucuscovered sticky body . There is a thick mesoglea between the endoderm and ectoderm. Some have a pair of tentacles. Their sensory organs provide balance. They are more complex than cnidarins. They have an anal pore so that water and other substances pass completly through the animal’s body.\n\nZOOLOGY\n\n4. Platyhelminthes (Flatworms)\n\nTapeworm The adult tapeworm lives in the human intestine. Its body consists of scolex (head) and proglottids. Tapeworm causes weight loss, weakness and some other symptoms in humans.\n\n50\n\nThese are flattened, soft-bodied organisms, and are the first animals with bilateral symmetry and capalization. They are more complex than sponges and cnidarians. They have 3 tissue layers (triploblastic): ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. The mesoderm is found between the ectoderm and endoderm, from which some body systems develop, such as muscle, respiratory and excretory systems. There are 20,000 known species. They are mostly aquatic (marine or freshwater), but there are some terrestrial species of moist soil, and many parasitic species are found in various organisms. Parasitic species often lack digestive organs. They are mainly hermaphroditic. Flatworms possess parallel nerve nets extending along both sides of the body. These nets function as a primitive spinal column since they connect each segment of the body. In addition, the nerves from groups of nerve cells or ganglia at the head of the organism form a primitive brain. They don’t have special respiratory system. Gas exchange is provided by simple diffusion. Waste is excreted by means of protonephridia which consist of tubules and connected flame cells. The cilia of these flame cells is constantly in motion and elongates into tubules. The motion of the cilia resembles flames, hence the name. Waste and excess water is excreted by means of these ciliary movements, and the\n\nwater balance of the body is regulated by these flame-like protonephridia. NH3 and CO2 diffuse directly from the body.  Trematoda-Flukes  Cestoda-Tapeworms\n\na. Turbellaria (Turbellarians, Planarians) One of the best represented groups, Planaria are found under stones in streams. They feed on plant material and small animals. They are so flat that there is no need for a respiratory system, and gas exchange is by diffusion. Their size varies between 0.5-3 cm. Their outer surface is covered with ciliated epithelium. They move by means of cilia. There are two eyes on the head. There is a single, ventral opening in the center of the body functioning as mouth and anus. There are two nerve cords in a ladder system. Protonephridia (urinary organ) with flame cells constitute the excretory system. They may reproduce sexually or asexually. The ability of planaria to regenerate is relatively high. Every cut part of a planarian is able to turn into a complete animal.\n\nThey are free-living, flat bodied, freshwater creatures that exhibit the remarkable ability to regenerate their lost body parts. They can be conditioned to respond to stimuli, display the ability to master a two-choice maze, and can transfer the memory of training from one individual to another.\n\nPlanaria are hermaphroditic. In sexual reproduction, cross-fertilization occurs during copulation.\n\n51\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nPlanaria\n\nThere are 3 main classes:  Turbellaria-Turbellarians\n\nFigure: Planaria body structures\n\nb. Trematoda (Flukes) Flukes are found as parasites of vertebrates and they are usually named for the type of vertebrate organ they inhabit, such as blood fluke, liver fluke and lung fluke. Their body tends to be oval or elongate. At the anterior end they have oral and ventral suckers for attachment to the host. Their digestive system and nervous system are reduced, but they have extremly complex and efficient reproductive organs. They are either hermaphroditic or have separate sexes. Their excretory system has excretory canals.\n\nThe life cycle of blood flukes The adult fluke is generally hermaphroditic. Males and females remain permanentaly paired for life. Male produce sperm. Fertilization occurs in the veins of human intestines. Eggs pass into the intestine or urinary bladder (not shown in figure).\n\nFigure: Fluke anatomy\n\nDuring elimination or urination, egg-containing embryos leave the body within the feces or urine. If they find their way to fresh water, the embryos develop into free-swimming larvae called miracidia. To survive, the larvae must be ingested by another host, such as a snail. In snail tissue they develop into adults. Adults reproduce asexually and produce larvae (cercariae). Larvae leave the snail. When they contact a human host, they enter into the body, completing the cycle.\n\nFluke\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nThe adult fluke is generally hermaphroditic. Male and female remain permanentaly paired for life. Male produce sperm. Fertilization occurs in the veins of human intestines.\n\n52\n\nAbout 1000 species are exclusively endoparasites of vertebrates or humans. Their body is flat, slender and ribbon-like. These are all hermaphroditic animals . The tapeworm has an anterior ragion containing hooks and suckers for attachment to the intestinal wall of the host. Behaind the head region, called a scolex, there is a short neck and tten a long series of proglottids. Proglottids are body part which has full set of both male and female reproductive organs.They have excretory canals but no digestive system and only rudiments of nerves.. Examples are pork tapeworm,, beef tapeworm, dog tapeworm and fish tapeworm.\n\nCLASS OF PHYLUM PLATYHELMINTHES Class\n\nTurbellaria\n\nRepresentav e\n\nCharacteristic\n\nPlanarians\n\nFree-living flatworms; mainly marine; carnivorous prey on tiny invertebrates.\n\nFlukes\n\nAll parasites in vertebrate or invertebrate hosts. Have suckers for attachment to host.\n\nTapeworms\n\nParasites of vertebrate; scolex with hooks and suckers. Egg produced within proglottids, no digestive system.\n\nLife Cycle of Tapeworm The adult tapeworm lives in the human intestine its body consist of scolex (head) and proglottids (Body part which has male and female reproductive organs.) Proglottids produce sperm and eggs. The eggs are fertilized and stored in the proglottid. A single proglottid may contain nearly 80.000 - 100.000 fertilized eggs. The fertilized egg stored proglottid called ripe proglottid may break away from the tapeworm and pass out of the host body in feces. The fertilized egg may be deposited on the ground and on grass. So if pigs eat this grass, fertilized eggs can pass into new host body. In the pigs' intestine, eggs develop into structures. They cross the intestine enter the blood and lodge in the tissues (usually brain and muscle tissue) where they form capsule around themselves. At this stage new organisms called bladder worm (8-12 mm long). Beef containing bladder worms may be eaten by humans. If the pig meat is not fully cooked, bladder worms will not be killed. When bladder worms enter into human intestine they grow into adult tapeworms and complete their life cycle. Tapeworm causes weight loss, weakness and some other symptoms in the host.\n\nTurbellaria\n\nCestoda\n\nTapeworms are able to release up to 1.000.000 eggs into the host’s body every day. Also, they can live up to 25 years with in a host.\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nc. Cestoda (Tapeworms)\n\n53\n\nZOOLOGY\n\n5. Phylum Nemertea (Ribbon worms)\n\nProboscis. A characteristic organ, the proboscis, is used to capture prey.\n\n54\n\nThis small phylum consists of nearly 800-900 species. Except for a few species living in moist soil or freshwater, they are mostly marine. They are usually round, cylindrical, flat or ribbon-like. They range in size from 5 to 200 centimeters. They are free-living animals. Coloration may be bright, even red or green, with black spots or lines. A characteristic organ, the proboscis, is used to capture prey. They are the first in the animal kingdom to have complete digestive system (separate anus and mouth) and the simplest animal with a circulatory system in which blood flows in vessels, but no heart. Blood is pumped by the muscles.\n\n6. Phylum Nematoda (Roundworms) Nematodes have cylindrical, smooth bodies and bilateral symmetry. Their bodies are long, thin and pointed at both tips. Sense organs are not well-developed.\n\nAlthough there are many free-living species, some species are plant or animal parasites. Parasitic roundworms obtain nutrients and oxygen from their host. Examples of parasitic nematodes (in humans) are pinworm, hookworm, ascaid worms, trichinae worms, and whipworm. A complete digestive system is seen in roundworms. They have a pseudocoelom that serves as a hydrostatic skeleton and provides a space for internal organs. Roundworms also have a waterproof, flexible body covering called a cuticle.\n\nCaenorhabitis elegans is the most important roundworm used in biological research.\n\n55\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nThere are about 12,000 species. They usually have separate sexes and internal fertilization is seen. Mostly they inhabit sediment layers in water (both marine and freshwater), and are abundant in soil. Ecologicaly they are very important. Their importance comes from their major role as decomposers. They provide material recycling.\n\nAscaris lumbricoides Ascariasis is an infection caused by a parasitic roundworm, Ascaris lumbricoides. This is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is found in association with poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and in places where human feces are used as fertilizer. Intake of food or drink contaminated with roundworm eggs causes infection. The eggs hatch and release larvae within the intestines. The larvae then move through the bloodstream to the lungs, exit up through the large airways of the lungs, and are swallowed back into the stomach and intestines. During movement through the lungs the larvae may produce an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Once back in the intestines, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the intestines where they lay eggs that are present in feces\n\nFigure: The structure of round worms.\n\nFilariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti) Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by microscopic worms introduced into the body through the bites of mosquitoes. Worms in the body can cause kidney damage, or damage to the lymphatic system (the system that regulates fluids in the body). This damage may cause Elephantiasis, which is abnormal swelling of the tissues.\n\nSOME NEMATODE PARASITES OF HUMANS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nFigure: Elephantiasis.\n\nLymphatic filariasis currently affects 120 million people worldwide, and 40 million of these people have a serious disease.\n\n56\n\nWorm (Common\n\nHost\n\nMode of infection\n\nAscaris lumbricoides (Giant human intestinal round worms)\n\nHumans only\n\nEating eggs in contaminated food\n\nTrichinella spiralis (Trichina worm)\n\nHumans, pigs, dogs, cats, rats\n\nEating encysted larvae in undercooked meat; can be fatal\n\nWuchereria bancrofti (Filarial worm)\n\nHumans\n\nMosquito bite; can cause elephantiasis\n\nREAD ME\n\nTrichinella spiralis\n\nTrichinosis is a disease caused by a roundworm (nematode) called Trichinella spiralis. Trichinae can be readily avoided by proper handling and cooking of certain meats, particularly pork products. If the meat ingested has only a few cysts, then the human host's load of parasites (worm burden) will be small. The initial symptoms will be caused by the presence of the adult worms in the intestine. These symptoms usually include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and perhaps vomiting. The symptoms begin about one to two days after eating the contaminated meat, and may last for a week or so. The adult trichinae reproduce in human intestines and produce larvae. Larvae enter the bloodstream. When the larvae begin their migration through the blood vessels, the host will begin to experience symptoms affecting the whole body (systemic symptoms), such as fever, swelling of the face and the area around the eyes, rash, bleeding into the nail beds, retina, and whites of the eyes, and cough. In very severe cases of trichinosis, inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis), lungs (pneumonitis), or brain (encephalitis) may occur. These symptoms can lead to the few deaths caused by trichinosis. The larvae begin to burrow into the host's muscles and form cysts within two to three weeks of the initial infection. This encysting produces signs of muscle inflammation (myositis) including swelling of the affected muscle groups, pain, and weakness. The most frequently affected muscles are the muscles outside the eye that control eye movements, the muscles of the jaw, neck, and upper arm (biceps muscle), the muscles of the lower back (lumbar region), and the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the abdominal and chest cavities and aids in breathing. The symptoms of trichinosis are at their most severe at about three weeks after infection, and decrease very slowly in their severity. Recovery is extremely gradual, and symptoms may last for as long as three months. Fatigue and muscle pain (myalgia) may take several more months to subside.\n\nIt is a disease caused by a roundworm (nematode) called Trichinella spiralis. Trichinae can be readily avoided by proper handling and cooking of certain meats, particularly pork products.\n\n57\n\nAnimal Systematic\n\nTrichinosis\n\n7. Phylum Rotifera (Wheel animals)\n\nFigure: Rotifer\n\nZOOLOGY\n\nRotifer Rotifers have constant number of cell. That means a species is composed of exactly the same number of cells. Cell diffusion does not take place after embryonic development so there is no mitosis, no growth and no repair.\n\n58\n\nRotifers are microscopic, multicellular organisms that live in water. They are named for a crown of cilia (corona) that resembles a rotating wheel. These cilia have a role in the feeding and locomotion of the organism. Rotifers have a developed digestive cavity but they are pseudocoelemates. Nervous system consists of a simple brain and some sensory organs (eye spot). There are protonephridia for the excretion of excess water and wastes. Most live in freshwater. Sexes are separate. In many species parthenogenesis is the rule, males do not occur. There are around 1500-2000 species.\n\n8. Phylum Mollusca (Mollusks) Mollusks are soft bodied, bilaterally symmetrical animals. About 50,000 living and 35,000 fossil species of mollusks are known. Examples of the group include mussels, octopuses, snails, slugs, oysters and squid. Many species are marine but there are some freshwater mussels and snails, and many terrestrial slugs and snails.\n\nMollusks have a complete digestive system. Food is ground in the mouth by specialized structures known as radula. It is similar to a tongue with hard teeth. After mechanical digestion the food material forms a cord-like structure and is transported down the esophagus into the stomach. The final products of digestion are absorbed by the stomach and intestine.\n\nMolluscs They have eyes similar to vertebrates both structurally and functionally. The eyes of a mollusc are composed of a c"
