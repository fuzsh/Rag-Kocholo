The answer to this riddle is “Grape”.

If you take away the first letter of “Grape” it becomes (G)rape, which is a crime and something we should never do or tolerate.

Next, if you take a way the first two letters of the fruit, it becomes “Ape”. Finally, if you take out the first and last letters “G” and “E”, what remains is “Rap”, a musical genre that combines both rhythm and poetry.
