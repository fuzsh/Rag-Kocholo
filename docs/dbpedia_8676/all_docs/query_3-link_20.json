        "text": "Happy Grammy Sunday to those of you who celebrate. The Barbie soundtrack, Chris Stapleton and Jason Isbell are big winners so far, while Taylor Swift is expected to win album of the year for the fourth time – the first singer to do so. Other contenders include SZA, Miley Cyrus and Boygenius; I pick my favorites at the bottom.\n\nAfter a tough couple years for music deals, activity is picking back up. Primary Wave just acquired a 50% stake in one of Brazil’s leading music companies, while former Apple executive Larry Jackson raised another nine figures for his company Gamma. The streaming service SoundCloud is also looking to sell for north of $1 billion, more than double where it was a few years ago."
