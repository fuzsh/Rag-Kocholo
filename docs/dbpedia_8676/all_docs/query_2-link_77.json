        "text": "Spotify needs a WiFi or mobile data connection to work.\n\nMobile data\n\nIt’s best to use WiFi instead of mobile data.\n\nIf you don’t have WiFi, the app uses your mobile data.\n\nReduce data usage\n\nData Saver reduces the app’s data usage by showing fewer images and reducing audio quality.\n\nSwipe left or tap your profile picture\n\nTap Settings and privacy\n\nSwitch Data Saver on.\n\nTip: Under Data Saver, you can also switch Audio-only podcasts on. This means when you download podcasts it doesn’t download their videos too.\n\nMore ways to reduce mobile data usage:\n\nIf you have Premium, download music to listen offline.\n\nTip: Make sure the app only downloads when connected to WiFi, switch Download using cellular off in the app’s settings (under Music Quality).\n\nCheck your Music Quality. Higher quality music uses more data.\n\nSwitch Autoplay off in your app’s settings. This stops it playing after what you’ve selected.\n\nUse WiFi when using the app abroad. Check your mobile data plan to learn about roaming charges.\n\nYour device may have its own data saver. Check the support site for your device.\n\nVideo data\n\nVideos use more data than music due to larger file sizes, but our data usage is comparable to other popular video channels.\n\nVideos on podcasts\n\nSome podcasts feature videos. You can’t turn these videos off, but they only play when you have them on-screen. If you navigate away from the podcast or lock your device, only the audio plays.\n\nNote: When downloading a podcast, only the audio is downloaded, not the video.\n\nNow playing moving visuals\n\nThe moving visuals in Now Playing is a feature called Canvas - a unique form of artistic expression on Spotify.\n\nThese are short and looping, so use very little data. After they’ve looped once, they don’t need any more data to keep playing. They also don’t continue to run in the background.\n\nIf don’t want Canvas, you can switch it off:\n\nTap Home .\n\nTap Settings .\n\nSwitch Canvas (under Playback) off.\n\nBandwidth\n\nThe app uses some of your device’s internet bandwidth to play music without buffering.\n\nTo reduce bandwidth usage:"
