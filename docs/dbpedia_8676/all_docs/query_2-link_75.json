        "text": "What can it be used for?\n\nMany teachers have been using Chrome Music Lab as a tool in their classrooms to explore music and its connections to science, math, art, and more. They’ve been combining it with dance and live instruments.\n\nCan I use it to make my own songs?\n\nYes. Check out the Song Maker experiment, which lets you make and share your own songs.\n\nHow were these built?\n\nAll our experiments are all built with freely accessible web technology such as Web Audio API, WebMIDI, Tone.js, and more. These tools make it easier for coders to build new interactive music experiences. You can get the open-source code to lots of these experiments here on Github.\n\nWhat devices do these work on?\n\nYou can play with these experiments across devices – phones, tablets, laptops – just by opening the site on a web browser such as Chrome.\n\nWhat's next for Chrome Music Lab?\n\nWe always get inspired by new, unexpected ways that people use these experiments. If you’d like to share something with us, post it with #chromemusiclab or drop us a line."
