        "text": "I have a IPhone X. Yesterday, all of a sudden, the widget for Apple Music began appearing on the lock screen. It takes up most of the lock screen so new notifications are pushed down and barely visible without scrolling. I cannot figure out how to remove the widget from the lock screen. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n[Re-Titled by Host]\n\nSOLVED - Yes, you are right. As soon as I \"upgraded\" to 11.2.6 the music widget was back. But I think though I have the answer now.\n\nGo to settings>Face ID & Passcode - Go to \"Allow Access when when locked\" which is near the bottom and turn off 3 things - Today view, Control Centre and Reply with Message. It shows up if music is playing but disappears if the music is paused but only when it is paused when the phone is unlocked.\n\nIf this fails turn off Home Control as well.\n\nThis video is the perfect answer to my problem, I recommend everyone watch it. I have my Music lock screen image removed now, and so I can see my beautiful puppy, instead. It is too bad Apple doesn't provide this information for us, and we had to go to YouTube for it. I wasted twenty minutes of my time going through their discussions site looking for a solution before findings this excellent response.\n\nThank you, Uddhabay!\n\nernie289 wrote:\n\nWhy are there no answers to this question??? If more than one person is complaining about this problem, why doesn't Apple come up with a solution?\n\nThis is a user-to-user forum. Apple's participation here is mostly limited to ensuring that people conform to the terms of use. If you want to let Apple know how you feel, use the feedback page:\n\nProduct Feedback - Apple\n\nIf you want to discuss the matter with Apple directly, use the Contact Support link at the top right of every page of the forums.\n\nI did all of those as much as I could actually do it on iOS 9, which I am stuck on. I want the Music widget to actually show when I am playing music but not to show when I am not playing music. I never saw the today view\n\nin the touch ID section I think that's what was doing it, i'm not sure which one was actually doing it, it has been driving me crazy.\n\nI think that this is an Apple glitch.\n\nI didn't want other alerts or control center turned off.\n\nTry this:\n\nAt lock screen, turn volume all the way up.\n\nThen hold power button + turn volume all the way down.\n\nSlide power off to restart.\n\nThat's the theory but it does not go away when you stop playing music. That's why everyone is complaining.\n\nIt stays there until you restart the phone. I have an iPhone X and this problem emerged after about 2 updates ago. Apple now uses us as its beta testers. As a result these boards are full of complaints about weird and stupid bugs like this one.\n\nI have used all the techniques in the YouTube video. I donâ€™t even have Touch ID or a passcode enabled. When I turn on my car, it connects via Bluetooth, and when I disconnect the widget stays on my lock screen (forever and ever). The only fix is to restart my phone, which is highly annoying and totally unreasonable in my opinion. I hope Apple finds a true fix for this one.\n\nFinally found perm fix. Settings > General > scroll to the bottom and choose 'Reset' > choose the very top one 'Reset all Settings'. Make sure you DON'T choose 'Erase all content and settings.\n\nAfterwards you will have to reset your wallpaper on your phone but otherwise should work fine. I have been in my car where my Bluetooth connects, etc. and the widget has not reappeared on my screen.\n\nGood luck!\n\nI regress; unfortunately the widget came back. I have tried every fix in this forum as well as others and videos. Still searching, because this is very frustrating. I have Bluetooth at home, in my car, in my office so it constantly comes back on and this is NOT when I have even been using my music."
