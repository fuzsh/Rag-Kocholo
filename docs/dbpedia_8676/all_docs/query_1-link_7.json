        "text": "After a lot of teasing build-up on Instagram, The Chainsmokers have dropped their Illenium collaboration “Takeaway” featuring Lennon Stella. It’s the New York duo’s first original collaboration with Denver dance-pop star Illenium. The ballad features vocals from The Chainsmokers’ Drew Taggard and Canadian singer-songwriter Lennon Stella.\n\nIt’s a tale of broken hearts told from the perspective of a damaged and untrustworthy lover. You know when you fall for someone, and they pull back just when you’re about to tell them you’re in deep? They’re “not emotionally ready for a relationship,” even though they made all the moves.\n\nThe video features lots of slow-motion clips of the collaborators exploring the incredible architecture of the newly open Heatherwick’s Vessel at Hudson Yards in New York City.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nWatch the video for “Takeaway” with Illenium and Lennon Stella below."
