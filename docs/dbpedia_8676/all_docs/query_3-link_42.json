        "text": "The industry has seen a huge shift towards streaming over the past decade, so releasing your music online to big platforms like Spotify is a essential way to get it into the ears (and spheres) of the everyday listener.\n\nStreaming is one of the main music revenue streams for artists in 2024. But how many bucks are you making for your streams? Letâs find out.\n\nHow much does Spotify pay per stream?\n\nSpotify pays artists between $0.003 - $0.005 per stream on average.\n\nThat works out as an approx revenue split of 70/30 - so thatâs 70% to the artist/rights holders and 30% to Spotify.\n\nREMEMBER: The rights holders of a song can include; the publisher, songwriter and the master recording owners (i.e. the artist and/or label if theyâre signed to one).\n\nHow Spotify counts streams\n\nTowards the end of 2023, Spotify announced some big changes to the way that it registers its stream counts - impacting how artists get paid.Â\n\nAs of 2024, tracks on Spotify must have reached at least 1,000 streams in the previous 12 months to generate royalties on the platform, with song streams updated whenever a user listens for 30 seconds or longer.Â\n\nDespite this 30-second threshold, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has denied the claim that users could make $1,200 a month by uploading 30-second songs to the streaming service and âriggingâ the system.\n\nEk added:\n\nFrom 2024 onwards, artists will also need to hit a minimum number of unique listeners to make their track eligible for royalty payments. This new rule has been introduced to try and prevent bots and other artificial streaming practices from taking place.\n\nFor more info on Spotifyâs new streaming policies, check out their official statement.\n\nâ\n\nSpotify Royalty Calculator\n\nSo how can you work out how much you could earn from Spotify streams?\n\nWell, exact amounts artists can generate via streams of their music is closely guarded, off the records info.\n\nBut if you want to get a general idea how much you could potentially earn off the back of Spotify streams, let our Spotify Royalty Calculator do the math for you!\n\nâ\n\nIMPORTANT: THE ROYALTIES PREDICTED BY THIS CALCULATOR WILL NOT BE 100% ACCURATE. IT IS A ESTIMATE - BASED ON FIGURES FROM THE USA. MANY FACTORS AFFECT STREAMING ROYALTIES AND THIS CALCULATOR SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS A GUIDE.\n\nâ\n\nAs we mentioned before - it's impossible to work out exactly how much you should or could be earning per stream based on Spotify's own confidentiality and the vast number of factors influencing your stream rate.\n\nSo don't get too caught up on the exact calculations, and instead, focus on how you can boost the amount of money you do make from online streams once you upload your music to Spotify.\n\nâ\n\nHow do Spotify streaming payouts work?\n\nSpotify, like many other on-demand streaming services, follows whatâs known as a âpro-rataâ or âplatform-centricâ distribution model.\n\nThis means the revenue generated and paid out to individual artists releasing on the platform is divvied up based on the following 4 factors:\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSo in the streaming world, thereâs no such thing as an all-in-one revenue pool.\n\nInstead, thereâs loads of separate buckets - for every kind of subscription, every local market, country and so on. And different types of streams can only mean one simple thing - not all streams are created equal.\n\nFor every artist releasing music, the pay per stream rate will be in constant flux â simply because there are hundreds of factors affecting the overall revenue.\n\nLetâs dive a bit deeper and take a look at the 3 main ones for Spotify.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is a Spotify âpay per streamâ?\n\nBasically what it says on the tin.\n\nA âpay per streamâ is the amount of money or rate of pay, generated every time someone streams a song on any kind of digital streaming platform.\n\nâ\n\nMusic streaming generates 2 kinds of royalties;\n\n1. Mechanical royalties\n\n2. Performance royalties\n\nSo for artists releasing their music on these platforms, the pay per stream is essentially the amount of money the artist makes for a single stream of one of their tracks or songs.\n\nAnd with the no.of streaming service subscriptions up by almost 25% in the US between 2019 - 2020, itâs now more important than ever for artists to release their music to every major platform, including Spotify, Deezer, Amazon and Apple Music. Check out how much Apple Music pays artists per stream.\n\nâ\n\nWhat can affect Spotify royalty rates?\n\nHow much you get paid per stream on Spotify varies from artist to artist. Hereâs why.\n\nSpotify stream rates are influenced by 3 main factors:\n\n1. Who you distribute with\n\nSpotify doesnât pay artists royalties based on any kind of rights agreement between Spotify and the artist.\n\nInstead, the music royalties you'll receive as an artist on the platform are based on your agreement with your music distributor or label.\n\nWhich means the amount of money youâll get paid per stream on Spotify is influenced directly by the music distributor youâre working with (and how big a piece of the pie that distributor takes!).\n\nAt Ditto Music, we want you to see as much buck for your stream as possible. Which is why we work on a 0% commission rate basis, meaning youâll keep 100% of all the royalties for every stream of your music.\n\n2. Your listenersâ country of origin\n\nBelieve it or not, where your listeners are tuning in from matters.\n\nNot every country pays the same amount of money for streaming on Spotify.\n\nSo for example, listeners in the US will pay $0.0039 per stream, while listeners in Portugal will only pay $0.0018.\n\nSo if you already know youâve got a global base of listeners from across the world, chances are this will heavily influence your pay per stream rate.\n\nWith certain countries paying out less money per stream, it's even more important to make sure you're applying to any available music grants in your region. Keep up to date with opportunities at our Music Funding Map.\n\n3. Your listenersâ Spotify account plan\n\nSpotify operates 2 types of subscription plans for users streaming music on the platform; a Free account and a Premium account (which requires a paid subscription).\n\nAs paying listeners, Spotify Premium listeners bring in more money to the platform while they listen, compared to Free listeners.\n\nWhich also means, Spotify offers better royalties when Premium users stream your music.\n\nâ\n\nHow to earn more money through Spotify streams\n\nGetting your music streamed on Spotify is just one form of streaming income.\n\nWhile Spotify might be the most popular music streaming service among listeners, millions of people use other streaming services too. Which means youâll maximise the money you can make from streaming by releasing music to as many platforms and online stores as possible.\n\nBeing present on more than one music streaming platform is always a sure way to build your following and reach new listeners too!\n\nPlaylists are also the main way listeners consume music on streaming services - whether thatâs using editorial playlists curated by the app itself, or user-generated playlists too.\n\nWhich means getting your music playlisted is another way to make more money from Spotify streams, by putting your tracks in prime place to get picked up by the algorithm and more listeners.\n\nAnd ultimately, the more streams and fans you can generate on Spotify, the more revenue youâll return in the form of music royalties.\n\nCheck out the vid below to hear 11 different ways you can get more streams on Spotify as an unsigned artist.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nOn top of making money from music side hustles and streaming royalties, selling your music online presents other opportunities too - like building a global listener-base, getting playlisted, or even getting discovered for a sync opportunity - making it a huge pool of uncapped potential for new, aspiring artists!\n\nâ"
