        "text": "Your Taste Profile is Spotify's interpretation of your taste based on what you listen to and how you listen to it. It helps us to personalize your Spotify recommendations, like Discover Weekly and your Home page. It also helps us to personalize experiences with taste summaries, like Wrapped and Blend.\n\nExclude a playlist from your Taste Profile\n\nIf you exclude a playlist from your Taste Profile, past and future listens from that playlist will have less impact on your taste summaries and recommendations. For example, if you exclude your nightly sleep music playlist, your listening from that playlist will have less influence on your Discover Weekly and Wrapped.\n\nTap (iPhone and Desktop) / (Android) near the top of the playlist.\n\nTap Exclude from your taste profile.\n\nTap Include in your taste profile to add it back to your Taste Profile.\n\nNote: If you listen to songs that are on an excluded playlist but do so from outside the playlist, such as in Liked Songs, those streams will still be included in your Taste Profile.\n\nHow long does it take for excluding a playlist to take effect?\n\nExclusion of a playlist from your Taste Profile will take effect within 48 hours. Some recommended content such as Discover Weekly may not be affected until the following week.\n\nWhat items can I exclude from the Taste Profile?\n\nYou can only exclude playlists from your Taste Profile.\n\nWhat exactly happens when I exclude a playlist from my Taste Profile?\n\nIf you exclude a playlist from your Taste Profile, past and future streams from that playlist will have less impact on your music recommendations and taste summaries.\n\nHow does this differ from the “Hide song\" button?\n\nHide a song prevents that song from playing whenever you listen to that playlist. This feature will not affect the music that plays when you listen to that playlist.\n\nWhat effect will this have on my Wrapped?\n\nStreams while listening to playlists you excluded will not be included in the top artist or track counts for Wrapped, but the time towards total listening will be included.\n\nCan I request what I’ve excluded via Data rights and privacy settings - Spotify?\n\nYes, you can request to review the playlists you have excluded."
