        "text": "I would really like to turn off the karaoke “sing” feature. Anyone have advice?\n\nAt first it seemed really groundbreaking, now all my favorite classic songs sound different.\n\nI can tell that you (Apple) just acquired instrumentals of all of the songs and are just crossfading a vocal track with YOUR OWN REVERB AND DELAY.\n\nEvery Pink Floyd song sounds super dry, every Steely Dan song sounds stale, you’re RUINING CLASSIC SONGS.\n\nplease please please give an option in the settings to permanently disable unless this was a choice to alter your entire licensed music catalog. If so I’m switching to Spotify in a heartbeat.\n\nYes most of my songs sound like they are fading then coming back with the sing on or off lyrics open or closed and its especially heavy on slow songs it sounds horrible i hate that I updated my phone smh i thought it was my headphones for about an hour\n\nAgreed, this feature sounds great in theory, but all my songs sound wonky now. They keep fading in and out. I want the ability to turn this off in settings -- this is so horrible it makes me want to cancel my Music subscription and use an alternate service.\n\nIf you are listening to a song and the lyrics are opened on your device you can simply close them. You would need to tap on the song that is playing at the bottom of your iPhone/iPad you can then see a speech bubble with quotation marks in it. If you press the speech bubble, the lyrics will either appear or disappear depending on whether they were on or off prior."
