        "text": "Researchers credit music therapy with helping soothe many ailments, but can audio therapy for migraine and headaches bring you relief? A growing body of scientific and anecdotal evidence says it’s worth trying.\n\nSince migraine is the third-most prevalent and sixth-most disabling disease in the world, it’s no wonder we will try nearly anything to lessen the frequency and severity of attacks. Many people use multifaceted plans to keep a migraine attack at bay, from prescription medications to dietary management, regular exercise, and even music and audio therapy.\n\nWhile it won’t work for everyone, anti-migraine music may be the missing piece that helps you control your attacks. One recent small study hinted at the positive impact of music on a number of measures of migraine burden.\n\nDifferent People Respond Differently to Music Therapy\n\nThe consensus among people with migraine seems to be that the effectiveness of music in alleviating an attack is dependent on both the individual and the type of attack. If you’re suffering from a severe migraine attack, you may be extremely sensitive to all external sounds, even those that you would otherwise find calming.\n\nIf you’re experiencing a milder or moderate migraine attack, you might find that tranquil songs help you relax and relieve some of the pain. The type of music that takes away headaches is going to be different for each person.\n\nThe Problem With Headphones and Migraine\n\nWhen you have a migraine attack in progress, the last thing your head usually needs is something pressing against it. Because of this, the majority of people forgo listening with headphones when using music therapy.\n\nSome find that earphones or earbuds are okay to use, but most seem to prefer listening via speakers, as they don’t come into direct contact with your head at all.\n\nThe Best Music and Audio Therapy for Migraine\n\n1. Relaxing Migraine Music\n\nThe type of music you find relaxing will be specific to you, your preferences, and your migraine attacks. Many people seem to find slow, melodic music the most helpful, so listening to ballads and other slow-paced songs may work. Think of Enya. The best kind of music to get rid of your headaches is the music that makes you feel calm.\n\nListen to a sample of Enya.\n\n2. Binaural Beat Technology for Migraine\n\nSome people choose binaural beat technology (BBT) as their favorite music to manage migraine attacks. Binaural beats were discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove, a prominent physicist, and have been used in many therapeutic environments. Binaural beats are illusions created when we listen to two tones that have similar yet distinctive frequencies. Each tone is played into a different ear, and when your brain interprets the two frequencies, it makes a third tone, called a binaural beat. BBT can be used to promote states of extreme relaxation — a welcome thought when managing chronic pain.\n\nListen to a sample of BBT music.\n\n3. Dubstep and Heavy Metal for Migraine\n\nOpposite to tranquil, relaxing songs are dubstep, electronic dance music (EDM), and heavy metal songs. Some might find the idea that loud music can help migraine pretty shocking since harsh sounds are actually painful to many. But such is the crazy, highly personalized nature of migraine. The music that takes away migraine for someone else may sound like nails on a chalkboard to you.\n\nThough not the majority by any means, some people report that music with heavy bass sounds actually helps their migraine through the vibrations they create. Think of Skrillex and AC/DC.\n\nListen to a sample of Skrillex.\n\n4. ASMR for Migraine\n\nAutonomous sensory meridian response, commonly known as ASMR, is characterized by a listener’s ecstatic reaction to gentle acoustic sounds. According to a BBC report, ASMR videos have become an internet phenomenon by making people “tingle.”\n\nASMR videos can include someone speaking softly, hair being brushed, soft tapping, light scratching, or quiet crinkling. While you may not be susceptible to these sounds or experience the associated tingly response, ASMR can also be used in place of music to help you stay relaxed and calm. There are many different videos where you can listen to these calming sounds. If the sound of crinkling is more likely to drive you up the wall than relieve stress, you can listen to other calming sounds, such as crackling fires, raindrops hitting the ground, or crashing waves.\n\nWatch a sample ASMR migraine video.\n\n5. White Noise for Migraine\n\nLong before ASMR entered the scene, white noise apps featuring endless loop tracks of sounds like an Amazon jungle, crashing waves, or a ceiling fan helped people calm their brains without medication and get to sleep. Sleep is certainly a challenge for most people with migraine. Again, the use of white noise for migraine is personal. Some sources even report that background white noise (often used in offices) can actually raise your stress level and impede concentration.\n\nNot all white noise is created equal; try it for yourself by downloading a free app.\n\nPink noise is an alternative to white noise that may help improve sleep and memory. Listen to a high-quality sample of pink noise.\n\nListen to a sample of Rain in the Woods.\n\nAudio Therapy Is Worth Trying\n\nWhile there is no concrete evidence that audio therapy for migraine can alleviate an attack, music and sound may be positive elements to help you relax when experiencing a migraine attack or headache. As the band Twenty One Pilots says in its song “Migraine,” the “pain will range from up, down, and sideways,” so if anti-migraine music might help even a little, it’s worth trying it out."
