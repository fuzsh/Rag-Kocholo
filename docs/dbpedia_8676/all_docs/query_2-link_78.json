        "text": "Our retailers can offer our interest-free loans for musical instruments, equipment, software and tuition. They can offer these in-store and online.\n\nWe don’t set limits on the instruments we fund. Instruments can be new or reconditioned. Indeed, in both England and Northern Ireland, we encourage musical passions of every complexion, from bass guitars to xylophones.\n\nIn England, you can get a Take it away interest free loan of between £100 and £5,000.\n\nThe core scheme, which all our shops in England offer, is available to UK residents, who have a regular income that exceeds £5,000 per year.\n\nIn England, if the cost of the instrument/s you want to buy exceed the £5,000 loan limit, you can use Take it away as a part-payment towards the instrument/s. You would then need to pay the remaining balance by an alternative method. It is not possible to split the cost of an instrument/s over more than one loan application.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, you can get a Take it away interest free loan of up to £2,000. The scheme is open to all, regardless of age, as long as you are a resident of Northern Ireland.\n\nSome participating stores also offer interest free credit up to the value of £25,000 to eligible customers over the age of 18. Speak to your local shop for further details"
