        "text": "Omah Lay is one of the most talented and popular Nigerian R&B artists in the music industry.\n\nHe rose to fame with his debut EP Get Layd in 2020, which featured hit songs like Bad Influence, Lo Lo, and You.\n\nSince then, he has released another EP, What Have We Done, and his second studio album, Boy Alone, in 2022.\n\nOne of the standout tracks from Boy Alone is Soso, a mellow and emotional song that showcases Omah Lay’s smooth vocals, catchy melodies, and heartfelt lyrics.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the meaning and message behind the lyrics of Soso by Omah Lay.\n\nWhat is Soso about?\n\nSoso is a song that expresses Omah Lay’s pain and frustration over a failed relationship.\n\nHe sings about how he feels numb and empty after losing his lover, and how he tries to cope with his emotions by drinking, smoking, and partying.\n\nHe also reveals that he has broken some commandments and can’t stay in one place, implying that he has been unfaithful or restless, begging his lover to come back and take his pain away, calling her “soso”, which means “only” or “just” in Nigerian Pidgin English.\n\nOmah said in an interview, “Soso is a song that I wrote when I was going through a lot of things. I was feeling depressed and isolated. I felt like nobody understood me or cared about me. I needed someone to comfort me and make me feel better. That’s why I called her Soso because only God knows what I was going through.”\n\nThe song was produced by Tempoe, a Nigerian record producer who has worked with artists like Wizkid, Burna Boy, and Davido.\n\nTempoe also co-wrote the song with Omah Lay and Stephanie Okocha, a singer-songwriter who is Omah Lay’s cousin.\n\nThe Genre and Style of Soso\n\nSoso is a fusion of R&B, Afrobeat, and pop music. It showcases Omah Lay’s smooth vocals, catchy melodies, and emotional lyrics.\n\nThe song has a mellow vibe that contrasts with the intense themes of pain, betrayal, and loneliness that Omah Lay expresses.\n\nThe song has been praised for its originality and authenticity by music critics and fans alike. It has also been compared to some of the works of legendary artists like Fela Kuti, and Bob Marley.\n\nOmah Lay – soso (Official Music Video)\n\nSoso Lyrics analysis\n\nChorus\n\nThe chorus of Soso is repeated four times throughout the song.\n\nSoso take my pain away\n\nSoso take my pain\n\nThe chorus is simple but powerful. Soso lyrics expresses Omah Lay’s plea to his lover to take away his pain and suffering.\n\nHe calls her Soso, which means “only God knows” in Nigerian. This implies that she is the only one who knows and understands what he is going through. She is also the only one who can heal him and make him feel better.\n\nThe repetition of the chorus creates a sense of urgency and desperation in Omah Lay’s voice.\n\nHe sounds like he is in desperate need of relief and comfort from his lover. He also sounds like he is dependent on her for his happiness and well-being.\n\nVerse 1\n\nAh-ah, ah-ah\n\nAll of the things them talk, I no dey hear, hear\n\nTry wetin I do if you no dey fear, fear\n\nOne mind dey tell me to disappear, ‘pear\n\nSoso come and help me oh ’cause I don pray, mami\n\nI don break, commandment\n\nI can’t stay for one place\n\nFor God’s sake\n\nThe opening lines of the song “Soso” by Omah Lay set the stage for his personal struggles and challenges.\n\nIn these lyrics, he reveals his indifference to public opinion and criticism of his music, boldly inviting critics to walk a mile in his shoes if they dare.\n\nAdditionally, he expresses a desire to escape from the overwhelming pressures and stress of his life, hinting at his feelings of wanting to vanish from it all.\n\nFollowing the introduction, Omah Lay’s lyrics take a turn as he reaches out to Soso for assistance, highlighting his desperation.\n\nHe mentions that despite his prayers, his situation remains unchanged, suggesting a sense of helplessness and disillusionment with divine intervention.\n\nHe confesses to breaking a commandment, indicating that he feels guilty about a sin or transgression.\n\nFurthermore, he reveals his inability to remain stable, pointing to a restless or unsettled state of mind. This plea for help paints a vivid picture of his emotional turmoil.\n\nThe first verse of the song poignantly captures Omah Lay’s discontent and unhappiness with his life.\n\nHe portrays himself as being misunderstood and unfairly judged by others, which adds to his distress.\n\nHe also communicates a profound sense of hopelessness and helplessness, feeling trapped in his circumstances.\n\nIn his plea for rescue, he explicitly calls on Soso to deliver him from his suffering, illustrating his desperate need for salvation and support.\n\nVerse 2\n\nShibiri, shibiri, shibiri\n\nThey are talking shit shibiri\n\nWater no get enemy\n\nTil you fall for Oshimiri\n\nI poto, poto my eyes\n\nTen shots, high rise\n\nTouch God, I cry\n\nOffshore, cut my dreadlocks\n\nThe second verse deepens our understanding of Omah Lay’s struggles as he continues to narrate his challenges. He begins by dismissing the criticisms he faces as “shibiri,” a Nigerian term for “nonsense” or “rubbish.”\n\nHe feels that people only start having issues with him when he gains success, akin to the proverb he uses: “Water no get enemy ‘Til you fall for Oshimiri,” which suggests that problems arise only after one achieves notable success.\n\nOmah Lay also mentions having “poto poto” in his eyes, implying that his experiences have tainted his perspective or morally corrupted him.\n\nHe talks about reaching a high after taking ten shots, possibly using alcohol as a means to escape his troubles.\n\nFurthermore, he describes a poignant moment where he feels he has touched God and cried, indicating a deep spiritual or emotional crisis.\n\nHis narrative of cutting his dreadlocks after going offshore could symbolise a drastic attempt to change his identity or break away from his cultural roots in search of peace or a new beginning.\n\nThrough various methods—confronting detractors, seeking solace in substances, pursuing spiritual enlightenment, and even altering his appearance—Omah Lay tries to cope with his difficulties.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, he remains overwhelmed and unhappy, portraying a poignant picture of a man struggling to find his path amidst turmoil.\n\nBridge\n\nThe bridge of Soso has four lines:\n\nGirlie, me I don pray, maami\n\nI don break, commandment\n\nI can’t stay for one place\n\nFor God’s sake, my bae\n\nIn the bridge of the song, Omah Lay takes a more personal turn by directly addressing his lover using affectionate nicknames like “girlie” and “bae.”\n\nThis shift introduces a deeper level of intimacy to his pleas for help. He reiterates his earlier sentiments about praying, committing transgressions, and feeling restless, underscoring the ongoing nature of his struggles.\n\nA notable addition in this part of the song is the line “Come and ginger me,” where he asks his lover to invigorate him or add some excitement to his life.\n\nThis request highlights his dependence on her for emotional support and motivation.\n\nThe bridge effectively portrays Omah Lay’s reliance on his romantic partner as a potential source of joy and renewal.\n\nHe seeks her presence as a beacon of hope and energy, hoping that she can uplift his spirits and bring some positivity into his troubled existence.\n\nThis section of the song underscores his emotional vulnerability and the comfort he seeks through his relationship.\n\nOutro\n\nThe outro of Soso has four lines:\n\nOnly you dey feel my pains\n\nGive me vitamins wey go take these pains away\n\nSoso, oh, Soso, Soso, oh\n\nSoso take my pain away\n\nThe outro of the song mirrors the chorus but includes significant elaborations that emphasise Omah Lay’s emotional state.\n\nHere, he expresses a profound personal connection to his lover, stating that she alone can truly feel his pain and comprehend his struggles. This deepens the intimacy and sense of understanding he believes exist between them.\n\nOmah Lay’s plea for his lover to “give him vitamins” that will alleviate his pain metaphorically highlights his view of her as his source of emotional and psychological healing.\n\nThis line suggests he sees her care and affection as a remedy to his suffering, much like medicine would soothe physical pain.\n\nBy repeating her name and his request for relief from his pain, he underscores his utter reliance on her for his well-being.\n\nThe outro solidifies the theme of dependency that runs throughout the song; Omah Lay portrays his lover as the only one capable of rescuing him from his despair.\n\nOverall, the outro serves as a powerful conclusion that reinforces his feelings of love and gratitude towards his partner, portraying her as an indispensable part of his journey towards happiness and stability.\n\nWhat is the message behind Soso lyrics?\n\nThe lyrics of “Soso” by Omah Lay convey a complex and poignant message about the nature of love as both painful and addictive.\n\nOmah Lay uses his personal narrative to illustrate how love can lead individuals to act in ways that are beyond their understanding and sometimes lead to regret.\n\nThroughout the song, Omah Lay casts himself as a victim of love’s overwhelming power, losing control over his life and decisions due to his emotional vulnerabilities.\n\nHis desperate need for his lover’s attention and affection is a recurring theme, highlighted by his intense pleas for her to return and alleviate his suffering.\n\nHowever, there’s also an acknowledgment of his own flaws and mistakes—actions that might have contributed to driving his lover away.\n\nThis introspection adds a layer of complexity to his situation, as he is aware that his own behaviours could have influenced their separation.\n\nOmah Lay’s hope that his lover will come back to save him from his anguish is tinged with the realisation that his wrongdoings might prevent this reunion.\n\nThe song portrays a deep, almost existential conflict between his desires and the harsh realities of his actions, encapsulating the bitter-sweet dynamics of love and the human condition.\n\nHow does soso fit into Boy Alone?\n\n“Soso” is a standout track on Omah Lay’s album Boy Alone, which delves deeply into his personal experiences and emotional struggles.\n\nThe title of the album itself, Boy Alone, sets a tone of loneliness and isolation, themes that are vividly reflected in the lyrics of “Soso”.\n\nThis song encapsulates Omah Lay’s feelings of abandonment and his intense longing for connection and relief from his emotional pain.\n\nIn “Soso”, Omah Lay’s vulnerability and honesty shine through as he openly discusses his imperfections and errors, portraying himself as an authentic and relatable figure.\n\nThis transparency is key to the song’s impact, making his struggles and emotional turmoil accessible to listeners, and thereby fostering a deeper connection.\n\nOmah Lay’s ability to eloquently capture the essence of complex human emotions in his music is particularly evident in “Soso”.\n\nThe lyrics are not only relatable and catchy but also invite listeners to embark on a journey of self-discovery and healing alongside him.\n\nThrough this song, he offers both a narrative and a soundtrack for personal reflection, ultimately encouraging an exploration of one’s vulnerabilities and the healing process that follows acknowledging them.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nBNXN x Ruger Drop Infectious Afro-fusion Track POE\n\nUsher & Pheelz Drop Ruin, An Afrobeats Influenced Single\n\nTyla Water Lyrics: Unravelling the Depths of Passion and Artistry\n\nDay 5 by Kang: A Spirited Exploration in Afropop\n\nOmah Lay SoSo Lyrics\n\nVerse 1\n\nAh-ah, ah-ah\n\nAll of the things them talk, I no dey hear, hear\n\nTry wetin I do if you no dey fear, fear\n\nOne mind dey tell me to disappear, ‘pear\n\nSoso come and help me oh ’cause\n\nI don pray, Muhammad\n\nI don break, commandment\n\nI can’t stay for one place\n\nFor God’s sake, come and take\n\nCome take my pain away from me, oh\n\nChorus\n\nSoso take my pain away\n\nSoso take my pain away (Soso, please, come take my pain away)\n\nSoso take my pain away (Soso, Soso, Soso, Soso)\n\nSoso take my pain away (Take my pain)\n\nVerse 2\n\nShibiri, shibiri, shibiri\n\nThey are talking shit shibiri\n\nWater no get enemy\n\n‘Til you fall for Oshimiri\n\nI poto, poto my eyes\n\nTen shots, high rise\n\nTouch God, I cry\n\nOffshore, cut my\n\nDreadlocks\n\nGirlie, me I don pray, Muhammad\n\nI don break, commandment\n\nI can’t stay for one place\n\nFor God’s sake, my bae\n\nCome and ginger me\n\nOnly you dey feel my pains\n\nGive me vitamins wey go take these pains away\n\nSoso, oh, Soso, Soso, oh"
