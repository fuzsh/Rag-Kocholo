        "text": "This bust of Agrippina the Elder, discovered at Pergamon [1], was made in the first half of the 1st century AD, perhaps on the orders of her son Emperor Caligula, after her death in exile from Rome in 33 AD. She is portrayed as a beautiful young woman with the kind of careless coiffure favoured by Pergamese sculptors.\n\nVipsania Agrippina, commonly known as Agrippina Major or Agrippina the Elder (14 BC - 33 AD), is thought to have been born in Athens during the visit of her parents Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder to the city.\n\nShe was an important member of Rome's first imperial family. To say that she was well-connected would be a gross understatement: she was closely related to the first four emperors and many of the major players in Roman politics at the end of the first century BC and the beginning of the first century AD, the period when Roman Republic became an empire and the greatest power in the world.\n\nHere are some of Agrippina's relationships.\n\nShe was the:\n\n• granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus;\n\n• second daughter and fourth child of Augustusâ only natural daughter Julia the Elder and his close ally Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa;\n\n• stepdaughter, sister-in-law and daughter-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius;\n\n• wife of the politician and general Germanicus (Germanicus Julius Caesar, 15 BC - 19 AD, grandson of Marc Antony, great nephew of Augustus and adopted son and heir of Tiberius);\n\n• maternal second cousin and sister-in-law of the Emperor Claudius;\n\n• mother of Emperor Caligula (born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus), as well as Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, Julia Agrippina (Agrippina the Younger, mother of Emperor Nero; later married her uncle Emperor Claudius, 49 AD), Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla;\n\n• maternal grandmother of Emperor Nero.\n\nThe relationships of this family web were made even more complicated by marriages of cousins, remarriages and official adoptions.\n\nAgrippina was the first woman of high rank in the Roman Empire to travel with her husband on military campaigns.\n\nShe was actively involved in politics, causing the enmity of Augustus and Tiberius. In 29 AD Tiberius tried her for treason and banished her to the island of Pandataria (today Ventotene) in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where Augustus had banished her mother for adultery in 2 BC. Agrippina died on the island in 33 AD.\n\nAfter the death of Tiberius in 37 AD, Agrippina's son Caligula became emperor. He personally brought his mother's ashes to Rome, had the documents of her treason trial publicly burnt, dedicated the annual Circus Games as a day to honour her and issued coins in her memory (see photos below). The ashes were interred in her tomb in the Mausoleum of Augustus; the tombstone is now in the Capitoline Museums, Rome.\n\nA bronze sestertius issued in Rome 37-41 AD by Caligula in memory of his mother Agrippina the Elder.\n\nLeft: Obverse, showing a draped bust of Agrippina facing right.\n\nInscription: AGRIPPINA M F GERMANICI CAESARIS\n\nImage source: Guglielmo Ferrero, The women of the Caesars, translated by Christian Gauss.\n\nLoring and Mussey, New York, 1911. (There appear to be several editions by different publishers.)\n\nCoin \"from the collection of Professor G. N. Olcott\". George N. Olcott (1869-1912) was a Latin professor\n\nat Columbia University who collected antiquities, particularly coins and inscriptions, for use as\n\nteaching aids. His collection of coins and squeezes is now on display at Columbia University Library.\n\nRight: Reverse, showing Agrippina's carpentum, a two-wheeled carriage with an arched\n\ncovering supported by a caryatid at each of the four corners, and drawn by two mules.\n\nThe carriage was paraded in the procession of the games Caligula instituted in her honour.\n\nInscription: SPQR MEMORIAE AGRIPPINAE\n\nMÃ¼nzkabinett, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden.\n\nThese coins varied in size and weight, but are generally 34 mm in diameter,\n\nand weigh around 24-32 grams. Although rare, several museums own examples,\n\nand a small number have sold at auction in recent years."
