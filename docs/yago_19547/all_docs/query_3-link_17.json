        "text": "Agrippina the Elder\n\nVipsania Agrippina, commonly known as Agrippina Major or Agrippina the Elder (14 BC - 33 AD), is thought to have been born in Athens during the visit of her parents Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder to the city.\n\nShe was an important member of Rome's first imperial family, the founders of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. To say that she was well-connected would be a gross understatement: she was closely related to the first four emperors and many of the major players in Roman politics at the end of the first century BC and the beginning of the first century AD, the period when Roman Republic became an empire and the greatest power in the world.\n\nHere are some of Agrippina's relationships.\n\nShe was the:\n\n• granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus;\n\n• second daughter and fourth child of Augustusâ only natural daughter Julia the Elder and his close ally Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa;\n\n• stepdaughter, sister-in-law and daughter-in-law of Emperor Tiberius;\n\n• wife of the politician and general Germanicus (Germanicus Julius Caesar, 15 BC - 19 AD, grandson of Mark Antony, great nephew of Augustus and adopted son and heir of Tiberius);\n\n• maternal second cousin and sister-in-law of the Emperor Claudius;\n\n• mother of Emperor Caligula (born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus), as well as Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, Julia Agrippina (Agrippina the Younger, mother of Emperor Nero; later married her uncle Emperor Claudius, 49 AD), Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla;\n\n• maternal grandmother of Emperor Nero.\n\nThe relationships of this family web were made even more complicated by marriages of cousins, remarriages and official adoptions.\n\nAgrippina was the first woman of high rank in the Roman Empire to travel with her husband on military campaigns.\n\nShe was actively involved in politics, causing the enmity of Augustus and Tiberius. In 29 AD Tiberius tried her for treason and banished her to the island of Pandataria (today Ventotene) in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where Augustus had banished her mother for adultery in 2 BC. Agrippina died on the island in 33 AD.\n\nAfter the death of Tiberius in 37 AD, Agrippina's son Caligula became emperor. He personally brought his mother's ashes to Rome, had the documents of her treason trial publicly burnt, dedicated the annual Circus Games as a day to honour her and issued coins in her memory (see photos below). The ashes were interred in her tomb in the Mausoleum of Augustus; the tombstone is now in the Capitoline Museums, Rome.\n\nReferences to Agrippina the Elder\n\non My Favourite Planet\n\nMarble head of Agrippina the Elder from Pergamon.\n\nPergamon gallery 2, page 8\n\nMarble head of Agrippina the Elder\n\nfrom Pergamon.\n\nFirst half of the 1st century AD, perhaps\n\non the orders of her son Emperor Caligula,\n\nafter her death in exile from Rome in 33 AD.\n\nFound at the Sanctuary of Demeter,\n\nPergamon, in 1909. Height 40 cm.\n\nIstanbul Archaeological Museum.\n\nInv. No. 2164 T. Cat. Mendel 557.\n\nMarble head of Agrippina the Elder from\n\nOrtahisa-Trapezus (Trabzon, Turkey).\n\nFirst half of the 1st century AD.\n\nIstanbul Archaeological Museum.\n\nInv. No. 4503 T.\n\nThe marble statue, which once stood in the Farnese Gardens on the Palatine Hill, Rome, was long believed to be a portrait of the mature Agrippina the Elder. This identification appears to have been based mainly on the arrangement of the hair, a style fashionable during the Julio-Claudian and Flavian periods.\n\nThe head was sculpted separately from the body, which is a Roman copy of a statue of seated Aphrodite with Eros, thought to have been made in Athens in the late 5th century BC by a sculptor in the circle of Pheidias. The original probably stood on the north slope of the Athenian Acropolis.\n\nThis is the only statue of the type in which the hands are clasped on the lap rather than with the left arm resting on the back of the throne. According to some scholars, the statue may have been commissioned as a funeral monument, perhaps for a freed slave."
