        "text": "Writing historical biographies are, in my opinion, more difficult when they are about people of ancient times. Take my text about Hypatia as an example – I had some problems finding good information about her. There was not that much about this week’s herstory, Agrippina, either, even though she did once upon a time write a biography about herself, but that one unfortunately has been lost by time. Anyhow, enjoy this week’s text!\n\nJulia Agrippina was born in present-day Köln, or Cologne, Germany, in year 15 on November 6th. This was to the prodigious Germanicus Caesar, adoptive son to Emperor Augustus’s adoptive son Tiberius, whom in reality was Germanicus’s uncle. Agrippina’s mother was Vipsania Agrippina, known to us as Agrippina the Elder, and she was the great-grandchild of Emperor Augustus on her maternal side. Germanicus was a general of prominence, conquering many areas of the enigmatic and elusive Germanic tribes. Agrippina the Elder was also a remarkable woman who followed her husband on his military conquests. Women and children usually remained in Rome during their husband’s military campaigns. The victorious Germanicus, whom received this cognomen for his successes in Germany, and his family returned to Rome in year 17. He was thought to supersede Tiberius, but he was probably poisoned in year 19, just like many others of this time, and he died of an “unknown illness” during one of his campaigns near Antioch. It was speculated that Tiberius had ordered the amiable Germanicus’s assassination. Tiberius didn’t even attend the funeral when Germanicus’s ashes were placed in the tomb of Augustus, customary as he was one of Augustus’s descendants. Agrippina the Elder, too, suspected Tiberius to be the murderer of her love and she was therefore exiled together with her eldest son to some islands in year 29. Her second oldest son was starved to death in the imperial palace, and Agrippina miserably starved herself to death in year 33. Agrippina the Younger’s last surviving brother Caligula was sometimes revered by Emperor Tiberius, sometimes scorned.\n\nA bust of Agrippina the Elder, today located at Istanbul Archeological Museum.\n\nStatue of Germanicus; note the resemblance to the one of many famous statues of Emperor Augustus.\n\nJulia Agrippina was born to one of Rome’s finest families, having connections to The Augustus through both of her parents. This prominence she shared with 5 siblings (9 children were born, but only 6 survived to adulthood), being the first daughter and 4th child. One of her elder brothers were Caligula who would inherit the throne after Tiberius in the place of Germanicus. Her younger sister Drusilla was a proverbial favourite of Caligula. Of course, Agrippina the Younger acquired an elaborate education, as she, after all, was of great importance and a patrician to that.\n\nIn year 28 AD, at the age of thirteen, then legally considered an adult, Agrippina married her very noble first cousin Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The marriage was arranged by her grandfather Emperor Tiberius, who evidently saw a great future for Ahenobarbus, whom would be elected consul in year 32, whereas historian Suetonis described him as “wholly despicable character” who was “remarkably dishonest.” He would also be accused of having incestuous relationships later in her life. It would dwell a few years until Agrippina bore Gnaeus a child, a son on December 15th 37 AD. The boy was named Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, but is known to us today as Nero. Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus died in January year 40. In his bequest he left 1/3 of his wealth to his son Lucius, but it was taken from the boy by Emperor Caligula, who’s name was also mentioned in the testament. Acting decisively and newly widower, Agrippina married again in the following year. This was with Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus, another prominent man and consul twice. He had been asked by the new Emperor Claudius to divorce his wife Domitia, sister to Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, to marry Agrippina instead.\n\nGnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, 32 years older than little Agrippina.\n\nEmperor Tiberius died in year 37 and was superseded by his grandson Caligula. The new emperor cherished his sisters and they were often found seated at the fronts rows together with him in political events (remember; women were legally considered minors at this time). He even had coins printed with their faces on, and added the clause “his sisters” to the vow of allegiance all of Rome had to swear annually. Usually only the Vestal Virgins were the females included in this vow. For whatever reason, thirsting for even more power, Caligula (r. 37-41 AD) caught Agrippina conspiring against him in year 39 together with her sister Livilla and a cousin planning to murder Caligula and make their sister Drusilla’s widower Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (and Agrippina’s potential lover) new emperor (it is dubious whether Caligula was right or not in his suspicions). Agrippina had been reared with the highest hommage, but it wasn’t enough, and she wanted to have the power in her own hands. The cousin was executed, so was Lepidus, whereas Agrippina and her sister were exiled for life, but they returned to Rome after two only years. They had to live one a diminutive island in the Tyrrhenian Sea (between Italy, Corsica, Sicily, and Sardinia), Pandateria of the Pontine Islands, still lavishly, of course, but without rights and property and access to their children. When Caligula was assassinated together with his wife and daughter in year 41 for his folly and savagery the following emperor pardoned Agrippina and her co-conspirors.\n\nIn year 47 Agrippina was accused of having poisoned her second husband Gaius Sallustius, whom she married in year 41 by the urging of the newly appointed emperor Claudius. As Sallustius was wealthy, Agrippina became a very rich widow. In his place Agrippina would marry her uncle, Emperor Claudius, as his fourth wife, but that would take a few years. Incestuous relationships were looked upon with incredulity during the Roman era, but it still happened. It has been been speculated that Agrippina had a sexual relationship with her brother Caligula, whom also acted as her nemesis.\n\nAgrippina.\n\nClaudius had been disdained in his youth, supposedly drewling and being half-crippled, but he was actually quite astute and spent his time excelling academically, writing down several historical chronicles – none of which has survived to our days – since he was excused of enlisting in the army due to his physical less favourable traits. Claudius was the grandson of Emperor Augustus and was merely chosen Emperor after his nephew Emperor Caligula was assassinated. In the tumults of the assassination, Claudius had locked himself in a room and was found by the Praetorian Guard, the Emperor’s lifeguard and also the murderers of Caligula, hiding behind a curtain. In the rush he was elected emperor as he was a descendant of Augustus, and that was not regarded as a trifle. His mother had referred to him as a freak which nature had only commenced but not finished and his sister claimed that Claudius as an Emperor would be the death of Rome. Loving family, those Julio-Claudians. Claudius did, however, conquer Britain, without himself participating in the wars, but it still happened during his reign. At the time of Gaius Sallustius’s death in year 47 Claudius was married to a woman named Messalina – the Empire’s Great Whore, rumours said that she during the nights would go out to brothels and compete with the prostitutes there and always ended up winning; executions went down remarkably after Claudius had rid himself of her – but when Messalina was executed for treachery Agrippina saw her chance. She had restablished her place of high standing and soon after Messalina’s death persuaded Claudius to marry her by offering him a shoulder to cry on. Claudius, notorious for having been easy to lead and women quickly gaining his influence, changed the Roman laws regarding incest and he could therefore legally marry his niece in year 49. They were the last left of Augustus’s bloodline, their families excluded. Strategically Agrippina persuaded Claudius to adopt her son Lucius in year 50 AD, a year after her marriage to the five-year older man. Claudius had given Lucuis his heritage taken from him by Caligula as soon as he ascended the throne.\n\nEmperor Claudius.\n\nAssertive, in contrast to the more privately scheming Livia, Agrippina sat with Claudius in meetings and such. Livia had worked “behind closed doors” to manipulate her husband, but Agrippina did so openly. She was Claudius’s equal in ruling. The Roman elite was of course astonished and bewildered, but Agrippina didn’t care. She even founded a city, around the place where she was born, in Germany in her own name. She named it Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium. Today it’s known as Köln, or Cologne. Agrippina was a tactician and set up a network of allies for herself, amongst others including Claudius’s chief secretary Pallas, his doctor Xenophon, and the head of the Praetorian Guard Africanus Burrus.\n\nWhen Claudius perished in year 54 – he as well perhaps due to Agrippina’s poisoning as he was seen turning blue after a meal and thereafter dying, but Agrippina allegedly hired fools and such for the day of his death to make it appear as if he died the following day instead, otherwise fools and entertainment wouldn’t be there – it was with Nero as his heir, 16 years old. Claudius had started to doubt if it was just to disinherit his own biological children. He said to Britannicus, his eldest surviving son, that one day he “would understand” and he started preparing him for inheriting the throne. Claudius had other children from previous marriages, the eldest son being Britannicus, who was three years younger than Nero. Claudius first son supposedly had a ostensibly fine pear which he admired. When he threw it up in air to catch it with his mouth it got stuck in his throat and he died.\n\nAs Nero was only 16 years old Agrippina was declared his regent, receiving the title Augusta and thus being considered Rome’s first Roman Empress, with the exception of Livia, who had acquired that title still with the Emperor being alive. She was also declared a priestess and was thus allowed to attend the Senate and listen to the senators squabbling from behind a curtain. Agrippina was sage and therefore wanted for her son to obtain an intricate education. Thus, he was educated by the prominent Seneca and Burrus. Agrippina called Seneca back from exile for him to educate Lucius, whereas she almost neglected the education of Claudius’s other children. They would also act as Nero’s advisors in the beginning of his reign.\n\nNero, he even looks like a bully.\n\nIn accordance with her contemporary sources, Agrippina was publicly adroit and skillful. Contrary to the female norms of the time, Agrippina was assertive and her contemporaries were horrified over her being a woman of political prominence. According to the Roman law, a woman was a minor with her father or husband as her guardians. She was willing to sacrifice anything for public advance for herself and her son.\n\nEmperor Nero and his mother Agrippina.\n\nAs later myths about him have told, Nero was unruly and difficult to curb. Still, Agrippina had a great influence over her son during the early years of his reign. On coins both of their heads were printed, of equal size and often with them facing each other. In one sculture from 54-59 Agrippina is even crowning her son, something which truly alludes on Agrippina’s importance. In this sculpture she portrayed as the fertile Rome personified. However, as the years passed and Nero became increasingly in charge over his government Agrippina’s power diminished. He comprehended which immense power he held, and Agrippina the power which she couldn’t possibly hold as a woman. Nero thought she was being too pushy and too overbearing and hence wanted to increase his distance to her. And when Nero’s ties to Agrippina loosened, the Senate and the Plebs could coerce Agrippina into a meek retirement. Her grip first started to weaken when she opposed to Nero’s affair with a former slave, Claudia Acte, since she feared for her own influence being replaced. He supposedly thought of it as outrageous, too, when she once again opposed to Nero’s relationship with Poppaea Sabina, whom Nero actually would end up marrying in year 62. Agrippina, however, had never been meek and therefore allied herself with Senators loyal still to her to avoid her early retirement. She started to threaten Nero to put Claudius’s son Britannicus on the throne instead. Soon, on February 11th 55, Britannicus mysteriously died, most plausibly at the orders of Nero. The same year Nero lapsed Agrippina’s titles and in year 57 she was exiled from the Imperial Palace. As Nero clearly wanted to rid himself of Agrippina completely he invited her to Baiae. With Agrippina travelling by boat from the Bay of Naples, Nero orchastrated for the boat to sink. Reared as a patrician, Agrippina could fortunately swim back to land. However, Nero was resolute and, according to the contemporary historian Suetonis, he plotted several unsuccessful attemps to kill Agrippina, one where her roof fell down. Agrippina was stabbed to death by three of Nero’s soldiers in her country house in year 59, on March 23rd. She was uncremated and buried hastily in an unmarked grave outside of Rome, even without a ceremony and state honours. Her savage son, pretending to live in oblivion of his mother’s horrendous fate and that she even had existed, was to rule Rome until year 68. Because of this lowly burrial, Agrippina could easily be wiped out of Rome’s history, even though she was its de facto ruler for over 10 years through her husband and son. It was too bashful for the Roman people to have had a woman have Rome in her grip for so long.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Julia-Agrippina\n\nhttp://etc.ancient.eu/education/agrippina-the-younger/\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/caligulas-sister-julia-agrippina-scandalized-rome-116800\n\nhttp://study.com/academy/lesson/agrippina-the-younger-facts-history.html\n\nhttps://heroinesofhistory.wikispaces.com/Agrippina+the+Younger?responseToken=6fd061f57662861fb08fe21cf6aea018\n\nhttp://biography.yourdictionary.com/agrippina-the-younger\n\nhttp://alltomhistoria.se/artikler/claudius-daren-som-raddade-rom\n\nAgrippina den yngre, Historiepodden"
