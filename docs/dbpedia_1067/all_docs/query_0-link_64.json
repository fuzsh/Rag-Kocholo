        "text": "This was an encouraging start. I know that this is the level of paper that we would have given to maybe even second year students, so there is no suggestion from the outset that this is in any way ‘dumbing down’. I was also pleased with the way in which it engaged me. I haven’t thought about something as seriously as this for too long.\n\nHaving said that, I am out of practice as far as retaining information is concerned and I am going to have to take this even more slowly at first than I had anticipated. I didn’t get through half of it in the time I had allowed and will probably take another couple of sessions over it.\n\nBut this is the way I want to think about reading, about the process and about how we make meaning of what we read. Not about the process of decoding, important though that is, but about the process of building the world of the book and the way in which we relate to that world.\n\nThe two questions I’ve been asked to consider are,\n\nWhat does Scholes mean when he refers to reading as an ” intertextual activity”?\n\nWhat is intertextuality?\n\nCertainly, he doesn’t mean by intertextuality what I would have meant when I was discussing it as part of teaching about reading. Then I would have been referring to the referencing of other specific literary texts within the text being studied. In fact Scholes does this on a couple of occasions with an oblique reference to As You Like It and another to Alice Through the Looking-Glass. Rather, he is talking about the way in which the reader builds the text that they read by reference to not only the words on the page but what he calls “a file of connected signs” that allow us “to place the new text in its proper relation to the old ones.”\n\nBut then we have to consider what he means by text and that isn’t just literary texts, neither is it only creative texts in terms of music and art and drama. He is talking about the same sort of notion that I was working with when I used to tell the students that children learn to read by comparing what the text appears to be telling them with what they know about the way in which the world works. And this is why he can talk about us never being outside of the textuality that allows us to interpret a text even if we are outside of the text itself.\n\nI like this idea. It is the way in which I want to work with texts. But then I have to ask myself how different is this to what Ewan is trying to do with the students on the Shakespeare Course and I suspect that it isn’t that far away. So, where is the seat of the problem that I feel I have with that? It comes back to the ever present question of assessment and to some extent to a question of trust.\n\nThere will be certain signs in that file that will be available generally and will be widely understood in any discussion of a text that draws upon them for interpretation. There will be others that will be personal. They won’t necessarily make the interpretation any less valid but they will be impossible for anyone else to confirm. Students (and for that matter theatre directors, thinking about the current production of Troilus and Cressida) have to learn to select signs that can be read generally. Otherwise you are going to have an interpretation that speaks to no one else and leaves anyone trying to assess it floundering. The only way round this is going to be if you feel you can trust the student to be making a genuine textual link even if you can’t follow it and that makes you subjective as a marker.\n\nThere are several other points here that I want to consider further, perhaps to shape into a post for the book blog.\n\n“We read knowing that our lives as readers of this particular text are limited and that each word moves us closer to the end.”\n\n“The same person never reads the same book twice.”\n\n“What we get from reading is precisely balanced by what we give.”\n\n“Reading is not just a matter of standing safely outside texts, where their power cannot reach us. It is a matter of entering, of passing through the looking glass and seeing ourselves on the other side.”\n\n“To read at all, we must read the book of ourselves in the text in front of us, and we must bring the text home, into our thoughts and lives, into our judgements and deeds. We cannot enter the texts we read, but they can enter us. That is what reading is all about.”\n\nI also want to consider the issue of centripetal and centrifugal reading. I find this fascinating, the notion of reading back to the centre in order to try and find the original meaning of a text. At last it gives me a handle on the notion of hermeneutics.\n\nThere is enough there to keep me going for sometime."
