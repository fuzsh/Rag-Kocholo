        "text": "Knocking out PKR and B2M in SJ293TS improves LV titers\n\nEarly-passage SJ293TS cells were transduced with lentivirus-based virus-like particles packaging Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Cas9-VLP) to disrupt the ORF of both EIF2AK2 and B2M, which encode the proteins PKR and B2M, respectively, by creating small insertions or deletions (INDELs) within the cellular genome. Four Cas9-VLP preparations were made; two targeting EIF2AK2 within exons 3 and 4 and two targeting B2M within exons 1 and 2 (Table S1). We chose two sites per target such that concurrent cutting could result in complete deletion of the intervening sequence between the two exons of 4,092 base pairs (bp) in EIF2AK2 and 891 bp in B2M, respectively, to increase disruption of the ORF. SJ293TS cells were transduced with both Cas9-VLPs targeting EIF2AK2. Forty-eight hours later, the same cells were then transduced with two preparations of Cas9-VLP targeting B2M. After another 48 h, individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution and expanded. At the same time, we used targeted deep sequencing using next generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate editing within the bulk population (Table S2). For EIF2AK2, INDEL formation was detected in 32.2% of exon 3 reads and 53.3% of exon 4 reads, while INDEL formation was detected in 77.1% of B2M exon 1 reads and 24.8% of B2M exon 2 reads. Targeted deep sequencing also detected large deletions of the intervening sequence between exons of both genes suggesting simultaneous editing occurred. Although these large deletions resulted in sequence reads of varying length and sequence, approximately 20% (18.5% and 19.3% for EIF2AK2 and B2M, respectively) were exactly as predicted based on Cas9 cutting between the third and fourth nucleotide of the protospacer upstream of the PAM sequence. Thus, we estimated that at least 41% of cells contained knockout of both genes.\n\nWe used anti-sense LV production as a screen for loss of PKR in individual clones. We screened 45 individual clones using an anti-sense LV, SJL21-MND-GFP, and compared titers with LV preparations generated from the parent cell line, SJ293TS. We included an LV with an expression cassette in the forward orientation, SJL12-MND-GFP, as a control. Both LVs expressed a GFP reporter, and transfections were performed at 5-mL scale and not diluted post-transfection. As expected, the SJ293TS-produced anti-sense LV had a 4-fold lower titer than the sense LV (0.8 × 108 vs. 3.1 × 108 TUs/mL). While most clones produced SJL12-MND-GFP similarly to the parent, eight clones produced anti-sense LV titers >3-fold higher (range 3.1–5.6-fold) compared with the parental cell line, suggesting at least partial loss of PKR in these clones (Figure S1). These clones were also assayed for loss of B2M expression by cell surface staining and flow cytometry (Figure S2). Of these top eight anti-sense LV producing clones, five were negative and three were positive for B2M expression. The three B2M-positive clones and one B2M-negative clone, 3A7, which was highly aggregate in culture, were excluded from further study. NGS data from the four remaining clones indicated the presence of INDELs within all copies of the EIF2AK2 and B2M ORF except for possibly one EIF2AK2 allele in clone 4E3, which appeared intact (data not shown). Generally, these INDELs resulted in the insertion of a stop codon or alternate ORF creating missense or truncated protein. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates and purified viral particles confirmed loss of PKR and B2M expression in these clones, except for clone 4E3, which retained partial PKR expression ( A–2C). Consistent with the loss of B2M, MHC-I could not be detected on the surface of B2M null clones or in purified viral particles ( D and S3). Despite partial retention of PKR expression by clone 4E3, we continued to evaluate it given that initial anti-sense LV titers were >3-fold higher than the parent suggesting partial knockdown of PKR is sufficient to overcome low anti-sense LV titers. Next, to identify a clone that was readily transfected and could consistently produce high titers of the more commonly used sense LV, we repeatedly produced SJL12-MND-GFP from each clone and compared the transfection efficiency and resulting titers to the parent, SJ293TS ( ). While there were no statistically significant differences in titer or transfection efficiency, the mean titer and transfection efficiency of clones 31G12 and 34D5 tended to be slightly lower than the parental cell line. In contrast, the mean titer and transfection efficiency of clones 39G4 and 4E3 were slightly higher than the parental cell line, suggesting they were not inferior to SJ293TS cells. Thus, we narrowed our focus further by continuing to study only the highest-performing clones, 39G4 and 4E3.\n\nTo evaluate the clones more rigorously, SJ293TS cells, along with clones 4E3 and 39G4, were continuously passaged for 4 months by three independent operators and were periodically transfected to produce two simple GFP-expressing sense and anti-sense LV vectors, SJL12-MND-GFP and SJL21-MND-GFP, respectively, and one clinically relevant anti-B7-H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expressing LV, SJL651. To reduce potential variability inherent with titration, vector preparations, upon harvest, were stored at −80°C until completion of the study, and subsequently titered at the same time ( ). Although some variability was evident between time points, there were no significant decreases in titer from any cell line regardless of vector produced. All three cell lines produced similar titers of SJL12-MND-GFP on average. As expected, anti-sense LV titers produced by both clones were significantly higher than those produced by SJ293TS (p < 1 × 10−7) ( B). Clones 39G4 and 4E3 produced, on average, 7.6-fold and 4.9-fold more anti-sense LV TUs, respectively, than SJ293TS cells. Interestingly, the mean anti-sense LV titer derived from clone 39G4 was also significantly higher than the mean anti-sense LV titer produced by clone 4E3 by 1.6-fold (p = 0.002) likely due to clone 4E3’s partial PKR expression. Last, statistical analysis comparing the mean titers of SJL651 generated from each cell line indicated that clone 39G4 produced significantly more TUs than both the parental cell line and clone 4E3 (p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). Thus, clone 39G4 was chosen for further study and designated as SJ293TS-DPB.\n\nAddition of LV-MAX media to FreeStyle 293 expression media improves titers and reduces handling\n\nNext, we characterized SJ293TS-DPB growth in culture. Growth curves comparing SJ293TS and SJ293TS-DPB cultured in FreeStyle 293 Expression medium (FreeStyle) were similar (Figure S4) with cell density peaking around 3 × 106 per mL before declining. This means that at the time of transfection, when cells are seeded at 2 × 106 per mL, the media is unlikely to fully support the cells during 48 h of vector production. Thus, we reasoned that an SFM capable of sustaining a higher cell density may allow cells to be more productive after transfection by providing a more nutrient-rich environment. To test this, we replaced our current media, FreeStyle, with LV-MAX, an SFM reported to support HEK293 cell densities up to 107 cells per mL. With clinical-grade large-scale production in mind, we supplemented FreeStyle with various amounts of LV-MAX to reduce costs, since LV-MAX costs more than twice as much as FreeStyle. To this end, SJ293TS-DPB cells were adapted to grow in LV-MAX alone (100%) or FreeStyle supplemented with 10%, 20%, 30%, or 50% LV-MAX. SJ293TS-DPB cells were thawed directly into the various media formulations and cultured for 5 weeks to ensure the cells had fully adapted before testing was performed. Typically, subculturing cells involves pelleting and suspending cells in 100% fresh FreeStyle. However, this manipulation is time-consuming, increases the risk of contamination, and is impractical for volumes larger than 1 L. Thus, we assessed whether SJ293TS-DPB cells, regardless of media formulation, could maintain high-titer LV production when passaged and prepared for transfection only by dilution with fresh media. For passaging, all cell cultures were maintained at a similar cell density, which was typically ∼3 × 106 cells per mL before diluting to 4 to 5 × 105 cells per mL with fresh media. Since cell cultures were seeded at 2 × 106 per mL for immediate transfection (referred to as “same day” transfections), they typically contained around 60%–80% conditioned media. We also seeded cells at an initial lower cell density of 1 × 106 per mL so that the conditioned media content was reduced by half. We then allowed these cells to grow for 24 h to reach ∼2 × 106 per mL before proceeding with transfection (referred to as “next day” transfections). Prior to this experiment, we verified that SJ293TS-DPB maintained similar doubling times, regardless of media formulation, so that 24 h after seeding, the cultures would reach the desired cell density (data not shown). As a control for these experiments, we included SJ293TS-DPB cells that were maintained and prepared for transfection as described above by suspending cell pellets in completely fresh FreeStyle. Regardless of the day of transfection, the resulting titers showed the same trend for each group ( ). Transfecting cells in 100% fresh FreeStyle media (control) led to higher titers compared with transfection in cultures containing conditioned FreeStyle media, although only next day transfections produced titers that were statistically different (p = 6.7 × 10−5). Supplementing FreeStyle media with 10%, 20%, or 30% LV-MAX also resulted in increased titers with 30% LV-MAX achieving the highest titer relative to the control group (2.4- and 2.7-fold increases for next day and same day transfections, respectively). Interestingly, despite having higher transfection rates, cells cultured in 50% LV-MAX had only modestly improved titers of 1.2- to 1.5-fold vs. the control group ( and S5). Similarly, cells cultured in 100% LV-MAX also had higher transfection efficiency compared with the control group, but titers were reduced by 3-fold. These results suggest that concentrations ≥50% LV-MAX have a negative effect on LV production. Although cells cultured in 30% LV-MAX had the highest titers, titers from cells cultured in 20% LV-MAX were not significantly different (same day p = 0.47, next day p = 1). In contrast, next day titers from cells cultured in 20% LV-MAX were significantly higher than titers from cells grown in 10% LV-MAX (p = 0.014). For this reason and to reduce costs while significantly increasing titers, all succeeding studies were performed with SJ293TS-DPB cells cultured in FreeStyle with 20% LV-MAX. Furthermore, the addition of LV-MAX had no impact on downstream purification as yields from 1-L vector preparations, 54% ± 12%, N = 38, were similar to those previously reported (Table S3).13\n\nOptimizing SJ293TS-DPB cell density and growth phase for lentiviral vector production\n\nFollow-up experiments characterizing the growth of SJ293TS-DPB cells in FreeStyle with 20% LV-MAX showed that cell densities could reach ∼5 × 106 per mL with viability >98% before declining (Figure S4). Since FreeStyle with 20% LV-MAX could support higher cell densities, we examined if increasing cell density at the time of transfection would lead to increased titers. In this experiment, SJ293TS-DPB cells were expanded to 4.8 × 106 per mL before seeding for transfection at our standard cell density of 2 × 106 per mL and at higher cell densities of 3 and 4 × 106 per mL. Although the amount of DNA and PEI per million cells was kept constant, there was no increase in TU per mL and transfection efficiency decreased with increasing cell density (Figure S6). Next, we examined if the phase of cellular growth would affect LV production. To test this, three separate cultures of SJ293TS-DPB cells were grown to cell densities of either 3 × 106, 4 × 106, or 5.4 × 106 per mL. Based on the growth curve in Figure S4, we considered these cultures to be in log, late-log, or stationary phase, respectively. Each culture was used to seed shaker flasks at either 2 × 106 cells per mL for same day transfection or 1 × 106 cells per mL for next day transfection (Figure S7). Regardless of day of transfection, cells in log phase produced significantly more TU than cells in stationary phase (p < 0.05). Cells in late-log phase also produced significantly more TU than cells in stationary phase but only when transfected the next day (p < 0.05). Regardless of significance, there was a clear trend where cells in log phase produced more TUs than cells in stationary phase. Thus, for future vector production, cells were not expanded beyond 4 × 106 per mL to keep them in either log or late-log phase.\n\nLentiviral vector production\n\nLV production was performed as described in Bauler et al.13 Briefly, cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells per mL, or as stated in the text, were transfected with a vector plasmid and the following helper plasmids, pCAG-kGP1-1R-AF (gagpol), pCAG-VSVG-AF (VSV-G), and pCMV-REV-AF (Rev), at a ratio of 14:4:2:0.25, respectively. All transfections were performed using PEIpro (Polyplus Transfection, Strasbourg, France). Transfection reagents were scaled up proportionally depending on the volume of vector production. Before mixing, plasmid DNA was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Corning) to 40 μg/mL, and PEIpro was diluted to 80 μg/mL in PBS. The transfection mixture was then incubated for approximately 5 min before being added directly to the cell culture. Vector preparations scheduled for downstream purification or as noted in the text were diluted with an equal volume of fresh Freestyle 293 Expression media. At the same time, Benzonase was added to the cell culture to achieve a final concentration of 6.25 U/mL. Vector supernatants were harvested 48 h post transfection and clarified by centrifugation to remove cells, filtered through 0.45- and 0.22-μm filters and either subjected to further purification or stored at −80°C before titration.\n\nFor downstream processing, LV containing supernatant was adjusted to 300 mM NaCl with 50 mM Tris pH, 8.0 before being loaded onto either a 0.86 mL Mustang Q XT Acrodisc or a 5 mL Mustang Q XT5 ion-exchange capsule (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) per the manufacturer’s instructions using an Akta Avant chromatography system (Cytiva). The Mustang Q XT Acrodisc was used when the total LV supernatant volume was ≤100 mL. For larger volumes, the 5-mL Mustang Q XT5 ion-exchange capsule was employed. Regardless of column used, after loading, the membrane was washed with 10 column volumes of 300 mM NaCl with 50 mM Tris pH, 8.0, and LV particles were eluted from the column by using 2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH, 8.0. When using the Mustang Q XT Acrodisc, viral particles were eluted in 1 mL and directly loaded into a PD10 desalting column (Cytiva). After buffer exchange, the eluate was mixed 1:1 with X-VIVO 10 or X-VIVO 15 media (Lonza) for a final volume of 2 mL. Eluates from the 5-mL Mustang Q XT5 ion-exchange capsule were diluted 5-fold with PBS and diafiltrated twice in PBS using a Vivaflow 50 with a 100,000 molecular weight cutoff (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before a final diafiltration was performed in X-VIVO 10 or X-VIVO 15 media (Lonza) to achieve a final concentration of about 50-fold from the starting material. Purified and concentrated vectors were then 0.22-μm filtered, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C before being titrated.\n\nProtein extraction and western blot analysis\n\nProtein samples were prepared by incubation of cell pellets with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) Lysis and Extraction Buffer and HALT Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice for 30 min. Lysates were then cleared through centrifugation at 4°C and 10,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected and used for a Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to determine protein concentration. Total protein (40 μg per lane) was resolved on 4%–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad, Carlsbad, CA), and then transferred to an Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane using wet transfer for 30 min at 100 V constant voltage.\n\nFor protein isolation from lentiviral particles, viral supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Cleared supernatant was removed, and viral pellets were suspended in PBS and incubated on ice for 2 h. An equal volume of RIPA buffer (described above) was added to the suspended viral particles and processed as described above. Total protein (30 μg for B2M detection or 100 ng for HIV1 p24 detection) was used for downstream protein gel electrophoresis and blotting.\n\nThe primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-PKR (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, #12297; clone D7F7), rabbit anti-B2M (Cell Signaling, #12851; clone D8P1H), mouse anti-Gapdh (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, sc-47724; clone 0411), and mouse anti-HIV1 p24 (Invitrogen, Thermo-Fischer Scientific, MA, 1–71515; clone 5). Blocking was performed in TBS-based Intercept Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) with 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) added during primary and secondary antibody incubations. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW and goat anti-mouse IRDye 680LT (LI-COR Biotechnology, #926–32211 and #926–68020). Membranes were imaged using an LI-COR Odyssey M Infrared Imaging System.\n\nThe Jess Automated Western Blot system (Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the MHC-I western blot. Briefly, 3 μg of viral lysates in RIPA buffer were prepared with the EZ standard Fluorescent Master mix containing 200 mM dithiothreitol solution and loaded on a 12- to 230-kDa cartridge (Bio-Techne). EZ biotinylated ladder was used together with the streptavidin-NIR ready-made solution. Antibody diluent 2 was used during blocking and to prepare the solutions for primary and secondary antibody incubations. For detection, a 1:150 dilution of HLA class I ABC rabbit Polyclonal antibody (15240-1-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL) and a 1:250 dilution of HIV-1 Gag p24 mouse antibody Clone # 749122 (Bio-Techne) were used to detect MHC-I and HIV-1 p24, respectively. The Anti-Rabbit HRP Conjugate (Bio-Techne) and the Anti-Mouse Secondary NIR Antibody (Bio-Techne) were used as secondary antibodies at 1:20 dilution."
