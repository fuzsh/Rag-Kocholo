        "text": "Scholarship endowment is critical to ensuring that Cornell’s doors remain open to bright and deserving students regardless of their financial circumstances. An endowed scholarship becomes a permanent tribute to the person whose name it bears, and it can always be augmented. In many families, adding to a scholarship fund has become a multi-generational tradition.\n\nDonors receive annual reports on the student awardee(s) and on the financial status of the fund. Income from these endowments is pooled to support needy students and may be directed to students based on a donor’s specific preferences. All scholarships are administered through the university’s Financial Aid Office—students do not apply directly for these funds.\n\nIncome from all funds provides undergraduate scholarship support for students enrolled in the Cornell Peter and Stephanie Nolan School of Hotel Administration unless otherwise noted.\n\n2018 Anonymous International School of Hotel Administration Undergraduate Scholarship\n\nEstablished July 31, 2018 by anonymous donors.\n\nArthur ’78 and Karen ’78 Adler Scholarship\n\nEstablished February 8, 2008 by Arthur B.
