        "text": "In a previous post, the Black-Scholes option pricing formula for a non-dividend and dividend-paying European stock option was introduced. In actuality, there exist several extensions of the model that are used for pricing European options with different underlying assets, such as currency, futures, stock indexes, and more.\n\nDue to the number of different extensions and options on possible underlying assets, a generalized Black-Scholes model was created to simplify computations by significantly reducing the number of equations. In this post, we will explore several of the Black-Scholes option pricing models for different underlying assets and then introduce the generalized Black-Scholes pricing formula.\n\nFirst, import the libraries and functions that we will use later in the post.\n\nFutures Options¶\n\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing formula for European forward or futures options with an initial price $F$ was proposed by Black himself in 1976. Hence the name of the equation is generally known as the 'Black-76' formula and is defined as:\n\n$$ C = e^{-rT} \\big[ FN(d_1) - KN(d_2) \\big] $$$$ P = e^{-rT} \\big[KN(-d_2) - FN(-d_1)\\big] $$\n\nWhere, as before:\n\n$T$, the maturity of the option. Time to maturity is defined as $T - t$\n\n$K$, strike price of the option\n\n$r$, the risk-free interest rate, assumed to be constant between $t$ and $T$\n\n$\\sigma$, volatility of underlying asset, the standard deviation of the asset returns\n\n$N(d)$ is the normal cumulative distribution function, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are defined as:\n\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln \\left(\\frac{F}{K} \\right) + T \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$$$$d_2 = \\frac{\\ln \\left(\\frac{F}{K} \\right) - T \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T} $$\n\nA possible implementation in Python of the Black-Scholes-76 model for pricing European futures options for approximate and exact results is as follows:\n\nAs an example, consider a futures contract with nine months to expiration. The price of the futures contract and the strike price is $20, with a risk-free interest rate of 15% and a volatility of 40% per year. To find the price of the futures contract, we enter these variables into the above function.\n\nStock Index Options¶\n\nRobert Merton, who was working with Fischer Black and Myron Scholes on their now famous equation until a difference in opinion led to them to part ways, extended the Black-Scholes model to price European call and put options on a stock or stock index paying a known continuous dividend yield.\n\n$$ C = Se^{-qT} N(d_1) - Ke^{-rT} N(d_2) $$$$ P = Ke^{-rT} N(-d_2) - Se^{-qT} N(d_1) $$\n\nWhere $q$ is the known dividend yield and:\n\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{\\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{K} \\right) + T \\left(r - q + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} $$$$ d_2 = \\frac{\\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{K} \\right) + T \\left(r - q - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T} $$\n\nOne possible implementation (a rough and unoptimized one) of Merton's extension to the Black-Scholes formula for both approximate and exact results\n\nGeneralized Black-Scholes Model¶\n\nAs we've seen, there are quite a few different extensions of the original Black-Scholes formula for European options with various underlying securities, and this was only a sample! Wouldn't it be great if we could find a generalized form of the Black-Scholes model that applies to multiple European options rather than having to memorize and program a bunch of different model forms? Luckily for us, there does exist a generalized form! The generalized Black-Scholes model can be used to price European call and put options on stocks, stocks paying a dividend, futures, margined futures, and currency. This generalization is accomplished by adding a new variable $b$, which is defined as the cost-of-carry rate. The cost-of-carry rate calculation is dependent on the type of option one wishes to price.\n\n$b = r$\n\nBlack-Scholes model for European stock options\n\n$b = r - q$\n\nMerton's extension to the model for pricing European stock options with a continuous dividend yield and stock indexes\n\n$b = 0$\n\nBlack Fischer's extension for pricing European futures options\n\n$b = r - r_j$\n\nModel for pricing European currency options\n\nThe generalized Black-Scholes model for a European call and put option is defined as:\n\n$$ C = Se^{T(b-r)} N(d_1) - Ke^{-rT} N(d_2) $$$$ P = Ke^{-rT} N(-d_2) - Se^{T(b-r)} N(-d_1) $$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$ d1 = \\frac{ \\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{K} \\right) + T \\left(b + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} $$$$ d2 = d1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T} $$\n\nBelow is one possible implementation of the generalized Black-Scholes formula for approximate and exact results."
