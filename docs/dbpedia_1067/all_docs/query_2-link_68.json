        "text": "About the Book\n\n\"This book in manuscript form has been class-tested three times. This course was a doctoral seminar that was open to finance masters and doctoral students and also STEM students across the university. All of these students contributed a great deal to catching errors, forcing us to re-think how we said something, and in some cases contributing end-of-chapter problems. This book would be nowhere near ready for prime time were it not for them.\"--\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nAn accessible and mathematically rigorous resource for masters and PhD students\n\nIn Foundations of the Pricing of Financial Derivatives: Theory and Analysis two expert finance academics with professional experience deliver a practical new text for doctoral and masters' students and also new practitioners. The book draws on the authors extensive combined experience teaching, researching, and consulting on this topic and strikes an effective balance between fine-grained quantitative detail and high-level theoretical explanations.\n\nThe authors fill the gap left by books directed at masters'-level students that often lack mathematical rigor. Further, books aimed at mathematically trained graduate students often lack quantitative explanations and critical foundational materials. Thus, this book provides the technical background required to understand the more advanced mathematics used in this discipline, in class, in research, and in practice.\n\nReaders will also find:\n\nTables, figures, line drawings, practice problems (with a solutions manual), references, and a glossary of commonly used specialist terms\n\nReview of material in calculus, probability theory, and asset pricing\n\nCoverage of both arithmetic and geometric Brownian motion\n\nExtensive treatment of the mathematical and economic foundations of the binomial and Black-Scholes-Merton models that explains their use and derivation, deepening readers' understanding of these essential models\n\nDeep discussion of essential concepts, like arbitrage, that broaden students' understanding of the basis for derivative pricing\n\nCoverage of pricing of forwards, futures, and swaps, including arbitrage-free term structures and interest rate derivatives\n\nAn effective and hands-on text for masters'-level and PhD students and beginning practitioners with an interest in financial derivatives pricing, Foundations of the Pricing of Financial Derivatives is an intuitive and accessible resource that properly balances math, theory, and practical applications to help students develop a healthy command of a difficult subject.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nPraise for FOUNDATIONS of the PRICING of FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES\n\n\"This book stands out for me in at least two important ways. First, quite incredibly, the authors have succeeded in presenting financial derivatives in a remarkably accessible user-friendly manner that integrates technical derivatives' mathematics with insightful conceptual understanding, enabling students to easily navigate the complex minefield of ideas and applications involved. Second, it combines a strong academic focus with an equivalent emphasis on addressing real-world problems across different echelons of difficulty levels.\"\n\n-- PRADEEP YADAV, W. Ross Johnston Chair and Professor of Finance, University of Oklahoma\n\n\"This is a comprehensive and cleverly developed book on derivatives. It is an excellent text for advanced Master's and Ph.D. students (and for reference by professionals).\"\n\n-- JIMMY HILLIARD, Harbert Eminent Scholar and Professor of Finance, Auburn University\n\n\"The authors are great storytellers; they make derivatives come alive. The subject is obviously highly technical and intimidating at times, but they have made it so accessible, relevant and, most importantly, fun. The topics covered are comprehensive and yet very selective with all the right choices and emphasis. I wholeheartedly recommend this excellent textbook for both novice and advanced students of derivatives.\"\n\n--YISONG S. TIAN, Professor of Finance, York University\n\nAbout the Author\n\nROBERT E. BROOKS, PHD, CFA, is Professor Emeritus of Finance at the University of Alabama. He is the President of Financial Risk Management, LLC, a quantitative finance consulting firm. He is the author of several books and maintains a YouTube channel, @FRMHelpForYou."
