        "text": "Cat – RIP 3pm 19th Jan. 2024\n\nFinally laid to rest, my mate and companion for the last 13 years. We have shared good times and hard times, memories of laughter and pain. Turning up after the 2011 flood he found a way into our hearts, we called him what he was, Cat, it was shorter and easier to say than Flood Debris. We found our recently he was originally micro chipped in 2006 and was from Kangaroo Flat (no owner name) and was named Duck and recorded as dead. Hence was officially a dead Duck.So many stories we could tell. It is amazing how we become attached to our pets and what they mean in our lives. Over the last 13 years he slept where no other has. It hard to image being in my bed now without him curled up asleep beside me. Waking me up at daylight each morning looking for an extra bit of contact and a cuddle. I still walk around expecting to see him stretched out on his favourite couch or chair or sitting patiently at the door waiting to have his collar and lead put on to go for a walk. But the time had come and he was unable to do those he enjoyed anymore and life was becoming a painful burden and what had to be done was done. Now at rest and peace. He was bought home and buried at the bottom of the garden overlooking the river. A place, where we can sit in the evenings; talk, reflect and share old memories.\n\nThis photo was taken from the river bank directly behind our place at Mulwarrie Studios, Bridgewater.\n\nIt is interesting to note the number of scarred trees in the photo.\n\nYellow Lip Spider Orchid – Caladenia xanthochila. The following photos were two and half decades in the making – Some two decades ago there was only one known specimen of this species left in the Kooyoora region. Fifteen years went into locating the species and the follow-up research of how to successfully propagate and grow this species in the laboratory. Much of the initial field work was done with Geoff Neville, while Julie Radford has conducted the propagation, growing and overseeing the reintroduction and on-going monitoring of this species back into the local environment. We are now 9 years into the reintroduction phase and learning more as time goes on. These photos are from this season flowering of one of our rarest, still most threatened and beautiful orchid species.\n\nThis is just one of the many environmental projects that the Friends of Kooyoora volunteers are involved in.\n\nMembers of the Friends of Kooyoora supported by Parks Vic. spent yesterday in and around the Kooyoora State Park conducting sessions for the senior pupils and staff of the Tarnagulla Primary School as part of the “Friends” Bush Colours Project. A project which is aimed at the development of teaching resources and programs to educate about, and develop an appreciation of, our natural environment and eco-systems to our next generations.\n\nVolunteers, schools or other groups that may wish to become involved in this or other projects conducted by the Friends of Kooyoora can contact the Association by email: kooyoorafriends@gmail.com"
