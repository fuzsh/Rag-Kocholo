        "text": "Samantha Solomon American Moderns 24 March 2014\n\nScholes begins by laying out the objectives for his chapter, which are to first look at how the terms “High” and “Low” were used in critical discourse when discussing modernism, and to show how they incorrectly translate into what is “Good” or “Bad” (3). Scholes’ goal is to show that the paradox between High and Low Modernism should make us rethink the canon and reassess marginalized texts.\n\nScholes argues that we need to reexamine the paradoxes of modernism brought on by many major modernist theorists.\n\nLukács: Believed that the novel was a form of high literary art, but that the entertainment novel was meaningless. He thought the novel should “do serious cultural work” (5). Scholes argues that the divide Lukàcs created between entertainment and representation never existed and that literature cannot be classified rigidly. The problem Lukàcs identifies is helpful—how can entertainment and suspense be combined in a novel that also is a serious representation of modern life? (13-14).\n\nGreenberg: American art critic who assessed the High/Low divide through the lens of class. The rich and cultivated created the avant-garde, and the uneducated lower classes created “Kitsch”—popular art that Greenberg deemed cheap. High art is difficult, Low art is easy. Problems with Greenberg’s argument: 1). Aesthetic values don’t translate to alterations in social structure. 2). Formulas have a place in all art—that doesn’t make it “Kitsch.” 3). “Kitsch” does demand time from customers, since it is a remedy for boredom.\n\nAdorno and Horkheimer: “Light art” does not betray serious art, but it does provide a social necessity for those who are excluded from serious art (15). Art is and has always been a commodity. The problem is that Adorno and Horkheimer assume that all “light art” is produced by the culture industry for the masses who are too tired to enjoy serious art. Light art has been produced by skilled artists throughout history. “Serious” and “light” are not binary oppositions.\n\nWhat is high and low seriousness? What is high and low comedy? These do not lead to a distinction between what is good and bad art—“We run into difficulties when we apply evaluative terminology to entire categories, whether these be literary, artistic, social, or racial” (17).\n\nAll of the above critics are political leftists, so Scholes goes on to include some right-wing opinions.\n\nAllen Tate (new Critic): Differentiates between “good poetry” and “bad poetry” by identifying whether it has the quality of “tension.” Since mass media has debased our language, poets are forced to use more obscure language—Tate traces this back to 1798, when the first edition of Lyrical Ballads was published.\n\n-Mass media Kitsch caused avant-garde, creating the great divide. Many on the right believed the High was a salvation from the Low.\n\n-The problem: most readers prefer “bad” poetry! They are unwilling to deal in the obscure—the response to this was New Criticism, which believed the work should be able to stand on its own.\n\nMany of these critics believed that entertainment and representation should not be mixed. Others disagreed. For example, Woolf constantly tried to connect the high and the low—“middlebrow”\n\nEver since Aristotle, the High/Low divide has been mixed with social and aesthetic qualities and the economic/social became mingled with aesthetic/moral. In this formula, good taste equals good behavior, and the rich are ethically superior.\n\n“We need the full range of Modernist literature and art in order to understand Modernism—and we need Modernism to understand modernity and hence to see ourselves from the other side” (31-32).\n\nQuestions: 1). If we agree with Scholes, we need to analyze all kinds of art in order to fully understand modernism—comics, comedy, jokes, etc. Do you agree? Should these things be included in the modernist canon? 2). Which texts that we’ve read so far this semester seem to disrupt the supposed relationship between “high and low” and social class?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
