        "text": "This Black Scholes calculator is an important tool for options traders to set a rational price for stock options.\n\nIf you are investing in stocks, you want to make informed decisions that will reflect the return on invested capital. Without a mathematical framework as a guide, it will be no different from gambling. Black Scholes removes the guesswork involved in predicting stock price movement so that arbitrage opportunities are minimal across markets.\n\nContinue reading this article to know:\n\nWhat is a stock option?\n\nWhat is the Black Scholes model?\n\nHow do you calculate stock options value using the Black Scholes formula?\n\nYou will also find an example of using the Black Scholes model calculator.\n\nWhat is a Stock option?\n\nAn option is a contract that gives the owner a right to buy or sell an asset for a specific price (also known as the strike price) on or before a specific date (also known as the expiration date).\n\nAlthough most options traders rarely exercise their option rights before the expiration date, you may exercise an American option at any time before the option expires. But you can only exercise a European option on the expiration date.\n\nFinancial market traders buy and sell options as protection (or hedge) against uncertainty in the financial market. There are two types of options:\n\nCall option – gives the owner the right to buy the asset at the strike price; and\n\nPut option – gives the owner the right to sell the asset at the strike price.\n\nFor example, assuming you bought 100 shares of Tesla (TSLA) stocks at $500 per share today (present value = 100 × 500 = $50,000). You believe the price of the shares will increase quickly to $600 per share by next month, so you can sell it (future value = 100 × 600 = $60,000) at a profit of $10,000.\n\nBut you can’t be too sure, things can go differently, and the price of a TSLA share can fall below the current $500 price, losing you money. Or it can rise even higher than $600, and you’ll be wishing you’d bought 200 shares.\n\nFor a fair price, you can buy a put option contract to protect yourself or a call option to take advantage of the opportunity if the price indeed rises higher.\n\nThe put option contract will state the strike price, e.g., $550, the number of stocks you will be selling, e.g., 100 shares, and the exact date the contract expires.\n\nIf TSLA share price falls below $550 per share by the specified expiry date on the contract, you can choose to exercise your right to sell the stocks for the strike price of $550 to the option writer you bought the put option from. So, assuming the price went as low as $250, exercising your put option means protecting yourself from the market downturn and selling at a profit of $50 earning per share instead of being at a loss. But if TSLA share price rises over $550 or to the expected price of $600, you can decide to let your put option expire since you will earn more money selling at a higher price in the market.\n\nConversely, if you had bought a call option with the strike price of $550, when the price rises over $550 or to the expected price of $600, you can decide to exercise your call option and buy the shares at a lower price of $550 to sell at a profit in the market. If the price falls below the strike price, you won’t need to exercise your call option.\n\nTo further explore the relationship between a call and put option, check out our put call parity calculator.\n\nHow do you know what is a fair price to pay for these options contract?\n\nThat’s what the Black Scholes calculator helps you determine. The model uses a partial differential equation to predict a stock’s price movement in the financial market and arrive at the price you should buy the call or put option. Hence, to use the Black Scholes formula, you need to provide the following information:\n\nCurrent price of the stock, also known as its spot price;\n\nStrike price;\n\nTime to the expiration of the options contract;\n\nRisk-free interest rate, or the rate specified in the option for a given stable asset or short-dated government bonds such as US Treasury bills;\n\nExpected volatility or unpredictability of the stock is expressed as the standard deviation of the stock price; and\n\nExpected dividend yield."
