        "text": "I saw the Sex Pistols at the Universal, and Pennywise open for the Vandals at LB arena. Social Distortion was sitting next to me drinking beers at the Doll Hut in Fullerton a while ago. Saw Surf Punks at Bogarts in LB to a long time ago. Oh yeah, Seven Seconds at Cuckoos Nest in Costa Mesa when that was happening back in 84 maybe? Lots of fun gigs back then for a young man to get in trouble at...\n\nRight on!!......you got that right! I guess I'll stand up and admit I'm an old punk rocker from the L.A. scene from late 70's~mid-80's. I used to hang out @ the Starwood, Whisky a Go Go, Club Lingerie etc......saw Exploited, The Crowd, Rik L Rik, Go Go's, Sham 69, Dead Boys, Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, Fear, Dickies, \"X\", Plimsouls, Meat Puppets, China White, TSOL, 45 Grave.......just tons o' bands. I'll always love aggresive music......\n\nI think I broke a tooth at an Exploited concert. Germs opened up for them. That's when someone punched me. That's when I scaled back going to concerts and started playing hockey. It was safer!\n\nI think I broke a tooth at an Exploited concert. Germs opened up for them. !\n\nYou sure about that? I wasn't 'there' but I gotta call you out on that one. And not to be a punk rock history snob or anything but I'm reasonably certain that show would have never happened. The Exploited did not tour the US until 1982 and 'ol Darby OD'd in 1980. Sounds like one of those 440 Hemi confabulations, Vern.\n\nBut hey, I got kind of a dopey story about the Exploited. I went to an Exploited/Dr. Know show at the Anthrax in 87. I pulled in to the lot and my old '81 CJ 7 had actual flames coming out from under the hood caused by a cracked plastic valve cover spewing oil on the exhaust.\n\nNever went in to the show, had some more pressing issues to attend to.\n\nmy harley caught on fire at vans warp tour a couple years ago\n\nI was parked around back with the tour buses talking to some friends who were on tour when someone said \"hey your bike sure smokes allot\" turned around in time to see flames !\n\npositive wire shorted out and the insulation caught fire, cut the wire, put out the fire, wrapped it with black tape and rode home\n\nThe Ritz in Ybor city used to be a killer place to see punk and \"up and coming\" acts, with a real good chance of meeting the band before or after the show.\n\nI met Lee Ving of Fear (walked right in through the front door about 2 hours before show time.), a couple of the chicks from L7 (who put on a GREAT show), and D'Arcy and James from Smashing Pumpkins (right as Cherub Rock was starting to get airplay). All were VERY cool and not at all stuck up.\n\nI'd say it's about a 2500 cap venue, and \"back stage\" used to be literally out side on the railroad tracks.\n\nseen too many to recall there, but GWAR comes to mind along with Horton Heat, and more recently Mudvayne (who sucked live)\n\nYou sure about that? I wasn't 'there' but I gotta call you out on that one. And not to be a punk rock history snob or anything but I'm reasonably certain that show would have never happened.

I saw the Exploited in '85? in LA.\n\nI don't know who opened for them now that I can't remember. But I did see the germs and got punched. But I can show you my fake tooth! So long ago.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UPntV_YhY\"]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8UPntV_YhY[/ame]\n\nLook out get out of my way\n\nI'm going to the atomic cafe\n\nI'm going to the atomic cafe\n\nYou're a mystery to me kabuki girl\n\nDon't say sayonara\n\nI wanna see you tomorrow\n\nI wanna see you tonight\n\nYou're a mystery to me kabuki girl\n\nYour face is white your hair is black\n\nYou'll probably stab me in the back\n\nBut that's the chance that I'm gonna take\n\nDon't say sayonara\n\nI wanna see you tomorrow\n\nI wanna see you tonight\n\nYou're a mystery to me kabuki girl\n\nEast is east, west is west\n\nGirls from the east are the best\n\nThey got more of what I'm looking for\n\nLook out get out of my way\n\nI'm going to the atomic cafe\n\nI'm going to the atomic cafe\n\nYou're a mystery to me kabuki girl\n\nThe Atomic Cafe in downtown L.A.
