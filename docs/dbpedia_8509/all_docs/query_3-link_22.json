        "text": "Hello,\n\nMOH works the same for all types of endpoints, Jabber is no exception. Also, since the devices are on the internal network and doing an internal call, then it is unlikely to be a network/interop issue.\n\nCheck the Jabber MRGLs and ensure there's a MOH server. Verify that the same MOH server is active (Run Flag is set to \"Yes\") and registered with CUCM. If the Jabber device that initiates the call hold has a custom MOH audio source assigned, then please ensure that it is uploaded on all servers.\n\nHi Kaloyan,\n\nThank you for taking the time and replaying.\n\nIt looks like this is a known issue and I am not the first on having it. Here's another post on this community. The reason that I opened another post is because I don't understand what they did to resolve the issue. Our Jabber endpoints anre having the same MRGL that our physical phones have but the MOH btw internal Jobber endpoints is not working. Here's the link.\n\nhttps://community.cisco.com/t5/ip-telephony-and-phones/issue-with-jabber-and-moh/td-p/3043425\n\nThanks,\n\nMK\n\nOur MOH is Unicast but I turned on the Multicast on one of our MOH server but it still fails to play MOH.\n\nThe strange thing is when both parties put the call on hold and retrieve the call, the MOH works. It also works when we engage the Media Termination Point in the Jabber configuration page.\n\nThanks,\n\nMK\n\nIs there a firewall in the network between either the two Jabber users, or the MOH audio source (Pub/Subs or DSP Farm) and the users? I'm just trying to think through the flow for when you initiate a hold. If I recall the RTP stream between the users is stopped, then a stream is initiated from the MOH Source to the user who was placed on hold to play the music. If it doesn't work, then magically works after it's been initiated one time that almost sounds like it could be a stateful firewall in the way. I could be way off base btw as my networking skills are not very strong, but it may be worth looking at or spark some other ideas."
