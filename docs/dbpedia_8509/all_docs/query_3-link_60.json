        "text": "At last, another episode of JAM. JAM (Justin and Music) is where I talk about anime and video game soundtracks! If you are interested, my first episode, I talk about the Legend of Zelda. The soundtrack I am sharing today is from a game called Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, one of my favourite titles on the Nintendo DS and has a very enjoyable story and of course, a superb soundtrack. First off, here’s a song called 4 minutes before death!\n\n[audio http://archive.org/download/jam_episode_2/JAM_Episode_2.mp3]\n\nDownload the podcast!\n\nGhost trick is developed and published by Capcom. The, I guess, the lead director is Shu Takumi and the composer is Masakazu Sugimori, a name that may or may not be familiar who some of you may recognize. Both of these wonderful gentlemen are involved in the well known Phoenix Wright series. Amidst the release of Pokemon X and Y, certain games are somewhat overshadowed. The new Phoenix Wright game, called Dual Destiny, came out on the 24th, on the Nintendo e-shop exclusively to the Nintendo 3ds. Being a digital only release, some of you may have missed it. Pretty sure most people would recognize Phoenix Wright, the game where you get to be an attorney. If you are fan of the Phoenix Wright series, you will most definitely enjoy Ghost Trick in my opinion. You can definitely get a Phoenix Wright feel from the gameplay and even soundtrack. I think one of my favourite songs from Ghost Trick really gave me this sensation.\n\nIn Ghost Trick, you play as, essentially a spirit, a ghost. You wake confused, lost, and disoriented. You are to use your ghostly power, appropriately named ghost tricks, to solve puzzles. What this means is really you manipulate objects and things in the environment. The story is compelling and attractive filled with witty characters and well-written dialogues. The animations are superb, that is complimented with a very slick game play. Here is probably my favourite tune from the soundtrack, titled complications:\n\nThere’s always this extra layer of I would say complications with video game music that movies, TV shows, even anime don’t address. Unlike these other forms of media, we are in control of the time and the length of a song, and thus the music needs to repeat in a way that is not annoying. There are similarities between the medias like character themes, or a certain song that plays during a tense battle etc. On that note, let me share you one of my favourite theme of a character called Lynne. She appears very early, and is my most adored character of the game.\n\nI hope that you found the soundtrack slightly interesting. The songs I selected are some of my favourites, and are spoiler free. There are two disks, and many more songs to explore. If the music haven’t grabbed you, perhaps the premise of the game. Ghost Trick is for the Nintendo DS, but it is ported over to the iOS for $9.99 or your regional equivalent.\n\nThat concludes our second session. I promise I’ll do an anime soundtrack >w< but until then, keep listening.\n\n– Justin ~ ─=≡Σ((( つ•̀ω•́)つ"
