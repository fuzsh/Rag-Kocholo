        "text": "Now Available: Calls via Microsoft Teams\n\nUniversity of Miami Telecommunications is now offering Microsoft Teams for calls using your UM phone number.\n\nAnswer Calls on Multiple Devices, from Anywhere\n\nIt is important that you have the ability to stay connected, be reachable, and have access to all your resources from anywhere. To that end, Microsoft Teams can be used on your computer or mobile phone via the Teams appâ€”which makes it easier to manage phone calls, especially if you are working remotely! This means that you do not need to worry about have different calling experiences between home and office for hybrid work environments. Plus, if you miss a phone call, you will receive a notification in your Teams app and voicemails will come in as a recording via your University email.\n\nThis service is available at no additional cost to the University community (this change does not affect the total cost of Telecommunications services).\n\nMaking the Switch to Teams is Easy!\n\nSimply submit an incident request via UService at: uservice.miami.edu.\n\nFor more information, review the following FAQs (or view the PDF version)."
