        "text": "Jake Joyce\n\nHög True Romance EP\n\nDamn, this EP kicks a whole lot of ass. Heavy-hitting, organ-laden rock’n’roll outta New Zealand that would fit right in with all of those Confederacy of Scum bands like HELLSTOMPER, RANCID VAT, and ANTISEEN. Also has a BLUE ÖYSTER CULT vibe, which might not be the type of band you’d want to cop to in an MRR review, but I can never say no to that type of energy. Pretty decent production here, while maintaining that raw edge you’d expect from a band called HÖG. Lovely work.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Shipping Steel\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nWalled City World Pain LP\n\nA combination of late ’90s melodic hardcore like LIFETIME and KID DYNAMITE mashed with vocals that can only be described as blackened crust; as if DARKTHRONE started catering to the No Idea crowd. The vocals are absolutely brutal in the best way possible. Energetic, passionate, and heavy. The music sounds like prog-punk. Blisteringly fast at times, while also showcasing some maximum harmonic riffage. It’s like K.K. Downing joined up with the NONE MORE BLACK crew. This is really great stuff and well worth a spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Post Reality\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nPisse Jammertal / Vetschau 7″\n\nSynth-laced indie jams out of Germany. Really dreamy and crisp, yet rustic and raw. Rhythm section tightly drives each track while the guitar layers an ethereal atmosphere throughout. The A-side kicks things off with a theremin solo, which in itself is impressive as most people don’t have a clue how to use those things. Reminds me of all those twee bands from the early ’00s like the SHOUT OUT LOUDS and CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH. Nothing really groundbreaking here, but it’s a pleasant couple of songs if you dig this type of thing.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Phantom\n\nIssue MRR #495 • August 2024\n\nBody Farm / Dry Socket Body//Socket split LP\n\nCool split here. BODY FARM kicks things off with a powerviolence/youth crew hybrid. Reminds me of BETTER THAN A THOUSAND mixed with SPAZZ. Really love the vocals— more like a yelp than your typical grind-screaming. Feels fresh and unique. My only complaint here is that the drums are way too loud. At first I thought that maybe the drummer was playing out of the pocket way too often, but in reality, they’re just drowning everything else out, which is a real bummer because there are some great guitar parts that are lost in the mix. DRY SOCKET brings everything up to another level. Serious mosh anthems with a singer who screams like a banshee. I’m truly amazed listening to them. Screeching this loud for this long is a superpower. Everything else is tight and groovy; brutal and intense. Real solid outing here form both bands.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel King of the Monsters\n\nIssue MRR #494 • July 2024\n\nSuppression Spiritual Sepsis LP\n\nLoud, fast, and tight as hell. Fantastic bass-driven powerviolence/grind that also has a tinge of ’80s thrash. The vocalist has a super impressive range, spanning deep growls, high-pitched screeches, and a vicious bark that lands directly in the middle of it all, almost like the three bears of hardcore vocalists. Or maybe I’m an idiot and there are several singers on this thing—no idea, they don’t have the personnel listed. Drums are absolutely insane and need to be heard to be believed. In a time when most grindcore bands sound the same, I love hearing something refreshingly unique. Well worth a spin if you dig this kind of stuff.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel To Live A Lie\n\nIssue MRR #494 • July 2024\n\nJunk Guts Get Trashin’ cassette\n\nHigh-energy punk. I originally thought the drums were programmed, but I think there’s a person behind that kit? Someone smarter than me is gonna need to wise me up here. If it’s the latter, then this drummer is one of the tightest I’ve ever heard. The singer does a ton of heavy lifting here; their energy is what carries this album throughout. Otherwise it’s pretty typical cut-and-dry punk rock. Twelve tracks seemed daunting at first, but the album really picks up midway through and ends strong. I’m starting to question whether the drums are real or not again. To quote JUNK GUTS, “sometimes I think my brain is broke.”\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Painters Tapes\n\nIssue MRR #494 • July 2024\n\nGimic We Are Making a New World EP\n\nListen, I hate being hyperbolic, especially when it comes to record reviews. How are you going to take my word at face value if I constantly tell you how so-and-so’s newest album is the greatest thing I’ve heard all year? It’d be like the boy who cries wolf, except with punk music instead of a man-eating beast. Anyway, GIMIC’s newest single is easily the greatest thing I’ve heard all year. I have no other way to describe this other than post-post-punk. It’s like if you took BOW WOW WOW and threw them into a vat of toxic waste. Dance-y enough to groove to, while simultaneously being manic enough to have a complete and total meltdown in the pit. Guitar and bass are clean with a little bit of distorted twang. Very natural and classic. The tone reminds me of the ADVANTAGE while having a math rock edge. Absolutely worth picking up for your summer jams playlist and beyond.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Crew Cuts\n\nIssue MRR #494 • July 2024\n\nCarlxJohnson Hesoyam LP\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas-themed powerviolence straight out of Slovenia. Wow, now that’s a sentence I never thought I’d type. Regardless, this whole slab rips. Brings to mind HEWHOCORRUPTS, MAN IS THE BASTARD, SPAZZ, and the like. There’s also a FUCK ON THE BEACH cover nestled at the end. Fantastic stuff here, and well worth a spin if you’re a fan of the tongue-in-cheek grindcore from the late ’90s/early ’00s.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Rope or Guillotine\n\nIssue MRR #494 • July 2024\n\nSam Snitchy Talking Talking CD\n\nThe label’s Bandcamp page describes this act as “anti-dance,” but I don’t know about that. This sounds pretty dance-oriented to me. The songs are long and repetitive, so it seems like they’re designed as such. I could see this being pretty hot at your local underground goth club. I don’t mean to be the MRR snitch here (no pun intended), but I would barely even consider this punk-adjacent. I guess it has sort of a PiL feel to it, but it sounds more like SHE WANTS REVENGE or something you’d hear on ’00s alternative radio. Not a lot of interesting stuff going on here. It’s dry and a tad boring. Who knows, maybe I’m just in the wrong setting. Might sound better at a dark warehouse party after a couple drinks. In my present state, though, it’s a slog to get through.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Voodoo Rhythm\n\nIssue MRR #494 • July 2024\n\nBeast Killer Dystopian Now/Dystopian Me LP\n\nTwo things that I find impressive about this album: first and foremost, the fact that this is a two-piece. Very curious what octave pedals they’re using here, because it feels incredibly full. Secondly, the drummer is fantastic and tight as hell. Otherwise, this band reminds me of those No Idea acts that sound more like FOO FIGHTERS than HOT WATER MUSIC. The kind of band that you might see open for FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH or something similar. I might just be biased because the record kicks off with one of those “fuck your scene, fuck your style, fuck you” songs, and I really cannot stand that type of attitude. If you like that sort of thing, this LP is up your alley, because it’s constant throughout.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nHans Condor Big Breakfast LP\n\nPure rock’n’roll madness with a little bit of a Southern/stoner rock edge to it. Reminds me of a less doomy SWORD mixed with MOLLY HATCHET, AC/DC, and a dash of latter-era BUSINESS. Production is incredible and everything sounds massive, especially the drums. Soaring harmonic guitars and sweeping bass-walks. This is great stuff right here. The kind of album I’d throw on during a super hot day while I grill out, drink beer, and take a dip in my inflatable pool. White-trash-core in the best way possible. Highly recommended for those who like to party and sweat their asses off deep into the long, summer evenings.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nHood Rats Crime, Hysteria & Useless Information LP\n\nHardcore out of Montreal with a cowpunk twang. No shit. Catchy as hell with an attitude that matches. Reminiscent of the golden era of GG ALLIN, but much faster with a much better lead guitarist. Fantastic stuff here, and well worth a spin. I’ve played through this like five times in one sitting.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Bachelor / Dirt Cult\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nLife Has Soured / Squelch Chamber split cassette\n\nI absolutely adore SQUELCH CHAMBER, so seeing this come through my to-do pile was an exciting moment for me. Their full-length Eater of Self was one of my favorite albums last year, and their side of this split continues on with the punishing sludge metal for which they’ve come to be known. Very reminiscent of KILSLUG and other Larry Lifeless projects. It’s like MELVINS if they were even more unhinged. Great stuff as always on their part. LIFE HAS SOURED also plays slow and low noisy doom, but almost sounds tame in comparison to SQUELCH CHAMBER. Good stuff, though. A split that’s well worth picking up if you can find it!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Bastard Premonition\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nRitual Warfare Poison Death Noise EP\n\nYou know, there really isn’t anything that stands out to me about this EP. It’s pretty cut-and-dry blackened death metal with some decent riffage, pummeling drums, and the typical themes ranging from gore to anti-religious iconography. However, it’s charming in its own way. There’s a palatable sort of passion that oozes from it. This is the kind of band I’d have a really great time seeing live, but probably wouldn’t listen to much in any other setting. I think it’s because there’s absolutely no low end on this recording. If there’s a bass player, then they absolutely buried them in the mix. Some metalheads dig that kind of thing, though. If that’s up your alley then this is worth a spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Sewercide\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nStrikeslip Stuporstar / Terribly Tangled Up 7″\n\nThis is a really lovely single. Tongue-in-cheek power pop that brings to mind NATURAL CHILD, SPACE PHLEGM, and even a little bit of early ROLLING STONES. Incredible production here as well. Everything sounds clean and natural. I love hearing poppy music like this that isn’t compressed to all hell. This might not enter the rotation of the typical MRR reader, but I’m smitten by it. For fans of Matador Records and people who think indie music peaked in the mid-’90s.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Spacecase\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nBirth Ritual Hell CD\n\nFantastic three-song EP from Japan’s own BIRTH RITUAL. Thrash punk teetering way more towards the trash end of the spectrum. This album is absolutely brutal straight out of the gate. No frills or unnecessary bullshit. Just pure intensity and raw power. A true throwback to the classic years of thrash and metal in general. For fans of NUCLEAR ASSAULT, MESSIAH, HOLY TERROR, etc.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Black Konflik\n\nIssue MRR #493 • June 2024\n\nThe Darbs She’s a Dungeon Master Now LP\n\nCatchy and fun pop punk out of the Malibu of the Midwest: Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Maybe I’m being subconsciously influenced by the dairyland association, but these guys remind me a lot of BORIS THE SPRINKLER. Fantastic vocals, especially the harmonies. This is the kind of band I’d love to see live at some desolate Wisco bar late on a Friday night, with a lukewarm bottle of PBR and a matching neon sign hung behind the stage (in this fantasy, the stage is just a spot on the dining room floor where they cleared away the extra tables and chairs). Great album here. In my opinion, Wisconsin’s punk scenes in general are crucially underrated and they need to be boosted on everyone’s radar.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Plaza Eight\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nKirkby Kiss / Medicinal split EP\n\nGreat split EP here. MEDICINAL sounds like a modern rendition of the lost wave of emo that no one really ever talks about, which featured bands like CAR VS DRIVER and BOYS LIFE. Noodly riffs in a minor key with a vocalist who appears to have worshiped at the altar of Guy Picciotto. This is what I think about when someone references post-hardcore. KIRKBY KISS plays a more stringent version of hardcore, but their singer really stood out to me. Very raw and real, sounding like they blew their voice out before they even got into the studio. My only complaint is that it’s over too soon!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Council / Jean Scene\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nCornish Game Hen Death Process CD\n\nImagine my surprise when a dance punk band named CORNISH GAME HEN wasn’t from across the pond, but instead from Houston, Texas of all places. Sounding like ADAM ANT, the B-52’S, and THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS all smashed together, it is a daunting task to get through this fourteen-track album. Very repetitive and drab, which is interesting to me because it sounds like each member takes up vocal duties throughout this disc. You’d think this would spice things up a bit, but it still just all sounds the same. I do need to point out that out of all the tracks, the vocal performance on “Poster Punk” really stands out, as it showcases an impressive run during the chorus. The synth work is great, don’t get me wrong. However, it does a metric ton of the heavy lifting and doesn’t fill the gaps left wanting by the rest of the band. CORNISH GAME HEN ultimately chose quantity over quality here. Death Process may have worked better as an EP with a handful of their best songs from this session.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nAccidente / Nightwatchers split LP\n\nGenuine question here: are these the same bands with different singers? They both sound identical sans vocals, and even then, they both sing with the same inflection. It almost seems like these folks sat around and wrote these songs together. I guess that would be pretty impressive in itself, seeing as one band is from France and the other from Spain. I’ve whined about this in the past, so forgive me if you’ve heard this tirade before, but split albums are really only interesting when you can clearly distinguish the bands from each other. There were times listening through to this album that I didn’t realize it had hopped over into the second half until the singer appeared. Regardless, both bands are quite talented and have obviously taken great care with their songwriting. The production is beautiful, and each side sounds absolutely massive and sweeping. However, there’s nothing really groundbreaking here. I’ve listened through a handful of times and very little has really stuck with me. Closest I can come to a comparison is SUGAR STEMS and MARKED MEN, but they don’t replicate the same type of catchy hooks. Interesting to note that while both bands are from Europe, this LP was mastered at the legendary Sonic Iguana Studios in Indiana.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Stonehenge\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nZondar The Chain / The Light Burns 7″\n\nRob from BUCK BILOXI brings us some more of that DEVO-inspired egg-punk that’s everywhere these days. Both songs have movie samples that seem to last longer than the actual music itself. This single is fine. This drum-machine-laden bedroom punk genre has been done to death, and you really gotta come out swinging if you want to contribute something interesting, especially on a label like Goodbye Boozy, which has released a ton of heavy hitters in this style over the last couple of years.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Goodbye Boozy\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nPaprika Let’s Kill Punk LP\n\nReally solid hardcore record here. Reminds me of a modern MDC, especially with the vocalist who has the same poise and energy as Dave Dictor. Similar candor as well; the lyrics are blunt and straight to the point, as heard in tracks like “Polite Society” and “Let’s Kill Punk.” Brilliant production, too. Everything sounds loud, crisp, and massive. There’s an echo effect on the vocals that I would usually not be a fan of, but it works well on these recordings. It sounds like the singer is shouting into the abyss and the abyss is shouting back. I am a huge fan of the drums here. Drummer hits hard as hell, and it really helps foster the chaos that is PAPRIKA. A+ effort here, and well worth a spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Iron Lung\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nVirvon Varvon Four Bars of Hate cassette\n\nThis band fucking rocks and this band fucking rolls, baby. Great lo-fi garage rock that sounds like if the STOOGES started writing music with NOBUNNY and nosier acts like GOD IS MY CO-PILOT. Raw and catchy with an attitude to match. I absolutely love how the vocals are recorded. Slightly blown-out, but not enough that they’re obnoxious or grating. Drummer is the unsung hero here. They’re tucked in the back, but they trudge along and keep the slightest bit of order to this madness. Fantastic work here, and well worth a play!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Girlsville\n\nIssue MRR #492 • May 2024\n\nBrody and the Grodies Brody and the Grodies Went to the Bar So This Half-Finished Record is All That You Ge CD\n\nOne of those bands that purposely tries to sound like shit and is proud of it, except BRODY AND THE GRODIES don’t really sound like shit. They’re just kind of boring and corny. Seven drum-machine-driven punk songs with topics ranging from beer, coffee, Bigfoot, beer, and meat. Wait, did I mention beer? The album is topped off with a five-minute sketch that sounds like it came from an old ICP demo tape. You can tell they had fun recording this, which is really the best thing I can say about this whole ordeal. You’d be better off listening to FOSSIL FUEL or one of the other hundreds of FOOD FORTUNATA-related projects out there.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nToxic Thrust I Love You / Cenotaph 7″\n\nI love this 45. That’s a pretty fitting reaction if I do say so myself. Two fun little rock’n’roll ditties that sound as if KING KHAN started writing music for the DR. DEMENTO show. There’s a surf/psych-rock element to them as well which gives these tracks a real summer jam kind of vibe. Not much to show in the lyrics department, but sometimes all you need to do is let someone know you love them.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nFailure Face Junction Pizza EP\n\nI am a huge sucker for live punk albums, and this little slab here is a great example as to why. Pure, raw, rock’n’roll chaos, recorded in April of 1995. FAILURE FACE plays a hybrid type of hardcore powerviolence that reminds me a lot of bands like KUNG-FU RICK and AUTHORITY ABUSE. I absolutely adore the crowd interaction throughout the record. It starts off pretty enthusiastic and it begins to dwindle as the show progresses. Very relatable, very endearing, and very real. We’ve all been there! Comes with a neat little two-page autobiographical write-up of the band and the record itself. These recordings were initially ripped from a VHS! Incredible! They sound great. Fantastic 7” here, especially if you’re someone like me who really loves the history of obscure punk scenes of the past.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Roach and Roll\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nPi$$er Too Busy Eating Gruel LP\n\nWow, I didn’t know what to expect here, and this album completely blew me away. What starts off like a THROBBING GRISTLE record soon kicks into what I can only describe as ROCKET FROM THE CRYPT on steroids. PI$$ER doesn’t remain married to that sound, and they bounce between early industrial, DEVO-like new wave, and a surprising amount of soundscapes for a punk LP. The production flows together beautifully, and there is nary a second of dead air. A very well-crafted concept album that never once feels boring or hastily manufactured. Featuring members of DOOM and SORE THROAT, if you can believe it. Fantastic stuff here, and well worth tracking down!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Scene Report\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nBetter Plastic Mint Condition EP\n\nFirst and foremost, I am a big fan of this album art. Throw a couple skulls on your record cover and it’s an automatic spin from me. Artsy powerviolence out of Brooklyn—shocking, I know. Super groovy, and sounds similar to FUCKED UP’s Glass Boys (Slow Version). Has a Steve Albini edge to it, and reminds me a lot of heavier JESUS LIZARD/LAUGHING HYENAS. What really sets this 7′ apart from their peers is the guitar and bass work. Pummeling at times, but also noisy and dissonant. Treble-heavy bass sounds like it’s come straight from the ’90s, giving off a classic post-hardcore vibe. Guitar is noisy as all hell and reminds me of if WOLF EYES collaborated with Greg Ginn (at least during his late ’80s era when he tried playing jazz guitar). A fun little romp and well worth a spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nUltras Ultras II EP\n\nVery tight fastcore here. The drums and guitar both sound great, but I wish the vocals and the bass were a little louder in the mix. It lacks any low-end and comes off sounding a lot less heavy than it should. The vocals sound like they’re being run through an old distortion pedal and have very little power behind them. They’re tucked behind everything else in the mix and are drowned out by the rest of the band. This is fine for what it is, but I guess I just expected more from a band featuring members of WORLD PEACE.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Convulse\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nP.S Tensión cassette\n\nFantastic synth punk from Ecuador. Almost like a South American ATOM AND HIS PACKAGE/I HATE YOU WHEN YOU’RE PREGNANT, which scores huge points with me. Vocals are powerful and energetic. I wish I was smart enough to understand what he was saying, but I barely eked by in my Spanish classes in college. According to the liner notes, this was made with an authentic analog synthesizer. None of those bland, overused GarageBand samples here! Pure electronic madness, and well worth picking up if you’re looking to diversify your cassette collection.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel XTRO\n\nIssue MRR #491 • April 2024\n\nImpermanence 9-Song Offering cassette\n\nPowerviolence out of Portland teetering more on the trashier side. Hard for me to not compare these guys to MAN IS THE BASTARD seeing as they’re a bass/drums combo, but that’s what I’ll have to default to here because…well, they sound a lot like them! They also give off a SPAZZ/CAPTAIN THREE LEG vibe, as their riffs are catchy and melodic. For just being two people, they sound massive and super heavy. Drums sound natural, which is always an A+ in a genre that resorts to triggers.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nRejoice All of Heaven’s Luck LP\n\nThe first new release from this Columbus quintet in about two years, REJOICE reminds me a bit of what NEGATIVE APPROACH would sound like if its members were born within the last quarter-century, mainly because the singer sounds like a modern-age John Brannon. Otherwise, this a pretty groovy record, and teeters more on the metal side of the hardcore see-saw than punk. I don’t know how else to explain this, but this record is chock-full of what I’ll call “spooky” guitar leads that you often hear in black metal. Actually, this whole album has a blackened edge to it. It would probably sound like it came directly from the Arctic Circle if the recording quality wasn’t so top-notch.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Delayed Gratification\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nBedspin Liminal Spaces LP\n\nAs a fellow Illinoisan, I will always give props to bands from not-Chicago, especially if they’re from the very bottom of the state. I hear Carbondale has a great punk scene, though. Anyways, lovely pop punk outing here. A very nostalgic listen for me. Reminded me of the first time I heard Fat Music for Fat People, which forever changed my life. Catchy vocals, noodly guitar leads, treble-heavy bass runs, and the occasional drive-by ska riff! Feels like the early ’00s for me, makes me want to dig out my old skateboard and pretend like I know what I’m doing again. Great stuff here. For fans of early Fat Wreck and Epitaph.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Freeloader\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nSmall Steps Breakthroughs/Breakdowns LP\n\nCookie-cutter pop punk out of Kentucky. Reminiscent of DIGGER, GAMEFACE, and early ATARIS, but lacking a lot of the charm those bands had. Very lukewarm lyrics that range from the utmost corny (“I’ll learn to take long walks with you / As I forever stand beside you,” as heard in “Rome is Where the Heart Is”), to straight-up tired cliches (“I was born at night / But not born last night” from the track “Three Button Sweater”). The lyrics are probably what kills the band the most for me. The music is actually pretty decent. Catchy at points, sentimental at others. Production is great and everything is very clean and mixed well. But with songs like the ironically titled “Skip This Song,” in which the singer laments about playing a poorly attended show in a wishy-washy scene, these guys make it hard to like them. We’ve all played bad shows, man. It happens. This just comes off sounding more entitled than anything. SMALL STEPS could be a great band if they took a little more time on the writing process. I look forward to seeing what they come up with down the road.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Blind Rage\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nR.M.F.C. Club Hits LP\n\nYet another top-notch band out of Australia. I have said it over and over again at this point, but they really know how to rock in the Southern Hemisphere. Lovely dance punk that reminds me quite a bit of SHOPPING, CHERRY CHEEKS, and all things ADAM ANT. I am smitten with the guitar tones here. Very natural, but unique and ethereal. Lots of care and patience went into this recording and it really shows. Great work here, and well worth a spin!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Anti-Fade / Urge\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nDisinterred Corpse Burial cassette\n\nHoly shit, this is chaotic as all hell. I can’t lie, the moment I saw the length of each song, I knew I was going to love this. Is that a bias? I guess it could be, but I can’t deny my adoration for sub-minute songs. Pure grind insanity here. I’m curious as to how the drums were recorded. It sounds like they were tracked directly to a TASCAM through a karaoke mic. They are blown the fuck out and it really adds to the madness. This sounds like the most organized mess of music I’ve ever heard in my life. It really distances them from other modern grind which sounds a bit too over-produced and clean for my tastes. I did initially scoff a bit at the cover art’s “Extremely Graphic Content” warning, but in hindsight, if any album is deemed worthy of that title, it’s this one. Wonderful stuff here, straddling the line between noisecore and grindcore.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Crippled Sound\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nTodestrieb DEsperAte THanatology CD\n\nListen, I’m gonna be honest here. If you’re someone who likes conventionally “good” hardcore—polished, on tempo, and in tune—then you’re not going to like this album. However, if you’re someone like me who likes the sloppiest of the slop, who loves musicians that sound like they’re attempting their instruments for the first or second time, then this record is for you. TODESTRIEB may not have the technical chops of their crust peers, but to say they don’t have the correct attitude is straight-up false. These guys just go for it and kill it. I love seeing this kind of confidence in punk. Less solos and more noise is what I say! Big fan of this album.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Black Konflik\n\nIssue MRR #490 • March 2024\n\nLone Creep 100 Beers of Music: The First Year CD\n\nSelf-proclaimed AARP hardcore! Thrash-inspired one-man punk act out of the Southwest. Biting satire, not only aimed at nationwide issues seen in songs like “Get Shot” and “Corporate Job,” but also on a personal level with tracks like “My Neighbor is a Dickhead” and “I’m in a Foul Mood.” I can definitely relate with those last two. Charisma here is infectious, and his vocals are absolutely built for punk music. Very strong and in-your-face! Lots of attitude and confidence. You can tell this dude just loves having fun, making music, and cultivating his scene at large. I did a little research here and his social media presence is nothing but PMA. Love to see it. The kind of guy you’d love to get a beer with. Well worth a spin, especially for all you old fogies!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Hey Fuck You\n\nIssue MRR #489 • February 2024\n\nLazer Bullet Spirit Suck Shit EP\n\nFastcore punk rock outta the Pacific Northwest. Really brilliant work here. The guitar has a little bit of a twang with a natural distortion to it, which gives it a crisper and cleaner sound while maintaining the hardcore energy. Everything is just so near-impossibly fast and never wavers. Super intense energy and incredibly tight. Vocals sound great; high-registered yelps drenched in reverb that really gives it that rock’n’roll edge. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention just how great the drums sound, spot-on and massive. This is a great EP all around. I’d even consider it a very early contender for future “Records of the Year” lists.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Black Water\n\nIssue MRR #489 • February 2024\n\nVariation 8 EP\n\nAs soon as this EP kicked off, I knew I was going to love it. Fast, sloppy, garbage-grind. Lo-fi and gritty recording makes it sound like it was unearthed from a ’90s time capsule. The treble on the guitars and bass is turned up way high and gives off a classic black metal vibe. Nothing beats the pukey vocals for me. So many modern grind bands hire vocal coaches to “learn” how to scream. What’s up with that? This dude here just goes for it and it sounds a million times better than someone who had to pay to sound brutal. They’re probably a real joy to see live. Really great stuff here, and well worth a pick-up if you’re into this type of trash-grind.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #489 • February 2024\n\nAttack Total Total Attack EP\n\nFun punk/pub rock out of Sweden, which is surprising because this sounds a lot like the bands that came from the Chicagoland area in the mid-to-late ’90s—very similar to WALKER and WINEPRESS and all of the other Harmless Records groups, probably because each song has these simple little guitar licks that are catchy as hell. Singer reminds me a lot of Joey Ramone mixed with Frankie Stubbs of LEATHERFACE fame. The kind of band I’d love to come across on a pub crawl. Big fan of this EP, and think it’s well worth a spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Common People\n\nIssue MRR #489 • February 2024\n\nTerre Neuve Condamné EP\n\nReally great modern Oi! out of Belgium that incorporates a lot of hardcore elements as well. Solid guitar gallops and throaty, barking vocals. Speaking of guitar, the utilization of the barre chords adds a whole level of additional heaviness on top of the melodic leads that give off a bit of a pop sensibility. Catchy but brutal. Everything is played tight, and the drums and bass are interlocked real well. I love the bass tone here, it sounds like the strings are melting off the neck with each stroke. Really amplifies the energy as a whole. These dudes just went all out. Lovely work here.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Mendeku Diskak\n\nIssue MRR #489 • February 2024\n\nSimp Society Idolizing Meaningless Products cassette\n\nRaw and fast hardcore out of the Pacific Northwest. Seems to be just two dudes writing and recording everything on their own, which is always very impressive to me. Has a real powerviolence feel, and reminds me quite a bit of late-era CHARLES BRONSON and ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN. My only complaint is that this EP is extremely short. I use the term “blink and it’s over” often enough, but that is literally the case here. As soon as the album gets moving, it’s done. I guess that just leaves us wanting more. If that was their intention, then it worked! Now I’m simping for SIMP.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #488 • January 2024\n\nStrangely Addictive Animal CD\n\nYour typical run-of-the-mill garage rock here. There’s some decent stuff on this disc, but a lot of it comes off like JACK WHITE trying to ape the NEW YORK DOLLS and RICHARD HELL. I usually love me a good drum machine, but the lack of real drums hinders this album quite a bit. It’s way too clean, robotic, and precise. This is an odd complaint, but this album is a tad too long, almost like being forced to eat an entire bucket of ice cream. The first four scoops are great, but halfway through, you’re choking it down and wondering why you have so much ice cream in the first place—very ironic considering the band name. Vocals are great, snotty and charismatic, and carry most of the album. Lots of potential for STRANGELY ADDICTIVE, I think they just need to adjust their game plan a bit.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Keep-a-Knockin’\n\nIssue MRR #488 • January 2024\n\nAbanglupa Of Rats and Swine LP\n\nBrutal powerviolence out of the Philippines. Teeters more on the metal side than the punk side of PV. Super heavy, but slow and low at points. Has a doom metal element, but also reminds me of the early era of nu-metal when it was still experimental and not the cornball mallcore it later became. Lots of dissonant guitars and deeply heavy barre chords. I love non-American grindcore because they think more outside the box than their Western counterparts—always comes off more authentic and less fashionable. Really beautiful production, everything is crisp and full. Vocals are full-throttle and front and center. Everything sounds great here; super tight and groovy as hell. Well worth a spin if you’re into this type of thing.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel 9 Lies\n\nIssue MRR #488 • January 2024\n\nKageneko / Merked split cassette\n\nGreat split between two grindcore bands from the West Coast. Both sound pretty similar, but MERKED has real drums and KAGENEKO is a classic cybergrind band with the drum machine playing impossibly fast beats. Reminds of something you’d find in some random distro in the early ’00s. Nothing groundbreaking here, but it’s fun as hell.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Enemy of the Goat / Jib\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nKarkaisu Tulenarkaa EP\n\nHardcore crust out of Finland. Very thrashy at points. In fact, this feels more like a metal album than a punk one. Not that I’m complaining, I’m a big fan of this release. It was almost a little shocking to see this was recorded within the last year—it honestly feels like this was unearthed from the early ’80s. Very tight recording, and the guitars are absolute fire. Blistering fast galloping that never wavers. Fantastic stuff, and the album art is the icing on the cake. For fans of early METALLICA and ZNOWHITE.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Agnostic About Violence / Colilla / Creative Class War / Half Bear Half Cat / Ketunkolo Tuotanto / Puukotus-levyt / Skategoat Productions / Vapaa Paiva\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nD.R.L.N. Broadcasting cassette\n\nIncredible album—has a classic DC vibe and sounds a lot like a more sinister FUGAZI. I’m sure they get that a lot. Lots of energy, but also some slow, low, and sludgy moments. Very cool mathy parts; I love how the drummer utilizes the hi-hat as a stopgap in between certain measures. It helps foster a strong dynamic that keeps the orderly chaos moving. The singer is a modern-day Guy Picciotto, which I’d argue is hard to pull off in earnest. It doesn’t come off as cosplay. Very authentic and raw. Over the years, the genre of post-hardcore has evolved away from its original definition, but I think this album brings the style back to its roots. Well worth a spin if you’re into stuff like QUICKSAND, RIVAL SCHOOLS, and Q AND NOT U.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Noose Knot\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nJonas Patterns of Dominance 12″\n\nA re-release of their 1996 demo recording, pressed from the original masters. Classic grindcore from a time before bands started using drum triggers and studio trickery. Vocals sound authentic and real, unlike a lot of today’s grind acts who run their singer through a whole mess of effects and processing. I’m starting to come off like some bitter old man, but it’s refreshing to hear something that isn’t attempting to be a polished product. Noisy, raw, and fast as hell. Blink and it’s over, just the way it should be.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Supreme Echo\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nThe Losers / Rote split EP\n\nReally great split between two bands out of California, albeit in different directions. Makes sense, as both of these groups sound like they’ve come straight from the heyday of Gilman. ROTE brings us some classic melodic hardcore while teetering on the edge of crust. They remind me a bit of LEFTÖVER CRACK with less ska and better vocals. Very authentic, and a lot of fun. If I can be honest, I didn’t expect much from a band called the LOSERS in this day and age, especially since they included a cover of “Rockin’ in the Free World.” But my mind was quickly changed during their first track “The Big Question,” owing to their very charismatic frontman and blistering guitar leads. Classic punk rock right here with a bit of an Oi! tinge. Hey, even the NEIL YOUNG tribute is pretty cool!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Tenant\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nVintage Crop Springtime / Mercenary 7″\n\nMore fantastic music out of Australia. Poppy post-punk with a little bit of slowcore thrown in. Chill and laid back. The singer sounds a bit like a less energetic Fred Schenider, which might seem like a critique, but it works very well for VINTAGE CROP’s styling. Great use of the synthesizer during “Springtime,” and especially the horns (or what I think are horns) at the end. Fits right into the pocket and gives the track a floral accent. “Mercenary” reminds me a lot of ’90s indie groups like SUPERCHUNK. Very catchy with upbeat guitars that don’t overlap the vocals. Great composition for both tracks. Lots going on, but it doesn’t sound messy or overthought. I initially wondered why this wasn’t released during the spring, only to remember it’s currently spring in Australia. The Earth is crazy, huh!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Anti-Fade / Upset the Rhythm\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nLengua Salvaje 2023 Demo cassette\n\nRaw, crusty hardcore three-piece out of Chicago. They’re another one of those trios that does a great job filling in the gaps, sounding absolutely massive with just a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist. Reminds me of all the early grind bands who came to fruition without a bass player but still sounded heavy as hell, much like a more rustic PIG DESTROYER. Vocals are blood-curdling like a banshee in the night. Absolutely intense and unwavering. The lo-fi production pairs perfectly here. I love how the drums come off in the mix—tucked a tad into the back, but when they come alive they’re pummeling. Top-notch stuff here.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Open Palm\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nStiff Meds Tales From the Slab LP\n\nI wanted to like this album. I really, really did. I love the album art, and I’m a sucker for any hardcore band with sub-minute-long songs. Before I start with my griping, I will say that the drummer on this album is incredible. Fast and tight as hell. I had to do a little research to make sure it wasn’t a drum machine—I really wish they were louder in the mix. There is absolutely no low end on this album. Every song sounds weak. The bass and drums are tinny, and the treble is turned up way too loud. In fact, the bass is so low in the mix that I sometimes can’t even tell that it’s there. The singer is just not built for this style of music. They drench his vocals in some weird compression effect that, again, eliminates the low end and makes it sound way too airy. I assume it’s supposed to make his voice raw and grittier, but it only makes it sound like he’s trying to clear his throat constantly. During “Torn Out,” the tenth track on the album, there’s a portion where he speaks the lyrics, and it honestly sounds better than his attempt to do the tough-guy vocals. Very paint-by-numbers hardcore here. Nothing feels fresh, and they really over do it with the samples, placing them directly in the middle of the song where it causes a giant clusterfuck, sounding sloppy and disjointed. STIFF MEDS has the talent. I just don’t know if it’s conducive to this type of songwriting.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Quality Control HQ\n\nIssue MRR #487 • December 2023\n\nGoblin Brain Goblin Brain CD\n\nDamn, this EP is brutal. This is some classic straightedge hardcore. Feels like I picked this up from the back of some distro catalog in the late ’90s. If you ever needed a proper example of fastcore, this is it right here. Drums are absolutely incredible on this recording, easily the most intense part—loud, in-your-face, and tight as hell. Very reminiscent of early WEEKEND NACHOS, and with breakdowns much like DAMNATION A.D. Blink and it’s over, but that’s the way hardcore should be!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #486 • November 2023\n\nThe Gents Responsible Dog Walker EP\n\nFun stuff here out of Germany—melodic garage punk with an Oi! twist. Reminds me a little bit of early SNUFF mixed with BLITZ. Very catchy hooks. Each song sounds slightly different than the last, and it leads to a very compelling EP. The dual vocals really help keep everything fresh and they create a great dynamic. These guys apparently have day jobs as elementary school teachers and practice each night in the school’s music room. Nothing more rock’n’roll than that. Well worth a spin. Very tight and energetic.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Creepy Kid\n\nIssue MRR #486 • November 2023\n\nPiss Shivers Piss Shivers LP\n\nYet another fantastic import out of Australia. At times, this album sounds like a modern BUZZCOCKS paired with barking vocals akin to Rick Froberg of HOT SNAKES fame. Guitar has a very natural distortion and doesn’t sound like it’s being processed through a bunch of different pedals. I was gobsmacked to learn this band is a two-piece. They really know how to get the most out of their limitations because these recordings sound absolutely massive. I’m aware that there’s studio trickery to fill the gaps, but the overdubbing sounds to be at an absolute minimum. This is rock’n’roll.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Gimmie\n\nIssue MRR #486 • November 2023\n\nAgathocles / Malicious Algorithm split EP\n\nI know that I should know better by this point, but every time I see a new AGATHOCLES split, my first reaction is always “wow, another one?”— I’m sure I’m not alone here. And usually, right before I throw it on, I always assume that this EP will be the one where they start phoning it in; that their side of the slab will be a bit of a bore or lazy or unimaginative or what have you. However, once the record starts spinning, I wonder why I ever doubted them at all. AGATHOCLES always delivers, and such is the case with their new split with California’s MALICIOUS ALGORITHM. AGATHOCLES strays a bit from their classic mincecore styling, opting for a slower, sludgier sound. MALICIOUS ALGORITHM plays brutal, lightning-fast powerviolence, but also with a classic grind influence as the guitars and blastbeats pair exceptionally well together. Both bands sound different enough to make this a quality split.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel 18 is 9 / Animate / No Time\n\nIssue MRR #486 • November 2023\n\nMace Head / Slavery split 7″\n\nFun split out of the Czech Republic. SLAVERY really teeters on the edge of classic power metal, but is brought back from the brink once the vocals kick in, sounding more like DOOM with throatier vocals. MACE HEAD’s side of the split is much more crusty and lo-fi. Very reminiscent of AUS-ROTTEN with a phaser pedal and a soft spot for industrial music. Vocals are intense as hell, and I’m curious as to how they recorded them. A tad sloppy at times, but I think that’s what makes this a great split. No ego. Raw power. Well worth a spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Jitka 666 / Phobia / Silesian Blood / Svarta\n\nIssue MRR #486 • November 2023\n\nContinued Without a Finding CWAF LP\n\nGrind-sludge out of Massachusetts. Originally recorded in 2007, this album was recently mixed and mastered for a 2023 release. Could have fooled me, so kudos to the engineering team—these recordings sound very modern. Took me a couple listens to really sink my teeth into this one. Sure, there are your typical grindcore elements, like the insane chops of drummer John Gillis (of late-era AXCX/YOU’RE FIRED infamy). But the riffs are borderline nu-metal, and sound like songs PANTERA left on the cutting room floor. The vocals are layered with so many effects that they sound as if they recorded them from a payphone and then drenched them in an astounding amount of reverb and echo. However, tracks like “Just Another Day in the Orifice” and “Copulate” have more of a crushing, grindy/doomy edge and really make me rethink how I view this record. All in all, there are a couple stand-out tracks here, but CWAF opted for more quantity over quality.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel 1635 / Gonzosonic\n\nIssue MRR #485 • October 2023\n\nS.H.I.T. Demo 2023 cassette\n\nI love modern D-beat that doesn’t default to sounding exactly like the oldies. Great demo here from Toronto’s S.H.I.T. Brutal and fresh, but there’s something buried in here that makes these songs sound like they’ve come straight from the ’80s. I think it’s the vocals, as they sound classic and familiar, yet timeless and unique. A real crusty paradox! Lots of hardcore elements as well, with the guitars almost having a youth-crew-esque edge. Very full recording, and surprisingly heavy at points. Two originals and a couple covers from CRUCIFIX and BLITZ, respectively. Their Bandcamp URL is brilliant.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Homie Shit Magazine\n\nIssue MRR #485 • October 2023\n\nThe Shakewells Who the Hell Are? cassette\n\nSurfy garage rock that reminds me of the VENTURES, the MUMMIES, and MAN OR ASTRO-MAN? all rolled into one. Very impressive musicianship here; very tight and never cluttered. I think it can be a challenge when you throw an organ player into the mix, but the SHAKEWELLS do a good job of not playing over each other. Otherwise, this is your typical spooky-adjacent rock’n’roll release. Not bad by any means, but nothing really groundbreaking. If you enjoy the genre, you’ll probably love this. A perfect soundtrack for the Halloween season.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Knuckles on Stun\n\nIssue MRR #485 • October 2023\n\nThe Steves In a Room EP reissue\n\nMy first thought listening to this EP was “Wow, every band really does want to be DEVO these days.” Then I noticed this was a reissue from 1980, and thought “Wow, this band wanted to be DEVO during DEVO’s peak.” Which, honestly—bold move, STEVES. I can’t fault you for trying. But I also can’t help but laugh at the press release, claiming the STEVES sounded too unruly to be considered for radio play. Freedom of Choice literally came out that same year! Maybe it’s all tongue-in-cheek and I can’t pick up sarcasm the way I used to. I will say though, it was daring of them to put a disco track on the B-side in 1980. Now that’s bold.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Iron Lung\n\nIssue MRR #485 • October 2023\n\nSmirk Polyrhythmic Ticks EP\n\nMore drum machine egg-punk, which seems to be completely dominating underground rock’n’roll at the moment. I loved it when all those Total Punk bands did it, but I think it’s time for us to move on to a different style. They’re all starting to sound exactly the same. Most of this EP is very drab and dry, and is void of anything catchy. “Bored By Everything” is the standout track, and is a much more energetic and engaging anthem than the other three. I’m all about bands experimenting, but “Bored By Everything” sounds much more like their prior work and I think it suits them better. Coincidentally enough, I’m just bored with this EP.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Under the Gun\n\nIssue MRR #485 • October 2023\n\nPowerplant Grass EP\n\nDark, melodic post-punk out of London. Has a similar feel to the dozens of other drum-machine-laden bands that are everywhere these days, but POWERPLANT comes off more nuanced than their electronic peers. Less DEVO, and more SMITHS meets ALIEN SEX FIEND. I might catch some flak for this, but they also remind me of a rustic THOMAS DOLBY. That’s supposed to be a compliment, but I understand if it’s not taken as such! I need to give POWERPLANT their due for using sleigh bells throughout “Walk Around (Hang My Head).” You don’t hear enough of those in punk these days. No fooling!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Static Shock\n\nIssue MRR #485 • October 2023\n\nThe Dissidents / Vitrolic Response split EP\n\nCool split between bands from the US and England. The DISSIDENTS feature MISCHIEF BREW’S former bass player on drums and play your typical sloppy punk rock, but the vocalist is so intense and charismatic that it brings everything together. A true pissed-off poet, and the kind of singer I’m sure a lot of bands wished they had. Seriously great stuff. VITRIOLIC REPONSE plays classic UK hardcore and sound like a modern GBH with barking vocals, but also incorporates doom/black metal elements, like slowing the tempo and using sinister arpeggios. Both bands sound different enough that it creates a great dynamic.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel 45 cpm / Death Trap / Ryvvolte / Urinal Vinyl / Wild Mutation\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nMass Separation Semarak Api CD\n\nGrind-crust out of Malaysia. Sloppy and noisy as hell, the way the genre is meant to be. As is with a lot of these types of releases, the drums immediately stick out to me, as they are blisteringly fast and never waver. Guitars have a very powerviolence/metalcore tint to them. Lots of crunchy breakdowns, squealing pinch harmonics, and dissonant chords. Vocals have a ton of nuance and range from deep-throat growls to banshee-like screams. All in all, a decent release if you’re a fan of the genre.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Black Konflik\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nMorreadoras Morreadoras y Ya Está cassette\n\nFlexidiscos has been releasing some of the best synth punk out of Europe over the last year or so, and they continue the trend with London’s MORREADORAS. This sounds like Halloween punk to me. Like BOBBY “BORIS” PICKETT with one hell of an edge. I mean this in the best way possible, and it is in no way a slight. As with most of the Flexidiscos releases, the synth drives everything, and it is hauntingly chilling. The fun kind, not the scary kind, like the soundtrack for an ’80s Scooby Doo special. Again, not a slight. That’s a compliment! Top-notch stuff here, and just in time for the spooky season.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Flexidiscos\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nCryptic Void Physwar//Psywar LP\n\nBrutal death-doom out of Texas. Drums are absolutely incredible here and are all over the place. Recording quality is conducive to this, picking up every little thing the drummer does—almost mind-blowing at points, and really what caught my attention the most. Guitars are heavy as all hell, slow and low at points, and manically fast at others. Vocals are in the traditional death metal styling here, but sound great. All in all, a fantastic record for those who are fans of the genre.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Regurgitated Semen / To Live A Lie\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nSilicon Heartbeat MT0001 cassette\n\nFantastic Great Lakes beach punk from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Real surfy vibes with a hint of horror punk, like a poppy MUMMIES or a rustic EPOXIES/SOVIETTES with deeper, growling vocals. The synth completely drives this band and it’s the immediate focal point of this whole EP. The guitar and bass have tones that mesh insanely well and are locked in sync throughout. Lovely slab here, and pretty solid autumn jams if I may say so myself.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nKiht Fihsto Kiht Fihsto cassette\n\nIt took me a couple listens to appreciate this EP. KIHIT FIHSTO melds a bunch of different styles ranging from D-beat to metalcore to skate punk to Kill ‘Em All-era METALLICA. Sometimes when a band draws from different influences, it comes off as more disjointed than it does eclectic. That’s the impression I got on my first run-through here. But the more I re-listened to this album, the more it all clicked into place. They’re just a group of folks looking to have a good time playing rock’n’roll, and that’s all that really matters. To hell with an aesthetic! The guitars sound huge on this and are impressively tight, even if they are just power chords. As a fellow Illinoisan, I always need to give props to a band from Not Chicago.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Noise Merchant\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nNovak’s Kapelle Hypodermic Needle / Doing That Rhythm Thing 7″\n\nA repressing of a 1968 single—I initially thought this was a modern recording of a band doing a throwback sound. Austria’s NOVAK’S KAPELLE played psychedelic garage rock, and while it’s a decent little single, I was much more into it when I thought it had been recorded in this day and age. I do appreciate a re-release for those who want this stuff on wax, especially considering that the original 45 has gone for upwards of $400 on Discogs. For fans of IRON BUTTERFLY and doing large amounts of LSD.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Bachelor\n\nIssue MRR #484 • September 2023\n\nEndless Swarm Manifested Forms LP\n\nI feel like I’ve been a little bored with today’s grindcore scene at large, and was perhaps a little nervous that I was falling out of love with the genre. Enter the UK’s ENDLESS SWARM, reminding me that the style is still alive and kicking. Quintessential powerviolence here; the perfect combination of hardcore punk and blistering metal. SPAZZ-like dueling vocals, heavy riffs, and breakneck drums bouncing between insanely fast blastbeats and groovy breakdowns. Very high-energy and intense as fuck.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Coxinha / To Live A Lie\n\nIssue MRR #483 • August 2023\n\nBlind Solution Blind Solution cassette\n\nHardcore out of Tacoma, with a style that I’ve come to refer to as “blink and you’ll miss It” punk. Six songs in roughly three minutes and change. I’ll be honest, folks. If your band can write a decent twelve-second song, chances are I’ll love you. Like a more modern, polished NEGATIVE APPROACH. Great stuff here.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel To Live A Lie\n\nIssue MRR #483 • August 2023\n\nSquelch Chamber Eater of Self cassette\n\nI’ve been a big fan of Owlripper Recordings over these last couple of years, but have only been familiar with their compilations featuring sub-minute tracks from harsh noise artists the world over. Imagine my surprise when this album (released digitally via Owlripper and on tape by Bastard Premonition) kicked off with nothing but a simple, clean drumbeat. I was being baited, but at this point I had no choice but to go along with the ride. The moment that blown-out bass kicked in, I knew I was listening to an instant drone metal masterpiece. Noisy as all hell, dirty, slow, and low. Reminiscent of KILSLUG or a much more rustic version of Bullhead-era MELVINS. Worth a spin for any lover of doom or sludge.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Bastard Premonition\n\nIssue MRR #483 • August 2023\n\nDragnet The Accession LP\n\nI sound like a broken record, but Australia is exporting some of the best releases in rock’n’roll at the moment. Gritty dance-punk similar to bands like BLOC PARTY and ADAM AND THE ANTS, but much more rustic, raw, and powerful. Drums and bass are massive and everything is just so damn catchy. Love the dueling harmonic guitars as they seemingly compete for attention with the keyboards. Somehow with all of this going on, the vocals still stand out front and center. Even within the chaos of having six members, the music never sounds cluttered or messy. Great stuff.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Polaks / Spoilsport\n\nIssue MRR #483 • August 2023\n\nPilau Pressure EP\n\nPretty standard hardcore affair, but man, is this heavy as hell. Grindy and doomy with a little bit of black metal thrown in as well. Very nuanced, which is important when you’re writing a hardcore record in 2023. Has a little bit of a Southern groove to it, which is unique for a band from D.C. Recommended for all raucous pit-goers.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Capsule / Council\n\nIssue MRR #483 • August 2023\n\nFord’s Fuzz Inferno War, Peace & Fuzz EP\n\nWith a name like FORD’S FUZZ INFERNO, I was expecting something doomy. What we’re treated to here, though, is some good old-fashioned anti-war pop punk from the Netherlands. I’d say that’s just as good. Very reminiscent of BAD RELIGION and all the other classic bands you’re all familiar with. Nothing really groundbreaking here, but it’s catchy and recorded very well. Recommended if you’re nostalgic for the skate punk of the ’90s and have a hatred of armed conflict (which I assume includes all of us at this point).\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Subunderground Compulsive Agitation\n\nIssue MRR #483 • August 2023\n\nV/A Benefit for Prevention Point EP\n\nGreat compilation for a great cause. Nice mix of different-sounding bands, ranging from snotty garage rock to grind-influenced hardcore, from catchy to brutal all within fifteen minutes. Each band hails from the same region, so suffice to say Philly has a pretty healthy scene. Lovely stuff here, reminds me of the old compilations of my youth. Well worth a pick-up.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Strange Mono\n\nIssue MRR #482 • July 2023\n\nPriors Daffodil LP\n\nMelodic rock’n’roll straight out of Montreal. PRIORS’ newest release is their fourth LP in five years, which is impressive in its own right. Power pop akin to MARKED MEN, FIDLAR, or MIND SPIDERS, great use of synthesizers that pairs well with the catchy guitar licks that are laden throughout each track. Although the guitars are the most prominent here, I was really drawn in by the rhythm section—lots of great bass runs and the drums sound crisp and tight as all get-out. Solid album, although it’s a pretty standard garage rock piece. Definitely worth a spin if you’re a fan of the genre.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #482 • July 2023\n\nV/A Err02 EP\n\nFour-way split between four different hardcore bands that all sound pretty similar. Typical gruff, tough-guy riffs written solely with the pit in mind. HUNDREDS OF AU stands out from the other three with more of a classic ’90s emocore sound similar to GRADE and early THURSDAY. The rest are reminiscent of the slew of Victory Records bands that were huge in the late ’00s. I’ve always loved this type of compilation 7”, but you really gotta diversify the sound if you want to make it interesting.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Council\n\nIssue MRR #482 • July 2023\n\nRoyal Drug Defend Degeneracy CD\n\nPowerviolence out of Albuquerque that draws comparisons to SPAZZ and CAPTAIN THREE LEG. Great barking vocals more reminiscent of youth crew than grindcore. Drums and bass sound huge on this and drive more of the record than the guitars. That might sound counterintuitive for a hardcore album, but it works here. Groovy as hell. I may be biased, but bands who reference Altered Beast in any way get a gold star from me. My only complaint is the samples at the beginning of some tracks. I know this is a classic grind trope, but it kills the momentum on such a short record.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Dada Drumming\n\nIssue MRR #482 • July 2023\n\nFrisk / Last Affront split cassette\n\nSplit between two hardcore outfits out of the UK. There’s a little bit of a grind/powerviolence element here as well. FRISK is reminiscent of early CEREMONY, while LAST AFFRONT has more of a D-beat edge mixed with NEGATIVE APPROACH. Really love the vocal stylings from LAST AFFRONT. They’re unique and help them stand out from the mix of other bands who have done this type of hardcore countless times in the past. Otherwise, nothing really groundbreaking here. Worth a listen if you’re a moshcore junkie.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Iron Lung\n\nIssue MRR #482 • July 2023\n\nRed Crap The Truth is Still Out There LP\n\nPoland’s RED CRAP brings you traditional punkabilly with a little bit of a surfy goth-rock edge. The kind of band you might see at a hot rod show or a very large tattoo convention. Recording quality is fantastic, but that isn’t automatically conducive to an interesting album. While the talent is obviously there, The Truth is Still Out There is chock-full of old punk tropes that we’ve heard hundreds, if not thousands, of times before—very reminiscent of the early Fat Wreck bands. They would have fit in well with the Lookout! crowd in the late ’80s and early ’90s, but at this point we’ve heard this all before.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Enigmatic\n\nIssue MRR #482 • July 2023\n\nGumm Slogan Machine LP\n\nOh my. This is one hell of a record here, folks. Melodic hardcore coming to us straight out of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Akin to the SUCIDE FILE and very early EVERY TIME I DIE, this album just feels like it’s from the South. I mean that in the best way possible, attributing this to their heavy use of twangy, jammy guitar leads. Bouncing between groovy, catchy, dissonant, and downright violent, Slogan Machine features some of my favorite lyrics I’ve heard all year—a lamentation of a lack of community within a “community.” At least that’s how I interpreted it. Maybe I’m just jaded. Great stuff here, and very much recommended.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Convulse\n\nIssue MRR #481 • June 2023\n\nEx-White This is Future LP\n\nIf you had told me this band came from the late ’80s/early ’90s Chicago punk scene, I wouldn’t have doubted you for a second. Hailing from Germany, EX-WHITE’S first full-length ranges from dance-driven post-punk to raw, Midwestern melodic hardcore similar to NAKED RAYGUN and LEATHERFACE. Very much in line with some of the classic No Idea bands. I can’t lie, there’s a little bit of AC/DC thrown in here as well, especially on the titular track. Catchy as all hell, and released at the right time. This is a summer jam right here, folks. Give it a spin, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Mangel / Spared Flesh / Turbo\n\nIssue MRR #481 • June 2023\n\nCompleted Exposition & Blackphone666 / Transient & Bastard Noise split EP\n\nNothing makes me happier than seeing BASTARD NOISE still active and evolving after over thirty years of making ears bleed. Their most recent reincarnation has them teamed with Portland grindcore vehicle TRANSIENT, a partnership that has blossomed over the last several years. This pairing takes up the A-side, and it’s pretty much what you’d expect. Brutal powerviolence infused with classic industrial. COMPLETED EXPOSITION takes up the B-side and continues the flow with a style of death-grind that mirrors CARCASS mixed with MAN IS THE BASTARD. Go figure. A wonderful slab to add the collection for any extreme music fan.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel To Live A Lie\n\nIssue MRR #481 • June 2023\n\nMetrics Demo 2022 cassette\n\nHigh-energy hardcore from Spain that teeters on the edge of egg-punk thanks to their inclusion of a keyboard. Speaking of which, I’ve been listening to this EP on repeat for the last couple of weeks or so and only just realized there were synth leads layered in throughout the entire demo. In fact, the guitar overpowers almost everything, including the vocals. Otherwise, the production here is solid and crisp. I would just suggest they be a little more careful with the mixing next time around. All in all, a decent debut from METRICS. It makes me look forward to what they’ll do next.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Dirty Slap / Gerpfast / Noise Merchant / Not For The Weak\n\nIssue MRR #481 • June 2023\n\nBig Rat Rock n’ Roll Fever cassette\n\nBIG RAT’s new EP brings us four pure rock’n’roll tracks for the politically-conscious party animal in all of us. Singer Ian Brink channels Richard Hell and a nasally David Johansen, so naturally you’d think he was born for the role. With almost all of the energy coming from Brink, this is a very vocal-driven record, showcasing the authentic “punk” attitude that some attempt unavailingly. The rest of the band sounds very much like STREET BRATS and the JABBERS. Some great guitar licks here, at points giving off a real classic AC/DC vibe. All in all, nothing groundbreaking, but is absolutely worth a pick-up if you dig these types of tunes.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Manic Noise\n\nIssue MRR #480 • May 2023\n\nItalia 90 Living Human Treasure LP\n\nVery cool artsy post-punk from across the pond in London. Darkened dance-rock akin to JOY DIVISION, ADAM & THE ANTS, and PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. Spacey and ambient at points, atmospheric and subtly industrial at others. Singer reminds me very much of Nik Fiend of ALIEN SEX FIEND fame. The rhythm section provides most of the hooks while the guitar is left to wander on its own, getting lost in a sea of dissonant chords and reverb-laden licks. Dystopian poetry for an ever-growing apocalyptic world. Lovely work here.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Brace Yourself\n\nIssue MRR #480 • May 2023\n\n3D & the Holograms 3D & the Holograms LP\n\nMan, I’m sure someone out there is going to read this and consider it blasphemy, but my first thought upon hearing 3D & THE HOLOGRAMS’ self-titled release was “this is what GG ALLIN wishes he had sounded like.” Rock’n’roll chaos that is as brutal as it is catchy. There’s no build-up or warning. Once you hit play, you’re immediately thrown into the tornado of sound. Much like a caffeine-induced panic attack, you feel trapped. The walls are closing in around you and there is no escape. However, you find yourself enamored with this unadulterated fear. You embrace it. You crave more. But with a blink of an eye, it’s all over. Fantastic stuff here.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Roachleg\n\nIssue MRR #480 • May 2023\n\nDemoralized Demoralized demo cassette\n\nThere’s no mincing words here, folks. This is some of the best grindcore I’ve heard in quite a while. DEMORALIZED’S demo is very true to the genre’s nature—raw as hell, unlike a lot of the overproduced, studio grind you get nowadays. Drums sound natural and range from fast to fastest. Feels as if they were all done in one take, I mean that as a compliment. Guitars are heavy as hell and the vocals go unwavering. I’m usually not a fan of heavy treble on the bass, but it fits the DIY aesthetic so well that I can’t be mad. I terrorized my neighborhood last weekend by blasting this while grilling in my backyard. You kids make me feel young again.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Dynastic Yellow Star\n\nIssue MRR #480 • May 2023\n\nDecorticate Conditioned By Violence cassette\n\nDanish powerviolence with a hint of Ray Cappo thrown into the batter, sounding like BETTER THAN A THOUSAND merging with CAPITALIST CASUALTIES and other similar Slap-a-Ham-adjacent bands. Tightly mixed without being too over-produced. The drums are killer and direct traffic throughout, as is the case with most bands like this. Dueling vocalists channeling both youth crew and death metal energies. They’re not reinventing the wheel, but the nuanced singing styles make the album feel fresh, relentless, and unwavering. I am absolutely amazed that this is a trio. The sound is huge and intense as all hell. Well worth a spin if you love it fast and loud, which, if you’re reading this, I’d assume was the case.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Society Suckers\n\nIssue MRR #480 • May 2023\n\nLevel Gone West EP\n\nI typically love short and quick hardcore albums, but there’s something about this one that feels a tad empty and unsatisfying. The momentum is affected by dead air and sudden tempo changes, and it kills the energy midway through. These types of transitions work well on full-lengths, but for an EP that’s barely hitting the seven minute mark, there isn’t a lot of room to stretch your wings. I’d love to hear what an LP from these folks sounds like—feels like it’d fit their aesthetic a little better and give the building parts more time to breathe. Regardless, there’s some good stuff here. Very reminiscent of early CEREMONY. The drums sound great on this and are probably what’s causing me to long for more of their intensity.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel 625 Thrashcore / Thrash Tapes\n\nIssue MRR #479 • April 2023\n\nTeini-Pää Sata Syytä Aloittaa LP\n\nI don’t have an inkling of how to speak the Finnish language, so I had no idea what to expect with this record. The cover art reminded me a lot of the mid-to-late ’00s indie rock scene, and to be honest, because of that, I wasn’t expecting much here. However, this album completely blew me away. Very sentimental, rustic dream-rock. I can’t understand what they’re singing about, but I can feel it with the hooks and melodies. For all I know, they could be singing about something absolutely brutal. Still, the songs ooze with tenderness and nostalgia. “Mun Sydän On” is the standout track, the one that caused this album to sink its teeth into me. For fans of SUGAR STEMS and GOOD LUCK. Wonderful stuff.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Soit se Silti\n\nIssue MRR #479 • April 2023\n\nTee Vee Repairmann Organic Mould EP\n\nMore wacky, drum-machine-clad, DEVO-infused garage rock from our friends at Goodbye Boozy, this time featuring Australia’s TEE VEE REPAIRMANN. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it a thousand times: the best in punk is currently being exported from the Land Down Under. The rest of the world should collectively thank Strai’yah for their services to rock’n’roll. First half of this slab retains the traditional egg-punk we’ve all come to know and love, reminiscent of SNOOPER, ALIEN NOSEJOB, and CHERRY CHEEKS. The B-side features two slower ballads with a much stronger bedroom pop vibe. Really rounds out the EP as a whole. Great piece here, highly recommended.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Goodbye Boozy\n\nIssue MRR #479 • April 2023\n\nDoctor Explosión Superioridad Moral LP\n\nFirst record in over a decade from Spain’s DOCTOR EXPLOSIÓN. Great collection of songs here that bring to mind KING KHAN AND THE SHRINES melded with the MAMAS & THE PAPAS. This may sound like a weird concoction, but it works well. What you get here is a combination of the raw energy of a ’70s garage rock band and the bittersweet sentimentalism of golden-age oldies radio. Very partial to the vocals here, which sound like they’re coming from the deepest depths of an AM receiver in an old station wagon. Guitar work is incredible with licks for days. Great summer jams for those hot days where you sit around and do nothing but drink beer and sweat your ass off.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Slovenly\n\nIssue MRR #479 • April 2023\n\nSistema de Entretenimiento Sistema de Entretenimiento LP\n\nFantastic synth-heavy, drum machine punk from across the pond (Valencia, Spain). Diverse flavors in each track—well, as diverse as you can get with punk music. The first half of the album sounds like EPOXIES and GRAVY TRAIN!!! with a hint of ’90s Euro house. The rest are a mixture of classic DEVO and what could be described as a modern-day MUMMIES. I know drum machines aren’t for everyone, but I’m a sucker for them. Really adds to the band’s motif, and I don’t think a real drum set would do the music justice. Judging by their YouTube presence, their live shows look fun as all hell. Hopefully we’ll see them stateside soon enough. Lovely record here. Well worth a spin if you’re into melodic dance punk.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Flexidiscos\n\nIssue MRR #478 • March 2023\n\nEndorphins Lost Night People LP\n\nSludge-violence out of Seattle. Not a bad record by any means. Band is tight, and production is on-point. But if you’re recording a hardcore album in 2023, you best bring something unique that makes you stand out from the rest of the crowd. Night People comes off as a formulaic, grind-by-numbers slab. Very reminiscent of a modern CAPITALIST CASUALTIES and MAN IS THE BASTARD, especially with the dual vocals. Drums are easily the most impressive part here, and really drive the energy of each song. Worth a spin if you’re a powerviolence junkie.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Rotten to the Core\n\nIssue MRR #478 • March 2023\n\nV/A If, When & With Whom cassette\n\nGreat compilation for a great cause, with all proceeds benefiting the National Network of Abortion Funds. Wide range of genres here, spanning ’90s alternative radio worship to West Coast garage rock to lo-fi bedroom pop. Hell, there are even a couple vaporwave-fused synth-funk tracks as well. There’s something for everyone here. Heavily recommended release, both for the music and the mission. At this point, all we can do is look out for each other and help wherever we can.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Spared Flesh\n\nIssue MRR #478 • March 2023\n\nEn Love Fled EP\n\nBrutal powerviolence from Columbus, OH’s EN LOVE. Clocking in at under ten minutes, the Fled EP is a mosh classic. In what seems to be specifically crafted for the pit, this slab flows perfectly for anyone who is looking to dance their ass off. The EP kicks in slow and low, but immediately jumps into the action. No guitar solos, drums set deep into the pocket, just one homogeneous pile of fervent intensity. Very reminiscent of CLOUD RAT and other modern PV bands. I don’t know if this was on purpose, but the drums are blown out like crazy and it adds so much depth and vigor to an already massive recording. Good stuff here, recommended to anyone who loves newer grind.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Delayed Gratification\n\nIssue MRR #478 • March 2023\n\nRumor Kontrol Here are the Facts cassette\n\nI can candidly say that this release will not be for everyone, but I absolutely love what I will affectionately dub “bedroom punk”—hardcore drum machine madness from RUMOR KONTROL’s maiden voyage, Here are the Facts. DIY as all hell. Fast and gritty guitar that sounds like it’s being played from an old practice amp. I don’t want to mince words, I mean this as a compliment. Although I champion all things lo-fi and DIY, I didn’t notice the bass until much later in the album; my only complaint is that it should be a little louder in the mix. But other than that, this is pure rock’n’roll rawness right here. No ego bullshit, straight to the point.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Let Them Eat Tapes\n\nIssue MRR #478 • March 2023\n\nDead 77 Demons LP\n\nThe first full-length from Los Angeles’ DEAD 77. Upon first glance, I fully expected this to be a street punk album, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was more akin to the early A-F Records bands such as THOUGHT RIOT and the CODE. Gang vocals galore here, which act as a call and response to the raw, melodic lead vox. There’s a delicate balance to be had between both, and DEAD 77 does a good job of not overlapping them. It creates a strong energy that is unwavering throughout the entire record. This is also helped by the guitars, which are layered into a wall of sound, peppered with fiery leads throughout. Well worth a listen if you’re a fan of late ’90s melodic hardcore.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Dismantled\n\nIssue MRR #477 • February 2023\n\nSnooper Town Topic EP\n\nI have adored SNOOPER since I first laid ears on them several years ago. Do you remember that “egg-punk vs. chain punk” meme that was big back in 2018? If you’ve ever had a hard time distinguishing between the two, I’ll make it easy for you. SNOOPER is the quintessential egg-punk band, and they do it better than anyone else today. You see, while SNOOPER might draw comparisons to bands like DEVO or TOY DOLLS, they’re something completely different. They are their own influence. Town Topic continues their trend of fast-paced, new wave jazz-punk. Quick little jaunts about the simple things in life, for better or for worse. SNOOPER’s guitar tone is what hooks me in the most. Clean, punchy, and swift; a styling all their own. Fantastic band who will most certainly do huge things in the years to come. Better hop on this train now!\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Electric Outlet\n\nIssue MRR #477 • February 2023\n\nBothers II LP\n\nSecond full-length from Portland’s BOTHERS. Very interesting record, as it tends to meld certain punk styles that typically contrast. While a majority of the record has an early HOT WATER MUSIC/LEATHERFACE vibe, you can also hear a little bit of LAUGHING HYENAS-era John Brannon in the vocals. Songs swap between brutal, straightforward power chords to soaring harmonies. Catchy as all hell at parts. The bass is the unsung hero of this album, putting in work throughout. I wish it was a little louder in the mix so it could act as a stronger driver. For fans of No Idea Records and other melodic hardcore from the ’90s.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Dirt Cult\n\nIssue MRR #477 • February 2023\n\nChoke / Döpemess split cassette\n\nMusic aside for a second—maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I don’t understand why each half of this split is being hosted on two separate Bandcamp pages. I’m aware that this is first and foremost a cassette release, but the majority of the folks who will be listening to this will be doing so digitally. I feel like it would make more sense having it all in one place. Regardless, it’s a pretty groovy split. Both bands sound different enough for it to be interesting. As a two-piece, DÖPEMESS does a fantastic job filling any and all gaps. Drums are incredible and never waver. Fast as all hell. Dual vocals give the tracks a real call-and-response vibe. CHOKE is much more slow and low, reminiscent of SPAZZ and CAPTAIN THREE LEG-styled powerviolence with their barking vocals. Drums sound almost impossibly fast at times. Comes complete with samples that are almost longer than the song. Good shit.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Enemy of the Goat\n\nIssue MRR #477 • February 2023\n\nCompassion Pacing Animal LP\n\nFirst release in three years from Brooklyn’s COMPASSION. Blisteringly fast grind tracks—blink and you’ll miss them, which is arguably the best kind of grindcore in existence. Everything is super tight and heavy. Drums are so fast and on point that I need to see it to believe it. Vocals are intense and nuanced, switching between guttural growls and banshee-like screams. Guitars cut through everything else like a knife, crisp and menacing. Very reminiscent of IRON LUNG and early WEEKEND NACHOS. Press release mentions that this band is a duo, but this recording is layered with two guitars and a bass. Would love to see how they pull this off live. Well worth a digital spin.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Convulse\n\nIssue MRR #476 • January 2023\n\nSplit System Vol. 1 LP\n\nThere must be something in the water down in Australia because every band that has come through there lately has been incredible. Vol. 1 from Melbourne’s SPLIT SYSTEM is of course no exception. This album is what I would expect if the ROLLING STONES decided to try their hands at proto-punk, with the end result sounding like if the NICE BOYS had a heavier ADAM ANT influence. The vocals and lead guitar co-exist beautifully, and are both catchy while avoiding stepping on each other’s toes. Rhythm section is tight and stays in the pocket, letting the guitars shine. Great clean tone from both axes. Lovely record here, and very much recommended.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Legless\n\nIssue MRR #476 • January 2023\n\nDesiccate Desiccate demo cassette\n\nMan. I love this. DIY to its fullest. No-bullshit, heavy noise punk from the Great White North. Not a lot of nuance to their songs, but they don’t need it. DESICCATE isn’t here to be flashy. They’re here to fucking rock. Honestly, that’s what I like to see from bands these days. Energy that transcends the medium. No over-the-top production, no more than three takes. There’s no need for any ego-stroking solos here. Just the white-knuckle grip of a barre chord, the howl of indecipherable vocals, the grounded melody of a bass run, and a steady but powerful drum beat.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #476 • January 2023\n\nAlien Nosejob Stained Glass LP\n\nThis band is everywhere I look. I swear, I had three friends text me this album the day it dropped. With good reason, too. It rips! Guitar-worship to its fullest out of Melton, Australia. The press-release for this slab likens it to AC/DC. While that may be true for tracks like “Coastal Living 2,” I think the majority of the record sounds more like the NEW YORK DOLLS mashed with ZZ TOP. And not even just early-era TOP. I’m talking about the ’80s shit where they took a lot of risks, especially with “Sharp as a Needle” where the rhythm section really comes out for the first time. Speaking of, the bass and drums are tight as hell. I honestly can’t tell if it’s real drums or the best drum machine I’ve ever heard. Bass stays in the pocket for the majority of the record, and really gives the guitars the time to shine. Fantastic album, but seeing as it’s from Total Punk, you may already know that.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Anti-Fade / Total Punk\n\nIssue MRR #476 • January 2023\n\nSweet Reaper Microdose EP\n\nLovely little four-song slab from Ventura, California’s SWEET REAPER. Energetic, vocal-driven power pop with such a clean guitar tone that you’d think they were playing from an original 1950s Telecaster. Vocals are very melodic, and bring to mind MARKED MEN, RADIOACTIVITY, and a slew of other Dirtnap bands. Helps warm the bones on these chilly winter nights. Great stuff.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Alien Snatch\n\nIssue MRR #476 • January 2023\n\nMala Vista Ruthless & Toothless LP\n\nI don’t know about the rest of you, but power pop has always struck me as one of the most “dangerous” forms of music—even more so than hardcore and the like. Something about a bunch of tatted-up dudes having the confidence to play sugary-sweet rock’n’roll has one hell of an edge. Lovely album from this NYC quartet. Very reminiscent of EXPLODING HEARTS and EDDIE AND THE HOT RODS, especially with the vocals. They’re not reinventing the wheel here, but the songs are catchy as all hell and the guitars sound great with crisp, soaring riffs. Makes me nostalgic for my younger years, wandering the streets of Chicago after a couple drinks.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel No Front Teeth\n\nIssue MRR #475 • December 2022\n\nIngrown Gun LP\n\nClassic straightedge metalcore out of Boise, Idaho. More emphasis on the “core” than the “metal,” the way it should have always been. The length of the songs is a unique twist on a genre that’s usually known for its long, drawn-out ballads. Brutally fast at points, transitioning into some of the slowest and lowest breakdowns I’ve heard in years—the kind of breakdown that makes me want to zip up my hoodie and head into the pit. Production is crisp, with everything sounding crystal clear. You can hear every little detail. Very reminiscent of DEADGUY and all the bands you’d hear from Spook City back in the day.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Alternatives Label\n\nIssue MRR #475 • December 2022\n\nHigh Cost What’s Living Worth? 12″\n\nHeavy powerviolence out of NYC. The drums are incredible, going from blistering fast speeds to slow and low breakdowns within mere seconds. The guitars and bass follow along just as closely, and appear to borrow some tricks from black and thrash metal, a really dark tone set early on that continues through the whole record. The vocals are easily the most impressive part: raw, unwavering barking that comes off very natural and relentless. Doesn’t sound like they had to resort to studio tricks to give them that edge. Speaking of, fantastic production and tight as hell.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Bitter Melody\n\nIssue MRR #475 • December 2022\n\nCloud Rat Cloud Rat Redux LP\n\nA remastered, partially re-recorded version of Michigan grindcore trio CLOUD RAT’s debut album. If you’re familiar with them, then you heard this when it first came out over a decade ago. The record itself is great; the guitar swapping between relentlessly brutal and beautifully elegant riffs. The drums embody the classic grind element, while the vocals are non-stop barbarity from the moment you hit play. There’s a reason why this band is one of the top players in the game today. I just don’t think I understand the point of reworking the album—I personally think the original release still sounds better. If you’re a grind fan who appreciates ever-evolving production, then you’ll love this.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Artoffact\n\nIssue MRR #475 • December 2022\n\nAnn Beretta Like a Riot! Live From the Broadberry (Acoustic) LP\n\nMore proof that the line between country and punk is much thinner than you’d think. Originally released in 2020, this 2018 live recording of Richmond’s own ANN BERETTA features live, acoustic renditions of their typically electric originals. It’s popped back up on our radar because DCxPC Live recently gave this album a limited vinyl release. Much like other country-adjacent punk bands such as DRAG THE RIVER and TWO COW GARAGE, these songs are a fine mix of debauchery and sentimentalism. The heavy use of a pedal steel and fiddle pushes the tender vibe while helping fill the gap that’s been left from going acoustic. Strong vocals, very reminiscent of Ben Nichols from LUCERO—very gruff but melodic at the same time. Personally, I enjoy these versions way more than their traditional punk songs. Really adds to a stronger dynamic and makes it much more interesting.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel DCxPC\n\nIssue MRR #474 • November 2022\n\nC.O.F.F.I.N. / Mini Skirt split EP\n\nA fantastic split between two Australian punk bands. MINI SKIRT is up first with a very bass-driven style. The vocals come off monotone at times, but there’s something I really like about them. They feel authentic and sincere, especially on “Bag of Bones,” which appears to be a love song. Feels similar to Frankie Stubbs of LEATHERFACE. MINI SKIRT can be a little repetitive at times, but again, it works for them. C.O.F.F.I.N has a very different dynamic. Guitar-driven tracks with a vocalist that could be described as a punk rock MEAT LOAF. Very theatrical, especially when the piano lead comes in on “Under Your Wing.” This split works because the bands sound different enough to keep it fresh, but similar enough that you’ll be happy with both sides if you dig this sound.\n\nReviewer Jake Joyce\n\nLabel Erste Theke Tonträger\n\nIssue MRR #474 • November 2022"
