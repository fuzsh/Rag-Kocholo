        "text": "The BGN News Archive\n\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nCaptain Easychord went north to Portland and Geno's nightclub. He caught Tiger Bomb in their own territory. They mostly played songs from their albums Uproar and Sugar Buzz.\n\nThe second group was Cynz from New York. They had just played Square Root where the Captain saw them there too.\n\nThen it was the Mach Bell Experience. Point made: Mach Bell is indestructible and indefatigable. Catch the full review and photos by clicking the photo link above.\n\nThree of the members of A Bunch of Jerks have formed a new band called The Spackles. They've got a new singer Caroline who used to be in the group Missionarys. Mike Howlett says her voice fits the new material they've been writing since the Jerks disbanded.\n\nThey're playing a short set at the Jay Allen Birthday Bash this coming Saturday (April 1) as their debut. Then a week later they play at the Square Root with Stop Calling Me Frank. Mike says they'll play a full set with new songs that will be filled out with a few old Jerk chestnuts.\n\nRum Bar Records start to do their thing by leaking the first Spackles single \"Happy To See You\" next week, but its official release will be later in May. Four songs are already in the can and they are planning on recording again in a few weeks.\n\nSpackles Facebook page\n\nCongrats to Beebe Gallini for being included in Rodney on the Rock! Volume 4 with “My Way of Thinking.” We went bonkers for that when it first came out in Feb 2021 .\n\nThis song is worth the new attention. Rodney has the good taste. Get the vinyl here!!\n\nRich Mirsky has started a Kickstarter page to raise funds for the album project he is involved with called Meat the Psychopaths.\n\nThe artwork is being done by A.R.T. the guitarist of Sapling. If you pledge @20.00 you get the CD and your name will be on the liner notes. Pledge $100.00 and you get a house show too!! Read more and Pledge here\n\nRoger Miller posted his seasonal updates on his blog He has two solo guitar shows in May in DC and Baltimore. His Anvil Orchestra that does live soundtracks to silent movies has shows in Illinois, Wisconsin and Nebraska with films like Dr. Caligari and Metropolis. And his group Trinary System is working on recording their third album now.\n\nVIDEOS......\n\nA lot of people have opinions of GG Allin. Here’s over an hour of Merle Allin talking about his brother.\n\nMerle and GG grew up in a three room log cabin in rural NH. They had no running water. GG’s real name was Jesus Christ Allin because his father was a religious fanatic.\n\nLater Merle answered an ad in the Phoenix and joins Thrills as a bassist as GG started The Jabbers. A big turning point is 1985. That’s when GG first defecated on stage. From there on, there was no turning back for GG.\n\nMerle tells the whole GG story and pretty straight forward too. It’s really fascinating to get the story from Merle’s perspective.\n\nWe’ve enjoyed the The Beatersband from Italy and their take on classic rock tunes. Now they have a video for a long time fave “When You Walk In the Room”.\n\nMoving Targets have a video for “Ordinary Summer” off the latest album In The Dust. This is a contemplative song that hits its mark. It is especially melodic for Moving Targets in both the vocals and guitar lines. This is a good chance to dip in and hear the excellent current material.\n\nNeighborhood Shit are a local hardcore band that have slowly built up their reputation. They now have a video for their song “Cockroach.” It has fast clips of the band playing and, yes, some cockroaches.\n\nRADIO......\n\nAfter one live show Ron on Monday’s Late Risers Club was back to remote broadcasting. He had a parcel of good punk this week.\n\nClass from Tucson had the song “Left in the Sink.” It sounded like a 1977 punk nugget we might have picked up at Bebop records.\n\nBut Who's Reading Me? by CLASS\n\nRon also played The Dahmers from Spain. “The Ghost of Roy Orbison” is a poppy rocker, very irresistible we thought. This is off their new album Ghosts in the Garage.\n\nGhouls in the garage EP by The DAHMERS\n\n“Problematic” by Chicago’s Abi Oooze was a punk/garage song. Getting leads on songs/groups like this is why we love listening to Ron every week.\n\nJulia's Apartment (Demos) by Abi Ooze\n\nThe local Downhauls’ “Hazy Shade of Winter” cover sounded bright and sharp in the mix of the set.\n\nThe hear Ron’s whole show go to the WMBR Archive page and hit the link on the Monday 10am show for Feb 20.\n\nPODCASTS.........\n\nWBUR had a podcast that focused on the live music scene and its situation now. JJ Gonson was part of it.\n\nSome parts were not encouraging. Gonson said that finding a new club space has not been fruitful. It seems it just not economically feasible because of rents. We didn’t like to hear that. The outside concerts are difficult it seems and those aren’t sustainable economically either. Damn, that’s more we didn’t want to hear!\n\nAnd then there is the problem of artists being able to live in a city like Boston. They question is now (not the future, even), if there is are ways for younger musicians to live and thrive in the city.\n\nThey seemed to agree that large venues are full but there still is some covid hesitancy in the small venues.\n\nThis is a very frank discussion.\n\nBlowing Smoke with Twisted Rico has an interesting guest this week, Tim Catz. Tim’s first band was Seka/Strip Mind, then Roadsaw and now White Dynomite. He’s also written a few books .... and started the music scene at O’Brien’s in Allston, for that alone we owe him!! Catz started just booking Thursday night and eventually it grew to the club we know today.\n\nWith each of his groups Tim has a load of stories. He’s current group is named Horseneck.\n\nAl Quint started his Sonic Overload podcast this week with songs criticizing Bush and the Iraq war he initiated. That was a fruitful subject for hardcore bands at the time.\n\nThe last set had five songs from the Weirdos in remembrance of guitarist Dix Denney. That was a great set.\n\nYou can hear the whole show on the Sonic Overload web page\n\nNEW MUSIC/CDs......\n\nCold Expectations now has their first album, Static Reactions, up on Bandcamp. They've been releasing a string of memorable singles with videos for a while. They gave a good feeling for what the band is doing. They have an indie sound and a very arty way to style their material.\n\nFive of the songs have been previously released; “Two Blueberries,” “Hey Compromise,” “In The Padlocked Night,” “Summer Dress” and “Coat of Snow.” Those are the songs that have made us fans already. I mean we knew from the very first song “Two Blueberries” that they had a good thing going.\n\n“Souvenir” has a dreamy, jazzy vibe. The jazzy chords separate this song from the other songs on the album. You can feel the loss in the lyrics about a relationship now ended.\n\n“The Distance” continues that push into the poetic demi monde. Much of the album exists in that mind created world. “In the Padlocked Night,”“November Sun” and “Coat of Snow” are part of that. That’s what Tom Verlaine mined in the first Television album.\n\nCold Expectations has sustained that atmosphere for the length of the album.\n\nThen there's relief from that with the lighter touch of “Trench Coat” (video of that here) and the cover of “Take the Skinheads Bowling”.\n\nIt took a long time to get this album, and it is worth the wait. This should be one of the year’s best when we look back!\n\nStatic Reactions by Cold Expectations\n\nSapling now have a second song off their upcoming album. The song “11:37” is a tribute to Taylor Hawkins the drummer of the Foo Fighters.\n\nThis song has so many sound qualities that suck you in! The bass lines are solid and give the song structure and drive. Periodically they pump up the guitar in fuzz and drown all the instruments in echo. When they stop abruptly at the end of the song it takes a few seconds before the echo dies.\n\nThe tag line of a chorus “Make Your Idols Cry!” works big time.\n\nThis is one of those catchy songs that you just want to hear every time you tune into your fave radio show. We hope that happens.\n\n11:37 by Sapling\n\nEddie Japan’s newly released song “Time Machine” is from the forthcoming album Pop Fiction. Greg Hawkes (from the Cars) adds some synth. It only takes a few notes for Greg to initiate an avalanche of memories. He carries the Cars sound with him.\n\nIt’s fortunate that Eddie Japan has the song writing and arrangement chops to accommodate Greg because you can't help but compare ... whether you want to or not. Eddie Japan has been working hard and this album has the potential to give this 2013 Rumble winner another big boost of attention.\n\nPop Fiction by Eddie Japan\n\nHere’s a rerelease of note. Wimpy & the Medallions, the Still Headed Nowhere EP. It is a vinyl seven inch and it's a limited edition.\n\nPlaying on the record is Wimpy Rutherford the original frontman of the cult pop-punk band The Queers. ex Queers/Nobodys guitarist Geoff Palmer, Kurt Baker from The Leftovers and members from The Connection.\n\n\"Still Headed Nowhere\" was recorded and written in 48 hours during Memorial Day weekend 2012.\n\nSongs are: \"Still Headed Nowhere,\" \"36 Weeks,\" \"Girls Gone Psycho\" and \"Draggin' The Line.\" You can order here\n\nHere's some good shows coming up .....\n\nMarch 27, 2023 (Monday) Nequient, Torn In Half, Stone The Oracle at The Silhouette\n\nMarch 29, 2023 (Wednesday) Eliza Niemi, Jeremy Ray Posse, Alexander, Really Great at The Silhouette\n\nMarch 30, 2023 (Thursday) Modern Day Idols, Powderhouse at Notch Brighton 7-9:30PM - FREE just bring some shelf staple foods to donate and RSVP here.\n\nMarch 31, 2023 (Friday) Robotic Hawks, Phantom Ocean, Bad Idea USA, Sorry, Ma! at The Square Root\n\nMarch 31, 2023 (Friday) The Church - The Hypnogogue Album Tour at The Sinclair FB page.\n\nMarch 31, 2023 (Friday) Dead Low (Record Release), Klaxon (RI), Vicious Ritual (RI), Working Poor U.S.A. at Flashback Arcade+Bar, 294 main st, Hyannis, MA\n\nMarch 31, 2023 (Friday) Blindspot, Mindset X at The Shackskeen Pub Manchester, NH\n\nApril 1, 2023 (Saturday) Holy S%&T I'm turning 60 - Jay Allen's Birthday Show with Justine and The Unclean, Tom Baker's Double Down, Muck and The Mires, Stop Calling Me Frank, The Shang-Hi-Los, The Spackles (Ex-A Bunch of Jerks), Jay Allen and The Archcriminals, Spiller, The Dogmatics, Quest for Tuna at French Club, Waltham, MA, 5pm to Midnight- FB page\n\nApril 1, 2023 (Saturday) Diablogato, Coffin Salesman, Casket Rats at Faces Brewing Malden FB page.\n\nApril 1, 2023 (Saturday) Children Of The Flaming Wheel, OOF(NYC), Germ House at Fields West Allston\n\nApril 3, 2023 (Monday) The New Noise, This Body Is All I have In This World, Edward Glen, Average Joey at The Silhouette\n\nApril 4, 2023 (Tuesday) Minx, Electric Aces, Melted Chapstix, Pete Cassini at O'Brien's\n\nApril 5, 2023 (Wednesday) Matt Charette, Linnea's Garden, Lobohombres, Time & Place at The Silhouette\n\nApril 6, 2023 (Thursday) Jack McKelvie & The Countertops and Thalia Zedek at Notch Brighton\n\nApril 6, 2023 (Thursday) Rock'N'Roll Rumble Night 1 - Kooked Out, Bird Language, The Shallows, Graveyard of The Atlantic at The Middle East Up\n\nApril 7, 2023 (Friday) Rock'N'Roll Rumble Night 2 - Bleach The Sky, Not Bad Not Well, Gretchen Shae & The Middle Eight, Paper Tigers at The Middle East Up\n\nApril 8, 2023 (Saturday) Randy Black & The Heathcroppers have a First Saturday of Every Month 4-6PM residency at Plough & Stars\n\nApril 8, 2023 (Saturday) Slide into Spring with Crow Follow and Connor Storms & His Bouquet at The Village Social CLub.
