        "text": "You remember that Cool dude in school that just kind of kept to himself?\n\nWell, he’s gone now.\n\nGary Richrath passed away a month ago and it’s high time that I quit moping about it and register more than a mention on my Facebook page. The rule is that when writing about a historical figure or someone you don’t know, the writer is obliged to refer to the subject by their last name. Well, Mrs. Gonzales, 10th grade English teacher, no dice. He is ‘Gary’ because of that tone. He is Gary because the singer was in the spotlight and he was happy to be slinging that Les Paul around. He is Gary to me for the rest of my life because I still hear that gritty tone from Keep Pushin’ through my Walkman headphones while lifting weights in high school, the power meets agility of his solos and his Midwestern, wild hair, blue jean wearing, laid back coolness.\n\nGary was my first guitar hero. There were others. I own everything that the Dutch import from Pasadena with the striped red guitar ever recorded but it took a backseat to Gary. For those uninitiated, here is an earlier mention of the man from years ago.\n\nGrowing up in the 80’s, I found myself defending Gary’s music routinely. “REO Speedwagon isn’t the band of these radio ballads”; I’d say over the sound of the piano intro to ‘Can’t Fight This Feelin” during couples skate at the Moore, OK skating rink. I didn’t care. Gary wrote the rockers, man. Take It On The Run, Follow My Heart, Only The Strong Survive, Ridin’ The Storm Out… You could hear one of his songs a mile away.\n\nI could hear him whenever I got into my brother’s car, whenever I needed a break from the hair metal in my high school days, when I was away in college and wanted to remember being at home in my room and whenever I ran into another guitar player that realized that the sunburst Les Paul was not the sole property of Led Zep and Ace.\n\nThis tribute isn’t exhaustive. It doesn’t even seem fitting. But one month ago, it became soberingly clear that there will be no new music from Gary. But for the rest of my life, there will be the music of that cool dude that kept to himself all around me.\n\nRIP Gary Richrath < Hit this up around the 3:40 mark to see what all the commotion is about.\n\nIt’s not like I wasn’t doing anything while I wasn’t posting.\n\nWho says I’m no artist? Check it… www.BeanShirts.com Adorable samples below. Hit up the site and check it out.\n\nA long-time buddy from Oklahoma made the plunge and moved on out. This is how we spent our summer break (this winter). Hope nothing on the site offends. Just silly stuff on a shirt.\n\nAnyway… Listen to Black Sabbath. That is all!\n\nMy name is Thefullbug and I love REO Speedwagon\n\nThat felt good and it needed to happen a long time ago. But why now? Must have been last Wednesday. I roll up to work rocking some REO loud enough to be heard and pull into the space in front of a guy that is well, (thinking about how to describe him) terribly, terribly, terribly gay. I see this dude all the time. Some small talk in the break room about his cool car, talk about what he does at the office… You know. But on Wednesday, he gave me the “dude nod”. As to say, I know you listen to REO Speedwagon. It’s not your choice, really. You were born that way.\n\nSo, before this thing gets so far out of hand that when people talk about REO Speedwagon fans they add the disclaimer; “not that there’s anything wrong with that”, I need to set a few things straight.\n\nThis band of love song singing, adult contemporary radio staples started out with long hair and sang about being anti-establishment hippies in the very early ’70’s. I mean, they were a rock and roll band!\n\nThey had one of the cool band logos that rocked a set of wings a la Aerosmith and Queen.\n\nAside from writing some of their great songs, founding member, Gary Richrath could straight up play a Les Paul! Just listen to him. here, here, and here <– Great example here. Start around the 1:50 mark.\n\nBruce Hall (and before him) Greg Philbin are great bass players. Steven Bush, quit laughing at me and check it. –> (here)\n\nWhen Kevin Cronin was firmly in the frontman seat by album three, they were already an excellent bluesy Midwestern hard rock band. He brought that piano/guitar ballads and they started getting commercial success. As drummer, Alan Gratzer put it; “We started doing wedding songs.”\n\nLast point? Everyone I know that has made fun of me for being an REO fan is wrong. Astonishing, I know. But true. Every one of you.\n\nYou may now all go about your business of calling me a fag.\n\nWhat? Clay Aiken? But he’s in a Broadway musical! How can this be?\n\nNEW YORK (AP) – Clay Aiken is finally confirming what many people already knew: He’s gay. The cover of the latest People magazine shows Aiken holding his infant son, Parker Foster Aiken, with the headline: “Yes, I’m Gay.” The cover also has the quote: “I cannot raise a child to lie or hide things.”\n\nLinked story\n\nNext People mag’s investigative wing is going to uncover that Ruben Studdard was black! I don’t know what to believe anymore!\n\nCan you imagine?!\n\nYou want a rolling depiction of misery? Please see state’s evidence 1A (below).\n\nI pass this car at least once a week on the morning drive to Nashville. In case you can’t read it… Yes this license plate reads; “AIRSPLY”. Every time I pass her, I imagine her grooving to “All Outta Love” as she imagines what prom would have been like if Billy Jackson had asked her instead of Sarah!\n\nAnyway, long story slightly longer, I passed this chickie today and see her just letting some poor guy have it! I don’t know what he did but he must have done a lot of it! Poor guy. Whoever you are, you are allowed to punch your boss, co-workers, the lunch counter lady, toddlers, and anyone else you come across right in the face. I can’t imagine what that drive was like for you this morning. Listening to this broad scream about socks on the living room floor while “Making Love Out of Nothing at All” is rocking the CD player. This makes me laugh and cry at the same time. What forms of suicide went through this guys head?\n\n“That deaf, dumb, blind kid sure plays some real hardball”\n\nAn Open Letter to the Old Fort Parkway Wal Mart in Murfreesboro, TN\n\nI find myself at a Wal-Mart about once a year. Last night was this year’s time. ‘Hoot’ (at about 4 years old) decided that she loves The Who. So, I figured, a Who CD is just what that Disney, Cinderella, ‘Children’s Sunday School Sing-Along’ CD collection of hers needs. I don’t know if it’s Roger Daltrey’s voice, Pete Townshend’s guitar, Keith Moon’s frantic drum pounding… Dunno. I’ve never liked them that much. But whenever they come on the radio in the truck or we pass by one of the dozens of commercials with their music in the background, she starts dancing and telling me to “keep it on this”. Pretty remarkable, really. I know their place. Without them and Led Zep, rock music would be much different today. So, to the CD section I go.\n\nHannah Montana, Weezer, Jay Z, Timberlake, crap FM fill in the blank blah, blah, blah… Nothing from The Who! I checked again. What the? So, I get this kid with a name tag that was working on some high school honeys to help out. I asked him if they have any of their CDs. He looked at me like I slapped him. Remember when Macaulay Culkin was pounding Uncle Buck with tons of questions in the kitchen? It kind of turned into that.\n\nMe: Hey, man. Do you have any CDs from The Who?\n\nKid: The what?\n\nMe: No, The Who.\n\nKid: Blank stare\n\nMe: You know… Moon, Daltrey, The Who! (Blank stare) Won’t Get Fooled Again? My Generation? The Kids are Alright? Behind Blue Eyes? Whooooooo Are You? Who? Who? Who? Who?\n\nKid: (cricket sounds)\n\nI’m e-mailing someone in a red vest today. I did see this while I went back out to check on my tire! I think it’s like Corn Nuts. Part corn part nuts all delicious. I wonder how many deer it takes to make a bag this big\n\nAte lunch at the desk today\n\nIf I ever become a rapper, I have found my name. Easy Mac in the house!\n\nLadies and gentleman, put your hands together for…\n\nStory (link)\n\nRegulators Hopeful Texas Sinkhole Won’t Swallow Homes\n\nNot a real interesting story. I just think it would be a great band name. “You wanted the best. You got the best! Massive Sinkhole!”\n\n“We’re Massive Sinkhole! We love you, Tupelo! Owwww!”\n\nStop. Collaborate and listen!\n\nIce is back with a brand new invention (link)\n\nWord to yo Mutha…\n\nWha had happened?\n\nI got home late last night. Mrs. Full Bug had American Idol paused on the TIVO so I picked it up when she got to the living room. They were talking about the charity that the show was going to raise money for this year. Several celebs were blah blahing about something then, The King of Pop himself said something. I thought; “Wow, they got Mike to appear. How’d they do that?”.\n\n[negative] MFB said that it was Teri Hatcher. No way! I rewound it 2 or 3 times. The chick (link) that got weirded out by Jerry Seinfield when she found out that he had Elaine spy on her in the sauna for him? The chick from that Superman show? This is nuts. Check this (link) and see if you get the urge to hear some Dirty Diana?\n\nIs Katharine Hepburn the last actress that will allow herself to age gracefully and continue to act?\n\n10 things that people should all just admit\n\nThe Beatles were not that good. Shut-up already!\n\nO.J. Simpson cut his former wife’s head off. He also killed that other dude. If you were there that night, he would have killed you too.\n\nUnder all the lipstick and stupid clothes, a lot of ’80’s metal bands had some really good musicians.\n\nFirst generation Asian people do value education more than the Americans that met them at the shore.\n\nOld school rap was awful. They’d rap about anything! (link)\n\nNew rap sucks much worse. Was going to link but it was barely distinguishable. I think it’s some sort of code or something.\n\nSkittles are not an acceptable substitute for M&Ms.\n\nPeople should be allowed to run old woman who drive with little dogs in their laps off of the road. Oh, and nobody cares about your grandchildren.\n\nNobody can tell the difference between the two Darrens on Bewitched.\n\nFinally: The answer. Mary Ann or Ginger? Ms. Mary Anne Summers. (link)\n\nSkydiving no longer does it for you?\n\nCalling all of those thrill seeker types!\n\nFresh off their “burning down the house” performance in Rhode Island, Great White is taking their thrill ride overseas. This is really kind of like X-Games for 80’s metal fans. SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY! BE THERE! AS GREAT WHITE PLAYS LIVE!\n\nIn my stand-up days, I got more boos AND laughs with a bit about these dudes. It was tasteful. As tasteful as a stand up bit about Great White burning mullets off of dozens of fans can be.\n\nI can see the concert flyers now… GREAT WHITE Live! What are you? Chicken?\n\nGreat White announce the European tour in support to the release of their album Back To The Rhythm.\n\nJanuary 25, 2008 Copenhagen, DENMARK The Rock\n\nJanuary 26, 2008 Helmond, HOLLAND Club Plato\n\nJanuary 28, 2008 Newcastle, UK Carling Academy\n\nJanuary 30, 2008 Glasgow, UK The Cat House\n\nJanuary 31, 2008 Wolverhampton, UK Robin 2\n\nFebruary 1, 2008 Southampton, UK The Brook\n\nFebruary 2, 2008 London, UK Sheperds Bush Empire\n\nFebruary 6, 2008 Madrid, SPAIN Heineken\n\nFebruary 7, 2008 Barcelona, SPAIN The Apollo\n\nFebruary 9, 2008 Pratteln, SWITZERLAND Z-7\n\nFebruary 10, 2008 Piacenza, ITALY TBA\n\nFebruary 11, 2008 Treviso, ITALY TBA\n\nFebruary 13, 2008 Stockholm, SWEDEN Debaser\n\nFebruary 14, 2008 Malmö, SWEDEN KB\n\nNo truth to reports that Sammy Hagar was seen fleeing from scene with a fire hydrant wrench\n\nClick here for article\n\nVan Halen’s home was reportedly the only one to be damaged.\n\n(Hands on hips) “Oh, Birdman, when will you learn?”\n\nWhaaaaa? Next they’re going to claim that some local cops were spotted at Krispy Kreme! Please click for wise ass punchline.\n\nWithout these brave men, we’d all be waist deep in Foo!\n\nA confession to my hipster buddies (I’m looking at you, Jednik and Clay).\n\nI admit that I am behind the curve. (Old man voice pumping bony fist in the air) ’80’s metal was good enough then and there’s nothing wrong with it now. Honestly, The last 10 years or so… I can not tell the difference between LimpNickleCreedBiskit and Chris Daughtry’s whiny, grading pop songs. Through all of the crappy music of the 1990’s and the 00’s there came The Foo Fighters. I thought this whole time that Alice in Chains was going to be the lone stand out from this noise. But an an unquenchable thirst for the smack got Alice in Chains’ front man Layne Staley and they checked out of this competition.\n\nSo, in another show of greatness from Mrs. FullBug, she laid this CD on me last night. She said that she was tired of me always saying I liked the song on my truck’s stereo and inevitably finding out it was The Foo Fighters. Great CD. Great band.\n\nHurts me to say it. Lead singer, Dave Grohl was the drummer for the band that killed metal. I then reward him with a prized place on my favorite website. Now, who’s the Foo?\n\nAnother in a long line of funny videos from the Fighters –> Click Me! Click Me!\n\nWhy would the cops think that wife beaters, dead beat dads, and DUI offenders would be Ozzy fans?\n\nOzzy Angered by ND Sheriff’s Sting\n\n(AP) — Ozzy Osbourne wants an apology from the Cass County sheriff for staging a sting operation in the rocker’s name without his permission.\n\nOsbourne claims his reputation was tarnished when Sheriff Paul Laney invited 500 people with outstanding warrants to a phony party at a Fargo nightclub before the rocker’s concert with Rob Zombie at a nearby arena. More than 30 showed up and were arrested.\n\nThat’s right, Oz. Stand up for what you believe in. Please see the below pics of Mr. Osbourne keeping his rep in place.\n\nMoney Changes Everything -Cindy Lauper, 1984\n\nForgive my little stream of consciousness blow up but I’m wrestling with a question. Why do I even want to see the above train wreck? This is NOT the same band that made me stop and stand in front of the radio in Kevin McCormick’s garage and with an open mouthed stare as Eddie Van Halen tore up “Eruption”. I was only 6 years old but I knew this was not ABBA. I also knew that everything else coming out of my brother’s Plymouth Duster’s speakers (Schon, Frehley, Richrath, Page, Buckingham, etc.) didn’t sound like this either. No. This was different. This was dirty and mean and loud and maybe what those dudes in the Eagles wanted to sound like but just didn’t for some reason. THIS was rock and roll. This is why Drop Dead Legs and Girl Gone Bad played through the class cassette player when Mrs. Gibson left the room was worth me spending the rest of the day in the Principal’s office of Eastern Avenue Christian Academy.\n\nSo, why is it different? I don’t know. Somewhere in my Dad’s tool shed back in Oklahoma, I’ve still got the copy of Guitar World magazine from 1991 where Eddie Van Halen spends half of the interview explaining why Roth quit. Roth says he was fired. Blah, blah, blah… Nobody cares.\n\nI was excited when Roth was “back” in ’96. Same when Roth was “back” in ’02. They hate each other again. No, they don’t. Wait… yes they… What were we talking about? Ed claims that they recorded some new music with DLR but are fighting again and that Van Halen is going to tour with Sammy Hagar for the summer. Roth is on the Howard Stern Show talking about the brothers Halen like they were the devil. He’ll never talk to them again. Ed’s on MTV claiming that Roth “better wear a cup” if he ever talks to him like that again. Cup? I don’t know either. Some catfight, I guess. Oddly enough, Van Halen managed to record my favorite album ever (5150) with Sammy Hagar after the first break up in 1986.\n\nSo, what does it all mean, Gladys? I just don’t think I like it. In the last ten years, Van Halen made a crappy album with Ex-Extreme front man, Gary Cherone. Those who claimed that David Lee Roth can’t even get arrested these days were proved wrong with a pot bust in Central Park. And the Van Halen camp was silent. A year ago Eddie Van Halen made a brief appearance at some award show looking like the crazy woman down the street with the dozens of cats and baseballs and frisbees in her overgrown yard because the kids were scared to go get them. Roth looked well, Roth looked like Doc from Back to the Future. They were tired. Ed checks into rehab, Roth was fired from his boring radio show, and Ed’s son “replaced” founding member, Michael Anthony on bass. Now they’re friends?! Now, they’re old buddies that just had a misunderstanding? The rock and roll equivalent of rap feud shooting after a Mike Tyson fight in Vegas. Makes me wonder just how much cash a promoter waved in front of them. It doesn’t matter. It’s all hard to buy the “it’s just show business” line after 20 years of animosity. Hard to swallow the Ed and Dave all smiles and hugging after every song thing too.\n\nI saw about 30 min of footage of their last rehearsal at the Staples Center and some from the first show in North Carolina. They do look good these days. It looked like most of the guys from Van Halen doing a decent impression of a 1984′ish Van Halen. Should a 50 year old man still be “Hot For Teacher”? I know 2 decades have passed and musical styles have changed, people grow, and things just come out differently. I saw Metallica in high school then saw them again 5 years later. Different. But Van Halen built the Van Halen franchise on being Van Halen. Maybe it’s 20 years of rust. Maybe they will come off of the tour and record a great album. Maybe that “Brown Sound” will live again in the new century. But then again, maybe Ed will fall off the wagon (again), Dave will be so coked up he can’t find his keys, and the kid on bass will be playing his XBox with his buddy from down the street. Who knows? Maybe they’ll come to Nashville on this tour. Maybe I’ll beg Mrs. FullBug for the night off to go.\n\nLost in Love and I don’t know much\n\nTo the two dudes in the parking lot at work this morning. You know who you are. You smirk when I say something funny in the break room . You both seem pretty cool. The tall one has a really pretty girlfriend that brings you lunch sometimes. I don’t know your names. Anyway… That was Air Supply playing loudly from my SUV this morning at abut 6:50am. However, it was Led Zeppelin until my giant finger hit the wrong button on the XM receiver when I was trying to turn the thing off to go into the office. As for your puzzled look (puzzled look = I knew that Scott dude was probably a fag), I can explain this. I panicked. I should have just turned the radio off and gave you the “dude nod”. Instead, I chose to act like the Skipper from Gilligan’s Island and wildly slap at the receiver with my hat and yell “Gilligan!”. Or something like that. I know there will be no more smirks at my comments in the break room. Let’s just agree not to make any eye contact until all this ugliness is past us.\n\n26+ days of a fever and a birthday party\n\nBeen a while, but you can’t rush art! Thanks to all for the e-mails, calls, hateful notes tied to bricks found under a broken window in my living-room, and questions about me and the blog. I’m back. Quick catch up then back to regular posting on Monday.\n\nSeptember showed me a lot. I have a very understanding boss at work, a very determined wife, and a few close friends that have kept me in the game lately.\n\nMrs. Fullbug had a birthday party on the 10th. It was planned for almost 6 weeks. China flatware, rented tables, catered Italian food, music, strung up lights in the back yard, big birthday cake, and dozens of worried calls to the sister-in-law, Mrs. 5. Oh yeah… Violent thunderstorms on the day of the party. Son-of-a-*$#@!!!! Back to the good friends part. Three of these dudes and “5″ kicked my fever having head into gear and made a game time decision to scrap the outside part and bring it all in.\n\nThanks to some quick work by Clay, Aaron, Jimmie, Bush, and “5”, things turned out great and I stood there wondering why God gave a dork like me these great friends and a brother that made sure this party wasn’t a bust! Oh, and this just in… The dude above with the earring can SING! He had the line of the month after agreeing to sing Mrs. Fullbug’s favorite song. (On my cell phone still) “Who sings How Deep is Your Love? *aaron” Extra points for not knowing this!\n\nIf all goes well, looks like I’m heading out soon to finally get some specific medical help for the problem behind the fevers and leg problems.
