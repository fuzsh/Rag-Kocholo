The Help Center contains articles on using Jabber features. You can provide feedback on individual articles or request new articles through the Help Center.\n\nThe Help Center search includes a set of filters to narrow your results by product, release, activities, operating system, and other categories.\n\nBuild Numbers\n\nJabber for Windows\n\nJabber for Mac\n\nDownload URL: Install_Cisco-Jabber-Mac-14.3.1.308554-198058217-MCwCFBNKKwSzR15+FLMfu584_YuVZZt_AhQ8vvcpzj0I0mCUw0a4i5BFFT1eOA!!.zip\n\nJabber for iOS\n\nJabber for Android\n\nJabber for VDI\n\nNew and Updated Features\n\nHide all Rooms tab\n\nReleased in 14.3.1\n\nAn admin can configure a key to hide all persistent chat room tab in Jabber; only the rooms that the end user has already joined would be shown in the 'My Rooms' tab.\n\nKey name: ShowAllRooms\n\nKey value: false\n\nLocal Push Notification Service(LPNS) over private cellular network\n\nReleased in 14.3.1.\n\nIt’s the extension of the released feature Local Push Notification over provisioned Wi-Fi networks.\n\nWhen Jabber registers to the Unified Communications Manager and joins a private cellular network that provides LPNS, Jabber starts receiving notifications about incoming and missed calls. The notification displays the name and number of the calling party.\n\nWhen the client is in any of the configured cellular networks, it establishes a persistent local connection to the Unified Communications Manager server. When there is a new incoming call, UCM first tries to send it via that local push notification service; If that fails, UCM sends it via the Apple Push Notification Service.\n\nThis feature only applies to iOS 15 or later, on the supervised devices.\n\nThe admin needs to configure the cellular network information, such as mobile network code(MNC) and mobile country code(MCC).\n\nKey name: LocalPushLTEList\n\nKey value: <MNC-MCC>\n\nExample 1: <LocalPushLTEList>MNC1-MCC1</LocalPushLTEList>\n\nExample 2: <LocalPushLTEList>MNC1-MCC1;MNC2-MCC2</LocalPushLTEList>\n\nAndroid OS 14 support\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nJabber now supports Android OS 14.\n\nSupport new devices\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nJabber now supports these devices:\n\n· Samsung Galaxy A54 (Android 13 and later)\n\nSupported Android devices in 14.3\n\nNote: Starting from next Jabber release, minimum OS requirement will be Android 10. Consequently, devices such as Seuic Cruise 1, which are unable to upgrade to Android 10 or higher will no longer be supported.\n\nMacOS Sonoma support\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nJabber for mac now supports MacOS Sonoma 14.1 and later.\n\nReplace IE with Microsoft Edge (WebView2)\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nCisco Jabber for Windows can use WebView2 as the default browser for SSO, OAuth, and custom tabs, to improve security.\n\nIE is still the default browser. To change Jabber’s default browser to Microsoft Edge WebView2 for existing users, you can set the following key in the Jabber configuration file:\n\nKey name: BrowserEngineForLogin\n\nKey value: EDGE\n\nThe change takes effect from the next time the user signs in.\n\nFor new installs, you can set WebView2 as the default browser with this command line sequence:\n\nCiscoJabberSetup.msi CLEAR=1 BROWSER_ENGINE_FOR_LOGIN=EDGE\n\nThis command writes a config file entry to jabber-bootstrap.properties.\n\nOutlook Calendar integration with CMS meetings\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nThis feature provides a smoother and more user-friendly meeting experience for Cisco Jabber users.\n\nUsers can join meetings directly from their Cisco Jabber calendar or from the pop-up meeting notification, and they don’t need to go to Outlook to click the CMS web link.\n\nWhen users click the Join button in their Cisco Jabber calendar or the pop-up, the CMS web app automatically opens the meeting URL.\n\nTo enable this feature, you must add the CMS meeting domains in the Jabber configuration file:\n\nKey name: CMSMeetingDomains\n\nKey value: Delimited list of CMS meeting domains. For example: CMSDomain1.com; CMSDomain2.com\n\nVDI: MacOS Sonoma support\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nVDI supports MacOS Sonoma.\n\nVDI: Citrix Virtual Applications & Desktops 7 LTSR 2203 Cu4\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nVDI supports Citrix Virtual Applications & Desktops 7 LTSR 2203 Cu4.\n\nVDI: VMware Horizon Agent 8 2312 (8.11)\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nVDI supports VMware Horizon Agent 8 2309 (8.11) and VMware Horizon Agent 8 2312\n\n.\n\nVDI: Unicon eLux RP 6 2302 LTSR CU2\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nVDI supports Unicon eLux RP 6 2302 LTSR CU2.\n\nVDI: HP Thinpro 8.1\n\nReleased in 14.3\n\nVDI supports HP Thinpro 8.1.\n\nLimitations\n\nCisco Jabber for Windows\n\nThese are the limitations that apply to the Jabber for Windows client.\n\nLimitations for All Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to all Jabber for Windows deployments.\n\nAllow Paste Operations via Script\n\nJabber versions 11.8.5 and later may have issues with Copy/Paste when the policy Allow paste operations via script is enabled for Internet Explorer at Windows Components > Internet Explorer > Internet Control Panel > Security Page > Internet zone.\n\nAutomatic Detection of Proxy Settings (WPAD)\n\nCisco Jabber doesn’t support Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) proxy discovery. For information about how to configure proxy settings for Cisco Jabber, see Configure Proxy Settings in the On-Premises Deployment for Cisco Jabber guide.\n\nBluetooth Connectivity Unsupported with Cisco Headset 56x\n\nCisco Jabber doesn’t support the use of Bluetooth with Model 56x Cisco headsets. You can use these headsets with a USB-C to USB connector cable.\n\nCall Transfers\n\nWhen you’re transferring a call to a third party, the third party must respond to the call before you can complete the transfer. You can’t currently dial the third party and connect the first party while waiting for the call to connect (also known as a blind transfer).\n\nPrior to Release 12.7(1), Cisco Jabber doesn’t correctly inform Unified Communications Manager that a call being transferred is on hold. This behavior results in incorrect reporting when you use Jabber with Cisco Finesse.\n\nCameras with shutters\n\nFor cameras with shutters, such as the Cisco Desk Camera 1080p, Jabber doesn't support the close/open shutter operation when the camera is used during a video call.\n\nIf the user closes the camera shutter during the call for more than 5 seconds and then reopens it, the video does not come back.\n\nIf the user closes the camera shutter before placing a call, then opens the shutter during the call, video may not be available.\n\nCannot Copy Image\n\nYou can’t right-click over an image in a conversation in Jabber and select copy. Instead, highlight the image and then right-click to copy it.\n\nChat Reply and No Voicemail Profile\n\nIf the user has no voicemail profile configured, the chat reply feature doesn’t work. If the user selects Chat reply in an incoming call, the call continues to ring and the Chat reply and Answer options are grayed out. CSCux75667 documents this limitation.\n\nChat Behavior During Transition to MRA\n\nJabber loses chat messages that are sent while the Jabber client is transitioning from an on-premises network connection to an MRA network connection, or vice versa. Users receive an error message when they try to send chat messages during this transition period.\n\nCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\n\nCisco Jabber for Windows supports Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client version 4.0 and later. CSCuy14721 documents this limitation.\n\nCisco IP Communicator\n\nCisco IP Communicator isn’t supported as a controlled device on Jabber when users choose to use their desk phone for calls.\n\nCisco Unity Connection Dispatch Messages\n\nIn Cisco Unity Connection, a dispatch message is sent to a distribution list with the message configured in such a way that only one user responds to that message. A user can accept, decline, or postpone the dispatch message. Cisco Jabber for Windows doesn’t support Cisco Unity Connection dispatch messages. CSCuw31908 documents this limitation.\n\nContact Resolution for Enterprise Groups\n\nJabber resolves contacts in enterprise groups individually rather than all at once. As a result, when you add an enterprise group to your users' contact lists—or if they clear their local cache—they'll only see the username and domain for each person until they hover over or interact with them.\n\nEmails to a Group of Contacts\n\nThere’s a limit of 2083 characters in the To field when sending an email to a group of contacts. With long email addresses or many recipients, not all contacts may be added to the email. For more information about the 2083 character limitation, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/kb/208427.\n\nExtension Mobility\n\nJabber doesn’t support the Cisco Extension Mobility Cross Cluster (EMCC) feature.\n\nDevice Name with Extension Mobility\n\nWhen Extension Mobility is enabled, the controlled devices menu in Jabber displays the phone type only, instead of the phone type and user name.\n\nDo Not Disturb (DND)\n\nIf Jabber is controlling the Deskphone and if Do Not Disturb (DND) is set on the Deskphone,the presence status of the Jabber client does not change.\n\nThis behavior indicates that the Jabber client is functioning as designed. No action is required from the user.\n\nHTML Sanitization Code\n\nThe Jabber HTML sanitization code has been modified to disallow 'masked' links in XMPP message payloads due to its potential abuse in phishing attacks. These links are no longer allowed for security reasons.\n\nIt is recommended that Jabber Administrators educate potential users who may be affected by this feature enhancement.\n\nIBM Notes Contact Search\n\nWhen searching for an IBM Notes contact, entering either \" or \\ as the first character in the search string won't find the correct contact.\n\nJabber Config Change Detected Loop Scenario\n\nA Jabber \"Config Change Detected\" loop can occur if you assign the Jabber Config Profile (jabber-config.xml) on UC service and in the Group Config file for Phone page/common phone profile, and then you remove the Jabber Config Profile from the UC Service while Fast Login is enabled. In this scenario, once you remove the Config Prilfe from UC Service, the config change detected loop is triggered.\n\nWorkaround: Disable Fast Login, see Planning Guide for Cisco Jabber.\n\nJabber to Jabber Calls and Symantec Host IDS (HIDS)\n\nJabber to Jabber calls can trigger errors in Symantec HIDS.\n\nSymantec HIDS has a rule that disables connections from internet-based servers if it receives 5 connection requests from the same internet-based server within 200 seconds. For example, 3 Jabber to Jabber calls within 200 seconds will trigger Symantec HIDS. When this happens, ongoing Jabber to Jabber calls are dropped and Jabber to Jabber calls are disabled for 600 seconds.\n\nTo avoid this scenario, you must add Cisco Jabber to the Symantec exception list. This behavior is documented in CSCuw32007.\n\nJoining Meetings by Meeting Number\n\nIn deployments that use a Cisco Webex Meeting Server, you cannot use the meeting number when joining by Webex. Use the meeting URL instead.\n\nJoining Webex Meetings from Jabber\n\nWebex site disclaimers don't appear when you join Webex meetings from Jabber. This limitation applies whether joining from the meeting reminder popup, or by selecting Join in Webex in Jabber.\n\nLDAP Credential Delivery with Unified Communications Manager 12.5(1) SU2\n\nIn Unified Communications Manager Release 12.5(1) SU2, Unified CM added support for securely passing encrypted LDAP credentials in the Service Profile. This update secures access to your directory by ensuring that the password is always stored and sent in an encrypted format. This change includes encryption during directory access authentication, client configuration file downloads, BAT imports/exports, and upgrades.\n\nIn Jabber 12.8 with this Unified CM release or later, we take advantage of this capability by downloading the LDAP credentials as part of User Profile after end-user authentication.\n\nIn Jabber 12.7 and earlier with this Unified CM release or later, we can’t use these credentials from the Service Profile as we did before. They pass an encrypted password to Active Directory which causes a connection failure. For these Jabber releases with the upgraded Unified CM, provide the LDAP credentials through the jabber-config.xml file.\n\nFor more details, see the Release Notes for Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the IM and Presence Service, Release 12.5(1) SU2 and the section on LDAP Service Accounts in the Planning Guide for Cisco Jabber.\n\nLimit of 450 Participants in a CMS Meeting\n\nYou can have a maximum of 450 people in a single CMS meeting.\n\nLocation Feature and Multiple Domain Support\n\nConsider the following deployment scenario:\n\nWhen you deployed your Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service node, all users were imported with single domain support. You later changed the address scheme to Directory URI (multiple domain support).\n\nThe location feature now doesn't work for newly added domain users. Users in the initial domain are unaffected. CSCuu63734 documents this limitation.\n\nLogitech Keyboard Display Changes\n\nThe built-in display for Logitech UC keyboard K725-C doesn’t display caller or device information on incoming calls. Instead, the Cisco logo is displayed.\n\nMeeting Reminders\n\nCisco Jabber displays pop-up reminders for Cisco Webex meetings only. Reminders for non-Cisco Webex meetings are not displayed.\n\nIf the URL for a Webex meeting is changed (for example, by URL filter software), attempts to join the meeting from the meeting reminder or from the Meetings tab fail. This behavior is documented in CSCux03658.\n\nMicrosoft Outlook Local Contacts and Presence\n\nUsers' presence is unknown when the contact is manually added to contacts in Microsoft Outlook 2010 and 2013, when the contact is added to local (custom) contacts with an email address type of SMTP. To resolve this issue, delete the contact and add it again manually, ensuring the email address type is Exchange (EX). CSCuo57172 documents this limitation.\n\nMicrosoft Outlook OST File\n\nIntermittently Cisco Jabber for Windows is unable to access the Microsoft Outlook OST file. To resolve this issue, restart Jabber and restart Outlook.\n\nMultiline\n\nCisco Jabber can't make calls from any line, while there's an incoming call ringing on another line. While another line is ringing, the green Call button is dimmed and not available. Users can wait for the ringing to stop, or decline the incoming call.\n\n168 Byte Limit for Transferred Filenames\n\nWhen transferring a file, the filename cannot exceed 168 bytes (including extension). If you attempt to send a file with a longer name, you are notified that you have exceeded 168 bytes.\n\nPhone Mode Deployments with Microsoft Lync\n\nDisable Click-to-x functionality if you want to deploy Cisco Jabber for Windows in phone mode on the same computer as Microsoft Lync. See the Common Installation Arguments section of the Deployment Guide for more information about the CLICK2X installer switch.\n\nPlantronics Accessories and Software\n\nIf you use Plantronics accessories for Cisco Jabber call management, and if you have Plantronics Hub installed, ensure that at least version 3.5 is installed. Download Plantronics Hub 3.5 from the Plantronics website.\n\nPresence indicators on Sharepoint 2016\n\nWhen you sign out of Jabber, the presence indicator bubbles are grayed out and do not refresh after signing back into Jabber.\n\nYou can resolve this behavior by refreshing the webpage. This will ensure that accurate presence information is displayed.\n\nReal-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)\n\nJabber sends RTCP packets even when disabled. RTCP is an integral component of Jabber Telephony services.\n\nRemote Desktop Control over Mobile and Remote Access\n\nRemote desktop control over Mobile and Remote Access isn’t supported. This limitation is documented in CSCuz19139.\n\nRemoving Participants During Conference Calls\n\nUsers can only remove participants from a conference call when using a softphone (CSF) device for calls in a non-VDI deployment. Users can't remove participants from conference calls in desk phone control mode or using extend and connect.\n\nSAML Single Sign-On Limitations\n\nWhen configuring SAML SSO on Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers, use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of an IP Address to define the server name. If you use an IP Address, the client displays a warning message that the certificate isn’t valid. The requirement to use an FQDN is because the embedded Internet Explorer browser isn’t able to validate IP addresses in the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) certificate.\n\nFor the same reason, when you configure SAML SSO on Cisco Unity Connection servers, use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Service Profile instead of an IP Address to define the server name. If you use an IP Address, the client displays a warning message that the certificate isn't valid.\n\nSchedule Meeting Button Disabled on Phone-Only Mode\n\nWhen Outlook is installed, and the MacCalendarIntegrationType parameter is set to Outlook, the Schedule Meeting button is displayed. However in phone-only mode, the button is not shown.\n\nSingle Number Reach\n\nFor Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Control (VCS) versions earlier than 8.10.X, configure the editable inbound rules to enable the single number reach for users who are using Cisco Jabber over Mobile and Remote Access. For more information, see Limitations in Enable Single Number Reach section from the Feature Configuration Guide for Cisco Jabber 12.0.\n\nSpace Characters in Credentials\n\nThe following rules apply to space characters and credentials:\n\n·Usernames can contain spaces in on-premises deployments.\n\n· The first and last characters of usernames in on-premises deployments can't be spaces. This rule is also true for usernames synchronized from a directory source.\n\n·Usernames can’t contain spaces in cloud-based deployments.\n\n·Passwords can’t contain spaces in any deployment scenario.\n\nStandard CTI Secure Connection User Group\n\nCisco Jabber for Windows doesn’t currently support CTI connections over transport layer security (TLS). As a result, Cisco Jabber for Windows users can’t switch from using a CSF device to using a desk phone device if they belong to the Standard CTI Secure Connection user group. This limitation is documented in CSCux83786.\n\nSupported Characters in a Cisco Jabber User ID/E-mail Address\n\nThe following characters are supported in a Cisco Jabber user ID/E-mail Address:\n\n·Uppercase (A to Z) and lowercase (a to z) characters\n\n· Numbers (0-9)\n\n· Period (.)\n\n· Hyphen (-)\n\n· Underscore (_)\n\n· Tilde (~)\n\nTIFF Images Not Supported\n\nIn this release, if users have a .tiff image as their avatar, then Jabber displays the default icon image instead. To use a personal avatar, users must upload an image in a supported format, such as jpg, bmp, or png.\n\nUsing Click-To-X Feature with Contacts in Microsoft Outlook\n\nIf you use UDS as a directory source, users can only use Click-To-X capabilities, such as Click-To-Call and Click-To-IM, to contact Microsoft Outlook users if they are already in the cache file. A cache file is created for someone if they are in the users' Cisco Jabber contacts list, or have a Cisco Jabber history created by the user previously searching, IMing, or calling them, or by leaving a voice message.\n\nVAD with BIB\n\nJabber doesn't support VAD enabled in any upstream devices when BIB is enabled.\n\nIf any upstream device enables VAD, Jabber with BIB enabled does not sync the two forked recording streams.\n\nThe user may hear disordered audio in the recording server.\n\nVideo Calls\n\nThe Start My Video button doesn't work immediately after a call connects. Users must wait approximately 6 seconds after the call starts before clicking the Start My Video button. This behavior is documented in CSCuz06415.\n\nVoicemail Credential Popup during Sign-in\n\nIn a hybrid deployment, if Webex messenger, Call Manager and Unity connection are all SSO enabled, and voicemail credentials have been previously saved to cloud, users may see the Update Credentials popup for voicemail during the sign-in process. The workaround is not to configure voicemail server address on the cloud server but only configure it in the service profile or the jabber-config.xml file.\n\nWindows 10 Crash Using Cisco 700 Series Headsets\n\nIf you use Cisco 700 Series headsets, you might experience Windows OS crashes (Blue screen). This occurs on Windows 10 version 1803 and earlier versions. Update to a later version of Windows 10 to correct the problem.\n\nLimitations for On-Premise Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to Jabber for Windows on-premises deployments.\n\nAdding Federated Contacts\n\nWhen adding federated contacts, Cisco recommends that users add the federated contacts as company contacts (File > New > Contact), rather than as custom contacts. Adding federated contacts as custom contacts can cause intermittent presence issues. This issue is documented in CSCuz59060.\n\nCreating and Configuring Devices for Users in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0\n\nIf you are creating devices for users in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0, you can now specify a key order as RSA Only, EC Only or EC Preferred, RSA Backup. However, the EC Only option is not currently supported by Cisco Jabber, and if you select it, the client will fail to connect to the server.\n\nMultiple Resource Login\n\nWhen a user signs in to multiple instances of the client at the same time, the chat feature behaves as follows in on-premises deployments (more on multiple resource login in Common Deployment Scenarios):\n\n·Signing in on one client changes custom availability states to 'Available' on other clients.\n\n·If you set the availability state from 'On a call' to another state while on a call, the availability state does not automatically change to 'On a call' for subsequent calls.\n\nSIP Trunk for Phone Presence\n\nFrom Release 11.5(3), you must configure a SIP trunk between Cisco Unified Communications Manager and IM and Presence Service if you want Cisco Jabber users to see phone presence. In previous releases, a SIP trunk was not required for phone presence. This limitation is documented in CSCuz85578.\n\nPort Contention Disrupts Sennheiser Plug-In\n\nCall control with the Sennheiser plug-in uses port 8001 by default. If another application uses this port, it can cause issues.\n\nAs a workaround, you can change the EPOS SDK's PortNumber parameter to another port in the appropriate file:\n\n· Windows—%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Sennheiser\\SDKCore\\PDS\\config.dat\n\n· Mac—/Library/Application Support/Sennheiser/SenncomSDK/secomSFSDK.dat\n\nNote: Consult Sennheiser for more information about these files.\n\nShut down Jabber before changing the port in the SDK. Then, restart Jabber after you change the port.\n\nLimitations for Cloud Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to Jabber for Windows on Webex Messenger and Team Messaging Mode deployments.\n\nBlocking Users in Enterprise Groups\n\nBlocking users does not prevent a blocked user's status from being displayed if the blocked users are in a contact list as part of an enterprise group. For example, User A blocks User B. However, User A is in User B's contact list as part of an enterprise group. As a result, User B can view User A's availability status.\n\nInvitees to Instant Webex Meetings\n\nInvitees to instant Webex meetings must be provisioned with Webex accounts before they can join an instant Webex meeting. For example, User A has a Webex account and starts an instant Webex meeting from Cisco Jabber. Use A then invites User B, who does not have a Webex account, to the meeting. When User B clicks on the meeting link in Cisco Jabber, an error message is displayed and the user can't join the meeting. User B must be provisioned with a Webex account before attempting to join any instant Webex meetings. This limitation is documented in CSCux52068.\n\nJabber to Jabber Calls\n\nWe recommend running Internet Explorer 10 or greater while using the Jabber to Jabber calling feature. Using this feature with previous versions of Internet Explorer or with Internet Explorer in Compatibility Mode can cause issues with Cisco Jabber client login (non-SSO setup) or Jabber to Jabber calling capability (SSO setup).\n\nUsers in Common Identity\n\nThere is a known issue with signing into Cisco Jabber for some users who have migrated to Common Identity. If users receive an Incorrect user name or password error message when entering their credentials, see the following article, https://help.webex.com/en-us/yhq7pw/Reset-Forgotten-Password-in-Cisco-Jabber.\n\nCisco Jabber for Mac\n\nThese are the limitations that apply to the Jabber for Mac client.\n\nLimitations for All Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to all Jabber for Mac deployments.\n\nChat Behavior During Transition to MRA\n\nJabber loses chat messages that are sent while the Jabber client is transitioning from an on-premises network connection to an MRA network connection, or vice versa. Users receive an error message when they try to send chat messages during this transition period.\n\nLimit of 450 Participants in a CMS Meeting\n\nYou can have a maximum of 450 people in a single CMS meeting.\n\nNew Certificate Requirements for macOS 10.15\n\nApple has new requirements for trusted certificates in macOS 10.15 (see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176). Ensure that the certificates on the Unified Communications Mananger, IM & Presence, and Expressway servers meet these requirements. If your certificates don't meet these requirements, users are prompted to accept the certificates for each session.\n\nWebex Site Disclaimers\n\nWebex site disclaimers don't appear when you join Webex meetings from Jabber. This limitation applies whether joining from the meeting reminder popup, or by selecting Join in Webex in Jabber.\n\nSingle Number Reach\n\nFor Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Control (VCS) versions earlier than 8.10.X, configure the editable inbound rules to enable the single number reach for users who are using Cisco Jabber over Mobile and Remote Access. For more information, see Limitations in Enable Single Number Reach section from the Feature Configuration Guide for Cisco Jabber 12.0.\n\nSave Chats to Outlook\n\nWhen you use Outlook 2016, Outlook won't save images that are sent in chats. However, Outlook does save any emoji in the chats.\n\nAudio Device Setting After Upgrade\n\nWhen users upgrade the client, it can intermittently result in a reset of their selected audio devices. To resolve this issue, set the audio devices in the Audio/Video Preferences window. CSCva48136 documents this limitation.\n\nAntivirus\n\nWhen the client connects to Cisco Unity Connection on a device that has antivirus software, users can have issues with voicemail connections. To resolve this issue, add the Cisco Unity Connection server information to the exceptions list for the antivirus software.\n\nUsers in Common Identity\n\nThere’s a known issue signing into Cisco Jabber for some users who have migrated to Common Identity. If users receive an Incorrect username or password error message when entering their username and password, see the following knowledge base article https://cisco-support.webex.com/guest/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/WBX000019555/myr=false.\n\nCreating and Configuring Devices for Users in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0\n\nIf you’re creating devices for users in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0, you can now specify a key order as either:\n\n· RSA Only\n\n· EC Only\n\n· EC Preferred, RSA Backup\n\nHowever, Cisco Jabber doesn't support the EC Only option. If you select it, the client fails to connect to the server.\n\nCertificate Validation for CTI Connections\n\nCisco Jabber uses certificate validation for CTI connections. We recommend using either Public CA or Private CA to sign certificates.\n\nConnecting to Cisco Unified Communications Manager using a self-signed certificate, results in a certificate validation failure, to resolve this issue do one of the following:\n\n·The user accepts the invalid Cisco Unified Communications Manager self-signed certificate on first certificate validation failure and Cisco Jabber saves this certificate to the trust store.\n\n·Deploy the certificates using a certificate deployment management application.\n\nExpressway for Mobile and Remote Access Deployment\n\nFor an Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access deployment, when using an online certificate status protocol (OCSP) or online certificate revocation lists (CRL) to verify certificate status, Cisco Jabber expects a response time of less than 5 seconds. Connections fail if the response time is greater than the 5 seconds.\n\nNetwork Disconnection When Using Cisco Jabber on Audio or Video Call\n\nThere’s a known issue in the Mac OS where network interfaces drop intermittently when DSCP is enabled.\n\nIf you encounter this issue, do the following:\n\n1. Select Preferences > Calls > Advanced.\n\n2. Uncheck Enable Differentiated Service for Calls.\n\nStandard CTI Secure Connection User Group\n\nCisco Jabber for Mac doesn’t currently support CTI connections over transport layer security (TLS). As a result, Cisco Jabber for Mac users can’t switch from using a CSF device to using a desk phone device if they belong to the Standard CTI Secure Connection user group.\n\nContact Resolution for Enterprise Groups\n\nJabber resolves contacts in enterprise groups individually rather than all at once. When you add an enterprise group to your users' contact lists or they clear their local cache, they originally only see each person's username and domain. More information appears when they next hover over or interact with a person.\n\nBluetooth Connectivity Unsupported with Cisco Headset 56x\n\nCisco Jabber doesn’t support the use of Bluetooth with Model 56x Cisco headsets. You can use these headsets with a USB-C to USB connector cable.\n\nPoly Headset Plug-in Removed\n\nCisco Jabber for Mac 12.8 removed the Poly headset plug-in. The plug-in caused a monitor keyboard input alert on macOS 10.15. Without the plug-in, we can't support call controls (answer, decline, hold, and resume) on the headsets.\n\nWhen there's a fix for the plug-in, we’ll add it back into Jabber.\n\nWindows 10 Crash Using Cisco 700 Series Headsets\n\nIf you use Cisco 700 Series headsets, you might experience Windows OS crashes (Blue screen). This occurs on Windows 10 version 1803 and earlier versions. Update to a later version of Windows 10 to correct the problem.\n\nJoining Meetings by Meeting Number\n\nIn deployments that use a Webex Meeting Server, you cannot use the meeting number when joining by Webex. Use the meeting URL instead.\n\n168 Byte Limit for Transferred Filenames\n\nWhen transferring a file, the filename cannot exceed 168 bytes (including extension). If you attempt to send a file with a longer name, you are notified that you have exceeded 168 bytes.\n\nLimitations for On-Premise Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to Jabber for Mac on-premises deployments.\n\nPort Contention Disrupts Sennheiser Plug-In\n\nCall control with the Sennheiser plug-in uses port 8001 by default. If another application uses this port, it can cause issues.\n\nAs a workaround, you can change the EPOS SDK's PortNumber parameter to another port in the appropriate file:\n\n· Windows—%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Sennheiser\\SDKCore\\PDS\\config.dat\n\n· Mac—/Library/Application Support/Sennheiser/SenncomSDK/secomSFSDK.dat\n\nNote: Consult Sennheiser for more information about these files.\n\nShut down Jabber before changing the port in the SDK. Then, restart Jabber after you change the port.\n\nCisco Jabber for Android\n\nThese are the limitations that apply to the Jabber for Android client.\n\nLimitations for All Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to all Jabber for Android deployments.\n\nJabber for Android does not Receive Location Information\n\nDevice location information is not shared while the application is running in background.\n\nChat Behavior During Transition to MRA\n\nJabber loses chat messages that are sent while the Jabber client is transitioning from an on-premises network connection to an MRA network connection, or vice versa. Users receive an error message when they try to send chat messages during this transition period.\n\nLimit of 450 Participants in a CMS Meeting\n\nYou can have a maximum of 450 people in a single CMS meeting.\n\nJabber for Android Doesn't Start with the OS\n\nAs of Release 12.7, Jabber for Android doesn't support automatically starting with the OS.\n\nWebex Site Disclaimers Don't Appear When Joining Meetings\n\nWebex site disclaimers don't appear when you join Webex meetings from Jabber. This limitation applies whether joining from the meeting reminder popup, or by selecting Join in Webex in Jabber.\n\nVideo Calls Don't Start if Chromebook Camera Is Already in Use\n\nIf another app is using the camera, Jabber for Android can't start video calls from your Chromebook.\n\nVoicemail Server Might Not Display URI of Missed Call\n\nBecause of a limitation of Cisco Unity Connection, the voicemail server can't display the URI for a missed call. This issue occurs when you decline an incoming Cisco Jabber call from a URI and the call diverts to voicemail. If the contact information for the caller contains only a URI, the voicemail server displays the caller as Unknown. If the contact information contains a URI and a directory number, the voicemail server displays the directory number for that contact.\n\nMusic Apps Keep Playing When You Start Video Call\n\nWhen you play music with a third-party application, the music doesn't automatically pause when you make or receive a Cisco Jabber for Android video call. To work around this issue, you can open the third-party application to pause and resume the music.\n\nAudio Issues on Calls over MRA\n\nIf you make a Cisco Jabber for Android call using Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access over a 2G, 3G, or 4G network, you may experience audio quality issues from network instability.\n\nConflicts with Cisco AnyConnect and SafeNet MobilePASS\n\nIf you use Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, MobilePASS one-time password generator from SafeNet, and Cisco Jabber for Android on the same device, you may experience problems due to compatibility issues between these applications. For example, during a Cisco Jabber for Android call, you may hear no audio or one-way audio, or you may experience delays if you transfer the call.\n\nContact Resolution for Enterprise Groups\n\nJabber resolves contacts in enterprise groups individually, not all at once. So, when you add an enterprise group to your users' contact lists—or if they clear their local cache—they see only the username and domain for each person until they hover over or interact with that contact.\n\nCreating and Configuring Devices for Users in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0\n\nIf you're creating devices for users in Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0, you can specify a key order:\n\n· RSA Only\n\n· EC Only\n\n· EC Preferred\n\n· RSA Backup\n\nHowever, Jabber doesn't support the EC Only option, and if you select it, the client fails to connect to the server.\n\nNetwork Reconnection in a MRA Non-SSO Environment\n\nIn a Mobile and Remote Access non-SSO environment, when Jabber loses its connection to the Cisco VCS Expressway server, there's an interval of 120 seconds between sending connection requests. This interval prevents multiple requests to the server from multiple clients. During this 120-seconds interval, even if your network connection is active, Jabber remains inactive.\n\nSamsung Unmonitored App List\n\nWhen you install Jabber for the first time, Samsung devices automatically put Jabber in the unmonitored apps list. The device doesn't put unmonitored apps to sleep while they run in the background. However, if you upgrade your Samsung OS from a version without unmonitored apps list, you have to add Jabber to the unmonitored apps list manually.\n\nCisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Control Earlier than 8.10\n\nFor Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Control (VCS) versions earlier than 8.10.X, configure the editable inbound rules to enable the single number reach for users who are using Cisco Jabber over Mobile and Remote Access. For more information, see the limitations in the \"Enable Single Number Reach\" section of the Feature Configuration Guide for Cisco Jabber.\n\nSign-In Issues with Jabber in SSO Mode\n\nIf your users have issues with signing into Cisco Jabber in SSO mode, they can upgrade Android System WebView and Chrome browser to resolve the issue. Users can upgrade Android System WebView and Chrome browser from Google Play Store.\n\nHTTP Basic SAML SSO Authentication\n\nSign in might fail when switching users with the Reset Jabber option. Reset Cisco Jabber, quit the application fully in the Android OS, and try again.\n\nIssues with tel:// URI Feature\n\nBecause of the large number of third-party applications that support the tel:// URI feature, we can't guarantee interoperability of this feature on all third-party applications. In some third-party applications, this feature allows you to click a tel:// link and select Cisco Jabber for Android to call.\n\n168 Byte Limit for Transferred Filenames\n\nWhen transferring a file, the filename cannot exceed 168 bytes (including extension). If you attempt to send a file with a longer name, you are notified that you have exceeded 168 bytes.\n\nSRST Not Supported from Release 10.6\n\nSecurity Survivable Remote Site Telephony (SRST) is not supported in Cisco Jabber for Android Release 10.6 or later.\n\nConnection Issues With Invalid Certificates\n\nWith the Cisco Unified Communications Manager 11.0 and later, not accepting invalid certificates quickly can cause issues with your server connections. If you don't accept an invalid certificate when prompted in 10 seconds, for some HTTPS connections, you might have issues, such as, inability to download some configuration or inability to connect to the phone service or the voicemail.\n\nAndroid Webview Impact on Jabber in SSO Mode\n\nFor users with an SSO account, Jabber stops working if the Android Webview is reset, upgraded, or restarted.\n\nCompression of Transferred Files\n\nDuring file transfer, only files with JPEG file format are compressed.\n\nMRA and WebEx Meetings with siteType \"Orion\"\n\nIf the meeting siteType is \"ORION\", then Jabber mobile clients can't start Webex Meetings over Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access network.\n\nAuto Authentication Not Supported from 12.7\n\nAuto authentication at startup is no longer supported from Release 12.7.\n\nWi-Fi Turned Off When Answering Call\n\nJabber turns off Wi-Fi when you answer a call on cellular network to avoid call drops.\n\nLimitations for Cloud Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to all Jabber for Android on Webex Messenger and Team Messaging Mode deployments.\n\nTeam Messaging Mode Doesn't Support Android Wear Devices\n\nJabber team messaging mode doesn't support notifications on Android Wear devices.\n\nCisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad\n\nThese are the limitations that apply to the Jabber for iPhone and iPad client.\n\nLimitations for All Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to all Jabber for iPhone and iPad deployments.\n\nChat Behavior During Transition to MRA\n\nJabber loses chat messages that are sent while the Jabber client is transitioning from an on-premises network connection to an MRA network connection, or vice versa. Users receive an error message when they try to send chat messages during this transition period.\n\nLimit of 450 Participants in a CMS Meeting\n\nYou can have a maximum of 450 people in a single CMS meeting.\n\nNew Apple Certificate Requirements for iOS 13\n\nApple has new requirements for trusted certificates in iOS 13 (see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176). Ensure that the certificates on the Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), IM & Presence, and Expressway servers meet these requirements. If your certificates don't meet these requirements, Jabber prompts users to accept the certificates for each session.\n\nWebex Site Disclaimers Don't Show When Joining from Jabber\n\nWebex site disclaimers don't appear when you join Webex meetings from Jabber. This limitation applies whether joining from the meeting reminder popup, or by selecting Join in Webex in Jabber.\n\nAudio Issues with MRA over 2G, 3G, and 4G Networks\n\nIf you make a Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad call using Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access over a 2G, 3G, or 4G network, you may experience audio quality issues from network instability.\n\nSingle Number Reach with MRA on TelePresence Video Communication Server Control\n\nApplies to Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Control (VCS) versions earlier than 8.10.X.\n\nConfigure the editable inbound rules to enable single number reach for users who use Cisco Jabber over Mobile and Remote Access. For more information, see Limitations in Enable Single Number Reach section from the Feature Configuration Guide for Cisco Jabber 12.0.\n\nFavorite Icon Doesn't Show with Phone-Only Accounts\n\nCisco Jabber for mobile clients don't show the Favorite icon for users with Phone-Only account.\n\nApple Push Notifications Required with Jabber\n\nWithout Apple Push Notifications (APNs), iOS doesn't wake Cisco Jabber when Jabber receives an incoming call or chat. The call or instant message appears on the device after several minutes or when you bring Cisco Jabber the foreground. As a workaround, reset the network settings for your iOS device by going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.\n\nEditing Phone Services Servers\n\nUsers can no longer edit their Phone Services servers manually, except when they are in hybrid cloud mode. In hybrid deployments, administrators can configure the Phone Services servers to be editable.\n\nCertificate Installation for Secure Phone Feature\n\nTo enable the Secure Phone functionality properly, use it first on your corporate network or VPN to ensure proper certificate installation.\n\nVoice Recognition of Voicemail PIN\n\nVoice recognition for voicemail PIN is highly sensitive to background noise. The system may interpret background noise as user input, even when the user doesn't input anything. See System Administration Guide for Cisco Unity Connection to disable this function: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/unity-connection/products-maintenance-guides-list.html.\n\nDon't Use Intermediate Certificate Authorities with Unified CM\n\nCertificate validation windows you use a certificate from an intermediate certificate authority on Unified CM. Use a certificate that is signed with the root, rather than an intermediate certificate authority.\n\nJabber Account-Related Files Aren't Backed Up on iCloud and iTunes\n\nFrom Release 10.5 onward, all the Cisco Jabber account-related files aren't backed up on the iCloud and iTunes due to privacy reasons. This restriction includes files such as the Configuration, Contacts, Credentials, History, Logs, and Photo.\n\nDon't Use \"EC Only\" Key Order when Configuring Devices in Unified CM\n\nWhen you create devices for users in Unified CM 11.0, you can specify a key order as RSA Only, EC Only, EC Preferred, or RSA Backup. However, Jabber doesn't support the EC Only option. If you select it, the client fails to connect to the server.\n\nJabber Might Reconnect Slowly When a Device Moves Between Networks\n\nWhen you move between networks, for example, from WiFi to 3G, with Jabber in the background, the client disconnects from the servers. The client might not reconnect for several minutes which can lead to missed calls. To avoid missed calls, enable the Apple Push Notification service.\n\nCallKit Unavailable in China\n\nCallKit functionality is deactivated in China due to government regulations.\n\nMRA and WebEx Meetings with siteType “Orion”\n\nIf the meeting siteType is \"ORION\", then Jabber mobile clients can't start WebEx Meeting over Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access network.\n\nUse Single Number Reach on iOS for Maximum Reliability\n\nIf your users require 100% reliability in call notifications, enable the Single Number Reach (SNR) feature for Cisco Jabber running on iOS. SNR mitigates these limitations:\n\n§iOS may shut down Cisco Jabber and other applications that are running in the background to preserve resources. While the client attempts to relaunch, you might miss calls. To minimize the impact, enable Apple Push Notification service.\n\n§Without Apple Push Notifications (APNs), the device sometimes switches connection from the Wi-Fi data network to the mobile voice network while the device is in Sleep mode. You might miss incoming calls due to this issue. To prevent this issue, go to the iPhone Settings and turn off Cellular Data or alternatively turn on SNR.\n\n§The VPN can disconnect when Connect-On-Demand is enabled and the user changes networks. Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad may take up to 11 minutes to reconnect through the VPN. This issue can lead to missing incoming calls. This occurs when the Wi-Fi signal is not stable or sometimes the mobile network takes priority and it switches between Wi-Fi and mobile network, while Jabber is unable to quickly connect to phone services during the handover. After the client reconnects, users who have voicemail enabled receive voicemail notifications for any missed calls that went to voicemail. To minimize the time to reconnect, users can bring the app to the foreground after changing connection environments. To minimize the impact, enable Apple Push Notification service.\n\nDial via Office - Reverse (DVO-R) on iOS\n\nIf you are setting up Dial via Office - Reverse (DVO-R) on Unified CM consider the following:\n\n§The feature only applies to iPhone; it is not supported on iPad or iPod Touch devices because it requires that the device can access a mobile network.\n\n§The feature requires Unified CM Release 8.6.2 SU4, 9.1.2, or 10.x.\n\n§You can make DvO-R calls over Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access when you are outside corporate network. DVO-R is supported over Cisco Expressway X8.7 and Unified CM 11.0(1a)SU1.\n\n§DVO enabled devices may encounter issues registering with Unified CM 8.6 and above. Resetting the device from the Unified CM administrative interface fixes this issue.\n\n§You can't use the feature with the Secure Call feature. Secure calls can't be established if DVO-R is enabled.\n\n§If the user places a DVO-R call to an invalid phone number over a SIP trunk, a Unified CM limitation causes the user to hear several seconds of silence, instead of an audio message that the number was invalid.\n\niPhone—CM Node Failover Issue with Packet Loss\n\nIf Cisco Jabber on iPhone is unable to reach the primary subscriber due to packet loss, it does not failover to secondary CM node. For more information, see CSCux83785.\n\niPhone—Incoming Mobile Call Places Unified CM Call on Hold\n\nIf the user is on a Unified CM call and receives an incoming mobile call, iPhone starts ringing and prompts the user to answer or decline the mobile call. At the same time, the Unified CM call on Cisco Jabber goes on hold automatically.\n\nWhen you receive an incoming call on your iPhone, the iPhone automatically disables the microphone for all other applications. There is no time to inform your current caller that you need to take another call. If you accept the new incoming call, your Unified CM call in Jabber is automatically placed on hold, and you can't return to it until you end the iPhone call. To work around this issue, decline the call and then tap Resume so that your current caller can hear you again. If your device is locked, quickly press the On/Off Sleep/Wake button twice to decline the call, and then tap Resume.\n\niPhone—Turn on Jabber Sound Settings\n\nTo ensure that you do not miss incoming Cisco Jabber chats and calls, go to iOS Settings > Notification Center and check that the Cisco Jabber sound setting is turned on.\n\niPhone—Incoming Unified CM Calls Sent to Voicemail While on VoIP Call\n\nIf you receive a Unified CM call, while placing a VoIP call, the client sends the incoming call to voicemail. If you do not have voicemail, Jabber ignores the call.\n\niPhone—Maximum Participants for Ad-hoc Conference\n\nThe maximum number of participants for ad-hoc conferences is limited to three; this is the maximum number of calls for TCT devices. You can configure the maximum participants for ad-hoc conference on Unified CM in Service Parameter Configuration > Clusterwide Parameters > Maximum Ad Hoc Conference Required.\n\niPhone—Quality Issues on Some Connections\n\nVoice and video quality over non-corporate Wi-Fi or mobile data networks can't be guaranteed.\n\nThe quality of video calls varies depending on the network connection. Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can't troubleshoot video quality when you use 3G or 4G networks to connect Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad with Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client or another VPN client.\n\niPhone—SIP Digest Authentication\n\nSIP Digest Authentication is not supported.\n\niPhone—Device Capacity of Unified CM as a Directory Source\n\nUnified CM as a directory source is capable of scaling to 50% of the device capacity that a Unified CM node can handle.\n\niPhone—Call Notification When Device is Locked\n\nWhen the device is in Do Not Disturb (DND) mode and locked, it vibrates upon receiving a Cisco Jabber call.\n\niPhone—Jabber Relaunches After Hours in Background\n\nWhen in the background for a few hours, Jabber relaunches without notification.\n\nApple Watch—No Call Notifications\n\nWith iOS versions 10 and 11 with Cisco Jabber 12.0, you can't receive call notifications on Apple Watch because CallKit can’t work with Apple Watch. This is an Apple iOS limitation.\n\niPad—Inaccurate Status During Network Transitions\n\nWhen users transition between networks, their availability status may not be accurate.\n\nJabber With Cisco TelePresence System\n\nCisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad supports interoperability and optimal video quality with Cisco TelePresence System (CTS) devices if you use a TelePresence or video bridge to connect the devices. The number of devices that you can use for joining a video call will be determined by the Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) and settings defined for the conference bridge.\n\nConsult the Unified CM Administration documentation for details about setup.\n\niPad—Blocking and Deleting Contacts\n\nYou cannot block contacts who are within your own organization.\n\nIf you delete a group of contacts on a device other than an iPad, you might not see the change immediately in Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad. Sign out and then sign in again for the changes to take effect.\n\niPad—Don't Send Jabber to the Background Before the Current Operation Completes\n\nIf you start an action, such as signing in or tapping Webex Meeting to start a meeting, and then bring Cisco Jabber for iPhone and iPad to the background before the action completes, you can't successfully complete the action.\n\niPad—Starting Webex Meetings\n\nIf you tap Webex Meeting to start a meeting, the system sends a meeting invitation when either the meeting starts or 60 seconds has elapsed.\n\niPad—Recording Indicator Mistakenly Comes On When Jabber Put in the Background\n\nWhen on a Cisco Jabber call and you put Cisco Jabber to the background, sometimes the call indicator shows Cisco Jabber recording, depending on the iOS versions.\n\nMultiple Resource Login\n\nWhen a user signs in to multiple instances of the client at the same time, the chat feature behaves as follows:\n\n·The first incoming chat message is sent to all the clients.\n\n·The first client to reply to the incoming chat message gets all the subsequent messages. The other clients do not get these subsequent incoming messages.\n\n·If the client does not use the chat feature for 5 minutes, the next incoming message is sent to all the clients again.\n\nContact Resolution for Enterprise Groups\n\nJabber resolves contacts in enterprise groups individually rather than all at once. As a result, when you add an enterprise group to your users' contact lists—or if they clear their local cache—they'll only see the username and domain for each person until they hover over or interact with them.\n\n168 Byte Limit for Transferred Filenames\n\nWhen transferring a file, the filename cannot exceed 168 bytes (including extension). If you attempt to send a file with a longer name, you are notified that you have exceeded 168 bytes.\n\nLimitations for Cloud Deployments\n\nThese limitations apply to all Jabber for iPhone and iPad on Webex Messenger and Team Messaging Mode deployments.\n\nApple Watch—Notifications Aren't Supported in TMM\n\nNotifications aren't supported on Apple Watch in Jabber Team Messaging Mode (TMM).\n\nCaveats\n\nSearch for Bugs\n\nTo search for bugs not listed here, use the Bug Search Tool.\n\nProcedure\n\n1.
