        "text": "Background\n\nGG Allin was an American punk rock musician and songwriter who was known for engaging in shocking acts, including self-mutilation and assaulting his audience during his stage performances.\n\nAllin’s birth name was Jesus Christ, given to him by his father after claiming that Jesus had visited him and told him that his son would be great. Allin grew up alongside his older brother, Merle Jr, who was unable to pronounce the name “Jesus” properly and called him “Jeje” instead, which later became “GG.” Allin and his family lived in a log cabin in Groveton, New Hampshire with no electricity or water. The father was an abusive fanatic who threatened the family with death. According to Allin, his father wanted to kill his family in a murder-suicide.\n\nIn 1961, Allin’s parents divorced. His mother, Arleta took him and his brother to East St. Johnsbury and remarried. It was at this time that Allin developed an interest in music. He became a fan of popular bands in Britain including “Mott the Hoople” and “The Dave Clark Five.” In the early 1970s, GG started recording music with an acoustic guitar.\n\nIn 1975, Allin graduated from Concord High School and shortly after formed the band “Malpractice” alongside his older brother, a local musician called Jeff Penney, and a high school friend called Brian Demurs. Allin served as the drummer until the band separated in 1977. Three years later, Allin released his debut album called “Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be.” He went on to release more hit albums until his death on June 28, 1993."
