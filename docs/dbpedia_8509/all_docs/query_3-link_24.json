        "text": "I've had 5 calls from a username \"Jabber\" on my FaceTime contact list. These are all using different contact names or phone numbers, one of which is actually similar to, but not my actual, gmail user name. I have rarely used FaceTime. The calls fall in a period from May, 2013 to April, 2020. \"Jabber\" is not in my contact list, and the addresses he uses do not appear on the list of contacts that can be blocked. Should I be concerned?\n\nHi there chuckdemin,\n\nWe understand you're experiencing an issue with an unknown caller showing in your FaceTime history, and we'd like to see if we can assist.\n\nDo you use FaceTime on any other devices? If so, do you see the same history details there?\n\nAlso, check out this article for more information about maintaining your Apple ID security: Security and your Apple ID\n\nThis page can also help to confirm your Apple ID is only signed in to recognized devices: Check your Apple ID device list to see where you're signed in\n\nCheers!"
