        "text": "Jeremy Vreeken – Columnist\n\nLet’s start at the beginning… For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Jeremy Vreeken. I am an undeclared sophomore here at Dordt College. I am from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. If you don’t know where that is, Google probably does. `What can I tell you about myself? I like longboarding, listening to indie music, drinking coffee and having good chats with friends. I also have been known to enjoy taking long walks on the beach, drinking piña colada and getting caught in the rain. Just kidding. Or maybe not.\n\nI am very excited to be a part of the staff here at The Diamond this year. I am going to do my best to write about things that, if not always insightful, are at least entertaining; I hope to write something that will keep you picking up The Diamond each time it comes out.\n\nWell, two weeks of school have already passed us by, two weeks that have (if you’re anything like me) been full of syllabi, wrong classrooms, missing important deadlines, catching up with old friends, and sweating. If you are a nurse, athlete, freshman, or all of the above, then you have been here even longer. However long you’ve been here at Dordt, I hope it has been a good time. I also hope that you are looking forward to the rest of the year as much as I am. There are so many things to do, people to meet, donut runs and Dordt walks to go on, choir and band concerts to attend, plays to watch, and friends to make; be sure to take advantage of what this year has in store!\n\nTo quote the movie Dead Poets Society, that one guy who said that one thing one time, and all those people with those bad tattoos, carpe diem! Seize the day. The phrase sounds so cheesy but it actually holds a lot of value. Get involved, meet people, stay up late, pull crazy pranks, solidify friendships and make crazy memories; after all, isn’t college really more about the memories, relationships and wild stories than the education anyway? You decide.\n\nOne potential way to get involved is to drop me a line. I want your take and input on my column. Is there something you want me to look in to? Talk about? An issue I should discuss? Whatever it is, send me an email, catch me around campus, or find me on Facebook, and I’ll see what I can do!\n\nUntil next time, thanks for reading and have a great day! Go ahead and pass this paper to someone who hasn’t read it yet. In the words of Ron Burgundy, “You stay classy, Dordt College!”"
