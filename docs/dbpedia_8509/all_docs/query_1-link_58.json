        "text": "Oh boy, where to start indeed. Try :\n\nGG Allin & The Murder Junkies ‎– Terror In America\n\nLower your expectations, as this sounds like it was recorded from the soundboard, but not an actual soundboard recording. Allin really wasn't a singer, but more of a performance artist so to say he was a vocallist is a bit of a stretch. Yet, the band sounds reasonably good. I'm not sure past the spectacle how serious you take Allin? Yet, give it a try and see what impression you get. At the end of the day would it be fair to say that GG was little more than a horribly damaged, pathetic junkie, with deep psychological issues, or a true anarchist? Maybe the attached picture might help you decide.\n\nI love the early GG Allin stuff. I have most if not all the early GG Allin cd releases, many of which are rare and will cost you a bit - especially the first album, \"Always Was, Is And Always Shall be,\" which you kind of have to pay up for, if you want a good version of it.\n\nThe currently and most recently available cd on Halycon records is at the wrong speed and to be avoided.\n\nThe best way to get it, with un-futzed with sound, is with this particular cd:\n\nGG Allin - Banned In Boston Part 1\n\nIt has all of his debut album, \"Always Was...,\" (in a mixed up order) and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nThis next earlier release of the above disc has additional material and only misses one song from his debut\n\nGG Allin - Insult & Injury Volume 1 - 1977 - 1982 Banned In Boston\n\nThose cd's are rich with GG Allin material. They rock. It contains a great deal of his early, studio, material in the best sound you'll find.\n\nI made my own playlist and put the songs in the correct order to make a stand alone version of the first \"Always Was...,\" album.\n\nIf you want to continue after hearing the above, the next available, early album, is \"EMF.\"\n\nThis one might be more easily available but it could be out of print, too.\n\nGG Allin - E.M.F.\n\nThis next, kind of rare, compilation, is of late 70's or early 80's through mid 80's material. It is still fairly melodic but you can hear the direction is changing. If you like the cd's I listed above, this is a great comp. It might be stronger than \"EMF\" due to it's wide range of material:\n\nGG Allin - Dirty Love Songs\n\nAs mentioned above, \"Hated in the Nation\" is good, as well, and mines the same ground as \"Dirty Love Songs,\" above. It should be one of the easiest to find, I think. \"Hated...\" has some pretty funny moments, as I recall.\n\nKeep in mind the top two cd's are different than the bottom 3, which become more confrontational and nasty. The GG Allin debut, \"Always Was...\" and the material around it almost sound like it wants to be taken seriously, in at least in the punk rock genre."
