        "text": "Fascinating insights from Rightmove's recent stats! üè° The data reveals a remarkable Boxing Day, breaking records with a 26% increase in new property listings compared to the previous year. üìà In the estate agency realm, there's an ongoing debate about the trend of listing properties on Boxing Day. More listings mean increased confidence among sellers, indicating a promising trend for market movement. Those who hesitated in 2023 due to affordability concerns are now actively entering the market üí∏. Moreover, a noteworthy 17% surge in buyer inquiries this year compared to the last adds another layer to the story. Balancing the market dynamics, a stable market is achieved when supply and demand align perfectly. Too much property and too few buyers can drive prices down, while the opposite can lead to price surges. As we keep a keen eye on these developments, it's exciting to see the trajectory pointing towards heightened market activity and stability. This creates a win-win situation for both buyers and sellers. My take? In 2024, my bet is on small growth rather than a price drop, aligning with the current trends. üî•\n\nThe below shows positive signs regarding the start of this year. Given the increased level of choice out there for buyers now it will be interesting to see where sellers choose to price their properties over the following months and what changes this has on their time to find a buyer.\n\nThe recent statistics from the property market showcase a noticeable uptick in activity post Christmas, aligning with the broader trends observed during this period. This resonates with my professional experiences as well, as there's been a steady flow of viewing requests, key handovers, and other appointments throughout the month. It seems that both buyers and sellers are keen to get a head start on their 2024 plans, indicating a solid and active start to the year in the property sector. #PropertyMarket #RealEstate #MarketTrends\n\nMy Boxing Day banter really got people's backs up. But nobody actually addressed my point. So, let's do it again... If you believe/are marketing that Boxing Day is a great day to be in the market or go on the market, and your ‚Äúoffice‚Äù is closed or you're not working/responding to client enquiries that day; that's idiotic. If you disagree that being CLOSED on a day you're punting out to clients as the day to be in/on the market is not actually about what is good for the client then I would absolutely love to hear why you disagree so. #estateagent #estateagents #estateagency"
