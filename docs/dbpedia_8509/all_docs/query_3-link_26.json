University IT provides support for a softphone through the Jabber application, allowing you to simulate your Stanford telephone using your iOS device.\n\nThe Jabber softphone feature is also available for Windows and Mac computers and Android mobile devices.\n\nPlace a call\n\nYou can place a softphone call in three ways:\n\nUSING YOUR CONTACTS LIST\n\nTap in the Jabber hub.\n\nTap the next to the appropriate contact’s name.\n\nTap the Call button .\n\nThe call is placed to the person’s Stanford telephone number.\n\nFor details on adding contacts to your Contacts list, see Managing Contacts.\n\nSEARCHING THE STANFORD JABBER DIRECTORY\n\nTap in the Jabber hub.\n\nType the person’s name in the Jabber hub Search or call field.\n\nTap the next to the appropriate contact’s name in the search results.\n\nTap the Call button.\n\nThe call is placed to the person’s Stanford telephone number.\n\nTYPING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER\n\nTap in the Jabber hub.\n\nTap in the Search or call field.\n\nTap .\n\nType the person’s phone number in the Jabber hub Search or call field.\n\nTap below the Search or call field.\n\nThe call is placed to the entered telephone number.\n\nReceive a call\n\nYou must be logged in to the Jabber application to receive a call using your softphone. Settings affect a telephone number regardless if they are set on your desk phone or your softphone. So, for example, if your forward your desk phone to voicemail, your softphone is also forwarded to voicemail and you will not receive calls. Changing the setting on one also changes the setting on the other.\n\nWhen you receive an incoming call, you’ll see a call window open on your device screen.\n\nTap Accept to accept the call.\n\nTap Decline to forward the call to voicemail.\n\nForward and unforward calls\n\nForwarding sends calls coming to your Stanford phone number to your Stanford voicemail or any other phone number you choose. Unforwarding your calls make them ring on both your desk phone and softphone (when active). Forwarding or unforwarding your calls on your desk phone or softphone affects both phones.\n\nFORWARDING YOUR CALLS\n\nTap in the Jabber hub (top left).\n\nTap Settings.\n\nTap Call Forwarding.\n\nTap New Number.\n\nTap Forward To.\n\nEnter a phone number, including 9, 1, area code and seven-digit phone number (e.g., 914159876543) and tap Done.\n\nUNFORWARDING YOUR CALLS\n\nTap in the Jabber hub (top left).\n\nTap Settings.\n\nTap Call Forwarding.\n\nTap Do Not Forward Calls.\n\nPlace a call on hold\n\nTap in the active call window.\n\nTap Hold.\n\nThe call is placed on hold. Click Resume to resume the call.\n\nNote: When you place someone on hold, they will hear music. If you are on a conference call and answer a second line, the conference call is placed on hold and the conference attendees hear the hold music.\n\nTransfer a call\n\nTransferring allows you to transfer a call from your softphone to any other phone on the Stanford system."
