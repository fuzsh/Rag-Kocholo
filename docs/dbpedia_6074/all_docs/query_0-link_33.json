        "text": "David Cameron will get to enjoy a raft of perks as he makes his return to Government as Foreign Secretary.\n\nThe former PM who is no longer an MP has formally taken his place in the House of Lords in a ceremony this afternoon.\n\nHis shock appointment last week came as Mr Sunak held a major Cabinet reshuffle as he finally sacked Suella Braverman as Home Secretary.\n\nThe peer, who left No10 in 2016 in the wake of the Brexit referendum, has been put in charge of the country’s foreign policy despite mistakes including cosying up to China in what was dubbed a “golden era”.\n\nHis attempts to make money after Downing Street included working for the now collapsed Greensill Capital, which saw him go on a desert camping trip with Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed Bin Salman just months after he was accused of ordering the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Following his appointment last week, Lord Cameron dismissed the criticism, saying: \"As far as I am concerned, that is all dealt with and in the past. I now have one job, as Britain's Foreign Secretary.\"\n\nHere we take a look at his new life as Foreign Secretary.\n\nGrand ceremony as he gets new title\n\nThe former Tory leader stepped down as an MP shortly after he left Downing Street in 2016, so he has been given a place in the House of Lords so he can make his return to Cabinet. It has been announced that his full title will be “The Right Honorable the Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton”.\n\nHe has chosen the Cotswold town as it lies within his former Witney constituency in Oxfordshire. During his time in office, he was known as a member of the so-called “Chipping Norton set”, an elite group who lived in the area that included former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.\n\nLord Cameron took his place in the House of Lords this afternoon in his \"Introduction\" ceremony. He processed into the House dressed in ceremonial ermine robes between two supporters who are existing peers, before swearing an oath of allegiance to the King.\n\nHe is a life peer and will get to remain a member after he finishes his time as Foreign Secretary.\n\nSix-figure salary\n\nAs a Cabinet minister in the House of Lords, Lord Cameron will get paid £104,360-a-year.\n\nUnlike peers who do not have salaries, he will not be able to claim the £342 daily attendance allowance for turning up.\n\nDowning Street has said that during his time back in Government he will no longer claim the £115,000-a-year allowance that former-PMs get to run an office.\n\nFake No10 with its own ballroom\n\nHe may be more used to 10 Downing Street from his time as PM, but Lord Cameron will get his own official residence in central London. As Foreign Secretary he will have the use of 1 Carlton Gardens, which is tucked just off The Mall a short distance from Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe grace-and-favour property contains a ballroom, two dining rooms and a three-bedroom apartment. It has been the official residence of the Foreign Secretary since 1945 when Ernest Bevin complained about his “shabby flat” in Downing Street.\n\nAlthough some ministers have chosen to stay in their own homes, only using it for official engagements, such as meetings with senior representatives of foreign governments. The 1830 property is leased by the Foreign Office from the Crown Estate, which looks after the King’s properties. It was designed by architect John Nash, and was once a shelter for Louis Napoleon, later Emperor Napoleon III of France.\n\nCountry retreat to schmooze celebrity pals\n\nAt the weekends, Lord Cameron who famously enjoys “chillaxing” will be able to unwind at Chevening, the Foreign Secretary’s country pile. The palatial property near Sevenoaks in Kent is set in 3,000 acres and boasts 115 rooms. The grounds include a tennis court, lake and a maze, as well as a formal garden and kitchen garden.\n\nThe grace-and-favour residence was bequeathed to the nation by the Earl of Stanhope ahead of his death in 1967 so that it could be used by future Cabinet ministers. The peer had served in roles including First Lord of the Admiralty and Lord President of the Council in the Governments of Neville Chamberlain, Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin.\n\nThe country residence is similar to Chequers, the weekend retreat used by Prime Ministers. When Lord Cameron was in office he is said to have thrown an Ibiza-style rave at the property to celebrate his wife Samantha’s 40th birthday in 2014. He invited 200 guests including Mr Clarkson, comedian Harry Enfield and Harry Potter actress Helen Bonham Carter. Other showbiz mates entertained at Chequers during his time as PM included BBC presenter Clare Balding, former rugby union captain Will Carling and cricketer Darren Gough.\n\nCam Force One\n\nThe Government spent £10million refitting an RAF plane so that it could be used by VIPs when Lord Cameron was PM. But he only got to fly on the aircraft nicknamed Cam Force One during one trip as he attended a Nato summit in Warsaw, Poland, a few days before he left No10 in July 2016.\n\nThe Voyager is shared by senior Government ministers and members of the Royal Family and provides air-to-air refuelling for other RAF planes when it is not carrying important dignitaries. It is based on an Airbus A330 with a first class cabin for the PM or leading VIP on the flight, with club class seating for business delegates and conventional economy class seating at the rear, used typically by the Press."
