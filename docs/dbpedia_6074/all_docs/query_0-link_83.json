        "text": "The next installment of the campaign for my 2015 election.\n\nMarch 31st - first day of the campaign\n\nBBC NEWS - SMOOTH START ON CAMERON BATTLE BUS\n\nDavid Cameron with the Conservative candidate for Chippenham.\n\nDay one set the tone for David Cameron's campaign for another term as prime minister. Every moment was carefully planned and controlled, from the formalities at Westminster to the first rally at a target seat in Wiltshire.\n\nHe will say that the Conservatives' economic policies are cutting the deficit, reducing unemployment and creating economic growth.\n\nHe will warn that Labour would put that at risk and bring economic chaos. And he will set out the \"stark choice\" of either himself or Ed Miliband holding the reins of power in Downing Street.\n\nDavid Cameron speaks at a rally at a school in Wiltshire.\n\nThe first rally of the campaign was at a school at Chippenham in Wiltshire, where the Conservatives are hoping to overturn Duncan Hames's Liberal Democrat majority of just over 2,400.\n\nCameron hopes by emphasizing the Government's economic record, the Conservatives will be able to take votes from Labour and the Lib Dems, allowing them to win a majority. However, his message will have its first big test on Thursday, when Cameron goes into battle with 6 other party leaders in the first televised debate. Only then will we see if it works.\n\nBBC NEWS - CAMPAIGNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\nHere we look at who is where and what they are doing.\n\nNick Clegg at the West Hertfordshire Hospital with the Liberal Democrat candidate for Watford.\n\nNick Clegg, this morning, began the Lib Dem campaign by speaking about his party's commitment to both the NHS and their backing for £3bn for mental health services in the next parliament. He then visited the West Hertfordshire Hospital with the candidate for Watford, Dorothy Thornhill.\n\nConservative Chancellor George Osborne prepares a pizza during a visit to a Pizza Express restaurant in Hove, East Sussex.\n\nThe chancellor, George Osborne, announced a commitment to help businesses and their staff in Hove. Afterwards, he campaigned in the seaside town, visiting businesses and taking questions from members of the public.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband on the Labour Battle Bus in Manchester.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband visited Manchester on his party's battle bus. Earlier, in a radio interview, he said politicians \"can get obsessed with themselves\", adding: \"It becomes a personality contest and it's not about us but the British people.\"\n\nAnother installment\n\nApril 1 - second day of campaign\n\nTHE DAILY TELEGRAPH - SENIOR BUSINESSMEN HAIL CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES\n\nA Labour government would “threaten jobs and deter investment” in the UK, a coalition of more than 100 of the country’s most senior business figures warn.\n\nIn a letter to The Telegraph, senior executives from companies employing more than half-a-million people hail Conservative economic policies which they say show that “the UK is open for business”.\n\nThe letter, signed by 103 business leaders, praises David Cameron and George Osborne’s decision cut to Corporation Tax and warns that a “change in course” would “put the recovery at risk”.\n\nCorporation tax will fall to 20 per cent. Mr Miliband and Mr Balls have said that Labour will reverse the cut if the party wins the May 7 general election. When the coalition took office it was 28 per cent.\n\nThe letter is the biggest ever endorsement by business leaders of a political party and will further undermine the economic credibility of Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor.\n\nIn a further blow to Mr Miliband, the letter has been signed by at least five business leaders who previously backed Labour, including Sir Charles Dunstone, the chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk plc, and Duncan Bannatyne, a former star of Dragons’ Den.\n\nThe list also includes Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg, the corporation where Mr Miliband chose to unveil his business manifesto on Monday.\n\nThe letter comes just a day after official figures showed that the UK economy is growing faster than expected and that household disposable income in back to pre-2010 levels.\n\nIt came as Labour said that it would introduce a new law to ban zero hours contracts for staff after 12 weeks in work, in a move that will further harm it's relationship with British businesses, which has become increasingly strained under Mr Miliband's leadership.\n\nOn Monday Mr Miliband faced a backlash from company bosses who had featured in a Labour advertisement about the risks of leaving the EU and he has faced repeated accusations from company bosses that he is anti-business.\n\nPrevious election campaigns have been marked by interventions from business leaders and under the leaderships of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour regularly received the backing of Britain’s biggest companies.\n\nHowever, the letter says that the last five years of Conservative-led government have “supported investment and job creation”.\n\nThe signatories include senior executives from nine FTSE 100 companies and 21 FTSE 250 companies as well as small and medium sized businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n-----------------\n\nThe letter in full\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe run some of the leading businesses in the UK. We believe this Conservative-led Government has been good for business and has pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation.\n\nDavid Cameron and George Osborne’s flagship policy of progressively lowering Corporation Tax to 20% has been very important in showing the UK is open for business. It has been a key part of their economic plan.\n\nThe result is that Britain grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85m new jobs.\n\nWe believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk.\n\n-----------------\n\nLabour on Monday launched its business manifesto in London but immediately faced criticism over a full-page advert the party had taken out in the Financial Times featuring quotes from a number of UK business leaders.\n\nHowever, within hours four of the six company bosses had distanced themselves from the advertisement and Labour because of concerns they were being used for political ends.\n\nSiemens UK, the electronics company, accused Labour of “overstepping the line” and said it had not been told that the quote would be used in a political advert.\n\nKellogg’s, the breakfast cereal company, said that “eyebrows had been raised” when the quote was used.\n\nMr Miliband has faced months of criticism from business figures after he criticised the tax status of Stefano Pessina, the Boots boss who warned that the Labour leader would be a “catastrophe” for Britain.\n\nMr Balls was also embarrassed earlier this year when he failed to name a single businessman that back Labour, instead referring to “Bill somebody”.\n\nMeanwhile, George Osborne on Tuesday hailed official ONS figures which disclosed that GDP has increased by 2.8 per cent over 2014, up from forecasts of 2.6 per cent.\n\nAverage household incomes are now higher than they were in 2010, a milestone hailed by Mr Osborne as \"good news for families and businesses across the country\".\n\nThe ONS also disclosed that household spending has grown by 0.6 per cent, or £1.6 billion, in the fourth quarter of last year, driven by a huge rise in people buying life insurance as the economy recovers.\n\nMr Osborne said: \"We've got a hat-trick of good news about the British economy and with 37 days to go the election it's another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk.”\n\nHe added: “So voters now face a stark choice: do we stick with a plan which is working, delivering growth and jobs, or do we put all that at risk with Ed Miliband whose policies of more spending, more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos.\"\n\nBBC NEWS - CAMPAIGNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\nHere we look at who is where and what they are doing.\n\nEd Miliband gestures during a question and answer session at the engineering company David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield.\n\nEd Miliband, the Labour leader, spent the morning at engineering company David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield where he talked about his party's tax plans. He said it was time that the UK returned to being a country that properly \"rewards hard work\".\n\nDavid Cameron's wife, Samantha, meets Jessica at the Abbey Court School during a campaign stop in Rochester and Strood.\n\nSamantha Cameron was at a school in Kent as she made her first solo appearance on the campaign trail. The prime minister's wife was throwing her support behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst in Rochester and Strood, the seat lost to UKIP last autumn after Mark Reckless defected from the Tories.\n\nDavid Cameron visits Marston's brewery in Wolverhampton where the Conservatives are defending the key seat of Wolverhampton SW. They are also targeting the key seat of Wolverhampton NE.\n\nMeanwhile, her husband was visiting Marston's brewery in Wolverhampton. David Cameron welcomed a letter signed by 100 business leaders and published in the Daily Telegraph that backed the coalition government's reductions in corporation tax since 2010.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg alongside local MP Jo Swinson at Playtown in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire.\n\nJournalists in Glasgow questioned the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Jo Swinson, the party's candidate for East Dunbartonshire, at a coffee shop. After lunch, Mr Clegg and Ms Swinson met parents at a local playgroup, a good place to talk about the Lib Dem proposal to triple paternity leave to six weeks.\n\nPolling\n\nYougov/The Sun - 30th and 31st March\n\nConservative 37%\n\nLabour 34%\n\nLib Dem 7%\n\nUKIP 12%\n\nGreen 5%\n\nOther 5%\n\nMore polls are due out tomorrow."
