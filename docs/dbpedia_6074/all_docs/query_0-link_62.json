        "text": "David Cameron is making a shock return to frontline politics this morning, seven years after he stepped down as Prime Minister.\n\nPolitical onlookers’ jaws dropped when they saw the ex-premier walking into No 10 this morning, with immediate speculation he would replace James Cleverly as Foreign Secretary.\n\nA statement from No. 10 this morning confirmed: \"The King has been pleased to approve the appointment of the Rt Hon David Cameron as Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs.\"\n\nMr Cleverly was moved from the Foreign Office to replace Suella Braverman at the Home Office, following her brutal sacking this morning.\n\nIt also set out that Mr Cameron has been made a peer, adding: \"His Majesty has also been pleased to confer the dignity of a Barony of the United Kingdom for life upon David Cameron.\"\n\nDavid Cameron has been appointed a member of the House of Lords in order to take the role.\n\nSky News's Alastair Bruce explained how Mr Cameron can become Foreign Secretary despite not being an MP: \"A peerage can be granted by the King on advice of the prime minister. A patent of creation under the great seal can follow after a title is agreed.\n\n\"A Garter King of Arms ceremony of Introduction into the House of Lords, including the oath, can also be organised quite fast.\"\n\nMr Cameron's return has sparked comparisons to Gordon Brown bringing back Peter Mandelson in 2008, when his government was also facing an uphill struggle with public opinion ahead of the election.\n\nRishi Sunak's decision to bring back David Cameron to the role of Foreign Secretary is brave, given the former PM's outspoken opposition to a number of the Government's key policies.\n\nLast month he slammed Mr Sunak's move to cut HS2's Manchester branch, calling it the wrong decision and adding: \"In years to come I suspect many will look back at today’s announcement and wonder how this once-in-a-generation opportunity was lost.\"\n\nHe is also a keen advocate of spending 0.7 percent of GDP on overseas aid, something the Government has cut to 0.5 percent despite outrage from opposition parties.\n\nMr Cameron is the first ever life peer to hold a Great Office of State, a role no peer has held since Lord Carrington in 1982.\n\nThe last Prime Minister to accept a position in Government after they left No. 10 was Alec Douglas-Home, who served as PM from 1963 to 1964.\n\nHe returned as Ted Heath's Foreign Secretary in his 1970 Government."
