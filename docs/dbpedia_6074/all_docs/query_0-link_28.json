        "text": "David Cameron has become the UK's Foreign Secretary, seven years after leaving office and the Houses of Parliament.\n\nMr Cameron, 57, was appointed to the role of Britain's top diplomat by Rishi Sunak on Monday morning.\n\nIt came after the Prime Minister had fired Suella Braverman, with then-Foreign Secretary James Cleverly moving across SW1 to fill her role.\n\nMr Cameron stepped down from being an MP in September 2016, a few months after he quit as Prime Minister.\n\nRead more: David Cameron made foreign secretary in shock move amid Rishi Sunak's cabinet reshuffle\n\nRead more: Andrew Marr: Rishi rolls the dice by bringing Cameron back - but a more troubling question remains...\n\nDoes a Cabinet minister have to be an MP?\n\nUsually, and especially in recent decades, Cabinet ministers are MPs and fulfil two roles - serving their constituents, who elect them, and the Prime Minister, who appoints them to their government jobs.\n\nBut they can also be members of the House of Lords, although this is unusual in modern times.\n\nMr Cameron was not a peer before he was appointed to be Foreign Secretary on Monday morning, and there was no chance of him being elected to the House of Commons again at such short notice.\n\nSo Mr Sunak made him a baron, meaning he is now Lord Cameron and is entitled to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament.\n\nIn recent times, there is usually only one Cabinet minister who is a peer, rather than an MP - the leader of the Lords. Lord True currently fulfils this role.\n\nHow unusual is it for Lords to be ministers?\n\nIt is quite common for Lords to be junior ministers - in fact most government departments have at least one minister who sits in the upper chamber.\n\nThey deal with government business in the Lords and answer questions posed by peers about government business.\n\nBefore David Cameron, were there other Foreign Secretaries who were in the House of Lords?\n\nAlthough unusual, it is not unprecedented for Foreign Secretaries to be peers instead of MPs.\n\nExamples from the past century include: Lord Carrington, who served under Margaret Thatcher from 1979-82, Lord Home, who was Foreign Secretary from 1960-63, Lord Halifax, who held the post from 19308-40, Lord Reading, who served in 1931, and Lord Curzon, from 1919-24.\n\nIt was quite common in the 18th and 19th centuries for Foreign Secretaries to come from the House of Lords.\n\nPrime Ministers also often came from the House of Lords, rather than the Commons - but the most recent example was Lord Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, who retired in 1902.\n\nLord Home became Prime Minister in 1963, but renounced his peerage in order to do so.\n\nAre there other recent precedents for David Cameron's appointment?\n\nLabour Prime Minister Gordon Brown made Peter Mandelson a peer in 2008 so that he could serve as Business Secretary.\n\nLord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, had quit the House of Commons in 2004 to serve as the UK's European Commissioner.\n\nWill David Cameron be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as if he were an MP?\n\nMr Cameron will still have to appear before the House of Lords to answer questions about government business posed to him by fellow peers.\n\nBut his appearances are unlikely to be with the same regularity as in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Cameron is likely to delegate much of the everyday business of his department to Andrew Mitchell, the development secretary, who sits in the Commons.\n\nBut Mr Cameron will still be expected to give media interviews, so will be subject to scrutiny on that front."
