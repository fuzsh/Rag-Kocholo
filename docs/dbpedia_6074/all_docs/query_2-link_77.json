        "text": "Cameron Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Cameron is a boy's name of Scottish origin meaning \"crooked nose\".\n\nWith its friendly, sensitive, and approachable feel, Cameron is a 90’s favorite that remains popular today. It has a pleasing balance of soft and strong sounds, and holds unisex appeal, thanks to Cameron Diaz. Still, ten times more boys than girls are named Cameron in the US.\n\nDerived from a Scottish surname which in turn comes from the name of a West Highland Clan, Cameron means “crooked nose” in Gaelic.\n\nNot the best of meanings, perhaps, but it is likely to have originated from a nickname given to an 8th century member of the clan. Such nicknames were common in Highland culture, and it lends the name a rugged, outdoorsy feel.\n\nUsed sporadically in the early half of the 20th century, Cameron became a popular choice in Scotland from the 50’s onwards. Shortly afterward, it began to accelerate up the US charts, really taking off in the 90’s, and peaking at #31 in the year 2000.\n\nIts popularity spread to Australia, England and Wales, Canada, and to France too, where it remained a top choice into the early 2010’s. Since then, it has been on a mostly downwards trajectory, though it is still given to 5000 boys – and 600 girls – in the US every year.\n\nMany will associate it with Cameron Frye, the anxious, slightly awkward, but good-hearted best friend in the movie Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. Actress Cameron Diaz is another memorable namesake, whose fame popularized Cameron as an option for girls too.\n\nA favorite in the sporting world, the name is worn by American footballer Cameron Jerell Newton, tennis player Cameron Norrie, and Olympic swimmer Cameron McEvoy, just to list a few.\n\nThese sporty associations help to give Cameron an energetic vibe to complements its soft and calmer sounds, giving it a more “all-rounder” feel."
