However dh LOVES Cameron for a boy.\n\nI'm in two minds. I kind of like it. But then I've also associated the name with David Cameron for some reason and it's putting me off. ( not that I dislike him that much really)\n\nI know boys and girls called Cameron. I would associate it with the current PM, but who knows if the Tories lose the election he will get booted out and no one will even think of him in a couple of years.\n\nI really like it. You could associate any name with someone if you tried hard enough. I know a couple of boys called Cameron, and one girl (but I am in Scotland).\n\nYeah I just think of David, sorry :-( and even when he gets booted out I think he'll still be remembered unfortunately - if you think of Gordon, Tony etc...even Blair actually, I know someone with a daughter by that name and that was my first thought so you can't necessarily think that the association will disappear just because he's not PM anymore…\n\nAlthough \"Cam\" makes me think of Cam from Modern Family and he's brilliant so there is that!\n\n(I like to try to be balanced haha!)\n\nYes it does make me think of him, however, as a pp said, you could find an association for most names. Someone said to me I like the name Ester, my first thought (ranzen). So bear in mind it may be peoples first reaction, but don't let it put you off if you love it!\n\nIt would have been on my list, had it not been for a close relative whose name is Cameron - it's a lovely name.\n\nI don't think David Cameron should cause you to avoid using the name he'll be gone next year hopefully ."
