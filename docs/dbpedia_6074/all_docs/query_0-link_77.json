        "text": "DAVID Cameron's former Communications Chief has said that the British public feel that an election promise has been shattered with the rise in National Insurance.\n\nPhilip Hammond is facing a furious backlash from the public and his own MPs over a decision to change taxes for the self-employed.\n\nSir Craig Oliver told BBC Newsnight last night that the Chancellor couldn't hide away from the public's perception of the policy.\n\nHe said: \"Philip Hammond... thinks he is a position where he can explain to people, 'here is a path I took and this is why is not a breach of a manifesto promise'.\n\n\"The problem with this is... people perceive this to be a breach.\"\n\nHe went on: \"They feel that when they look specifically at what was written, you have breached that.\n\n\"The problem again with that is that people start asking questions about... well, can we trust you?\"\n\nIn the 2015 election, Mr Cameron's party promises to a five year \"tax lock\" - meaning no increases in VAT, income tax or national insurance.\n\nThe news comes after the former Prime Minister appeared to be caught on camera yesterday said that breaking a \"manifesto promise is stupidity\".\n\nThe animated former PM was seen ranting to Defence Secretary Micheal Fallon at yesterday's war memorial unveiling ceremony.\n\nSince the Chancellor revealed the changes in Wednesday's Budget, he has faced a furious backlash from the public and his MPs.\n\nToday the Sun launches a campaign to demand that Mr Hammond axe the tax raid - as we reveal the plight of struggling 2.4million grafters.\n\nJoining forces to ramp up the pressure, The Sun today calls on readers to display our campaign bumper sticker that reads: “Stop Hammond’s White Van Scam.”\n\nLast night Theresa May defended the Chancellor's hike to National Insurance, saying the changes would be \"simpler, fairer and more progressive\" - but has delayed legislation to avoid a potential rebellion.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Brussels last night, the Prime Minister backed the controversial policy to raise taxes on self-employed workers despite a considerable backlash from Tory MPs.\n\nBut legislation to enforce it will now not be introduced until the autumn, she promised, after a key report on self-employed workers’ rights is delivered and acted on.\n\nJoin our fight to stop the tax raid\n\nBACK our campaign to axe the Chancellor’s tax raid by claiming your free bumper sticker at sunoffers.co.uk/whitevanscam.\n\nTerms and conditions will be on our website."
