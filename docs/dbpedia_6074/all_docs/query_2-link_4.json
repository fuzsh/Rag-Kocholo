        "text": "badg3r Â· 11/03/2017 20:16\n\nOn my third iteration of potentials now for dc2, will find out the sex when they arrive. I am NOT GOOD at settling on names!\n\nWhat do you think of Cameron? Is it becoming super common? What nicknames would they get apart from Cam/Cammy?\n\nI know a couple of Cameron's, but don't think it's a massively common name. I like it. Think they would get Cam, Cammy sounds a bit girly and like Tammy.\n\nI think it's quite a nice name. But I imagine people will think you're a Tory.\n\nI have one. Not sure how common it is now, mine is in his 20s. No one has ever mentioned the Tories or David Cameron. It's a lovely name, IMHO.\n\nI'd not even thought of the David Cameron association... May is out for a girl then too\n\nMy little brother (aged 15) is a Cameron. He doesn't get it shortened. It's quite a common name in Scotland for his age group - think it was most popular name in 2001, or something.\n\nI do really like it and we had it on our list (it would have honoured a family member) until David Cameron came on the scene and it really spoilt it for us.\n\nIf you don't mind that association then use it.\n\nYes it is the Scottish connection that I like, we are unfortunately unlikely to live there though so common in Scotland not a problem. I think there were two in my school year (a while ago now!) so I guess it has become more popular since I left.\n\nI think of David Cameron too (which puts me off). But as the years go by this won't occur to people as much."
