        "text": "The annual New Year’s Honours list often contains the names of civil servants who have been awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire) or OBE (Order of the British Empire) honour for services rendered to the Government and people of the United Kingdom. Hairdressers, on the other hand, rarely make it to Buckingham Palace to collect an award from the Queen.\n\nThe 2014 list, however, contains the name of a certain Lino Carbosiero who is to receive an MBE for “services to hairdressing”. Carbosiero is currently Prime Minister David Cameron’s personal hairdresser, perhaps explaining in part his nomination.\n\nCameron’s receding hairline\n\nCameron has shown signs of a receding hairline\n\nfor several years, but it is thanks to Carbosiero that the most obvious signs have remained hidden. Somewhat surprisingly, early attempts at concealing hair loss were made by another hairdresser, Tony Tahir, who convinced the Prime Minister to switch from a parting on the right to a parting on the left in 2007. This simple change immediately hid the most noticeable hair loss at the front of Cameron’s head.\n\nCameron also briefly tried a centre parting in 2008, before securing the services of Lino Carbosiero in 2010. Since that time, Carbosiero has battled to minimise the effect of Cameron’s receding hairline. He has also had to contend with a rapidly spreading bald patch on Cameron’s crown a classic sign of male pattern balding.\n\nSince he has been retained as hairdresser to the Prime Minister, Carbosiero has had to contend with Cameron’s default hairstyle: a swept back affair, not unlike that worn by former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine. For the most part however, Carbosiero has been extremely successful at masking the developing bald patch.\n\nBlazing a trail"
