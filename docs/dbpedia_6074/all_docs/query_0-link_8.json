        "text": "David Cameron has returned to the cabinet table for the first time in more than seven years on Tuesday after his recall to government.\n\nRishi Sunak met his new cabinet after a dramatic overhaul on Monday saw the former prime minister return to front-line politics.\n\nHe replaces James Cleverly, who was moved to be home secretary to take over from Suella Braverman.\n\nMrs Braverman was sacked following her criticism of the Metropolitan Police.\n\nGreeting his new set of ministers, the prime minister said: \"A warm welcome to those for whom it's their first cabinet and also a welcome to those for whom it may not be their first time.\"\n\nHe added that it would be \"an important week\" ahead with new inflation figures and the court's decision on the government's Rwanda policy expected on Wednesday.\n\nLord Cameron, as he is now known as of his appointment to the House of Lords on Monday, had been out of Parliament since he stood down as prime minister in 2016.\n\nHis return to politics came out of the blue, with Downing Street managing to prevent any rumours of the appointment from leaking, despite the fact the job offer was made last week.\n\nIn one fell swoop, No 10 revealed not only was the former prime minister entering the House of Lords, he would also be taking up one of the most senior jobs in government.\n\nWhile the news was still being digested in Westminster, Lord Cameron was carrying out official duties, including holding a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nThe pair \"reiterated the strength and depth of the relationship between the UK and the US\", the Foreign Office said, and spoke about the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"They discussed the conflict in the Middle East, Israel's right to self defence and the need for humanitarian pauses to allow the safe passage of aid into Gaza.\"\n\nIn a speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London on Monday night, Mr Sunak said he was \"pleased to have appointed a new foreign secretary\" and said the new cabinet is \"a united team\".\n\nRichard Holden, the newly-appointed Conservative Party chair, told BBC Breakfast that Lord Cameron had returned \"out of a sense of duty\" and would bring experience to the role.\n\nBut not everyone in the Conservative Party is pleased about the return of Lord Cameron and the new-look cabinet.\n\nOne backbencher, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, has already submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister, citing the sacking of Mrs Braverman. There would need to be 53 before his leadership is threatened.\n\nAnd Conservative former cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Tories were \"in danger of losing votes to the Reform party\".\n\nReform leader Richard Tice was \"as happy as can be\" when he saw him earlier, he told BBC Newsnight, adding: \"The champagne will be flowing in the Reform party headquarters tonight after what's been done today.\"\n\nOpposition parties have been quick to ask whether bringing back a prime minister who left office seven years ago is really the fresh start Mr Sunak claims to offer.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said voters would be \"wondering how David Cameron coming back into government will help them pay for their weekly shop\".\n\nShe added that the Conservatives were \"out of ideas\" and could not offer \"the change our country is crying out for\".\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it \"sounds like desperation\".\n\nThe Lib Dems are also calling for Lord Cameron's peerage to be blocked, referring to his lobbying for collapsed finance company Greensill Capital.\n\nLord Cameron said he had resigned from the various business and charitable roles - including president of the Alzheimer's Research UK - he had held since quitting as prime minister.\n\n\"I have one job - to be foreign secretary and work with the prime minister for the UK to be as secure and prosperous as possible in a difficult and dangerous world,\" he said.\n\nHe insisted the Greensill affair was \"in the past\" and had been \"dealt with\".\n\nOpposition parties and Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle have raised concerns about how MPs will be able to hold Lord Cameron to account, since he will sit as a peer rather than in the Commons.\n\nForeign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell, who will deputise for Lord Cameron in the Commons, said the new foreign secretary believed it was \"essential\" the department's work could be properly scrutinised."
