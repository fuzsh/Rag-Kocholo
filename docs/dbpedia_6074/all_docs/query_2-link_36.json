        "text": "International law firm Dorsey & Whitney LLP is pleased to announce that Hong Kong Capital Markets Partner David Cameron was named to India Business Law Journal's International A-List. The findings are based on interviews conducted by the India Business Law Journal and includes endorsements of many of the recognized lawyers and by those who nominated them. The full list of all 100 International A-List lawyers can be found here.\n\nMr. Cameron received many recommendations for his work. “David is an old hand in capital markets transactions globally and in India, in particular,” says Abhiroop Lahiri, a partner at IndusLaw. “Over almost two decades, David has worked on numerous securities offerings in Asia, including on some of the largest Indian IPOs and QIPs. Apart from his equity experience, David is one of the most knowledgeable high-yield lawyers in the subcontinent – the depth of his experience in debt transactions is staggering and his command over the product is almost effortless.”\n\nBrajendu Bhaskar, a counsel at Trilegal, gives a similar recommendation. “David is an experienced practitioner in capital markets in Asia and provides quality advice to both issuers and underwriters on complex securities offerings. He has especially made his name in the Indian markets, having advised marquee clients over the years.”\n\nDorsey’s experience in Indian capital markets is deep and spans over a decade. Dorsey offers a full service capital markets practice in key domestic and international financial centers. Companies turn to Dorsey for all types of equity offerings, including IPOs, secondary offerings (including QIPs and OFSs) and debt offerings, including investment grade, high-yield and MTN programs. Our capital markets clients globally range from emerging companies, Fortune 500 seasoned issuers, and venture capital and private equity sponsors to the underwriting and advisory teams of investment banks.\n\nIndia has emerged as one of Dorsey’s most important international practice areas and we view India as a significant market for our clients, both in and outside of India. Dorsey has become a key player in the Indian market, working with major global and local investment banks and Indian companies on a range of international securities offerings. Dorsey is recognized for having a market-leading India capital markets practice, as well as ample international M&A and capital markets experience in the United States, Asia and Europe."
