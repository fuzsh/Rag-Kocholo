He knew he wanted to be a physician from an early age. ‚ÄúFor me, being a doctor was truly a calling,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEver since I was a little kid, I have never wanted to be anything else. I find the human body fascinating and I get a deep sense of satisfaction helping people feel better.‚Äù When",

        "text": "06/25/2024\n\nDr. Cameron is absolutely amazing!! I saw him throughout my pregnancy and he delivered my baby. He was absolutely kind throughout the entire process and never once felt cold. He is extremely friendly and attentive to any concerns or questions that you have. It feels like he genuinely enjoys his job and wants to be talking and helping you and doesn't make it feel like it's simply a business exchange. If I ever have another baby I will one hundred percent go back to Dr Cameron. He truly made it a good it a good experience and was very knowledgeable and exceptional through the whole experience. He came to me highly recommended and I completely understand why.\n\n‚Äî Syd Mccaslin\n\n04/26/2024\n\nI absolutely love Dr. Cameron and his team! Even as a young 20 something woman, he still allowed me to pursue being sterilized. He understood me, and wanted whatever I felt was best for myself. He never once felt cold, or condescending. He‚Äôs very friendly, welcoming, and always has a smile. If you need an OB/GYN, I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Cameron and I will refuse to go anywhere else unless he recommends someone.\n\n‚Äî Anjaila Smith\n\n04/17/2024\n\nDr. Cameron is amazing! It is very difficult to find an obgyn that cares, and listens to your concerns and gives treatment options to help. Please see Dr. Cameron because he really is thorough, caring , professional and wants every patient to feel comfortable. I feel a lot less stressed out by seeing him and I won‚Äôt be going to another obgyn now.\n\n‚Äî Rachael Vickery\n\n03/16/2024\n\nI am a previous c-section mom and I looked up and down for a dr who would be willing to attempt a vbac and dr Cameron was the only one who said they would let me I delivered recently with a successful vbac with dr Cameron and his team and they were AMAZING!!! The team was so supportive and affirming thru it all even when I felt I couldn‚Äôt! Thank you Dr and team!!!\n\n‚Äî Tara Hall\n\n02/14/2024\n\nI think Dr Cameron is amazing I just had a hysterectomy done on the 31st of January and I have a blood clotting disorder and he did an amazing job because my recovery is going well and I get to go see him up for a follow-up appointment today I recommend him to anybody especially if they're a high risk patient. Thank you Dr Cameron\n\n‚Äî Katie Copeland\n\n02/02/2024\n\nI was able to have a successful vaginal delivery after having 2 c-sections, a lot of doctors wouldn‚Äôt even take a chance but Dr. Cameron did.! ü´∂üèΩ"
