She’s absolutely furious about that.”\n\nWhy has David Cameron been made a Lord?\n\nIt was revealed last week that he had been elevated to the Lords as a life peer to allow him to serve in Sunak’s Cabinet after he resigned as an MP in 2016.\n\nThe former Prime Minister will now be known as Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton after his official introduction, the name reflecting his long-held ties to the Cotswolds town in his former constituency, Witney.\n\nIn the House of Lords yesterday, Lord Cameron wore the traditional scarlet robes for the short ceremony as he swore the oath of allegiance to the King.\n\nHe read the traditional oath: “I, David, Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, do swear by almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to his majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law, so help me God.”\n\nWho is Samantha Cameron?\n\nSamantha is Lord Cameron’s wife – the couple have been married since 1996 after Samantha met her husband when she was a student.\n\nIn 2002, they welcomed their first child Ivan, who was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy – Ivan sadly died in hospital aged six in 2009.\n\nLord and Lady Cameron also have Nancy (born January 2004) and Arthur (born February 2006).\n\nIn 2010, they announced that they were expecting their fourth child. Samantha gave birth to Florence in August 2010.\n\nIn her career, Samantha served as creative director at British accessories brand Smythson of Bond Street, from 1997 until May 2010, reports Hello!\n\nThis won her a British Glamour Magazine Award for Best Accessory Designer in 2009.\n\nIn 2017, Samantha founded Cefinn, a contemporary womenswear brand based in London.\n\nThe name of the company is an acronym of her four children's names.\n\nWhen it comes to her charity work, Samantha is a patron for Revitalise and an ambassador for Save the Children."
