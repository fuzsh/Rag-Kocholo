        "text": "18th July 2011:\n\n\"We interrupt this news report with some breaking news. It has been announced that the Prime Minister David Cameron will shortly tender his resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. This move comes following the revelations of the News of the World hacking scandal which had direct involuntary Mr Cameron's PR Chief Andy Coulson, who had previously edited the paper. So far no further announcements or comments have been made. It is rumoured that the Foreign Secretary William Hague will succeed Mr Cameron as Prime Minister and Tory Leader, possibly on a purely interim bases.\"\n\n- BBC News report 13:05 PM\n\n\"This has come as a great shock to the whole government, David was a great Prime Minister who served honourably through some very troubling times. I do however believe what his decision is the right one and for the best.\"\n\n- Nick Clegg's reaction to David Cameron's resignation announcement, 13:16 PM\n\n\"Good afternoon, after much consultation with my friends, colleagues and family I have decided to tender my resignation as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party. I believed it was best that I go before more damage could be done to not only my party, but this government as a whole. As I bid my farewell to a position I have held for just over a year I would like to believe that under extraordinary circumstances I was able to serve to the best of my abilities and leave this country better off for it. The Foreign Secretary William Hague will take over as Prime Minister in interim until my party can elect a permanent successor. I trust whoever my successor may be will serve with honour and distinction, far better than I was able to do.\n\nThank you and goodbye.\"\n\n- David Cameron's resignation speech, 13:34 PM\n\n\"David Cameron's fourteen months as Prime Minister has been a Premiership of missed opportunities and out of touch policies. His horrendous austerity cuts have torn apart the low earners and middle classes of Britain, his lack of ideology, direction and real policy for economic growth has left this country a step behind in the world's recovery from the economic crash of 2008. He has failed to fix the economy and has left office in disgrace.\"\n\n- Ed Miliband's reaction to David Cameron's resignation, 13:42 PM\n\n\"It is now just gone two o'clock and David Cameron has just left No.10 for the last time as Prime Minister. He will now go to Buckingham Palace to formerly tender his resignation. After just fourteen months in office his Premiership remains one of the shortest on record. He is also one of the youngest former Prime Ministers in history.\n\nFollowing his resignation the Foreign Secretary William Hague will make his journey to Buckingham Palace where Her Majesty the Queen will ask to form a new government. So far the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has made no comment on the future of the Coalition Government following Mr Cameron's resignation and it is already rumoured that a new Conservative Minority Government is being formed with the new cabinet already being formed.\"\n\n- BBC News report 14:00 PM\n\n\"And now the Foreign Secretary William Hague begins his journey to Buckingham Palace to be formerly asked by the Queen to form a government. Mr Hague was formerly leader of the Conservative Party from 1997 to 2001 when he was defeated in by Tony Blair in the 2001 General Election. The now former Prime Minister's decision to suggest Mr Hague for Prime Minister had been met by some surprise to many pundits, who saw the Chancellor George Osborne as Mr Cameron's most likely choice of successor. Mr Hague has yet to make any official comment this afternoon following the resignation but his first speech as Prime Minister is expected to be a very anticipated event.\"\n\n- BBC News report 14:32 PM\n\n\"Her Majesty the Queen has just now asked me to form a government and I have the honour of accepting. This is a huge undertaking which I feel a duty to bare, I feel saddened that it comes at the price of a great Prime Minister. As my premiership begins I will straight away continue David's hard work to restore this country to the great economic powerhouse it once was. I will serve to the best of my abilities and trust that with the help of the people, we will finally find a light at the end of the tunnel. Together we will rebuild this country and make it great again.\"\n\n- William Hague's first speech as Prime Minister, 15:37"
