        "text": "James MacPherson is a Sky News Australia presenter and writes a no holds barred blog on various topics. He has a genius ability to cut through the utter nonsense that is directed at Israel and the Jewish people. Regarding the miraculous rescue of 4 Israeli hostages from civilian homes in Gaza he writes: ‘I know it’s a rough day for mainstream media when innocent Jewish hostages are rescued, but they could at least try to contain their disappointment. It's insane that people are mad at Israel for rescuing the hostages, rather than being mad at Hamas for taking hostages in the first place.’ The piece is well worth a read. https://lnkd.in/gmgXRaea\n\nThis is probably one of the most surreal images you are going to see for a long time. Two patients in an Israeli hospital passing each other in the corridor. On the right, a young woman, shot in the back by Hamas terrorists (Nazis would be a better word, but we will leave it at that) at the Nova party, where 260 Israelis were butchered and slaughtered. She has just come out of a second operation. On the left, a wounded Hamas terrorist (you can see he is handcuffed to the bed) and even though he should have been left to bleed out, he too is being treated for his wounds in an Israeli hospital. Call us idiots. Call us fools. You may be right. But we are first humane human beings, and above all Jews, who sanctify the life of EVERYONE, even those who come to try and brutally take it from us . This is Israel. We cherish human life, and don't believe anyone tries who tells you otherwise."
