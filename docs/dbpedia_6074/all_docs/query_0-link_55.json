The instability of British politics since the Brexit referendum called by the man we shall soon have to call Lord Cameron has been so pronounced that shock and surprise are devalued currencies. But Rishi Sunak’s appointment of the former prime minister to his government in a sweeping and ambitious cabinet reshuffle was both unpredictable and unpredicted.\n\nIt was a media coup, sprung by Mr Sunak on a wholly unsuspecting public and parliamentary Conservative Party, just as Gordon Brown recalled his old adversary Lord Mandelson from exile"
