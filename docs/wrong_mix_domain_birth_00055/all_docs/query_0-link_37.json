        "text": "1. Seattle, gateway to the Puget Sound & Nantes, gateway to the Atlantic France : Venices of the AeroTech ? AeroTech, Smart Cities, Innovation, Technology, Global networks : Seattle, Washington State & Nantes, Atlantic France can team up !\n\n2. «Ignite creativity, fuel discovery, and enrich lives» Museum of Glass Blue glass beads from Venice apparently reached Arctic Alaska decades before Christophe Columbus. American Archeologists found the blueberry-sized beads during in the Brooks Range and dated their discovery to the 15th century. The beads may thus to be the first European objects to reach North America « I always thought that the boats of the future would fly » Marco Polo A third way of navigation for the third millennium ? How Nantes is supporting innovation to address global challenges\n\n3. #ShapingtheVeniceOfTheFuture Venice was the birthplace for the exchange of shares in ships. The merchant bankers would exchange these shares which were then divided into \"carats\" and put up for auction. This system allowed Venice to take part in maritime adventures on a very large scale from the 14th century. #Higher Over the course of a century, the Boeing Company had grown from a small outfit operating out of a converted boathouse— producing a single pontoon plane made from canvas and wood— to the world's largest aerospace company. Path to Europe Opportunities for doing business in Nantes, Venice of the hydrogen\n\n4. Integration between Port and Airport Terminals Green transition by 2045 Port of Nantes Saint-Nazaire is studying the optimization of methane transportation, by loading returning empty LNG tankers with CO2 to produce third generation agrofuels (micro algae) in exporting areas, notably in Qatar and the Gulf region. Any country in the world can manufacture liquefied gas. However, Nantes Saint-Nazaire played a pioneering role in many research (oxygen, nitrogen, propane, carbon dioxide ...). Energy efficiency - innovating and investing to consume less and spend less - requires such investments to be - in principle - profitable with a longer or shorter return on investment. In many countries, there are Green Banks that contribute to the growth of clean energy financing. Also energy service companies (ESCOs) are compensated on the energy cost savings made (formerly called Sofergies in France). Also practiced in several states in the United States. A gateway to CleanTech & Investment\n\n5. The sky’s the limit ? The amazing world of helium • A gas to serve humanity as the third navigation route for the third millennium? • Referring to Helios, the Sun in ancient Greek, helium is the second lightest and most abundant gas in the universe. Helium represents about 25% of the solar mass and represents 7% of the atomic matter of the universe, or about 23% of the total mass of the elements. • Helium is an odorless, colorless, tasteless and non-toxic element that is lighter than air. It has the lowest boiling point among the known elements, at -268.9 ° C. The properties, among other things, make helium one of the most valuable elements in the known universe."
