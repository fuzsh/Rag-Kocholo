        "text": "COURSE DESCRIPTION In this course we will investigate the rich history of ancient India, from the Indus Civilization in 3 rd millennium BCE to the Gupta Dynasty in 4 th-6 th century CE. We will reflect critically on the evidence that scholars use to study the ancient past (e.g. ancient texts, inscriptions, coins, and the archaeological record) and the ways in which they interpret this evidence. We will also analyze and compare the different methods and frameworks used by scholars across multiple disciplines (e.g. archaeology, art history, philology). You will have the opportunity to engage with different primary source materials in class and will demonstrate your understanding of different historical methods and frameworks in the writing of a final research paper. We will also discuss the stakes of ancient Indian history as it relates to the present, including current academic debates and the role of history in the construction of modern political and cultural identities. COURSE OBJECTIVES This course aims to provide students with a detailed overview of the ancient history of India, and the ways in which this history is (re)constructed through different perspectives and the analysis of different sources. By the end of this course students will be able to: 1. Identify and describe the chronological periods and cultures of ancient Indian history. 2. Describe different conceptual and analytical frameworks for analyzing ancient history.\n\nThe idea of archaeological and historical research, in the contemporary sense, was introduced to India mainly due to the colonial system. Apart from archaeology, various other academic disciplines too had their beginnings during the colonial period. Many of these disciplines began working on the history and culture of India, since the colonial system felt that generation of knowledge about India could be useful in its project of subjugating India, although some of the individuals associated with the colonial system would have developed interest in the culture and history of India, simply out of curiosity. Most of the interpretations that are offered on the history of India have been based on the ideas of Aryans, Dravidians and civilizations that were developed during the colonial period. The composition and transformation of population groups in India from the prehistoric to early historical period are very crucial for understanding the developments in Indian history and the processes involved in the development appear to be much more complex than what is conceived or imagined by historians, archaeologists and historical linguists. This paper argues that a major section of the populations of South India perhaps moved into this region from a much earlier period. It also highlights the need for decolonizing the practice of archaeology."
