        "text": "Sprawling along the Yèvre River in central France, Bourges is a fascinating medieval city that served as an important trade hub during the 15th and 16th centuries. It’s renowned for its half-timbered houses and UNESCO-listed Gothic cathedral and is the birthplace of the legendary merchant, Jacques Cœur.\n\nThings to do in Bourges\n\nIn the heart of Bourges is its UNESCO World Heritage-listed cathedral, a Gothic masterpiece that was originally founded in the 13th century. It’s particularly famed for its stained glass windows, some of which date from 1215 and depict scenes from the Last Supper, the Last Judgement and the Apocalypse. Be sure to climb the 400 steps that lead to the cathedral’s Tour de Buerre for panoramic views across Bourges.\n\nAfter visiting the cathedral, stroll through the Old Town of Bourges, which is clustered with diamond-patterned timber houses that were built following the great fire of 1487. See the merchant house where Jacques Cœur was born and marvel at the striking palace he later commissioned before browsing the mosaics, agricultural tools and bronze statues on display at Musee du Berry.\n\nOne of the city’s most picturesque green spaces is the Marais de Bourges, an area of reclaimed marshland dotted with urban garden allotments. Stretch your legs along the walking trails while learning about the marshland’s role in slowing the advance of Julius Caesar during his 52 BC conquest of Gaul.\n\nGetting around Bourges\n\nBourges is around two hours by train from Paris, with direct connections to Gare de Bourges. Tours Val de Loire Airport is two hours’ drive away and has flights to destinations across Europe and North Africa. Buses travel throughout Bourges, while the centre is compact enough to explore on foot."
