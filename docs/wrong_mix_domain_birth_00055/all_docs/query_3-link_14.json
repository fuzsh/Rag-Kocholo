        "text": "(born 1946). American singer and actress Cher was known for wearing wild wigs and skimpy outfits during her shows. During a career that spanned decades, however, she was rewarded with not only an Academy Award but also a Grammy Award.\n\nCherilyn Sarkisian was born on May 20, 1946, in El Centro, California. She moved to Los Angeles, California, when she was 16 and met entertainer and songwriter Salvatore (“Sonny”) Bono. The two got married in 1964 and then began singing together. Their first big pop hit came in 1965 with “I Got You Babe,” which sold more than three million copies. The pair then produced a number of hits, but within a few years their popularity began to fade. In 1971 their career was revived with the television variety show The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, which ran until 1974. During this time Cher’s solo singing career flourished, and she scored hits with songs such as “Half Breed” and “Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves.” Cher and Sonny divorced in 1974, though they appeared as cohosts of another television show in 1976–77.\n\nAfter Sonny left show business, Cher performed in a successful nightclub act and began to expand her acting. She appeared in the Broadway and film versions of Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982) and received an Academy Award nomination for her supporting role in Silkwood (1983). In 1988 she won an Academy Award for her starring role as an Italian American widow in the romantic comedy Moonstruck (1987). Her others films included Mask (1985), Suspect (1987), Mermaids (1990), and Tea with Mussolini (1999). In 2010 she starred opposite Christina Aguilera as a nightclub owner and performer in the musical drama Burlesque, and the following year she provided the voice of a lioness in the comedy Zookeeper. Cher later appeared in the musical romantic comedy Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018), which featured music from Swedish pop group ABBA.\n\nIn the late 1980s Cher had two successful albums: the self-titled Cher (1987), featuring the hit single “I Found Someone,” and Heart of Stone (1989), whose “If I Could Turn Back Time” also topped the charts. Her music career had waned by the mid-1990s, but she made a comeback with Believe (1998) and Living Proof (2002). In 2000 she won a Grammy Award for the dance single “Believe.” From 2008 to 2011 Cher performed in a successful and elaborate show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2017 she began another extended concert show there. Her later albums included Closer to the Truth (2013) and Dancing Queen (2018), a cover of ABBA songs. Cher published a volume of autobiographical essays, The First Time, in 1998."
