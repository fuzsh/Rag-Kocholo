        "text": "In August 2022, the branch line from Dhansiri (in Assam) to Sukhovi (in Nagaland) was inaugurated. The Donyi Polo Express from Naharalagun (Arunachal) to Guwhati via Rangiya was extended to Dhansiri and Sukhovi, thereby linking Arunachal with Nagaland. The PR staff announced that Sukhovi was the first station in Nagaland, which was not correct.\n\nThe first stations in Nagaland were Rangapahar, Rangapahar Crossing and Dimapur on the main line from Lumding to Tinsukia. Dimapur started off as Manipur Road, then Dimapur Manipur Road in the 1970s and now Dimapur. The road from Dimapur to Imphal passed through Kohima in Nagaland.\n\nNote that these signboards strictly follow the formula in other states-local language followed by English followed by Hindi. The local language is English.\n\nThe next station in Nagaland was Naginimora, on a branch from Simaluguri Jn in Assam. MG passenger trains were running on this route until at least 1994, but it closed soon afterward. Naginimora station was just over the border in Nagaland.\n\nThen there was the short-lived MG line from Amguri Jn to Tuli. This was meant to serve a paper mill near Tuli, though it closed down after some years. It was planned to extend the line to Tuli Town.\n\nHowever the MG line from Amguri to Tuli was converted to BG. There is no passenger service, though a small number of goods trains run for departmental use.\n\nThis is supposed to be the newly constructed BG station at Tuli.\n\nAnd finally to the new line from Dhansiri to Shokhuvi. There is an intermediate station called Dhansiripar in Nagaland.\n\nThis line has a long way to go towards Zubza which will be the station for Kohima.\n\nWith the near-complete removal of metre gauge from all important routes starting from the late 1970s, it would be a surprise to younger railfans that as late as 1976 it was possible to travel from Delhi Jn to Bangalore City wholly by metre gauge. (At that time there was no train from Delhi to Bangalore, though there were through coaches on the GT Express and Madras/Bangalore Express. The Kerala-Karnataka Express was yet to appear.)\n\nThere was, of course, no such MG train but by a series of reasonably good MG expresses it was possible to make this journey of 2389 km. The BG route via Madras would be a little longer at 2536 km.\n\nLet us begin our journey from Delhi Jn. I have taken the distances from the 1976 All India Time Table. Spelling of names are from that period. Inflated distances were being charged between Khandwa and Hingoli, so I have taken actual distances.\n\nBetween Rewari and Phulera I have taken the route via Ringas rather than the better-known route via Jaipur, as the former is shorter.\n\nThis route passes through DL, HR, RJ, MP, MH, AP and KA. (Also TG which did not exist then).\n\nDelhi-Madras has been covered here: https://abn397.wordpress.com/2021/09/18/delhi-to-madras-by-metre-gauge-in-1976/\n\nMadras-Bangalore has been covered here: https://abn397.wordpress.com/2022/01/02/madras-to-bangalore-by-metre-gauge-in-1976/\n\nThose who have timetables of 1976 or thereabout can work out suitable combinations of trains to cover this route. Examples could be Delhi-Ajmer, Ajmer-Secunderabad, Secunderabad-Bangalore.\n\nCompare this with the BG route via Madras.\n\nThe two-Test series is now poised 1-1, with both matches finishing within 3 days with innings defeats.\n\nManchester continued to be an unlucky venue for SA as England leads 5-1 with 4 draws. SA won only in 1955.\n\nThe third Test is scheduled for Sep 8-12 at the Oval. Here England leads 7-1 with 7 draws. SA won only in 2012.\n\nAK Markram played his 33rd Test, none of which were drawn. He has seen 20 wins and 13 losses.\n\nAnderson became the first to play 100 Tests at home. Next is Tendulkar with 94.\n\nTendulkar has played the most Tests (200), followed by Anderson with 174. That is, naturally, a record for England.\n\nAlso see: https://abn397.wordpress.com/2022/08/25/most-tests-home-away-and-neutral/\n\nAnderson also became the first to take 100 wickets in Tests between England and SA, Here are the top few:\n\nSM Pollock, Donald and Barnes are next. Broad has 82, but is unlikely to cross his partner’s total.\n\nAt the start of the 2nd Test between England and South Africa at Manchester, it was mentioned that JM Anderson was the first to play 100 Tests at home.\n\nThis is true. Let us also look who has played the most Tests overall, away and neutral.\n\nThese figures include all those playing in the Manchester Test of 2022, and do not include the ICC XI v Aus Test of 2005.\n\nMost Tests (125 or more):\n\nTendulkar (200) is followed by Anderson (174) and SR Waugh (168). The next from India is Dravid (163).\n\nAlso: Anderson (174), Broad (158), Warne (144) and VVS Laxman (134) have played the most Tests without ever captaining their sides.\n\nMost Tests at home (60 or more):\n\nAnderson leads with 100, followed closely by Tendulkar (94), Broad and Ponting (91 each). The next from India is again Dravid (70).\n\nMost Tests away (other than neutral venues), 60 or more.\n\nTendulkar leads with 106, followed by Dravid with 93. Next is Chanderpaul with 81. Ponting, Anderson and Broad are further down.\n\nAnd finally,\n\nMost Tests at neutral venues (7 or more):\n\nAs you may guess, Pakistani players dominate this list starting with Asad Shafiq (30), Azhar Ali (29) and Younis Khan (28).\n\nThe highest by a non-Pakistani player is 8 by R Herath, followed by several others with 7. These include some NZ players who played in the WTC final against India in England in 2021.\n\nThis series was the first time India had played Zimbabwe in ODIs since 2016. India won 3-0, following their earlier clean sweeps in 2013, 2015 and 2016.\n\nSummary of all ODIs between these teams:\n\nIndia leads 54-10 overall and 22-4 in Zimbabwe.\n\nWe now look at individual performances, starting with\n\nBatting:\n\nMost runs (500 or more):\n\nTendulkar and Ganguly have almost the same totals. No current players here. The most are by Sikandar Raza (388) and S Dhawan (367).\n\nThe most centuries are 5 by Tendulkar and 3 by Ganguly.\n\nThe most 50+ scores are 12 by A Flower and 11 by A Campbell\n\nHighest innings (100 or more):\n\nHere there are some new records:\n\nShubham Gill’s 130 is the highest for India in Zimbabwe (surpassing Tendulkar’s 127* in 1998)\n\nSikandar Raza’s 115 is the highest for Zimbabwe at home vs India (surpassing E Chigumbura’s 104* in 2015).\n\nHighest batting averages (Minimum 20 innings, 30.00):\n\nTendulkar leads by a large margin, while recent players have not played enough.\n\nHighest strike rates (Minimum 500 balls faced and 75.00):\n\nYuvraj leads here, while recent players are again absent.\n\nBowling:\n\nMost wickets (15 or more):\n\nUnexpectedly, Agarkar has the most wickets here. None from recent years.\n\nNo one has taken more than one 5wi. The most 4+wi are 4 by Zaheer Khan and 3 by Agarkar.\n\nThe most by current players is 14 by AR Patel.\n\nBest innings bowling (includes all 5wi and better):\n\nNewcomer Brad Evans is the only current player here. India’s best bowling is a 6-for by the nearly forgotten A Mishra.\n\nBowling averages (Minimum 1000 balls bowled, all instances):\n\nAgarkar has the best bowling average and strike rate. Kumble has the best economy rate.\n\nFielding:\n\nMost dismissals (12 or more):\n\nA Flower leads by a large margin, and A Campbell has the most catches by a fielder.\n\nDravid, who played in some matches as a keeper, has the most dismissals for India.\n\nMost dismissals in an innings (4 or more):\n\nThe most dismissals are 5 by Kirmani and N Mongia, while VVSL has the most (4) by a fielder.\n\nHighest dismissal rate (Minimum 20 innings, 0.500):\n\nA Flower leads, while Azharuddin has the best rate by a fielder.\n\nAll-round performance (overall):\n\nMinimum 20 innings and 1000 balls bowled:\n\nOnly Streak has batted and bowled enough. He does not really qualify to be an all-rounder in these matches.\n\nAll-round performance (match):\n\nMinimum 30 runs and 3 wickets:\n\nThe best performances here are by Ganguly (2000) and Crocker (1992).\n\nWhile every possible career statistic is tabulated for prominent cricketers, there are sometimes ambiguities in their place of birth.\n\nWe start with Wriddhiman Saha (who spells his first name in an unusual way). Where was he born? Cricinfo gives this:\n\nhttps://www.espncricinfo.com/player/wriddhiman-saha-279810\n\nThis says that he was born in Saktigarh in West Bengal.\n\nMost people who travel a bit will know of this Saktigarh:\n\nThis is a little east of Barddhaman and is on the main line from Kolkata to northern India.\n\nHowever, if we look at his Wikipedia article:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha\n\nhis birthplace is given as Siliguri in West Bengal. But there is no contradiction, as there is a lesser-known Saktigarh which is close to Siliguri. While it does not have a railway station, here is proof of its existence:\n\nThe cases of Mohammad Shami is more interesting.\n\nFirst we see his cricinfo profile:\n\nhttps://www.espncricinfo.com/player/mohammed-shami-481896\n\nHere it is mentioned that his birthplace is Amroha in Uttar Pradesh. This is near Moradabad on the road to Delhi. Wikipedia also gives the same birthplace.\n\nHe started his cricketing career in Bengal and the Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nAt that time, all the references mentioned his birthplace as “Jonagar, Bengal”.\n\nThere is no town in Bengal with this spelling. However, someone pointed out that this may have meant Joynagar, an outer suburb of Kolkata best known for the sweet “Joynagar er Moa”:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynagarer_Moa\n\nThis place is served by this station, on the suburban line to Lakshmikantpur and Namkhana:\n\nEven today some references like the Playfair Annual of 2022 still show his birthplace as “Jonagar, Bengal”.\n\nWhile Mr Shami is one of the key members of India’s current team, he could not have possibly been born in two different places over a thousand km apart. Presumably someone connected with the Bengal cricket association (perhaps with the connivance of KKR) produced some document to show that he was born in Bengal.\n\nIf I am wrong, then why is his birthplace now listed in UP? Strange that none of the large tribe of cricket journalists commented on his moving birthplace.\n\nWomen’s cricket was included in the CWG for the first time in 2022. These matches have T20I status.\n\nThe winners were:\n\nGold: Australia\n\nSilver: India\n\nBronze: New Zealand\n\n4th: England\n\nSummary of team performance:\n\nMost runs (100 or more):\n\nNote that Mooney is just ahead of Devine. Mandhana is in 3rd place and Rodrigues is 5th. No one has more than two fifties.\n\nHighest innings (50 or more):\n\nHeaded by Bates with McGrath in second place. H Kaur and Mandhana have the highest scores for India.\n\nBowling-5 wickets or more:\n\nIndia’s Renuka Singh leads with 11 wickets. Next are McGrath and Schutt with 8.\n\nInnings bowling-includes all 3wi or more:\n\nThe best performance was 4-8 by King. The next two were by India’s Renuka Singh.\n\nFielding (3 or more dismissals):\n\nSeveral players have 4 dismissals, including both keepers and fielders.\n\nInnings fielding (2 or more dismissals):\n\nSanjeewani is the only one with 3 dismissals. Many others have 2.\n\nAll-round match performance (Minimum 20 runs and 2 wickets):\n\nThe best is by McGrath (78* and 3-13) followed by Devine (48 and 3-37).\n\nThis new line in Andhra Pradesh has been in the news lately. It is similar to the Dedicated Freight Corridors in that it is primarily meant for freight traffic (iron ore export) and there is no present plan to use it for passenger services.\n\nThere are, of course, a number of short freight-only lines on IR. This line is unusual in that it is over 100 km long and because it may well serve as a short cut between widely separated parts of a state. And it is electrified from the start.\n\nA very brief summary is here:\n\nhttps://www.rvnl.org/en/AnnualReportsDocuments/RVNL%20ANNUAL%20REPORT%202015-16%20ENGLISH.pdf\n\nSee p 35 of the pdf which corresponds to p 33 of the booklet.\n\nA map of the route:\n\nWhile this is a screenshot from a TV report, it must have been an official map to start with.\n\nOther articles:\n\nhttps://www.projectstoday.com/News/Krishnapatnam-Port-Venkatachalam-Obulavaripalle-railway-line-makes-progress\n\nand\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/first-freight-train-between-obulavaripalli-and-venkatachalam-operated/article28139362.ece\n\nThe list of stations can be got from the RBS tables (where you have to ask for the “goods” option rather than “coach”).\n\nThere are some discrepancies between this table and the map shown above. Perhaps all the stations have not been completed yet.\n\nIt would be useful for passenger services between Kadapa and the east coast from Nellore and beyond, as Renigunta and Gudur would be bypassed.\n\nBut presently there is a problem with this, which will be apparent from this map of the eastern end of this line:\n\nThe new line crosses a flyover (between Kommarpudi and Venkatachalam) over the Gudur-Vijayawada line with no simple connection to the latter. Thus a prospective Nandalur-Gudur passenger or Kadapa-Vijayawada Express would have to reverse at Venkatachalam Road.\n\nThe route includes a tunnel about 6.6 km long (between Cherlopalli and Rapuru) which is being described as the “longest electrified rail tunnel in India” which may be correct today. But there will be longer tunnels in J and K which will be electrified over the next few years.\n\nDetails here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rail_tunnels_in_India_by_length\n\nand https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scr-commissions-longest-electrified-tunnel/article28276234.ece\n\nThere are numerous video clips (in Telugu) on Youtube describing this route with an emphasis on the tunnel.\n\nAlso note:\n\nAlso see these pictures of some of the intermediate stations:\n\nNo passenger trains have run on this route so far. One explanation is that the tunnels have been constructed with height insufficient for regular coaches\n\nKaraimadai is the station before Mettupalaiyam on the line from Coimbatore. At the time of this accident, this section was on the Madras Railway. It later became part of the South Indian Railway and then the Southern Railway.\n\nThe derailment of the Madras-Mettupalaiyam passenger on 9 Nov 1893 described below resulted in the deaths of 44 persons and injuries to 47. It was one of the most serious accidents on the Indian railways in the 19th century. Possibly it was the worst, as casualty figures for some earlier disasters are not accurately known.\n\nA couple of pictures taken by a British officer who was serving on the Nilgiri railway:\n\nThe handwriting is a bit difficult to decipher, but can be read with some effort. The locomotive appears to be NA1 no 77. This was an 0-6-0 built by Neilson & Co, Glasgow."
