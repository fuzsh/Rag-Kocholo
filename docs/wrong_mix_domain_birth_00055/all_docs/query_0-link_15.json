In 2017, Rahman made his debut as a director and writer for the film Le Musk.[9]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRahman was born in Madras, India.[10]Template:Failed verification His father, R. K. Shekhar, was a film-score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films; Rahman assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.\n\nAfter his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical equipment provided his family's income.[11] Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi),[12] Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family. which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. Therefore, the Principal Mrs YGP summoned Rahman and his mother and told them that Rahman should focus on academics irrespective of family circumstances. Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year,[13] and later joined Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted on his music talent and formed a band with his high school classmates.[14] However, after discussing with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician.[15][16] Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja)[17] and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.[18] He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the \"ideal combination of music and technology\".[19]\n\nRahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj,[20][21] and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan.[22] He soon began working with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu and Raj-Koti,[21] accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music.[12]\n\nStudying in Madras, Rahman graduated with a diploma in Western classical music from the school.[23] Rahman was introduced to Qadiri tariqa when his younger sister was seriously ill in 1984. His mother was a practicing Hindu.[24][25][26] At the age of 23, he converted to Islam with other members of his family in 1989, changing his name to Allahrakka Rahman (A. R. Rahman).[27][28][29][12][30]\n\nCareer[]\n\nSoundtracks[]\n\nRahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn.[31] He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart's Symphony no.25.[32][33][34]\n\nIn 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, Roja.[35][36]\n\nRahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India,[35] and arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and high-tech studios.[37] Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for his second film Yoddha, a Malayalam film starring Mohanlal and directed by Sivan's brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992.\n\nThe following year, Rahman received the Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus) award for best music director at the National Film Awards for Roja.

The musical cues in the soundtrack albums for Sangamam and Iruvar used Carnatic vocals, the veena, rock guitar and jazz.[56] During the 2000s, Rahman composed scores and popular songs for Rajiv Menon's Kandukondain Kandukondain, Alaipayuthey, Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades, Rang De Basanti[57] and songs with Hindustani motifs for 2005's Water.

Shankar (Gentleman, Kadhalan, Indian, Jeans, Mudhalvan, Nayak, Boys, Sivaji and Enthiran).[58]\n\nIn 2005 Rahman expanded his Panchathan Record Inn studio by establishing AM Studios in Kodambakkam, Chennai, creating the most cutting-edge studio in Asia.[59][60] The following year he launched his own music label, KM Music,[61] with his score for Sillunu Oru Kaadhal.[62] Rahman scored the Mandarin-language film Warriors of Heaven and Earth in 2003 after researching and using Chinese and Japanese classical music,[63] and won the Just Plain Folks Music Organization|Just Plain Folks Music Award For Best Music Album for his score for 2006's Varalaru (God Father).[64] He co-scored Shekhar Kapur's second British film, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, in 2007[65] and received a Best Composer Asian Film Award nomination at the Hong Kong International Film Festival for his Jodhaa Akbar score.[66] Rahman's music has been sampled for other scores in India,[67] appearing in Inside Man, Lord of War, Divine Intervention and The Accidental Husband.\n\nHis score for his first Hollywood film, the 2009 comedy Couples Retreat, won the BMI London Award for Best Score.[68] Rahman's music for 2008's Slumdog Millionaire won a Golden Globe and two Academy Awards (a first for an Asian), and the songs \"Jai Ho\" and \"O... Saya\" from its soundtrack were internationally successful. His music on 2008's Bollywood Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na was popular with Indian youth; that year, his score and songs for Jodhaa Akbar won critical acclaim, a Best Composer Asian Film Award nomination and IIFA awards for best music direction and score.\n\nIn 2010, Rahman composed the original score and songs for the romantic Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, the sci-fi romance Enthiran and Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, composing for the Imtiaz Ali musical Rockstar; the latter's soundtrack was a critical and commercial success.[69] In 2012 Rahman composed for Ekk Deewana Tha and the American drama People Like Us,[70] and collaborated with director Yash Chopra on Jab Tak Hai Jaan.[71] all were positively received.[72] By the end of the year his music for Mani Ratnam's Kadal was critically acclaimed, and the album topped the iTunes India chart for December.[73] In 2013, Rahman had two releases: Raanjhanaa and Maryan.

The lyrics are by Nirmika Singh, and MC Heam (rap) .[126]\n\nMusical style and impact[]\n\nSkilled in Carnatic music, Western and Hindustani classical music and the Qawwali style of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Rahman is noted for film songs amalgamating elements of these and other genres, layering instruments from different musical idioms in an improvisational style.[30][127] During the 1980s Rahman recorded monaural arrangements in common with his musical predecessors, K. V. Mahadevan and Vishwanathan–Ramamoorthy. In later years his methodology changed, as he experimented with the fusion of traditional instruments with new electronic sounds and technology.[30][128]\n\nRahman's musical interests and outlook originate in his love of experimentation. His compositions have an auteuristic use of counterpoint, orchestration and the human voice, melding Indian pop music with a unique timbre, form and instrumentation. With this syncretic style and wide-ranging lyrics, the appeal of Rahman's music crosses classes and cultures in Indian society.[129]\n\nHis first soundtrack, for Roja, was listed on Time's all-time \"10 Best Soundtracks\" in 2005. Film critic Richard Corliss said that the composer's \"astonishing debut work parades Rahman's gift for alchemizing outside influences until they are totally Tamil, totally Rahman\",[130] and his initial global success is attributed to the South Asian diaspora. Music producer Ron Fair considers Rahman \"one of the world's great living composers in any medium\".[131]\n\nDirector Baz Luhrmann said:\n\n\" I had come to the music of A. R. Rahman through the emotional and haunting score of Bombay and the wit and celebration of Lagaan. But the more of AR's music I encountered the more I was to be amazed at the sheer diversity of styles: from swinging brass bands to triumphant anthems; from joyous pop to West-End musicals. Whatever the style, A. R. Rahman's music always possesses a profound sense of humanity and spirit, qualities that inspire me the most.[132]\"\n\nRahman introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films.[133]\n\nOn 21 May 2014 Rahman announced that he has partnered with former Black Eyed Peas' Will.i.am to recreate an early popular track 'Urvashi Urvashi'. Track is 'Birthday'.[134]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nRahman is married to Saira Banu (not to be confused with actress Saira Banu); they have three children: Khatija, Rahima and Ameen.[135] Ameen has sung \"NaNa\" from Couples Retreat, and Khatija has sung \"Pudhiya Manidha\" from Enthiran.[136][137] Rahman is the uncle of composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, the son of his elder sister A. R. Reihana.[138] Rahman's younger sister, Fathima, heads his music conservatory in Chennai.[citation needed] The youngest, Ishrath, has a music studio. A.R.Rahman is the co-brother[139] of film actor Rahman.[140]\n\nBorn Hindu, Rahman converted to Islam when he was in his 20s. After the early death of his father, his family experienced difficult times; Sufism influenced his mother who was a practicing Hindu[24] and, eventually, his family.[28][141] During the 81st Academy Awards ceremony Rahman paid tribute to his mother: \"There is a Hindi dialogue, mere pass ma hai, which means 'even if I have got nothing I have my mother here'.\"[142] He said, \"Ella pughazhum iraivanukke\" (\"All praise to God\" in Tamil, a translation from the Quran) before his speech.[143]\n\nPhilanthropy[]\n\nRahman is involved with a number of charitable causes. In 2004 he was appointed as the global ambassador of the Stop TB Partnership, a WHO project.[93] Rahman has supported Save the Children India and worked with Yusuf Islam on \"Indian Ocean\", a song featuring a-ha keyboard player Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds from the song went to help orphans in Banda Aceh who were affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.[144] He produced the single \"We Can Make It Better\" by Don Asian with Mukhtar Sahota.[145] In 2008 Rahman opened the KM Music Conservatory with an audio-media education facility to train aspiring musicians in vocals, instruments, music technology and sound design. The conservatory (with prominent musicians on staff and a symphony orchestra) is located near his studio in Kodambakkam, Chennai and offers courses at several levels. Violinist L.
