        "text": "How old is Engelbert Humperdinck and where is he from?\n\nEngelbert was born in Madras, British India (now Chennai, India) in 1936.\n\nHe was one of ten children, and his parents were British Army NCO Mervyn Dorsey, who was of Welsh descent, and his wife Olive, who was of German descent.\n\nHis family moved to Leicester when he was 10 years old. He later found a love for music and began learning the saxophone.\n\nBy the early 1950s, he was playing saxophone in nightclubs, but didn't start singing until he was in his late teens.\n\nWhat is his real name and why did he choose Engelbert Humperdinck?\n\nRelease Me - Engelbert Humperdinck\n\nEngelbert was born Arnold George Dorsey.\n\nHis impression of Jerry Lewis led to his friends to call him 'Gerry Dorsey', a name that he worked under for almost a decade.\n\nIn 1965, Dorsey joined up with Gordon Mills, his former roommate, who had become a music impresario and the manager of Tom Jones.\n\nMills, who saw that Dorsey had been struggling for several years to become successful, suggested a name-change to the more interesting Engelbert Humperdinck.\n\nThe name was borrowed from the 19th-century German composer of operas such as Hansel and Gretel. It wasn't long before he scored chart success around the world.\n\nWho was Engelbert Humperdinck's wife?\n\nEngelbert Humperdinck and partner Patricia Healey married in 1964. The couple met at a nightclub in Leicester.\n\nThey had four children together â€” Scott, Jason, Louise and Bradley.\n\nHis wife once said that she could paper their bedroom with all of the paternity lawsuits filed against her husband. He was successfully sued for paternity by two women during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn 2017, the singer confirmed that Patricia had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years. She passed away in Los Angeles on February 5, 2021, after contracting COVID-19."
