        "text": "Do you believe in life after close?\n\nBack in 2013, Cher paid just over $2.1 million for a secluded Beverly Hills home that had previously been owned by another Hollywood heavy hitter, Modern Family’s Ed O’Neill. Five years later, the enduring show business superpower put the home back on the market for $2.5 million and, according to tax records, sold it for a bit less than what she paid. The two-time celebrity hideaway has since been comprehensively updated and is now back up for grabs with a price tag of $4.1 million. Aneela Zaman and Ernie Carswell with Douglas Elliman hold the listing.\n\nThe two-story home, set on half an acre at the end of a cul-de-sac in a wee glen in the Coldwater Canyon area, was built in 1957. Alongside key features like rustic wood beam ceilings and bay windows, there are four bedrooms and three bathrooms spread out over 3,089 square feet of living space. There are at least three fireplaces throughout the home, which certainly enhances its appeal. But the real selling point might be the quiet gardens that make up its tranquil setting.\n\nWhen the “Strong Enough” singer owned the 90210 pad, its façade somewhat mirrored a French country house with red brick accents across its beige stucco exterior. Following its revamp, a monochromatic olive green now covers those contrasting materials, giving it a more streamlined look. The lighter, wheat-colored wood floors that replaced darker oak floorboards inside the home are the first thing you might notice from the front door, other than the minimalist fireplace in the combination living and dining room. French doors on either side of the fireplace lead to a tree-shaded brick terrace, where the aforementioned gargoyle fountain is located.\n\nThe kitchen is open to the living/dining room over a breakfast bar. It features a small breakfast nook alongside a high-end gas range and a Sub-Zero refrigerator. An office and the den with a wet bar, plus outdoor access, are other highlights of the home’s main floor.\n\nThe primary suite is remarkably spacious and airy, thanks to its captivating vaulted ceiling and bay windows that frame leafy views. A haven unto itself, there are two fireplaces, a wet bar, a walk-in closet fitted with dark wood cabinetry, and a travertine-tiled bath with a double shower and a soaking tub.\n\nEnveloped in towering trees, the home’s various patios and decks are complemented by a faux-grassed area set in a sunny clearing with a waterfall that pours over a tumble of boulders into a small pond. And when you’re ready to brave the traffic, the canyon hideaway is within easy proximity to L.A. hotspots like the Chateau Marmot, LACMA, and the Michelin-starred Gucci Osteria da Massimo Bottura.\n\nCher’s primary residence has long been a grand Italian Renaissance-style mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. The “Goddess of Pop” has the property up for sale for $75 million after first giving it a go at $85 million.\n\nClick here for more images of Cher’s former Beverly Hills home."
