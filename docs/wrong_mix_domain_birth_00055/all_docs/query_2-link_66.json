With a career spanning from the '70s to today, Bolton has become a Renaissance man of sorts as a singer, actor and film producer. His new documentary “American Dream: Detroit” premieres on May 15, but fans can see Bolton perform in the Northeast later in the summer.\n\nBilly Idol, 62\n\nDate of birth: Nov. 30, 1955\n\nBilly Idol made his reputation as an incorrigible British punk rocker with songs that get still regular radio airplay, like “Rebel Yell” and “White Wedding.” Now he’s in his 60s and still releasing new albums and touring.\n\nJackson Browne, 69\n\nDate of birth: Oct. 9, 1948\n\nWith 11 albums that have gone either gold or platinum — “Running on Empty” is certified platinum seven times over — the easy rocker has created quite the legacy for himself since his career began in the late 1960s.

Rolling Stone magazine even named him #72 on their list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. He’ll be performing with ZZ Top all summer long as part of the \"Blues and Bayous\" tour.\n\nJoan Jett, 59\n\nDate of birth: Sept. 22, 1958\n\nThere’s no question about it: Joan Jett loves rock and roll.

Nowadays Joan and her crew are touring across America with fellow '80s acts Styx and Tesla.\n\nMick Jagger (Rolling Stones), 74\n\nDate of birth: July 26, 1943\n\nThere’s a good chance The Rolling Stones won’t stop touring until every member of the band is dead.
