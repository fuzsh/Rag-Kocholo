Not only is he a stellar business professional, but he's also a passionate sportsman. Recently, he conquered the Patagonia Run's 110 km challenge! 🏃♂️🌄 From Buenos Aires to the Alps in Crans-Montana, training was tough. Sebastian shared: “The atmosphere was electric, and the trails were grueling. I struggled with stomach pains from the 50 km mark and faced the daunting slopes of the Andes, but finally, after 110 km and more than 6,000 meters of elevation gain, I made it. The emotions and sensations of being part of such events are unparalleled. You run the same trails as the professionals, confronting the same challenges and emotions, while also savoring the stunning landscapes of Patagonia. It's an incredible experience, especially considering we actually pay for this!\" Join us in congratulating Sebastian on this incredible achievement!
