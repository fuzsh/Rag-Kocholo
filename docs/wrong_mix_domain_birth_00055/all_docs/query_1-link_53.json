        "text": "This is the biography Cher, pseudonym of Cherilyn Sarkisian La Pierre (El Centro, May 20, 1946), is a singer-songwriter, actress, record producer. With over fifty years of career and a voice with a distinctive and immediately recognizable timbre, Cher has become an icon of pop culture and one of the most famous and successful artists in contemporary history, with over 100 million records sold worldwide.\n\nCher is the only singer who can boast at least one song at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in six different decades, from the 1960s to the 2000s. Her biggest hit, Believe, with sales of over 10 million copies, is the best-selling single by a female singer in England and the best-selling single of 1999. In July 1999, Cher was ranked 43 in the VH1 100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll survey, and in September 2002, she was ranked 26 in the Sexiest Women of Rock & Roll survey.\n\nIn a 2001 poll, A&E biography magazine ranked Cher as the third best actress of all time, behind two of her Hollywood idols, Katharine Hepburn and Audrey Hepburn.According to American Out Magazine, Cher is among the 12 greatest female gay icons of all time. Cher first met Salvatore Bono at the age of 16 in a Los Angeles bar in November 1962. By chance, one day Cher follows Bono at Gold Star Studios and, during a recording, is put in the place of an absent chorus girl.\n\nHer particular voice attracted Spector’s attention: during 1964, Cher was assigned the role of chorister, participating in some hits of that period: “Be My Baby” by The Ronettes, “Da Doo Ron Ron Ron” by Crystals and “You’Ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin” by The Righteous Brothers. After her experience as a chorister, Cher under the pseudonym of Bonnie Jo Mason, recorded “Ringo, I Love You”, a pro-Beatles hymn which, due to a certain sexual ambiguity from a singing point of view, receives no radio feedback. His first single, “Dream Baby”, published under the name of Cherilyn, was released on the radio during 1964.\n\nCher arrived in Italy for the first time, together with Sonny, in September 1966, and returned to Italy the following year, in January, to take part in the Sanremo Festival. At the same time, Cher was ready to launch her solo career: she recorded All I Really Want to Do, an album that reached Billboard’s position 16. The album contains a reinterpretation of Bob Dylan’s “All I Really Want to Do”, which immediately became a success, reaching position 15 on Billboard. In 1966, Cher recorded her second album The Sonny Side of Chér from which one of the greatest hits of the period, Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down), was extracted.\n\nAlso during 1966 Cher released another album, simply called Chér. The album did not reach the success of the two previous ones, even though it contains the hits “Alfie” and “Sunny”, Top 10 in many European countries. 1966 saw the release in Italy by the Liberty label, Cher’s first LP, The Sonny Side of Chér under the name of Cher sings Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan and others. The album contains seven songs from All I Really Want To Do and five from The Sonny Side of Chér. The album also contains Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down), the worldwide hit that has sold more than a million copies.\n\nThe song, written by Sonny Bono, touches the 8th position of the Italian Hit Parade in September 1966. Several artists present a version of it, for example: Dalida, the Crows, Milena Cantù and the group Equipe 84.Bang Bang, in various proposals, soon became one of the most successful songs of that year, and one of the symbols of the sixties.\n\nCher’s last album to enter the charts in the sixties was With Love, Chér, but subsequent attempts were a failure, followed by the Backstage album, the first album that failed to enter the charts. Cher’s most ambitious project of the sixties as a soloist, 3614 Jackson Highway, released in 1969, proved to be another failure from a commercial point of view, but Cher’s voice was already more mature and the singer once again showed her multifaceted skills in interpreting hits by other artists.\n\nThe album is defined by many critics as one of the most successful pieces in a strictly artistic sense. Meanwhile, on 4 March 1969, Chaz Bono, (born Chastity Bono) the only daughter Cher will have from Bono, was born from the couple. After the commercial flops of the sixties, the couple began to play concerts in night clubs and hotels in Las Vegas. During their performances, they alternate songs by other artists with sketches.\n\nIn the shows, Cher plays the wife, who has something to say about everything. In fact, Bono controls every aspect of Cher’s life, from the musical works to the scripts used in the shows.Sonny & Cher release their first live album, recorded in Las Vegas. Immediately afterwards Sonny & Cher record All I Ever Need Is You, an album that contains the song of the same name: the song reaches position 7 and the album reaches position 14 on the Billboard chart in 1972.\n\nNow, at the age of 25, Cher manages to establish herself as a solo artist, releasing “Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves”, under the artistic direction of Snuff Garrett. Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves (single) came in first position in America for a fortnight and position 4 in England. The song is taken from the album Cher, renamed Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves after the success of the song of the same name, which sells more than a million copies and from which another hit is released, “The Way Of Love”, which reaches position 7 in America.\n\nCher manages to reach the first position on two other occasions, with the songs taken from the albums Half-Breed (position 28 on Billboard) and Dark Lady. From the first album, the autobiographical song Half-Breed (single) is released, which reaches the first position on the American chart in October 1973 for a fortnight and from the second, the last big hit, Dark Lady (single), which reaches again the first position on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nHugely successful songs such as “Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves”, “Half-Breed” and “Dark Lady” are released in Italy. Since the third season of “The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour”, the marriage of Sonny & Cher sinks and the duo separates at the end of 1974. While the show was still in the Top 10, the two divorce (divorce made official on 27 June 1975) and Cher manages to win a Golden Globe for her performance in the show, in the autumn of 1974, while Cher announces that she will present her new TV variety show.\n\nThe Cher Show debuted as a TV special on 16 February 1975 with guests Flip Wilson, Bette Midler and Elton John. Cloris Leachman and Jack Albertson both won Emmy Awards for their guest appearances a few weeks later, and the series received four Emmy Award nominations the same year. The first series reached the 22nd position in Nielsen’s year-end ranking. Cher marries rock musician Gregg Allman, a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band, on 30 June 1975. From their union Elijah Blue Allman was born, on 10 June 1976.\n\nBono’s musical career as a soloist continues for the first time without any influence from Bono, with the release of some experimental and unsuccessful albums by both the public and the critics. Stars, in which Cher puts all of herself, only reaches the 153 position in America, I’d Rather Believe in You and finally Cherished, produced by Snuff Garrett, which should emulate the old hits. Together with Gregg Allman, Cher records Two the Hard Way, under the pseudonym Allman & Woman, which represents another commercial failure.\n\nHer career continues with the release of three albums under the Casablanca Records label including the record album, Take Me Home. The echo of “Take Me Home”, in full disco phenomenon, reaches Italy, but the homonymous song, a top 10 hit in the United States and Canada. After a short promotional tour Cher signed a four-year contract with Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and began performing from the summer of 1979 to finish in the summer of 1982 with the show “A Celebration at Caesar’s Place”.\n\nIn the second album released by Casablanca Records, Prisoner, . In 1980, at the age of 34, Cher decided to found a punk-new wave rock band with the then boyfriend guitarist Les Dudek; from this idea Black Rose and an album of the same name were born.Cher after breaking up Black Rose, Cher records another solo album called I Paralyze. Cher decides to expand her career as an actress.\n\nThe first two films, Good Times and Chastity, were panned by critics. It’s also hard to find a cast, for many Cher is “too unserious” by film standards, and is “too much of a singer” to play any role on the big screen. Other films were Behind the Mask, The Witches of Eastwick and Suspect – Allegedly Guilty, which were a big hit with the public; in the 1987-88 season The Witches of Eastwick and Witchcraft from the Moon managed to enter the top 100 highest grossing films, at the 10 and 13 positions respectively.\n\nCher was helped by A&R John Kalodner at the age of 41 and decided to return to music with an AOR album, named Cher. Cher signed a contract with Geffen Records for the release of three albums, with the participation of writers and musicians such as Diane Warren, Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Desmond Child, Mark Mangold and Michael Bolton. The album became his biggest success, selling 3 million copies worldwide and being certified Platinum in America.\n\nIn 1989 Cher released the album Heart of Stone. The album was initially released with an image of Cher sitting in front of a heart made of stone, creating the illusion of a skull; later the image was replaced by a less controversial one. Heart of Stone became its biggest success at the time, selling more than 4.5 million copies worldwide. Several singles are released from the album. The biggest hit If I Could Turn Back Time, which reaches the Top 3 in America.\n\nThe MTV programme will subsequently broadcast a censored version only after 9 pm.Cher began the 1990s with her first solo tour, the Heart of Stone Tour, which took her back in concert after eight years in America, Australia and the British Isles, selling out in most of the places she visited. A date for one of her concerts was filmed at The Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas and was presented by CBS as a TV special. The concert was later released on VHS, and then in 2005 on DVD.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics despite its modest box office success. Cher contributed to the soundtrack of the film, recording Baby I’m Yours and The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s in His Kiss). The song only makes it to position 33 in America, while. In 1991 Cher completes the contract with Geffen by releasing the album Love Hurts. The album has a big impact in Europe and the rest of the world, debuting at number one in the UK and staying there for six consecutive weeks.\n\nCompared to the previous two albums, Love Hurts receives less attention in America.Initially the album in Europe is released with the same American cover, which is later replaced by the image of Cher with a red wig. After the “Love Hurts Tour” and the promotion of the Greatest Hits, Cher was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, brought on by a virus called Epstein-Barr.\n\nCher signed a contract with Warner Bros. in 1995 and in Europe released It’s a Man’s World, an album consisting mainly of pop rock covers of old hits by male artists. The album in England reached the top 10 on the charts. In America, on the other hand, It’s A Man’s World was released in 1996 and presented to the public as a remix and only made it to position 64 on Billboard.\n\nIn 1995 Cher returned to the Italian charts after years with the album It’s a Man’s World and the single One by One. In February 1996 Cher returned to Sanremo, playing One by One and Walking In Memphis and promoting her new album. The song (It’s a Man’s World) reached Hit Parade position 16, and at the end of the year, it reached position 72 in the Top 100 best-selling albums.1996 .\n\nCher appears in the CBS special, Sonny and Me: Cher Remembers as a tribute to Bono.

The eponymous album quickly became a bestseller worldwide, ranking at position 4 in America and position 8 in England. According to subsequent estimates, the album has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album in Cher’s career.\n\nIn October 1998, the Believe album was also released in Italy. After the promotion, the single at the end of the year was at the top of the charts. Believe remained at the top of the charts for eleven weeks, bringing the album of the same name in the Top 10, to position 6, and making it sell more than 300,000 copies.

Cher has also inspired many celebrities, such as Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Tracy Chapman and Lady Gaga.\n\nDiscography\n\n1965 – All I Really Want to Do\n\n1966 – The Sonny Side of Chér\n\n1966 – Cher\n\n1967 – With Love, Chér\n\n1968 – Backstage\n\n1969 – 3614 Jackson Highway\n\n1971 – Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\n\n1972 – Foxy Lady\n\n1973 – Bittersweet White Light\n\n1974 – Half-Breed\n\n1974 – Dark Lady\n\n1975 – Stars\n\n1976 – I’d Rather Believe in You\n\n1977 – Cherished\n\n1979 – Take Me Home\n\n1979 – Prisoner\n\n1980 – Black Rose\n\n1982 – I Paralyze\n\n1987 – Cher\n\n1989 – Heart of Stone\n\n1991 – Love Hurts\n\n1995 – It’s a Man’s World\n\n1998 – Believe\n\n2000 – Not com.mercial\n\n2001 – Living Proof\n\n2010 – Burlesque\n\n2013 – Closer to the Truth\n\n2018 – Dancing Queen\n\nOfficial website"
