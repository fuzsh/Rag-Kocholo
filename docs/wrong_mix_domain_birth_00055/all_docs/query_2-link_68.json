        "text": "Full Name: Salvatore Phillip Bono\n\nProfession: Singer-Songwriter and Politician\n\nBiography: Sonny dropped out of high school to pursue a career as a songwriter, landing work as promotion man and staff writer at Specialty Records, and then with Phil Specter. Early works were recorded by Don and Dewey, the Righteous Brothers, and Sam Cooke. His biggest hit came with the Searchers covering \"Needle and Pins\".\n\nHe branched out into performance, teaming with session singer Cherilyn Sarkisian as an act called \"Caesar and Cleo\". The pair married and switched to performing under their real names of \"Sonny & Cher\". Several hits followed in the mid 60's, such as \"The Beat Goes On\" and their signature song \"I Got You Babe\", both written by Bono.\n\nAfter a lag, they developed a nightclub act that mixed songs with humor, usually with Cher making wisecracks about Sonny's height, intelligence, and heritage. The reboot proved a hit and they began a 4-year run hosting a popular variety show on CBS. The program was cancelled as their marriage was ending badly. A single season revival a few years later was less successful.\n\nWhile Cher went on to enormous success as both a solo artist and actress, Sonny left the music industry and concentrated on acting - to little acclaim. He opened a restaurant, and was inspired by the bureaucracy he encountered to run for public office. His election as mayor of Palm Springs, California became a stepping stone that eventually got him elected to the US House of Representatives. A copyright law that he co-sponsored was passed after his accidental death, and named in his honor.\n\nHe was married 4 times, and fathered 4 children.\n\nBorn: February 16, 1935\n\nBirthplace: Detroit, Michigan, USA\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Pig\n\nStar Sign: Aquarius"
