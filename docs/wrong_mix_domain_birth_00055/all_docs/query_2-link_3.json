        "text": "How old is Cher and where is she from?\n\nCher was born on May 20, 1946. She celebrated her 77th birthday in 2023. She was born in California.\n\nHer father, John Sarkisian, was an Armenian-American truck driver, known to have drug and gambling problems.\n\nHer mother, Georgia Holt (born Jackie Jean Crouch), was a model and part-time actress.\n\nWho was Cher's mother Georgia Holt? Actor's husbands, children and more facts revealed\n\nCher's father was rarely around when she was a child, and her parents divorced when Cher was just ten months old.\n\nHer mother later married actor John Southall, with whom she had another daughter, Georganne, Cher's half-sister.\n\nIn 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher and Georganne.\n\nCher's mother passed away in December 2022, aged 96.\n\nWhat is Cher's real name?\n\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian.\n\nShe chose a shortened version of her name, 'Cher', as her stage name by the time she started releasing music in the mid-1960s.\n\nWho was Cher's first husband Sonny Bono?\n\nCher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962, when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his housekeeper.\n\nCher and Sonny became close friends, and later lovers. Although Sonny wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her, as she suffered from stage fright, and so he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies.\n\nOriginally going under the name Caesar and Cleo, Sonny & Cher were a big success in the charts thanks to their hit 'I Got You Babe', and they secured a very popular US TV series.\n\nWhen Sonny & Cher reunited to perform 'I Got You Babe' for the very last time\n\nThey had marital problems since 1972, but they kept it relatively secret until 1974. \"The public still thinks we are married,\" Sonny wrote in his diary at the time, \"[and] that's the way it has to be.\"\n\nIn February 1974, Sonny filed for a separation, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". A week later, Cher asked for a divorce, charging Sonny with \"involuntary servitude\", claiming that he withheld money from her.\n\nThe couple battled in court over finances and the custody of their child, who was eventually granted to Cher. Their divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975.\n\nFollowing Sonny Bono's death in a skiing accident in 1998, Cher delivered an emotional eulogy at his funeral, calling him \"the most unforgettable character\" she had met.\n\nWho was Cher's second husband?\n\nOn June 30, 1975, just four days after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock legend Gregg Allman, co-founder of The Allman Brothers Band.\n\nShe filed for divorce just nine days later, because of his heroin and alcohol problems, but they reconciled within a month. However, they divorced in 1979.\n\nIs Cher married now?\n\nCher is not married. In late 2022, she confirmed that she was in a relationship with 36-year-old music producer Alexander Edwards.\n\nWhen asked about her dating life in 2018, she said: “I’m still on the lookout. The problem I have with all the boyfriends lately is that I don’t want to go any place with them because you can’t keep a relationship going in this kind of goldfish bowl, where everything you do and every picture you have taken will be on Instagram. There’s no way to keep something… special.”\n\nWhen Tom Cruise and Cher secretly dated in the 1980s: 'There was a connection'\n\nOther famous faces Cher has been romantically linked to, include Tom Cruise, Hell's Angel Tim Medvetz, comic book writer Ron Zimmerman, Toto's David Paich and Kiss frontman Gene Simmons.\n\nHow many children does Cher have?\n\nWith Sonny, Cher had one child, Chaz Bono, in 1969. In 2009, Chaz came out as a transgender man, and his transition from female to male was legally finalised a year later.\n\nChaz has worked as an activist for various causes, and has acted in several projects including American Horror Story.\n\nWith Gregg Allman, she had one child, Elijah Blue, born in 1976. He is the singer and guitarist for the rock band Deadsy.\n\nWhat is Cher's net worth?\n\nCher is estimated to have a net worth of around $320 million (£241m).\n\nWhat is Cher's vocal range?\n\nCher - Believe [Official Music Video]\n\nCher has a contralto singing voice, and has been described by author Nicholas E Tawa as \"bold, deep, and with a spacious vibrato\".\n\nRemembering the time Cher performed a hilarious medley with the Jackson 5\n\nAnn Powers of The New York Times called it \"a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky, a fine vehicle for projecting personality.\""
