Not to be confused with Archduke Stephen of Austria (Palatine of Hungary).

Archduke Stefan of Austria (15 August 1932 – 12 November 1998), was a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and the eldest child and son of Archduke Anton of Austria and his wife Princess Ileana of Romania. A great-greatgrandson of Queen Victoria, Tsar Alexander II, Queen Maria II of Portugal, and King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and had a career in automobile design. He was commonly referred to as Stefan Habsburg or less frequently as Stefan Habsburg-Lothringen.

Biography[edit]

Stefan was born at 3.00 a.m. on 15 August 1932 in Mödling, Austria[1][2] where his grandmother Queen Marie of Romania had rented a summer villa for her daughter's family.[3] He was baptised 30 August 1932 in the parish church of Saint Othmar in Mödling.[4][5] His mother was still recovering from the birth, so Stefan was carried to the font by his aunt Archduchess Margarita.[4] His godfather was King Alfonso XIII of Spain.[1][6] His other godfather was his uncle King Carol II of Romania who was unable to be present for the ceremony where he was represented by his sister Elisabeth, Queen of Greece.[1][4]

Stefan spent the first years of his childhood in Schloss Sonnberg, a castle owned by his father near Hollabrunn. In 1942, he moved with his parents and four sisters and brother to Romania. While there, Stefan's parents made their residence at Bran, Braşov. After his first cousin, King Michael of Romania, was forced to abdicate and was expelled by the Communist regime late in 1947, Stefan left Romania with his parents. Stefan lived first in Switzerland, then in Argentina, and finally in the United States. In the late 1950s Stefan was naturalized as a United States citizen.

Stefan attended Malvern Preparatory School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[7] In 1955 he graduated with the degree Bachelor of Science from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of MIT with a thesis entitled "'Tornado' Design of a Gas-Turbine Powered Passenger Car".[8][9] He established a division for advanced research at General Motors in Detroit, Michigan. In 1970 he received the degree Master of Business Administration from Wayne State University with a thesis entitled "People, Ideas and Environment: The Creative Problem Solving Process in a Contemporary Organization".[10][9]

Marriage and children[edit]

While a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stefan met Massachusetts School of Art student Mary Jerrine Soper (born 19 June 1931, Boston) at a dance. The couple married morganatically on 26 August 1954 at St. Elizabeth's Church in Milton, Massachusetts. Mary Jerrine Soper was the daughter of Charles Beattie Soper and wife Agnes McNeil.[2][11][12]

Stefan and Jerrine had five children:[2] Christopher (born 1957)[13][14], Ileana (born 1958), Peter (born 1959), Constanza (born 1960), and Anton (born 1964). The couple divorced in 1994.[15]

Stefan died of cancer 12 December 1998 in Brighton, Michigan.[2][9] His funeral mass was held at Saint Wenceslaus Catholic Church in Leland, Michigan with burial in the adjoining cemetery.[9] Many years after Stefan's death, Karl, Archduke of Austria de-morganaticized a number of Habsburg marriages, Stefan’s included, meaning his children acquired the title Archduchess/Archduke of Austria etc.[16]

Stefan's former wife Jerrine and the mother of his children died 14 July 2015, in Farmington Hills, Michigan.[17]

Title and style[edit]

Stefan was born in Austria where the Adelsaufhebungsgesetz of 10 April 1919 had abolished the nobility and titles. In spite of this law, monarchists continued to refer to him as His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke Stefan of Austria, Prince of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany,[18] and his archducal title was engraved onto his gravestone.[19] Even before he became an American citizen Stefan was commonly referred to as Stefan Habsburg or less frequently as Stefan Habsburg-Lothringen.
