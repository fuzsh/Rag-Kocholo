        "text": "IOTL the German navy NEVER reached more than around 50% of ´RNs strength. It was an arms race Germany could not win.\n\nThus I assumed the 35% ratio (also the ratio of the 1930 agreement with Nazi Germany)\n\nRetreat from Belgium is a no brainer - both terms would allow UK to \"claim victory\"\n\nConcerning France. if one can accept that UK is favorable to peace now, I think France might settle to pre war borders (this includes Luxembourg).\n\nAs a \"trick\" assume Germany allows for a plebiscite in Alsace Lorraine.- after peace negotiations are finnised and after German retreat from France (but secretly germany plans to keep substantial troops in A-L and plans to allow this troops to vote... - laying seed for further conflict)\n\nThe colonies - I assume German east africa will stay German - but the rest I don't know... Germany has not lost on the battlefield, so it would want their posessions back (matter of pride) - Lets assume Germany offers (secretly) to fully support UK and Japan in matters concerning China (add Germany to the Anglo Japanese Alliance - potential conflict with US )\n\nAustria Hungary will have to be content to survive (for the time) - installment of an A-H frienddly Royal House in Serbia - demilitarisation maybe...\n\nBorder to Italy - pre 1914...\n\nBulgaria should gain southern Drobrudja...\n\nFor the Ottoman Empire - there are no territorial changes (ATM), but UK gets (trade) concessions in Palestine and southern Iraq.\n\nThe Dominions certainly want to get their share, but as outlined above I prefer to return those colonies to germany (makes a more interesting future - possibly the dominions will keep more neutral in future conflict.\n\nRussia will see a more \"extended revolutionary time\" the Baltic States + Finland will have independency movements and gain full sovereignity during the Russian civil war.\n\nPS.: I know much of this stresses the things that could have been, but I like to do a nice what if execise, so a bit wiggle room should be allowed.\n\nI will fklesh this timeline fully out some directions I might explor\n\nUK/US naval arms race (immediately)\n\nDismantlement of A-H (soon)\n\nPacific War, but earlier and different alliances... (mid 30s maybe)\n\nFrench-Italian Alliance (soon)\n\nGerman/French conflict gets hot again (not sure when)\n\nJapanese/UK expansion in China - maybe conflict with France\n\nIf you are writing a TL, you get a lot of flexibility because people make really odd decisions in history. But 50-60% is still much more likely than 35%, in this TL German does not lose, but is a draw so prewar negotiations are a better starting point, after all, it will be many of the same people. Plus the starvation the Germans will be huge, and this will cause pressure for a larger Navy. The blockade issue is going to be as big a sticking point for the Germans as Belgium will be for the UK. Now I can see a situation where Germany is allowed 55% of Royal Navies size but never reaches that limit. Would an undefeated France agree to an Army so small it could never defend itself from Germany? Why does Germany agree to the same with the its Navy? Yes the UK wants it, and could easily demand it, but if there is a peace negotiation, it is very unlikely it gets it, unless there is some major concession in exchange. For example Germany would jump at the deal if France's army was limited to 35% of its prewar size.\n\nBelgium is not a no brainer. Yes, the Belgium will be \"free\", but how large can its military be? Can it have forts on the German border? What happens to Belgium Congo? What about reparations? The Germans have a good case that the UK should be paying the Belgium reparations for the illegal blockade. Is Belgium allowed a seat at the negotiations, or does the UK represent them? What about the illegal food blockade? While not a related issue for the Belgians, it is for the Germans.\n\nI can actually see prewar borders as a solution, but not selected prewar borders. I think this will be an all or nothing type item with the exception of Poland which all sides had promised to be \"independent\"\n\nOn the strength, you are right on tonnage, but not on modern capital ships. Also, while it was a difficult race for the Germans, it also was hard for the UK, and not a winning race. The Germans could have afforded to build a lot more ships without raising taxes, but chose not to. After a naval blockade, this may not be true. Hundreds of thousands starving to death can change attitudes.\n\nI don't see any way any Entente power joins with any Central power in an alliance immediately after the war or for the next 10 years.\n\nIMO, if South Africa does not get SWA, then SA is effective a neutral country leaning towards hostile to the UK. Now they may technically be in the common wealth, but they will not act like it. Sort of like India, the Queen is head of state, but otherwise independent.\n\nDuring the War the two major Central Powers agreed to the establishment of an independent Poland as it would be a buffer state against Russia. The Austro-Hungarian monarch was even willing to give it some of its Polish land. The was a caviot to it and that was that an Austrian Arch duke be considered as its king. Stefan Hapsbug had moved his family to the East and had emerst himself in everything Polish. It was he who was the canidate for King. He only refused the office when Germany wanted to dicate every move as he was to be no puppet.\n\nIf he had taken the post with a more flexible Germany the goal of an allied state might have been accomplished, especially with regard to the threat from the East.\n\nActually, it's a bit more complicated than that. Archduke Charles Stephen had inherited the estates in Galicia from his father and grandfather (Archdukes Karl Ferdinand and Charles, Duke of Teschen respectively) and two of his daughters had married Polish nobles. However, Emperor Karl had floated the possibility of annexing Poland to Austria and creating a new Kingdom on equal standing with Hungary and Austria (possibly as part of a general reorganisation). This combined with complications over the loyalties of his second son and his sons-in-law delayed the approval of his candidancy and gave the Germans the upper hand.\n\nNow, if Vienna pushes for Archduke Charles Stephen, and moves to full civilian control in Austrian Occupied Poland (or at least the cities) even though Germany maintains effective military control, we could have the recipie for a fait accompli on our hands. As for reasoning, perhaps the Emperor feels the need to prove to Berlin that it doesn't do to just ignore Vienna.\n\nIMHO the real reason for UK to enter WWI never was Belgium; they couldn’t care less about a country hardly big enough to swing a cat around in.\n\nTheir issue was Germany’s explicit ambitions in the colonial and naval race. If Germany would be in total dominance of the European continent British foreign policy wouldn’t feel sorry for the Europeans, but be worried about Germany having a great opportunity to seriously focus its resources in the colonial and naval race. That is why UK by 1914 supported it’s until then biggest rivals, France and Russia, against and old ally (Napoleonic and SYW wars) – because the biggest threat on the continent needed to be balanced by supporting that powers European rivals.\n\nBy 1914 France and Russia were Germany’s continental rivals and Belgium just a convenient pretext to draw a line in the sand towards Germany.\n\nSo if Germany can convince UK that she no longer has colonial and naval ambitions, I’m quite sure UK wouldn’t give a dam about France or Russia. But it would probably require serious naval disarmament in Germany, “sale” of German colonies to UK and of course withdrawal from Belgium.\n\nBut there need to be more in it for Germany. British acceptance of the 1914 borders could be important, but I’m not sure it would be enough for the Germans. They need something for the schoolteachers to tell the pupils – preferably something that can be shown on a map! Annexing Luxemburg is too pathetic (sorry Luxemburg, not anything personal), but erecting a number of obviously friendly vassal states might do it: i.e. Poland, the Baltic and Finland – would need German Princes on the thrones and classroom maps where they are uniformly colored in a slightly lighter shade of Germany’s color.\n\nAustria-Hungary will have to do with what they are told to take by Germany, but would probably involve some kind of vassalisation of Serbia and Romania.\n\nFrance will have to be content with Germany withdrawing from N.France and Belgium, perhaps they could get some of the German colonies (for the classroom maps). Some ill-concealed revanchist feelings in France would not be bad seen from UK, could keep the Germans occupied.\n\nRussia is screwed, but in order for the Russians to understand that, agreement probably will have to await some revolutionary turmoil. UK will be quite happy with Russia being set back a century or two in the race for the oceans.\n\nIn Germany we will have Socialdemocratic takeover at the next election.\n\nRegards\n\nSteffen Redbeard"
