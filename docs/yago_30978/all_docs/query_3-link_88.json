        "text": "(Draft, edited in December 2023 after DNA test and with new revised theories) Biography for Frank Baranosky. I (Robert Philip Webb), Frank Baranosky's Great Grandson had my DNA tested on www.Ancestry.com in 2023 and based upon results I seem to descend from Frank Baranosky. DNA shows he was Russian, Polish, Baltic / Lithuanian, Ukrainian. Orally according to family tradition he was from Lithuania. In fact Lithuania had existed under Lithuanian, Polish and Russian Monarchies. I suggest starting to study Brest, Belarus and the Monarchy there which was Polish Lithuanian as a starting point for ongoing research. City of Brest was not far from Baranow. Monarchy there like Sapieha and Jagiello resembled Frank. I believe Frank was from an impoverished Noble Family due to political turmoil in Prussia. In Ukraine, Zbarazh. Ukraine has a grassy steppe for sheep grazing. My theory is that Frank's surname comes to Lithuania via this route and along the Amber Road into Russia. Frank resembles numerous Polish Noblemen who married with the Monarchy, especially the Czartoryski Family, Maria Zofia Czartoryski and her offspring. Frank's mother's last name was Beketic which is a Croatian name near Zagreb. She was Eva Beketic. Frank's father was George Baranauskas. According to Marriage Certificate, Frank married Anna on November 20, 1901 in Pennsylvania. Frank's immigration record states his birthday as May 10, 1874 with origins in Grodno, Russia. His mother Eva Beketic did live in Grodno and I have researched and substantiated Eva Beket in Grodno. \"ic\" is a suffix. Perhaps Frank's dad was from Lithuania and his mom from nearby Grodno. There are different possible birth dates for Frank and at that time church records were kept and he may not have had a birth certificate. I am using the typed government immigration date for his birth unless I find otherwise.\n\nFrank resembled the last Royal Rurik Czar Feodor I, Czar of Russia. In fact Grodno was a Rurik city. Frank seems to have Polish noble and Russian royal roots.\n\nFrank Baranosky looked like the following Russian Grand Dukes and Tsars.\n\nPrince Gabriel Constantino of Russia, Grand Duke Michael Mikailovich of Russia, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovitch, Grand Duke Andre Vladimirovitch, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovitch, Grand Duke Sergei Mikailovitch, Tsar of Russia Ivan, Tsar Simeon of Moscow, Tsar Fedor of Russia.\n\nAll the following people may also be related to Frank Baranosky. I am still researching and creating thsi list as of December 2023: Prince Hermann Hohenlohe Langenburg (kin to Queen Victioria), Prince Heinrich XVIII Reuss Kostritz, Prince Ernst Furst zu Hohenlohe Langenburg, Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, Prince Ludwig Hohenlohe of Langenburg, Alexander Paul Ludwig Konstantin von Wurtmeburg, Rudolf Crown Prince Austria, Prince Constantin Hohenlohe Schillingsfurst , Count Roman Potocki, Jozef Potocki, Count Dracula, Count Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg, Janusz Radziwill, Jan Piotr Sapieha, Jan Pawel Sapieha, Krzysztof of Zbaraski, Ignacy Daszynski, Jan Karal Chadkievic, Gediminas, King Jagiello, Michael Kazimir Pac, King Sigismund of Poland, Emperor Francis II, Archduke Karl Ferdinand, Vladimir Putin, Archduke Charles of Teschen, Bernard Montgomery, Prince Eduard von Sachsen-Altenburg, Prince Albert Saxe Altenburg, Nicholas Maximilianovitch of Leuchtenburg, Maximilian of Leuchtenburg, Gustav IV of Sweden, Auguste Louis Senarclens de Grancy, Carl Prince Hessen and Rhine, Prince Alexander Ludwig George Friedrich Hesse and Rhine, Tomas Daronwy Isaac (I post Tomas due to mining connection).\n\nMy research used sources: Schuylkill Co Historical Society, 305 N Centre St., Pottsville, PA 17901; Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission; Historic Society of Pennsylvania; www.findagrave.com; www.wikipeida.com; google; The Latter Day Saints Morman Genealogical Library. My Family is not Morman however the Mormans have compiled records from Lithuania and Poland and I did study them for clues to Frank's identity. Also: The Kaunas Lithuania State Regional Archives.\n\nFrank Barnosky remains a mystery even for my own family. What information was passed down by word of mouth differs and often does not add up nor do the public records which also differ and do not add up and for that matter his looks as well do not add up. I do my best to document and expalin his situation.\n\nThe name Baranauskas originates in Baranow, Poland and the \"baran\" is a male sheep, ram. The Polish spelling is Baranowski. The Russian spelling is Baranovsky. This probably relates to a Barony and sheep farming. Baranauskas is the masculine form of a Lithuanian family name. Its feminine forms are: Baranauskienė (married woman or widow) and Baranauskaitė (unmarried woman). In Lithuania it is most prevalent in: Kaunas County, where 21 percent reside, Vilnius County, where 20 percent reside and Alytus County, where 17 percent reside. Baransuskas is the Lithuanian spelling. Other variations are: Baranov, Baranova, Baranowska, Baraniuk, Baranchuk, Baraniecki, Baranski, and Baranek.\n\nMost likely Frank used the Baranosky spelling and thus his tombstone is in error. \"Baranosky\" with an \"a\" was a published spelling in a Book: \"100 Years in McAdoo\" where the Baranosky General Store was illustrated.\n\nFrank was a founding father of St Casimir's Eastern Orthodox Church in McAdoo, Pennsylvania. They are buried however at Saint Mary's of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church. Frank is buried at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church Cemetery in McAdoo, Pennsylvania. The tombstone reads Frank Barnosky though the name is also spelled Baronosky and originally Baranauskaus. They were Roman Catholics and at times seem to also have been Russian / Lithuanian Eastern Orthodox.\n\nFrank Baransuskaus I believe is a Royal / Noble Polish / Russian / Lithuanian descent. My DNA test confirms these regions and upon researching the topic numerous pictures of historic figures connected to the Jagiello Royal Dynasty and Polish Noble Families resemble Frank Baranosky.c Lithuania has been under rule of the Russians, Polish and Lithuanians at times. The Commonwealth of Poland, known as the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was ruled by a common monarch who was both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest countries of 16th to 17th-centuries Europe. Frank Baranosky I believe is part of the Jagiellonian Dynasty which at times held Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. It is intermarried with many European Royal Families in Russia, Austria, Italy, Spain for example. Also with Polish and other Noble Families.\n\nAt the Kaunas Lithuania State Regional Archives, Wikipedia and Find a Grave websites I found information pointing to Frank's father's origins in Zeimiai, Kedainial, Lithuania. Gravestones were found for Baranauskas in Krokialaukis, Lithuania and Gelgaudiskis Lithuania. For Anna his wife, gravestones found at Prienai, Lithuania and Birstonas, Lithuania.\n\nThese Lithuanian places are more or less along the Nemunas River. Birstonas is a Royal Spa Town viusited all throughout history by Grand Dukes. Gelgaudiškis belonged to the Grand Dukes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1504, King and Grand Duke Aleksander Jagiellon gave it away as a gift to his royal secretary Sapieżyc, progenitor to the szlachta family of Sapieha noble family. Afterwards it belonged to families of Massalski, Dembiński, Oziembłowski, Giełgud, Czartoryski, the Prussian Barons von Keudell, and finally Komar family (till the beginning of World War I). In the interwar period, the establishment was nationalized and housed an orphanage and later a school. Prienai was given by Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander to the noble Mykolas Glinskis, who, following his exile from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, became the tutor of his nephew Ivan the Terrible, Czar of Russia. The city was expanded in 1791 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanislaw II Augustus. In 1579, Prienai was given by Grand Duke of Lithuania Steponas Batoras to the Hungarian nobleman Gabriel Bekes. Afterwards, it became the property of another Hungarian nobleman, named Kaspar Horvat. In 1616, the Lithuanian nobleman and politician Steponas Pacas, who would later become the Deputy Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, acquired Prienai. He and his sons Stanislovas and Mikalojus Pacas owned it up until 1643. For almost one and a half centuries, Prienai was ruled by the Butler family. In 1661, Count Gothard Wilhelm Butler, a Lithuanian nobleman of distant Scottish descent, built the Prienai castle. However, in 1701, during the Great Northern War, the castle together with its amenities was completely destroyed. The Butler family had built a spacious two-storeyed Baroque styled manor house but it was destroyed. Following the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Prienai was invaded and occupied by Prussia. Prussia ruled there during the years 1795-1807 and made Prienai part of New East Prussia. A paper mill established there produced extraordinary high quality white, coloured and wrapping paper, which was often exported to cities as distant as Warsaw and Saint Petersburg, Russia. After Napoleon defeated Prussia, Prussian occupied Lithuanian territories were transferred to the newly established Duchy of Warsaw. During the years 1807–1813, Prienai belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw. The Napoleonic code was then introduced in this region, which abolished serfdom and guaranteed equality before the law.\n\nFrank was according to oral history in my family born in Vilnius, Lithuania however some public records say Poland. His Marriage Certificates say Poland and yet Pennsylvania Census says Lithuania. His daughter Constance also sometimes said he was Russian. To clarify though Lithuania and Poland both belonged to The Russian Czars. The Baltic States including Lithuania were Russian and The Czars both Alexander III and Nicholas II in Frank's lifetime had claimed themselves also Kings of Poland. This may be the confusion. I never heard any reference to Poland other than public records I saw and I do not have an exact explanation. It seems though prior to Lithuania he is Polish.\n\nFamily tradition held that Frank was born in 1874 and yet records show a different date possibly of July 1869 illustrated here. Records state he was from Poland on Marriage Certificates here yet on Naturalization Records in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania records state he was from Lithuania.\n\nFrank was an immigrant Coal Miner but later in life not a poor working miner and may have been an intermediary between common workers and mine owners and operators. These owners needed cheap labor and recruited Europeans at that time through Ellis, Island, New York and then via Pennsylvania Station in New York which took them by railway to McAdoo, Pennsylvania. Rail controlled everything for distribution and commerce could not exist without it. I surmise Frank was possibly even then involved in human trafficking the Mining Corporations with inside Government connections making fictitious records for them and easily transporting people by train. In fact at Ellis Island Immigration Officials could not spell or pronounce European names and alphabets were sometimes different so they went by sound. There is something now called The Soundex which is an effort to understand this. With a little cash slipped in the palms of corrupt Immigration Officials people could call themselves anything they wanted to and without identity papers names were changed. There were also coal mines in Lithuania. Was Frank's family in Europe in mining industry ? I think it is a possibility.\n\nFrank may have left for America via Lithuanian and/or Russian Ports into New York nearby Pennsylvainia. My theory is that they left for America by the Port of Klaipeda, Lithuania which was on the Amber Road and used in the Christianization of Europe and for trafficking in many goods and people. The Port of NY and Ellis Island seems to be the entry point for many at that time. My Grandma Constnace Webb travelled only by ship in the old world tradition. Perhaps there were multiple trips back and forth. Pennsylvania was filled with Irish, Polish and Italian immigrants. They were coming to the New World America for a new life free from politics in Europe. America promised riches to the poor. I have been told many conflicting things I think because my Grandmother, Constance Webb, Frank's daughter, wanted the truth a secret.\n\nFrank and Anna established a Baranosky General Store also. In mining towns the company stores were generally owned by the mining companies which were exploitive of the workers. At their conveneinece store they played the Italian Numbers Game and sold blueberries trucking them into Manhattan. The Baranosky Family did end up owning its own General Store and did fairly well for a mining family in that they owned their own home and store however they were not prosperous. They were a middle income mining family and miners generally very poor they were immigrants and did well for their situations.\n\nDiagonally across the street one can see in McAdoo the strong Russian Orthodox architecture tradition there as immigrants built churches in Russian tradition with the onion \"garlic\" dome. While the history has been confused I feel sure it was intended to be a garlic dome as garlic was used to ward off evil spirits and vampirism. When Jesus proclaimed \"one eat of his flesh and drink his blood\" in The Last Supper, some Vampires who subverted the Church and were involved in occultism took this literally and were involved in human sacrifice. In truth the strong smell of garlic did keep creatures away and that is the folkore into ancient cooking and potions, spells and brews, etc all linked to European Paganism prior to its Christianization by the Monarchy and Rome in the Crusades. I mention this here as these were superstitious european immigrants in another era. The entire area is eastern european influenced including Russian. Frank's daughter Constance Webb while catholic was also involved in some superstitious occultism.\n\nAs I said family tradition passed down by word of mouth to us held Frank to have had two wives.\n\nFrank was in two female partner relationships legal marriages or not. First to an Eva Montvale or spelled Montville and he had two daughters in this first relationship. Records of this are St Casimir's records now kept at All Saints Church. Searching records an unsigned marriage certificate was found naming an Amelka Davaich as a spouse. This was perhaps someone Frank never married. It is not signed nor activated from a legal perspective.\n\n1) Kathryn \"Kittie\" who married a Mr. Landsburgh and had no offspring.\n\n2) Marcella \"Domcella\" or \"Domcey\" who married Mr. Valukonis and had no offspring.\n\nIn the second relationship which was a marriage to Anna Andruskievic (also known as:\n\nAndriuškevičius and Anderson) with Frank there were 7 children however the first Adolph died young leaving only 6. Anna we believe was a Nun before she married. They were:\n\n1) John Baronosky who married and had two children, Jerome \"Jerry\" and Judy who married a Mr. Holden.\n\n2) Frank Baronosky, Jr. who married and had four children: Frank, III; Edwina who married Mr. Greenawalt; \"Cookie\"; and Edward \"Neddie\".\n\n3) Florence Baronosky married Matthew Wydallis and had one son Bruce Wydallis.\n\n4) Albena \"Binx\" who married a Mr. Mosdin and had one daughter Marcia who married Tom Mitchell.\n\n5) Constance \"Cha Cha\" who married Charles Allen Webb, Jr.\n\n6) Mary who married John A. \"Raabs\" Rehal and had a daughter Bonita \"Bonnie\" who married Dominic Hoats and they had three children who are Dean, Dan and Renee. Mary attended Saint Kunegundas.\n\n1920 Pennsylvania US Census listing Frank Baranosky spelled as Barnoskiy - the same person. Here this record conflicts with other records and orally Frank says to census taker he is from Lithuania and immigrated in 1892 and is naturalized in 1904. There is a naturalization record for Frank in Luzerne Co., PA I found at one time. This record says he was wage earning coal miner. Children in the household at that time again orally listed were:\n\nDrusilla age 23 in 1920. * I have never heard of a Drusilla being an immediate family member so this may be a daughter of Frank's from first marriage. Those daughters were \"Kittie\" and \"Marsalla\" ; John age 16 ; Frank age 15 ; Laurence age 13 * this is Florence and was misheard by census taker; Albina age 2 we called \"Binx\" ; Gesta age 7 * I have also never heard of Gesta and judging by birth order and dates thus most probably my grandmother Constance. I am thinking this was \"Jester\" a name called by her Father ; Mary age 5.\n\nA Family picture taken in the Spring of 1940 identifies them as follows:\n\nBottom row: Jerry Baranosky (son of John J. Baranosky and Helen Lisbinski Baranosky); Anna Ogrodnik Baranosky with son Frank Baranosky III, also known as \"Butch\"; Helen Lisbinski Baranosky with Judy Baranosky (daughter of Helen and John J. Baranosky); Anna Baranosky; Florence Baranosky Wydallis with Bruce (son of Florence and Matt Wydallis); Edwina \"Winnie\" Baranosky, (daughter of Anna Ogrodnik Baranosky and Frank Baranosky, Jr.).\n\nBack row: Mary Baranosky Rehal, Frank Baranosky Jr., Edward \"Ned\" Baranosky (son of Anna Ogrodnik Baranosky and Frank Baranosky, Jr.), John J. Baranosky, Albina \"Binx\" Baranosky Mosdin.\n\nThe Baranoskys lived in a duplex at 102 and 104 E. Blaine St., McAdoo, PA which is now a vacant lot. The duplex on one side was their General Store. This as at E Blaine and S Cleveland, McAdoo PA. They lived on one side and one side was the Baranosky General Store. Frank was doing well to be able to afford his own business as the This is the parcel of land Frank Barnosky lived on with his Family but the house was burned and demolished. After Frank land sold to Debbie Elko and then sold to Damiano Funeral Home which uses it now as a Garage and parking for its business.\n\nFranks daughter Florence Wydallis lived in a house on E. Washington St in McAdoo next to 102 E Washington St. Land was sold to adjacent church which was not a Baronosky Paroch. I mention this clue because Aunt Flo Wydallis was a big part of keeping up family ties and very family oriented so I have memories of her as a child. Flo was my grandmother Constance'sister. I knew Flo very well and she was a wonderful warm person.\n\nWe know that Frank had two female relationships or wives and two sets of children. Perhaps he married only once officially I do not know ?\n\nOne of these sets of records shown here (RECORD 1) shows that Frank was married before to an \"\"Amelka Davaich\"\" ? b. 1879 in Poland, a Maid. (Record 2) shows Frank was married before to \"\"Anna Anruschkawich\"\" ? b. 1876 in Poland, a Dressmaker. Both Marriage Licenses were issued in 1901 sworn before a Justice, \"\"Stapleton\"\" ? How could this be ? Is this a recording error, identity fraud, corrupt Judge, mistake or is there another explanation. Both indicate Anna and Frank were likely married in 1901.\n\nA 1920 Census in McAdoo, Schuylkill Co., PA lists Frank as Lithuanian and yet a Marriage Certificate to his second wife Anna says he was from Poland. Some Public Records say Baronoskiy and others Barnosky or Baronosky. In my research I also see Baranovsky and Baranovskij but do not recall these spellings passed down by oral tradition in my Family.\n\nFrank verbally said he was from Vilnius, Lithuania to census taker yet some records such as marriage certificates say Poland. He is listed in 1920 Census in McAdoo, Schuylkill Co., PA. I did find a Naturalization Record I think is probably his and that is for June 15, 1896 in Wilkes Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The census says he was naturalized in 1904. He married twice. The surname of the first spouse may have been Montvale by verbal tradition or an Amelka Davaich for whom a record exists. Montvale is what I was told but this may be a mistake and there was a marriage certificate for both Anna Andruscavage also spelled Anruschkavich as well as a marriage certificate for Amelka Davaich. The 1920 census lists a Drusilla Barnosky and this may be a child from Frank's first marriage ? That would refer to either \"Domcey\" or \"Kittie\". It also lists, John, Frank, \"Laurence\" an error for Florence, Albina for \"Binx\", Gesta who is probably Constance and lastly Mary, the youngest.\n\nThere is apparently a connection between Frank Baranosky and the European Monarchy and Nobility especially in Russia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Bohemia. Frank resembled some and the DNA suggests it is true. Regarding Russia, Frank resembled Grigori Rasputin, Mystic to Russian Czar Nicholas, II. Russian Czarina's Lady in Waiting was Polish Nobility Sophie Buxhoevden. Tsarina Alexandra was kin to Queen Victoria. Frank may also have been related to Czar Ivan of Russia. Frank resembled others incl. Hubert Salvatore, Archduke Karl Ferdinand, Alfred Packer, Maria Carolina, Princess Maria Amelia and Bernard Montgomery. This is likely due to the fact the King Jagiello's branch of Polish Monarchy married with the Hungarians and others. Austro-Hungarians. This is why we see similar face types and to Sophie Chotek of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569. In 1386 Polish queen Jadwiga (Hedwig) married Lithuania's Grand Duke Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland. Jagiello, (c. 1352/1362 – 1 June 1434) Born a pagan, he converted to Catholicism in 1386 and was baptized. In 1387, he converted Lithuania to Catholicism. He was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland also previously also known as the Gediminid dynasty in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The dynasty ruled both states until 1572 and became one of the most influential dynasties in late medieval and early modern Europe.\n\nJagiello was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was the son of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana of Tver, who was the daughter of the Yaroslavichi prince Alexander of Tver, Russia. Uliana was Russian. He lived in Vilnius at his father's manor. In the 1470s, Mikhail III of Tver signed a number of treaties with Russian Czar Ivan III. The army of Ivan III swiftly conquered Tver in 1485. The principality was then annexed by Muscovy and given to Ivan's son Ivan the Young. After Uliana's father and eldest brother were murdered by Öz Beg Khan in 1339, Uliana was placed in care of Simeon of Moscow, who married Uliana's elder sister Maria in 1347. Simeon Ivanovich (7 September 1317 – 27 April 1353), also known as Semyon Ivanovich was Prince of Moscow and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1340 to 1353. He was the son of of Ivan I.\n\nJadwiga, wife of Jagiello was the daughter of Louis I (5 March 1326 – 10 September 1382), who was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1342 and King of Poland from 1370.\n\nCasimir IV of Lithuania (30 November 1427 – 7 June 1492) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1440 and King of Poland from 1447 until his death in 1492. Under him, Poland defeated the Teutonic Knights in the Thirteen Years' War and recovered Pomerania. The Jagiellonian dynasty became one of the leading royal houses in Europe. The great triumph of his reign was bringing Prussia under Polish rule.\n\nFrank Baranosky looked like Casimir IV.\n\nCasimir IV's children became Royals all over Euriope. The children were: Vladislaus II King of Bohemia and Hungary, Hedwig, Duchess of Bavaria, St. Casimir Jagiellon, John I Albert of Poland, Alexander of Poland, Sophia, Margravine of Brandenburg, Sigismund I the Old, Frederick Jagiellon, Anna Jagiellon, Duchess of Pomerania, Barbara, Duchess of Saxony, Elizabeth. Of the above children, in 1468, Sophia was first betrothed to Archduke Maximilian of Austria, son and heir of Emperor Frederick III. Frederick III (21 September 1415 – 19 August 1493) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death in 1493. He was the fourth king and first emperor of the House of Habsburg. He was crowned by the Pope.\n\nThis relationship with the Austrian/Hungarian habsburgs is why we see some of Frank Baranoksy's relatives have Title Archduke. For example Archduke Karl Ferdinand who looked so much like Frank Baranosky. Karl Ferdinand married his first cousin, Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria (1831–1903), the widow of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, the daughter of Archduke Joseph of Austria, Palatine of Hungary and the mother of Queen Maria Theresia of Bavaria. Karl Ferdinand had six children: Archduke Franz Joseph of Austria (1855), Archduke Friedrich of Austria, Duke of Teschen (1856–1936), Supreme Commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria (1858–1929), married King Alfonso XII of Spain, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria (1860–1933), Admiral, Archduke Eugen of Austria (1863–1954), Fieldmarshal, Archduchess Maria Eleonora of Austria (1864).\n\nTracking Frank Baranosky with pictures leads me to point to: Sigismund II Augustus (1 August 1520 – 7 July 1572). He was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, the son of Sigismund I the Old, whom Sigismund II succeeded in 1548. He was the first ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the last male monarch from the Jagiellonian dynasty. Sigismund was the only son of Italian-born Bona Sforza the Milan, Italy Royal Family. So Frank Baranosky may in fact be part Italian. Bona was born on 2 February 1494, in Vigevano, Milan, as the third of the four children of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, the legal heir to the Duchy of Milan, and Isabella of Naples, daughter of King Alfonso II of Naples from the House of Trastámara. Bona's family moved to the Sforza Castle in Milan.\n\nThe Family was maried also with Polish Noble Families and Nobleman. Frank Baranosky looks like some. The Szlachta were the noble estate of the realm in the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth who, as a class, had the dominating position in the state.\n\nJan Karol Chodkiewicz (c.1561 – 24 September 1621) was a military commander of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army. His coat of arms was Chodkiewicz. Another was Michał Kazimierz Pac (c. 1624 – 4 April 1682) who was a nobleman and prominent military leader of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Members of the magnate Pac family. Another was Andrzej Sapieha (1539 – October 11, 1621) a Polish–Lithuanian nobleman of the Sapieha family. Another is Herman Wrangel (born 1584/1587 – 10 December 1643) who was a Swedish military officer and statesman of Baltic German extraction.\n\nSpelling Variations for Baronosky:\n\nLithuanians with similar sounding names\n\nBaranauskas, Antanas b, 1835 Lithuania\n\nBaron in Russia, Latvia and Ukraine\n\nBarnick is Russia and Ukraines\n\nBaronik in Lithuania\n\nBaronite in Lithuania and Russia\n\nBaronov in Russia\n\nBarons in Latvia\n\nBarron in Lithuania\n\nBarn in Ukraine\n\nBarnes in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nBary in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nBaranovskij\n\nBaranowski, Felix b. 1882\n\nBaranowski, Henrik b. 1884\n\nBaranowski, Dominik and Agatha Cabilka\n\nBaranowski, Karoline b 1882 Byelorussia, Ulla\n\nBaranowski, Leonid b 1834 Minsk, Byelorussia\n\nBaranowski, Maria b. 1880 Byelorussia\n\nBaranowski, Peter b.

I (Robert Philip Webb), Frank Baranosky's Great Grandson had my DNA tested on www.Ancestry.com in 2023 and based upon results I seem to descend from Frank Baranosky. DNA shows he was Russian, Polish, Baltic / Lithuanian, Ukrainian. Orally according to family tradition he was from Lithuania. In fact Lithuania had existed under Lithuanian, Polish and Russian Monarchies. I suggest starting to study Brest, Belarus and the Monarchy there which was Polish Lithuanian as a starting point for ongoing research. City of Brest was not far from Baranow. Monarchy there like Sapieha and Jagiello resembled Frank. I believe Frank was from an impoverished Noble Family due to political turmoil in Prussia. In Ukraine, Zbarazh. Ukraine has a grassy steppe for sheep grazing. My theory is that Frank's surname comes to Lithuania via this route and along the Amber Road into Russia. Frank resembles numerous Polish Noblemen who married with the Monarchy, especially the Czartoryski Family, Maria Zofia Czartoryski and her offspring. Frank's mother's last name was Beketic which is a Croatian name near Zagreb. She was Eva Beketic. Frank's father was George Baranauskas. According to Marriage Certificate, Frank married Anna on November 20, 1901 in Pennsylvania. Frank's immigration record states his birthday as May 10, 1874 with origins in Grodno, Russia. His mother Eva Beketic did live in Grodno and I have researched and substantiated Eva Beket in Grodno. \"ic\" is a suffix. Perhaps Frank's dad was from Lithuania and his mom from nearby Grodno. There are different possible birth dates for Frank and at that time church records were kept and he may not have had a birth certificate. I am using the typed government immigration date for his birth unless I find otherwise.\n\nFrank resembled the last Royal Rurik Czar Feodor I, Czar of Russia. In fact Grodno was a Rurik city. Frank seems to have Polish noble and Russian royal roots.\n\nFrank Baranosky looked like the following Russian Grand Dukes and Tsars.\n\nPrince Gabriel Constantino of Russia, Grand Duke Michael Mikailovich of Russia, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovitch, Grand Duke Andre Vladimirovitch, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovitch, Grand Duke Sergei Mikailovitch, Tsar of Russia Ivan, Tsar Simeon of Moscow, Tsar Fedor of Russia.\n\nAll the following people may also be related to Frank Baranosky. I am still researching and creating thsi list as of December 2023: Prince Hermann Hohenlohe Langenburg (kin to Queen Victioria), Prince Heinrich XVIII Reuss Kostritz, Prince Ernst Furst zu Hohenlohe Langenburg, Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, Prince Ludwig Hohenlohe of Langenburg, Alexander Paul Ludwig Konstantin von Wurtmeburg, Rudolf Crown Prince Austria, Prince Constantin Hohenlohe Schillingsfurst , Count Roman Potocki, Jozef Potocki, Count Dracula, Count Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg, Janusz Radziwill, Jan Piotr Sapieha, Jan Pawel Sapieha, Krzysztof of Zbaraski, Ignacy Daszynski, Jan Karal Chadkievic, Gediminas, King Jagiello, Michael Kazimir Pac, King Sigismund of Poland, Emperor Francis II, Archduke Karl Ferdinand, Vladimir Putin, Archduke Charles of Teschen, Bernard Montgomery, Prince Eduard von Sachsen-Altenburg, Prince Albert Saxe Altenburg, Nicholas Maximilianovitch of Leuchtenburg, Maximilian of Leuchtenburg, Gustav IV of Sweden, Auguste Louis Senarclens de Grancy, Carl Prince Hessen and Rhine, Prince Alexander Ludwig George Friedrich Hesse and Rhine, Tomas Daronwy Isaac (I post Tomas due to mining connection).\n\nMy research used sources: Schuylkill Co Historical Society, 305 N Centre St., Pottsville, PA 17901; Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission; Historic Society of Pennsylvania; www.findagrave.com; www.wikipeida.com; google; The Latter Day Saints Morman Genealogical Library. My Family is not Morman however the Mormans have compiled records from Lithuania and Poland and I did study them for clues to Frank's identity. Also: The Kaunas Lithuania State Regional Archives.\n\nFrank Barnosky remains a mystery even for my own family. What information was passed down by word of mouth differs and often does not add up nor do the public records which also differ and do not add up and for that matter his looks as well do not add up. I do my best to document and expalin his situation.\n\nThe name Baranauskas originates in Baranow, Poland and the \"baran\" is a male sheep, ram. The Polish spelling is Baranowski. The Russian spelling is Baranovsky. This probably relates to a Barony and sheep farming. Baranauskas is the masculine form of a Lithuanian family name. Its feminine forms are: Baranauskienė (married woman or widow) and Baranauskaitė (unmarried woman). In Lithuania it is most prevalent in: Kaunas County, where 21 percent reside, Vilnius County, where 20 percent reside and Alytus County, where 17 percent reside. Baransuskas is the Lithuanian spelling. Other variations are: Baranov, Baranova, Baranowska, Baraniuk, Baranchuk, Baraniecki, Baranski, and Baranek.\n\nMost likely Frank used the Baranosky spelling and thus his tombstone is in error. \"Baranosky\" with an \"a\" was a published spelling in a Book: \"100 Years in McAdoo\" where the Baranosky General Store was illustrated.\n\nFrank was a founding father of St Casimir's Eastern Orthodox Church in McAdoo, Pennsylvania. They are buried however at Saint Mary's of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church. Frank is buried at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church Cemetery in McAdoo, Pennsylvania. The tombstone reads Frank Barnosky though the name is also spelled Baronosky and originally Baranauskaus. They were Roman Catholics and at times seem to also have been Russian / Lithuanian Eastern Orthodox.\n\nFrank Baransuskaus I believe is a Royal / Noble Polish / Russian / Lithuanian descent. My DNA test confirms these regions and upon researching the topic numerous pictures of historic figures connected to the Jagiello Royal Dynasty and Polish Noble Families resemble Frank Baranosky.c Lithuania has been under rule of the Russians, Polish and Lithuanians at times. The Commonwealth of Poland, known as the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was ruled by a common monarch who was both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest countries of 16th to 17th-centuries Europe. Frank Baranosky I believe is part of the Jagiellonian Dynasty which at times held Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. It is intermarried with many European Royal Families in Russia, Austria, Italy, Spain for example. Also with Polish and other Noble Families.\n\nAt the Kaunas Lithuania State Regional Archives, Wikipedia and Find a Grave websites I found information pointing to Frank's father's origins in Zeimiai, Kedainial, Lithuania. Gravestones were found for Baranauskas in Krokialaukis, Lithuania and Gelgaudiskis Lithuania. For Anna his wife, gravestones found at Prienai, Lithuania and Birstonas, Lithuania.\n\nThese Lithuanian places are more or less along the Nemunas River. Birstonas is a Royal Spa Town viusited all throughout history by Grand Dukes. Gelgaudiškis belonged to the Grand Dukes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1504, King and Grand Duke Aleksander Jagiellon gave it away as a gift to his royal secretary Sapieżyc, progenitor to the szlachta family of Sapieha noble family. Afterwards it belonged to families of Massalski, Dembiński, Oziembłowski, Giełgud, Czartoryski, the Prussian Barons von Keudell, and finally Komar family (till the beginning of World War I). In the interwar period, the establishment was nationalized and housed an orphanage and later a school. Prienai was given by Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander to the noble Mykolas Glinskis, who, following his exile from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, became the tutor of his nephew Ivan the Terrible, Czar of Russia. The city was expanded in 1791 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanislaw II Augustus. In 1579, Prienai was given by Grand Duke of Lithuania Steponas Batoras to the Hungarian nobleman Gabriel Bekes. Afterwards, it became the property of another Hungarian nobleman, named Kaspar Horvat. In 1616, the Lithuanian nobleman and politician Steponas Pacas, who would later become the Deputy Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, acquired Prienai. He and his sons Stanislovas and Mikalojus Pacas owned it up until 1643. For almost one and a half centuries, Prienai was ruled by the Butler family. In 1661, Count Gothard Wilhelm Butler, a Lithuanian nobleman of distant Scottish descent, built the Prienai castle. However, in 1701, during the Great Northern War, the castle together with its amenities was completely destroyed. The Butler family had built a spacious two-storeyed Baroque styled manor house but it was destroyed. Following the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Prienai was invaded and occupied by Prussia. Prussia ruled there during the years 1795-1807 and made Prienai part of New East Prussia. A paper mill established there produced extraordinary high quality white, coloured and wrapping paper, which was often exported to cities as distant as Warsaw and Saint Petersburg, Russia. After Napoleon defeated Prussia, Prussian occupied Lithuanian territories were transferred to the newly established Duchy of Warsaw. During the years 1807–1813, Prienai belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw. The Napoleonic code was then introduced in this region, which abolished serfdom and guaranteed equality before the law.\n\nFrank was according to oral history in my family born in Vilnius, Lithuania however some public records say Poland. His Marriage Certificates say Poland and yet Pennsylvania Census says Lithuania. His daughter Constance also sometimes said he was Russian. To clarify though Lithuania and Poland both belonged to The Russian Czars. The Baltic States including Lithuania were Russian and The Czars both Alexander III and Nicholas II in Frank's lifetime had claimed themselves also Kings of Poland. This may be the confusion. I never heard any reference to Poland other than public records I saw and I do not have an exact explanation. It seems though prior to Lithuania he is Polish.\n\nFamily tradition held that Frank was born in 1874 and yet records show a different date possibly of July 1869 illustrated here. Records state he was from Poland on Marriage Certificates here yet on Naturalization Records in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania records state he was from Lithuania.\n\nFrank was an immigrant Coal Miner but later in life not a poor working miner and may have been an intermediary between common workers and mine owners and operators. These owners needed cheap labor and recruited Europeans at that time through Ellis, Island, New York and then via Pennsylvania Station in New York which took them by railway to McAdoo, Pennsylvania. Rail controlled everything for distribution and commerce could not exist without it. I surmise Frank was possibly even then involved in human trafficking the Mining Corporations with inside Government connections making fictitious records for them and easily transporting people by train. In fact at Ellis Island Immigration Officials could not spell or pronounce European names and alphabets were sometimes different so they went by sound. There is something now called The Soundex which is an effort to understand this. With a little cash slipped in the palms of corrupt Immigration Officials people could call themselves anything they wanted to and without identity papers names were changed. There were also coal mines in Lithuania. Was Frank's family in Europe in mining industry ? I think it is a possibility.\n\nFrank may have left for America via Lithuanian and/or Russian Ports into New York nearby Pennsylvainia. My theory is that they left for America by the Port of Klaipeda, Lithuania which was on the Amber Road and used in the Christianization of Europe and for trafficking in many goods and people. The Port of NY and Ellis Island seems to be the entry point for many at that time. My Grandma Constnace Webb travelled only by ship in the old world tradition. Perhaps there were multiple trips back and forth. Pennsylvania was filled with Irish, Polish and Italian immigrants. They were coming to the New World America for a new life free from politics in Europe. America promised riches to the poor. I have been told many conflicting things I think because my Grandmother, Constance Webb, Frank's daughter, wanted the truth a secret.\n\nFrank and Anna established a Baranosky General Store also. In mining towns the company stores were generally owned by the mining companies which were exploitive of the workers. At their conveneinece store they played the Italian Numbers Game and sold blueberries trucking them into Manhattan. The Baranosky Family did end up owning its own General Store and did fairly well for a mining family in that they owned their own home and store however they were not prosperous. They were a middle income mining family and miners generally very poor they were immigrants and did well for their situations.\n\nDiagonally across the street one can see in McAdoo the strong Russian Orthodox architecture tradition there as immigrants built churches in Russian tradition with the onion \"garlic\" dome. While the history has been confused I feel sure it was intended to be a garlic dome as garlic was used to ward off evil spirits and vampirism. When Jesus proclaimed \"one eat of his flesh and drink his blood\" in The Last Supper, some Vampires who subverted the Church and were involved in occultism took this literally and were involved in human sacrifice. In truth the strong smell of garlic did keep creatures away and that is the folkore into ancient cooking and potions, spells and brews, etc all linked to European Paganism prior to its Christianization by the Monarchy and Rome in the Crusades. I mention this here as these were superstitious european immigrants in another era. The entire area is eastern european influenced including Russian. Frank's daughter Constance Webb while catholic was also involved in some superstitious occultism.\n\nAs I said family tradition passed down by word of mouth to us held Frank to have had two wives.\n\nFrank was in two female partner relationships legal marriages or not. First to an Eva Montvale or spelled Montville and he had two daughters in this first relationship. Records of this are St Casimir's records now kept at All Saints Church. Searching records an unsigned marriage certificate was found naming an Amelka Davaich as a spouse. This was perhaps someone Frank never married. It is not signed nor activated from a legal perspective.\n\n1) Kathryn \"Kittie\" who married a Mr. Landsburgh and had no offspring.\n\n2) Marcella \"Domcella\" or \"Domcey\" who married Mr. Valukonis and had no offspring.\n\nIn the second relationship which was a marriage to Anna Andruskievic (also known as:\n\nAndriuškevičius and Anderson) with Frank there were 7 children however the first Adolph died young leaving only 6. Anna we believe was a Nun before she married. They were:\n\n1) John Baronosky who married and had two children, Jerome \"Jerry\" and Judy who married a Mr. Holden.\n\n2) Frank Baronosky, Jr. who married and had four children: Frank, III; Edwina who married Mr. Greenawalt; \"Cookie\"; and Edward \"Neddie\".\n\n3) Florence Baronosky married Matthew Wydallis and had one son Bruce Wydallis.\n\n4) Albena \"Binx\" who married a Mr. Mosdin and had one daughter Marcia who married Tom Mitchell.\n\n5) Constance \"Cha Cha\" who married Charles Allen Webb, Jr.\n\n6) Mary who married John A. \"Raabs\" Rehal and had a daughter Bonita \"Bonnie\" who married Dominic Hoats and they had three children who are Dean, Dan and Renee. Mary attended Saint Kunegundas.\n\n1920 Pennsylvania US Census listing Frank Baranosky spelled as Barnoskiy - the same person. Here this record conflicts with other records and orally Frank says to census taker he is from Lithuania and immigrated in 1892 and is naturalized in 1904. There is a naturalization record for Frank in Luzerne Co., PA I found at one time. This record says he was wage earning coal miner. Children in the household at that time again orally listed were:\n\nDrusilla age 23 in 1920. * I have never heard of a Drusilla being an immediate family member so this may be a daughter of Frank's from first marriage. Those daughters were \"Kittie\" and \"Marsalla\" ; John age 16 ; Frank age 15 ; Laurence age 13 * this is Florence and was misheard by census taker; Albina age 2 we called \"Binx\" ; Gesta age 7 * I have also never heard of Gesta and judging by birth order and dates thus most probably my grandmother Constance. I am thinking this was \"Jester\" a name called by her Father ; Mary age 5.\n\nA Family picture taken in the Spring of 1940 identifies them as follows:\n\nBottom row: Jerry Baranosky (son of John J. Baranosky and Helen Lisbinski Baranosky); Anna Ogrodnik Baranosky with son Frank Baranosky III, also known as \"Butch\"; Helen Lisbinski Baranosky with Judy Baranosky (daughter of Helen and John J. Baranosky); Anna Baranosky; Florence Baranosky Wydallis with Bruce (son of Florence and Matt Wydallis); Edwina \"Winnie\" Baranosky, (daughter of Anna Ogrodnik Baranosky and Frank Baranosky, Jr.).\n\nBack row: Mary Baranosky Rehal, Frank Baranosky Jr., Edward \"Ned\" Baranosky (son of Anna Ogrodnik Baranosky and Frank Baranosky, Jr.), John J. Baranosky, Albina \"Binx\" Baranosky Mosdin.\n\nThe Baranoskys lived in a duplex at 102 and 104 E. Blaine St., McAdoo, PA which is now a vacant lot. The duplex on one side was their General Store. This as at E Blaine and S Cleveland, McAdoo PA. They lived on one side and one side was the Baranosky General Store. Frank was doing well to be able to afford his own business as the This is the parcel of land Frank Barnosky lived on with his Family but the house was burned and demolished. After Frank land sold to Debbie Elko and then sold to Damiano Funeral Home which uses it now as a Garage and parking for its business.\n\nFranks daughter Florence Wydallis lived in a house on E. Washington St in McAdoo next to 102 E Washington St. Land was sold to adjacent church which was not a Baronosky Paroch. I mention this clue because Aunt Flo Wydallis was a big part of keeping up family ties and very family oriented so I have memories of her as a child. Flo was my grandmother Constance'sister. I knew Flo very well and she was a wonderful warm person.\n\nWe know that Frank had two female relationships or wives and two sets of children. Perhaps he married only once officially I do not know ?\n\nOne of these sets of records shown here (RECORD 1) shows that Frank was married before to an \"\"Amelka Davaich\"\" ? b. 1879 in Poland, a Maid. (Record 2) shows Frank was married before to \"\"Anna Anruschkawich\"\" ? b. 1876 in Poland, a Dressmaker. Both Marriage Licenses were issued in 1901 sworn before a Justice, \"\"Stapleton\"\" ? How could this be ? Is this a recording error, identity fraud, corrupt Judge, mistake or is there another explanation. Both indicate Anna and Frank were likely married in 1901.\n\nA 1920 Census in McAdoo, Schuylkill Co., PA lists Frank as Lithuanian and yet a Marriage Certificate to his second wife Anna says he was from Poland. Some Public Records say Baronoskiy and others Barnosky or Baronosky. In my research I also see Baranovsky and Baranovskij but do not recall these spellings passed down by oral tradition in my Family.\n\nFrank verbally said he was from Vilnius, Lithuania to census taker yet some records such as marriage certificates say Poland. He is listed in 1920 Census in McAdoo, Schuylkill Co., PA. I did find a Naturalization Record I think is probably his and that is for June 15, 1896 in Wilkes Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The census says he was naturalized in 1904. He married twice. The surname of the first spouse may have been Montvale by verbal tradition or an Amelka Davaich for whom a record exists. Montvale is what I was told but this may be a mistake and there was a marriage certificate for both Anna Andruscavage also spelled Anruschkavich as well as a marriage certificate for Amelka Davaich. The 1920 census lists a Drusilla Barnosky and this may be a child from Frank's first marriage ? That would refer to either \"Domcey\" or \"Kittie\". It also lists, John, Frank, \"Laurence\" an error for Florence, Albina for \"Binx\", Gesta who is probably Constance and lastly Mary, the youngest.\n\nThere is apparently a connection between Frank Baranosky and the European Monarchy and Nobility especially in Russia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Bohemia. Frank resembled some and the DNA suggests it is true. Regarding Russia, Frank resembled Grigori Rasputin, Mystic to Russian Czar Nicholas, II. Russian Czarina's Lady in Waiting was Polish Nobility Sophie Buxhoevden. Tsarina Alexandra was kin to Queen Victoria. Frank may also have been related to Czar Ivan of Russia. Frank resembled others incl. Hubert Salvatore, Archduke Karl Ferdinand, Alfred Packer, Maria Carolina, Princess Maria Amelia and Bernard Montgomery. This is likely due to the fact the King Jagiello's branch of Polish Monarchy married with the Hungarians and others. Austro-Hungarians. This is why we see similar face types and to Sophie Chotek of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569. In 1386 Polish queen Jadwiga (Hedwig) married Lithuania's Grand Duke Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland. Jagiello, (c. 1352/1362 – 1 June 1434) Born a pagan, he converted to Catholicism in 1386 and was baptized. In 1387, he converted Lithuania to Catholicism. He was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland also previously also known as the Gediminid dynasty in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The dynasty ruled both states until 1572 and became one of the most influential dynasties in late medieval and early modern Europe.\n\nJagiello was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was the son of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana of Tver, who was the daughter of the Yaroslavichi prince Alexander of Tver, Russia. Uliana was Russian. He lived in Vilnius at his father's manor. In the 1470s, Mikhail III of Tver signed a number of treaties with Russian Czar Ivan III. The army of Ivan III swiftly conquered Tver in 1485. The principality was then annexed by Muscovy and given to Ivan's son Ivan the Young. After Uliana's father and eldest brother were murdered by Öz Beg Khan in 1339, Uliana was placed in care of Simeon of Moscow, who married Uliana's elder sister Maria in 1347. Simeon Ivanovich (7 September 1317 – 27 April 1353), also known as Semyon Ivanovich was Prince of Moscow and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1340 to 1353. He was the son of of Ivan I.\n\nJadwiga, wife of Jagiello was the daughter of Louis I (5 March 1326 – 10 September 1382), who was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1342 and King of Poland from 1370.\n\nCasimir IV of Lithuania (30 November 1427 – 7 June 1492) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1440 and King of Poland from 1447 until his death in 1492. Under him, Poland defeated the Teutonic Knights in the Thirteen Years' War and recovered Pomerania. The Jagiellonian dynasty became one of the leading royal houses in Europe. The great triumph of his reign was bringing Prussia under Polish rule.\n\nFrank Baranosky looked like Casimir IV.\n\nCasimir IV's children became Royals all over Euriope. The children were: Vladislaus II King of Bohemia and Hungary, Hedwig, Duchess of Bavaria, St. Casimir Jagiellon, John I Albert of Poland, Alexander of Poland, Sophia, Margravine of Brandenburg, Sigismund I the Old, Frederick Jagiellon, Anna Jagiellon, Duchess of Pomerania, Barbara, Duchess of Saxony, Elizabeth. Of the above children, in 1468, Sophia was first betrothed to Archduke Maximilian of Austria, son and heir of Emperor Frederick III. Frederick III (21 September 1415 – 19 August 1493) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death in 1493. He was the fourth king and first emperor of the House of Habsburg. He was crowned by the Pope.\n\nThis relationship with the Austrian/Hungarian habsburgs is why we see some of Frank Baranoksy's relatives have Title Archduke. For example Archduke Karl Ferdinand who looked so much like Frank Baranosky. Karl Ferdinand married his first cousin, Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria (1831–1903), the widow of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, the daughter of Archduke Joseph of Austria, Palatine of Hungary and the mother of Queen Maria Theresia of Bavaria. Karl Ferdinand had six children: Archduke Franz Joseph of Austria (1855), Archduke Friedrich of Austria, Duke of Teschen (1856–1936), Supreme Commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria (1858–1929), married King Alfonso XII of Spain, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria (1860–1933), Admiral, Archduke Eugen of Austria (1863–1954), Fieldmarshal, Archduchess Maria Eleonora of Austria (1864).\n\nTracking Frank Baranosky with pictures leads me to point to: Sigismund II Augustus (1 August 1520 – 7 July 1572). He was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, the son of Sigismund I the Old, whom Sigismund II succeeded in 1548. He was the first ruler of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the last male monarch from the Jagiellonian dynasty. Sigismund was the only son of Italian-born Bona Sforza the Milan, Italy Royal Family. So Frank Baranosky may in fact be part Italian. Bona was born on 2 February 1494, in Vigevano, Milan, as the third of the four children of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, the legal heir to the Duchy of Milan, and Isabella of Naples, daughter of King Alfonso II of Naples from the House of Trastámara. Bona's family moved to the Sforza Castle in Milan.\n\nThe Family was maried also with Polish Noble Families and Nobleman. Frank Baranosky looks like some. The Szlachta were the noble estate of the realm in the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth who, as a class, had the dominating position in the state.\n\nJan Karol Chodkiewicz (c.1561 – 24 September 1621) was a military commander of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army.
