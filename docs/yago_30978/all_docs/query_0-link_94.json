        "text": "Not to be confused with Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen.\n\nThe Order of Saint Stephen (Hungarian: Szent István rend) is an order of chivalry founded in 1764 by Maria Theresa. In 1938, Miklós Horthy took the rights and activities of Grand Master as Regent of Hungary. The name of the Order changed to the Royal Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen (German: Königlich Ungarischer Sankt-Stephans-Orden, Latin: Ordo Equitum Sancti Stephani Regis (Hungariae) Apostolici). The Order was terminated at the time of the proclamation of the Second Hungarian Republic in 1946. It was recreated in 2011 as the Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen, and to this day remains the highest order in Hungary.[1][2][3]\n\nQuick Facts Order of Saint Stephen, Awarded by The Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine ...\n\nOrder of Saint Stephen\n\nAwarded by The Head of the House of Habsburg-LorraineTypeDynastic orderEstablished1764Royal houseHouse of Habsburg-LorraineReligious affiliationCatholicSovereignArchduke KarlGrand MasterArchduke GeorgClassesGrand Cross\n\nCommander\n\nKnightPrecedenceNext (higher)Military Order of Maria TheresaNext (lower)Order of Leopold (Austria)\n\nRibbon of the order\n\nClose\n\nThe order is named after Hungary's most famous king, Stephen I, whose reign (997–1038) was marked by his consolidation of the monarchy, the establishment of the medieval state of Hungary,[4] and his adoption of Christianity as the state religion. His coronation, as recognized in the Church, is dated 1001.[5] He died August 15, 1038, during the Feast of the Assumption. His feast day in Hungary is August 20. Canonized by Pope Gregory VII in 1083 along with his son Imre (who preceded him in death in 1031, after a hunting accident) and Bishop Gerhard of Hungary, St. Stephen is the patron saint of \"Hungary, kings, the death of children, masons, stonecutters, and bricklayers.\" Though its exact provenance is somewhat disputed, the Crown of St. Stephen is said to have been a gift from Pope Silvester II, upon Stephen's 1001 coronation.[6]\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa and her son, Emperor Joseph II, made several political concessions to ease tensions within their empire—most especially between Austria and Hungary, among them being the creation of the Order. Membership was available to various members of the Hungarian nobility. To receive the Order, according to collector and historian Stephen Herold,\n\none had to have at least four quarterings of arms showing as many generations of noble status. It helped promote her (Maria Theresa's) position as Queen of Hungary and reinforced the quasi independent position of Hungary in the Empire. The original statutes allow for only 20 Grand Crosses, 30 Commanders and 50 Knights who are to be \"distinguished for virtue and merit and noble birth\". Grand Cross Knights were considered so important that the Emperor was to address them as \"Cousin\". These insignia were to be returned to the Chancellery of the Order on the death of the holder. There was no military application of this order. It is rare, and even modern awards of St. Stephen are seldom seen. Perhaps more than any other Austrian order, this one approached the ideal character as put forth in its statutes and regulations.\n\nGrand Cross\n\nFor ceremonial purposes, a full set of robes were prescribed, following the tradition of other orders, such as the Austrian and Spanish Orders of the Golden Fleece and Great Britain's Order of the Garter. The robes were crimson and green, and were lined with ermine. A collar of gold was worn about the neck and shoulders, with the badge of the Order suspended from the collar. For normal occasions and every-day wear, a sash of crimson, edged with green, was worn over the right shoulder and extended to the left hip, the distinctive badge of the Order suspended from the sash at the hip. An eight-pointed star was worn on the left breast. During the waning days of the monarchy, especially during the Great War, a less formal option was also authorized, whereby a miniature (a so-called “kleine Decoration”) of the breast star was affixed to the center of the ribbon of an ordinary knight's cross, and was worn on the left breast with other orders and military medals, in order of precedence.\n\nCommanders\n\nWore the badge of the Order at the throat, suspended from the crimson edged with green ribbon about the neck. During the Great War, the informal wear of the miniature, gold, Crown of Saint Stephen kleine Decoration was worn on an ordinary knight's cross, to delineate them from ordinary knights and Grand Cross knights, and worn on the left breast with other orders and military medals, in order of precedence.\n\nKnights\n\nWore the badge of the Order, suspended from a tri-fold ribbon of crimson, edged in green, on the left breast with other orders and military medals, in order of precedence.\n\nGrand Masters\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa (May 13, 1717 – November 29, 1780), 1764–1780\n\nEmperor Josef II (March 13, 1741 – February 20, 1790), 1780–1790\n\nEmperor Leopold II (May 5, 1747 – March 1, 1792), 1790–1792\n\nEmperor Franz I (II) (12 February 1768 – 2 March 1835), 1792–1835\n\nEmperor Ferdinand I (April 19, 1793 – June 29, 1875), 1835–1848\n\nEmperor Franz Josef I (August 18, 1830 – November 21, 1916), 1848–1916\n\nEmperor Karl I (17 August 1887 – 1 April 1922), 1916–1922; deposed as emperor and king as a result of World War One, but never abdicated; received beatification (\"Blessed Charles I\") by Pope John Paul II, 2004\n\nVitéz Miklós Horthy (18 June 1868 – 9 February 1957), 1938–1944\n\nOtto von Habsburg (20 November 1912 – 4 July 2011); stepped down from his role as head of the House of Habsburg in January 2007, in favor of his son Karl.\n\nKarl von Habsburg (born 11 January 1961), 2007–present\n\nKnights, Grand Cross\n\nPrince Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz ( In Czech: Václav Antonin Kounic; 1711 – 1794), diplomat and foreign policy advisor to Maria Theresa, State Chancellor and Privy Councilor to Josef II\n\nCarl Friedrich Hatzfeldt zu Gleichen (September 14, 1718 – September 5, 1793), Austrian statesman; invested with the Grand Cross of the Royal Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen, May 6, 1764\n\nPrince Anton Esterházy de Galantha (11 April 1738 – 22 January 1794), Captain of the Hungarian Life Guards; also a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece; son of Field Marshal Prince Nicholas (\"Miklós\" in Hungarian) Esterházy, the primary patron of Joseph Haydn; nephew of Field Marshal Pal II Antal Esterházy\n\nArchduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este (1 June 1754 – 24 December 1806), fourth son of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa; heir presumptive of the Duchy of Modena\n\nArchduke Maximilian Franz of Austria (1756–1801), fifth son of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa; Grand Master of the Teutonic Order; Archbishop and Elector of Cologne\n\nAlbert, Duke of Saxony-Teschen (11 July 1738 – 10 February 1822), husband of Archduchess Maria Christine, son-in-law of Emperor Franz I Stephen and Empress Maria Theresa, and brother-in-law of Emperors Joseph II and Leopold II\n\nField Marshal Karl Josef gróf Batthyany (28.
