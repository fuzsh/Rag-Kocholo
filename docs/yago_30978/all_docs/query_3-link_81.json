In a broader meaning, it often refers to the entire Czech territory, including Moravia and Czech Silesia, especially in historical contexts, such as the Kingdom of Bohemia.\n\nCzechs are the people of Moravia and Bohemia, but they were above all in this latter region, and they are the 2/3 of the whole population. They could be divided into two large groups: those who dwelled the central part of the region and those who lived near the Saxon-Bavarian borders. True Bohemians were only those living in the central territories (Circles of Rakonitz, Prachin , Czaslau , Béraun and Kaurzim). There practically was utilized only the Bohemian language, while along the borders the largest part of the people spoke German.\n\nIn Austria people who spoke only Bohemian (Czech) were called Stokböhmisch while the German speaking people were the Utraquistes.

Patent of June 8, 1808\n\nThe farsighted and innovative Austrian Archduke Charles developed the idea of a territorial reserve, whose basic concept intended a kind of militia system with purely defensive character. Were to be considered 3 essential motives in order to this provision:\n\n1— the extensive exhaustion of the military potential of the Austrian lands, considering the positive experiences with armed citizen’s contingents (Volksaufgeboten) in Tirol and Salzburg in 1800 and 1805;\n\n2— the success of the French people's armies in the Coalition Wars, absolutely astonishing for expert military leaders coming from the school of the 17th Century;\n\n3-- as the perhaps most essential factors even were to put the low expected costs, especially for the short training time and the State arming, also for clothing and the other equipment, however, provided by the countryland and partially from the Landwehr men themselves.\n\nOn June 9th, 1808 an Imperial Patent for the people did the organizing of the Landwehr institute. The Emperor Franz said in it:\n\n“We have opened, in our Patent, Our beloved matter with the intention of an institution connected to the reserve establishment, namely for the defence of the Monarchy with such means which grant the possibility to Us to facilitate the finances of the State by decreasing those of the active Army.\n\nIn just this intention We think for good to organize a territorial Force (Landwehr) aimed only on the defence of the Fatherland.... For its execution We have appointed authorized persons, already known for their proficiency, their zeal and their devotion to Us and to the government, namely for Styria, Carinthia, Krain, Trieste and Salzburg: our esteemed Brother Imperial Highness Archduke John; our Court Commissioner Count Saurau: for Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia... ”.\n\nArchduke John did come on June 22, 1808, at Salzburg with Count Franz von Saurau in order to start the organizatione of the Landwehr. At the time they had to raise 4 battalions, the Staff Officers of which could have been retired military officers of the former Bishopric or Electoral Principate (of Salzburg), who had decided to be a volunteer in the new project. Only 4 officers and 1 Corporal for each Landwehr company had to come from the K.K. regular Army.\n\nAfter this first examples, since 1808, in the German Hereditary lands (Germany, Outer and Inner Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Tirol), they raised this Militia, organized with men fit to combat in each imperial province. I t was estimated that Austria would raise 180000 Landwehr and Hungary 50000, but such numbers were never attained; the Hungarian Diet refused to sanction it, and it was thought dangerous to raise it in Galicia, whose Poles were believed disaffected. In Bohemia, this force, (how it will be stated by Hofkriegsrat Notification of June 13, 1811), had to be of about 50000 men.\n\nLandwehr based its organisation upon the new concept of Reserve duty or Service which could lead towards a true national army, rather than towards another kind of Militia. It stated that:\n\n1 – Every man in the age of military service, from then was also required to fulfill the Reserve duty; this modified also the previous way of recruiting people;\n\n2 – After having recognized their military fitness, citizens did receive one certificate, signed by military and political authority, with which he, where it would be necessary, had to identify themselves.\n\nBut who could enlist with the Landwehr?\n\nThe service in the Landwehr was allowed to:\n\n- Residents temporarily free from service duty (i.e. religious, jobs exemptions);\n\n- Residents, who had been legally dismissed as veterans after a full duty period and had not yet served for a total period of 20 years, provided they wanted not to become Capitulanten; [22]\n\n- fit for service retired Capitulanten;\n\n- Häusler (namely inhabitants who had only house but not fields to cultivate. Also poors, contrary of the well-off people );\n\n- common Conscripts assigned to the category of various jobs (vermischten Beschäftigung)\n\n- common Conscripts with minor phisical defects;\n\n- who was signed in the Register of the less suitable subjects for the Conscription.\n\nThe Landwehr soldiers’ service was compulsory for all men aged between 18 and 45, unless they belonged to exempt categories or were army reservists. Initially they had to train themselves on every Sunday and holiday, while monthly they were gathered in larger units, coming from the nearby villages, and sent to the battalion manoeuvres, which did not have to last more than three hours. Later this system was changed and they had to instruct themselves with the weapons in short periods of 14 days, under the military Rule (generally half of the total force trained itself in Spring, the others in Autumn, or in periods stated by the territorial regiment command). When employed in these training camps, the militians were supplied by the provinces. The trainings periods was recorded by the Districts-Commissariate (which maintained the Landwehr’s lists) and signed in the personal Folios (Karten). These were managed directly by the Kreis-Hauptmanns or the Bataillons-Commandanten. In the case of a War call-to-arms the Landwehr men had to:\n\n- gather themselves in their battalions;\n\n- give their oath to the national flag;\n\n- follow the orders of their General-Commandant.\n\nThe Landwehr generally wore a grey jacket (Rock) with red facings (later various colours), had a cartridge-box (Patronentasche) with 36 cartridges, bayonet, and hats (every land battalions could have personal hats). Every battalion had also to form a special section of snipers (Scharf-schützen) generally armed with the best rifles and with the Jägerstutzen (see also Feldjäger battalions and Tirol’s Schützen).\n\nThe Model in the figure is a Waadtland Swiss type, used in all lands of Alps, for hunting. This weapon allowed a secure fire result up to 300 paces, while the common infantry muskets cannot go over a 100 paces. Landwehr firearms depended upon availability; muskets of 1754, 1774 or 1784 pattern were used, with hunting rifles, cavalry carbines, even Crespi breech loaders and air rifles among the Jägers.\n\nIn practice, shortage of equipment resulted in wide variations. Though officers and NCOs usually wore regulation dress, other ranks were permitted different uniform providing all members of a company were dressed alike. In 1808 civilian dress was adapted (sometimes simply by adding a cockade to the hat!), the only issue items being the coat and the leather equipment.\n\nThe Landwehr was proportioned to the width of the Circle (Kreis) in which it could be raised one or more battalions. Each battalion (800 men) had 4 companies; each company (200 men) had 4 platoons (Züge); each platoon (50 men) had 2 Squads or Korporalschäften of 25 men each.[23] The companies were led by an Hauptmann and 3 other officers.\n\nIn each province the Landwehr was split in two parts (Abtheilungen), the first formed by the best fit men, the second by the less fit to comBns. In this second section of that new regional armies it could be found what more resembled to the old Landmiliz or to the Town-Guards (Bürgereinheiten). It was the first draft of the nineteenth-century K.K. Landwehr (national army), in competition with the K.u.K. (gemeinsame) Heer (imperial army), while the second military choices went to form what in the future will be the K.K. Landsturm.\n\nTherefore, in this second Corps, were also the men aged from 45 till 50 years, the family fathers (Hausväter) and all who owned a firearm (till the age of 50 years); provided, all the above mentioned, they were not completely fit for the Landwehr duty. This early prototype of Landsturm had the task to provide to the order and discipline of the inner land, to defend the inner ways of communications and villages, to garrison the fortresses and towns, to escort prisoners and other military services. The 2nd Class Landwehr had less difficult duties, often ordered directly by provinces. These civil governments provided also to the soldiers uniforms and equipments. During war-time these forces were led by former Officers in retirement, recalled on duty.\n\nThe Supreme Patent Act (Allerhöchstes Patent) of June 9, 1808, stated also that the towns, villages, in which was no military unit (regular or Landwehr) had to form (with armed citizens), during wartimes, Security patrols (Sichereitswachen) and had to give men for transports duties to the army.\n\nAfter the defeat of 1809 Napoleon demanded the deactivation of the Landwehr; but registers were kept, and in 1811 it was decreed that when re-formed, they would form the fourth battalions of each Line regiment.\n\nLantveři National Army of Bohemia 1809\n\nIn Bohemia on October 31, 1808, the local Parliament (Landtag) convened in the Prague Castle, granted the sum of 1.509.000 fl. to cover the expense for the Landwehr equipments.\n\nThe Bohemian Landwehr wore “Hungarian” type uniforms of a brown “Spencer”-style jacket with red facings and braid, a round hat with black and yellow pompon, Hungarian breeches, high boots and black equipment. Otherwise those uniforms, perhaps, were those of the 1800 Archduke Charles volunteers. See after for some detail.\n\nOther sources quoted the Prague Student Corps wore similar dress plus a bicorn with a red-tipped white feather. The Prague city Landwehr had long, singlebreasted brown coats with green collar, cuffs and piping; white breeches, black (white ?) gaiters and equipment, and a shako with brass badge and black and yellow pompon. [24]\n\nTwo Words upon Uniforms\n\nIn the Web and in the interesting site www.primaplana.cz has appeared a notable historical article of Karel Sáček and Karl Bag, which tries to make light on the type of military uniform worn by the Bohemian Landwehr in 1809. The article has, unfortunately, the defect to be written in Czech language, not comprehensible to all. I tried to make here a summary of what was written there.\n\nA man dressed in a knee-long coat and Corsican hat on his head is probably the first image that will strike you, speaking about the Landwehr, years 1808-1810. Right a man so dressed was immortalized by painter Johann Peter Krafft in 1813 in his famous “Farewell of the Territorial” (in Czech: zeměbrance from země = Land and branec = recruit) painting, which became a symbol of the modern Austrian patriotism (the image is not provided for copyright rights). The subject, in effects, is wearing the same uniform as the Landwehr men on the front page of another quoted publication on the matter: the book “Landwehr Anno Neun”.\n\nHowever these uniforms applied to the Landwehr battalions formed in Vienna, Lower Austria and other neighborhoods. Their numerous options are set as in the synthesis of the book “Das Heer unter dem Doppeladler”, where, in addition, authors even wrote a warning label: “In fact, Landwehr uniforms were very dissimilar in different regions.\" [25]\n\nHow, then, looked the Landwehr from the Czech lands? The absence of detailed description of their uniforms (or yet to be discovered), forces to refer briefly to the regulation in force in Lower and Upper Austria,\n\n“The service coat must be such that a man could wear it in winter over the other clothes in the summer only over a shirt. It should have two pockets. The Landwehr long coat extends up to the knees, so that the trousers colour may not be uniform. The man receives his own rounded hat (Runden-Hut), in which front is attached a brass plaque, where one can read to the provincial and district number of the battalion. The Landwehr training team should walk with their own clothes as jackets, but together homogeneous for weaponry. This weaponry belongs to a little bag (Sack) for 36 rounds, which is worn on a black lacquered wide strap, two and a quarter inches over the right shoulder strap of the bayonet, as for the infantry. Men wear the bags over the right shoulder.\n\nThe men were armed by the Central Government with rifles and bayonets, which had weapons for every local security group, watched in a safe place. For the officer corps, however, and also for men was issued a special “Landwehr uniform”, adapted to the national costumes of each Crown’s region, usually not homogeneously prescribed. This uniform consisted, by the main part, of a long overcoat, in different colours, with a single series of white buttons, with a rigid hat having a brim bent up on one side and a brass plate on which were embossed the letters LW (Land Wehr), then region and number of the battalion.\n\nEach man was to be provided with one cartridge bag for 36-40 rounds, sack for bread and the suspension strap (belt) for a bayonet. Equipment and military clothing were provided by the Regional Administration.”\n\nIn relation to the Moravia-Silesia Landwehr battalions, however, this booklet provided only:\n\n“They were wearing a gray coat with blue facings.” [26]\n\nOtakar Frankenberger, with reference to primary sources collected in Prague, limited himself to stating that “Landwehr of Czech lands wore a gray coat, blue epaulettes, trilby hat with rosette-shaped pins and brush.” At the same time he added that: “There was a proposal under which each Region should have a different colour of the facings. The buttons should be for Czech (white) and for Moravian Landwehr (yellow)”. [27]\n\nAccording to other sources, Moravia decided that: “the uniform had to be a gray coat with red facings and a round hat with a brass plate ... at least every battalion had to have the same wearing.” [28]\n\nAccording to Dave Hollins’ Czech, Moravian and Silesian simulated uniforms of Landwehr battalions and Lower Austrian peasant hats, their facings was to be officially light blue, but many units used to copy the same colour as the ordinary infantry regiment linked to the District (so the Saaz Landwehr battalion loaded Orange “County” facings as did the Erbach Infantry Regiment No. 42). In Moravia, probably, they wore more Landwehr black “peasant hats”, because of the large presence of farmers. [29]\n\nExcerpts for Landwehr equipments were recorded in eastern Bohemia: “The train group attended the exercises in their own clothes, but each one should have had a strange high hat with brass letters and badges and the same cartridge sacks, all were available in Prague: a badge for 21 kr., an hat for 2 zl. 24 kr.” [30]\n\nAnother, although very bizarre, source describing the equipment is a Landwehr mocking song, that was sang by regular army soldiers of Frelich Infantry Regiment No. 28:\n\n“Lantveři (Landwehr) with linen trousers, back too much “tanestry” / rifles are old, “pagnety” red, on their heads pig wool hats. /Those are the words, by honour, run Brethren, Jesus Maria!” [31]\n\nSo far written sources. More attention must be paid to iconographic sources. Among them it occupies a privileged position a series of 13 Landwehr images of the Imperial Countries, which Josef Eder issued at Vienna in 1810. [32]\n\nThree of those images relate to the Bohemian lands. As for the “Czech Landwehr of the Royal Capital city of Prague” it must be told that this may not be the right guide for recreating the appearance and the idea of Landwehr uniforms in the Czech lands. The intention was to distinguish that units as much as possible, as in the case of the Student Volunteer battalion, which had to be different from the Archduke Charles Legion of 1800 – The red epaulet on the officer's right shoulder is probably a symbolic reference for continuing that tradition.\n\nIn Moravian and Silesian Duchy Landwehr, the gold metal letters in the hats look different than the above-illustrated Prague Landwehr - in this case, it can be also clearly recognized the letter \"M\" referring probably to the Moravian territory.\n\nThey have classical Landwehr coats and equipment. However the hat is decorated with letters LW. Why? Rigid hats, round hats, etc ... these features suggest only that the so-called typical Corsican hat did not predominate on Bohemian territory. This is confirmed by other contemporary illustrations of Czech Landwehr, camped, on June 23, 1809 at Dresden. [33] This iconographic source derived from a collection published by Peter Hofschrörer and Dave Hollins and shows seven captured soldiers with the cylinder-shaped hat having bents reversed on both sides.\n\nThe Bohemian hat of the “Dresden camp” is similar to that immortalized by Eder in 1810 for Moravians. This is the same type, that was widespread among Czech Archduke Charles Legion volunteers already since 1800. [34] The cylindrical hat with a bent brim, then, was probably the most typical element for the Czech Landwehr in 1809 and distinguished them from other countries. This just let's add that officers who were assigned to the Landwehr from the army, have the right to retain their original former uniform.\n\nGeneral Count Kinsky, in whose brigade were included three Landwehr battalions of the Loket region and two from Saaz and Rakovnik, indicated the actual state of the Landwehr’s equipment in a report to the FML Sommariva (early May 1809): “The bad state of uniforms and lack of shoes is the cause of many diseases among the units. The 2nd Königgrätz Battalion had to be again completely withdrawn, due to bad arming, from the South Bohemian border and replaced by the 4th Chrudim battalion.” [35]\n\nThis may suggest that the Landwehr, like in a common volunteer battalion, should have to be equipped with different uniforms, based on the regular infantry-style. Maybe this manifestation was captured by Josef Eder and was confirmed by several other sources.\n\nThe third image “Moravian Landwehr (?) A volunteer corps” illustrated a “Moravian Landwehr” with a typical Jäger clothing - here the author obviously made a mistake in the description. In 1809 in Moravia no volunteer Jäger formation emerged, which could be incorporated into the Feldjäger corps; those uniforms are likely to be perhaps accredited to the Prague volunteers (Watterich) battalion, or to the Feldjäger or to the the Lobkovitz Kinsky formation.\n\nIn order to end this short trip among the Czech Landwehr uniforms ther is a rather “hot and picquant” note related to the Legion troops of Archduke Charles, left by FML Klenau in his report dated March 24, 1809:\n\n“The Landwehr men serving in the legion, as well as the new recruited ones, do not wear underwear (kleinen Montur) under the coat. Therefore I consider it necessary to allocate shirts and underwear (Gati) to the men, in order, at least, to partially hide their nudities. This deficiency results from poverty and from the fact that the majority, when Legion was rallied, took with him only one shirt, which is by now completely worn”. [36]\n\nJoking with Landwehr in 1809 [37]\n\nWar preparations continued in Prague so zealously that, on October 31, 1808, Czech Lords resolved to give the State Council cash of 1.509.000 zl. for the newly established army, the Landwehr, and, in addition, to provide a further 4.000.000 zl. contribution to be spending by the war fund.\n\nOver the winter, certain of the pending war, all became tense and eager to setting up the Land’s defense, Landwehr, which were quickly dressed in uniform and trained to the field service of war.\n\nThe hurry and the rush of training territorials inspired confidence in the regular troops, by their supposed military superiority, and they became jealous, so they laughted at their old land-soldiers upon the meaning of the letters LW (which meant Land Wehr), saying the letters meant “Lauf weg !“, in German “Run away !” and questioned about their fitness and the various antics uttered by this new army. Also even there were composed skittish songs about Territorials. So sang soldiers of the regiment Vogelsang in Prague:\n\n“Not far from Vienna in a village small and fine - Flagbearer Landwehry at the waist carrying a swine .....”\n\nAnd perhaps they would have even more teased Territorials, when an abrupt spring called to arms people from Prague up to the field, against Napoleon. Therefore, on May 1st, 1809, after the Territorials, volunteers and students got the 1800 flags and went from Prague to the Klattau region, occupying the Bohemian border. That year the month of May was, in Bohemia, same as “Month of War”, so that even during the feast of St.John Nepomucene in Prague, instead of wandering devout pilgrims, walked brilliant fellows singing war songs and ballads against the detested Napoleon, pro the celebrated Archduke Charles and laughing at the Territorials ... For the security and the safety of Prague had been discarded the palisades and the city was fortified with trenches with embankments around, where several thousand people worked for a day pay of 30 kr.\n\nTHE LANDWEHR INFANTRY\n\nOrdered by Recruitment District\n\nBohemia commanders Archduke Ferdinand and BurgCount FZM Wallis\n\n1\n\nBerauner Kreis\n\n(2 Bn.)\n\n10\n\nKöniggrätzer Kreis\n\n(5 Bn.)\n\n2\n\nBidzower Kreis\n\n(4 Bn.)\n\n11\n\nLeitmeritzer Kreis\n\n(5 Bn.)\n\n3\n\nBudweiser Kreis\n\n(3 Bn.)\n\n12\n\nPilsener Kreis\n\n(3 Bn.)\n\n4\n\nBunzlauer Kreis\n\n(6 Bn.)\n\n13\n\nPrachiner Kreis\n\n(4 Bn.)\n\n5\n\nCaslauer Kreis\n\n(3 Bn.)\n\n14\n\nCity of Prague\n\n(2 Bn.)\n\n6\n\nChrudimer Kreis\n\n(4 Bn.)\n\n15\n\nRakonitzer Kreis\n\n(2 Bn.)\n\n7\n\nElbogener Kreis\n\n(3 Bn.)\n\n16\n\nSaazer Kreis\n\n(2 Bn.)\n\n8\n\nKaurimer Kreis\n\n(2 Bn.)\n\n17\n\nTaborer Kreis\n\n(2 Bn.)\n\n9\n\nKlattauer Kreis\n\n(3 Bn.)\n\nBERAUNER Kreis – Beraun\n\nThe 2 Bns. were in the Brig and Div.

The 1808 Landwehr Patent contained many exemptions, especially for students, skilled workers, merchants and townspeople, but they could always enroll as volunteers for the so-called “Freiwillige” units, sometimes augmented by the Landwehr itself and prepared to serve outside their districts. Volunteers signed up for the duration of the war. All officers and NCOs had to have military experience and so were retired or drafted regulars. The distinguishing uniform feature of all western volunteer battalions was the cuffs red.\n\nFREIWILLIGE or the true free-corps of Volunteers (Freikorps, often also Jäger Bns. or only Jäger named), set up in the empire by nobles (who called themselves also as proprietaires) or early nationalist (Schill) or a mixture of both (the Duke of Brunswick - Braunschweig, i.e.) and the Freiwilligenbattalione (FreiBns. in the contemporary literature).\n\nThe Archduke Charles Legion\n\nLegion Erzherzog Carl\n\nBöhmisches Freikorps\n\nwas also comprehensive of the Moravian Volunteers Battalion\n\nThe Legion Erzherzog Carl had this name since 1794. Units which gave origin to this Corps were:\n\nOn 1792 the Limburg Volunteers (Limburger Freiwillige) which was in Luxenbourg near Rochefort outposts, when they took prisoners the French general Lafayette together with other 2 generals, 2 colonels and 2 Adjutanten.\n\nOn 1794 was called Legion for the first time and took part to the combat at Verviers.\n\nOn 1795 (October 29) in the vanguard of the 1st Column, 2 companies of the Legion seized the entrenchment of Mainz.\n\nOn 1796 it distinguished itself during the clash of Aschaffenburg (September 6) under Hauptmann Johann de Meys.\n\nOn 1798 it was disbanded and changed into 2 Light infantry battalions (2nd and 14th).\n\nThe former uniform was completely dark-grey with crimson facings and white buttons. On November 1800 the Legion was raised again (with one Jäger Corps and 22 Militia battalions) but it never fought.\n\nOn 1801, after the Luneville Treaty it was again disbanded and raised in 1809.\n\nAbout the Students' Legion of 1800 ... the Dr. Mudroch Tale[38]\n\nIn a student pub, the beer hall at Michelská Ovocny market, young doctor in Law, Antonín Mudroch, remembered the students’ legion of 1800. He recalled the glorious period and younger companions told him to tell that, with enthusiasm and admiration, listening to what happened and how it was the matter.\n\n“We had our equipments!” Boasted Dr. Mudroch. “Brown suits with red Epaulettes on shoulders and six rows of lines on the chest, blue trousers, boots to the knees, black and white cock feathers and an alongside sabre!” “When the Archduke Charles came to Prague for the academic establishment of the Legion of students on November 9, 1800, he called on its members and promised various benefits, it was addressed with cheers and more praised when Archduke said that the Academic Legion will reach the rank of a battalion, not only that of a company.”\n\nD r. Mudroch searched in his cuir bag and lit his pipe emitting a massive cloud of smoke, before continuing:\n\n“Indeed, the idea that the voluntarily signing up students legion, from about one company it will become now four companies, an entire battalion of 638 men, prompted the Archduke welcomed! So instead of the students Corps company there was a student Corps battalion, which had its own special commander and each company had its own leader, lieutenants, feldwebel and corporals, selected from a field regiment here quartered. Legionnaires had no rank between them and, unlike other volunteers, have adorned Epaulettes of silver and red silk, porte-epée in leather with black and white silk laces. We got the uniform (Montur) from the clothing Commission at 4 gold pieces and 30 kr. And in order to avoid to go far away from school and to not neglect lectures, we were under exercise during weekdays, in the morning, from quarter to eleven to quarter to one, in the large refectory “Klementina”.\n\nSo far, the war reached a danger alarm of such size that it was decreed that the Supreme commander of the army against Napoleon, would have been the Archduke Charles himself, in the midst of December. Earlier than it happened, ignoring the Prague set up, three battalions of volunteers, the Count Černin battalion, the battalion of Count Desfours battalion and the Academic Corps marched in Parade. Wow ... that was on Saturday, December 13, at the Cattle Market, where half of Prague came together to the show. Our Archduke gave us his special attention as students and the day after he went to the army, at Vöcklabruck, to get the Generalissimus title. The commander of the Students Legion was Count Jan Vratislav. He also donated the state flag with, on one side the Czech lion and, on the other, the imperial emblem. Above the lion were the Latin words: “Legio Archiducis Caroli Bohema-Moravica-Silesiaca” and underneath “Pro Rege”. Above the eagle and the metal tip of the battalion it was engraved: ”Sieg oder Todt” (Victory or Death). The ribbons, which Countess Schliková gave the legion battalion were embroidered, “We defend Motherland, Let us stand firm, God and Carl with us!”\n\nAt this point Dr. Anton Mudroch grabbed his hair with the right hand, as his storytelling was inside his head, then continued to revive memories.\n\n“The Consecration ceremony of the Academic Legion battalion, with battalion flags and battalions Černín and Desfours, was held on the second Christmas holiday, on St. Stephen, at 10 hours in the morning, in the Týn Temple. The Archbishop of Prague, Prince Salm-Salm celebrated the pontifical Mass, with the sacred flags laying on a table before the main altar and all officers of the three battalions standing around them in two rows. After the Mass, the Archbishop consecrated banners and then they were brought to the large Old Town market place, where the battalions were in a large quarry. The next day, on 27 December, 10 hours in the morning, in the university square Klementina, the Academic Legion swore to serve our country as brave and honorable soldiers. And then we went against the enemy”.\n\nThe eyes of the young doctor filled with tears as he told:\n\n“No matter what happened on Sunday, 28 December morning, when we were gathered in the Klementina and quietly, after the Holy Mass, we marched through the Cattle Market street towards Vysehrad gate and into the field. ... “\n\nIn 1809 six battalions were raised in Bohemia and each consisted of four normal companies armed with the musket and two jäger companies. The First Battalion, raised from students of the Prague University, wore the bicorn hat with national cockade and red-over-white plume, the Jäger companies wearing the “Corsehut” with yellow-and-black pompon and the normal companies wearing the new 1806 Shako. Coats were tobacco brown with scarlet collar, cuffs and turnbacks and piping and decorated with scarlet braid on the breast. Breeches were sky-blue and worn with black leather knee boots. All belting was black leather and as for the line infantry or jägers. Officers wore the “Schiffhut” and coats of infantry officer pattern with facings and decoration as for the men. The officers of this Legion were permitted to wear the waist-sash.\n\nI Battalion or Wattrich Jäger Battalion\n\n(students of Prague; Prager Jäger or Böh­misches Jägerkorps; Watterich or Watrich Jäger) .

Although the central processing of English history should be approached very critically and with great caution, it was not the case of Hollins’ “Ospreys”. His knowledge, also under relative absence of appropriate references to sources, currently is specialized in military uniforms and it is well known the author is a reference guide for several military historians about life and culture of the Austrian Empire. Only in the case of attribution of facings with the same color as their territorially competent ordinary infantry regiments, just the lacking of the source can raise doubts that Hollins made a mistake in the description of the state of 1813.\n\n[30]Zástěra Karel, “Acts and attractions, cultural and other images from the Bohemian East.” Skutč, 1896, s. Works, 1896, p. 223. 223. Referring to the above provisions for the Austrian battalions is wrong to assume that Landwehr were not uniformed. They had only to issue uniform coats only during fire exercises.\n\n[31] Tanestry = tornistry, pagnety = bayonets. Řezníček, Vácslav.

Coincidentally, in the city historical museum of Leipzig there is an Austrian Landwehr hat of 1809 - the classic Corsican type.\n\nHollins – Younghusband, “Austrian Auxiliary Troops”, p. 39. It is very interesting also the similar representation of the Czech Landwehr of 1813, which comes from the Lipperheide Berlin gallery. Soldier has his “blanket” on head, which Hollins describes as “Corsican hat”.\n\n[34] Similar headgears between Bohemian Landwehr 1809 and Czech volunteers of 1800 became the cause of several mistakes. The first was committed by Gilbert Anger,”Illustrirte Geschichte der kk Armee”, II. Band, Vienna, 1887, p. 1772 - 1178, whenunder the image of a 1800 volunteer he placed the label “Czech Landwehr”, while the following text clearly shows that it was 1809 Landwehr. The same mistake repeated Haythornthwaite Philip - Fosten Bryan, “Austrian Army of the Napoleonic Wars (I): Infantry”, Osprey Publishing, Men-at-Arms, 1986, s. 31 which were apparently inspired by Anger.\n\n[35] Zehetbauer, „Landwehr gegen Napoleo"
