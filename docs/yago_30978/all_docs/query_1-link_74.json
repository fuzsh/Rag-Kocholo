Matthias’s successor, his cousin Ferdinand II, had been raised at his father Archduke Charles II’s Inner Austrian court at Graz, a bastion of both the Counter-Reformation and of Italian music and culture. It was with this line that the Baroque came to the Habsburg courts, with an influx of Italian musicians (including Giovanni Priuli, Giovanni Valentini, Antonio Bertali, Giovanni Felice Sances, and Antonio Draghi) and the cultivation of cutting-edge musical styles and genres. Helping to nourish the growth of Italian Baroque culture were the Italian brides of Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III, both named Eleonora Gonzaga. This Italian music was put to use as a political weapon in the Habsburgs’ fervent attempts to re-Catholicize their realms, even in the face of the Thirty Years’ War. Unlike the previous line of Austrian emperors, for whom it was customary to dismiss their predecessor’s musicians, this line saw a continuity of chapel membership across the Emperors’ reigns, from Ferdinand II to Ferdinand III to Leopold I.",
