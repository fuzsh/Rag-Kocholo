        "text": "In summary\n\nThis chapter provides an overview of China’s major antitrust developments in 2023, covering new legislation, enforcement, merger review, private actions and an outlook for 2024.\n\nDiscussion points\n\nMinisterial rules and administrative regulations\n\nDevelopments in conduct enforcement and merger review\n\nHighlighted private actions\n\nReferenced in this article\n\nProvisions of the State Council on the Thresholds for Notification of Concentration of Undertakings\n\nProvisions on Review of Concentration of Undertakings\n\nProvisions on Prohibiting Monopoly Agreements\n\nProvisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Dominant Market Positions\n\nProvisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Eliminate or Restrict Competition\n\nAnti-monopoly Compliance Guidance for Concentrations of Undertakings\n\nDraft Industry Association Guidelines\n\nDraft SEP Guidelines\n\nIntroduction\n\nFollowing the reform of the Anti-Monopoly Law of China (AML), the core ministerial rules complementing the Amendments to the AML (the Amended AML) were formally adopted by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), covering merger control, monopoly agreements, abuse of dominance and abuse of intellectual property rights. Aside from the expected substantive changes envisaged in the consultation drafts, the market-share-based safe harbour rule for vertical agreement is not adopted in the new rules, which continue to leave considerable uncertainties for companies with insignificant market shares in self-assessing their distribution practices.\n\nOn the merger control front, the pilot programme delegating partial merger review mandate to local Administration for Market Regulation (AMRs) has significantly alleviate SAMR’s burden in reviewing simple cases. Around 50 per cent of simplified cases in 2023 were first reviewed by local AMRs. On the other hand, the gun-jumping enforcement in 2023 is unprecedently inactive: no gun-jumping penalty decision was published throughout the year. Notably, SAMR imposed remedies on a below-thresholds transaction and a transaction with no horizontal, vertical or neighbouring relationship. The most significant change to the merger regime took place on 26 January 2024 when China’s State Council unveiled the amendments to the Provisions of the State Council on the Thresholds for Notification of Concentration of Undertakings (Amended Thresholds for Notification). The Amended Thresholds for Notification increased the current turnover thresholds for the first time since the adoption of the AML, reflecting SAMR’s long-standing plan to focus on transactions that are more likely to have effects on the Chinese market.\n\nSAMR’s conduct enforcement in 2023 continue to concentrate on sectors that concern national strategies and people’s living, with a particular focus on the pharmaceutical sector. The two SAMR-investigated violations concern anticompetitive behaviours in pharmaceutical sector, including the supply of pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Moreover, the only RPM case, which was investigated by a local Administration of Market Regulation (AMR), also concerns distribution of medicines. A no-poach agreement was investigated by SAMR for the first time this year. The year 2023 also witnessed several landmark cases handed down by the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) and lower courts, including certain high-profile follow-on private actions.\n\nAt the end of the article we also set out our observation for the prospective antitrust developments in China in 2024.\n\nLegislations\n\nIn 2023, SAMR formally adopted the core ministerial rules on merger control, monopoly agreements, abuse of dominance and abuse of intellectual property rights. These rules are the primary legal resources complementing the Amended AML and will shape the antitrust enforcement in the new era in the foreseeable future. SAMR is also active in formulating guidelines on various issues, including a guideline on merger control for enterprises, a draft conduct guideline for industry associations, and a draft guideline on SEP-related antitrust issues.\n\nNotably, on 26 January 2024, China’s State Council unveiled the Amended Thresholds for Notification, taking effect on the same day. The Amended Thresholds for Notification increased the current turnover thresholds for the first time since the adoption of the AML, reflecting SAMR’s long-standing plan to focus on transactions that are more likely to have effects on the Chinese market.\n\nMore substantive details regarding the legislative developments are provided below.\n\nAmended thresholds for notification\n\nUnder the Amended Thresholds for Notification, the turnover thresholds for mandatory filings in China are significantly increased. Consistent with the consultation draft released on 27 June 2022, the combined turnover and individual turnover thresholds are both increased. A mandatory filing would now be triggered if:\n\nthe combined worldwide turnover of all undertakings exceeds 12 billion yuan, or the combined China turnover of all undertakings exceeds 4 billion yuan in the preceding financial year; and\n\nthe individual China turnover of at least two undertakings exceeds 800 million yuan in the preceding financial year.\n\nIt is worth noting that the alternative market value threshold to catch ‘killer acquisitions’ in the earlier consultation draft is not adopted. The earlier consultation draft includes an alternative market value thresholds to catch ‘killer acquisitions’, that is, if the primary turnover test above is not met, a mandatory filing will also be triggered if: one party has more than 100 billion yuan turnover in China in the previous financial year; and the other party (merging party or target) has (1) market value or valuation of 800 million yuan or more, and (2) more than a third of its worldwide turnover generated from China in the previous financial year. This alternative threshold is not introduced by the Amended Thresholds for Notification, reportedly due to the difficulties to establish a unified and consistent market value calculation methodology. That said, the AML emphasised (and the Amended Thresholds for Notification reiterated) that if there is evidence proving that a transaction has or may have the effect of excluding or restricting competition, the anti-monopoly enforcement authority may require the parties to notify such transaction even if the filing thresholds are not met. Therefore, ‘killer acquisitions’ may still be subject to scrutiny.\n\nThe Amended Thresholds for Notification is silent on its retroactive effects. As the Amended Thresholds for Notification took effect on 26 January 2024, for transactions signed after 26 January 2024, the Amended Thresholds for Notification will apply. For transactions signed before 26 January 2024 but are not implemented or closed yet, there have not been formal guidelines on the applicability of the Amended Thresholds for Notification. According to the Interim Provisions on Administrative Authorisation by Administration for Market Regulation (effective from 1 May 2022 and binds SAMR), in the circumstances that the authorities accept an application for administrative authorisation but have not issued a decision, the authorities shall terminate the proceeding of administrative authorisation if the administrative authorisation is no longer required due to change of law. In line with this principle, for transactions falling below the new thresholds but are signed and filed with SAMR before 26 January 2024, theoretically speaking SAMR should terminate the merger review process. It derives that transactions signed before 26 January 2024 but not filed to SAMR should also not be notifiable if they fall below the new thresholds. However, SAMR has wide discretion on interpreting the applicability of the Amended Thresholds for Notification. It remains to be seen how SAMR would perceive the retroactive effects of the Amended Thresholds for Notification.\n\nImplementing provisions for the Amended AML\n\nOn 24 March 2023, the SAMR published the final version of four sets of crucial antitrust provisions, which are in place to ensure smooth implementation of the Amended AML, which was adopted on 24 June 2022 and came into force on 1 August 2022. The four sets of provisions address, respectively, merger control, anticompetitive agreements, abuse of dominance and abuse of administrative dominance. The four provisions became effective from 15 April 2023. On 29 June 2023, SAMR published the final version of Provisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Eliminate or Restrict Competition, which became effective from 1 August 2023.\n\nHighlights of the implementing provisions are set forth below.\n\nThe Provisions on Review of Concentration of Undertakings\n\nProvisions on Review of Concentration of Undertakings addresses key topics including control analysis, turnover calculation, factors for determining the ‘implementation’ of the transaction (ie, gun-jumping), the ‘stop-the-clock’ mechanism and review of below-threshold transactions are further clarified.\n\nThe Provisions on Prohibiting Monopoly Agreements\n\nUnder the Provisions on Prohibiting Monopoly Agreements, the 15 per cent market share threshold, which was proposed in the Consultation Draft for the safe harbour rule is disappointingly dropped; more clarification is provided regarding hub-and-spoke agreements, the definition of competitors, and the scope of the leniency system’s application and case establishment criteria in investigations; and soft measures to promote antitrust compliance are newly introduced.\n\nThe Provisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Dominant Market Positions\n\nUnder Provisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Dominant Market Positions, the digital economy’s rising impact is reflected, and more detailed guidance is provided for the assessment of specific abusive conduct and the identification of collective dominance.\n\nThe Provisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Eliminate or Restrict Competition\n\nProvisions on Prohibiting Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Eliminate or Restrict Competition, on the one hand, grant clarity for IP-related antitrust issues and, on the other hand, provide official guidance for companies to comply with the Amended AML.\n\nMore detailed guidance is provided for the assessment of the market dominance of an IP rights holder. Factors to consider include the possibility and cost of transaction counterparties switching to alternative technologies or products, the dependency of downstream market players on IP-related goods, the counterparty’s countervailing ability vis-à-vis IP rights holders, etc.\n\nExcessive pricing relating to IP rights is expressly caught. In identifying excessive pricing, the amount of R&D cost and cost recovery period, royalty calculation method and licensing conditions, historical royalty or other comparable rates, commitments made by the IP rights holder concerning the licensing of the concerned IP rights, etc, may be assessed.\n\nOn anticompetitive agreements, liabilities of coordinators and facilitators exercising IP rights are newly introduced, and safe harbour rules are amended to align with the Anti-Monopoly Guideline on Intellectual Property Rights.\n\nOn merger control, IP-related factors and the specific circumstances of remedies are summarised and reflected, including, but not limited to: divesting the relevant IP rights or the IP-related business; maintaining the independent operation of the IP-related business; and licensing IP rights on reasonable terms.\n\nAnticompetitive conduct by use of patent pools (where two or more undertakings jointly license their respective patents to pooling members or third parties) is explicitly prohibited, such as the exchange of sensitive information between members of patent pools, abuse of dominance through excessive pricing or imposing unreasonable restrictions or conditions on pooling members or patent licensees.\n\nAnticompetitive conduct related to standard essential patents (SEPs) is explicitly prohibited, such as the implementation of monopoly agreements during formulating and implementing standards, or abuse of dominance in the licensing of SEPs. In particular, an IP rights holder shall not abuse its dominance during the SEP licensing process by violating fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and seeking judicial remedies prohibiting the use of related IP rights without first bargaining in good faith, to force licensees to accept unfairly high prices or other unreasonable trading conditions.\n\nAnti-monopoly compliance guidance for concentrations of undertakings\n\nFollowing the release of the consultation draft of the compliance guidance for merger control in June 2023, SAMR published the final guidance on 11 September 2023, aiming to encourage companies to build up their internal merger control compliance systems.\n\nAnti-monopoly Compliance Guidance for Concentrations of Undertakings covers a wide range of key issues relating to the full cycle of merger control with detailed clarification, including control analysis, notifiability assessment, gun-jumping, etc. The compliance guidance encourages undertakings to establish a tailor-made merger control compliance system based on their business scale, management mode, frequency of concentration, existing compliance system, etc.\n\nDraft Compliance Guidelines\n\nSAMR published two draft compliance guidelines/guidance for public consultation.\n\nDraft Industry Association Guidelines\n\nOn 15 May 2023, SAMR launched a consultation on a draft of the Anti-monopoly Guidelines for Industry Associations (Draft Industry Association Guidelines) to warn industry associations against coordinating or facilitating undertakings to reach and implement anticompetitive agreements. Its public consultation period ended on 15 June 2023. The Draft Industry Association Guidelines provide that industry associations are prohibited from engaging in high-risk behaviour, including:\n\nfacilitating sensitive information exchange;\n\npublishing indicative prices, such as guidance prices, benchmark prices, recommended prices, forecast prices, etc; and\n\npublishing inaccurate or exaggerated market information, such as cost trends, and supply and demand conditions. Moreover, the Draft Industry Association Guidelines set out recommended compliance measures for industry associations, and reiterate legal liabilities for engaging in anticompetitive behaviour, corresponding to the Amended AML.\n\nDraft SEP Guidelines\n\nOn 30 June 2023, SAMR launched a consultation on a draft of the Anti-monopoly Guidelines for the Standard Essential Patent (SEP) Field (the Draft SEP Guidelines), which offer practical notes in the case of SEP-related anticompetitive conduct and merger review. Its public consultation period will end on 29 July 2023. The Draft SEP Guidelines, among others, set out the specific circumstances and factors to be considered when determining illegal conduct achieved through the formulation and implementation of standards, such as monopoly agreements, licensing SEPs at unfairly high prices, refusal to license SEPs, tie-in sales related to SEPs, imposing unfair terms, differential treatment, abuse of remedies, etc.\n\nConduct enforcement\n\nEnforcement in 2023 continue to concentrate on sectors that concern national strategies and people’s living, with a particular focus on the pharmaceutical sector. The two SAMR-investigated violations concern anticompetitive behaviours in pharmaceutical sector, including the supply of APIs. Moreover, the only RPM case, which was investigated by a local AMR, also concerns distribution of medicines. Notably, SAMR also regulated no-poach agreement for the first time this year, though the case did not end with a penalty decision.\n\nCartels\n\nCartel enforcement continue to be active in 2023. There were 11 infringement decisions on cartels published in China in 2023. The challenged types of cartels include price-fixing, market division, output limit and joint boycott. Notably, three industrial associations were held liable for organising cartel, marking an increased scrutiny on the conduct of industrial association. See Table 1 below for a list of these cases.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that SAMR also regulates no-poach agreement for the first time. On 31 July 2023, SAMR summoned four hog breeders, namely Muyuan Food Co, Ltd, Wens Foodstuff Group Co, Ltd, Twin Group Co, Ltd, and CP Group Co, Ltd, that were found to have initiated and signed a no-poach agreement, advocating non-poaching and non-solicitation during an industrial forum on 20 June 2023. SAMR pointed out that this agreement goes against the spirit of the AML and ordered the four companies to rectify their actions and ensure compliance with antitrust rules. After the meeting with SAMR, the four companies issued a joint statement on the same day, stating that they would implement corrective measures and revoke the problematic no-poach agreement. While SAMR did not refer to the specific provisions in the AML that were violated or issue a penalty decision, SAMR’s move marks the first time the Chinese antitrust regulator has expressed concerns about competition issues in the labour market. In the same press release, SAMR also announced its determination to closely monitor the competition landscape in the country’s labour market. This finally echoes global antitrust regulators’ increasing clampdown of no-poaching arrangements among competing firms.\n\nRPM\n\nRPM remains the focus of antitrust enforcement against vertical restraint. Beijing AMR fined Zizhu Pharmaceutical for fixing its primary and secondary distributors’ resale prices of the oral emergency contraceptive pill products. In addition, Zizhu Pharmaceutical was found to have implemented its price-fixing practices through price adjustment letters, notices, engaging a third-party supervisor coupled with punishment mechanism.\n\nAbuse of dominance\n\nOn 28 May 2023, SAMR published a decision whereby Grand Pharmaceutical and Huihai Pharmaceutical were penalised for abuse of dominance and cartel behaviour. The relevant product markets are the markets for norepinephrine APIs and epinephrine APIs, where the parties are the only suppliers in China. The parties implemented a non-compete arrangement, under which Huihai Pharmaceutical agreed to withdraw from selling the two APIs and, in return, obtained compensation from Grand Pharmaceutical. Such conduct constituted anticompetitive output restriction and eliminated competition in the upstream market, harming the interests of both downstream pharmaceutical companies and, eventually, end consumers. In addition, Grand Pharmaceutical was also found to have abused its dominant market position by imposing unreasonable trading conditions, specifically through (1) forcing downstream pharmaceutical companies to sell norepinephrine injections and epinephrine injections (the downstream products of the two APIs) to itself at low prices, coupled with threats of delayed supply; (2) requesting rebates from downstream companies; and (3) imposing restrictions regarding downstream players’ sales territories and resale prices.\n\nAll the residual penalty decisions on abuse of dominance in 2023 were issued by SAMR’s local counterparts, including predominantly unreasonable trading conditions affecting local utilities and excessive pricing in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nMerger review\n\nAlthough the number of cleared cases increased from last year, with around 786 approvals (including four conditional approvals), SAMR maintain the review efficiency with the strong support of local AMRs under the pilot delegation program. Around 50 per cent of simplified cases were reported reviewed by local AMRs in 2023. 2023 also marks the first conditional clearance of a below-threshold transaction. On the other hand, the gun-jumping enforcement in 2023 is unprecedently inactive: no gun-jumping penalty decision was published throughout the year.\n\nWith the new merger filing thresholds came into force on 26 January 2024, SAMR expect the total number of filings would be reduced by around 30 per cent, enabling SAMR and local AMRs to concentrate more resources on the large deals. The lift of merger filing thresholds also signals the government’s resolution to reduce the overall transaction costs of enterprises and boost market confidence.\n\nConditional clearance\n\nThe conditional clearance cases in 2023 were:\n\nWanhua Chemical/Yantai Juli;\n\nMaxLinear/Silicon Motion;\n\nSimcere/Tobishi; and\n\nBroadcom/VMware.\n\nThe conditional clearance of Simcere/Tobishi marks SAMR’s first attempt to impose conditions on below-threshold transactions that have or may have anticompetitive effects. The voluntary submission may have been driven by SAMR’s increased antitrust scrutiny on Simcere and the parties’ growing antitrust awareness. Competition concerns identified by SAMR mainly lie in that Simcere is the only supplier of the upstream Batroxobin API and Tobishi is the only supplier of the downstream Batroxobin injection. SAMR was concerned that the transaction could disincentivise Simcere from its planned entrance of the downstream injection market, and incentivise Simcere to engage in input foreclosure, in particular as Simcere was penalised by SAMR in 2021 due to its refusal to deal with Tobishi on the Batroxobin API from 2019 to 2020. To address these competition concerns, SAMR imposed six-year hybrid conditions including termination of exclusive supply agreement, divestment and maintenance of adequate supply.\n\nThe conditional clearance of MaxLinear/Silicon Motion continue to show that stable supply to China market is one of the core objectives that SAMR would like to achieve in its merger review practice. While no horizontal, vertical, or neighbouring relationship was identified between the parties, SAMR raised concerns over the target’s high market share in the NAND flash controller chip market and downstream customers’ significant dependence on the target. SAMR imposed a number of remedies essentially requesting the parties to ensure the stable supply of NAND flash controller chips to Chinese customers. Dramatically, a few hours following SAMR’s decision, MaxLinear issued a merger termination notice, claiming that Silicon Motion had experienced a material adverse effect and multiple additional contractual failures.\n\nMaxLinear/Silicon Motion is not the only high-profile semiconductor case submitted to SAMR and abandoned. On 16 August 2023, Intel abandoned its acquisition of Tower Semiconductor due to SAMR’s delay in clearance. While Intel’s press release did not explicitly name the regulator involved, the delay in SAMR’s clearance proved to be a significant hurdle for the deal, ultimately leading to the abandonment. SAMR reportedly raised certain conditions to address industrial issues in the final round of remedy negotiations that the parties failed to meet. Similar to the NXP/Qualcomm deal, this transaction also went through a more than 18-month SAMR review. This example also to some extent reflects ramifications of the ‘Chip War’.\n\nPilot programme for merger review delegation\n\nOn 20 July 2023, SAMR released a summary assessment of the pilot program on the delegation of merger control review. Under the pilot programme, which was put into practice on 1 August 2022, five local AMRs in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Chongqing and Shaanxi have been entrusted to review certain simplified-procedure cases with local nexus, with a view to lessening the burden of review at central level. According to the release, since 1 August 2022, 287 cases have been delegated to local AMRs for review, accounting for 40.7 per cent of the simple cases reviewed over that period. Among the delegated cases, pre-notification stage took 23.8 days on average and clearance took an average of additional 18.5 days. Beijing AMR and Shanghai AMR stood out with the shortest review timeline (ie, 11 days for formal phase 1 review and 16 days also including pre-notification). As at the end of 2023, around 50 per cent of approved simplified cases were reviewed by local AMRs.\n\nLitigations\n\nIn 2023, China saw more landmark private litigations, featuring JD.com’s victory in its follow-on suit against Alibaba and five classic antitrust litigation cases published by SPC.\n\nBeijing High Court awards JD.com 1 billion yuan in its antitrust lawsuit against Alibaba\n\nOn 29 December 2023, JD.com, the Chinese online shopping platform, announced that it had been awarded compensation of 1 billion yuan by the Beijing High People’s Court (the Beijing High Court) in the first-instance decision of its abuse of dominance claim against three Alibaba-affiliated defendants (Alibaba). In its decision, the Beijing High Court concluded that Alibaba had abused its dominant market position by implementing the ‘choosing one from two’ policy (ie, preventing brand merchants on the Alibaba platform from dealing with competing platforms including JD.com or participating in JD.com’s promotional activities), thereby causing serious damage to JD.com. The legal battle originated in 2015 when JD.com first complained about Alibaba’s behaviour to SAMR’s predecessor and was brought to the Beijing High Court in 2017, followed by years of jurisdictional disputes until the Supreme People’s Court confirmed the Beijing High Court’s jurisdiction. This judgment is in line with SAMR’s 2021 decision, which rendered a record penalty against Alibaba where the company received a fine of 18.228 billion yuan (US$2.558 billion) for its ‘choosing one from two’ conduct.\n\nChina Supreme Court announces five classic antitrust litigation cases.\n\nOn 14 September 2023, SPC published five classic antitrust cases together with five classic anti-unfair competition cases for the year 2023, shedding useful light on how to interpret and apply the AML in contentious cases. Among the five cases, three concern abusive behaviour, and the other two each concern horizontal and vertical agreements, covering sectors like pharmaceuticals, funeral services, automobile distribution, construction materials, etc. There are two notable examples:\n\nFirst successful follow-on suit: in Miao Chong (an individual) v SAIC-GM, the SPC overturned the lower court’s dismissal of an individual’s follow-on suit against SAIC-GM and one of its dealers as a result of their resale price maintenance (RPM) agreement. The SPC held that plaintiffs generally do not bear the burden of proof in an antitrust infringement if such an infringement was affirmed in an effective and final administrative penalty decision. The SPC further laid out that parties to an RPM agreement shall be deemed as joint tortfeasors in private actions, and the amount of the damages should be determined based on the differences between the competitive price and the non-competitive minimum resale price stipulated by the relevant RPM agreement.\n\nAbuse of dominance in the API sector: in Hefei Industrial Pharmaceutical Institute v. Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group, the SPC confirmed the necessity to examine the indirect competitive constraints from the downstream market on an ‘intermediate input’ (eg, API) when evaluating the market power of the API producer. In addition, the case involves the SPC’s effective use of the economic tool in analysing excessive pricing and its careful balance of foreclosure effects of exclusive dealing practice and legitimate exercise of intellectual property rights.\n\nOutlook for 2024\n\nYear 2024 will become a watershed for merger review as the merger filing thresholds are formally amended. While the reform of accompanying ministerial rules of the Amended AML has achieved a momentum in 2023, year 2024 may unveil more about how conduct enforcement would be reshaped by the Amended AML as most of the penalty decision published by SAMR are based on previous AML due to the time of violations. We also expect that there will be more critical development in Chinese antitrust litigations with increasingly more successful antitrust claims in the years to come.\n\nEndnotes"
