Under the terms of the agreement, Avilex Pharma will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and will also be eligible for payments upon achievement of certain development and sales milestones, with all components amounting to a total of over USD 175 million (DKK 1.15 billion). In addition, Avilex Pharma will receive royalties on sales. Further financial details were not disclosed.\n\n“We are extremely pleased to be entering into this partnership with Simcere as they are one of China’s leading pharmaceutical companies, and have established exceptional capabilities in developing and launching effective therapies for AIS.
