TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nOver on CAPS, fully 234 of the 240 members who have rated Simcere -- some 97.5% -- believe the stock will outperform the S&P 500 going forward. These bulls include oxdeming and All-Star mrindependent, who is ranked in the top 2% of our community.\n\nTwo weeks ago, oxdeming tapped Simcere as a Far East way to get into drugs:\n\n[L]ow valuation; great beneficiary of health reform in China; government strong support; cost-effectiveness in rolling out innovative medicine; leading performer in Chinese pharm sector.\n\nIn a pitch from two days ago, mrindependent elaborates:\n\nSimcere Pharmaceutical is a rapidly growing generic pharmaceuticals company located in China. The company has tripled its revenues in the last 5 years and seems poised for future growth. Price has dropped recently due to combination of a China stock market pullback and a recent earnings miss. As a result, this extremely attractive company is available for just 1.44 times book value and 15 times estimated 2009 earnings. The balance sheet is sold with approximately $0.70 per share in net cash."
