        "text": "Nanjing, China /PRNewswire/ - On November 17, 2021, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Limited (2096.HK) announced that the company has reached collaboration agreement with the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), to develop novel antiviral drugs for COVID-19. During preclinical studies, the compound candidates for these drugs have been shown to have strong inhibitory effects on a variety of SARS-CoV-2 strains, including the Delta variant, indicating their potential of becoming a new generation of oral drugs to treat the disease.\n\nUnder the arrangement, Simcere will obtain the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the novel antiviral drug SIM0417 globally. Mutually striving to further contribute to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, both parties committed to working together to promote the clinical research and marketing process of the candidate drugs.\n\nSIM0417 is a small-molecule antiviral agent that targets the 3C-like protease, a key enzyme in the replication and life cycle of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Preclinical animal models have demonstrated good antiviral activity and the safety of SIM0417. Due to the 3CL protease's highly conserved nature, SIM0417 has a strong inhibitory effect on a variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the highly infectious Delta variant.\n\nMr. Ren Jinsheng, Chairman and CEO of Simcere commented, \"R&D collaboration is one of our 'dual-track'-based R&D strategies. SIMM's powerful platforms and technologies for drug development have produced several novel drug candidates for COVID-19 during the pandemic. Simcere is committed to providing today's patients with the medicines of the future. We hope this collaboration will help accelerate the transformation of research results coming from the lab into clinical studies. We are very excited to work with CAS to develop this new generation of antiviral drugs and help further contribute China's strength to fight against COVID-19.\"\n\nAbout Simcere Pharmaceutical Group\n\nSimcere Pharmaceutical Group limited (2096.HK) is rapidly transitioning to an innovation and R&D-driven pharmaceutical company, with the mission of \"providing today's patients with the medicines of the future.\" With an established a national key laboratory of translational medicine and innovative pharmaceuticals, Simcere focuses on the three main therapeutic areas of oncology, central nervous system diseases and autoimmune diseases.
