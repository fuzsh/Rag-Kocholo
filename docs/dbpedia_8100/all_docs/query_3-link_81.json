        "text": "There's no foolproof way to know the future for Simcere Pharmaceutical Group. (NYSE: SCR) or any other company. However, certain clues may help you see potential stumbles before they happen -- and before your stock craters as a result.\n\nA cloudy crystal ball\n\nIn this series, we use accounts receivable and days sales outstanding to judge a company's current health and future prospects. It's an important step in separating the pretenders from the market's best stocks. Alone, AR -- the amount of money owed the company -- and DSO -- the number of days' worth of sales owed to the company -- don't tell you much. However, by considering the trends in AR and DSO, you can sometimes get a window onto the future.\n\nSometimes, problems with AR or DSO simply indicate a change in the business (like an acquisition), or lax collections. However, AR that grows more quickly than revenue, or ballooning DSO, can, at times, suggest a desperate company that's trying to boost sales by giving its customers overly generous payment terms. Alternately, it can indicate that the company sprinted to book a load of sales at the end of the quarter, like used-car dealers on the 29th of the month. (Sometimes, companies do both.)\n\nWhy might an upstanding firm like Simcere Pharmaceutical Group. do this? For the same reason any other company might: to make the numbers. Investors don't like revenue shortfalls, and employees don't like reporting them to their superiors.\n\nIs Simcere Pharmaceutical Group. sending any potential warning signs? Take a look at the chart below, which plots revenue growth against AR growth, and DSO:\n\nSource: S&P Capital IQ. Data is current as of last fully reported fiscal quarter. FQ = fiscal quarter.\n\nThe standard way to calculate DSO uses average accounts receivable. I prefer to look at end-of-quarter receivables, but I've plotted both above.\n\nWatching the trends\n\nWhen that red line (AR growth) crosses above the green line (revenue growth), I know I need to consult the filings. Similarly, a spike in the blue bars indicates a trend worth worrying about. Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's latest average DSO stands at 184.1 days, and the end-of-quarter figure is 186.2 days. Differences in business models can generate variations in DSO, and business needs can require occasional fluctuations, but all things being equal, I like to see this figure stay steady. So, let's get back to our original question: Based on DSO and sales, does Simcere Pharmaceutical Group. look like it might miss its numbers in the next quarter or two?\n\nI don't think so. AR and DSO look healthy. For the last fully reported fiscal quarter, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's year-over-year revenue grew 5.7%, and its AR dropped 14.4%. That looks OK. End-of-quarter DSO decreased 19.0% from the prior-year quarter. It was about the same as the prior quarter. Still, I'm no fortuneteller, and these are just numbers. Investors putting their money on the line always need to dig into the filings for the root causes and draw their own conclusions."
