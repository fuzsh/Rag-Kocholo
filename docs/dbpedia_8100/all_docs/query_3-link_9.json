        "text": "Research funding in oncology, autoimmune, and CNS disease areas\n\nCAMBRIDGE, MA — Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Limited (2096.HK) (Simcere), announced a Sponsored Research Agreement with Mass General Brigham. With more than 80,000 employees, 13 Nobel laureates and an annual research budget of $2 billion, Mass General Brigham is one of the largest and most prestigious academic medical centers in the United States. Under the agreement up to eight research groups at Mass General Brigham will be funded on select projects over the course of two years.\n\nThe agreement aims to establish a mutually beneficial partnership that will advance scientific research and create new treatment options for patients with cancer, autoimmune, and CNS diseases. By partnering with Mass General Brigham, Simcere gains access to cutting-edge research and leading clinical capabilities which will help accelerate the company’s global R&D efforts. In return, this collaboration will support the biopharma community by providing additional resources for medical research and clinical trials.\n\n“We believe that this Sponsored Research Agreement with Mass General Brigham represents a significant step forward in our efforts to develop innovative new treatment options for patients around the world,” said Zhou Gaobo, chief investment officer, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group. “This partnership underscores our commitment to advancing drug development and building long-term partnerships that benefit not only Simcere but also the broader medical community and ultimately, the patients.”\n\n“The discoveries resulting from this agreement could further advance potentially game-changing technology to the front lines of care in three areas of rapid clinical advancement and high patient need — neurology, oncology, and inflammation and immunology,” said Chris Coburn, chief innovation officer at Mass General Brigham. “We’re excited to collaborate with industry partners, such as Simcere, whose expanding presence in the Boston area is reflective of our region’s continued growth as a biotech hub.”\n\nThe presence of Simcere’s Boston Innovation Center (BIC) in the Cambridge area will provide opportunities for local collaboration and partnerships, leading to further synergies between participating research groups. Additionally, Simcere’s Project X, which aims at providing highly talented scientist with funding and employment, will further contribute to the local medical research community.\n\nOverall, the Sponsored Research Agreement with Mass General Brigham, announced at the World Medical Innovation Forum 2023 in Boston, is an exciting development for Simcere and represents a substantial step forward in the company’s efforts to further enhance its global R&D capabilities and develop innovative therapeutics for patients around the world.\n\nIn separate announcement today, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group also announced the company is continuing its global footprint as Zaiming has established a subsidiary, Simcere Zaiming, Inc., in Massachusetts, USA."
