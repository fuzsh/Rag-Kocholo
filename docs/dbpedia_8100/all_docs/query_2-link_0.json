        "text": "Cosela® (trilaciclib hydrochloride for injection) is the world's first innovative drug jointly developed by Simcere and G1 Therapeutics, which is administered before chemotherapy for comprehensive myeloprotection against chemotherapy damages and was certified as a \"Breakthrough Therapy\" by FDA. It was launched in the United States in Feb. 2021. In Aug. 2020, Simcere entered into an exclusive license agreement with G1 to obtain rights for the development and commercialization of Cosela® for all indications in Greater China.\n\nA pivotal phase Ⅱ clinical study, led by Professor Lin Shen from Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute，has evaluated the efficacy and safety of Envafolimab in patients with advanced dMMR/MSI-H tumors. The updated clinical data presented at CSCO 2021 showed that the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of patients who received Envafolimab as second or later-line treatment is 44.7%, including 12 (11.7%) cases of Complete Response (CR). The responses were durable, and the rates of durable response at 12 months in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), advanced gastric cancer, other advanced solid tumors, and all patients were 89.3%, 100%, 100%, and 93.2%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.1 months, 12-month overall survival (OS) rate was 73.6%. Envafolimab was well tolerated in this study with no cases of immune-related pneumonitis, immune-related colitis, immune-related nephritis, or infusion related reactions reported.\n\nAt present, Envafolimab is being studied in clinical trials in multiple tumor types in China, the United States and Japan, including registration/phaseⅢclinical trials in multiple indications. Envafolimab obtained orphan drug designation from the US FDA for the treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer and soft tissue sarcoma.\n\nIt is the first listed class I anti-tumor drug in the world, with patents from China and the United States. In addition, it has won the second prize of National Technological Invention Award and China Patent Gold Award, and has been listed in the National Medical Insurance Catalog since 2017.\n\nPlatinum-based agents exert the function by binding to DNAs to interfere with their replication, thereby preventing the division and growth of tumor cells. As a second-generation platinum-based agent, nedaplatin is more dissoluble in water and appears to be less toxic to the kidneys and the digestive system, and therefore more suitable for elderly patients as well as patients with renal insufficiency.\n\nAs a cornerstone drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma, Bortezomib is used throughout the induction, consolidation and maintenance therapies for myeloma. In 2020, Bortezomib was recommended as a first-line drug for the full management of multiple myeloma in the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Myeloma in China and was included in the NDRL.\n\nAs a national class I innovative drug, Sanbexin® can improve the neurological function of patients with strokes by inhibiting the dual mechanisms of oxidative stress damage and inflammatory damage. Sanbexin® owns eight patents, with core patents authorized in the US, Japan and European countries and regions. It has received national special support for \"Significant New Drug Development\" and been awarded as one of “China’s Milestone Medical Achievements During the 13th Five-Year Plan Period”.\n\nIREMOD® is the first iguratimod approved for sale in the world and the only iguratimod approved for sale in China. It is also the only domestically-developed small molecule DMARD that was marketed over the past decade. IREMOD® has been recommended as the primary medication for treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis by multiple clinical practice guidelines and diagnosis criteria at home and abroad.\n\nRUIFUSHU is the first nephrology product by Simcere, and has passed the consistency evaluation. It has been recommended by numerous domestic and international guidelines as the first-line treatment for preventing rejection following organ transplantation.\n\nIn December 2019, mycophenolate mofetil was approved for the treatment of class III-IV lupus nephritis of adult patients. This indication was included in the new National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), updated in March.\n\nIn addition, mycophenolate mofetil can also be used to treat other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, scleroderma, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy (MN) and Nephrotic syndrome (NS).\n\nAmoxicillin mainly acts in the reproduction stage of microorganisms and inhibits the biosynthesis of cell wall mucopolypeptides. Potassium clavulanate can inactivate these enzymes produced by most bacteria by blocking the active site of β-lactamase. ANQI® produced by our company has two dosage forms—tablets and granules.\n\nThe Spleen-invigorating Bazhen Cake is made based on the recipe devised by Chen Shigong, a renowned imperial physician in the Ming Dynasty. As one of the classic recipes for strengthening the spleen and stomach, it was widely used and loved by the imperial members and the general public. This product in the form of a \"cake\" is developed by a team led by Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine. The sweet and fragrant product is convenient and safe to take as it is prepared with ingredients that are also used to make food, free of preservatives.\n\nQixuekang Oral Liquid nourishes and moisturizes your body to elevate qi and blood, thereby improving your complexion and sleep.Qixuekang Oral Liquid contains Panax notoginseng that invigorates and nourishes the blood, ginseng that supplements qi and soothes the nerves, Astragalus membranaceus that supplements qi and blood, and Kudzu root that transports nutrients and body fluid upwards. It improves insomnia, fatigue, lack of qi and blood, poor immunity, dry skin, dry mouth and tongue, dry cough, and other problems caused by insufficient nutrition in the upper body.\n\nBy physical action, BIQI® montmorillonite powders can physically cover the surface of the gastrointestinal tract, and adsorb pathogenic factors, so as to quickly solve various diarrhea problems, without the need to enter the blood circulation, therefore being safe and non-toxic. Its prescription and preparation technique have obtained EU GMP certification and are now available in China and Europe.\n\nThe key to calcium supplementation is absorption, and the key to absorption is to ensure the absorbing of active vitamin D. The main ingredient of FANENG® is active vitamin D, which is used to treat osteoporosis, and can effectively promote the absorption of calcium and reduce the incidence of hypercalcemia."
