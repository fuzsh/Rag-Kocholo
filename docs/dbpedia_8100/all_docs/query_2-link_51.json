        "text": "According to GlobalData’s company profile on Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, Cancer treatment biomarkers was a key innovation area identified from patents. Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's grant share as of January 2024 was 38%. Grant share is based on the ratio of number of grants to total number of patents.\n\nA patent application (Publication Number: US20240033247A1) discloses a method for treating cerebral stroke by administering a composition containing edaravone and dexborneol to patients with a history of hypertension. The weight ratio of edaravone to dexborneol in the composition can range from 1:1 to 8:1, with a preferred ratio of 4:1. The composition is typically administered 1-3 times a day for 3-21 consecutive days, with a dosage of 10-30 mg/dose of edaravone. Additionally, the composition may include a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant such as sodium metabisulfite, propylene glycol, or water for injection.\n\nFurthermore, the method specifies that the cerebral stroke being treated is typically an ischemic stroke, including acute ischemic stroke. Upon administration of the composition, the plasma exposure ratio of edaravone to dexborneol in the patient is maintained within the range of 1:1 to 8:1 or 1:1 to 5:1. This method provides a detailed protocol for the treatment of cerebral stroke using a specific combination of edaravone and dexborneol, highlighting the importance of dosage, frequency of administration, and the ratio of the two components in the composition. The patent application aims to offer a novel and potentially effective treatment option for patients in need of cerebral stroke management, particularly those with a history of hypertension.\n\nTo know more about GlobalData’s detailed insights on Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, buy the report here."
