The official took the money and vowed to try his best, according to court documents from 2016.\n\nSeveral months later, Mr. Du got the greenlight to begin clinical trials for two vaccines. They were ultimately approved, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nThe government official was jailed for taking bribes from Mr. Du and several other vaccine makers. Mr. Du was never charged."
