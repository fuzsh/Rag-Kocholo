Healthy People 2030 focuses on helping people get the social support they need in the places where they are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age.\n\nMany people face challenges and dangers they can’t control — like unsafe neighborhoods, discrimination, or trouble affording the things they need. This can have a negative impact on health and safety throughout life."
