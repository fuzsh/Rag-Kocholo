        "text": "TIPTON, Ind. — Murder is rare here so when Olene Emberton's nude body was found lying in a ditch a few miles outside town people were stunned. They were changed.\n\nAn unsolved crime is always unsettling, but it's especially unsettling in a small town like the Tipton (pop. 5,106), where people know each other and so may regard neighbors with fresh eyes and wonder who's capable of what.\n\nOlene's father certainly did.\n\nOn Oct. 20, 1965, two days after Olene was found, Floyd Emberton stood in the Leatherman-Morris Funeral Home next to his 17-year-old daughter's casket. It was open despite Olene's body being so bloated that by one account her eyeglasses had to be bent to fit on her face. The scent of flowers was overwhelming — \"almost sickening,\" said Janis Thornton, one of about 100 of Olene's classmates who came to pay their respects.\n\nThey'd walked over together from Tipton High, a distance of about eight blocks. There at the casket the distraught father buttonholed each of the boys and demanded, \"Did you do this?! Are you the one responsible?!\"\n\nThornton, who'd gone to school with Olene since the fourth grade, never forgot the scene. Nor did she forget the other bizarre events that followed Olene's mysterious death. Nobody forgot. Fifty-three years later people in Tipton still speculate about what happened.\n\n\"Before Olene, Tipton was Mayberry,\" said Thornton. \"After her body was found, there was a darkness.\"\n\nRetro Indy: The 1978 Burger Chef murders remain unsolved\n\nTrue crime: The 'dresser drawer murder' at the Claypool Hotel\n\nIn 2004 Thornton, then a copy editor and feature writer with the Frankfort Times in nearby Clinton County, in her spare time began a deep dive into the case.\n\nShe'd first considered the project in the mid-1980s following a class reunion at which everyone was still buzzing about Olene. But Thornton's parents warned against it. \"They said, 'Just stay out of it!'\" she said. \"There were terrible rumors about what might have happened to Olene. My parents were afraid I might stir things up and get myself in trouble.\"\n\nThornton waited until her mother died, in 1995, to start the project. Her father lived until 2011, but she kept him in the dark.\n\nShe finished her work this spring, and her self-published a book, \"Too Good a Girl\" (180 pages), comes out in August. Thornton believes she may have solved the crime. She at least broke some news, a feat considering the events she describes happened more than 50 years ago.\n\nWas it an accident or murder?\n\nOlene's death may not have been murder. There was not a mark on the girl's body other than some bug bites. An autopsy was performed, toxicology tests were conducted. But a cause of death was never determined, which is highly unusual.\n\nDr. James McFadden, a pathologist from Lafayette, performed the autopsy. James Pratt, Tipton's police chief, was in the room. McFadden died in 1987. Thornton interviewed Pratt in 2006. Pratt said McFadden did a thorough job but was stymied. \"After (McFadden) finished,\" Pratt said, \"he looked around and said, 'I don't see any reason why this girl's not sitting here telling us what happened.' He said her heart 'just quit.'\"\n\nThere were conflicting reports about whether she'd been raped, or whether she'd had consensual sex.\n\nOlene's death may have been accidental. Still, in the darkness of night someone left a dead body in a ditch and lit out without telling anyone, leaving a small Central Indiana town to point fingers for the next half century.\n\nOlene Emberton was last seen alive late on a Saturday night. She'd gone on a date to the movies with a classmate named Phil Roudebush. She drove. They went to the Diana Theater on Jefferson Street, Tipton's main drag, and saw \"Tomb of Ligeia,\" a low-budget horror film starring Vincent Price.\n\nShe dropped off her date around 11:30 p.m. and drove west towards her house, six blocks away. Her car was found the next morning parked on Green Street, mid-distance between her house and Roudebush's. The car's positioning and condition betrayed no signs of struggle, and none of the neighbors heard any disorderly noise. The thinking was Olene parked and got into someone else's car willingly and that she must have known the person.\n\nHer family called police Sunday morning, and the search for Olene began. \"Girl Missing From Home,\" said a headline in Monday's Tipton Tribune above a yearbook photo of Olene, smiling and wearing cat eye glasses.\n\nThornton and her friends at school considered the exciting possibility Olene had run off with a boy. They figured when she came home she'd be in big trouble or married or both — \"It didn't occur to any of us she'd be in any actual danger.\"\n\nTipton was that innocent.\n\nOlene's body was found Monday afternoon by farmers. Her clothing was found folded next to the body.\n\n\"It was a shock, things like this didn't happen,\" said Charles Edwards, the former Tipton High principal, who at 95 remembers the incident clearly. \"Tipton is a little agricultural community. It didn't make sense.\"\n\nSuspicion fell immediately on a high school senior said to have a smug smile and hair made blond via peroxide named Tom Preston. Olene had dated him. A friend of Preston's described him to Thornton as \"the single most girl hound.\"\n\nUnsolved: Family waits for father's killer to be caught\n\nIndiana unsolved in photos: Review these cold case crimes\n\nBut Thornton didn't have to be told this becauseshe knew Preston. It was Preston who, during a game of spin the bottle, had given Thornton her first kiss. \"I've often joked that Tom Preston was my first sociopath,\" she writes in her book. \"He was not a nice person.\" But she never suspected Preston in Olene Emberton's death, and after questioning him, neither did police.\n\nBut Floyd Emberton did suspect him. \"Mr. Emberton was a very strong parent, rather strict, strong in his opinions, not a trouble maker but he did have a temper,\" said Principal Edwards.\n\nIn the days after Olene's death, Floyd Emberton turned up the pressure on Preston. He parked Olene's car, a hard-to-miss 1957 Chevrolet painted bright red, in front of the young man's house day after day for a month.\n\nPrincipal Edwards said he felt obliged to order all school doors locked to protect Preston from Olene's father. For several days Preston was driven to school in the morning by a sheriff's deputy, and picked up from school in the afternoon by a sheriff's deputy. And for two nights, for his own safety, Preston bedded down in the county jail.\n\nDad takes a lie detector test. Mom consults a psychic\n\nThe Embertons — there was Floyd, wife Roxie, daughter Olene and three sons — moved to Tipton from Tompkinsville, Ky. in the late 1940s. They were part of a broad northern migration of rural whites fleeing impoverished Appalachia for the industrial Midwest. They were churchgoers, and they were hard workers. They didn't take vacations, said their daughter-in-law, Debbie Emberton, or even naps.\n\nOlene was the Embertons' oldest child and only daughter. In school she got B's and was a member of a few clubs but otherwise didn't stand out. She planned to go to Ball State University and become a teacher.\n\nFloyd began in Tipton as a sharecropper then got a good factory job and kept it while at the same time starting and managing two successful businesses, a small used car lot and a large trailer park. He and his wife built their house, a simple but still solid one-story ranch, with their own hands. They'd been children during the Great Depression, and he'd left school before the sixth grade. He did not know how to read.\n\nRoxie kept chickens. She canned fruit and vegetables and also made clothing and draperies. She made doll clothes and ceramics and sold them for good money at Tipton's annual Pork Festival. \"There wasn't anything that woman couldn't do,\" said Debbie Emberton, her daughter-in-law. \"She'd be on top of a house or on top of one of the trailers in the trailer park, putting on a roof. And at night she'd quilt. I never saw anything like it.\"\n\nEven now some people in Tipton suspect the Embertons were able to start their trailer park because of hush money slipped their way by certain of Tipton's leading businessmen. A rumor in the town was — and still is — that Olene had been sexually active with several of the town's elites, that they'd been somehow involved in her death and that they wanted to cover it up.\n\nThis ignores the fact the Embertons opened both the trailer park and the used car lot several years before Olene's death. But it shows the power of speculation, which in the absence of evidence was all the townsfolk had as they tried to make sense of what happened to Olene.\n\nThe Embertons themselves were desperate to learn the truth. They hired an investigator from the Pinkerton Detective Agency. They offered a $5,000 reward. Roxie was still regularly consulting a psychic 25 years later. \"Lady in Frankfort,\" said Debbie Emberton. \"She'd light a candle and close her eyes. I was thinking it was silly. Nothing ever came of it.\"\n\nSuspicion soon fell on Floyd Emberton himself, and a month after his daughter's death he agreed to take a lie detector test. He was never arrested. Thornton presumes the test cleared him.\n\nIn her research Thornton talked to dozens of Olene's friends, acquaintances and relatives. She interviewed police investigators. She sifted through court documents. She read old newspapers. But she was frustrated that she was able to find but few original documents from the investigation, and none of the notes from the chief investigator, Tipton County Sheriff Verl Grimme.\n\nGrimme, who would have overseen Floyd Emberton's lie detector test, left office in 1970 after two terms. He died in 1991 at age 75 of natural causes.\n\nFloyd Emberton died in 1981 at age 54 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. It was July 4. He used a shotgun. Roxie had gone to Kentucky to visit family for the holiday. He did not leave a note.\n\nA doctor had told him he had depression, and Floyd had taken that as an insult. \"He thought, 'There isn't anything wrong with my mind,'\" said Debbie Emberton. \"But he'd lost weight and he would be tired and have to lie down. His demeanor changed.\"\n\nA fatal crash, a new 'person of interest'\n\nBy the spring of his senior year at Tipton High, Tom Preston's demeanor also had changed. He had become more erratic. He'd developed a drinking problem and was behaving self-destructively, several of his friends told Thornton.\n\nTwelve days after getting his diploma, and about seven months after the death of Olene Emberton, Preston died in a car accident. It was about midnight on a Wednesday, and he was riding with another teenager east of Tipton on State Road 28, not far from where Olene Emberton's body had been found.\n\nThe car \"skidded out of control and wrapped itself around a tree,\" the Tipton Tribune reported. Preston broke his neck and was dead at the scene. Some of the folks in town took that for justice.\n\nBut just weeks before Preston's death and six months after Olene's, another person of interest emerged. Perry Steven Miller, who'd been a year ahead of Olene at Tipton High, was arrested in April 1966 for assault and battery after allegedly attempting to rape an 18-year-old Tipton woman.\n\nLocal investigators saw a possible connection to the Olene Emberton case and swarmed Miller. According to a complaint filed in court by Miller's lawyer, at least four officers \"intensively interrogated and questioned\" Miller from the time he was brought into the Tipton County Jail, at 9 p.m., until 2:30 a.m. without allowing Miller to contact an attorney. They peppered him with questions about Olene Emberton. Miller denied involvement.\n\nThornton believes Miller was well-acquainted with Olene because of an item she came across in her reporting. It was a wallet-size photo of Miller taken his junior year at Tipton High with this inscription on the back: \"To Olene, One of the nicest girls I know and like to be with and also who can understand me most of the time. Love Always, Steve '65'.\" Olene's mother had found the photo in her daughter's bedroom and turned it over to investigators.\n\nNothing linking Miller to the Olene Emberton case appeared in the press, however, so most of Tipton was unaware of investigators' suspicions.\n\nMiller's trial for the alleged 1966 assault, delayed several times, was still pending three years later when Miller was charged with another sex crime, the abduction and rape of a 19-year-old girl from the nearby town of Arcadia. Two weeks after that he was charged with still another abduction/rape, this one involving a 15-year-old girl seized from nearby Elwood.\n\nIn October 1969 Miller was found guilty of the Arcadia crime and sentenced to life in prison. He spent the next 19 years in the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, and then was set free.\n\nUpon leaving prison, in 1988, Miller moved to Porter County where two years later he orchestrated, with two other men, the particularly sadistic abduction, rape and murder of a 19-year-old convenience store clerk. (When police came to Miller's home to arrest him they found him hiding in his back yard in a hole. He'd covered the hole with leaves.)\n\nMiller was sentenced to death in 1993 but later had his sentence was commuted to life without parole. He now resides at the Miami County Correctional Facility in Bunker Hill.\n\nTwice while working on her investigation into the death of Olene Emberton, Thornton contacted Miller in prison seeking an interview. She was seeking a confession. She wanted to clear the thing up. Miller declined to speak with her. Miller also declined to be interviewed by the Indianapolis Star.\n\nCold cases sometimes get solved, such as the August 1992 murder of an exotic dancer named Toni Spicer, found beaten to death in her home near Peru, Ind.\n\nNine years later the case was assigned to an Indiana State Police detective named Mike Tarrh, who eventually solved it using DNA evidence. In 2011, 19 years after Spicer's death, a DNA match led Tarrh to Timothy Jimerson, who'd been arrested in Biloxi, Mississippi. Jimerson admitted he'd killed Spicer, according to a court document, \"because she laughed at him during a sexual encounter.\"\n\nA ray of hope for a cold case\n\nTarrh retired from Indiana State Police Department in 2015 and took a job with the Tipton County Sheriff's Department. There, while getting acquainted with his new jurisdiction and sifting through files, he came across a dossier on the Olene Emberton case that Janis Thornton had submitted the year before. \"That piqued my interest,\" Tarrh said.\n\nHe considered the Perry Steven Miller angle to be \"something to pursue, a possibility.\" He poked around, he interviewed people. But \"nobody had anything that tied Steve Miller to this death.\"\n\nTarrh figured his only hope was a face-to-face meeting with Miller. Last May he drove to the Miami Correctional Facility, and asked to speak to Miller. Miller could have declined, but he didn't.\n\n\"They brought him into the interview room,\" Tarrh said, \"and I introduced myself — it was basically, 'I'm here looking into the unexplained death of Olene Emberton, and I know you knew her.'\"\n\nMiller, in prison for life, would have lost nothing by confessing. Nothing would change for him. He is 70. He denied any knowledge of the death of Olene, he said he barely even knew her. Tarrh showed him the note he'd scribbled to Olene on the back of his school photo all those years ago. Miller batted that away, saying \"that was something kids did back then.\"\n\nMiller went on to deny involvement in any crime, even the ones for which he'd been convicted.\n\nTarrh kept the conversation going for more than an hour and made sure to end it on good terms. He shook Miller's hand and said, \"If you can think of anything that would solve this unexplained death, I'll be glad to come back and talk.\"\n\n'It kept eating at me'\n\nPerry Steven Miller had spent his entire childhood in Tipton County. Principal Edwards remembered Miller, remembered he had had a truancy problem. Miller was on a youth baseball team coached by a farmer named Verl Grimme, later Sheriff Grimme. There is so much about this story that's interrelated. Small towns are personal, people know each other.\n\nOn Aug. 4, a Saturday, about 100 Tipton residents, many of them high school classmates of Olene Emberton's, came to the town's library to hear a presentation by Janis Thornton. They had a lot of questions, including several about DNA, which did not become a crime fighting tool until the 1980s.\n\nWhy not employ DNA research now? Could any DNA evidence be gained by reexamining her clothes? Her clothes have been lost, said Thornton.\n\nOne person in the audience said: Why not exhume the body? Brad Nichols, the Tipton County corner, took that question. It's possible — though not a given — that DNA evidence could still be detected, Nichols said. But even if it were, it would be inconclusive because anyone passing the open casket, any mourner, could have touched the body.\n\nJanis Thornton, who devoted years to investigating Olene's case, oddly did not know Olene. \"We'd been in school together since fourth grade, I was aware of her,\" Thornton said, \"but I don't ever remember even talking to her.\"\n\nOlene's death, however, \"was something that kept eating at me,\" Thornton said, \"and I'm not sure why. But I thought somebody had to do this, somebody needed to investigate it and write it before it's too late, before there is nobody around who remembers.\"\n\nThornton said she will give any profits from the sale of her book to a scholarship fund she and some friends set up in Olene's name at Tipton High School. They hope to raise $25,000, which would allow them to give away the interest from the fund, $1,000 each year, to a graduate who plans to become a teacher, as Olene had planned."
