        "text": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK.\n\nDementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities.\n\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition.\n\nThese include:\n\nincreasing age\n\na family history of the condition\n\nuntreated depression, although depression can also be one of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease\n\nlifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease\n\nRead more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nSigns and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. It affects multiple brain functions.\n\nThe first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems.\n\nFor example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects.\n\nAs the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as:\n\nconfusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places\n\ndifficulty planning or making decisions\n\nproblems with speech and language\n\nproblems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks\n\npersonality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others\n\nhallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue)\n\nlow mood or anxiety\n\nRead more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWho is affected?\n\nAlzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65.\n\nThe risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80.\n\nBut around 1 in every 13 people with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is called early- or young-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGetting a diagnosis\n\nAs the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older.\n\nAlso, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a \"normal\" part of the ageing process.\n\nAn accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help.\n\nIf you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP.\n\nIf possible, someone who knows you well should be with you as they can help describe any changes or problems they have noticed.\n\nIf you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.\n\nThere's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. And it's important to remember that memory problems do not necessarily mean you have Alzheimer's disease.\n\nA GP will ask questions about any problems you're experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions.\n\nIf Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist service to:\n\nassess your symptoms in more detail\n\norganise further testing, such as brain scans if necessary\n\ncreate a treatment and care plan\n\nRead more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHow Alzheimer's disease is treated\n\nThere's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medicines are available that can help relieve some of the symptoms.\n\nVarious other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks.\n\nPsychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.\n\nRead more about treating Alzheimer's disease.\n\nOutlook\n\nPeople with Alzheimer's disease can live for several years after they start to develop symptoms. But this can vary considerably from person to person.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause.\n\nAs Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing.\n\nThis can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs), which can cause frequent chest infections.\n\nIt's also common for people with Alzheimer's disease to eventually have difficulty eating and have a reduced appetite.\n\nThere's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer's disease need palliative care.\n\nThis includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's.\n\nCan Alzheimer's disease be prevented?\n\nAs the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition.\n\nBut there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as:\n\nstopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol\n\neating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight\n\nstaying physically fit and mentally active\n\nThese measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.\n\nRead more about preventing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMore information\n\nDementia can affect all aspects of a person's life, as well as their family's.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with dementia, or you're caring for someone with the condition, remember that advice and support is available to help you live well.\n\nRead more about:\n\nStaying independent with dementia\n\nLiving well with dementia\n\nCommunicating with someone with dementia\n\nLooking after someone with dementia\n\nCoping with dementia behaviour changes\n\nHelp and support for people with dementia\n\nDementia, social services and the NHS\n\nInformation:\n\nSocial care and support guide\n\nIf you:\n\nneed help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\n\ncare for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled â€“ including family members\n\nOur guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support."
