For me, the cleverly executed Vino Veritas, about two middle-age couples and an honesty-inducing bottle of wine, speaks directly and profoundly about marriage, child-rearing, career choices, even the existence of God. It also made me laugh -- hard.\"\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\n\"Both funny and gut-wrenching . . . MacGregor especially shines with his meticulous planning and realistic dialogue. Nothing occurs by happenstance; even the Halloween costumes are significant. And he continuously digs deeper into the psyches of his characters, thereby revealing just how human and unpredictable they -- and we -- really are.\"\n\nBetween the Lines\n\n\"That Vino gets so personal and often hits so close to home, is noteworthy in and of itself. It wasn't uncommon to see laughter erupting from one member of the audience, while the person next to them held a hand to their face in embarrassment or shock . . . challenges real-world beliefs so smartly that it's a wonder anyone had the wherewithal to blink without making a conscious effort. Vino Veritas is a potion that everyone should taste.\"\n\nDexter Leader"
