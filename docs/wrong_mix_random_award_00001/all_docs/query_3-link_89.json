        "text": "What is an Emotional Support Animal (ESA)?\n\nAn Emotional Support Animal (ESA) is an animal that provides a therapeutic benefit (e.g., emotional support, comfort, companionship) to a person with a mental health or psychiatric disability (such as a serious mental health condition). An ESA is not considered a Service Animal, but under U.S. law, an emotional support animal is also not considered a pet and is generally not restricted by the type of animal.1, 2 Any domesticated animal may be considered as an ESA (e.g., cats, dogs, mice, rabbits, birds, hedgehogs, rats, minipigs, ferrets, etc.) and they can be any age. However, an ESA must be able to be manageable in public and does not create a nuisance.\n\nESA’s do not perform specific tasks, instead, it is the presence of the animal that relieves the symptoms associated with a person’s serious mental health condition. For a person to legally have an emotional support animal (ESA), the owner must be considered to have a qualifying mental health or psychiatric disability by a licensed mental health professional (e.g., therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, etc.), which is documented by a properly formatted prescription letter. The difference between a legitimate ESA and a pet is the letter from your licensed mental health professional.\n\nHow do I figure out if an ESA is right for me?\n\nThere are no hard rules about who would and would not benefit from an ESA. The primary benefit is often the simple companionship that comes from spending time with an animal. Animals can be a great comfort during times of distress and a much-needed positive presence on a difficult day. Depending on the type of animal, taking care of an animal can be a lot of work. For some, this kind of responsibility can be useful motivation to do things like adhere to routines (e.g., feeding your animal at the same time(s) every day) or get outside and exercise regularly (e.g., walking a dog).\n\nIf you think that an ESA might be right for you, start a conversation with your mental health professionals about it. Tell them why you think having an ESA would be beneficial to you specifically. Your professional may already know about ESAs and be able to tell you if they would recommend one for you, or you might need to learn more about ESAs together before they make a recommendation.\n\nWhere do ESAs come from?\n\nESAs can come from any of the places that pets come from. Unlike Service Animals, ESAs do not need to be raised or trained in a specific way. Emotional Support Animals can be adopted from shelters, purchased from breeders or pet stores, or obtained from anywhere else that a pet could come from – maybe your neighbor’s cat had kittens!\n\nCan I bring an ESA with me to college?\n\nYes! The Fair Housing Act (FHA) says that “Housing providers cannot refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability the equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”4 This means that colleges and universities must allow ESAs in housing, even if there is a no-pet policy.\n\nHow do I bring an ESA with me to college?\n\nPolicies vary from school to school and it is important to learn about your school’s specific policy regarding ESAs. Typically, the process begins in the school’s office of disability services. The disability office will ask for documentation of a disability and a letter from a licensed mental health professional stating that an ESA is needed. Some schools may have additional requirements such as the length of time that you have been a patient of the mental health professional. The school might ask to see documentation of veterinarian visits, relevant vaccinations, or other evidence that your animal is healthy and being taken care of properly.\n\nWhat else do I need to do before I bring my ESA on campus?\n\nEmotional support animals are considered a housing accommodation, and therefore you may also need to communicate directly with your school’s housing office. You might need to communicate with other offices (e.g., campus security) and individuals (e.g., your resident advisor and/or students you live with) about the logistics of having an animal on campus. Schools have different rules about different kinds of animals – bringing a rabbit onto a campus looks very different from bringing a dog, pig, or mini horse. For example, owners of dogs may be asked to register their dog with the town/city in which the school is located."
