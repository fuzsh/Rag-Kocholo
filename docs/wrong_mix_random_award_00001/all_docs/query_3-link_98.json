        "text": "Heat-related health problems\n\nHeat kills more Australians than any other natural disaster. Climate change is resulting in more hot days and more intense heatwaves. Now more than ever it’s important to know the risks of heat and how to protect yourself and others.\n\nExtreme heat can affect anybody. Those more at-risk include people over the age of 65, babies and young children, pregnant women, people with acute or chronic health problems and people who are socially isolated.\n\nHeat-related health problems occur when our bodies can’t cool down well enough to maintain a healthy temperature, or become dehydrated through sweating.\n\nHeat can cause serious and potentially fatal health problems such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke, trigger sudden events like heart attack or stroke, or worsen existing medical conditions like kidney or lung disease.\n\nYou can take steps to protect yourself and others by keeping cool, staying hydrated, planning ahead and checking in with others.\n\nPeople more at-risk of heat-related health problems\n\nAnyone can suffer from heat-related health problems, but those more at-risk include:\n\nPeople over 65 years\n\nBabies and young children\n\nPregnant women\n\nPeople who have existing medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or mental illness\n\nPeople on certain medications including diuretics (fluid tablets), beta-blockers, drugs with anticholinergic properties, and central nervous system stimulants\n\nPeople who work or exercise outdoors\n\nPeople who are socially isolated or living alone, because there may not be someone to support or check in with them during extreme heat.\n\nPeople with limited ways to keep cool, such as air conditioning, including people living in buildings that heat up easily or people who are experiencing homelessness.\n\nCauses of heat-related health problems\n\nDuring hot weather, our bodies work to prevent overheating by sweating and redirecting blood flow to the skin. People can also take actions such as staying cool using air-conditioning, and drinking more water than usual. Heat-related health problems happen when these protective changes in the body, combined with the actions people take are not enough to avoid overheating or dehydration, and organ systems begin to malfunction.\n\nHeat-related health problems occur through several pathways:\n\nA major rise in body temperature, due to a build-up of heat, leads to conditions such as heat exhaustion, and eventually heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.\n\nThe redirection of blood flow to the skin, means that the heart must work harder than normal. Strain on the heart can cause problems for people with existing heart conditions, for example by triggering a heart attack.\n\nAn increase in sweating can lead to dehydration if fluid loss is not replaced by drinking enough. Dehydration can cause weakness and fainting, lead to kidney problems and worsen other medical conditions.\n\nSymptoms and first aid for heat-related health problems\n\nIt is important to know the signs and symptoms of heat-related health problems and how to respond. Symptoms vary according to the type of health problem.\n\nApply first aid and seek medical assistance immediately if someone shows signs of heat exhaustion, heatstroke or another health emergency.\n\nDeterioration in existing medical conditions\n\nExtreme heat can worsen existing health problems. Conditions that may be triggered or worsened by heat include:\n\nHeart attack\n\nStroke\n\nKidney problems\n\nAsthma and other respiratory illnesses (especially in the presence of air pollution or smoke).\n\nDehydration\n\nDehydration occurs when the body doesn’t have enough fluid to carry out its normal functions.\n\nSymptoms of dehydration include:\n\nThirst\n\nDry mouth\n\nPassing less urine than usual\n\nDark or strong-smelling urine\n\nDizziness or headache\n\nIrritability or difficultly thinking clearly.\n\nFirst aid for dehydration due to heat includes:\n\nMove to a cool area and rest.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids.\n\nRemove unnecessary clothing.\n\nCool down by wetting the skin with cool water.\n\nSee a doctor if there is no improvement or you are concerned.\n\nHeat exhaustion\n\nHeat exhaustion is a serious condition that can progress to heatstroke. It can occur when core body temperature rises to 38-39°C.\n\nSigns and symptoms of heat exhaustion include:\n\nHeavy sweating\n\nPale skin\n\nMuscle cramps\n\nWeakness\n\nDizziness, headache\n\nNausea, vomiting\n\nFainting\n\nRapid pulse.\n\nFirst aid for heat exhaustion includes:\n\nSeek immediate medical assistance by calling NURSE-ON-CALL on 1300 60 60 24 for 24-hour health advice, transporting the person to a doctor or emergency department, or contacting the Victorian Virtual Emergency DepartmentExternal Link – for non-life-threatening emergencies.\n\nCall Triple Zero (000) for an ambulance if medical care is unavailable, the person is not improving or if you think they could have heatstroke.\n\nGet the person to a cool area and lay them down.\n\nRemove excess clothing including shoes and socks.\n\nCool the person down: Wet their skin with cool water, fan continuously, apply a cool, damp sponge or cloth, or apply ice packs or crushed ice in a damp towel on the neck, groin or armpits. If they are able, have the person take a cool shower or bath.\n\nEncourage frequent sips of cool water.\n\nHeatstroke\n\nHeatstroke can occur when the core body temperature rises above 40 °C and blood flow to internal organs is restricted. Many organs in the body suffer damage and the body temperature must be reduced quickly.\n\nHeatstroke may appear similar to heat exhaustion, but the skin may be dry with no sweating and the person may appear confused or agitated. Signs and symptoms include:\n\nConfusion or agitation\n\nLoss of consciousness\n\nProfuse sweating or hot, dry skin\n\nMuscle twitching or seizures\n\nRapid breathing\n\nRapid pulse\n\nVery high body temperature.\n\nHeatstroke is a medical emergency and requires urgent attention:\n\nCall Triple Zero (000) immediately for an ambulance.\n\nWhile waiting for emergency medical help, get the person to a cool, shady area and lay them down. Have someone stay with the person.\n\nRemove excess clothing including shoes and socks.\n\nCool the person as quickly as possible: wet their skin with cool water, fan continuously, apply a cool, damp sponge or cloth, apply ice packs or crushed ice in a damp towel on the neck, groin or armpits.\n\nGive the person cool water to drink if they are fully conscious and able to swallow.\n\nPosition an unconscious person on their side and ensure they are breathing normally. If needed, perform CPR. Wait for the ambulance to urgently transport the person to hospital\n\nIf medical attention is delayed, seek further instructions from Triple Zero, ambulance or hospital emergency staff, while waiting for the ambulance.\n\nHeat cramps\n\nHeat cramp symptoms include muscle pains or spasms, usually in the abdomen, arms or legs.\n\nCramps may occur after strenuous activity in a hot environment, when the body gets depleted of salt and water.\n\nHeat cramps may also be a symptom of heat exhaustion.\n\nFirst aid for heat cramps includes:\n\nRest in a cool place.\n\nIncrease fluid intake.\n\nRest a few hours before returning to activity.\n\nSeek medical help if there is no improvement, the person affected is unwell or if you are concerned, by calling NURSE-ON-CALL on 1300 60 60 24 for 24-hour health advice, seeing your doctor or contacting the Victorian Virtual Emergency DepartmentExternal Link – for non-life-threatening emergencies.\n\nHeat rash\n\nHeat rash, also known as prickly heat, is an itchy skin irritation caused by excessive sweating.\n\nIt can occur at any age but is most common in babies and young children.\n\nHeat rash occurs when the body sweats more than usual.\n\nHeat rash is most likely to occur on the neck, upper chest, waistline, in the groin, under the breasts, and in skin folds and armpits.\n\nThe symptoms of heat rash include redness, mild swelling, and a cluster of small red spots in the affected area, associated with itch and prickling sensation.\n\nSymptoms of heat rash can last for several days.\n\nHeat rash normally goes away without treatment. To prevent heat rash and help it resolve faster you can:\n\nMove to a cooler and well ventilated, less humid environment to cool down and stop sweating.\n\nKeep the affected area dry.\n\nWear loose cotton clothing to help prevent overheating and avoid scratchy fabrics which irritate the skin.\n\nA pharmacy can recommend treatments to ease itching and inflammation.\n\nIf symptoms do not improve seek further medical attention. Call NURSE-ON-CALL on 1300 60 60 24 for 24-hour health advice, see your doctor or contact the Victorian Virtual Emergency DepartmentExternal Link – for non-life-threatening emergencies.\n\nPreventing heat-related health problems\n\nTake steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from heat-related health problems. Keep cool, stay hydrated, plan ahead and check in with others.\n\nRefer to the How to stay safe in extreme heat page for more information.\n\nWhere to get help"
