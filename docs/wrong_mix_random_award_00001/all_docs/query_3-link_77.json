        "text": "Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.\n\nGoogle Maps Platform products are secured from unauthorized use by restricting API calls to those that provide proper authentication credentials. These credentials are in the form of an API key - a unique alphanumeric string that associates your Google billing account with your project, and with the specific API or SDK.\n\nThis guide shows how to create, restrict, and use your API key for Google Maps Platform.\n\nBefore you begin\n\nBefore you start using the Places API, you need a project with a billing account and the Places API enabled. To learn more, see Set up in Cloud Console.\n\nCreating API keys\n\nThe API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project.\n\nTo create an API key:\n\nConsole\n\nGo to the Google Maps Platform > Credentials page.\n\nGo to the Credentials page\n\nOn the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key.\n\nThe API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.\n\nClick Close.\n\nThe new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys.\n\n(Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)\n\nCloud SDK\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys create \\ --project \"PROJECT\" \\ --display-name \"DISPLAY_NAME\"\n\nRead more about the Google Cloud SDK , Cloud SDK installation , and the following commands:\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys create\n\nRestricting API keys\n\nGoogle strongly recommends that you restrict your API keys by limiting their usage to those only APIs needed for your application. Restricting API keys adds security to your application by protecting it from unwarranted requests. For more information, see API security best practices.\n\nTo restrict an API key:\n\nConsole\n\nGo to the Google Maps Platform > Credentials page.\n\nGo to the Credentials page\n\nSelect the API key that you want to set a restriction on. The API key property page appears.\n\nUnder Key restrictions, set the following restrictions:\n\nApplication restrictions:\n\nTo accept requests from the list of web server IP addresses that you supply, select IP addresses (web servers, cron jobs, etc.) from the list of Application restrictions. Specify one or more IPv4 or IPv6 address, or subnet using CIDR notation. The IP addresses must match the source address the Google Maps Platform servers observe. If you use network address translation (NAT), this would typically correspond to your machine's public IP address.\n\nAPI restrictions:\n\nClick Restrict key.\n\nSelect either Places API or Places API (New) from Select APIs dropdown, but not both. If Places API or Places API (New) is not listed, you need to enable it.\n\nTo finalize your changes, click Save.\n\nCloud SDK\n\nPlaces API (New)\n\nList existing keys.\n\ngcloud services api-keys list --project=\"PROJECT\"\n\nClear existing restrictions on existing key.\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys update \"projects/PROJECT/keys/KEY_ID\" \\ --clear-restrictions\n\nSet new restrictions on existing key.\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys update \"projects/PROJECT/keys/KEY_ID\" \\ --api-target=\"places.googleapis.com\" --allowed-ips=\"IP_ADDRESS\"\n\nRead more about the Google Cloud SDK , Cloud SDK installation , and the following commands:\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys update\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys lookup\n\ngcloud services api-keys list\n\nPlaces API\n\nList existing keys.\n\ngcloud services api-keys list --project=\"PROJECT\"\n\nClear existing restrictions on existing key.\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys update \"projects/PROJECT/keys/KEY_ID\" \\ --clear-restrictions\n\nSet new restrictions on existing key.\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys update \"projects/PROJECT/keys/KEY_ID\" \\ --api-target=\"places-backend.googleapis.com\" --allowed-ips=\"IP_ADDRESS\"\n\nRead more about the Google Cloud SDK , Cloud SDK installation , and the following commands:\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys update\n\ngcloud alpha services api-keys lookup\n\ngcloud services api-keys list\n\nAdding the API key to your request\n\nYou must include an API key with every Places API request. In the following example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.\n\nhttps://places.googleapis.com/v1/places/ChIJj61dQgK6j4AR4GeTYWZsKWw?fields=id,displayName&key=YOUR_API_KEY\n\nHTTPS is required for requests that use an API key."
