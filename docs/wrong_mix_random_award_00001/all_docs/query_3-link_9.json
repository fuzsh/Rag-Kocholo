        "text": "PACs include separate segregated funds (SSFs), nonconnected committees and Super PACs.\n\nSSFs and nonconnected committees\n\nSSFs are political committees established and administered by corporations, labor unions, membership organizations or trade associations. These committees can solicit contributions only from individuals associated with a connected or sponsoring organization.\n\nBy contrast, nonconnected committees — as their name suggests — are not sponsored by or connected to any of the aforementioned entities and are free to solicit contributions from the general public.\n\nSuper PACs (independent expenditure only political committees) and Hybrid PACs (political committees with non-contribution accounts)\n\nSuper PACs (independent expenditure only political committees) are committees that may receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions and other PACs for the purpose of financing independent expenditures and other independent political activity.\n\nHybrid PACs (political committees with non-contribution accounts) solicit and accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor organizations and other political committees to a segregated bank account for the purpose of financing independent expenditures, other ads that refer to a federal candidate, and generic voter drives in federal elections, while maintaining a separate bank account, subject to all the statutory amount limitations and source prohibitions, that is permitted to make contributions to federal candidates.\n\nLeadership PACs\n\nA Leadership PAC is a political committee that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding federal office, but is not an authorized committee of the candidate or officeholder and is not affiliated with an authorized committee of a candidate or officeholder. Members of Congress and other political leaders often establish Leadership PACs in order to support candidates for various federal and nonfederal offices.\n\nLike other multicandidate PACs, a Leadership PAC may contribute up to $5,000 per election to a federal candidate committee."
