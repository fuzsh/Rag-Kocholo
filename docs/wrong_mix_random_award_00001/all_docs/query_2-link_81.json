        "text": "Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The city affirms its commitment to the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment in employment regardless of a personâs race, sex, age, color, religion, national origin, disability, or any other legally protected characteristic. In accepting a position at the city, you agree to share this commitment in the performance of your assigned responsibilities and in your interactions.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The city strives to provide all staff and vendors with an environment that is free of harassment or other unreasonable interference with the performance of their duties. We aspire to be a community in which mutual respect guides our day-to-day interactions. In our work environment, there is no place for conduct that demeans or belittles another person. For these reasons, harassment of any kind is unacceptable.\n\nÂ Â Â (B)Â Â Â Sexual harassment. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on sex constitutes sexual harassment when (1) submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment, (2) submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision, or (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individualâs work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. SEXUAL HARASSMENT is conduct based on sex, whether directed toward a person of the opposite or same sex, and may include explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, sexually oriented kidding or teasing, practical jokes, jokes about obscene printed or visual material, and physical contact such as patting, pinching, or brushing against another personâs body.\n\nÂ Â Â (C)Â Â Â Employeeâs responsibility. If you feel you are the subject of harassment, you may want to first advise the offending person that the behavior is unwanted. If you and the offending person are unable to satisfactorily resolve the situation, or if you feel that discussing the behavior with the offending person will present a physical danger or undue suffering, you should notify a member of management as soon as possible. This immediacy will allow for swift investigation, action, and resolution. If for any reason you are unable to inform a member of management, you may also discuss the issue with Human Resources.\n\nÂ Â Â (D)Â Â Â Investigation process.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If you bring forth a harassment complaint, you should be as specific as possible about the conditions and information surrounding the issue. We will treat every complaint of harassment seriously and will investigate each incident. We will make all due effort to maintain confidentiality and the dignity of all parties involved. As we work to resolve the issue, you are also responsible for maintaining the dignity and privacy of the offending person.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If an investigation confirms that a violation has occurred, we will take corrective action. This may include disciplinary action against the offending person, up to and including immediate termination, as determined to be appropriate.\n\nÂ Â Â (E)Â Â Â Retaliation. The cityâs policy prohibits retaliation against any employee by another employee or by the city itself for using this complaint procedure in good faith or for filing, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in any investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by a federal or state enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation includes, but is not limited to, demotion, suspension, failure to make employment recommendations impartially, adversely affecting working conditions, or otherwise denying any employment benefit. If you feel you are a victim of retaliation, you should notify Human Resources immediately."
