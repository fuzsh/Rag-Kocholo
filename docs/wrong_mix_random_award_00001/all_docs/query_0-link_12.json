Historians generally regard two significant dates, 1815 and 1914, as its beginning and end. It began not with Napoleon's victories, but with his defeat. The significant event of 1815 was the convening of diplomats in Vienna to restore peace after a quarter century of revolution and war. The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had shattered the framework of the old regime, and the diplomats met at the Congress of Vienna to structure another. For all of Napoleon's fame and glory, he had a less-lasting influence upon history than two much less famous gentlemen, Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria and Lord Castlereagh of Great Britain, who in Vienna laid the foundations for a cenin Europe. The Congress had 1814, but was interrupted in February 1815 by news of Napoleon's escape from Elba and his triumphal march to Paris.

For a century there were no very long wars to impede the remarkable social and industrial progress that changed the face of Europe and indeed the face of the world. The steady progress since 1500 of European science, technology and commerce reached its culmination in the 19th century. With the energies of the Continent harnessed in constructive pursuits, each generation saw an increase in wealth, technology and productivity and improvements in health and sanitation, education and literacy. Most remarkable was the growth of population. It is estimated that in 1815 there were about 200 million people in Europe, or one-fifth of the world's total. In 1914 there were 460 million, or one-fourth of the world's total, not taking into account the 40 million who emigrated overseas and for\n\ntheir love of the old regime,\n\nall\n\nwhose descendants\n\n1914 had multiplied to 200 million.
