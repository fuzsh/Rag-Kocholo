        "text": "Research Your Destination\n\nVisit our Traveler’s Checklist. Review the country information page for your destination(s). These pages contain information specific to LGBTQI+ travelers. Check for this in the “Local Laws & Special Circumstances” section.\n\nInformation for Travelers with an X Gender Marker on their passport\n\nU.S. citizens can select an X as their gender marker on their U.S. passport application. Information about X gender marker passports and changing your U.S. passport to an X gender marker can be found here.\n\nAlthough the U.S. government issues passports with the X gender marker, it cannot guarantee your entry or transit through other countries. Some countries do not recognize the X gender marker. In these countries, you may face entry restrictions. Check with the foreign embassy or consulate in the United States before you travel.\n\nPack Important Documents\n\nBring copies of important documents. This is especially helpful in countries whose laws differ from those in the United States.\n\nLegal and health documents such as a living will or health care directive.\n\nParentage and/or custody documents for accompanying minor children. This is especially important if your children do not share your last name. It is also especially important if only one parent is traveling with the children.\n\nContact information for your family and/or attorney in the United States. This includes someone who has a copy of your itinerary.\n\nAddress and phone number of the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Have it in English and the local language.\n\nConsider Buying Insurance\n\nTravel insurance can help you during emergencies. It can also help if you need medical evacuation. Some insurance companies have products specifically for LGBTQI+ travelers. Check that any insurance you buy will cover all family members who travel.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program\n\nThe Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) is a free service. It is for U.S. citizens traveling to or living in a foreign country.\n\nWe encourage all travelers to enroll in STEP.\n\nEnter information about your upcoming time abroad. This lets us send you current Travel Advisories and Alerts.\n\nIn case of emergency, include an email address or phone number where we can reach you when traveling.\n\nNote: More technological updates are needed for the X gender marker option to be available in STEP. But gender is not a required field on the enrollment form. We will continue the process of updating our systems to include the X gender marker. We appreciate your patience as we do this.\n\nHere are some pointers for staying safe while abroad:\n\nRemember, you are subject to the laws of the country where you travel. In some countries, same-sex marriage and consensual same-sex relations are illegal. Some countries also ban public gatherings of or in support of LGBTQI+ communities. They may also ban sharing pro-LGBTQI+ material. For more details, read the country information page for your destination. See the “Local Laws & Special Circumstances” section.\n\nWatch out for entrapment campaigns. Police in some countries watch websites and apps. They may also watch meeting places. Be careful about connecting with locals.\n\nBe wary of new-found “friends.” Criminals may target or attempt to extort foreigners who are perceived to be LGBTQI+.\n\nSome resorts or neighborhoods are welcoming to LGBTQI+ travelers. The broader community might have different attitudes. Be aware: attitudes in nearby areas may be much less accepting. Be aware when planning excursions outside of the resort or area.\n\nIn particular, LGBTQI+ youth might, in some countries, be subjected to dangerous practices like so-called “conversion therapy practices.” The use of so-called “Conversion Therapy Practices” can be common in certain countries abroad.\n\nThe term “Conversion Therapy Practices” includes discredited efforts to suppress or change an individual’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression that research indicates can cause significant harm, including higher rates of suicide-related thoughts, and behaviors by LGBTQI+ youth and young adults. Please review the United Nations Human Rights Report for more information on this issue.\n\nFor information on conversion therapy practices in specific countries, please review the Human Rights report or country information page for that location.\n\nLiving Abroad with your Foreign National Spouse or Partner\n\nCheck the website of the foreign embassy or consulate in the United States. You can find out there whether same-sex relationships are legal. You can also find out about any special documentation required. This includes work authorization or a residence visa.\n\nIf You Need Help, Contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate\n\nThe nearest U.S. embassy or consulate may be able to help if you have problems overseas. This is especially true if you feel you cannot approach local police. Or, if you have already had difficulties with them.\n\nConsular officers will protect your privacy. They will not make generalizations. They will not make assumptions or pass judgment.\n\nTell them about any poor treatment or harassment you have experienced.\n\nIf the police arrest you, immediately request them to notify the U.S. Embassy."
