        "text": "Food insecurity is an official term from the USDA. It's when people don't have enough to eat and don't know where their next meal will come from. It's a big problem in the United States, where over 44 million people, including 13 million children, experience food insecurity annually. However, many more people, including millions who do not meet the definition of food insecureâ€”turn to the charitable food sector for support. Learn more about how Feeding America measures hunger in America.\n\nPoverty, unemployment and low wages lead to food insecurity. It's why Feeding America helps people experiencing food insecurity get the food and resources they need by increasing access to food in their communities. We also work locally and nationally to expand economic opportunities. Get the facts on hunger and poverty."
