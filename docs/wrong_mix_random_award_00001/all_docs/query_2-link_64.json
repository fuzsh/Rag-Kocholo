        "text": "I started at the southern trailhead parking lot (junction of 35 & 931) and rode to Peru and back, so I am only reviewing the southern half of the trail (which seems to be the nicest section according to other reviews I've read). This is a great trail to ride if you want to get away from people and noise and civilization for a while. The trail will take you through farmland and woods, surrounded by a wall of green and a canopy of shade. Many times I just stopped and enjoyed the peace and quiet ... no noise except for the birds, cicadas, and even an occasional rooster off in the distance.\n\nI rode for 25 minutes without passing another biker on the trail. Such a peaceful ride! There are a number of streets to cross, but since you are out in the country, there are rarely any cars.\n\nAs many others have mentioned, bring some snacks and plenty of water, as there are no places to stop on the southern half until to you get to Peru. You will pass through a few tiny unincorporated towns that have nothing to offer the thirsty of hungry biker. Also, you may want to douse yourself with bug spray as I was getting pelted in the head with bugs at certain times.\n\nNote: at the southern terminus, they have extended the path to take you into Kokomo, which is good because I was extremely hungry at that time and was able to enjoy the best Reuben sandwich I've ever had at a great Irish pub named Cook McDoogal's.\n\nNeed to de-stress? Ride the Nickel Plate!\n\nI rode this trail in July of 2017. I went from Rochester to Kokomo, got food, and rode back up to my car in Rochester.\n\nSurface - all asphalt, and in good condition when I rode it. Did it on a road bike with 23mm tires and had no issues - held a great pace and didn't get shook up.\n\nScenery - Relaxing, but nothing to write home about for the most part. Corn Belt views. However, there are some cool river crossings, and the descents into Peru from either direction were scenic and interesting.\n\nAmenities - This trail passes through a good amount of towns. I never felt worried about my water access.\n\nNotes:\n\n- Biking to food on the Kokomo end is a bit of a haul. Not as bad in Rochester. But, there was a Hardee's there, so it was 100% worth it.\n\n- Loved the southbound climb out of Peru. Stream crossings, curves, the bridge over the Wabash...highlight section of the ride.\n\n- There's a road crossing every mile for most of the ride. Not busy roads, but it can be a bit annoying.\n\nWe rode our tandem with another couple on singles today from Kokomo to Rochester and back. What a great experience! This is an outstanding trail with lots to offer in terms of scenery, solitude, very good pavement, and plenty of open space. It is also a very well-maintained trail--a storm came through last night with high winds, resulting in a few downed limbs and many walnuts strewn on the pavement. By the time we passed back through these areas late in the afternoon, someone had taken care of almost all of it! There was a tree across the trail at one point; another trail user told us she had contacted someone about getting it takne care of; that was around 10:30 and by the time we passed by on our way back south you'd have never known the tree was ever there. You can tell people care about this trail and it's one we very highly recommend!\n\nWe like to tent camp off our bikes, so sometimes this involves being stealth and staying where there is no official campground. We often stay along the trail or behind public parks. Rarely does anyone know we are there for a night. We are always trying to find places to stop at…for about any reason.\n\nSo this review might best serve others who may want to do this also and I will offer information that previous reviews did not.\n\nOct. 6th ..started at Rochester trail-head (41.055279, -86.201704) …safe overnight parking…port-potti..no water. Come prepared.\n\n1st stop...11 miles..town of Macy..they did have a nice restroom but it was closed because of vandalism …still offered free air for your tires and a pop machine..just go west from the trail and left on Columbia St\n\n2nd stop ..15 miles…town of Deedsville…closed post office with a bench..great place to take a break and just look around. Nothing open anymore…just nostalgia\n\n3rd stop..18 miles…town of Denver…the Denver Tavern…$1 draft beer and good food specials….see https://www.facebook.com/TheDenverTavern/\n\nAlso a convenience store w/sandwiches….and an ice cream/food stand by the ball park\n\nEnd of trail at Lovers Lane.. 22 miles…\n\nNext is my favorite route thru Peru on city streets and back to the bike trail on south side of Peru… where you can pickup the trail as it crosses the Wabash river.. there has not been much traffic on these streets when I have ridden them.\n\nturn left at Lover’s Lane (end of trail), take the first right, which is Denver Pike/CR 30E, going under US 24, it curves to the left and becomes Harrison St…. continue on Harrison to Water St. and turn right. ….take Water St. till it dead ends at Canal St (1 mile)…take a right at Canal St. …follow this until you cross Broadway St…from there you can get onto the Peru River walk (parallels Canal St.)…there is restrooms and water along this scenic trail..its also lighted at night…follow the Peru River walk till it ends..then turn right thru a stone parking lot back to Canal St…to 2nd St…2nd will go into West Side Park…ride across the park to the opposite side and you pick up a very short unpaved trail …it take a one minute ride from the park and it drops you on the trail at the bridge across the Wabash River. I find this is the most scenic and safest route. It’s easier then maybe my directions would suggest.\n\nCamping…we camp just to the left side of the bike bridge. You will find paths leading down to the river. It would appear all the land down there is flooded at times. So if there has been flood conditions lately..this may not work, but we have not had problems yet.\n\nWe set our tent up and then ride to Boondocks for dinner and cruise downtown to visit a few other places. The ride back at night is easy and the town seemed safe as any.\n\nHope this helps someone who is liked minded.\n\nResources:\n\nhttp://www.nickelplatetrail.org/map/ to print a mileage chart\n\nhttp://www.nickelplatetrail.org/parking/ to find parking and restrooms\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheDenverTavern/ check on specials\n\nBest Place to eat…Boondocks (280 E Canal St, Peru)…New Orleans themed bar/restaurant..outside patio...consider the Gator Bait flatbread…garlic or bbq for $10 …feeds 2 people….delicious! great bottle beer selection $4…or $2 Budlight drafts…music some nights…many great reviews\n\nThe Miami County Museum is located at 51 North Broadway Peru, Indiana 46970. free or suggested $3 admission (765) 473-9183 Interesting stop.\n\n40.742772, -86.094767 camping spots along the river\n\nI currently live in Indianapolis, but I lived in Kokomo for about 22 years of my life. I've known about the Nickel Plate Trail for years, and have wanted to ride it, but never had the chance till one day last year when I had an odd day off from work.\n\nNormally I mountain bike ride, but used a road bike for this occasion. I drove up from Indy and parked at the Cassville trailhead. Once underway, I began enjoying the rolling terrain of north central Indiana, where I spent my formative adult years. South of Peru is especially nice, with great cover from the summer sun. The trail even passed by the historic Bunker Hill dragstrip, where my dad used to take me to watch his friends race in the mid-70s.\n\nI had no issues navigating in Peru to get to the trailhead at Lover's Lane, and picked up the trail again. The trail surface was a bit rough from tree roots pushing up under the path at first, but it subsided after about a mile. Once I got outside of Peru, the canopy went away, and was exposed to the blazing sun for quite a distance. I passed through several small towns on the way to Rochester, and had a chance to stop for a quick break to give my backside some relief. The only real drawback I saw was that the trail did run close enough to US 31 south of Rochester to see and hear traffic noise, but that was just a minor irritation.\n\nOnce in Rochester, I rode up to the downtown area to find a convenience store to use the bathroom and lay in supplies for the return trip. On the way back toward Peru going south, I was astounded to see a doe and fawn alongside the trail in an adjoining homeowner's yard! I stopped to get a picture, but they wandered off before I could snap the pic. Ugh. Anyway I began to get leg weary and a bit overheated on the way back in, then caught some relief once the tree cover began again north of Peru. As one other commenter said, you can definitely tell where the grade rises and falls oh-so gradually!\n\nSoon, I was back at the Cassville trailhead, relieved I was done and very saddle-sore. My bike computer had the trip at just under 80 miles, which counted the extra mileage puttering around Rochester looking for a convenience store. Not really sure of the time, but it was somewhere in the five hour range. All in all, a great ride!\n\nMy next trip will incorporate one pass of the Nickel Plate from Kokomo up to Rochester, then west to Winamac and pick up the Panhandle Parkway south to Logansport, then over to Peru and back to Kokomo.\n\nThis trail is the perfect length for a long day trip or an overnight two day trip, with options to shorten it with lunch at any one of several towns along the way before turning back. We did the whole thing in two days from Rochester to Kokomo and back, staying in Kokomo overnight. From Rochester Trail Head to the Fairfield Inn in Kokomo it's 46 miles. The trail north of Bunker Hill is the most scenic and Peru is a great little town with plenty of eateries. There is a nice trailhead in Rochester and we felt comfortable leaving our car overnight there. The trail is well maintained, is mostly flat, but you do go down into and back out of the Wabash River Valley. It's not bad, but you know when your going downhill gradually and then up hill gradually. The only little irritation on the trail was all the road crossing which necessitated stopping often. I guess that can be good or bad depending if you want to stay in high gear and roll. We were loaded down with packs for our overnight so didn't mind slowing for crossings. We saw lots of wildlife along the trail and the pork producers and doing well in the northern half based on the aromas. At the south end there is also a nice trailhead just north of the transmission plant. From there is a short jaunt across 931 and down a side road the the Kokomo Industrial Heritage Trail that runs all the way thru Kokomo to the circle of hotels on the south side. The Heritage trail has a couple places you have to get on streets to naviagte around parts not paved, but it was easy to do and the streets were very lite traffic.\n\nAs a fan of railroad history and rail trails, I always love biking on these ghost rails. The Nickel Plate route in its heyday spanned from Indianapolis to Michigan City, IN. This was part of the same railroad that the ITM hosts State Fair trains from Noblesville to Indy. Currently that rail heads up to Tipton before it becomes abandoned; from that point to Kokomo the route is presently abandoned rail.\n\nOne recent Saturday I came up from Indianapolis, about a 45 minute drive. I began my bike ride on the south trailhead, which is on the north edge of Kokomo at the intersection of US-31 and Howard County Road 400 North/SR 931/US-35. Here is a large parking lot and two portable toilets (but bring your own hand sanitizer and water). Trail use on this particular day was very light with only one or two other cars parked at the trailhead. The trail briefly jogs over to SR 931 at a signalized crossing and then back over to the original railbed.\n\nThe trail goes under the new US 31 lanes, through the small village of Cassville, then cuts through some fields and is mostly lined by trees. There are a few county road crossings with light traffic. There is an intermediate trailhead located in Bennetts Switch which is near US 31 & SR 18, but there is no bathroom or water there either. After you get to Bunker Hill you will cross a ghost railroad junction on the north side of downtown, then the terrain starts to have more trees, streams, and creeks and is a lush green canopy of forest.\n\nAfter arriving in Peru you will cross over the Wabash River on the trestle rail bridge from the 1950's. At this point you will have some fast food places and small restaurants to replenish fluids and get a snack. The trail goes on for about a half mile until coming to a dead end; you can continue onto an alleyway until coming into town and navigating side streets. If you follow the existing railroad tracks you will come to the Peru NS yard and possibly see some freight train movement. Continue back toward the northwest part of town near the intersection of Meridian Road & Lovers Lane where the trail resumes.\n\nThe trail continues to be a lush green canopy and thins out passing more fields toward Denver and Rochester. There are a couple places and shops in Denver to take a break or refill your water. I'd encourage buying a snack or drink or something from these places to support the businesses and the small towns that host this trail.\n\nI didn't make it all the way to Rochester on my first trip, so I turned back to Kokomo after refueling in Denver. On this 56-mile roundtrip ride I encountered less than 15 other people on the trail between Kokomo and Denver. Overall, a very peaceful place to ride your bike or take a relaxing walk. Hope you enjoy the Nickel Plate Trail as much as I did!\n\nI've done the Northern run from Lovers Lane (just off hiway 24) Peru to Rochester twice (OK one and three quarter times). Bucking head winds in the open country portion of the ride I turned around at mile 15 of a 22 mile run on my second attempt.\n\nThe ride beings at Lovers Lane with a nice hill and continues on a bit of incline much of the way to Rochester (or at least it seemed so at the time). The ride back was noticably easier. The first part of the ride is tree lined which provides a nice wind break if it's 'one of those days'. When you hit the open country there's a noticable difference.\n\nAt the end of the ride there's a gazebo and a porta-potty. More comfort facilities would be nice however we crountry kids know that tress and corn fields are God's porta-potties so it's no big deal.\n\nThe scenery along the way with trees, wooden bridges and farm houses is Indiana at its best.\n\nA great ride with very little traffic and few roads to cross.\n\nThis is a well maintained peaceful trail through North Central Indiana. I ran a 20 miler here on a Monday afternoon starting at the Northern most point in Rochester off Wabash Avenue. There is a nice big parking lot here connected to the start of the trial.\n\nI didn't see a single soul on the trail going 10 miles South. It was just me, the cows, and some sheep. I was happy to see a bluejay, which I don't see too often. I saw a handful of people on my return back North especially the closer I got to Rochester (it was later in the day and people probably just got off work). Lots of farmland and some nice bridges across streams and creeks. Plenty of benches too if you need to sit. I was sad when I had to turn around to go back North, I was enjoying my run so much. I'll look forward to coming back next time to see more of the trial. Also, this trail is nice and flat!\n\nAreas of improvement. Lack of designated parking spots. The Wabash Ave parking lot in Rochester was the only obvious marked parking place I saw on the Northern 10 miles of this trial. I did see a designated grass parking area somewhere in the middle along my way, but I couldn't tell you how to get to it or if it was even connected to any road. I have no idea how anyone in a car would find it unless you knew about it. If there were other places to park, I didn't notice them. Also, I only saw one porta potty/rest area, and that was at the very start of the trail in the Rochester parking lot. I really appreciate the length of this trial, but as a female distance runner, port-potties are pretty important. I was lucky this time. Just those 2 improvements and this would be a five star trial easily.\n\nStarted from the Southern Mile 13.7, I believe. I biked across a really nice route. The trail was clean and well-marked and I could just cruise! Because I had just quite smoking, it was nice to just zone out, until stop signs came. A fair bit of traffic, about a person every mile. Easily navigated.\n\nI read some people declaring this one big hill. I thought it was a perfect flat ride with a couple dinkers. Really nice bridges. The south Wabash Bridge is really cool. It was interesting to see the retrofitting of it. Looks like they kept the tracks to act as \"longitudinal reinforcement\" of the concrete.\n\nI got a bit lost when looking for the northern portion. Granted, I didn't look at the map very well and I had no service in Peru (Verizon). So I just rode around town, saw some nice stores.\n\nOn my way back, it was 630pm, I was tired, but enthusiastic. I saw many species of bird: finch, blue jay, woodpecker (technically heard him). About 5 woodchucks dive-bombed me over about 6 miles. One played varsity ball, apparently, because he went straight for my ankles. It was an experience. I'll be going back for the northern route!\n\nWe parked at the trailhead at Lover's Lane and biked toward Rochester. As noted there are no restrooms and no water on the trail so come prepared. The trail starts out with a 2 mile easy grade climb. You seem to be climbing up a ridge. This is the \"steepest\" of the climbs although it is an easy grade. The best part is when you head back from Rochester you know the last 2 miles will be your best downhill. The rest of the ride is very gradual descents- barely noticeable, and some gradual climbs to Rochester. The first 10 miles are mostly protected from the wind and you get a nice shaded pathway. The trail is in good shape,very smooth. There are a few spots, well marked, closer to Rochester where the pavement has cracked and is sunken, possibly due to heavy rain.The last approximate 10 miles are more open farm fields. We biked out and back on our Mt. bikes in a little over 3 hours. We stopped for munchies a few times but did not go into any towns. The trail back to Peru is more uphill and we hit a 20-30 mile headwind which made it a bit more challenging. However, once you get within 10 miles of Peru you do get more shelter from the wind for most of the ride. We saw a huge snapping turtle on the side of the path, a snake and various birds. Very few people. 2 walkers and 3 bikers. One apparently didn't realize you need to callout \"on your left\" or some type of warning and almost caused a crash. Please remember to use this required courtesy. It saves a lot of grief. Especially on a trail that is not busy - no one expects you or hears you coming and even when staying in your own lane there are always branches to dodge etc.. At the Rochester end there was a sign that says \"trail end\" but we noticed another asphalt stretch continuing so it looks as if they have made good progress. This is a very clean trail - no litter and I hope everyone helps it stay that way. There was a section with a bunch of emerald green flies all over it for quite a way - the breeze was a blessing as it kept them from landing and biting - it also encouraged me to pick up my pace! I might pack some bug spray next trip. It is a lot nicer than our Monon in Carmel if you are looking for a quiet peaceful uncrowded ride to stretch out a bit. Enjoy!\n\nThis trail is nice and long. Almost 40 miles long! Typically I ride the trail from Peru to Miami and back (20 mi, round trip) and it is smooth and a great endurance builder for biking. You will have to stop at roads (cross traffic does not stop, but there isn't much traffic) when you go through different towns, but it's not a problem. This section of the trail is mostly shady, giving great protection from sun. There are a few small parking areas along the way and there are safety signs at every crossing. Peru even built a crosswalk for the trail so that bikers/joggers/walkers could get through town safely. The grade changes are barely perceptible in this section and the views are wonderful. You'll go over bridges, above the fields and through them. It's quite a sight! This trail does not feature any bathrooms, however it does go through towns with gas stations if you really need one. Recently someone built an enclosed vending machine snack/drink stand (with picnic table) about a mile from the Walick Rd parking lot. There are plenty of rest benches along the trail, most of them are shaded by trees and donated by local organizations and youth service projects. I love this trail and bike it 4 times a week. It provides exercise and free fun for families and teenagers in the cities and towns along the trail.\n\nThe Nickel Plate Trail is currently under active construction, so beware that any information is only accurate for the date it was written. We rode it in its entirety early November of 2011. We enjoyed it a lot, particularly since the fall leaves at this time were still colorful. While there are many exposed sections, much of it does have trees on one or both sides of the trail. It has a lot of very nice bridges, and the trail is well-maintained. The path is totally paved from the parking at Wallick Road in Peru to the town of Cassville. As of November 2011, the trail offers many rest areas with a bench and trail map sign, and occasionally a picnic table, but it does not have any trail-provided water sources or restrooms. However, there are mini marts or gas stations at or near Bunker Hill, Bennetts Switch, and Cassville. These can be located on Google Maps. We ate lunch at the gas station in Cassville (on Highway 31), which offered very friendly service, a wide variety of hot food, drinks, snacks, and also had indoor tables.\n\nI checked to see if each of the parking areas designated on the maps from nickelplatetrail.org did exist, and they indeed did, although occasionally it seemed they might have been a bit difficult to find in a car with just the maps provided, without better detail or verbal instructions. Each of these can be located on Google Maps, as it shows the intersection of each street name with the Nickel Plate corridor. Note also that many of the parking areas were very small, including the one on Wallick Road, and could potentially fill quickly on weekends with good weather.\n\nOne of the trail maps on nickelplatetrail.org could imply that the trail continues through the city of Peru. This part is still under active construction, and an alternate map on that site does provide a street alternative. However, note that as of November 2011, the mile and a half from the city of Peru north to the Lovers Lane Parking is a narrow dirt path on the old rail corridor with a lot of natural debris such as branches, briars, sticks, etc. in the path. There is also one creek crossing that involves negotiating a short but extremely steep path.\n\nMy family was pleased to discover this well-maintained, picturesque trail so close to our home near Indianapolis. Just an hour's drive north put us in beautiful farm country, with most of the trail wooded to provide respite from the summer sun. On a Friday afternoon, we started from Cassville trailhead, which was a little tricky to find, and worked our way to just south of Bunker Hill before our six year old's legs gave out. We returned Sunday to the Peru trailhead, only to find no parking. So we back-tracked to the Bunker Hill parking lot and then continued where he had left off. Facilities are not abundant, with no water that we could find and only an occasional, foul-smelling \"port-a-potty.\" So have little ones (and big people) \"go\" before you start! Traffic was much less than encountered on our local Monon Trail, allowing our six year old to wander more freely and at her own pace. Other users included pedestrians walking their dogs, a couple \"intense\" bicyclists, but mostly locals enjoying a beautiful summer afternoon on their bicycles. We will definitely return!"
