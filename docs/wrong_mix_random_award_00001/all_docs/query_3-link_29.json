        "text": "The Challenge\n\nThere is significant government and philanthropic investment in a number of communities experiencing disadvantage across Australia, yet positive changes have often been limited. Recent events, including widespread drought, bushfires and the global coronavirus pandemic, have presented additional challenges for communities.\n\nMost experts agree that no single policy, government department, organisation or program can solve the complex problems facing most children and families living in communities where disadvantage is concentrated. Ongoing engagement with a community to assess its strengths, needs and existing investment is required to make informed decisions that are driven by the community. This approach can allow real change to be enacted.\n\nThe Response: working in partnership, working differently\n\nStronger Places, Stronger People is a community-led, collective impact initiative, stewarded by the Australian Government in partnership with state and territory governments and 10 communities across Australia. It seeks to disrupt disadvantage and create better futures for children and their families through locally tailored and evidence-driven solutions to local problems, in partnership with local people.\n\nA unique feature of collective impact is the shared commitment to a local strategy by communities, governments, service providers and investors, with shared accountability for planning, decision making and results.\n\nThe Australian Government committed up to $35 million to the first 5 year phase of the Stronger Places, Stronger People initiative until 30 June 2024. A further $64 million has been committed over 6 years to 30 June 2029 to extend and enhance the existing partnerships under the initiative. There is also significant investment from state and territory governments and in some cases philanthropic organisations.\n\nStronger Places, Stronger People Communities\n\nStronger Places, Stronger People has commenced in 10 communities. These include: Logan, Rockhampton and Gladstone in Queensland; Bourke and the Macleay Valley (including Kempsey) in New South Wales; Mildura in Victoria; Burnie in Tasmania; the Far West Region of South Australia (including Ceduna); and the Barkly Region (including Tennant Creek) and Gove Peninsula in the Northern Territory.\n\nSeveral factors are considered when selecting partner communities, including:\n\nmarkers of disadvantage\n\nexisting community collaboration\n\nstrong local leadership\n\nestablished local governance structures\n\na promising degree of readiness to work differently\n\nan existing collective impact practice is preferred\n\na level of social cohesion and\n\na shared vision for change.\n\nSupporting Stronger Places, Stronger People communities\n\nStronger Places, Stronger People communities receive funding to support a local project team (‘backbone team’) in each community. The backbone team facilitates local planning, inclusive engagement, measurement and evaluation, joint decision-making, governance and local action. The backbone team works with, and is accountable to, a local community leadership group, supporting the community in developing and implementing their tailored strategy and plan of action.\n\nCommunities also receive funding for capacity building support, which is provided to enable local backbone teams to develop the skills and expertise necessary to implement community action plans.\n\nCommunities participate in a Partnership Exploration Process, which is designed to develop a shared understanding of collective impact practice in the community, plan for the year ahead and confirm the commitment from all partners.\n\nNational Leadership Group\n\nThe Stronger Places, Stronger People National Leadership Group was established in 2019. The National Leadership Group was convened to drive and shape the strategy and approach to implementing the initiative."
