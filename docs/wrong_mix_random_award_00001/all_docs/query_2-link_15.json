        "text": "Needing a cool treat this summer in the Peru area? Go where the locals go, East End Double Dip, you wont be disappointed! I love ice cream and am always on the look out to try new places so when I came across this place, I jumped at the chance to try something new! There are so many options to choose from, I had a hard time deciding, Ill have to go back when Im not as full from lunch!\n\nThey are really known for their fountain drinks as well as their ice cream treats, especially their Lifesaver Sprite. Its a sprite with pineapple, cherry, orange, raspberry and watermelon flavoring, YUM! This visit though, I was intrigued by the Beagle Parfait and just had to know what it was. The person working that day described it as\n\nvanilla soft serve with layers of peanut butter sauce, hot fudge and topped with more peanut butter sauce and nuts. Well, I love peanut butter, chocolate and nuts so this was a no brainer! Man, it was delicious! My mouth is watering now just thinking about it and I can taste the creamy and slightly sweet peanut butter sauce. It was very rich and unfortunately I wasnt able to finish it all because I was so full from lunch but I sure tried! I would go back just for that! Im very excited to try some of their other items as well such as the buckeye bash ice cream (peanut butter and chocolate again!), blueberry cheesecake ice cream and their variety of Hurricane flavors. Is it time for a break yet? I think I need some ice cream!\n\nEast End Double Dip also has a pizza side, which Im told is great as well but that part is only open in the evenings starting at 3pm. Ice Cream is served starting at 11am. They have great outdoor seating if you are visiting on a nice day too! Come prepared though, it is a cash only business. Check it out the next time you are near by, they are located at 451 Main Street, Peru, IN."
