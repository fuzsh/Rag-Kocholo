        "text": "Online Scheduling\n\nLutheran Health Network provides free, convenient, online self-scheduling and telehealth for patients in Indiana. This service allows patients to check-in for estimated treatment times at our convenient care centers or book appointments for healthcare services.\n\nChoose your care type to get started:\n\nEmergency Care\n\nRediMed\n\nMedStat\n\nPrimary Care\n\nTelehealth\n\nEmergency Care\n\nFind projected treatment times for emergency departments. Instead of sitting in the waiting room, enjoy the convenience and comfort of waiting at home. Once you arrive at your designated time, you will be promptly seen by a healthcare professional. This service does not allow patients to skip in front of other visitors; all patients are seen based on the hospital's standard triage and queuing process. Online check-in should not be used for emergencies.\n\nUrgent Care & Walk-In Clinics\n\nMany commonly treated conditions can be managed well through a virtual interaction with the provider, while others require a physical examination. Urgent care patients can choose telehealth (video call) or in-office visits for allergies, ear pain, stomach \"bugs,\" rashes and more. Select the urgent care clinic of your choice below to get in line, online for your virtual or in-person visit.\n\nUrgent care clinics are there for life's little illnesses and injuries, as well as sports, school and camp physicals. We also offer onsite X-rays and lab draws.\n\nIf you have COVID-19 symptoms, which may include fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; fatigue; muscle or body aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; or diarrhea, please let us know right away. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, dial 911.\n\nRediMed\n\nAt RediMed, our urgent care clinics, physical therapy and business health services, all fall under the RediMed umbrella, creating \"one-stop shopping\" for your medical needs. Your convenience is a priority, and we'll have you in and out of one of these convenient locations, and on your way to recovery as quickly as possible. Learn more about RediMed.\n\nMedStat\n\nMedStat Urgent Care is a walk-in clinic used to treat patients with illnesses or injuries. MedStat is staffed with board-certified physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners experienced in urgent care and occupational health. Convenient hours and caring staff make MedStat the primary choice for those who have an untimely illness or injury. Learn more about MedStat Urgent Care.\n\nVisit our convenient location in Warsaw. No appointment necessary.\n\nPrimary Care\n\nAppointments are available for a number of primary care providers.\n\nSchedule Online\n\nTelehealth\n\nMany providers offer virtual telehealth visits.

To search by participating providers, click here.\n\nMore Information\n\nHear from Family Medicine Physician Anna Menze, D.O., on how to make the most of your telehealth visit.\n\nWhat is telehealth?\n\nTelehealth simply means a doctor visit on the phone or via video using a smartphone or computer. You will be able to talk with your provider from the comfort of your home or other location just as you would in the doctor’s office.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nLutheran Health Physicians staff will provide instructions about your telehealth visit when you schedule the appointment. Visits begin by clicking a link sent by email from the practice. You will not need to download an app.\n\nHow do I make a telehealth appointment?\n\nCall your provider and ask if your appointment can be done by phone or video. Some appointments require a physical examination in order for the doctor to meet the standard of care and make fully informed decisions. But many appointments can be managed well through virtual interaction. These may include certain visits for:\n\nMinor illnesses such as colds and allergies\n\nMinor injuries such as sprains\n\nFollow-up care\n\nMedication management\n\nChronic disease management\n\nBack pain\n\nOther specialty care\n\nAre telehealth visits covered by insurance?\n\nMany insurance plans cover telehealth visits. Video visits are typically required, although some payers will cover visits by phone only. Check your plan coverage or ask when you make an appointment.\n\nCan I have a telehealth visit with a doctor I’ve never seen before?\n\nYes. Telehealth visits through our medical group are for both new and existing patients.\n\nCan I have a telehealth visit with any physician in the group?\n\nMany of the providers offer telehealth. Call to confirm if virtual visits are available with your selected provider.\n\nLooking for a provider? Need to find a phone number?\n\nFind your provider here or call Lutheran Health Physicians at (833) 546-4968."
