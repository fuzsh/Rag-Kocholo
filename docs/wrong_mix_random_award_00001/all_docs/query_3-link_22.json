        "text": "Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Are a Group of Manufactured Chemicals\n\nPFAS are a group of manufactured chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s because of their useful properties. There are thousands of different PFAS, some of which have been more widely used and studied than others.\n\nPerfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS), for example, are two of the most widely used and studied chemicals in the PFAS group. PFOA and PFOS have been replaced in the United States with other PFAS in recent years.\n\nOne common characteristic of concern of PFAS is that many break down very slowly and can build up in people, animals, and the environment over time.\n\nPFAS Can Be Found in Many Places\n\nPFAS can be present in our water, soil, air, and food as well as in materials found in our homes or workplaces, including:\n\nDrinking water – in public drinking water systems and private drinking water wells.\n\nSoil and water at or near waste sites - at landfills, disposal sites, and hazardous waste sites such as those that fall under the federal Superfund and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act programs.\n\nFire extinguishing foam - in aqueous film-forming foams (or AFFFs) used to extinguish flammable liquid-based fires. Such foams are used in training and emergency response events at airports, shipyards, military bases, firefighting training facilities, chemical plants, and refineries.\n\nManufacturing or chemical production facilities that produce or use PFAS – for example at chrome plating, electronics, and certain textile and paper manufacturers.\n\nFood – for example in fish caught from water contaminated by PFAS and dairy products from livestock exposed to PFAS.\n\nFood packaging – for example in grease-resistant paper, fast food containers/wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, pizza boxes, and candy wrappers.\n\nHousehold products and dust – for example in stain and water-repellent used on carpets, upholstery, clothing, and other fabrics; cleaning products; non-stick cookware; paints, varnishes, and sealants.\n\nPersonal care products – for example in certain shampoo, dental floss, and cosmetics.\n\nBiosolids – for example fertilizer from wastewater treatment plants that is used on agricultural lands can affect ground and surface water and animals that graze on the land.\n\nPeople Can Be Exposed to PFAS in a Variety of Ways\n\nDue to their widespread production and use, as well as their ability to move and persist in the environment, surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that most people in the United States have been exposed to some PFAS. Most known exposures are relatively low, but some can be high, particularly when people are exposed to a concentrated source over long periods of time. Some PFAS chemicals can accumulate in the body over time.\n\nCurrent research has shown that people can be exposed to PFAS by:\n\nWorking in occupations such as firefighting or chemicals manufacturing and processing.\n\nDrinking water contaminated with PFAS.\n\nEating certain foods that may contain PFAS, including fish.\n\nSwallowing contaminated soil or dust.\n\nBreathing air containing PFAS.\n\nUsing products made with PFAS or that are packaged in materials containing PFAS.\n\nExposure to PFAS May be Harmful to Human Health\n\nCurrent scientific research suggests that exposure to certain PFAS may lead to adverse health outcomes. However, research is still ongoing to determine how different levels of exposure to different PFAS can lead to a variety of health effects. Research is also underway to better understand the health effects associated with low levels of exposure to PFAS over long periods of time, especially in children.\n\nWhat We Know about Health Effects\n\nCurrent peer-reviewed scientific studies have shown that exposure to certain levels of PFAS may lead to:\n\nReproductive effects such as decreased fertility or increased high blood pressure in pregnant women.\n\nDevelopmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations, or behavioral changes.\n\nIncreased risk of some cancers, including prostate, kidney, and testicular cancers.\n\nReduced ability of the body’s immune system to fight infections, including reduced vaccine response.\n\nInterference with the body’s natural hormones.\n\nIncreased cholesterol levels and/or risk of obesity.\n\nAdditional Health Effects are Difficult to Determine\n\nScientists at EPA, in other federal agencies, and in academia and industry are continuing to conduct and review the growing body of research about PFAS. However, health effects associated with exposure to PFAS are difficult to specify for many reasons, such as:\n\nThere are thousands of PFAS with potentially varying effects and toxicity levels, yet most studies focus on a limited number of better known PFAS compounds.\n\nPeople can be exposed to PFAS in different ways and at different stages of their life.\n\nThe types and uses of PFAS change over time, which makes it challenging to track and assess how exposure to these chemicals occurs and how they will affect human health.\n\nCertain Adults and Children May Have Higher Exposure to PFAS\n\nAdults\n\nSome people have higher exposures to PFAS than others because of their occupations or where they live. For example:\n\nIndustrial workers who are involved in making or processing PFAS or PFAS-containing materials, or people who live or recreate near PFAS-producing facilities, may have greater exposure to PFAS.\n\nPregnant and lactating women tend to drink more water per pound of body weight than the average person and as a result they may have higher PFAS exposure compared to other people if it is present in their drinking water.\n\nChildren\n\nBecause children are still developing, they may be more sensitive to the harmful effects of chemicals such as PFAS. They can also be exposed more than adults because:\n\nChildren drink more water, eat more food, and breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, which can increase their exposure to PFAS.\n\nYoung children crawl on floors and put things in their mouths which leads to a higher risk of exposure to PFAS in carpets, household dust, toys, and cleaning products.\n\nBreast milk from mothers with PFAS in their blood and formula made with water containing PFAS can expose infants to PFAS, and it may also be possible for children to be exposed in utero during pregnancy. Scientists continue to do research in this area. Based on current science, the benefits of breastfeeding appear to outweigh the risks for infants exposed to PFAS in breast milk. To weigh the risks and benefits of breastfeeding, mothers should contact their doctors.\n\nWhere to Go for the Latest Information on PFAS\n\nFederal Government Resources\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)\n\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nUnited States Department of Defense (DOD)\n\nUnited States Navy\n\nUnited States Air Force, Civil Engineering Center\n\nState Government Resources\n\nAssociation of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA)\n\nInterstate Technology and Regulatory Council (ITRC)\n\nEnvironmental Council of the States (ECOS)\n\nEnvironmental Research Institute of the States (ERIS)\n\nInformation on How to Provide Input on Proposed Government Actions\n\nFederal agencies are required to provide an opportunity for public comment when proposing a new regulation and must consider the comments in revising the proposal and issuing a final rule. In carrying out our mission to protect human health and the environment, EPA develops regulations to prevent or to clean up hazardous chemicals released into our air, land, and water, some of which relate to PFAS.\n\nCommenting on a proposed regulation is an important opportunity to make your voice heard. It is a way for you to provide decisionmakers with key information on any or all aspects of the proposed action, including:\n\nPointing out key issues in the proposed regulation that you or your community are concerned about,\n\nOffering additional data and scientific evidence that may not have been considered,\n\nIdentifying factual errors, and\n\nProposing alternative solutions.\n\nEPA’s regulations will always be announced in the Federal Register and can be found at the following government websites: https://www.federalregister.gov/, and https://www.regulations.gov/.\n\nFor some rules, EPA holds a public hearing where you can provide comments in person or remotely. The agency always accepts comments in writing. All comments – whether in person or written – get the same level of consideration. Below are additional resources to help you comment on EPA’s proposed regulations related to PFAS."
