        "text": "American Red Cross CPR classes in Indiana can give you the skills you need to help adults, and children during medical, breathing and cardiac emergencies. Available online, in person and via our blended Simulation Learning experience, it's easy to find first aid and CPR training in Indiana that suits your schedule and your learning style.\n\nIn Indiana, CPR classes are available in person, online, and via our blended Simulation Learning experience, which combines online coursework with in-person skills sessions. Although successful completion of any of our CPR classes results in a two-year certification, online-only courses do not allow you to demonstrate your skills to a certified instructor, and therefore may not meet the requirements for workplace safety certification.\n\nBefore, during and after your CPR training in Indiana, we offer online, anytime access to a wide range of training resources and manuals that can help you better understand the processes for administering care. From quizzes and games that test your skills to step-by-step instructions that you can print and refer to at any time, we offer a variety of fun, easy ways to keep your skills sharp and your memory fresh.\n\nAfter successfully completing your CPR training in Indiana your certification will be good for two years. In order to help you maintain your certification, we offer abbreviated CPR and first aid renewal classes not only allow you to stay up to date on the latest techniques, but once complete they allow you to extend your certification by two additional years.\n\nKeeping your students safe is everyone's job. That's why we offer first aid and CPR classes in Indiana that are designed specifically for schools. Our program allows educators, administrators and other staff members to become instructors who can then deliver training to students and faculty. This way, you can easily build a campus community that's prepared to help during times of need.\n\nAt the American Red Cross we offer CPR classes training in Indiana, but our expertise goes far beyond its borders. In fact, we operate in every state and are part of a humanitarian network that responds to emergencies and provides training in more than 180 countries worldwide. In addition, in order to ensure that our health and safety class materials are based on the latest and best in emergency science, our trainings are developed by experts in the field and reviewed by the Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council."
