        "text": "The Food Bank of Northwest Indiana’s Mobile Market is available to all Northwest Indiana residents in need of food assistance. Each Market will provide FREE grains, fruits, vegetables and protein to individuals and families. Mobile Market travels to a different community each week, distributing healthy food to communities across the Region. Often, the Food Bank partners with community organizations to supply additional services and resources.\n\nIndividuals should have a valid proof of Indiana residency to access Market services and are asked to bring boxes or bags to carry items. All Food Bank of Northwest Indiana distributions are first-come, first-served while supplies last.\n\nUntil further notice, all Mobile Market food distributions will be drive-through only at each of the scheduled sites. Please do not arrive more than 30 minutes prior to the scheduled distribution time. We appreciate your patience as we work to ensure that everyone who needs food assistance receives it.\n\nClick to download the July Mobile Market Schedule\n\nClick to download the July Mobile Market Schedule in Spanish"
