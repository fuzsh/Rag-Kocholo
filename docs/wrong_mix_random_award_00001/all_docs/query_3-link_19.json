        "text": "When hearing about hepatitis A, many people think about contaminated food and water. However, in the United States, hepatitis A is more commonly spread from person to person. Since March 2017, CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) has been assisting multiple state and local health departments with hepatitis A outbreaks, spread through person-to-person contact.\n\nThe hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection\n\nThe following groups are at highest risk for acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection in these outbreaks and should be offered the hepatitis A vaccine in order to prevent or control an outbreak:\n\nPeople who use drugs (injection or non-injection)\n\nPeople experiencing unstable housing or homelessness\n\nMen who have sex with men (MSM)\n\nPeople who are currently or were recently incarcerated\n\nPeople with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C\n\nOne dose of single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine has been shown to control outbreaks of hepatitis A.1,2\n\nPre-vaccination serologic testing is not required to administer hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccinations should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained or records are unavailable.\n\nCDC has provided outbreak-specific considerations for hepatitis A vaccine administration and has updated its overall recommendations on the prevention of hepatitis A virus infection in the United States.\n\nCDC’s Response\n\nIn response to all hepatitis outbreaks, CDC provides ongoing epidemiology and laboratory support as well as support on vaccine supply and vaccine policy development. When requested, CDC sends “disease detectives” to affected areas to evaluate and assist in an outbreak response. CDC alerts other public health jurisdictions of any increases in disease. All jurisdictions are encouraged to be watchful for increases in hepatitis A cases. CDC also works with state and local health officials to ensure hepatitis A vaccine is targeted to the correct at-risk populations and that supply is adequate.\n\nPostexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the last 2 weeks; those with evidence of previous vaccination do not require PEP.\n\nPEP consists of:\n\nHepatitis A vaccine for people aged ≥12 months\n\nHepatitis A virus-specific immunoglobulin (IG) for specific populations\n\nPEP Recommendations:\n\nACIP Recommendations for Use of Hepatitis A Vaccine for Postexposure Prophylaxis and for Preexposure Prophylaxis for International Travel\n\nSupplement 1. Provider Guidance on Risk Assessment and Clinical Decision-making for Hepatitis A Postexposure Prophylaxis\n\nNOTE: CDC recommends that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis A at age 1 year. Parents or caregivers who are unsure if a child has been vaccinated should consult the child’s health-care provider to confirm vaccination status.\n\nEducational Resources\n\nCDC is developing educational materials to support the outbreak at the state and local levels. Most materials include an area where local information can be inserted. Your organization’s contact information can be typed into the blue colored rectangle.
