        "text": "It is not clear what the intellectual history of the last 200 years would have looked like without the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel, but it is clear that it would have looked different. His vast intellectual system was taken up by thinkers from left to right, and from very different philosophical schools. This volume brings together accessible, concise essays from leading scholars that present important currents of Hegelian thought in different European countries, including pre-revolutionary Russia, from the 19th to the 21st century. It unites a range of very different forms of (Non-Marxian) Hegelianisms and Anti-Hegelianisms, showing similarities as well as differences. Embedding them in their cultural and intellectual contexts, it demonstrates the various encounters between philosophy, politics and personal lives that Hegel's philosophy inspired.\n\nHegel famously argues that the speculative method that grounds his claims about socio-political reality is the inevitable and superior alternative to all other ways of philosophical thinking. It is only in the light of this method and the system it begets that Hegel's claims about socio-political reality can be rationally evaluated. Does this open him to the charge of dogmatism? Are his claims about the rationality of monarchy, unequal gender relations, an unelected second parliamentary chamber and a corporation-based economy beyond revision? If not, does his political philosophy collapse into relativism? Since Hegel's method is supposed to save him from either extreme, is there anything about his criticism of previous philosophies that could make his approach attractive to contemporary thinkers? Or is it preferable to focus on Hegel's conclusions only, disregard his method and interpret him non-systematically? This collection of new essays is dedicated to the questions that surround Hegel's philosophical method and its relationship to the conclusions of his political philosophy. It contributes to the ongoing debate about the importance of a systematic context for political philosophy, the relationship between theoretical and practical philosophy, it engages with contemporary discussions about the shape of a rational social order and gauges the timeliness of Hegel's way of thinking.\n\nThe philosophical system of Hegel greatly affected theoreticians representing various trends in reflection on politics. Some thinkers regarded him as a predecessor of the future proletarian revolution, others as a reactionary and ideologist of authoritarian governments. He was perceived as a liberal thinker, a conservative, and even a founding father of totalitarianism. It is difficult, however, to find an author who would associate Hegel’s thoughts with the republican tradition. The author of this article tries to pursue this task. At first sight, Hegel does not offer any analysis of the republic. His main topic is the state, understood very broadly as a political unity and totality – as a living ethical community. Attempts at including Hegel in the classical republican tradition require strong arguments. The first hint is the presence and outstanding importance of Aristotle and Kant in his works. These two names cannot be omitted in republican thought.\n\nThis paper suggests that Hegel's Philosophy of History provides a comparative analysis of the critical junctures that redefined state-society relations in Western Europe. The paper seeks to clarify Hegel's causal claims about periods of sudden and dramatic change in European history, and then to test the validity of these claims with evidence accumulated since he wrote. By doing so, we attempt to provide a broader historical perspective on democratization that may help develop sorely needed concepts, theories, and methods for analysis of the sudden and dramatic changes of our fin-de-siecle. The cold war is over. The sheer number and non-violence of recent transitions from authoritarian rule have been remarkable. The working assumption of this paper is that new perspectives on democracy and change are needed and that there is no better place to look for new ideas than classic work. This paper uses the concept of critical junctures to capture the unique causal status of the sudden and dramatic political changes that periodically recast state-society relations. Social structures, economic trends, cultural attributes, and institutional inertia do not determine the resolution of conflicts during critical junctures. Instead, the causal process remains open and contingent on a series of eminently political factors such as pacts, negotiations, and written and/or symbolic acts that legitimize subsequent political order and routine. In this respect, history turns on a series of political moments. Critical junctures suddenly recast state-society relations and determine the subsequent path of cultural, economic, and social developments. We claim that Hegel's Philosophy of History is an analysis of how Western European state-society relations were recast in a sequence of such critical junctures or political moments. From his perspective, the most important critical junctures were the organization of democracy in ancient Greece, the emergence of Christianity under the Roman Empire, the statecraft of Charlemagne (and religious reforms of Pope Gregory VII) that produced medieval orders, Protestant reformation that solidified the early modern European state system, and the French revolution that defined popular representative government in nineteenth century Europe. This list of critical junctures is neither definitive for Europe nor a substitute for analysis of the historical trajectories of other regions."
