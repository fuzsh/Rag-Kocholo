Indiana Jones has been entertaining audiences for four decades, and the fifth movie is keeping up the tradition.

In the past, Indiana Jones has worked toward stopping the Nazis in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," found himself on a dangerous adventure in India in "Temple of Doom," working against the Nazis to find the Holy Grail in "Last Crusade," and racing against the Soviets in search for a hidden artifact with his long-lost son in Peru in "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."

The newest movie, "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," follows the famous architect on a journey with his goddaughter, Helena Shaw, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, on their way to find a dial that is said to hold the powers of changing history.

Here is where some of the franchise's biggest stars are today.

HARRISON FORD SURPRISES ‘STAR WARS’ FANS WITH SNEAK PEEK OF ‘INDIANA JONES 5’

Harrison Ford

Harrison Ford has played the titular character, Indiana Jones, in all five movies in the franchise, with "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" set to be his last time putting on that famous fedora.

The 80-year-old recently got emotional when discussing this chapter of his life closing, and he explained why his character, Indy, and the franchise are adored by fans worldwide.

"I think the thing that I most admire about them is the depth and subtlety of the emotion and the importance of emotion in these films," Ford said during a BBC Radio 1 interview.

"As this last one concerns age and frailty and changing nature of life, it was especially compelling to me because I am of that age, and I wanted it to feel real for the audience. I wanted them to see the complexity of that experience with someone they’ve spent 40 years with."
