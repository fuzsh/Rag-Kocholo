The H platform, or H-body, name has been used twice by General Motors. The 1970s H-body was an inexpensive rear wheel drive compact automobile platform from the 1970s. The 1980s H-body was a front wheel drive full-size car platform.

The 1970s H-bodies had 4, 6, and 8-cylinder longitudinal GM engines, a solid rear axle, and had a unibody construction. The Chevrolet Vega was designed to use a small-block V8, but this was not approved. The Chevrolet Monza was originally designed to use a Wankel engine but this project was cancelled. No H-body had 4 doors, though wagon versions were offered. The fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number for an H-body car is "H". The platform was introduced with the 1971 Chevrolet Vega and replaced by the GM J platform in 1981.

Many vehicles used this platform including the following cars:

1971-1977 Chevrolet Vega/Pontiac Astre

1975-1980 Chevrolet Monza/Buick Skyhawk/Oldsmobile Starfire/Pontiac Sunbird
