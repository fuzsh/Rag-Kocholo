        "text": "I've been a big car enthusiast pretty much since I was born, so I wanted to do a car-centric alternate timeline. Since endless pages have been shed over GM's implosion, I thought I'd prevent that, by stopping all the stupid mistakes that cost them their market share.\n\n1968:\n\nJanuary 10 was a cold day in Detroit. GM Chairman Jim Roche was sitting in yet another board meeting. For 3 years now, he had been the top brass at the world's largest company, employing more people, earning more revenue, and paying more taxes than any other private entity. Some said he was more powerful than any man in America not named Lyndon Johnson. His tenure was a somewhat rocky one. In 1966 he was forced to issue a public apology for attempts to smear activist Ralph Nader, Ford's Mustang was flying out of the showroom and it took GM 3 full years to properly respond with the Camaro/Firebird twins, Washington was breathing down his neck on safety, smog, and antitrust concerns, and the sales of imports kept growing, the unstoppable Beetle being joined by Datsuns and Toyotas from Japan. On the other hand, the company was still going strong and was in no danger of losing its top position, having manufactured its 100 millionth car in 1967. Roche also committed himself to Equal Employment Opportunity initiatives.\n\nThis meeting would concern GM's new planned subcompact, smaller than even the Nova, to go on sale in 1970. Executive Vice President Ed Cole had put forward a proposal for a radical design including a die cast aluminum engine block.\n\nRoche stated his opposition to this design strongly:\n\n\"I look at this design and I worry this will be the Corvair disaster all over again. Even before Nader came along we learned the problems of a radical new small car design, Falcon outsold us 2-1 and was able to use standard parts. I think a much better proposition would be slapping a Chevy badge on one of our overseas subcompacts such as the upcoming Opel Ascona. The Opel has already sold well through Buick dealers so it's proven to be successful. By sharing resources with the West German division, we can reduce our costs and because it'll offer a sedan model, it'll have a wider appeal. We should not be taking unecessary risks\"\n\nSo it was decided, GM's new subcompact was to be an Americanized version of the Opel Ascona. The Chevrolet Vega, as it would be called, would use softer suspension and be built in the US but would share much with its West German cousin.\n\nEd Cole was bitter about this but ultimately did not interfere with the project after becoming Chairman that year.\n\nChevrolet's Nova was redesigned with a larger body.\n\nGM's Intermediates, Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac Tempest, Buick Skylark, and Oldsmobile Cutlass were all new for 1968.\n\nThe famous Corvette entered its 3rd Generation with aggressive coke bottle styling.\n\nOpel got its own miniature version of the Corvette in the form of the GT.\n\nBravo for the effort.\n\nIf you can pull it off...\n\nOne question: why not reuse the Corvair platform? The Vega need not have used an aluminum block, or go without rustproofing; the \"build to a price\" problem could be ignored, with sufficient reason (or head office clout).\n\nAlso, what happens to the Opel GT? Offered as a *Vega? (And Astre, Skyhawk, &/or Starfire...?)\n\nNot doing it that way makes me wonder if Grumpy's Toy X turns out to be a Pinto, instead.\n\nA. Even before Unsafe at Any Speed people were not fond of the rear engined Corvair, the Ford Falcon easily outsold it, forcing GM to bring out the more conventional Nova\n\nB. The Corvair was a size class above the Vega.\n\nAs for the Opel GT, it's sold through Buick dealers as IOTL. It would definitely not be offered as a Chevy, they already had 1 fiberglass 2 seater and didn't need another.\n\n1969 was a quiet year for GM, the only new model being the Pontiac Grand Prix. Based on a stretched Le Mans chassis and with a unique beak-like front end, it was very successful and would help define the growing Personal Luxury Car segment.\n\n1969 was also the end for the Chevrolet Corvair. Launched in 1960, it was part of the first wave of new compacts meant to beat back the VW Beetle. The car sold poorly as buyers were scared off by its rear engine layout and things got a lot worse in 1965 when an attorney named Ralph Nader released his book Unsafe at Any Speed, which claimed the Corvair was unsafe due to GM's cost cutting. The company infamously tried to have prostitutes seduce Mr. Nader in an attempt at blackmail. This, along with the introduction of the Ford Mustang, doomed the Corvair from being in any way successful. Ironically, an NHTSA study in 1972 would find the Corvair to be no more dangerous than other compact cars of the period.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Vega and its twin the Pontiac Astre was undergoing extensive development in anticipation for the launch next year. In addition, GM's Lordstown Assembly in Ohio had a new highly automated line added to produce the new subcompact.\n\nAs America turned to a new decade, they were introduced to a new field: the subcompact car.\n\nThe first entry into this field, and the only one available in Model Year 1970 was American Motors with the Gremlin. Essentially a Hornet with the back chopped off, it sold fairly well but was criticized for its odd proportions.\n\nIn September, Ford unveiled their Pinto. Offered with 2 doors only and with rack and pinion steering, it was a modern and state of the art offering.\n\nGM unveiled their offering that would tower above all the rest, the Vega. It offered a 4 door model and a spacious cabin. It was essentially a mini-Impala. Automotive journalists could not stop gushing over it, and it looked like it would be a huge hit.\n\nBut then, disaster, in September the United Autoworkers went on strike. The 2 month walk out brought General Motors to a halt and was only ended in with an agreement for a nearly 20% wage increase.\n\nThe 1970 model year brought out 2 notable new cars for GM. First was a redesign of the Camaro/Firebird, the new European bodylines were an instant success and helped take the fight to the Mustang juggernaut.\n\nAlso new was Chevrolet's Monte Carlo, a stylish rebody of the intermediate Chevelle, it brought personal luxury to the blue collar level and was a massive hit.\n\nLegislation pertaining to GM's future was passed. California Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Environmental Quality Act, imposing the nation's strictest environmental protection laws. In Washington, the Environmental Protection Agency was created. Controlling smog emissions would be a key issue for GM through the decade.\n\nFor 1971, all eyes were on GM's new subcompact. There was great anxiety about whether this new tiny car would be a success. Once sales figures came in, all fears were allayed. 400,000 Vegas were sold, to Pinto's 220,000. And thanks to low development costs, the car was profitable. Reviews of the car were universally positive. The car was praised for the spaciousness and European handling crispness while the Pinto was panned for being cramped and impractical for families. GM had correctly deduced that Americans wanted a big car in a small package. Ford was left scrambling.\n\nWhile GM had brought out its smallest car, it redesigned its bread and butter big cars. From Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac, the new cars were bigger than ever and used the distinctive \"fuselage\" shape.\n\nIn an attempt to overtake Ford in the full sized wagon market, GM introduced the disappearing clamshell tailgate which disappeared under the cargo floor. The problem was that people's hands could get caught.\n\nGM's front drive full sized coupes, the Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Toronado were also redesigned and got larger, gaining 6 inches in wheel base. The Cadillac offered a mammoth 500 cubic inch (8.2 liters) V8, their biggest ever.\n\nThe Buick Riviera got redesigned with the famous \"boattail\" look.\n\nAlso for 1971, all engine compression ratios were lowered to allow for the use of unleaded gasoline."
