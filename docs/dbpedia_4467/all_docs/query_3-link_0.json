        "text": "Small cars have always fascinated me. Cars with names like Vega, Fiesta, B210 and Escort were the things of childhood dreams. This was in part because I imagined them as affordable first car candidates in adulthood. I also learned to appreciate the concept of doing more with less, because once again I anticipated budget restraints. The American Big Three must have felt the same way in trying to cater to small car buyers when they awkwardly rolled out what amounted to small versions of their bigger cars. Most small cars in the ’70s were crap by today’s standards, but the Japanese makers seemed to learn their lessons the quickest, while the Americans were offering more substantial products initially. The tables would turn due to the Big Three’s pride, protective politics and downright stubbornness.\n\nThe Vega/Astre is just one story of a would be king of the small car that just wasn’t meant to be. Built in Quebec, the Astre started out as a Canadian market exclusive for two model years before being rolled out to America (by which time it underwent a small facelift). You could call the Astre a Canadian import despite also being built in Ohio and California.\n\nAlthough GM’s H-platform cars (Vega/Astre) get a bad rap today, they were actually good cars for its time – at least on paper. In fact, for not much more than the cost of a cramped VW Beatle, you could buy a car with a real trunk (or hatchback) with the engine up front powering the wheels in back – just like a real car. As for being sporty, the Vega might have been the best GM could do in America. Oddly enough the Pontiac version was not seen as the sporty one of the pair.\n\nOnly in Canada could you buy a GT version of the Astre initially. It was outfitted very much like the American Chevy Vega equipped with the Sport Package or GT trim. This package (like for the Astre in Canada) was only available for the hatchback coupe and wagon models. There was a Formula package in America with a fancy Trans Am steering wheel and a front and rear spoiler. The most sought after of the Formula cars was a special version offered in 1975 called the ‘Lil Wide Track. It was an attempt to boost poor sales with appearance items of the Formula but with a beefed up suspension and special wire wheels. As attractive as the Li’l Wide Track was, later Formula models would incorporate it’s features (save for the special wheels) and add a modern look blackout trim. Interestingly the bumpers remained chromed. I could never understand why car builders did not paint the bumpers the body color. It would have greatly improved the appearance of any model instantly. The concept of the body colored bumper was alive and well in Endura equipped Pontiacs like the GTO.\n\nPontiac would have to make do with advertising all the usual positive attributes of the H-car like the spacious hatchback, that allowed as much as 19 cubic feet of storage space with the rear bench seat folded down. The other model with fold down rear seats, the wagon offered as much as 50 cubic inches of space. The Astre line offered considerable versatility, attractive looks, and efficiency. The coupe (or Saloon Deluxe in Canada) with it’s proper trunk was somewhat homely looking and was the least expensive entry into the Astre family.\n\nThe Astra initially used the Dura 140, a 2.3-liter four cylinder that came in single barrel carburetor trim. The aluminum-block engine shared with the Vega made 75 hp. The Canadian GT offered a overhead cam, two-barrel version of the same engine with 10 more horsepower. These engines carried over to the U.S. when the Astre made its debut for the 1975 model year. A 3-speed auto and 4-speed manual transmission were the standard norm for all Vega/Astra until 1977 when a 5-speed manual was added to the options list (for a total of three transmission options). For it’s final year, the Astre would use 2.5 liter Iron Duke engine – a motor that would find its way into everything from the upcoming Sunbird to the base 3rd gen Firebird.\n\nLike the Vega, the Astra could be had with a five-speed manual transmission by the end of its tenure. That alone was impressive considering that the new upstart and eventual replacement for the Astre, the Sunbird touted the same transmission as one of its more advanced sporting credentials. Also like the Vega, the Astra came in hatchback coupe, proper 2 door sedan and odd 2 door wagon. A panel van version would be added as the efficiency of the Astra made it popular with small businesses.\n\nDesigned primarily for Chevrolet, one suspects that Pontiac got in on the design late in the game (seems to be a pattern by now), by which point all it could do is offer slight alterations on the Chevy theme. In this respect, the Astra struggled to find it’s visual identity until two or so model years in. That distinction was small but significant once the vertically slanted grill appeared. If the Vega looked like a little Camaro in the front, the Astra was becoming vaguely Grand-Am like. To make matters worse for the Astre, it would be sold alongside the newer Sunbird, as the entry level Pontiac.\n\nPontiac would never push Astra’s design to be anything more than a clone of the Vega. Despite that, both Chevy and Pontiac’s designs had a vented trunk in the two-door sedan which was interesting considering the front engine rear wheel drive configuration.\n\nThe Astra did not sell anywhere near as well as the Vega. To add further insult to Pontiac’s sporting image, it would be the Vega that would get the Cosworth treatment. Had Cosworth worked with Pontiac, it would have had a small car that fit the performance image already cultivated by the Trans-Am and (at the time) had not been completely erased by the GTO. Sporty or not, some aspects of the Astre line almost made it into the ’80s in the form of the wagon which was rebadged as a Sunbird (with a Sunbird-like face grafted on). Of course the wagon stood out in the Sunbird line as none of it’s lines related to the new style car. When the Sunbird wagon was dropped for the 1980 model year, at that point all instances of the old Astre/Vega died with it.\n\nHistory would see the Astre differently – if at all. Some people never realized that Pontiac even had a Vega clone. Like its T1000 in the ’80s, Pontiac had established with the Astre that its small car efforts were doomed to live in the shadow of a Chevy."
