        "text": "The H platform, or H-body, name has been used twice by General Motors. The 1970s H-body was an inexpensive rear wheel drive compact automobile platform from the 1970s. The 1980s H-body was a front wheel drive full-size car platform.\n\nContents\n\n1.1 External link\n\nRWD\n\nThe 1970s H-bodies had 4, 6, and 8-cylinder longitudinal GM engines, a solid rear axle, and had a unibody construction. The Chevrolet Vega was designed to use a small-block V8, but this was not approved. The Chevrolet Monza was originally designed to use a Wankel engine but this project was cancelled. No H-body had 4 doors, though wagon versions were offered. The fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number for an H-body car is \"H\". The platform was introduced with the 1971 Chevrolet Vega and replaced by the GM J platform in 1981.\n\nMany vehicles used this platform including the following cars:\n\n1971-1977 Chevrolet Vega/Pontiac Astre\n\n1975-1980 Chevrolet Monza/Buick Skyhawk/Oldsmobile Starfire/Pontiac Sunbird\n\nExternal link\n\nH-Body.Org (http://www.h-body.org)\n\nH-Body FAQ (http://h-body.org/library/hbodyfaq/index.html)\n\nBob Gumm's V-8 Monza Site & Message Board (http://www.v8monza.com)\n\nFWD\n\nThe 1980s H-bodies were large front wheel drive cars with a 110.8 in wheelbase. Most H-bodies used GM's large 3800 V6, and supercharged versions were introduced later.\n\nThe following vehicles used this platform:\n\nYears Wheelbase Model Previous platform Next platform 1986-1999110.8 inBuick LeSabreGM B platformGM G platform 1986-1988110.8 inDelta 88GM B platformRetired 1992-1996110.8 inOldsmobile 88 RoyaleRetired 1989-1999110.8 inOldsmobile 88Retired 1996-1999110.8 inOldsmobile LSSRetired 1997-1998110.8 inOldsmobile RegencyRetired 1987-1999110.8 inPontiac BonnevilleGM G platformGM G platform\n\nSee also"
