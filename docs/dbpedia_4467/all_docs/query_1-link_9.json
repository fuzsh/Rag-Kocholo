        "text": "The General Motors H platform or H-body is an automobile platform designation used for the 1971–1980 model year rear wheel drive line of subcompact cars. The fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for an H-body car is \"H\".\n\nH-bodies were available as two-door notchback, hatchback, station wagon, and sedan delivery body-styles, and have 4, 6, and 8-cylinder GM engines, a solid rear axle, and unibody construction. The platform was introduced with the 1971 Chevrolet Vega. The Pontiac Astre, Chevrolet Monza, Buick Skyhawk, and Oldsmobile Starfire were introduced for the 1975 model year. The Pontiac Sunbird was introduced a year later as a 1976 model. In 1973-'74 the Pontiac Astre was sold in Canada.\n\nThe Vega engine is a 140 CID aluminum-block L4. A 1972 GM prototype had an all-aluminum 302 small-block V8 but this was not approved. Chevrolet hand-built 5000 122 CID L4 Cosworth Twin-Cam engines for the 1975 Cosworth Vega but only 3508 1975-76 cars were sold. The remaining engines were scrapped. The GM-rotary Wankel engine was destined for the 1975 Monza 2+2 but the engine was canceled.\n\nThe Vega and the Astre were discontinued at the end of the 1977 model year. The Monza, Sunbird, Skyhawk, and Starfire continued through 1980. The rear-wheel drive (RWD) H-body Monza, Sunbird, Skyhawk, and Starfire were replaced in the spring of 1981 with a new front-wheel drive front-wheel drive (FWD) line-up, the GM J-car models: Chevrolet Cavalier, Oldsmobile Firenza, Buick Skyhawk, and the Pontiac J2000 introduced as 1982 models. Because the forthcoming J-body cars were to be sold as 1982 models, there was a long production run of 1980 H-body models in order to provide sufficient inventory to carry dealers until the spring of 1981.\n\nYears Wheelbase Model Previous platform Next platform 1971–1977 97.0 in (2464 mm) Chevrolet Vega 1973–1977 Pontiac Astre 1975–1980 Chevrolet Monza GM J platform 1976–1980 Pontiac Sunbird GM J platform 1975–1980 Buick Skyhawk GM J platform 1975–1980 Oldsmobile Starfire GM J platform\n\nSee Other"
