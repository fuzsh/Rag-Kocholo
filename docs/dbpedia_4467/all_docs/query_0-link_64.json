What are some of your ideas? \n \nI want to build an 80s to early 90s S10 regular cab short box, 2wd and swap in a supercharged 3800 and a T5. I have always thought it would be fun, could be made fast, get decent mileage, run FOREVER with the 3800. Another thing I have thought is even with a nice exhaust it will sound horrible so I wouldn't have to hide V8 rumble making it a killer sleeper.",
