        "text": "Warren Beatty rushes into the Governor's Suite, breathless, perspiration speckling his brow. He's late, very late, for this afternoon interview, the first of the day. Beatty hasn't permitted print interviews for more than a decade. But here he is, at the Four Seasons Hotel, having raced from his manse atop nearby Mulholland Drive.\n\nDressed in a black shirt, black jacket and black pleated pants, he extends a hand and offers apologies but gives no reason for his delay. Then he starts talking baseball, naming major league teams wintering in Tampa Bay.\n\nHe grins. Common ground has been struck. The seduction begins.\n\nBeatty, the master manipulator, circles the dining room table and plucks a silver platter filled with tea sandwiches. He carries it to the couch, eager to talk, eager to sell Dick Tracy, the $25-million movie he produced, directed and stars in, opening today at theaters nationwide.\n\nWhy has Beatty begun courting the press?\n\nBecause Warren Beatty is worried. He's frightened that, like Burt Reynolds, he is falling from superstar status.\n\nBeatty won't admit this. He says, \"Some pictures do well. Some don't. If Dick Tracy doesn't do well, I'll go make another movie.\"\n\nThis is true. But at the rate Beatty makes movies, he doesn't have many left. Aside from Dick Tracy, Beatty has made only two movies during the past decade and only 17 since he launched his career in 1961 with Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass.\n\nHis most recent opus, 1987's Ishtar, was a $40-million boondoggle on the order of Heaven's Gate. His 1981 release Reds was an outstanding portrait of American communist Jack Reed, but it did little business at the box office and barely turned a profit on its $33-million investment.\n\nBeatty, once ranked among the most bankable actors in Hollywood, has slowly been slipping into obscurity. To a new generation of filmgoers, he is no more recognizable than, say, Charles Grodin.\n\nMore critical, he is 53 and beginning to look it. Crows'-feet creep from the corners of his hazel eyes. Lines crease formerly taut cheeks.\n\nBeatty, nevertheless, is devastatingly handsome. A teen-ager might say he looks as if he were Rob Lowe's father. And he could have been, had Lowe's mother been one of his leading ladies.\n\nBeatty's on- and off-screen lovers have included Ishtar's Isabelle Adjani, Reds' Diane Keaton and Shampoo's Julie Christie. Joan Collins, Michelle Phillips, Leslie Caron, Natalie Wood and Liv Ullmann have also been associated with Beatty, the most renowned Hollywood Romeo since Errol Flynn.\n\nMadonna was Beatty's latest leading lady lover. She plays nightclub chanteuse Breathless Mahoney in Dick Tracy. She is, arguably, a bigger pop icon than Beatty, although her skills as an actress have yet to be honed.\n\nBeatty's voice softens when he talks about Madonna, recalling the first time they met:\n\n\"Um, Madonna, um, I found when I met her that I had trouble sitting down. I had to stand and walk around. She made me laugh. She was entertaining.\"\n\nBeatty pauses, as he often does, to collect his thoughts.\n\n\"She's gifted in every area, I think. She's not afraid of being bigger than life,\" he says of his co-star, whom he lit like an angel in Dick Tracy.\n\nBeatty decided to make Dick Tracy because, as a child, Chester Gould's Crime Stopper comics were his favorite.\n\n\"I liked Superman and kind of liked Batman. But it was hard for me to identify with guys wearing capes,\" he says. \"Tracy was perfect. Wooden, perhaps, but solid.\"\n\nTo make Dick Tracy, Beatty put his pet project _ the life story of Howard Hughes _ on hold. For the past 15 years, he has been planning to write, produce and direct the movie and star as the legendary power broker.\n\n\"I'll still do the Howard Hughes picture. I just got caught up in this concept of making Tracy and being 7 years old again,\" Beatty says as he peels slices of turkey from the tea sandwiches and dips them in mustard.\n\nWas this a bid for commerciality?\n\n\"Well, I think Dick Tracy certainly does interest people more than a communist who died and was buried in the Kremlin wall,\" Beatty says, referring to Jack Reed of Reds.\n\n\"But I think it was the fun about Tracy that led me to do it. Dick Tracy is one of our great cultural characters.\"\n\nBeatty pauses once more, brushes the crumbs off his shirt, and waxes with mock sincerity: \"Tracy is an admirable man. A good man. An honest man. A solid man.\" He smiles a broad, warm, friendly smile.\n\nThis is not how Warren Beatty is supposed to act. He is reportedly uneasy with the press, communicating ideas in jumbled, incomprehensible fragments.\n\nHis recent meeting with Barbara Walters was a disaster. The only sentiment they seemed to share was how poorly the interview was faring.\n\nYet, last week he seemed completely at ease talking about the media's portrayal of his image, the failure of Ishtar and the making of Dick Tracy. He said he strived to direct a picture that \"abandoned most of the rules of movie making . . . so that everyone was working without a net.\"\n\nBeatty finishes the last of the tea sandwiches or, at least, the meat. He stacks the bread in two piles, one for wheat, the other for white. He slides back on the sofa and discusses the technical aspects of Dick Tracy.\n\nBeatty's goal was to be totally faithful to Gould's comic strip. Every building and car is painted with the primary colors printed in newspapers. Actors playing villains are hidden beneath grotesque latex masks that fit their namesakes: Flattop, Pruneface, Little Face and Lips Manlis.\n\n\"The project gave me a chance to go into a simpler world that dealt with primary colors and primary emotions,\" Beatty says. \"Good was good. Bad was bad. I enjoyed that.\"\n\nBeatty is known as a perfectionist. He shoots scenes dozens of times to get exactly what he wants. Conversely, the current regime at Walt Disney is known for cutting corners to trim budgets.\n\nBeatty denies reports that he signed a contract with Disney requiring him to pay cost overruns from his directorial, acting and producing salaries. He says he agreed to their budget and shot only two days longer than scheduled.\n\n\"The budgetary restrictions, in the long run, might have even helped,\" he says. \"They (Disney) know how to get a bigger bang for your bucks.\"\n\nBeatty says he'd rather not discuss Dick Tracy's finances in the wake of Ishtar, the $40-million comedy that cast him with Dustin Hoffman as third-rate lounge performers embroiled in a Middle Eastern espionage caper. Beatty produced the film, directed by his close friend Elaine May. It was almost universally panned.\n\n\"I think everybody reviewed the budget instead of the movie,\" Beatty says. \"Most reviewers acted oddly, as if they were stockholders in the Coca-Cola company (owners of Columbia Pictures, the film's distributor).\"\n\nBeatty says he and Hoffman asked Columbia to have their $5.5-million salaries deferred until the picture came out. He says Columbia refused because it had a cable deal that paid half the production costs, including his and Hoffman's salaries, providing they were paid up front.\n\n\"They gave us their word they would keep the budget as quiet as possible. Then, they all got fired. A new management came in that saw it fit to publicize, at enormous length, how much money had been wasted. That was David Puttnam,\" Beatty says.\n\nPuttnam's reign at Columbia was exceptionally brief. He was fired after alienating Beatty, Bill Cosby, Ray Stark and other members of Hollywood's power elite by ranting about the cost and poor quality of their projects.\n\n\"What's really amazing is that, to this day, I have never met him,\" Beatty says. \"He was in charge of bringing this picture to the public. And I never received a telephone call, a letter, a telegram, a message. I'm told he has never seen the movie.\"\n\nBeatty laughs at the inanity of the situation. Then he says, \"I'll tell you one thing. Ishtar is a funny little movie. It's a silly movie. . . . It didn't have a chance.\"\n\nIn addition to Ishtar, Beatty has produced and starred in Reds, Heaven Can Wait, Shampoo and Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nReds collected 12 Oscar nominations, making Beatty the only person besides Orson Welles to receive four nominations _ producing, directing, writing, acting _ for a single movie. Beatty won for direction.\n\nHeaven Can Wait (1978), a remake of Here Comes Mr. Jordan, is Beatty's only certifiable hit during the past 15 years. He co-wrote the screenplay with Elaine May and co-directed with Buck Henry.\n\nThe most important films of his early career were Bonnie and Clyde (1967), the saga about a pair of vicious Depression-era bankrobbers, and Shampoo (1975), a satire about the politics of the sexual revolution.\n\nThe success of these movies, along with McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and The Parallax View (1974), gave Beatty the freedom to work when he pleased.\n\nBetween film projects, he often campaigned for Democratic candidates. He was in Bobby Kennedy's inner circle. He stumped for Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern.\n\nHe influenced Gary Hart's decision to re-enter the presidential primary campaign after Hart dropped out because of reports about his involvement with Miami model Donna Rice.\n\n\"I felt if Gary Hart and his family were able to cope with the media, then he should go back in. I didn't feel he should have dropped out to begin with,\" says Beatty, who learned from the Hart debacle that he could never run for office.\n\nBeatty sits up and says it's ridiculous that politicians' private lives cloud campaign issues.\n\n\"It's all part of this crisis we're in, not being able to understand complex issues,\" he says, \"It's hard to get individuals to care about the collapse of the savings and loans or the budget deficit. People just want to know that whoever is in charge doesn't smack his cocker spaniel.\"\n\nBeatty has weathered his share of abuse in the press. Supermarket tabloids keep tabs on his love life. Esquire magazine recently published an article that quoted alleged acquaintances about his sexual prowess. Beatty says it was largely fabricated.\n\n\"It's all out of control,\" he says. \"I don't think people recognize how high the level of bull---- is. And, it's not just entertainment. From economics to politics to the military. The stock market rises and falls on rumors, fabrications and half-truths.\"\n\nHe says he quit doing interviews because they're a tool to sell movies. He thinks movies should succeed or fail on their own.\n\n\"I also understand that if you don't do publicity, the press will make things up,\" he says. \"And nine times out of 10, it's negative if they make it up.\"\n\nDespite this tirade, Beatty is asked how he feels about being a sex symbol.\n\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way,\" he replies. \"I couldn't. Well, I guess I could. I don't.\"\n\nHe pauses and acts flustered, as if this is the first time anyone has broached the subject. \"I guess I mean I'm flattered. I mean, I don't know how to answer that.\"\n\nBeatty, having sidestepped the issue, picks up the silver platter and returns it to the dining room. Then he borrows my pad and jots down his initials and home phone number.\n\n\"Call me if you have any more questions,\" he says, knowing that few stars divulge their private lines to the media.\n\nThat evening, I dial the number Beatty gave me, curious to know if it's really his.\n\n\"Mr. Beatty won't be in until late tonight,\" said the housekeeper. \"He'll call you tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next afternoon, Beatty leaves a message on my answering machine at my home in Florida. The seduction, transacted with seven digits on a piece of paper, is complete."
