        "text": "Â« Shows\n\nSondheim wrote five songs for Warren Beatty's film Dick Tracy, which starred Madonna and Beatty. The film was a stylish romp through Tracyland, and was enhanced immeasurably by Sondheim's songs, which captured the period flavor of the movie perfectly. Beatty had originally asked Sondheim to score the picture in addition to writing the songs, but Sondheim wasn't interested (Danny Elfman eventually handled those chores).\n\nMadonna had written a song called \"Back in Business\" for the montage sequence which followed the incarceration of Dick Tracy (when all the crooks come out and take over the city). However, no one was pleased with it and Beatty, with the pressure of a screening a month away, prevailed on Sondheim to write a new \"Back in Business\". In the song, Sondheim used words like \"bang\" and \"boom\" specifically to punctuate images of explosions and the like, although when the montage was finally edited it didn't exactly conform to his wishes.\n\n\"What Can You Lose?\" is one of Sondheim's most beautiful creations for any medium - a rueful song about unrequited love, which came about because Beatty wanted a song for Mandy Patinkin, and he'd fallen in love with a line of dialogue Mandy had, which became the song's title.\n\n\"More\" is a perfect example of Sondheim's trademark facility with words, and the music is brassy, sassy, and catchy. Listen to the very clever verse and see if you can catch all the quotes Sondheim used from optimistic ongs of the period.\n\n\"Sooner or Later\" is a classic bluesy torch song and it won Sondheim an Academy Award.\n\n- Bruce Kimmel Show Data\n\nOriginal Film Production Info\n\nCast\n\nMusical Numbers\n\nRecordings\n\nAwards\n\nArticles\n\nOriginal Film Production Info:\n\nReleased in USA 1990 Script Jim Cash Jack Epps Jr. Chester Gould Produced by Silver Screen Partners IV Touchstone Pictures Producers Warren Beatty Jon Landau Art Linson Floyd Mutrux Barrie M.
