        "text": "When was the last time you watched Warren Beaty’s 1990 film adaptation of Dick Tracy? A very long time has passed since I last saw the film, and it’s one of those films that’s been on my mind lately. I recently came across a movie poster for the film that I had when I was a kid signed by the artist, and the memories of the film came flooding back. I figured I’d watch the film again, and see if it still holds up with my memory.\n\nI remember the first time watching the film in theaters with my friends. This was a movie that I was extremely excited about seeing when I was a kid. The trailers, poster art, crazy looking villain characters, Madonna, and the noir detective story were all things that drew my attention to the movie. Then I saw the movie, and it did not disappoint, I loved it!\n\nThere was also a line of Dick Tracy action figures that were released following the film’s release, and I remember having many of those.\n\nI don’t remember the last time I watched the movie, but having just watched it again recently I can happily say that the movie still holds up as one of the best comic film adaptations made! For the 90s, this was a freakin’ great comic book movie! It completely nailed the style, tone, and spirt of the comic that it was based on. I was also super impressed with the production design and the makeup effects work that was done for several of the characters, especially the villains.\n\nThe film was doing all of the things that director Robert Rodriguez did in the Sin City films, but this was made long before Sin City and the technology that Rodriguez utilized to bring Sin City to life. Everything we see in Dick Tracy was done in a practical filmmaking manner, and it looks so good! I also can’t help but love how colorful and vibrant the movie was. It’s the most colorful film noir movie ever made!\n\nThe cinematography was stunning, and the movie is filled with really cool shots and visuals that were taken right from the comic art. The script and the story were also fantastically written, and the ensemble cast was impressive as hell. That cast included Beatty, Madonna, Al Pacino, Glenne Headly, Mandy Patinkin, Paul Sorvino, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Dick Van Dyke, Catherine O'Hara, James Caan, Charlie Korsmo, and more. Oh! And, of course, I have to mention the epic musical score created by Danny Elfman! That score was truly inspired.\n\nHard-boiled detective Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) is searching for evidence that proves Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice is the city's most dangerous crime boss. He may have found the key to unraveling the crimelord's illegal empire in Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), an enigmatic barroom singer who has witnessed some of Caprice's crimes firsthand. However, she seems more set on stealing Dick away from his girlfriend, Tess (Glenne Headly), than helping him solve the case of his career.\n\nI don’t know why I haven’t watched this movie in so long, but I’m glad that I finally revisited it. While I loved it as a kid, as an adult I appreciate the film so much more. The fact that this film actually exists is pretty damn awesome. It’s just such a fun film to watch and it was beautifully made.\n\nIf you haven’t seen Dick Tracy, or if it’s been awhile, it’s definitely worth checking out. It’s a movie that will most definitely put a smile on your face."
