        "text": "Amidst a splashy, big-budget adaptation starring Warren Beatty as the square-jawed detective from the comic strips, an Oscar-nominated Pacino, sporting Oscar-winning make-up, outrageously walks the line between cartoon and caricature as mobster Big Boy Caprice. The movie also won Oscars for its production design and its torch song “Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man),” composed by Stephen Sondheim and performed by Madonna in-character as chanteuse Breathless Mahoney."
