        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- It was something of an honor for actor William Forsythe when director Warren Beatty called on him for the role of Flattop in the film 'Dick Tracy.'\n\nAmong Tracy's gang of adversaries, none looms more nefarious and lethal -- and inept, as it turns out -- than Flattop.\n\nFollowers of the old Chester Gould comic strip well remember Flattop for his weird hairdo, pointed chin and freckles. For two years in 1943-44, Flattop menaced the fearless flatfoot at every turn.\n\nFlattop was, arguably, more memorable than the other felonious oddballs who dogged Tracy down through the years in the comic pages: Mumbles, Prune Face, Steve the Tramp, The Brow and Shoulders among many lesser thugs.\n\nThe character became so much a factor in the comic strip that when Gould finally ran out of ideas for further Flattop felonies, the cartoonist killed him off. Tracy was not to meet a worse scoundrel even to this day.\n\nFlowers and notes of condolence were sent to newspapers from readers around the country who bemoaned Flattop's demise.\n\nIt was, therefore, something of a coup to have Beatty call on Forsythe to play Flattop in his 'Dick Tracy' movie. Further, he was the first peformer in the cast to be nailed down for a role. And, at the time, he didn't know Dustin Hoffman would be coming aboard to play Mumbles and Al Pacino would set new standards for comic heavies as Big Boy Caprice.\n\nMoreover, Beatty would cast Mandy Patinkin as 88 Keys and Paul Sorvino as Lips Manlis.\n\nAside from the big-name actors in relatively small roles, Forsythe probably created as much impact as the sleazy, shifty-eyed Flattop.\n\nThere was only one catch. Forsythe had to spend more than three hours in makeup every morning for five and a half months during production. Then another 40 minutes at the end of the day having the makeup removed.\n\n'I put that makeup on and took it off more than 50 times during the course of the picture,' Forsythe said. 'I'd get to the set at 3 or 4 in the morning and I'd still be there to take it off when everyone had gone home.\n\n'The makeup artists applied a dozen different latex prosthetic pieces to my face every day, then cappped it off with that flat wig.'\n\nForsythe knew from the beginning that no one would recognize him under all the latex and the crazy hair piece, so it couldn't help his career or establish more clearly his identity with moviegoers.\n\nForsythe is no newcomer to movies. His credits include 'Weeds,' 'Extreme Prejudice,' 'Raising Arizona,' 'Once Upon a Time in America,' and 'Dead Bang.' So, 'Dick Tracy' could not have appeared to be much of a career vehicle. But it paid well and kept him busy for almost six months.\n\n'My own mother wouldn't have recognized me except maybe for the gap in my teeth and the twinge in my voice,' Forsythe said good-naturedly.\n\n'Actually, Warren wooed me for the role and called me in for a meeting. Two days later he asked me to come back. He is a very thorough filmmaker. After our first meeting he watched all of my film work before offering me the opportunity to play Flattop.\n\n'It was a relatively small role, but I wanted to make the most of it. Once I agreed to do the part I got my hands on every piece of Gould's comic strip I could find involving Flattop. I wanted to find the essence of where Flattop was coming from -- his cunning, his faraway look and his betrayal of everyone.\n\n'Because there were so many characters involved in 'Dick Tracy,' I never had the chance to give Flattop his full range.\n\n'I was always fascinated by what was happening in every scene Flattop was in, so I had him always thinking and plotting on his own. No matter what the other criminals were coming up with, he was double-crossing and conniving throughout the picture.\n\n'I loved the exercise of creating a whole new screen character. I could have played six different characters inside that same makeup, doing a variety of things with my face.\n\n'Working with Hoffman and Pacino was very special. They were my two favorite actors when I was a teenager. I thought they were the best, and I still do.\n\n'As for the arduous makeup every day, I knew what I was getting into. This role was a commitment.\n\n'I loved my part. It is something I will always be proud of. When I saw it in a theater it was a thrill to see the kids eating it up and afterward hearing them talk about Flattop.'"
