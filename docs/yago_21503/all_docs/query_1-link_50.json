        "text": "There's something painful about a movie that fails on an artistic plane as high as the one touched by this film, but uncomplying characters do not a successful film make.\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\nFor all its violence, it remains jolly, its boisterous moral tone softened here and there by moments of cautious sentimentality.\n\nApril 5, 2022\n\nViewed today amid the superhero franchise onslaught, Dick Tracy has a refreshing quality to it. The film dares to have a strong identity, artistic vision and to tell a self-contained story rather than one made to hype sequels, crossovers or sell toys.\n\nMarch 20, 2022\n\nAn exciting and humorous adventure film that appears to be ripped straight out of the pages of a graphic novel.\n\nSeptember 11, 2020\n\nThis is a larger-than-life comic strip come-to-life, and its success comes from Warren Beatty making all the right moves to make the ultimate Dick Tracy movie.\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\nDick Tracy is a painted globe of a movie. Lushly artistic on the surface but resoundingly hollow, it bounces around aimlessly and finally ricochets right off the audience into oblivion, leaving hardly a trace.\n\nMay 20, 2020"
