        "text": "There's something painful about a movie that fails on an artistic plane as high as the one touched by this film, but uncomplying characters do not a successful film make.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | May 9, 2023\n\nViewed today amid the superhero franchise onslaught, Dick Tracy has a refreshing quality to it. The film dares to have a strong identity, artistic vision and to tell a self-contained story rather than one made to hype sequels, crossovers or sell toys.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Mar 20, 2022\n\nAn exciting and humorous adventure film that appears to be ripped straight out of the pages of a graphic novel.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Sep 11, 2020\n\nThis is a larger-than-life comic strip come-to-life, and its success comes from Warren Beatty making all the right moves to make the ultimate Dick Tracy movie.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | May 27, 2020\n\n\"Dick Tracy\" isn't in the top tier of comic-book adaptations, but ingenuous art direction and set decoration and some crazy make-up jobs create a film that's still a delight to watch.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Dec 10, 2012"
