        "text": "Actor Warren Beatty has sued a unit of Tribune over the film and television rights to comic strip detective Dick Tracy, a character he played in a 1990 hit film of the same name.\n\nThe suit was filed in Los Angeles's Federal Court and seeks to prevent Tribune from taking the movie and TV rights away from Beatty. He has held them since 1985.\n\nBeatty used the rights to make Dick Tracy, which earned more than $US160 million ($252 million) at worldwide box offices in 1990.\n\nUnder the original agreement between Beatty and Tribune, the rights would revert to Tribune if \"a certain period of time\" lapsed without Beatty having produced another Dick Tracy movie, TV series or TV special, according to court papers.\n\nThe suit said Tribune sent Beatty a letter on November 17, 2006, that gave him two years to begin production on Dick Tracy programming.\n\nBeatty began a Dick Tracy TV special on November 8 this year, the lawsuit said, and gave Tribune written notice.\n\n\"Tribune responded by asserting that it still had the right to terminate Beatty's Tracy Rights and effect a reversion, and purported to do so,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a declaration that Beatty's work on the Dick Tracy TV special precludes Tribune from taking back the rights to the property.\n\nTribune spokesman Gary Weitman declined to comment on the suit."
