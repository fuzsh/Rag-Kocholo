        "text": "Pembroke Dock is the third largest town in Pembrokeshire, and is situated on the River Cleddau. The town began life as a rural estate in the Middle Ages, but was really established with the building of the Royal Dockyard in 1814. The importance, and location, of Pembroke Dock as a Dockyard grew throughout the remainder of the 19th Century, but by the beginning of the 20th Century the town was in decline. War brought about resurgence in the town, both during WW1 when the Dockyards were widely used, and during WW2, when Pembroke Dock played host to various Squadrons of the Royal Air Force, being home to the famous Sunderland flying boat. The War Memorial for the town was unveiled on 30 July 1921, and stands outside St. John’s Church. The War Memorial which commemorates the fallen of WW2 is located inside St John’s Church, and takes the form of a wooden plaque, which commemorates those who fell while serving with the armed forces, and also the civilians who fell. Oddly several of these WW2 casualties died many years after the war. It is very rare to see a memorial commemorate people in this way.\n\nThe Armed Forces-World War Two, 1939-1945\n\nArthur William Allan, Signalman, 2584035, Royal Corps of Signals. Arthur was the son of Percival and Elizabeth Allan, of Pembroke Dock, and was educated at Pembroke Dock Grammar School. Arthur was a pre war regular in the Army, and was in France at the outbreak of war, serving with the Royal Signals. Arthur was killed during the retreat to Dunkirk on 29 May 1940. He was 20 years old, and is buried at Oostduinkerke Communal Cemetery, Belgium.\n\nWilliam Leonard Ambrose, Lieutenant (Q.M.), 51297, Essex Regiment. William was the son of William G. Ambrose and Charlotte R. Ambrose, and the husband of Iris C. M. Ambrose, of Pembroke Dock. He served as Quartermaster with the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment. In April 1941, a coup in Iraq led to the creation of a pro-German dictatorship, and so the British sent a force into Iraq to depose this new government, and return Iraq to British rule. The next stage was the Syria-Lebanon campaign, and it was during this second stage of the offensive that William was killed on 23 June 1941. He was buried at Damascus Commonwealth War Cemetery, Syria.\n\nGerald Albert Attew, Leading Aircraftman, 1175121, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Gerald was the son of Thomas and Ethel Attew, and the husband of Lena C. Attew, of Pembroke Dock.

Gerald is buried at Naples War Cemetery, Italy.\n\nHenry George Baker, Leading Aircraftman, 1404455, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Henry was the son of Henry and Rachael Baker, of Pembroke Dock, and served with the Royal Air Force.

Albert was the son of Ralph Frank Besant and Mary Anne Besant (nee Dawkins), of Pembroke Dock. He served with the Headquarters of 7 Heavy Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The Battery was part of the Air Defence force at Malta. Albert was killed on Malta on 6 July 1942, aged 30. He is buried at Imtarfa Military Cemetery, Malta.\n\nJohn Henry Bevans, Sergeant, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. John was born on 13 December 1917, the son of Shipwright Inspector John Bevans, and of Emilie Jane Bevans (nee Williams), of 7, Waterloo Terrace, Pembroke Dock. He was educated at Pembroke Dock Grammar School. John enlisted into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve soon after the outbreak of war and after training as a Navigator, was posted to 106 Squadron, Royal Air Force. At the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron was flying Hampdens with No. 5 Group, and until early 1941 had a training role. It then reverted to front-line status and began regular night bombing operations against occupied Europe from its base at RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire. On 29 June 1941 John took off from Coningsby aboard Handley Page Hampden I, Serial AD895, which joined a large force of bombers sent to destroy strategic targets in Bremen. John was killed when the Hampden was intercepted and shot down by a German night fighter just South of Uetersen, near Hamburg during the early hours of 30 June 1941. The 24-year-old is buried alongside his crew in Sage War Cemetery, Germany. His parents later moved to Acton, Middlesex.\n\nKenneth Lewis Bittle, Marine, RME/10972, Royal Marine Engineers. Kenneth was the son of William John and Minnie Maria Bittle (nee Lewis), of 49, Military Road, Pembroke Dock.

He died in 1990, aged 73, so it is a mystery why he is named on the memorial.\n\nClifford George Brighty, Gunner, Royal Artillery. Clifford was born on 1 December 1918, the son of George and Stella Brighty (nee Payne). He served during WW2 with the Royal Artillery. He married Priscilla Davies after returning to Pembroke after the war, and died in 1978, aged 58. Priscilla died in 1994. It is not clear why Clifford is on the memorial.\n\nCharles John Westley Brinn, Sergeant (Observer), 563306, Royal Air Force. Charles was born in Tenby in 1912, the son of John Melbourne Brinn and Rosa Brinn (nee Ormond). He served in 59 Squadron, Royal Air Force, which was part of Fighter Command. The Squadron had moved to France during October 1939, equipped with Bristol Blenheim’s, and undertook reconnaissance missions in conjunction with the rapidly retreating BEF during those desperate few months in 1940, when they were being pushed back by the Germans towards Dunkirk. Charles died when his Blenheim IV, Serial L9266 was shot down over France on 22 May 1940, and is buried at Fricourt Communal Cemetery alongside two of his crew members, Francis Bird and Gordon Coles. Charles is also commemorated at St. Issells Church, Saundersfoot.\n\nDonald Broad, Stoker, Royal Navy, H.M.S. Exeter. This man cannot be identified, but is believed to be Donald Broad of the Royal Navy. Donald survived the sinking of Exeter during the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March 1942, and was one of around 800 survivors taken prisoner by the Japanese. He survived three years in the notorious death camps, working on the Thai-Burma Railway, and was given up for dead by his family. Donald returned home in 1946 after the Japanese surrender, and in 1948 married Gertrude James at Pennar. He worked for the MOD at HM mooring and Salvage Depot Pembroke Dock on the small craft, but in 1975 was injured when he was struck by a swinging boom. Donald died early in 1977, aged 57. Many thanks to Basil Hughes for sending me the details about his late friend Donald.\n\nHoward John Calnon, Chief Officer, Merchant Navy. Howard was born on 18 January 1913 the son of Daniel and Margaret Calnon of 15, Military Road, Pennar. He was educated at Pembroke Dock Grammar School. He served in the Merchant Navy aboard the M.V. Empire Comet, a Greenock registered cargo vessel. On her final voyage, she had loaded a general cargo, including manganese ore, tea, groundnuts and linseed oil in Bombay for Manchester, sailing on 12 November 1941. After a stop off at Table bay the ship sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia where she joined up with the 27 ship Liverpool bound Convoy HX-174 which sailed on 7 February 1942. It is believed around 10 February the Empire Comet became detached from the main Convoy whilst in dense fog, as she was last seen on 17 February. The ship, all 37 crew and 8 gunners, were never seen again, and she was declared a war loss on 19 February 1942. She had actually been torpedoed and sunk by U-136. Howard was 29 years old when Empire Comet was lost. He is commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial, London.\n\nColin James Campbell, Flight Sergeant (Air Gunner), 403757, Royal New Zealand Air Force. Colin was the son of Allan Campbell and of Grace Campbell (Nee Menzies), of Bannockburn, Otago, New Zealand. He served with 218 (Royal Air Force) Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force, and while stationed in Britain had lived with his wife Edna May Campbell at Pembroke Dock.

Salvatore served in the Merchant Navy, and at the outbreak of war served aboard the SS St. Patrick, a ferry which served on the Fishguard to Rosslare route. On 13 June 1941, she left Fishguard bound for Ireland. Upon rounding Strumble Head, she was spotted and attacked by German dive bombers, which set the ship on fire. Many of the passengers were rescued, but Salvatore was killed during the attack. He was 37 years old, and is commemorated on Panel 90 of the Tower Hill Memorial, London.\n\nHerbert Henry Carter, Lance Corporal, 4185856, Royal Welch Fusiliers.

Once in Egypt the squadron took part in the campaign in the western desert, supporting the Eighth Army against Rommel and the Afrika Korps. It also took part in the suppression of the Iraqi revolt and sent a detachment to Greece in March 1941. Charles was killed in North Africa on 16 November 1941. He was 27 years old, and is commemorated on the Alamein Memorial, Egypt.\n\nMervin Charles Clapton, Private, 5381460, The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. Mervin was the son of Charles and Sarah Clapton, of Pembroke Dock. He married Queenie May Richards of Coleford, Gloucestershire in 1943. He served with the 2nd (Airborne) Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, which had originally been an infantry unit, which converted to become paratroopers in 1941. The new formation became part of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, and saw its first action in the Middle East in May 1943. The 2nd Ox and Bucks were then prepared for the assault on Fortress Europe, joining the 6th Airborne Division, and took part in the famous landings on the bridges over the River Orne and adjacent Canal in Normandy (subsequently known as the attack on Pegasus Bridge), on D-Day, under the command of Major John Howard. Mervin survived Pegasus Bridge, but was killed during the later fighting in Normandy, on 27 August 1944. He was 27 years old, and is buried at Fatouville-Grestain (Carbec) Graveyard, Normandy.\n\nI. Cole, Rifleman, King’s Royal Rifle Corps. This man cannot be identified.\n\nWalter Evlyn Cooper, Captain, 64140, Welch Regiment. Walter was the son of James and Elizabeth Cooper, of Devonport.

It trained at Wallgrove, Ingleburn, and Bathurst before embarking for Singapore, as part of the 22nd Brigade of the 8th Australian Division, on 2 February 1941. The division arrived in Singapore on 18 February, and the 2/20th moved to south-west Malaya to train before moving to guard the port of Mersing on the east coast. Singapore, as we know today, was due to be attacked by the Japanese, who would force an embarrassing surrender on the Allied garrison, but Arthur was to miss out on the fighting, drowning in the Mersing River on 31 December 1941. He was 28 years old and is buried in Kranji War Cemetery, Singapore. His next of kin was shown as B. Harrison. Arthur does not appear to be commemorated anywhere locally.\n\nCharles Frederick William Darbon, Lance Corporal, Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

Charles married Married Edna V. Davies of Pembroke Dock in December 1937. He appears to have died in 1987, so his inclusion on the Pembroke Dock Memorial is a mystery.\n\nErnest Roy Darlington, Private, 6149590, The East Yorkshire Regiment. Ernest, known as Roy, was born on 17 April 1920, one of six sons of Thomas Arthur James Darlington and Lily Darlington (nee Jubb), of Pembroke Dock and was educated at Pembroke Dock Grammar School.

On 6 January 1943, Colin was flying Bristol Beaufighter If, Serial V8279 when he spotted a German Dornier Do24 flying boat. His Beaufighter was hit as he attacked the aircraft and he crashed into the Mediterranean, killing himself and his co-pilot, Patrick Goalby. Colin has no known grave and is commemorated on the Malta Memorial, Malta.\n\nDaniel James Davies, Corporal, 2316786, Royal Corps of Signals. Daniel was the son of James and Anna Maria Davies of Pembroke Dock, and the husband of Elsie May Davies, of Enfield, Middlesex. He served with the 1st Armoured Division Signals, Royal Signals Corps.

On the evening of 17 September 1939, she was on patrol off the coast of Ireland, when the German submarine U-29 fired three torpedoes at her, knocking out all electrical power, and she capsized and sank in 20 minutes with the loss of 519 of her crew. Henry was among the dead. He was 32 years old, and is commemorated on bay 1, panel 1 of the Lee-on-Solent Memorial, Hampshire.\n\nRonald Thomas Davies, Senior Master, Royal Navy. Ronald was the son of George Warren Davies and Mary Jane Davies, of Pembroke Dock. He was a Royal Naval regular, serving aboard the mighty battleship HMS Hood.
