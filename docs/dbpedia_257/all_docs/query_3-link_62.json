As a consequence, Mussolini ordered only limited aggressive actions to capture territory along the borders of Egypt, Kenya, and Sudan.\n\nHowever as a result of advice from the Commander in IEA the Duke Of Aosta, this rigid defensive strategy was changed a kittke on the 14 June. Amedeo, Duke of Aosta—the Governor-General and Viceroy of IEA, convinced Comando Supremo to plan a campaign to conquer British Somaliland. Victor Emmanuel III—the King of Italy—and Mussolini agreed but it take until early August before all the supplies troop movements were in place.\n\nThe Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by Lt Gen Nasi, GOC Eastern Sector. The force included 23 col bns of regular native troops in five bdes, 3 Blackshirt battalions, and 3 bands (bande) of dubats and other locally recruited irregulars. The Italians also had armoured vehicles (a small number of both lt and med tanks), artillery, and, most importantly, superior air support. The Italian troops numbered about 24,000.\n\nOn Italy's declaration of war in June 1940, the British forces in British Somaliland were placed under the command of Lt-Col Arthur Reginald Chater, the commander of the Somaliland Camel Corps. At the start of August, the newly promoted Brigadier Chater commanded a contingent of about 4,000 soldiers comprising the lightly armed Somaliland Camel Corps, the 2nd (Nyasaland) Bn King's African Rifles (KAR), the 1st Bn Northern Rhodesian Regt (KAR), the 3/15th Punjab Regiment, and 1st East African Lt Bty (four 3.7 in (94 mm) howitzers). They were joined from Aden on 7 August by the 1/2nd Punjab Regt and 8 August by 2nd Bn Black Watch. Chaters' force was not only critically short of artillery, it had no tanks or armoured cars nor did it have any anti-tank weapons to oppose the Italian medium and light tanks. There were also some 24 M11/39 medium tanks in IEA\n\nL3 Lt Tank. In both Libya and East Africa the Italians fielded large numbers of these AFVs.

Fw. Menge claims two and Ofw. Sawallisch claims one, being the fifth victories for both pilots. 6 airmen were killed and 10 were taken prisoner. The remaining 7 aircraft returned to \"Ark Royal\" at 0345 hours. Nearby, \"Ark Royal's\" escorting destroyers HMS \"Antelope\" and HMS \"Electra\" collided in fog. Both sustained damage that would take them out of action until Aug 1940. A German seaplane picks up one of the Skua pilots. The same seaplane also picks up 2 survivors from HMS \"Ardent\" (sunk June 8 ). One later dies from exposure. Able seaman Roger Hooke is \"Ardent's\" only survivor. He will be repatriated in 1943 due to ill health.\n\nWESTERN FRONT: The French forces west of Paris are now retreating to the Loire.

General von Bock, CO Heeresgruppe B, reviews victory parades in Place de la Concorde and at Arc de Triomphe. Von Studnitz leads the 87th Infantry Division in its triumphal entry march into Paris. While French troops organize a fighting retreat further South, Parisian restaurants and shops do a brisk trade with the German troops who act more as tourists than a force of occupation. Only 700,000 people remain in the city out of a population of 5 Million.\n\nNew instructions are issued to the German armies. While most of the armored forces are to continue their advance into the center of the country, Guderian's two corps are to swing east to cut off any attempt by the Maginot garrisons to retreat.

It followed Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk and Operation Cycle, the evacuation from Le Havre, which finished on 13 June. The number of people evacuated from France to Britain during Operation Ariel were:\n\nBritish – 144,171\n\nPolish – 24,352\n\nFrench – 18,246\n\nCzech – 4,938\n\nBelgian – 163\n\nIn total, 191,870 allied soldiers, airmen and civilians. Although much equipment was lost, it was still possible to save 310 artillery guns, 2,292 vehicles, 1,800 tons of stores,13 light tanks and 9 cruiser tanks.\n\nTroop evacuation on SS Guinean during Operation Ariel, Abandoned British Army motorcycles at Monce-en-Belin near Le Mans, 13 June 1940\n\nUnlike DYNAMO, ARIEL was undertaken mostly by some of the largest ships in the British Merchant Marine\n\nOn the 16th, DDs WOLVERINE, VANOC, WHIRLWIND were detailed to escort loaded ships from France to the UK. From 15 to 18 June, 30,630 troops were evacuated from Cherbourg and taken to Portsmouth. On 16 and 17 June, 21,474 troops were lifted from St Malo and taken to Portsmouth. The demolition party for St Malo was XD.M , delivered on DD WILD SWAN on the 17th, after calling at St Helier en route. On 16 and 17 June, 32,584 troops were evacuated from Brest and taken to Plymouth. From 16 to 18 June, 57,235 troops were evacuated from St Nazaire and Nantes to Plymouth. DDs VEGA, FERNIE, SABRE and sloops FOXGLOVE and ROSEMARY were employed as escorts along the evacuation route. DDs HAVELOCK, WOLVERINE, BEAGLE with troopships GEORGIC, DUCHESS OF YORK, BATORY, SOBIESKI of convoy FF.1 were at Quiberon Bay on the 15th. These liners departed St Nazaire very early on the 17th, escort DDs WHIRLWIND and BEAGLE. On the 16th, DDs HIGHLANDER and VANOC joined the force. British troopship FRANCONIA of convoy FF.2 was damaged by German bombing at Brest on the 16th. She was temporarily out of action due to mainshaft and gearing out of line. However, on the 17th , she was able to proceed independently to Plymouth. British troopships LANCASTRIA and ORONSAY of convoy FF.2 were damaged by air bombing at Quiberon Bay on the 17th. ORONSAY departed St Nazaire on the 17th. On the 17th 2 hrs after being damaged by bombing, troopship LANCASTRIA (UK 16,243 grt) was sunk by German bombing at St Nazaire with a heavy loss of life.\n\nThe great pity about the LANCASTRIA is that the disaster was quite possibly avoidable (though we can never be sure) By the mid-afternoon of 17 June she had embarked an unknown number (best estimate appears to be that 5310 were aboard) of civilian refugees (including embassy staff and employees of Fairey Aviation of Belgium), BEF l-o-c troops (including Pioneer and RASC soldiers) and RAF personnel. The ship's official capacity was 2,200 including the 375-man crew, but her skipper had been instructed by the RN to \"load as many men as possible without regard to the limits set down under international law\". At 13:50, during an air-raid, the nearby ORONSAY, a 20,000-ton Orient Liner, was hit on the bridge by a German bomb. LANCASTRIA was free to depart and the she was advised to do that, but without DD escort, as all escorts were fully engaged at that moment. The LANCASTRIA decided to wait. It was a fatal decision. A fresh air raid began before 16:00. LANCASTRIA was bombed at 15:48 by Ju 88 a/c from II Gp /KG30. 3 direct hits caused the ship to list first to starboard then to port; she rolled over and sank within 20 mins. Over 1,400 tons of fuel oil leaked into the sea and was set partially on fire. Many drowned, were choked by the oil, or were shot by strafing German a/c. Survivors were taken aboard other evacuation vessels, the trawler Cambridgeshire rescuing 900. There were 2,447 survivors. The death toll is beieved to account for roughly a 25% of the total losses of the BEF in France. She sank around 5 nmi (9.3 km) sth of Chémoulin Point in the Charpentier roads, around 9 nmi (17 km) from St. Nazaire. Best estimates of fatalities is 2899 lost. Rudolph Sharp survived the sinking and went on to command the RMS LACONIA, losing his life on 12 September 1942 when that ship was torpedoed and sunk off West Africa. The immense loss of life was such that the British govt suppressed news of the disaster through the D-Notice system, but the story was broken in the US by The New York Times and in Britain by The Scotsman on 26 July, more than five weeks after the sinking. Other British newspapers then covered the story, including the Daily Herald (also on 26 July), which carried the story on its front page, and Sunday Express on 4 August; the latter included a photograph of the capsized ship with her upturned hull lined with men under the headline \"Last Moments of the Greatest Sea Tragedy of All Time\", but the full story of the LANCASTRIA was released. As part of the govt-ordered cover-up, survivors and the crews of the ships that had gone to the aid of LANCASTRIA were instructed at the time not to discuss the disaster. Finally, in 2015 9just recently) the British MOD has admitted that there are no further classified documents being held\n\nMalta\n\nMalta's four operational Gladiator a/c cannot be expected to last long under the current pressure from enemy attacks, Air chiefs stated at the time.

British Ambassador presents Draft Declaration of 'Act of Union' between Britain and France but the French reject it. Prime Minister Paul Reynaud is unwilling to negotiate a separate peace with Germany (either to preserve his honor or unable to face the failure of his policies). He is asked to resign by French President Albert Lebrun and replaced with 84 year-old Philippe Pétain, WWI hero of Verdun, who is determined to end hostilities with Germany. Reynaud will be arrested on Pétain's orders in September 1940 and imprisoned by the Germans in the Itter Castle near Wörgl, Austria, until the end of the war. Pétain will be imprisoned after the war as a traitor and German collaborator, dying in prison in 1951 .François Darlan was named the Vichy French Minister of the Navy.\n\nGermans broke through to Dijon and reach Besancon in France, while continuing a wide assault on the Maginot Line.

But not before tragedy strikes the Gruppe. While strafing the French airfield at Chateauroux, the Messerschmitts of Uffz. Fritz Stahn and Hans Brandt collide and crash to the ground. Both pilots from 2./JG 1 are killed.\n\nThe Curie Laboratory in France transferred 410 pounds of Norwegian heavy water to the British. British SS \"Broompark\" leaves the Gironde (western France) carrying 26 containers of 'heavy water', previously obtained from Norway by Joliot-Curie, the atomic physicist.\n\nPortuguese consul general in France issues 30,000 transit visas in Bordeaux to refugees escaping European war.\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN: After tracking British armed merchant cruiser HMS \"Andania\" for 3 days, UA (Foreign U-boats - U-A - German U-boats of the Kriegsmarine - uboat.net) finally sinks her just after midnight, 230 miles west-northwest of the Faroe Islands.

The Führer had no so far uttered any such intention, as he is fully aware of the extreme difficulties inherent in such an operation. That is also why the High Command has as yet undertaken no studies or preparations (the Commander-in-Chief, Luftwaffe, has put certain things in hand, e.g. the activation of a parachute division).\"\n\nThe deposed German Emperor Wilhelm II sent a congratulatory telegram to Adolf Hitler regarding the victory over France. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov sent German Ambassador Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg a message of congratulations for the successful German conquest of France.\n\nBritish Bomber Command launches 138 aircraft on Germany, primarily on oil targets. Only one plane does not return.\n\nWESTERN FRONT: The Petain Cabinet takes office. Weygand is Minister of Defense. They announce that they are asking Germany for armistice terms. The British government understands that these will only be accepted on the condition that the French Fleet does not fall into German hands. Equally it is the German policy to stop the French Fleet and colonies from joining Britain and this is the reason for their comparative leniency in allowing the establishment of Vichy as a focus for the loyalty for the French. French representatives in the USA do allow the British to take up arms orders they have made under the \"Cash and Carry\" rules.\n\nPrime Minister Philippe Pétain ordered the French Army to stop fighting and sued for an honorable peace as the Germans crossed the Loire River near Orleans, France. Rumors of surrender demoralize the French troops and embolden the Germans. Taking advantage of the initial demoralizing effect and confusion this caused, the German 7.Panzerdivision under Erwin Rommel advanced toward Cherbourg. Rommel (recuperating and re-equipping 7.Panzerdivision since June 11) decides to gamble all and head for Cherbourg to prevent the Allied evacuation. His tanks and trucks laden with infantry travel 125 miles. To the east, tanks under Heinz Guderian reached the Swiss border at Pontalier, encircling 17 French divisions on the Maginot Line. Other units have nearly reached the Loire and still more are advancing in Brittany and Normandy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Allied evacuation operation, Operation Ariel, continued in Cherbourg, Saint-Malo, Brest, and Saint-Nazaire. At Saint-Malo, private vessels of the Royal Channel Islands Yacht Club of Jersey arrived to assist with the evacuations. British Cunard liner \"Lancastria\" embarks 4,000 to 9,000 British civilians, troops and RAF personnel in the Loire estuary. At 1548 hours, she is hit by 3 bombs from Junkers Ju 88s (1 bomb goes down her funnel and explodes in the engine room) and sinks in 20 minutes. There are 2,477 survivors (ASW trawler \"Cambridgeshire\" rescues 900). It is the worst tragedy in British maritime history and the single greatest loss of life for UK forces in any single engagement in WWII. It was recognized as a catastrophe at the time and Churchill ordered a news blackout about the incident, fearing the impact such an incident would have on morale. Although it was reported in the foreign press later in May, many people in Britain did not learn of the disaster until after the war. Blue Funnel Line ship \"Teiresias\" is attacked by German aircraft while evacuating British Expeditionary Force troops from Saint Nazaire. The ship is abandoned when the engine room is flooded.\n\nDetermined to continue fighting, General Charles de Gaulle and other senior French officers refuse to serve the new French government and leave for London with 100,000 francs in gold provided by the ex-PM Paul Reynaud. Winston Churchill decides Charles de Gaulle should be recognized as speaking for France, not Marshal Pétain.\n\nThe three Gruppen of JG 26 are finally brought together when they are ordered to the large airbase outside Paris known as Villacoublay.\n\nFrench Minister for Foreign Affairs Paul Baudouin privately informed Deputy US Ambassador to France Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, Jr., that the French fleet;\n\n\"…would never be surrendered to Germany\".\n\nEASTERN EUROPE: Soviet troops entered Latvia and Lithuania without little resistance. In Estonia, the government surrenders and agrees to Soviet occupation. Most of the Estonian army and the volunteer militia Estonian Defence League lay down their arms. The Single Signal Battalion will hold out in Tallinn until June 21. NKO Commissar Semyon Timoshenko ordered the disbanding of the military organizations of the Baltic States, leaving the task of border protection to NKVD troops. In North America, the United States refused to recognize the Soviet occupation of the two Baltic countries.\n\nUNITED KINGDOM: Winston Churchill announced to the British people that the United Kingdom would continue to fight until Adolf Hitler was removed from power. Churchill broadcasts:\n\n'We have become the sole champions now in arms to defend the world cause.'\n\nBritish Purchasing Commission takes overall outstanding French arms contracts and offers to purchase as much war material as US can produce.\n\nBritish unemployment figure decreased by 114,000 in May 1940 to a new low of 767,000.\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN: German submarine U-46 sank Greek ship \"Elpis\" 250 miles west of Cape Finisterre, Spain; the entire crew of 28 survived.\n\nNORTH AMERICA: US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Harold R. Stark asked for US$4,000,000,000 to construct a \"Two-Ocean Navy\".\n\nCivilian contractors began working on the expansion of the US Navy airfield on Maui, US Territory of Hawaii.\n\n. .\n\nJune 18 Tuesday\n\nWESTERN FRONT: The German 7.Panzerdivision under Rommel advanced another 75 miles since the prior date, reaching Cherbourg, France but not before most of the Allied personnel had already evacuated the city. 30,600 British and Allied troops were evacuated from Cherbourg. French battleship Courbet gave covering fire. Also on this date, Le Mans, Belfort, Metz, and Dijon fell under German control. Elsewhere, the Allies completed the Operation Ariel evacuation of La Pallice and Saint-Nazaire, but all the heavy equipment were left behind in the latter location. All large French towns are to be surrendered without resistance. Civil administrators and military forces are ordered to await arrival of Germans.\n\nIn Brest, with 5.Panzerdivision only a few hours away, French cruisers \"El Djezair\", \"El Kantara\", \"El Mansour\", \"Ville d'Oran\", and \"Ville d'Alger\" departed 1,200 tons of French gold for Casablanca, French Morocco while the cruiser \"Victor-Schoelcher\" transported 198 tons of Belgian gold (originally held in French banks) from Lorient to the port of Dakar in French West Africa. The French gold would arrive in Casablanca on 21 Jun 1940, but the Belgian gold would be captured by the Germans (much to the chagrin of the Belgians who sue the Banque de France in 1941, demanding in return French gold being held in the USA).\n\nEvacuation of last RAF squadrons from France completed. The remnants of the RAF Hurricane squadrons in France evacuate their bases, having provided cover for the final Allied retreat from France. The last to leave are Nos. 1 and 73 Sqns, which had been the first to arrive in 1939. The fighting in France cost the RAF a total of 1,029 aircraft and over 1,500 personnel.\n\nNew French battleship \"Richelieu\" leaves Brest for Dakar (arrives June 23). Uncompleted battleship \"Jean Bart\" is towed out of St Nazaire; fuelled under German air attack and sails under half-power for Casablanca (night June 18-19; arrives 22).\n\nNORTHERN EUROPE: German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop informs the Swedish Minister in Berlin, Germany, that if Sweden resists the German use of Swedish railways to transport troops and supplies to Norway, it would have dire consequences. Sweden allowed passage of German troops between Oslo, Norway, and Trelleborg, Sweden, on Swedish rail lines, with the only demand being that the number of troops coming from Germany must equal to the number being evacuated, so that it could not be said that Sweden was helping Germany reinforce the front lines. Sweden receives a reply from Britain regarding expectations in Norway, indicating that Britain might have to make peace with Germany.\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN: German submarine U-28 sank Finnish ship \"Sarmatia\" southwest of Ireland. German submarine U-32 sank Spanish trawler \"Sálvora\", Spanish trawler \"Nuevo Ons\", and Norwegian ship \"Altair\" southwest of Ireland. French troopship \"Champlain\" (28,100 t) crippled by mine (finally sunk by U-65, June 21) in Bay of Biscay.\n\nNORTH AMERICA: US Secretary of State Cordell Hull directed Deputy US Ambassador to France Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, Jr. to inform the French government that if France failed to keep its fleet out of German hands, France would;\n\n\"…permanently lose the friendship and goodwill of the Government of the United States\".\n\nFrench Minister for Foreign Affairs Baudouin reiterated that the French fleet \"would never be surrendered to Germany\".\n\nIn Canada, Prime Minister William King introduces the National Resources Mobilization Act in the House of Commons. The bill would require Canadians to register for national service within Canada, and give the government control of Canadian property for the duration of the war.\n\n.\n\n18 June 1940 (Part II)\n\nChurchill gives a speech to the House Of Commons. It is the now famous \"Finest Hour Speech\" of which the following is the final paragraph. The full speech is over 30 mins long.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjXKnTqvRSU\n\n\"What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, \"This was their finest hour.\"\n\n[OPERATIONS CONT'D]\n\nUK-France\n\nWhen Brest fell on the 19th to German forces, the only naval vessel left afloat was the old six stack cruiser JEANNE DE ARC (1899) .

The CL arrived back at Auckland on the 24th after searching the area near Kermadec Is. The steamer NIAGARA was carrying gold bullion. £2,379,000 sterling was recovered from the sunken vessel.\n\nDKM Raider ORION captured steamer TROPIC SEA (Nor 5781 grt). TROPIC SEA was sent back to France as a prize but was scuttled on 3 September 1940 just as she was as she arriving off Bordeaux when intercepted by sub TRUANT. At the time of her loss, TROPIC SEA had 24 crew from the British steamer HAXBY intercepted by ORION on 24 April."
