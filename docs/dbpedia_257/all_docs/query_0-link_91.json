OVER 5 5 0 , 0 0 0 COPIES SOLD EVERY WEEK PRICE\n\n2. 2 The Austrolion Women's Weekly September 16, ^ f f f ' T © r% R o y a l A u s t r a lia n JTa r y F i v e Y e a r s O f F i g h t i n g O n E v e h y O c e a n O U N G Australians show steel enough at sea when war comes. In this war, as in the last, the Royal Australian Navy has seen, and Is seeing, service on every ocean. Thousands of Australians have joined the Royal Navy and are serv­ ing in every kind of war craft. Except for H.M .A.S. Perth, then off the coast of Venezuela, our whole fleet of cruisers and smaller craft was in home seas on Sep­ tember 3, 1939. The war was not 50 minutes old when our Navy Office received the mes­ sage: Total Germany. The fleet was put on a war footing at once, and the enlistment of seamen began. There has never been any lack of volunteers. H.M .A. cruiser Hobart left Darwin for the Red Sea. In October, five Australian destroyers sailed for the Mediterranean. The cruiser Canberra’s first war job was to hunt for the German pocket battleship Graf Spee, in the Indian Ocean. The Graf Spee turned back into the Atlantic, to come to her end off Montevideo. Hunting raiders, convoy work, and odd war jobs occupied Australian warships in the war’s first nine months. Mussolini’s mistake of June 10, 1940, gave us more action. O n June 13, with Italy’s war three days old, our veteran, the Voyager, opened our account in the Mediterranean. She smashed an Italian submarine off Alexandria. Of the Stuart, Vampire, Voyager, Vendetta, and Waterhen, all veterans <Jf the last war, Mr. Menzies, M .H.R., then Prime Minister, said on May 9, 1941: “W e used to talk of them as held together by pieces of string . . . Yet they were in the kill in the big Mediterranean battles.” The Stuart was in the Calabria battle of July 9, 1940; the battle of Cape Matapan, March 28-29, 1941; made nine attacks on submarines; and took part in five campaigns — the Western Desert, Greece, Crete, Syria, and the supplying of besieged Tobruk. After the battle of Calabria Admiral An­ drew (A.B.C.) Cunningham said: “I told the Australian destroyers to look after the air- craft-carrier Eagle. The next thing I saw was the Stuart leading the destroyers after the Italian Fleet. I said: \"That damned fellow ought to be court-martialled.’ But he wasn’t.” H .M A . cruiser Perth and the destroyer Vendetta were also in the early stages of the Matapan fight, but not in the main night action. Of Stuart, Admiral Cunning­ ham spoke of “distinguished service of a standard we have come to expect from the Royal Australian Navy.” H.M .A.S. Sydney was on convoy duty on June 27,1940, when she brushed off the Italian destroyer Espero, which went down fighting bravely. The Sydney was in the Calabria battle. Ten days later, on July 19, she sank the fast, modem Italian cruiser, Bartolomeo Colleoni. O n August 25 the Sydney led the bom­ bardment of the Italian positions at Bardia. She also attacked the Italians in the Dodecanese. W hen Mussolini entered the war Italy had a number of vessels, including small warships, in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. H .M A .S . Hobart was at hand, and rounded up some of the Italian ships in the Red Sea. The Italians, finding themselves bottled up, scuttled 14 vessels at Massawa. W hen the Italians invaded British Somali­ land, landing parties from the Hobart were active in defence. The Hobart covered the withdrawal of British forces. On August 25, 1948, Wavell sent a message thanking Captain Howden and his crew for saving many lives during the evacuation of Berbera. H .M A .S . Perth and other Australian war­ ships were in the thick of the fighting off Crete when the Germans invaded the island in May, 1941. The Germans bombed the Perth for 13 hours on end, but she came through. “It was the liveliest day I ever spent,” said her captain. A bomb splinter went through his cabin—while he was out of it. Our losses in the Mediterranean, light in view of the fighting, were destroyers Nestor and Waterhen, and sloop Parramatta. The Nestor was one of five destroyers — the others are Norman, Nizam, Napier, and Nepal—that the British Admiralty handed over to the R.A.N. in March, 1941. In the 15 months before she was sunk, By THOMAS DUNBABIN which happened on June 15, 1942, the Nestor had been in the Greenland seas helping to shepherd the German battleship Bismarck to her doom, had served in the Madagascar occupation, off Iceland, off West Africa, and in the Indian Ocean. Though our warships fought mainly in the Mediterranean till Japan came in, they also ranged over the globe. The cruiser Australia, under Captain Ross Stuart, had a leading part in the tragi­ comic Dakar operations of September, 1946. As she led the fleet in, the French destroyer Audacieux (Audacious) tried to torpedo her. The Australia had to sink the Audacieux, though* her crew hated doing it. In August, 1941, R A N . vessels co-operated in the British move into Iran which opened the Trans-Iran route for supplies to the Soviet. The Australian and British ships put two Iranian gunboats out of action and seized seven Axis ships lying in Persian Gulf ports. At that moment H.M .A.S. Norman, con­ voying vessels to Archangel, was battling round the North Cape of Norway. On November 19, 1941, H.M.A.S. Sydney sank the heavily armed German raider Kor- moran, alias Steiermark, off the coast of Western Australia, and was herself sunk by the raider’s fire. There are no known survivors from the Sydney’s 645 men; 317 Germans reached the coast. Three weeks later Japan attacked. For the first time our Navy had to fight in the waters north of Australia. First Australian ship into battle was the old Vampire, part of the destroyer screen when Japanese bombers sank the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse in the Gulf of Siam on December 10, 1941. The Vam ­ pire, which saved 225 men of the crews, was lost in the Bay of Bengal on April 9, 1942. W hen the great liner Empress of Asia was burning off Singapore on February 5, 1942, H.M .A.S. Yarra ran alongside and took off 1334 men. Then the Yarra picked up 470 from the sea, saving 1804 in all. It was the most amazing rescue of the war. Two days before H.M .A.S. Hobart had taken off the passengers and crew of a blazing vessel which the Japanese were still bombing. After fighting in the Java Sea battle, H.M .A.S, Perth passed through Sunda Straits on February 28. At midnight she radioed that she had met a Japanese fleet off St. Nicholas Point. She went down fighting. The little Yarra was sunk on March 4 after a fight against three heavy cruisers and four destroyers. Four days later a Dutch submarine picked up 13 of the Yarra’s men, afloat on rafts. W hen the corvette Armidale was sunk in a fight off Timor in. December, 1942, she went down with guns firing even when her deck was at an angle of 60 degrees. W hen the Japanese threat to Australia was smashed in the Coral Sea battle of May 4-9, 1942, H.M .A. ships Australia and Hobart, with U S . units, all under the command of Rear-Admiral J. G . Crace, were off the south­ east end of New Guinea, blocking any Japanese dash at the Queensland coast or Port Moresby. Without fighter protection they fought off on May 7 a heavy-bomber attack, bringing down three planes. When the South-west Pacific forces began to roll up the Japanese, Australian warships led the attacking forces which landed at Tulagi and on Guadalcanal, in the Solomons, on August 7, 1942. O n the night of August 8 the enemy sank the cruiser Canberra. O n Boxing Day, 1943, the Australia softened Japanese positions at Cape Gloucester. New Britain, with 350 8-inch shells. In January, 1944, H.M .A. landing «hip (Infantry) Westralia, which once brought to Sydney apples from Hobart, carried U.S. landing troops to Arawe. H M .A.S. Shropshire and the new destroyers Arunta and Warramunga shelled enemy posi­ tions at Manus (Admiralties) on March 3, 1944. In May the home-built corvettes Kapunda and Stawell and the frigate Barcoo supported the Australian clean-up of the north coast of New Guinea. Heavy shelling by the Australia, flying the flag of Commodore Collins, now operational commander of the Australian squadron, and the tough little Arunta and Warramunga opened the way for the landings on Noemfoor. The Pacific W ar did not mean a complete withdrawal from other seas. H.M .A. corvettes Cairns, Cessnock, Gerald - ton, Ipswich. Lismore, Maryborough, and Wollongong (all Australian-built) were in the Sicily landing. W e are not as Navy-conscious as we should be. Australia has heard too little of the high adventure of its Navy.\n\n3.

N O N E of it made much sense at first. The Annabelle was slip­ ping through a smooth green sea off the coast of Kapangi Island, and Porpoise Bailey had just come on the poop in the dawn wind. “Y ’know, Bill,” he said. “I don’t care for these government charters. They 'old a man down. W e ’ears there’s a new shell found off the Gilberts, for instance, but can we chase off pearling? Not a chance! It’s deliver this cargo to th’ army base at Lampi River or get tossed in the clink.” “The shell’s probably wormy,” I soothed him. “And anyway the boys have likely lifted the best of it by now.” ’That’s what’s chewing me,” he ated disconsolately. \"If th’ rest x the boys is under charter like me, O.K. W e c’n all scramble for the pickings later. But knowing some of them, it’s tuppence to a baked emu they ducked orders and are diving right now.” He was rambling further on the subject when we got a hail from the look-out, and we both turned fast. W e weren’t too jumpy actually. There wasn’t supposed to be any­ thing but a dead Jap closer than Port Moresby, but, times being what they were, you never can tell. “Better take a look, Bill,” said Porpoise soberly, and I shinned into the rigging with the glasses. And then I laughed. “It’s Timkins’ crate, the Koo- maloo!” I called down. “Rust all over and that cockeyed funnel with a for’ard list. Still carrying that red patch abaft Number Four hold, too. No mistaking her any­ where.” “Should’ve guessed it was Tim ­ kins from th’ smoke,” Porpoise agreed as I dropped beside him again. “Buys the worst coal south of th’ Line. But what’s ’e doing up here?” “Government charter like us,” I suggested reasonably, and he grunted. “Come to think of it,” he observed as a sudden thought struck him, “Timkins owes me four quid. W e was on a bender in Dar­ win one time and ’e blotted out on me and left me t* settle the bill. Sailed next morning afore I could grab ’im. M ay­ be he’s chang­ ing course for us just special to divvy up, though that ain’t like Timkins, th’ big-hearted rat!” “It’s not,” I agreed, “but changing course he is.” Porpoise picked up the glasses to stare at the oncoming little tramp. W e boih saw the vivid flame of a shot then, and a shell skip-hopped across our bows in a manner there was no mistaking. “W hat the devil!” I choked. “Has Timkins gone crazy?” There was another shot, and this time it whined pretty near over our bowsprit. Porpoise lowered the glasses. “Better ’eave to, Bill,” he said quietly. “It’s Timkins all right, but something’s up.” He stared, hard­ eyed, at the Koomaloo, as puzzled as I was. She was very close now, and Tim ­ kins was hanging his wiry, starved- looking body over the bridge wing with a megaphone at his wrinkled face, and he was yelling hysterically, “Belay there, Porpoise! No fight­ ing!” His voice cracked and his arms tossed about and he dropped sud­ denly back from sight. “W hat does ’e think we’d fight with?” Porpoise demanded. ‘‘Be­ laying pins?” But we both understood what Timkins meant when we saw snuff- colored faces and slant eyes appear­ ing at the steamer’s rail, curiously mixed up with what seemed to be Timkins’ own crew. It still didn’t make sense, but there it was. The Koomaloo’s work boat came over, and in it were two Jap officers and four or five armed men, and they didn’t waste time. “Most unpleasant,” said the lead­ ing officer grinning. “But very fortunate you stay alive. You are cap­ tain, yes?” He Porpoise, wielding the hose, was washing Japs right and left into the scuppers. looked at me, I suppose because I was dressed, and Porpoise was still in pyjamas. I jerked a thumb at Porpoise. “So,” he said, shrugging. “Very curious to see captain so untidy. Very strange people, ’Stralians. Captain Timkins explain this schooner and give excellent sugges­ tions, so we don’t sink you yet.” They came aboard and he stood, straddle-legged and grinning, nur­ sing his revolver tutt, and then sud­ denly he sliced viciously at Por­ poise’s middle with the hard edge of his hand. Porpoise doubled up and turned white. The Jap slapped him hard, and cut him across the stomach again, and I had a gun jammed in my back as I instinctively started forward. I’d been mate to Porpoise ten years and more, and you don’t like to see your skipper battered round. “W hat cargo?” asked the officer, smiling. “For where? Give me your papers.” Porpoise was too sick to go below, so I unlocked his desk for the visitors. They looted the cabins for trinkets and took Porpoise’s cash-box, but principally they wanted our pilot charts for the coast. Then they kicked us all overside into the boat and pulled back to the Koomaloo. There was no sign of Timkins when we got on deck, and no sign of his crew, but there were a lot of other Japs standing round, and we were herded into No. 2 hold, which had a hatch off one corner to let us down. Except that they didn’t let Porpoise down. They seemed to like manhandling him, even if it did take four of them to lift his groaning carcase, and they just threw him on top of the rest of us. Then the hatches were re­ placed and the ship’s engine started. The gun she had aft began firing, too, and we all guessed they were shelling the Annabelle. Then the firing stopped. I got Porpoise propped against the nearest bulkhead, and someone groped through the dark and took my shirt-front and stuck a face close to mine. It was Timkins. \"W hat a mess, Bill,” he croaked. “Did they bust the old sea cow much?” He meant Porpoise. I said, “I dunno. They ain’t been petting him, that’s certain.” “W hen I’m able,” wheezed Por­ poise, “I’ll unravel you for a cabin mat, Jed Timkins. Bushing a chum like this.” “Wait’ll you hear,” Timkins snarled. “A few bruises ain’t going to hurt your blubber. You’d ’a’ got worse if I hadn’t talked fast. They’d have shelled you, but they wanted coast charts bad, an’ I ain’t carry­ ing the right ones, but as soon as I saw that slab-sided cow we was over­ hauling was the Annabelle, I figured you was saved if I told ’em you’d be carrying the works. I tossed in you and Bill were fair coast pilots, too, an’ that lifted your bacon. That’s how much I bushed you, cobber.” Porpoise tried to sit up. “Any time you push a favor, someone’s paying off,” he groaned. “I could've maybe made a run for the beach if you’d tipped me, and got me an’ the crew away.” “Listen, you bald-headed coot,” Timkins rasped. “Every time a patrol plane comes flying round, or a ship comes in sight, me and my boys is chased on deck and scat­ tered round like we is cruising normal, see? Then I makes the right signals and give our number, and the plane or what it is chases off, satisfied. And why don’t I tip you, you say? And why don’t I tip the planes? ’Cause all hands has a Jap stuck behind with a gun set to blow their gizzards out. “A n ’ there ain’t no faking for me neither. The Japs got my code books afore I could dump ’em, and they’ve a guy in the wireless shack all ready in case any questions pop in. Everything’s checked and there ain’t a chance. So chew on that, mister.” Porpoise grunted. “How’d it all come about? You ain’t th’ kind- hearted sort of chum what heaves Japs aboard on a fishing line.” “That’s just about what I did do!” Timkins snarled. “I discharged cargo at Coomb's Landing, and then went ’way round to Hem e Cove to water at thé spring there. “But I’d scarce anchored— after dark, it was— when a lot of canoes and rafts jumped me and the yeller rats swarmed aboard. Took over complete, and I was laid out cold afore I knew it. “Came to at sea with them slap­ ping me about, and then I was stood on the bridge to show m ’self to a ’Stralian destroyer, and when her skipper was satisfied and had shoved off, the head Jap spilled the works. I guess he felt so pleased with hisself he was just busting to talk.” “Which shows ’e’d never heard of you,” Porpoise commented. I told him to shut up and hear Timkins out. “He’d better listen, Bill,” Timkins agreed. “W e ’re in a bad spot. Well, anyway, it figures down these Ja$s is part of a crowd that got licked in that Moresby fighting and they been hiding out waiting to get clear. But their big bloke— a general or some­ thing— gets taken by some coast tribe, and the Japs figure they got to get him free first. The blacks’ve taken the big bloke to their village, which, it seems, can’t be jumped ’cept from the sea side. “W e find ’em this village, round Cape Standon way, as near as I can figure. They get the big bloke and we all steam to some other spot where there’s likely to be a sub or something waiting to pick ’em up.” “And then,” observed Porpoise sar­ castically, “they sends us home.” “No,” said Timkins. “W e gets carved for shark meat, I guess, as soon as they’ve had their fun. W e ain’t got a chance.” “I dunno,” said Porpoise. “Seein’ it’s you, Jed, you probably ain’t looked round for a chance too much. . . . A n ’ that reminds me, Jed. You owes me four quid. That time in Darwin when we was on a bender— ” “Four quid!” shouted Timkins. “I’ve lost my ship and I’ll lose my life, and you talk about four quid!” He checked himself as the comer hatch rattled off and a flood of tropical sunshine half blinded us. A Jap cal'ed down and Timkins sagged. “That’s for me an’ the boys.” he said dispiritedly. “Something’s com­ ing up again, I suppose.” At the hatch top he turned after the Jap had spoken to him again, and called Page 4 The Australian Women’s Weekly — September 16, 1944 A\n\n5. down: “You and Bill, too. The big boy wants you.” I got Porpoise to his feet and he wobbled a bit, grunting and groan­ ing. W e got on the bridge at last and the head Jap pushed us into the chartroom. Timkins already was in place in the bridge wing. One of his men stood behind the wheel and the rest were scattered over the ship. W e heard a low buzzing, growing louder, and the Jap came into the chart­ room with us and hooked the door half shut. “Very quiet, please,” he said grimly, and we heard the plane swoop low and circle the ship. I suppose Timkins did what was proper outside, for after a while the plane went away and there was quiet. The Jap opened the chart­ room door and ordered Porpoise out; then, shutting the door, he pointed at the chart table. “Is necessary I anchor near Cape Standon,” he said shortly. “Explain best place. Very close in.” I stared at the chart, one of our own from the Annabelle, and un­ readable save to ourselves. I bit my lip and wondered, and then laid a tentative finger on Tench Pass. The Jap nodded. “So good,” he said. “Very unpleasant if you arrange directions wrongly. Also very unpleasant for Captain Bailey. W e shall see.” He called Porpoise in and motioned me. with his gun, to stand against the bulkhead. Then he asked Por­ poise what he had asked me. Por­ poise bent over the chart and I sweated a moment. But he spotted the thumbnail mark I’d made across Tench Pass and tapped the same spot.” “The best,” he stated. “No one round an’ fair shelter.” I let out a breath, and the Jap looked hard at me and then at Por­ poise. Then he nodded, apparently satisfied. “So good,” he said. “You will pilot me through when it is light.” “Aye,” Porpoise agreed, coughing to cover what might have been a laugh. “It'll be morning afore you make th’ landfall. I’ll see you in. Be a pleasure, mister.” Since we had nothing to lose, it certainly would be a pleasure. There was a sweet shelf of mushroom coral at the head of Tench Pass and the Koomaloo would crumple like a concertina. O f course, we’d be shark meat, but so would the Japs, and that about evened things. “Did you sink the Annabelle?” Porpoise ventured as we were motioned outside, and the Jap grinned twistedly. “Not time to see. Many shells in her, captain. Perhaps be long sinking, but the drift would put her on bad shoals. A little sea break her up, I think. Very valuable cargo for ’Stralians. Great pity, no?” W e were herded back below. It was stiflingly hot. “I suppose you told ’em about the coast anchorages,” Timkins said, scowling. “Bill and me accommodated,” said Porpoise mildly. “Doin’ a better job’n you with your O .K . signals to the planes. You can say good-bye permanent to the Koomaloo, Jed. She’s got a date with thirty fathoms sheer.” “So you fixed it to pile her!” ex­ ploded Timkins. “Chucking ships about, what don’t belong to you.” “Which, seein’ she’s been falling apart these twenty years, ain’t much t’ talk about,” Porpoise grunted. A sudden thought struck him. “I’ll lay you a bargain, Jed Timkins. You owes me four quid from that Darwin bender. I’ll call it even if you ’ands me the Koomaloo.” “You’ll call it even—— ” Timkins stopped dead and stared, unbelieving. “You mean to say you want to trade my ship for four quid?” “She ain’t worth it,” agreed Por­ poise generously, “but I’ll take the risk. You swear over the Koomaloo to me afore these witnesses and I’ll call the four quid paid. W hat can you lose? You ain’t got the Kooma­ loo, anyway. Best chances are she’s due for the bottom t’morrow morn­ ing. So you trades something you ain't got to square a honest debt. ‘Most unpleasant,” said the leading officer. “But very fortunate you stay alive. You are captain, yes?” Give the boys in Brisbane something to talk about when we go back. Tim­ kins a-dying all straight with the world.” “Four quid! You robbing old sea cow. The ship’s worth-- ” “Nothing,” said Porpoise flatly, “and you ain’t got th’ brains nor nerve to make a try and save her. ’And her over, Timkins, and I’ll show you.” Timkins breathed hard, thinking. “You’ve got an idea?” he inquired cautiously. “W e ’re all in this to­ gether, y’know.” “I ain’t got any ideas yet,” Por­ poise swore, locking surprised, which meant he had. “I ain’t done much thinking yet.” “There’s a catch somewhere,” said Timkins profanely. “I know you. But maybe you can get us all clear. With By A lb ert R. W etjen that queer luck of yours, there’s no telling. I’ll take the chance.” “Now, that's better,” said Porpoise, chuckling. “Best deal you ever made, Jed Timkins Your ’ide ain’t worth a tanner as it stands, and the ship ain’t nothing but rust ’ung t’gether with condemned paint, and I’m tolerable enough t’ lay four quid on both of ’em , . . W hat’re you wait­ ing for, Bill? Look round.” So I made a rough survey of the shelter deck where we were confined. I found that there was a lot of scantling lying about—stuff that had been used to wedge and shore cargo. There were some matting strips, odds and ends of rope yam and line, and some of the scantling contained nails. I also found some lumps of coal that had been scattered round here and there, and that was about all. “It ’elps,” Porpoise conceded when I reported. “Now. ain’t there port­ holes in th’ ship, Bill? W e could stand some air. And ain’t there doors in the bulkhead leading to Number One hold?” “So what?” Timkins inquired. “You couldn’t shift a nut below here without a spanner and a maul. Must be rusied fast. A n ’ we ain’t got a spanner or a maul anyway.” ' “No, them Japs ain’t very help­ ful,” Porpoise agreed amiably. “W e ain’t got a spanner, so we gotta make one. Bill ’ere’s quite a handy m an.\" So I found some scantling about the size I needed and, placing one length on top of a port nut and another length below it, I lashed them hard and fast together, so the nut was held between the wood as in a vice. You had to be careful not to snap the wood with too much leverage, and you had to keep tightening the lashings as they stretched, but with care and patience you could worry a nut loose. I got one port prised up a bit after a while, so some air rustled in, and I got men started on the bulkhead doors. Timkms watched, spellbound, and light began to dawn on him. “See here, Porpoise,” he croaked. “I admit I never thought of that.” “You don’t say,” grunted Por­ poise. “Now you listen. W e get them bulkhead doors open and that lets us into Number One ’old. The ’atches are off Number One, as I spotted when I was topside, which being off is natural, since you’d just unloaded and was airing out. So we get on deck and bang the yeller rats and take charge again.” “As easy as that,” Timkins snarled. “And what about their guns?” “Sooner you bang ’em, sooner you get the guns,” Porpoise explained. “That idea ought t' get some ginger into your punches. Now it figures this way: You take all hands save Bill and our Wong Fong and me into Number One as soon as it’s dark. You waits until round the middle watch and keeps under cover until you ’ears a lot of yelling and banging round in here, with maybe some more yelling from the Japs on deck. Then you climb out and slam round, “Grab the bridge first, and tend to them lying round the alleyways. Send a couple of boys to the wireless shack to grab that, too. W hen it’s all cleaned up, you can take a snooze. Easy as that, Jed.” Timkins sighed. “I suppose it’s a chance,” he said sarcastically. It was a long day. Aside from hunger and the torments of thirst, all the myriad insects the old tramp harbored seemed to concentrate in the shelter deck and, by the time Porpoise judged things were ready to start, there was hardly a m an who was not in a mood bordering on the murderous. There was a lot of whispered curs­ ing and shuffling back and forth as Timkins sorted out his squads and gave them their orders, and then they all vanished through the bulk­ head doors into the darkness of Number One hold. Porpoise waited a bit, then he said, “Grab some sticks and some matting, Bill, and we’ll get the fire going.” So W ong Fong—he was our Chinese cook— and I piled a lot of the junk round and set light to it. Flames started to crackle and the shadows danced round the hold. Porpoise stood like one of those temple josses, his fat face bronze and glistening. “Better put it out. Bill,” he said at last. “Maybe the smoke’ll draw ’em better. They won’t see Timkins and th’ boys has gone, either, if they look below’.” W e got to work, banging and slap­ ping the flames out, and Porpoise let out some of his bull’s bellows and climbed up the spider ladder to hammer on the hatch. That started things all right. I guess, too, smoke was pouring out of the ventilators by now, and, anyway, there was a lot of screeching and a hatch was jerked off and a face ap­ peared long enough to get a good lungful of smoke. More screeching, and an officer came and shone a flashlight down, and one of his men hastily started lowering a hose.

Lost with brave men, very often. We know that these ships and men have had many other important jobs to do, besides bringing supplies of essential dress fabrics to Australia. But we’ve had a heart-stirring close-up of their bravery. It is a fine and timely idea of the “Australian Women’s Weekly” to produce this special issue as a tribute to the men in blue. With deep and sincere gratitude, we add our thanks to the thanks of this nation. P. S. If there is a shortage of Grafton uAnti-Shrink at presentit isn’t because the fap. subs, have been busy.

She disentangled the bread from the jam and the butter and planked it on the table. There were times, she pondered, when Pat’s exceeding wisdom would have been a trial to Solomon. But seri­ ously, could she blame Bill if he had to make a four for dinner with his senior officer’s niece? Pat unswallowed a handful of bobby-pins and mumbled dreamily, “Lieutenant William Jones seems to have a lot of senior officers lately, and they all have a fine crop of nieces.” New Sparkle and EnergyYou can snap your fingers at war strain, business worry or family cares, and regain your normal sparkle and energy quickly and easily.

After all, there was nothing she could say. There emanated from the bedroom a couple of bars of “M y Gal Sal” and then Pat un­ burdened the result of her lengthy meditation. “It all comes from working in a reference library. Beats me how you can go for a ruin like that. Hosiery may have its snags,” she giggled, “but at least I get someone alive to talk to occasionally . . . Funny English boy in this morn­ ing. Told me I looked like a film star and would I help him to find two pairs of stockings for his mother. I gave him some ‘Sahara Nights,’ ” she finished, meditating afresh. “D ’you think I ought to have given him ‘Boogie Woogie Beige?’ ” “Even,” remarked Janet de­ liberately, “if you are my cousin, it doesn’t necessarily follow that hosiery runs in the family.” Pat hooted at her as she came in hooking up her dress. She picked up the book beside Janet’s plate idly. “U-huh . . . another night with ‘Applied Psychology.’ Really, Jan. do you have to choose such lurid books?” Janet caught sight of herself in the mirror over Pat’s head, and she said suddenly, “I’m not a very lurid person, myself.” Smooth brown hair in a neat roll, pinkish little mouth, a grey dress, and glasses perched rather precariously on a sensible nose. Unaccountably her voice shook a little: “Perhaps that’s why . . . ” Pat laboriously hooked the largest strawberry out of the jam. “Listen, Jan, why don’t you come down off that pedestal and try being a dame —like me— for a change?” Janet had recovered control of her voice “Maybe,” she considered absently. “D ’you think I could?” The strawberry being successfully transplanted to a slice of bread, Pat looked up. “Could what?” “Be a . . . a dame for a change.” “ ’Course, provided you can tuck that brain of yours away somewhere nice and deep and forget about it.” She grew interested like a child with a new doll. “Listen, I ’ve got a ticket somewhere for some theatre party, and I can’t go.” She dashed i n t o the other room, knelt beside a drawer, and tumbled things about. “Here it is!” Janet laughed, shock her head, took a hurried gulp of tea, and a lump in her throat came up to meet it. They fought it out. “1 didn’t mean it,” she spluttered helplessly. “Yes, you did,” said Pat firmly. “You wouldn’t want to let the lower deck down, would you?” Janet dumbly signified her com­ plete disinterest in the Navy, upper or lower deck. Pat thumped her on the back with more ferocity than was necessary. “There. Now if you don’t go, there’11 be one poor sailor with no hand to hold.” Janet wiped her eyes, visualising this tragic possibility with an emo­ tion that more resembled laughter than sorrow. “Most unpatriotic,” grumbled Pat, “Now, let’s see, you can wear my red dress and my white coat . . .” “But what’s wrong with my . . .” “I,” said her adversary danger­ ously, “have had enough of those errh . . . ‘garments’ of yours.” “And I’m two inches taller,” mur­ mured Janet weakly. “That’s the idea. You know I always wondered what your legs looked like above the ankles!” ‘But . . “Sit down,” roared her tormentor, “so I can fix your hair!” Half-an-hour later Janet took a look at herself in the glass, and winced. Her brown hair twisted and drooped in a startling, elaborate roll about her forehead. Large barbaric earrings hugged her ears, and her nice intelligent mouth was a scarlet gash. “Behold!” yelled Pat, dancing ecstatically round, “A Dame, and Mine Ow n Creation!” “You,” broke In the Creation, absent-mindedly reaching for her glasses, “sound like Pygmalion with Galatea.” Pat waylaid the glasses just in time. “Now giggle!” she commanded. “W h — what?” “Giggle, you know, like this. Oh, and every time you come to a ques­ tion you don’t know the answer to, just giggle. And if he starts getting technical about how he runs the war, just bat ’em.” “Bat ’em?” “Like this.” Pat flipped her eye­ lashes vigorously up and down. “That’s all you’ve got to remember— bat ’em and giggle!” Thus it was that the newly in­ augurated Dame made her way to her seat in the dark. Despite her sedate temperament, the spirit of ad­ venture still occasionally flared with­ in her to her distress. So to-night By . . . Australian author MINA GRAY she just let it flare. She took off Pat's white coat and settled herself. “Well, glad you got here,” a voice at her elbow whispered. She took a deep breath and said, “Are you?” and she remembered to giggle coyly. The voice went on talking, \"Mother should have told me this was my lucky day,” and it called her “Pat.” Janet started guiltily. He took her hand. “Y ’know. I always did suffer from cold hands; d’you mind?” “I.” she responded pointedly, “would hate the Navy to have cpld hands, particularly as it doesn’t seem to suffer from cold feet!” She heard him laugh softly. It was an impu­ dent sound, that unaccountably made her blush in the dark. W hen interval came she stole a glance sideways and found herself looking direct into two delighted blue eyes. She started to tell the eyes that she wasn't Pat, and then some for­ gotten devil of make-believe inside her took control. He said, “I shouldn’t be here, you know. It ought to be Dick. That’s how I knew your name. He met you last time we were in, didn’t he?” “Well?” murmured Janet hesi­ tantly. “D'you think you can put up with me instead?” “Oh,” said Janet, agonisedly, “I’ll try . . .” “Good kid.” No one had ever called Janet that before. She thought about it seri­ ously for a while, then, “W hat,\" she queried, “happened to— errh— Dick?” “Ashamed to report he got tanked on the way up town.” “Tanked?” “Piffled, ossified, three sheets.” “O h,” she said, and thought with despair of the reference library. It appeared there were subjects it did not cover. In fact a whole range of subjects. The second feature drifted vaguely before her eyes. After it was over, he said, “Let’s go and snare some supper.” They found a large, showy place, and yelled at each other through the successful efforts of a band to create the effect of life in the jungle or on the invasion coast. He yelled, “You know, you’re dif­ ferent to what I imagined.” And she shouted back before a trumpet got in first, “So you thought about me, did you?” “You bet. Sailors always make up ideas about the girl they’re going to meet in the next port.” She said, “O h ,” rather crestfallen, but remembered to giggle just in time. Then the trumpet hit its target. She said. “It seems unimportant, but what do people call you. and what— errh— do you do on the boat?” He came back with, “The nam e’s Phil, and I thought someone told me you knew uniforms like Joe here knows spaghetti. On the— Oh, Lady!— ‘boat.’ I’m just an A S .” “Tell me about it, d’you like being a sailor?” she flung in. “Sounds like a radio interview. I just love being a sailor.

He felt absently in various poc­ kets, produced his hand­ kerchief, and wiped the spray from his face, slowly, contemplatively. Then he motioned to Bill. “Take it awhile, will you, French?” “Yes. I’d like to start by run­ ning closer to shore north of the pier.” “Got an idea?” “Well, it was about there that Peckham’s body was found. History might repeat itself.” “Okay. It’s all yours.” Steve crawled back over the engine hatch cover. He passed the absorbed Mrs. Peckham and sat down beside Bundy on the rear cushioned seat. He slid an arm round her, put his face close to her soft, blowing hair. Bundy turned and looked at him. After a minute he took his arm away, moved off half an inch. He began to whisper. His expression suggested contrition, cajolery, the establishment of an armistice. Bundy remained vastly unin­ terested. But every time he pre­ sumed on the effect of his sales talk and moved closer one glance from her hard eyes moved him away again. She was certainly something, Bill thought, stealing furtive glimpses now and then. There was the bril­ liance of fire about her fascinatingly shaped face with its smouldering eyes, its disdainful lips. He re­ minded himself it was none of his business, and turned his attention to the water. The motor slowed as he steered north along the shore, half a mile out. The receding tide made it easier to see depths which were covered at high water. Presently he sighted something white on the bottom, to the star­ board. He leaned over the side of the boat. The object was a sort of pillar about six feet long. Something was lettered on it in black. Num ­ bers, letters. As the boat passed almost over it he read: Bill shook his head, pointed to his ears. Steve looked up wonder- ingly for a minute, then went on whispering to Bundy. She gave no signs of weakening. After a while Steve crawled back over the hatch to Bill. 26 Ave. It was one of the town’s cement street markers. But what was it doing out here? It couldn’t have been here long or it would have been too covered with barnacles and weeds to be legible. He sighted its position with relation to the land. Not far from the entrance to Coffee Pot Bayou. As he moved his eyes to the south he met the gaze of Mrs. Peckham expressing interested ignorance. “Did you see something just then in the water?” sure how far he wanted to trust her. And she was a talker. He could tell Steve later. But meanwhile the police should be informed. Bill got a third of the attention of a young officer. He wasn’t sure the man really heard a word. He was so incensed at Fishy Jo’s in­ solence. So determined to wring out of him the real facts. Withdrawing. Bill saw a familiar face fighting its way down the stairs from the street level of the pier. He went to give his aunt a helping hand through the crowd. “I hear they found the boat, my dear,” she panted, emerging into the open. She twisted into place her rumpled dress, pushed the hat up off her nose. “Is that true?” “How in the world did you get here so fast, Aunt Olive?” “I was up town shopping. I heard the newsboys shouting and bought a paper. Is that the boat?” She pointed with her lorgnette, then stared through it. “Yes.” “How about what’s-his-name’s body? This Albert Sinclair. I sup­ pose that’s whom the ‘Bert’ means? Have they found him yet?” Bill looked at her fondly. After all, she was his devoted relative. W hy should he be forever holding out on her? He pulled her ear close. “Aunt Olive, can you keep a secret?\" “Of course.” He looked her in the eye. “This is serious. I mean really.” “Now look here, William.” “All right. I just wanted to be sure. This is it. They won’t find Sinclair. Not out there in the water.” “What? William!” she squealed. Then remembered to lower her voice. Her eyes glittered. “M y dear, have you found him yourself?” “Sh-sh. Not yet. But I ’m hot on the trail. And it does not lead to the water.\" Mrs. Paige glanced mysteriously toward the water. “Then this mes­ sage printed on the seat of the boat — it can’t be a confession after all?” “No.” “But this man— this Fishy Jo person—says-- ” Please turn to page 24 ECZEMAand Old SoresPainful irritation of Eczem a, a n a long- lived Sores that just won't go, should be treated with the deep-penetrating, cleansing, a n d healing action of Flexibar Ointm ent.

Bill could have told him what he thought. That she was only build­ ing up to spring that college idea of hers on him. But he said noth­ ing to prepare Steve for the blow Let them fight it out between them. Interfering in love affairs was not his hobbj. Steve took the wheel. “I sort of thought you found something in the bay a few minutes ago, French.” “Hey, watch out!” Bill shouted. “Collision ahead.” Several smaller boats were steer­ ing erratic courses in front of them. It took dexterity to avoid trouble. Steve put for the open water. He laughed wryly. “I’ve got a hunch this is all hooey, French. Just one of Fishy Jo’s pranks. He is probably doubled up at all the rumpus he’s causing.” “He picked a nice day for it,” Bill said lazily. For an hour they swerved in and out among the other searching boats. Then Steve took a run up toward Gandy Bridge and ran aground. It took fifteen minutes to pole thejboat off a sand-bar. W hen they came south again they saw a number of boats gathering in one spot. Steve stood up, swung the Pelican toward the excitement. But before he had gone far he noticed the boats were all turning toward the pier. He changed his course and swerved out in a wide, fast circle that cut in ahead of most of the others. “That’s Fishy Jo’s old smack.” Steve pointed 'to a single-masted, spinach-green vessel sliding along in the faint breeze. Behind it bobbed a very small white rowing boat. “They seem to have found the skiff, at any rate,” he admitted. “Though I wouldn’t put it past Fishy Jo to have printed that message himself, if there is one, for his own amusement. He hates the police.” A small agile launch containing policemen was darting in and out among the boats, urging everyone not to land, “W e haven’t found the body yet. W e need plenty of boats to hunt for it,\" one hoarse-voiced m an roared in entreaty. Corinne insisted on Steve’s con­ tinuing the search. She showed signs of hysterics. Bill said, “I’ll drop Bundy at her house, Steve. I have to get out too.” Steve was very reluctant to con­ tinue hunting, but was overwhelmed by Corinne’s opposition. He watched Bundy climb out on the landing stage of the pier. He whispered to Bill: “Watch out for her, will you? That was a hard knock the poor kid got.” Bill promised. The rowing-boat had been brought in to the landing stage. Fishy Jo’s dirty craft rocked against the piles. It perfumed the air with its ancient odor. Fishy Jo himself smoked cigarettes and laughed impudently in the red faces of the questioning police. He had told all he knew, he repeated over and over. Bill said, “You in a hurry to get home. Bundy?” “I don’t care what I do.” She put a hand to her head and walked away toward the end of the wharf. Bill had remembered the sunken street marker.

COMMODORE JOHN AUGUSTINE COLLINS Commander of the Australian Naval Squadron. -He is the first graduate of the Royal Australian Naval College to attain the rank of Commodore (First-Class). frequently, with his secretary Commodore J O H N C O L L I N S First Australian to hold operationai command o i R.A.N. He is the first Australian to attain the highest fighting command in the R.A.N., and the first Australian to attain flag rank in the service of his country. During m y weeks at sea with a number of ships of the Royal Australian Navy, and particularly aboard the flag­ ship Australia, I was able to talk with and study John Collins, sailor. I soon knew and liked his charac­ teristic smile, quick-wittedness, and unusual sense of humor. Officers a n d By ratings do not re- REG HARRIS sent the limelight that has fallen on War this one man— Correspondent rather, they like it. Naval men know that Commodore Collins accepts any praise that comes his way on behalf of his team. Perfect in his attire, he is meticu­ lous as to detail, and expects every member of the flagship’s comple­ ment to be the same. He strongly objects to photographers depicting unkempt, ruffled-haired, untidy sailors as “typical seamen.” \"You can judge a seaman’s quality by the care he takes in his dress,” he told me. But that is not the only secret of John Collins’ success. Not for personality alone was he the youngest cruiser captain in the Mediterranean. Ask any man in the R.A.N., and he will tell you: “Collins is a sailor — a real sailor!” To the man at sea, that means something. He is an individualist— it is noticeable in his every movement, word, and action. Wherever he is, John Collins dominates the company —unintentionally, but naturally. His manner is so completely easy that one does not notice this at the time. In action the Commodore spends his time between the bridge (where he watches the progress of the ac­ tion) and the tactical plot (where he plans his tactical orders). He determines and controls the speeds, course, disposition, and so on of the ships under his command. Throughout he is in consultation with his Staff Officer, Operations. He has his sea cabin in close proximity to the bridge, and is on the spot in any emergency. His food is brought to him by stewards. In port or harbor he lives in the Commodore’s quarters. He messes with the Captain (his Chief of Staff) and the Flag Lieutenant (his aide) (a paymaster-commander). The Commodore has his own gal­ ley, cooks, and stewards. He is an excellent host. Many of the Allied Army, Navy, and Air Force chiefs in operational areas enjoy his hospitality when the flagship is in harbor. Pictures are shown on the quarter­ deck every night while in harbor, and Commodore John Collins is quite a keen fan. He loves fishing from the Com­ modore’s barge, and frequently takes some of the flagship’s officers with him. He prefers trolling to the monotony of angling. Sometimes he catches fish! He takes every opportunity of going ashore to “stretch his legs”— a process which entails a few miles’ walk. He keeps fit by playing deck tennis on the quarter-deck each afternoon with the ship’s officers. W hen exercising during the first and last “dog watches” (4 pjn. to 6 p.m., and 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.) he wears white sandshoes, short white socks, and white singlet. The strenuous days of 20 years ago, when he was an outstanding R.A.N. Rugby Union and tennis player, have given him a well-built stockiness characterised by broad shoulders, narrow hips and muscular legs. After his daily exercise, the Com­ modore visits the ward-room to have a drink and informal chat with his officers, then showers and changes into formal attire for his dinner. Mess jackets are always worn at dinner in the Commodore's Mess. After four years at the R.A.N. College, Midshipman John Collins served with the Grand Fleet in 1917-18, and became a sub-lieutenant in 1919. Thirteen years ago, Admiral Sir Edward Evans described John Col­ lins as one of the most brilliant gunnery officers who ever served under him. Collins supervised the construc­ tion of H.M .A.S. Sydney (launched in 1934 as H.M .S. Phaeton) at New- Tyne, and commanded the vessel on her maiden voyage to Aus­ tralia, retaining the command until 1937. W hen war broke out he was Assistant-Chief of the Naval Staff in Melbourne. From November, 1939, until May, 1941, he again took over as captain of H .M .A .S. Sydney. In June, 1940, Captain Collins reached the peak of his fame, when the Sydney sank the faster, more heavily armed Italian cruiser, Bar­ tolomeo Colleoni. John Collins never forgets a face, nor the name of any m an who has served in one of his ships. Many a rating has been surprised when the Commodore has asked him, “how long is it since you left such-and- such a ship?” The Royal Australian Navy will never forget John Collins— a man capably fitted to carry out the honor bestowed upon him. /^B IM O D O R E (1st I Class) J O H N W A U G U S T I N E COLLINS, Companion of the Order of the Bath, Cross of Knight Com­ mander of the Order of Orange Nassau, has made history in the Royal Australian Navy. John Collins was born at Deloraine, Tasmania, in 1899. I, like most of the Aus­ tralian public, know much of his history in the Senior Service— his brilliant fighting and administrative record. But few know what kind of m an he is at sea.

September 16, 1944 The Australian Women's Weekly 15 i am s \"-THE SAW a special correspondent from an interview with an Australian Naval Officer A naval officer should be able to handle any eventuality. Instructors during officers' training courses have been saying this for decades. You realise after two years' service in the Wavy Navy (R.A.N.V.R.), half the time overseas, that any odd job can come your way, and does. Even acting as nursemaid to a three-year-old baby on an Allied warship! That, I blushingly confess, happened to me. Sarcastic callers S O did a lot of other odd jobs. These included serving as doctor, dentist (ex­ tractions only), and general welfare officer to scores of once-removed headhunters. And acting as a pidgin English in- trepeter, and appearing in the triple role of architect-builder and com­ manding officer of a naval station in the jungle of a South Pacific island. X remembered my instructor’s ad­ monition when I took on my first odd job. The captain of an Allied base asked me to go as pidgin interpreter to an outlying island to buy fruit. Even with my limited pidgin it seemed an easy job. But no naval officer, no matter how astute, could anticipate being left actually carry­ ing the baby on such a mission. O n landing on the island I was met by two Australian missionaries who gravely informed me that typhus was sweeping the island. They took me to their house and produced San. San was a three-year-old French baby left in the mission’s care when “W I T H a pair of pliers you remove the molar . . her parents had gone south for a holiday. Her parents were to have returned on the monthly steamer, but the missionaries, with the epi­ demic on their hands, could not spare the time to take San back in their lugger. Then with Australian directness, as one Australian to another, they suggested I take San back home to her island near our base. W hen I demurred, and suggested it was a matter for the captain, they showed me the new graves in the cemetery . . . Getting San out to the ship in a wherry through a heavy surf was a tough job. W e were both soaked to the skin, not that it was difficult for San to get soaked to the skin. She wore a lap-lap only, and her sole pos­ sessions were a spare lap-lap, tooth­ brush, and soap. Leaping up the companionway with San in my arms, I passed her to the bos’n. “Hold her until I see the captain,\" I said, ignoring his somewhat bel­ ligerent, “What! Me, sir?” X took the same line with the cap­ tain that the missionaries had taken with me. The captain was prac­ tical. “W ho will look after her, will you?” I agreed with faint enthusiasm. Feeding, washing, bedding-down, and keeping a three-year-old baby out of the way on a warship is quite a job. I did it for a whole day which seemed like a week. San captivated every sailor on the ship on her first day aboard, and for the rest of the voyage, another day and a half, the off watch took her over. A few hours before berthing I searched the ship for San and found her in the C.O.’s cabin having her hair brushed by the captain! Leaving the ship San had enough gear—presents from the crew—to fill the small motor boat which ran us across the harbor to her island home. I was dismayed to find the house empty. The inter-island ship was a week late. Navy.” attention. An old native arrives with his face swollen with an infected tooth. With a pair of pliers you remove the molar, to the accompaniment of loud wailing from the victim and high glee from the other natives. Your knowledge of medical prac­ tice does not go farther than a very elementary first-aid course. But you use “sulpha” drugs like a specialist. You look at the label giving the directions, and try to ignore the warning, “This Drug is Dangerous.” You are amazed that you get so many cures of skin complaints by slapping on whatever happens to be available in the field kit. Cooks and stewards don’t get drafts to naval establishments in the South Pacific. So you teach a native boy to cook and make up your cot. It’s a tedious job. You explain many many times to the cook boy how to make a dish. You leave him to carry on, only to come back in half an hour to find a horrible-looking mess in the pot. And making a bed. I did not think it was possible to get so many permutations and combinations in laying two blankets, two sheets, a bed cover, and a woven leaf mat on a stretcher, without getting one sheet on top of the other. Training and teaching natives to keep a naval station ship-shape shakes one’s morale plenty. But it was nothing to the effect on my morale on being posted to a base and finding myself in the course of duty at a military ceremonial dinner, attended by four Generals, an Air-Commodore, and a British Colonial Governor, who carried the ranks of both Vice-Admiral and General. I discovered that as the junior naval officer present I had been made vice-president of the dinner. On the president rising and saying, “Mr. Vice, the Toast,” I had to rise and propose the toast of His Majesty. It was rather shattering to a wavy-navy lieutenant, that the next ranking junior officer to himself was n0 less than an air-commodore. The book that every girl . . . and her mother . . . should read! “I found San in the C.O.’s cabin, having her hair brushed.” Mostly they seek medical fJ^HERE was only one thing to do— take San to my hut at the base and put her In a spare camp- stretcher. Very few officers called on me at night, but that night I had dozens “having a peek.” Toward midnight my patience had worn thin to such gibes as “You catch ’em pretty young, don’t you?” and “Waiting till she grows up, huh?” Near morning came tne answer to the problem. There were three nurs­ ing sisters at a mission hospital 25 miles away at the other end of the island. With San in a jeep I drove there at dawn. The kindly sisters took over my charge. W hen you move to a forward battle area plenty of odd jobs come your way. You have a couple of tents and your gear.

G U N N E R Y IN S T R U C T IO N for sailors at Flinders. There’s a saying in the Navy that “a gunner’s-eye view of a ship is a floating gunnery platform.” By BETTY NESBIT Seagulls and sailors on bicycles were my first im­ pressions of Flinders Naval Depot when I spent a week there to see how Australia trains her sailors. Three thousand men trained yearly now From the old rose-garden shel­ tered behind a clipped hedge, the sea would seem far away if it were not for the seagulls, which settle in white clouds on the parade ground, fly up and down the narrow lane between the sleep­ ing quarters, and flock in hundreds around the galley doors. PETTY- OFFICER J. I. R O B IN ­ SON, of Melbourne, riding at Flin­ ders, where everybody from the Commander down bicycles about. electrical and ordnance artificers, stokers to the engineering school, ■seamen to the seamanship classes, stewards and writers to their classes, and cooks to the galleys. Most picturesque sight of all this training is provided every morning at precisely 8.30, when a small fleet of whalers puts out from the wharf at the depot. Manning the boats are future sailors getting their first taste of seamanship, all lads whose ages range from 18 to the early twenties who have just joined the Navy. At the end of the wharf, which seethes with blue uniforms and white caps, stands Lieutenant-Com- mander D. P. Croft, R.N., disciplin­ ary officer for the New Entries. • From him they learn what to do, and, most important, what not to do when one is a sailor in the R.A.N. In the various schools the raw recruits are continually working with old hands ashore for a spell. For example, in the bakehouse I saw recruits working along­ side men such as Leading-Cook Albert Rees, of Victoria, who had been ashore only a few weeks. T H E bicycles are as much a part of Flinders as the seagulls. Every member of the Depot’s staff either rides a bike or is fond of walking. Dis­ tances between the buildings are long, and an officer on his rounds rides at least five miles. His bike has stripes equivalent to rank painted across the rear mud­ guard. But for all this riding about, Flin­ ders people never forget for a moment that they are at sea. The complete phraseology of shipboard life is observed by all. At first it sounded a little odd when, driving through wide iron gates into a leafy lined road, I heard the escort officer reporting, “Press party coming aboard, sir.” W hen war broke out Flinders began to stretch its limbs. It has grown from a depot where 1000 men a year were leisurely trained in peacetime to a base responsible for training three times that number. This is indicated in the new build­ ings. Two-thirds of the accommodation blocks are new, the hospital has been extended to twice its size. Wrans’ quarters have been built. A group of temporary buildings comprises the Officers’ Training School, which is one of the depot's wartime babies. The largest part of Flinders is the New Entry School. Recruits enter Flinders for a four months’ course, which in peacetime was a year. The first month is spent entirely in a disciplinary course, in which they learn naval routine, terms, procedure, and drilling. They are drafted to their various schools according to the category in which they came into the Service— T O R P E D O SC H O O L.

Recruits at Flinders Naval Depot have 20 minutes’ boat- pulling exercise each morning to teach them how to handle ship’s boats. In civilian life a sleeper-cutter, Leading-Cook Rees has been a cook in the Navy for four years. He was serving in an Australian corvette which took part in the invasion of Sicily. “It was stew for two days in suc­ cession,” he said. “Made it one day and put a top on it for the next day.” Gunnery school T W O brass dolphins coil them­ selves round the door-post lead­ ing into the gunnery school, where I met Lieutenant-Commander R. J. V. Hodge, R.A.N., who came ashore from H M .A .S . Australia eight months ago to command the school. “To be a gunner in the Navy is to be the salt of the earth,” said Lieut.- Commander Hodge. “Only the rating with superior intelligence is picked for gunnery training.” O n a tour of inspection Lieut.- Commander Hodge showed me ratings being instructed on a load­ ing teacher, replica of a gun in H.M .A.S. Hobart. He pointed out another class which had commenced with 15 men and after a few weeks had decreased to 10. “In gunnery a man has to know his job perfectly. No gunner at all is better than a bad one,” he said. O n another machine known as a Rypa men were learning how to direct the fire on to a target. The machine, which carries out the motions of a ship, is named after the initials of the words Roll, Yaw, Pitch, and Alteration of course. I learnt from Lieut.-Commander Hodge that a ship does not have a band just to play martial music. The ship's band is a most import­ ant section of the gunnery crew. The bandsmen are the fire-control ex­ perts. They are chosen to be bands­ men because they are musicians in the first place, but as such they must learn fire-control. The -gunners’ mates who instruct the gun crews have a jargon all of their own. For instance, I heard this from one instructor: “Should the gun misfire the gunlayer shall not say ‘----it!’ nor shall he dwell a pause of two hours and double away for his tot of rum or grab the jaunty (master-at- arms) by the lower band (belt) and ’eave ’im over .the side, but order ‘Still! Misfire. Carry on.’ ” This said at top speed at a roar seems to work wonders with a back­ ward class. Typical of the wartime speed-up in training is the course at the cookery school. Head of the school is Paymaster-Lieutenant W . J. Honey- bunn, R.A.N., who has been in that job since 1929. The course used to be 26 weeks; it’s now eight, four weeks in the galley and four in the bakehouse. Every cook has to know how to bake bread. Sailors eat a lot of it. In two years 277 cooks have gone through the school. “No previous experience neces­ sary,” said Lieutenant Honeybunn. “I’ve turned expert bricklayers into cooks in my time.” There are five sections of officers training at Flinders— officers known as Jogs (Junior Officers, General Services); Junior Reserve Officers; Senior Reserve Officers; newly mobilised officers, such as engineers, doctors, or dentists; and Naval Auxiliary Patrol Officers— in addi­ tion to the cadet ratings in the Officers’ Training School (O.T.S.), and the W Jl.A.N.S.

Occasionally in peacetime a “man came up through the hawse pipe” (which is the naval expression for a sailor reaching officer’s rank), but this was so rare that special arrangements were made for his training. But in wartime more ships are built and more men are needed to officer them. The O.T.S. was instituted in July 13, 1942, to train these officers. The commanding officer of the school is Commander F. R. James, R.A.N.,“formerly in command of an armed merchant cruiser, H.M.S. Kanimbla. His is the job of seeing that in less than a year a man learns what in peacetime would take four years. “The men who come to us may have been at sea for months and have been recommended by their commanding officer,” he said, “or men in the New Entry School who have a sufficiently good educa­ tional background may be selected as candidates for an officers’ course.”\n\n18. 18 The Austrofion Women's Weekly September 16, 1944 EDITORIAL OUR TRIBUTE TO THE NAVY YjyE have devoted this issue of The Australian Women’s Weekly almost entirely to the Royal Australian Navy. The fighting ships of the R.A.N. have worthily upheld the great tradition of British sea power. Their task has been greater than that of defending Australia’s shores. They have been in every ocean, playing an important part in the war strategy of the Allied Nations. The articles and pictures in this issue give a vivid picture of the lives of officers and men. The Naval Board gave special facilities to our representatives to spend some weeks aboard fighting ships. These representatives saw and recorded not only the serious business of war at sea, but also the youthful gaiety and comradeship that make each ship of the R.A.N. such a happy community. The Australian Women’s Weekly warmly recognises the help the Naval Board lias given us with these arrangements. We feel privileged to be able to devote our resources to showing readers what the spirit of the Navy is, how it is developed and maintained. H IS T O R Y .

C LA SSR O O M S, where the future admirals of Aus­ tralia carry on their studies, are in a trim red-brick build­ ing set in wide green lawns. A great deal has changed at Flin­ ders during war years, but training of the cadets continues in its cus­ tomary peaceful manner, untouched by the wartime extensions, addi­ tions, and speeding-up. It still takes four years at the College to train a young man to be an officer in the R.A.N.; and it is these cadets, boys aged from 13 to 17 (who are addressed as “Mr.”), who will eventually command its ships. There are 64 cadets at the College. This is the usual number, and at the end of the year, when the fourth- year term leave and go to sea as cadet midshipmen, 16 new cadets join the first year. I met. the Commander of the College, Commander A. J. Loudoun- Shand, O.B.E., at afternoon tea in his cabin. Commander Shand, who stands well over six feet and whose com­ plexion has the ruddy tan of a man who has spent years at sea, ex­ plained to me how the cadets are chosen for the College. “Each year a selection board comprised of naval officers, medical men, and professors sees the pros­ pective candidates. “W e personally interview the boys and we know the kind of lad who will make a good officer,” said the Commander. He told me of the College’s pride in men like Waller, Rankin, Walker, Moran, Burnett, and Getting, who commanded ships in this war and went down with those ships. “These men were cadets at this College, and the spirit which prompted them to fight against overwhelming odds is the spirit fostered in our lads,” he said. Accompanied by Mr. H. D . Simp­ son, who is the Director of Studies and who has been at the College for 20 years, I went on a tour of inspection of the classrooms. My first sight of the cadets was at their history lesson. Their mas­ ter is Mr. F. B. Eldridge of the pro­ fessorial staff, who has taught his­ tory to every officer in the Royal Australian Navy. He joined the staff in 1913 when the College opened at North Geelong. The history room has a frieze of drawings of ships of all kinds from vikings’ ships with brightly colored sails to the modern destroyers. Mr. Simpson explained to me that although these lads were training to be officers in the Navy, 'their four years at the College were filled with lessons and study. “A solid education is as necessary to them as the knowledge pf hand­ ling ships,” he said. They learn bends and hitches from a man who joined the Navy in the time of Queen Victoria. He is 64-year-old Chief Petty-Officer John McKay, D.S.M., who was in Her Majesty’s Navy in 1896. Two sfca cruises a year in the training ship Bingera are, how­ ever, the most popular items in the year’s programme.' These cruises introduce the lads to their future habitat and acquaint them with middle watches, mal de mer, and other minor sailor troubles. The seamanship classroom is the cadet’s introduction to knots and splices, anchors and cables.

On the lawn outside the class­ rooms are set up the gear for taking soundings, and also the special type of naval dropping gear for slipping ship’s boats. The cadets study this equipment, but learn its practical use when at sea in the training ship. Emphasis is laid on all kinds of sport, not so much to produce a brilliant international cricketer pr footballer, but so that each cadet will have a good knowledge of all. Bosun in Physical and Recrea­ tional Training is Mr. Allan Salt- marsh, who has been in the Navy for thirty years. I met this instructor while he was giving a lesson in fencing to one of the two “Year Officers,” Lieuten­ ant W . F. Cook, R.A.N., who recently came ashore after overseas service in H.M .A.S. Nizam. The other Year Officer is Lieu­ tenant Robert R. Brown, R.A.N., who had also been in one of the “N ” class destroyers for the last two years. A Year Officer is detailed to look after the general well-being of the cadets, instruct them in the tradi­ tions of “an officer and a gentle­ man” in the Royal Australian Navy, and teach them seamanship and boatwork. The two Year Officers also ar­ range the sport for the lads and organise the two dances which are held each term. These dances and the pictures on Saturday night (that is, if the picture is considered suitable) comprise the cadets’ social life. Four cadets share a cabin, which is austere with white painted bunks, an upper and a lower, and chest of drawers. “Wakey-wakey” (Navy’s term for the bugle which blows reveille) is at 7 a.m. The lads take a hot splash, but this mast be followed by a cold shower even if the thermometer is down to zero.—B.N.

September 16. 1944 ________________The Australian Women's Weekly _______________________ 19 Sm all sliips are happy ships and do a big job DINNER- TIME in seamen’s mess of H.M.A.S. Bendigo, a corvette. In these ships each trade group (seamen, engineers, stokers, and so on) conducts its own mess. * Men prefer them though quarters are cramped and work is dangerous The smaller ships of the Royal Aus­ tralian Navy— sloops, frigates, corvettes, and Fairmile motor launches — do the lion's share of the work at sea.

He was the late Sir Charles Kingsfortt Smith’s navigator. • j Unlike the cruisers and destroyers, they have very few periods \"in harbor\" or at bases.

Men fire at a floating target towed in the wake of the ship. E V E R Y sailor to whom I spoke, regardless of the size or type of his vessel, gave un­ stinting praise to the work of the smaller ships and _ asked, “W h y don’t they get some publicity? They work all the time, and take far greater risks than the more heavily armed ships.” It seemed strange to me at first that most sailors would gladly forsake the spaciousness and compara­ tive comfort of the cruisers to get aboard one of the smaller craft. It didn’t make sense that anyone would willingly make his lot harder at sea. He would be more restricted In movement in the small ships, would not eat as well (supplies of fresh meat and vegetables are very re­ stricted in comparison), would be at sea longer, would enjoy few of the amenities provided by the bigger ships (movies, concerts, deck hockey, and boxing), and, with much less armament, would be more vulner­ able to attack. « All my surmises were wrong! Now that I have travelled in operational waters in all types of craft of the R.A.N., I can appreciate the wisdom of the sailor in his selection. He knows he will become a mem­ ber of a small and happy family. The duties of sloops, frigates, and corvettes are escort patrolling with convoys, mine-sweeping, submarine detection, and bombarding of enemy shore positions.

A number of R.A.N. corvettes are attached to the Eastern Fleet, and six of them carried out the mine- sweep off the coast of Sicily to pave the way for the Allied landings there. Nearer home, their work has been even more arduous and continuous. Pride in their doings should be the greater because they are Aus­ tralian-built. The work done by H.M .A.S. Bendigo since she was commissioned on May 5, 1941, is typical of that of her sister corvettes. Suicide patrol O E N D I G O arrived at Singapore in September, 1941. With the Japanese right on her heels, she was one of the last ships to leave Singa­ pore, on February 8, 1942. She went to Palembang (Sumatra) and Batavia, but was chased out of both places by Japanese warships and aircraft. To enable evacuees to gain safety, Bendigo then did a “suicide patrol” in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java. She had been bombed in Singapore, and on this patrol she was constantly subjected to dive-bombing. Fortunately, she suffered nothing worse than near- misses and a few shrapnel scars. She arrived back at Fremantle on March 8, 1942, carrying 117 evacuees, officers, and ratings, among whom were survivors of H:M .S. Prince of Wales and H.M .S. Jupiter. After a week in port she carried out patrols off the coast. By May, 1942, she had arrived in Newr Guinea waters, at the height of the Jap invasion, and was at work in the Buna-Oro Bay area on the day that Buna fell to the enemy. Since then, apart from long- spaced visits to the mainland for re­ fitting, etc., she has had a full-time job in enemy waters. Bendigo is known among her personnel as “Old Faithful.” The small ships are always to the fore as the enemy is gradually and relentlessly driven back. They have played a large part in the sucoess of the New Guinea campaign. They have a still greater role to play, and every crew member is eager for the fray. Movement on the small ships is particularly cramped. Every bit of space is utilised for some part of war ordnance. There is barely room to swing a skipping rope. Any other form of exercise is out of the ques­ tion. When seas are rough, none know it better than the small ships’ crews. They have to be super-sea­ men. Corvettes carry five or six officers and 80-odd ratings. The command­ ing officer is usually a lieutenant. H.M .A. Fairmile motor launches, which carry three officers and 14 ratings, are used for submarine chasing and strafing of enemy shore positions. They ‘are petrol-driven. Built in Australia, they are cool and very compact. The ratings’ mess and living quarters are com­ bined. Four days’ fresh water supply,is carried for drinking and cooking purposes only. Showers can be had only from an improvised saltwater pump on deck. Known as the mosquito fleet, the Fairmile motor launches are com­ manded by lieutenants, all of whom, with the entire ship’s company, are reservists, men who volunteered from all types of civilian jobs. Average age of the Fairmiles’ crew is 20 years. Fairmiles have been of great value in rescuing crews of aircraft shot down into the sea, evacuating sick and wounded soldiers from beaches and rivers, survey duties, reconnais­ sance, going cut at night on danger­ ous barge-busting operations, shoot- ing-up the Jap supply and personnel barges which creep close in to the shore under cover of darkness. “Q ” Boats (harbor defence motor launches) are even smaller than the Fairmile motor launches, but In New Guinea have been doing a similar job. While the cruisers and destroyers are doing the spectacular work of the R A N . at sea, and figuring in the news for their part in naval battles, it should not be forgotten that the small ships are doing their part—essential duties for which only they are suited.—R.H"
