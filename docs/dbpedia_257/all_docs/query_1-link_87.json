        "text": "TO-MORROW IS H.M.A.S. SYDNEY'S DAY\n\nTenth Anniversary ot\n\nSpada\n\nSpada\n\nTEN YEARS will have passed to-morrow\n\nsince H.M.A.S. Sydney sank the crack Italian\n\ncruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni off the coast of\n\nCrete. The Sydney was commanded by Captain\n\nJ. A. Collins, R.A.N., now Vice-Admiral Collins,\n\nC.B., First Naval Member of the Australian\n\nNaval Board.\n\nSome of the incidents of the short, but dra\n\nmatic, battle, one of the earliest of many stirring\n\nengagements in which ships of the Royal Aus\n\ntralian Navy took part in the Second World\n\nWar, are recalled.\n\nDAWN broke calm and clear\n\non July 19, 1940, on the seas\n\nround Cape Spada, the northern\n\nmost tip of ancient Crete. But\n\nthe scene was soon to be set for\n\nhigh adventure. One of Musso\n\nlini's proudest treasures was to\n\nreceive mortal wounds and fall\n\nvictim to a ship belonging to one\n\nof the youngest and smallest\n\nnavies in the world.\n\nShortly after the sun had risen,\n\nH.M.A.S. Sydney, commanded by\n\nCaptain J, A. Collins, R.A.N., and\n\nattached to the 7th Cruiser\n\nSquadron, was steaming with the\n\ndestroyer Havock 40 miles ncrth\n\nof Cape Spada on a special mis\n\nsion. The two ships, together\n\nwith four other destroyers, the\n\nHvnerion. Ilex, Hc-- and Hasty,\n\nhad left Alexandria the previous\n\nday.\n\nThis was part of a plan for\n\ncountering the activities of\n\nItalian submarines in areas\n\nthrough which British convoys\n\nhad to pass, and for destroying\n\nItalian surface ship' :ng.\n\nFirst Sight\n\nUDDENLY Hyperion radioed\n\nan enemy report. Two\n\nenemy cruisers had been sig:_Led\n\n10 miles away, almos't straight\n\nahead.\n\nImmediately Captain Collins\n\nteceived the report he began\n\nto close the destroyers and or\n\ndered the engine-room of the\n\nSydney to begin working up to\n\nfull speed.\n\nOnly 21 days had elaspod since\n\nthe Sydney, while helping to pro\n\ntect an important convoy near\n\nSicily, had helped deal with three\n\nItalian destrovers, two of which\n\nescaped. The third, the Espero,\n\nafter putting up a stiff fight, was\n\nalmost totally disabled and the\n\nSydney finished her off.\n\nA fortnight later the Sydney\n\nhad taken part in the success\n\nful battle against the main Ital\n\nian fleet off the coast of Calabria.\n\nRushed On\n\nON this calm, clear morning,\n\nthe Sydney rushed on at full\n\nreed to meet the two enemy\n\ncruisers.\n\nBy the time the Sydney sighted\n\nthe enemy the men were all\n\nclosed up at stations, standing\n\nready, confident and cheerful and\n\nkeen for the fight.\n\nAt that stage Captain Collins\n\ncould not determine the identity\n\nof the Italian ships, but shortly\n\nafter the action had begun he\n\nrecognised them as being of the\n\nBartolcmeo Colle-ni class. They\n\neventually proved to be the Bar\n\ntolomeo Colleoni herself and her\n\nsistership the Giovanni Delle\n\nBande Nere.\n\nThe Sydney was a vessel of\n\n6980 tons, with a speed of ' 2'\n\nknots, carrying eight six-inch\n\nguns, eight four-inch guns, anti\n\naircraft guns and smaller arma\n\nment. The Bartolomeo Colleoni\n\nand the Giovanni Delle Bande\n\nNere were each of 5069 tons, with\n\n.. speed of 37 knots, carrying\n\neight. six-inch guns, six 3.9-inch\n\nanti-aircraft guns anrd smaller\n\narmament.\n\nThus the Sydney had mount\n\ned against her double the num\n\nber of similar calibre guns she\n\ncarried herself, and also suf\n\nfered the disadvantage of lower\n\nspeed.\n\nThe engagement began between\n\nthe enemy and the destroyers\n\nbefore the enemy and the Sydney\n\nhad seen each other. The first\n\nshots were fired by one of the\n\nItalian cruisers.\n\nIt was a running action in\n\nwhich the four destroyers were\n\nmatched against two modern\n\ncruisers equipped with more an-.\n\nheavier guns.\n\nSurprised Them\n\n1HE SYDNi.L appeared to the\n\nenemy's su\"-)ri- and con\n\nsternation. She opened fire\n\n20,000 yards. Almost simultani\n\neousl- the Hynerion, Ilex, Hero\n\nand Hasty appeared on the Syd\n\nnev's disengaged bow, st.ering a\n\ncourse to pass ahead of her and\n\npractically at right angles to the\n\ncourse the Italians were taking.\n\nThe Bai _olomeo Colleoni and\n\nGiovanni Delle Bande Nere,\n\ndismayed by the arrival of the\n\nSydney and H-\"'oc!k, and by\n\nthe picture of six ships ste m\n\ning almost straight at them at\n\nfull speed, turned tail and fled\n\n-,u'hward, making thick snok\n\nto hide their movements.\n\nZut fire from the Sydney and\n\nC 2 destroyers followed them.\n\nIt was a thrilling chase. The\n\nSydney and the dest.royers\n\nraced on like horses at the\n\ngallop. Still the Italian ships\n\nsped on, fearful and desperate.\n\nThe Giovanr, Delle Bande\n\nNer , the first of the retreatir,\n\ncruisers, had by this become ob\n\nscured by smoke, and Captain\n\nCollins, whose target she had\n\nbeen, transferred his lire to the\n\nBartolomco Colleoni. The des\n\ntroyers also resumed firing.\n\nThe enemy now began pouring\n\nout more and more smoke. The\n\nBattle of Cape Spada had become\n\nj deadly game of hare and\n\nhounds.\n\nFor a minute or so the Sydney,\n\nwhose shooting had been taking\n\ngood effect, held fire while the\n\nrange was shifted back to the\n\nGiovanni Delle Bande Nere.\n\nThen, w.hen she became hidden\n\nin smoke, the Bartolomeo Collc\n\nc_.i again became the target.\n\nTwelve minutes elapsed and\n\nthe range had been reduced to\n\n17,500 yards. The Sydney was\n\nplacing round after round where\n\never she wanted it. Shell after\n\nshell was going home, and the\n\nBartolomeo Colleoni was receiv\n\ning terrific punishment.\n\nEnd Was Approaching\n\nTHE Bartolomeo Colleoni had\n\nstopped, only live miles\n\nfrom Cape Spada. A shell had\n\nburst right in her engine room,\n\nmost of her lights had gone out\n\nand the horror of utter black\n\nness had enveloped many of her\n\ncrew. The Giovanni Delle\n\nBande Nere did not stay to give\n\nassistance. She dashed away at\n\nhigh speed and disappeared\n\nThe end of the Bartolomeo Col\n\nleoni was now fast approaching.\n\nThe Hyperion closed in on the\n\nship now lying helpless in the\n\nshell-torn sea with 100 feet of\n\nher bow blown off by a tor\n\npedo.\n\nThe Hyperion. at short range,\n\nfired another torpedo which hit\n\nher right amidships with a roar\n\nwhich seemed to lift her in the\n\nwater. She settled down,\n\nsteadied for a moment or so and\n\nthen went down.\n\nDashing in, the Hyperion,\n\nIlex and Havock began picking\n\nup survivors, who numbered\n\n545 out of the Bartolomeo\n\nColleoni's original complement\n\nof 630 officers and men.\n\nSet Pattern\n\nTHUS came to an end a battle\n\nwhich had been one of the\n\nmost spectacularly dramatic\n\nevents in the history of the\n\nR.A.N. It was the first cruiser\n\nduel of the Second World War;\n\nit was a duel that set a tactical\n\npattern for all other duels to\n\ncome.\n\nBut it was not the finish of the\n\nstory.
