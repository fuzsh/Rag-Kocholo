That 10 armor is a beast to hit for anything not also packing 18/18/17/15. Yamato should be near 74-5, Musashi shouldn't be 4 points cheaper than that...probably -1 or -2 compared to Yamato. ShoGo adds a whole new layer of chaos to the game and should easily be 3 more points than base-Yamato if not more. Tsushima should cost more than Montana does currently, but the current +8 over Yamato is probably fair. That would put her at 82-83 by my counting.\n\nThe Iowas to me are more fairly costed. If Yamato went up 4 points, I think the Iowas could go up 2 each easily. I think Iowa is the yardstick so if you move Iowa you have to adjust the others too. I think compared to Iowa, Missouri is no more than +1 (certainly not +5), New Jersey at +2 is probably ok, and Wisconsin is probably +1 or +2.\n\nSoyuz is harder because while it has the 10 armor, it has comparatively weak guns and only 2 attacks. To me Soyuz is probably right, maybe +1 to where it is now...can't squeeze 3 of them in a 200 point game and that is ok. Even though it is hull6, Soyuz vs. Tirpitz or Soyuz vs. Marcantonnio is not that lopsided a battle.\n\nFdG has the super-vital, but also has the weaker guns albeit with ER5 and AA9. Flag1 though almost ruins the pot. Flag2 or no flag would certainly be better. I think FdG should tuck right behind the Iowas -and so I would probably actually lower it a point or keep it the same.\n\nAlsace...I would add one point just so the 3x in 200 points wasn't possible. Like Soyuz, Alsace just doesn't play that differently from the other Hull5's particularly the bargain-hunter's dream: Richelieu. The French have more advantages elsewhere in their fleet, so Alsace is actually a bit limiting for them.\n\n_________________\n\nLight a man a fire and he will be warm for a night.

If battleships are too cheap overall as they are, higher costs for 5-hull ships would make these ships cost even more.\n\nIf the goal is to balance out one pool of points with another, theoretically you should be able to expect to be able to destroy one side with the other sometimes. So how can one reasonably expect to destroy six hull points?\n\nWith torpedoes, you need to throw 36 of them. You can do this with a swarm that can launch 15 of them the first point of contact, then lose 2 ships with torpedoes each turn until you piddle out eventually. 15+11+7+3 would be able to put 36 torpedoes on target over 5 turns, but how can I cheaply get 15 torpedoes on a turn?\n\n8 Edsalls cost 48 points but with no range-2 torpedo that's not so good. Gwin is 2/2/1 at 7 points and 8 of those cost 56 points.\n\nAnother way to try would be with stouter but more expensive hulls. 2/2/1 UK cruisers in the 9-12 point range would be more durable and might only lose one the first turn of contact and then 1.5 the other turns. To get 36 torpedoes you could roll 13+11+8+5+2, you would need 7 cruisers to do this which would cost 63-84 points.\n\nTorpedo bombers! A 24-point carrier with 2 land escorts and 3 torpedo planes like the Avenger costs 76 points. But of course you'd want the Catalina to spot so that makes 83. Aborting 1 per turn you'd get 6 base torpedoes, 2 for BB Killer, 2 for Shadowing, and 1 for Expert. With 11 torpedoes each turn you could expect a kill in 4 turns, which is a turn faster than the other options.\n\nJapanese cruisers in the 17-point range are a good option also, rolling 2 each and only needing 3 hits to sink a big boy seems enticing. Put Chikuma in at 21 and they all roll 3 dice. You could get those 3 hits in one turn with 18 dice, but that's 5 cruisers and Chikuma, or 106 points. No wonder that's not a winning strategy. But, using the UK decay progression 10+7+3 would get you there with 2 or 3 cruisers plus Chikuma. 3+C is 72 points.\n\nSo just to kill 6 hull points costs 56, 63, 84, 83, and 72 points. All of that is inside of a bubble where you ignore the rest of both of the fleets and the mercurial nature of torpedoes. Going with the median of those numbers, 72, seems like a reasonable floor for the cost of six hull points.\n\n_________________\n\nCapt.

These reviews took longer to write than I thought they would and I didn't want to release them all too quickly, but yikes...\n\nSet I established the basics of War @ Sea and had some really good units to start the game off with solid footing, but the game really evolved very heavily with Task Force. A couple new nations were introduced, and the existing ones expanded upon. A WotC mandate forced RB to use a large number of reprints and that affected unit selection to a high degree. Right out of the gate there were some units that immediately obsoleted sister ships from Set I or made them much less attractive. Also the costing structure for units started to adjust and while some units benefitted greatly, others have been readjusted again in later sets to find the balance we're at today.\n\nAs a reminder these are the units that I still see regularly used in fleets in my games of War at Sea as well as those I most frequently choose myself. I will also be applying a grade to each unit rating its overall usefulness when constructing fleets for that nation.\n\nObviously these are my thoughts and opinions - please feel free to add your own or discuss my reviews/grades below! Disagreement is welcome (civil)!\n\nAustralia\n\nHMAS Arunta - Retroactive Grade: A- - Even though the Arunta was not the first unit to have Close Escort it was (and still may be) one of the best. The excellent base stats of the Tribal class paired with its low cost of 7 points makes the Arunta a very nice addition to many UK/Commonwealth fleets. This unit was also one of the reasons for the shake-up of the Clubhouse as the allure/danger of CE and the USN caused a sort of panic in the ranks of the other clubs. In retrospect, I think that CE is one of the most highly valued SA's for players, but ultimately can play as a bit of a paper tiger. It looks better than it actually is. The Arunta on the other hand, brings such a solid DD package along for the ride I can't think of a place to downgrade it, other than to note that the team decks in particular have added other options for CE that have taken some of the shine from Arunta.\n\nCanada\n\nHMCS Haida - Retroactive Grade: B - Overshadowed in popularity by the sister above, Set II's other Tribal class is still a fantastic DD in her own right. She gets SA boosts for the two things DD's do best - hunt subs and kill other DD's. Plus as a Tribal the base stats are already solid.\n\nFrance\n\nDunkerque - Retroactive Grade: A- - Richelieu is easily the class of the BB's from set one and still remains one of the top BB's in the game. Dunkerque is a perfect pairing. Representing the smaller Battlecruiser size of ships, Dunkerque packs a massive wallop for the cost. Better AA than Richelieu (8 vs. 7), Better base guns than most of the other 30 point BB's (14/13/13/11) further bolstered by excellent spotting, and TD with no slow. Dunkerque is the light BB version of Richelieu. Her downfalls are in the armor/vital/hull area, but they are in line with her cost and the offerings of other nations and so she does not get penalized for these. Great Ship.\n\nNetherlands\n\nVan Galen - Retroactive Grade: C - Another CE ship, Van Galen is a very solid DD. Other than Close Escort she doesn't do anything special, but she does bring 5AA and 2/2/1 TT line to the CE gig. I don't see her as often as I used to, but she is a favorite of both of my face-to-face regular opponents for good reason. Like Arunta a bit overshadowed by later CE offerings, Van Galen still deserves a good ranking.\n\nUnited Kingdown\n\nBarracuda - Retroactive Grade: C+ - The best native attack plane the British offer in WAS, Barracuda does a bit of everything well while not doing anything spectacularly. A Dive bomber or a Torp Bomber, Barracuda costs a premium for the flexibility, but has an ok bomb load, a respectable TT load and a good ASW load to bring. It also has Determined Attack to help it get through enemy AA, but the 8VA can struggle to hold up - especially against the KM AA values. It really shines when it has spotters and excellent abilities backing it up, but the switch-hit ability means it is always useful. The big drawback for the Barracuda is its 1943 availability date. By the time the Cuda comes into play most every other nation is rocking their top air and anti-air as well.\n\nHMS Illustrious - Retroactive Grade: B - HMS Illustrious is quite possibly Britain's best carrier in the game. 5/11/4 with TD and 8AA she can be very tough to take down for opposing air. She also brings EXCELLENT SA's to the table with EDF and ET to pair with Sneak Attack. While Sneak Attack works better for the IJN and Kaga, having Illustrious use it to boost Barracuda and/or TBF Avengers is quite fun - not so much so for Swordfish. The two knocks I have for the Illustrious are that she is only a CAP2 and that Britain really doesn't have the native planes to take maximum advantage of what she brings to the table.\n\nHMS Jamaica - Retroactive Grade: B- - Jamaica brings another highly valued SA to the UK lineup in \"Flotilla Leader\". Providing a big boost in initiative, when the UK fleet deploys with her already very useful DD's, the Jamaica is a nice support piece. She is also one of those pieces whose other SA's and stats are out of sync with the main SA-based use. Jamaica has Chase which helps her get into the fight quicker and 2/2/1 TT, Cruiser Hunter, and 7AA which all give you reasons to get her in the thick of things. She's also a high-value target and somewhat fragile in the front lines. She can useful in speed rushes, air builds, anti-swarm roles. A ship of many talents. She grades a bit low for me because of her high cost - but I don't really feel she is over-costed. At 15 points she is a pricey cruiser. She can quickly pay for herself with the init boost, but she is also fairly fragile for a cruiser at that cost and often becomes a target for early destruction. Her value in both of her roles as an init booster or a front-line battle unit also tends to decrease as the match goes on.\n\nHMS King George V - Retroactive Grade: C - The namesake of her class, KGV's major contribution to the usefulness scale is her low cost. At 51 points, she is the least expensive 9/15/5 BB. Protected by TD, 7AA, and no slow she could be VERY close to the UK answer to Richelieu if it wasn't for the 2nd worst SA in the game - Jammed Mount (HMS Hood has the worst...). No matter how deserved, the SA is simply too damaging when it triggers. However, the risk can often be worth the rewards. KGV is a stout ship that is tough to bring down. So long as JM doesn't trigger, you get a strong BB for a weaker BB cost. That cost savings is the highlight of the entire class. Her class-mates all grade out about the same in my book, so they probably will not get special mentions of their own, but each of the three currently in the game (KGV, PoW, DoY) does different things well, and each is a nice value addition to many UK fleets.\n\nHonorable Mention - HMS Warspite. I really wanted to include her, but it would be for sentimental reasons. As a gamepiece she's been passed over for awhile. LS6 is a neat trick, but it rarely works, and even in 1939, there are bigger better badder options.\n\nUnited States\n\nHonorable Mention - B25 Mitchell - Like Warspite, some neat tricks, but most PB's have a tough time cracking into the full on usefulness line.\n\nF6F-3 Hellcat - Retroactive Grade: B+ - I think the Hellcat has gotten MORE useful as the game has gone on as her enemy fighter killing abilities have become more needed (Me262). Being a carrier borne \"super-fighter\" with the all important escort ability, the Hellcat serves mostly the same role as the much cheaper and very close F4F Wildcat. But when taking out the top planes of the opposition is important the Hellcat is a cut above. Able to benefit from both EDF2 and the ability to fly every turn from a carrier, the Hellcat is nice step up from the F4F. The extra cost is troublesome, but generally I end up taking a few F4F's for light duty and a few F6F's to disrupt my opponent.\n\nTBF Avenger - Retroactive Grade: A - A core unit of the dreaded USN air smash, the TBF Avenger has the potential to rip the heart out of your opponent in one turn. 3 TT + BBKiller and Boostable from ET and PBY boosts, the Avenger and a mutli-6 roll are every non-USN players' nightmare. The 4 ASW natural doesn't hurt either, and just in case the opponent goes DD swarm on you - one turn of 7 bombs is nothing to shy from either. Even though it has only a 5 armor, the 9VA helps keep the TBF around far longer than most nations' torp bombers. I wish I had success with this plane like I've seen from others. My TBF's struggle to get through and then when they do seem to forget what it takes to get a torpedo through to the enemy let alone mutliples, but the potential potency is always a major threat.\n\nUSS Cleveland - Retroactive Grade: B - One of the best USN cruisers for the cost, it still amazes me that the Cleveland was an uncommon. 5/10 A/VA, 8AA, strong mains, good 2nds, and an SA that defeats an entire build archetype! The only thing the Cleveland lacks is what most USN cruisers lack - Torps!\n\nHonorable Mention - USS Hoel, USS Laffey. Both DD's are solid options for the USN. Both possess a trio of complementary and useful SA's for a cost of 9 points. Sadly, I rarely see either one of them used. Most USN fleets find places other than DD's to spend the points, and these two are just too expensive and not available soon enough to dislodge new options from preference.\n\nUSS Massachusetts - Retroactive Grade: A- The workhorse BB for the USN. A vanilla unit whose purpose is crystal-clear. Fantastic gunnery, good AA, and good armor, the only downside to the USS Massachusetts is its low VA of 14. Many 8/14 BB's exist, but USS Mass brought the first 9/14 we had seen. It makes her more vulnerable to a vital hit, but her very large main guns also make her more likely to deliver that vital hit first.\n\nHonorable Mention: USS San Francisco- the USN's flotilla leader. Solid ship done in by high cost and the high cost/late availability of the best DD's. SF shines best in early war games, but the DD's in those games come with several warts of their own. 6AA for a ship so expensive is hard to stomach.\n\nHonorable Mention: USS Saratoga - speaking of 6AA on an expensive ship. Sara is hard because she has all 3 expert abilities on one package and that package is up-armored and up-gunned. Fights like a cruiser, but unfortunately fights like a USN cruiser - no torps, weak AA, and no TD to help her hang around.\n\nUSS Yorktown - Retroactive Grade: C To date, the only EdF2 fleet carrier for the allied forces (Eagle and CAP1 doesn't really fully count), Yorktown also brings EB and Damage control to the air builds of the US. EdF2 makes Yorktown a nice choice for a single carrier, or a air-cover type carrier for the USN.\n\nI added the European Axis.\n\nGermany\n\nAdmiral Scheer - Retroactive Grade: B\n\nThis reset the point scale of the Deutschland class and made vitalling stuff all the more likely. In the new rules this piece gives you the best chance of vitalling an Allied destroyer.\n\nBf. 109 - Retroactive Grade: A\n\nThe Axis answer to Wildcat, a highly affordable carrier fighter with Interceptor and high survivability that sees the table almost every time German units are fielded.\n\nGraf Zeppelin - Retroactive Grade: A\n\nCruiser guns on a cheap carrier with 8 AA. Key piece in KoD or the single-sector Tirpitz, GZ, Z 20 with 9, 8, 8, 7, 5 AA shots thanks to a pair of 109s (see above). Hard to hurt and even harder to kill.\n\nKarlsruhe - Retroactive Grade: C+\n\nIt's a 10-point flotilla leader with 2/1 torpedoes, so that's good. It's hard to get +3 for fewer than 31 points but you can with this and three T27s.\n\nS-Boat - Retroactive Grade: C+\n\nIf I play a patrol boat, it's the one with armor two.\n\nTirpitz - Retroactive Grade: A+\n\nA sickeningly high AA score is the shell that protects one tough battleship. This is important because you can attack from 5 sectors away on turn two. It certainly helps that you get 13 dice to do that with, or equivalent to what a lot of battleships throw at range 5. Oh, you also can have Flag 2 so you can position yourself for the killer blow. Do all of this for only two points more than Bismarck, which itself is an attractive piece.\n\nU-66 - Retroactive Grade: B+\n\nIf you like U-510, this upgrade gives you Elusive Quarry too.\n\nThis was the last hurrah for Germany, the last good real rares were pumped out in set two and in the same set the first fantasy ship sailed as well. Looking back, if RB had kept some goodies in the storehouse for the Kriegsmarine probably the game could have gone on a bit longer.\n\nItaly\n\nEugenio di Savoia - Retroactive Grade: B\n\nIf you haven't tried EdS, Haguro, and your favorite Close Escort destroyer in a sector you are missing out. Put that on the objective on turn two. You get 8 attacks to fend off challengers.\n\nSM. 79 Sparviero - Retroactive Grade: A+\n\nHow else can you throw 8 torpedo dice with only one unit? You can do that with a single Sparviero against 3 damaged targets in the same sector. Triple Emily and Double Chikuma can buff this to 6 dice against the first target, 4 against the second target, and 3 against the third.\n\nThis looks bad compared to the wealth that Germany got. But, I don't see tournament units in the remaining pieces.\n\nJapan\n\nTo be continued..."
