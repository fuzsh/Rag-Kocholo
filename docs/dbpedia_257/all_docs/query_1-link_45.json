I started in 1998 with a basic list that I pulled off of the web. That list had been compiled by Hugh Stegman, a highly respected radio hobbyist and columnist for Monitoring Times. A special \"Thank You\" to Larry Van Horn for the section on NASA callsigns. In the intervening years I have added callsigns that I myself have heard and verified as well as those from various seasoned , respected milcomer s and HF utility communications hobbyists here in the US as well as Europe.\n\nOne should take most military calls with a grain of salt. They are often used by more than one unit. Also, the US military is closing bases left and right, moving and combining units, transferring tasks to the reserves, and the like.\n\nA callword is a station identifier without numbers, such as Mudbug Control. A callsign is one with numbers, such as Abnormal 10. Static callsigns/callwords of air tankers tend to associate with gasoline, gas stations, or fuel in general, though the association gets pretty vague. Fighters are more macho. A few callsigns/callwords are acronyms, such as ARIA (Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft), Joint STARS/JSTARS (Joint Surveillance Tactical Radar System), SPAR (Special Priority Air Resource); and SAM (Special Air Mission).\n\nMany CPs, Air National Guard or CAP units, and the like, derive callwords from geographical characteristics of their locations, i.e AK-SAR-BEN (Nebraska backwards, and a popular horse track), MUDBUG (near the Mississippi \"big muddy\" delta, where mudbug crabs are found), and HIGH ROLLER (Nevada ANG, Reno).\n\nAIRCRAFT CALLSIGNS:\n\nThere are several systems that I have noted over the years.:\n\nTransports: Callsign + 1 or 01 is usually the unit commander s callsign. Callsign +2 or 02 is usually the deputy unit commander. Reach callsigns suffixes are usually either a mission number or some variation on the aircraft tail number.\n\nFighters:\n\nThe following is from a knowledgable source: As far the numbering convention is concerned, the 11, 21, etc. is usually either based on the go of the day OR the the flight within a go . To explain, a go may usally consist of 12 jets. Of those 12, there may be three formations. Therefore, we normally assign the numbers of those formations as a sequence, i.e. 11-14, 21-24, and 31-34. Where there are multiple flying squadrons at a base, they assign each squadron a series of 3 numbers, 0-8. Therefore, the same number suffix should not be flying with more than one formation at a time. This is also helps controls and pilots recognize their callsigns on the radio, especially if the radio transmission is clipped. For example, if all that is understood was (radio static) 71, descend and maintain 3 thousand , one would still know that the message was for callsign 71 and not callsign 51. The 91 callsign suffix is usually reserved for checkride sorties.\n\nNOTE #1: TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, THE CALLSIGNS IN THIS LIST ARE FROM UNCLASSIFED SOURCES---NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION HAS BEEN KNOWINGLY INCLUDED IN THIS LIST.\n\nNOTE #2: Some of the callsigns were taken from aircraft Mode S tranmissions as copied by listeners with the approproate equipment. These callsigns are entered by the flight or ground crews. As such one sometimes sees things like \" F-15s Suck\" or \"A-10s Rule\" in the callsign block. I have added those callsigns that seem to \"make sense\" to the list in hopes that they are valid callsigns however, with the usual caveat.\n\nNOTE #3- I HOPE THIS LIST IS USEFUL--BUT UNDERSTAND IT IS AN EVER-CHANGING \" WORK IN PROGRESS'. I have tried to keep up with unit moves, deactivation, etc but I'm positive I've missed some. I WELCOME ANY CORRECTIONS/CHANGES/ADDITIONS.\n\nCREDTS/THANK YOU---Credit to Mike Chace Ortiz for idents on the US State Dept calls. I've included them because they periodically show up on USAF HF-GCS nets. Thanks to Jack Daw in the UK for the UK/Europe callsigns. Thanks to Larry Smith from Ventura CA for updates & corrections on West Coast callsigns.\n\nNot included in this list are the daily-changing callsigns used by the E-6B TACAMO, E-4B ABNCP & the AMC transports & tankers.\n\n================ ===== ============================================\n\nAAEC LSV-1 USAV GEN.
