        "text": "United States\n\n16-inch Guns\n\nHerald, Washington, March 22.—In view of Japan’s rejection of the 14-in. limitation, the Navy high command has decided to mount 16-in. guns on the twin 35,000-ton battleships to be laid down this summer, officers disclosed last night.\n\nJapan’s rejection of a British proposal to ad­here to the 14-in. clause in the 1936 London naval treaty was announced by the official Japanese news agency yesterday. Officers said the develop­ment caused them “no surprise.”\n\nDespite inspired denials in the Japanese press, reports persist in Washington naval circles, that the 1937 Japanese naval program calls for one or two 45,000-ton “floating fortresses” mounting 18-in. rifles.\n\nJapan had until April 1 to announce her in­tentions regarding the 14-in. weapon. Informa­tion here was that the rejection was based on the Tokyo Admiralty’s belief that the limitation was “not in the interest of peace.”\n\nIn anticipation of that attitude, the Bureau of Construction had prepared specifications on hulls for 16-in. guns to be available to shipyards March 30.\n\nOfficers said the guns will probably be mounted on three turrets, two forward and one aft. The Projectiles are expected to be able to pierce 2 feet of enemy armor plate at a range of 16 miles.\n\nOf the American Navy’s 15 battleships, only the Colorado, West Virginia, and Maryland carry 16-in. rifles.\n\nTwo of Japan’s 9 battleships carry 16-in. guns, 7 have the 14-in. size. Britain has 2 mounting 16-in. and 13 carrying 15-in. guns.\n\nReserve Examinations\n\nStar, Washington, March 14.—Stiffen­ing of the examinations of Naval Reserve officers for promotion in the commissioned grades is indicated by the Navy Depart­ment as a result of consultations between representatives of the Examining Board and the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department. It was indicated in the rec­ommendations made as a result of the conference as adopted, that the tests to be taken by the Reserve officers will be com­parable to those of the regular establish­ment, so far as practicable.\n\nAs the Reserve officers, in the event of call to active service in time of emergency, must perform their duties with the same diligence as regular officers, it is believed it is the purpose of the department to assure itself Reserve officers can be de­pended upon to do this by taking the same tests as regular officers.\n\nIt was recommended by the conferees that questions for line candidates for pro­motion to commander and captain be con­fined to the subjects of general instructions, training, and inspection, organization and administration and recruiting and ad­ministration, or in the cases of engineering duty only, tests on recruiting and admin­istration be omitted and tests on marine engineering and electricity be substituted.\n\nFor grades below that of commander, it was recommended the scope of examina­tions for officers of the regular establish­ment be followed. They also recommended in the case of engineering officers who are candidates for promotion to commander and captain they be asked essentially the same type of questions in marine engineer­ing and electricity for both grades. When the proposed changes are approved they will be included in the manual of examina­tions.\n\nBecause of the addition to the Reserve of large numbers of college graduates, it is not expected that the changes, if made, will hamper the efforts of the Navy to keep its Reserve personnel up to the full complement now permitted by the appro­priations. As a matter of fact, there are now in the Reserve many officers who were trained at Annapolis and were graduated. Some of them left the service because of more opportunities in civil life, while some were forced out because of the reduction of the Navy during the beginning of the depression period. However, these officers, or at least many of them, retained their connection with the Navy by accepting commissions in the reserve establishment, and the Navy considers them as valuable assets in the growth and efficiency in this branch of the service.\n\nBecause of this proposed stiffening of the examination, reserve officers will have to spend considerable private time in keeping up with the progress in the naval establishment in all its branches, as the drill period requires all of their time for the training of enlisted personnel. There is little time for them to study during this period.\n\nBattleship Machinery\n\nSun, Baltimore, March 21.—Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, U. S. Navy, chief of the Bureau of Engineering disclosed today the de­velopment of a new high-pressure boiler, to give American battleships a more deadly striking power, greater speed or more armor.\n\nThe boilers are the product of the naval experi­ment station at Annapolis, Admiral Bowen said, developed in the course of experimental work to improve the motive power and decrease the machinery weight in battleships.\n\nThe new German Navy has concentrated on developing high-pressure and high-temperature boilers in its new ship construction and other sea powers are experimenting along the same lines.\n\n“With the new boilers and turbines designed,” Admiral Bowen said, “we estimate we can save 400 tons in weight in the construction in battle­ships.”\n\nThat 400 tons could be used either to give the ship a knot and a half more speed at high powers, or to add another 14-in. gun, or to increase the armor of the ship.\n\nThe two new battleships to be started in June are limited by treaty to 35,000 tons, thus every pound saved in construction may be utilized for installing additional equipment or armament.\n\nAdmiral Bowen also disclosed that the Navy has been concentrating on other methods to save valuable tonnage in construction of new ships.\n\nOne method has been through reducing the weight of electrical installations, which comprise 15 per cent of the total machinery weight in a battleship.\n\nBy saving weight the Navy has been able to step up the speed of the new battleships to be­tween 26 and 27 knots, to increase armor for protection against submarines, mines and air­plane bombs, and add new devices for increased efficiency.\n\n? ? ?\n\nVarious Notes\n\nThe Navy’s last “time ball,” old-fashioned aid to mariners, is about to drop for the last time.\n\nTime balls, located atop poles on high buildings in seaports, were used to signal the correct time to ships in port. Promptly at noon the ball would drop, and watching mariners would set their chronometers.\n\nBut radio time signals have largely supplanted the devices, and recently Captain Lamar R. Leahy, the Navy’s hydrographer, revealed that he had requested a survey to determine whether San Francisco’s ball, the only one still in opera­tion, is serving any useful purpose. He strongly hinted that it will be scrapped.\n\n“It costs the Navy $200 a year to maintain the ball atop the flagpole on the Hotel Fairmont, on San Francisco’s Knob Hill,” Captain Leahy ex­plained. He believes the device, which once signaled noon to clippers from the China coast, is chiefly used now by a few old-time San Fran­ciscans to set their alarm clocks.—Star, Wash.\n\nFour new U. S. Navy destroyers have re­turned here with damages, including cracked plates, from unusually rough weather met in “shake-down” cruises, naval officials disclosed yesterday. Although it is not determined whether faulty construction is wholly or partly respon­sible, they denied a statement made Monday by Harry B. Ahrens, Kings County (Brooklyn) com­mander of the American Legion, that 3 of the vessels would have to be reconditioned at a cost of $2,500,000 because of faulty construction.\n\nSome structural changes will be made in the destroyers Mahan, Reid, and Cummings, it was explained, because they were found advisable as a result of earlier “shake-down” of the Flusser, which is a new destroyer of the same class. Naval officers familiar with the destroyers estimate the changes will cost not more than $100,000. It was pointed out by naval authorities that “shake­down” cruises aim purposely to bring out struc­tural defects.\n\nThe Mahan and Cummings, both launched in 1935, were constructed by the United Dry Docks Co. at New York. The Reid launched in January of 1936, and the Flusser, launched in 1935, were built in the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. yards at Kearny, N. J.—Star, Wash. New York, March 31.\n\nThe Navy Appropriation Bill carrying $526­555,428 for the fiscal year 1937-38 was passed by the House of Representatives today after success­fully weathering a minor storm of amendments, chief of which was the unexpected proposal that President Roosevelt be “authorized and re­quested” to call an international disarmament conference.\n\nAs it goes to the Senate the measure provides or an increase of 5,000 in the Navy’s enlisted personnel and appropriates $130,000,000 for con­struction on two new 35,000-ton battleships, 11 cruisers, 48 destroyers, and 17 submarines. The bill also carries $29,186,000 for an airplane con­struction program designed to put 397 new navy airplanes in commission a year from June 30 Herald Tribune, N. Y. Washington, March 5.\n\nThe Appropriations Committee in reporting , the 1938 Navy Appropriation Bill to the House today questioned the wisdom of continuing with four Congressional appointments to the Naval Academy, and suggested the need for further legislative consideration of the Navy’s line officer situation.\n\nThe committee turned down the proposal for construction of two wings to Bancroft Hall at a cost of $1,000,000. The 1937 budget carried an item of $750,000 for this work, but Rear Admiral Norman H. Smith explained during hearings on the bill that estimates of the cost of the proposed work had increased $250,000 since last year.— Sun, Baltimore. Washington, March 2.\n\nThe Navy Department today announced that bids for two new 35,000-ton battleships, costing 60 million dollars each, will not be opened until the first week in June. Original plans had called for bids to be opened Monday and to have keels of the new ships laid by June.\n\nThe delay is blamed on various problems enter­ing into the drawing of designs and specifications, taking into account the latest advances in science. -- Tribune, Chicago. Washington, D. C., March 13. [Special.]\n\nIn the presence of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison and a group of high naval officials, the new 1,850-ton United States de­stroyer Somers was launched at the Federal shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. yards here today.\n\nA crowd of 1,000 spectators watched the sleek new vessel, designed for use as a squadron leader, slide down the ways.\n\nIn a brief address, Edison declared “the United states has never encouraged war but never failed in its efforts to restore peace.” The best insurance tor peace, he said, is a Navy “second to none.”— Herald., Wash. Kearney, N. J., March 13. (I.N.S.)\n\nThe United States will send the battleship Hew York to participate in an international naval review May 18 off Spithead, England, in connec­tion with the coronation of King George VI of England, it was announced today. The British government invited the United States and other nations to participate in the review. The New York was the flagship of the American squadron which operated with the British fleet during the World War.—Tribune, Chicago. Washington, D. C., March 13.—[U.P.]\n\nThe cruiser Louisville, which yesterday at 12:16 p.m. rescued 8 passengers from the burning British motor ship Silverlarch, was scheduled to arrive in Honolulu at 3:00 p.m. Sunday, Naval Intelligence authorities reported yesterday.— Honolulu Advertiser, March 14.\n\nThe 3d Fleet Division of the United States Naval Reserves in the District of Columbia ex­celled all of the other divisions of the local unit in target practice on the annual destroyer cruise last summer, it was made known at the local armory at the navy yard last week. The report on the results of the firing had just been received.\n\nWhile the actual scores are held confidential by the Navy Department and the Reservists, it was said the 3d Division, commanded by Lieut. F. S. Kirk, made exceptionally fine marks and is reported to be definitely near the top of the list among the Reserve gunnery crews of the country. —Star, Wash. March 14.\n\nThe Coast Guard acted today to see that whalers play fair with whales. It assigned Lieu­tenant James D. Craik to sail aboard the Ameri­can whaler Frango, now in Norway preparing for a hunt in the Antarctic. An international treaty limiting the slaughter of whales requires that a Coast Guard or customs officer shall accompany each whaling vessel to make sure that regulations are observed.—Tribune, Chicago. Washington, D. C., March 13.\n\nGreat Britain\n\nNavy Estimates\n\nTimes, London, March 4.—The Navy estimates for 1937, issued yesterday, amount to £105,065,000, an increase of £23,776,000 over the total navy estimates for 1936, including supplementary esti­mates. Of the total for this year, £27,000,­000 will be provided by issues from the Consolidated Fund, subject to statutory authority being obtained in accordance with the terms of the Defence Loans Bill now before Parliament, and the net total is, therefore, shown in the estimates as £78,065,000. This provision is based on the policy laid down in the White Papers of March 3, 1936, and February 16, 1937, and, in the words of the First Lord’s state­ment accompanying the estimates, “the increased program of new construction and acceleration of shipbuilding forecast therein are fully reflected in the enhanced supply for which I am asking.”\n\nThe largest increase is in the provision for new construction and amounts to £14,033,215. This increase is due not only to the commencement of a larger building program than that of 1936, but also to a full annual provision for the 1936 pro­gram. The other main increase is that of £9,081,985 for maintenance of the fleet, including modernization of capital ships and large repairs, increase in personnel, and the making good of deficiencies in stores and material reserves. There is an increase of £516,500 for additional aircraft (other than for new construction) and maintenance of the Fleet Air Arm. The estimates carry a personnel of 112,895, an increase of nearly 11,000 due to the pro­gram of new construction.\n\nThe new construction program for 1937 includes, in addition to a number of small miscellaneous vessels:\n\n3 Battleships (King George V type)\n\n2 Aircraft carriers\n\n5 Cruisers (about 8,000 tons)\n\n2 Cruisers (about 5,300 tons)\n\n16 Destroyers (repeat “J” type)\n\n7 Submarines (patrol type)\n\n3 Escort vessels (previously known as “Con­voy Sloops”), one being for surveying duties\n\n4 Mine sweepers (previously known as “sloop Mine sweepers”)\n\n3 Patrol vessels (previously known as “Coastal Sloops”)\n\nIn the principal categories this program is larger than that of 1936 by one capital ship and smaller by one destroyer and one submarine. The First Lord points out in his statement that as the Washington and London (1930) naval treaties expired on December 31, 1936, there is no longer any quantitative limitation on naval construc­tion in any category of warships, but that, pending ratification of the London naval treaty, 1936, the qualitative limitations contained therein are being observed in the construction of ships now laid down or projected.\n\nOfficer Training\n\nUnited Services Review, February 23.— The new measures announced by the Ad­miralty to accelerate the supply of officers for Britain’s bigger Navy will mean a shortening of training, but fundamentally it will remain unchanged. The training of a naval officer must begin when he is little more than a child, and from then onward there is instilled into him unceasingly the traditions upon which the fabric of the naval spirit is woven. This training has created an outstanding type which is recognizable the world over.\n\nAt the age of 13½ the naval officer of the future sits for his examination and an in­terview by an Admiralty board of exam­iners. If he passes both tests he enters the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, at the beginning of the spring, summer, or autumn terms. These cadets are organized in “terms,” 11 in number, which to dis­tinguish them are given the names of famous seamen, such as “Anson,” “Hood,” or “Rodney.” This term label clings to him for the rest of his naval life. When he meets “Old So-and-So” in after years you are told, as an excuse for the boyish en­thusiasm of the greeting, “He was in my term at Dartmouth.”\n\nAt the end of his eleventh term, at the age of 17, he sits for his passing out exam­ination. If he scores high marks he can gain as much as 4 months’ seniority. He is now a seagoing cadet and after 4 months, instead of 8 under the old scheme, in a special training cruiser (at the present moment it is H.M.S. Frobisher) he is promoted to midshipman. He will have as extra messmates boys from the public schools who wish to take up the Navy as a career and join as special entry cadets direct from school at the age of about 17½. He then goes to a ship in the fleet. At the end of his second year at sea, during which time he has received instruction in naviga­tion, gunnery, torpedo, and general sea­manship, he is promoted to sub-lieutenant, provided he has passed his examination in seamanship.\n\nUnder the new scheme there will be a substantial change in training at this stage. Formerly at the age of 20 the midshipman was sent to the R.N. College, Greenwich, to begin the first part of his sub-lieutenant’s courses. Beginning in September, 1937, this is to be abolished for all acting sub-lieutenants except the very few pro­moted from the lower deck. This will mean that sub-lieutenants will go to sea roughly a year earlier. Before going to sea, however, he must go to Portsmouth for instruction in certain special subjects. Gunnery is taught at Whale Island, the naval gunnery establishment at the top of Portsmouth Harbor; navigation in the Navigation School in the Dockyard; torpedoes in H .M .S Vernon, formerly a “wooden wall,” but now a series of modern workshops and barracks on Portsmouth Gunwharf; and the duties of a divisional officer at the Royal Naval Barracks.\n\nHe is examined in these subjects. Marks are awarded for proficiency in passing, and a “first-class” award in each allows him to do a minimum time of sixteen months as sub-lieutenant, and he receives promo­tion to the rank of lieutenant at the age of 22. The average age is 23. After this the young officer is appointed to a seagoing ship, for he cannot be confirmed in his rank of lieutenant until he has obtained his watch-keeping certificate.\n\nAfter 8 years as a lieutenant an officer is promoted to lieutenant commander. After 3½ years in this rank he comes into the pro­ motion zone to commander. This is entirely by Admiralty selection, and as the number of commanders is small in proportion to lieutenant commanders this is a critical stage in the naval officer’s career. For­merly an officer who was not promoted to commander at the age of 36 passed out of the zone. Nowadays, thanks to new regu­lations, officers still stand a good chance of promotion at the age of 37½. Many of the great figures in present-day naval history were non-specialists; Beatty was one. But the converse is also true; Jellicoe was a gunnery specialist. Nowadays, with a rapidly-expanding Navy, there is a chance for every one, specialist or “salt horse,” to reach high rank and command.\n\nVarious Notes\n\nSpeeding ahead with its armament program, the British Admiralty tonight announced naval contracts exceeding $52,500,000 had been let dur­ing the week-end. The orders are for one 23,000-ton aircraft carrier, five 5,300-ton cruisers, one patrol vessel, and two sets of machinery for cruisers.\n\nThe 5 cruisers belong to the 1936 program, but 2 others which are to be laid down at Chatham and Portsmouth, and for which the machinery is to be supplied under the contract, are part of the 1937 program, to which the aircraft carrier also belongs.\n\nAwarding of the contracts for the new ships so soon after the navy estimates were introduced in Parliament is unprecedented, Admiralty circles declare, and indicate clearly the speed with which the British naval rearmament plan is being pushed ahead.\n\nContracts for 3 battleships under the 1937 pro­gram, costing 40 million dollars each, will be placed shortly. Other vessels still to be ordered under the 1937 program include: 1 aircraft carrier, 5 cruisers, 24 destroyers, 7 submarines, 10 vessels of the former sloop type, 1 destroyer depot ship, 1 submarine depot ship, and 33 smaller vessels.\n\nNaval construction now under way in British yards exceeds anything since the war and will be increased steadily until, by the end of the year, 148 ships will have been built.—Star, Wash. London, March 22.\n\nCo-operation between the services, aircraft carriers, and the work of the Fleet Air Arm are all mentioned in the explanatory statement by the First Lord of the Admiralty, which was issued with the navy estimates on March 3.\n\nThe new construction program for 1937 in­cludes two aircraft carriers. Of the 1934 program the Ark Royal will be launched in April next. Of the 1936 program the Illustrious and the Vic­torious were ordered on January 13, 1937. Be­cause of many calls on the Navy due to unfore­seen international developments, the number of exercises carried out in conjunction with the Military and Air Forces has been less than in former years, but combined operations, which have included the landing of troops, have been carried out at home and abroad. The usual ex­ercises between the Staff Colleges of the three services have taken place. When units have been available opportunity has been taken for certain squadrons of the R.A.F. to practice locating and attacking ships at sea.\n\nFour aircraft carriers have been in commission: the Glorious with the Mediterranean Fleet, the Courageous and Furious with the Home Fleet, and the Hermes in Far Eastern waters. The Eagle is now in commission and is about to relieve the Hermes.\n\nTo meet the expansion of the Fleet Air Arm, the Hermes on her return from China will be re­fitted and attached to the Home Fleet.—The Aeroplane.\n\nWarships of 4 great naval powers steamed about the Spanish coast today as first concrete evidence of joint international efforts to isolate the Iberian peninsula’s civil war.\n\nThe sea patrol, officially started last midnight, was composed of men-of-war from France, Great Britain, Germany, and Italy.—Star, Wash. London, March\n\nThe offer of the Admiralty to officers of the Royal Naval Reserve to transfer to the Royal Navy has not been received with any great en­thusiasm among the class to which it is addressed, the smart young officers of the crack lines. It is true that it will mean the transfer to a service on which most of them are very enthusiastic, with good pay which is rather better than they will be receiving from their companies when they make the transfer. The pension of £250 per an­num at the age of 45 is also attractive, for few if any of the liner companies offer anything of that sort.\n\nBut the ambitious young liner officer looks for­ward to commanding his own ship and reaching the top of the tree as captain in the Cunard, White Star, P. & O., or similar company. The definite announcement that the officers making the transfer will only be promoted to the rank of commander in exceptional circumstances, and never above that rank, is the point which is de­terring most of the best type. It is unavoidable, for the Navy already has far more commanders and captains than it knows what to do with, but it is easy to understand what a damper it is to the ambition of a keen sailor who has no desire to regard his career as finished at the age of 45, even if there is a comfortable pension attached to it.—Nautical Gazette.\n\nA serious admission of the vulnerability of oil tanks at the Singapore base has been made by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Samuel Hoare. In answer to Mr. George Lambert (South Molton), Sir Samuel admitted that the oil-fuel tanks installed at the Singapore base were above ground and were therefore subject to destruction by airplane attack. Active and passive defense against air attack was being closely investigated.\n\nMr. Lambert: Would not damage to or de­struction of these oil tanks absolutely paralyze our ships at Singapore?\n\nSir Samuel Hoare: I can assure that we are looking very urgently into the question of the underground storage of oil.\n\nIn view of the millions of pounds which are be­ing spent on Singapore, M.P.’s were left wonder­ing why the urgency of underground storage was not realized and provided for in the first place.— United Services Review.\n\nEngineer John Taylor, R. N., the oldest sur­viving naval officer on the retired list, is 100 years old today. He was born on March 2, 1837, nearly 3 months before the accession of Queen Victoria. There is apparently only one other surviving naval officer who was born in the reign of William IV, and that is Staff-Surgeon Samuel Grose, R.N., Retired, born on May 3, 1837.\n\nThe rank of engineer was renamed engineer lieutenant in 1902. Mr. Taylor, who lives at Bolton, Yorks, entered the Navy as an assistant engineer on May 9, 1861, and was promoted to engineer on November 11, 1867. Among his ships was the Cameleon, sloop, in which he served in the Pacific from 1871 to 1875; the screw frigate Endymion, Coast Guard ship in the Humber; and (from 1877 to 1881) the Thunderer, screw iron turret ship, in the Mediterranean, of which Lord Charles Beresford was commander. Mr. Taylor retired for age on March 25, 1882, and has thus drawn his pension for 55 years.—Times, London, March 2.\n\nLady Jeleicoe, wife of the late Admiral of the Fleet Lord Jellicoe, will perform the naming ceremony at the launch today of H.M.S. Im­pulsive at the shipyard of J. Samuel White and Co., Ltd., Cowes. The launch is due at 1:20 p.m.\n\nThe Impulsive is the last of the 8 destroyers of the Intrepid, class to be put afloat. Authorized in the 1935 program, and ordered in October of that year, they should enter the service between May and July next, and are to join the 3rd De­stroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean, at present composed of vessels of the Acasta class, completed in 1930. The Impulsive is the first ship of the Royal Navy to bear this name.—Times, London, March 1.\n\nSir Samuel Hoare, First Lord of the Ad­miralty, in reply to a question by Mr. Banfield in the House of Commons on February 17, said at up to the present 12 sub-lieutenants of the Royal Navy have begun training as Fleet Air Arm pilots before getting their watch-keeping certificates.\n\nReplying to Vice Admiral Taylor, he said that these sub-lieutenants will be promoted to the acting rank of lieutenant when they have become qualified by service and confirmed on obtaining their watch-keeping certificates. They will get these certificates while afloat in the Fleet Air Arm-The Aeroplane.\n\nAlthough established for some months, has just become known that the British Lord Chamberlain Stafford has created an establishment under his direction with the private British Broadcasting Co. In a public address the com­pany’s director intimated that the government is engaged with plans concerning how the radio broadcast can best be utilized in time of war. Accordingly, in a recently concluded agreement between the post-office department and the broadcasting company the government is empowered to take over the control of broadcasting in the event of war and utilize it for governmental purposes and aircraft warning. The building of extensive stations underground and in bomb and gas proof shelters has also been considered.—Tidskrift Vovdsendet.\n\nThe most extensive land, sea, and air maneuvers ever held by the British forces at Hongkong, lasting 6 days, were concluded March 21. A comminque said the defenses were found adequate although the attacking forces, which included 1,000 British troops from Singapore, outnumbered the defenders.\n\nThe maneuvers were considered significant because of the recent decision to strengthen the defenses of Hongkong, including the building of roadways capable of transporting guns and troops to all parts of the hilly island, and it is believed the garrison also will be strengthened.—Times, N.Y.\n\nFrance\n\nBrief Notes\n\nThe tremendous value of aviation in enhanc­ing both the offensive and defensive power of fleets was described by Marine Minister Alfonse Gasnier-Duparc today as one of the chief lessons being taught by the annual mid-winter maneu­vers of the French navy now in progress off the West African coast.\n\nIn an interview with the naval correspondent of the Petit Parisien, Mr. Gasnier-Duparc said that three large amphibians of the Croix du Sud type, as well as a large number of smaller aircraft at­tached to capital ships and aircraft carriers, are taking part in all the current fleet exercises. Aviation, he declared, will play a dominant r61e in any future naval war.\n\nThe Marine Minister said notably that the West African maneuvers, though still unfinished, have already proved that aviation can no longer be regarded as a mere auxiliary of the fleet but has become a necessary and integral part of it. Provided the air force is strictly incorporated into the navy, he said, it tremendously increases fighting power.—Japan Advertiser. Paris, Feb­ruary 15.\n\nIn the event of war, possibly even before, the French army, navy, and air force will be unified under one commander, the military committee of the Chamber of Deputies decided today. It approved a recommendation creating a war com­mittee, headed by the Premier and consisting of high defense ministers and the chiefs of staff, to pick a general commander at the start of a new war or, if considered necessary, during peace.— Herald Tribune, N. Y. Paris, March 3 (AP).\n\nThe French government, strengthening all branches of defense, moved yesterday to increase the navy’s man power by 10,000. A bill prepared for the Chamber of Deputies would provide these additional men:\n\nThe non-officer personnel would be raised from 61,113, to 70,817, the officers from 2,112 to 2,340, and marine engineers from 418 to 516.—Star, Wash. Paris, March 5 (AP).\n\nOrders for 4 mine sweepers were placed with the Lorient yard. Two of the latter are for colonial service. These vessels, similar to the Chamois, are a part of the 1937 program. There will also be built a target ship having a displacement of 2,500 tons and which will be equipped for distant con­trol. It will be the first ship built for this par­ticular purpose. The English, German, Ameri­can, and Japanese use old converted battleships.—Le Yacht.\n\nGermany\n\nReich Armaments\n\nHerald Tribune, New York, March 2.— Germany has tripled her air force in the last year to a total of more than 2,000 war planes and bombers, responsible quarters here revealed today.\n\nA reliable report said that Germany’s fighting aircraft at the beginning of 1936 consisted of 50 squadrons, or about 750 first-line war planes, whereas a year later there were 157 squadrons, totaling 2,050 planes. These included some “immediate reserves,” but omitted the huge number of second and third-line reserve planes, as well as stores of airplane parts.\n\nGermany’s production capacity has passed 200 new airplanes a month, the information indicated. Armament experts, however, said German plane production still was too small to make effective the intention voiced by General Herman Wilhelm Goering, Nazi Air Minister, of building to equality with the combined French and Soviet fleets.\n\nThe ground and flying troops in the German air force were set at 150,000 men —part of the standing army estimated in these figures at 830,000 troops.\n\nPilots, mechanics, and other aviation technical experts were being trained at 14 regular flying schools and 14 other “cen­ters of air instruction.” These ground schools and training fields were said to add another 62 or 70 squadrons—between 780 and 840 first-line war planes—which would be added to the Reich’s war-basis air force during 1937.\n\nMechanization of Germany’s army units also was progressing rapidly, the report showed. It said that the mechanized corps now included 1,500 armored cars and tanks.\n\nMan power was said to be abundant, but the problem of officers remained un­solved. Raw material for the army was being trained in numerous huge organiza­tions such as the Hitler youth, labor corps, the Nazi motor corps, Nazi cavalry units, and the Nazi air crops. But even the use of police, of whom 200,000 last year re­ceived at least 2 months’ special military training, had failed to overcome the dearth of officers, it was said.\n\nThe advices described the German army’s strength of 830,000 men as com­posed of 18 army corps and 38 infantry divisions. These were subdivided into 8 mechanized divisions, 1 brigade of cavalry, 100 infantry regiments, and 14 cavalry and 8 shock-troop regiments.\n\nOnly 105,000 tons of German warships were said to be in active service, necessi­tating an extensive building schedule. Those in active service were said to include the three 10,000-ton “pocket battleships,” 6,000-ton cruisers, ten 1,600-ton de­stroyers, thirteen 800-ton torpedo boats, and 36 submarines.\n\nThe German naval building program was understood to involve 183,000 tons of additional warcraft, including 36,000-ton battleships, to be completed by the beginning of 1938; one 35,000-ton battleship, to be ready the end of 1939; three 10,000-ton cruisers, of which 2 were to be ready at the start of 1938; 2 aircraft carriers, 12,350 tons each, to be ready the end of this year; 6 destroyers, to be put into service the middle of 1938, and 12 torpedo boats, also to be commissioned during 1938.—London March 2.\n\nBrief Notes\n\nA salvage vessel specially intended for the as­sistance of any army or navy planes forced to descend in the sea, was launched on February 20 at Hamburg. The vessel will be attached to the German Air Force and will be on service in the North Sea and the Baltic, where it can be rushed to the help of any air pilots in difficulties.—The Marine Engineer.\n\nCount Felix von Luckner, who gained fame during the World War as Germany’s peerless sea raider, will begin a voyage around the world in his new 2-masted schooner Sea Devil in March it was announced today. He will visit the Argentine, Brazil, South Africa, and New Zealand and will attempt to propagate those ideas on which the new Germany is based. He will also visit the South Sea Islands where he was made chieftain of various tribes during the war.—Japan Ad­vertiser. Berlin, February 4.\n\nITALY\n\nNavy Summary\n\nLe Revue Maritime.—The 1936-37 naval budget is an increase of 305 million lire over that of the preceding year. It totals 1j610 million lire. This sum is exclusive of that available for naval aviation.\n\nThe appropriations permit an increase of 250 officers for the various corps. It also provides for the establishment of new bases and the repair and re-enforcement of other bases such as: Pantellaria, Elba, the Dodecanese, Massouah, etc.\n\nThe report of the budget provides for the building, completing, and modernizing of a certain number of units listed below.\n\nModernization.—The old pre-war battleship Cavour and Cesare are modernized. Their dis­placement has been increased from 22,500 tons to 25,000 tons, and their speed increased from 21 to 26 knots.\n\nUnder construction.—Two 35,000-ton battleship Littorio and Vittorio Veneto; two, 8,000-ton cruisers Duca Degli Abruzzi and Giuseppe Garibaldi; one 2,500-ton colonial sloop Eritrea; four, 1,850-ton mine-laying destroyers Vittorio Alfieri, Alfredo Oriani, Giosb Carducci, Vincenzo Gioberti; six 615-ton torpedo boats Astore, Centauro, Climene, Perseo, Sirio, and Spica; four 850-ton escorts Orion, Orsa, Pegaso, Procione; two 900-ton (surface) mine-laying submarines Foca and Zoea; twenty 600-ton coastal submarines of two types Adua and Perla; 3 auxiliary ships; 25 motor scouts.\n\nOrganization.—During November, 1936, the Italian naval forces were regrouped as follows: First Squadron – Zara(flagship), Goizia, Fiume, Pola, Trento (flagship), Trieste, Bolzano, Di Giussano, Diaz, Pigafetta, Freccia, Dardo, Strale, Saetta, Folgore, Fulmine, Lampo, Baleno, Dorea, Ostro, Espero, Nembo, Aquilone. Second Squadron – Duca d’Aosta (flagship), Montecuccoli, M. Attendolo, E. di Savoia, Cadorna, Da Barbiano, Bande Nere, Colleoni, Maestrale, Grecale, Libeccio, Scirocco, Da Noli, Pancaldo, Tarigo, Malocello, Da Recco, Usodimare.\n\nItalian rearmament.—From an authoritative source, it has been said that since October, Italy has planned an increase in personnel which will bring the total from 50,000 to 60,000 men. The fleet will be increased proportionately.\n\nNaval informants say that following the re­ported increase in personnel and the declaration of M. Mussolini that “many dozens of ships will soon be under construction,” the Navy will pass through the following three steps:\n\nA number of light vessels will be added to the two battleships now under construction. Ten new submarines are being completed.\n\nA powerful naval base has been completed on the Island of Elba; the base at Taranto is to be further developed.\n\nThe Navy is to be maintained in full com­mission although the land forces have been re­duced since the issue of the Ethiopian war has been decided.\n\nIt is declared, from an authoritative source that, “When the English Home Fleet entered the Mediterranean, following Anglo-Italian tension resulting from the Ethiopian war, Italy under­stood that by keeping her fleet at a certain level with regard to the English fleet, she would be able to avoid the launching of a conflict. Now she has the intention of maintaining this proportion. As England builds, so will Italy build.\n\nPersonnel.—In recent months the list of flag officers has been increased by 5; 2 vice admirals and 3 rear admirals. There will henceforth be 3 admirals of the fleet, 7 vice admirals, and 24 rear admirals.\n\nThe Pofolo d’llalia on October 13 mentioned the beginning of construction of a large school for the youthful “Balilla” sailors, on the Island of St. Helena. It will be able to permanently handle the 250 students of the school-ship Scilla, and in turn the 2,000 Venetian students, to permit them to complete their education and to acquire a specialty.\n\nNew construction, trials, and modernization.— The modernization of the Cavour and Cesare were not finished in October, 1936, although the com­pletion date had been previously set for April, 1936. The cost of changing the engines, boilers, and armament cost 300 million lire.\n\nThey will really be new ships, displacing 25,000 tons. They will no longer have torpedo tubes because this arm is not considered suitable for heavy ships. Proceeding along this line it is noted that the cruisers Bolzano, Trente, and Trieste have had their torpedo tubes reduced from 8 to 4. Torpedo tubes have been completely removed from the Bari, Ancona, Taranto, Brindisi, Venezia, and Libia.\n\nThe press has exaggerated, it is said, the im­portance of the M.A.S. scouts. Actually there exist 21 of 12 tons, and 25 knots (5 remaining from the World War), and 20 of 18 tons (just completed). In addition there are some scouts of 25 tons now under construction. An experimental scout named Stefano Turr, with an estimated speed of 34 knots, recently completed its trials.\n\nAt Castellamare the colonial gunboat Eritrea, displacing 2,500 tons, was recently launched. It is to be used in East African waters.\n\nLast July 3 torpedo boats of the Spica class were launched. The Vega at Fiume on the 12th; the Aldebaran at Genova on the 15th; and the Sagittario at Fiume on the 22nd. A fourth, the Perseo was launched at Fiume on October 9. These units form part of a series of 10 ships ordered in 1935, all of which are named after stars. They displace 650 tons, are armed with three 4-in. guns and 4 torpedo tubes. The first two of this series, the Spica and the Aurore have already completed their trials.\n\nOn August 30 the destroyer Alfredo Oriani was launched at Livorno. It is the first of a new class displacing 1,675 tons. Four have already been launched. They are about 345 ft. in length, 33 ft. in width, have an estimated speed of 39 knots, and have a radius of action of 5,000 miles. They are armed with four 4-in. guns and 6 torpedo tubes.\n\nOn October 13 the submarine Emilio Tazzoli was launched at La Spezia. It is the last of 9 long-range cruising submarines to be built. It displaces 1,350 tons on the surface and 2,000 tons submerged. It carries two 4.7-in. guns and 8 torpedo tubes. The surface speed is estimated at 17 knots while the submerged speed will be 8.7 knots. Of the 8 other similar submarines, 5 have been commissioned since 1928; 2 entered active service in 1936, while another is still undergoing trials.\n\nThe construction of submarines of the Abys­sinian series is being carried out at a great rate. Among the later ones launched are the Adua, Axum, Aradam, Macalle (October 2, 1936), Alagi (November 16), Dessit, and Dagabur (November 23) and Gondar (December 30).\n\nItaly is finally entering the field of constructing fast tankers. From information of the Sunday Times (London) dated January 10, it is stated that three 13,500-ton tankers will soon be laid down. They will have a speed of at least 14 knots when loaded. It is believed that they will be launched in 15 or 16 months. The British press claims that they will be the fastest tankers in the world. They will form the nucleus of a national tanker fleet.\n\nItaly has the intention of no longer being obliged to have recourse to foreign ships for ship­ment of its oil. Actually the Italian tonnage in tankers is about 550,000 tons, while the world total is about 12 million tons. For the greater part, the Italian tankers are overage.\n\nBases and ports.—The Stampa of December 27 announced that contracts have definitely been drawn for the construction of the port of Assab in Abyssinia. The project under execution in­cludes an outside pier for protection about 3,000 feet long, parallel to the shore and distant about 2,300 ft. from it. This pier will have the function of protecting the loading docks. The docks will be lengthened about 6,500 feet and will include two large piers 360 ft. wide and about 1,000 ft. long which will permit 6 steamers docking simul­taneously as well as many smaller craft. There will be 4 large warehouses to handle merchandise. Eight electric cranes of a modern type will be used for loading. A complete road system will be built around the docks and the shops to permit a rapid transit towards the interior.\n\nIt is estimated that 4 years will be required to complete this work. The cost will approximate 80 million lire. However in 2 years one of the piers should be ready to permit docking of ships put­ting in to this port. The work will be begun at once as the necessary equipment is on hand.\n\nThe dry docks of Naples.—The first dry dock in Italy was completed at Naples in 1852. There exists at present two other dry docks of which the largest is about 700 ft. long. 85 ft. wide, and 25 ft. below the sea level. There is under con­struction, at present, a third dry dock capable of dry docking the largest merchant ships of today. It will have two caissons permitting the increasing of its length from 1,140 ft. to 1,300 ft. The floor of the dock will be 43 ft. below sea level. It will be provided with three doors, two for the en­trances and the third for the intervening division. The dock will be completely emptied in at least 2§ hours by means of three 1,500-hp. pumps and other less powerful pumps of 165 hp. The latter are installed primarily to pump out water filter­ing into the dock and rain water.\n\nVarious Notes\n\nThe 600-ton submarine Arcianghi, ninth ship of the ten Ethopian series begun in 1935, was launched at La Spezia on February 14.—Le Yacht.\n\nThe torpedo boat Sonkgla, built at Monfalcone for the Siamese government, was launched on February 10. It is the ninth of eleven such vessels ordered by the Siamese government. All are to be delivered by April.—Le Yacht.\n\nAt the Odero yards of Livorno, construction was begun on a 3,000-ton cruiser for the Soviet government. From certain information there will be two such ships built at the same time. Nothing is known of the characteristics except that the speed will be very high (42 knots).—Le Yacht.\n\nJapan\n\nDefense Plans\n\nHerald Tribune, March 2.—Japan, with a wary eye on the United States, has turned to the newest methods of chemical Warfare and a stepped-up air program to strengthen her defenses in the Pacific. Gas and other chemical weapons, General Gen Sugiyama, Minister of War, disclosed to­day on the floor of the Diet (Parliament), are being concentrated upon to make up for numerical inferiority.\n\nJapan need not fear the United States for 3 years, the Navy Minister, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, told the Diet, when the navy and naval air rearmament program ls completed, despite the menace he said Would result from increased United States air units in the Pacific.\n\nAn invitation by a third power to discuss arms limitation with the United States Would be accepted, Admiral Yonai said, the parley aimed at equitable arms re­ductions. But unless there was a definite Prospect of arms limitation, Japan would not propose such a meeting.\n\nThe army and navy ministers answered detailed questions during debate on war appropriations, with such important points brought out by Admiral Yonai that the budget subcommittee went into secret session to continue the discussion.\n\nIn addition to the United States, Japa­nese military plans principally consider Soviet Russia, which, the War Minister said, had already strained itself financially in preparing for war.\n\n“It is inconceivable that they can con­tinue increasing armaments indefinitely,” General Sugiyama said. “There must be some limit to Bolshevists’ capacity to build armaments.”\n\nAdmiral Yonai indicated Japan’s chief fear was that United States air units in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, and other Pacific possessions would be in­creased.\n\n“Some think the air force is more power­ful than warships, but our Navy regards the air force as an auxiliary to the fleet, both being indispensable,” he asserted.\n\nThe Navy’s replenishment program, Vice Admiral Noritake Toyada, chief of the Naval Affairs Bureau, told the Diet, is being conducted on the basis of the Washington and London naval treaties. Though the United States is “bent on constructing capital ships,” Toyada de­clared, the American auxiliary vessels are rather inferior numerically, while Great Britain is building 70 such vessels. “More­over, Britain plans to spend £1,500,000,­000 ($7,500,000,000) on a 5-year naval program, but the contents of the program are unknown to us,” he stated.—Tokyo, March 2.\n\nDiet Dissolved\n\nStar, Washington, March 31.—The Japanese Army, charging leaders of major political parties with obstructing “vital” laws for national defense, forced the disso­lution of Parliament today and threw the empire into a new political crisis.\n\nThe dissolution was ordered by Emperor Hirohito on the advice of Premier Senjuro Hayashi and made a general election, in which charged army domination of the government was expected to be made an issue, mandatory within 30 days.\n\nThe new crisis arose suddenly with the stormy seventieth session of the Diet due for only a few more hours of normal life.\n\nRealizing there was no chance of push­ing through the bills they considered vital for national defense, the army leaders, in co-operation with the navy, brought pres­sure to bear on the premier to advise the Emperor to order the dissolution, affecting the Lower House. The demand was pre­sented to Hayashi by General Sugiyama, the Minister of War, and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, the Minister of the Navy.\n\nThe government announced the new election would be called April 30 to choose 466 members for a new House of Repre­sentatives.\n\nA continued state of unrest was ex­pected to last throughout the month’s campaign, stirred by political leaders’ charges that a fascist-inclined military clique was attempting to dominate empire affairs.\n\nNearly 40 bills, some, such as the steel industry control and national fuel bills considered to be of major importance, the Army charged, had been blocked by “a lack of sincerity” on the part of members of the Lower House which left doubt “whether they intended to contribute to the welfare of the empire.”\n\nBefore they took the drastic action, however, the Army and Navy had suc­ceeded in pushing passage of the record $802,400,000 budget, of which more than half, or $401,700,000, went to the Army and Navy.\n\nAfter the dissolution was ordered, the government declared “in order to over­come the present crisis both at home and abroad, the government and the people must earnestly co-operate.”\n\nReiterating the Army charges of “lack of sincerity” and delay of “vital measures,” the statement added: “In the circum­stances, the government decided to appeal to the conscience and judgment of the people in the only way of fulfilling the principle of constitutional government. The government was therefore forced to dissolve the Lower House.”—Tokyo, March 31.\n\nVarious Notes\n\nThe battleship Mutu, completely modern­ized, has replaced the Nagato as the flagship of the Combined Fleet and is in readiness at Yokosuka for the new commander of the fleet, Admiral Osami Nagano, who has traded posts with Vice Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, the new Navy Minister, Domei reports.\n\nThe Mutu, launched in 1920, displaces 32,700 tons and has a length of 201.35 meters. It is the newest of Japan’s 9 warships of this category, one of which, the Kongo, was completed as long ago as 1912. The original nominal speed rating of the ship is 23 knots. The main armaments consist of eight 16-in. and twenty 55-in. guns, and there are also eight 12.7 centimeter high- angle guns.\n\nIts commander, Captain Eiji Goto, has com­manded in the past the 4th, 19th, and 11th De­stroyer Squadrons and the 10,000-ton cruisers Naka and Takao. Domei describes him as skilled in navigation and bold in character.\n\nThe return to the Mutu as the flagship of the Combined Fleet, comments the news agency, in­dicates how strenous the training of the fleet is going to be for the first treatyless year.—Japan Advertiser.\n\nJapan has formally notified Great Britain that she will not accept a proposal to limit naval guns to 14-in. caliber, the Foreign Office announced today.\n\nForeign Minister Naotake Sato made the noti­fication to Sir Robert Clive, retiring British ambassador.\n\nJapan’s action releases Great Britain, the United States, France, and signatory British dominions from a conditional agreement to limit guns to 14 in.—Tribune, Chicago. Tokyo, March 27.—[U.P.]\n\nJapan today launched its most modern first- class destroyers since the expiration of the Wash­ington and London naval limitation treaties. The 1,400-ton warship, the Suzukaze, is a super- equipped vessel.—Tribune, Chicago. Yokosuka, Japan, March 11.—(AP).\n\nEstablishment of a 7-hour express airplane service between Tokyo and Peiping is definitely under contemplation by the government, Com­munications Minister Hideo Kodama explained to the sixth budget sub-committee of the Lower House yesterday morning. An appropriation of 400,000 yen is needed to establish Japan’s first international airline, covering 1,500 miles, he declared.\n\nThe proposed service would include stops at Osaka, Seoul and Dairen, where connection would be made with the planes of the Hweiteh airline flying to the old capital. It is intended to put either a 16-passenger Douglas or an 8-place Nakajima plane on the run, according to the Asahi. Actual plans for the work are already being drawn up by the Communications Ministry.\n\nAt present, however, the Osaka airport on the edge of the Kizu River is too small to accom­modate planes such as the fast transports, which have high take-off and landing speeds. The air­liners will therefore have to stop at Fukuoka instead, for some time after the service is inau­gurated. This means that between 9 and 10 hours will be required for the flight to Peiping. Another air field on the Osaka-Hyogo prefectural border will be completed by this fall, and will be desig­nated as a port of call for the line. No date for inauguration of the service is mentioned.—Japan Advertiser, March 4.\n\nIn order to prevent unusual and sudden rises in prices of materials needed in the munitions industry, the Navy Department plans, in con­junction with the Army, to take effective steps to exercise as great control as possible. This is especially necessary in view of the large appro­priations which the Army and the Navy have re­ceived for the coming year. Preliminary plans have been drawn up in preparation for a joint Army-Navy study of the problem, and it is be­lieved that these plans include:\n\nAgreement between the Army and Navy as to which companies shall receive orders from the Army and which companies shall receive orders from the Navy.\n\nPlans to control the enlargement of plants which handle orders from the Army and the Navy.\n\nPlans to improve the quality of products by proper technical supervision by Army and Navy experts.\n\nPlans to prevent any inflation taking place in the munition industry and the fixing of prices on orders.\n\nIn order to facilitate the mobilization of in­dustries in time of war, the Navy considers it essential to have detail plans prepared in peace time, and studies of these plans are being made at the present time.\n\nAnother point to be considered in connection with the above plans is that in order to utilize the funds appropriated for the present year there must not be any competition between the Army and the Navy as regards priority of placing orders. If this is done satisfactorily there should be no question in regard to the proper absorbing of the largest budget in the peace-time history of the Navy.—Osaka Mainichi.\n\nTo test the hull of the new cruiser Mogami which is partially welded it was determined to fire an entire broadside with all available guns while making 32 knots. Several seams parted, especially in oil tanks, causing a loss of fuel. All faults were remedied and the ship resumed operations. The aircraft carrier Chitose which was begun in 1934 was launched at Kure late in December, 1936. Her characteristics are: 10,000 tons, 530 ft. long, 20 knots speed, and 4 anti­aircraft guns. In the vacated stocks another carrier, the Chiyoda, identically the same as the Chitose, will be built.—Morze, Warsaw.\n\nOther Countries\n\nArgentina\n\nThe Argentine dispatch vessel Py of 500 tons, has been salved after sinking in dry dock, but was not found worth refitting and is now on the sale list. The new dispatch vessel Bouchard has replaced her in service. Slightly smaller than the former vessel, the Bouchard has Diesel en­gines, instead of triple expansion machinery, and a more powerful armament, two 3.9-in. instead of three 3-in. She is the first to be completed of a class of 9, all built in Argentine yards.—The Navy, London.\n\nBrazil\n\nThe oil-tanker Malistan has been purchased for the Brazilian Navy and renamed Marajo. She is a ship of 5,553 tons displacement with a speed of 10 knots, and was built by Messrs. Bartram & Sons at Sunderland in 1924, with engines by J. Dickinson & Sons of the same port.—The Navy, London.\n\nGreece\n\nNew construction: Four 1450-ton destroyers have been ordered from the Fairfield yards by the Greek government. The armament will be fur­nished by Krupp. In addition the Greek naval program includes four submarines and the re­organization of its aviation branch.\n\nOrganization: According to the Daily Herald, a German Greek aeronautical accord has been completed in the latter months. This agreement will give German aviation a certain amount of expansion in Greece and will permit the German planes to use Greek airports.—La Revue Mari­time.\n\nSpain\n\nAt Malaga the Spanish insurgents are re­ported to have captured two government armed trawlers and one or two submarines. So far as can be ascertained the government naval forces took no part in the defense of the city, remaining immobilized at Cartagena. The cruiser Miguel de Cervantes is understood to be in dry dock there. No other news of government warships has come to hand lately.—The Navy, London.\n\nSweden\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the Navy, Vice Admiral de Champs, proposed to the govern­ment at the end of 1936 the increase of the num­ber of vessels by 4 destroyers of the Goteborg class, 3 submarines of the Sjolejonet class, and 9 motor torpedo boats of two different types. The pro­gressively more serious European situation has exerted an influence on the Scandinavian coun­tries which demands a rapid execution of the building plans. Although the available armored vessels are overage and in need of replacement, their building is not immediately essential since the results of the probing of the effectiveness of the various types are still to be awaited.—Marine-Rundschau.\n\nHere (in the Baltic) the disquietude is above all caused by the Russian arming. This has at­tracted the attention of Sweden which in this year will carry out a considerable strengthening of its fleet. First of all, the 800-ton destroyer Stockholm, 2 submarines, and 2 mine sweepers are to be commissioned. Besides this the modern­ization of the armored vessels is being pursued. At present the Gustav is rebuilding; she is to be converted to oil firing and is to receive a heavier anti-air battery. In the fall she will relieve the armored ship Sverige as flagship which will then undergo a thorough modernization. The mine­layer Clas Fleming is rebuilding; she is to receive new engines which are hot-air turbines; she is also to have Diesel generators.—Kriegemarine, March.\n\nTurkey\n\nNaval program.—The Turkish naval program includes the construction of two 8,000-ton cruisers, 4 submarines, and 4 destroyers. The 2 cruisers will be ordered from Japan. In exchange the Japanese will be permitted to manufacture textiles in Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish government, in August, 1936, ordered 4 coastal submarines displacing 600 tons each. Various equipment, such as engines, will be furnished by German firms. In addition an 8,000-ton steamer will be bought from Germany to act as a tender for the submarines. Finally, Turkey has ordered from the Krupp yards at Kiel 3 fast dispatch boats for Coast Guard pur­poses.—La Revue Maritime.\n\nU.S.S.R.\n\nThough Soviet officials deny reports published abroad that a fleet of Soviet airplanes is en route to the North Pole to establish weather stations and intermediate landing places for the projected Moscow-San Francisco airline, the Soviet press gave great prominence on March 24 to P. G. Golovin’s flight toward Rudolf Island, only 800 miles from the North Pole, where the most northern arctic weather station and a good land­ing field are located.\n\nProfessor Schmidt, chief of arctic research, re­vealed that the main motive of the flight is to survey the possibilities for establishing weather stations and intermediate landing fields for regu­lar air communication between the Soviet Union and the United States over the polar ice cap. He said such a line could be established within 2 years after surveys are completed. As part of the system of air fields and weather stations he pre­dicted the installation by Soviet aviators and scientists of a weather station on top of the world within 2 years and the opening of regular air communication with America soon after. The present flight is of great significance in view of Professor Schmidt’s announced intentions.— Times, N. Y.\n\nMerchant Marine\n\nMerchant Marine Reserve Training\n\nStar, Washington, March 14.—After years of effort it is probable the Navy Department this year will be provided with funds with which to start its program of giving training to officers of the Mer­chant Marine Naval Reserve. The House Appropriations Committee, in reporting the naval fund bill to the House, recom­mended an appropriation of $82,068 to provide active duty training for 100 of­ficers of this branch of the Reserve.\n\nThe men in this branch of the Reserve are active seamen, serving aboard Ameri­can merchant vessels, which would be taken over by the Navy in time of war for use as naval auxiliaries, such as supply and troop ships. While they are trained from the seaman standpoint, they have no knowledge of the naval procedure and discipline so essential to the operation of naval vessels in time of war, it was said. The department had requested funds be provided for the training of 400 officers and 500 enlisted men.\n\nCaptain Spears, in charge of Naval Reserve activities at the Navy Depart­ment, called attention of the committee to the strike situation in the Merchant Marine and added many students of this situation believe if a well-trained merchant marine naval reserve had been built up over the last few years the present condi­tions might have been avoided. He said it appears the United States is the only country in the world that has attempted to build up and maintain a merchant marine without providing naval training tor the personnel.\n\nDuring the past year, he told the com­mittee, there has been a widespread, insist­ent demand that the Navy Department take some action in assisting other govern­ment departments in their efforts to de­velop a trained and disciplined personnel for the Merchant Marine of the United States. He disclosed that representatives of the Navy Department have recently been in close touch with the Department of Commerce, the Maritime Commission, the Coast Guard and other maritime in­terests in order to assist in formulating a plan for procuring and training Merchant Marine personnel. He said that there are two problems involved:\n\nThe procurement and initial training of Merchant Marine personnel.\n\nNaval training for Merchant Marine per­sonnel in order to prepare them for service on board vessels designated as being suitable for naval auxiliaries in time of war.\n\nIt has been pointed out, Captain Spears said, the failure to provide funds for the naval training of our Merchant Marine Personnel is a discrimination against citizens engaged in the maritime profes­sion. Practically every other citizen who is subject to be drafted in time of war has an opportunity of joining some military or naval organization to receive training for his war duties in time of peace. The merchant seaman, due to the nature of his profession, does not have such an oppor­tunity. As he will be the first of our citizens to be under fire in case of a future war, it seems to be a matter of prudence to pro­vide him with naval training. In fact, the proper execution of any neutrality laws that may be developed may largely depend upon the discipline and training of our Merchant Marine personnel operating in or near the war zones of contending powers.\n\nCaptain Spears said that if any argu­ment is needed to show the necessity of naval training for our Merchant Marine personnel, it is but necessary to review the record of the World War. For the lack of discipline and trained seamen it was neces­sary practically to demobilize our battle­ships in order to procure trained men to operate our merchant vessels. There has been no great improvement in the mer­chant marine over World War conditions. That is to say, he continued, in case of mobilization at this time we would be caught with a merchant marine of un­trained and undisciplined personnel. On the contrary, every other maritime nation in the world makes great efforts to build up a trained and disciplined merchant marine personnel. This, he added, is done princi­pally by naval training.\n\nVarious Notes\n\nIn accordance with the agreement reached between the International Seamen’s Union of America and the Seagoing Personnel Committee of the Atlantic and Gulf Shipowners on February 3, material increases were accorded in the rates of pay for the deck, engine, and steward’s depart­ments.

Navemar is not enforceable in American waters. This is the second applica­tion. A decree of confiscation authorizing the Spanish government to seize the ship belonging to the Compania Espanola de Navigacion Mari­time, S. A., was published in Madrid in October, 1936. Subsequently, the vessel arrived at Buenos Aires where the Spanish consul made an endorse­ment on the ship’s register that she had become property of the Spanish government. The vessel proceeded to New York and a libel was filed by the owners for possession. In the first application made by the Spanish Ambassador, the court held that no showing had been made that the ship was property of the Republic of Spain and was possessed by it and was operated by it in its service and interest. Permission was granted for the Spanish Ambassador to present another ap­plication. The second decision was rendered by the same court: “Baldly, the question presented is whether a foreign nation can by edict confiscate property not within its sovereign domain nor otherwise within its possession or control, seize such property within the sovereign domain of another power, and claim immunity from suit in the courts of such latter nation. In all reason, the answer to such question must be in the negative.” The court also found that the Navemar was not an armed vessel in public service of its country nor operated by it. She was under charter to the Linea Sud Americana, Inc., and on arrival in New York her privately owned cargo was delivered to the consignees. It was also found that nothing in the treaty between Spain and the United States, warranted seizure. (1937 A.M.C. 22, 1st case, and 26, 2nd case).—Nautical Gazette.\n\nJoseph P.

The cost of all 4 ships bas been recently estimated at £6,000,000.

F.\n\nAviation\n\nAviation in Spain\n\nNigel Tagne, in The Aeroplane.—Dur­ing my wanderings I met many pilots who were, or had been, on active service and from them I naturally gleaned some of the lessons that are being learned from this war, equipped as it is with the most mod­ern instruments. Each side in the air is fairly evenly matched so that conditions are similar to a small sector of a modern European war, and relative strengths of attack and defense in relation to weapons can be assessed without qualification.\n\nThe most important lesson that has been learned is that air power as such is not the power it was taken to be. More than ever before is infantry necessary in order to take advantage of the power that is only latent in the airplane without the man with a bayonet beneath it ready to co-operate.\n\nThe other great lesson is that bombing raids have not the moral effect on a civil population that was expected. It is true that gas has not yet been used in the Span­ish war but presumably the same reluc­tance to use it will be there in any war.\n\nProvided the raids are frequent it mat­ters not how many people are killed each time, the effect is the same. The popula­tion treat them as an inevitable shower of rain and philosophically adjust themselves to them. I saw evidence of this many times. The early morning raid over Salamanca, for instance, resulted in the streets being cleared in a flash. But by the time the fourth came in the afternoon nobody took any notice at all.\n\nThe Red bombers flew always over 12,000 ft. to escape the really brilliant shooting of the German anti-aircraft guns. They are mostly very fast Russian ma­chines built on the lines of Martin bombers and Boeings. One sees also Potez bombers, whose country of origin shouts loudest at the iniquity of German and Italian inter­vention. Presumably because they have few big bombs, these machines rarely carry bombs heavier than 50 kilos.\n\nI presume that the Reds have nothing heavier by reason of the fact that the Nationalists favor the 250 kilo bomb for all purposes from ground-strafing troops to raids on military objectives. Experience has shown that one such bomb is better than five 50-kilo bombs and they only use the smaller type because of the difficulty in getting heavy bombs exclusively. They also use the 2-kilo incendiary bombs which they drop immediately after releasing the heavy bombs.\n\nAlmost all the Nationalist bombing is done with Junkers 52s, a military version of the 6-seat Heinkel, Savoia-Marchettis, and single-motor Alfa-Romeos.\n\nThe crews are becoming more and more Spanish as the German and Italian volun­teers train them, and one must admit that their efficiency is something astonishing. This is in some measure explained by the fact that they can do all their raids between 4,000 and 6,000 ft., because of the com­plete absence of effective Russian or French anti-aircraft guns.\n\nThis lack of anti-aircraft guns is some­thing of a puzzle to the Nationalists. If Russian artillery, Russian tanks, Russian aircraft, and French material all of the most modern type are used, why are not the most modern anti-aircraft guns used? The answer can only be that the Russians have no effective anti-aircraft gun, but this seems scarcely credible. The only type that is used against raiders is a 22­mm. quick-firer and there are large num­bers of these.\n\nThe result is that the Nationalists can always bomb from round about 5,000 ft. But though they may not be worried by anti-aircraft guns they have their work cut out to protect themselves from attack­ing fighters.\n\nRaid tactics.—They raid in orthodox formations and stick together at all costs. Provided this is done it has been found that a heavy bombing squadron’s defen­sive armament is more than a match for attacking fighters. The Junkers 52 has a machine gun well aft on top of the fuselage and another worked from a lowered turret under the fuselage just forward of the trailing edge of the wing. A flight of 3 machines can effectively cover attacks from all directions.\n\nWhen I was up at the Front I watched raids on objectives less than a mile away. It was uncanny to be able to do this with the safe knowledge that those huge ma­chines apparently directly above your head would not be dropping bombs where you stood. One such raid by 18 Junkers was particularly interesting.\n\nI was standing on the roof of a ruined house watching an artillery bombardment when my attention strayed to the sky over to the left. Through a smoke haze that lay over the city I saw a flight of 3 black bombers slowly approaching. I watched them fascinated, waiting for them to drop their bombs. Dimly I realized that they were making a lot of noise for just 3 aircraft. I looked behind them. I saw an­other flight following, and another, and another. There were 6 in all.\n\nSlowly this procession flew along the enemy artillery lines dropping bombs whose track one could follow from ma­chine to objective. Huge explosions rent the air. My eyes wandered to the bright blue sky above them and suddenly I per­ceived that it was filled with a myriad of tiny silver gnats that tumbled and zoomed and dived around one another. At inter­vals of comparative silence I could hear the pup-pup-pup of machine guns. There were at least 50 fighters in combat at about 12,000 ft.\n\nHaving dropped their bombs the bomb­ers wheeled over my head and made for home, but one, for some reason or other, had dropped behind and was being at­tacked by three Red fighters simultaneously. I waited for the inevitable moment when it would be brought down, for its plight was unobserved by the White fighters. Then I heard that exhilarating whine of high-powered machines in a dive and I saw a group of machines, detached from the melee at 12,000 ft., plunging down to the rescue.\n\nThere was a racket of engines and ma­chine-gun fire and the Russians used their superior speed and made off. A few minutes later order appeared from the chaos up above and the battle was over, the White fighters forming into 3 squadrons. Two of them followed the bombers as escort, and the third squadron circled round for per­haps 10 minutes before they, too, made off homeward.\n\nAlthough night raids are made by Na­tionalist planes, up to the time that I left no night raid had been made by Red planes. The only possible explanation for this is the incredible one that the Russians and the pilots of many nations who form the Red Air Force cannot, or will not, fly by night.\n\nThis is fortunate for the Whites because Spanish nights are fine with excellent visibility and targets show up easily.\n\nThe Flakartillery.—Salamanca, in common with other military objectives, has its permanent anti-aircraft defense, con­sisting of 88-mm. guns grouped in squares, one gun at each corner. Each group is controlled electrically by an officer in the center and no attempt is made to converge the shells at the target. The bursts pre­serve their original relative positions.\n\nElsewhere mobile batteries of the same type operate and never stay in the same place more than 24 hours. You meet them sometimes on the road—4 guns and about 15 lorries carrying equipment. You never know where they are.\n\nOne morning when driving from San Fernando to Seville I told my chauffeur to stop at what I thought was a peaceful spot for a picnic lunch. I had not been there a minute before I found myself in the middle of a raid, the machines too high for me to see. Hidden a hundred yards away was one of these batteries. I had happened on a concealed petrol dump known to the enemy.\n\nThe marksmanship of these batteries is far better than anyone in this country can believe. They pick off individual 200 mile an hour bombers at 12,000 ft. I found plenty of evidence of this.\n\nI tell it to people over here and am met with exasperating disbelief. Similarly they refuse to believe me when I tell them that not one but many of the squadrons who have been on active service almost every day for 3 months have never had a machine- gun jam. When will we acknowledge that what we have is not necessarily the best, in fact, that we may be a long way from the top?\n\nThe Italian Pilots Make Good.—One of the surprises of the war has been the cour­age of the Italians in the air. We have known of their skill for a long time. We have doubted their courage. Their tem­perament is such that, not surprisingly, they are very much better fighters than bombers. Similarly Germans are much better bombers.\n\nThis dove-tailing of the air qualities of the two Fascist countries is a matter of considerable significance. In Spain, at any rate until recently, almost all the active fighting squadrons have been Italian. They fly a biplane Fiat which has a performance somewhat similar to our Hawker Fury.\n\nI had many discussions of great interest with some of these Italian pilots and their experience is illuminating. Although their Fiats have very little speed in hand over the Russian bombers they refuse to change them for the low-wing highly wing-loaded machines which look so nice to us but which they have tried in air combat and have found wanting.\n\nThey are quite definite on this. They argue that unless there is a vast percentage superiority in speed over the enemy bomb­ers there is nothing to lose from the slower machine and a lot to gain. The defensive armament of a bomber formation is such that fighters cannot continue an attack if the initial shock tactics have failed.\n\nThe slower machine, by having superior height in the first place, is therefore just as well off attacking bombers as the faster, and when it comes to engaging enemy fighters there is no comparison between the two. Time and time again they have proved that, given equal conditions, the biplane, with its low wing-loading, has all its own way against a highly wing-loaded monoplane. If the monoplane decides to use its superior speed and make off, then the biplane pilot has achieved his object by preventing him doing what he wants.\n\nOne squadron commander told me that the extra minute that the biplane took to get up to its operating height was com­paratively of very little disadvantage. He put forward the very interesting belief that in the next war fighter pilots would be trained to do 10 hours’ flying a day and they would be always patrolling high above likely objectives.\n\nReconnaissance work and intelligence of enemy aircraft movements would play an ever increasing part to make such patrols effective. The motors of the air­craft would have to be changed each night.\n\nHe believed that these tactics would prevail until a fighter was produced which was as maneuverable as the contemporary biplane fighter and which had a 50 per cent advantage of speed over the bomber. In other words, they would prevail, for all intents and purposes, forever.\n\nThe moteur-canon has found no place in this war. Three or four months ago the Nationalists came across some Dewoitines, but have not seen any since. The canon has not met with success. Fighter tactics were described to me as “the same as in the Great War, but not quite so aerobatic.” Certainly nothing interesting in formation work has been successful.\n\nThe Russian fighters are very modern, some have 4 machine guns which the bombers do not like, and almost all are low-wing monoplanes. They are brave pilots and are always there to intercept raids. Casualties on both sides are fre­quent.\n\nThese Russians enjoy themselves some­times on ground-strafing expeditions—4 or 5 fast monoplanes, one behind the other, with machine guns that point at an angle downwards. Whenever you are motoring up to the lines along the main road of communication, which is constantly under bombardment, you have to keep a good lookout for these “Ratters” as they are called. Moving cars are their delight and relics by the side of the road tell you that they are a force to be reckoned with. As they fly at over 200 miles an hour their concentration of fire is not as great as it might be.\n\nClipper Reaches New Zealand\n\nStar, Washington, March 31. By Ed­win C. Musick, Captain, Pan-American Clipper).—Behind us today lie 7,000 miles of a new transoceanic airway never until now charted from the air for the purpose of converting it into a new aerial trade route gaited to the speed of modern times.\n\nSince the Pan-American Clipper landed on the waters of Auckland Harbor in the dusk of last evening, bringing to a con­clusion the west-bound portion of our flight from the United States to Australa­sia, via Hawaii, Kingman Reef, and Pago Pago, the hospitality of the New Zealand­ers has been lavished upon us.\n\nParticularly gratifying to us, who were selected to bring to a climax and confirm d long years of careful engineering and ground survey work in preparation for this second transpacific airline, is the fact that we were able to negotiate the entire 1,800 miles of the flight from Pago Pago to Auckland in daylight.\n\nSo satisfactory was the final stage of our flight from the United States that we were able to make a wide detour to inspect the Kermadec Islands, some 500 miles northeast of the entrance to Auckland Harbor.\n\nWe were told today that these islands, 4 in number and standing, at least from the viewpoint of our aerial observation, Hose together, were not discovered as a group, but that two—Macauley and Curtis islands—were found in 1788 and the other two not until 5 years later. This fact was particularly impressive to us as aerial surveyors because we passed over all 4 in less than 30 minutes.\n\nAlso impressive to us was the informa­tion that, at present, these islands are visited only once a year by a government steamer. In their isolation, typical of scores of islands which we have seen on our aerial survey assignments, these Pacific outposts look with special enthusiasm upon the transportation advantages of modern airplanes.—Auckland, New Zea­land, March 31 (By Wireless).\n\nVarious Notes\n\nA revolutionary new wind tunnel and first details of new 4-engined stratosphere planes ca­pable of flying at altitudes of 35,000 ft. were described last month at the annual alumni dinner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York City, be­fore several hundred M. I. T. graduates, including many leaders in aviation.\n\nThe new wind tunnel, which will simulate for the first time air-conditions in the stratosphere, with winds traveling at velocities as high as 450 m.p.h., was described by Dr. Karl T. Compton, president of M. I. T. The new tunnel, to cost about $150,000, will be dedicated as a memorial to the Wright brothers at the International Con­gress of Applied Mechanics which will meet in Cambridge, Mass., in the summer of 1938.\n\nThrough the novel device of operating in either compressed or rarefied air, controlled by a pump, it will be possible, Dr. Compton said, either to match the gigantic full-scale government wind- tunnel at Langley Field, or to operate at speeds exceeding 400 m.p.h. under substratosphere con­ditions.—U.

Two weeks before the boat had flown from South­ampton to Alexandria in 13 h. 35 min., at an average speed of 170 miles an hour. On this, the return trip, she covered the 2,300 miles in 15 h. 15. min. The machine took off from Alexandria at 12:30 a.m. with the aid of a flare path, and landed at Hythe at 3:45 p.m. It has been stated that by using the automatic pilot and checking it every 15 min., the machine flew for long periods without the assistance of human control.—The Engineer.\n\nA contract for 5 twin-engined Sikorsky S-43 type amphibion airplanes, and for spare parts equivalent to one more complete amphibion, was awarded by the War Department on February 25 to the Sikorsky division of the United Aircraft Corp.\n\nThe total cost was $633,898, or slightly more than $105,649 for each plane. With the exception of heavy bombers, the new craft will be the most expensive purchased by the War Department.\n\nThe conventional design of the plane, widely used in over-water transport service, will be changed by the Army flyers only to the extent of replacing passenger chairs with camera racks and providing space for the other equipment.\n\nOfficers say that the amphibions will be used almost exclusively as convoy ships for bombing squadrons on long over-water flights. They will be able to alight on water for rescue purposes.— U. S. Air Services.\n\nReorganization of the much-criticized Bu­reau of Air Commerce was announced today by Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, with the appointment of Fred Fagg, Jr., Brooklyn, to succeed Eugene L. Vidal, whose resignation as bureau director became effective today.\n\nAlthough Rex Martin and J. Carroll Cone, the assistants who shared authority with Vidal, were sent abroad on study missions, officials of the Commerce Department denied that the shake-up was prompted by charges of inefficiency by the Copeland Senate Committee a year ago, or more recent charges growing out of a series of airplane disasters.\n\nMr. Fagg is a World War pilot, founder of the Air Law Institute at Northwestern University Law School, and consulting expert on air safety. He was called in several months ago to revise the bureau’s air safety regulations. He also advised the Senate Air Safety Committee, a subcommit­tee of the Copeland committee which urged last June a “thorough overhauling” of the bureau.\n\nMajor R. W. Schroeder, chief of the Airline Inspection Service, was promoted to chief as­sistant to the new director.\n\nSecretary Roper announced that Mr. Vidal “has kindly consented to assist us in an advisory capacity in launching a new and enlarged program to be undertaken if Congress votes a large appro­priation.”—Herald Tribune, N.

R. (“Tommy”) Thompson and caused it to crash mysteriously in San Francisco Bay on February 9, killing all 11 persons on board, has been put in the hands of the Bureau of Air Commerce and is expected to be made public soon in an official report on the accident.\n\nThe crash has been one of the most baffling in the recent series of air disasters, since Thompson had an exceptionally high rating as a pilot and the crash occurred in perfect weather after he had flown over, and still was in full sight of, the air­port.—Herald Tribune, N. Y.\n\nAircraft Depth Charges.—Recently a French paper brought out a study on the above subject which Pierre Melon, World War flier from all appearances, points out are to be taken seri­ously by all professional people. Pierre Melon derives his theory from anti-submarine war­fare in which he finds important similarities to anti-air fighting. As the first point he refers to the short-time span during which the target of both can be placed under fire, and the sec­ond point, the impossibility of attaining effec­tive fire in this short time. The result (in anti­sub warfare) was the depth charge.\n\nIn these circumstances (fighting modern air­craft with gunfire from aircraft as at present) the useable fire time is reduced to one or one and one half seconds. He concludes that therefore the following needs manifest themselves in modern anti-air warfare:\n\nIncrease the useful fighting time.\n\nReplace machine guns, the weapon of the fighters, with a weapon that has an indirect effect.\n\nTo entrust the task to an organized flight rather than to a handful of trick gunners engag­ing in individual combats.\n\nHe sees the solution of the task in a depth charge carrying aircraft. A reported attacking bombing squadron would be engaged by a squadron of about 10 depth charge aircraft. The latter would cross the course of the attackers some 1,000 feet ahead and above and would drop their charges. For such a performance neither trick flying nor superior marksmanship are required. It builds a curtain of greatest explosive force with a width of 500 yards and a depth of 3,500 ft. across the course of the enemy.—Marine-Rundschau, Feb­ruary, 1937.\n\nGlenn L. Martin announced today that the Argentine government had awarded his com­pany a $4,300,000 contract for 35 military bombers. Production will begin at once, with delivery expected late this year, Mr. Martin said. The contract brings outstanding orders on the Martin Company’s books to $12,500,000.— Times, N. Y.

Hughes the Harmon international trophy, awarded to the young motion picture producer as the worlds outstanding aviator during 1936.\n\nHughes was selected for the award by the Ligue Internationale des Aviateurs because of his record-breaking transcontinental flights. Only two other Americans, Col. Charles A. Lindbergh and the late Wiley Post, have received this trophy.\n\nAt the White House ceremony, the President was made an honorary member of the Ligue, even though he has abstained from flying since his election in 1932. He told those present of two hair-raising experiences he had in Navy planes during the war. In each case his plane came out of a tailspin just in time, he said.—Herald, Wash.

C., March 13. —[Special.]\n\nAmelia Earhart postponed her round-the- world flight indefinitely today as the result of the crash which wrecked her $80,000 Lockheed Elec­tro plane in an attempted take-off at dawn from Luke Field here for Howland Island.\n\nThe flyer and her two men navigators were un­hurt, but the plane was seriously damaged and will be sent to the United States for repairs which may take from one to three weeks. To supervise the reconditioning, Miss Earhart booked passage aboard the Matson liner Malolo, sailing this noon, and will arrive in California early next week.\n\nReturning to the mainland with her are Cap­tain Harry Manning, her radio navigator, and Fred Noonan, co-navigator, who were with her in the crack-up, and Paul Mantz, her technical adviser, who had intended to leave the group here. The plane is to be shipped later.—Herald- Tribune, Honolulu, March 20.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe Arrangement of Main and Sec­ondary Batteries in Capital Ships\n\nFrom the Rivista Marittima and the Marine-Rundschau. By Lieutenant Com­mander Walter Ansel, U. S. Navy.—A discussion of great interest in these days of “new construction” has been in progress between two European flag officers of dif­ferent navies. Admiral de Foe of the Royal Italian Navy has proposed a change from what he designates “the classic” ar­rangement of gun batteries (the one now most widely in use, with main battery turrets at the ends of the ship and second­ary battery amidships). He wishes to place the main battery turrets amidships and the secondary battery in turrets, two for­ward and one aft on the center line. Ad­miral Prentzel of the German Navy has discussed the proposal rather fully with historical examples and applications. These have in turn been examined by the originator and reconciled with his ideas. The choice of battery arrangements and the main points favoring the De Feo system are summarized by Admiral Prent­zel as follows:\n\nMain battery turrets at the ends of the ship.— This may be designated the classic arrangement; it is the one that has been most commonly used in the past. It requires that the turrets of the secondary battery be located on the sides, which results in a small field of train forward and aft. High turrets could be placed over other outboard ones but this solution gives a disadvantageous use of weight and would necessitate a decrease in the field of train of the main battery.\n\nMain battery turrets forward only, foregoing fire aft over a 60-70 degree angle of train. This arrangement is now being employed by the Brit­ish in the Nelson class and by the French in the Dunkerque. In this case the turrets for the sec­ondary battery are all located at the sides aft, as in the Nelson class, or part at the sides and part on the center line, as in the Dunkerque class.\n\nMain battery turrets amidships, accepting a blind angle of train ahead and astern of 40 de­grees (20 on each side of the center line). This is the proposed disposition of Admiral de Feo which, in his view, will assert itself as the type arrange­ment of the future with pure midships armament location. The turrets of the secondary battery are on the center line, two forward (in view of the greater offensive and defensive value of bow fire) and one aft.\n\nThe advantages for course (c) are:\n\nWidest angle of train for the full battle power of the main battery, because in (a) and (b) this angle of train reaches only to within 30-40 degrees of the ship’s axis instead of to within 20 degrees.\n\nDevelopment of the greatest fire effect for the secondary and anti-aircraft batteries in their beam sectors and greater fire effect for them in the sector ahead.\n\nBest opportunity for building up the most effective defense and for protecting the vitals of the ship by reason of the simplicity of design and the more efficient employment of weights.\n\nAdmiral Prentzel then quotes the clos­ing words of Admiral de Feo as follows:\n\nIn this battery arrangement (main battery amidships) the principle stressing the importance of an all around equal division of fire, which is mentioned in the report of a British Admiralty board, is disregarded and therefore it appears that the other principle—that a commander must have complete use of all his weapons in all battle situations—also has been forgotten. But if vessels are constructed according to such a principle, one will finally arrive at a type in which the possi­bilities of complete exploitation of battle strength have been curtailed in all sectors of both the main and secondary battery. This principle probably had its value for sailing vessels, which were not able to place themselves in a favorable position relative to the enemy because their position was determined by the direction of the wind or, in a calm, by the seaway. Consequently, they could not choose the direction in which they wanted to attack or defend and therefore had to be armed all around. But the vessels of today are no longer under this duress, for they have the power, with­out injury to their tactical handling, always to place themselves on such a course, relative to the enemy, that they are able to develop the optimum of battle power and to offer the smallest target, which is of greatest import. The relinquishment of the arc dead ahead and that aft, the latter now a fact in the Dunkerque class, has already been partly accomplished and is otherwise not a de­cisive factor. All the less is it so in view of the many other tasks which, in consequence of the increased attacking power of modern torpedo and aircraft, have not been satisfactorily solved. This may be especially realized when the battle con­ditions of the near future are contemplated. Such numerous and weighty problems are not easily solved in ships which have their turrets at the ends.\n\nIn the November issue of the Marine-Rundschau, Admiral Prentzel "
