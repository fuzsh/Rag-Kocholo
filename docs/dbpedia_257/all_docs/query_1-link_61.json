        "text": "March 2024 edition. The book explains the fallacies behind the “boycott of Israel” arguments. It also provides a time-line for the discussions around the developments of the successive curricula for Ethnic Studies courses in public schools in California and analyzes the pitfalls of the final bill passed by the California legislature regulating the mandatory Ethnic Studies course for students in public schools. The book ends with two appendices. Appendix I contains articles by the author about his vision of the Arab-Israeli conflict and its resolution. Appendix II contains articles by the author about the latest social movements in the US and some regional conflicts, including the war in Ukraine. The book is also available at Amazon, as an eBook and in paperback.\n\nAugust 2024 edition. This edition is in Hebrew. This book does not intend to deal with all the issues related to the Arab-Israeli conflict: it only concentrates on the basic issues of it. But I am convinced that once the reader understands the origin and essence of the conflict, then all the other pieces of the conflict can be understood and the path to true peace will be possible. The audience for this book is general: Gentiles and Jews, Arabs and Israelis. The reader can be a student just starting high school or an adult. This great variety determined the style of the book and the form: a series of nine sessions or lessons, generously illustrated. There are also editions of this book in English (“The root of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the path to peace”) and in Spanish (“La raíz del conflicto árabe-israelí y el camino hacia la paz”). The book is also available at Amazon: ISBN-13: ‎ 979-8374636468\n\nSeptember 2024 edition.

Kennedy Jr opened his campaign for the 2024 US presidential election on April 2023. Since then, rumors swirled about him in the social media, and he was accused – between other things – of being an antisemite. His friend, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, invited him to a public dialog to clarify his positions about the Jews. This dialog was held on July 25, 2023. For the benefit of the public, I considered worthwhile to transcribe in written the dialog that Robert F. Kennedy Jr held with Rabbi Boteach. This dialog is presented here to the reader. You can also find the book at Amazon, as an eBook and in paperback"
