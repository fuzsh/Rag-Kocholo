        "text": "THE POLISH NAVY 1918 - 1945 /A Short Story/\n\nJack Ensign Stern Shield\n\nIntroduction\n\nTo introduce the story of the Polish Navy I must describe the German policy of the time. Germany never agreed to Versailles Treaty, and furthermore the representatives of Western powers made decisions, which did not take, into account history and aspirations of the Poles.\n\nPoland was granted a narrow strip of the coast, only 142 km long witch included Hel peninsula, an almost empty region with two small fishing harbours: Hel and Puck, without great port of Gdansk, who became artificial formation with title of Free City of Gdansk.\n\nAfter this events Germany laid claims to the Polish regions of Pomerania, Silesia and Gdansk. These demands were accompanied by revisionist propaganda, increasing from year to year. At first they undermine and sabotage and then to violate, the provisions of the Treaty and international agreements.\n\nAs a results there was an increase of Germany military power which also included the growth of the German Navy /Kriegsmarine/, after Hitler's accession to power.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles prohibited Germany possession of submarines, naval air force and restricted her surface fleet to 6 battleships, 6 cruisers, 12 destroyers and 12 torpedo boats. Such a navy could not constitute a treat to Great Britain or France, but it was a treat for the Baltic countries. At first they started secretly in co-operation with Soviet Russia, Finland and Spain /submarines/. In the year of 1925 the budget of the German Navy was some 104 million marks but in the year 1939 it reached the sum of 2 billion marks!\n\nMeanwhile they launched first \"pocket\" battleship the \"DEUTSCHLAND\" /1931/, then the cruiser \"NURNBERG\" /1934/, the sixth ship of this class to be build in Germany after World War I. In the same year, two battleships were laid down with official displacement of 26.000 tons,but actually with displacement of 31.850 tons each, or three times as much as envisaged in Treaty of Versailles. These were the\"GNEISENAU\" and the \"SCHARNHORST\". In the year 1937-38 three more cruisers were launched and 1939 saw the worlds two the biggest battleships: \"BISMARCK\" and \"TIRPITZ\" - 41.700 tons each!\n\nIn the year 1939, Germany had a Navy of two new and two old battleships,three \"pocket\" battleships,eight cruisers, 34 destroyers and torpedo boats and 57 submarines!\n\nAfter the I World War,which ended November 11th 1918, when Germany, Austria and Russia disintegrated - Poland once again became an independent state after long years of occupation by these three powers. Note: First partition in 1772, second partition in 1793, third partition in 1795\n\nSoon after that on November 28th 1918 the de facto Head of Polish State Joseph PILSUDSKI ordered the creation of the Polish Navy. Captain Bogumil NOWOTNY to become a Chief of Naval Affairs at the Ministry of Defence and later on, Rear-Admiral Casimir POREBSKI.\n\nFirst Chief Head of Polish State Next Chief Captain Marshal Rear-Admiral Bogumil NOWOTNY Joseph PI LSUDSKI. Casimir POREBSKI /ex-AustrianNavy/ /ex- Russian Navy/\n\nPoland has had naval traditions since 1558 when the Polish King SIGMUND AUGUST created the first Polish fleet under command Admiral Thomas SIERPINEK. In 1624 the first Polish dockyard was founded at the Puck. In November 28th, 1627 the Polish fleet under Admiral DICKMAN fought with Swedish fleet near Oliwa - Gdansk.\n\nThe first years of independence were very difficult. Germany attempted with the assistance of paramilitary German organisations to regain Silesia a highly industrialized and rich in coal region. Of course such actions forced Polish citizens to resist and fight in three bloody uprisings. Then in 1920 Soviet Union invaded Poland and quickly reached the suburbs of Warsaw our capital.The Communists tried to conquer Poland and then the rest of Europe for ideological reasons. Unfortunately for them, they lost the fight and the war against Poland and we have some 20 years of peace, after it had established non - aggression pacts with Germany and Soviet Russia.\n\nBETWEEN THE WARS\n\nAfter the World War I - Poland had many of experienced naval officers and petty officers who came from ex-Russian /72%/, Austrian /22%/ and German / 6%/ navies, /about 260 officers some of admiral ranks/ and they were trying to get warships from ex-foreign navies as war reparation. At first Great Britain promised 1 cruiser, 4 destroyers, 2 floating-bases and several motor torpedo boats. Later on, Admiralty cancelled this under the pressure of British prime minister DAVID LLOYD GEORGE, who was always unfriendly towards Poles.\n\nIn the year 1919, the so called River Flotilla was formed on the rivers of WISLA and PRYPEC on the border with Soviet Russia.During the 1920 war with Soviet Russia, the River Flotilla had 18 ships and 20 well armed motorboats operating on Prypet and Dnieper rivers with crews of 46 officers, 500 POs and seamen.\n\nIn the year 1920, a base in Puck was formed for the Polish Naval Air Force with ex-German aircrafts.\n\nAt last, in 1921 international body of ministers at Geneva agreed to hand over: 6 ex-German torpedo- boats, 360 tons each one, 27 knots, 3x 75 mm or 2x 75 mm guns and 1 x 2 torpedoes. They were named after regions of Poland: MAZUR, KASZUB, KUJAWIAK, SLAZAK, KRAKOWIAK and PODHALANIN. Moreover, other ships were bought: gunboats GENERAL HALLER, KOMENDANT PILSUDSKI - 342 tons each, guns 2x 75 mm /Finland/. Four small minesweepers came from Denmark: CZAJKA, JASKOLKA, MEWA, RYBITWA, and four river gunboats and a hydrographic ship at Gdansk.\n\nOf course all of them served as training ships until 1931, except MAZUR, GENERAL HALLER, KOMENDANT PILSUDSKI, which stayed afloat until September 1939 after rebuilding.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1927 several plans were laid down concerning our future navy but none was approved by the Ministry of Defence due to the lack of money. It was very difficult to get money for new ships, but the Chief of the Polish Navy - Rear-Admiral J. SWIRSKI finally started to build in the Polish shipyards 4 new minesweepers and 1930 in French shipyards 2 destroyers: WICHER, BURZA, 3 submarines WILK, ZBIK, RYS . Again in 1935 other ships, 1 minelayer GRYF in French shipyard and 2 destroyers: GROM, BLYSKAWICA in England and in 1936 : 2 submarines ORZEL and SEP in Holland. In 1937 Poland started building of 2 minesweepers: ZURAW, CZAPLA.\n\nAfter new port of Gdynia was built,the Polish navy had a base at Oksywie and another at Hel Peninsula with a new gun battery 4 x 152,4 mm /Bofors/.\n\nPRESENTATION THE NEW NAVAL OFFICERS TO THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND PROF.

Captain W.ZAJACZKOWSKI/ in 1939 had 44 armoured ships and motorboats of about 1100 tons and auxiliary crafts of 3670 tons.\n\nThe disproportion of German and Polish Navies was so great that the Polish Navy has no chances in fighting at the high seas and for defensive fighting off shore it could be done on a limited scale only.\n\nOn land, preliminary mobilization steps were being taken and the Navy authorities under Rear-Admiral J.SWIRSKI began making efforts to obtain assistance from France and Great Britain.Polish-British Agreement was signed on August 25th 1939 then the Polish-British Naval Agreement on Nov.1939\n\nBEGINNING OF THE WAR\n\nA representative of the British Admiralty, Captain RAWLINGS suggested that Polish ships might be sent to one of British bases. This proposal was accepted and the plan received the code name: OPERATION PEKING. Two days before the attack of Germany,the Commander in Chief of the Polish Fleet,Rear-Admiral J. UNRUG received an order from the Warsaw Polish Naval Headquarters : \"PROCEED WITH PEKING\". Same day, August 30th, 1939 at 2:15 p.m., destroyers: BLYSKAWICA, GROM, and BURZA left the roadstead of Gdynia-Oksywie naval base for the roadstead of the Hel naval base and after dusk went round Hel peninsula to the West at high speed. During the night August 30/31-st they reached the British naval base at Leith in Scotland.\n\nOn the following days,a bloody fighting was going on the Polish land, sea-coast, in the air and at sea.\n\nBut before this, on August 25th 1939 the German training battleship SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN called at the port of Gdansk, with a \"Courtesy Visit\". Capt. KLEIKAMP of this ship knew the main lines of: \"FALL WEISS\" plan and directives issued by the Commander in Chief of the Kriegsmarine, - Admiral RAEDER:\n\n\"Destruction of the Polish naval forces , blocking sea routes leading to Polish ports , paralysing of Poland sea trade and ensuring security for German sea routes.\"\n\nCpt. G.KLEIKAMP received an order from his superior C-in-C GROUPE OST,Admiral ALBRECHT to take a convenient position for attacking the Polish military outpost of WESTERPLATTE and wait for the hour \"Y\" -THE TIME OF STARTING THE WAR.\n\nExactly at 0445 a.m. on September 1st 1939,the battleship SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN started shelling the Polish military out-post of Westerplatte from distance of 600 meters!\n\nWESTERPLATTE UNDER THE GERMAN ATTACK Westerplatte on fire Schleswig-Holstein\n\nPolish garrison at Westerplatte had 209 infantry soldiers with one 75 mm gun, two 37 mm guns, four 81 mm mortars and 22 heavy machine guns. German battleship had : 4 x 280 mm 10 x 150 mm and 4 x 88 mm guns.\n\nAt 0510 a.m. September 1st 1939, about 18 German bombers destroyed the Polish naval air-base at Puck in a surprise attack, killing C.O. cdr. E. SZYSTOWSKI - the first Polish officer killed in this war. On the next night another air attack destroyed almost all the Polish seaplanes.Only one Lublin R-XIII G/hydro survived and only Cant Z-506B flew away.But later on Cant Z-506-B was destroyed by German bomber near Lublin on 11-09-1939.\n\nNote : The Cant-Z-506B was one of the six similar seaplanes ordered in Italy /build at Cantieri Riunti dell Adriatico Triest. /Weight 8120 kg,utility 4000 kg,full 12120 kg - Dimensions 26.5 x 19.24 x 6.7 m - Engines 3 x Afa Romeo 126 RC34 567 KW or 750 KM - Speed 370 km/h, ceiling 8000 m,range 2950 km- armament 3x12.7 mm, 1000 kg of bombs or 850 kg torpedo - crew 5 /.Above mentioned seaplane arrived to the Polish naval air-base at Puck on 27-08-39 with the crew : pilot Lieut.cdr.R.BOROWIEC,navigator Lieut.K.WILKANOWICZ and three P.Os./2nd pilot S.WITAS,mechanic F.GRZESIAK,radio W.WZOREK /.\n\nAs a result of air attacks,the Polish vessels left Oksywie and Hel naval bases and put out to sea except MAZUR and NUREK which remained at Oksywie\n\nAccording to the relation of Sub-lieut.B.SIEMASZKO from MAZUR :\n\n\"About 0700 a.m. on September 1st three unidentified planes came over Oksywie and left untouched because the Polish Naval Headquarters got information from Army Group TORUN they would be friendly aircrafts. Then about 0800 a.m. a messenger came on board and handed over an official message to C.O.- Lieut.cdr. T.RUTKOWSKI, but when leaving the ship he said to some friends that German had already attacked and bombed Puck. I was sent to a Signal Station ashore to check this information,they confirmed it, but still no more news came. At noon when lunch began, a messenger came with a coded signal and captain told me to decode this signal.There was an order : \"Open envelope SMOK\" . Right after that, captain informed officers that the war with Germany is in progress and ordered Action Station. Very soon a strong formation of about 30 enemy aircrafts appeared over Oksywie and attacked shore batteries and ships in port . One bomb exploded at quay near MAZUR and another hit a bow and ship was in sinking condition. Nearly 40 crew members were killed and many others wounded.\"\n\nGUNBOATS O.R.P.MAZUR, O.R.P.GENERAL HALLER, O.R.P.KOMENDANT PILSUDSKI O.R.P.MAZUR\n\nBuild at Stettin 1917 by Vulcan Shipyard, rebuild in 1935 in Poland\n\nL = 62.6 m, B=6.2 m, = 2.5 m Displacement= 421 tons Two boilers Yarrow Two turbines AEG Vulcan=5.500 HP Endurance = 1400 miles/17 knots Max.speed = 20 knots Guns : 3 x 75 mm, 1 x 40 mm a/a, 2 MG Crew : 5 officers and 75 POs and seamen\n\nO.R.P.GENERAL HALLER, O.R.P.KOMENDANT PILSUDSKI\n\nBuild at Abo Finland 1920/21\n\n<\n\nL = 50.0 m, B = 7.0 m, T = 2.9 m Displacement = 342 tons Two boilers, two steam engines=1600 HP Endurance = 700 miles/14 knots Maximum speed = 14.5 knots\n\nArmament /1938/: Guns : 2 x 75 mm, 1 x 2 x 13,2 mm a/a, 4 MG Mines : 30 Mk \"08\" Crew : 3 officers and 56 POs and seamen\n\nThe President of Poland prof.

WICHER\n\nO.R.P. BURZA\n\nThe Air attack on Hel took place the same day: a group of about 30 dive-bombers met with heavy anti-aircraft fire and only small damages were incurred.\n\nAbout noon of the same day another group of German bombers (about 20 - 30 planes) raided the Gdynia-Oksywie naval base. This time the following ships were sunk: gun-boat MAZUR, (C.O. Lieut-cdr. T. RUTKOWSKI), divers-boat NUREK /C.O. Warr-off. W.TOMASIEWICZ/ and a tug-boat. Moreover the floating naval-school ship BALTIC was damaged, all with heavy casualties.\n\nOn September 1st at 1745 Polish vessels: WICHER, GRYF, KOMENDANT PILSUDSKI, GENERAL HALLER, JASKOLKA, MEWA, CZAJKA, RYBITWA, CZAPLA ZURAW were attacked, while at sea about 4 miles from Hel,by 32 German Junkers JU-87-B dive-bombers.The German aircrafts attacked the Polish mine-lying ship GRYF with 300 mines on board. In spite of heavy anti-aircraft fire of all Polish ships, splinters of one bomb killed C.O.GRYF cdr. St.KWIATKOWSKI and about 10 others, but no damages were incurred by the ship.\n\nIt was first time when a strong group of air-crafts attacked a group of naval units in this war. It was a new German tactic , which was repeated several times at sea by the Japanese.\n\nMeanwhile, the minesweeper MEWA was damaged, Sub-lieut. Z.MIELCZAREK and some four crew members were killed, and some were wounded.\n\nThis German air-attack killed the Polish plan of lying mine field 12 miles SE of Hel during the night of 1st September across the sea route between Pilau and Gdansk. All vessels returned to the Hel roadstead except destroyer WICHER engaged in patrol duty of the southern part of Gulf of Gdansk.\n\nThe German plan was simple and effective: a sea blockade round Polish coast and Gulf of Gdansk. The first ring consisted of motor gun-boats and minesweepers, the second ring of destroyers and torpedo boats under Rear-Admiral G.LUTJENS. Farther at sea to the West,there were cruisers and some 10 submarines near the Danish Straits. To destroy Polish ships and naval bases at day time,the Germans used aircraft's in small groups, mostly dive bombers and from time to time the guns of the battleship SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN anchored opposite the Polish military out-post at WESTERPLATTE. At night they tried some raids by destroyers or torpedo boats inside Gulf of Gdansk.\n\nOn September2nd,two small passenger ships GDANSK and GDYNIA /C.O. Lieut.res.St.KOSKO/ were sunk by German dive bombers with loss of 70 crew members .TheSCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN unsuccessfully tried to destroy a Polish gun battery at Oksywie.In the evening German aircrafts /bombers and dive-bombers/ attacked naval base,the roadstead and shore battery on the peninsula without visible effect.\n\nOn the early morning of the 3rd,the two German destroyers LEBERECHT MASS /C.O. -Cdr.F.BASSENGE/.and WOLFGANG ZENKER /C.O. Cdr.G.POENITZ/ having together 10 guns 127 mm in total, left Pilau in direction of Gdansk then changed the course towards Hel. From the distance of 18.500 metres they started shelling Hel roadstead where the destroyer WICHER / 4 x 130 mm guns/ and mine-layer GRYF /C.O. Cdr.St.HRYNIEWIECKI/ 6 x 120 mm guns/ were anchored . The Polish ships answered with all guns. In the mean time,the Polish battery of Hel /4 x 152 mm guns/ took part. In effect of this duel, GRYF was hit twice, Sub.lieut. L.DANDELSKI and several others were killed and some wounded. Two German destroyers were damaged, one left to Pilau, another to Gdansk with tug boat.Casualties on the German destroyers: four seamen killed and several others wounded.\n\nThe defeat they had suffered, demonstrated to the Germans that this two Polish ships were still dangerous to their light forces.\n\nMINELAYER O.R.P.

Fortunately ship had no mines on board. Because all pumps were out of order and fire was impossible to extinguish, crew were evacuated ashore. After throwing bombs German aircraft's pelted defenders with machine guns.On afternoon another air attacks followed: the WICHER was hit to the ships bow and ripped it open down to the bridge. Another bomb exploded close to ships side and tore off its plating. Next two bombs hit amidships, ship was sinking. C.O.- Cdr.St.de WALDEN ordered to abandon ship. Casualties: one man killed and 22 wounded. The enemy nevertheless continued to harass them by unceasing fire from the planes deck guns, shooting at swimming and unarmed shipwrecked men. This time minesweeper the MEWA was sunk.\n\nOne hour later another air raid, this time against ships in fishing port Hel: gun- boat the GENERAL HALLER was hit and damaged.The last air-raid this day took place 1900 hours:the GRYF already abandoned and on fire was bombed again. After that Polish crew members of GRYF and WICHER managed to remove three main guns from GRYF /each 2 x 120 mm/ ashore as a new batteries of Hel. Moreover four guns 75 mm and all machine guns from the GENERAL HALLER (Lieut-cdr. St MIESZKOWSKI) and the KOMENDANT PILSUDSKI (Lieut-cdr. M. JACYNICZ) - were removed ashore. After sinking of the WICHER, GRYF, GENERAL HALLER and KOMENDANT PILSDUDSKI the best Polish ships ceased to exist but their crew members took position ashore at Hel peninsula. Polish vessels went down fighting, with their white and red flag hoisted, carrying on their fire to the last.\n\nDEFENCE OF THE SEA COAST>\n\nThe Westerplatte was attacked without mercy by the German battleship the SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN 280 mm and 150 mm guns, special land howitzers 210 mm and field guns 105 mm, aircraft's bombs and land forces continuously for seven days and nights. Several land attacks were repelled. According to the operating plans, they were to offer resistance for 12 hours only. Defenders were decimated, there was no more water, food and ammunition.One third of the soldiers were wounded and 16 killed. German losses were 20 times bigger.When further resistance was pointless from the operating point of view and could lead to further bloodshed the Commanding Officer - Major H.SUCHARSKI gave order to stop fighting on 7th September 1939. For the Poles a name of the WESTERPLATTE means same as for Americans name of the CORREGIDOR.\n\nThe battle for Gdynia was also extremely hard fought. In the first days of September Polish units were forced to withdraw from Gdynia port to Oksywie hills above naval base, on September 13th and to resist there to the last. In the mean time the Polish armoured train fought on the line: Wejherowo-Gdynia. Later on, the train was damaged and her C.O.-Lieut-Cdr. BLESZYNSKI was mortally wounded.\n\nThere were some 7.500 survivors from the various defending troops. Their guns : 4 x 105 mm, 1x100 mm, 15 x 75 mm, 9 x 37 mm a/a and a/tanks,a dozen or so mortars and about 140 heavy machine guns.\n\nCompletely encircled with their back to the sea, the defenders fought bravely, day and night for whole week and even counterattacking. No one capitulated. In the thick of battle, regiments melted down to the size of companies, and companies had only strength of platoon. In spite of that, the enemy had to put up a bloody fight for every square meter of ground. On September 17th,last platoon of seamen was encircled by the German detachment near Obluze,and commanded to surrender. the Polish seamen responded with fire, determined to resist to the last round of ammunition.\n\nAll died fighting including Cdr.Eng. Z. HORYD /C.O. battalion of seamen/, Sub-Lieut.N.HERNES,Sub-Lieut.res.L.MISTAT,Sub-Lieut.eng.A.SIERBINOWICZ. Second in command was Lieut.eng.J.SOBIERAJ and Aide de Camp was Sub-Lieut.B.SIEMASZKO - survivor from the MAZUR . Toward the evening September 18th all the ammunition was gone. On the September 19th last officers and seamen of platoon defended Kepa Oksywie with exceptional bravery for almost whole day until 0430 p.m. Then rallied around the commander of the Coast Defence - Colonel St.DABEK, who having exhausted all possibilities of fighting and unwilling to yield himself prisoner, took his own life with a pistol bullet.\n\nThis is generally accepted that 1500 - 2000 defenders died in this battle and some 3500 were wounded or missing. The enemy losses were approximately the same.\n\nACTIVITIES OF THE MINESWEEPERS\n\nThe Polish minesweepers were adapted also for mine lying operation, each one had 20 mines. Except the MEWA (Lieut.-Cdr. W. LIPKOWSKI) already sunk, there were still following ships: CZAJKA (Lieut.-Cdr. A.CZERWINSKI), RYBITWA (Lieut.-Cdr. K. MILADOWSKI), JASKOLKA (Lieut.-Cdr. T.BORYSEWICZ), ZURAW (Lieut.-Cdr. R. KASPERSKI) and CZAPLA (Lieut.-Cdr. E. CECENIOWSKI) - all under command of Cdr. Z. BOCZKOWSKI.\n\nThey were operating in the Gulf of Gdansk and the Bay of Puck, with the base at small fishing port Jastarnia in the middle of Hel peninsula.\n\nDuring fighting on land, when the Polish defenders took positions on Oksywie hills on September 12th JASKOLKA, CZAJKA, RYBITWA opened gunfire against the German forces with great success.\n\nAt night September 13/14th, same ships laid some 60 mines 4 miles SE of Hel naval base. Again at night on September 15th CZAJKA, RYBITWA, JASKOLKA,ZURAW and CZAPLA bombarded the German position North of Oksywie.\n\nRed rectangles - Polish mine fields, (number of mines and dates)\n\nUnfortunately on September 15th early morning, a strong units of the German aircrafts bombed their base at Jastarnia.JASKOLKA was hit and destroyed by fire. RYBITWA and CZAPLA were damaged. Moreover the hydrographic ship POMORZANIN/ C.O. Lieut-Cdr.K.ZAGRODZKI/ and one tug boat were sunk. The guns of those ships were transferred ashore for land defences and units were formed from the remaining crews, which took part in defence of Hel peninsula. CZAJKA, ZURAW and RYBITWA left for naval base at Hel.\n\nMINESWEEPERS O.R.P. JASKOLKA, O.R.P. MEWA, O.R.P. RYBITWA, O.R.P. CZAJKA, O.R.P. ZURAW, O.R.P.

Their crews experienced very hard moments.\n\nThe WILK under the command of Lieut-Cdr. B.KRAWCZYK was attacked by four German minesweepers and was forced to dive up to 87 metres. From 2nd to 7th of September the Germans dropped on this submarine at least 42 depth charges. Unfortunately the damages were not possible to repair at Hel still being attacked by planes. The WILK received permission to go to England or Sweden. Lieut-Cdr.KRAWCZYK decided risky passage to England then to internement in Sweden.On 15 September,the WILK radioed to the Polish Naval Headquarters at Hel :\n\n\"Passed Sund - Proceeding England - Long live Poland\".\n\nTheSEP under C.O. Cdr. W.SALAMON damaged by the several German attacks on September 15th sent a message to Hel: \"Possibility of Diesels getting overflowed. Further action impossible. Going to Stockholm\".\n\nThe RYS a third Polish submarine under command of Cdr.A.GROCHOWSKI also experienced very hard moments being tracked and attacked by depth charges. On September 18th having run out of fuel and suffering numerous damages, including periscope, the ship had to call at Staves - Sweden.\n\nThe ZBIK under command of Cdr. M.ZEBROWSKI was the only submarine that escaped detection by Germans in the first days of war. She was operating in southern part of the Baltic Sea, but unfortunately without success except that German Minesweeper M85 /500 tons/ sunk on mine on 1-10-39 , laid by ZBIK ,in position 54'45 N and 18'45 E , with loss of 24 seamen. After 25 days, having run out of fuel she came to Sandhamn at Sweden.\n\nThe ORZEL at first under command Cdr.H.KLOCZKOWSKI then Lieut-Cdr. J.GRUDZINSKI operated the longest in the Baltic. But already on September 4th and 5th she was attacked several times by the enemy ships and planes and numerous damages were caused. On September 10th the Cdr..KLOCZKOWSKI fell ill. His condition was growing worse, besides there occurred a mechanical failure of air-compressor. Of necessity ship was called first neutral port Tallin on the evening of September 14th. The sick commander was taken to a hospital, and here is very interesting story of this ship according the Polish historian Edmund KOSIARZ:\n\n\"The Estonian authorities prolonged ships stay in the port for 24 hours, motivated by the fact that a German merchant ship was leaving the port and than acting illegally, probably under pressure from a German envoy, they interned ORZEL. On September 16th the disarming of ship began: the artillery ammunition, the gun locks and 10 torpedoes were removed ; the maps were also taken away.Most of crew, however, including the new commanding officer, Lieut-Cdr. J.GRUDZINSKI, could not resign themselves to the thought of internment. The brave sailors wanted to continue fighting with the enemy at any price.\"\n\n\"During the night of September 17/18th they effected a breakdown of the electrical installation in the port, putting it out of order; when the port was enveloped by darkness, they overpowered two Estonian guards, cut of moorings and the ship - not without difficulty -began to leave the port. The escape was soon noticed. The Estonian ships lying in the port opened fire on the ORZEL an so did a coastal battery. Yet ORZEL luckily manage to escape being hit, soon dived to 30 metres and in spite of an attack by depth charges, got out.\"\n\n\"But then new difficulties emerged.There was no maps of the Baltic Sea aboard with which to navigate. The navigation officer Sub-Lieut. M.MOKRSKI , drew two maps from memory, using only a List of Lights .The guns were ineffectual, their locks missing. However, still left on the ship were six torpedoes which Estonians had not time to unload.The crew began to look for target, hoping to met some convoy or a larger naval ship. During the night of October 8th/9th as fuel was running out, the ORZEL entered Sund Strait.\"\n\n\"After reaching the island Ven, the submarine stopped,for there was the risk of being spotted by ships patrolling the straits.For the whole day she rested on the bottom of the sea and it was not until the evening of October 9th that she made her way through the narrow straits between Helsingor and Halsingborg. The ship spent two more days in the Kattegat straits, first between Kullen cape and the island Anholt, later off cape Skagen The crew strove determinedly to encounter the enemy. On October 12th lieut-cmdr. GRUDZINSKI took the ship to the North Sea and two days later on October 14th he established communication with the British Admiralty.\"\n\nThe ORZEL was met with the British destroyer VALOROUS on October 14th near Firth of Forth and entered the British naval base at Rosyth, after forty days of her dangerous cruise.After some repairs she joined the Second Submarine Flotilla.\n\nTHE LAST POLISH BASTION\n\nHel peninsula was the last Polish bastion of defence. There was a small fishing port and other port for the Polish naval units. Just before the war there were some fortifications build including naval depots, workshops for running repairs, small floating dock. Moreover there was a shore artillery which comprised of four 152 mm guns, four 105 mm guns, two 100 mm guns, eight 75 mm guns. Defenders consisted of naval and land forces of 3500 men.\n\nAfter GRYF was sunk in port Hel, the crew managed to remove their three 120 mm guns from ship to shore. Also four 75 mm guns from gun-boats /COMMANDANT PILSUDSKI and GENERAL HALLER/ -They served as additional batteries.\n\nHel was bombed by aircraft's from the beginning of war very frequently, especially shore battery . But after Oksywie last fights on September 2O Germans sent another battleship SCHLESSIEN to help SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN to bomb Hel naval base. Moreover another German ships took part: artillery training ships DRACHE and FUCHS coast guard ships MOVE and SIEGFRIED and torpedo-boat T 196 but without success.\n\nOnce again on September 25th, Rear-Admiral Herbert SCHMUNDT /C-in-C the German Naval Forces Baltic Sea/ gave an order to the SCHLESSIEN /C.O.- Cdr K. UTKE/ and the SCHLESWIG - HOLSTEIN /C.O. Cdr.G.KLEIKAMP/ to resume the naval bombardment of Hel battery. In this artillery duel theSCHLESSIEN was nearly missed and asked for smoke screen. The SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN was hit twice and both battleships retired. But the shells from this last battleship damaged one gun of the Polish shore battery, some gunners were wounded including commanding officer - Lieut.Cdr. Z.PRZYBYSZEWSKI.\n\nOn September 27th both battleships once again opened fire against Hel . The SCHLESSIEN started from Jastarnia towards Hel, and the SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN directly Hell battery from the distance of 14.000 meters. This time commanding officer of the Polish battery was Lieut-Cdr. B.MANKOWSKI /experienced officer after French and USA artillery courses/. After third salvo of the Polish battery the German battleship SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN was framed and with next salvos her gun turret was damaged, and she retired with her sister ship SCHLESSIEN. But they too inflicted several damages to the Polish battery.\n\nOf course all the times Hel was under heavy air-attacks /a naval base, port and town/.\n\nAnd now, once again after the historian Edmund KOSIARZ:\n\n\" On September 30th the land forces of enemy launched a strong attack along the peninsula .In this critical situation , the defenders set off the explosion of torpedo warheads with total weight of about 10 tons of TNT , which had been buried in the ground earlier /Cdr. A. Los - 30 IX 1939/. The peninsula was almost cut in two at its narrowest part, but the enemy attack was checked.\"\n\n\"In spite of the successful repelling of attacks of ships and Nazi troops, the resistance of the defenders of Hel could not last much longer. The enemy had not broken them but the ammunition was running out. Serious difficulties appeared in the securing of food for civilian population. Besides, further resistance on Hel was losing its operational importance since it could not have any major effect on the defence of the country which by then had been almost entirely occupied by the enemy. Hel also lost its significance as a base for the ships since those had either been destroyed or interned or else had forced their way to British bases.\"\n\n\"Taking into account the general situation the Commander in Chief of the Navy, rear-admiral J.UNRUG decided on 1st October to surrender.\"\n\n\"At 1100 a.m. on October 2nd, the German Armed Forces entered Hel taking prisoners about 3200 seamen and soldiers. The losses in killed and wounded amounted to about 210 men. The German losses were approximately the same.\"\n\n\" In the defensive war on the coast in 1939 the Polish defenders wrote glorious pages in the history of Polish arms. Fighting under most difficult circumstances, deprived of aid from the Allies, cut off from the rest of country, the Polish seamen were the first to offer resistance to and engage in combat against the might of the Nazi Kriegsmarine.

In this group were crews of the Polish River Flotilla and midshipmen of Polish Naval Officers School, under command of Cdr.S.KAMINSKI.

Cdr.W.KODREBSKI/, ORP GROM /C.O. Cdr.A.HULEWICZ/,and ORP BURZA /C.O. Cdr.St.NAHORSKI/, under the Senior C.O.- Cdr.R.STANKIEWICZ arrived on September 1st 1939 about 1300 hours to Leith roadstead near May Island /Firth of Forth/ Scotland in company of HMS WANDERER and HMS WALLACE.\n\nOn September 3rd, a representative of the Royal Navy revisited Cdr.R.STANKIEWICZ on board of BLYSKAWICA, with news that this day 1100 a.m. the Great Britain declared war against the Germany. From this moment situation was clear.Now the Polish Navy was not alone and took part in fighting alongside with the powerfull Royal Navy against the German Kriegsmarine.\n\nNext day, Cdr.R.STANKIEWICZ who was the Senior Polish Officer left for London and reported to the First Lord of Admiralty - Mr.Winston CHURCHILL and to the First Sea Lord of Admiralty - Admiral Dudley POUND. They decided that the Polish vessels should stay under operational command of the Royal Navy but with the Polish commanding officers.For communication purposes each ship should have a British Liaison Officer with signal,radio,coder specialists.\n\nMeanwhile on September 3rd 1939 the German submarine U-30 torpedoed and sunk the British passenger ship ATHENIA without warning with 1102 passengers and 315 crew on board and the long war at sea has began.\n\nFrom now our main enemy at sea were U-Boats ! German Navy started the war with 57 U-Boats,managed to build during war 1113 U-Boats,mostly torpedo and some mine-layers and supply ships. They lost at sea 630 , in European bases 123 and 215 were destroyed by own crew in the end of war. During the war Uboats sunk 149 and damaged 48 allied war ship,sunk 2882 merchant ships = 14,408.422 BRT.( from the memoirs of Adm.K.DOENITZ-\"10 Years and 20 Days\")\n\nIn this chronicle only most important events are printed .\n\nThe Polish destroyers were sent round Scotland to Plymouth / Devonport RN base.There C. in C. Rear-Adm. M.Dunbar NASMITH visited Polish destroyers . To begin they were used in patrols and escorts of merchant ships round England and in English Channel. Also some small repairs and improvement of stabilities were done.\n\nTHE POLISH NAVAL HEADQUARTERS /Chief rear-adm.J.SWIRSKI/ were established at first in Paris /11-Oct.39/ then transfered to London /29-Dec.39/.Two administrative divisions were created : Senior Polish Naval Officers - The North Command/C.O. Cdr.W.KODREBSKI/in Greenock and South Command/C.O. Cdr.K.NAMIESNIOWSKI/ in Plymouth,later on one at Gibraltar.Above mentioned were responsible for discipline,rotation,health and training of officers and crews ashore.\n\nAt the end of October 1939 the Polish ships were sent to Harwich /East England/ and joined the British First Flotilla for escort and patrols duties in North Sea .Times spent at Harwich were very hard, exhausting and very dangerous because proximity of German bases, air and naval units, magnetic mines laid by aircrafts or motor-boats,the British defensive mine-fields not to mention of navigation at night in shallow waters with strong currents. In effect only few British destroyers remained intact of this flotilla.\n\nUnfortunately Polish destroyers were not fited with modern anti-submarine devices /ASDIC=Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Commitee/ and air/surface radio-location /RDF=Radio Direction Finder later called RADAR=Radio Direction And Range/.First Asdick was fitted in July 1940 on ORP BURZA.Then gradualy all Polish vessels have all kind of Asdick,Radar and additional devices, like IFF /Identification Friend or Foe - working with radars/, HF/DF /High Frequency Direction Finder - fixing U-boats communication on short waves/,HEADACHE listening device of German radio-telephones/and DECCA /for better navigation/.\n\nOn the April 9th 1940,the Germany attacked and occupied Denmark. Then in few days they had landed in various parts of Norway. But there it was not so easy, the Norwegian were fighting gallantly together with some British, French and Polish troops landed there to stop German offensive in Norway. On April 10th to 13th a fierce fighting took part at sea between the German and the British units at Lofoten area with loss of 10 German and 5 British destroyers.\n\nIn mean time Polish destroyers took part as escort of the British battleships RODNEY and VALIANT at North Sea, then they left to Scapa Flow preparing for Norway.\n\nOn the April 19th 1940,the Polish destroyers : BLYSKAWICA /C.O. Cdr.St.NAHORSKI/, GROM /C.O. Cdr. A.HULEWICZ/ and BURZA /C.O. Cdr.W.FRANCKI/ left Scapa Flow for Lofoten-Norway.But BURZA having some damages during stormy weather had to return to Scapa Flow for few days repair.BLYSKAWICA and GROM arrived Lofoten and their task consisted in destroying the German shore batteries, enemy positions, viaducts, railroad and supporting Allied troops ashore with gun fire.\n\nOn the May 2nd 1940 BLYSKAWICA fought a duel with the German battery shore of 88 mm.The enemy opened fire and scored several hits.One shell fell into galley, two shells hit the port side, pierced the steam pipe and wounded three men. BLYSKAWICA responded with their 120 mm guns with about 100 rounds.The fire proved to be accurate and several enemy guns position were destroyed.\n\nEvery day the Polish destroyers were attacked by German aircrafts, but the gunners of both ships repelled those attacks with great devotion.\n\nThe GROOM too, harassed the German positions day and night with their guns.On May 3rd, she fired nearly 500 shells and destroyed one shore battery.But in the morning on May 4th 1940 one German bomber in surprise attack from high level drooped bombs which hit torpedoes at midship.The explosion broken the ship in two part and this brave and modern ship sunk in four minutes in the Rombaken Fjord near Narvik.\n\nAltogether killed in action : one officer /Lieut.eng. A.KRAKOWSKI/, 25 POs and 33 Seamen, moreover about 30 were wounded.All the wounded were placed on rafts,but German shore positions kept firing on survivors.The survivors were rescued by lifeboats of the British destroyers BEDUIN and FAULKNOR, cruisers AURORA and ENTERPRISE and taken on board of the British battleship HMS RESOLUTION.\n\nSame day befornoon, C.in C. of the British Naval Forces -Admiral of the Fleet the Earl of CORK and ORREY paid a surprised visit to theBURZA and said to her C.O. - Cdr.W.FRANCKI :/ according Lieut.Z.WEGLARZ/\n\n\"Captain, I come here especially to express my and all British seamen deep sorrow to let you know that your brave ship GROM has been sunk. Please rise steam and proceed to Herjang Fjord and transfer survivors and wounded men to hospital ship ATLANTIS.\"\n\n\"........ It was a sunny day but this news caused that the day changed into the dark night for the Polish officers and Seamen.\"\n\n\"About noon O.R.P.BURZA came alongside of HMS RESOLUTION and received all Polish survivors and wounded personnel from GROM.After that when BURZA casted off,the Royal Marines brass-band started the Polish national anthem : \"Poland is not yet defeated\", all crews of the RESOLUTION and the BURZA stood in attention and the Royal Marines presented arms.It was very touching moment and the Polish crew members will not forget this ceremony. Later on brass band of the Royal Marines played a known for seamen tune BEER BARREL POLKA.\"\n\nOn May 5th, the BLYSKAWICA took place of GROM in Rombaken Fjord, harassing German positions ashore. That day she was heavily attacked by the German aircrafts and on the evening she was hit by some shells of German shore battery 88 mm, but they did not cause major damage.\n\nOn May 6th BLYSKAWICA was attacked several times by aircrafts almost continuously. Many bombs exploded near the ships sides, her gunners shot down one and damaged two more aircrafts. In the following days the air raids continued.On May 10th, the German carried out very strong air attack which was effectively repelled and again one plane was shot down and another damaged.\n\nThe task of the BURZA in the Norwegian waters consisted of patrol duties Lofoten Fjords, covering landings of Allied troops in Narvik areas.This time C.in C. of Allied Land Forces - the French General BETHOUART had his headquarters aboard BURZA. Moreover BURZA took part in air defence Harstad in the Lofoten where a transhipping base of Allied forces was placed. Air bombing of Harstad and Skaaland were very frequent, some times up to 17 a day !\n\nAfter May 10th, the Polish destroyers BLYSKAWICA and BURZA left Norway and went to Scapa Flow and from there to Harwich-England.\n\nThe British Admiralty agreed to lease to the Polish Navy some of her ships for duration of war.The first ship was GARLAND / H 37/ where the Polish ensign was hoisted on May 3rd 1940. Next one to join the Polish Navy were destroyers PIORUN /G 65/ ex-Nerissa, KRAKOWIAK / L 115/ex- Silverton, KUJAWIAK /L 72/ex-OAKLEY, SLAZAK /L 26/ ex-Bedale.Moreover following submarines : SOKOL /N 97/ ex-Urchin, DZIK /P 52/ ex- P 52 and old JASTRZAB /P 551/ ex- S 25 USN. Besides some Motor Gun Boats: S1,S2,S3,S4 Motor Torpedo Boats : S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10 and ex-French ships OURAGAN,POMEROL,MEDOC, CH 11, CH 15\n\nMEANWHILE THE STRONG GERMAN OFFENSIVE AGAINST HOLLAND,BELGIUN,FRANCE WAS ALREADY UNDER WAY\n\nAgain the Polish historian E.KOSIARZ /according relation of Lieut.Z.WEGLARZ, Torpedo officer BURZA/:\n\n\"On May 24th, BURZA was recalled from a patrolling mission and dispatched to the area of Calais as reinforcement for the two British destroyers WESSEX and VIMIERA,which were busy shelling a German armoured column proceeding along a seaside road. BURZA also opened fire on tanks /1st Gun.Officer - Lieut-Cdr.J.TCHORZNICKI /. It did not long before a squadron of diving planes, 27 bombers strong, appeared above a group of ships.The first round of bombs hit the destroyer HMS WESSEX ,which soon went to the bottom.The HMS VIMIERA heavily damaged hid behind a smoke screen and did not take part in fighting. The air-attack was concentrated on the the BURZA. The enemy attacked her from various directions and from different altitudes.The Polish seamen bravely engaged in the fight.\"\n\n\"The situation was made worse by fact that the ships main guns were not adapted to anti-aircraft fire. The BURZA could defend herself only with 2 Vickers 40 mm, 2x2 Hotchkiss 13.2 mm and 2x4 Vickers 12.7 mm, but the crew did it so bravely and heroically that their fighting deserves the highest recognition.It should be all the more appreciated since the crew was fully aware of the danger that threatened the ship.In order to emphasize their will to fight and their indomitable spirit, the Captain W.Francki gave order to hoist biggest white and red flag up the mast.The attack by German planes lasted for about 15 minutes. The bombs falling near the ship disturbed the water with their explosions; the roar of the diving planes and the thunder of the artillery caused such a noise as the ears could hardly bear.The enemy then began to attack from low an altitude that some of the bombs did not have enough time to assume vertical position ; they fell into water sideways and bouncing,swept past the ship in horizontal flight.\"\n\n\"............The shocks were so strong that one could hardly keep up and the men often fell or dropped on their knees.At that time all the doors on the bridge fell out and all square watertight hatches stood open.The falling bombs caused fountains of water so high that frequently one could see nothing but water,smoke and steam.\"\n\n\"At one moment, three big bombs fell near the ship and their explosion caused the safety valve in boiler nr.1 to open and jam.The bomb reports and the thunder of guns were now joined by the deafening roar of steam which was escaping swiftly from the boilers through the jammed valve.The ship lost speed temporary.To make matters worse one a/a gun 40 mm got jammed at about that time,and the machine gun crew was running short of ammunition.The commanding officer Cdr.W.Francki then ordered to fire the torpedoes and to throw out depth charges to avoid additional explosions should the ship be hit by a bomb.The order was executed by 2nd Torpedo Officer - Sub-Lieut.J.TUMANISZWILI - This foresight unfortunately was justified. The ship standing still,was hit by two bombs.Fortunately the ships engine started again, after efforts of 1-st Eng.Officer : Lieut.L.SZMIDT and 2-nd Eng.Officer: Warr.off. WAWRZYNCZYK. Although the ship suffered damage,the German attack was not crowned with success : one plane was destroyed and another was damaged.The BURZA with her bow mutilated,managed to reach Dover under her own power ; from there she was towed to the shipyard in Portsmouth for repairs.\"\n\nOn May 27/28th BLYSKAWICA entered action for the evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk /Operation Dynamo/. At first she took part together with two other British destroyers in the evacuating British military staff from port of Dunkirk already in flames and on fire from the German tanks.There she was attacked by one plane and shot him down. In the English Channel she was attacked by planes and submarine but without success. BLYSKAWICA saved British destroyer GREYHOUND from sinking with a large number of evacuated soldiers on board when hit by bomb. She succeeded in towing HMS GREYHOUND safely to Dover. Next days on patrol duty in English Channel she attacked enemy submarine and several time opened fire on German planes. In the night 30/31 May she rescued 15 members of French destroyer SIROCCO which had been torpedoed by the German motor-torpedo-boats.During evacuation of Dunkirk Royal Navy lost 6 destroyers and 19 were damaged.\n\nWhen the Polish destroyers were fighting in Norway and off French Costs, the Polish submarines were very busy patrolling North Sea. On April 8th 1940 in the morning ORZEL/C.O.Lieut-Cdr.GRUDZINSKI/ spotted the German ship RIO DE JANEIRO- 6.800 tons - off Lillesand the southern shores of Norway carrying troops. ORZEL sent signals ordering ship to stop her engines, in accordance with international law. Then ORZEL hoisted signals to leave the ship in 15 minutes or the ship will be torpedoed. Because it was no answer and the German radio-man started to send alarming signals, ORZEL could not delay any longer and fired her torpedoes. RIO DE JANEIRO was hit and this time her deck swarmed with the soldiers who began to jump to the rafts.Next day ORZEL sunk one unindetified small naval vessel. On 15th ORZEL was attacked several times by enemy ships and aircrafts - altogether dropped on her about 110 of depth charges and she was forced to dive down to 105 meters.\n\nOn May 23rd ORZEL left for her last patrol, the tragedy probably occur on 25th May at position Latitude 57 degr.North and Longitude 3 degr.40 minutes East.She and her crew were lost without trace, probable a mine, aircraft or another mishap.Together lost : C.O. Lieut.Cdr. GRUDZINSKI, Lieut.A.PIASECKI, Lieut. eng.F.ROSZAK, Sub lieut.H.KAMINSKI, Sub.lieut.M.MOKRSKI, Sub.lieut.eng.J.SOSNOWSKI,midshipman/eng/ E.Brocki, Warrant Off./eng/. W.FOTEREK, Warrant off. J.STELMASZYK, 32 P.Os and 20 Seamen, moreover the British Liaison Officer and his two POs.It was a painful loss for the Polish Navy like theGROM in Norway - both very fine and modern ships with excellent crews.\n\nTheWILK /C.O.-Lieut-cdr. B.KARNICKI/ another Polish submarine while on patrol of North Sea on the June 20th had very unusual experience : she came unexpectedly at night upon a German submarine and rammed her.The attack was carried out by officer of watch - Lieut.B.ROMANOWSKI. Of course after that deliberate collision,the German submarine probably sunk, but WILK suffered severe damage and must go back to base at low speed.On July 15th WILK was again at sea on patrol but this time she was first spotted by German aircraft which dropped 6 bomb very close and 12 farther away.Damages were very small and ship returned to her base.In the second half of 1940 she carried out several more patrols but in 1941 WILK was transferred to the reserve and served only as the training submarine.\n\nDESTROYER O.R.P. GARLAND /H37/ Build at Airfield Eng.Co. at Glasgow 1936 L = 98.50 m , B = 10.50 m , T = 3.71 m\n\nDisplacement = 1854 tons Three boilers,two turbines = 34.000 HP Endurance = 5530 miles / 15 knots Maximum speed = 35 knots.

Cdr.A.DOROSZKOWSKI/ was in XIV Destroyers Flotilla at Ionian Sea/Mediteran Sea/ as one of the escorting ship, 5 Allied light cruisers.They met 3 Italian destroyers on the way to Tobruk. The Italian destroyer ESPERO was sunk. Although GARLAND did not took part in this fight, but it was her first encounter with enemy.\n\nOn July 8/9th GARLAND took part as the escort ship of the British Fleet consisted of the battleships WARSPITE, MALAYA, ROYAL SOVEREIGN, and the aircraft carrier EAGLE, 5 light cruisers and 16 destroyers. GARLAND duty was to escort the EAGLE. Same time the Italian Fleet was near Kalabria /Cape Stilo/ and had the battleships CONTE di CAVOUR and GIULIO CESARE, 7 heavy cruisers, 12 light cruisers and 24 destroyers. After short guns duel between battleships, the Italian battleship GULIO CESARE and the heavy cruiser BOLZANO were hit and the Italian Admiral decided to withdraw, leaving fight to aircrafts and destroyers. In this period of fight GARLAND used her guns with success.\n\nAgain the GARLAND /C.O. Cdr-K.NAMIESNIOWSKI/ on July 19th, while on patrol with the Australian cruiser SYDNEY and the British destroyer HAVOC and with another group 4 British destroyers met two Italian light cruisers BARTOLOMEO COLLEONI and GIOVANNI delle BANDE NERE near Cape Spatha at Crete Sea. The BARTOLOMEO COLLEONI was damaged by gun fire and sunk by torpedoes. Another Italian cruiser was damaged too, but escaped. This time GARLAND took part in fighting.\n\nOn July 18th 1940 Polish Navy received following ships from ex-French Navy : old destroyer OURAGAN/C.O.cdr.E.PLAWSKI then lieut.cdr.T.GORAZDOWSKI/,patrol-ships MEDOC/C.O. Cdr.R.STANKIEWICZ/ and POMEROL/C.O. Lieut.cdr.R.TYMINSKI-with 3 ensigns :French,Polish and British/ /nearly 900 tons with guns 4 x 100 mm and MGs/. Next day another ships : guard-boats CH 11 /C.O. Lieut.cdr.J. de LATOUR and CH 15 /C.O. Lieut.cdr. A.WACIEGA/-\"chasseur\"-nearly 100 tons,speed 16 knots and 1 x 75 mm and MGs- against submarines/. All this ships had the Polish crews and the French and Polish flags/ensigns/ ! MOTOR GUN / TORPEDO BOATS\n\nMoreover on 19 and 28 July 1940 two Polish motor-gun-boats S2 and S3 were commissioned and joined the Third MGBs Flotilla at Fowey. MGB-S1 joined the MGB Flotilla on August 1940, unfortunately she was lost during fire at sea together with her C.O. Lieut.T.SOKOLOWSKI on October 16th 1940. MGB- S4 joined in December 1942 and MTBs /Motor Torpedo Boats/ S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10 / in 1944/1945.\n\nInitially the Polish MGBs/MTBs were based at Ramsgate under command of Lieut.W.SZUSTER then Lieut.A.JARACZEWSKI.The following officers were in command of those boats :\n\nS1 - Lieut.J.SOKOLOWSKI,T.DABROWSKI,E.WCISLICKI,J.DOBRODZICKI S2 - Lieut.E.WCISLICKI,M.BOCHENSKI,W.SZUSTER,J.KRASUCKI S3 - Lieut.A.JARACZEWSKI,M.BOCHENSKI S4 - Lieut.L.ANTOSZEWICZ S5 - Lieut-cdr.W.SZUSTER,lieut.M.BOCHENSKI S6 - Lieut.J.DOBRODZICKI S7 - Lieut.cdr.A.JARACZEWSKI S8 - Lieut.S.KOPECKI S9 - Lieut.K.GORALCZYK S10- Lieut.R.DULLA,sub-lieut.J.SCHREIBER\n\nCharacteristic of MGBs and MTBs :\n\nMotor Gun Boats : ........................Motor Torpedo Boats:\n\nS1 ...S2.....S3..................................S4 to S-10\n\nDisplacement ...39 ....25......25................................ 47 tons Length / m / .....23.....19......19................................ 22.3 meters Breadth/m/ ........5. .....4.5.....4.5 ............... ...............5.5 meters Draught/m/ ........1.4 ...1.3.....1.3 ...............................1.7 metres Guns/mm/.......1x20+4x12,7+/4DC/...... /1x57+2x20 +4MG/,/torp/2x457 mm Engine /HP/....3450 ..2200...2200............................4500 HP Max.speed.......42.......35......35...................... .........42 knots\n\nCrew .......................2+10................. ........ .........2+15 /off+seamen/\n\nBLYSKAWICA and BURZA resumed duties after their repairs and overhauls.This time BURZA under C.O. - Cdr. DOROSZKOWSKI on August 8th West off Hartlepool received signal from British aircraft about position of German submarine. She came to this place and started attack with DC for about two hours. The attack was successful : on the surface of the sea big air bubbles appeared then large patches of oil. The British Admiralty declared : \" U-boat probably heavily damaged\".Two days later same situation occured again but effects of this attacks are not known.\n\nOn August 12th BLYSKAWICA /C.O.- Cdr.W.FRANCKI/ - while staying at Portsmouth took part in repelling heavy German air-attack and shot down one plane. On September 3rd 1940 BURZA spotted a periscope and together with BLYSKAWICA attacked U-boat with DC.Visibility was bad, results were not ascertained, although some crew member of BLYSKAWICA sighted enemy conning tower from distance about 700 metres and gunners open fire to this target, who then disappeared leaving large patches of oil on surface of the sea.\n\nDuring month of September BLYSKAWICA, BURZA and GARLAND another destroyer received from Royal Navy, were incorporated into the Fifth Destroyers Flotilla operating from Devonport.The task consisted in carrying regular patrols in the English Channel and off French Coast.This was necessary in view of the imminent threat of German invasion of England. Patrolling were at each night and days spent in Devonport but in 15 minute readiness what proved to be very hard service.\n\nIn the night October 10/11th 1940 twelve destroyers including BURZA and GARLAND took part in shelling French port and base Cherbourg together with British battleship REVENGE,cruisers NEWCASTLE, EMERALD and air bombardment. French shore gun batteries were put out of order and port of Cherbourg was left in flames.According information later received, German troops in port were annihilated.\n\nOn November 5th 1940 Polish flag was hoisted on British destroyer /ex-Nerissa/ and ship was named PIORUN /C.O. cdr.E.PLAWSKI/.\n\nDESTROYER\n\nO.R.P.PIORUN /G 65/ Build at John Brown Ltd Shipyard at Glasgow 1940 L= 108.7 m, B=10.87 m , T= 3.9 m\n\nDisplacement = 2384 tons Two boilers,two turbines = 40.000 HP Maximum speed = 36 knots Endurance = 5500 miles/15 knots\n\nArmament :\n\nGuns : 3 x 2 x 120 mm, 1 x 100 mm HA a/a, 1 x 4 x 40 mm a/a, 4 x 20 mm a/a. /Main guns have hydraulic control gears and gyroscopic stabilizers/ Torpedoes : 1 x 5 x 533,4 mm Depth Charges : 2 x Depth Charge Throwers, 2 Depth Charge Chutes\n\nCrew : 10 officers and 190 POs/ seamen\n\nIn the second part of October the Polish destroyers: BLYSKAWICA, BURZA,GARLAND, were sent to the Western Approaches with base in Greenock, where a new destroyer PIORUN joined them.\n\nBURZA /C.O.Cdr.A.DOROSZKOWSKI/while at convoy duty, received urgent message on October 26th 1940 to proceed with utmost speed together with the British destroyer ECHO to position about 75 miles from Ireland in West Atlantic where the big Canadian passenger liner EMPRESS OF BRITAIN /42.000 BRT/ was in critical condition. She was attacked and bombed by the German long distance aircraft Focke-Wulf. The ship was on fire, some life-boats were at sea with survivors and some were still on board in bad conditions. Several survivors were floating on the surface of the sea. BURZA rescued 254 persons including women. Similar number were rescued by ECHO.

Cdr.R.STANKIEWICZ, one midshipman and one P.O. died.Later in April 1941 all ex-French ships were given back to the Free French Navy.\n\nThe OURAGAN /C.O. Lieut-cdr.T.GORAZDOWSKI / and THE two British destroyers DOUGLAS and KEPPEL joined escort of the four British minelayers and the cruiser EDINBURGH North of Faroe Islands on January 1941. But later on she sustained several damages during stormy weather, including partly flooded engine and boilers-rooms /about 300 cubic meters inside!/ On April 30th she was handed over to the Free French Navy.This ship during her 287 days in the Polish Navy spent at sea only 31 days, 63 days at ports and 194 days at dockyards !\n\nWILK /C.O. Cdr.B.KRAWCZYK/ -the Polish submarine - left Dundee/IX Submarine Flotilla/for her last patrol on January 8th 1941 near southern coast of Norway.This is because she experienced several breaks down of her engines. She came back to Firth of Forth - May Island on January 21st 1941. After long overhaul and repairs she became a training submarine. The WILK on patrol duties from British bases covered 9.987 sea miles.\n\nOn January 19th 1941, the Polish flag was hoisted on board of ex-British submarine URCHIN,, named SOKOL /C.O. Lieut-cdr.B.KARNICKI / and joined III Submarine Flotilla, then on February 20th she joined IX Submarine Flotilla at Dundee.On April 10th again she joined V Submarine Flotilla at Portsmouth.\n\nSUBMARINES ORP SOKOL, ORP DZIK\n\nBuild by Vickers/Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness 1941/1942 Length=58.62 m , 60.00 m - Breadth=4.90 m , 4.88 m Draught = 3.9 m Displacement : /surface/=540 tons, /under water/= 735 tons Engines : 2 Diesels=820 HP, 2 Electric motors=610 HP Maximum speed : 12 / 9 knots,Endurance : 4050 miles/10 knots Armament : Torpedoes : 4x533,4 mm at bow and 4 spare Guns : 1x76 mm and 2 MG\n\nCrew : 4 officers+ 32 POs and seamen\n\nSokó³ ^\n\n\\/ Dzik\n\nAccording secret information's received by The British Admiralty, two German battleships the SCHARNHORST and the GNEISENAU left their base and proceed towards Iceland. To stop them following ships were sent on January 25th 1941 from Scapa Flow :the battleships NELSON, RODNEY and REPULSE with the Seven Destroyers Flotilla including PIORUN. They were operating West of Shetland Islands. After two days the cruiser EDINBURGH joined this force. During heavy storm PIORUN was damaged and left to Scapa Flow and Greenock for repairs.\n\nAfter overhaul of MGB-S1 /C.O. Sub.lieut. T.DABROWSKI/ joined Third MGB Flotilla at Fowey, on January 31th 1941.\n\nPIORUN/C.O. Cdr.E.PLAWSKI/ and GARLAND/C.O. Cdr.K.NAMIESNIOWSKI/ were on convoy duty south of Iceland on April 12th 1941 when PIORUN and the British destroyer LEGION were sent to position Lat. 64.50 N and Long 27.25 W to help auxiliary cruiser RAJPUTANA who was torpedoed. Unfortunately when they arrived this ship already sunk, so together with the British LEGION and French destroyer LEOPARD they rescued 290 survivors and landed them at Reykjavik. On April 19th both ships were in escort of the battleship RODNEY who unfortunately struck and sunk British trawler TOPAZ , this time PIORUN rescued only four seamen - remaining 21 were lost.\n\nOn May 22nd 1941 The Polish Navy received new \"Hunt\"-class destroyer KRAKOWIAK /C.O. Lieut.cdr. T.GORAZDOWSKI/ - /ex- SILVERTON/.On May 30th 1941 another new \"Hunt\"-class destroyer with name KUJAWIAK/ C.O.

Senior Officer of escort was captain P.L.VIAN on board of COSSACK.\n\nAt this time British Admiralty received information from Coastal Command that the German battleship BISMARCK and the heavy cruiser PRINZ EUGEN with some destroyers had left Korsfjord near Bergen and were heading North.C-in-C of Home Fleet Adm.J.C.TOVEY, based at Scapa Flow, sent to Danish Strait between Iceland and Greenland the battle-cruiser HOOD, the battleship PRINCE OF WALES and six destroyers.\n\nImmediately after the HOOD and PRINCE of WALES left Scapa Flow. Admiral J.C.TOVEY put out to sea with the battleships KING GEORGE V, RENOWN and the aircraft carrier VICTORIOUS and four destroyers.Polish Midshipmen on board the KING GEORGE V- were :K.ZUBKOWSKI, St.OLSZOWSKI, L.ANTOSZEWICZ, Z.CHMIELEWSKI, J.SUCHENEK-SUCHECKI.\n\nEarly On the morning of May 24rd,the HOOD and PRINCE of WALES /C-in-C Vice-Adm.HOLLAND/ engaged the enemy. An artillery battle began the attack, but unfortunately, in one of the first German salvos, the ammunition room of the HOOD was hit and, after an explosion,the vessel quickly sank. Out of her crew of 95 officers and 1.324 other ranks, only 3 men survived. The Polish Navy also lost four midshipmen : K.ZUREK, St.CZERNY, K.SZYMANSKI and L.TRZEBIATOWSKI. Later,the BISMARCK damaged the PRINCE OF WALES, which was forced to withdraw from engagement. However, one of the fuel tanks of the BISMARCK was also hit and this caused fuel to leak into the sea. Because of this the German C-n-C Vice-Adm.G.LUTJENS decided that his plan to act as raider on the Atlantic Ocean should be abandoned and that ship should return to the French port St.Nazaire. In addition, he instructed the C.O.cruiser PRINZ EUGEN to go to Brest under the cover of darkness.\n\nBISMARCK main artillery in action during night at Atlantic Ocean. Meanwhile time additional forces were engaged by British Admiralty in the search of the BISMARCK, not counting the cruisers SUFFOLK/Polish midshipmen L.KAWERNINSKI, J.PAWLOWICZ, A.PILARZ, W.SZUKSZTA/and NORFOLK /Polish midshipmen T.NOWOROL, J.REAUBOURG, M.WOZNIAK/already shadowing enemy.The Battleship RODNEY/ Polish midshipmen : L.DAAB, A.SULIGA, W.WCISLICKI, E.SOPOCKO,C.WROBLEWSKI/and her escort 4 destroyers left the convoy. Force H left Gibraltar with the battle cruiser RENOWN,the aircraft carrier ARK ROYAL and the light cruiser SHEFFIELD /C-in-C.Adm.SOMMERVILLE/. From Halifax left battleship RAMILIES. Besides the cruisers GALATEA, AURORA, KENYA, HERMIONE were in readiness to join the search.\n\nWhen those dramatic events took place, the PIORUN /C.O.- Cdr.E.PLAWSKI / was far away with the convoy WS 8B together with the British destroyers COSSACK, MAORI, SIKH, ZULU /Fourth Destroyers Flotilla - Captain Ph.VIAN/.\n\nIn mean time the BISMARCK was later hit by one torpedo from aircraft's of the VICTORIOUS on May 24th 2330 hours then on May 26th 2053 hours was hit again by two torpedoes from aircraft's based on the ARK ROYAL which caused damages to her rudder and one propeller.\n\nIn this situation the British Admiralty ordered Captain VIAN to leave the convoy and to join the search of the BISMARCK. This time the weather was very bad with heavy seas and poor visibility.\n\nThanks to report of the Catalina flying boat, Captain VIAN got new bearings for enemy and changed course of his flotilla accordingly,proceeding there with maximum possible speed.The ships were moving in line abreast at distance of 2.5 miles between each of them. The PIORUN came ahead of others and lost contact temporary with the British destroyers.At about 2200 hours she came unexpectedly upon a large ship. But fortunately this was SHEFFIELD who later disappeared.\n\nOn May 26th at about 2237 hours the Leading Seaman Edward DOLECKI on the bridge of the PIORUN was the first to observe a large ship. Cdr.E.PLAWSKI wanted to be sure of its identity and ordered an identification light signal. The answer were salvos of artillery fire .It was the BISMARCK which started with her 150 mm guns ! Immediately the C.O. of the PIORUN sent a radio message to Captain VIAN,who ordered to shadow enemy.The BISMARCK again opened fire 2242 hours with all her guns including main artillery against\n\nPIORUN and MAORI . Of course PIORUN returned fire using her small guns 120 mm ! /Ist Gun.Off.-lieut. K.HESS /. Later on 2355 hours she lost contact with the enemy due to heavy rain and very bad visibility. Because the BISMARCK lost her manouverability, Captain VIAN decided to give order torpedo attack by divergent or by subdivisions. This was only partly carried out by British destroyers which were in visual contact but results were questionable. According British, they obtain two hits and according to the Germans no torpedo hits from destroyers at all.\n\nOn May 27th at about 0300 hours the SIKH fired a star shell to give the PIORUN a current position of the BISMARCK, but enemy was not sighted here and PIORUN started its own search. About 0400 hours PIORUN met unexpectedly another ship : it was the British COSSACK which was recognized in time and spared of attack.\n\nPIORUN was ordered at about 0500 hours proceed to Plymouth for fuel oil When she came there only 30 tons left in fuel tanks!\n\nMeanwhile time the fate of theBISMARCK has been sealed. Her speed was only 10 knots and the distance to Brest still 400 miles. In her last radio-signal to the German Admiralty, C.O. asked only for U-boat to pick up the Log Book of the Bismarck.\n\nAt about 0845 hours the battleships KING GEORG V and RODNEY arrived and an artillery exchange began between the British and the BISMARCK, but very soon after half on hour her guns were put out of action and ship was in sinking condition and on fire. In addition two British cruisers the NORFOLK and the DORTSETSHIRE joined and put more 300 shells into BISMARCK .\n\nAt 1015 hours Captain LINDEMAN gave order to abandon ship . C-in-C of the British Fleet - Admiral Tovey gave order to stop fire and to sunk the enemy with torpedoes by the cruiser DORSETSHIRE. She fired two torpedoes into starboard side of the BISMARCK then one torpedo into her port side. The BISMARCK was sunk on May 27th- 1036 hours and from her 2300 crew, only 75 were rescued by the DORSETSHIRE, 24 by the MAORI and some by U-74 and hydrographic ship.\n\nIn the last phase of this combat , PIORUN was no longer taking part and after sinking of BISMARCK captain VIAN sent to C.O. PIORUN following signal :\n\n\"I congratulate you on the fact that yours was the first ship of my group to spot the enemy. I regret that for want of fuel you missed an opportunity of seeing the end....\"\n\nThis is worthy of notice that Vice-Admiral G.LUTJENS who in September 1939 was S.O. of the German destroyers against the Polish ships WICHER and GRYF in Gulf of Gdansk and in May 1941 the Polish destroyer PIORUN first spotted BISMARCK and in the effect caused his death at Atlantic.\n\nON JUNE 22nd 1941 GERMANY ATTACKED SOVIET UNION In July 1941 KRAKOWIAK /C.O. Lieut-cdr.T.GORAZDOWSKI/ and KUJAWIAK /Lieut-cdr.L.LICHODZIEJEWSKI/ after training period in Scapa Flow joined XV destroyers Flotilla at Plymouth/Devonport.\n\nOn July 24th, GARLAND /C.O. Cdr.K.NAMIESNIOWSKI/ left Scapa Flow with tanker OLIGARCH to Seidisfjord in the Iceland and from there took more two trawlers and joined Force A /C.O. Rear-Adm.P.L.VIAN/ in position : Lat.77.25 N and Long.10.35 E . This Force A consisted of THE cruisers AURORA, NIGERIA and destroyers PUNJABI, TARTAR with intention to inspect West Spitzbergen. On August 8th, GARLAND arrived Hvalfjord and same day to Reykjavik in Iceland.\n\nOn July 14th 1941 Great Britain and Soviet Union signed an agreement of mutual help in war efforts against the Germany. Same agreement was signed between the Poland and the Soviet Union on July 30th in 1941.\n\nThe German aircraft Heinkel 111 was shot down at Portsmouth roadstead on August 27th 1941 by the Polish MGB S2 /C.O. Sub.lieut.E.WCISLICKI/\n\nPIORUN /C.O. Cdr.E.PLAWSKI /and GARLAND /C.O. Cdr.K.NAMIESNIOWSKI/ took part in the operation HALBERD /Convoy to Malta /.On September 17th 41 they left Londonderry/Irland/ and joined a convoy WS 11 X / consisted of 9 passenger ships with troops in company of the battleship RODNEY, two cruisers and 11 destroyers /including Polish/. The convoy reached Gibraltar where Force H /C.O. Vice-Adm.J.SOMMERVILLE/was waited for them. Force H consisted of the battleships NELSON, PRINCE of WALES, two cruisers, the aircraft carrier ARK ROYAL and 7 destroyers /including 2 Polish/.\n\nOn September 27th 1941 about noon the Italian aircrafts attacked this convoy near island La Galite with bombs and torpedoes. The NELSON was hit by one torpedo. Afternoon same day a strong force of the Italian Fleet approached from North but later decided to withdraw. At last the convoy with Force H arrived Malta on September 28th. C-in-C Vice-Adm.J.SOMMERVILLE decided to send the NELSON back to Gibraltar for repair. Same day at evening the NELSON with escort of the cruiser EDINBURGH and destroyers PIORUN, GARLAND and two British left Malta. All ships arrived Gibraltar about noon on September 30th. But already on October 2nd 1941 they left with small convoy to U.K.. On board of PIORUN there were special passengers : 4 officers and 20 soldiers of the Polish troops which escaped from the German POW camps in France and special camps in Spain .They were transferred in Gibraltar from the Polish special and secret fishing motor boats /C.O. Lieut-cdr.M.KADULSKI/ operating in Western part of Mediterranean Sea.Thanks to his dangerous trips nearly 500 military personnel were transported from enemy shores to Gibraltar.\n\nIn this time also the Polish submarine SOKOL/ C.O. Lieut-cdr.B.KARNICKI/, was present off Sicily near St.Vito. SOKOL belongs to Tenth Submarine Flotilla at Malta.\n\nThe Polish MGB S2/C.O. Sub.lieut.E.WCISLICKI/ and S3 /C.O. Sub.lieut.M.BOCHENSKI/took part as escorts of the battleship REVENGE who attacked with her artillery the French base Cherbourg held by the Germans, on September 23rd of 1941.\n\nSOKOL /C.O. Lieut-cdr. B.KARNICKI/ on patrol duty spotted small Italian convoy on October 28th 1941 near island Ischia, escorted by one auxiliary cruiser and two destroyers. Torpedo attack with 4 torpedoes was successful : The transport ship CITTA di PALERMO /Displ.=5400 tons/ was hit and sunk. The Italian destroyers made an attack with depth charges but nothing happened.Three days later on October 31st, while going back to Malta, SOKOL sighted one ship without escort in position 38.05 N and 12.03 E and sunk her with gun fire.\n\nThe JASTRZAB /P551/ very old ex-USN submarine /S-25/ build in 1922 was under command of Lieut-cdr.B.ROMANOWSKI since November 4 th 1941, but till April 1942 she was under repairs and sea trials.\n\nSUBMARINE ORP JASTRZAB /P 551/ L=66.82 m, B=6.31 m, D= 4.6 m\n\nDisplacement = 823/surface/, 1072/under water/, tons Engines : Two Diesels = 1500 HP,two electric motors=1200 HP Endurance : 5000 miles/14 knots on surface Maximum speed : 14/10 knots Armament : Guns = 1x102 mm, 2 MG- Torpedoes= 8 x 533 mm Crew : 4 officers 35 POs and seamen.\n\nTHE JAPANESE SEA-BORN BOMBERS ATTACKED PEARL HARBOUR ON DECEMBER 7th of 1941 - USA ENTERED THE WAR.\n\nRaid against the German positions on Lofoten Islands started on December 22nd 1941 from Scapa Flow under the command of Vice-Admiral L.H.K.HAMILTON. Force \"J\" consisted of THE cruiser ARETHUSA, four Tribel-class destroyers and four Hunt-class destroyers/including the Polish KRAKOWIAK /C.O. Lieut-cdr.T.GORAZDOWSKI/ and KUJAWIAK /C.O. Lieut-cdr.L.LICHODZIEJEWSKI/, two Norwegian corvettes, three trawlers, two submarines and MS PRINCE ALBERT with the British and the Norwegian commandos. It was the operation ANKLET with main object to seize port Reine on the island Moskenesoy and to destroy the German supply and observation positions. On December 25th they sunk a German patrol ship FOEN, one minesweeper and several auxiliary units. From the transport ship three detachments went ashore and destroyed all military installations. Meanwhile another and similar action was carried out by, at island Vaagso by the special force under Rear-Admiral H.M.BURROUGH. All above mentioned ships returned to Scapa Flow on 3rd and 4th January 1942. On February 12th 1942, SOKOL/ C.O. Lieut-cdr.B.KARNICKI/ damaged by gun fire the Italian motor-schooner GIUSEPPINA - 800 BRT. The Boarding Party was sent to look for Log Book, charts and positions of mine fields, then the ship was sunk by explosives in position : L=34.15 N and L=10.55 E - her crew took to life boats.\n\nSame day in the English Channel the Polish MGBs : S2 /C.O. Sub.lieut.E.WCISLICKI/ and S3/C.O. Sub.lieut.M.BOCHENSKI/ took part in unfortunate operation of intercepting the German battleships GNEISENAU, SCHARNHORST and the heavy cruiser PRINZ EUGEN. The British battleships were far away in Scapa Flow, visibility was bad and the British Air Force was late to inform Admiralty in time. In the last moment Admiralty sent only few torpedo aircrafts and MTBs. One group of three British MTB was covered by the Polish MGBs . Torpedo attacks were carried out in spite of heavy gun fire, but without success. The Germans passed with high speed about 28 knots with air cover of 400 fighter planes. Only the British mines near Belgian and Dutch coasts partly damaged both battleships but they reached to Wilhelmhafen.\n\nOn April 25th 1942,the Polish submarine JASTRZAB put out to sea to protect the passage of convoy PQ-15 and soon entered her sector awaiting possible German ships. Minewhile the convoy changed his course to avoid the German U-boats and aircrafts and drifted into theJASTRZAB sector.There was very bad weather and poor visibility. The Escort ships managed to detect her by Asdicks.They made several depth charge attacks,in spite of identification signals by means of yellow smoke. Depth charges caused several damages and C.O. Lieut-cdr.B.ROMANOWSKI decided to surface. Two escort ships : The Norwegian destroyer ST.ALBANS and the British minesweeper SEAGULL opened fire from machine guns, staying in distance about 200 - 600 metres. The British signalman put in operation special investigation rocket but was killed instantly, same fate happened to another British signalman who tried to send signal by Aldis lamp. Captain showed Polish flag and in this time they stopped fire.\n\nBut this was not the end, ST. ALBANS came up to 50 meters and started fire again to some members of the crew on deck and SEAGULL too. At last from ST.ALBANS some one asked \"Are you German ?\" C.O.-Lieut-cdr. B.ROMANOWSKI already wounded, replied :\n\n\"No, we are Polish submarine JASTRZAB-P551 - Come alongside in order to take wounded\".\n\nJASTRZAB was in sinking condition. C.O. hand over his duties to Sub-lieut. A.GUZOWSKI,only one officer not wounded. Lying on deck were 5 crew members killed and 6 more, including C.O. - wounded. After transferring the crew to ST.ALBANS and SEAGULL - submarine JASTRZAB sunk in position Lat=72.14 N and Long=14.34 E on May 2nd 1942 about 2000 hours.\n\nThe British Liaison Officer - Sub.lieut.M.A.HANBURY -from JASTRZAB was wounded and transferred to Murmansk hospital and soon left Murmansk on board of the British cruiser EDINBURGH, but unfortunately she was torpedoed under way to U.K..Again he was rescued with remaining crew by the British destroyer MATCHLESS.\n\nSEAGULL was sunk under way to U.K. from Murmansk.Therefore nobody from SEAGULL could be a witness from this ship in Admiralty court in this affair.\n\nJASTRZAB sailed only 3.000 sea miles, four crew members were killed in action.\n\nThe most dangerous convoys were those directed to Murmansk, because of constant treat by the German Navy /cruisers, battleships and submarines/ and by the German Air Force. Moreover on the northern routes the crews suffered from frequent storms, biting cold and blizzards and deck armament was covered by snow and ice.The three Polish destroyers took part in those convoys : GARLAND / C.O. Cdr.H.EIBEL/, PIORUN/C.O. Lieut-cdr.T.GORAZDOWSKI/, ORKAN /C.O.-Cdr.St.HRYNIEWIECKI/,\n\nOn MAY 17 th 1942,the Polish destroyer GARLAND and the British destroyer VOLUNTEER left Greenock /Scotland/ with transport ship STEPHEN CASTLE to Reykjavik, then alone back to Seydisjord. On May 21th, a large convoy of 35 ships left Seydisfjord as PQ 16 to Murmansk. At first escort group consisted of the A/A cruiser ALYNBANK, five corvettes, three minesweepers and two submarines.Then a special Task Force was formed CS 10 : the cruiser NIGERIA/S.O - Rear-Admiral H.M.BURROUGH/ and 8 destroyers including GARLAND.\n\nTask force CS 10 left Seydisjord on May 23rd of 1942. Moreover the following cruisers joined : NORFOLK, KENT, LIVERPOOL.\n\nOn May 25th in position Lat=70.47 N and Long=00.42 E,Task force CS10 joined convoy PQ 16 already under way to Murmansk.This convoy consisted of large American ships very good armed with a/a guns. Same day another convoy PQ 12 from Murmansk to U.K. met them in this position. At evening when the convoy was in position Lat= 72.50 N and Long.=03.01 E, first attack of the German torpedo-bombers took place. One hour later during second attack one German plane was shot down by escort and merchant ships. From this time some more attacks took place. One merchant ship was damaged.\n\nIn the position Lat=72.50 and Long=05.47 E, on May 26th the four British cruisers and three destroyers left convoy. Right after that several attacks by the German torpedo-bombers took place but without success. At 1945 hours, in position Lat=74.00 N and Long= 12.00 E - no more enemy attacks\n\nGARLAND ^\n\nOn May 27th of 1942, early morning the Germans started again with air attacks with bombers, dive-bombers and torpedo planes. GARLAND moved closer to convoy. In mean time a German submarine attacked convoy but was repelled by GARLAND. About noon this day the Germans sent a dozens of planes from nearby bases in Norway, some times a group consisted of 20 or more planes. Unfortunately the weather was fine with sunshine and calm sea. In short time they sunk 6 big ships of convoy. But critical moment for GARLAND was about 1400 hours when she was attacked by seven bombers Ju-88. Four big bombs fell some few meters her starboard near gun nr.2, explosions killed and wounded several crew members, small fires broke out but GARLAND kept a/a fire with remain guns /1st Gun.Officer.- Lieut. J.BARTOSIK/. In this time a ships surgeon Lieut W.ZABRON distinguished himself in performing operations of wounded men on the table of wardroom during this difficult situation for nearly 36 hours until ship called Murmansk.CPO - P.PLONKA filmed some fragments with his camera from mast, until he was wounded by splinter. In this day GARLAND was attacked 22 times by planes.\n\nOn May 28th, the Senior Officer of the escort group Cdr.ONSLOW passing by on board of the British destroyer ASHANTI saluted her and ordered to proceed to Murmansk leaving convoy. This was because of several damages, wounded men and short of ammunition. Few minutes before midnight GARLAND took Russian pilot and entered port. There she landed 22 killed and 32 wounded POs and Seamen.\n\nGARLAND crew met at Murmansk rescued crew of Polish submarine JASTRZAB.\n\nAfter necessary repairs GARLAND left Murmansk to, Archangels and on June 26th 1942 with another convoy PQ 13 went back to U.K. without special troubles.\n\nBLYSKAWICA/C.O. Lieut-cdr.L.LICHODZIEJEWSKI/ resumed her duty at sea after repairs on July 20th 1942. On August 9th she was sent together with the British destroyer BROKE to help an escort of convoy SC- 94. Convoy consists of 33 transport ship and had escort of 7 warships from Canada to Great Britain. Convoy was attacked by the \"Wolf Pack\" of several U-boats and this time the Canadian destroyer ASSINIBOINE rammed and sunk U-210, but because of this she damaged and was forced to return to base.Other escort ships damaged two nore U-boats but one freighter was sunk.On August 8th, \"Wolf Pack\" resumed attacks on this convoy : 5 freighters were sunk and crews of 3 freighters left their ships in panic into lifeboats. Later crews of 2 freighters came back to their ships but 3rd was torpedoed and sunk.\n\nIn this situation arrived BROKE and later BLYSKAWICA .Third attack of \"Wolf Pack\" was repelled and the British corvette DIANTHUS rammed and sunk U-379.Then British Admiralty sent as an air support big bombers Liberator from Ireland and American flying boats Catalina from Iceland. On August 10th 1942 came another attack from 'Wolf Pack\"- they fired altogether dozens of torpedoes and sunk more 4 freighters. Next days and nights escort kept convoy without losses. At last the convoy arrived to U.K. ports on 13th August. Unfortunately this convoy lost 11 ships - 53.000 BRT. In this attacks took part 17 U-boats, 2 were sunk, 4 damaged.\n\nLater on BLYSKAWICA took part in 17 patrols and convoys including the big British passenger ships used as Troop-carriers .\n\nAccording to the relation of Lieut. T.LESISZ - Second Gunnery Officer BLYSKAWICA:\n\nIn second half of 1942 hundred thousands of American and Canadian troops were transported to U.K. with huge passenger liners called \"Monsters\" like British QUEEN ELISABETH /84.000 tons/, QUEEN MARY /81.000 tons/, French PASTEUR etc. They crossed Atlantic without escort having speed about 30 knots and zigzagging against eventual U-boat attacks. Somewhere 200 miles west of Ireland they were met with strong escorts until they entered safely home.\n\nOn October 2nd 1942, BLYSKAWICA ,the British a/a cruiser CURACAO and two \"HUNT\"-class destroyers took part in escorting the QUEEN MARY. The weather was very good, sunshine almost no wind and calm sea. Suddenly Leading Seaman WITKOWSKI reported submarine! Every one on bridge looked there but instead they saw a two part..... of the cruiser CURACAO floating on surface who was cut in two by QUEEN MARY. Captain LICHODZIEJEWSKI at once alarmed others destroyers to rescue survivors, but BLYSKAWICA continued escort of fast QUEEN MARY to the port. Only one Officer and 90 Seamen were rescued from crew of 420 officers and men. It was a fault of this young officer on watch who came too close to QUEEN MARY. Such big passengers ships /\"Monsters\"/ transported in 6 months from America/Canada to U.K. nearly 200.000 troops.\n\nKUJAWIAK /C.O.Lieut-Cdr.L.LICHODZIEJEWSKI/ took part in the Operation HARPOON or the convoy to Malta at the Mediterranean. On June 5th 1942, she and 3 British destroyers left Londonderry/Irland/ and joined Force T with special convoy WS 9 of six ships.\n\nForce T /C-n-C Vice-Adm.CURTEIS/ consisted of 3 parts : \"W\" - the battleship MALAYA,the cruisers KENYA and CHARYBDIS,the aircraft carriers ARGUS, and EAGLE and 7 destroyers. \"X\" - The A/A cruiser CAIRO, 8 destroyers/including GARLAND/ and 4 minesweepers. \"Y\" - One minelayer WELSHMAN, 2 corvettes and 6 trawlers.\n\nOn June 14th about 0800 hours the convoy was sighted by the Italian plane and from that time convoy was attacked by JU-88 aircrafts several times, in spite of heavy gun fire from ships and own aircraft's from aircraft carriers. Six enemy planes were shot down by ships and seven more by aircrafts fighters. One ship was sunk and the cruiser LIVERPOOL was damaged and was towed back to Gibraltar. At evening another air attack by some 50-60 planes, but this time enemy lost 11 aircrafts and the British lost 7 fighters. Unfortunately part \"W\" of Force T returned to Gibraltar on 2130 hours and WELSHMAN having speed about 40 knots left alone to Malta.\n\nOn June 15th about midnight, remaining ships passed through the Italian mine fields near Pantelaria island but in the morning the Italian cruisers appeared and started shelling from distance 18.000 meters. To repel enemy, the British cruiser CAIRO and 5 destroyers moved in direction of Italian ships to close distance and to attack with torpedoes. In mean time the convoy was attacked by bombers : one tanker was hit and damaged and later sunk by own crew. One plane was shot down.Two British destroyers: BEDOUIN and PARTRIDGE were damaged by the Italian cruisers. CAIRO was hit by torpedo and KUJAWIAK happily avoided one torpedo.Then again the German bombers JU-88 damaged an American ammunition ship, sunk later by own crew. About 1415,BEDOUIN was damaged and sunk by torpedo from the Italian aircraft.\n\nOn June 16th when convoy was close to Malta about midnight some ships were sunk on Italian mines laid by aircrafts : supply ship,three destroyers including KUJAWIAK and one minesweeper. KUJAWIAK was trying to help BADSWORTH and in this manoeuvre had struck a mine and sunk on 0108 hours June 16th 1942 in position Lat=35.52,2 N and Long=14.38,5E. Seven POs and six Seamen lost lifes and 7 were wounded. Only two of six supply ships arrived safely Malta.\n\nKUJAWIAK sailed 32.000 sea miles, had 11 patrols, 4 Atlantic convoys, 69 coastal convoys, 50 times she fought with enemy planes and shot down one plane and probably 4 more.\n\nMany times the Polish MGB,s demonstrated their daring in fighting .On June 22nd 1942 about 0105 MGB-S2/C.O. Sub.lieut.E.WCISLICKI/ detected six German E-boats near the French coast opposite Dover.Undetected MGB-S2 placed herself between French coast and the enemy, who was in moonlight.The Polish MGB-S2 made a surprised attack with 20 mm gun and all MG,s and damaged two enemy units. Another German E-boats tried to encircle the Polish one but lost their bearings and started fire against each others.In this situation MGB-S2 withdraw to NE Varne Buoy and joined another four British MGBS.\n\nAnother time on August 1942,Poles took part in attack on the German convoy near Calais escorted by 2 patrol ships, 6 minesweepers, 9 E-boats and 4 A/A ships.The main attack was executed by British MTBs and Polish MGB-S2/ C.O. Sub.lieut.E.WCISLICKI/ and S3 /C.O. Sub.lieut.A.JARACZEWSKI/ covered this attack by artillery fire against German escort.In effect two German ships were torpedoed and Poles sank one E-boat and damaged another. Unfortunately MGB-S2 was damaged too, but managed to return to base.\n\nOperation JUBILEE known as Raid on Dieppe was unsuccessful,dramatic in execution and tragical event. Later on, this operation was named a \" Bloody Landing \".The idea behind, was to get experiences in landing on enemy coasts,to test enemy preparations against future invasion and to destroy as many as possible enemy fortifications and radar stations - then to withdraw. Gen.Mjr.J.H.ROBERTS was in charge of this operation on board of the British destroyer CALPE. Under his command were : 2 Canadian infantry regiments, 1 British commando regiment, together about 6.000 troops. The Royal Navy arranged 9 big landing troop ships, 10 tank landing ships and nearly 180 small landing crafts. Escort consisted of 8 destroyers including SLAZAK /C.O. Cdr.R.TYMINSKI/ and 2 minesweepers flotillas. Safety at sea belongs to Cdr.J.HUGHES-HALLET on board CALPE. Air screen of this operation: 67 wings of aircrafts / including 6 Polish wings/, were under command of Vice-Marshall T.L. LEIGH-MALLORY.\n\nAt the beginning of night on August 18th, this armada started the passage of English Channel. Early morning about 0300 hours,armada was a few sea miles from her objects near Dieppe.Unfortunately some landing ships met with the German small coastal convoy and exchange of gun fire started between them.The landing operation was no longer a surprise for the German shore fortifications and troops. First landing crafts approached shore late with sunrise.When landing began the Germans met them with strong artillery and machine-gun fire. Strong German air formations very soon joined the battle.\n\nIn about 15 hours SLAZAK repelled nearly 30 air attacks, shooting down 4 enemy planes, fighting shore fortifications and field guns positions /1st Gun.Officer- lieut Z.PLEZIA/, took on board 20 wounded Canadian soldiers, rescued one British pilot and 5 German seamen. One bomb exploded very near SLAZAK and caused damages to her navigation and artillery fire.Three seamen were killed and 13 wounded.About noon Gen.Mjr.J.H.ROBERTS ordered to withdraw. From total 6018 soldiers taking part in landing 1410 were killed in action and 2200 were taken as prisoners of war.On board of ships were 550 killed and wounded, moreover British Air Force lost 190 airmen.\n\nSLAZAK arrived Portsmouth naval base same day on 1915 hours.\n\nSLAZAK ^\n\nOn October 19th 1942 BLYSKAWICA/C.O. lieut-cdr.L.LICHODZIEJEWSKI acting as temporary Senior Officer/ left Greenock with the British destroyers COWDRAY and BRANHAM to Gibraltar.\n\nBLYSKAWICA /C.O. - Lieut-cdr L.LICHODZIEJEWSKI/ took part in Operation Torch and left Gibraltar on November 1942 / Senior Officer Destroyers/ at first as escort of Force O then of convoy KMF A1 with landing troops against Algiers sector.\n\nIn spite of several German air attacks by JU-88 on November 7th, the convoy landed safely troops on November 8th about 0100 hours and sent a signal : \" LANDING SUCCESSFUL IN BEER GREEN\". But later BLYSKAWICA was sent to another sector of operation 110 miles East near Bougie to help the British destroyer ZETLAND damaged by aircracfts.Again landing at Bougie on November 11th about 0400 hours was successful but several air and submarines attacks on shipping were very dangerous.\n\nAccording to the German Marine Rundschau /1942/ s.936-938 - at Bougie bay and port:\n\nOn November 12th 2 transport ships were sunk, 12 ships,1 aircraft carrier,1 cruiser and 2 destroyers were damaged.\n\nOn November 13th 1 transport ship was sunk,14 ships, 2 cruisers and 3 destroyers were damaged.\n\nOn November 12th about 1100 hours when BLYSKAWICA was at roadstead of Bougie with another ships, about 30 - 40 German JU-88 made an attack.In spite of heavy anti aircraft fire, one bomb exploded very close to the starboard side : 4 seamen killed and about 42 were more or less wounded including the British Liaison Officer.But fire from BLYSKAWICA did not grow weaker, the wounded gunners were being replaced by the seamen of other specialities.The ship was damaged too, having about 200 minor punctures, gun nr.4 was out of action. About 1215 hours BLYSKAWICA enter port Bougie to transfer wounded men ashore, but again in this time port was attacked by 15 German JU-88 and 3 bombs fall down into water near starboard side and one from this series exploded ashore at port side.Following this, gyro and part of electrical circuit were damaged. BLYSKAWICA left port Bougie at 1551 hours and at 1745 hours a ceremony of sea burial took place for 4 killed seamen / 2 Polish and 2 British / in position Lat=36.57 N and Long= 04.37 E.\n\nBLYSKAWICA having speed only 5 knots arrived Algiers same day at 2228 hours.On November 13th 2020 hours she left Algiers for Gibraltar, were she arrived on November 15th 0410 hours for repairs.\n\nAn Encouter with the E-boats- as told by first Gunnery Officer ORP KRAKOWIAK-Lieut.J.TUMANISZWILI\n\nThe action I shall now relate took place in October of 1942.We were escorting a pretty large convoy we'd picked up from Milford Haven and were approaching the Eddystone Lighthouse, which marks the entrance to Plymouth/Devonport. A few minutes before 2000 hours the Commanding Officer - cmdr.J.TCHORZNICKI walked in to his way to the bridge. He said : \"We just received a radio message about enemy activity in the sector we are about to enter.Please call me up as soon as you need me.\" A few minutes later, already on the bridge,I was in communication with the ship's artillery.I heard gun masters reporting their readiness. I also heard the short wave radioman reporting German chatter.E-boats were getting ready to attack.We fired starshells,and at the same time the radioman heard a high -pitched voice ordering a torpedo attack against the destroyer.In the yellow lights of the first"
