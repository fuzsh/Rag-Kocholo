        "text": "I have long been eager to explore the Canadian Maritime Provinces and Quebec City. What better way to explore these gorgeous places in Canada along with the iconic New England cities of Boston and Bar Harbor than on the Holland America Cruise Canada and New England?\n\nWe spent eight days on the magnificent Zuiderdam as our base, exploring charming ports brimming with rich history, jaw-dropping landscapes, fun excursions, and scrumptious seafood and local cuisine.\n\nI flew into Boston, where I embarked on a 7-day cruise that ended in Quebec City. We enjoyed every port. Here are our adventures below.\n\nItinerary\n\nDay 1: Embark in Boston, Massachusetts\n\nDay 2: Bar Harbor, Maine\n\nDay 3: Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nDay 4: Sydney, Nova Scotia\n\nDay 5: Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island\n\nDay 6: At Sea, St. Lawrence River\n\nDay 7: Quebec City, Canada\n\nThe Ship\n\nHolland America’s Zuiderdam was perfect to spend the week on. With only 1964 passengers, they really go “overboard” (pun intended!) to make each guest feel special.\n\nThe Zuiderdam is a medium ship, which is what we prefer over mega-ships. It’s also a premium cruise line, meaning that they are very attentive to their passengers, which is what we experienced in spades, especially since it was their 150-year anniversary.\n\nWe loved our veranda cabin – incredible to watch sunrise or sunset on a personal basis, watch scenic landscapes go by, and just a great place to hang out with your cabin mate and a bottle of bubbly.\n\nMusic is an absolute priority on board. One whole deck is dedicated to live music venues. Called the “Music Walk,” it includes a rock club, a jazz club, dueling pianos, and a theater for live dance performances and comedians.\n\nWe took advantage of the hot tubs – a great place to relax after a busy day of excursions.\n\nWe ate delicious food in the main dining room on most nights, with two dinners in the specialty dining venues, Canaletto and Pinnacle Grill, which were fantastic, especially the lobster tails with filet mignon.\n\nPre-Cruise\n\nWe flew into Boston and stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza, an exquisite historic hotel in the Back Bay area and the official hotel used by Holland America. I highly recommend arriving at least a day early and staying at this official hotel to ensure you’re taken care of in case of flight issues. You’ll also want extra time to explore this historical city.\n\nGuests place their luggage outside of the hotel door on the morning of embarkation for them to be picked up and transported to the cruise ship. We then proceeded to the ship via a bus provided by the cruise line.\n\n1 Boston\n\nBoston at a Glance\n\nPopulation: 654,776 (2021)\n\nFounded: September 7, 1630\n\nSales tax: 6.25% avalara.com\n\nDemonym: Bostonian\n\nI was born and raised in Rhode Island, and then spent 20+ years as an adult living in New Hampshire. So I know Boston pretty well, and in my opinion, it’s one of the best and most interesting walking cities in the US (driving is a whole different matter!).\n\nIt’s one of the most historically important cities in the United States, from the Pilgrims landing on nearby Plymouth Rock to the many sites associated with the struggle for Independence along the legendary Freedom Trail.\n\nIt’s a culturally rich waterfront city and foodie haven, with the best cannoli on the Earth (yes, including Italy, I’ve had both) to its iconic Irish pubs, and world-class Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox baseball team.\n\nAnd don’t forget to try the legendary Dunkin Donuts coffee – the best coffee in the United States – accompanied by either a maple frosted doughnut or (duh) a Boston cream doughnut.\n\nYou may be interested in “Boston’s Best Canoli Challenge.”\n\nFor more information on visiting Boston, read my full article “10 Best Couples Things to Do in Boston.”\n\n2 Bar Harbor\n\nBar Harbor at a Glance\n\nPopulation: 5,535 (2018)\n\nSettled: 1763\n\nKnown for: gateway to Acadia National Park\n\nThe quintessential Maine coastal town of Bar Harbor is charming and packed with charming shops, bakeries, ice cream shops, and museums.\n\nBar Harbor is also a prime spot for whale watching and kayaking and a popular port for cruise ships like Holland America.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, Bar Harbor is where you can indulge in some legendary Maine lobstah (lobster)! Many people choose to forgo an excursion and spend this port day in the harborside village, just steps from the pier.\n\nIn addition to strolling around the cute port town, we chose to spend our day exploring stunning Acadia National Park, one of the top 10 most visited national parks in the USA.\n\nAcadia National Park covers 47,000 acres on the coast of Maine and is the only major national park in New England. One of the top-visited national parks in the United States, Acadia National Park Photo spots are simply something you should not miss on your trip to New England!\n\nLocated on Maine’s Mount Desert Island, the park has many unique features to make it worth a visit. This coastal gem offers craggy granite cliffs, miles of forested trails that glow in the fall, biking on the historic carriage roads, adrenaline-spiking hikes, kayaking on Jordan Pond, and enough photographic beauty to please every kind of traveler.\n\nFor more information on visiting Acadia National Park, read my full article “10 Acadia National Park Photo Spots You Can’t Miss!”\n\n3 Halifax\n\nHalifax at a Glance\n\nPopulation: 431,479 (2017) United Nations\n\nCity: 1842\n\nHighest elevation: (793.6 ft)\n\nProvince: Nova Scotia\n\nKnown for: Nova Scotia’s largest city, provincial capital & cultural hub\n\nThe Nova Scotia province of Canada is known for its 4,600 miles of rugged coastline, picturesque fishing villages and small coastal towns, rich history, and stunning natural beauty. These charming Nova Scotia towns offer visitors a glimpse into the province’s unique maritime culture along with stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nPeggy’s Cove, Lunenburg, Mahone Bay, Blue Rocks, and Louisbourg are five of the prettiest and most Instagrammable places to see in the Canadian Maritime Provinces.\n\nFor more information about visiting Halifax, read my full article “These 5 Charming Nova Scotia Towns Really Exist!”\n\n4 Sydney\n\nIn all honesty, there’s not too much to do around the port in Sydney. After researching, I decided we could have a fun day with great photography opportunities by visiting the historic fortress outside Sydney. It was the perfect choice!\n\nLouisbourg at a Glance\n\nThe buildings you see represent only 25% or so of Fortress of Louisbourg’s original footprint.\n\nGuests can pay for special activities such as firing a musket or cannon or designation as Prisoner of the Day outfitted in an iron collar for 30 minutes and be fed bread and water.\n\nThe fort was built in 1744 to protect and provide a base for France’s lucrative North American fishery and to protect Quebec City from British invasions. It is an accurate representation of a French garrison with much of the original materials repurposed during the restoration.\n\nDescribed as “the jewel of all Canadian historic sites,” the reconstructed fortification is a one-quarter partial reconstruction of an 18th-century French fortress on the rocky shore of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia which was once a thriving seaport and capital of Cape Breton Island.\n\nThe entire complex is a huge living museum with costumed actors scattered about the streets, re-enacting town life during the 1700s. You can strike up a conversation with armed guards, visit the chapel, get some cooking tips from a servant, or grab it bite from the bakery.\n\nI came attired in a generic medieval dress which photographed well, especially flouncing about the lovely gardens. Granted, it wasn’t authentic or as simple as the colonial peasant women interpreters were wearing, but it suited my purpose and brand, and we had a blast with our photo ops! Artistic vs. authentic in this case.\n\nThe Fortress of Louisbourg was featured on the TV show, The Amazing Race.\n\nFor more information on visiting the fortress, read my full article, “Relive History at Louisbourg Fortress.”\n\n5 Prince Edward Island\n\nPEI at a Glance\n\nArea: 2,185 mi²\n\nPopulation: 156,947 (2019) StatCan\n\nCapital: Charlottetown\n\nLength: 175 miles\n\nIndustries: Tourism, agriculture, fisheries\n\nFamous For: Anne of Green Gables (book)\n\nPicturesque Prince Edward, aka “the Gentle Island” and “PEI,” is the smallest province in Canada and one of eastern Canada’s maritime provinces, off New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The large island is known for its painted storybook houses, stunning red-sand beaches, rolling sand dunes, 19th-century lighthouses, seafood like lobster, oysters, and mussels, and of course, the literary heritage as the inspiration behind the beloved Anne of Green Gables novel. Even though it’s a small island (you can drive the entire length of the island in less than three hours), things to do in Prince Edward Island abound!\n\nWe did a tour set up for us by PEI Tourism, but I suggest that you rent a car and drive around the small island so you can see more. In addition to the charming downtown with pedestrian-only Victoria Street, you can also Cavendish beach and cliffs, North Rustico fishing village, Confederation Bridge, Lucy Maud Montgomery’s childhood home (the inspiration for Anne of Green Gables), and other highlights.\n\nFor more information on visiting PEI, read my full article “Best Things to Do in Prince Edward Island.”\n\n6 Sea Day\n\nFull transparency, I’m usually not a fan of sea days. But I really enjoyed my one sea day on the Holland America Canada cruise.\n\nIn the morning, I sat in on the lecture on the World Stage which gave interesting information on how the ship is run.\n\nHigh tea in the afternoon was fun! We met up with some other passengers that we’d met and enjoyed sharing tea and tiered silver serving trays of petit fours that were to die for.\n\nWe also enjoyed a couples’ massage performed by well-trained aestheticians\n\nBut my favorite part of the sea day on the Holland America Canada cruise was the Orange Party. Inspired by its Dutch heritage, a la King’s Day, Holland America celebrates one night on each cruise as “Orange Party.” Guest are encouraged to wear their best orange attire, and have photo ops with orange wigs, glasses, bowties, etc.\n\nWe had a blast with our new friends, dancing until the live band went off stage for the night!\n\n7 Quebec City\n\nQuebec City at a Glance\n\nLanguage: French\n\nEstablished: 1608\n\nPopulation: 542,298 (2017) United Nations\n\nArea: 187.6 mi²\n\nProvince: Quebec, 150 miles north of Montréal\n\nFounder: Samuel de Champlain\n\nI tell you the truth, Quebec City is the prettiest city in North America. There are so many beautiful places in Quebec City that we were not able to see all of them, having only one day to spend there. Which means I want to go back, tout de suite!\n\nOne of Canada’s most visited cities, Quebec City feels like you’ve been transported to a small village in the French countryside in Europe. So it’s no surprise that, like me, most people who visit immediately fall in love with the utterly charming old-world architecture and vibe.\n\nThe postcard-perfect UNESCO old town has colorful 15th-17th century architecture, cobblestone streets, bougie boutique shops, charming cafes and bistros, and an abundance of green spaces; there are enough beautiful places in Quebec City for an Instagram extravaganza.\n\nI felt immediately in sync with this scenic city sitting on the St. Lawrence River. You see, my inheritance is that ALL my ancestors emigrated from France and Belgium to the Quebec province, to Rhode Island. The Canadian French sounded nostalgically in my ears like every family event on my paternal grandparents’ side; even the heavily accented English sounded like their conversations. I was overjoyed that I would be able to find the yummy food of my childhood: tourtiere, crepes, quiche, bouillabaisse, and croissants. The food of my youth always has my mouth watering.\n\nThere is so much more to the city besides the Chateau Frontenac, gorgeous as that is. I highly recommend Place Royale, Place de Paris, and just strolling around the lower town. Our guided tour with Holland America Line introduced us to the layout of the city and some of the highlights, and then we continued to explore on our own. We were dead tired at the end of the day, but oh so worth it!\n\nDid you know that the Fairmont Chateau Frontenac lays claim to being the most photographed hotel in the whole world? And what a stunning beauty it is!\n\nI especially loved strolling around lower town, especially idyllic photo spots like Breakneck Stairs and Rue du Petit Champlain (one of North America’s oldest commercial streets) for shopping therapy.\n\nAnd of course, I had to try one of their irresistible “beaver tails,” a scrumptious pastry – a flat, oval, fried dough pastry made to symbolize a beaver’s tail, topped with sweet confections such as frosting, cinnamon, Nutella, or other condiments. It is similar to American doughboys or elephant ears.\n\nGetting an iconic photo with this hotel in the background was #1 on my list of things to do in Vieux Quebec (Old Quebec). But as is my custom, I went over the top finding the most Instagrammable spots.\n\nFor more information on visiting Quebec City, read my article “Beautiful Places in Quebec City for Instagram Envy!”\n\nConclusion\n\nHolland America cruise – Canada and New England is a great way to see this part of the world at an affordable price. They take wonderful care of their passengers and offer excellent shore excursions. I can’t think of a better way to check these off my bucket list\n\nMost photos by Kary Kern.\n\nClick below to PIN so you can find Holland America Cruise Canada & New England again:\n\nDisclosure: The author was honored to be the guest of Holland American Line during her stay, but as always, the opinions, reviews, and experiences are her own.\n\nThis article may contain affiliate/compensated links.
