        "text": "Seychelles is one of the best Beach Destinations in the World. The beautiful island country is blessed with clear blue waters, pristine white sandy beaches, and exotic sea life. The 115-island country is within the Indian Ocean off the East Coast of Africa and has the least population among other independent African countries. Seychelles had been a French and an English colony, but the influence of the French is stronger than that of the English. Once you have traveled to Seychelles, you will remember its exotic beauty forever. After Seychelles whichever Beach I have seen, I have always compared that with the Beaches in Seychelles unconsciously. Seychelles is one of them in the World. Its name comes at the top amongst Best Beach Destinations too. Here is sharing my complete Travel Guide for planning a trip to Seychelles. top Travel Destinations\n\nAbout Seychelles\n\nArea if Seychelles: 459 Sq Km\n\nThe population of Seychelles: 98,347 in March 2020\n\nCapital City of Seychelles: Victoria\n\nThe currency of Seychelles: Seychelles Rupee (used locally) and Euros (preferred by Tourists)\n\nCurrency Conversion : 1 SCR = INR 5.44 , 1 Euro = 82.82 in March 2020\n\nLanguages Spoken in Seychelles: French, Seselwa (Creole) and English\n\nWhen did I travel to Seychelles?\n\nIn mid-July 2017\n\nFor how many days did I travel to Seychelles?\n\nHow many people traveled with me to Seychelles?\n\nI traveled with my Parents\n\nHow did I go to Seychelles from India?\n\nMy flight Details:\n\nAir Seychelles Flight at 5.25 A.M. on a Friday. The flight cost me INR 15000. Keep checking rates of Flights at Skyscanner.com, sometimes flights to popular destinations, drop to very reasonable prices Skyscanner.com. We reached the Seychelles International Airport at 8.20 A.M. Flight duration is 4 hours 25 minutes.\n\nWe flew to Mumbai via Air Seychelles at 10.05 P.M. on a Thursday from the Seychelles International Airport. We reached Mumbai at 4.10 A.M.\n\nWhere did I stay in Seychelles?\n\nCar Booking in Seychelles for visiting the significant spots\n\nSelf-drive Cars Counters were available at the Airport, which might have been much cheaper than hiring a chauffeur-driven car. My father was not too keen on me driving a car in a Foreign Land; hence we opted for the second option.\n\nWe booked a car on our second day in Mahe to go about all the significant spots in Mahe Island. It cost us a hefty SCR 3000 (nearly INR 15000). The driver cum guide was courteous and knowledgeable.\n\nFerry Booking in Seychelles for traveling between the Islands\n\nFrom Praslin to La Digue: I booked from the Cat Cocos Website again. The Cat Rose ferry took around 15 minutes to reach La Digue, and the ride was not too bumpy. The views of the ocean are breathtaking.\n\nPlaces I Visited in Seychelles\n\nWe enjoyed a meal with a panoramic view of the sea at Le Jardin Du Roi Spice Garden, a lush hilltop garden and restaurant. The garden cultivates a wide variety of spices, including vanilla, nutmeg, and citronella, as well as endemic plants, all of which feature in meals served at the establishment. One can learn about the plants’ cultivation and use, and visit the small museum testifying to the Island’s vibrant spice trade in the past. One can shop for some spices, homemade jams (must buy), and marmalade, and stop in the yard to see the pet tortoises. This is a Must-Visit on your Seychelles trip.\n\nVictoria is the capital of the Republic of Seychelles, located on the northeastern coast of Mahé Island, the largest Island in the Seychelles group.\n\nThere’s the Victoria Clocktower, which looks like a mini Big Ben. It’s a replica of the clock on Vauxhall Bridge in London, which was brought over in 1903 when Seychelles became a British colony. There’s also a cathedral, Natural History Museum, a Hindu temple, and Botanical Gardens with spice grove and mini rainforest.\n\nBeau Vallon is a bay on the north-western coast of Mahé in Seychelles. Beau Vallon Beach is a well-frequented and is possibly the most famous beach on the Island. It is a base for diving and snorkeling due to its clear waters and coral reefs. Beau Vallon has several hotels and restaurants.\n\nAnse Royale is one of the most popular beaches on Mahé, located on the south-east coast of the Island. The small town that lies next to the Beach shares the name “Anse Royale,” and contains numerous different facilities, including a petrol station, hospital, banks, the Seychelles university, and a number of various accommodations. Getting to the Beach is simple, thanks to the nearby public parking and bus stop. Buses in all islands of Seychelles charge a flat rate of SCR 5. One can board and exit at any bus stop on the entire Island. One can bring their snorkel gear and check out corals and fishes here. This is a Must-Visit on your Seychelles trip.\n\nThis is the best Beach in Praslin, according to the Tripadvisor. But in my opinion, this Beach can quickly be listed on the Best Beaches of the World. The sand is fine and white; Water is different shades of Cobalt and Turquoise. The Beach is surrounded by tropical trees, and Boulders are strewn over randomly. Do carry your swimwear and snorkel gear. The water is so clear that corals are clearly visible. The Beach is at a distance of nearly one kilometer from the nearest Bus Stop. One has to Travel to Seychelles to truly understand the beauty of this Beach. This is a Tripadvisor Must-Visit on your Seychelles trip.\n\nThis is one of Seychelles’ two UNESCO World Heritage Sites (another one is Aldabra Atoll ), this ancient forest is home to the wondrous Coco de Mer palm, which has the largest seed in the World, and many other birds, plants and reptiles, many of which are found nowhere else in the World. Visiting the Vallee de Mai is a step back in time and a unique experience.\n\nCoco de Mer palms are incredibly rare, growing naturally on just two islands in Seychelles. The government strictly monitors these trees, which the IUCN classifies as endangered. This fruit grows to huge sizes and resembles the hips of a Woman.\n\nLa Digue Island is the third largest Island in terms of population, but only has about 3,000 people! The Island is still the third most-traveled Island in the archipelago since it is easily accessible from Mahé and Praslin. Air Seychelles offers short island hopper flights from to Praslin, but nothing from La Digue — there’s no airport on La Digue, only a helipad. To preserve the Nature of this Island, there are no Motor Vehicles, only battery carts and bicycles are allowed to operate. Hiring a battery cart can be expensive, but renting bikes hourly wise is affordable.\n\nI will highly recommend opting for a bicycle. One can take the cycle around the Island. The tiny Island can be covered in just one hour if you are a good cyclist. When you get into port, you’ll see a few different bike rental places, and they’ll get you set up to ride anywhere you need to on the Island.\n\nWe went for a day trip to La Digue, did not stay the night, but in the future, I will like to stay back the night. We had our lunch at the Ferry Port Cafe. Trip to La-Digue Island is the highlight of my Travel to Seychelles. This is a Must-Visit on your Seychelles trip.\n\nCurieuse Island is a small granitic island 1.13 sq mi in Seychelles close to the north coast of the Island of Praslin. Curieuse is notable for its bare red earth intermingled with the unique coco de mer palms, one of the cultural icons of Seychelles. This Island is strictly protected to allow Giant tortoises to prosper.\n\nTo reach Curieuse island, One has to book a boat/ ferry ride from Cote D’or Beach, Praslin. It takes around 20–30 mins to achieve this national park and enjoy its biodiversity park. There is a fee to this Island of approx 70 Euros. The Large Tortoises roam freely on the Beach, one can pet them, but take care not to disturb them too much.\n\nShopping in the Victoria Market\n\nOne can find local fruits, vegetables, herbs, eatables, souvenirs, trinkets, wall hangings, paintings, and apparel. I purchased a few Fridge Magnets and Wall Masks for my friends.\n\nThe timing of the Market is 8. A.M. to 6 P.M. On Sundays, it remains closed.\n\nMy Travel Tips and Tricks for Seychelles\n\nSeychelles offers a maximum stay of 30 days. To obtain the Visa on Arrival for Indians visa, they must hold an onward or return ticket and funds of minimum US$ 150 per person per day, along with proof of accommodation.\n\nRent a self-drive car from the Airport only if you are a good driver. This way, getting about the Islands of Mahe and Praslin is more comfortable and cheaper than a chauffeur-driven taxi or car. Driving in Seychelles is on the left side of the road. The roads on Mahe are low-traffic, mountainous, narrow streets, so caution is generally advised. The ways usually have steep drops or low walls on the side instead of curbs, which can make driving on the narrow streets stressful, especially if driving a large vehicle.\n\nLocal Bus Sevice is excellent at Mahe and Praslin. The bus fare is a fixed rate of SCR 5 to anywhere within the route.\n\nCarry and if you are keen on swimming in the Ocean and enjoying the under-water views. Snorkel gear\n\nCarry a good Sunscreen Lotion for the face and exposed skin. I get tanned easily in Beachside sun like a lot of people.\n\nTake care of your Caps/Hats/Scarfs/Goggles while sitting in the deck area of the Inter-Island ferries, the sea breeze is steady and lose accessories fly off a lot. My dad’s flew off while traveling to Praslin. Sunglasses\n\nCarry some Euros cash. Do not exchange some money at the Airports as rates are exorbitant. ATMs are plenty, use a useful Forex Card to withdraw cash from the ATMs. An example of the best Forex Card for Indians is the Niyo Global Card\n\nCarry an excellent waterproof camera to capture the beauty of the underwater. I use an, and the Olympus Tough TG-6 Waterproof Camera is a good option too. GoPro Hero 7\n\nMust-Try Foods in Seychelles\n\nLocal food at the numerous Departmental Stores in Mahe and Praslin.\n\nEat your lunch at the local food stalls beside the Beau Vallon Beach in Mahe Island. Very Tasty options of Fried Chicken and Rice and salad.\n\nLunch of Meat Rice and curry with fruit salad was great at this Sri Lankan Lunch house named Breeze Garden in Praslin Island.\n\nTry the Local Beers of Seychelles, Sey Brew, and the Seychelles Blonde.\n\nHow much did the Seychelles trip Cost?\n\nIn 2017 the entire Seychelles trip cost us about INR 80k per person inclusive of Flights, considering the fact my parents are old, and they like to travel at an unhurried pace.\n\nTwo of my friends who are married went to Seychelles for their Honeymoon in December 2016, and their trip cost them about INR 1 lakh per person. They booked beachside Resorts as their mainstays.\n\nFor Indians, Seychelles is not precisely what you call an inexpensive destination. Still, with meticulous planning, one can easily pull off this trip in a tight budget of at least INR 70k per person.\n\nMore on Planning a Seychelles Trip\n\nTo read the best account of all the things to see in Mahe Island, head to Lucy’s Blog.\n\nTo read about what La Digue Island has to offer, head to The Blonde Abroad Blog.\n\nRead about another of my equally amazing trips to Jordan here."
