Attention will also be paid to current living conditions - housing, education, newspapers, clothing, etc.that are all too often ignored in standard bibliographies; and to those particular aspects relevant to individual countries. Each volume seeks to achieve, by use of careful selectivity and critical assessment of the literature, an expression of the country and an appreciation of its nature and national aspirations, to guide the reader towards an understanding of its importance. The keynote of the series is to provide, in a uniform format, an interpretation of each country that will express its culture, its place in the world, and the qualities and background that make it unique. The views expressed in individual volumes, however, are not necessarily those of the publisher.\n\nVOLUMES IN THE SERIES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 23 24\n\nYugoslavia, John J.

Its small population’s fortunes are inextricably linked with the seas that lap its shores - the seas provide fish for food and for export, and shape the beauty of its many islands which attract tourists from all over the world. The scattered separate islands, which number more than a hundred, contain a great variety of bird, marine and animal life but the majority of the population live on the main island, Mahe. Seychelles is noted for its agreeable climate as well as its scenic beauty. The absence of the cyclones and bad weather conditions that make other islands in the Indian ocean so vulnerable has allowed vegetation to flourish, although the early visitors to the then uninhabited islands did a great deal of damage. Seychelles is the only country in the world to have two World Heritage sites - Aldabra atoll and the Vallee de Mai on the island of Praslin. The small nation’s charm and its people’s relaxed way of life belie a volatile political scene. Since shortly after independence in 1976 one man has dominated the country - France-Albert Rene, at the head of a one-party state run on avowedly socialist lines. However, in December 1991 he announced an unexpected constitutional change, heralding the return of multi-party democracy. The 115 islands which form the archipelago of Seychelles are scattered over 1.3 million square kilometres of ocean; the islands themselves are mainly coralline but the biggest, Mahe, and thirtynine others are granitic. Mahe has an area of 154 square kilometres, is mountainous and lies a few degrees south of the Equator, 1,800 kilometres east of the Kenya coast at Mombasa, 3,300 kilometres south west of Bombay and 1,100 kilometres north of Madagascar. The other islands comprise only a further 300 square kilometres in total and 98% of the population live on the granitic island group of Mahe, Praslin and La Digue. The total population of Seychelles is xm\n\nIntroduction 67,000. The capital and only port, Victoria (which is on Mahe), has a population of 25,000. Most of the granitic islands rise steeply out of the sea and Mahe’s highest peak, Morne Seychellois, rises to 903 metres at the summit of the long ridge which runs most of the length of the island. The other islands are coral reefs still in the process of development, so they lie close to the surface of the ocean. Aldabra atoll, where thousands of giant land tortoises roam free, rings a lagoon bigger in area than Mahe but the majority of the coralline islands are very small. The maximum shade temperature in Mahe at sea level is 29 degrees C but during June to November, when the south-east trade winds blow, this can fall to 24 degrees. The mean annual rainfall, recorded at Victoria, is 2,360 millimetres. The uninhabited Seychelles islands, containing an abundance of trees and vegetation as well as giant crocodiles and land tortoises, were probably first visited by Arab seamen in the twelfth century. In 1502 the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama sighted the Amirantes, the group of coral islands West-South-West of Mahe. Although it was a British East India Company expedition that first put down on record its visit to the Seychelles in 1609 the French showed a more active interest during the 18th century, claiming possession in 1756. Governor General Rene Magon of the tie de France sent Captain Nicolas Corneille Morphey on an expedition to take possession of the archipelago; Morphey unveiled the Stone of Possession on the rising ground above present-day Victoria on 1st November 1756. Morphey, in the service of King Louis XV, was by origin an Irishman whose father’s name was O’Murphy. The islands were named after the influential French family of Herault de Sechelles which Governor General Magon was anxious to influence and into which he eventually married. Captain Morphey spelt Seychelles in a variety of ways in his official report but the French officially adopted the name Sechelles; the British later anglicized the name to Seychelles. In 1770 Brayer du Barre, a French businessman, came from the tie de France (the name given by the French to the island of Mauritius) and established a small settlement. But with only a handful of settlers and slaves the plantations of maize and rice got off to a slow start and it was not until 1789 that an administrator named Malavois began to develop agriculture and apportion land to new settlers. However, little progress had been made by the time of the French Revolution and a British Naval squadron took possession of the islands without difficulty in 1794, at a time when the population was less than two thousand. French administration continued on the islands under the xiv\n\nIntroduction redoubtable Chevalier Queau de Quincy but the British did not relinquish their hold, even during the period 1802-03 when the fighting stopped due to the Peace of Amiens. In 1804 a neutrality agreement with Seychelles was concluded and until 1810 sometimes the French flag flew over the small capital, sometimes the British. In 1810 the British invaded and captured the He de France, establishing their sovereignty over the islands in the south-west Indian Ocean, including Seychelles, by the Treaty of Paris in 1814. Britain had little interest in settling or developing these territories. She needed them to secure the route to India and prevent France from establishing naval bases in the region. The island of Reunion, today a departement of France, was returned to France as the British considered its port facilities worthless. The ile de France was given back its old Dutch name, Mauritius, and Seychelles from that time until 1872 was administered from Mauritius. The fortunes of Seychelles began to wither, the authorities in Mauritius showing scant interest in the scattered group of islands which lay a thousand miles to the north. The French settlers had some success in growing cotton but competition from America put an end to this enterprise. The abolition of slavery was viewed with horror by the white settlers and the British administrators wrote alarmist notes to London forecasting the ruin of the economy if the cheap labour provided by the black slaves was withdrawn. The freed slaves refused to work on the plantations - as was common in other parts of the world where slaves were released. The Seychellois had to make do with a limited trade with Mauritius and try to develop their fishing and boat-building industries. The British attempted to introduce a more English way of life, which included converting people to the Protestant religion, but the Seychellois remained staunch Catholics, though in practice morals were lax; Catholic priests were not allowed to reside in the islands until the 1850s. The islands continued in poverty despite some attempts later in the century to separate their finances from those of Mauritius and stop the disruptive effects of anglicanization. At the end of the 19th century the export of copra products at last began to improve the fortunes of the islanders. The people of Seychelles today are a more homogeneous group than that of the islands of Mauritius and Reunion. The wealthy French families of Mauritius and Reunion imported indentured labourers from India to work on their sugar plantations but the rocky and precipitous terrain of Seychelles was unsuitable for growing sugar cane. In fact, the population diminished in the years immediately following the abolition of slavery and the end of the cotton industry as some of the Seychellois moved to Mauritius to find work. In 1826 xv\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe population of Seychelles was 7,665; it fell to 5,586 in 1842 and then began to rise again slowly. By the middle of the century it was 6,811. Slaves taken by British naval ships from illegal slavers still working the African coast were sometimes landed, as free men, on Seychelles and the population today is almost totally Creole, with just a sprinkling of families of Asian and Chinese origin, together with the few descendants of the original French settlers. By the end of the 19th century the population of Seychelles, like that of the other south-west Indian Ocean islands, had grown rapidly and was approaching 20,000. Gradually the links with Mauritius were broken, beginning in 1888 with the appointment of an administrator presiding over an executive and a legislative council. This was followed in 1897 by a governor subordinate to the governor of Mauritius. The historian Auguste Toussaint writes that an English woman, Mrs E. H. Edwards, reported that the new constitution did nothing to improve conditions in the archipelago. She pointed out that the Seychelles budget at the time showed expenditure on salaries amounting to 121,845 rupees, the total budget expenditure being 219,898 rupees. ‘Thus,’ she commented, ‘it costs this dependency 121,845 rupees to administer the expenditure of 98,053 rupees in the interest (or otherwise) of the country.’ In 1903 Seychelles was at last completely separated administratively from Mauritius and given its own governor; the result of the appointment of Sir Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott, a Colonial Office man who was determined to run his own colony. At this time the regular sea links with Mauritius had been halted, which made communication between the two groups of islands difficult. The Suez Canal was opened and the route round the Cape lost its importance. The British used Seychelles as a convenient location to exile its opponents from other colonies - the Ashanti King Prempeh I from Ghana and Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus both spent time on the islands. Seychelles struggled to diversify its economy away from copra to vanilla and other crops, following a fall in the price of coconut oil. The discovery of a synthetic substitute for vanilla added to the fragility of the colony’s economy and the European war which began in 1914 meant that trade with the German possessions in East Africa was severed. Seychelles was so short of money that in 1918 Mauritius made the crown colony a grant of 100,000 rupees to help balance its budget. By 1931 the population had risen to more than 27,000. The depression in Europe was followed by the 1939-45 war. Seychelles had little chance of development and once more a period of neglect set in. But the spread of modern communications was beginning to open up the remoter parts of the world and political change began to affect xvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeychelles. The closure of the Suez canal in 1956 meant that the Cape route was once more an important highway for shipping. The tiny islands of Seychelles began gradually to assume a strategic import¬ ance far in excess of their modest political stance and resources. The first political party, the Seychelles Islanders United Party, led by Rifned Jumeau, was founded in 1963 with the aim of improving the standard of living of the people of Seychelles. The following year, as nationalist feelings grew, two young lawyers formed political movements - the SPUP (Seychelles People’s United Party) of FranceAlbert Rene and the SDP (Seychelles Democratic Party) of James Mancham. The first constitutional conference was held in 1970 when Rene pressed for full independence but Mancham favoured con¬ tinued association with Britain, on the grounds that Seychelles could not survive on its own. In 1967, as a consequence of the Suez crisis, the British Labour government created the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). The BIOT consisted of three islands in the Seychelles group, Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches, together with the archipelago of Diego Garcia (previously) part of Mauritius whose main island became the site of a United States defence base under an agreement with Britain. The agreement was to continue ‘until the island was no longer needed for defence purposes’. As part of the BIOT settlement Britain funded a new airport for Seychelles, capable of taking the biggest commercial flights. After the airport opened in 1971 the tourist industry began to play an increasingly important role in the economy. France-Albert Rene’s radical, socialist stance appealed to most members of the Organization of African Unity and by 1974 James Mancham decided that he had no option but to back the call for full independence as well. Without OAU backing the islands would have become even more isolated. In the elections that year the numbers of votes cast for each party was close but the ‘winner takes all’ system meant that the SDP got thirteen seats and the SPUP only two. Following the 1975 Constitutional Conference the SDP and the SPUP formed a coalition government in order to provide a smooth transition to independence the following year, a move Mancham was later to regret. The final constitutional conference was held in January 1976; the Republic of Seychelles became independent on 29 June 1976 with Mancham as President and Rene as Prime Minister. At the same time the three islands which were part of the BIOT were returned to Seychelles. However the US base on Diego Garcia was by this time in the course of expansion and under an agreement with the Mancham government the Americans installed a satellite tracking station high up in the mountains overlooking Victoria. The coalition XVII\n\nIntroduction\n\ngovernment which was due to last until new elections in 1979 came to an abrupt end when Mancham was ousted in a coup d’etat while he was attending the June 1977 Commonwealth summit meeting in London, barely a year after independence. Rene became leader of a new regime which styled itself revolutionary and socialist and adopted a one-party constitution. Rene became President under the new constitution, nominated by the newly formed People’s Progres¬ sive Party (SPPF), the only political party then allowed in the country. By this time the discovery of plots against the government had caused him to seek military assistance from Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. During the next few years there were several plots or rumours of plots causing the government to assume emergency powers. A number of people were detained although they were all eventually released. Some discontent arose, principally among the middle class, because of the new socialist policies. There were public demonstrations against the introduction of a compulsory two-year period of youth service, which was later made voluntary and its provisions modified. None the less, many among the working class appreciated the better financial deal they were getting from the new government and seemed to support Rene’s policies. In 1981 the Irish-born adventurer Mike Hoare led a group of South African-based mercenaries disguised as tourists in an attack that was foiled at Seychelles airport. The majority of the mercenary force hi¬ jacked an Air India plane and flew back to South Africa - where they were subsequently tried. Hoare and his second in command were imprisoned. The Seychellois authorities captured six of the mer¬ cenaries and four were sentenced to death, although they were later pardoned by Rene and allowed to go free. At the time, Mancham denied involvement in the coup attempt. The following year some Seychellois soldiers mutinied, although their quarrel was more with their senior officers than with the President. Their brief insurrection was quickly put down with the aid of the Tanzanian garrison. Other plots were uncovered but in 1984 Rene was elected, unopposed, for a second five-year term as President. In 1985 Mancham, who was working as a business consultant, announced his resignation as leader of the London-based Mouvement pour la Resistance but Gerard Hoareau, a Seychellois who had been prominent in the exiled group and succeeded Mancham as MPR leader, was assassinated in London. It later emerged that his telephone had been tapped and three British citizens were charged and sentenced for unlawfully doing so. While the Seychelles tourist industry faced difficulties as a result of these disturbances, the government endeavoured to diversify the economy, opening a tuna-canning factory and planning a prawn\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nfishery project on one of the outer islands. Although the British government did not approve of Rent’s policies and style of government and gave minimal aid, other countries were happy to help Seychelles. The SPPF government claimed to be non-aligned but there was no doubt of the USSR’s vigorous support, especially with security. Following the resignations of a number of leading members of his government over the years Rene reshuffled his government in 1986, taking the posts of Minister of Finance and Defence himself. In 1987, thirty-six SPPF candidates contested the twenty-three elective seats in the Assembly with an increased proportion of the electorate casting their votes compared with the previous election. In 1988 a constitutional change allowed members absent from the assembly to be replaced by SPPF members appointed by the President. In 1989 Rene was elected for his third five-year Presidential term and the BBC began broadcasting to East and Southern Africa from a new short-wave relay station on Mahe, becoming the biggest consumer of electricity in Seychelles. Faced with criticisms of communist-bloc influence Rene was able to point to the American tracking station and the BBC relay station as evidence of his country’s evenhandedness. While other countries in Africa had bowed to the new winds of change and begun dismantling their one-party states, Seychelles seemed determined to carry on with its system of government - now often criticized as dictatorial - established after the overthrow of President Mancham in 1977 and legitimized in 1979. Pressures on Rene were, however, increasing. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe had meant the loss of his powerful Russian protector, and at the Commonwealth summit in Zimbabwe in November 1991 it was clear he was becoming isolated. At the same time the economy faltered, due to a decrease in the number of visitors caused by the Gulf war. In December, at an extraordinary SPPF congress Rene proposed the introduction of a pluralist political system and invited exiled Seychellois to return to play a responsible role. He subsequently explained this U-turn by saying that the one-party state was introduced because it was essential that people worked together in order to promote economic development. ‘Now with the developments going on in the world at this particular time we felt it would not be a bad idea if we could move to such a system, but always keeping in mind the need for national unity,’ he said in an interview. Three stages in the new constitutional developments were planned. Elections would first be held for the members of a constitutional commission, which would incidentally determine the support each\n\nxix\n\nIntroduction\n\nparty attracted. The constitution these members drew up would be put to a referendum and followed by general elections before the end of 1992. Eight parties registered for the elections and a new Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation was established, meant to be free of government control. James Mancham returned to lead his revived SDP and a new Parti Seselwa (Seychellois Party) which had started as an underground movement led by an Anglican priest, Wavel Ramkalawan, started to publish a popular bi-weekly newspaper Regar (Look). The election of the constitutional commission was held on the last weekend of July 1992 when the SPPF won 58.4% of the votes and the SDP 33.7%. The Parti Seselwa came third. Observers concluded that the more effective organization of the SPPF, coupled with its popularity among the working class, who had gained materially during its years in power, had put Rene’s party ahead. Mancham’s return gave an impetus to his old party, despite its tardiness in declaring exactly what it stood for. The leaders of the Parti Seselwa were young and untried although their ideas appealed to many of the middle class. But the electors threw out the constitution that was presented to them in November. Needing a 60% vote for approval the proposals got 53.7% from an 81.9% turnout. The constitutional commission was sent back to reframe the constitution - this time without a deadline. While this ensured that Rene’s government remained in power for the time being, it also gave the opposition parties time to organize themselves more effectively. After three months’ work, commencing in January 1993, the revised constitution would be submitted for approval once again by referendum, to be followed by general and presidential elections. The bibliography Because Seychelles was administered as a dependency of Mauritius up to the beginning of the 20th century many of the early works about Seychelles also deal with Mauritius. Thus Auguste Toussaint’s History of Mauritius includes a large number of references to Seychelles. Moreover, as many historians and researchers have dealt with the island nations of the south-west Indian Ocean as a whole there are a number of more recent books which include Seychelles rather than dealing with the country in isolation. A number of the most important of these books have been included in this selective bibliography which is aimed at the English-speaking reader who seeks the appropriate paths of study. Before the international airport opened in 1971, Seychelles was\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction accessible only by ship and there were few tourists. Thus a book like J. A. F. Ozanne’s Coconuts and Creoles, published in 1936, is of special interest - Alec Waugh reported that it was the only book on Seychelles listed in the London Library when he was planning his visit to Seychelles which resulted in Where the Clocks Chime Twice (published in 1952). The large section on Flora and Fauna reflects the keen interest in the natural history of the islands, from both amateurs and professional scientists. I have included a number of travel guides because, although they go out of date fairly quickly, they do have sociological interest. Some of the books I have included are available only in Seychelles and although some are in typescript or flimsily bound they are carefully preserved and annotated at the excellently run National Archives and the National Library. At the time of writing a fine new building to house the National Archives, National Library and Museum is under the course of construction in Victoria. Books in French, and some other European languages, have not been excluded. Much of the important early writing on Seychelles is in French due to the country’s colonial background. France has maintained a cultural and political involvement with Seychelles so there has been a continued production of books in French dealing with Seychelles. Since 1977 the Seychelles government has placed much emphasis on the use and teaching of Kreol and a number of books in Kreol have been published locally. I have included many of them. The bibliography is divided into chapters, some with sub-headings, in order to help the general reader, the specialist and the research student find out more easily about the varying aspects of the country. There are cross references where appropriate. Within each chapter the books are listed alphabetically by title. Articles in learned and other journals dealing with Seychelles are included within the comments on the appropriate book title. There are three indexes, one for authors, one for titles and one for subjects. The references are to entries. There is also a glossary, a list of abbreviations and acronyms and a chronology. Seychelles was originally spelt Sechelles by the French and although anglicized by the British, to this day the name Seychelles should not be accepted in law. I am indebted to Julien Dump’s article in L’Echo des ties (February 1991) for an explanation of the name and its orthography. I have used the accepted anglicized version thoughout the bibliography. President France-Albert Rene wrote a number of books in which his first name was unhyphenated or shortened and the accent dropped from the last letter of his surname, presumably to underline the country’s new ‘authenticity’ and the practice in Kreol. I have included these variations of spellings as they xxi\n\nIntroduction\n\nappear in the various book titles; otherwise I refer to him as FranceAlbert Rene. I have used the spelling ‘Kreol’, which is itself a Creole form, when referring to Seychellois Creole; I refer to other Indian Ocean island mother tongues as Creole. All views expressed in this bibliography are my own and the responsibility for any errors or omissions are mine as well. Acknowledgements Seychelles is unrivalled for its natural beauties but I can think of no more agreeable place to have undertaken research for this book than the first floor readers’ room in the handsome building, with its fine views across Victoria harbour, that housed the Seychelles National Archives in 1992 (the new library and archives centre was still under construction). The collections of books and documents in Seychelles, although modest in comparison with those of larger and richer countries, were without exception carefully housed and looked after with dedication. I could not have asked for greater cooperation from everyone in my work. I would like to thank especially Mrs Lina Ernesta of the Seychelles National Library, Mr Julien Dump and Miss Margaret Mondon of the Seychelles National Archives, those two veteran bibliophiles Mr Kantilal Jivan Shah (who conjured books, new and old, from his extensive collection) and Mr Guy Lionnet (who showed me the nutmeg trees in the Botanical Gardens and is the most quoted author in this book) and in London the staff of the libraries of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, the Commonwealth Trust, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the School of Oriental and African Studies, the British Museum (Natural History) and the British Library. Finally I would like to thank His Excellency Mr Sylvestre L. Radegonde, the High Commissioner for Seychelles in the United Kingdom, for his help and encouragement, and British Airways for making it possible for me to travel to Seychelles to undertake research for this bibliography.
