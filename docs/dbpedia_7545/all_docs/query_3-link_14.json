        "text": "Carlos Lacerda, the outspoken governor of the State of Guanabara, Brazil, between 1960 and 1965, used the publication of Manual of the Homeowner (1965) as the occasion to educate the new residents of Vila Kennedy, a publicly financed low-income housing complex built in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro, about their new homes. ‘Fellow Homeowner’, wrote the governor to the several hundred municipal citizens who had recently been resettled from a favela (shantytown),\n\nIn the pages that followed the governor's introductory remarks to the former favelados, the manual instructed the new residents of Vila Kennedy in the basic domestic tasks associated with their new, modern households. The accompanying illustrations showed an immaculately dressed white woman cleaning the house, hanging out the laundry in the backyard, disposing the trash and registering their children at the local school. In the minds of the urban planners associated with the Guanabara Popular Housing Company (COHAB-GB; founded in 1960), the institution in charge of low-income housing and the co-publishers of the Manual, the resettled favelado required instruction on the proper use of their new environment. Deeply influenced by the general assumptions of the theory of modernization, the guide contrasted the domestic practices of a ‘traditional’ peasantry, such as food cultivation and animal rearing in close proximity to the home, with the more modern, urban domestic practices suitable for the orderly conditions of the modern home. One of the goals of the manual, in fact, was to discourage the new inhabitants from turning their backyards into farms.\n\nFive years later in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Municipal Housing Commission (CMV; founded in 1964) distributed To Enter into the Present, a user's guide for the low-income families relocated to the new neighbourhood of Ciudad General Belgrano. In the guide's preface, a picture of a set of keys preceded the words: ‘These keys that we are giving you serve to enter into the present, this present in which every human being has the right, that of light, air, the comforts and simplicities of modern life, a home worthy of our time.’Footnote 2 As in the Brazilian case, an optimistic and prescriptive discourse on homeownership, space and domestic behaviour defined modern urban life.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, working in concert with bilateral and multilateral development agencies based in the United States, inaugurated a number of public housing developments for low-income families. In greater Rio, these efforts included the construction of about 9,000 popular housing units in communities named Vila Kennedy, Vila Aliança, Vila Esperança and Cidade de Deus. In Buenos Aires, about 10,000 popular housing units were built during the urbanization of Parque Almirante Brown and the construction of housing complexes in Villa Lugano I–II, and Ciudad General Belgrano. These new communities of low-income city-dwellers and their built environments were made possible largely thanks to a Cold War conjuncture that channelled technical and economic assistance from the United States to Latin American public authorities as part of a larger programme for foreign aid and regional co-operation known as the Alliance for Progress, announced by United States President John F. Kennedy in March 1961. Affordable, decent housing was, in fact, one of the key targets of the multilateral plan. In this regard, housing policy became an important aspect of inter-American relations and foreign aid during the 1960s.Footnote 3\n\nThis article analyses the emergence of a new transnational modernizing sociological and urbanist discourse on the urban home during the 1960s. This discourse became an organizer of urban space and domestic life, as well as an instrument of political and social intervention that operated across national and international borders. Largely animated by the Alliance for Progress, the urbanists, diplomats, politicians and social scientists arrayed in academic institutions, international conferences, ministries of foreign relations, state planning offices and multilateral agencies formulated languages of decent housing for a burgeoning urban population. The urban housing ‘problem’ came to be defined as a challenge of: (a) physically building urban housing to the standards of Western capitalist democracy; (b) defining the state's role as an agent of material modernization, democratization and the social integration of the urban dweller; and (c) applying the social sciences to the technocratic administration of planned housing, redevelopment and urbanization. Within the sociological and political circuits of knowledge produced to address the Latin American path to post-war modernity, housing policy emerged as a discursive and practical antidote to underdevelopment, poverty and social instability.\n\nIf United States and Latin American urbanists shared a transnational optimism about the role that housing might play in the modernization of the so-called underdeveloped world, Brazilian and Argentine officials were particularly concerned with the displacement caused by housing policies adopted by the populist regimes of Getúlio Vargas (president-dictator of Brazil 1930–45 and again president 1951–54) and Juan Domingo Perón (president of Argentina between 1946 and 1955). Labelling the policies of their predecessors economically irrational, deficient and demagogic, the planners of the 1960s used the multilateral appeals of expanded access to homeownership and ‘decent’ living conditions as means to promote middle-class habits, mass consumption and moderate political behaviour, especially among the poor. The housing component of urban planning and urban renewal thus came to be a desired outcome of modernization: an antidote to an irrational politics of working-class populism and a prophylaxis against the spectre of social upheaval and anti-Americanism that framed US–Latin American relations after the Cuban Revolution.\n\nWithin this historical conjuncture, then, the article considers public housing in Rio and Buenos Aires in its transnational, comparative and local dimensions. The analysis is animated by the new cultural approaches to the history of US–Latin American relations that challenge us to think about hemispheric relations in terms of ‘contact zones’. A formulation first coined by Mary Louise Pratt, such zones refer to that range of networks, exchanges, borrowings, discourses, behaviours and meanings ‘whereby the external became internalized in Latin America; to the way in which foreign people, ideas, commodities, and institutions have been received, contested, and appropriated’. Contact zones are sites of transculturation. As Gilbert Joseph argued, ‘contact zones are not geographic places with stable significations; they may represent attempts at hegemony, but are simultaneously sites of multivocality; of negotiation, borrowing, and exchange; and of redeployment and reversal’.Footnote 4 I argue that public housing in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro is precisely one of these zones built by multivocality, by negotiation and by unstable borrowings.\n\nThe house built via international, public financing is a contact zone par excellence. Located at the intersection of the local domesticity and transnational policies, the home is the ideal space in which to understand a series of expectations, ideas and discourses about family, customs, social behaviour, intimacy and material wealth. Within discourses of modernization and development, the house became not only the locus of improved living conditions for the urban poor, but also, as part of the modern built environment, became an agent of cultural transformation. However, the notions attached to the new spatial arrangement and living conditions were not imposed externally; they were the outcome of the exchange and negotiation of widely circulated meanings, circumscribed by local and national conditions.\n\nThe selection of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires allows the historian to study similar projects in rather dissimilar national and local contexts where the degree of conflict varied according to the local political circumstances, the different dimensions of poverty and the balance of power among different actors. Yet despite these differences, both cities undertook urban reform and housing projects in the 1960s and received financial and technical aid from the United States for the first time. Interestingly, the notions of modernity that shaped these plans shared a similar vision of the role of housing in modernizing people's lives. Finally, the inter-American connection to these projects – all counted upon bilateral and multilateral technical assistance and direct aid from the United States and the Inter-American Development Bank, among others – provides direct insight into the actual operation of circuits of knowledge and their practical outcomes in the built environment."
