        "text": "‪Seychelles‬\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSeychelles, officially the Republic of Seychelles, is a 155-island country (as per the Constitution) spanning an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, whose capital, Victoria, lies some 1,500 kilometres (932 mi) east of mainland Southeast Africa, northeast of the island of Madagascar.\n\nOther nearby island countries and territories include Zanzibar to the west, Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agaléga and Réunion to the south, and Comoros and Mayotte to the southwest.\n\nSeychelles, with a population of 90,024, has the smallest population of any African state.\n\nIt has the highest Human Development Index in Africa and the highest income inequality in the world, as measured by the Gini index. Seychelles is a member of the African Union.\n\nHistory\n\nSome scholars assume that Austronesian seafarers and later Maldivian and Arab traders were the first to visit the uninhabited Seychelles.\n\nRemains of Maldivian mariner presence from the 12th century were found in Silhouette Island.\n\nThe earliest recorded sighting by Europeans took place in 1502 by the Portuguese Admiral Vasco da Gama, who passed through the Amirantes and named them after himself (islands of the Admiral).\n\nThe earliest recorded landing was in January 1609, by the crew of the \"Ascension\" under Captain Sharpeigh during the fourth voyage of the English East India Company.\n\nA transit point for trade between Africa and Asia, the islands were occasionally used by pirates until the French began to take control starting in 1756 when a Stone of Possession was laid by Captain Nicholas Morphey.\n\nThe islands were named after Jean Moreau de Séchelles, Louis XV's Minister of Finance.\n\nThe British contested control over the islands between 1794 and 1810.\n\nJean Baptiste Quéau de Quincy, French administrator of Seychelles during the years of war with the United Kingdom, declined to resist when armed enemy warships arrived.\n\nInstead, he successfully negotiated the status of capitulation to Britain which gave the settlers a privileged position of neutrality.\n\nBritain eventually assumed full control upon the surrender of Mauritius in 1810, formalised in 1814 at the Treaty of Paris.\n\nSeychelles became a crown colony separate from Mauritius in 1903.\n\nElections were held in 1966 and 1970.\n\nIndependence was granted in 1976 as a republic within the Commonwealth.\n\nIn 1977, a coup d'état ousted the first president of the republic, James Mancham, who was replaced by France Albert René.\n\nThe 1979 constitution declared a socialist one-party state, which lasted until 1991.\n\nThe first draft of a new constitution failed to receive the requisite 60% of voters in 1992, but an amended version was approved in 1993.\n\nIn January 2013, the country declared a state of emergency; the tropical cyclone Felleng caused torrential rain, and flooding and landslides destroyed hundreds of houses.\n\nRepublic of Seychelles / République des Seychelles\n\nMotto: \"Finis Coronat Opus\" (Latin)\n\n\"The End Crowns the Work\"\n\nAnthem: Koste Seselwa / Join together all Seychellois\n\nCapital and largest city: Victoria (4°37′S 55°27′E)\n\nOfficial languages:\n\n• French\n\n• English\n\n• Seychellois Creole\n\nVernacular languages: Seychellois Creole\n\nEthnic groups (2000):\n\n• 93.2% Seychellois Creole\n\n• 3.0% British\n\n• 1.8% French\n\n• 0.5% Chinese\n\n• 0.3% Indian\n\n• 1.2% others\n\nDemonym: Seychellois, Seychelloise, Seselwa (Creole)\n\nGovernment:\n\nUnitary representative presidential republic\n\nPresident:\n\nVice-President:\n\nLegislature: National Assembly\n\nIndependence: from the United Kingdom:\n\n29 June 1976\n\nArea:\n\n• Total: 459 km2 (197th) - 177 sq mi\n\n• Water (%): negligible\n\nPopulation:\n\n2012 estimate 90,024 (195th) - 2009 census 84,000\n\nDensity: 186.2/km2 (60th) - 482.7/sq mi\n\nGDP (PPP): 2012 estimate\n\n• Total: $2.317 billion\n\n• Per capita: $25,229\n\nCurrency: Seychellois rupee (SCR)"
