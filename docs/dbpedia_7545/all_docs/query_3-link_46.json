        "text": "please include Swede, Finn, Dane, Pole, Serb, Slovak, Slovene, Bosniak (like Croat), Bajan, Gilbertese/Kiribatian, Myanmarese, Nepali, Argentine, Icelander, Aussie and Kiwi(tho informal, i hear them all the time)\n\neither include or not: Lao, Ghanan, Irani/Persian, Surinamer, Madagascan, Israelite(as Israeli already works, show both answers)\n\nchange Djibouti to Djiboutian\n\nabove are all legitimate.\n\ndonâ€™t include Brit(somewhat offensive), Turk(may be confusing)\n\nThat was fun. I think the time was right, I was typing casually and got 160 just skipping the less-formulaic stuff.\n\nI'd also like to see a different version, with stuff like, Dane, Finn, Irishman, etc.\n\nIt'd probably make sense to cut out all the easy ones with >80%, but this makes for a fun feature.\n\nThis quiz has not been thought through properly as to whether adjectives or nouns are required.\n\nFollowing your example at the top, a citizen of Rome is a Roman. A citizen of Finland is a Finn, not a Finnish. And a citizen of the UK is not 'a British'.\n\nFinn, Swede, Turk should all be accepted as demonyms. Just as a person from Rome is a Roman, a person from Finland is a Finn. Finnish is an adjective (or a noun when referring to language), while Finnis a noun referring to a person.\n\nI feel less strongly on this point since it is a dated term, but Byelorussian should maybe be accepted for Belarusian since that was the English demonym for many decades, within living memory.\n\nAt the very least, the quiz should be changed to allow either adjectival form or demonyms. I'm sure the comment section has plenty of examples, but I noticed Polish, Finnish, and pretty much all the -ish ones are strictly adjectival. Alternatively, Slovakian, Kiwi/NZer, other -er ones, I-Kiribati, etc are all strictly demonyms.\n\nThere were also some like where both forms are accepted and shown. I think for countries where they differ, that would be the best thing to do. So Spaniard/Spanish and so on.\n\nAnswers to add: Equatorial Guinean, Salvadorian/Salvadorean, Swazi, Habesha for Ethiopia, Finn, Swede, Pole, Brit(on), Turk, Gabonaise, Hellenic/Hellene for Greek, Catracho/a for Honduras, Magyar for Hungary, Kazakhstani, Kirg(h)iz and Kyrgyzstani, Lao(s), Lett(ish) for Latvia, Malinese, Slovak, Slovene, Monacan, Mongol, Netherlander, Banyarwanda, Serb, Surinamer, Formosan for Taiwan, Tajikistani, Uzbekistani, Emiri(an),\n\nMadagascan and Vaticanian (debatable)\n\nTwo actual minor mistakes i noticed were:\n\nGilbertese is actually the language not the demonym\n\nSlovak is the official demonym not Slovakian.\n\nYou can check on wikipedia as well.\n\nAlso would recommend stating in the description that is adjectival demonyms only (that way you wont get loads of people trying to change the quiz in the comments)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adjectival_and_demonymic_forms_for_countries_and_nations\n\nAmazing job creating this quiz! I thought I was going to be okay, or at least decent. Turns out, I'm not. I got a 46%.\n\nHowever, I found this quiz very fun! I liked learning about the countries and I feel like this must have taken a great deal of effort by the creator."
