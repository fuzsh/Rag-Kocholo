        "text": "The British tend to be a little more laid back, meaning formal dress is not an incredibly stressful part of business meetings. However, it is still important to maintain a professional appearance. And a little extra effort is always appreciated.\n\nFor men, a suit is generally the best bet. Colors can vary, but men are better off sticking to conservative colors like black, dark blue, or gray. While you might be able to get away with an open collar, it is safest to wear a necktie, preferably in a solid color. Avoid striped ties, which are seen as too informal.\n\nWomen should dress conservatively as well, but they should feel free to experiment a little more with colors. Business suits are always acceptable, but are never required.\n\nFor the most part, language will not be much of a barrier for these types of business meetings. Whereas non-English speaking countries often mean hiring a translator, you should be able to have a perfectly normal conversation with your host without one.\n\nHowever, be wary of slight differences in the language. Everyday words in American English do not always carry the same meaning in the U.K. For example, in the U.S., a coach is someone who manages a sports team. In the U.K., it is actually what they call a bus.\n\nIn most cases, you’ll be able to get past these double meanings, but not understanding the differences can lead to some awkward situations. Before you leave, familiarize yourself with common words that have different meanings. Or, at the very least, avoid using the word “pants.”\n\nThe British will generally stay a few feet away from other people. This is not meant to be offensive, but instead indicates a respect for personal space. Likewise, you should remain a few feet from your host and avoid unnecessary physical contact.\n\nThough not technically personal space, you should also avoid prolonged eye contact. While this is considered respectful in the United States, it makes people uncomfortable and can, at worst, be seen as intimidating.\n\nWhile conversing, avoid topics that are even remotely personal. The British value their privacy, and even innocent questions about their personal history or life can be seen as prying.\n\nBe very cautious when referring to people as British or English.\n\nWhile “British” is an overarching description for the four nations that make up the U.K., cultural trends have started to question the idea of Britishness to the point where individual national identity is coming to the forefront.\n\nAdditionally, do not assume that everyone in the U.K. is English. The term English only applies to people from England. Each country has their own demonym: Scottish for Scotland, Irish (or Northern Irish) for Northern Ireland, and Welsh for Wales.\n\nWhile it’s not unusual for foreigners to be unaccustomed to these differences, using the wrong description can be insulting. Getting it right can also go a long way towards earning respect.\n\nThe Scots are proud of their nation’s history. If you can learn something about Scottish culture before your meeting, do so and try to incorporate it. Always be complimentary of Scotland and avoid any conversation that might lead to negative events.\n\nYou should also never group the Scots with the English. The two nations have a contentious history and pairing them together is often seen as insulting.\n\nWhile doing business in England, you might be invited to a pub for lunch. This is a good sign, but keep in mind that this is largely a social encounter. Avoid talking about business unless the host brings it up.\n\nAt the pub, it is generally expected to eat a light meal and, usually, drink a pint. While the pint is optional, doing so is not considered unprofessional and lends to the camaraderie of the event. However, refrain from toasting, particularly if you’re toasting someone who is older or out ranks you.\n\nBritish business meetings tend to be punctual and direct. Arrive a few minutes early or call ahead if you’ll be late.\n\nThere may occasionally be brief small talk prior to the actual meeting, but the meeting itself will generally focus on only what needs to be discussed.\n\nTypically, greet your host with a firm handshake. Like in the United States, a firm, short handshake is better than a limp or extended one. You might also exchange business cards. This process is highly informal, so it is acceptable to glance at the card and then put it away immediately.\n\nAs a rule, do not refer to someone by their first name unless they ask you to do so. You’ll also want to be aware of any honorary titles someone might have, such as “Sir” or “Dame” for anyone who has been knighted."
