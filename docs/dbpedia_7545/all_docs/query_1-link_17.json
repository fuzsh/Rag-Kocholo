        "text": "A demonym (gentilicio) is a word that shows a person is an inhabitant of a country, city, place, town, region, etc.\n\nExamples:\n\nEspaña → español/-laSpain → Spanish\n\nColombia → colombiano/-naColombia → Colombian\n\nWe can also use these words to describe things and concepts as well as people. Grammatically speaking, it’s then an adjective not a demonym, but their form is identical, so the distinction isn’t too important.\n\nExamples:\n\nSoy de España.I’m from Spain. (country name)\n\nSusana es española.Susana is Spanish. (demonym)\n\nLa comida española es famosa en todo el mundo.Spanish food is famous all over the world. (adjective)\n\nHow to form demonyms in Spanish\n\nIn Spanish, demonyms are generally formed by adding suffixes (endings) to a country’s name or the root of its name.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no rules that tell us when to use which suffix, so we have to learn them by heart.\n\nThe table below shows the most common suffixes with examples.\n\nSome places that share the same name have different demonyms to avoid confusion.\n\nExample:\n\nguadalajareño → from Guadalajara, Spain\n\nguadalajarense → from Guadalajara, Mexico\n\nCertain demonyms are derived from names that are no longer in use, meaning they can be difficult to identify on sight alone."
