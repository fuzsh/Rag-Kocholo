        "text": "Education\n\nThere are two main languages in use throughout Seychelles schools, the Seychellois Creole and English. Neither language is promoted over the other, and they coexist within the sphere of education. This reveals that bilingualism is common for many students and teachers within the country of Seychelles. The development of private English schools in the country indicates that the language is gaining prestige among the population of Seychelles and will be practiced by many school aged Seychellois people.\n\nGovernment\n\nIn Seychelles, the government is made up of a head of state and the National Assembly which operates similarly to the Senate in America. Anyone over the age of 17 is eligible to vote and is responsible for electing 25 national Assembly members and the President every five years. There are two main political parties that attempt to garner majority within the country, the People's Party and the National Party. According to the Ibrahim Index, the government of Seychelles ranks second in excellence in regards to all African Governance. This means that the government is effective in promoting positive human development, human rights, and safety within the country. The government made English one of its three official languages in 1981 along with the Seselwa Creole and French. Metz (1995) writes, \"More than one-third of Seychellois can use English and the great majority of younger Seychellois can read English which is the language of government and commerce\" (p. 218). English is used in the government because it can reach a large majority of the educated public in Seychelles. The Seychelles government's webpage is composed only in English and the links it provides lead to other websites written in English as well. It is necessary to know English in order to apply for a marriage license or get a permit of any kind. This demonstrates that English is an accessible language, needed in Seychelles in order to navigate the domain of government.\n\nTourism and Business\n\nSeychelles also has a large manufacturing industry that helps connect it to other countries around the world. Many processing plants exist in the country and they produce goods such as beer, cigarettes, furniture, and chemicals. These goods are then exported to foreign countries including America and Britain, thus strengthening ties to other English speaking countries. A unique aspect of Seychelles's economy comes from the offshore banking of many foreign businesses. Many businesses move their accounts to banks in Seychelles to gain tax breaks and more relaxed regulations. There are ten banks throughout the country that cater to thousands of foreign business and work to ensure that they are completely tax exempt under the common law of Seychelles. There are many resources targeted to foreign businesses in America outlining how to apply for an account in Seychelles. This practice encourages the use of communication based language learning. The video provided shows one example of how banks in Seychelles make themselves accessible to American businesses.\n\nUS Embassy"
