The second-smallest country in Africa, Seychelles has an area of 455 sq km (176 sq mi), of which Mahé, the principal island, comprises 144 sq km (56 sq mi). Comparatively, the area occupied by Seychelles is slightly more than 2.5 times the size of Washington, DC. There are two main clusters: one is a granitic group, centering around Mahé; the other, to the sw, includes the coralline Aldabra Islands and the Farquhar group. Situated about 1,600 km (1,000 mi) off the east coast of Africa, Mahé extends 27 km (17 mi) n–s and 11 km (7 mi) e–w.\n\nThe capital city of Seychelles, Victoria, is located on the island of Mahé.\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nThe Seychelles Islands are the highest points of the Mascarene Ridge, an Indian Ocean ridge running in a generally north-south direction. The granitic islands rise above the sea surface to form a peak or ridge which, in the case of Mahé, attains an elevation of 912 m (2,992 ft) at Morne Seychellois, the highest point. Rugged crests, towering cliffs, boulders, and domes contribute to the islands' great natural beauty. Here and there, in the hollows in the rock relief, are pockets of lateritic soil, often very thin and easily eroded. Mahé possesses white, sandy beaches behind which are flats of coral and shell known locally as plateaus. Small streams descending the mountain slopes deposit alluvial material, creating the most fertile soils on the island.\n\nThe coralline Seychelles are, in contrast, low lying, rising only a few feet above the surface of the sea. Many have the typical Indian Ocean lagoon. Soils tend to be thin, with poor moisture retention. These islands are suited only to the coconut palm and a few other species.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nAlthough the Seychelles Islands lie close to the equator, their maritime situation results in coastal temperatures that are fairly constant at about 27°c (81°f) throughout the year. At higher altitudes, temperatures are lower, especially at night. Mean annual rainfall at sea level on Mahé is 236 cm (93 in); in the mountains there may be as much as 356 cm (140 in) a year. On the southwestern coral islands, rainfall is much lower, averaging about 50 cm (20 in) a year on Aldabra. May to October is the relatively dry sunny season; in this period, the southeast monsoon winds bring brief showers every two or three days. The northwest monsoon arrives in December and continues until March, bringing frequent and heavy rain. Humidity is high, especially in the coastal areas.\n\nFLORA AND FAUNA\n\nPrimary forest is found only on Praslin and Curieuse islands, northeast of Mahé. On Praslin, native forests of coco-de-mer have been protected in small reserves; its fruit, a huge coconut weighing up to 18 kg (40 lb), is the largest seed in the world and this is the only place were the palm is found growing wild. Virtually all the broadleaf evergreen rain forest has been cut down. In its place are the coconut plantations, with occasional patches of vanilla. Other existing trees are native to the islands and have adapted to the local conditions. Underplanting is quite usual and includes avocado, breadfruit, banana, cinnamon, mango, papaya, patchouli, and pineapple.\n\nSharks abound in the surrounding oceans, but on land there are no reptiles or mammals that present a threat to human life. The most noteworthy animal is the giant tortoise; once very plentiful, the species is now sorely depleted. There is a great variety of bird life including dozens of the world's rarest species, but very few insects.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nSeychelles does not have the resources to maintain a comprehensive program of environmental regulation. The monitoring of the environment is complicated by the fact that the nation consists of 15 islands distributed over a 1.3 million sq km area. Seychelles has no natural fresh water resources. In addition, the nation has a water pollution problem due to industrial by-products and sewage. Fires, landslides, and oil leakage also affect the environment in Seychelles.\n\nThe government Environmental Management Plan of Seychelles 1990–2000 proposed 12 areas of environmental regulation. The Aldabra atoll is a native preserve on the UNESCO World Heritage list, as is the Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve. The Port Launay Coastal Wetlands are listed as a Ramsar site. The Ministry of Planning and External Relations and the Ministry of National Development hold principal environmental responsibility.\n\nAccording to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the number of threatened species included 3 types of mammals, 13 species of birds, 3 types of reptiles, 6 species of amphibians, 10 species of fish, 2 types of mollusks, 2 species of other invertebrates, and 45 species of plants. The olive ridley, hawksbill, and green sea turtles and the Seychelles black parrot, Seychelles magpie robin, and Seychelles warbler are threatened species. The Aldabra brush warbler and the Seychelles parakeet (or parrot) have become extinct.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nThe population of Seychelles in 2005 was estimated by the United Nations (UN) at 81,000, which placed it at number 181 in population among the 193 nations of the world. In 2005, approximately 8% of the population was over 65 years of age, with another 26% of the population under 15 years of age. According to the UN, the annual population rate of change for 2005–2010 was expected to be 1.0%, a rate the government viewed as too high. A National Population Policy, finalized in 2002, contained programs aimed at limiting population growth. The projected population for the year 2025 was 88,000. The overall population density was 180per sq km (466 per sq mi), with 80% of the population living on the island of Mahé.\n\nThe UN estimated that 50% of the population lived in urban areas in 2005, and that urban areas were growing at an annual rate of 1.24%. The capital city, Victoria, had a population of 25,000 in that year.\n\nMIGRATION\n\nEntry for the purpose of employment is strictly controlled. Since the 1950s, some retirees from the United Kingdom have settled in Seychelles. In 2000 the total number of migrants was 5,000. In 2005, the net migration rate was an estimated -5.54 migrants per 1,000 population. The government views the emigration level as too high, but the immigration level as satisfactory.\n\nETHNIC GROUPS\n\nThere are no distinct ethnic divisions, apart from small Indian and Chinese groups constituting about 1% of the total population. The bulk of the population is Seychellois, a mixture of African, French-European, and Asian strains.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nCreole, a simplified form of French with borrowings from African languages, has been the first language since 1981 and is the initial language in public schools; it is spoken by about 91.8% of the population. English and French are also widely spoken as second languages. English is the first language of about 4.9% of the population. English, Creole, and French are all considered to be official languages; English is the official language of the National Assembly.\n\nRELIGIONS\n\nThe great majority of the population practices Christianity. According to the most recent estimates, Roman Catholics constituted about 87% of the Christian community; Anglicans totaled another 7%. Other Christian churches include Baptists, Seventh-Day Adventists, the Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal Church, Nazarites, and Jehovah's Witnesses. Hindus, Muslims, and Baha'is are also present.\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion and there is no state religion; however, the government does offer sometimes substantial financial assistance to churches from the state budget, primarily in the form of grants, through an application process that is open to all.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nUntil the opening of the international airport on Mahé in 1971, the Seychelles Islands were entirely dependent on the sea for their links with the rest of the world. Until 1970, passenger and cargo service by ship was irregular. In the early 1970s, however, new deepwater facilities were dredged at Victoria Harbor. Private ferries connect Mahé to Praslin and La Digue. As of 2005, there were five merchant ships of 1,000 GRT or more, totaling 42,223 GRT.\n\nThe road network totaled an estimated 280 km (174 mi) in 2002, of which 176 km (109 mi) were paved. One road encircles the island and another runs across the island by way of the central mountain ridge. There were 5,100 automobiles and 2,000 commercial vehicles in 1995.\n\nIn 2004 there were an estimated 15 airports, 8 of which had paved runways as of 2005. Seychelles International Airport is at Pointe Larue on Mahé. Flights to London, Zürich, Frankfurt, and Rome are in service via Air Seychelles, the national carrier. Air France's scheduled flights connect Seychelles with Europe. In 2001 (the latest year for which data is available) about 420,000 passengers were carried on scheduled domestic and international flights. Ligne Aérienne Seychelles (LAS), a private line, ran charter flights to Australia, Singapore, Botswana, and Malawi.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Seychelles Islands (then uninhabited) in 1502, and an English expedition visited the islands in 1609. The name Seychelles derives from the Vicomte des Séchelles, Louis XV's finance minister. The French first claimed the islands in 1756, but colonization did not begin until 1768, when a party of 22 Frenchmen arrived, bringing with them a number of slaves. As competition grew among European nations for the lucrative trade with India and Asia, more and more seamen called at the islands to provision their vessels and to pick up commodities useful for trade.\n\nThe French and British battled for control of the islands between 1793 and 1813. French bases were blockaded in 1794 and again in 1804; on each occasion, the French capitulated. Under the Treaty of Paris (1814), the islands, together with Mauritius, were ceded to Britain. Both before and after the cession, the islands were administered from Mauritius as dependent territories. When the British made clear that they would enforce the ban on slavery throughout the Empire, many of the French landowners who had continued to import African slaves, largely from Mauritius and Réunion, departed for Africa and elsewhere, taking their slaves with them. However, with slavery ended, thousands of liberated slaves and others came into the islands. Indian labor was introduced to work on the plantations and some Chinese immigrants became shopkeepers.\n\nIn 1872, a Board of Civil Governors was created, increasing the degree of political autonomy; a Legislative Council and an Executive Council were established in 1888. On 31 August 1903, the islands became a crown colony, no longer subordinate to Mauritius. By this date, the cosmopolitan character of Seychelles had been established. Intermarriage between the descendants of the French, African, and Asian populations produced the Seychellois of today.\n\nIn 1948, the first elections were held, filling four seats on the Legislative Council. A new constitution was written in 1966 and promulgated in 1967. It vested authority in a governor and a Governing Council. General elections, the first based on the principle of universal adult suffrage, were held in December 1967 for the new Legislative Assembly. Further amendments to the constitution in March 1970 gave the Seychellois greater autonomy over affairs of internal government.\n\nSeychelles achieved independence at 12:05 am on 29 June 1976. Upon independence, the UK government recommended the transfer from the British Indian Ocean Territory to Seychelles of the island groups of Aldabra and Farquhar and the island of Desroches. These islands, which had been detached from Seychelles in 1965, were duly returned to the new republic.\n\nJames Richard Marie Mancham, then leader of the conservative Seychelles Democratic Party, became president on independence, heading a coalition government that included Seychelles People's United Party (SPUP) leader France Albert René as prime minister. Mancham was overthrown by a coup on 5 June 1977 and went into exile; René became president. He suspended the constitution, dismissed the legislature, and ruled by decree.\n\nIn 1978, a new political party, the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF), absorbed the SPUP. The constitution of March 1979, adopted by referendum, established a one-party state as the country drifted toward a Marxist political system. In November 1981, about 50 mercenaries recruited in South Africa landed in Mahé, briefly seized the airport, and apparently planned to return Mancham to power; however, Seychellois troops forced them to flee. Tanzanian troops, airlifted to Seychelles following this incident, also played a part in restoring order after an abortive army mutiny of 17–18 August 1982 took at least nine lives. All Tanzanian troops had left the country by the end of 1984. A number of other plots have been alleged since then.\n\nRené was reelected president without opposition in June 1984. Since then, the Seychelles made progress economically and socially. Under rising pressure to democratize, in December 1991, René agreed to reform the electoral system. Multiparty elections were held in July 1992 (the first since 1974), and the prospect of reconciliation between René and Mancham supporters was raised. Many dissidents, including Mancham, returned from exile. In June 1993, 73% of the voters approved a new constitution providing for multiparty government.\n\nSince the introduction of multiparty competition, the SPPF has remained dominant, but has gradually seen its popularity weaken. Presidential and National Assembly elections were held 23 July 1993, with René winning the presidency and the SPPF capturing all but one of the directly elected legislative seats. In the 1998 contest, René obtained 66.7% of the presidential vote and his party captured 30 of 34 seats. In August 2001 elections, René again defeated his opponents, but this time by only 54.19%, and in National Assembly elections in December 2002—the first to be held separately from presidential elections—the SPPF captured 23 seats to 11 for the SNP.\n\nIn April 2004, after 27 years in power, René—barred constitutionally from running for a third term—handed over power to his vice president James Michel. The move gave Michel time to establish himself, and as SPPF party chair, René continued to exercise power behind the scenes. One sign of this power was the expansion of the central committee from 20 to 25 members composed of former ministers and key civil servants. In the annual SPPF congress in May 2005, Vice President Joseph Belmont was named to be Michel's running mate.\n\nWhether the SPPF would continue its political dominance was believed to hinge primarily on the economy. Real GDP was expected to contract for the fourth consecutive year in 2006.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nThe 1976 constitution provided for a multiparty system, but was replaced in 1979 with a document authorizing a one-party state. The June 1993 constitution reestablished multiparty elections for president and for a National Assembly consisting of 33 members, 22 directly elected and 11 allocated on a proportional basis. The president is both head of state and head of government and appoints a cabinet of ministers from outside the National Assembly. Typically, the president also holds key ministerial posts. While the 1993 constitution guarantees extensive political and civil liberties, it also allows the curtailment of freedom of expression in order to protect \"the reputation, rights, and freedoms of private lives of persons.\" This is a thinly veiled limitation on the freedom of the press. The independent media was the target of restrictions under the René administration.\n\nIn 1996, the SPPF successfully introduced constitutional changes, including the enlargement of the National Assembly to 35 (with 10 members to be chosen by proportional representation) and creation of the post for a vice president. In 1998, the United Opposition (UO) boycotted the National Assembly meetings protesting the SPPF's heavy-handed behavior. Presently, the National Assembly comprises 34 seats, 25 elected by popular vote and 9 allocated on a proportional basis to parties winning at least 10% of the vote.\n\nThe next presidential elections were due to take place by August 2006 with parliamentary elections scheduled to occur no later than the end of 2007. Parliamentary elections may be concurrent with presidential elections. The president and members of the National Assembly serve five-year terms.\n\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\n\nBefore 1978 there were two political parties, the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) and the Seychelles People's United Party (SPUP), both founded in 1964. In the last legislative elections prior to independence, on 25 April 1974, the SDP won 13 of 15 elective seats and the SPUP 2. Appointments in June 1975 brought total party strength to 18 for the SDP and 7 for the SPUP. The successor to the SPUP, the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF), was established in 1979 as the sole legal party, with the avowed objective of creating a Socialist state; the SDP was declared to have \"disappeared.\" There were at least three opposition groups in exile. In the 1979 parliamentary elections, 55 candidates sanctioned by the SPPF competed for 23 elective seats in the People's Assembly. In the 1983 parliamentary elections, 17 of the 23 elected candidates ran unopposed; and in the December 1987 elections, 36 candidates, all of them members of the SPPF, competed for the 23 seats in the People's Assembly.\n\nAfter René's announcement of a return to multiparty democracy, parties began to organize in preparation for an election to a constituent assembly in July 1992. Many dissidents returned from exile and the Democratic Party (DP) was reestablished. Also established were the Seychelles Party (PS), the Seychelles Democratic Movement (MSPD), and the Seychelles Liberal Party (SLP).\n\nAfter the 23 July 1993 elections, eight opposition members obtained seats in the 33-seat National Assembly. René won the presidential election with 59.5% of the vote. The Parti Seselwa, the Seychellois National Movement, and the National Alliance Party opposed the adoption of the new constitution in 1993 and contested the July 1993 elections as the United Opposition (UO) coalition. Its presidential candidate, former president Mancham, received 36.6% of the vote. The SPPF won 21 legislative seats to the DP's 1. The SPPF was also given 6 of the 11 seats apportioned according to the percentage of the votes won; the DP, 4 seats; and the UO, 1 seat.\n\nIn the 1998 elections, the SPPF captured 30 seats; the UO three; and the DP only one seat. The Reverend Wavel Ramkalawan replaced James Mancham as leader of the opposition, and in late 1998, the UO changed its name to the Seychelles National Party (SNP). In National Assembly elections held in December 2002, the SPPF captured 23 seats to 11 for the SNP. The SPPF retained a strong grassroots structure throughout the islands.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nAll seats on the 23 elected district councils (formerly the SPPF district branch committees) are held by SPPF members. In June 2003, SPPF delegates to a special party congress agreed that members of district committees would be appointed rather than elected.\n\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\nMagistrates' courts are normally the courts of the first instance. The Supreme Court hears appeals and takes original jurisdiction of some cases. An independent Appeal Court was established in 2005. The president of Seychelles appoints the chief justice—a naturalized citizen—and also appoints all other judges from other Commonwealth countries on seven-year contracts. As of 2005, the court president was Justice Michael Ramodibedi of Lesotho.\n\nCivil law is based on the French Napoleonic Code, while criminal law follows the British model. Members of the armed forces accused of serious offenses are tried by court-martial unless the president decrees otherwise. Executive and ruling party dominance in the judicial system has been challenged unsuccessfully.\n\nThe Constitutional Court convenes weekly, or as needed, to consider constitutional and civil liberties issues. The Court of Appeal convenes twice a year and considers appeals from the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court only. In addition, an industrial court and a rent tribunal exist.\n\nARMED FORCES\n\nIn 2005 there were 450 active personnel in the armed forces of Seychelles, including an army of 200 (one infantry company and one security unit) and a paramilitary national guard of 250. There was also a 200-member coast guard, that included 80 marines, and 20 others in an air wing. In 2005, the defense budget totaled $12.6 million.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\nAdmitted to the United Nations on 21 September 1976, Seychelles participates in ECA and several nonregional specialized agencies, such as the IAEA, FAO, the World Bank, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, and the WHO. The nation belongs to the ACP Group, the African Development Bank, COMESA, SADC, the Cross-border Initiative in Eastern and Southern Africa (CBI), the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and the Indian Ocean Commission. It also belongs to the Commonwealth of Nations, G-77, and the African Union. The country has observer status in the WTO. It is part of the Nonaligned Movement. IN environmental cooperation, Seychelles is part of the Basel Convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, CITES, the London Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, the Montréal Protocol, MARPOL, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the UN Conventions on the Law of the Sea, Climate Change, and Desertification.\n\nECONOMY\n\nSeychelles possesses a thriving economy, but external debt holds back real economic development. Agriculture, fishing, and forestry accounted for about 4% of GDP in 1999. Crop production is limited by mountainous terrain and low soil fertility, leaving the Seychelles dependent on imports for beef, rice, potatoes, and some fresh produce. The manufacturing sector accounts for 26% of GDP. Since the opening of the international airport in 1971, the Seychelles economy has become dependent on tourism. In 1999, tourism employed 30% of the labor force, and provided the majority of foreign exchange earnings, but in 2000, industrial fishing surpassed tourism as the most important source of foreign exchange. Stiff international competition for tourist dollars caused the government to take steps to broaden the economic base by promoting the development of fishing and light manufacturing. The tourism industry was adversely affected by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and the subsequent decline in air travel. Tuna fishing and canning accounted for 70% of GDP in 2003.\n\nAlthough private enterprise and private property are permitted, the public sector drives the economy and accounts for more than 40% of GDP. The government controls the importation, licensing, and distribution of virtually all goods and services, and exercises significant control over all phases of the economy. Since 1990, a program to privatize the economy has resulted in progress in several sectors including tourism, fish processing, and agriculture. In 1995, the American food company Heinz and Co. purchased 60% of the previously state-owned Seychelles Tuna Canning Factory, and the joint venture between the government and Heinz is now the single largest employer in the Seychelles. In addition, most state-owned agricultural land has been turned over to private control. The government is attempting to develop an offshore and free trade zone to further develop the economy and move it away from its dependence upon tourism and fishing.\n\nThe economy registered a slight expansion of 1.3% in 2002, before it started plummeting—by -6.3% in 2003 and by -2.0% in 2004; in 2005 real GDP growth was -4.0%. Inflation remained fairly stable but was expected to jump to 10% in 2005 as a result of the economic recession. The tourism sector continues to suffer as vacationers look for cheaper destination like the Comoros, Mauritius, and Madagascar. In addition, Heinz decided that it will sell its 60% stake in the Indian Ocean Tuna cannery as soon as a buyer is found.\n\nINCOME\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reports that in 2005 Seychelles's gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at $626.0 million. The CIA defines GDP as the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year and computed on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than value as measured on the basis of the rate of exchange based on current dollars. The per capita GDP was estimated at $7,800. The annual growth rate of GDP was estimated at -3%. The average inflation rate in 2005 was 4.4%. It was estimated that agriculture accounted for 3.2% of GDP, industry 30.4%, and services 66.4%.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2002 remittances from citizens working abroad totaled $1 million or about $12 per capita and accounted for approximately 0.1% of GDP.\n\nLABOR\n\nIn 1996, the labor force numbered 30,900. Services accounted for 71% of the workforce, with industry 19% and agriculture the remaining 10%. In addition, there are self-employed people, casual workers, domestic servants, and agricultural workers on small land holdings. There was no data available as of the unemployment rate in Seychelles.\n\nSeychelles had two trade unions organizations as of 2001: the Seychelles Federation of Workers' Union and the Independent Seychelles Workers Union. Employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively, but in practice most wages are set by the government—the country's largest employer. The government has the right to review and approve labor contracts between individuals and large firms. Approximately 15–20% of the workforce is unionized.\n\nThe minimum age for employment is 15, but children are encouraged to attend school until the 9th or 10th grade. Apprenticeships and vocational programs are available to those who leave school early. The minimum wage was $427 per month in 2001. Most workers also receive a variety of free public services. The legal maximum workweek is 45 to 52 hours, but most government workers work less than that. The government has issued comprehensive occupational health and safety regulations but they are not effectively enforced. The government is making attempts to improve this enforcement.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nAlthough agriculture has long been the basis of the Seychelles economy, it contributes only about 4% to GDP. Production in 2004 included coconuts, 3,200 tons; and bananas, 1,970 tons. Tea planting began in the early 1960s. Other crops produced for export are cinnamon bark, vanilla, cloves, and patchouli (an essence used in soap and perfume). In 2004, the Seychelles produced 200 tons of cinnamon bark and 225 tons of tea. Sweet potatoes, yams, breadfruit, and cassava are grown in small quantities but are not sufficient to satisfy the local demand. Oranges, lemons, grapefruit, bananas, and mangoes meet the local requirement only in season.\n\nANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nSeychelles is self-sufficient in the production of pork, poultry, and eggs. In 2005 there were about 18,500 hogs, 5,150 goats, and 1,400 head of cattle. Cattle of improved strains are imported and maintained on an intensive feedlot system.\n\nFISHING\n\nPer capita fish consumption in the Seychelles is very high, yet the development of industrial fishing is at its early stages. The development of port services for foreign tuna fishing fleets since the early 1980s has raised incomes and living standards, while diminishing the role of artisanal fishing. Fishing accounts for about 1% of GDP and about 8% of exports. Foreign vessels fishing in Seychelles waters must be licensed to operate within the 322-km (200-mi) economic zone, which encompassed one of the world's richest tuna-fishing grounds. French investments have focused on tuna fishing and canning. The European Community, Korea, and Japan hold the key licenses to Seychelles coastal fishing. Fish landings by the domestic fleet totaled 86,869 tons, including 36,802 tons of skipjack tuna and 34,734 tons of yellowfin tuna. Exports of fish products totaled $210.8 million in 2003.\n\nFORESTRY\n\nLittle natural forest remains. Coconut plantations are the main source of timber, aside from imports. A reforestation program projects the planting of 100 ha (250 ac) each year. Imports of forest products totaled $1.4 million in 2004.\n\nMINING\n\nSeychelles' mineral production in 2004 consisted granite dimension stone, gravel and crushed rock, and sand. Although production of guano (a phosphate fertilizer comprising bird droppings, extracted from Assumption) ceased in the mid-1980s, a plant with a capacity of 5,000 tons per year remained; modest production was unofficially reported in the mid-1990s. Output of granite dimension stone in 2004 was estimated at 93,000 metric tons, up from 92,120 metric tons in 2002. Gravel and crushed rock output in 2004 was estimated at 213,000 metric tons, up from 212,926 metric tons in the previous year. Sand production in 2004 was estimated at 2,200 metric tons, up from 2,165 metric tons in 2002. Polymetallic nodules were known to occur on the ocean bottom near the Admirante Islands. The Seychelles comprised 40 granitic and at least 50 coralline islands.\n\nENERGY AND POWER\n\nSeychelles has a total installed electric generating capacity of 28,000 kW, as of 1 January 2003. Output in 2003 reached 0.24 billion kWh, of which 100% came from fossil fuels. Consumption of electricity in 2003 came to 0.22 billion kWh.\n\nAs of 1 January 2005, Seychelles had no proven reserves of crude oil, natural gas, or coal, nor any crude oil refining capacity. All fossil fuel and refined petroleum product consumption was met by imports. In 2004, imports and domestic demand for petroleum products each averaged 4,000 barrels per day. There were no recorded imports or consumption of natural gas or coal in 2003.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nIn 2000, the manufacturing and construction sector contributed 29% to GDP. The average annual industrial growth rate was averaging 10% in the early 2000s. Tuna fishing and canning accounted for 70% of GDP in 2002. The largest plant is the tuna cannery, opened in 1987 and privatized in 1995 with a 60% purchase by US-based Heinz Inc. The tuna business has grown rapidly, and the joint venture between Heinz and the government was the single largest employer in the Seychelles in 2002. Other factories are smaller and process local agricultural products. A tea factory handles locally grown tea. Others process copra and vanilla pods and extract coconut oil. There is a plastics factory, a brewery and soft drink bottler, and a cinnamon distiller. Salt, cigarettes, boats, furniture, steel products, publications, animal feeds, processed meats, dairy products, paints, and assembled televisions are also produced. Oil exploration is underway, and geophysical and geochemical analyses indicate potential for commercial production.\n\nIn 2004, the main contributors to the GDP were transport, communications, and distribution (30.3%), manufacturing (16.7%), government services (12.7%), and hotel and restaurants (10.1%). As of 2006, the Heinz company was liquidating its shares in the tuna canning factory, which had been privatized in 1995.\n\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nSeychelles Polytechnic, founded in 1983 at Victoria, has schools of agriculture, engineering, health studies, humanities and science, and maritime studies. In 2002, there were 18 researchers and 30 technicians engaged in research and development per million people. For that same year, R&D spending totaled r4.080 million. Of that amount, 89.7% came from government sources, with private nonprofit organizations accounting for 3.4% and foreign sources 6.9%.\n\nDOMESTIC TRADE\n\nThe Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB), with wide powers over imports, distribution, and quality of goods, was established in 1984. Though its monopoly on the sale of fruits and vegetables was abandoned in 1987, the SMB still operates all major supermarkets.\n\nCountryExportsImportsBalanceWorld38.0245.7-207.7Saudi Arabia14.439.8-25.4France-Monaco12.826.2-13.4Madagascar2.6…2.6United Kingdom1.719.5-17.8South Africa1.122.2-21.1Japan0.91.8-0.9Netherlands0.83.3-2.5Austria0.7…0.7Australia0.44.0-3.6Denmark0.42.4-2.0(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nThe small Chinese merchant class plays an important part in the retail trade. The variety of domestic goods for sale is very limited. There are price controls on most foodstuffs. The capital of Victoria is the major commercial center of the island. Shops range from supermarkets to a traditional open-air market. A small handicrafts and pottery industry creates products primarily for tourists.\n\nNormal business hours are 8 am to noon and 1:30 to 4 pm, Monday–Friday; 8 am to noon on Saturday. Most business is conducted in English, but French is widely spoken.\n\nFOREIGN TRADE\n\nForeign trade is habitually in deficit. Strict trade regulations hinder trade growth. Preserved fish (73%), fresh fish (8.0%), salted, dried, and smoked fish (6.5%), and shellfish (3.7%) account for the majority of Seychelles's commodity exports. Other exports include cinnamon and vanilla (2.4%).\n\nIn 2005, exports totaled $312 million (FOB—free on board), while imports grew to $460 million. Most of the exports went to the United Kingdom (27.7%), France (15.8%), Spain (12.6%), Japan (8.6%), Italy (7.5%), and Germany (5.6%). Major imports included food and live animals, manufactured goods, fuel, machinery and transport goods, and chemicals, and they mainly came from Saudi Arabia (15.5%), Spain (13.3%), France (10.3%), Singapore (7%), South Africa (6.8%), Italy (6.7%), and the United Kingdom (4.7%).\n\nBALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\nDevelopment aid, income from tourism, and earnings from reexports have generally been sufficient to offset Seychelles' persistent visible trade deficit.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reported that in 2001 the purchasing power parity of Seychelles's exports was $182.6\n\nCurrent Account-130.6 Balance on goods-139.6 Imports-376.3 Exports236.7 Balance on services105.2 Balance on income-92.5 Current transfers-3.8Capital Account5.0Financial Account-64.0 Direct investment abroad-89.0 Direct investment in Seychelles61.4 Portfolio investment assets0.1 Portfolio investment liabilities1.1 Financial derivatives… Other investment assets-9.8 Other investment liabilities-9.8Net Errors and Omissions0.5Reserves and Related Items189.1(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nmillion while imports totaled $360.2 million resulting in a trade deficit of $177.6 million.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that in 2001 Seychelles had exports of goods totaling $215 million and imports totaling $387 million. The services credit totaled $283 million and debit $193 million.\n\nExports of goods and services totaled $629 million in 2004, up from $620 million in 2003. Imports grew from $593 million in 2003, to $629 million in 2004. The resource balance, while positive in 2003 at $28 million, decreased to $0 million in 2004, indicating that imports were growing faster than exports. A similar trend was registered for the current account balance, which deteriorated from -$6 million in 2003, to -$21 million in 2004. Foreign exchange reserves (including gold) decreased to $37 million in 2004, covering less than a month of imports.\n\nBANKING AND SECURITIES\n\nThe Seychelles Monetary Authority, established in 1978 as the bank of issue, became the Central Bank of Seychelles in 1983. Other government banks are the Seychelles Savings Bank and the Development Bank of Seychelles. Five major commercial banks operate in the Seychelles, namely Barclays, Nouvobanq, Banque Française Commerciale Océan Indien, Bank of Baroda, and Habib Bank. Development of an offshore banking center was announced in 1999.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund reports that in 2001, currency and demand deposits—an aggregate commonly known as M1—were equal to $220.5 million. In that same year, M2—an aggregate equal to M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market mutual funds—was $607.0 million. The discount rate, the interest rate at which the central bank lends to financial institutions in the short term, was 1%.\n\nThere is no stock exchange in Seychelles.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nAll private insurance companies were nationalized in 1983 and their business transferred to the State Assurance Corp. Two of the companies doing business in the Seychelles in 1997 were H. Savy Insurance Co., and State Assurance Corp. of Seychelles.\n\nPUBLIC FINANCE\n\nAnnual budgets of increasing deficits were common in the 1980s. The public sector is responsible for two-thirds of Seychelles' employment, and the budget amounts to about 40% of GDP. Public investment focuses on social and physical infrastructure, tourism, and export activities. Some privatization has occurred in recent years, including the privatization of some port operations and the Seychelles Tuna Canning Factory, 60% of which was purchased by Heinz.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) estimated that in 2005 Seychelles's central government took in revenues of approximately $343.3 million and had expenditures of $332.2 million. Revenues minus expenditures totaled approximately $11.1 million. Public debt in 2005 amounted to 129.7% of GDP. Total external debt was $276.8 million.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that in 2002, the most recent year for which it had data, central government revenues were r1,607 million and expenditures were r2,172.8\n\nRevenue and Grants1,607100.0% Tax revenue999.162.2% Social contributions253.715.8% Grants25.11.6% Other revenue329.120.5%Expenditures2,172.8… General public services770.835.5% Defense78.83.6% Public order and safety813.7% Economic affairs165.57.6% Environmental protection…… Housing and community amenities54.52.5% Health136.66.3% Recreational, culture, and religion23.81.1% Education211.89.7% Social protection30213.9%(…) data not available or not significant.\n\nmillion. The value of revenues in US dollars was us$293 million and expenditures us$333 million, based on a official exchange rate for 2002 of us$1 = r5.4800 as reported by the IMF. Government outlays by function were as follows: general public services, 35.5%; defense, 3.6%; public order and safety, 3.7%; economic affairs, 7.6%; housing and community amenities, 2.5%; health, 6.3%; recreation, culture, and religion, 1.1%; education, 9.7%; and social protection, 13.9%.\n\nTAXATION\n\nAs of 2005, Seychelles had a progressive corporate income tax structure made up of four bands, with rates of 0%, 25%, 30%, and 40%. There is no capital gains tax in the Seychelles. A withholding tax of 15% is applied to dividends paid to nonresidents. Residents receiving dividends are not taxed. Interest income paid to nonresidents (excluding banks, financial companies, and other firms whose primary business is money lending) are subject to a 10% withholding rate. A 40% withholding rate is applied to interest received by residents or nonresidents holding a security issued by a Seychelles financial institution, and is applied at the time of redemption. Royalties paid to Seychelles citizens are not taxed, while nonresidents are subject to a 15% withholding rate. The principal indirect taxes are customs duties and a goods and services tax (GST). The GST applies a 12% tax on certain locally manufactured goods and on imported goods (in addition to the customs duty). Local services providers and tourism-related services providers are subject to a GST between 7% and 15%. The Seychelles operates as a tax haven. It applies a territorial basis of tax assessment to corporations, so they are taxed only on the income that is derived directly from the country. The makes it an inviting place for international companies to headquarter, because the profits made by branches are not imputed to the center for tax purposes. Also the government imposes no personal income tax, although it does require social security contributions.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES\n\nAll imports are controlled by the Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB), which places quotas on certain imports (such as motor vehicles) and other types of restrictions on other items. Prohibited goods include arms and ammunition, dangerous drugs, pornographic materials, and spearguns. Import tariffs are 30%.\n\nThe Seychelles International Trade Zone offers tax benefits and other advantages to exporters.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT\n\nThe government offers full repatriation of after-tax profits; normal exemption from import duties for machinery, spare parts, and raw materials; and possible tariff protection. While parastatals are common in Seychelles, there is no policy of nationalization, though joint ventures are preferred when foreign capital is involved. Public and private investment is sought for the tourist, fishing, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors. In 1995, the government established an International Investment Authority which offers incentives and tax concessions to foreign investors.\n\nAnnual foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to the Seychelles from 1997 to 2000 ranged from $54.4 million in 1997 to $60 million in 1999. In 2001, FDI inflows slowed to $34 million. In 2005, attempts were underway to find a buyer for Heinz's share in the Indian Ocean Tuna cannery, which delayed planned investments in the factory.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe 1985–89 plan sought to create jobs and emphasized developing cash crops, tourism, and the fishing industry. The 1990–94 plan emphasized the need to attract foreign investment. Of considerable interest to donors in the 1990s was the 10-year plan to improve the Seychelles environment. In 1999, the government undertook an intensive review of trade policies in connection with its application to join the WTO, which may increase development. As of 2003, the Seychelles' WTO application was still pending.\n\nThe economy continued to contract in 2005, and was expected to continue the same trend in 2006. Tourism still suffers from decreasing numbers of incoming visitors, and manufacturing will remain depressed as a result of insufficient foreign exchange. Prospects for 2007 are somewhat brighter as major investments in luxury hotels are expected to put the economy back on track.\n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAll citizens residing in Seychelles territory and resident foreign employees are entitled to participate in the social security fund. There is voluntary coverage available to the self-employed. Benefits are provided for old age, disability, survivorship, sickness, and maternity. Employees and employers are required to make monthly contributions. Retirement is set at age 63 with at least five years of residency. There is also a workers' compensation scheme. Health services are free for all residents under the National Health Plan. Although there is no statutory unemployment program, daily subsistence wages are provided under certain conditions.\n\nTraditional Seychelles culture is matriarchal and women are accorded considerable respect within society. However, violence against women, particularly domestic violence, remains a problem, and has been linked to alcohol abuse. Women are fairly well represented in both the public and private sectors. Inheritance laws do not discriminate against women. In 2004, more than 70% of births were out of wedlock.\n\nHuman rights are generally respected although there are still arbitrary arrests and detentions. There is some discrimination against foreign workers. Nongovernmental organizations operate freely.\n\nHEALTH\n\nIn 2004, the Seychelles had an estimated 132 physicians, 5 pharmacists, 467 nurses, 4 midwives, and 12 dentists per 100,000 people. Approximately, 3.9% of the gross national product went to health expenditures. Water and sanitation were available to over 90% of the Seychelles residents.\n\nThe infant mortality rate in 2005 was estimated at 15.53 per 1,000 live births and average life expectancy at 71.82 years. In the same year, the birth rate was 17.3 and the overall mortality rate at 6.6. Approximately 99% of the country's children were vaccinated against measles, 99% against hepatitis B, and 97% against polio. Seychelles has also reached the 2000 goal of attaining at least 90% immunization DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus). No cases of polio, measles, or neonatal tetanus were reported, however leprosy was still present.\n\nHOUSING\n\nAs of the 2002 census, there were about 20,270 housing units throughout the nation serving 20,933 households. The average household size was four members. Most homes were made of stone block with corrugated iron roofs (77%); others are constructed of wood frames and walls. Some rural houses were thatched. About 73% of all housing was listed in good condition; 66% of all housing was owner occupied. Of all housing units, 94% had flush toilets, 87% had indoor treated water, and 96% had electricity.\n\nThe Home Ownership Scheme lends money for building costs to low-income families, and the Housing Loan Fund provides loans for families who want to purchase or build their own homes. Concrete-block housing developments have been constructed.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nSince 1980, public education has been free and compulsory for 10 years for children between the ages of 6 and 16. Six years of primary education are followed by five years of secondary education. Vocational courses are offered for secondary students. In 2001, about 90% of children between the ages of four and five were enrolled in some type of preschool program. Primary and secondary school enrollment in 2003 was estimated at about 100% of age-eligible students. It is estimated that nearly all students complete their primary education. The student-to-teacher ratio for primary school was at about 14:1 in 2003; the ratio for secondary school was also about 14:1.\n\nSeychelles does not provide education at university level, but there is a teacher-training college and a polytechnic institute. Only members of the National Youth Service can apply to the teacher-training college. In the absence of higher education facilities, many students study abroad, mainly in the United Kingdom. The adult literacy rate for 2004 was estimated at about 91.9%.\n\nAs of 2003, public expenditure on education was estimated at 5.2% of GDP, or 10.7% of total government expenditures.\n\nLIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS\n\nThe National Archives and a National Library (80,000 volumes) are both located in Victoria (Mahé Island). Seychelles Polytechnic University has 12,000 volumes. The Seychelles National Museum of History is located in the same building as the National Library. There is also a Seychelles Natural History Museum in Victoria.\n\nMEDIA\n\nIn 2002, there were 21,700 mainline phones in use nationwide. In 2003, there were an additional 54,500 mobile phones in use.\n\nRadio-Television Seychelles, which is government owned, broadcasts in English, French, and Creole. Television service, controlled by the government, began in 1983. License fees for privately owned radio and television stations are so high that an independent media has not been able to develop. As of 1999 there were three AM radio stations and two television stations. There were 627 radios and 150 television sets per 1,000 population in 1998. In 2002, there were about 11,700 Internet subscribers served by over 260 Internet hosts. There is one daily newspaper—Seychelles Nation (2002 circulation 3,500)—published by the government in English, French, and Creole. The president has the authority to censor publications.\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nTrade groups include the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Seychelles Farmers' Association. The Women's Association and the Youth Organization are arms of the SPPF. Other youth organizations include the National Youth League of the Seychelles and the Scout and Guide Movement of the Seychelles. There are several sports associations representing such pastimes as tennis, squash, yachting, and track and field. There are national chapters of the Red Cross and Caritas.\n\nTOURISM, TRAVEL, AND RECREATION\n\nThe prosperity of Seychelles depends on tourism. Visitors can enjoy coral beaches, water sports including scuba diving, waterskiing, and windsurfing, and boat or yacht tours of the islands. The archipelago's wildlife is also a popular tourist attraction. Valid passports are required, but visas are not. If traveling from an infected area a certificate of vaccination is required.\n\nThere were 122,038 tourist arrivals in 2003. Most of the visitors came from France and Germany. Hotel rooms numbered 2,435 with 4,926 beds and an occupancy rate of 46%. That same year the US Department of State estimated the daily cost of staying in Seychelles at $271.\n\nFAMOUS SEYCHELLOIS\n\nSir James Richard Marie Mancham (b.1939), leader of the SDP, became Seychelles' first president in 1976. He was deposed in 1977 by France Albert René (b.1935), who served until 2004. James Alex Michel (b.1944) became president in 2004.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nSeychelles has no territories or colonies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBennett, George. Seychelles Pramila Ramgulam Bennett.

The nation is an archipelago of 115 tropical islands with two distinct collections of islands, some comprised of granite and others of coral. The Mahe Group consists of 42 granite islands, all within a 56-kilometer (35-mi.) radius of the main island of Mahe. These islands are rocky, and most have a narrow coastal stripe and a central range of hills rising as high as 914 meters (3,000 ft.). Mahe is the largest island—9,142 sq. km (55 sq. mi.)—and is the site of Victoria, the capital. The coral islands are flat with elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation. They have no fresh water; human life can be sustained on them only with difficulty. The climate is equable and healthy, although quite humid, as the islands are small and subject to marine influences.\n\nThe temperature varies little throughout the year. Temperatures on Mahe vary from 24°C to 29.9°C (75°F-85°F), and rainfall ranges from 288 centimeters (90 in.) annually at Victoria to 355 centimeters (140 in.) on the mountain slopes. Precipitation is somewhat less on the other islands. During the coolest months, July and August, the temperature drops to as low as 700F.\n\nThe southeast trade winds blow regularly from May to November, and this is the most pleasant time of the year. The hot months are from December to April, with higher humidity (80). March and April are the hottest months, but the temperature seldom exceeds 880F. Most of the islands lie outside the cyclone belt, so high winds are rare.\n\nPEOPLE\n\nAbout 90% of the Seychellois people live on Mahe Island. Most others live on Praslin and La Digue, with the remaining smaller islands either sparsely populated or uninhabited.\n\nMost Seychellois are descendants of early French settlers and the African slaves brought to the Seychelles in the 19th century by the British, who freed them from slave ships on the East African coast. Indians and Chinese (1.1% of the population) account for the other permanent inhabitants. In 2002, about 4,000 expatriates lived and worked in Seychelles. Of those, about 35 are American.\n\nSeychelles culture is a mixture of French and African (Creole) influences. Creole is the native language of 94% of the people; however, English and French are commonly used. English remains the language of government and commerce.\n\nAbout 92% of the population over age 15 is literate, and the literacy rate of school-aged children has risen to well over 98%. Increases are expected, as nearly all children of primary school age attend school, and the government encourages adult education.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Seychelles islands remained uninhabited for more than 150 years after they became known to Western explorers. The islands appeared on Portuguese charts as early as 1505, although Arabs may have visited them much earlier. In 1742, the French Governor of Mauritius, Mahe de Labourdonais, sent an expedition to the islands. A second expedition in 1756 reasserted formal possession by France and gave the islands their present name in honor of the French finance minister under King Louis XV. The new French colony barely survived its first decade and did not begin to flourish until 1794, when Queau de Quincy became commandant. The Seychelles islands were captured and freed several times during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, then passed officially to the British under the 1814 Treaty of Paris.\n\nFrom the date of its founding by the French until 1903, the Seychelles colony was regarded as a dependency of Mauritius, which also passed from the French to British rule in 1814. In 1888, a separate administrator and executive and administrative councils were established for the Seychelles archipelago. Nine years later, the administrator acquired full powers of a British colonial governor, and on August 31, 1903, Seychelles became a separate British Crown Colony.\n\nBy 1963, political parties had developed in the Seychelles colony. Elections in 1963 were contested for the first time on party lines. In 1964 two new parties, the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) led by James Mancham, and the Seychelles People’s Unity Party (SPUP) led by France Albert Rene, replaced existing parties.\n\nIn March 1970, colonial and political representatives of Seychelles met in London for a constitutional convention. Elections in November 1970 brought the resulting constitution into effect. In the November 1970 elections, the SDP won 10 seats, and the SPUP won 5 in the Legislative Assembly. Under the new constitution, Mancham became the Chief Minister of the colony.\n\nFurther elections were held in April 1974, in which both major political parties campaigned for independence. During the April 1974 elections, the SDP increased its majority in the Legislative Assembly by 3 seats, gaining all but 2 of the 15 seats. Demarcation of constituencies was such that the SDP achieved this majority by winning only 52% of the popular vote.\n\nFollowing the 1974 election, negotiations with the British resulted in an agreement by which Seychelles became a sovereign republic on June 29, 1976. The SDP and SPUP formed a coalition government in June 1975 to lead Seychelles to independence. The British Government was asked to appoint an electoral review commission so that divergent views on the electoral system and composition of the legislature could be reconciled.\n\nAs a result, 10 seats were added to the Legislative Assembly, 5 to be nominated by each party. A cabinet of ministers also was formed consisting of 8 members of the SDP and 4 of the SPUP, with Chief Minister Mancham becoming Prime Minister. With independence on June 29, 1976, Mancham assumed the office of President and Rene became Prime Minister.\n\nThe negotiations following the 1974 elections also restored the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Des Roches to Seychelles upon independence; those islands had been transferred in November 1965 from Seychelles to form part of the new British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).\n\nAlthough the SDP/SPUP coalition appeared to operate smoothly, political divisions between the two parties continued. On June 5, 1977, during Mancham’s absence at the London Commonwealth Conference, supporters of Prime Minister Rene overthrew Mancham in a smoothly executed coup and installed Rene as President. President Rene suspended the constitution and dismissed the parliament. The country was ruled by decree until June 1979, when a new constitution was adopted.\n\nIn November 1981, a group of mercenaries attempted to overthrow the Rene government but failed when they were detected at the airport and repelled. The government was threatened again by an army mutiny in August 1982, but it was quelled after 2 days when loyal troops, reinforced by Tanzanian forces, recaptured rebel-held installations.\n\nAt an Extraordinary Congress of the Seychelles People’s Progressive Front (SPPF) on December 4, 1991, President Rene announced a return to the multiparty system of government after almost 16 years of one-party rule. On December 27, 1991, the Constitution of Seychelles was amended to allow for the registration of political parties. Among the exiles returning to Seychelles was James Mancham, who returned in April 1992 to revive his party, the Democratic Party (DP). By the end of that month, eight political parties had registered to contest the first stage of the transition process: election to the constitutional commission, which took place on July 23-26, 1992. The constitutional commission was made up of 22 elected members, 14 from the SPPF and 8 from the DP. It commenced work on August 27, 1992 with both President Rene and Mancham calling for national reconciliation and consensus on a new democratic constitution.\n\nA consensus text was agreed upon on May 7, 1993, and a referendum to approve it was called for June 15-18. The draft was approved with 73.9% of the electorate in favor of it and 24.1% against. July 23-26, 1993 saw the first multiparty presidential and legislative elections held under the new constitution, as well as a resounding victory for President Rene.\n\nThree political groups contested the elections—the SPPF, the DP, and the United Opposition (UO)—a coalition of three smaller political parties, including Parti Seselwa. Two other smaller opposition parties threw in their lot with the DP. All participating parties and international observer groups accepted the results as “free and fair.” Three candidates contested the March 20-22, 1998 presidential election—Albert Rene, SPPF; James Mancham, DP; and Wavel Ramkalawan—and once again President Rene and his SPPF party won a landslide victory. The President’s popularity in elections jumped to 66.6% in 1998 from 59.5% in 1993, while the SPPF garnered 61.7% of the total votes cast in the 1998 National Assembly election, compared to 56.5% in 1993.\n\nGOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nThe president is both the chief of state and head of government and is elected by popular vote for a 5-year term. The Council of Ministers serves as a cabinet, and its members are appointed by the president. The unicameral National Assembly has 34 seats—25 elected by popular vote and 9 allocated on a proportional basis to parties winning at least 10% of the vote; members serve 5-year terms. The judicial branch includes a Court of Appeal and Supreme Court; judges for both courts are appointed by the president. The legal system is based on English common law, French civil law, and customary law.\n\nSeychelles has had a multi-party system with the adoption of a new Constitution in 1992. Since then, multiparty elections took place in 1993, 1998, 2001, and 2006. The Seychelles People’s Progressive Front (SPPF) won all four elections.\n\nPresidential elections were held in July 2006. Incumbent President James Michel of the Seychelles People’s Progressive Front, who was appointed to power by former President Rene in 2004, won his first elected term. The final vote count was 53.73% for Michel to 45.71% for opposition alliance candidate and Seychelles National Party (SNP) leader, Wavel Ramkalawan. The electoral process for the 2006 presidential elections was determined to be credible by international observers. Parliamentary elections are expected to be held in 2007.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nLast Updated: 9/26/2006\n\nPresident: James Alix MICHEL\n\nVice President: Joseph BELMONT\n\nMin. of Agriculture & Marine Resources: William HERMINIE\n\nMin. of Arts, Culture, & Sports: Sylvette POOL\n\nMin. of Community Development & Youth: Vincent MERITON\n\nMin. of Education: Bernard SHAMLAYE\n\nMin. of Environment: Ronnie JUMEAU\n\nMin. of Finance & Designated Minister: Danny FAURE\n\nMin. of Foreign Affairs & International Cooperation: Patrick Georges PILLAY\n\nMin. of Health: MacSuzy MONDON\n\nMin. of Land Use & Habitiat: Joel MORGAN\n\nMin. of Investment, Industries, & Technology: Jacqueline DUGASSE\n\nMin. of Internal Affairs, Defense, & Legal Affairs: James Alix MICHEL\n\nMin. of Public Administration: Joseph BELMONT\n\nMin. of Social Affairs & Employment: Marie-Pierre LLOYD\n\nMin. of Tourism & Transport: Joseph BELMONT\n\nGovernor, Central Bank: Norman WEBER\n\nAmbassador to the US:\n\nPermanent Representative to the UN, New York: Jeremie BONNELAME\n\nECONOMY\n\nBased on per capita income, the overall performance of the economy since independence must be considered satisfactory, with a seven-fold increase from some $1,000 per capita in 1976 to $7,600 today. The public sector, comprising the government and state-owned enterprises, dominates the economy in terms of employment (two-thirds of the labor force) and gross revenue. Public consumption absorbs over one-third of the gross domestic product (GDP). GDP growth in 2001 was 3.3%.\n\nThe economy rests on tourism and fishing. For 2000, the Central Bank estimates that the Seychelles economy grew by around 1.4% in real terms, despite a foreign exchange problem, which affected primarily the manufacturing industry.\n\nThe economy’s growth in 2000 was thanks largely to a rebound in the tourism industry and the strength of the fishing sector. In 2001, tourism accounted for about 12.7% of GDP, and the manufacturing and construction sectors, including industrial fishing, accounted for about 28.8%.\n\nBut the country’s economy is extremely vulnerable to external shocks. Not only does it depend on tourism, but it imports more than 90% of its total primary and secondary production inputs. Any decline in tourism quickly translates into a fall in GDP, a decline in foreign exchange receipts, and budgetary difficulties.\n\nFurthermore, recent changes in the climate have greatly affected the tuna industry.\n\nServices\n\nTourism is one of the most important sectors of the economy. Employment, foreign earnings, construction, banking, and commerce are all dominated by tourism-related industries. Tourism arrivals, one of the two main indicators of vitality in the sector, grew by 4.1% in 2000. A strong marketing effort by the Seychelles Tourism Marketing Authority (STMA) and the introduction of several new five-star hotels seems to have spurred the growth. Officials hoped that new hotels on the drawing board and expanded airline service to the island would help offset the possibility of reduced global travel in the environment following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. In 2003, tourism earned $681.3 million. About 122,000 tourists visited Seychelles in 2003, 81.7% of them from Europe (U.K., Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland).\n\nIn 2000, there were encouraging performances in service sectors besides tourism, namely the telecommunications sector, where the boom in mobile services continues. According to the telecommunications division of the Ministry of Information Technology and Communication, one in every four Seychellois owns a mobile phone. In recent years, some port operations have been privatized, a trend that has been accompanied by a fall in transshipment fees and an increase in efficiency. Overall, this has sparked a recovery in port services following a drastic fall in 1994.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is responsible for economic decisions and budgetary policy. A separate Monetary Authority supervises the banking system and manages the money supply. Although foreign banks operate branches in Seychelles, the government owns the two local banks—the Development Bank of Seychelles, which mobilizes resources to fund development programs, and the Seychelles Saving Bank, a bank for savings and current accounts.\n\nThe commercial banking sector is presently made up of the following:\n\nBarclays Bank PLC;\n\nMauritius Commercial Bank;\n\nBank of Baroda;\n\nHabib Bank; and\n\nSeychelles International Mercantile Credit Banking Corporation (SIMBC) trading under the name “Nouvobanq.”\n\nThe first four are branches of foreign banks, and the latter is a joint venture between the Seychelles Government and the Standard Chartered Bank African PLC. Commercial banks offer the full range of services.\n\nIndustry and Agriculture\n\nIndustrial fishing in Seychelles, notably tuna fishing, is an increasingly significant factor in the economy. In 2000, industrial fishing surpassed tourism as the most important foreign exchange earner. Earnings are growing annually from licensing fees paid by foreign trawlers fishing in Seychelles’ territorial waters. In 1995, Seychelles saw the privatization of the Seychelles Tuna Canning Factory, 60% of which was purchased by the American food company Heinz Inc.\n\nAgriculture, (including artisanal and forestry), once the backbone of the economy, now accounts for only around 2.4% of the GDP. While the tourism and industrial fishing industries were on a roll in the late 1990s, the traditional plantation economy atrophied. Cinnamon barks and copra—traditional export crops—had dwindled to negligible amounts by 1991. There were no exports of copra in 1996; 318 tons of cinnamon bark was exported in 1996, reflecting a decrease of 35% in cinnamon bark exports from 1995. In an effort to increase agricultural self-sufficiency, Seychelles has undertaken steps to make the sector more productive and to provide incentives to farmers. Much of the state holdings in the agricultural sector have been privatized, while the role of the government has been reduced to conducting research and providing infrastructure.\n\nOther industrial activities are limited to small-scale manufacturing, particularly agro-processing and import substitution. Despite attempts to improve its agricultural base and emphasize locally manufactured products and indigenous materials, Seychelles continues to import 90% of what it consumes. The exceptions are some fruits and vegetables, fish, poultry, pork, beer, cigarettes, paint, and a few locally made plastic items. Imports of all kind are controlled by the Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB), a government parastatal which operates all the major supermarkets and is the distributor and licensor of most other imports.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nIn 2002, Seychelles had a defense force (Seychelles People’s Defence Forces) of about 800 army personnel, including 300 in the presidential protection unit. The army has one infantry battalion and two artillery elements. Paramilitary forces include a national guard consisting of 1,000 people and a coast guard estimated at 250 and divided into two divisions, the naval wing and security or infantry division.\n\nThe Seychelles Coast Guard (SCG), which was created in 1992, assumes many of the maritime roles commonly associated with the U.S. Coast Guard. They recently acquired responsibility for search and rescue for vessel incidents as well as environmental protection from the Port and Marine Services Division. SCG has several operational vessels: the Russian-built Fortune, the Italian-built Andromache, the Scorpio, two Indian manufactured vessels, four Motor Life Boats, and the luxury yacht Gemini that also is used as the presidential yacht.\n\nThe air wing of the defense force separated from the coast guard in 1997 and does not have any dedicated aircraft, but it sometimes supplies pilots and aircrews to fly search and rescue missions. Their primary duty is to train pilots. The Island Development Corporation (IDC) maintains the pool of aircraft, using them for sources of income by chartering them out. The aircraft inventory includes one Caravan F-406, one Defender, one Cessna 150, and one Beech 1900.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\n\nSeychelles follows a policy of what it describes as “positive” nonalignment and strongly supports the principle of reduced superpower presence in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Seychelles Government is one of the proponents of the Indian Ocean zone of peace concept, and it has promoted an end to the U.S. presence on Diego Garcia. Seychelles’ foreign policy position has placed it generally toward the left of the spectrum within the Nonaligned Movement.\n\nThe Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, France, India, China, and Cuba maintain embassies in Victoria. Seychelles has an ambassador resident in New York dually accredited to the United Nations and to the United States and Canada. It also has a resident ambassador to France.\n\nSeychelles is a member of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM), the African Union, Commonwealth, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), La Francophonie, and the UN and some of its specialized and related agencies.\n\nU.S.-SEYCHELLES RELATIONS\n\nThe year 1963 marked the beginning of an official U.S. presence in Seychelles when the U.S. Air Force Tracking Station was built and put into operation on Mahé. The USAF Tracking Station facilities were situated on land that was leased from the Seychelles Government ($4.5 million annually).\n\nThe station’s complement consisted of five uniformed Air Force personnel (two officers and three sergeants), 65 employees of Loral Corporation and Johnson Instruments, and 150 Seychellois employees. The USAF Tracking Station officially closed down on September 30, 1996.\n\nPeace Corps Volunteers served in Seychelles between 1974 and 1995. A U.S. consulate was opened in May 1976 and became an Embassy after Seychelles’ independence in June 1976. The Embassy was subsequently closed in August 1996, and the United States opened a consular agency on September 2, 1996 to provide services to residents of Seychelles. The agency is under the supervision of the American Embassy in Port Louis, Mauritius. The U.S. Ambassador to Mauritius also is accredited to Seychelles.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nPORT LOUIS (E) Address: 4th Floor Rogers House, Port Louis, Mauritius; Phone: (230) 202-4400; Fax: (230) 208-9534; INMARSAT Tel: 881631439038/881631439039; Workweek: M-Th: 0730-1645; F: 0730-1230; Website: http://mauritius.usembassy.gov/.\n\nAMB:Cesar CabreraAMB OMS:vacantDCM:Stephen SchwartzDCM/CHG:Stephen SchwartzDCM OMS:Ellen BrooksPOL:Margaret HsiangCON:Wendy RydeMGT:Judith SemilotaCLO:Henry SemilotaCUS:E.J.

The main islands of this archipelago include Mahe, which is the largest, followed by Praslin and La Digue. The total population is approximately 81,000. The capital, Victoria, is located on Mahe.\n\nEntry/Exit Requirements: A valid passport, onward/return ticket, the local address where the visitor will stay, and proof of sufficient funds are required. A one-month entry visa may be obtained upon arrival and may be extended for a period of up to one year. There is an airport departure tax of $40, which must be paid in U.S. dollars. Travelers should contact the Permanent Mission of the Seychelles to the United Nations, 800 Second Avenue, Suite 400C, New York, N.Y. 10017; telephone number (212) 972-1785, for the most current visa information.\n\nSafety and Security: U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations. It is dangerous to swim alone at isolated beaches, especially after dark, due to strong currents.\n\nFor the latest security information, Americans traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department’s Internet web site, where the current Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, Travel Warnings and Public Announcements, can be found. Up-to-date information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the U.S. and Canada, or for callers outside the U.S. and Canada, a regular toll-line at 1-202-501-4444. These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\n\nCrime: Petty crime is a problem, but violent crime against tourists is rare. To reduce the risk of theft, travelers should keep valuables in hotel safes and close and lock hotel windows at night, even while the room is occupied. Hotels that do not have private safes in the rooms will usually have one at the reception desk.\n\nInformation for Victims of Crime: The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. If you are the victim of a crime while overseas, in addition to reporting to local police, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. The Embassy/Consulate staff can, for example, assist you to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how funds could be transferred. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is solely the responsibility of local authorities, consular officers can help you to understand the local criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed.\n\nMedical Facilities and Health Information: Medical facilities in Seychelles are limited, especially on the isolated islands where doctors are often unavailable. There is one government-owned hospital and several private clinics.\n\nRecent years have seen an increase in the number of cases of chikungunya, a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. For more information and information on current outbreaks, please see the CDC’s fact sheet on Chikungunya.\n\nInformation on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection, may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the CDC’s internet site at http://www.cdc.gov/travel. For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad consult the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website at http://www.who.int/en. Further health information for travelers is available at http://www.who.int/ith.\n\nMedical Insurance: The Department of State strongly urges Americans to consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling abroad to confirm whether their policy applies overseas and whether it will cover emergency expenses such as a medical evacuation.\n\nTraffic Safety and Road Conditions: While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning Seychelles is provided for general reference only and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.\n\nIn Seychelles, one drives on the left side of the street. Roads are generally well maintained but are narrow and winding. Drivers should exercise caution due to a lack of shoulders and inadequate street lighting. Speed limits range from 25 to 50 miles an hour. Drivers and front seat passengers are required to wear seat belts. There are no laws regarding child safety seats.\n\nThe Seychelles Ministry of Health operates an ambulance service on the islands of Mahe, Praslin, and La Digue that can be summoned by dialing 999. Assistance on the more remote islands is limited. For more information, contact the Ministry of Health at P.O. Box 52, Victoria, Maher, Seychelles; telephone (248) 388 000; email: [email protected]. Public transportation by bus is good but tends to be crowded during rush hours and usually requires several transfers to reach a desired destination. Taxis are also available.\n\nFor specific information concerning Seychelles driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, contact the Seychelles Ministry of Tourism via email at [email protected] or the Seychelles Tourism Marketing Authority via email at [email protected].\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service between the United States and Seychelles, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Seychelles’ Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. For more information, travelers may visit the FAA’s internet website at http://www.faa.gov.\n\nSpecial Circumstances: Due to strict laws regulating foreign exchange, all visitors are required to settle bills for tourism-related services in foreign currency, i.e. U.S. Dollars or Euros. Generally, cash, traveler’s checks, and some credit cards are accepted. This regulation applies to all hotel charges (including bar and restaurant bills), car/driver rental, tours, boat charters, and diving. Bills for restaurants outside hotels and for taxis and other incidentals may be settled in Seychellois rupees. Visitors should note that automatic teller machines (ATMs) only distribute Seychellois rupees, and the Seychellois government limits the amount of Seychellois rupees visitors can convert back into foreign exchange before leaving the country. Also, it can be difficult to obtain foreign exchange while in Seychelles, so visitors may wish to bring some cash with them and check on options for payment of tourism-related services before arrival. Exchanging money on the informal, black market is illegal. The Government of Seychelles prohibits wearing any camouflage apparel in the country unless one is participating in a sanctioned, military activity.\n\nCriminal Penalties: While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject to that country’s laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating Seychelles law, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Seychelles are strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and heavy fines. Engaging in sex with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime, and is prosecutable in the United States.\n\nChildren’s Issues: For information on international adoption of children and international parental child abduction, see the Office of Children’s Issues website at http://travel.state.gov/family/family_1732.html.\n\nRegistration/Embassy Location: Americans living or traveling in Seychelles are encouraged to register with the U.S. Embassy in Port Louis Mauritius through the State Depart-ment’s travel registration website and to obtain updated information on travel and security within Seychelles. Americans without Internet access may register directly with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. By registering, American citizens make it easier for the Embassy or Consulate to contact them in case of emergency. The U.S. Embassy is located at Rogers House, Fourth Floor, Port Louis, Mauritius. The telephone numbers are (230) 202 4400; fax (230) 208 9534. In the event of an after hours emergency, the Embassy duty officer may be contacted at (230) 253 3641. The Embassy website is http://mauritius.usembassy.gov; e-mail [email protected]. The U.S. Consular Agency in Victoria, Seychelles that provides limited services to Americans in need of assistance is temporarily closed due to a staffing gap. When the consular agency reopens U.S. citizens will again be able to obtain passport applications, Social Security applications, and consular report of birth applications there. In the interim, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Seychelles requiring assistance are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Port Louis, Mauritius. The U.S. Consular Agency is located at Oliaji Trade Center, Victoria, Mahe; telephone (248) 225-256; fax (248) 225-189; e-mail [email protected]. The international mailing address is U.S. Consular Agency, P.O. Box 251, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.\n\nInternational Adoption : October 2006\n\nThe information below has been edited from a report of the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Overseas Citizens Services.

The nation is an archipelago of 115 tropical islands with two distinct collections of islands, some comprised of granite and others of coral. The Mahe Group consists of 42 granite islands, all within a 56-kilometer (35-mi.) radius of the main island of Mahe. These islands are rocky, and most have a narrow coastal stripe and a central range of hills rising as high as 914 meters (3,000 ft.). Mahe is the largest island—9,142 sq. km (55 sq. mi.)—and is the site of Victoria, the capital. The coral islands are flat with elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation. They have no fresh water; human life can be sustained on them only with difficulty.\n\nThe climate is equable and healthy, although quite humid, as the islands are small and subject to marine influences. The temperature varies little throughout the year. Temperatures on Mahe vary from 24ºC to 29.9ºC (75ºF-85ºF), and rainfall ranges from 288 centimeters (90 in.) annually at Victoria to 355 centimeters (140 in.) on the mountain slopes. Precipitation is somewhat less on the other islands. During the coolest months, July and August, the temperature drops to as low as 70ºF. The southeast trade winds blow regularly from May to November, and this is the most pleasant time of the year. The hot months are from December to April, with higher humidity (80). March and April are the hottest months, but the temperature seldom exceeds 88ºF. Most of the islands lie outside the cyclone belt, so high winds are rare.\n\nPEOPLE\n\nAbout 90% of the Seychellois people live on Mahe Island. Most others live on Praslin and La Digue, with the remaining smaller islands either sparsely populated or uninhabited.\n\nMost Seychellois are descendants of early French settlers and the African slaves brought to the Seychelles in the 19th century by the British, who freed them from slave ships on the East African coast. Indians and Chinese (1.1% of the population) account for the other permanent inhabitants. In 2002, about 4,000 expatriates lived and worked in Seychelles. Of those, about 35 are American.\n\nSeychelles culture is a mixture of French and African (Creole) influences. Creole is the native language of 94% of the people; however, English and French are commonly used. English remains the language of government and commerce.\n\nAbout 88% of the adult population is literate, and the literacy rate of school-aged children has risen to well over 98%. Increases are expected, as nearly all children of primary school age attend school, and the government encourages adult education.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Seychelles islands remained uninhabited for more than 150 years after they became known to Western explorers. The islands appeared on Portuguese charts as early as 1505, although Arabs may have visited them much earlier. In 1742, the French Governor of Mauritius, Mahe de Labourdonais, sent an expedition to the islands. A second expedition in 1756 reasserted formal possession by France and gave the islands their present name in honor of the French finance minister under King Louis XV. The new French colony barely survived its first decade and did not begin to flourish until 1794, when Queau de Quincy became commandant.\n\nThe Seychelles islands were captured and freed several times during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, then passed officially to the British under the 1814 Treaty of Paris.\n\nFrom the date of its founding by the French until 1903, the Seychelles colony was regarded as a dependency of Mauritius, which also passed from the French to British rule in 1814. In 1888, a separate administrator and executive and administrative councils were established for the Seychelles archipelago. Nine years later, the administrator acquired full powers of a British colonial governor, and on August 31, 1903, Seychelles became a separate British Crown Colony.\n\nBy 1963, political parties had developed in the Seychelles colony. Elections in 1963 were contested for the first time on party lines. In 1964 two new parties, the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP) led by James Mancham, and the Seychelles People's Unity Party (SPUP) led by France Albert Rene, replaced existing parties.\n\nIn March 1970, colonial and political representatives of Seychelles met in London for a constitutional convention. Elections in November 1970 brought the resulting constitution into effect. In the November 1970 elections, the SDP won 10 seats, and the SPUP won 5 in the Legislative Assembly. Under the new constitution, Mancham became the Chief Minister of the colony.\n\nFurther elections were held in April 1974, in which both major political parties campaigned for independence. During the April 1974 elections, the SDP increased its majority in the Legislative Assembly by 3 seats, gaining all but 2 of the 15 seats. Demarcation of constituencies was such that the SDP achieved this majority by winning only 52% of the popular vote.\n\nFollowing the 1974 election, negotiations with the British resulted in an agreement by which Seychelles became a sovereign republic on June 29, 1976. The SDP and SPUP formed a coalition government in June 1975 to lead Seychelles to independence. The British Government was asked to appoint an electoral review commission so that divergent views on the electoral system and composition of the legislature could be reconciled. As a result, 10 seats were added to the Legislative Assembly, 5 to be nominated by each party. A cabinet of ministers also was formed consisting of 8 members of the SDP and 4 of the SPUP, with Chief Minister Mancham becoming Prime Minister. With independence on June 29, 1976, Mancham assumed the office of President and Rene became Prime Minister.\n\nThe negotiations following the 1974 elections also restored the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Des Roches to Seychelles upon independence; those islands had been transferred in November 1965 from Seychelles to form part of the new British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).\n\nAlthough the SDP/SPUP coalition appeared to operate smoothly, political divisions between the two parties continued. On June 5, 1977, during Mancham's absence at the London Commonwealth Conference, supporters of Prime Minister Rene overthrew Mancham in a smoothly executed coup and installed Rene as President. President Rene suspended the constitution\n\nand dismissed the parliament. The country was ruled by decree until June 1979, when a new constitution was adopted.\n\nIn November 1981, a group of mercenaries attempted to overthrow the Rene government but failed when they were detected at the airport and repelled. The government was threatened again by an army mutiny in August 1982, but it was quelled after 2 days when loyal troops, reinforced by Tanzanian forces, recaptured rebel-held installations.\n\nAt an Extraordinary Congress of the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF) on December 4, 1991, President Rene announced a return to the multiparty system of government after almost 16 years of one-party rule. On December 27, 1991, the Constitution of Seychelles was amended to allow for the registration of political parties. Among the exiles returning to Seychelles was James Mancham, who returned in April 1992 to revive his party, the Democratic Party (DP). By the end of that month, eight political parties had registered to contest the first stage of the transition process: election to the constitutional commission, which took place on July 23-26, 1992.\n\nThe constitutional commission was made up of 22 elected members, 14 from the SPPF and 8 from the DP. It commenced work on August 27, 1992 with both President Rene and Mancham calling for national reconciliation and consensus on a new democratic constitution. A consensus text was agreed upon on May 7, 1993, and a referendum to approve it was called for June 15-18. The draft was approved with 73.9% of the electorate in favor of it and 24.1% against.\n\nJuly 23-26, 1993 saw the first multi-party presidential and legislativ"
