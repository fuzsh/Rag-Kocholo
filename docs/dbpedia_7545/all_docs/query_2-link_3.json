        "text": "A trip down memory lane...\n\nReviewed By Beazleteats\n\nHello. I'm originally from Cape Town, now living in Sydney. We had the pleasure of living at the BL Chalets for 3 weeks over our June holidays in 1993. We had our three year old daughter, my mother-in-law and my two nephews aged three and five with us. It still rates as one of the best holiday of our lives. Fast forward to August 2021 to a recent dinner we had with my daughter and her two nephews now aged 32 & 35. The boys still talk about the Blue Lagoon holiday as the best holiday they have ever had...both boys are well traveled and now live in Italy. They have a very vivid memory of Ferial (or Fairy as the kids called her) and how lovely she was in them organising coconut opening activities as well as excursions into a surrounding coconut plantation. At night they loved digging up the ghost crabs on the beach to see how many they could collect before returning them to their tunnels on the stunning beach of Anse la Mouche. The evening crab hunts were followed by take away pizza from the Anchor Cafe next door...I think it was owned and run by an American guy called Bob (Iwonder if he's still running it?) We had hired a bright yellow Mini-Moke and had so much fun exploring the island.of Mahe. But after a busy day exploring it was so wonderful to 'come home' to the chalet for sundowners on the lovely veranda. We discovered two expat artists who had moved to make their home on the island. Michael Adams, a print maker & painter has been documenting life in the Seychelles in vivid colours since 1972. We bought a number of his painting which hang proudly in our homes in Australia, Botswana & Italy. Sculptor Tom Bowers, (who sadly passed in March this year) made wonderful bronze sculptures of the local people and fauna . We had the privilege of visiting his studio to watch him sculpt his clay models which he would later cast. We purchased two wonderful sculptures, one lives on our mantlepiece in Sydney, Australia, the other in our home in Botswana. Ferial booked us a few day trips out to the surrounding islands which was awesome. We could easily have stayed in one of the many resorts on Mahe, which, with three kids under five, would have been much easier, but we prefer immersing ourselves into the local communities we visit, and The Blue Lagoon Chalets was the perfect base to explore the many sights Mahe has to offer. Three weeks was just too short to see everything Mahe has to offer. We highly recommend the BL Chalets. Thank you Ferial for being such a wonderful host so many years ago...we still dine out on our experiences there. And thank you for the memories that will live on through our children for many decades to come."
