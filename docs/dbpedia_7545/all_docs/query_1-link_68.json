        "text": "Greetings Visitors!\n\nSince its publication, news of the Endonym Map has traveled far and wide. It has been featured on many popular websites and has received visitors from almost every country on the planet. I've enjoyed reading the discussions across the Internet and social media, as well as the emails I have received. I am pleased that the map has gotten a mostly positive, sometimes enthusiastic, response.\n\nI am also aware that this map in its current form has flaws. Cartography is an iterative process and no single map will ever be absolutely correct. No matter how hard we try, we can always measure how far from perfect our attempts land. Your suggestions for corrections and updates are being noted and catalogued for possible use in future versions.\n\nOne big change I am exploring is the inclusion of minority language endonyms in some fashion. I would love to put all three official languages for Belgium on the map, or both Ireland and Éire for that matter. But with the limited space on a fixed map, there's just not room to do it fairly for all countries. And it bugs me to no end that places like South Africa and India have a dozen or so recognized languages, but there's only room on the map for one. But I am working on it and hopefully will come to a solution soon.\n\nIn the meantime, please enjoy the map!\n\nSee below the map for answers, corrections and discussion.\n\nAnswers, Errata and Discussion\n\nA map of this nature taps into some deep notions of personal identity and can arouse strong nationalist passions. Indeed, I've received many (mostly polite) questions and comments asking why a particular language was used for a label, where a particular name came from or why certain features were included or excluded from the map. The section below explains in greater detail why the map looks the way it does. It also mentions a few mistakes that will be corrected in the next edition of the map.\n\nWhere do the country names come from?\n\nThe vast majority of names come from the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographic Names and the U.N.'s database of country names. Other sources include the CIA World Fact Book, Wikipedia and various government websites.\n\nX isn't a country.\n\nThe map includes disputed territories if they have established de facto sovereignty over their territory, regardless of international recognition.\n\nAlso, labels may imply that some areas are sovereign countries when they are not. Such instances are noted in the Errata below.\n\nX isn't a native language.\n\nThe Endonym Map expressly does not use the word \"native\" to describe the languages shown. These languages are local in that they are used officially or by the largest percentage of the local population. Because it is a map of countries (as opposed to peoples), it should more properly be read as a map of languages likely to be used for official business.\n\nIt is important to note that an endonym may not necessarily come from an area's indigenous language. Indeed, as a lasting effect of European colonialism, indigenous languages are often minority languages. The intent of this map is not to show place names in their \"original\" languages, but with the languages that are currently in use. In that sense, many of these names are native (i.e. used by local natives). But because of the potential for ambiguity and confusion, this map does not and will not refer to them that way.\n\nFurther, because many of these countries did not exist until Europeans carved up their borders, there may not be an indigenous name for them.\n\nWhere are Wales and Scotland?\n\nThe map shows top-level sovereignty based on ISO 3166 definitions (which are based on publication from the United Nations). Because this is an international map, countries are labeled with the face they show the world. The United Kingdom faces the world as a single entity (save for matters of football), thus it is labeled with the name it uses for international relations.\n\nIreland should be labeled in Irish as Éire.\n\nBoth \"Ireland\" and \"Éire\" are endonyms for the country. But because English is the more widely used language there, Ireland was chosen to be the label. Based on the 2006 census, only 30-40% of the population considers itself competent in the Irish language, with less than 10% using the language on an everyday basis.\n\nFor similar reasons, Isle of Man is labeled in English rather than Manx.\n\nIf you're going to use English, Ireland should be \"Republic of Ireland\".\n\nThe Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 provides an official description of the state as the Republic of Ireland. But the Irish constitution states the name is simply Ireland (or Éire), and it would require a constitutional amendment to change it.\n\nOn a similar note, Iceland is sometimes referred to as the Republic of Iceland (Lýðveldið Ísland), even by the United Nations. However, the word \"republic\" is written in lowercase letters in the Icelandic constitution. Thus, as with Ireland, \"republic\" is used as a descriptor and is not part of the name proper.\n\nAntarctica?\n\nIf penguins could speak, what would they call it?\n\nAs politically-neutral territory, Antarctica does not have an endonym per se. However, among the territorial claimants, the majority of the continent is composed of English-speaking countries. English is also used as the lingua franca among various research stations there.\n\nWhere's the pronunciation guide?\n\nThe scope of this map is limited to writing systems. If you wish to find a pronunciation or romanization of a country's name, I recommend starting at its Wikipedia entry.\n\nErrata\n\nKnown errors. A special thank you to all the commenters and correspondents who helped me identify these. I apologize for them and they will be fixed.\n\nFiji is mis-labeled as \"Republic of the Fiji Islands\". The country changed its name to \"Republic of Fiji\" in 2011.\n\nThe map implies that Tasmania is a separate country. The island is in fact a state of Australia.\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands west of Thailand are a Union Territory of India and should be labeled as such.\n\nThe island group north of Maldives are the Lakshadweep Islands. They are also a Union Territory of India.\n\nAlaska should be labeled \"Alaska (U.S.A)\".\n\nThe British Virgin Islands should be labeled as \"The Virgin Islands\". The \"British\" designation is not part of the territory's official name.\n\nDespite its similarity to Portuguese, Spanish is not a historically significant language in Brazil. Upon further probing, sources used to make that claim cannot be verified. Brazil should not be shaded on the Hispanofonia corner map.\n\nAlthough English is the only official language in Sierra Leone, 90+% of its population understands Krio. As with Haiti, it should be labeled in two languages. I have not been able to find a full Krio translation of \"Republic of Sierra Leone\" however. Sierra Leone is called Salone in Krio.\n\nEnglish is the dominant language of government, business and media in South Africa and is considered more politically neutral. Zulu, however, has many more speakers there and a Zulu endonym should have been included: iRiphabliki yaseNingizimu Afrika\n\nThe Maldives script was flipped when the map rendered. It should be read right-to-left like so:\n\nThe font for Bangladesh did not render properly. It should read like so:\n\nLinks\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of African names and indigenous languages, see African Country Names in Indigenous Languages at GeoCurrents.\n\nContact\n\nIf you've read this far and you still have questions, comments, corrections, compliments or insults, send them to [email protected].\n\nChangelog\n\n2013 edition changes\n\nThe world is an ever-changing place and hey, cartographers make mistakes. The 2013 edition of the Endonym Map contains the following changes and updates:\n\nIn 2012, Hungary passed a new constitution which shortened the country's name from \"Republic of Hungary\" to just \"Hungary\". The map reflects the new name in Hungarian.\n\nThe previous edition of the map showed the name of Mongolia in Mongolian script. Though the script is official, its use is considered more traditional. The Cyrillic alphabet is more widely used there, so the map now shows the name of the country in Cyrillic.\n\nThe \"Channel Islands\" in the English Channel have been separated into their proper names as the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey.\n\nA Pacific island that was discovered to not actually exist has been removed.\n\nThe endonym of Haiti is now shown both in French and Haitian Creole. This is because French is the dominant written language, while Haitian Creole is by more commonly spoken.\n\nVarious typographic and cartographic fixes and clean up.\n\n2014-03-08\n\nThis page now uses Leaflet to power the map, resulting in a smaller data footprint and faster load times."
