        "text": "“A blank page, where new laws, new codes, new systems of education, new freedom of speech, new forms of government, could be invented according to the principle of the greatest happiness for the greatest number.” It was roughly in these terms that Jeremy Bentham envisioned the economic and political potentials of Spain's “Ultramaria” (its American possessions) following the collapse of its empire.Footnote 1 In the wake of the Atlantic consequences of the Napoleonic Wars—a moment in what Eric Hobsbawm famously named the “Age of Revolution”—the early decades of the nineteenth century indeed saw the emergence of new American political regimes (i.e., Colombia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Buenos Ayres, and Guatemala) that essentially favored British trade.Footnote 2 Their representatives were in turn strongly encouraged by London merchant-bankers to finance the development and consolidation of newly acquired but fragile independence by floating loans on the London Stock Exchange. Between 1822 and 1825, a time when financial and mercantile activities were heavily confounded with each other, numerous British joint-stock companies also issued significant amounts of shares—often before obtaining the necessary parliamentary charters. These business activities were aimed at benefiting from the riches soon to be made available by the imminent development of a more direct British West Indian and transatlantic trade with the Americas.Footnote 3\n\nBentham himself considered the development of business and political enterprises within newly liberated American territories as participating in the concretization of new utopias, or “dreamed territories with, as yet, no real existence, and where new governments could be installed and legislation drawn up according to the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number.”Footnote 4 Rather than delusional idealizations devoid of any scientific interest, such utopias essentially established concrete forces of political and commercial change and, therefore, constituted specific efforts to transcend problematic historical situations: in this instance, Atlantic imperial transformation.Footnote 5 Yet the concretization of these changes took place in far-reaching and distinct local, regional, and transatlantic spaces, stretching from the Americas to the very heart of the City of London, and weaving also into the fabric of transatlantic trade flows in the making. In other words, the realization of such dreamed-of commercial and political projects took place simultaneously on different levels, and on multiple sides of an Atlantic World in transformation.Footnote 6\n\nHowever, when Bentham raved about the existence of American infant states, or ones that at that time existed only on (his) paper, he solely envisaged them as capable of emerging from and being consolidated by the effort of the Spanish revolutionaries of Ultramaria, brushing aside in a few lines the very existence of other actors (i.e., the “Indians”) of the political and economic processes that were then also transforming the Atlantic.Footnote 7 In a similar way, numerous studies have provided fascinating insights into the general and the more particular histories of the intricate political and financial endeavors that contributed to the making of new—and generally still existing—Spanish American republics and the improvement of their Atlantic commercial relationships with Britain.Footnote 8 However, recent works reveal how other, more discreet actors also played a role in the constitution and dissemination of nineteenth-century utopian ideas, ideals, and enterprises.Footnote 9 These suggest, in a way, that the histories of Atlantic transformations are ridden with “blind spots,” glaring absences that mark the “unacknowledged knowledges” of the diversity of actors and their levels of involvement in these political and, especially, financial and commercial metamorphoses.Footnote 10\n\nThis article casts light on one such “blind spot” in the Atlantic financial and political entanglements tied to these early years of American states formation and economic improvement. It does so by telling the well-studied story of the creation and financing of new American utopias, characteristic of these times, but from the perspective of an actor seldom considered in the relevant literature, namely that of an American Indigenous actor. His name was George Frederic Augustus II, king of the Miskitu on the Central American Miskitu Shore (hereafter referred to as “the Shore”) between 1816 and 1824.Footnote 11 This study illuminates how he sought, throughout his short-lived rule, to actively occupy various political and commercial spaces, near and far, in person and by proxy, in an Atlantic World undergoing important political and economic transformations, with echoes of his endeavors even reaching as far as the city of London's money market. Inspired by American Republican uprisings and the spreading of abolitionist ideas, George Frederic attempted to transform not only the economic and political foundations of his kingdom to concretize his own Miskitu utopia, for which he would even design a flag and draft a constitution; he also sought to reconfigure networks of foreign trade in Central America and the Caribbean, in which his kingdom had been and would remain an important node. Short on capital and labor, George Frederic had nevertheless benefited from an adequate education in matters related to regional politics and transatlantic trade. This enabled him to consider outsourcing the improvement of his territory to foreign agents with experience in statebuilding and financing: British mercenaries involved in Latin American revolutionary wars. These would, in his name, access both European and American capital markets to finance the realization of this Miskitu utopia.\n\nAs highlighted by Carlo Ginzburg or Alain Corbin, studying up close the life of a single, marginal individual or institution can reveal the often unsuspected interweaving of local, regional, or global dynamics in which they were (successfully or not) embedded.Footnote 12 Similarly, this article reintegrates George Frederic's actions within the various political, commercial, and financial dynamics in which they were inscribed, be they on the Shore, Central American, or transatlantic. Yet, in the absence of George Frederic's own memoirs, his story can only be written through a close reading of a wide range of dispersed archival sources, including manuscript and printed material found in repositories located in England, Scotland, and Belize. These hold diaries, newspaper articles, and private correspondence sent to or from George Frederic or that mention the Miskitu king. Taken together, these scattered documents constitute an original corpus of primary sources that help delve into different episodes of George Frederic's eventful life, from his upbringing to the constitution of his utopia.\n\nThis research also relies on the published testimonies of foreign merchants who encountered the Miskitu king. These were narratives provided most notably by Jacob Dunham, a North American trader who dealt with the Miskitu between 1816 and 1819, and, more importantly, by the English West Indian merchant Orlando Roberts, who visited the Shore regularly between 1816 and 1822.Footnote 13 Using such printed sources implies a potentially important self-centered bias, because these only transcribe the intentions and understandings of their authors. Indeed, both were writing for European or North American audiences interested in the development of trade relations with Central America in the aftermath of the collapse of the Spanish Empire. Contrary to Bentham and other contemporaries, Dunham and Roberts consider that the improvement of Atlantic trade in the region rested on a better understanding of the Shore's Indigenous polities, the latter providing access to natural resources of interest to European and American commerce.Footnote 14 Yet both texts are tinged with recurring tropes discriminating against the Miskitu (e.g., the “drunken Indian”), relatively common for the time. Descriptions provided by late modern European commentators of their interactions with American Indigenous interlocutors involving alcohol were often exaggerated, however, defined as they were by trepidations about the dangers of excessive drinking and anxieties about the place of American Indigenous peoples in new American societies.Footnote 15 An often contradictory image of George Frederic thus emerges from the reading of these accounts: he appears at the same time a feckless drunkard and a determined actor in full possession of his means.\n\nTo be clear, the Miskitu drank spirits, which they obtained from trade conducted with foreign merchants.Footnote 16 To portray George Frederic as a raging alcoholic, however, is certainly more than an exaggeration. Still, because these merchant accounts are not entirely “objective” does not mean they should be discarded. Considering such stereotypes, these remain at present some of the sole sources that can provide insight into and context for not only George Frederic's biography but also how the Miskitu conducted commercial and political interactions with various foreign actors. It is the multiplicity of often concordant testimonies that, taken together, make it possible to reconstruct the tumultuous life of George Frederic.Footnote 17 In turn, putting together such scattered clues allows for the telling of a chronological story of these Atlantic transformations from the unusual perspective of George Frederic. It also highlights whether certain actors or polities that are generally mischaracterized or omitted from the historiography in fact played an active role for their potential own utopian benefit within and between these different metamorphosing political and financial Atlantic spaces.\n\nHistoriographical attention paid to the Miskitu Shore offers rich insight into the region's Spanish, British, German, and American colonial history.Footnote 18 Studies focusing on the Miskitu in particular also offer valuable inquiries into their economic and political interrelations with and independence from the Shore's various colonial waves since Christopher Columbus's 1502 landing in the area.Footnote 19 Yet these historiographies generally focus on the geographical setting of the Shore, seldom investigating the impact that the events taking place there had beyond its borders.Footnote 20 George Frederic has also been the subject, in passing, of studies in colonial and Miskitu history. Rather than being portrayed as an individual worthy of any historical interest, he generally appears as a minor historical figure, owing to the short duration of his reign, or as a British colonial puppet (sharing the fate of many Miskitu rulers).Footnote 21 Moreover, George Frederic's story has often been confounded with that of Poyais. Specifically, he is often anecdotally remembered for having conceded in 1820, allegedly after a night of heavy drinking, the territory on which Gregor MacGregor planned to establish his principality of Poyais. This infamous story has been described as the “most audacious fraud in History,” with MacGregor believed to have been the fraudulent architect of the so-called fake state and loan of Poyais.Footnote 22 Yet recent works calling into question the fraudulent foundations of MacGregor's Poyaisian project make it possible to lift the veil of guilt or gullibility too often attached to the different actors involved, from near or far, in his affair—including George Frederic.Footnote 23\n\nPointing out how George Frederic's singular life both fitted into and molded, in often unsuspected ways, wider financial and political dynamics underlying the making of new American states offers a wider contribution to historiographical debates discussing the agency of American Indigenous actors in the shaping of Central American, Caribbean, and Atlantic trade and colonial networks. Seminal studies by such scholars as Arthur Ray, Ann Carlos and Lewis Frank, and Richard White have highlighted how American Indigenous peoples’ active involvement in the long eighteenth-century North American trade and colonial patterns affected their political and material cultures as well as their transatlantic commercial dynamics.Footnote 24 More recently, historians have noted how American Indigenous peoples played an active monetary or financial part in the development of North American capitalism, as well as how finance and money in themselves became tools of imperial dispossession for them.Footnote 25 Illuminating the longstanding involvement of Indigenous polities in the realm of American economic dynamics, these works allow for the integration of their subjects into novel fields of investigation, especially that of nineteenth-century business history.Footnote 26\n\nMore broadly, recent works focusing on nineteenth-century Pacific and North America discuss the need to consider Indigenous peoples on their own political terms, as full-fledged state actors, or even imperial actors.Footnote 27 Not only do these challenge commonly accepted understandings of global political landscapes by providing more nuanced narratives of the imperial transformations and competitions of their time; they also provide better insights into the historical trajectories of given Indigenous polities, without them being eclipsed by the chronologies, theories, or viewpoints imposed by colonial/imperial historiographical frameworks.Footnote 28 Although they tend to concentrate more on political than economic aspects, these historiographical developments are particularly relevant when it comes to studying the interwoven development of early nineteenth-century Central American, Caribbean, and wider Atlantic British merchant-banking and statebuilding processes, as historians seldom include American Indigenous peoples in their narratives, much less tell these stories from their perspectives.Footnote 29 At best, few studies mention the existence of political and commercial links between American Indigenous peoples and British traders.Footnote 30 Although these do, fortunately, nuance the asymmetrical relations in favor of British merchants and settlers emerging from such interactions, their scope is often limited to the American territory, and they generally understand American Indigenous history through the sole context of their relationships with foreigners.\n\nIn line with this scholarship, studying the biographical particularities of a Miskitu king at the head of an early nineteenth-century Central American and transatlantic Indigenous utopian venture sheds light on a drastic moment of global political, financial, and commercial possibility. It shows how George Frederic tried to benefit and shape the English drive to improve British trade in the Americas to his own financial, commercial, and political benefit. By highlighting the reach of George Frederic's action beyond the American continent, mainly from his perspective, this article also helps resituate the active global economic and political impacts that a Miskitu protagonist had—and could have had—within financial and colonial processes of early nineteenth-century statebuilding. Offering a chronological dive into George Frederic's life, each section of this article reveals insights into the creation, development, and tragic end of his utopia, along with the local, regional, and transatlantic impacts and progresses of this episode of Miskitu state formation. The first section provides contextual background to the Shore and biographical information on George Frederic from his early years to his accession to the throne in 1816. The second illustrates how a combination of local and Atlantic transformations offered George Frederic the opportunity to reposition himself politically within the Shore. The third describes how George Frederic envisioned, like other South American independence or abolitionist projects of the time, the establishment of a slave-free commercial and political utopia on the Shore. In doing so, this section details the interactions of George Frederic with foreign mercenaries to finance and build his project. The fourth section describes how George Frederic had to adapt his ambitions to deal with significant difficulties in establishing himself, on the London money market and the Shore, as the valid owner of his utopia—ultimately, to no avail. The last section concludes."
