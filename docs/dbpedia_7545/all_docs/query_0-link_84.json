        "text": "Since the 1970s there has been a significant interest in small island developing states (SIDS). Since the 1990s the vast majority of this focus has been on economic and environmental ‘vulnerabilities’. This paper reaffirms the importance of ‘the social’ when analysing the ‘vulnerabilities’ of SIDS through a country case study of Seychelles in the context of its SIDS status. It outlines Seychelles’ demographic processes and macroeconomic volatilities and discusses its post-independence social development achievements. This paper provides critical analysis of how these achievements have been attained and considers the extent to which the present levels are sustainable. It argues that significant social gains are under threat from a range of domestic and international forces, potentially destabilizing the main pillar of the economy, tourism. The paper concludes that while the economic and environmental vulnerabilities of SIDS are of conceptual importance, reaffirming the centrality of the social is vital to understanding the potential causes and consequences of these vulnerabilities.\n\nAt a time of rampant globalisation, large-scale operations are favoured over small-scale production in the main domains of the economy. This has political effects: domination by the big over the small is sought in both old and new ways; and cultural effects that influence from outside-such as Netflix, tourism and travel abroad-are intensified in the globally integrated information society. This in turn affects the media, language and self-identity, as well as being decisive for strategies in diplomacy, human security, planning and domestic politics. This article analyses the situation of the Seychelles in the 21st century: a small state, dependent on inputs from the outside world, and victim of a new form of colonialism. The country may still have potential to 'punch above its weight' and to hold its own, in spite of the disembedded, abstract economy of scale dominating this integrated, networked, accelerated, globalised world. For this to happen, a recognition and analysis of current changes are needed.\n\nClimate change is a wicked problem. This wickedness is hard to resolve and can lead to an adaptation gap, in which the maximum adaptation capacity for climate change is not reached. The concept of the adaptation gap has been discussed in literature, but there has been no consensus on how to study the phenomenon. This is problematic, as the gap leaves people vulnerable to climate change. To decrease vulnerability, and to strengthen our understanding of the gap, this thesis developed a tool that can be used for studying the adaptation gap. The tool illustrates that multi-level governance struggles between institutions can result in an adaptation gap, something I called “the institutional barriers to adaptation”. Resource limitations within institutions can also lead to a gap, which I called “institutional limits”. The developed tool was used to fulfil the thesis main goal: analysing the gap in the Seychelles. Unravelling the adaptation gap in the Seychelles is of vital importance, as it is a first step to closing the gap and decreasing vulnerability. Data collection in the Seychelles was done through semi-structured interviews and the distribution of surveys. Data analysis was done through the use of coding. When comparing theory with the findings in the Seychelles – to also test the applicability of the developed tool and to analyse the completeness of existing literature - this thesis found that the institutional limits- and barriers described in the literature were also present in the Seychelles. Three institutional limits were identified in the Seychelles and literature, being financial-, knowledge- and capacity limits. These limits have put serious constraints on what Seychellois institutions can accomplish regarding climate change adaptation. From multi-level governance literature, 13 institutional barriers were identified, while 16 barriers were found in the Seychelles. These barriers mainly overlap, although new forms of institutional failure were discovered in the Seychelles. These differences between literature and case study findings seem to be based on the specific socio-economic structures of the Seychelles. The linkage to socio-economic structures was also found from a new trend discovery, that illustrates that institutional barriers- and limits are often strongly intertwined. Keywords: the adaptation gap, institutional barriers, institutional limits, multi-level governance, Seychelles, climate change adaptation and climate change impacts"
