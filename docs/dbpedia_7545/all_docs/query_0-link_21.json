For instance, to promote, develop and preserve the Seychellois Creole, the mother tongue of most Seychellois, an institution (the Seychelles Creole Academy) previously known as ‘Lenstiti Kreol’ was established. Delivering quality services and products to all public sectors and to successfully implement the mandate of Creole Institute of Seychelles, the team has to carefully examine areas of weaknesses of all institutions and organisations which provide services to the public; identify strengths in order to build on it and our weaknesses in order to plan strategically and address issues. Consequently, policies with socio-linguistic and linguistic perspectives are critically scrutinized, relevant programmes are developed, implemented, evaluated and improved, with the aim to engage and encourage all citizens to value and benefit from the use of their mother tongue in official situations.
