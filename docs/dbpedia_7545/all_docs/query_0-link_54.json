It gained the status of Crown colony in 1903 and by 1976 became an independent Republic with Sir James Mancham as its first democratically elected President. However in 1977, Mancham was deposed and his then Prime Minister France Albert René became President. Under President René’s leadership Seychelles was a one-party Socialist Republic state. The multi-party system in Seychelles was restored only in the mid-1990’s.\n\nIn 2004, after 27 years as President, France Albert René handed over the presidency to his Vice President Jame Alix Michel. President James Michel was formally elected into office in 2006 and re-elected in 2011.\n\nOf the country’s notable achievements- Seychelles ranks Very High and is first in Africa in terms of Human Development Index (HDI was 0. 806 in 2012)\n\nThe World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators show that in most dimensions of governance (political stability, government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption), Seychelles is above the 50 percentile rank amongst the 212 countries surveyed in 2009. The 2010 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governances shows that between 2008 and 2009, Seychelles improved its score from 77. 0 to 78. 5 (out of 100).\n\nGeography\n\nLocated in the Indian Ocean north-east of Madagascar and 1600 km east of Kenya, the Seychelles archipelago is group of 115 granitic and coralline islands, many of which are uninhabited.\n\nSeychelles has a total area of 455 km² making it the smallest country in Africa. The principal islands are Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue.\n\nThe Amirantes, Farquhar and Aldabra group of islands are corral islands and the UNESCO World Heritage site Aldabra is the world’s largest raised coral atoll.\n\nCoastal temperatures remain fairly constant at about 27°C throughout the year but humidity levels tend to remain high. High winds and extreme weather patterns are rare, however heavy rainfall and flooding have known to occur after tropical storms in the neighboring regions.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn 2012, the population of Seychelles was estimated at 88303. The mainland of Mahe is the most populated with more than 90% of the population living on Mahe and followed by Praslin and La Digue.\n\nThe islands’ history has a notable impact on the island natives. Seychelloise are usually of mixed descent of the original French, African, Indian and Chinese settlers and also include those who have immigrated to the islands.\n\nChristianity is the most predominant religion with nearly 88% Roman Catholics. There are minority religions that practice Hinduism, Islam, Bahai’ and other teachings. The official languages are English, French and Seychellois Creole which has its roots tied to French and other African dialects.\n\nEconomy\n\nAlt text for sample image\n\nThe main pillars of the Seychelles’ economy are tourism and fishing. The tourism sector employs about 30% of the labour force, however global trends play a critical role in the steady influx of visitors. Thus, the Government is encouraging the small population to branch out into other sectors including Offshore banking, farming and small-scale manufacturing.\n\nThe public sector drives the economy and accounts for more than 40% of GDP. The government controls the importation, licensing and distribution of virtually all goods and services and exercises significant control over all sectors of the economy. However, in 2005 and 2006 it implemented several measures aimed at liberalising trade and privatising state-owned entities.\n\nSeychelles exports canned tuna, frozen fish, cinnamon bark, copra and petroleum products. It imports machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products and chemicals. Its major trading partners are United Kingdom, France, Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Africa. The currency of Seychelles is the Seychellois rupee (SCR).\n\nDespite having one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa, Seychelles is vulnerable economically, due to its small size, isolation, limited natural resources and dependence on tourism, which accounts for the bulk of foreign-exchange earnings. Though tourism worldwide grew strongly during the 1990s, and cheaper long-haul flights made destinations such as Seychelles more accessible, the industry became increasingly competitive. Imports needed for tourism were in large part responsible for the country’s trade deficit. GDP grew by 1. 4 per cent p. a. 1979–89.\n\nConsequently, the government made efforts to diversify the economy, encouraging farming, fishing and manufacturing in the whole country including the outer islands. State-owned and parastatal enterprises accounted in the mid-1990s for more than half of GDP and some privatisation of state enterprises was under way during the 1990s. By the late 1990s, there was good growth for several years, and canned tuna became the major export.\n\nBut the economy underwent a small overall decline during 2001–04, before growth strengthened to seven to ten per cent in 2005–07, as a result of increased foreign direct investment and tourism receipts. Then, in 2008, in the teeth of the world economic downturn, the economy stalled and Seychelles turned to the IMF for emergency support. With a sharp fall in tourism income and cuts in public expenditure, GDP shrank by 2. 1 per cent in 2008 and by 1. 1 per cent in 2009. However, in response to economic reforms initiated in late November 2008, in 2010–11 the economy bounced back, with two years of strong growth, followed by good steady growth in 2012–15.\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough visited by Phoenicians, Malays and Arabs, and used in the 16th century by the Portuguese as a stopover point, the Seychelles remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century.\n\nPirates and privateers set up bases on the islands and in 1741 the Governor of Mauritius (then called Île de France) sent Lazare Picault to explore them. The French claimed possession of the islands in 1756 and French settlers from Mauritius, with their African slaves, began to arrive from 1770.\n\nBritish attempts to take possession in the late 18th century were confounded by"
