        "text": "The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country situated in North America. It shares its borders with Canada and Mexico and has access to the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe US is one of the most popular characters in CountryHumans, along with their half-siblings Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDescription\n\nAppearance\n\nThe United States is commonly seen as male. Regardless of gender, they are usually depicted with a black-shirt with the acronym \"NATO\" in white, all caps adorned with blue or black jeans and every shade in-between to match their canton or their shirt with tennis shoes sometimes from famous brands such as Nike, Adidas, Converse, and Vans usually in white, blue, red, or black colors to most people in the fandom. (Instead of NATO being on the shirt, there can also be the logo of NASA; the space organization of the United States.) Another quite common outfit of theirs which is rising in the fandom is America with a green letterman jacket (called a bomber jacket in America) with faux fur lining the hoodie with a black skin-tight latex long shirt with ripped jeans sometimes with pins and stitched on badges added on. Either way they always have sunglasses (frequently taped on if they have a ball head). The frequent glasses has also made some people make America have different eyes in contrast to the other countryhumans, such as T.tazy's AU, where America has pure black eyes due to them not having any culture. If they are drawn with hair it's usually black, blonde, or correlating with their flag.\n\nPersonality\n\nOnce upon a time, the USA just wanted freedom, that's all they ever wanted, they had a strong sense of justice and even if it was a bit wonky, it was a different era, they had always wanted to show everyone that they were a star a beacon of hope and freedom, and having a strong moral drive, they beat the worlds best military at the time with a group of poorly trained, volunteer citizens (minutemen), and even with their spats they love their family, Canada (best siblings), Australia, New Zealand, etc, they love them to death.\n\nUnited States is portrayed as confident/brave (think Tsunami from Wings of Fire) and not afraid to get into messes they don't know they can't handle. They can be loud at times but will tone it down if needed and can be a bit impulsive at times, but their heart is in the right place. They regret their past and has trouble forgiving themselves for what they did, even if everybody else has. In some AUs they can get panic attacks because of this, though this is uncommon.\n\nThey do show love for their family in many fan fictions, or either hate them. Their ‘true colors’ is when they really just want to fit in and is a friendly guy who's confident and happy to help someone in need (some fanfictions portray them as hiding things from their family; with low self-esteem; or just broken mentally/having less that great mental health overall. Some fanfictions portray them as self-harming/suicidal because of the not-so-great things they did in the past, like bombing Imperial Japan), especially protecting them, since they helped stopping WWI and WWII; they believe that they must interfere in the affairs of other countries and their problems in order to keep the peace, sometimes they end up doing harm more than good and end up getting so much hate. However, they're also seen to be from their government/president's view. Meaning, if their government made a choice or speech, they'd be the one to say it or they'd be the one to support it. Despite that, countries still support America, and love them.\n\nBecause of that, relations with Russia, China, and especially their allies are tense. A lot of the world has lost confidence in the 45th president of the U.S. but that isn't with Russia. Europeans are worried about the political system, too. Despite all of that, Americans are still popular worldwide.\n\nUnited States and China tend to get along somewhat, it’s been a tough relationship, and things were only getting tougher when a pandemic came on the hand in 2020. They care a lot on what other people think of them, especially since their image is shaking and is broken. They don't know what to do, they're a world superpower, they needed to fight off China, it was so stressful. The United States is portrayed as tough due to them being a world power. They're also shown exhausted, tired, signing an immense amount of paperwork or reading due to that. (but not as much as Germany has)\n\nThey're proud of their accomplishments yet mostly not portrayed as to show them off too often, they could act insensitive at times, but it's coming from the government more than the country themselves, they still smile about it and glad they accomplished those.\n\nInterests\n\nSports (Basketball, American football, etc.)\n\nFast food\n\nHanging out with other countries\n\nFashion\n\nPlaying video games\n\nAsian pop culture\n\nGuns\n\nNATO & United Nations (and other peace organizations)\n\nCapitalism\n\nTechnology\n\nFlag meaning\n\nColor, meaning HEX RGB White symbolizes purity and innocence #ffffff 255, 255, 255 Red symbolizes hardiness and valor #b22234 178, 34, 52 Blue represents vigilance, perseverance and justice. #3c3b6e 60, 59, 110\n\nThere are 13 red and white stripes in the flag of the USA. These 13 stripes (seven red and six white ones) represent the former Thirteen Colonies. the Red and White stripes alternate. There are 50 stars in the blue rectangle on the top left of the flag. These stars represent the 50 federal states. This has been the official flag since Draft:Hawaii became a member of the union on 21 August 1959.[1]\n\nThe colors red, white, and blue did not have meanings for when it was adopted in 1777. However, the colors in the Great Seal did have specific meanings. Charles Thompson, Secretary of the Continental Congress, reporting to Congress on the Seal, stated:\n\n\"The colors of the pales (the vertical stripes) are those used in the flag of the United States of America; White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valor, and Blue, the color of the Chief (the broad band above the stripes) signifies vigilance, perseverance & justice.\"[2]\n\nFlag Rules: Although the official appearance of the flag has the blue rectangle on the left, when soldiers are wearing it on their uniforms, the flag appears to be reversed. If it looks normal, then they would be in retreat.\n\nCivilians are not required to do this when they are wearing the flag, but it is recommended to do so.\n\nNicknames\n\nAme\n\nJoe\n\nUncle Sam (Government personification)\n\nColumbia (Nation personification)\n\nLady Liberty (Nation personification)\n\n'Murica\n\nU.S.A.\n\nU.S. of A.\n\nU.S. of the A's\n\nThe States\n\nMeri\n\nStars and Stripes\n\nU.S.\n\nUSA\n\nBurger Boy\n\nThe disgrace of Iroquois Confederacy (They are rarely called by this Nickname, It because most people don't know about The Iroquois Confederacy)\n\nOther symbols\n\nOrigins of languages\n\nBy the 18th and 19th centuries, Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and Dutch, brought to the Americas by European settlers and administrators, had become the official or national languages of modern nation-states of the Americas.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe United States, or sometimes United States of America, ect. has one of the simplest etymologies of all countries. United States refers to the 50 states, (or republics if you want to get technical) which joined together, make the country. As the name America states, it is situated in North America. Although all the states have had their sides (Civil War), they have all come together and are leading the United States of America. Each state has their own Governor, like a president, and a mini version of the whole country's government.\n\nThere's really nothing hard about the name.

This event turned the fate of the continent, Europe and the whole world. The colonization of North America began in 1565 with the Spanish colonies in Florida. Then other Europeans began to explore America, including England and France.\n\nIn 1607, the first successful English settlement, Jamestown, was founded on the territory of the future state of Virginia. Before that, England twice tried to colonize the coast of North America, but failed. A more significant and successful settlement was the Plymouth Colony, founded in 1620 in what is now Massachusetts. From its foundation, the purposeful colonization of the American continent by the British began.\n\nThe United States was first known as \"New England\" (depending on your head-canon, United States and New England are different characters).\n\nBy the 17th and 18th centuries, Draft:Thirteen Colonies were formed in what is now the United States: Virginia, Delaware, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\n\nAmerican Revolution\n\nThe American colonials proclaimed \"No taxation without representation.\" starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they had no representatives in the British Parliament. Protests steadily escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in December 1773. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws that effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government. The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts, and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories.\n\nTensions erupted into a battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when King George's redcoats attempted to destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The conflict then developed into a war, during which the Patriots (and later their French allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress which assumed power from the former colonial governments, suppressed Loyalism, and recruited a Continental Army led by General George Washington. The Continental Congress declared King George a tyrant who trampled the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they announced the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.\n\nThe Continental Army forced the redcoats out of Boston in March 1776, but that summer, The British captured Draft:New York City and its strategic harbor, which they held for the duration of The War. The Royal Navy had put blockade on ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to destroy Washington's forces. The Patriots attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775–76 without success, but they captured a British army at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777. France entered The War as an ally of the United States with a large army and navy. The war then moved to the Southern states, where Charles Cornwallis captured an army at Charleston, South Carolina, in early 1780, but they failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. Finally, a combined American and French force captured a second British army at Yorktown in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.\n\nAmong the significant results of the American Revolution was the creation of the United States Constitution, establishing a relatively strong federal national government that included an executive, a national judiciary, and a bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. The American Revolution also resulted in the migration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially British North America ( Canada).\n\nExpansion and Manifest Destiny\n\nWIP\n\nThe American Civil War\n\nIn the 34 States in February 1861, seven Southern slave states were declared by partisans to have seceded from the country, and the Draft:Confederate States of America was organized in rebellion against the United States Constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional States of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from native secessionists fleeing Union authority, but without territory or population therein; these states were given full representation in the Confederate Congress throughout the Civil War. The two remaining slave states, Delaware and Draft:Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to intervention by federal troops.\n\nThe Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years. Intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead, more than the number of United States military deaths in all other wars combined.\n\nThe war effectively ended April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Confederate generals throughout the southern states followed suit, the last surrender on land occurring June 23. Much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially the transportation systems. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million black slaves were freed. During the Reconstruction era that followed the war, national unity was slowly restored, the national government expanded its power, and civil and political rights were granted to freed black slaves through amendments to the Constitution and federal legislation.\n\nReconstruction and Industrialization\n\nWIP\n\nProgressive Era\n\nWIP\n\nWorld War I\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1914, the USA decided to be neutral, acknowledging that this war was conflicts between Old World powers that had nothing to do with them. The public opinion about the war was often divided as there were many migrants with ties to both sides. However, when the Germans sank Lusitania in 1915, a passenger ship with 159 Americans on board, the United States view of the war began to change. It led to the death of 1,198 innocent passengers, including the American ones, so when the United States finally entered the war two years later (in 1917), the cry Remember Lusitania! was used in the recruitment posters and to unite the people against the German Empire.\n\nIn January 1917, the British got a secret telegram (known as Zimmerman Telegram) sent by German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmerman to the German ambassador to Mexico. Where they proposed Mexico's alliance with Germany against the United States, promising them the possibility of acquiring Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The secret telegram was the last straw, as President Woodrow Wilson delivered a speech to Congress on April 2, 1917, asking them to declare war on Germany. They also said in their speech that the United States would go to war for Fighting For The Ultimate Peace Of The World. On April 6, 1917, the United States formally declared war over the German Empire.\n\nThe United States military in was under the command of General John J. Pershing, and at first,they had a few trained troops to send to Europe, though, the Army was quickly built up by project as well as the volunteers. Near the end of the war, there were nearly 2 million American soldiers in France. Thanks to the arrival of the American forces at the right time. The course of the war was diverted in favor of the Allies. Both sides were exhausted and running out of soldiers, but the influx of new forces helped to boost the morale of the Allies and played a crucial role in defeating the German Empire.\n\nAfter entering the war, President Wilson issued their fourteen famous points. These points were their plans for peace and the goals of the United States in entering the war. They were the only leader who publicly announced their goals in this war. Their fourteen points were included in the founding of the Draft:League of Nations that they hoped would help to end the war in the future.\n\nAfter defeating the German Empire, President Wilson pressed their fourteen points for the rest of Europe and the Allies to follow. They wanted all of Europe to recover quickly from the war, including the German Empire, after which both France and the United Kingdom differed and then put severe reparations over the German Empire in the Treaty of Versailles, the United States didn't sign it, but they established their own peace treaty with the German Empire.\n\nInterwar Period\n\nWIP\n\nAfter the end of World War I, there was not much industrial innovation.\n\nOn Tuesday October 29, 1929, also known as Black Tuesday, the stock market crashed causing most to all major banks to loose money and go bankrupt. This was the start of the Great Depression. With the stocks being at the lowest ever at the time.\n\nWorld War II\n\nAt the beginning of the war, the United States didn't want a part of it but, on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor causing the United States to declare war shortly after the declaration of war on Japan. The Third Reich followed suit. On June 6, 1944, is when operation overlord started, also known as D-Day. It is the most significant landing in history, and the United States was a part of it. From December 16, 1944 - January 25, 1945, was the battle of the bulge a significant fight that the United States was a part of. In 1945, an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 9, 3 days, later another Atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, putting an end to the war.\n\nCold War\n\nWIP\n\nModern Era\n\nOklahoma City bombing\n\nWARNING: This section talks about a sensitive topic!\n\nOn April 19, 1995, a bomb was detonated next to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, causing 169 casualties. The bomb was planted by Timothy McVeigh in a rented moving truck, and Terry Nichols, Who helped him build it. McVeigh was later arrested in a car pulled over by a sheriff for no license plate and arrested for possession of a weapon. Nichols was also arrested. McVeigh got a death sentence, and Nichols got a life sentence in jail.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\n\nWARNING: This section talks about a sensitive topic!\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Which today is considered the most deadly terrorist attack in the twenty-first century, with more deaths, not only in the US; but in the world. (2,996 people died, not including all the firefighters that died from cancer/radiation from the debris of the two towers and Pentagon.)\n\nThis incident is triggered by a terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, for which Osama bin Laden takes responsibility. Two Boeing 767's hit the north tower (American Airlines Flight 11 Tail Number: N334AA), and the south tower (United Airlines Flight 175 Tail Number: N612UA), and two Boeing 757's were also hijacked.\n\nOne hit the Pentagon (American Airlines Flight 77 Tail Number: N644AA), and one was successfully retaken by the passengers (United Airlines Flight 93 Tail Number: N591UA). The one that was taken back by the passengers was supposed to hit the White House; the passengers took back the plane and crashed in a field near Diamond T. Mine (a coal mine) in Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The only evidence of them taking back the plane was from the black box. (There were no survivors.)\n\nPolitics\n\nGovernment\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches to make sure no individual or group will have too much power:\n\nLegislative—Makes laws (Congress, comprised of the House of Representatives and Senate)\n\nExecutive—Carries out laws (president, vice president, Cabinet, most federal agencies)\n\nJudicial—Evaluates laws (Supreme Court and other courts)\n\nEach branch of government can change acts of the other branches:\n\nThe president can veto legislation created by Congress and nominates heads of federal agencies.\n\nCongress confirms or rejects the president's nominees and can remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe Justices of the Supreme Court, who can overturn unconstitutional laws, are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThis ability of each branch to respond to the actions of the other branches is called the system of checks and balances.\" [3]\n\nThe Executive Branch consists of the President of the United States, the Vice President, and their cabinet. They are the branch that can create laws, which would pass to the Legislative Branch. The President is the head of state, the government, and the commander in chief for the United States Armed Forces, they have a maximum of two terms, which includes 4 years each. The Legislative Branch is the branch the gets to pass the laws coming from the Executive Branch, they also have the power to accept or deny the nominee to be the head of federal agencies, judges, or the Supreme Court, and has the power to declare war. The Judicial Branch is responsible to interpret laws and see if the law(s) violates the Constitution. They are made of the Supreme Court and many other federal courts, the Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and six associate justices. The Justices have no fixed term and can serve as long as they want until they either die, retire, or remove in other circumstances.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil-United States relations have a long history, characterized by some moments of a remarkable convergence of interests but also by sporadic and critical divergences on sensitive international issues. The United States has increasingly regarded Brazil as a significant power, especially in its role as a stabilizing force and skillful interlocutor in . As a significant political and economic power, Brazil has traditionally preferred to cooperate with the United States on specific issues rather than seeking to develop an all-encompassing, privileged relationship with the United States.\n\nChina\n\nThe United States Department of State tries to maintain the interests of the Chinese public and its government.\n\nHowever, they try their best to get China to stop international law abuses to get into a compromise with the two.[4] 1971 and 1979, the United States did not recognize the legitimacy of the PRC government and supported Taiwan. Public signs of relations with the PRC and the USA started around 1971, with the Ping-Pong diplomacy, where China's ping-pong team invited the U.S. ping-pong team. The United Nations would soon replace the ROC with the PRC within the same year. It wasn't until 1979 that the United States would stop officially recognizing Taiwan and support the One China Policy.\n\nHowever, relations within the unofficial level would still continue for the United States and Taiwan. Their ties would soon be shaken throughout the Belgrade Bombing (as an accident), with the United States apologizing for the mistake, but Chinese protesters dismissed the apology and vandalized American official property in China. Since 2000, the United States and China are starting normalize trading relations, in 2006, China became the second-largest trading partner after Canada. China would also surpass Japan to become the biggest foreign creditor, which means the United States has to return the debt to China at some point. [5]\n\nVenezuela\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAfter the American Revolution had ended, Great Britain did establish relations with the United States. The relations broke when the War of 1812 came to be and declared war on the United Kingdom, but their diplomatic relations would soon be reestablished in 1815. The United States considers the United Kingdom as a close ally, ever since 1815, their bond only gets closer between these two.[6] Visits are very common between these two.\n\nPublic Views\n\nThe People of the United States like the democracy in the nation, but a low percentage suggests that the majority of the people aren't satisfied enough with their democracy. Most Americans also oppose Presidents getting more power, as it is considered \"too risky\" to give them more power to solve the nation's domestic problems. About a third of the country knows that what president is currently serving can make a big difference in their personal lives, whether it be in a good or bad way. Many people have a more favorable opinion towards local politics than national politics, as local politics can help certain problems within their area, and also have much more quality with the candidates than on the candidates for federal elections.[4\n\nAlso, the current president obviously did an election fraud. Apparently, more people in the US had voted for him. Also, the left has absolutely incredibly stupid double-standers!\n\nViews Around The World\n\nAs much as the United States of America has a lot of diversity inside the country, it also has a lot outside. Many countries see them as too power-hungary, crazy, and almost like Adolf Hitler, trying to take over the world. They are also criticized because of the fact that the gap in the public restrooms are so big yeah.\n\nGeography\n\nThe United States is composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million kilometre 2), the United States is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe's 3.9 million square miles (10.1 million kilometer 2(in).

Russians must understand that the American people want to be friends with Russia, the people aren't the government, United States had a complicated relationship since The Soviet Times, over the years, relations have gotten a bit better finally, they're both strong nations, they have embassies in each other's capitals, fight against the virus, terrorism and more, they also fight white supremacy together and their diplomats are working hard to improve their relations.\n\nSpain\n\nSpain is the USA's parent. They enjoy pestering them and calling them \"Mexico\" which is another Spanish-speaking country and another one of their children. They dislike this, but since they're their parent, they're close and they love them as a child. Spain founded St. Augustine, Florida; the first oldest city in the United States. Sometimes, France and Spain compare the personality of the United States with that of England in a derogatory tone. However, both countries celebrate Independence Day with the United States due to the military support granted by both countries. Spain is also the biological parent of Alabama, Florida, Puerto Rico (with UK), and Alaska. Today, the relations between the United States and Spain are one of the firmest, most stable, and optimal in the Western world. Spain is a fan of George Washington. The United States usually remembers Spain whenever they look at a dollar bill. The columns that appear in the dollar symbol are the same as the ones in the shield of Spain.\n\nFrance\n\nFrance is the USA's pibling. Another parent. Sometimes even considered biological parent but, in reality, France is the biological parent of Louisiana, Maine, and Mississippi (with UK). However, even though they're not their actual child, they appear to care for them. France and the United States enjoy teaming up and doing things that the USA's parent (the UK) does not seem to enjoy, which is how they tend to bond. France constantly has to deal with their nibling's French surrender jokes and has hit them with a history book (usually to the head/face) on multiple occasions because of the USA's humor. Them, it's evident that they sees the UK as frenemy rather than a direct enemy. They seem to see France as some sort of parent, possibly as some sort of parental figure. They seem to enjoy each other's company. In addition, the United States usually sees France as a parent figure (Probably, because the United States acquired the republican ideals of France).\n\nAustralia\n\nUSA's nickname for Australia: \"Hell-Spider Man\"\n\nCanada\n\nCanada is the USA's Siblings, although very different from the USA. They's are much more open-minded, although very very very timid and weak. Canada relies on their Siblings to keep them safe (even though they's are older than them) and tends to follow the USA around like a terrified puppy. This does get on USA's nerves, but most of the time they's happy to look after their siblings. (If anyone tries to hurt Canada they face the wrath of USA.) In the real world, the relations of the two countries are one of the firmest, their similar culture is a major factor in guaranteeing that the two have a very stable relationship.\n\nGermany\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil is portrayed in the fandom as a friend and ally towards the United States.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan and File:-Pictogram.png United States shared tense relations in the past. This is because, during the times of the Japanese Empire, United States had atomic bombed Japan. They try to forget the brutality of it, and nowadays, they're better of as friends. The USA thinks of Japan's culture very highly. Though sometimes, they're a little weirded out by Japan's anime obsession. Their relationship is more of a friend-to-friend relations as both see each other as allies and trading partners.\n\nSouth Korea\n\n❝ They're great! My prediction was wrong when i said that the birth of democracy in Korea is the blooming of roses in the trash can. They were the poorest countries, but now they are the richest developed countries. Our people like each other. As long as their sibling and them don’t reunite, we will be on good terms.❞\n\nPhilippines\n\nBoth of the countries see each other as great and major partners and deeply supported each other. They even describe their relationship as a Special Relationship [1]. However, pains from the USA's colonization period of the country are not forgotten, some may consider them and their step-sibling and/or adopted-sibling\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe USA is Malaysia's largest trading partner, while Malaysia is the tenth-largest trading partner. Both of them always join the UN peacekeeping mission together. Malaysia once helped the USA rescue US Ranger that was supposed to rescue the pilot of 2 downed Black Hawk during the Battle of Mogadishu.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nVenezuela\n\nIran\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgian–American relations continue to be very close and encompass multiple areas of bilateral cooperation. As a key U.S. ally in the war on terror, Georgia was the third largest troop contributor in the Iraq War and is currently the largest per-capital contributor to the U.S. led mission in Afghanistan. The United States for its part is actively assisting Georgia in strengthening its state institutions in face of increasing pressure from its northern neighbor Russia and has provided the country with financial assistance in excess of 3 billion dollars since 1991. Since 2009, Georgian–American relations are streamlined by the U.S.–Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, which created four bilateral working groups on priority areas of democracy; defense and security; economic, trade, energy issues, people-to-people and cultural exchanges.\n\nGeorgia in 2004-2008 sought to become a member of NATO, but did not succeed in the face of strong Russian opposition. In February 2012, it was agreed that the U.S. and Georgia will start working on a Free Trade Agreement which, if materialized, will make Georgia the only European country to have such treaty with the United States. American citizens visiting Georgia currently do not require a visa for entry. Citizens will receive a 90-day tourist visa at the country's entry points.\n\nAccording to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 51% of Georgians approve of U.S. leadership, with 15% disapproving and 34% uncertain.\n\nThe United States works closely with Georgia to promote mutual security, counter-terrorism interests and provides Georgia with bilateral security assistance, including English-language and military professional training, through the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program.\n\nThe multi-year Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP) ended in 2004, achieving its intended goals of enhancing Georgia's military capability and stimulating military reform. Launched in January 2005, the Georgia Entertainment and Stability Operations Program has advanced GTEP's goals and trained the Georgian contingent participating in coalition operations in Iraq. Partnership with the Georgia (U.S.) National Guard, visits by the Sixth Fleet, the Coast Guard to Georgia, and the Bilateral Working Group on Defense and Military Cooperation are also important components of American security relationship with Georgia.\n\nPromoting democracy and reform is another strategic pillar of USA's bilateral relationship with Georgia. In April 2006, as part of these reforms Georgia passed a strong anti-human trafficking law and has since then ranked consistently among Tier 1 countries of the State Department's report on trafficking in persons, meaning that the country now fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.\n\nGeorgia hosts 90 Peace Corps Volunteers who work in English Language Education and NGO Development.\n\nGallery\n\nFan-Art\n\nArt by askcountries\n\nArt by eccentrickleptomaniac\n\nArt by Milu\n\nArt by Strawberry birb\n\nArt by nichidokuioji\n\nArt by Coffee Grounds and Mud\n\nArt by backsyoru\n\nAnimation by Amedync\n\nArt by 羟\n\nArt by Osusidaisuko\n\nArt by mikado-art\n\nArt by mrssteier uwu\n\nArt by Swappie\n\nArt by Swappie\n\nArt by Strawberry birb\n\nArt by ElivisZombra150VZ\n\nArt by ElivisZombra150VZ\n\nArt by sarryin\n\nArt by Strawberry birb\n\nArt by starbles-repeater\n\nArt by NTC\n\nArt by\n\nAnimation by AtrixATR\n\nAnimation by AtrixATR\n\nArt by fluffkunist\n\nAnimation by AtrixATR\n\nArt by AtrixATR\n\nArt by AtrixATR\n\nArt by 후야\n\nArt by Strawberry birb\n\nArt by Coffee Grounds and Mud\n\nArt by ReNadu\n\nArt by Cyrin\n\nArt by kingkbossmc\n\nArt by N/A\n\nArt by N/A\n\nArt by Cyrin\n\nArt by goner cat\n\nArt by wasai48144\n\nArt by iroozores\n\nArt by RHA\n\nArt by mr sandmann\n\nArt by mr sandmann\n\nArt by Rippaaaa0728\n\nArt by a_rand0m_trashcan\n\nArt by\n\nArt by Monarchien\n\nAnimation by blu merlin\n\nArt by merlunee\n\nArt by L.Smooke\n\nArt by Ohmowi\n\nArt by Princon\n\nArt by Coffee Grounds and Mud\n\nArt by applecakewey\n\nFlag\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nGreat Seal (obverse)\n\nGreat Seal (Reverse)\n\nPrevious\n\nGrand Union\n\n13 stars v1\n\n13 stars v2\n\n13 stars v3\n\n15 stars v1\n\n15 stars v2\n\n20 stars v1\n\n20 stars v2\n\n21 stars\n\n23 stars\n\n24 stars\n\n25 stars\n\n26 stars v2\n\n27 stars\n\n28 stars\n\n28 stars v1\n\n30 stars\n\n31 stars\n\n33 stars v1\n\n33 stars v2\n\n33 stars v3\n\n33 stars v4\n\n34 stars v1\n\n34 stars v2\n\nCSA battle flag\n\n35 stars v1\n\n35 stars v2\n\n36 stars v1\n\n36 stars v2\n\n37 stars v1\n\n37 stars v2\n\n37 stars v3\n\n38 stars v1\n\n38 stars v2\n\n43 stars\n\n44 stars\n\n45 stars\n\n46 stars\n\n48 stars\n\n49 stars\n\n51 stars\n\nStates and territories\n\nState of Alabama\n\nState of Alaska\n\nState of Draft:Arizona\n\nState of Arkansas\n\nState of California\n\nState of Colorado\n\nState of Connecticut\n\nState of Delaware\n\nState of Florida\n\nState of Georgia\n\nState of Draft:Hawaii\n\nState of Idaho\n\nState of Illinois\n\nState of Draft:Indiana\n\nState of Draft:Iowa\n\nState of Draft:Kansas\n\nState of Kentucky\n\nState of Louisiana\n\nState of Maine\n\nState of Draft:Maryland\n\nState of Massachusetts\n\nState of Michigan\n\nState of Minnesota\n\nState of Mississippi\n\nState of Missouri\n\nState of Montana\n\nState of Nevada\n\nState of Nebraska\n\nState of New Hampshire\n\nState of New Jersey\n\nState of New Mexico\n\nState of New York\n\nState of North Carolina\n\nState of North Dakota\n\nState of Ohio\n\nState of Oklahoma\n\nState of Oregon\n\nState of Pennsylvania\n\nState of Rhode Island\n\nState of South Carolina\n\nState of South Dakota\n\nState of Draft:Tennessee\n\nState of Draft:Texas\n\nState of Utah\n\nState of Vermont\n\nState of Virginia\n\nState of Washington\n\nState of West Virginia\n\nState of Wisconsin\n\nState of Wyoming\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\nGuam\n\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nVirgin Islands of the United States\n\nMidway Islands\n\nWake Island\n\nTerritories that do not have flags\n\nJarvis Island\n\nJohnston Atoll\n\nBaker Island\n\nHowland Island\n\nKingman Reef\n\nNavassa Island\n\nPalmyra Atoll\n\nTrivia\n\nMany countries in Europe, especially the Mediterranean ones, usually advise the United States to avoid ultra-processed food.\n\nThere are 45 million people who speak Spanish as a first/second language in the USA, which makes it the world's second-largest Spanish-speaking country after Mexico.\n\nThe United States of America is also called the USA, US, United States or sometimes America.\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was issued, establishing the United States of America.\n\nThe US is the 4th largest country in the world by land area and 3rd by population.\n\nOn February 25, 2013, the estimated population of the US was 315,568,000.\n\nThe US is a diverse country with a multicultural society.

The shotguns they used were modified versions of the Winchester Model 1897 (other wise known as trench guns or combat shotguns). These guns were very effective at clearing trenches and because of this the Kaiser of the German Empire issued a diplomatic protest, complaining that the trench gun was illegal because in quote “it is especially forbidden to employ arms, projections, or materials calculated to cause unnecessary suffering” as defined in the 1907 Hague Convention. Originally the US government freaked out and almost burned every documentation of a soldier using a trench gun. However at the last minute they remembered that the Germans were using flamethrowers and poison gas in the war. So in return they threatened the Germans that if they were to execute any American soldier that had a trench gun in return the Americans would execute all of their German prisoners.\n\nThe United States is one of the countries on the top 10 list for giving the most foreign aid, yet ranks around the bottom for GNP with only 0.2%\n\nWilliam Taft was the second president to own a car, but he was too over-weight to drive it.\n\nExtra(s)\n\nReligion: Protestantism (48.9%), Roman Catholicism (23.0%), Mormonism (1.8%), Irreligion/Atheist (18.2%), Judaism (2.1%), Islam (0.8%), Other non-Christian religion (2.5%), No response given/Unknown (2.7%)\n\nUrbanization: 81%\n\nSocial Progress Index: 26th in the World\n\nBasic Human Needs: 34th in the World\n\nSocial Opportunities: 16th in the World\n\nHealth and Wellness: 39th in the World\n\nBasic Medical Care: 31st in the world\n\nPersonal Safety: 55th in the world\n\nAccess to Education: 54th in the World\n\nAdvanced Education: 1st in the World\n\nPersonal Freedom: 18th in the World\n\nFreedom of Speech: 29th in the World\n\nTolerance and Inclusion: 32nd in the World\n\nTolerance for Minorities: 80th in the World\n\nTolerance for Homosexuals: 15th in the World (76.6%)\n\nWomen Equality: Medium (37th in the World)\n\nGDP: $20.580 trillion\n\nUnemployment: 3.5% Nationwide\n\nCurrency: US Dollar ($)\n\nTelephones:\n\nMobile Phones: 120%\n\nInternet Users: 75%\n\nAverage Male Height: 5’9 (177 cm)\n\nAverage Female Height: 5’3.5 (162 cm)\n\nReferences\n\nQuora Answer\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_shotgun#History"
