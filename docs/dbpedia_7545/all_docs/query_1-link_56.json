        "text": "Know Your Irregular Demonyms!\n\nA demonym is the adjectival form of a place name used to describe the people from that place. For California, for example, the demonym is Californian. But be warned: Not all demonyms work the way you’d expect. To avoid insult to your foreign visitors, please consult this list of irregular and unusual demonyms.\n\nThe people of Monaco prefer to be called Monagasque.\n\nThe residents of the English town of Manchester are Mancunian.\n\nThose from the island of Cyprus are called Cypriot.\n\nThose from the island of Crete are, unfortunately, Cretans.\n\nIf you’re from the Seychelles, you are Seychellois.\n\nIf you’re from Madagascar, you’re Malagasy.\n\nIf you’re from Halifax, Nova Scotia, you’re Haligonian.\n\nIf you’re from Oxford, England, you’re Oxonian.\n\nTechnically speaking, people who live in the Vatican are Citizens of the Holy See.\n\nCitizens of Barbados are Bajan.\n\nThose living in Mexico City refer to themselves as Capitalinos.\n\nIf you’re from the Belgium region of Wallonia, you’re a Walloon.\n\nWhile the world knows the people of Peru as the Peruvians, they actually prefer to be called the Pervs.\n\nSimilarly, the people of Bhutan are the Booties.\n\nIf you’re from St. Kitts, you’re a Kitty Cat.\n\nThe people who live in Budapest are Budapasta.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the joke about people from Albania being Albinos. In truth, however, they prefer to be called Abba-Zabbas.\n\nThe people of Saskatoon generally prefer to be called the Saskatoodles.\n\nResidents of Chad like to be called by their full name, Chad Ethan Allen Hollingsworth III.\n\nNatives of the German city of Munich prefer the term Munchers.\n\nThose who live in Antarctica just like to be called.\n\nAnd, finally, it’s very impolite to mention the fact that someone is from Fresno, so there is no word for that."
