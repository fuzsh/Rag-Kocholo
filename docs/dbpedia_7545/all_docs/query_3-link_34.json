        "text": "2. How Do You Know The Best Uganda Safari Operator?\n\nUganda has many safari companies/tour operators and can be found on the internet. While planning to take a safari in Uganda, remember to always use a prominent safari company. A recommendable company should have tours related to those you would love to have, a well-detailed website, clear contact, and location details.\n\nA genuine company will always have clear payment methods and be efficient communication. Kabira Safaris & Tours Africa and The Bespoke African Safari Co. meets these requirements and works with partners in the tourism industry such as the Association of Uganda Tour Operators, Africa Tour Operators, and others. Services are tailored according to your preference and therefore the top option for any kind of safari in Uganda.\n\n3. Why Must You Choose Uganda As Your Safari Destination?\n\nUganda has much to offer, the reason it is actually dubbed the Pearl of Africa. In case you are wondering why you should choose Uganda as your next safari destination, then there’s a lot. Just as you arrive in Uganda, the biggest lake on the African continent – Lake Victoria will calm you down with the cool breeze.\n\nWeather in Uganda is pleasant since it’s straddled by the equator line with temperatures at an average of about 22 degrees Celsius year-round. This weather makes safaris perfect most of the time of the year. Even in the rainy season, don’t be surprised to have the day bright and the sun is shining.\n\nGorilla safari in Uganda is the top safari activity with the highest number of habituated mountain gorillas in the country. Other extremely amazing activities include hiking, birding, fishing at Murchison Falls, wildlife tours, and several adventure trips.\n\nEvery kilometer you move in Uganda the scenery changes. The country is scenic and very beautiful to the eyesight. It never gets boring on the long drives with greenery in the background formed by several forests that form 6.3% of the total land area. Fresh fruit will always make your meals tastier. Uganda serves much of fresh foods grown from within the country as well as lots of fruits in the markets and many spots. The pineapples, sweet bananas, papaya, jackfruit, and many more are juicy and must not be missed on your trip.\n\n4. What To See While On Safari in Uganda?\n\nWildlife: Uganda is an African Big Five Wild Game viewing safari destination where the Buffaloes, Elephants, Lions, Leopards, and Rhinos can be seen roaming on the savannah plains. Wildlife Safaris Uganda offers many more wild species with about 330 mammal species. About 7 species are endangered, 17, near threatened, 2 vulnerable, and no more critically endangered species since Mountain Gorilla numbers increased to 1004. Mountain Gorillas and Chimpanzees are also part of the wildlife species found in large numbers within Uganda rather than in any other destination in the African continent.\n\nBirds – Birding tours in Uganda are perfect for avid birders, seasoned birders, groups, families, and solo travelers. Uganda has over 1,065 confirmed bird species distributed all through the borders of the country.\n\nShoebill stork is the sought-after bird species by many of the birders in Uganda. 24 Albertine Rift endemics can also be seen in Uganda and these include the Ruwenzori Batis, Handsome Francolin, and many more. Scenery – Uganda is beautiful, in every kilometer, you move in Uganda the scenery changes. The country is scenic and very beautiful to the eyesight. It never gets boring on the long drives with greenery in the background formed by several forests that form 6.3% of the total land area.\n\nVisit historical and cultural sites – With lots of traditions and cultures, Uganda safaris get amazing when you take a visit to these cultural sites. Some of the sites include the Uganda Museum where you can learn almost all about Uganda. Kasubi tombs also within Kampala is a preservation point for the traditions of the Baganda- a Bantu tribe within the central region. The architecture here is traditional with a touch of the old and original way of construction in the typical African setting.\n\n6. What is the Best Time to Visit Uganda?\n\nBest time could probably be the key to a memorable tour. Many travelers wonder what the best time to visit Uganda could actually be. Uganda is situated along with the equator a fact that makes it have a milder climate and no extreme weather conditions. Average temperatures are about 21 degrees Celsius and may drop to 12 degrees celsius.\n\nYou can visit Uganda throughout the year. However, it depends on where you are visiting since the wet and dry seasons vary. The best time of the year to tour is during the dry season months in the months of June – August, and December to February.\n\nWhy safari Uganda in the dry season? When the rains are less, the trails in the parks are drier and therefore less slippery making driving and hiking very easy. The grass is also short and therefore photography becomes clear and sightings better.\n\nHowever, unlike any other safari destination in Uganda, Kidepo Valley National Park receives one rainy season which is between April-August. This is the best season for other parks and not for Kidepo. The other months of the year are good for visiting the park though December – February can get too hot at times.\n\nMany will tell you the best time of the year to visit Uganda is in the dry season or all throughout the year, but now you can tell why. The country and tour destinations remain open all year throughout and therefore open to tourists though the experience may vary a little.\n\nThe time referred to as the best time is always the peak season and therefore parks and accommodation facilities become congested. This makes visiting during the rainy season more preferable. Accommodation facilities may also offer discounts during the rainy season.\n\n7. How Much Does a Safari Cost in Uganda?\n\nIf you are wondering how much a safari to Uganda may cost, there is no single cost for a trip to the country but here is the highlight of what determines the cost of your safari. The price of the trip is determined by the destinations you choose, some have more and expensive activities than others.\n\nWhere you stay which is the lodge or hotel is a big determinant to the total cost of your trip. Luxury accommodation options will automatically lead to higher costs than budget or Mid-range accommodations. Even in the same class of accommodation, some lodges are more expensive than others, 900 USD could just be for 1 night at some Lodges.\n\nThe number of days you spend on the trip determines how much you will spend. Long Tours in Uganda will definitely be more expensive than short trips. On average you could be spending about 250 USD per person on a single Day trip to Lake Mburo National Park.\n\nThe bigger the group, the less each individual pays for the trip. Solo traveler trips are more expensive than group tours. When the group is bigger, costs are shared and therefore each person could pay much less than the cost of a solo traveler. It is possible to save over 300 USD per person on a shared 3 Days trip.\n\n9. How Unique is Uganda from other Africa Safari Destinations?\n\nWinston Churchill was wowed and named Uganda the Pearl of Africa even before having a Gorilla trekking or Chimpanzee tracking experience. This is because Uganda is an extraordinary safari destination with lots of endemics and friendly people.\n\nHalf of the world’s Mountain Gorillas, the worlds’ most powerful waterfalls, the highest mountain ranges, almost half of Africa’s bird species, the world’s longest river, Africa’s largest freshwater lake, the biggest chimpanzee numbers, and the continents most friendly people are all in Uganda. Surprising how all of these wonders fit in a single country just 236,040 sq. km! this makes Uganda unique and indeed tours to Uganda on top of traveler bucket lists.\n\nOther Africa Safaris Tours /Combined Safari Trips\n\nAfrica has a lot to offer with each destination being unique from the other. Many Uganda safari tourists always tailor their safari in Uganda with Kenya safaris, wildlife safaris in Tanzania, Rwanda Safaris, Congo safaris, and to many other countries.\n\n11. Is the Ugandan Weather Conducive to Tourists?\n\nStraddling the equator, Uganda has no extreme weather conditions or winter and summer conditions, the weather is mild. During the day temperatures range from 24-33°C (52-91°F) during the hottest months and reaching up to 40°C/104°F in the far northern part of the country. It can rain any time of the year and the country doesn’t have extreme weather conditions. For travelers from all over the world, the weather in Uganda is favorable and may not affect so much.\n\nHowever, it is recommended to drink a lot of water during the safari and also carry a brimmed hat. You could easily get sunburns. Depending on the season of the year always carry appropriate safari clothing. Even with the high temperatures, you may need to wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers for protection from brittles. These tips apply for Tanzania safaris as well as safaris in Kenya during game viewing."
