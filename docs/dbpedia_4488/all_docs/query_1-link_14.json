        "text": "An Act to amend certain Acts and to make certain consequential amendments (firearms) (former Bill C-21) is part of the Government of Canada's comprehensive plan to further strengthen gun control in Canada and keep Canadians safe from gun violence.\n\nOn this page\n\nWhat former Bill C-21 is and what it means\n\nHow former Bill C-21 will be implemented\n\nA national freeze on handguns\n\nFirearms classification\n\nBorder security and law enforcement\n\nLicence requirements\n\nHarm reduction measures (including \"Red Flag\" laws)\n\nTemporary licence suspension (\"Yellow Flag\" law)\n\nFunding to address gun violence\n\nWhat former Bill C-21 is and what it means\n\nFormer Bill C-21 received Royal Assent on December 15, 2023. It includes measures to combat gun crime, including codifying the national handgun freeze into law, increasing penalties for firearms smuggling and trafficking, and adding new offences around ghost guns. It also includes new harm reduction measures, including \"Red Flag\" laws and new licence revocation provisions to help address the role of firearms in domestic, intimate partner and gender-based violence and in self-harm.\n\nHow former Bill C-21 will be implemented\n\nPublic Safety Canada is working with federal partners to implement the new measures in phases. Some measures are already in effect, while others will come into effect later to allow time to develop new systems or regulations, or to engage with provinces and territories, Indigenous partners, and stakeholders. Early work is focused on developing the Red Flag Awareness Program, implementing the new licence requirements, and centralizing decision-making for Authorizations to Carry (ATC) for protection of life. More information will be made available in due course.\n\nIn effect now:\n\nNational Handgun Freeze\n\nRestrictions on the sale, purchase, transfer, or import of handguns by individuals (with limited exceptions)\n\nFirearms Classification\n\nNew technical definition of a \"prohibited firearm\" for firearms designed and manufactured on or after December 15, 2023\n\nRepeal of Governor in Council authority to downgrade the classification of restricted or prohibited firearms\n\nAutomatic expiration of a registration certificate if a firearm's classification changes as a result of amendments to a federal act or regulation\n\nAny \"unlawfully manufactured firearm\" (e.g. ghost guns) now defined as a \"prohibited firearm\"\n\nBorder Security and Law Enforcement\n\nIncreased maximum penalties for weapons smuggling/trafficking\n\nNew offences for altering a cartridge magazine to exceed its lawful capacity\n\nAdditional firearms offences eligible for wiretapping\n\nAuthority to stop foreign nationals from entering Canada if they have committed certain firearms offences at the border\n\nNew offence for businesses that promote or depict violence against a person in advertising a firearm\n\nNew offences for possessing or distributing computer data for use in a 3D printer or other system for the purpose of manufacturing or trafficking a firearm or prohibited device\n\nLicence Requirements\n\nNew licence requirement for transferring cartridge magazines\n\nHarm Reduction Measures\n\nAbility for anyone to apply for a temporary Emergency Prohibition Order or Emergency Limitations on Access Order and for the court to protect the applicant's identity, or anyone know to them (\"Red Flag\" laws)\n\nFirearms must be delivered to a peace officer pending legal challenge of a licence revocation\n\nAn individual is authorized to temporarily store their firearm(s) with an appropriately licenced individual or business while they address a mental illness or similar problem\n\nIn effect at a later date:\n\nLicence Requirements\n\nNew licence requirement to transfer certain firearm parts (i.e., firearm barrel or handgun slide) as of September 1, 2024\n\nNew licence requirement to import ammunition, cartridge magazine or certain firearm parts as of September 1, 2024\n\nNew definition of a \"firearm part\" and associated penalties as of September 1, 2024\n\nHarm Reduction Measures\n\nIndividuals subject to a protection order or convicted of domestic violence ineligible for a firearms licence\n\nAutomatic revocation of an individual's firearms licence if they are subject to a protection order\n\nAn individual's firearms licence must be revoked if a Chief Firearms Officer (CFO) reasonably suspects them of domestic violence or stalking\n\nAuthority to issue a licence with conditions to allow for sustenance hunting (in limited circumstances)\n\nTemporary Licence Suspension (\"Yellow Flag\" law)\n\nAn individual's firearms licence must be temporarily suspended if a Chief Firearms Officer reasonably suspects they are no longer eligible\n\nA national freeze on handguns\n\nA national freeze on the sale, purchase or transfer of handguns by individuals within Canada, and on bringing newly acquired handguns into Canada came into force on October 21, 2022. It has since been codified through former Bill C-21.\n\nWhat the freeze means for individuals\n\nIndividuals can no longer acquire handguns in Canada except in the following cases for handguns suitable for their intended purposes:\n\nIndividuals with an Authorization to Carry for lawful profession or occupation, or for protection of life\n\nIndividuals training, competing, or coaching in a handgun shooting discipline that is on the program of the International Olympic Committee or the International Paralympic Committee\n\nThe freeze did not change the classification of handguns. Licensed owners can continue to possess and use their registered handguns for target shooting and collection.\n\nWhat the freeze means for businesses\n\nAuthorized retailers who meet proper storage requirements can continue to import and sell handguns to other businesses (e.g., gunsmiths, museums, valuable goods carriers, retailers, film, and theatrical industry), and to law enforcement, defence personnel and exempted individuals.\n\nWhat the freeze means for importers\n\nImporters should consult Notice to Importers No. 1106 – Importation of restricted handguns into Canada. This notice, issued December 15, 2023, outlines the policies and practices pertaining to the importation of restricted handguns into Canada, following the coming into force of the former Bill C-21.\n\nFirearms classification\n\nFormer Bill C-21 amended the definition of \"prohibited firearm\" in the Criminal Code to add a new category of firearms that meet certain technical criteria. Firearms designed and manufactured on or after December 15, 2023, and that meet the following criteria are prohibited:\n\nA firearm that:\n\nis not a handgun\n\ndischarges centre-fire ammunition in a semi-automatic manner; and\n\nwas originally designed with a detachable cartridge magazine with a capacity of six cartridges or more.\n\nAny \"unlawfully manufactured firearm\" (e.g. ghost guns) is now also defined as a \"prohibited firearm.\" Manufacturing firearms without the appropriate licence issued under the Firearms Act is illegal and individuals can be charged with a criminal offence.\n\nBorder security and law enforcement\n\nTo better combat firearms trafficking and smuggling, and strengthen law enforcement capacity to investigate and prevent firearms violence, former Bill C-21 put in place the following:\n\nIncreases the maximum penalty for certain offences, including firearms trafficking, smuggling and the illegal manufacture of firearms from 10 to 14 years imprisonment\n\nAllows the sharing of certain firearms licence information with law enforcement across Canada to support investigations\n\nExpands the number of firearms offences that are eligible for wiretapping\n\nAdds new offences for possessing or distributing computer data for use in a 3D printer or other system for the purpose of manufacturing or trafficking a firearm or prohibited device\n\nAllows Canada Border Services Officers to stop foreign nationals from entering Canada if they have committed certain firearms offences at the border, such as smuggling\n\nLicence requirements\n\nAs of December 15, 2023, a cartridge magazine may only be transferred (bought, sold or given) to a person if they hold a firearms licence. As of September 1, 2024, ammunition, cartridge magazines and firearms parts (firearm barrel or handgun slide) may be transferred to an individual only if they hold a valid firearm licence. In addition, individuals will need a valid firearms licence to import ammunition, a cartridge magazine or firearm parts (firearm barrel or handgun slide).\n\nHarm reduction measures (including \"Red Flag\" laws)\n\nThe Government is committed to addressing instances of self-harm and domestic, gender-based and intimate partner violence involving firearms.\n\nEmergency Prohibition Orders and Emergency Limitations on Access Orders (\"Red Flag\" laws)\n\nAdding to the protective tools already available, former Bill C-21 amended the Criminal Code to create a new emergency prohibition order and emergency limitations on access order, also known as \"Red Flag\" laws. These new orders will help address situations where an individual poses a safety risk to themselves or others—including people at risk of suicide, and perpetrators of domestic, intimate partner and gender-based violence.\n\n\"Red Flag\" laws are in effect and allow anyone to apply to a court for:\n\nAn emergency prohibition order to remove firearms, for up to 30 days, from someone who may be a danger to themselves or others. Hearings can be set to consider a longer-term prohibition up to 5 years.\n\nAn emergency limitations on access order to set rules for another person's possession or use of firearms if there is a risk that their firearms could be accessed by someone who is already under a prohibition order.\n\nThe application is ex parte, meaning it is made without the knowledge of the person against whom the order is sought, and the hearing is held without the person present. The hearings may also be private. A judge may also seal court documents or remove any information that might identify the person applying.\n\nPublic Safety is working to develop a program to provide more information to victims and supporting organizations on the new \"Red Flag\" laws. It will focus on reaching vulnerable and marginalized groups to ensure these tools are accessible— particularly those who may need them the most.\n\nFor more information see \"Red Flag\" Laws and Preventing Firearm-related Harm.\n\nRed Flag laws do not replace existing tools, such as calling 911 in urgent and life-threatening situations. Law enforcement officers continue to have an essential role in preventing and intervening where there is a risk of firearm violence.\n\nExpanded licence revocation provisions and licence ineligibility\n\nWhen the new rules come into effect, enhanced licence revocation provisions will help protect those in danger from firearms violence in the following instances:\n\nin situations of domestic violence and/or criminal harassment (e.g. stalking); or\n\nwhen a protection order has been issued against a current licence holder.\n\nA firearms licence will not be issued to anyone who at the time of their application, is subject to a protection order or have been convicted of an offence involving the threat or use of violence against an intimate partner or any family member.\n\nTemporary licence suspension (\"Yellow Flag\" law)\n\nFormer Bill C-21 introduces a temporary licence suspension regime under the Firearms Act. This is also known as the \"Yellow Flag\" law. When the law comes into force:\n\nA CFO must temporarily suspend an individual's licence for up to 30 days when they have reasonable grounds to suspect the person is no longer eligible to hold a firearms licence (e.g. suspected of illegally reselling firearms)\n\nDuring the temporary suspension period the licence holder will be allowed to keep their firearm(s), but will not be allowed to use, acquire, or import any firearms. If the licence holder does not follow these restrictions their licence can be revoked\n\nThe individual's use, acquisition and import privileges will be reinstated once the suspension period has elapsed or earlier if the CFO is satisfied that the reasons for suspension no longer exist\n\nAny member of the public may contact a CFO with information about a licence holder if there are concerns related to eligibility or public safety.\n\nFunding to address gun violence\n\nThe Government of Canada continues to invest in initiatives to help address the root causes and ongoing impacts of gun violence.\n\nThe Initiative to Take Action Against Gun and Gang Violence provides funding to the Canada Border Services Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, provinces, territories, and law enforcement to combat gun and gang crime. To support community-led initiatives, the Building Safer Communities Fund helps to educate youth and put an end to gun and gang violence before it starts."
