        "text": "Who else could talk with authority about the record Oscar winning director John Ford but one of his favorite actors, John Wayne. And he does so in his documentary mainly on horseback and at Monument Valley.\n\nThis documentary tells the story of how the trader Harvey Golding set up his shop at Monument Valley to do business with the Navajos who settled there. One day he heard that United Artists looked for a suitable location in Arizona where John Ford was to shoot a Western. Golding went to Hollywood and convinced the studio that Monument Valley was the right place. John Ford subsequently shot eight of his most famous films at the valley, starting with Stagecoach and ending with Cheyenne Autumn."
