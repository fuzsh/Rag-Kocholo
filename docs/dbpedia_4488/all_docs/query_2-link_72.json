        "text": "From DVD Beaver (posted December 2007). — J.R.\n\nThe first John Ford film I can remember seeing, probably encountered around the time I was in first grade, was archetypal: She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949). Apart from its uncommonly vibrant colors, this had just about everything a Ford movie was supposed to have: cavalry changes, drunken brawls, Monument Valley, and such standbys as John Wayne, Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Victor McLaglen, and Ford’s older brother Francis; only Maureen O’Hara and Ward Bond were missing.\n\nFord was one of the very first auteurs I was aware of, along with Cecil B. De Mille, Walt Disney, and Alfred Hitchcock, and what made him especially distinctive was that he was apparently less restricted than the others to a single genre. De Mille made spectaculars, Disney did cartoons, and Hitchcock specialized in thrillers, but a Ford movie could be a western, a war movie, or something else.\n\nThe ten relatively neglected Ford movies I’ve singled out here include a few that still can’t be found on DVD. I might well have selected some others if I’d seen them more recently (I’m currently looking forward to re-seeing the 1945 They Were Expendable, for instance), but I’d none the less argue that all of these are well worth hunting down. Though a few of them are arguably as quintessentially Fordian as She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (and three are honest-to-Pete westerns), most of the others are sufficiently atypical to suggest that Ford is a richer, more complex, and more versatile filmmaker than we usually assume. I’ve also drawn attention in the following remarks to some of the abler Ford commentaries and sources that have helped me find my way through the intricacies of his work.\n\n(NOTE: CLICK ON TITLES, COVERS OR UNDERLINED TEXT FOR LINKS)\n\nThe Long Gray Line (1955). In the recently updated edition of his 1986 book on Ford (which is available only online HERE), Tag Gallagher reports that “The question once came up with Jean-Marie Straub, what is an experimental film? Straub slammed his fist on the table: `The Long Gray Line! That’s an experimental film.’” Well, not exactly — it’s a fictionalized biopic about an Irish-born, not-very-smart-or-especially-capable phys-ed instructor at West Point named Marty Maher (Tyrone Power, playing opposite Maureen O’Hara). It’s also Ford’s first picture in CinemaScope. On one level it’s a patriotic, pro-military sob-fest with corny slapstick that affectionately depicts then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was still a West Point cadet (played, naturally, by Harry Carey Jr.), brimming with the kind of epic schmaltz that Ford has often been faulted for. But it also has the eerie ambivalence of Ford’s richest and most conflicted work, focusing on failure, death, dissolution, and defeat as it’s perceived through an utter mediocrity’s fading memory.\n\n7 Women (1965). Patricia Neal was originally cast in the heroic lead role of Ford’s apocalyptic final feature, which uncharacteristically focuses almost entirely on female characters — as an atheistic, hard-drinking, foul-mouthed doctor in a Chinese mission during the 1930s. But she became ill on her third day of shooting, and was quickly replaced by Anne Bancroft, who does a terrific job. Several critics have compared this character to Ava Gardner’s in Mogambo, and the similarity is evident despite the fact that Bancroft plays a dedicated doctor while Gardner plays a flighty showgirl. An unusual film for Ford, it’s also clearly a very personal one about the collapse of civilization and the sacrifices needed for the survival of society. It was a resounding commercial flop because MGM and most audiences didn’t know what to make of it. It’s certainly more of a shocker than any other Ford film I’ve selected, and the less you know about it in advance, the better.\n\nIn one of the most provocative and original pieces about Ford that I’ve read, by Japanese critic Shigehiko Hasumi HERE, a persuasive, detailed argument is made about the significance of throwing things in Ford’s films, which functions emotionally and thematically (often expressing a character’s solitude) as well as formally. As Hasumi points out, 7 Women ends with a powerful gesture of this kind, and “No other filmmaker has ended his career with such mastery.” But you’ll have to see the movie in order to perceive why and how."
