        "text": "SHARE\n\nWashington DC has enacted some of the strongest gun violence prevention legislation in the nation.\n\nWashington DC requires all guns to be registered and has high standards for the types of guns that can be owned or possessed. Because of this, firearms purchased in DC are rarely used in crimes. In an average year, 154 people die from gun violence in Washington DC. That means someone dies from gun violence every 57 hours. Seven percent of those deaths are gun suicides, and 92% are gun homicides. In Washington DC, the rate of gun deaths increased 142% from 2013 to 2022, compared to a 36% increase nationwide.\n\nWhat Washington DC Does Well\n\nUniversal background checks\n\nGun owner licensing\n\nHandgun dealer licensing\n\nExtreme risk protection orders\n\nMost domestic violence gun laws\n\nAssault weapon restrictions\n\nLarge capacity magazine ban\n\nWaiting Periods\n\nChild access prevention laws\n\nOpen Carry Regulations\n\nStrong concealed carry law\n\nWhat Washington DC Is Missing\n\nMental health record reporting"
