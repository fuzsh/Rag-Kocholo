        "text": "Local Leadership on Gun Violence\n\nIncreased Minimum Sentence\n\nThe Bloomberg administration pushed for and won passage of a new State law increasing the mandatory minimum sentence for possession of a loaded, illegal gun from one year to three and a half years, one of the toughest such laws in the country.\n\nPassed the Nation’s First Gun Offender Registry Act\n\nIn 2006, New York City established a system requiring offenders with gun-related convictions to report as “gun offenders” to the NYPD for four years following the crime. The law was modeled on sex offender registries and has been replicated in cities across the United States including Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.\n\nGun Inventory Law\n\nTo prevent guns from entering the black market, New York City gun dealers were required to examine their inventories every six months, and were required to send a sworn certification of the process to the NYPD.\n\nOut-of-State Firearms Dealers\n\nThe City sued 27 out-of-state firearms dealers who were among the top sources of recovered crime guns. 24 of the dealers agreed to a court monitor of their sales, and the percentage of recovered crime guns sold by those dealers dropped 84%.\n\nInvestigated Private Sellers\n\nThe City led two investigations revealing that 63% of private sellers – both at gun shows and over the internet – agreed to sell a gun to someone who said they probably could not pass a background check.\n\nSeized $40,000 of Illegal Guns\n\nAfter gun dealers sold 40 guns to undercover officers, the NYPD seized more than $40,000 of illegal guns from an illicit Brooklyn gun ring.\n\nOne Gun a Month Law\n\nsales by requiring the seller to confirm that the prospective purchaser had not bought another firearm within the previous 90 days.\n\nGun Buyback Program\n\nMore than 8,200 guns were turned in through New York’s gun buyback programs.\n\nGun Licensing Fee\n\nA Federal appeals court upheld New York City’s gun licensing fee after it was challenged by the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association and the Second Amendment Foundation.\n\nNational Leadership on Gun Violence\n\nCo-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns\n\nCo-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The coalition included more than 1,000 Democratic, Republican and Independent mayors, and 1.5 million grassroots supporters dedicated to common sense gun safety reforms.\n\nShaped National Gun Debate\n\nThe coalition issued a print for action that became the foundation for the Obama Administration’s plan to reduce gun violence.\n\nFounded Independence USA PAC\n\nA political action committee was created to support underdog candidates running against candidates backed by the gun lobby.\n\nAdvertising Campaign\n\nAdvertising campaigns were run to hold elected officials in 13 states accountable for their votes on universal background checks.\n\nIncreased Funding\n\nThe coalition persuaded the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science to increase funding to $50 million to train local law enforcement, improve the NICS background check system, and fund federal prosecutors.\n\nDeveloped Research on Public Health Impacts of Gun Laws\n\nThe coalition developed new research into the public health impacts of dangerous gun laws. Research and reports focused on the gun lobby’s efforts to restrict research and the accessibility of illegal guns through online and private sales.\n\nUniversal Background Check Legislation\n\nMayors Against Illegal Guns helped pass universal background check legislation in states including Connecticut, Colorado, and Delaware. The coalition also won partial legislative victories in New Mexico and Nevada.\n\nFirearms Retail Partnership\n\nThe Mayor’s coalition developed a responsible firearms retail partnership with Wal-Mart Stores to adopt a ten point gun sale safety code, including employee responsibility training, videotaping point of sale transactions, and signing a purchaser declaration.\n\nRepealing the Tiahrt Amendments\n\nThe coalition led the effort to repeal the Tiahrt Amendments that prevent local law enforcement from accessing gun trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nDefeated “Reciprocity” Legislation\n\nThe coalition helped defeat NRA-supported “reciprocity” legislation that would have undermined States’ gun laws by allowing citizens with concealed carry permits in their home states to legally carry their concealed firearms in other states, even if the other states have higher standards for such permits.\n\nTracked Illegal Sale of Long Guns\n\nThe coalition persuaded the Obama Administration to track the illegal sale of long guns in the four states bordering Mexico, where gun trafficking is a major problem.\n\nFix Gun Checks and No More Names National Drives\n\nThe coalition launched two national tours that garnered support for common-sense background checks on all gun sales.\n\nSecond Chance on Shoot First Campaign\n\nThe coalition launched the Second Chance on Shoot First campaign to fight “shoot first” laws that have led to a dramatic increase in “justified homicides” in Florida and 25 other states."
