        "text": "The communicative space of the Latin speakers discussed in this volume extended over the whole of the civilized world as they understood it. This communicative space is what has recently been called the “Neo- Latin World”, those parts of Europe (and the Americas) where there existed a stratum of society capable of producing and/or reading and appreciating works in Latin. The communities that the writers in this volume expressed allegiance to were quite different from each other, and the importance of Latin and the reasons for using it varied no less. Firstly, Latin was the prestige language of Italian humanists and later intellectuals; their linguistic identity and the adherent value system were important aspects of how they positioned themselves in society. Secondly, from the sixteenth century onwards, the fact that Latin (more than other European languages) allowed communication across political and linguistic borders became more and more important. The combination of these two functions was an ongoing process of renegotiation, and outcomes were as varied as the situations they proceeded from: no one other language could match the versatility of Latin for the diverse needs of early modern European society.\n\nThis paper analyses the construction of national, religious and cultural identity in Latin poetry from the time of the Great Northern War (1700‒1721). Neo-Latin poets from the remote regions of Scandinavia and Peter the Great’s Russia considered poetry a powerful propaganda medium and composed verses in Latin to construct a number of identities. The two authors chosen for this analysis, Magnus Rönnow (1665?‒1735), a Swedish poet, and Feofan Prokopovich (1681‒1736), a Ukrainian poet in the service of the Russian court, imitated ancient poetry in a most creative way to serve both their own needs as individual writers and the ideologies of the fledgling nation-states of Sweden and Russia respectively. Four case studies will demonstrate how Latin verses promulgated nationalist propaganda, and how their authors at the same time manifested their own humanist training and claimed a place in the prestigious respublica litterarum. These texts also reveal the authors’ transparent awareness that their decision to write in Latin was one of the best ways to demonstrate that their country was truly European, and thus belonging to the civilised world. Lastly, the paper discusses the apparent literary interaction between these poets.\n\nThis introduction sets the scene for six essays devoted to the study of the discourse of Latin. Despite the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century, Latin remained the dominant code of communication in European society for a millennium. And yet in the minds of many of its most prolific users and commentators, it has experienced a continuous cycle of existential crises. After multiple reappraisals and re-fashionings of Latinity in the early and high Middle Ages, the self-conscious definition of language and its relationship to culture which arose in fourteenth-century Italy led to the bestowal of the much-controverted title of \"renaissance\" on the ensuing age. But, with respect to Latinity, was (and is) this label a distinction without a difference? Not only in the Quattrocento, but also in earlier and later eras, cultivating \"good Latin\", however this was defined, and indeed being seen to cultivate it were matters of the utmost importance, an inexhaustible wellspring of sociocultural capital. Our object here is to study the language of the language itself: the value attributed to Latin, its standing vis-à-vis other languages, the qualities linked with it, and the issues in which it was implicated. Our remit is Latinity after Antiquity, and the six essays which follow range from late antique North Africa to nineteenth-century Hungary.\n\nThe thesis explores the so-called Living Latin movement, which believes that Latin should recover at least some of its communicational function and that the active use of it in communication and in teaching is worthwhile. The beginning of this ongoing movement is seen in the end of the 19th century, when the first general-purpose journals advocating for Latin as an international language appeared. The cultural roots of the value of speaking Latin are explored from the Renaissance, revealing an ever-present tension in the Latin tradition where on the one hand the language was used for many communicational aims, but on the other hand the authority of the classical models and the concern for the purity of the language encouraged a caution in the use of the language. The cultural and historical contexts giving rise to this movement are explored. In case of the end of the 19th century, one of the primary factors was the ever-present discussion of the international language question; among the other factors, the contemporary movement for reforming the teaching of the (modern) languages away from the grammar-translation method also played a role. In the Interwar period the different cultural environments are explored, concentrating on the case of Fascist Italy, which had an ambition to restore the international use of Latin. In the post-World War II Europe, the emerging new world order and the European integration movement contributed to another attempt of Latin universalism, when official organisations were formed aiming to make Latin an international language: Vita Latina and Academia Latinitati Fovendae. After exploring some of their internal politics and the changing position of Latin in the world, I turn to the so-called Enthusiast Latin movement, which, while the institutional positions of Latin were deteriorating worldwide, has been persevering in using Latin as an alternative supranational language and expanding its use to new fields (e.g., immersive summer schools; radio news; today the Internet). Taken together, these movements embody a particular conviction in the continuing vitality and universality of Latin, presenting themselves as an authentic continuation of the perennial Latin tradition reconciled with modernity. The study shows that the Living Latin movement has been both a product of the times (starting from the particular milieu of the end of the 19th century) and a continuation of certain tendencies in the Latin tradition since the Renaissance, all driven by a conviction in the universality of Latin capable of uniting the learned of today both between themselves and with the thinkers of the past."
