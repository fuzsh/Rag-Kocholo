        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nI. Nature and Probable Origin\n\nTHE ANONYMOUS Excidium Troiae (ET), contained in three known manuscripts,1 may conveniently be divided, with regard to its content, into three parts.2 The first part, which makes up a little less than one fourth of the text, contains a classical version of the Trojan War beginning with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and culminating in the death of Achilles. The second part relates the fall of Troy as narrated by Virgil, and gives a detailed summary of the wanderings of Aeneas, taken from the same source. In the final portion, which is extremely brief, there is presented an account of the founding of Rome and something of its early history. Thus the complete text consists of a continuous narrative of Troy and Rome from the casting of the golden apple to the reign of Augustus Caesar. The account is written in a fairly simple variety of vulgar Latin of the early mediaeval period; the organic unity of the piece and the recurrence of certain stylistic peculiarities mark the whole narrative as a single composition. The earliest extant manuscript known to us dates from the end of the ninth century;3 but even this text seems a considerable distance from the original—at many points further than the later manuscripts. In numerous instances the three manuscripts show the same corruptions in phraseology, as well as the same accumulation of glosses and even titles of illustrations, which must have been inherited from earlier exemplars. But even the many scribal accretions seem hardly sufficient to account for the present state of the text. The entire composition appears to be a rewritten version of an earlier Latin handbook, rather than an original mediaeval product. Indications of a classical origin are to be found through the entire text—both in the narrative of Troy and in the summary of Virgil.\n\nThe Troy story shows no relation whatever to the accounts of Dares and Dictys,4 from which the great body of mediaeval Troy literature was derived. Instead, it presents a more classical sequence of events, which agrees fairly closely with the ancient Greek epic. The history opens with an account of the Nereid Thetis. She had been loved by Jupiter, who would have accomplished a union with her but for the prophecy that if a son were born to them he would dethrone his father. Jupiter therefore arranges her marriage to Peleus and gives a wedding\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xii ]]\n\nfeast, to which he invites a number of gods and goddesses. Discordia, enraged at not being asked to attend, duly casts the golden apple and brings about great strife among the three goddesses, who are sent to Paris to be judged. An account is then given of Paris: Hecuba, before his birth, had dreamed that she bore a firebrand which burned Troy to the ground. Because of this evil omen Paris was exposed in the mountains, and was found and reared by a herdsman. He had won a reputation for great justice because of his fairness as referee in fights between the bulls. Paris decides the contest in favor of Venus, and later goes to Troy in company with his foster-father the shepherd, where he defeats his brothers in the athletic contests. They plan to kill him, but are prevented by the shepherd, who reveals Paris’ identity. He remains in Troy, and is later sent on an expedition to Greece for the purpose of recovering his aunt Hesione, who had been carried away by the Greeks. He abducts the all-too-willing Helen, whereupon the Greeks prepare for war. On being told that Troy can be won only by the help of Achilles, Agamemnon organizes a search; Odysseus and Diomedes find him among the virgins at the court of King Licomedes. The story reverts to Thetis, and the youth of Achilles is told: his bath in the Styx, his life with Chiron, his life with Licomedes and his love for Deidamia. The account of the actual fighting is extremely brief but essentially Homeric: Achilles loves Briseis, and on being deprived of her sulks in his tent until Patroclus is killed, after which he avenges his friend by slaying Hector and dragging his corpse. As a condition for the relinquishing of Hector’s body, Achilles obtains Polyxena in marriage. She, at the instigation of her parents, learns about and makes known the vulnerable spot of her husband. Achilles is invited to the temple, and Paris, from behind the statue of Apollo, shoots him in the heel with a poisoned arrow. Ajax recovers his body, which is given great honors. At the advice of the gods Pyrrhus is fetched from the court of Licomedes, and he arrives in the Greek camp intent on avenging his father. At this point the author takes up the Virgilian narrative of the taking of Troy, and continues with the story of Aeneas’ wanderings.\n\nIt will become apparent that this history represents a distinct version of the Troy story and not a piecing together of events from classical sources; and it will likewise be seen that the account could hardly have been originated by the mediaeval writer of the extant version. In order to produce such a work it would have been necessary for him to make up a complete history, classical in plan and order, from such Latin authors as Ovid, Statius, ‘Pindarus Thebanus,’ Hyginus, the ‘Vatican\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xiii ]]\n\nMythographers,’ Servius, and others. So widely scattered is the information in most of these accounts that it is difficult indeed to conceive of its combination in a reasonably sequential order by the writer of a vulgar Latin text so obviously lacking in scholarship.\n\nMost of the story, to be sure, finds parallels in classical Latin sources; yet these parallels are not of such a nature that we can regard them as sources. Hyginus,5 for example, gives an account of the wedding feast, but he fails to mention the inscription on Discordia’s apple or the fact that the apple was of gold; while Ovid’s account of Paris6 omits Discordia and the apple entirely. Moreover, the order of events could surely not have come from those sources.7 It is remarkable that ET makes the starting point of the story the love of Jupiter for Thetis and the prophecy which prevents their union—a circumstance corresponding to the beginning of the ancient epic account contained in the Cypria.8 The account of Hecuba’s sinister dream agrees rather closely with that of Ovid;9 yet Ovid does not connect the episode with Paris’ exposure and subsequent life as a shepherd. The youth of Paris is told briefly in Hyginus;10 yet ET disagrees with Hyginus and agrees with Apollodorus of Athens11 in having Paris sent to be exposed rather than having him sent to his death by Priam and later spared by the servants. For the long account of Paris’ defeat of his brothers in the athletic contests it would have been necessary to expand the brief note in Servius.12 The account of Achilles corresponds in a general way to Statius, yet there are almost unquestionable indications that the story was not drawn from the Achilleid,—at least, not in its entirety. In the first place, the name Odisseus is used, whereas Statius always uses Ulixes.13 Further, ET is more complete than Statius in telling of Achilles’ vulnerable heel where he is later shot by Paris—a detail which corresponds to Servius and Hyginus.14 Yet ET proceeds to disagree radically with both accounts in the manner of Achilles’ death, telling us that he had married Polyxena and that she had revealed his vulnerable spot. Even if all details could have had their origin in extant Latin accounts, it is utterly impossible to suppose an unlearned mediaeval writer capable of selecting and arranging this scattered information in a simple, connected narrative agreeing so closely with the ancient Epic Cycle. We are forced to conclude that ET’s Trojan story is a redaction of a considerably older Latin chronicle of the Trojan War which originated in classical times. The notes following the text, in which a full account of the classical sources and analogues is given, will furnish further evidence to support this conclusion.\n\nWe find this evidence of an earlier origin not only in the Trojan history\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xiv ]]\n\nbut in the reworking of Virgil as well. The mixture of learning and ignorance, of skill and ineptitude, which meets us on every page seems to indicate at least two stages of composition: one a simple yet not ignorant summary of the Aeneid which originated in an earlier and more scholarly period; the other a mediaeval redaction of this story with some additions, including some corrupted and malapropos quotations from Virgil. The author of the original version must have had a considerable knowledge of ancient legends, as well as a good understanding of Virgil. He knew, for example, that it was Iuturna who wounded Aeneas when he came to swear his oaths to Turnus, whereas Virgil only hints indirectly that it was she.15 He knew of the sacrifice of Polyxena at the grave of Achilles, to which Virgil alludes very obscurely,16 and he gives additional information about the blinding of Polyphemus by Ulixes, ‘qui alio vocabulo Odisseus nuncupatur’ (23, 16-17). The knowledge shown throughout is not at all consistent with the bungling which is so common in the present version, and it seems quite justifiable to presuppose the existence of an earlier version from which our mediaeval redaction had its origin.\n\nEvidence of reworking is also to be found in the occasionally traceable omissions of original material and additions of new material. A very patent omission is to be observed, for example, in the passage in which the three goddesses request Jupiter to decide their dispute (3, 21-26).\n\nAs W. A. Oldfather remarks, ‘Before Quibus [3, 24] some inquiry as to who the judge should be, has obviously been omitted by the redactor.’17 As for unoriginal material, the most obvious additions are in the form of quotations from the Aeneid. Such are the lines dragged in as a commentary on the judgment of Paris: ‘Manet alta mente repositum . . . ,’ etc. (5, 11-13).18\n\nA further discussion of the spurious quotations will follow (pp. lix-lx); it is sufficient here but to mention them as additional evidence of rewriting.\n\nIndication of an earlier origin is also to be observed in the language and vocabulary of the whole composition.19 There is a distinct residue of pedantry which it would be difficult to assign to the naïve author of the present text, yet which is quite typical of the end of the classical period.20 The rather frequent Greek words and forms seem to be entirely out of keeping with the unlearned mediaeval Latin in which our version is written. Examples are the use of the name ‘Odisseus’ (9, 21; 10, 4; 23, 17, etc.), and of such Greek accusatives as ‘Andromachen’ (24, 16). And we have ‘Et passus manian se armavit . . .’ (18, 9) and\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xv ]]\n\n‘Mercurius in acra Carthaginis venit . . .’ (36, 6), both of which are pure Greek. There are other uncommon Greek loan-words, as ‘parthenos’ (9, 20), and some learned and unusual words, such as ‘comperendinavit’ (4, 26), ‘remanded to the third day,’21 and ‘malaginavit’ (52, 24), from malaginum, a medical term denoting a kind of salve made without fire.\n\nAn attempt to date the original version exactly from these remnants of an earlier vocabulary would probably be unsuccessful,22 and it is sufficient to point out that the most likely period for the composition of such a work was that of the great commentators—from the fourth to the sixth centuries A.D.23 The mannerism of asking questions and then answering them is characteristic of Servius and his age,24 and the method of explaining and justifying a mythological statement is distinctly reminiscent of Macrobius. Examples of such explanations in ET may be found on pp. 39, 11-13 and 45, 16-17. The latter passage may be compared with Macrobius’ statement about Mezentius: ‘Ergo quod diuinos honores sibi exegerat, merito dictus est a Vergilio contemptor deorum’25—although the explanation itself is different.\n\nWhatever the date of the original story, we may suppose that it goes back to late classical times and that it was written by a mythographer who knew something of ancient legends. At a later period the entire work was rewritten; but the date and place of the redaction are at present impossible to determine. According to Oldfather,26 certain locutions suggest very strongly that the redactor was French. The regular use of the comparative for the superlative is typical of French usage, although the idiom was Spanish as well, and must have been known fairly early in mediaeval Latin. Examples are the inscription on the golden apple: ‘pulchriori dee donum’ (3, 17);27 Venus’ promise ‘Ego tibi dabo pulchriorem uxorem’ (5, 6); and the statement ‘potentior omnibus [Ciclopibus] Polifemus fuit’ (23, 26). What may likewise be a Gallicism is the use of in to mean ‘in the likeness of’: ‘in Arpalice’ (34, 25), ‘in Martem’ (35, 2), and possibly ‘in parthenos’ (9, 20).28 This is somewhat stronger than the classical meaning, ‘as’ (in uxorem, etc.); but similar meanings are to be observed in Old and Middle French and Provençal.29\n\nET, we may say in summary, is a thoroughly rewritten version of a not unlearned narrative produced in late classical times, drawn from Virgil and some additional material relating the downfall of Troy. As for the sources which the original author used in addition to the Aeneid, it will be impossible to state a final conclusion. It seems highly unlikely that ET’s story of the Trojan War could have been pieced together from\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xvi ]]\n\nsuch extant Latin accounts as those of Ovid, Hyginus, Statius, Servius, and the Vatican Mythographers, for the reasons indicated above (pp. xii f.): there are no extended parallels to those accounts, i.e., no parallels which run through more than a very short portion of the story. ET, moreover, contains certain episodes which are organically connected with the narrative and which have no equivalent in extant classical sources—episodes such as Mars’ encounter with Paris’ bull, and the contest of Paris and his brothers in the stadium.30\n\nAs in the case of Dares and Dictys,31 there is to be considered the question of a Greek original for our version of the Trojan War. That this material is of ultimate Greek origin can hardly be denied, considering the close resemblance of ET to the Greek Epic Cycle of antiquity. It is, in fact, at least possible that the original author of the Latin version drew his account directly from a Greek source (or sources). Although the question cannot now be finally decided, the available evidence can be summarized.\n\nFirst it should be pointed out that there is little evidence—and certainly no proof—that the author of our account of Troy drew directly from any extant Latin source other than Virgil.32 Even such widely used sources as Ovid cannot be shown to have influenced the author of ET.\n\nOn the whole, our narrative shows greater similarity to extant Greek accounts than to Latin ones. Even in some of the colloquial passages (where one would expect originality) there are definite parallels to some of the late Greek Troy narratives. Paris’ conversation with Helen (8, 8 ff.) shows remarkable similarity to a corresponding passage in Colluthus, while Sinon’s proposed deceit of the Trojans (14, 10 ff.) parallels a scene in Quintus of Smyrna. This resemblance to Greek accounts is likewise to be observed in the short history of Rome which follows the account of Aeneas. Rather than follow the most common Latin source, Livy, our version bears a closer resemblance to the accounts of Dio, Plutarch, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus.33 Although it is doubtful whether any of these accounts can be considered as a direct source, this seeming preference for Greek material might give some weight to the idea that the author had access to a no longer extant Greek chronicle of the Trojan War—some highly simplified and popularized epitome of the ancient cycle.\n\nFinally, there is the very noticeable Greek flavor in the language of ET, some of which might be construed as indicative of the use of Greek source material. A number of Greek loan-words may be listed, including some uncommon ones:\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xvii ]]\n\nP. 6, 11 ‘agonem.’ Known to Classical Latin at least from Pliny on. But in the phrase ‘agonem populi,’ the meaning is clearly ‘throng’ or ‘assembly’—an ancient Greek meaning not recorded in Thes. Ling. Lat.\n\n9, 20 ‘parthenos.’ Unknown to CL. Note that in our text the word is not declined.\n\n9, 21 ‘Odisseus.’ This form is used except where the story follows the Aeneid—there Ulixes is substituted.\n\n12, 4 ‘trutina.’ CL at least from Varro on.\n\n18, 9 ‘manian.’ Occurs in Cicero and in later glosses; but is clearly regarded as a foreign word.\n\n17, 5 ‘lampadibus.’ CL from Plautus on.\n\n19, 17, etc. ‘zaba.’ Apparently from Arabic; not in CL or CG. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon, quotes examples from 565 A.D., 607, 911, etc. In Du Cange.\n\n12, 30 ‘thura.’ CL from Plautus on.\n\n33, 22 ‘fialas.’ CL from Juvenal on.\n\n36, 6 Ra ‘acra.’ CL only in proper name in Pliny.\n\n11, 12, etc. ‘monomachia.’ Common in post-classical L.\n\nLikewise some case forms should be observed:\n\nP. 9, 9 L ‘Pariden.’\n\n18, 9 L Ra ‘manian.’\n\n24, 16 L Ra ‘Andromachen.’\n\n34, 24 L ‘Enean.’\n\nTo adduce all these examples as evidence of Greek source material would be absurd, since many of them occur in that part of the narrative which is taken from the Aeneid. Indeed, some (e. g., ‘Pariden,’ ‘Enean’), may be mere scribal flourishes, since the scribe of L seems to have had some superficial Greek.34 Most of those which survive from the original author may be taken to mean merely that he had a knowledge of Greek,35 and (as Oldfather points out36) that he was a man of considerable pedantry. Yet this pedantry is of a singularly artless sort; we find none of the rhetorical complications, the piling up of citations, or the pseudocritical evaluation of sources so common in those Latin writers who attempt to give the impression of great learning. Indeed, a few of the Grecisms which occur in the narrative of the Trojan War are difficult to account for as mere pedantry, and might very conceivably be survivals from a Greek original. The use of ‘agonem’37 with a Greek meaning, in violation of common Latin usage, seems hardly natural to one who is telling a plain story in idiomatic Latin; yet it is the kind of mistake which a translator or redactor might easily make. ‘Parthenos’ likewise seems a strange substitution for virgo unless the author merely carried over a\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xviii ]]\n\nword which he found in his source.38 But probably the most significant of the Grecisms is the name ‘Odisseus,’ which is almost never to be found in other Latin works. Throughout that part of ET which relates the Trojan War, this form is consistently used. In the portion drawn from Virgil, on the other hand, the name regularly appears as ‘Ulixes.’ What is even more striking, in a digression concerning Ulixes and the Cyclops, in which the author departs from the Aeneid, the name ‘Odisseus’ is again substituted (23, 17). The natural conclusion would be that the author is merely following his source in writing one form or the other. Considering the rarity of Odisseus in Latin, there is at least a strong suggestion that this earlier source was a Greek one.\n\nSince the evidence is inconclusive, the whole question of ultimate sources must for the present be left open. The text as we now have it has come through a long period of wretched transmission; its ultimate date and origin can only be a matter of conjecture, since the narrative preserves some elements of great antiquity.39 It should be observed that ET in its original Latin form was almost certainly intended as a handbook for the instruction of the young. The extreme simplicity of the narrative, and the frequent repetitions give definite evidence of a pedagogical intent. Moreover, there occurs with great frequency a question-and-answer formula undoubtedly designed to drill the students of classic legend: ‘Et dicere habes: qui fuit Paris . . . ?’ etc. (3, 27). The entire work, as we have seen, underwent a thorough mediaevalizing at the hands of a redactor; it accumulated some incorrect and inappropriate quotations as well as some naive glosses and some amazing scribal corruptions before it came down to us in its present form.\n\nNOTES TO SECTION I\n\n[1] Oxford, Bodleian Library, Rawlinson D 893 (Ra); Florence, Bibl. Riccardiana 881 (Ri); Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana LXVI, 40 (L). The earliest of these is L, dating from the end of the ninth century. For a full discussion of the MSS, see below, pp. lxxvii ff.\n\n[2] It is doubtful whether the original version made any divisions in the story. The scribes of L and Ra do not divide the text; the name ‘Excidium Troiae’ occurs at the beginning of L and at the end of Ra. The scribe of Ri designates the Virgilian narrative as ‘Liber Eneydum’—certainly a conventional mediaeval name, but one which was probably not in the original, since the incipit does not occur at the point where the Virgilian material first begins. See below, p. 20, 6-8.\n\n[3] For a full account of this MS see E. A. Lowe, Scriptura Beneventana (Oxford, 1929), Plate xxv.\n\n[4] Gorra, after an apparently hasty examination of Ri, concluded that the story was based on Dictys. A close study of ET gives no support whatever to this opinion, although there are of course some parallels. See Egidio Gorra, Testi Inediti di Storia Trojana (Turin, 1887), pp. 242-243.

At some points it seems necessary to assume that the original story has been condensed. One indication of such treatment is to be found in the story of Paris’ pretense of being a merchant when he arrives at Menelaus’ kingdom. See pp. xxxi; xxxiii.\n\n[18] Cf. Aen., i, 26-28.\n\n[19] For further discussion of the Greek element, see below, pp. xvi ff.\n\n[20] See Oldfather, op. cit., p. 273. The redactor, he says, ‘was an ignorant fellow, and . . . the author was unusually pedantic.’\n\n[21] The unusual nature of this word is strongly indicated by its treatment in the MSS (see below, p. 4, 26). The corrector of Ra makes the marginal substitution ‘procrastinavit’; the scribe of Ri doctors the passage to read ‘competenter ordinavit.’\n\n[22] Oldfather points out that the use of the word casa to mean ‘the royal box in the circus’ is known to the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae only from Corippus (end of the sixth century), and the meaning may have been current only in that period. It hardly seems necessary to conclude, however, that the author of ET modelled his use of the word on Corippus. See Oldfather, op. cit., pp. 273, 275. The use of eicere with the meaning of ‘lead out’ or ‘bring out’ (see below, p. xx, n. 35) was common between the second and fifth centuries (to judge from the examples in Thes. Ling. Lat.). That the meaning was current in the Middle Ages seems improbable: it is not recorded in Du Cange; and the combination ‘fuisse eiectam’ (9, 5), ‘to have been led out,’ was obviously not understood by the scribes, who made various alterations. The Greek zaba appears only from 565 A.D.; see E A. Sophocles, Geek Lexicon of the Roman and Byzantine Periods (Cambridge, Mass., 1914). But the word was cormmon in mediaeval Latin and may have been introduced by the redactor.\n\n[23] This was also the period of the two most popular summarizers of Trojan history, Dares and Dictys.\n\n[24] See D. Comparetti, Virgilio nel Medio Evo (2 vols., Florence, 1896), i, 76 f.; also F. A. Wright and T. A. Sinclair, A History of Later Latin Literature (New York, 1931), Part I, passim.\n\n[25] Macrobius, Saturnalia (ed. F. Eyssenhardt, Leipzig, 1893), iii, 5, 11.\n\n[26] Op. cit., p. 273.\n\n[27] Other Latin accounts besides ET used the comparative form in this inscription; the Compendium Historiae Troianae-Romanae has ‘pulcriori debetur’; in the General Estoria of Alfonso el Sabio and in the anonymous Istorietta Troiana the inscription reads ‘pulchriori detur’—evidently quoted from\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xx ]]\n\na mediaeval Latin account bearing some relation to ET. For discussion and citations see below, p. xlii. On the golden apple and its various inscriptions see also A. G. Solalinde, ‘El Juicio de Paris en el “Alexandre” y en la “General Estoria,” ’ Revista de Filología Española, xv (1928), 7-8.\n\n[28] See below, p. xvii and p. xx, n. 38.\n\n[29] See the note to p. 9, 20 below.\n\n[30] These episodes are analyzed in section IV below.\n\n[31] The discovery of a Greek original for Dictys adds weight to the supposition that Dares also was derived from a Greek source; but the question has not been finally decided. See, among others, G. Körting, Dictys und Dares (Halle, 1871); N. E. Griffin, Dares and Dictys (Baltimore, 1907) and ‘The Greek Dictys,’ Amer. Journ. Phil., xxix (1908), 329-335.\n\n[32] The best case could probably be made out for the Achilleid of Statius, in the episode of the discovery of Achilles. Yet even here, as has been shown on p. xiii, there are some considerations which make it difficult to consider Statius a direct source.\n\n[33] See below, p. lxxii. The use of Greek source material on Roman history was not uncommon at the end of the classical period; one need but recall Jerome’s Roman chronicle, which was drawn mostly from Eusebius. That Greek material might conveniently be combined with the Aeneid appears clearly in the fourth or fifth century work Origo Gentis Romanae, in which the author supplements Virgil by means of excerpts from Dionysius and others. Ed. Hermann Peter, Berichte der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig, Phil.-Hist. Klasse, lxiv (1912), 71-165.\n\n[34] See E. A. Lowe, Scriptura Beneventana, Plate xxv.\n\n[35] Some of the idioms in ET parallel similar usages in late Greek, although they are by no means to be explained as pure Grecisms. A few of these are especially common in the Itala and Vulgate translations of the Bible, although certainly not confined to such works. Among these is the very frequent use of the present participle in such combinations as ‘respondit dicens,’ ‘mandavit dicens,’ ‘alloquitur dicens,’ etc., paralleling the familiar λέγων formula of New Testament Greek. One might also note the often recurring coepi + infinitive to form what amounts to an ingressive aorist: ‘cepit eum velle revocare’ (6, 4), etc. This corresponds to the Greek idiom involving ἅρχομαι, and may have some connection with it. Also interesting is eicere with the meaning of educere: ‘reginam de palatio . . . fuisse eiectam’ (9, 4-5). This usage is especially common in the Itala Bible, and may have a connection with a strikingly similar weakening of Greek ἐκβάλλειν (=ἐκϕέρειν, ἐξάγειν). All of these usages were common in late popular Latin, and can therefore not be taken as evidence of literary influence, although collectively they may indicate a preference for that type of Latin which resembles Greek. For discussion of the weakened eicere see H. Rönsch, Itala und Vulgata (Marburg, 1875), pp. 361-362; E. Löfstedt, ‘Lateinisch-Griechische Parallelen,’ Symbolae Philologicae O. A. Danielsson Octogenario Dicatae (Upsala, 1932), pp. 179 ff., and Syntactica (2 vols., Lund, 1928-33), ii, 445 ff. On coepi see ibid., ii, 450 ff.\n\n[36] Op. cit., pp. 272 f.\n\n[37] This is evidently the original reading, although the word appears in two of the MSS (L and Ri) as ‘agmen.’\n\n[38] The word is not recorded at all in Harper. It should be pointed out, however, that the word occurs in the title of a fourth-century poem, in a phrase strikingly similar to that found in our text: ‘Verba Achillis in parthenone, cum tubam Diomedis audisset.’ Poetae Latini Minores ed. Aem. Baehrens (6 vols., Leipzig, 1879-86), iv, 322. Could this, as well as the ‘in parthenos’ of ET, represent an attempt to render into Latin a Greek locution pertaining to the disguise of Achilles?\n\n[39] It is possible that a study of some of the episodes would throw light on the period in which the story took its original form. For example, if we are to assume that the story is a Roman product, the account of the Greek athletic sports in the circus (5, 19 ff.) seems suggestive of the early Empire, since in later times these sports were pursued in separate stadia rather than in the circus. The account of the free participation of the King’s sons in the contests is no doubt a Greek touch, since it suggests a prestige which the Greek sports never enjoyed in Rome. On this see L. Friedländer, Darstellungen aus der Sittengeschichte Roms (9th ed., Leipzig, 1919-20), ii, 24 and 145 ff.\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxi ]]\n\nII. The Troy Story in the Excidium Troiae and the Problem of an ‘Enlarged Roman de Troie’\n\nIt has long been known to scholars that a number of vernacular versions of the Troy story contain certain departures from the Dares-Dictys narrative which seem to indicate a common origin. Before discussing the relationship of the Excidium Troiae to other mediaeval Troy narratives, it will be necessary to summarize the hypotheses already advanced for the explanation of this unknown source material\n\nThe problem began with a study of the Middle English poem The Seege or Batayle of Troye. A. Zietsch,1 the first to concern himself with the poem, stated that Dares was the chief source, although he pointed out (but did not explain) a number of divergences. W. Greif,2 observing numerous correspondences between the Seege and Benoit’s Roman de Troie, held that the Roman must also have been used to a considerable extent; and observing, moreover, several close similarities between the English poem, the Trojanische Krieg of Konrad von Würzburg, the Old Norse Trójumanna Saga, and some other versions, in details connected with the life of Paris, postulated the existence of a common Latin source for at least this part of the story. E. T. Granz,3 attempting to account for all the corresponding details, held that an expanded recension of the Roman de Troie was the common source of the accounts, allowing, however, that the English poet made independent use of Dares. The theory was further developed by C. H. A. Wager,4 who by means of a comparative study of the Seege, the Trojanische Krieg, the Trójumanna Saga, and the Old Bulgarian Trojanska Priča, attempted to show that the source common to all was a reworking of the Roman de Troie, partly expanded and partly condensed. G. L. Hamilton,5 after a comparison of parts of the Confessio Amantis with the Trojanische Krieg, attempted to point out that Gower also made extended use of the ‘enlarged Roman de Troie’ in his account of Achilles.\n\nThe whole hypothesis, already grown somewhat topheavy, was valiantly attacked by Miss M. E. Barnicle in her edition of the Seege.6 The ‘enlarged Roman de Troie’ in her opinion was a myth; there was no common source for the accounts mentioned other than a common knowledge of the extant Latin classics. The material interpolated varies so widely in arrangement and general treatment that the postulation of an extended Roman as a main source is a hindrance rather than an aid. Additions of material not found in Dares or Benoit are to be explained on the ground of ‘raw material in the shape of a well-known and widely disseminated\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxii ]]\n\nlegend rehandled as each writer saw fit’ (p. lxvi). Correspondences between the various mediaeval versions therefore simply mean that each writer ‘had a knowledge of Dares, Benoit, Ovid, Statius, or whatever was used as the ground source plus a knowledge of classical legends, such as the Youth of Achilles, the Youth of Paris, etc.’ (p. lxxiv). No intermediate stage need have existed save the growth and operation of tradition—meaning, apparently, oral tradition. This we are led to believe from Miss Barnicle’s mention of the William Tell legend and the Story of the Seven Sages, which she compares to material found in the various Troy stories.\n\nLet us examine first the possibility of a common source for the Seege or Batayle of Troye, the Trojanische Krieg, and the other related versions which have been mentioned. The evidence for such a source is briefly this: toward the beginning of these accounts, which are all recensions of Dares or Benoit, there occur a number of details and episodes not to be found in either of those two sources. Although not all the details occur in all the versions in question, yet there are several cases in which two or three of the versions agree against Dares and Benoit. These are, according to the combined studies of Granz and Wager: (1) Priam’s attempt to regain Hesione; (2) the dream of Hecuba and the birth of Paris; (3) the life of Paris in the fields; (4) his judgment of the goddesses; (5) Paris’ visit to Greece and the carrying off of Helen; and (6) the youth of Achilles.\n\nFirst of all, it should be pointed out that not all the correspondences noted by the exponents of an expanded Roman de Troie are of any significance. Priam’s attempt to regain his sister Hesione, although it is common to both the Seege and Konrad, is not radically different from the account contained in the extant Roman de Troie. Benoit relates7 that Priam, after the rebuilding of Troy, summons a parliament to consider the problem of recovering Hesione, who had been carried away by Hercules and given to Telamon. After some deliberation he decides to send Antenor as a messenger to the Greeks, demanding that Hesione be restored to him. Antenor makes his demand to Peleus, Telamon, Castor and Pollux, and Nestor in turn, but with no success. Now, the Seege8 tells that Priam calls his parliament and proposes war against the Greeks, while the parliament favors peace, provided Hesione be restored. Antenor makes his demand before all the Greeks assembled at one spot, seemingly at the court of Hercules,9 and is duly told to leave, as in Dares and Benoit. Konrad likewise has Priam favor war while the parliament favors peace, and he makes Antenor visit all the Greeks together at the\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxiii ]]\n\ncourt of Telamon in Salamis.10 The obvious difference in the place at which the interview takes place seems to indicate, as Miss Barnicle (pp. lxii ff.) points out, individual handling of the extant Roman de Troie. The condensation of four meetings into one is only natural, for in Benoit’s poem the last three are only repetitions of the first.\n\nIn the story of Paris, to which belong four of the six parallels adduced by Granz and Wager, we find a number of considerably more significant details. The Seege interpolates the following account of his birth and early life: Hecuba, when pregnant, dreams that she gives birth to a firebrand which burns the city of Troy and all the surrounding country.11 The dream is interpreted to mean that her son will bring about the destruction of Troy. When the son is born Hecuba is touched by his beauty, and when he is seven years old she sends him into the fields ‘to kepe swyn wiþ staf and ston.’ He is brought up as a herdsman, where he takes pleasure in making the animals fight, and crowns the winner with a garland. On account of his wisdom he is called Paris.12 Later Priam hears of the wisdom of his son and sends for him. In an assembly in which Priam is considering the sending of an expedition into Greece, Paris relates that in the forest he had acted as arbiter between four ‘ladies’ for the possession of a golden ball which they had found. He is sent to Greece, carries away Helen, and thus brings on the Trojan War.\n\nNo trace of the story of Paris’ youth is to be found in Dares or Benoit; yet the story is contained in the Trojanische Krieg, the Trójumanna Saga, and the Bulgarian Trojanska Priča in essentially the same form as in the Middle English poem. In Konrad,13 as well as in the other two versions,14 Hecuba tells her dream to Priam, who wants to kill the child. In Konrad and the Trojanska Priča Paris is left outside the city and is later found by a shepherd,15 while in the Seege and the Trójumanna Saga Hecuba sends him directly into the keeping of a herdsman;16 the latter seems to be merely a compression of the fuller story found in the other versions. In all four accounts the child is renamed Paris while the Seege and Konrad agree in having this name given him because of his wisdom.17 The Seege agrees with the Trojanska Priča that Paris was seven years old when sent to the fields.18 One of the most striking correspondences is in connection with his life as a herdsman, where, it is related in all four accounts, he takes great delight in making the bulls fight, and always crowns the winner with a garland.19\n\nThe story of Paris’ judgment of the three goddesses is told in a variety of forms, indicative, it seems, of varying degrees of dependence on sources other than Dares and Benoit. The Trójumanna Saga follows Dares in\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxiv ]]\n\nmaking the judgment a dream; in the Seege the goddesses come to Paris while he is asleep but seem to be real entities; while in the Trojanische Krieg and the Trojanska Priča it is an actual occurrence, and has considerably more bearing on the origin of the war. A correspondence in all accounts except the Seege is the appearance of the story of Peleus’ marriage to Thetis and the strife caused by Discord in casting the golden apple.20 It has also been shown that in the Togail Troi, an old Irish version of Dares, we find the same story inserted just before the judgment of Paris.21\n\nThere have been pointed out numerous other correspondences of varying degrees of significance. In the Seege, the Trojanische Krieg, and the Trojanska Priča, Menelaus is present in Sparta when Paris arrives, while in Dares and Benoit he has been called away before the arrival of the Greeks. A rather important similarity between the Seege and Konrad, the last of those advanced as evidence for an expanded Roman de Troie, is the inclusion in both accounts of the story of Achilles’ youth. Both poems tell of the prophecy that he would be killed in battle,22 of his enchantment in magic waters,23 of his life with the centaur and among the virgins at Licomedes’ court, and of his discovery by Ulysses.\n\nIt is almost obvious from the foregoing summary that it would be very difficult to account for all the corresponding details by means of a single hypothetical, all-inclusive source. The theory of an enlarged Roman de Troie is open to at least three objections, any one of which is fatal:\n\n1. The order and manner in which the interpolated events are introduced vary so widely (as pointed out by Miss Barnicle) that it is impossible to conceive of a single poem as a source. The youth of Paris, for example, occurs at the beginning of Konrad’s poem and the Trojanska Priča, while in the Seege it is related after an account of the first destruction of Troy. In the Trójumanna Saga the episode is dragged in, with no apparent connection, just after the Argonauts land at Troy on their expedition to Colchis. The judgment of Paris is told by Konrad as an occurrence following the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, while in the Seege it is an experience related by Paris before Priam and the assembled Trojans. It is evident that no single, all-inclusive romance can account for these divergences.\n\n2. As demonstrated by Greif,24 all the name forms are unquestionably Latin and not French. The Latin declension of names is fairly consistently kept in the Trojanische Krieg and the Trójumanna Saga, and to a lesser extent in the Seege. In the portion containing non-Benoit material, Konrad uses Prîamus, Prîamî, and Prîamô, while in the portion\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxv ]]\n\ndrawn from the Roman he usually uses Prîant, which is in turn verdeutscht to Prîandes, neither of which forms appears toward the beginning of the poem. In the Saga such forms as ‘til Thetidem,’ ‘var sagðr Príamó,’ etc., are indisputable evidence of Latin origin.\n\n3. Finally, the very nature of the added episodes speaks eloquently against an enlarged Roman de Troie. For, bungled as they are, the episodes are essentially classical in nature, and are clearly remnants of a tradition not only widely different from Dares and Benoit, but entirely contradictory to those accounts—a tradition in which divine caprice, manifested in the wedding feast and the subsequent judgment, was the original cause of the Trojan War; and in which Achilles, rather than the arch-traitor of the mediaeval accounts, is a hero of some importance and dignity. The details interpolated into the accounts we have examined represent an attempt to combine and harmonize the two traditions—a palpably unsuccessful attempt, except perhaps in the poem of Konrad, where the entire first part of the story has to be made over in order to allow the reintroduction of the Greek deities as a significant factor in the Trojan War.\n\nThere remains the question of whether the various mediaeval writers drew their supplementary information directly from the extant Latin classics or whether the entire story reflected in the interpolations was known to them in a single, connected narrative such as we find in ET. Miss Barnicle’s idea that these writers made separate use of classical Latin authorities is open to a number of objections. In the first place, although the mediaeval writers all tell essentially the same story, that story is not found in continuous form in any one Latin authority. We would find it necessary to suppose, as Miss Barnicle suggests, that the various versions of Hecuba’s dream and the youth of Paris derive from a combination and expansion of the accounts found in Ovid (Heroides, xvi, 43 ff.) and Hyginus (Fabulae, no. 91). Yet all accounts except Konrad almost immediately depart from Hyginus and agree with Apollodorus25 in having Paris exposed by Hecuba rather than sent to his death by Priam and later spared. There are, moreover, corresponding details which could not possibly have come from Hyginus, such as the statement in all four accounts that Paris liked to watch fights between the bulls in his herd, and that he crowned the victor in these contests.26 For the youth of Achilles the available classical source would be Statius. Yet at some points the mediaeval writers relate a fuller story than that found in the Achilleid—as when both the Seege and Konrad tell of the prophecy that Achilles would die in battle,27 and when the former makes\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxvi ]]\n\nmention of the vulnerable spot of Achilles, where he is later slain.28 The idea, then, that the mediaeval writers could have made up a complete story from the Latin authors that have been mentioned appears highly improbable.\n\nFinally, the supposition that these writers drew their information from the Latin classics would place upon them a burden of scholarship which the author of the Seege, at least,29 is unable to bear. The poem is full of absurdities and corruptions of classical legend: Peleus, the father of Achilles, is ‘half mon, half hors’; Paris’ judgment is for possession of a golden ball which four elfin ladies (Saturnus, Mercurius, Jub ter, and Venus!) had found; Achilles meets his death by being thrown to the ground and having swords and knives thrust into the bottoms of his feet. The theory that the author supplemented Dares and Benoit by the use of Ovid, Statius, Hyginus, Servius, and perhaps other sources is therefore incredible.\n\nIt has become evident that in order to explain the source relation of the vernacular accounts under discussion it is necessary to turn to a single Latin narrative in which the entire story is to be found; it is further apparent that, in its content, ET shows a very close similarity to the material contained in these vernacular versions. Every one of the puzzling episodes is to be found in ET: the wedding feast, Hecuba’s dream and the exposure of Paris, Paris’ life as a shepherd, including his judgment of the bulls, and the youth of Achilles, including the account of his vulnerable heel.\n\nThe evidence for a source relationship is especially strong in connection with details which could not have come from any of the extant classical accounts. In the story of Paris’ life among the herdsmen it is related that he takes pleasure in making the bulls fight, and that he always awards a crown to the victor. The Seege gives the following account:\n\nBote when þe child sawʒ fyʒte bole or bor,\n\nOr any oþir best, lasse or more,\n\nHe hadde gret ioye heom to by-holde\n\nWhiche of heom oþir ouercome scholde;\n\nÞeo child wolde do ilke best to fyʒt\n\nAnd hade gret ioye of þat syʒt;\n\nWilke best wolde fyʒte & stande\n\nHe wolde him coroune wiþ a garlande\n\n(MS L, 281-288).\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxvii ]]\n\nKonrad von Würzburg:\n\nsô vremde pfarren dicke striten\n\nmit den sînen von geschiht,\n\nson lieʒ er sîn engelten niht,\n\ndaʒ si dâ fremde wâren.\n\ner wolte rehtes vâren\n\nund tet in guot gerihte kunt.\n\nswaʒ dâ gesigte bî der stunt:\n\neʒ wære ein ohse, eʒ wære ein wider,\n\ndaʒ reht enleit er dô niht nider,\n\nwan er im eine crône\n\nsazt ûf sîn houbet schône.\n\n(640-650).\n\nTrojanska Priča:\n\nPariž committebat duos boves, et pungebant inter se et uter vincebat, ei nectebat coronam e floribus; uter vero non vincebat, ei nectebat (coronam) e stramine\n\n(p. 159).\n\nTrójumanna Saga:\n\n. . . ok á nokkorum degi, er hann [Paris] gætti feárins, kom til hans griðúngr einn mikill, er hann hafði eigi fyrr sèt, ok barðist við einn af hans griðúngum, ok varð sá sigraðr er Alexandr átti, þá setti Þórr kórónu af dýrlegum blómum yfir höfuð hans; ok annan dag kom griðúngr, ok fór sem hinn fyrra dag; ok hinn þriðja dag komm hinn sami griðúngr, ok mátti sá minna fyrst, er Alexandr átti, ok þá batt hann brodd einn mikinn í enni honum, ok mátti sá þá ekki við, er til var kominn, ok undi þá Alexandr vel við, ok því setti hann kórónu á höfuð honum, ok tignaði hann þá svâ fyri sigr sinn\n\n(p. 20).\n\nThe correspondence in all four versions of this detail is a sufficient indication that it was to be found in the original source; and, further, that it had some rather important bearing on the story. Konrad intimates that in judging these contests Paris shows great justice; the author of the Saga seems to conceive of the episode as having some significance, yet he never connects it with the preceding or following events. Now, ET makes perfectly clear the nature of the classical story which must underlie the other accounts. Mars takes the likeness of a bull, overcomes Paris’ animal, and receives the crown; it is by means of this that Paris’ justice as a judge is known to the gods (4, 11-21). The relation of ET to the other accounts is obvious. The fights between the animals serve as a link between Paris’ life in the fields and his choice as arbiter in the dispute between the goddesses. The account given in the Saga of the\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxviii ]]\n\nstrange griðúngr becomes quite intelligible when interpreted as a remnant of the fuller story given in ET.\n\nIt seems evident that the narrative contained in the first part of ET was available in some form to the mediaeval writers whose works we have been considering. But before going into a detailed analysis of the episodes in order to determine this source relationship more exactly, it will be necessary to discuss the relationship of ET’s Troy story to a number of other mediaeval narratives which have not as yet been mentioned.\n\nNOTES TO SECTION II\n\n[1] Zeitsch, Über Quelle und Sprache des mittelenglischen Gedichtes ‘Seege oder Batayle of Troye’ (Kassel, 1883).\n\n[2] Greif, Die mittelalterlichen Bearbeitungen der Trojanersage (Ausgaben und Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete der Romanischen Philologie, lxi, Marburg, 1886).\n\n[3] Granz, Über die Quellengemeinschaft des mittelenglischen Gedichtes ‘Seege oder Batayle of Troye’ und des mittelhochdeutschen Gedichtes vom trojanischen Kriege des Konrad von Würzburg (Leipzig, 1888).\n\n[4] Wager, The Seege of Troye (New York, 1899).\n\n[5] Hamilton, ‘Gower’s Use of the Enlarged Roman de Troie,’ PMLA, xx (1905), 179-196.\n\n[6] The Seege or Batayle of Troye, ed.

The Troy Story: Further Literary Relationships\n\nSince the Excidium Troiae is clearly a redaction and not an original mediaeval work, it will be worth while to consider the possibility of related Latin redactions of the same basic narrative. Especially interesting in this connection is an account attached to two of the manuscripts of the Chronicon Venetum known as Compendium Historiae Troianae-Romanae.1 Although extremely brief, this narrative shows some remarkable affinities to ET, and it seems quite likely that it was partly derived from the same ultimate source. Although not all the events in question are included, and although the order of the narrative is somewhat different, it will be recognized that the two stories are very close in content. The Compendium begins with a brief account of Orpheus and Neptune and the building of Troy. There follows the sinister dream of Hecuba, who envisions the birth of a firebrand which burns the city.2 Priam therefore decides to destroy the infant, but Hecuba, moved with pity, sends him to a herdsman for safekeeping.3 He is brought up in the fields, as in ET; and there is the additional information that he shows his prowess by conquering twelve robbers. He likes to watch fights between the bulls and always crowns the winner with a garland. When a strange bull is defeated by Paris’ favorite, he crowns the winner; but when the same animal returns and gains the victory, he removes the garland from his pet and crowns the stranger with it.4 At the wedding of Proserpina and Perithous, Discordia casts the apple; and the goddesses come to Paris, since they have heard of the judgment of the bulls. Paris decides in favor of Venus and later, at her advice, goes to Greece in the guise of a merchant. There he steals Helen, and thus brings on the Trojan War. Following the war, there is an account of Aeneas, with no apparent direct dependence on Virgil, although the events are roughly the same. Finally, there is a somewhat fuller summary of the history of Rome.\n\nIt is obvious that the Compendium and ET are very similar in their general outlines, and it seems quite likely that the two are to some extent dependent upon a common original. Three details especially are indicative of such a relationship, since, so far as has been determined, they do not occur in other Latin accounts. One is the story of the bull fights5 and Paris’ justice in judging them. Another is the statement in both accounts that Venus took unfair advantage of the other goddesses when she came to make her bribe by appearing nude before Paris and thus arousing in him a burning passion.6 Finally, there is Paris’ ruse of pretending to be a merchant when he came to Greece and abducted Helen.7\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxii ]]\n\nAlthough the Compendium is probably too brief to have served to a very great extent as a source book for mediaeval writers, it is highly significant in showing that the Trojan material contained in ET existed in other related Latin accounts which would have been available to mediaeval authors.\n\nThe idea that this related Latin material was used by mediaeval writers on Troy is suggested very strongly by a study of the Troy narrative which Robert Mannyng of Brunne incorporates into his Story of England.8 Toward the beginning of his history, Mannyng devotes some 300 lines to a recounting of the events leading up to the destruction of Troy. This narrative has hitherto been attributed to Dares Phrygius,9 whom Mannyng cites as his authority. Yet the evidence for Mannyng’s use of Dares consists only of a short sketch (ll. 431-456) of the first destruction of Troy at the hands of Jason. This evidence is decidedly inconclusive, since Mannyng’s information might have come from any of a number of intermediate versions.10\n\nThe remainder of Mannyng’s narrative consists of three episodes, none of which is part of the Dares tradition. The first of these (ll. 459-502) is the now familiar battle of the bulls. Paris, son of Priam (says Mannyng), was a keeper of beasts, since it was the custom in old times for knights and youths of noble blood to keep them.11 One day a bull comes from Greece and fights with one of Paris’ beasts. The next day he returns; the battle goes on for many days. Finally the ‘bole of Troye’ is defeated, whereupon Paris awards a crown to the victorious stranger. As in ET and the numerous vernacular versions, this story is designed to establish the competence of Paris as a judge; but Mannyng compresses the story considerably by having the three goddesses themselves observe the battle of the bulls and its outcome. Mannyng’s account agrees very closely with that of the Compendium, which, unlike ET, relates that the strange bull returned to battle more than once.\n\nThe second of Mannyng’s episodes is the judgment of the goddesses (ll. 503-612)—but Robert transforms them into ‘þre wicches,’ who ‘in þe eyr dide fare.’ These weird sisters observe the bull fight and Paris’ decision, and marvel at his wisdom. Soon they begin to argue over their beauty, and they agree to let Paris decide the issue. As a prize they resolve to make a ball of some kind, and they request Paris to award it to the fairest among them. Before the day set for judgment the three come to Paris individually and offer bribes. Juno offers worldly position, Pallas offers wisdom, while Venus offers the ‘fairest lady þat now\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxiii ]]\n\nlyues’ (l. 581). After much soul-searching, Paris decides to award the ball to Venus, whereupon the other ladies are ‘for wrayth al mad.’\n\nThe source of this episode could certainly not have been Dares, since in Dares’ account the judgment is merely a dream which Paris relates before the parliament; moreover, there is no mention of the bribes offered by either Pallas or Juno. Neither ET nor the Compendium will serve; in the former Pallas is called Minerva and she promises victory rather than wisdom; in the latter the bribes of Pallas and Juno are omitted entirely. But the general similarity between Mannyng and these narratives12 seems strong enough to warrant the supposition that the source which he used had some relation to those accounts.\n\nThe third episode which Mannyng presents is the rape of Helen (ll. 613-730). Venus, immediately after the judgment, instructs Paris to prepare a ship laden with riches and proceed to Greece in the guise of a merchant. Paris arrives, and is greeted by Menelaus. Paris tells him that whoever wishes to see his riches must come aboard his ship. Helen hears of this and finally gets leave to visit the merchant vessel. After she comes aboard and is absorbed in an examination of the riches, Paris sets sail and takes her away to Troy. There follows a short account of the towering wrath of Menelaus, and of the expedition which resulted in the final overthrow of Troy.\n\nThis episode likewise differs radically from the narrative of Dares, in which Helen is simply captured in the temple, and carried away after a battle with the oppidani.13 But a most interesting parallel to Mannyng’s narrative is found in the Compendium (p. 243), where Paris approaches Helen in the likeness of a merchant, woos her with words and gifts, and finally sails away with her to Troy. An almost identical account is given in the Spanish Libro de Alexandre (to be discussed later)—the only important difference being that Menelaus is absent at the time of Paris’ arrival (as he is also in Dares). One manuscript of the Seege, moreover, mentions Paris’ ruse of pretending to be a merchant when questioned as to his identity,14 and in ET, as we have seen (pp. xxxi, xxxix, n. 7), Paris is mistaken for a merchant when he arrives at Menelaus’ kingdom. It seems quite evident that ET gives us an abridgment of an episode which was originally something like that contained in the Compendium, and that Mannyng must have had access to some form of the narrative that underlies these accounts.\n\nThere are a number of other vernacular Troy stories which should be examined with a view to their source relationship to ET. The late Professor\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxiv ]]\n\nA. G. Solalinde pointed out (orally) that the chain of events with which we are concerned was known to the Spanish writers of the thirteenth century, and that essentially the same story of Paris and the origin of the war is to be found in the Libro de Alexandre as well as in some later versions. A brief survey of these works will be helpful.\n\nThe Libro de Alexandre15 is, of course, mainly concerned with the fabulous life of Alexander the Great. There is, however, an insertion of some length (stanzas 322-761) in which a complete account of the Trojan War is given, the sources of which have not been fully determined.16 A comparison of this part of the story with ET reveals a striking similarity not only in the choice of events but also in the order of their narration. After a brief summary of the whole Trojan War we find an account of the wedding feast—but it is transformed into a convocation held by ‘dos reys,’ who remain unnamed. Discordia becomes Sin, or the Evil One—‘el peccado’—and she (or he) casts the golden apple and brings about great strife, whereupon the goddesses are sent to the shepherd Paris.17 At this point the author breaks off to tell of the early life of Paris.18 Before his birth Hecuba had seen a horrible thing in her sleep:\n\nque salie de su cuerpo || una flamma yrada\n\nquemaua toda Troya || tornaua la en nada.19\n\nPriam accordingly commands that the child be killed; but Hecuba sends him to be reared by shepherds. A brief account of his life with them is given, but the bull fights are not mentioned. The goddesses come before him and harangue him at some length, promising him the regular bribes.20 Paris decides in favor of Venus and demands the wife of Menelaus, of whose beauty he has heard. Venus consents but tells him that he must change his name and go as a merchant.21 He proceeds to Greece and steals Helen while Menelaus is absent ‘en una caualgada.’22\n\nAt this point the Greeks prepare for war; and one of their first tasks is to find Achilles. It is related that Achilles’ mother, a very clever woman, had enchanted him so that ‘non podies fierro || nunca en el entrar.’23 Then, still fearing an evil fate, she places him among the nuns in a monastery.24 Ulixes finds him by placing weapons before him; and he is taken to Troy to join in the fighting. The author turns to other sources for the actual siege; yet there is one more interesting point of comparison in connection with the death of Achilles. Paris knows about his vulnerable point, which, according to Alexandre, is in ‘las plantas de los pies.’25 He finds Achilles kneeling in prayer and kills him by shooting an arrow into the sole of his foot. This seems to be a corruption of the older story\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxv ]]\n\nfound in ET, in which Paris shoots Achilles in the heel while he is worshiping in the temple of Apollo.\n\nIt is obvious that the story told in Alexandre is remarkably similar in most respects to that found in ET. If we make allowance for the free mediaevalizing of the story in Alexandre we can find few differences of any significance. One is the use (in Alex.) of the name Pallas for Minerva and Ulixes for Odisseus. Another is the statement that Priam knows about Hecuba’s evil dream and advises that the child be killed, whereas in ET Hecuba acts on her own responsibility. Then there is the mention of the fact that Hecuba’s child is first named Alexe and is later renamed Paris26—a detail not found in ET. Finally, there is the account of Venus’ scheme for Paris to sail to Greece under the pretense of being a merchant, which, as we have seen, corresponds to the Compendium and to Robert Mannyng. All these differences might reasonably be interpreted to mean that the source of Alexandre was a different redaction of the same basic narrative, in which the story was told more fully and with some variations. At any rate, the great similarity of Alexandre to ET warrants the assumption of a very close source relationship between the two.\n\nAnother Spanish account which evidently contains a great deal of material from the same version of the Troy story is that contained in the General Estoria of Alfonso el Sabio.27 Solalinde has already pointed out28 that the story of the judgment of Paris, especially the part concerned with the promises of the goddesses, was drawn largely from the Libro de Alexandre. From the same source might well have come the statement that Achilles was vulnerable only in the soles of his feet,29 and that Paris shot him while he was kneeling in prayer.30 Yet the Estoria is much more complete than Alexandre in telling that Achilles was definitely dipped in the Styx by Thetis31 rather than merely enchanted. It also contains an account of Paris’ judgment of the bulls,32 which could not have come from the Alexandre. Although Alfonso includes a vast body of Trojan material in his history before settling down to Dares’ account of the actual fighting, the general plan and order of the events are quite similar to those of Alexandre and ET. It would be unwise to state a final conclusion until a complete study of the Estoria has been made; yet it seems not unreasonable to suppose that some form of the Latin version with which we are concerned influenced the first part of Alfonso’s narrative.\n\nStill another Spanish account which shows some affinities to ET is Leomarte’s Sumas de Historia Troyana.33 Although in large part Leomarte’s\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxvi ]]\n\nnarrative follows that of the Libro de Alexandre, it is more complete in certain points, as for example in the inclusion of the incident of Paris and the bulls, in which Leomarte agrees quite closely with Alfonso’s version. There is likewise an interesting correspondence with Konrad von Würzburg in the story of Paris’ exposure, in which it is related that Paris is sent to be killed, but is spared by the servants when they see the infant smile.34\n\nTwo of the Italian texts published by Gorra should likewise be taken into consideration in connection with ET. One of these, the Istorietta Trojana,35 contains the familiar episode of Paris’ judgment of the bulls, and some interesting variations in the judgment of the goddesses, to be discussed later (p. xliv). The other, La Fiorita of Armannino Giudice,36 is of interest in that it contains one element not commonly found: the story of Paris’ return to Troy and his defeat of his brothers in the athletic contests. After telling (roughly according to Guido de Columnis) of Jason and Medea and the first destruction of Troy, Armannino gives a brief account of Hecuba’s dream of a firebrand which burns the city. Paris is accordingly exposed and brought up by a shepherd. He becomes an expert bowman and an excellent athlete. Enone, a ‘duchessa,’ is mentioned briefly, but there is no account of the animal fights or even (at this point) of the judgment of the goddesses. Having heard of the athletic contests in Troy, Paris goes thither to take part. He engages his brothers in friendly sparring bouts and defeats them all, including Hector. Hector is humiliated, and seizes his sword in order to deal Paris a death blow. Hecuba, having recognized her shepherd son, intervenes to save his life, for he would never have survived a real battle with his elder brother.37 This account differs noticeably from ET, in which Paris’ brothers plan to take their revenge by surrounding the circus with soldiers who are to seize him after the games are finished. Armannino’s account shows some similarity to that of Servius, the chief disagreement being the statement that it was Hecuba who revealed Paris’ identity; Servius states that Paris revealed himself, while in ET it is his foster-father, the shepherd, who makes the revelation. It seems unlikely that Armannino’s source could have been the brief statements of Servius,38 and this story of Paris’ contest with his brothers may well go back ultimately to the ET narrative of Paris’ athletic feats in the stadium.39\n\nThe reason why most mediaeval writers neglected to mention Paris’ triumph in the athletic contests is, no doubt, that they considered the episode inappropriate. They were unable to distinguish between athletic prowess of the Greek variety and actual strength in battle. To have\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxvii ]]\n\nParis defeat Hector must have seemed impossible to a mediaeval writer, since it was dangerously like questioning the supremacy of the noblest knight of antiquity. The German writers, however, seemed to have no scruples about recording the contest as a fight between Paris and Hector. In the Weltchronik of Jansen Enikel,40 Paris engages Hector in a fierce fight with bucklers and finally strikes him down, after which the shepherd dramatically reveals the identity of his ward. This is quite similar to the account given in Konrad’s Trojanische Krieg (ll. 5012-5068), in which the brothers wage a playful battle ‘in einem rinc,’ and Paris smites Hector so heavy a blow that the shepherd feels constrained to interfere in order to prevent serious trouble.\n\nA much more distinct effort to emphasize the valor of Paris is observable in the Middle High German Göttweiger Trojanerkrieg.41 This contains a highly mediaevalized narrative whose sources can be but vaguely discerned, since the author obviously allows himself great freedom and independence in telling the story. There is an interminable account of Paris in the guise of a knight-errant who wanders about overcoming giants and dwarfs and otherwise distinguishing himself by mighty deeds of arms. The relationship of this account to ET is indicated by the appearance of the same characteristic events: Hecuba’s dream; the exposure of Paris; his life as a shepherd, including his judgment of the bulls; his judgment of the goddesses; and the finding of Achilles at the court of Nicomedes.42 There are, however, many additional accounts of Paris’ exploits, which may have been inspired by the classical story of his athletic ability. While still a shepherd, he slays a dog with his fist, and later overcomes a she-bear and a lion.43 After his judgment of the goddesses Paris sets out in search of adventure; but rather than merely go to Troy and distinguish himself in the stadium, he wanders about and engages in a series of gaudy mediaeval battles.44 He is finally dubbed ‘knight’ by the ‘kaisser’ in Constantinople and is there victorious in a glorious tournament, which, it is just possible, may correspond to the circus games in ET. Of course, Paris’ exploits in the Trojan War are equally valorous. It would be highly inconsistent if so bold a knight resorted to the unmanly trick of shooting Achilles from ambush; and indeed, he does not: he engages him in a fierce duel and slays him (in what manner it is not clear). Then he hews off his head and throws it away:\n\nDas hoptt schwang er von im dan:\n\nBy dem hare er es do nan,\n\nMitt gewaltt er es von dan\n\nWarff über muren und dry graben\n\n(19400-19403).\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxviii ]]\n\nSuch an account of Paris is, of course, rather unusual and individual; yet it seems likely that in its main outlines it was inspired, or suggested, by the more ancient story contained in ET, in which considerable attention is given to the youth of Paris, and in which his youthful exploits are sufficiently prominent to suggest many heroic qualities to a mediaeval writer. The German account wanders rather far afield, to be sure; but it is difficult to suggest another origin.\n\nAnother version of the Paris story which shows some interesting affinities to ET is the brief account of the judgment of Paris contained in Eneas,45 a twelfth century romance drawn from Virgil and a number of other sources.46 The interpolation regarding Paris is the same in all essentials as that found in ET: the three goddesses are at a ‘parlemant’ (l. 103) when Discorde casts a golden apple on which an inscription indicates that the most beautiful should have it. They fall into strife, come to Paris, and show him the inscription. Paris postpones judgment for three days;47 during this time the three goddesses come to him separately and offer him wealth, strength in battle, and the fairest lady respectively.48 On the day agreed upon they return, and Paris awards the apple to Venus. The great similarity in plan, as well as in many of the details,49 is apparent, and we can hardly avoid the conclusion that some version of this Latin narrative was known to the author of Eneas. There should be noted, however, some significant differences in the two accounts. Minerva in Eneas is called Pallas, and she is the second to offer her bribe rather than the first as in ET. Juno’s offer to increase Paris’ flocks in the Latin account (4, 32-5, 1) is peculiarly bucolic—whereas in Eneas she merely offers wealth:\n\nplus que ses pere ne avoit,\n\net molt par lo feroit riche home\n\n(140-141).\n\nThese differences might at first sight appear to be original variations in the narrative; but a close study of them points to the conclusion that the author of Eneas is following his source in these details. No less than nine of the analogues discussed in Section IV, episode 450 show the very same divergences from ET: Minerva is called Pallas, and she follows Juno in her address to Paris; moreover, in not one of these analogues does Juno make the offer that she makes in ET. These facts, together with a consideration of the close and detailed similarity of Eneas to ET in other respects, confirm the idea that some reworking of the ET narrative—whether an earlier or a later form than that extant—had acquired the traits that we have noted in Eneas.\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xxxix ]]\n\nIn addition to the versions already mentioned, there are a few other narratives which will be occasionally cited in the ensuing analysis of episodes. One of these is MS G of the Roman de Troie, attributed to Jean Maukaraume,51 containing an account of Hecuba’s dream and the youth of Paris. Versions of the youth of Achilles and of his discovery among the virgins will be cited from the Alexander of Ulrich von Eschenbach,52 from some fragments attached to the Repgauische Chronik,53 and from the Confessio Amantis of John Gower.54 A few references will also be made to three other accounts: the Old French Floire et Blanceflor,55 the Historie van Troyen of Jakob Maerlant,56 and the Liet von Troye of Herbort von Fritslâr.57\n\nNOTES TO SECTION III\n\n[1] Published by H.

A. Morel-Fatio, Romania, iv (1875), 82 ff., holds that the first part of the story ‘procède évidemment de la version qui est représentée par la Crónica troyana imprimée’ (p. 87), of which there were several early editions. This was a reworking of Leomarte, Sumas de Historia Troyana (edited in 1932 by A. Rey in Revista de Filología Española, Anejo XV). Professor Solalinde has stated that this material cannot possibly be considered older than the Alexandre, and so it hardly comes into question as a source. The Troy story in Alexandre is probably the earliest of the Spanish versions (see A. Rey, op. cit., pp. 16ff.), and its sources need a thorough re-examination, for which this survey may serve as a starting point. On Alexandre and its sources see also R. S. Willis, Jr., The Relationship of the Spanish ‘Libro de Alexandre’ to the ‘Alexandreis’ of Gautier de Chatillon (Elliott Monographs, no. 31, Princeton and Paris, 1934), and The Debt of the Spanish ‘Libro de Alexandre’ to the French ‘Roman d’Alexandre’ (Elliott Monographs, no. 33, Princeton and Paris, 1935).\n\n[17] Stanzas 335-345.

The Troy Story: Analysis of Episodes\n\nIn order to bring together the mass of analogous literary material, it will be worth while to analyze separately the episodes in ET relating to Paris and Achilles, indicating as nearly as possible the points at which ET agrees and disagrees with the other versions which have been discussed.1\n\n1. Marriage of Peleus and Thetis\n\nJupiter gives a feast to celebrate the marriage of Peleus to the Nereid Thetis. To it he invites a number of deities. Discordia, enraged at not being invited, procures a golden apple on which she writes: ‘A gift to the fairest goddess.’2 This she casts among the assembled deities. Juno, Minerva, and Venus fall into strife and ask Jupiter to decide which of them is most beautiful. Being fearful of offending them, he refuses and sends them to Paris, a shepherd on Mount Ida (ET, p. 3, 11-26).\n\nThe story of this feast is found (in some form) in C (242-243), K (808 ff.), TP (159-161), TT (75-76), Leom (151 ff.), Alf (23 ff.), JE (13787 ff.), TS (18, 20), Alex (335-345), Ulr (4877 ff.), and En (101 ff.).\n\nOnly in K and TP3 is the feast connected with Peleus and Thetis. In C, it is the wedding of Proserpine and Perithous; in TS, it seems to be the wedding of Paris and Thetis. TT mentions Peleus but not Thetis. In JE, it is a ‘hôchzît’ held in Troy by the three goddesses. In Alf and Leom, it is confused with the feast of Tantalus; in Alex, it is a gathering held by two kings. In TS, it seems to be the bride herself who casts the apple; in Alex, the apple is cast by Satan. S, Alex, Leom, Alf, and K give a fuller and more dramatic version of the quarrel, in which there are some correspondences.4 RM, GT, S, and IT drop the episode and otherwise account for the apple. In RM (503 ff.), the goddesses begin to quarrel over their beauty and resolve to make a ball as a prize; in GT (1787 ff.), Distordia and Terius give Paris the apple with instructions to award it to one of the goddesses who will appear; in S and IT, the goddesses find a ball and then begin to quarrel over it. In K, Alf, and Leom, Jupiter’s reasons for refusing to decide the quarrel are the same: since he is related to all, he dare not decide.5\n\n2. Hecuba’s Dream and the Exposure of Paris\n\nHecuba dreams, when pregnant, that she gives birth to a firebrand which burns Troy to the ground.6 The dream is interpreted to mean\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xliii ]]\n\nthat her son will be the cause of Troy’s downfall. When Paris is born he is exposed on Mount Ida and is found by a shepherd (ET, p. 4, 1-9).\n\nFound in C (242), S (239 ff.), TS (18), TP (159), K (354 ff.), GT (1 ff., 827 ff., 1328 ff.), JE (13515 ff.), Alex (348 ff.), Leom (149 ff.), Fior (539), and RTG (389 f.).\n\nHecuba’s dream, except for a few individual flourishes, shows a fair degree of uniformity. In its interpretation there are several variations. In ET, RTG, and S, Hecuba sends the child away without Priam’s knowledge; in the other versions she tells Priam about her dream. In K, Priam himself interprets the dream, after the birth of Paris. In Alex, Leom, and K, Priam tells Hecuba that it is better to lose a son than the whole city of Troy.7 In JE and Alex, Paris is stolen away from his mother by servants.8 K and Leom agree in having Paris sent not to be exposed but to be killed and later spared by the servants. In C, S, TS, and RTG, Paris is not exposed but sent secretly by Hecuba to a herdsman to be reared. In S and TP, Paris is seven years old when he goes to the fields to care for the herds.\n\n3. Life of Paris as a Herdsman\n\nParis is brought up as a herdsman, and becomes well known among his fellows. He likes to watch fights between the bulls, and gives the winner a golden crown. One day Mars takes the likeness of a bull and overcomes Paris’ favorite. Paris removes the crown from his bull and awards it to Mars. For this reason he wins a wide reputation for justice (ET, p. 4, 11-21).\n\nAnalogous versions are found in C (242), S (273 ff.), RM (459 ff.), TS (20), TP (159), K (576 ff.), GT (1419 ff.; 1767 ff.), Leom (150-151), Alf (45r-45v), Fior (539), and IT (381).\n\nSeveral expansions of the story are to be found. K, TP, Leom, and Fior state that the shepherd’s wife had just borne a son. S (289 f.), K (658 ff.; 1746 ff.), GT (1908 ff.), Leom (152), Alf (27), TP (159), TS (18), Alex (360), and Fior (539) state that the child was renamed; in the first five the name is given him because of his great justice or wisdom.9 K, S, Alf, Leom, and TP merely state that Paris liked to watch fights between the bulls and that he crowned the winner; in the other accounts a strange bull fights with his bull. In no version besides ET is the strange bull identified with Mars. In C, S, TP, TS, Leom, Alf, IT, and GT, the crown is of flowers, not gold; K and RM merely mention a crown, of unspecified material.10 In K and Alf, Paris wins such a reputation\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xliv ]]\n\nfor justice that people come to him from far and near with their disputes. K, TP, Leom, and Fior include the love of Paris and Oenone; K gives the fullest account.\n\n4. Judgment of the Goddesses\n\nThe three goddesses come before Paris and show him the inscription.11 He postpones the judgment in order to listen to their bribes.12 Minerva offers strength in battle; Juno offers to increase his flocks by having them produce twin offspring; Venus offers the fairest lady. Paris awards the apple to Venus, whereupon the other goddesses are hostile to the Trojans (ET, pp. 4, 23-5, 18).\n\nVersions are found in C (243), S (507 ff.), RM (513 ff.), TS (20, 22), TP (161-163), TT (76 f.), K (1881 ff.), GT (2004 ff.), JE (13863 ff.), Alex (362 ff.), Leom (153-154), Alf (27 ff.), IT (382), Flo (451 ff.), En (114 ff.), and Ulr (4905 ff.).\n\nThe story seems to have been known in a great variety of forms and from a variety of sources; it will not be possible even to mention all the variations. TS follows Dares in making the judgment a dream; in S and IT, the goddesses come to Paris while he is asleep but apparently wake him up; in the other accounts the occurrence is definitely real. In no other account besides ET is Pallas called Minerva. In TS, the three goddesses are Freyja, Sif, and Gefjon, while in three MSS of S, they are four ‘ladies of Elfen Land’: Saturnus, Mercurius, Jubiter, and Venus. K and JE have Paris attend the feast, and the judgment seems to take place there. The speeches of the goddesses to Paris in K, S, TP, Leom, and IT show some significant correspondences.13 The bribes of the goddesses show great variety. In RM, K, and JE, Pallas promises wisdom rather than strength in battle, while in TS and Flo she promises both.14 No parallel has been found to Juno’s promise in ET, although her offer of wealth takes a number of forms; e.g., in GT, she offers all the treasures buried since Adam. In TP and K, Venus specifically promises Helen; in IT and S, Venus offers to make all the ladies love him and to give him his pick; in Alex and JE, he is also to have his choice.15 In ET and C, Venus appears nude to Paris and warps his judgment;16 in C, he makes advances to her, but since she cannot cohabit with a mortal, she offers Helen instead.\n\n5. Paris’ Defeat of his Brothers\n\nParis goes to Troy, where the circus games are in progress. He enters the arena and overcomes the ‘campestriarii,’17 then he defeats the runners.\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xlv ]]\n\nHis brothers challenge him to race, and he defeats them. They plan to kill him, but are prevented by the shepherd, who declares that Paris is their brother (ET, pp. 5, 19-6, 22).\n\nSomewhat similar events are found in Fior (539-540), K (5012 ff.), JE (13691 ff.), and GT (10879 ff. et passim.).\n\nIn all of these accounts the contest is a fight of some kind between Paris and Hector. In Fior, Hecuba reveals Paris’ identity; in K and JE, it is the shepherd; in GT, the brothers, after a long fight, recognize each other after the fashion of Round Table knights.18\n\n6. Expedition to Greece and Rape of Helen\n\nParis is sent on an expedition to Greece for the purpose of recovering Hesione, Priam’s captive sister. He arrives at the kingdom of Menelaus in disguise, and is mistaken for a merchant.19 With the aid of Venus he wins Helen’s love and runs away with her, together with much treasure (ET, pp. 7, 5-9, 3).\n\nCf. C (243), S (654a-654h), RM (613 ff.), Alex (389 ff.), K (20469 ff.), and Rep Chron (34).\n\nRM and Alex agree with C in having Venus instruct Paris to change his name and go to Greece in the guise of a merchant. In C, S, K, RM, and Alex, Menelaus is present when Paris arrives, but only in S and RM does he remain throughout Paris’ stay.20 In S (Harley MS) Paris, when questioned, says that he is a merchant; in K he also conceals his identity, saying that he is a Carthaginian. Most writers prefer to follow Dares in this episode.\n\n7. Youth of Achilles\n\nThetis, mother of Achilles, dips him in the Styx so that he becomes invulnerable except in his heel. Then, because of a prophecy that Achilles will die in battle, she turns him over to Chiron to be reared. After he is able to bear arms, Thetis remembers the prophecy, takes him from Chiron, and places him among the virgins of King Licomedes (ET, pp. 10, 21-11, 7).21\n\nFound in S (1200 ff.), K (4496 ff.; 5758 ff.; 13402 ff.), Alex (410 ff.), Leom (179), Alf (64r), JE (14531 ff.), Rep Chron (35), Gow (V, 2961 ff.), and Ulr (18488 ff.).\n\nIn S, Alf, Alex, Leom, and GT, Achilles’ vulnerable point is in the soles\n\n[[ Print Edition Page No. xlvi ]]\n\nof his feet.22 Only Alf names the Styx; Alex merely has him enchanted, while S and K mention magic waters.23 In K, Proteus utters the prophecy concerning Achilles; in S, Thetis reads it in the firmament.24 In Alex and Leom, Thetis places Achilles among the nuns in a convent; both accounts omit the training of Achilles by Chiron.25\n\n8. Finding of Achilles\n\nBecause of a prophecy that Troy can be conquered only with the help of Achilles,26 Odisseus and Diomedes go to seek him. They come to Licomedes’ court in the guise of ambassadors. They display feminine trinkets and also arms before the virgins; Achilles chooses the arms and is recognized. He has been in love with Didamia and on her has begotten Pyrrus (ET, pp. 9, 17-10, 20).\n\nFound in S (1192 ff.; 1252 ff.), K (27108 ff.), TP (173 ff.), GT (16303 ff.), JE (15089 ff.), Alex (413 ff.), Leom (179 ff.), Fior (544 ff.), Rep Chron (35), Gow (V, 3070 ff.), and Ulr (18491 ff.).27\n\nIn no other account besides ET is Ulixes called Odisseus. K gives a long account of the love of Achilles and Deidamia.\n\n9. Death of Achilles\n\nAchilles has married Polyxena, who finds out about his vulnerable heel. Achilles is invited to the temple of Apollo, where Paris shoots him in the heel with a poisoned arrow (ET, pp. 12, 12-13, 5).\n\nCf. S (1648 ff.), Alex (722 ff.), Alf (81r), and JE (16456 ff.).\n\nThe principal difference from the Dares accounts is the utilizing of Achilles’ vulnerable point, which in S, Alex, and Alf28 is in the soles of his feet. In S, Paris and his companions thrust swords and knives into the bottoms of his f"
