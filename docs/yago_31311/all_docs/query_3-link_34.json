The early medieval remains are mostly located in the northern half of the property, consisting of storage structures or silos and a series of structures of undetermined function. The rest of the structures located, distributed throughout the property, date from the 17th century. No remains have been found that can be attributed to the 14th century, when Queen Sibylla lived there, and therefore a late medieval chronology of the building is initially ruled out, but this previous building could have been destroyed during the flood of 1421.\n\nUbi.cat"
