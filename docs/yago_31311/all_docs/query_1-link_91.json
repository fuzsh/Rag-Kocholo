        "text": "Description\n\n2nd Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.\n\nSir Isaac Newton FRS (/ˈnjuːtən/;[6] 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English physicist and mathematician (described in his own day as a \"natural philosopher\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Newton made seminal contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for the development of calculus.\n\nIsaac Newton in Wikipedia\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
