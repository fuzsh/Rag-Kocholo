        "text": "Martha was the youngest of three children. Her elder brother was John II of Armagnac, who succeeded their father. Her sister was Joanna of Armagnac who married John, Duke of Berry and was mother of Marie, Duchess of Auvergne, amongst others.\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Jean de Clermont and his wife Jeanne de Dargies. Jean was son of Robert, Count of Clermont and his wife Beatrice, Dame de Bourbon. Robert was son of Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence.\n\nThe grandparents of Martha's father were Bernard VI of Armagnac and Cecile de Rodez.\n\nMartha was not named in domini Johannis comitis Armaniaci which listed the names of her family, so she must have been born after its making on 18 February 1347.[citation needed]\n\nMartha was a proposed wife for Peter II of Alen√ßon in 1370 but he instead married Marie, Viscountess of Beaumont-au-Maine.\n\nDuring these years, Peter IV of Aragon had sought an alliance with Philip VI of France to prevent a new war with Castile. In 1370 he negotiated a marriage for his heir; John, Duke of Girona with Jeanne of France, daughter of Philip VI but the project failed when the princess died on her journey to Barcelona in 1371. Moreover, Henry II of Castile became an ally necessary to Charles V of France (who had helped get the Castilian throne), as demonstrated with the triumph of his army against the English at the Battle of La Rochelle (June 1372).\n\nIn this context Martha's father John, a major feudal lord of Occitania and, a vassal of the King of France, appeared in the eyes of King Peter and although they had been enemies during the War of the Two Peters, he was a good insurance against the Castilian threat. The count of Armagnac wished to strengthen its position in Occitania and in France and get a good ally against its rival, the Counts of Foix. Negotiations began in summer 1372 and of the marriage contract was signed on March 27, 1373, for the marriage of Martha to John, son of King Peter IV. The dowry amounted to the astronomical figure of 150,000 pounds. Martha was received with great solemnity at the border according to sources of Martin, John's younger brother.\n\nOn 24 June 1373 in Barcelona, John and Martha married. Afterwards she became the first to be titled Duchess of Girona and Countess of Cervera.\n\nMartha had a calm and conciliatory character, traits that would guarantee good terms with her new family and country; she had moderating influence on John, who had a character quite the opposite of her and deeply appreciated. Martha even got along well with her father-in-law who dealt with her with great affection, and in general all members of the royal family. Her mother-in-law Eleanor of Sicily treated Martha as her own daughter. On Eleanor's death King Peter remarried to Sibila of Fortia, a marriage that caused great scandal. However, Martha and Sibila maintained a cordial relationship, but John had a bad attitude to his stepmother.[citation needed]\n\nIssue\n\nJohn and Martha had five children:\n\nInfante James of Aragon (b. Valencia 24 June 1374 - d. Valencia 1374)\n\nInfanta Joanna (b. Daroca October 1375 - d. Valencia September 1407), who married on 4 June 1392 at Barcelona to Mathieu, Count of Foix. Together they claimed the throne of Aragon after her father's death. Matthew of Foix invaded Aragonese territories, but was driven back by the new King Martin. Joanna died soon after, childless.\n\nInfante John of Aragon (b. and d. Barcelona July 1376)\n\nInfante Alfonso of Aragon (b. and d. 1377)\n\nInfanta Eleanor of Aragon (b. and d. 1378)\n\nOf their five children, only one daughter Joanna lived to adulthood but she had no children so Martha's lineage died out in 1407 on the death of her daughter."
