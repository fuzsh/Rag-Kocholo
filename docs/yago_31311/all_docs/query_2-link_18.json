        "text": "Ancestors of:\n\nMatilda Edith Atheling, Princess of Scotland\n\n1079-1118\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Matilda Edith Atheling, Princess of Scotland, daughter of Malcolm III Canmore \"Bighead\", King of Scots 1058-1093 and Saint Margaret Atheling, Queen of Scotland , was born in 1079 in Dunfemline, Fifeshire, Scotland, died on 1 May 1118 in Westminster Palace, Middlesex, London, England, at age 39, and was buried in Jun 1118 in Westminster Abbey, Middlesex, London, England.\n\nMatilda married Henry I \"Beauclerc\", King of England, son of William I \"The Conqueror\", King of England and Maud \"Matilda\" de Flanders, Countess of Flanders & Normandy, Queen of England , on 11 Nov 1100 in Westminster Abbey, Middlesex, London, England. Henry was born in Sep 1068 in Selby, Yorkshire, England, died on 1 Dec 1135 in St Denis-Le-Fermont, Near Gisors, at age 67, and was buried on 4 Jan 1136 in Reading Abbey, Berkshire, England.\n\nHENRY I\n\nb. 1068 1\n\nd. 1 Dec 1135, Lyons-la-Forï¿½t, Normandy\n\nTitle: By the Grace of God, King of the English (Dei Gracia Rex Anglorum)2 Reign: 5 Aug 1100 - 1 Dec 1135 Chronology: 3 Aug 1100, a meeting of magnates at Winchester chose Henry king3 5 Aug 1100, crowned, Westminster Abbey 1 Dec 1135, died Other names/titles: Count Henry (sometimes styled \"comte du Cotentin\") [created count between 1 Jan and 30 Mar 1088]; Duke of the Normans [after 28 Sep 1106]; byname: Henri Beauclerc\n\nThe fourth and youngest son of William the Conqueror, Henry inherited only a sum of money after the death of his father in 1087. Later Henry acquired small land possessions in Normandy and was created count by his brother Robert II \"Curthose\", duke of the Normans.\n\nHenry stayed at the court of his brother, King William II Rufus, when the latter was killed while hunting (2 Aug 1100). Henry immediately rode to Winchester, where the royal treasury was turned over to him. He was anointed three days later by Maurice, Bishop of London. The throne of England was also claimed by Robert of Normandy, who invaded England in July 1101, but no battle was fought. During a personal interview, Robert gave up his claim to the throne and released Henry from the homage in exchange for a large annuity and Henry's lands in Normandy. However, the misgovernment of Robert in Normandy provided Henry with a pretext to conquer the duchy. The war in Normandy broke out in 1106 and culminated in the Battle of Tinchebray (28 Sep 1106). Robert was defeated and was taken prisoner for the rest of his life (27 years). Since then Henry assumed the ducal title and spent most of his reign in Normandy. In 1107 Henry reached an agreement with the Church settling the investiture controversy, which troubled his reign from the very beginning. In the next decade the local law and institutions of Saxon England, and the royal law and central institutions of the Normans, were merged. Henry centralized the administration of England and Normandy in the royal court, using \"viceroys\" in Normandy and a group of advisers in England to act on his behalf when he was absent across the Channel4. On 25 Nov 1120 Henry's only legitimate son, William the ï¿½theling, perished in a shipwreck of the \"White Ship\". Henry faced a succession problem, but finally succeeded in persuading the barons to accept his daughter, Matilda, as heir to the throne (January 1127). In hopes of adding Angevin lands to the royal domain, Henry had Matilda married (8 Jun 1129) to to the heir of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, Geoffroi \"Plantagenï¿½t\" (future count of Anjou). In 1135 Henry scattered the forces of Norman barons instigated to revolt by his son-in-law. He died reportedly of food poisoning caused by a surfeit of lampreys according to \"Historia Anglorum\" of Henry of Huntingdon.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Most likely, Henry was born between mid-May and early September 1068, but there is a bare possibility that it happened in 1069. A local tradition places his birth at Selby, Yorkshire, England, but no contemporary writer confirms that belief or provides a hint as to Henry's exact birthplace.\n\n2 Henry I introduced his charters indiscriminately as \"Henricus rex Anglorum\" (most frequently), but also as \"Henricus rex Anglie\". From 1121 Henry I altered the legend on the reverse of his seal to HENRICUS DEI GRACIA DUX NORMANNORUM, although he rarely styled himself more than \"rex Anglorum\" even in documents relating to Normandy. The words \"dei gracia\" (\"By the Grace of God\") appearing on the Great Seal since the time of William II, were not, as a rule, added to the style of the king in charters and writs until the reign of Henry II.\n\n3 This meeting, described by the Saxon chronicler as a rump witan, had no authority to elect Henry, but rather conceded to making him king. Henry immediately proceeded with appointing William Giffard as Bishop of Winchester, but despite this exercise of royal authority before the coronation, Henry counted his reign from 5 Aug 1100, when he was crowned at Westminster.\n\n4 Absent from England: autumn 1104; spring - summer 1105; Jul 1106 - Mar/Apr 1107; Jul 1108 - May/Jun 1109; Aug 1111 - Jul 1113; Sep 1114 - Jul 1115; Apr 1116 - 26 Nov 1120; 11 Jun 1123 - 11 Sep 1126; 26 Aug 1127 - 15 Jul 1129; Aug/Sep 1130 - Aug 1131; Aug 1133 to his death.\n\nSource: text: Handbook of British Chronology, 3rd ed., 1986; \"Henry I\", by C.

Matilda \"Beauclerc\", Empress of Germany, Queen of England (born on 7 Feb 1102 Royal Palace In Sutton Courtenay (Berkshire) - died on 10 Sep 1169 in Notre Dame, Rouen, Seine Inferieure, France)\n\nMATILDA\n\nb. c. 7 Feb 1102, Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire, England\n\nd. 10 Sep 1167, Notre-Dame-du-Prï¿½, near Rouen, France\n\nTitle: Lady of the English (Anglorum Domina)1 Reign: 8 Apr 1141 - Feb 1148 Chronology: 3 Mar 1141, proclaimed Lady of the English, ceremony at the Winchester Cathedral 8 Apr 1141, a clerical council at Winchester confirmed Matilda as Lady of the English Feb 1148, departed from England Other names/titles: Also known as: Maud, Mold, Aethelic, Aaliz (last two forms appear in the \"English Chronicle\" and in the works of John of Hexham); the Empress Matilda2; Queen of the Romans (Romanorum Regina) [from 25 Jul 1110];\n\nThe only daughter of King Henry I and Edith (Matilda) of Scotland, Matilda was formally betrothed to Heinrich V, King of the Germans, at Utrecht on 10 Apr 1110. She was crowned Queen of the Germans at Mainz (25 Jul 1110) and their marriage was celebrated at Worms on 6 Jan 1114. After the death of Heinrich V (23 May 1125), she was recalled to her father's court, who obtained of the English baronage an oath to accept Matilda as sovereign if he should die without a male heir (January 1127). On 8 Jun 1129 Matilda was married to the heir of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, Geoffroi \"Plantagenï¿½t\" (future count of Anjou).\n\nMatilda opposed her cousin, Stephen of Blois, who seized the throne of England after the death of Matilda's father (1135), and in 1139 she and her illegitimate half-brother, Robert earl of Gloucester, landed in England. In an ensuing war with Stephen the latter was captured after a battle at Lincoln (2 Feb 1141). Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester and papal legate, transferred his support from Stephen to Matilda and on 2 Mar 1141 he received Matilda as \"Lady of the English\" or \"Lady of England\" outside the gates of Winchester. The following day, 3 Mar 1141, Matilda was publicly welcomed in Winchester Cathedral and received the keys to the Treasury and the Royal Crown. The legate then summoned a \"legatine church council\", which met on 7 Apr 1141 and on the next day proclaimed Matilda \"Angliae Normanniaeque domina\". She entered London in June 1141, but alienated its citizens with her arrogance and demands for a large subsidy. A sudden uprising of the city forced her to flee to Oxford before she could be crowned. Her forces were routed at Winchester in September 1141, and Robert of Gloucester was captured by the forces of Stephen. Matilda was obliged to swap Stephen for Robert (1 Nov 1141) and the warfare continued. In 1148, after the death of Robert (31 Oct 1147), Matilda finally returned to Normandy. Late in 1150 her son, Henry (future King Henry II), was put in possession of the duchy of Normandy and replaced his mother as claimant to the throne of England.\n\nMatilda Time Line\n\nEvents of the Reign\n\n1141\n\n1102 - Born, daughter of Henry I and Edith (Matilda) of Scotland. 1120 - Matilda's brother, William, and heir to Henry I's throne, dies with the sinking of the White Ship on a return trip from France. 1125 - Matilda's first husband, Emperor Henry V of Germany dies. Henry recalls her back to England. 1126 - After the death of Maitlda's brother, Henry I makes the Barons swear to support Matilda as Queen. 1128 - Somewhat against her will Matilda marries Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, he was then only 16 years old and Matilda was approx. 25-26 years old. Her father hoped this would continue the Angevin alliance. Their son later becomes Henry II King of England. 1135 - Matilda's father, Henry I dies of food poisoning. The barons transfer their support to Matilda's cousin Stephen. 1135-1148 - She spends most of her time trying to gain the throne from her cousin Stephen. See Stephen's Time Line for more information on Matilda's fight for the throne.\n\n1167 - Matilda dies in Normandy.\n\nSecond Generation\n\n2. Malcolm III Canmore \"Bighead\" King of Scots 1058-1093, son of Duncan I \"the Gracious\", King of Scots 1034-1040 and Aelflaed (Sybil), of Northumbria , was born in 1031 in Atholl, Perthshire, Scotland, died on 13 Nov 1093 in Battle Near Alnwick, Northumberland, England, at age 62, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Dumferline, Fifeshire, Scotland.\n\nMalcolm married Saint Margaret Atheling, Queen of Scotland in 1068 in Dunfermline Abbey, Fifeshire, Scotland.\n\nChildren:\n\n1 i. Matilda Edith Atheling, Princess of Scotland (born in 1079 Dunfemline, Fifeshire, Scotland - died on 1 May 1118 in Westminster Palace, Middlesex, London, England)\n\nii. David I \"the Saint\", King of Scots 1124-1153 (born in 1080 Canmore, Scotland - died on 24 May 1153 in Carlisle, Cumberland, England)\n\n3. Saint Margaret Atheling, Queen of Scotland, daughter of Edward \"The Outlaw\" Atheling and Agatha , Princess of Hungary , was born on 8 Sep 1045 in Castle Reka, Mecseknadasd, Hungary, died on 16 Nov 1093 in Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland, at age 48, and was buried in Dunfemline, Fifeshire, Scotland.\n\nMargaret married Malcolm III Canmore \"Bighead\" , King of Scots 1058-1093 in 1068 in Dunfermline Abbey, Fifeshire, Scotland.\n\nIn the year 1054 twenty-three year old Malcolm returned to Scotland, after a period in hiding in England from the ruthless King Macbeth. He had come back to Scotland to reclaim the throne from Macbeth, who had taken it from his father, King Duncan, in 1040.\n\nMalcolm and his army defeated Macbeth twice in battle; the second time at Lumphanan, where Macbeth and his son were both killed, leaving the throne for anyone with royal connections to take. Malcolm was crowned king on 25th April 1058.\n\nKing Malcolm III had only been on the throne of Scotland for a short time when he sent troops to raid, loot and destroy the villages of Northumbria. This act of force was a shock and a blow to England, since King Edward the Confessor of England had helped Malcolm gain the Scottish throne in the first place.\n\nMalcolm's aim, and life-long personal ambition, was to conquer northern England. His strikes were initially successful and many innocent people lost their money and their homes. In spite of the attacks, however, England retained control in the north.\n\nThe Coming of the Normans.\n\nOnly seven years later further events in the north caused the downfall of the English King. Harold Hardrada, King of Norway attempted to take over Northumbria and Malcolm decided to help the Norwegians. This was partly because his (first) wife was related to Harold Hardrada, and partly because he wanted a share of Northumbria.\n\nEdward the Confessor had died at the end of 1065 and Harold Godwinson had taken the throne, to the fury of William, Duke of Normandy, who had understood from his kinsman, Edward, that he would succeed him. In fact, when Harold Godwinson had been blown off course during a storm in the English Channel in 1064 William had made Harold promise to support Williamï¿½s claim to the throne as the price for his freedom.\n\nWhen the King of England heard about the Norse invasion, he marched his army northwards. The English defeated the Norwegians, but were forced to return to the south immediately because an invasion force led by Duke William had landed.\n\nHarold met William at Hastings where in a great battle the King of England was fatally wounded. According to the Bayeux Tapestry, Harold was killed either by an arrow piercing his eye or by the sword of a Norman knight. William marched to Westminster Abbey where he crowned himself King of England.\n\nThis event is known as the Norman Conquest; it changed the course of British history. Many Saxons fled north to Scotland after the arrival of the Normans. Among these were Edgar Atheling, last of King Alfredï¿½s line, and his sister Margaret.\n\nIn 1070 Malcolm married Margaret, Edgar's sister, in Dunfermline and in the same year he invaded England. This was partly so that he could help his brother-in-law, Edgar Atheling gain control of the English throne, but mainly because he wanted to extend his Kingdom. Through Margaret, his second wife, he had a slight, but positive claim to the throne of England. (This was because Edgar and Margaret were the grandchildren of King Edmund Ironside of England.)\n\nThis meant that Malcolm could try to become the King of both Scotland and England. When William discovered Malcolm's link to royalty, he knew he must crush any such ideas of Malcolmï¿½s. William marched an army up to Scotland in 1072 and met the king of Scotland at Stirling. Edgar Atheling abandoned Canmore and fled to Flanders in Belgium. When Malcolm saw the size of William's army, he promised that he would not hurt, or encroach on, the English or their kingdom. He also made the decision to pay homage to the Monarch of England. This decision was to have fateful consequences for the independence of Scotland in later, even more dangerous times.\n\nFor about seven years, Malcolm kept to his promise. For no known reason though, in 1079 he once more invaded the north of England. He viciously attacked Northumberland in Scottish style, which meant that Northumberland was savagely torn apart. In the following year the Normans again attacked Scotland. They decided to build a castle over the river Tyne for more protection, and to stand watch against further Scottish attacks. Malcolm was then, of course reminded of his peace agreement, and pledged to keep it for another twelve years.\n\nQueen Margaret (St. Margaret)\n\nWhilst all of this was taking place, Malcolm's wife Margaret put all of her time and effort as wife and Queen of Scotland into religion and into creating a more civilised court in Scotland. Intelligent and very religious, she was determined to modernise Scotland by introducing ideas from England and Europe.\n\n1. She brought softness to the harsh kingdom of the north by copying some of the ways of the Normans. She introduced spiced meats and French wines; lovely tapestries and rich clothes; dancing and singing of ballads. 2. She taught the priests to live simply and without wealth, giving their whole lives to Christian belief. 3. She made Sunday into a day of worship. 4. Around the time of 1070 she invited three English Benedictine monks from Canterbury to build a monastery at Dunfermline. This was the start of monasteries in Scotland. The monks brought with them new skills in farming and building. 5. She built a new chapel in Edinburgh Castle, in Norman style. It is the oldest standing church in Scotland today. St. Margaret spent many hours there in prayer. 6. She gave large sums of money and land to the Church to help the poor 7. Margaret also launched the Queen's Ferry over the Firth of Forth to St. Andrews.\n\nHer life of charity and kindness impressed the rough and ambitious King Malcolm so much that he supported his wife's good works. He allowed his wealth to be donated to charity and on one occasion he fed three hundred needy subjects in his royal hall.\n\nBefore the twelve-year peace agreement that he had made with the Normans had expired Malcolm Canmore launched another invasion of northern England, in 1091. He chose a time when William the Conqueror's son William Rufus, who had by this time succeeded his father, was not in Britain, but Normandy.\n\nEdgar Atheling returned from Belgium to take part in the invasion. Even although Malcolm Canmore had pledged to help Atheling regain the English throne, he was much more interested in putting his own family on the throne. However, the English repulsed the Scottish invasion and for the third time Malcolm made a peace agreement. The English built a castle at Carlisle to patrol the border.\n\nYou would have thought that the invasion attempts would have stopped then, but they didn't as in 1093 Canmore once more attacked England. But he was killed during the raid and his son died also from wounds received. When the news reached poor Margaret she was already very sick with a terminal illness; she died four days later.\n\nMalcolm's life as a King was nothing more than a reckless baron robber. He never did help his brother-in-law succeed to the English throne. In fact he didn't even have any success for himself. Again and again he would try to invade England, but he never really achieved anything. The excuse Canmore gave for continually invading England was to advance his brother in lawï¿½s claim. But in-fact Canmore was nothing more than a greedy, vicious tyrant. He cared about nothing apart from doing things for his own gain.\n\nThey were such an unlikely couple; Margaret was loving and caring, she was often called Saint Margaret. He was dangerous and duplicitous, nothing like his gentle wife. No matter how much Margaret tried to convert her husband from his wrong doings, she never succeeded. Margaret led a successful life in the church, while Malcolm tried, brutally, to gain control and power over his brother-in-law's homeland. Margaret was interested in helping others and she did a lot of work in the church. Malcolm on the other hand, was greedy and a tyrant. Two separate lives, in two separate worlds, brought together by fate.\n\nThe history department at Fortrose Academy\n\nThird Generation\n\n4.

He was driven into hiding by a Viking raid into Wessex, led by the Dane, Guthorm, and took refuge in the Athelney marshes in Somerset. There, he recovered sufficient strength to be able to defeat the Danes decisively at the Battle of Eddington. As a condition of the peace treaty which followed, Guthorm received Christian baptism and withdrew his forces from Wessex, with Alfred recognizing the Danish control over East Anglia and parts of Mercia. This partition of England, called the \"Danelaw\", was formalized by another treaty in 886.\n\nAlfred created a series of fortifications to surround his kingdom and provide needed security from invasion. The Anglo-Saxon word for these forts, \"burhs\", has come down to us in the common place-name suffix, \"bury.\" He also constructed a fleet of ships to augment his other defenses, and in so doing became known as the \"Father of the English Navy.\" The reign of Alfred was known for more than military success. He was a codifier of law, a promoter of education and a suppor|er of the arts. He, himself, was a scholar and translated Latin books into the Anglo-Saxon tongue.

Kenneth I mac Alpin, King of Alba 841-859, son of Alpin mac Eochaid, King of Dalriada 839-841, was born about 810 in Gaelic Kingdom of Dal Riata Scotland and died on 6 Feb 859 in Fortevoit, Tayside, Scotland, about age 49.\n\nConstantine mac Aed, King of Alba 900-943\n\nConstantine mac Aed (Constantine II), the grandson of Kenneth MacAlpine, began his life as an exile. In 878 AD his father, Aed, had been slain by a Giric, son of Dungal, and Constantine, a young boy at the time, fled to Ireland where he was brought up by monks surrounded in Gaelic culture.\n\nIn 889 AD he returned with his cousin Domnall to wreak revenge on Giric. Domnall took the kingship of the Picts initially, but shortly afterwards was slain by the Vikings - Dark Age kingships were often painfully short! So it was that in his early twenties, Constantine mac Aed became King of Pictland.\n\nThe kingdom had been nearly destroyed by the Vikings, but its peoples, Picts and Gael, faced with the prospect of Viking conquest, had drawn together. In 902 AD, the Vikings, under Ivar the Younger of Dublin, returned to seize Dunkeld, where St Columbaï¿½s relics were kept, and the rich farmlands around the River Tay. Constantine caught up with Ivar at Strathcarron in 904 AD, and, in a bitter struggle, Ivar and his Viking army were massacred.\n\nWith the defeat of the Vikings, regeneration of the kingdom was Constantineï¿½s top priority. He remodelled the church along Gaelic lines and brought in a system of mormaers (earls) to defend the kingdom more efficiently. He also renamed the territory, Alba, which is actually means Britain in Gaelic. Pictland was remade in a Gaelic image and the Scottish nation was launched.\n\nConstantine continued to extend Albaï¿½s influence across Scotland. The east coast, south of the river Forth and modern-day Edinburgh, was Angle territory and often very hostile at that, until 918 AD, when Constantine led his army into Northumbria. At the Battle of Corbridge, he forced Ragnall, the Viking King of York, to withdraw from the Angle earldom of Northumbria that stretched from Lothian to the Tyne. In return the restored earl, Eadred, recognised Constantine as his overlord. For the first time much of the land in modern-day Scotland was either under the direct kingship of the King of Alba or was under his rule as overlord.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/history\n\nChildren:\n\n288 i. Constantine I, King of Alba 863-977 (born about 836 Inverdoval, Fife, Scotland - died in 877 in Black Cove, Angus, Scotland in battle with the Danes)\n\n768. ï¿½thelwulf, King of Wessex, son of Ecgbert III, King of Wessex and Redburga (Raedburg), Queen of Wessex was born in 800 in Wessex, England, died on 13 Jan 858 in England, at age 58, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral, London, England.\n\nï¿½thelwulf (839-58 AD)\n\nï¿½thelwulf was the son of Egbert and a sub-king of Kent. He assumed the throne of Wessex upon his father's death in 839. His reign is characterized by the usual Viking invasions and repulsions common to all English rulers of the time, but the making of war was not his chief claim to fame.\n\nï¿½thelwulf is remembered, however dimly, as a highly religious man who cared about the establishment and preservation of the church. He was also a wealthy man and controlled vast resources. Out of these resources, he gave generously, to Rome and to religious houses that were in need.\n\nHe was an only child, but had fathered five sons, by his first wife, Osburga. He recognized that there could be difficulties with contention over the succession. He devised a scheme which would guarantee (insofar as it was possible to do so) that each child would have his turn on the throne without having to worry about rival claims from his siblings.\n\nï¿½thelwulf provided that the oldest living child would succeed to the throne and would control all the resources of the crown, without having them divided among the others, so that he would have adequate resources to rule. That he was able to provide for the continuation of his dynasty is a matter of record, but he was not able to guarantee familial harmony with his plan. This is proved by what we know of the foul plottings of his son, ï¿½thelbald, while ï¿½thelwulf was on pilgrimage to Rome in 855.\n\nï¿½thelwulf was a wise and capable ruler, whose vision made possible the beneficial reign of his youngest son, Alfred the Great.\n\nEthelwulf left the kingdom to his eldest son Ethelbald and went on pilgrimage to Rome taking with him his youngest son Alfred. They were received by Pope Leo IV who confirmed Alfred2. Whilst returning, they stopped at the court of King Charles the Bald of the Franks where Ethelwulf took Charles' 12 year old daughter as his second wife. She was later to marry her step-son Ethelbald.\n\nï¿½thelwulf married Osburga of Isle of Wight in 830.\n\nChildren:\n\n384 i.
