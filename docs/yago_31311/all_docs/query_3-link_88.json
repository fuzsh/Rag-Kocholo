Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?\n\nInvocation to the Muse\n\nI sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate, first came from the coast of Troy to Italy, and to Lavinian shores – hurled about endlessly by land and sea, by the will of the gods, by cruel Juno's remorseless anger, long suffering also in war, until he founded a city and brought his gods to Latium: from that the Latin people came, the lords of Alba Longa, the walls of noble Rome. Muse, tell me the cause: how was she offended in her divinity, how was she grieved, the Queen of Heaven, to drive a man, noted for virtue, to endure such dangers, to face so many trials? Can there be such anger in the minds of the gods?

Et quisquam numen Iunonis adoret\n\npraeterea, aut supplex aris imponet honorem?' The Anger of Juno\n\nThere was an ancient city, Carthage (held by colonists from Tyre), opposite Italy, and the far-off mouths of the Tiber, rich in wealth, and very savage in pursuit of war. They say Juno loved this one land above all others, even neglecting Samos: here were her weapons and her chariot, even then the goddess worked at, and cherished, the idea that it should have supremacy over the nations, if only the fates allowed. Yet she'd heard of offspring, derived from Trojan blood, that would one day overthrow the Tyrian stronghold: that from them a people would come, wide-ruling, and proud in war, to Libya's ruin: so the Fates ordained. Fearing this, and remembering the ancient war she had fought before, at Troy, for her dear Argos, (and the cause of her anger and bitter sorrows had not yet passed from her mind: the distant judgement of Paris stayed deep in her heart, the injury to her scorned beauty, her hatred of the race, and abducted Ganymede's honours) the daughter of Saturn, incited further by this, hurled the Trojans, the Greeks and pitiless Achilles had left, round the whole ocean, keeping them far from Latium: they wandered for many years, driven by fate over all the seas. Such an effort it was to found the Roman people. They were hardly out of sight of Sicily's isle, in deeper water, joyfully spreading sail, bronze keel ploughing the brine, when Juno, nursing the eternal wound in her breast, spoke to herself: 'Am I to abandon my purpose, conquered, unable to turn the Teucrian king away from Italy! Why, the fates forbid it. Wasn't Pallas able to burn the Argive fleet, to sink it in the sea, because of the guilt and madness of one single man, Ajax, son of Oileus? She herself hurled Jupiter's swift fire from the clouds, scattered the ships, and made the sea boil with storms: She caught him up in a water-spout, as he breathed flame from his pierced chest, and pinned him to a sharp rock: yet I, who walk about as queen of the gods, wife and sister of Jove, wage war on a whole race, for so many years. Indeed, will anyone worship Juno's power from now on, or place offerings, humbly, on her altars?' Lines 50-80\n\nTalia flammato secum dea corde uolutans 50\n\nnimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus austris,\n\nAeoliam uenit. Hic uasto rex Aeolus antro\n\nluctantes uentos tempestatesque sonoras\n\nimperio premit ac uinclis et carcere frenat.\n\nIlli indignantes magno cum murmure montis 55\n\ncircum claustra fremunt; celsa sedet Aeolus arce\n\nsceptra tenens, mollitque animos et temperat iras.\n\nNi faciat, maria ac terras caelumque profundum\n\nquippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per auras.\n\nSed pater omnipotens speluncis abdidit atris, 60\n\nhoc metuens, molemque et montis insuper altos\n\nimposuit, regemque dedit, qui foedere certo\n\net premere et laxas sciret dare iussus habenas.\n\nAd quem tum Iuno supplex his uocibus usa est:\n\n'Aeole, namque tibi diuom pater atque hominum rex 65\n\net mulcere dedit fluctus et tollere uento,\n\ngens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum nauigat aequor,\n\nIlium in Italiam portans uictosque Penates:\n\nincute uim uentis submersasque obrue puppes,\n\naut age diuersos et disiice corpora ponto. 70\n\nSunt mihi bis septem praestanti corpore nymphae,\n\nquarum quae forma pulcherrima Deiopea,\n\nconubio iungam stabili propriamque dicabo,\n\nomnis ut tecum meritis pro talibus annos\n\nexigat, et pulchra faciat te prole parentem.' 75\n\nAeolus haec contra: 'Tuus, O regina, quid optes\n\nexplorare labor; mihi iussa capessere fas est.\n\nTu mihi, quodcumque hoc regni, tu sceptra Iouemque\n\nconcilias, tu das epulis accumbere diuom,\n\nnimborumque facis tempestatumque potentem.' 80 Juno Asks Aeolus for Help\n\nSo debating with herself, her heart inflamed, the goddess came to Aeolia, to the country of storms, the place of wild gales. Here in his vast cave, King Aeolus, keeps the writhing winds, and the roaring tempests, under control, curbs them with chains and imprisonment. They moan angrily at the doors, with a mountain's vast murmurs: Aeolus sits, holding his sceptre, in his high stronghold, softening their passions, tempering their rage: if not, they'd surely carry off seas and lands and the highest heavens, with them, in rapid flight, and sweep them through the air. But the all-powerful Father, fearing this, hid them in dark caves, and piled a high mountain mass over them and gave them a king, who by fixed agreement, would know how to give the order to tighten or slacken the reins. Juno now offered these words to him, humbly: 'Aeolus, since the Father of gods, and king of men, gave you the power to quell, and raise, the waves with the winds, there is a people I hate sailing the Tyrrhenian Sea, bringing Troy's conquered gods to Italy: Add power to the winds, and sink their wrecked boats, or drive them apart, and scatter their bodies over the sea. I have fourteen Nymphs of outstanding beauty: of whom I'll name Deiopea, the loveliest in looks, joined in eternal marriage, and yours for ever, so that, for such service to me as yours, she'll spend all her years with you, and make you the father of lovely children.' Aeolus replied: 'Your task, O queen, is to decide what you wish: my duty is to fulfil your orders. You brought about all this kingdom of mine, the sceptre, Jove's favour, you gave me a seat at the feasts of the gods, and you made me lord of the storms and the tempests.' Lines 81-123\n\nHaec ubi dicta, cauum conuersa cuspide montem\n\nimpulit in latus: ac uenti, uelut agmine facto,\n\nqua data porta, ruunt et terras turbine perflant.\n\nIncubuere mari, totumque a sedibus imis\n\nuna Eurusque Notusque ruunt creberque procellis 85\n\nAfricus, et uastos uoluunt ad litora fluctus.\n\nInsequitur clamorque uirum stridorque rudentum.\n\nEripiunt subito nubes caelumque diemque\n\nTeucrorum ex oculis; ponto nox incubat atra.\n\nIntonuere poli, et crebris micat ignibus aether, 90\n\npraesentemque uiris intentant omnia mortem.\n\nExtemplo Aeneae soluuntur frigore membra:\n\ningemit, et duplicis tendens ad sidera palmas\n\ntalia uoce refert: 'O terque quaterque beati,\n\nquis ante ora patrum Troiae sub moenibus altis 95\n\ncontigit oppetere!

Aeolus Raises the Storm\n\nWhen he had spoken, he reversed his trident and struck the hollow mountain on the side: and the winds, formed ranks, rushed out by the door he'd made, and whirled across the earth. They settle on the sea, East and West wind, and the wind from Africa, together, thick with storms, stir it all from its furthest deeps, and roll vast waves to shore: follows a cry of men and a creaking of cables. Suddenly clouds take sky and day away from the Trojan's eyes: dark night rests on the sea. It thunders from the pole, and the aether flashes thick fire, and all things threaten immediate death to men. Instantly Aeneas groans, his limbs slack with cold: stretching his two hands towards the heavens, he cries out in this voice: 'Oh, three, four times fortunate were those who chanced to die in front of their father's eyes under Troy's high walls! O Diomede, son of Tydeus bravest of Greeks! Why could I not have fallen, at your hand, in the fields of Ilium, and poured out my spirit, where fierce Hector lies, beneath Achilles's spear, and mighty Sarpedon: where Simois rolls, and sweeps away so many shields, helmets, brave bodies, of men, in its waves!' Hurling these words out, a howling blast from the north, strikes square on the sail, and lifts the seas to heaven: the oars break: then the prow swings round and offers the beam to the waves: a steep mountain of water follows in a mass. Some ships hang on the breaker's crest: to others the yawning deep shows land between the waves: the surge rages with sand. The south wind catches three, and whirls them onto hidden rocks (rocks the Italians call the Altars, in mid-ocean, a vast reef on the surface of the sea) three the east wind drives from the deep, to the shallows and quick-sands (a pitiful sight), dashes them against the bottom, covers them with a gravel mound. A huge wave, toppling, strikes one astern, in front of his very eyes, one carrying faithful Orontes and the Lycians. The steersman's thrown out and hurled headlong, face down: but the sea turns the ship three times, driving her round, in place, and the swift vortex swallows her in the deep. Swimmers appear here and there in the vast waste, men's weapons, planking, Trojan treasure in the waves. Now the storm conquers Iloneus's tough ship, now Achates, now that in which Abas sailed, and old Aletes's: their timbers sprung in their sides, all the ships let in the hostile tide, and split open at the seams. Lines 124-156\n\nInterea magno misceri murmure pontum,\n\nemissamque hiemem sensit Neptunus, et imis 125\n\nstagna refusa uadis, grauiter commotus; et alto\n\nprospiciens, summa placidum caput extulit unda.\n\nDisiectam Aeneae, toto uidet aequore classem,\n\nfluctibus oppressos Troas caelique ruina,\n\nnec latuere doli fratrem Iunonis et irae. 130\n\nEurum ad se Zephyrumque uocat, dehinc talia fatur:\n\n'Tantane uos generis tenuit fiducia uestri?\n\nIam caelum terramque meo sine numine, uenti,\n\nmiscere, et tantas audetis tollere moles?\n\nQuos ego—sed motos praestat componere fluctus. 135\n\nPost mihi non simili poena commissa luetis.\n\nMaturate fugam, regique haec dicite uestro:\n\nnon illi imperium pelagi saeuumque tridentem,\n\nsed mihi sorte datum. Tenet ille immania saxa,\n\nuestras, Eure, domos; illa se iactet in aula 140\n\nAeolus, et clauso uentorum carcere regnet.'\n\nSic ait, et dicto citius tumida aequora placat,\n\ncollectasque fugat nubes, solemque reducit.\n\nCymothoe simul et Triton adnixus acuto\n\ndetrudunt nauis scopulo; leuat ipse tridenti; 145\n\net uastas aperit syrtis, et temperat aequor,\n\natque rotis summas leuibus perlabitur undas.\n\nAc ueluti magno in populo cum saepe coorta est\n\nseditio, saeuitque animis ignobile uolgus,\n\niamque faces et saxa uolant—furor arma ministrat; 150\n\ntum, pietate grauem ac meritis si forte uirum quem\n\nconspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant;\n\nille regit dictis animos, et pectora mulcet,—\n\nsic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor, aequora postquam\n\nprospiciens genitor caeloque inuectus aperto 155\n\nflectit equos, curruque uolans dat lora secundo. Neptune Intervenes\n\nNeptune, meanwhile, greatly troubled, saw that the sea was churned with vast murmur, and the storm was loose and the still waters welled from their deepest levels: he raised his calm face from the waves, gazing over the deep. He sees Aeneas's fleet scattered all over the ocean, the Trojans crushed by the breakers, and the plummeting sky. And Juno's anger, and her stratagems, do not escape her brother. He calls the East and West winds to him, and then says: 'Does confidence in your birth fill you so? Winds, do you dare, without my intent, to mix earth with sky, and cause such trouble, now? You whom I – ! But it's better to calm the running waves: you'll answer to me later for this misfortune, with a different punishment. Hurry, fly now, and say this to your king: control of the ocean, and the fierce trident, were given to me, by lot, and not to him. He owns the wild rocks, home to you, and yours, East Wind: let Aeolus officiate in his palace, and be king in the closed prison of the winds.' So he speaks, and swifter than his speech, he calms the swollen sea, scatters the gathered cloud, and brings back the sun. Cymothoë and Triton, working together, thrust the ships from the sharp reef: Neptune himself raises them with his trident, parts the vast quicksand, tempers the flood, and glides on weightless wheels, over the tops of the waves. As often, when rebellion breaks out in a great nation, and the common rabble rage with passion, and soon stones and fiery torches fly (frenzy supplying weapons), if they then see a man of great virtue, and weighty service, they are silent, and stand there listening attentively: he sways their passions with his words and soothes their hearts: so all the uproar of the ocean died, as soon as their father, gazing over the water, carried through the clear sky, wheeled his horses, and gave them their head, flying behind in his chariot. Lines 157-222\n\nDefessi Aeneadae, quae proxima litora, cursu\n\ncontendunt petere, et Libyae uertuntur ad oras.\n\nEst in secessu longo locus: insula portum\n\nefficit obiectu laterum, quibus omnis ab alto 160\n\nfrangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos.\n\nHinc atque hinc uastae rupes geminique minantur\n\nin caelum scopuli, quorum sub uertice late\n\naequora tuta silent; tum siluis scaena coruscis\n\ndesuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbra. 165\n\nFronte sub aduersa scopulis pendentibus antrum,\n\nintus aquae dulces uiuoque sedilia saxo,\n\nnympharum domus: hic fessas non uincula nauis\n\nulla tenent, unco non alligat ancora morsu.\n\nHuc septem Aeneas collectis nauibus omni 170\n\nex numero subit; ac magno telluris amore\n\negressi optata potiuntur Troes harena,\n\net sale tabentis artus in litore ponunt.\n\nAc primum silici scintillam excudit Achates,\n\nsuccepitque ignem foliis, atque arida circum 175\n\nnutrimenta dedit, rapuitque in fomite flammam.\n\nTum Cererem corruptam undis Cerealiaque arma\n\nexpediunt fessi rerum, frugesque receptas\n\net torrere parant flammis et frangere saxo.\n\nAeneas scopulum interea conscendit, et omnem 180\n\nprospectum late pelago petit, Anthea si quem\n\niactatum uento uideat Phrygiasque biremis,\n\naut Capyn, aut celsis in puppibus arma Caici.\n\nNauem in conspectu nullam, tris litore ceruos\n\nprospicit errantis; hos tota armenta sequuntur 185\n\na tergo, et longum per uallis pascitur agmen.\n\nConstitit hic, arcumque manu celerisque sagittas\n\ncorripuit, fidus quae tela gerebat Achates;\n\nductoresque ipsos primum, capita alta ferentis\n\ncornibus arboreis, sternit, tum uolgus, et omnem 190\n\nmiscet agens telis nemora inter frondea turbam;\n\nnec prius absistit, quam septem ingentia uictor\n\ncorpora fundat humi, et numerum cum nauibus aequet.\n\nHinc portum petit, et socios partitur in omnes.\n\nVina bonus quae deinde cadis onerarat Acestes 195\n\nlitore Trinacrio dederatque abeuntibus heros,\n\ndiuidit, et dictis maerentia pectora mulcet:\n\n'O socii—neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum—\n\nO passi grauiora, dabit deus his quoque finem.\n\nVos et Scyllaeam rabiem penitusque sonantis 200\n\naccestis scopulos, uos et Cyclopea saxa\n\nexperti: reuocate animos, maestumque timorem\n\nmittite: forsan et haec olim meminisse iuuabit.\n\nPer uarios casus, per tot discrimina rerum\n\ntendimus in Latium; sedes ubi fata quietas 205\n\nostendunt; illic fas regna resurgere Troiae.\n\nDurate, et uosmet rebus seruate secundis.'\n\nTalia uoce refert, curisque ingentibus aeger\n\nspem uoltu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem.\n\nIlli se praedae accingunt, dapibusque futuris; 210\n\ntergora deripiunt costis et uiscera nudant;\n\npars in frusta secant ueribusque trementia figunt;\n\nlitore aena locant alii, flammasque ministrant.\n\nTum uictu reuocant uires, fusique per herbam\n\nimplentur ueteris Bacchi pinguisque ferinae. 215\n\nPostquam exempta fames epulis mensaeque remotae,\n\namissos longo socios sermone requirunt,\n\nspemque metumque inter dubii, seu uiuere credant,\n\nsiue extrema pati nec iam exaudire uocatos.\n\nPraecipue pius Aeneas nunc acris Oronti, 220\n\nnunc Amyci casum gemit et crudelia secum\n\nfata Lyci, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum. Shelter on the Libyan Coast\n\nThe weary followers of Aeneas made efforts to set a course for the nearest land, and tacked towards the Libyan coast. There is a place there in a deep inlet: an island forms a harbour with the barrier of its bulk, on which every wave from the deep breaks, and divides into diminishing ripples. On this side and that, vast cliffs and twin crags loom in the sky, under whose summits the whole sea is calm, far and wide: then, above that, is a scene of glittering woods, and a dark grove overhangs the water, with leafy shade: under the headland opposite is a cave, curtained with rock, inside it, fresh water, and seats of natural stone, the home of Nymphs. No hawsers moor the weary ships here, no anchor, with its hooked flukes, fastens them. Aeneas takes shelter here with seven ships gathered from the fleet, and the Trojans, with a passion for dry land, disembarking, take possession of the sands they longed for, and stretch their brine-caked bodies on the shore. At once Achates strikes a spark from his flint, catches the fire in the leaves, places dry fuel round it, and quickly has flames among the kindling. Then, wearied by events, they take out wheat, damaged by the sea, and implements of Ceres, and prepare to parch the grain over the flames, and grind it on stone. Aeneas climbs a crag meanwhile, and searches the whole prospect far and wide over the sea, looking if he can see anything of Antheus and his storm-tossed Phrygian galleys, or Capys, or Caicus's arms blazoned on a high stern. There's no ship in sight: he sees three stags wandering on the shore: whole herds of deer follow at their back, and graze in long lines along the valley. He halts at this, and grasps in his hand his bow and swift arrows, shafts that loyal Achates carries, and first he shoots the leaders themselves, their heads, with branching antlers, held high, then the mass, with his shafts, and drives the whole crowd in confusion among the leaves: The conqueror does not stop until he's scattered seven huge carcasses on the ground, equal in number to his ships. Then he seeks the harbour, and divides them among all his friends. Next he shares out the wine that the good Acestes had stowed in jars, on the Trinacrian coast, and that hero had given them on leaving: and speaking to them, calmed their sad hearts: 'O friends (well, we were not unknown to trouble before) O you who've endured worse, the god will grant an end to this too. You've faced rabid Scylla, and her deep-sounding cliffs: and you've experienced the Cyclopes's rocks: remember your courage and chase away gloomy fears: perhaps one day you'll even delight in remembering this. Through all these misfortunes, these dangerous times, we head for Latium, where the fates hold peaceful lives for us: there Troy's kingdom can rise again. Endure, and preserve yourselves for happier days.' So his voice utters, and sick with the weight of care, he pretends hope, in his look, and stifles the pain deep in his heart. They make ready the game, and the future feast: they flay the hides from the ribs and lay the flesh bare: some cut it in pieces, quivering, and fix it on spits, others place cauldrons on the beach, and feed them with flames. Then they revive their strength with food, stretched on the grass, and fill themselves with rich venison and old wine. When hunger is quenched by the feast, and the remnants cleared, deep in conversation, they discuss their missing friends, and, between hope and fear, question whether they live, or whether they've suffered death and no longer hear their name. Aeneas, the virtuous, above all mourns the lot of fierce Orontes, then that of Amycus, together with Lycus's cruel fate, and those of brave Gyus, and brave Cloanthus.

And as he weighed such cares as he had in his heart, Venus spoke to him, sadder still, her bright eyes brimming with tears: 'Oh you who rule things human, and divine, with eternal law, and who terrify them all with your lightning-bolt, what can my Aeneas have done to you that's so serious, what have the Trojans done, who've suffered so much destruction, to whom the whole world's closed, because of the Italian lands? Surely you promised that at some point, as the years rolled by, the Romans would rise from them, leaders would rise, restored from Teucer's blood, who would hold power over the sea, and all the lands. Father, what thought has changed your mind? It consoled me for the fall of Troy, and its sad ruin, weighing one destiny, indeed, against opposing destinies: now the same misfortune follows these men driven on by such disasters. Great king, what end to their efforts will you give? Antenor could escape through the thick of the Greek army, and safely enter the Illyrian gulfs, and deep into the realms of the Liburnians, and pass the founts of Timavus, from which the river bursts, with a huge mountainous roar, through nine mouths, and buries the fields under its noisy flood. Here, nonetheless, he sited the city of Padua, and homes for Teucrians, and gave the people a name, and hung up the arms of Troy: now he's calmly settled, in tranquil peace. But we, your race, to whom you permit the heights of heaven, lose our ships (shameful!), betrayed, because of one person's anger, and kept far away from the shores of Italy. Is this the prize for virtue? Is this how you restore our rule? The father of men and gods, smiled at her with that look with which he clears the sky of storms, kissed his daughter's lips, and then said this: Lines 257-296\n\n'Parce metu, Cytherea: manent immota tuorum\n\nfata tibi; cernes urbem et promissa Lauini\n\nmoenia, sublimemque feres ad sidera caeli\n\nmagnanimum Aenean; neque me sententia uertit. 260\n\nHic tibi (fabor enim, quando haec te cura remordet,\n\nlongius et uoluens fatorum arcana mouebo)\n\nbellum ingens geret Italia, populosque feroces\n\ncontundet, moresque uiris et moenia ponet,\n\ntertia dum Latio regnantem uiderit aestas, 265\n\nternaque transierint Rutulis hiberna subactis.\n\nAt puer Ascanius, cui nunc cognomen Iulo\n\nadditur,—Ilus erat, dum res stetit Ilia regno,—\n\ntriginta magnos uoluendis mensibus orbis\n\nimperio explebit, regnumque ab sede Lauini 270\n\ntransferet, et longam multa ui muniet Albam.\n\nHic iam ter centum totos regnabitur annos\n\ngente sub Hectorea, donec regina sacerdos,\n\nMarte grauis, geminam partu dabit Ilia prolem.\n\nInde lupae fuluo nutricis tegmine laetus 275\n\nRomulus excipiet gentem, et Mauortia condet\n\nmoenia, Romanosque suo de nomine dicet.\n\nHis ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono;\n\nimperium sine fine dedi.

Jupiter's Prophecy\n\n'Don't be afraid, Cytherea, your child's fate remains unaltered: You'll see the city of Lavinium, and the walls I promised, and you'll raise great-hearted Aeneas high, to the starry sky: No thought has changed my mind. This son of yours (since this trouble gnaws at my heart, I'll speak, and unroll the secret scroll of destiny) will wage a mighty war in Italy, destroy proud peoples, and establish laws, and city walls, for his warriors, until a third summer sees his reign in Latium, and three winter camps pass since the Rutulians were beaten. But the boy Ascanius, surnamed Iulus now (He was Ilus while the Ilian kingdom was a reality) will imperially complete thirty great circles of the turning months, and transfer his throne from its site at Lavinium, and mighty in power, will build the walls of Alba Longa. Here kings of Hector's race will reign now for three hundred years complete, until a royal priestess, Ilia, heavy with child, shall bear Mars twins. Then Romulus will further the race, proud in his nurse the she-wolf's tawny pelt, and found the walls of Mars, and call the people Romans, from his own name. I've fixed no limits or duration to their possessions: I've given them empire without end. Why, harsh Juno who now torments land, and sea and sky with fear, will respond to better judgement, and favour the Romans, masters of the world, and people of the toga, with me. So it is decreed. A time will come, as the years glide by, when the Trojan house of Assaracus will force Phthia into slavery, and be lords of beaten Argos. From this glorious source a Trojan Caesar will be born, who will bound the empire with Ocean, his fame with the stars, Augustus, a Julius, his name descended from the great Iulus. You, no longer anxious, will receive him one day in heaven, burdened with Eastern spoils: he'll be called to in prayer. Then with wars abandoned, the harsh ages will grow mild: White haired Trust, and Vesta, Quirinus with his brother Remus will make the laws: the gates of War, grim with iron, and narrowed by bars, will be closed: inside impious Rage will roar frighteningly from blood-stained mouth, seated on savage weapons, hands tied behind his back, with a hundred knots of bronze.'

'Quaerenti talibus ille 370\n\nsuspirans, imoque trahens a pectore uocem: Venus Speaks to Aeneas\n\nSaying this, he sends Mercury, Maia's son, down from heaven, so that the country and strongholds of this new Carthage would open to the Trojans, as guests, and Dido, unaware of fate, would not keep them from her territory. He flies through the air with a beating of mighty wings and quickly lands on Libyan shore. And soon does as commanded, and the Phoenicians set aside their savage instincts, by the god's will: the queen above all adopts calm feelings, and kind thoughts, towards the Trojans. But Aeneas, the virtuous, turning things over all night, decides, as soon as kindly dawn appears, to go out and explore the place, to find what shores he has reached, on the wind, who owns them (since he sees desert) man or beast, and bring back the details to his friends. He conceals the boats in over-hanging woods under an arching cliff, enclosed by trees and leafy shadows: accompanied only by Achetes, he goes, swinging two broad-bladed spears in his hand. His mother met him herself, among the trees, with the face and appearance of a virgin, and a virgin's weapons, a Spartan girl, or such as Harpalyce of Thrace, who wearies horses, and outdoes winged Hebrus in flight. For she'd slung her bow from her shoulders, at the ready, like a huntress, and loosed her hair for the wind to scatter, her knees bare, and her flowing tunic gathered up in a knot. And she cried first: 'Hello, you young men, tell me, if you've seen my sister wandering here by any chance, wearing a quiver, and the hide of a dappled lynx, or shouting, hot on the track of a slavering boar?' So Venus: and so Venus's son began in answer: 'I've not seen or heard any of your sisters, O Virgin – or how should I name you? Since your looks are not mortal and your voice is more than human: oh, a goddess for certain! Or Phoebus's sister? Or one of the race of Nymphs? Be kind, whoever you may be, and lighten our labour, and tell us only what sky we're under, and what shores we've landed on: we're adrift here, driven by wind and vast seas, knowing nothing of the people or the country: many a sacrifice to you will fall at the altars, under our hand.' Then Venus said: 'I don't think myself worthy of such honours: it's the custom of Tyrian girls to carry a quiver, and lace our calves high up, over red hunting boots. You see the kingdom of Carthage, Tyrians, Agenor's city: but bordered by Libyans, a people formidable in war. Dido rules this empire, having set out from Tyre, fleeing her brother. It's a long tale of wrong, with many windings: but I'll trace the main chapters of the story. Sychaeus was her husband, wealthiest, in land, of Phoenicians and loved with a great love by the wretched girl, whose father gave her as a virgin to him, and wed them with great solemnity. But her brother Pygmalion, savage in wickedness beyond all others, held the kingdom of Tyre. Madness came between them. The king, blinded by greed for gold, killed the unwary Sychaeus, secretly, with a knife, impiously, in front of the altars, indifferent to his sister's affections. He concealed his actions for a while, deceived the lovesick girl, with empty hopes, and many evil pretences. But the ghost of her unburied husband came to her in dream: lifting his pale head in a strange manner, he laid bare the cruelty at the altars, and his heart pierced by the knife, and unveiled all the secret wickedness of that house. Then he urged her to leave quickly and abandon her country, and, to help her journey, revealed an ancient treasure under the earth, an unknown weight of gold and silver. Shaken by all this, Dido prepared her flight and her friends. Those who had fierce hatred of the tyrant or bitter fear, gathered together: they seized some ships that by chance were ready, and loaded the gold: greedy Pygmalion's riches are carried overseas: a woman leads the enterprise. The came to this place, and bought land, where you now see the vast walls, and resurgent stronghold, of new Carthage, as much as they could enclose with the strips of hide from a single bull, and from that they called it Byrsa. But who then are you? What shores do you come from? What course do you take?' He sighed as she questioned him, and drawing the words from deep in his heart he replied: Lines 372-417\n\n'O dea, si prima repetens ab origine pergam,\n\net uacet annalis nostrorum audire laborum,\n\nante diem clauso componat Vesper Olympo.\n\nNos Troia antiqua, si uestras forte per auris 375\n\nTroiae nomen iit, diuersa per aequora uectos\n\nforte sua Libycis tempestas adpulit oris.\n\nSum pius Aeneas, raptos qui ex hoste Penates\n\nclasse ueho mecum, fama super aethera notus.\n\nItaliam quaero patriam et genus ab Ioue summo. 380\n\nBis denis Phrygium conscendi nauibus aequor,\n\nmatre dea monstrante uiam, data fata secutus;\n\nuix septem conuolsae undis Euroque supersunt.\n\nIpse ignotus, egens, Libyae deserta peragro,\n\nEuropa atque Asia pulsus.' Nec plura querentem 385\n\npassa Venus medio sic interfata dolore est:\n\n'Quisquis es, haud, credo, inuisus caelestibus auras\n\nuitalis carpis, Tyriam qui adueneris urbem.\n\nPerge modo, atque hinc te reginae ad limina perfer,\n\nNamque tibi reduces socios classemque relatam 390\n\nnuntio, et in tutum uersis aquilonibus actam,\n\nni frustra augurium uani docuere parentes.\n\nAspice bis senos laetantis agmine cycnos,\n\naetheria quos lapsa plaga Iouis ales aperto\n\nturbabat caelo; nunc terras ordine longo 395\n\naut capere, aut captas iam despectare uidentur:\n\nut reduces illi ludunt stridentibus alis,\n\net coetu cinxere polum, cantusque dedere,\n\nhaud aliter puppesque tuae pubesque tuorum\n\naut portum tenet aut pleno subit ostia uelo. 400\n\nPerge modo, et, qua te ducit uia, dirige gressum.'\n\nDixit, et auertens rosea ceruice refulsit,\n\nambrosiaeque comae diuinum uertice odorem\n\nspirauere, pedes uestis defluxit ad imos,\n\net uera incessu patuit dea. Ille ubi matrem 405\n\nadgnouit, tali fugientem est uoce secutus:\n\n'Quid natum totiens, crudelis tu quoque, falsis\n\nludis imaginibus? Cur dextrae iungere dextram\n\nnon datur, ac ueras audire et reddere uoces?'\n\nTalibus incusat, gressumque ad moenia tendit: 410\n\nat Venus obscuro gradientes aere saepsit,\n\net multo nebulae circum dea fudit amictu,\n\ncernere ne quis eos, neu quis contingere posset,\n\nmoliriue moram, aut ueniendi poscere causas.\n\nIpsa Paphum sublimis abit, sedesque reuisit 415\n\nlaeta suas, ubi templum illi, centumque Sabaeo\n\nture calent arae, sertisque recentibus halant. She Directs Him to Dido's Palace\n\n'O goddess, if I were to start my tale at the very beginning, and you had time to hear the story of our misfortunes, Vesper would have shut day away in the closed heavens. A storm drove us at whim to Libya's shores, sailing the many seas from ancient Troy, if by chance the name of Troy has come to your hearing. I am that Aeneas, the virtuous, who carries my household gods in my ship with me, having snatched them from the enemy, my name is known beyond the sky. I seek my country Italy, and a people born of Jupiter on high. I embarked on the Phrygian sea with twenty ships, following my given fate, my mother, a goddess, showing the way: barely seven are left, wrenched from the wind and waves. I myself wander, destitute and unknown, in the Libyan desert, driven from Europe and Asia.' Venus did not wait for further complaint but broke in on his lament like this: 'Whoever you are I don't think you draw the breath of life while hated by the gods, you who've reached a city of Tyre. Only go on from here, and take yourself to the queen's threshold, since I bring you news that your friends are restored, and your ships recalled, driven to safety by the shifting winds, unless my parents taught me false prophecies, in vain. See, those twelve swans in exultant line, that an eagle, Jupiter's bird, swooping from the heavens, was troubling in the clear sky: now, in a long file, they seem to have settled, or be gazing down now at those who already have. As, returning, their wings beat in play, and they circle the zenith in a crowd, and give their cry, so your ships and your people are in harbour, or near its entrance under full sail. Only go on, turn your steps where the path takes you.' She spoke, and turning away she reflected the light from her rose-tinted neck, and breathed a divine perfume from her ambrosial hair: her robes trailed down to her feet, and, in her step, showed her a true goddess. He recognised his mother, and as she vanished followed her with his voice: 'You too are cruel, why do you taunt your son with false phantoms? Why am I not allowed to join hand with hand, and speak and hear true words?' So he accuses her, and turns his steps towards the city. But Venus veiled them with a dark mist as they walked, and, as a goddess, spread a thick covering of cloud around them, so that no one could see them, or touch them, or cause them delay, or ask them where they were going. She herself soars high in the air, to Paphos, and returns to her home with delight, where her temple and its hundred altars steam with Sabean incense, fragrant with fresh garlands.

Sunt hic etiam sua praemia laudi;\n\nsunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt.\n\nSolue metus; feret haec aliquam tibi fama salutem.' The Temple of Juno\n\nMeanwhile they've tackled the route the path revealed. And soon they climbed the hill that looms high over the city, and looks down from above on the towers that face it. Aeneas marvels at the mass of buildings, once huts, marvels at the gates, the noise, the paved roads. The eager Tyrians are busy, some building walls, and raising the citadel, rolling up stones by hand, some choosing the site for a house, and marking a furrow: they make magistrates and laws, and a sacred senate: here some are digging a harbour: others lay down the deep foundations of a theatre, and carve huge columns from the cliff, tall adornments for the future stage. Just as bees in early summer carry out their tasks among the flowery fields, in the sun, when they lead out the adolescent young of their race, or cram the cells with liquid honey, and swell them with sweet nectar, or receive the incoming burdens, or forming lines drive the lazy herd of drones from their hives: the work glows, and the fragrant honey's sweet with thyme. 'O fortunate those whose walls already rise!' Aeneas cries, and admires the summits of the city. He enters among them, veiled in mist (marvellous to tell) and mingles with the people seen by no one. There was a grove in the centre of the city, delightful with shade, where the wave and storm-tossed Phoenicians first uncovered the head of a fierce horse, that regal Juno showed them: so the race would be noted in war, and rich in substance throughout the ages. Here Sidonian Dido was establishing a great temple to Juno, rich with gifts and divine presence, with bronze entrances rising from stairways, and beams jointed with bronze, and hinges creaking on bronze doors. Here in the grove something new appeared that calmed his fears for the first time, here for the first time Aeneas dared to hope for safety, and to put greater trust in his afflicted fortunes. While, waiting for the queen, in the vast temple, he looks at each thing: while he marvels at the city's wealth, the skill of their artistry, and the products of their labours, he sees the battles at Troy in their correct order, the War, known through its fame to the whole world, the sons of Atreus, of Priam, and Achilles angered with both. He halted, and said, with tears: 'What place is there, Achates, what region of earth not full of our hardships? See, Priam! Here too virtue has its rewards, here too there are tears for events, and mortal things touch the heart. Lose your fears: this fame will bring you benefit.' Lines 464-493\n\nSic ait, atque animum pictura pascit inani,\n\nmulta gemens, largoque umectat flumine uoltum. 465\n\nNamque uidebat, uti bellantes Pergama circum\n\nhac fugerent Graii, premeret Troiana iuuentus,\n\nhac Phryges, instaret curru cristatus Achilles.\n\nNec procul hinc Rhesi niueis tentoria uelis\n\nadgnoscit lacrimans, primo quae prodita somno 470\n\nTydides multa uastabat caede cruentus,\n\nardentisque auertit equos in castra, prius quam\n\npabula gustassent Troiae Xanthumque bibissent.\n\nParte alia fugiens amissis Troilus armis,\n\ninfelix puer atque impar congressus Achilli, 475\n\nfertur equis, curruque haeret resupinus inani,\n\nlora tenens tamen; huic ceruixque comaeque trahuntur\n\nper terram, et uersa puluis inscribitur hasta.\n\nInterea ad templum non aequae Palladis ibant\n\ncrinibus Iliades passis peplumque ferebant, 480\n\nsuppliciter tristes et tunsae pectora palmis;\n\ndiua solo fixos oculos auersa tenebat.\n\nTer circum Iliacos raptauerat Hectora muros,\n\nexanimumque auro corpus uendebat Achilles.\n\nTum uero ingentem gemitum dat pectore ab imo, 485\n\nut spolia, ut currus, utque ipsum corpus amici,\n\ntendentemque manus Priamum conspexit inermis.\n\nSe quoque principibus permixtum adgnouit Achiuis,\n\nEoasque acies et nigri Memnonis arma.\n\nDucit Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis 490\n\nPenthesilea furens, mediisque in milibus ardet,\n\naurea subnectens exsertae cingula mammae,\n\nbellatrix, audetque uiris concurrere uirgo. The Frieze\n\nSo he speaks, and feeds his spirit with the insubstantial frieze, sighing often, and his face wet with the streaming tears. For he saw how, here, the Greeks fled, as they fought round Troy, chased by the Trojan youth, and, there, the Trojans fled, with plumed Achilles pressing them close in his chariot. Not far away, through his tears, he recognises Rhesus's white-canvassed tents, that blood-stained Diomede, Tydeus's son, laid waste with great slaughter, betrayed in their first sleep, diverting the fiery horses to his camp, before they could eat Trojan fodder, or drink from the river Xanthus. Elsewhere Troilus, his weapons discarded in flight, unhappy boy, unequally matched in his battle with Achilles, is dragged by his horses, clinging face-up to the empty chariot, still clutching the reins: his neck and hair trailing on the ground, and his spear reversed furrowing the dust. Meanwhile the Trojan women with loose hair, walked to unjust Pallas's temple carrying the sacred robe, mourning humbly, and beating their breasts with their hands. The goddess was turned away, her eyes fixed on the ground. Three times had Achilles dragged Hector round the walls of Troy, and now was selling the lifeless corpse for gold. Then Aeneas truly heaves a deep sigh, from the depths of his heart, as he views the spoils, the chariot, the very body of his friend, and Priam stretching out his unwarlike hands. He recognised himself as well, fighting the Greek princes, and the Ethiopian ranks and black Memnon's armour. Raging Penthesilea leads the file of Amazons, with crescent shields, and shines out among her thousands, her golden girdle fastened beneath her exposed breasts, a virgin warrior daring to fight with men. Lines 494-519\n\nHaec dum Dardanio Aeneae miranda uidentur,\n\ndum stupet, obtutuque haeret defixus in uno, 495\n\nregina ad templum, forma pulcherrima Dido,\n\nincessit magna iuuenum stipante caterua.\n\nQualis in Eurotae ripis aut per iuga Cynthi\n\nexercet Diana choros, quam mille secutae\n\nhinc atque hinc glomerantur oreades; illa pharetram 500\n\nfert umero, gradiensque deas supereminet omnis:\n\nLatonae tacitum pertemptant gaudia pectus:\n\ntalis erat Dido, talem se laeta ferebat\n\nper medios, instans operi regnisque futuris.\n\nTum foribus diuae, media testudine templi, 505\n\nsaepta armis, solioque alte subnixa resedit.\n\nIura dabat legesque uiris, operumque laborem\n\npartibus aequabat iustis, aut sorte trahebat:\n\ncum subito Aeneas concursu accedere magno\n\nAnthea Sergestumque uidet fortemque Cloanthum, 510\n\nTeucrorumque alios, ater quos aequore turbo\n\ndispulerat penitusque alias auexerat oras.\n\nObstipuit simul ipse simul perculsus Achates\n\nlaetitiaque metuque; auidi coniungere dextras\n\nardebant; sed res animos incognita turbat. 515\n\nDissimulant, et nube caua speculantur amicti,\n\nquae fortuna uiris, classem quo litore linquant,\n\nquid ueniant; cunctis nam lecti nauibus ibant,\n\norantes ueniam, et templum clamore petebant. The Arrival of Queen Dido\n\nWhile these wonderful sights are viewed by Trojan Aeneas, while amazed he hangs there, rapt, with fixed gaze, Queen Dido, of loveliest form, reached the temple, with a great crowd of youths accompanying her. Just as Diana leads her dancing throng on Eurotas's banks, or along the ridges of Cynthus, and, following her, a thousand mountain-nymphs gather on either side: and she carries a quiver on her shoulder, and overtops all the other goddesses as she walks: and delight seizes her mother Latona's silent heart: such was Dido, so she carried herself, joyfully, amongst them, furthering the work, and her rising kingdom. Then, fenced with weapons, and resting on a high throne, she took her seat, at the goddess's doorway, under the central vault. She was giving out laws and statutes to the people, and sharing the workers labour out in fair proportions, or assigning it by lot: when Aeneas suddenly saw Antheus, and Sergestus, and brave Cloanthus, approaching, among a large crowd, with others of the Trojans whom the black storm-clouds had scattered over the sea and carried far off to other shores. He was stunned, and Achates was stunned as well with joy and fear: they burned with eagerness to clasp hands, but the unexpected event confused their minds. They stay concealed and, veiled in the deep mist, they watch to see what happens to their friends, what shore they have left the fleet on, and why they are here: the elect of every ship came begging favour, and made for the temple among the shouting. Lines 520-560\n\nPostquam introgressi et coram data copia fandi, 520\n\nmaximus Ilioneus placido sic pectore coepit:\n\n'O Regina, nouam cui condere Iuppiter urbem\n\niustitiaque dedit gentis frenare superbas,\n\nTroes te miseri, uentis maria omnia uecti,\n\noramus, prohibe infandos a nauibus ignis, 525\n\nparce pio generi, et propius res aspice nostras.\n\nNon nos aut ferro Libycos populare Penatis\n\nuenimus, aut raptas ad litora uertere praedas;\n\nnon ea uis animo, nec tanta superbia uictis.\n\nEst locus, Hesperiam Grai cognomine dicunt, 530\n\nterra antiqua, potens armis atque ubere glaebae;\n\nOenotri coluere uiri; nunc fama minores\n\nItaliam dixisse ducis de nomine gentem.\n\nHic cursus fuit:\n\ncum subito adsurgens fluctu nimbosus Orion 535\n\nin uada caeca tulit, penitusque procacibus austris\n\nperque undas, superante salo, perque inuia saxa\n\ndispulit; huc pauci uestris adnauimus oris.\n\nQuod genus hoc hominum?

We have not come to despoil Libyan homes with the sword, or to carry off stolen plunder to the shore: that violence is not in our minds, the conquered have not such pride. There's a place called Hesperia by the Greeks, an ancient land, strong in men, with a rich soil: There the Oenotrians lived: now rumour has it that a later people has called it Italy, after their leader. We had set our course there when stormy Orion, rising with the tide, carried us onto hidden shoals, and fierce winds scattered us far, with the overwhelming surge, over the waves among uninhabitable rocks: we few have drifted here to your shores. What race of men is this? What land is so barbaric as to allow this custom, that we're denied the hospitality of the sands? They stir up war, and prevent us setting foot on dry land. If you despise the human race and mortal weapons, still trust that the gods remember right and wrong. Aeneas was our king, no one more just than him in his duty, or greater in war and weaponry. If fate still protects the man, if he still enjoys the ethereal air, if he doesn't yet rest among the cruel shades, there's nothing to fear, and you'd not repent of vying with him first in kindness. Then there are cities and fields too in the region of Sicily, and famous Acestes, of Trojan blood. Allow us to beach our fleet, damaged by the storms, and cut planks from trees, and shape oars, so if our king's restored and our friends are found we can head for Italy, gladly seek Italy and Latium: and if our saviour's lost, and the Libyan seas hold you, Troy's most virtuous father, if no hope now remains from Iulus, let us seek the Sicilian straits, from which we were driven, and the home prepared for us, and a king, Acestes.' So Ilioneus spoke: and the Trojans all shouted with one voice. Lines 561-585\n\nTum breuiter Dido, uoltum demissa, profatur:\n\n'Soluite corde metum, Teucri, secludite curas.\n\nRes dura et regni nouitas me talia cogunt\n\nmoliri, et late finis custode tueri.\n\nQuis genus Aeneadum, quis Troiae nesciat urbem, 565\n\nuirtutesque uirosque, aut tanti incendia belli?\n\nNon obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni,\n\nnec tam auersus equos Tyria Sol iungit ab urbe.\n\nSeu uos Hesperiam magnam Saturniaque arua,\n\nsiue Erycis finis regemque optatis Acesten, 570\n\nauxilio tutos dimittam, opibusque iuuabo.\n\nVoltis et his mecum pariter considere regnis;\n\nurbem quam statuo uestra est, subducite nauis;\n\nTros Tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur.\n\nAtque utinam rex ipse Noto compulsus eodem 575\n\nadforet Aeneas! Equidem per litora certos\n\ndimittam et Libyae lustrare extrema iubebo,\n\nsi quibus eiectus siluis aut urbibus errat.'\n\nHis animum arrecti dictis et fortis Achates\n\net pater Aeneas iamdudum erumpere nubem 580\n\nardebant. Prior Aenean compellat Achates:\n\n'Nate dea, quae nunc animo sententia surgit?\n\nomnia tuta uides, classem sociosque receptos.\n\nUnus abest, medio in fluctu quem uidimus ipsi\n\nsubmersum; dictis respondent cetera matris.' 585 Dido Welcomes the Trojans\n\nThen, Dido, spoke briefly, with lowered eyes: 'Trojans, free your hearts of fear: dispel your cares. Harsh events and the newness of the kingdom force me to effect such things, and protect my borders with guards on all sides. Who doesn't know of Aeneas's race, and the city of Troy, the bravery, the men, or so great a blaze of warfare, indeed, we Phoenicians don't possess unfeeling hearts, the sun doesn't harness his horses that far from this Tyrian city. Whether you opt for mighty Hesperia, and Saturn's fields, or the summit of Eryx, and Acestes for king, I'll see you safely escorted, and help you with my wealth. Or do you wish to settle here with me, as equals in my kingdom? The city I build is yours: beach your ships: Trojans and Tyrians will be treated by me without distinction. I wish your king Aeneas himself were here, driven by that same storm! Indeed, I'll send reliable men along the coast, and order them to travel the length of Libya, in case he's driven aground, and wandering the woods and towns.' Brave Achetes, and our forefather Aeneas, their spirits raised by these words, had been burning to break free of the mist. Achates was first to speak, saying to Aeneas: 'Son of the goddess, what intention springs to your mind? You see all's safe, the fleet and our friends have been restored to us. Only one is missing, whom we saw plunged in the waves: all else is in accord with your mother's words.' Lines 586-612\n\nUix ea fatus erat, cum circumfusa repente\n\nscindit se nubes et in aethera purgat apertum.\n\nRestitit Aeneas claraque in luce refulsit,\n\nos umerosque deo similis; namque ipsa decoram\n\ncaesariem nato genetrix lumenque iuuentae 590\n\npurpureum et laetos oculis adflarat honores:\n\nquale manus addunt ebori decus, aut ubi flauo\n\nargentum Pariusue lapis circumdatur auro.\n\nTum sic reginam adloquitur, cunctisque repente\n\nimprouisus ait: 'Coram, quem quaeritis, adsum, 595\n\nTroius Aeneas, Libycis ereptus ab undis.\n\nO sola infandos Troiae miserata labores,\n\nquae nos, reliquias Danaum, terraeque marisque\n\nomnibus exhaustos iam casibus, omnium egenos,\n\nurbe, domo, socias, grates persoluere dignas 600\n\nnon opis est nostrae, Dido, nec quicquid ubique est\n\ngentis Dardaniae, magnum quae sparsa per orbem.\n\nDi tibi, si qua pios respectant numina, si quid\n\nusquam iustitia est et mens sibi conscia recti,\n\npraemia digna ferant.

Sic fatus, amicum 610\n\nIlionea petit dextra, laeuaque Serestum,\n\npost alios, fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloanthum. Aeneas Makes Himself Known\n\nHe'd scarcely spoken when the mist surrounding them suddenly parted, and vanished in the clear air. Aeneas stood there, shining in the bright daylight, like a god in shoulders and face: since his mother had herself imparted to her son beauty to his hair, a glow of youth, and a joyful charm to his eyes: like the glory art can give to ivory, or as when silver, or Parian marble, is surrounded by gold. Then he addressed the queen, suddenly, surprising them all, saying: 'I am here in person, Aeneas the Trojan, him whom you seek, saved from the Libyan waves. O Dido, it is not in our power, nor those of our Trojan race, wherever they may be, scattered through the wide world, to pay you sufficient thanks, you who alone have pitied Troy's unspeakable miseries, and share your city and home with us, the remnant left by the Greeks, wearied by every mischance, on land and sea, and lacking everything. May the gods, and the mind itself conscious of right, bring you a just reward, if the gods respect the virtuous, if there is justice anywhere. What happy age gave birth to you? What parents produced such a child? Your honour, name and praise will endure forever, whatever lands may summon me, while rivers run to the sea, while shadows cross mountain slopes, while the sky nourishes the stars.' So saying he grasps his friend Iloneus by the right hand, Serestus with the left, then others, brave Gyus and brave Cloanthus. Lines 613-656\n\nObstipuit primo aspectu Sidonia Dido,\n\ncasu deinde uiri tanto, et sic ore locuta est:\n\n'Quis te, nate dea, per tanta pericula casus 615\n\ninsequitur?

Dido Receives Aeneas\n\nSidonian Dido was first amazed at the hero's looks then at his great misfortunes, and she spoke, saying: 'Son of a goddess, what fate pursues you through all these dangers? What force drives you to these barbarous shores? Are you truly that Aeneas whom kindly Venus bore to Trojan Anchises, by the waters of Phrygian Simois? Indeed, I myself remember Teucer coming to Sidon, exiled from his country's borders, seeking a new kingdom with Belus's help: Belus, my father, was laying waste rich Cyprus, and, as victor, held it by his authority. Since then the fall of the Trojan city is known to me, and your name, and those of the Greek kings. Even their enemy granted the Teucrians high praise, maintaining they were born of the ancient Teucrian stock. So come, young lords, and enter our palace. Fortune, pursuing me too, through many similar troubles, willed that I would find peace at last in this land. Not being unknown to evil, I've learned to aid the unhappy.' So she speaks, and leads Aeneas into the royal house, and proclaims, as well, offerings at the god's temples. She sends no less than twenty bulls to his friends on the shore, and a hundred of her largest pigs with bristling backs, a hundred fat lambs with the ewes, and joyful gifts of wine, but the interior of the palace is laid out with royal luxury, and they prepare a feast in the centre of the palace: covers worked skilfully in princely purple, massive silverware on the tables, and her forefathers' heroic deeds engraved in gold, a long series of exploits traced through many heroes, since the ancient origins of her people. Aeneas quickly sends Achates to the ships to carry the news to Ascanius (since a father's love won't let his mind rest) and bring him to the city: on Ascanius all the care of a fond parent is fixed. He commands him to bring gifts too, snatched from the ruins of Troy, a figured robe stiff with gold, and a cloak fringed with yellow acanthus, worn by Helen of Argos, brought from Mycenae when she sailed to Troy and her unlawful marriage, a wonderful gift from her mother Leda: and the sceptre that Ilione, Priam's eldest daughter, once carried, and a necklace of pearls, and a double-coronet of jewels and gold. Achates, hastening to fulfil these commands, took his way towards the ships. Lines 657-694\n\nAt Cytherea nouas artes, noua pectore uersat\n\nConsilia, ut faciem mutatus et ora Cupido\n\npro dulci Ascanio ueniat, donisque furentem\n\nincendat reginam, atque ossibus implicet ignem; 660\n\nquippe domum timet ambiguam Tyriosque bilinguis;\n\nurit atrox Iuno, et sub noctem cura recursat.\n\nErgo his aligerum dictis adfatur Amorem:\n\n'Nate, meae uires, mea magna potentia solus,\n\nnate, patris summi qui tela Typhoia temnis, 665\n\nad te confugio et supplex tua numina posco.\n\nFrater ut Aeneas pelago tuus omnia circum\n\nlitora iactetur odiis Iunonis iniquae,\n\nnota tibi, et nostro doluisti saepe dolore.\n\nHunc Phoenissa tenet Dido blandisque moratur 670\n\nuocibus; et uereor, quo se Iunonia uertant\n\nhospitia; haud tanto cessabit cardine rerum.\n\nQuocirca capere ante dolis et cingere flamma\n\nreginam meditor, ne quo se numine mutet,\n\nsed magno Aeneae mecum teneatur amore. 675\n\nQua facere id possis, nostram nunc accipe mentem.\n\nRegius accitu cari genitoris ad urbem\n\nSidoniam puer ire parat, mea maxima cura,\n\ndona ferens, pelago et flammis restantia Troiae:\n\nhunc ego sopitum somno super alta Cythera 680\n\naut super Idalium sacrata sede recondam,\n\nne qua scire dolos mediusue occurrere possit.\n\nTu faciem illius noctem non amplius unam\n\nfalle dolo, et notos pueri puer indue uoltus,\n\nut, cum te gremio accipiet laetissima Dido 685\n\nregalis inter mensas laticemque Lyaeum,\n\ncum dabit amplexus atque oscula dulcia figet,\n\noccultum inspires ignem fallasque ueneno.'\n\nParet Amor dictis carae genetricis, et alas\n\nexuit, et gressu gaudens incedit Iuli. 690\n\nAt Venus Ascanio placidam per membra quietem\n\ninrigat, et fotum gremio dea tollit in altos\n\nIdaliae lucos, ubi mollis amaracus illum\n\nfloribus et dulci adspirans complectitur umbra. Cupid Impersonates Ascanius\n\nBut Venus was planning new wiles and stratagems in her heart: how Cupid, altered in looks, might arrive in place of sweet Ascanius, and arouse the passionate queen by his gifts, and entwine the fire in her bones: truly she fears the unreliability of this house, and the duplicitous Tyrians: unyielding Juno angers her, and her worries increase with nightfall. So she speaks these words to winged Cupid: 'My son, you who alone are my great strength, my power, a son who scorns mighty Jupiter's Typhoean thunderbolts, I ask your help, and humbly call on your divine will. It's known to you how Aeneas, your brother, is driven over the sea, round all the shores, by bitter Juno's hatred, and you have often grieved with my grief. Phoenician Dido holds him there, delaying him with flattery, and I fear what may come of Juno's hospitality: at such a critical turn of events she'll not be idle. So I intend to deceive the queen with guile, and encircle her with passion, so that no divine will can rescue her, but she'll be seized, with me, by deep love for Aeneas. Now listen to my thoughts on how you can achieve this. Summoned by his dear father, the royal child, my greatest concern, prepares to go to the Sidonian city, carrying gifts that survived the sea, and the flames of Troy. I'll lull him to sleep and hide him in my sacred shrine on the heights of Cythera or Idalium, so he can know nothing of my deceptions, or interrupt them mid-way. For no more than a single night imitate his looks by art, and, a boy yourself, take on the known face of a boy, so that when Dido takes you to her breast, joyfully, amongst the royal feast, and the flowing wine, when she embraces you, and plants sweet kisses on you, you'll breathe hidden fire into her, deceive her with your poison.' Cupid obeys his dear mother's words, sets aside his wings, and laughingly trips along with Iulus's step. But Venus pours gentle sleep over Ascanius's limbs, and warming him in her breast, carries him, with divine power, to Idalia's high groves, where soft marjoram smothers him in flowers, and the breath of its sweet shade. Lines 695-722\n\nIamque ibat dicto parens et dona Cupido 695\n\nregia portabat Tyriis, duce laetus Achate.\n\nCum uenit, aulaeis iam se regina superbis\n\naurea composuit sponda mediamque locauit.\n\nIam pater Aeneas et iam Troiana iuuentus\n\nconueniunt, stratoque super discumbitur ostro. 700\n\nDant famuli manibus lymphas, Cereremque canistris\n\nexpediunt, tonsisque ferunt mantelia uillis.\n\nQuinquaginta intus famulae, quibus ordine longam\n\ncura penum struere, et flammis adolere Penatis;\n\ncentum aliae totidemque pares aetate ministri, 705\n\nqui dapibus mensas onerent et pocula ponant.\n\nNec non et Tyrii per limina laeta frequentes\n\nconuenere, toris iussi discumbere pictis.\n\nMirantur dona Aeneae, mirantur Iulum\n\nflagrantisque dei uoltus simulataque uerba, 710\n\n[pallamque et pictum croceo uelamen acantho.]\n\nPraecipue infelix, pesti deuota futurae,\n\nexpleri mentem nequit ardescitque tuendo\n\nPhoenissa, et pariter puero donisque mouetur.\n\nIlle ubi complexu Aeneae colloque pependit 715\n\net magnum falsi impleuit genitoris amorem,\n\nreginam petit haec oculis, haec pectore toto\n\nhaeret et interdum gremio fouet, inscia Dido,\n\ninsidat quantus miserae deus; at memor ille\n\nmatris Acidaliae paulatim abolere Sychaeum 720\n\nincipit, et uiuo temptat praeuertere amore\n\niam pridem resides animos desuetaque corda. Cupid Deceives Dido\n\nNow, obedient to her orders, delighting in Achetes as guide, Cupid goes off carrying royal gifts for the Tyrians. When he arrives the queen has already settled herself in the centre, on her golden couch under royal canopies. Now our forefather Aeneas and the youth of Troy gather there, and recline on cloths of purple. Servants pour water over their hands: serve bread from baskets: and bring napkins of smooth cloth. Inside there are fifty female servants, in a long line, whose task it is to prepare the meal, and tend the hearth fires: a hundred more, and as many pages of like age, to load the tables with food, and fill the cups. And the Tyrians too are gathered in crowds through the festive halls, summoned to recline on the embroidered couches. They marvel at Aeneas's gifts, marvel at Iulus, the god's brilliant appearance, and deceptive words, at the robe, and the cloak embroidered with yellow acanthus. The unfortunate Phoenician above all, doomed to future ruin, cannot pacify her feelings, and catches fire with gazing, stirred equally by the child and by the gifts. He, having hung in an embrace round Aeneas's neck, and sated the deceived father's great love, seeks out the queen. Dido, clings to him with her eyes and with her heart, taking him now and then on her lap, unaware how great a god is entering her, to her sorrow. But he, remembering his Cyprian mother's wishes, begins gradually to erase all thought of Sychaeus, and works at seducing her mind, so long unstirred, and her heart unused to love, with living passion.

Dido Asks for Aeneas's Story\n\nAt the first lull in the feasting, the tables were cleared, and they set out vast bowls, and wreathed the wine with garlands. Noise filled the palace, and voices rolled out across the wide halls: bright lamps hung from the golden ceilings, and blazing candles dispelled the night. Then the queen asked for a drinking-cup, heavy with gold and jewels, that Belus and all Belus's line were accustomed to use, and filled it with wine. Then the halls were silent. She spoke: 'Jupiter, since they say you're the one who creates the laws of hospitality, let this be a happy day for the Tyrians and those from Troy, and let it be remembered by our children. Let Bacchus, the joy-bringer, and kind Juno be present, and you, O Phoenicians, make this gathering festive.' She spoke and poured an offering of wine onto the table, and after the libation was the first to touch the bowl to her lips, then she gave it to Bitias, challenging him: he briskly drained the brimming cup, drenching himself in its golden fullness, then other princes drank. Iolas, the long-haired, made his golden lyre resound, he whom great Atlas taught. He sang of the wandering moon and the sun's labours, where men and beasts came from, and rain and fire, of Arcturus, the rainy Hyades, the two Bears: why the winter suns rush to dip themselves in the sea, and what delay makes the slow nights linger. The Tyrians redoubled their applause, the Trojans too. And unfortunate Dido, she too spent the night in conversation, and drank deep of her passion, asking endlessly about Priam and Hector: now about the armour that Memnon, son of the Dawn, came with to Troy, what kind were Diomed's horses, how great was Achilles. 'But come, my guest, tell us from the start all the Greek trickery, your men's mishaps, and your wanderings: since it's the seventh summer now that brings you here, in your journey, over every land and sea.'\n\nLines 1-56\n\nConticuere omnes intentique ora tenebant\n\ninde toro pater Aeneas sic orsus ab alto:\n\nInfandum, regina, iubes renouare dolorem,\n\nTroianas ut opes et lamentabile regnum\n\neruerint Danai, quaeque ipse miserrima uidi 5\n\net quorum pars magna fui. quis talia fando\n\nMyrmidonum Dolopumue aut duri miles Ulixi\n\ntemperet a lacrimis? et iam nox umida caelo\n\npraecipitat suadentque cadentia sidera somnos.\n\nsed si tantus amor casus cognoscere nostros 10\n\net breuiter Troiae supremum audire laborem,\n\nquamquam animus meminisse horret luctuque refugit,\n\nincipiam. fracti bello fatisque repulsi\n\nductores Danaum tot iam labentibus annis\n\ninstar montis equum diuina Palladis arte 15\n\naedificant, sectaque intexunt abiete costas;\n\nuotum pro reditu simulant; ea fama uagatur.\n\nhuc delecta uirum sortiti corpora furtim\n\nincludunt caeco lateri penitusque cauernas\n\ningentis uterumque armato milite complent. 20\n\nest in conspectu Tenedos, notissima fama\n\ninsula, diues opum Priami dum regna manebant,\n\nnunc tantum sinus et statio male fida carinis:\n\nhuc se prouecti deserto in litore condunt;\n\nnos abiisse rati et uento petiisse Mycenas. 25\n\nergo omnis longo soluit se Teucria luctu;\n\npanduntur portae, iuuat ire et Dorica castra\n\ndesertosque uidere locos litusque relictum:\n\nhic Dolopum manus, hic saeuus tendebat Achilles;\n\nclassibus hic locus, hic acie certare solebant. 30\n\npars stupet innuptae donum exitiale Mineruae\n\net molem mirantur equi; primusque Thymoetes\n\nduci intra muros hortatur et arce locari,\n\nsiue dolo seu iam Troiae sic fata ferebant.\n\nat Capys, et quorum melior sententia menti, 35\n\naut pelago Danaum insidias suspectaque dona\n\npraecipitare iubent subiectisque urere flammis,\n\naut terebrare cauas uteri et temptare latebras.\n\nscinditur incertum studia in contraria uulgus.\n\nPrimus ibi ante omnis magna comitante caterua 40\n\nLaocoon ardens summa decurrit ab arce,\n\net procul 'o miseri, quae tanta insania, ciues?\n\ncreditis auectos hostis? aut ulla putatis\n\ndona carere dolis Danaum? sic notus Ulixes?\n\naut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achiui, 45\n\naut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros,\n\ninspectura domos uenturaque desuper urbi,\n\naut aliquis latet error; equo ne credite, Teucri.\n\nquidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis.'\n\nsic fatus ualidis ingentem uiribus hastam 50\n\nin latus inque feri curuam compagibus aluum\n\ncontorsit. stetit illa tremens, uteroque recusso\n\ninsonuere cauae gemitumque dedere cauernae.\n\net, si fata deum, si mens non laeua fuisset,\n\nimpulerat ferro Argolicas foedare latebras, 55\n\nTroiaque nunc staret, Priamique arx alta maneres. The Trojan Horse: Laocoön's Warning\n\nThey were all silent, and turned their faces towards him intently. Then from his high couch our forefather Aeneas began: 'O queen, you command me to renew unspeakable grief, how the Greeks destroyed the riches of Troy, and the sorrowful kingdom, miseries I saw myself, and in which I played a great part. What Myrmidon, or Dolopian, or warrior of fierce Ulysses, could keep from tears in telling such a story? Now the dew-filled night is dropping from the sky, and the setting stars urge sleep. But if you have such desire to learn of our misfortunes, and briefly hear of Troy's last agonies, though my mind shudders at the memory, and recoils in sorrow, I'll begin. 'After many years have slipped by, the leaders of the Greeks, opposed by the Fates, and damaged by the war, build a horse of mountainous size, through Pallas's divine art, and weave planks of fir over its ribs: they pretend it's a votive offering: this rumour spreads. They secretly hide a picked body of men, chosen by lot, there, in the dark body, filling the belly and the huge cavernous insides with armed warriors. Tenedos is within sight, an island known to fame, rich in wealth when Priam's kingdom remained, now just a bay and an unsafe anchorage for boats: they sail there, and hide themselves, on the lonely shore. We thought they had gone, and were seeking Mycenae with the wind. So all the Trojan land was free of its long sorrow. The gates were opened: it was a joy to go and see the Greek camp, the deserted site and the abandoned shore. Here the Dolopians stayed, here cruel Achilles, here lay the fleet, here they used to meet us in battle. Some were amazed at virgin Minerva's fatal gift, and marvel at the horse's size: and at first Thymoetes, whether through treachery, or because Troy's fate was certain, urged that it be dragged inside the walls and placed on the citadel. But Capys, and those of wiser judgement, commanded us to either hurl this deceit of the Greeks, this suspect gift, into the sea, or set fire to it from beneath, or pierce its hollow belly, and probe for hiding places. The crowd, uncertain, was split by opposing opinions. Then Laocoön rushes down eagerly from the heights of the citadel, to confront them all, a large crowd with him, and shouts from far off: 'O unhappy citizens, what madness? Do you think the enemy's sailed away? Or do you think any Greek gift's free of treachery? Is that Ulysses's reputation? Either there are Greeks in hiding, concealed by the wood, or it's been built as a machine to use against our walls, or spy on our homes, or fall on the city from above, or it hides some other trick: Trojans, don't trust this horse. Whatever it is, I'm afraid of Greeks even those bearing gifts.' So saying he hurled his great spear, with extreme force, at the creature's side, and into the frame of the curved belly. The spear stuck quivering, and at the womb's reverberation the cavity rang hollow and gave out a groan. And if the gods' fate, if our minds, had not been ill-omened, he'd have incited us to mar the Greeks hiding-place with steel: Troy would still stand: and you, high tower of Priam would remain.

Sinon's Tale\n\nSee, meanwhile, some Trojan shepherds, shouting loudly, dragging a youth, his hands tied behind his back, to the king. In order to contrive this, and lay Troy open to the Greeks, he had placed himself in their path, calm in mind, and ready for either course: to engage in deception, or find certain death. The Trojan youth run, crowding round, from all sides, to see him, and compete in mocking the captive. Listen now to Greek treachery, and learn of all their crimes from just this one. Since, as he stood, looking troubled, unarmed, amongst the gazing crowd, and cast his eyes around the Phrygian ranks, he said: 'Ah! What land, what seas would accept me now? What's left for me at the last in my misery, I who have no place among the Greeks, when the hostile Trojans, themselves, demand my punishment and my blood? At this the mood changed and all violence was checked. We urged him to say what blood he was sprung from, and why he suffered: and tell us what trust could be placed in him as a captive. Setting fear aside at last he speaks: \"O king, I'll tell you the whole truth, whatever happens, and indeed I'll not deny that I'm of Argive birth: this first of all: if Fortune has made me wretched, she'll not also wrongly make me false and a liar. If by any chance some mention of Palamedes's name has reached your ears, son of Belus, and talk of his glorious fame, he whom the Pelasgians, on false charges of treason, by atrocious perjury, because he opposed the war, sent innocent to his death, and who they mourn, now he's taken from the light: well my father, being poor, sent me here to the war when I was young, as his friend, as we were blood relatives. While Palamades was safe in power, and prospered in the kings' council, I also had some name and respect. But when he passed from this world above, through the jealousy of plausible Ulysses (the tale's not unknown) I was ruined, and spent my life in obscurity and grief, inwardly angry at the fate of my innocent friend. Maddened I could not be silent, and I promised, if chance allowed, and if I ever returned as a victor to my native Argos, to avenge him, and with my words stirred bitter hatred. The first hint of trouble came to me from this, because of it Ulysses was always frightening me with new accusations, spreading veiled rumours among the people, and guiltily seeking to defend himself. He would not rest till, with Calchas as his instrument – but why I do unfold this unwelcome story? Why hinder you? If you consider all Greeks the same, and that's sufficient, take your vengeance now: that's what the Ithacan wants, and the sons of Atreus would pay dearly for.\" Then indeed we were on fire to ask, and seek the cause, ignorant of such wickedness and Pelasgian trickery. Trembling with fictitious feelings he continued, saying: \"The Greeks, weary with the long war, often longed to leave Troy and execute a retreat: if only they had! Often a fierce storm from the sea land-locked them, and the gale terrified them from leaving: once that horse, made of maple-beams, stood there, especially then, storm-clouds thundered in the sky. Anxious, we send Eurypylus to consult Phoebus's oracle, and he brings back these dark words from the sanctuary: 'With blood, and a virgin sacrifice, you calmed the winds, O Greeks, when you first came to these Trojan shores, seek your return in blood, and the well-omened sacrifice of an Argive life.' When this reached the ears of the crowd, their minds were stunned, and an icy shudder ran to their deepest marrow: who readies this fate, whom does Apollo choose? At this the Ithacan thrust the seer, Calchas, into their midst, demanding to know what the god's will might be, among the uproar. Many were already cruelly prophesying that ingenious man's wickedness towards me, and silently saw what was coming. For ten days the seer kept silence, refusing to reveal the secret by his words, or condemn anyone to death. But at last, urged on by Ulysses's loud clamour, he broke into speech as agreed, and doomed me to the altar. All acclaimed it, and what each feared himself, they endured when directed, alas, towards one man's destruction. Now the terrible day arrived, the rites were being prepared for me, the salted grain, and the headbands for my forehead. I confess I saved myself from death, burst my bonds, and all that night hid by a muddy lake among the reeds, till they set sail, if as it happened they did. And now I've no hope of seeing my old country again, or my sweet children or the father I long for: perhaps they'll seek to punish them for my flight, and avenge my crime through the death of these unfortunates. But I beg you, by the gods, by divine power that knows the truth, by whatever honour anywhere remains pure among men, have pity on such troubles, pity the soul that endures undeserved suffering.\" Lines 145-194 145\n\nHis lacrimis uitam damus et miserescimus ultro. 145\n\nipse uiro primus manicas atque arta leuari\n\nuincla iubet Priamus dictisque ita fatur amicis:\n\n'quisquis es, amissos hinc iam obliuiscere Graios\n\n(noster eris) mihique haec edissere uera roganti:\n\nquo molem hanc immanis equi statuere? quis auctor? 150\n\nquidue petunt? quae religio? aut quae machina belli?'\n\ndixerat. ille dolis instructus et arte Pelasga\n\nsustulit exutas uinclis ad sidera palmas:\n\n'uos, aeterni ignes, et non uiolabile uestrum\n\ntestor numen,' ait, 'uos arae ensesque nefandi, 155\n\nquos fugi, uittaeque deum, quas hostia gessi:\n\nfas mihi Graiorum sacrata resoluere iura,\n\nfas odisse uiros atque omnia ferre sub auras,\n\nsi qua tegunt, teneor patriae nec legibus ullis.\n\ntu modo promissis maneas seruataque serues 160\n\nTroia fidem, si uera feram, si magna rependam.\n\nomnis spes Danaum et coepti fiducia belli\n\nPalladis auxiliis semper stetit. impius ex quo\n\nTydides sed enim scelerumque inuentor Ulixes,\n\nfatale adgressi sacrato auellere templo 165\n\nPalladium caesis summae custodibus arcis,\n\ncorripuere sacram effigiem manibusque cruentis\n\nuirgineas ausi diuae contingere uittas,\n\nex illo fluere ac retro sublapsa referri\n\nspes Danaum, fractae uires, auersa deae mens. 170\n\nnec dubiis ea signa dedit Tritonia monstris.\n\nuix positum castris simulacrum: arsere coruscae\n\nluminibus flammae arrectis, salsusque per artus\n\nsudor iit, terque ipsa solo (mirabile dictu)\n\nemicuit parmamque ferens hastamque trementem. 175\n\nextemplo temptanda fuga canit aequora Calchas,\n\nnec posse Argolicis exscindi Pergama telis\n\nomina ni repetant Argis numenque reducant\n\nquod pelago et curuis secum auexere carinis.\n\net nunc quod patrias uento petiere Mycenas, 180\n\narma deosque parant comites pelagoque remenso\n\nimprouisi aderunt; ita digerit omina Calchas.\n\nhanc pro Palladio moniti, pro numine laeso\n\neffigiem statuere, nefas quae triste piaret.\n\nhanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem 185\n\nroboribus textis caeloque educere iussit,\n\nne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset,\n\nneu populum antiqua sub religione tueri.\n\nnam si uestra manus uiolasset dona Mineruae,\n\ntum magnum exitium (quod di prius omen in ipsum 190\n\nconuertant!)

Sinon Deludes the Trojans\n\nWith these tears we grant him his life, and also pity him. Priam himself is the first to order his manacles and tight bonds removed, and speaks these words of kindness to him: \"From now on, whoever you are, forget the Greeks, lost to you: you'll be one of us. And explain to me truly what I ask: Why have they built this huge hulk of a horse? Who created it? What do they aim at? What religious object or war machine is it?\" He spoke: the other, schooled in Pelasgian art and trickery, raised his unbound palms towards the stars, saying: \"You, eternal fires, in your invulnerable power, be witness, you altars and impious swords I escaped, you sacrificial ribbons of the gods that I wore as victim: with right I break the Greek's solemn oaths, with right I hate them, and if things are hidden bring them to light: I'm bound by no laws of their country. Only, Troy, maintain your assurances, if I speak truth, if I repay you handsomely: kept intact yourself, keep your promises intact. All the hopes of the Greeks and their confidence to begin the war always depended on Pallas's aid. But from that moment when the impious son of Tydeus, Diomede, and Ulysses inventor of wickedness, approached the fateful Palladium to snatch it from its sacred temple, killing the guards on the citadel's heights, and dared to seize the holy statue, and touch the sacred ribbons of the goddess with blood-soaked hands: from that moment the hopes of the Greeks receded, and slipping backwards ebbed: their power fragmented, and the mind of the goddess opposed them. Pallas gave sign of this, and not with dubious portents, for scarcely was the statue set up in camp, when glittering flames shone from the upturned eyes, a salt sweat ran over its limbs, and (wonderful to tell) she herself darted from the ground with shield on her arm, and spear quivering. Calchas immediately proclaimed that the flight by sea must be attempted, and that Troy cannot be uprooted by Argive weapons, unless they renew the omens at Argos, and take the goddess home, whom they have indeed taken by sea in their curved ships. And now they are heading for their native Mycenae with the wind, obtaining weapons and the friendship of the gods, re-crossing the sea to arrive unexpectedly, So Calchas reads the omens. Warned by him, they've set up this statue of a horse for the wounded goddess, instead of the Palladium, to atone severely for their sin. And Calchas ordered them to raise the huge mass of woven timbers, raised to the sky, so the gates would not take it, nor could it be dragged inside the walls, or watch over the people in their ancient rites. Since if your hands violated Minerva's gift, then utter ruin (may the gods first turn that prediction on themselves!) would come to Priam and the Trojans: yet if it ascended into your citadel, dragged by your hands, Asia would come to the very walls of Pelops, in mighty war, and a like fate would await our children.\" Lines 195-227 195\n\nTalibus insidiis periurique arte Sinonis 195\n\ncredita res, captique dolis lacrimisque coactis\n\nquos neque Tydides nec Larisaeus Achilles,\n\nnon anni domuere decem, non mille carinae.\n\nHic aliud maius miseris multoque tremendum\n\nobicitur magis atque improuida pectora turbat. 200\n\nLaocoon, ductus Neptuno sorte sacerdos,\n\nsollemnis taurum ingentem mactabat ad aras.\n\necce autem gemini a Tenedo tranquilla per alta\n\n(horresco referens) immensis orbibus angues\n\nincumbunt pelago pariterque ad litora tendunt; 205\n\npectora quorum inter fluctus arrecta iubaeque\n\nsanguineae superant undas, pars cetera pontum\n\npone legit sinuatque immensa uolumine terga.\n\nfit sonitus spumante salo; iamque arua tenebant\n\nardentisque oculos suffecti sanguine et igni 210\n\nsibila lambebant linguis uibrantibus ora.\n\ndiffugimus uisu exsangues. illi agmine certo\n\nLaocoonta petunt; et primum parua duorum\n\ncorpora natorum serpens amplexus uterque\n\nimplicat et miseros morsu depascitur artus; 215\n\npost ipsum auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferentem\n\ncorripiunt spirisque ligant ingentibus; et iam\n\nbis medium amplexi, bis collo squamea circum\n\nterga dati superant capite et ceruicibus altis.\n\nille simul manibus tendit diuellere nodos 220\n\nperfusus sanie uittas atroque ueneno,\n\nclamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit:\n\nqualis mugitus, fugit cum saucius aram\n\ntaurus et incertam excussit ceruice securim.\n\nat gemini lapsu delubra ad summa dracones 225\n\neffugiunt saeuaeque petunt Tritonidis arcem,\n\nsub pedibusque deae clipeique sub orbe teguntur.
