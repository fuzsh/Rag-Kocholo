        "text": "It is about Merlin, prophetic bard, that I am preparing to sing: about his madness and his playful songs. You, Robert,\n\nRobert de Chesney, bishop of Lincoln from 1148 until his death in 1166.\n\nmost glorious of bishops, correct my poem, curb my pen. For we know that Philosophy\n\nFatidici uatis rabiem musamque iocosam\n\nMerlini cantare paro. Tu corrige carmen,\n\ngloria pontificum, calamos moderando, Roberte.\n\nScimus enim quia te perfudit nectare sacro\n\ndrenched you with her sacred nectar, and made you learned in all matters, so that, as leader and instructor to the world, you can hand out your learning. So, favour what I have started and look more kindly upon this poet than your predecessor did, the one whom you now succeed, rightly promoted to this honour.\n\nPhilosophia suo, fecitque per omnia doctum,5\n\nvt documenta dares, dux et preceptor in orbe.\n\nErgo meis ceptis faueas, uatemque tueri\n\nauspicio meliore uelis quam fecerit alter,\n\ncui modo succedis merito promotus honori.\n\nFor your manners, your virtuous life and lineage, the needs of this place, the clergy and people demanded it, and therefore happy Lincoln is now lifted to the stars. Accordingly I long for you to be celebrated with a suitable poem, but I am not good enough, not even if Orpheus and Camerinus\n\nSic etenim mores, sic uita probata, genusque10\n\nvtilitasque loci, clerus, populusque petebant,\n\nvnde modo felix Lincolnia fertur ad astra.\n\nErgo te cuperem complecti carmine digno:\n\nsed non sufficio, licet Orpheus et Camerinus\n\nand Macer and Marius and Rabirius\n\nOrpheus is the poet and bard par excellence in classical mythology. Camerinus, Macer, Marius and Rabirius are authors of epic poetry mentioned by the Latin poet Ovid in one of his works.\n\nwith his loud voice were all to accompany my voice and all the Muses were joining in. But you Muses, who are used to singing with me, let’s all carry out the work I have planned, and you can play the harp. And when years had passed, under the rule of many kings,\n\net Macer et Marius magnique Rabirius oris15\n\nore meo canerent Musis comitantibus omnes.\n\nAt uos, consuete mecum cantare Camene,\n\npropositum tractemus opus cytharamque sonate. Ergo, peragratis sub multis regibus annis,\n\nMerlin, the Briton, was seen as noble in the world. He was king and prophet and gave laws to the proud people of Dyfed, and sang prophecies of future things to their leaders. In the meantime, it came about that many of the kingdom’s noblemen were fighting among themselves,\n\nclarus habebatur Merlinus in orbe britannus.20\n\nRex erat et uates, Demetarumque superbis:\n\niura dabat populis, ducibusque futura canebat.\n\nContigit interea plures certamen habere\n\ninter se regni proceres, belloque feroci\n\nand had devastated innocent people with fierce war throughout every city. Peredur,\n\nWelsh tradition preserves the memory of prince Peredur who took part to the battle of Arfderydd against King Gwenddolau.\n\nprince of Gwynedd, was waging war on Gwenddolau, who ruled over the kingdoms of Scotland. And already the day fixed for the battle\n\nThe central battle of this war reflects the battle of Arfderydd, allegedly fought in 573.\n\nhad come and the leaders stood head-to-head on the plain, and their troops fought it out,\n\ninsontes populos deuastauisse per urbes.25\n\nDux Venedotorum Peredurus bella gerebat\n\ncontra Guennoloum, Scocie qui regna regebat.\n\nIamque dies aderat bello prefixa, ducesque\n\nastabant campo, decertabantque caterue\n\nfalling in equal numbers on both sides in a wretched massacre.\n\nMerlin had come to battle alongside Peredur, and so did Rodarcus,\n\nCharacter based on Rhydderch Hael (‘the Generous’), who ruled in Northern England between the sixth and the seventh century. He is also the husband of Merlin’s sister, Ganieda.\n\nking of the Cumbrians, both of them fierce men. They cut down any enemies who cross their path with hated swords, and three of the prince’s brothers, who followed him to war,\n\namborum pariter miseranda cede ruentes.30\n\nVenerat ad bellum Merlinus cum Pereduro,\n\nrex quoque Cumbrorum Rodarcus, seuus uterque.\n\nCedunt obstantes inuisis ensibus hostes,\n\ntresque ducis fratres, fratrem per bella secuti,\n\nremorselessly cut down those who resist them and wipe out the battle lines. Giving out just such a gift,\n\nAn ironic comment, since the gift they are giving out to their enemies is death.\n\nthey had rushed keenly through the hoards of foes – then suddenly they were cut down and fell.\n\nYou are filled with grief at that sight, Merlin, and you devise sad laments as you pass through the army, and as a response you bellow out these words:\n\nvsque rebellantes cedunt perimuntque phalanges.35\n\nInde per infestas cum tali munere turmas\n\nacriter irruerant, subito cecidere perempti.\n\nHoc uiso, Merline, doles, tristesque per agmen\n\ncommisces planctus, tali quoque uoce remugis:\n\n‘Surely, cruel fate couldn’t harm me so much that it could snatch from me such great and valiant companions, whom until now so many kings, so many remote kingdoms feared? O, how uncertain men’s destinies are, and their death ever near, which is always close to them and strikes them with its hidden goad,\n\n‘Ergone sic potuit sors importuna nocere40\n\nvt michi surriperet tantos talesque sodales,\n\nquos modo tot reges, tot regna remota timebant?\n\nO dubios hominum casus mortemque propinquam,\n\nque penes est illos semper, stimuloque latenti\n\nand drives the wretched life from their body! O glory of youth, who will stand with me now in arms, who will now be by my side, and who will drive back the chieftains coming to my harm and the hoards that fall upon me?\n\nBrave young men, your bravery\n\npercutit et miseram pellit de corpore uitam!45\n\nO iuuenile decus, quis nunc astabit in armis\n\nnunc michi pone latus, mecumque repellet euntes\n\nin mea dampna duces incumbentesque cateruas?\n\nAudaces iuuenes, uobis audacia uestra\n\nhas taken from you sweet years and sweet youth. Just now you were running armed throughout the battle-lines, and on every side you were laying low those who came against you, but now you clatter to the ground and redden it with red blood.’\n\nSo he made lament among the troops, as tears welled up,\n\neripuit dulces annos dulcemque iuuentam.50\n\nQui modo per cuneos discurrebatis in armis\n\nobstantesque uiros prosternebatis ubique,\n\nnunc pulsatis humum rubeoque cruore rubetis.’\n\nSic inter turmas lacrimis plangebat obortis,\n\nand he wept over his companions; but the terrible fighting does not stop: the armies rush against each other, foes are laid low by foes, blood flows everywhere, people die all around.\n\nBut at last, once the troops have been recalled on all sides, the Britons gather together, and together rushing through the shield-wall\n\ndeflebatque uiros; nec cessant prelia dira:55\n\nconcurrunt acies, sternuntur ab hostibus hostes,\n\nsanguis ubique fluit, populi moriuntur utrimque.\n\nAt tandem Britones, reuocatis undique turmis,\n\nconueniunt pariter, pariterque per arma ruentes\n\nattack the Scots, wound them and lay them low, nor do they rest until the enemy hoards turned their backs, fleeing into hiding.\n\nMerlin calls his friends away from the battle and tells them to bury the brothers in a speckled chapel.\n\ninuadunt Scotos, prosternunt uulnera dantes,60\n\nnec requieuerunt donec sua terga dederunt\n\nhostiles turme per deuia diffugientes.\n\nEuocat ex bello socios Merlinus, et illis\n\nprecipit in uaria fratres sepelire capella.\n\nAnd he makes lamentation for these men and does not stop pouring out tears. He scatters ash on his hair and tears his clothing, and lying on the ground he rolls this way and that. Peredur and the nobles and the leaders try to console him, but he does not want to be consoled, nor can he bear their pleas.\n\nDeplangitque uiros, nec cessat fundere fletus.65\n\nPulueribus crines spargit, uestesque recidit,\n\net prostratus humi nunc hac illacque uolutat.\n\nSolatur Peredurus eum proceresque ducesque,\n\nnec uult solari, nec uerba precancia ferre.\n\nAlready for three days he had wept, and refused food, such was the affliction that had overwhelmed him. And then, when he had filled the air with so many cries of such massive grief, he took on a strange new madness and went away secretly. He flees into the woods and does not want to be seen fleeing,\n\nIam tribus emensis defleuerat ipse diebus,70\n\nrespueratque cibos, tantus dolor urserat illum.\n\nInde nouas furias, cum tot tantisque querelis\n\naera complesset, cepit, furtimque recedit.\n\nEt fugit ad siluas, nec uult fugiendo uideri,\n\nand he enters a grove, and takes pleasure in hiding under the ash-trees, and he watches in wonder as the wild beasts graze on the grass there in the forest. Sometimes he chases them, sometimes he outstrips them as they run; he eats the roots of plants, he eats the plants themselves, he eats the fruits on the trees and the mulberries on the bush:\n\ningrediturque nemus, gaudetque latere sub ornis,75\n\nmiraturque feras pascentes gramina saltus.\n\nNunc has insequitur, nunc cursu preterit illas;\n\nvtitur herbarum radicibus, utitur herbis,\n\nvtitur arboreo fructu morisque rubeti:\n\nhe becomes a man of the forest, as if he had been born in the forest. Thus, for the whole summer nobody found him, he forgot himself and forgot his family, hid in the woods, lurking like a wild animal.\n\nBut when winter came and snatched away the plants,\n\nfit siluester homo, quasi siluis editus esset.80\n\nInde per estatem totam nullique repertus\n\noblitusque sui cognatorumque suorum\n\ndelituit siluis obductus more ferino.\n\nAt cum uenit hiemps herbasque tulisset, et omnes\n\nand all the fruit on the trees, and he had nothing to eat, he poured out these lamentations with a pitiful voice: ‘O Christ, God of heaven, what I am to do? Where can I live now that I see nothing to live off: no plants in the soil, nor nuts on the trees?\n\narboreos fructus, nec quo frueretur haberet,85\n\ndiffudit tales miseranda uoce querelas: ‘Celi Christe Deus, quid agam? Qua parte morari\n\nterrarum potero, cum nil quo uescar adesse\n\ninspicio, nec gramen humi, nec in arbore glandes?\n\nFour times three and seven apple trees constantly bearing fruit stood here, but now they don’t. So, who is it, who has stolen them from me? Why did they all fall at once? Now I see them, now I don’t. This way the fates are in conflict, that way they are in harmony, letting me see and stopping me seeing.\n\nTres quater et iuges septene poma ferentes90\n\nhic steterant mali, nunc non stant. Ergo, quis illas,\n\nquis michi surripuit? Quo deuenere repente?\n\nNunc illas uideo, nunc non. Sic fata repugnant,\n\nsic quoque concordant: cum dant, prohibentque uidere.\n\nNow there are no apples for me, now there’s nothing else.\n\nThe forest stands there with no leaves and no fruit: I am doubly punished because I can’t cover myself with the greenery nor eat the fruit. Winter and the south wind with pouring rain take everything away. If by chance I find turnips deep in the ground,\n\nDeficiunt nunc poma michi, nunc cetera queque.95\n\nStat sine fronde nemus, sine fructu: plector utroque,\n\ncum neque fronde tegi ualeo, neque fructibus uti.\n\nSingula bruma tulit pluuiisque cadentibus auster.\n\nInuenio si forte napes tellure sub ima\n\nthe greedy pigs and the ravenous boars run up and snatch them from me even as I’m pulling them out of the earth. And you, wolf, dear friend, who are used to wandering the trackless places and the forest groves with me, you barely go further than the fields, and severe hunger is forcing you and me to become weak.\n\nconcurrunt, auideque sues aprique uoraces,100\n\neripiuntque napes michi quas de cespite uello. Tu, lupe, care comes, nemorum qui deuia mecum\n\net saltus peragrare soles, uix preteris arua,\n\net te dura fames, et me languere coegit.\n\nYou lived in these woods long before me, and age turned your hair white first, and you neither have nor know what to toss into your mouth. I am surprised at that, because the forest overflows with goats and other animals you could catch: perhaps your accursed old age\n\nTu prior has siluas coluisti, te prior etas105\n\nprotulit in canos, nec habes, nec scis quid in ore\n\nproicias. Quod miror ego, cum saltus habundet\n\ntot capreis aliisque feris, quas prendere posses:\n\nforsitan ipsa tibi tua detestanda senectus\n\nhas stolen your vigour, and stopped you running. Just one thing is left: you fill the air with howling and you throw your weakened limbs on the ground and lie there.’\n\nHe was singing these words among the bushes and the dense hazel thicket, when the sound reached someone who was passing\n\neripuit neruos, cursumque negauit habendum.110\n\nQuod solum superest, comples ululatibus auras,\n\nat resupinus humi consumptos deicis artus.’\n\nHec inter fructices coriletaque densa canebat,\n\ncum sonus ad quendam peruenit pretereuntem,\n\nand he headed towards the place where the singer’s words had risen up into the air. And he found the spot and the speaker. When Merlin saw him, he ran away and the traveller followed, but could not stop him fleeing. So the traveller resumes the journey he’d begun,\n\nqui direxit iter quo sermo loquentis in auras115\n\nexierat. Reperitque locum, reperitque loquentem.\n\nQuo uiso, Merlinus abit, sequiturque uiator,\n\nnec retinere uirum potuit sic diffugientem.\n\nInde uiator iter repetit quo ceperat ire,\n\nkeeps to his intended route, though troubled by the fate of the man he saw running away. And lo! Someone else from the palace of Rodarcus, king of the Cumbrians – who had married Ganieda,\n\nThe character of Gwenddydd, Myrddin’s sister, appears also in the Welsh Cyfoesi Myrddin a Gwenddydd ei Chwaer (‘Conversation of Myrddin and his sister Gwenddydd’) and Yr Afallennau (‘The Apple Trees’).\n\nand was happy with his beautiful wife – crosses the traveller’s path. Ganieda was Merlin’s sister and full of grief at\n\npropositumque tenet casu commotus euntis.120\n\nEcce uiatori uenit obuius alter ab aula\n\nRodarchi regis Cumbrorum, qui Ganiedam\n\nduxerat uxorem, formosa coniuge felix.\n\nMerlini soror ista fuit, casumque dolebat\n\nher brother’s fate and had sent attendants to the woods and to far-flung fields to summon her brother back. One of them was going in the opposite direction to the traveller and their paths crossed directly. So they met and exchanged words, and the one sent to look for Merlin asked\n\nfratris, et ad siluas et ad arua remota clientes125\n\nmiserat, ut fratrem reuocarent. Ex quibus unus\n\nobuius huic ibat, sed et hic sibi protinus. Ergo\n\nconuenere simul, commiscent mutua uerba,\n\nat qui missus erat Merlinum querere, querit\n\nif the other man had seen him in the woods or in the forest glades. The latter admits he has seen such a man among the wooded valleys of the forest of Calidon\n\nThis is the ‘Caledonian forest’, Coed Celyddon in Welsh.\n\nand when he tried to talk to him or sit down with him, that man ran quickly away in among the oak-trees.\n\nsi uidisset eum siluis aut saltibus alter.130\n\nIlle uirum talem se conspexisse fatetur\n\ninter dumosos saltus nemoris Calidonis, dumque loqui uellet secum, secumque sedere\n\ndiffugisse uirum celeri per robora cursu.\n\nHe says this, off goes the other one, into the forest and searches the deep valleys, as well as crossing the high mountains. He looks for the man everywhere, pacing through some dark places. There was a spring at the summit of a mountain, ringed around with hazels and thick thorn bushes.\n\nHec ait, alter abit, siluasque subintrat et imas135\n\nscrutatur ualles, montes quoque preterit altos.\n\nQuerit ubique uirum, gradiens per opaca locorum. Fons erat in summo cuiusdam uertice montis,\n\nvndique precinctus corulis densisque frutectis.\n\nMerlin had climbed up to that place: from there he could look across the whole forest and see the antics of the wild beasts as they ran about. The messenger climbs up to that place and with silent steps walks across the steep slopes, searching for the man; then at long last he sees the spring and Merlin sitting on the grass behind it,\n\nIllic Merlinus conscenderat, inde per omnes140\n\nspectabat siluas cursusque iocosque ferarum.\n\nNuncius hunc scandit, tacitoque per ardua gressu\n\nincedit querendo uirum; tum denique fontem\n\nMerlinumque uidet super herbas pone sedentem\n\nuttering his laments with these words: ‘O you, who rule everything, how can it be that the seasons, four in number, are not the same? Because spring lays on flowers and foliage, by its law, summer gives crops and autumn the ripe fruit.\n\ndicentemque suas tali sermone querelas:145 ‘O qui cuncta regis, quid id est quod contigit, ut non\n\ntempora sint eadem numeris distincta quaternis?\n\nNam uer iure suo flores frondesque ministrat,\n\ndat fruges estas, autumpnus mitia poma.\n\nThen icy winter follows, devours and lays waste to everything, and brings back rain and snow, it drives everything away and harms it all with its storms and doesn’t let the earth produce all the different kinds of flowers, or let the oaks make acorns or the pomegranate trees their fruit.\n\nConsequitur glacialis hiemps, et cetera queque150\n\ndeuorat et uastat, pluuiasque niuesque reportat,\n\nsingula queque suis arcet leditque procellis,\n\nnec permittit humum uarios producere flores,\n\naut quercus glandes, aut malos punica mala.\n\nO, if only there were no winter or hoary frost! It would be spring or summer, so the cuckoo could come back singing and also the nightingale, who soothes sorrowful hearts with her kindly song, and the turtle dove, keeping her chaste vows, and the other birds would sing in harmony among the fresh new leaves,\n\nO utinam non esset hiemps, aut cana pruina!155\n\nVer foret, aut estas, cuculusque canendo rediret\n\net Philomena, pio que tristia pectora cantu\n\nmitigat, et turtur conseruans federa casta,\n\nfrondibus inque nouis concordi uoce uolucres\n\ncheering me with their song, while earth, all new, would breath out sweet scent from new blossom sprung from the green grass, and streams would flow by with gentle rippling, and close by under the leaves the dove would give out sleepy cooing to induce slumber.’\n\ncantarent alie, que me modulando fouerent,160\n\ndum noua flore nouo tellus spiraret odorem\n\ngramine sub uiridi, leni quoque murmure fontes\n\ndiffluerent, iuxtaque daret sub fronde columba\n\nsompniferos gemitus irritaretque soporem.\n\nWhen the messenger had listened to the prophet, he interrupted these laments with the notes from a harp that he had brought with him of his own accord, so he could thereby captivate and calm the madman. So, plucking the plaintive strings with his fingers one by one, hidden nearby he softly sang these words:\n\nNuncius audierat uatem, rupitque querelas165\n\ncum modulis cithare, quam secum gesserat ultro,\n\nvt sic deciperet, demulceretque furentem.\n\nErgo, mouens querulas digitis et in ordine cordas,\n\ntalia pone latens dimissa uoce canebat:\n\n‘O, the dreadful sighing of woeful Guendolena!\n\nMerlin’s wife, not known otherwise.\n\nO the wretched tears of weeping Guendolena! I pity the pitifully pining Guendolena! Never was there among the Welsh a comelier woman. She surpassed in radiance the goddesses and the privet leaf,\n\n‘O diros gemitus lugubris Guendoloene!170\n\nO miseras lacrimas lacrimantis Guendoloene!\n\nMe miseret misere morientis Guendoloene!\n\nNon erat in Waliis mulier formosior illa.\n\nVincebat candore deas foliumque ligustri,\n\nthe roses in full bloom and the fragrant lilies in the meadow. Springtime glory shone in her alone and she had in her two eyes the stars’ splendour and glorious hair shining with golden briliance. This has all gone, gone is all her beauty\n\nvernantesque rosas et olencia lilia prati.175\n\nGloria uernalis sola radiabat in illa,\n\nsidereumque decus geminis gestabat ocellis,\n\ninsignesque comas auri fulgore micantes.\n\nHoc totum periit, periit decus omnis in illa,\n\nand colour and look and the glory of her snow-white flesh. She is not what she was, troubled by much mourning. For she does not know where the prince went and and whether he lives or has died: the sorrowful woman is wasting away because of this, and perishing utterly, consumed by a long-lived grief.\n\net color et facies, niuee quoque gloria carnis.180\n\nNon est quod fuerat, multis meroribus acta.\n\nNescit enim quo dux abiit, uitane fruatur\n\nan sit defunctus: languet miserabilis inde,\n\ntotaque deperiit, longo liquefacta dolore.\n\nShedding tears alongside her with similar laments is Ganieda, who grieves over her missing brother without consolation. The latter weeps over her brother and the former over her husband, both together given over completely to weeping and passing sorrowful hours. No food, nor sleep sustains them, as they wander by night\n\nCollacrimatur ei paribus Ganieda querelis,185\n\namissumque dolet sine consolamine fratrem.\n\nHec fratrem flet et illa uirum, communiter ambe\n\nfletibus incumbunt et tristia tempora ducunt.\n\nNon cibus ullus eas, non sompnus nocte uagantes\n\nthrough the thickets: such a great sadness grips them both. Dido\n\nThe Phoenician Dido, founder and first queen of Carthago, whose love-affair with Aeneas is told in the fourth book of the Aeneid.\n\nfrom Sidon grieved no differently after Aeneas’ fleets set sail, when he left in haste. When Demophoon\n\nDemophoon was Theseus’ son, Phyllis the daughter of a Thracian king. He left her to return to Athens, but he did not come back at the agreed time.\n\ndid not return after the appointed time, most wretched Phyllis groaned and wept this way.\n\nsub uirgulta fouet, tantus dolor arcet utramque.190\n\nNon secus indoluit Sidonia Dido, solutis\n\nclassibus Enee tunc cum properaret abire.\n\nCum non Demophoon per tempora pacta rediret,\n\ntaliter ingemuit fleuitque miserrima Phillis.\n\nThus Briseis\n\nThe daughter of Briseus, a priest of Apollo, Briseis was captured by the Greeks and became the slave of Achilles. She was the cause of the dispute between Achilles and Agamennon.\n\nshed tears for the absent Achilles. Thus sister and wife make lamentation together and totally, utterly burn with inner torment in their grieving.’ The messenger said these things, singing to the tune of his sad strings, and with his song he soothed the prophet’s ears\n\nBriseis absentem sic deplorauit Achillem.195\n\nSic soror et coniunx collamentantur, et ardent\n\nfunditus internis cruciatibus usque dolendo’.\n\nIn fidibus querulis dicebat talia cantans\n\nnuncius, et modulo uatis demulserat aures\n\nso that he became calmer and took pleasure in the singer. Quickly the prophet gets up and addresses the young man with playful words and begs him to pluck the strings again with his fingers and to ring out the elegies from before. The messenger puts his fingers on the harp and performs\n\nmicior ut fieret congauderetque canenti.200\n\nOcius assurgit uates, iuuenemque iocosis\n\naffatur uerbis, iterumque mouere precatur\n\ncum digitis cordas elegosque sonare priores.\n\nAdmouet ille lire digitos, iussumque reformat\n\nthe same song, as requested, and with his singing he forces the man, rapt by the harp’s sweet tone, gradually to put aside his madness. And so he comes to his senses and recalls that he used to be Merlin, is surprised at his madness and hates it. His former mental state is restored, restored also are his feelings,\n\ncarmen item, cogitque uirum modulando furorem205\n\nponere paulatim cithare dulcedine captum.\n\nFit memor ergo sui, recolitque quod esse solebat\n\nMerlinus, furiasque suas miratur et odit.\n\nPristina mens rediit, rediit quoque sensus in illo,\n\nand, moved by affection, he groans to hear the names of his sister and his wife; having regained his sanity he requests to be taken to King Rodarcus’s palace. The other man complied with this request and forthwith they leave the forest behind and joyfully come together into the king’s stronghold.\n\net gemit ad nomen motus pietate sororis210\n\nvxorisque simul; mentis racione recepta,\n\nconducique petit Rodarchi regis ad aulam.\n\nParuit alter ei, siluasque subinde relinquunt,\n\net ueniunt pariter letantes regis in urbem.\n\nSo the queen rejoices to regain her brother and the wife is glad at her husband’s return. They take turns to shower him with kiss after kiss and wind their arms round his neck, overcome by such great love. The King also received his return with the honour that was fitting,\n\nErgo fratre suo gaudet regina recepto,215\n\nproque sui reditu fit coniunx leta mariti.\n\nOscula certatim geminant et brachia circum\n\ncolla uiri flectunt, tanta pietate mouentur.\n\nRex quoque quo decuit reducem suscepit honore,\n\nand the nobles rejoice in the city with all the retinue of the household. But after Merlin saw that there were such crowds of men present and could not bear it, he started up with the same madness and again filled with rage he longs to go into the forest and tries to slip away secretly.\n\ntotaque turba domus proceres letantur in urbe.220\n\nAt postquam tantas hominum Merlinus adesse\n\ninspexit turmas, nec eas perferre ualeret,\n\ncepit item furias, iterumque furore repletus\n\nad nemus ire cupit, furtimque recedere querit.\n\nThen Rodarcus ordered that he be detained with a guard set over him and that his raving should be soothed by a harp. And he stood next to him full of grief, and begged him with beseeching words to be reasonable, and stay there with him, and not to pine for the forest or to choose the life of a wild animal\n\nTunc precepit eum posito custode teneri225\n\nRodarcus, citharaque suos mulcere furores.\n\nAstabatque dolens, uerbisque precantibus illum\n\norabat racione frui, secumque manere,\n\nnec captare nemus, nec uiuere more ferino\n\namong the trees, when he could wield the regal sceptres and administer the law to savage peoples. Then he promises to give him many gifts, and orders clothes, hunting birds, dogs and swift horses to be brought, gold and shining gems,\n\nvelle sub arboribus, dum regia sceptra tenere230\n\nposset et in populos ius exercere feroces.\n\nHinc promittit ei se plurima dona daturum,\n\nafferrique iubet uestes, uolucresque, canesque,\n\nquadrupedesque citos, aurum, gemmasque micantes,\n\nthe goblets that Wayland\n\nGueylandus in the Latin text, that is Wayland, the smith of Germanic mythology.\n\nfashioned in the city of Segontium. Rodarcus holds out to the prophet each thing, and offers them and urges him to stay with him and leave the woods behind.\n\nThe prophet rejected these gifts, giving this as his answer: ‘The leaders who are troubled by their poverty can have these gifts,\n\npocula que sculpsit Gueylandus in urbe Sigeni.235\n\nSingula pretendit uati Rodarcus, et offert,\n\net monet ut maneat secum siluasque relinquat.\n\nTalia respondens spernebat munera uates:\n\n‘Ista duces habeant, sua quos confundit egestas,\n\nand those who aren’t content with little but long to have the most. I prefer the forest to these things, and the spreading oaks of Calidon and high mountains, and the verdant meadows below. Those things please me and these do not. You can take them all with you, King Rodarcus; my Caledonian forest, rich in nuts,\n\nnec sunt contenti modico, sed maxima captant.240\n\nHis nemus et patulas Calidonis prefero quercus\n\net montes celsos, subtusque uirencia prata.\n\nIsta michi, non illa placent. Tu talia tecum,\n\nrex Rodarche, feras, mea me Calidonis habebit\n\nwill have me: I prefer it to everything.’\n\nIn the end, since he could not hold the sorrowful man back with any gift, the king ordered them to bind him with a strong chain so that he could not get free and make for the deserted places in the forest. And so, when the prophet felt the chains around him,\n\nsilua ferax nucibus, quam cunctis prefero rebus.’245\n\nDenique cum nullo potuisset munere tristem\n\nrex retinere uirum, forti uincire cathena\n\niussit, ne peteret nemorum deserta solutus.\n\nErgo, cum sensit circum se uincula uates,\n\nand realised he could not freely make for the woods of Calidon, immediately he fell into grief, remained sad and silent, and removed any sign of joy from his face, so that he did not utter a word or give a smile. In the meantime the queen was on the way to the palace to see her ruler\n\nnec liber poterat siluas Calidonis adire,250\n\nprotinus indoluit, tristisque tacensque remansit,\n\nleticiamque suis subtraxit uultibus omnem,\n\nvt non proferret uerbum risumque moueret. Interea uisura ducem regina per aulam\n\nand, as was fitting, the king greeted her arrival warmly, took her by the hand and bade her to sit and embraced her and pressed kisses upon her lips. While doing these things he turned his gaze upon her, and saw a leaf caught in her hair.\n\nibat, et ut decuit rex applaudebat eunti,255\n\nperque manum suscepit eam, iussitque sedere\n\net dabat amplexus, et ad oscula labra premebat.\n\nConuertensque suos in eam per talia uultus,\n\nvidit in illius folium pendere capillis.\n\nSo he reached out with his fingers to remove it and throw it on the ground, and happily teased his lover. The prophet turned his eyes upon this and burst into laughter, causing the men who were standing nearby to turn their faces, marvelling at him because he had refused to smile.\n\nErgo suos digitos admouit et abstulit illud,260\n\net proiecit humi, letusque iocatur amanti.\n\nFlexit ad hoc oculos uates, risumque resoluit,\n\nastantesque uiros fecit conuertere uultus,\n\nin se mirantes quoniam ridere negarat.\n\nThe king is also taken aback and urges the madman to give the reason for the sudden laughter, and followed up his words with many gifts. Merlin stays silent and puts off explaining his laughter, but Rodarcus sought to press him more and more\n\nRex quoque miratur, percunctaturque furentem265\n\ntam subito facti causas edicere risus,\n\nadiecitque suis donaria plurima uerbis.\n\nIlle tacet differtque suos exponere risus,\n\nat magis atque magis precio precibusque mouere\n\nwith presents and prayers so that in the end, the prophet, despising his gifts, spoke these words: ‘The miser loves a gift and in his greed strives for possession. Such people bend their minds easily in whichever direction they are told to. Those who are corrupted by gifts are never satisfied with what they have,\n\ninstabat Rodarcus eum, tum denique uates270\n\nindignatus ei pro munere, talia fatur: ‘Munus auarus amat, cupidusque laborat habere.\n\nHii faciles animos flectunt quocumque iubentur.\n\nMunere corrupti quod habent non sufficit illis,\n\nbut the acorns of fair Calidon are enough for me, and the bright streams flowing through fragrant meadows. I am not won over by a gift, let the miser take his gifts, and unless freedom is on offer and I can return to the forest’s verdants groves, I will not explain my laughter.’\n\nat michi sufficiunt glandes Calidonis amene275\n\net nitidi fontes per olencia prata fluentes.\n\nMunere non capior, sua munera tollat auarus,\n\net nisi libertas detur, repetamque uirentes\n\nsiluarum ualles, risus aperire negabo.’\n\nSince he could, therefore, persuade the prophet with no gift nor find out why he had laughed, Rodarcus orders his chains to be undone straightaway and grants him the power to make for the forest’s deserted places, just so that he would be prepared to disclose what he wanted, the explanation for his laughter.\n\nErgo cum nullo potuisset munere uatem280\n\nflectere Rodarcus, nec cur risisset haberet,\n\nconfestim sua uincla uiro dissoluere iussit,\n\ndatque potestatem nemorum deserta petendi\n\nvt uelit optatam risus expromere causam.\n\nThen Merlin, overjoyed that he could leave, said:\n\n‘This is why I laughed, because you, Rodarcus, are both blameworthy and praiseworthy for the same gesture. Just now when you removed the leaf that the queen unknowingly had in her hair you showed yourself to be more faithful to her\n\nTunc Merlinus ait gaudens quia possit abire:285\n\n‘Iccirco risi quoniam, Rodarche, fuisti\n\nfacto culpandus simul et laudandus eodem.\n\nDum traheres folium modo quod regina capillis\n\nnescia gestabat, fieresque fidelior illi\n\nthan she has been to you, because she went into the thicket where her lover quickly came and made love to her. And while she was on her back, the leaf you plucked away, all unknowing, happened to be lying there and caught in her outspread hair.’\n\nRodarcus was instantly made sad by this accusation,\n\nquam fuit illa tibi, quando uirgulta subiuit290\n\nquo suus occurrit secumque coiuit adulter.\n\nDumque supina foret, sparsis in crinibus hesit\n\nforte iacens folium, quod nescius eripuisti.’ Ergo super tali Rodarcus crimine tristis\n\nturned his face away from her and cursed the day he had married her. But she, not in the least bit troubled, conceals her shame behind a smiling face and addresses her husband with these words: ‘Why are you sad, my love? Why are you so angered by this thing\n\nfit subito, uultumque suum diuertit ab illa,295\n\ndampnabatque diem qua se coniunxerat illi.\n\nMota sed illa nichil uultu ridente pudorem\n\ncelat, et alloquitur tali sermone maritum:\n\n‘Cur tristaris, amans? Cur sic irasceris ab re,\n\nand condemn me unfairly and believe a madman who is out of his mind and mingles lies with truths? Anyone who trusts him so many times, becomes more of a fool than he is. So put aside the notion that I have been led astray: I will prove that he is deluded and that he is not telling the truth.’\n\nmeque nec ex merito dampnas, credisque furenti,300\n\nqui racione carens miscet mendacia ueris?\n\nMultociens qui credit ei fit stulcior illo.\n\nExcipe nunc igitur, ne sim decepta, probabo\n\nquod sit delirus, quod non sit uera locutus.’\n\nAlong with many others, there was a lad in the hall, and when she spied him, the cunning woman instantly conceived a novel plan by which she could outwit her brother. So she orders the boy to come close and asks her brother to predict how the boy is going to die.\n\nVt plures alii, fuerat puer unus in aula,305\n\nhunc cum prospiceret conuoluit protinus artem\n\ningeniosa nouam, qua uult conuincere fratrem.\n\nInde uenire iubet puerum fratremque precatur,\n\nqua moriturus erat, pueri predicere mortem.\n\nIn response, her brother said to her: ‘O dearest sister: he will die as an adult by falling from a high rock.’ She, smiling at these words, told the boy to go away and take off the clothes he was wearing and put on different ones and cut his long hair,\n\nErgo frater ei: ‘Soror o carissima – dixit – ,310\n\nhic morietur homo celsa de rupe ruendo.’\n\nIlla sub hec ridens puero precepit abire\n\net quibus indutus fuerat deponere uestes\n\net uestire nouas, longosque recidere crines,\n\nand thus instructed him to come back in such as way as to look like another person. The boy did as he was told, because he changed his clothes and came back to them just as he had been instructed. Immediately the queen calls her brother over and says: ‘Beloved, tell your sister what death this one will have’.\n\nsicque redire iubet, ut eis appareat alter.315\n\nParuit ergo puer, rediit nam talis ad illos\n\nqualis erat iussus mutata ueste redire.\n\nMox iterum fratrem regina precatur et infit:\n\n‘Que mors huius erit narra, dilecte, sorori.’\n\nThen Merlin says: ‘When he grows up, this boy will get distracted and succumb to a violent death in a tree.’ That is what he said. She then addressed her husband with these words: ‘There we are: how did this false prophet lead you so astray that you thought I could have committed such a great sin;\n\nTunc Merlinus ait: ‘Puer hic cum uenerit etas320\n\nmente uagans forti succumbet in arbore morti.’\n\nDixerat. Illa suum sic est affata maritum: ‘Siccine te potuit falsus peruertere uates\n\nvt crimen tantum me commisisse putares;\n\nand if you want to know how much sense he was making, now you can judge from this boy that the things he said about me, just so that he could get away to the forest, were falsehoods. Far be it that I would do such a thing! I will keep my bed chaste and will be forever chaste so long as there is breath in me.\n\nat si scire uelis qua sit racione locutus,325\n\nhoc nunc de puero censebis ficta fuisse,\n\nque de me dixit dum siluas possit adire.\n\nAbsit ut hoc faciam! Castum seruabo cubile,\n\ncastaque semper ero dum flabit spiritus in me.\n\nI showed that man up, when I asked him to reveal the boy’s death, I will show him up now too: you need to be an attentive judge.’\n\nShe said these things and silently instructed the boy to go away and put on woman’s clothing and come back like that. The boy quickly went off and promptly did as he was told\n\nIllum conuici pueri de morte rogatum,330\n\nnunc quoque conuincam: tu sedulus arbiter esto.’\n\nHec ait, et tacite puerum secedere iussit,\n\nvesteque feminea uestiri sicque redire.\n\nMox puer abcessit, iussumque subinde peregit,\n\nand returned wearing woman’s clothing, just like a woman, and stood before the man, to whom the queen jokingly said: ‘Hey, brother, predict this woman’s death.’ ‘This one, woman or not, will die in a river’. That’s what the brother said, and made King Rodarcus cackle at his reasoning,\n\net sub feminea rediit quasi femina ueste335\n\net stetit ante uirum, cui sic regina iocando:\n\n‘Eya, frater, – ait – dic mortem uirginis huius.’\n\n‘Hec uirgo nec ne – dixit – morietur in amne.’\n\nFrater ei, mouitque sua racione cachinnum\n\nbecause he had been asked about the death of just one boy and had foretold three deaths. Consequently the king thought that he had told lies about his wife, and did not believe him, but was saddened and hated the fact that he had believed him, and had condemned his beloved.\n\nregi Rodarco, quoniam de morte rogatus340\n\nvnius pueri, tres dixerat esse futuras.\n\nErgo putabat eum de coniuge falsa locutum,\n\nnec credebat ei, sed contristatur, et odit\n\nquod sibi crediderat, quod condempnarat amantem.\n\nWhen the queen sees this, she forgives him and kisses him, caresses him, and makes him happy again. Meanwhile, Merlin is thinking about going back to the forest, and going out of the house, he asked for the gates to be opened. But his sister block his path and begged him with floods of tears\n\nId regina uidens ueniam dat et oscula iungit,345\n\net blanditur ei letum quoque reddidit illum. Cogitat interea siluas Merlinus adire,\n\negressusque domum portas aperire iubebat.\n\nSed soror obstabat, lacrimisque rogabat obortis\n\nto stay with her still and to leave off from his madness. That stubborn man refuses to leave off from his plans, but persists in opening the doors and tries to go. And he fumes and struggles and in his rage he fights with the servants. Finally, when nobody could hold him back from\n\nvt secum remaneret adhuc, sineretque furorem.350\n\nImprobus ille suis non uult desistere ceptis,\n\nsed perstat reserare fores, et abire laborat.\n\nEt fremit et pugnat, famulosque fremendo coartat.\n\nDenique, cum nullus posset retinere uolentem\n\nwanting to go, the queen quickly had Guendolena come, weeping at his departure. She comes and imploringly begs her husband to stay. But he scorns her entreaties and won’t either stay or look at her with a joyful face as he used to do.\n\nire uirum, iussit cicius regina uenire355\n\neius ad abcessum deflentem Guendoloenam.\n\nIlla uenit, suplexque uirum remanere precatur.\n\nSpernit at ille preces, nec uult remanere, nec illam\n\nsicut erat solitus gaudenti cernere uultu.\n\nShe is grief-stricken and streams with tears and tears her hair, and cuts her cheeks with her nails and rolls on the ground, as though dying. Seeing this, the queen spoke to him in this way: ‘This Guendolena of yours, who is dying for you like this, what will she do? Should she be given in marriage to another man? Or\n\nIlla dolet, fletuque fluit, laniatque capillos360\n\net secat ungue genas et humi moriendo uolutat.\n\nId regina uidens affatur taliter illum:\n\n‘Hec tua, que moritur sic pro te, Guendoloena\n\nquid faciet? Dabiturne uiro? Viduamue manere\n\nare you obliging her to remain a widow, or to go with you wherever you are going off to hide? Because she will come with you and happily live in the forest and the verdant groves of the wood, as long as she has you as her lover.’ So then the prophet replies to these words in this way:\n\n‘Sister, I do not want a domestic animal\n\nprecipis aut tecum quocumque recesseris ire?365\n\nIbit enim tecumque nemus, nemorisque uirentes\n\nleta colet saltus, dum te pociatur amante.’ Vocibus his igitur respondit talia uates:\n\n‘Nolo, soror, pecudem patulo que fontis hiatu\n\nthat pours out floods from a gaping well like the virgin’s spilling jar, when it’s hot. Nor will I change what I care about like Orpheus once did, when he made over his bedchamber to be occupied by boys after Eurydice crossed the sands of the Styx:\n\nOrpheus refused to love any other woman after the death of his lover Eurydice.\n\npure and free from both kinds of love I will remain without taint.\n\ndiffundit latices ut uirginis urna sub estus.370\n\nNec curam mutabo meam uelud Orpheus olim\n\nquando suos thalamos pueris commisit habendos,\n\nEuridice postquam Stigias transnauit harenas:\n\nmundus ab alterutro ueneris sine labe manebo.\n\nTherefore, let her have a fair chance at marriage as she wishes and let her marry the one that she desires to marry, by her own free choice; but, let the man who marries her take care never to cross my path or come near me, but let him turn aside so as not to feel\n\nHuic igitur detur nubendi iusta facultas,375\n\narbitrioque suo quem gestit ducere ducat,\n\nprecaueat tamen ipse sibi qui duxerit illam\n\nobuius ut numquam michi sit, nec cominus astet,\n\nsed se diuertat, ne si michi congrediendi\n\nmy brandished sword if I get the chance to meet him. And when the solemn day of the wedding comes and a variety of fare is given out to the guests, I shall attend in person equipped with suitable gifts, and I shall give Guendoloena abundant riches once she is married.’\n\ncopia prestetur, uibratum senciat ensem.380\n\nCumque dies aderit sollempnis lege iugali\n\ndiuerseque dapes conuiuis distribuentur,\n\nipsemet interero donis munitus honestis,\n\nditaboque datam profuse Guendoloenam.’\n\nWhen he had done speaking, saying farewell to them both as he walked away, he made for the forest he longed for with nobody stopping him. Guendoloena remains sadly watching on the threshold and likewise the queen and they are touched by their dear one’s fate. They wondered at the fact that a madman could know secret circumstances,\n\nDixerat, atque ‘uale’ gradiens subiungit utrique,385\n\net peciit siluas nullo prohibente cupitas.\n\nGuendoloena manet spectans in limine tristis\n\net regina simul, casuque mouentur amici.\n\nMiranturque nimis rerum secreta furentem\n\nand that he had been aware of his sister’s love-affair. But they thought he was lying about the boy’s death, which he described in three different ways instead of only one. It meant that his prophecy was considered a meaningless one for many years, until the boy reached manhood.\n\nnosse uirum, ueneremque sue sciuisse sororis.390\n\nMentitumque tamen pueri de morte putabant,\n\nquam dixit ternam, cum dicere debuit unam.\n\nInde diu sua uisa fuit uox uana per annos\n\ndonec ad etatem uenit puer ille uirilem.\n\nThen at last it was disclosed and proved correct by many people. For while out hunting with his dogs, he roused a stag that was hiding under the forest canopy and unleashed the dogs: once they have seen the stag, the dogs run where there are no paths and fill the air with their barking.\n\nTum demum patefacta fuit multisque probata.395 Nam dum uenatum canibus comitantibus iret,\n\nexciuit ceruum nemoris sub fronde latentem,\n\ndissoluitque canes, qui ceruo deuia uiso\n\ntranscendunt, complentque suis latratibus auras.\n\nHe himself urges his horse onwards with the spurs and makes chase, gives instructions to the huntsmen now with a horn now with his voice, and orders them to come on more quickly. There was a high mountain there surrounded all around by rocks, and a river flowed below, through the flat valley bottom.\n\nIpsemet urget equum calcaribus insequiturque,400\n\nnunc cornu nunc ore monens operisque ministros\n\nincrepat, atque iubet cursu ciciore uenire.\n\nMons ibi celsus erat circumdatus undique saxis,\n\niuxta quem fluuius subtus per plana fluebat.\n\nThe wild animal crossed up over the mountain as it fled, until it came to the river and was looking for its usual hiding places. The young man spurs on his horse and crosses the mountain on a direct path, and is searching for the stag among the rocks that lie all around. During this, it so happened that,\n\nHunc fera transcendit fugiens dum uenit ad amnem,405\n\nexegitque suas solito de more latebras.\n\nInstigat iuuenis, montem quoque tramite recto\n\npreterit, et ceruum per saxa iacencia querit.\n\nContigit interea dum duceret impetus ipsum\n\nas his haste drove him on, the horse slipped off a high cliff and the man fell down the mountain’s steep incline into the river, but in such a way that his foot got caught in a tree while the rest of his body plunged into the river. So it was that he fell, was drowned, and hung from a tree:\n\nlabi quadrupedem celsa de rupe, uirumque410\n\nforte per abruptum montis cecidisse sub amnem,\n\nvt tamen hereret pes eius in arbore quadam\n\net submersa forent sub flumine cetera membra.\n\nSicque ruit, mersusque fuit, lignoque pependit:\n\nand the triple nature of his death proved how right the prophet had been, he who had entered the forest and lived like a wild animal, enduring thick ice, in snow, rain and the wind’s unkind blast. And this gave him more pleasure than administering\n\net fecit uatem per terna pericula uerum,415\n\nqui nemus ingressus fuerat rituque ferino\n\nviuebat, paciens concrete frigoris †alge†\n\nsub niue, sub pluuia sub iniquo flamine uenti.\n\nIdque placebat ei pocius quam iura per urbes\n\nthe laws in his cities or subduing fierce peoples. In the meantime, as the years slipped by, while Merlin was permanently living this life with the forest herd, Guendoloena was given to a husband in marriage. It was night-time and the horns of the moon shone brightly\n\nexercere suas gentesque domare feroces.420\n\nInterea ducente uiro labentibus annis\n\ncum grege siluestri talem per tempora uitam\n\nGuendoloena datur nubendi lege marito. Nox erat et nitide radiabant cornua lune,\n\nand all the constellations were glittering in the vault of heaven. The air was crisper than usual, because the harsh cold north wind had driven away the clouds and left the sky clear, drying up the cloudy weather with its parching breath. From a high mountain, the prophet was watching the stars’ movement,\n\ncunctaque conuexi splendebant lumina celi.425\n\nPurior aer erat solito, nam frigidus atrox\n\nexpulerat nubes Boreas, celumque serenum\n\nreddiderat, sicco detergens nubila flatu.\n\nSidereum cursum uates spectabat ab alto\n\nsaying silently to himself in the open air the following words: ‘What does Mars’ shining mean? Can it be foretelling the death of a king and another king to come, because it has an unusual reddish glow? Certainly this is what I can see. Because Constantine has died and his ill-fated nephew, Conan,\n\nAccording to Geoffrey, Constantine was the son of Cador of Cornwall and succeeded Arthur in 542. The historical figure behind the legendary character is probably that of Custennin Gornau ap Cynfor, fifth-century ruler of Dumnonia.\n\nAurelius Conanus, Constantine’s nephew, usurped the throne, that should have been inherited instead by another of his uncles.\n\nmonte, loquens tacite sub diuo talia secum:430\n\n‘Quid sibi uult radius Martis? Regemne peremptum\n\nportendit nouiter rutilans aliumque futurum?\n\nSic equidem uideo. Nam Constantinus obiuit,\n\nipsiusque nepos scelerata sorte Conanus\n\nhas used the slaying of his uncle to seize the crown, and is king. And you, loftiest Venus, gliding on your fixed course and travelling with the sun as it passes below the zodiac, why do you cast a double ray that cleaves the sky? Does the division foretell my love’s parting?\n\nper patrui iugulum sumpto diademate rex est.435\n\nAt tu, summa Venus, que certo limite labens\n\ninfra zodiacum solem comitaris euntem,\n\nquid tibi cum radio qui duplex ethera findit?\n\nDiscidiumne mei sectus portendit amoris?\n\nFor such a twin light does indeed symbolise divided affections. Perhaps Guendolena has abandoned me while I am away and happily cling to another lover’s embraces. Thus am I outshone, thus another one enjoys her. Thus my rights are stolen from me while I dally.\n\nTalis enim radius diuisos signat amores.440\n\nForsitan absentem me Guendoloena reliquit,\n\nalteriusque uiri gaudens complexibus heret.\n\nSic igitur uincor, sic alter fungitur illa.\n\nSic mea iura michi dum demoror eripiuntur.\n\nThus it is indeed, for a tardy lover is outstripped by the one who is not tardy and is not absent, but stays close by. But I do not feel jealous. She should be wed now with a lucky omen and take pleasure in a new husband with my permission. When tomorrow dawns, I will go and take\n\nSic equidem nam segnis amans superatur ab illo445\n\nqui non est segnis nec abest, sed cominus instat.\n\nAt non inuideo. Nubat nunc omine dextro,\n\nvtaturque nouo me permittente marito.\n\nCrastina cumque dies illuxerit ibo, feramque\n\nwith me the gift I promised when I left.’ He finished speaking, and made the rounds of all the forest groves and gathered into one line the herds of stags, and the does and also the she-goats, and then he mounted a stag and as day dawned,\n\nmecum munus ei promissum quando recessi.’450 Dixerat, et siluas et saltus circuit omnes,\n\nceruorumque greges agmen collegit in unum\n\net damas capreasque simul, ceruoque resedit.\n\nEt ueniente die compellens agmina pre se\n\nhe went in haste to where Guendolena was getting married, driving the lines of beasts ahead of him. Once he got there, he had the stags stand patiently in front of the gates and called out: ‘Guendolena! Guendolena, come out! Such wonderful gifts are waiting for you!’ So Guendolena, smiling, comes out quickly\n\nfestinans uadit quo nubit Guendoloena.455\n\nPostquam uenit eo, pacienter stare coegit\n\nceruos ante fores, proclamans: ‘Guendoloena!\n\nGuendoloena, ueni! Te talia munera spectant!’\n\nOcius ergo uenit subridens Guendoloena,\n\nand is amazed to see him borne by a stag and that the beast is so obedient to him, and that he could muster such a great number of beasts, driving them before him like a shepherd drives sheep that he is used to taking to pasture. Her groom was watching from a high window,\n\ngestarique uirum ceruo miratur et illum460\n\nsic parere uiro, tantum quoque posse ferarum\n\nvniri numerum, quas pre se solus agebat\n\nsicut pastor oues quas ducere sueuit ad herbas. Stabat ab excelsa sponsus spectando fenestra\n\nmarvelling at the rider on his seat, and began to laugh. But when the prophet saw him, he realised who it was and suddenly tore off the antlers of the stag that was carrying him, and brandishing them, he threw them at the groom. And he completely crushed that man’s head,\n\nin solio, mirans equitem risumque mouebat.465\n\nAst ubi uidit eum uates, animoque quis esset\n\ncalluit, extemplo diuulsit cornua ceruo\n\nquo gestabatur, uibrataque iecit in illum.\n\nEt capud illius penitus contriuit, eumque\n\nknocked him unconscious, and sent his life onto the breeze. He immediately spurred on the stag with his heels and fled, making to return to the forest. At this retainers come rushing out from every direction to follow the prophet through the fields, running fast.\n\nreddidit exanimem, uitamque fugauit in auras.470\n\nOcius inde suum talorum uerbere ceruum\n\ndiffugiens egit siluasque redire parauit.\n\nEgrediuntur ad hec ex omni parte clientes\n\net celeri cursu uatem per rura sequuntur.\n\nBut he got ahead of them so quickly that he would have reached the forest unharmed, if a river had stood in his way. And in fact, as the beast was springing up to cross the torrent, Merlin slipped off its back and fell into the fast-flowing current. The servants line the banks and capture Merlin as he tries to swim away\n\nIlle quidem uelox sic precurrebat, ut isset475\n\nad nemus intactus, nisi preuius amnis obesset.\n\nNam dum torrentem fera prosiliendo mearet,\n\nelapsus rapida cecidit Merlinus in unda.\n\nCircueunt ripas famuli capiuntque natantem\n\nand they bind him and take him to the palace to hand him over to his sister. Once captured, the prophet becomes sad and longs to leave for the forest, and struggles to shake off his shackles, refuses to smile and turns away food and drink, and his sadness makes his sister sad.\n\nadducuntque domum uinctumque dedere sorori.480 Captus item uates fit tristis et optat abire\n\nad siluas, pugnatque suos dissoluere nexus\n\net ridere negat, potumque cibumque refutat,\n\ntristiciaque sua tristem facit esse sororem.\n\nThen, when Rodarcus saw that he was pushing away all cause for joy and refusing to take any food that had been made for him, he took pity and ordered him to be taken him into the city, through the market squares, among the people, so that he could be cheered up by going to see the novelties that were on sale there.\n\nErgo uidens illum Rodarcus pellere cunctam485\n\nleticiam, nec uelle dapes libare paratas.\n\nEduci precepit eum miseratus in urbem\n\nPer fora, per populos ut letior esset eundo\n\nresque uidendo nouas que uendebantur ibidem.\n\nThen when Merlin was taken out and made his way out of the palace, he spies before the gates a servant in pauper’s clothing who was the gate-keeper and in a tremulous voice was asking passers-by for donations to buy clothes. The prophet stopped immediately and laughed, marvelling at the beggar.\n\nErgo uir eductus dum progrederetur ab aula490\n\ninspicit ante fores famulum sub paupere cultu,\n\nqui seruabat eas, poscentem pretereuntes\n\nore tremente uiros ad uestes munus emendas.\n\nMox stetit et risit uates miratus egentem.\n\nMoving on from there, he saw a young man who was holding new shoes and buying some patches. Then he laughed again, and refused to go any further through the market to be stared at by the people he was seeing. But he longed for the forest, towards which he often looked back,\n\nIllinc progressus noua calciamenta tenentem495\n\nspectauit iuuenem commercantemque tacones.\n\nTunc iterum risit renuitque diucius ire\n\nper fora spectandus populis quos inspiciebat.\n\nAt nemus optabat quod crebro respiciebat,\n\nin the forbidden direction towards which he kept trying to turn his steps. The servants came home from that, and reported that Merlin laughed twice and also that he clearly wanted to return to the forest. So Rodarcus, who straightaway wanted to know what he was foretelling with his laugh, had his shackles undone at once,\n\nQuo nitebatur uetitos diuertere gressus.500 Inde domum famuli redeunt, ipsumque cachinnum\n\nbis mouisse ferunt, siluas quoque uelle redire.\n\nOcius ergo uolens Rodarcus scire quid esset\n\nquod portendisset risu, dissoluere nexus\n\ngranting him the ability to return to the lonely forests if only he would explain his laugh. The prophet stood there more cheerfully and answered: ‘The porter at the gates was sitting there in threadbare clothes and begging passers-by\n\nilico iussit, ei concedens posse reuerti505\n\nad solitas siluas si risus exposuisset.\n\nLetior adsistens respondit talia uates: ‘Ianitor ante fores tenui sub ueste sedebat,\n\net uelud esset inops rogitabat pretereuntes\n\nfor money to buy clothes, as if he were poor. But in the meantime, secretly rich, he has got heaps of money hidden underneath him. So I laughed about it. Dig in the ground below him: you’ll find coins that have been hidden for a long time.\n\nvt largirentur sibi quo uestes emerentur.510\n\nIpsemet interea subter se denariorum\n\noccultos cumulos occultus diues habebat.\n\nIllud ergo risi. Tu terram uerte sub ipso:\n\nnummos inuenies seruatos tempore longo.\n\nAfter that I was taken further on and saw a man who was buying shoes and also patches, so that once the shoes get torn and worn into holes, he can repair them and restore them to their former state. So I laughed again about that, because later on that poor man will not be able to use the shoes\n\nIllinc ulterius uersus fora ductus ementem515\n\ncalciamenta uirum uidi pariterque tacones,\n\nvt postquam dissuta forent usuque forata\n\nilla resarciret primosque pararet ad usus.\n\nIllud item risi, quoniam nec calciamentis\n\nor the patches to apply to them, because he has already drowned in the water and is bobbing about by the river-bank. Go and look: you’ll see.’\n\nRodarcus wanted to test Merlin’s words and ordered his servants to go quickly all along the river,\n\nnec superaddendis miser ille taconibus uti520\n\npostmodo compos erit, quia iam submersus in undis\n\nfluctuat ad ripas. Tu uade uidere: uidebis.’\n\nDicta probare uiri cupiens Rodarcus ad amnem\n\ncircumquaque suos iubet ocius ire clientes\n\nto report back quickly if they chanced to find a drowned man along the nearby river-banks. They carried out the ruler’s orders, and in fact going from river to river they come upon the drowned youth on the filthy sand and go back home to tell the king.\n\nvt si forte uirum per proxima littora talem525\n\ndemersum uideant festina uoce renarrent.\n\nIussa ducis peragunt, nam flumina circumeuntes\n\nsubmersum iuuenem squalentes inter harenas\n\ninueniunt, redeuntque domum, regique renarrant.\n\nMeanwhile the king has the gatekeeper moved, and digs and turns over the soil and finds beneath it hidden treasure, and cheerfully praises the prophet.\n\nAnd so when these things were fulfilled, the prophet made haste to get away to his familiar woods, hating the people in the city.\n\nAt rex interea forium custode remoto530\n\nsuffodit, et uertit terram reperitque sub ipsa\n\nthesaurum positum, uatemque iocosus adorat. His igitur gestis, uates properabat abire\n\nad solitas siluas, populos exosus in urbe\n\nThe queen said that he should stay with her and put off going to his longed-for forest until the cold days of hoary winter, pressing in by then, were over and summer came again with its soft fruits, that he could enjoy the sun and warm weather.\n\nprecipiebat ei secum regina manere,535\n\noptatumque nemus postponere donec abirent\n\nque tunc instabant candentis frigora brume\n\natque rediret item teneris cum fructibus estas,\n\nvnde frui posset dum tempora sole calerent.\n\nHe resisted and spoke these words to her too, desperate to escape regardless of the cold: ‘O my beloved sister, why are you so determined to stop me? Winter with its storms cannot deter me, nor the icy north wind when it rages with an unfriendly blast\n\nIlle repugnabat, uerbis quoque talibus illam540\n\nalloquitur, cupiens secedere frigore spreto: ‘O dilecta soror, quid me retinere laboras?\n\nNon me bruma suis poterit terrere procellis.\n\nNon gelidus boreas cum flatu seuit iniquo\n\nand batters the flocks of bleating sheep with sudden hail. Nor does the south wind whip up the seas with continual rain-storms in any way that will stop me from seeking out the solitary places of the forest and the green glades. There, even if the white frost freezes everything up, I will be able to endure the frost, content with little.\n\nbalantumque greges subita cum grandine ledit.545\n\nNon conturbat aquas diffusis imbribus Auster\n\nquin nemorum deserta petam saltusque uirentes.\n\nIllic, cuncta licet substringat cana pruina,\n\ncontentus modico potero perferre pruinam.\n\nThere, it will be a pleasure in the summer to lie under the leaves, among the fragrant flowers and grasses. But so that I am not short of food during the winter-time, build houses in the woods and fill them with servants who will attend to my needs and prepare meals,\n\nIllic arboreis sub frondibus inter olentes550\n\nherbarum flores estate iacere iuuabit.\n\nNe tamen esca michi brumali tempore desit,\n\nin siluis compone domos adhibeque clientes,\n\nobsequiumque michi facient escasque parabunt,\n\nwhile the ground won’t produce grass nor the tree its fruit. Before the other houses, build a remote one to which you will give sixty doors and as many windows, through which when I will come I can see fairy haired Phoebus, and so that by night I can see the stars sliding through the sky,\n\ncum tellus gramen fructumque negauerit arbor.555\n\nAnte domos alias unam compone remotam\n\ncui sex dena decem dabis hostia totque fenestras,\n\nper quas ignicomum uideam cum uenero Phebum,\n\ninspiciamque polo labencia sidera noctu,\n\nwhich will show me the future of the people of this realm, and let there be many scribes ordered to write down what I dictate, eager to record my song on writing-tablets. And you too, o my dearest sister, come often, and then you will be able to ease my hunger with food and drink.’\n\nque me de populo regni uentura docebunt,560\n\ntotque notatores que dicam scribere docti\n\nassint et studeant carmen mandare tabellis.\n\nTu quoque sepe ueni, soror o dilecta, meamque\n\ntunc poteris releuare famem potuque ciboque.’\n\nHe finished speaking and headed towards the woods with hasty steps. And so his sister complied, because she built the hall as he had instructed and the other houses and everything he had asked for. While there is still fruit to be had and Phoebus the sun climbs higher up among the stars, Merlin enjoys staying under the leaves and wandering in the forest,\n\nDixit, et ad siluas festinis gressibus iuit.565\n\nParuit ergo soror, nam iussam condidit aulam\n\natque domos alias, et quicquid iusserat illi.\n\nIlle quidem dum poma manent Phebusque per astra\n\nalcius ascendit, gaudet sub fronde manere\n\nwhile the west wind caresses the rowan. When winter came, bristling with ice-rigid storms, stripping the forest and the ground of all the fruit, so that he would find no food so long as the rain went on falling, sad and hungry he came to this hall.\n\nac peragrare nemus zephiris mulcentibus ornos.570\n\nCumque ueniret hiemps rigidis hirsuta procellis,\n\nque nemus et terras fructu spoliabat ab omni\n\ndeficeretque sibi pluuiis instantibus esca,\n\ntristis et esuriens dictam ueniebat ad aulam.\n\nThe queen went there very often and joyfully brought meals to her brother and drinks too; after he had gained refreshment from a variety of food, he got up quickly and thanked his sister.\n\nThen, on his way back home, he looked up at the stars\n\nIllic multociens aderat regina, dapesque575\n\net potum pariter fratri gauisa ferebat,\n\nqui, postquam uariis sese recreauerat escis,\n\nmox assurgebat complaudebatque sorori.\n\nDeinde domum peragrans ad sidera respiciebat,\n\nwhile singing about the things which he knew were at that point yet to come: ‘O madness of the Britons, whom an abundance to overflowing of wealth puffs up more than it should. They are not interested in enjoying peace, they are driven on by the Fury’s goads. They join in in civil wars and domestic disputes.\n\ntalia dum caneret que tunc uentura sciebat:580 ‘O rabiem Britonum, quos copia diuiciarum\n\nvsque superueniens ultra quam debeat effert!\n\nNolunt pace frui, stimulis agitantur Herinis.\n\nCiuiles acies cognataque prelia miscent.\n\nThey let the Lord’s churches go to rack and ruin and expel holy bishops to far kingdoms. The descendants of the boar of Cornwall throw everything into disarray; they slaughter each other, setting ambushes with their wicked swords, and do not want to\n\nEcclesias Domini paciuntur habere ruinam,585\n\npontificesque sacros ad regna remota repellunt.\n\nCornubiensis apri conturbant queque nepotes;\n\ninsidias sibimet ponentes ense nefando\n\ninterimunt sese, nec regno iure potiri\n\nwait to take control of the kingdom by right but would rather seize the crown.\n\nThe fourth one will be crueller and harsher than the rest. After this, the sea-wolf will take up battle and win through to drive his defeated enemy beyond the Severn into uncharted realms. He will besiege Cirencester\n\nexpectare uolunt; regni diademate rapto.590\n\nIllis quartus erit crudelior asperiorque. Hinc lupus equoreus debellans uincet et ultra\n\nSabrinam uictum per barbara regna fugabit.\n\nInde Kaerkeri circumdabit obsidione,\n\nand with the help of sparrows he will raze to the ground houses and walls. He will make for Gaul with a fleet but will die at the point of a king’s spear. Rodarcus is going to die, and after his death lengthy discord will overtake the Scots and the Cumbrians for a long time, until Cumbria is made over to a growing tooth.\n\npasseribusque domos et menia trudet ad imum.595\n\nClasse petet Gallos, sed telo regis obibit.\n\nRodarcus moritur, post quem discordia longa\n\nScotos et Cumbros per longum tempus habebit,\n\ndonec crescenti tribuatur Cumbria denti.\n\nThe Welsh will wage war against the people of Gwent, the people of Gwent against the Cornish, and there will be no law to tame them. Wales will always enjoy spilling blood. O race hostile to God, why do you take pleasure in blood-shed? Wales will force brothers to wage war\n\nKambri Geuuissos, Geuuissi Cornubienses600\n\nafficient bello, nec eos lex ulla domabit.\n\nKambria gaudebit diffuso sanguine semper.\n\nGens inimica Deo, quid gaudes sanguine fuso?\n\nKambria compellet fratres committere pugnas\n\nand to condemn their descendants to a shameful death. Hoards of Scots will regularly cross the Humber and kill those who resist them, without mercy. Not with impunity, though, because their leader will be cut down and killed. He who shows savagery while riding a horse will take its name.\n\net dampnare suos scelerata morte nepotes.605 Scottorum cunei trans Humbrum sepius ibunt\n\nobstantesque uiros periment pietate remota.\n\nNon impune tamen, nam cesus ductor obibit.\n\nNomen habebit equi qui fiet seuus in illo.\n\nHis heir will be driven out of our lands and go elsewhere.\n\nYou Scot, put away your sword that you are too quick to unsheathe: your strength will prove unequal to our fierce race. The city of Dumbarton will fall, and no king will ever rebuild it until the Scot submits to the little boar.\n\nFinibus ex nostris heres expulsus abibit.610\n\nScotte, reconde tuos quos nudas ocius enses,\n\nvis tibi dispar erit nostra cum gente feroci Corruet urbs Alclud, nec eam reparabit in euum\n\nrex aliquis, donec subdatur Scottus apello.\n\nThe city of Carlisle, robbed of its shepherd, will stay empty until the lion’s sceptre gives it back the crozier. The city, the towers and the great halls of Segontium will lament aloud and in ruins until the Welsh go back to their old haunts. Porchester will see its walls lie smashed in the harbour\n\nVrbs Loel spoliata suo pastore uacabit,615\n\ndonec reddat ei cambucam uirga Leonis. Vrbs Sigeni et turres et magna palacia plangent\n\ndiruta, donec eant ad pristina predia Kambri. Kaerperis in portu sua menia rupta uidebit,\n\nuntil a wealthy man with a fox’s tooth will rebuild them. The city of Richborough will lie strewn on its shoreline: a man from Flanders will come in a galley and rebuild it. The fifth after him will rebuild the walls of St Davids, and by him also the pallium taken away years ago will be returned.\n\ndonec eam locuplex cum uulpis dente reformet.620 Vrbs Rutupi portus in litore strata iacebit,\n\nrestaurabit eam galeata naue Ruthenus. Menia Meneuie reparabit quintus ab illo,\n\nper quem palla sibi reddetur dempta per annos.\n\nIn your bosom, Severn, the City of the Legions will fall and will lose its citizens for many years. When the Bear in the lamb’s clothing comes, he will restore them.\n\nSaxon kings will for a long time occupy cities, fields and homes too after they have driven out the citizens.\n\nInque tuo, Sabrina, sinu cadet Vrbs Legionum,625\n\namittetque suos ciues per tempora longa.\n\nHos sibi reddet item cum uenerit ursus in agno.\n\nSaxonici reges expulsis ciuibus urbes,\n\nrura domosque simul per tempora longa tenebunt.\n\nAmong them thrice three dragons will wear the crown.\n\nTwo hundred monks will be killed in the city of Leicester, and the Saxon will empty the walls once the leader has been expelled.\n\nHe who, first among Angles, wears the crown of Brutus, will restore the city emptied by these massacres.\n\nEx his gestabunt ter tres diadema dracones.630 Ducenti monachi perimentur in urbe Leyri\n\net duce depulso uacuabit menia Saxo.\n\nQui prior ex Anglis erit in diademate Bruti,\n\nrestaurabit item uacuatam cedibus urbem.\n\nThis fierce people will forbid consecration with chrism throughout the land and will set up the gods’ idols in the houses of God. Afterwards, Rome will restore God with the help of one in a cowl and the priest will sprinkle his houses with holy water, and will renew them, with shepherds again placed within them.\n\nGens fera per patriam prohibebit crisma sacrare,635\n\ninque Dei domibus ponet simulachra deorum. Postmodo Roma Deum reddet mediante cuculla,\n\nrorabitque domos sacro sacer ymbre sacerdos,\n\nquas renouabit item pastoribus intro locatis.\n\nFrom then on, they will keep the commandments of God’s law and many of them will rightly attain heaven. But a wicked people, full of venom, will again defile this and at the same time will violently mix up what is right and what is wrong. It will sell its sons and relatives into remote lands overseas,\n\nLegis diuine seruabunt iussa subinde,640\n\nplures ex illis et celo iure fruentur.\n\nId uiolabit item gens impia plena ueneno,\n\nmiscebitque simul uiolenter fasque nefasque,\n\nvendet in extremos fines trans equora natos,\n\nand will face God’s wrath. O unspeakable sin, that people whom the Maker of the world deemed worthy of the honour of heaven and created free should be sold and led along, tethered, like an ox! You, pitiful dragon, will desist, you who once were\n\ncognatosque suos iramque Tonantis inibit.645\n\nO scelus infandum, quem Conditor orbis honore\n\nceli dignatus cum libertate creauit,\n\nillum more bouis uendi ducique ligatum!\n\nCessabis miserande draco, qui proditor olim\n\na traitor to the Lord, when you first came to the kingdom. The Danes will come with a fleet, and once the people have been brought into subjection, they will rule for a short time before they are driven out and retreat. Two men will give laws to the ones whom the Snake, forgetting the pact, will smite with the sting of its tail for the sake of the crown of the realm.\n\nin Dominum fueras, cum primum regna subisti.650 Classe superuenient Daci, populoque subacto\n\nregnabunt breuiter, propulsatique redibunt.\n\nHis duo iura dabunt, quos ledet acumine caude\n\nfederis oblitus pro sceptri stegmate serpens.\n\nThen the Normans, borne across the sea in ships with faces at the front and faces at the back, will attack the Angles fiercely with iron mailshirts and sharp swords, will cut them down and gain the battlefield. They will bring many kingdoms into subjection and they will tame\n\nIndeque Neustrenses ligno trans equora uecti,655\n\nvultus ante suos et uultus retro ferentes,\n\nferratis tunicis et acutis ensibus Anglos\n\nacriter inuadent, periment campoque fruentur.\n\nPlurima regna sibi submittent, atque domabunt\n\nforeign peoples for generations, until Erinys,\n\nIn Greek mythology the Erinyes were female deities of vengeance, the Furies of Roman mythology, represented as winged.\n\nflying hither and yon, pours out her poison upon them. Then peace and trust and every virtue will be gone: everywhere citizens will wage war all through their homelands, and man will betray man: a friend will be hard to come by.\n\nexternas gentes per tempora, donec Erinus660\n\ncircumquaque uolans uirus diffundet in ipsos.\n\nTunc pax atque fides et uirtus omnis abibit,\n\nvndique per patrias committent prelia ciues,\n\nvirque uirum prodet: non inuenietur amicus.\n\nHusband will spurn wife and visit whores instead, and wife, her husband spurned, will lie with anyone she lusts after. There will be no respect for churches, good order will perish. Then bishops will bear arms, then they will follow the camps, will raise up towers and walls on holy ground,\n\nConiuge despecta meretrices sponsus adibit,665\n\nsponsaque cui cupiet despecto coniuge nubet.\n\nNon honor ecclesiis seruabitur, ordo peribit.\n\nPontifices tunc arma ferent, tunc castra sequentur,\n\nin tellure sacra turres et menia ponent,\n\nand give to soldiers what is due to the poor. Carried away by wealth, they will tread a worldly path and steal from God what the mitre forbids them to have. Three will wear the crown, and after them will come that approval for new men. A fourth will wield the sceptre but inept piety will do him no good\n\nmilitibusque dabunt quod deberetur egenis.670\n\nDiuiciis rapti mundano tramite current,\n\neripientque Deo quod sacra tyara uetabit.\n\nTres diadema ferent, post quos fauor ille nouorum.\n\nQuartus erit sceptris, pietas cui leua nocebit\n\nuntil he wears his father’s clothing so that, girt with the boar’s teeth, he passes over the shadow of the helmeted man. Four will be anointed one by one, seeking the highest rank, and two will succeed who will alternate in wearing the crown such that they stir the Gauls into ferocious wars against them.\n\ndonec sit genitore suo uestitus, ut apri675\n\ndentibus accinctus galeati transeat umbram.\n\nQuatuor ungentur uice uersa summa petentes\n\net duo succedent, qui sic diadema rotabunt\n\nvt moueant Gallos in se fera bella mouere.\n\nThe sixth will overthrow the Irish and their walls, and will be pious and prudent and will restore peoples and cities. These things I once sang at greater length to Vortigern,\n\nThe king of the Britons to whom the young Merlin made his prophecies, as told in Prophetiae Merlini and in De gestis Britonum (= Historia regum Britanniae).\n\nexplaining the mystic battles of the two dragons to him, as we sat together on the shore of the drained lake.\n\nSextus Hibernenses et eorum menia uertet,680\n\nqui pius et prudens populos renouabit et urbes.\n\nHec Vortigerno cecini prolixius olim,\n\nexponendo duum sibi mistica bella draconum,\n\nin ripa stagni quando consedimus hausti.\n\nBut now, my beloved sister, go home and see the dying king and tell Telgesinus\n\nThis character, a companion of Merlin, is partially inspired by the sixth-century bard Taliesin.\n\nto come, because I want to talk to him about many things. For he recently came back from the Breton lands, where he learned the sweet teachings of Gildas the Wise.’\n\nGildas the Wise, the sixth-century author of the De excidio et conquestu Britanniae. According to Breton sources he spent part of his life in Brittany, where he first lived as a hermit and then founded a monastery in Rhuys, Brittany.\n\nAt tu uade domum morientem uisere regem,685\n\no dilecta soror, Telgesinoque uenire\n\nprecipe, namque loqui desidero plurima secum.\n\nVenit enim nouiter de partibus armoricanis,\n\ndulcia quo didicit sapientis dogmata Gilde.’\n\nGanieda goes home and finds that Telgesinus has indeed returned and that the king has died and his retainers are grieving. So, in floods of tears she falls down among her friends and tears her hair and utters these words:‘Women, mourn with me the death of Rodarcus\n\nIt Ganieda domum, Telgesinumque reuersum690\n\ndefunctumque ducem reperit tristesque clientes.\n\nErgo fluens lacrimis collabitur inter amicos\n\net laniat crines, et profert talia dicens: ‘Funera Rodarchi, mulieres, plangite mecum,\n\nand weep over a man the like of whom the earth has not produced in our age, as far as we can tell. He was a lover of peace, for he gave laws to fierce people, so that no violence was done by anyone to any other. He behaved towards the holy clergy with a righteous rule,\n\nac deflete uirum qualem non protulit orbis,695\n\nhactenus in nostro quantum discernimus euo.\n\nPacis amator erat, populo nam iura feroci\n\nsic dabat, ut nulli uis inferretur ab ullo.\n\nTractabat sanctum iusto moderamine clerum,\n\nand allowed both the most exalted and the humble ones to be ruled by their own law. He was generous, for he gave much, barely kept anything. He was all things to all men, doing to each as was right for them. He was the flower of knights, the adornment of kings and the pillar of the kingdom. Alas! What you were before is now given\n\niure regi proprio summos humilesque sinebat.700\n\nLargus erat, nam multa dabat, uix quid retinebat.\n\nOmnibus omnis erat, faciens quod quemque decebat.\n\nFlos equitum, regumque decor, regnique columpna.\n\nHeu modo qui fueras inopinis uermibus esca\n\nto the worms to eat, and your body rots in the grave. After the silken sheets, is this the bed that awaits you, and will that lily-white flesh, royal limbs, be buried under the cold stone, and will you be nothing but dust and bones? It is indeed so. For the pitiable lot of humankind unfolds through the ages\n\nnunc datus es, corpusque tuum putrescit in urna.705\n\nHoc ne cubile tibi post serica fulcra paratur,\n\nsiccine sub gelido caro candida regia membra\n\ncondentur saxo, nec eris nisi puluis et ossa?\n\nSic equidem. Nam sors hominum miseranda per euum\n\nin such a way that they cannot be restored to their former powers. So the fleeting world’s glory is good for nothing: it comes and goes, deceives and afflicts the mighty. The bee entices with its honey and then stings afterwards. So the mutable glory of the world deceives those\n\nducitur, ut nequeant ad pristina iura reduci.710\n\nErgo nichil prodest pereuntis gloria mundi,\n\nque fugit atque redit, fallit leditque potentes.\n\nMelle suo delinit apes, quod postmodo pungit.\n\nSic quos demulsit diuertens gloria mundi\n\nit has charmed and caressed, then smites them with a flick of its nasty tail. That which seems good lasts but a short time, what it has does not endure and everything it confers passes away like flowing water. What does it matter if the rose blossoms red, if the white lilies bloom, if a man or a horse or many other things are fair?\n\nfallit, et ingrate collidit uerbere caude.715\n\nFit breue quod prestat, quod habet durabile non est:\n\nmore fluentis aque transit quodcumque ministrat.\n\nQuid rosa si rutilet, si candida lilia uernent,\n\nsi sit pulcher homo uel equus uel cetera plura?\n\nThese things come from the Creator not the world. Therefore, happy are those who stand firm with a pious heart and give due service to God and leave the world behind. Christ, who reigns without end, who created everything, will grant them an existence in everlasting glory.\n\nIsta Creatori, non mundo sunt referenda.720\n\nFelices igitur qui perstant corde piato,\n\nobsequiumque Deo faciunt, mundumque relinquunt.\n\nIllis perpetuo fungi concedet honore,\n\nqui sine fine regit Christus, qui cuncta creauit.\n\nAnd so I leave you, nobles, and you high walls and houses, and you, my sweet children, and all worldly things, and I shall dwell in the woods with my brother and I will worship God with a joyful mind, under cover of my black cloak.’ She said these things and paid due tribute to her husband\n\nVos igitur, proceres, uos menia celsa, laresque,725\n\nvos, nati dulces, mundanaque cuncta relinquo,\n\net cum fratre meo siluas habitabo, Deumque\n\nleta mente colam, nigri cum tegmine pepli.’\n\nHec ait atque suo persoluit iusta marito,\n\nand inscribed his grave with this poem: ‘Rodarcus the Generous, than whom no one on earth was more generous, a great man, rests in this modest urn.’ Meanwhile, Telgesinus had come to see Merlin the prophet, sent by him to find out\n\nsignauitque suam cum tali carmine tumbam:730 ‘Rodarcus Largus, quo largior alter in orbe\n\nnon erat, hic modica magnus requiescit in urna.’ Venerat interea Merlinum uisere uatem\n\ntunc Telgesinus, qui discere missus ab illo\n\nwhat wind or storms there were, for a mixture of these two were both then approaching and were forming clouds. With the help of his companion Minerva,\n\nThe Roman goddess of wisdom, here just an allegory for wisdom.\n\nhe delivered this teaching: ‘The Creator of the world wrought four elements out of nothing, so that they would be the prior cause from which everything would be created, and at the same time\n\nquid uentus nimbusue foret, nam mixtus uterque735\n\ntunc simul instabant et nubila conficiebant.\n\nHec documenta dabat socia dictante Minerua: ‘Quatuor ex nichilo produxit Conditor orbis,\n\nvt fierent rebus precedens causa creandis\n\nthe substance, yoked together in harmonious peace. The sky, which he painted with stars, at the same time stands high above and also encloses everything, like the shell around a nut. Next, He created the air, suited for shaping sounds: it is the setting in which the heavenly bodies bestow day and night.\n\nmateriesque simul concordi pace iugata.740\n\nCelum, quod stellis depinxit, et alcius extat\n\net quasi testa nucem circumdans omnia claudit. Aera deinde dedit formandis uocibus aptum,\n\nquo mediante dies et noctes sidera prestant.\n\nAnd He made the sea, which girds the earth and, winding round in four directions, flows back to strike the air so as to beget the winds, of which there are said to be four. And He placed the earth which stands still by its own strength and does not easily move and is divided into five parts,\n\nEt mare, quod terras cingit refluoque recursu745\n\nquatuor anfractus faciens, sic aera pulsat\n\nvt generet uentos, qui quatuor esse feruntur. Vique sua stantem nec se leuitate mouentem\n\nsupposuit terram partes in quinque resectam.\n\nof which the middle one is not habitable because of the heat, and the two outermost are shunned because of the cold. He allowed the two remaining parts to have a mild climate: humans, birds and herds of wild beasts inhabit these. He added the clouds to the sky, so that with their gentle sprinkling\n\nQuarum que media est non est habitanda calore,750\n\nextremeque due pre frigore diffugiuntur.\n\nTemperiem reliquis permisit habere duabus:\n\nhas homines habitant uolucresque gregesque ferarum. Vtque daret subitas pluuias quo crescere fructus\n\nthey might give sudden rains by which they make the fruits of the trees and of the earth grow; with the help of the sun, like leather bags the clouds are filled up from the rivers, by an unseen force. Then, ascending high up through ether, impelled by the strength of the winds, they pour out the water they have taken up.\n\narboris et terre facerent aspergine miti,755\n\nadiecit celo nubes, que sole ministro\n\nsicut utres fluuiis occulta lege replentur.\n\nInde per excelsum scandentes ethera, sumptos\n\ndiffundunt latices uentorum uiribus acte.\n\nFrom this comes the rain, from this the snow, from this the round hailstone when the cold or wet wind stirs its gusts and, penetrating the clouds, draws out the torrents it has formed. Each of the winds takes its nature from the zone it is closest to when born.\n\nHinc fiunt imbres, hinc nix, hinc grando rotunda760\n\ncum gelidus madidusue mouet sua flamina uentus,\n\nqui nubes penetrans quales facit egerit amnes.\n\nNaturamque suam zonarum proximitate\n\nventorum sibi quisque trahit dum nascitur illuc.\n\nBelow the firmament, where He fixed the bright planets, He placed the ether and gave it to the angelic hosts to dwell in: a worthy gazing upon God and His marvellous sweetness is their refreshment forever. This firmament He also painted with stars and with the brilliant sun,\n\nPost firmamentum quo lucida sidera fixit765\n\nethereum celum posuit, tribuitque colendum\n\ncetibus angelicis, quos contemplatio digna\n\nac dulcedo Dei reficit miranda per euum.\n\nHoc quoque depinxit stellis et sole chorusco\n\nimposing the rule by which a star can traverse the part of sky entrusted to it, with a fixed boundary. Afterwards he placed beneath the ether the air, lit by the moon’s body; this overflows, throughout all its upper regions, with crowds of spirits, who suffer with us\n\nindicens legem que certo limite stella770\n\nper sibi commissum posset discurrere celum. Postmodo supposuit lunari corpore fulgens\n\naereum celum, quod per loca celsa redundat\n\nspirituum cuneis qui nobis compaciuntur\n\nand rejoice with us, when we are touched by one feeling or another. They are accustomed to carrying mortals’ prayers through the air and begging God to be favourable to them, and reporting back God’s will through a dream or a voice or other signs, so that humans know it thereby.\n\net colletantur dum sic aliterue mouemur.775\n\nSuntque preces hominum soliti deferre per auras,\n\natque rogare Deum quod sit placabilis illis.\n\nAffectumque Dei sompno uel uoce referre\n\nvel signis aliis, ut fiant inde scientes.\n\nBut below, under the moon, the sky teems with evil spirits, who have learned how to deceive us and try to tempt us, and very often, plucking a body out of thin air, they appear to us and many things often result from that. They even rape women\n\nAt cacodemonibus post lunam suptus habundat780\n\nqui nos decipiunt et temptant fallere docti,\n\net sibi multociens ex aere corpore sumpto\n\nnobis apparent et plurima sepe secuntur.\n\nQuin etiam coitu mulieres aggrediuntur\n\nand make them pregnant, begetting in an unholy way. So, then, He made the skies to be inhabited by three orders of spirits, so that they can dance attendance upon every single thing and renew the world by renewing the seed of things. And He divided the sea into a variety of kinds, so that from itself\n\net faciunt grauidas, generantes more prophano.785\n\nSic igitur celos habitatos ordine terno\n\nspirituum fecit, foueant ut singula queque\n\nac renouet mundum renouato germine rerum. Et mare per species uarias distinxit, ut ex se\n\nit can produce the shapes of things, begetting them throughout the ages. For one part boils, one freezes, and one takes its mild temperature from the other two and provides us with food. The boiling one lies around a pit full of angry races of people, and ebbing and flowing with its various streams it separates off the world of darkness,\n\nproferret rerum formas generando per euum.790\n\nPars etenim feruet, pars friget, et una duabus\n\ntemperiem sumens nobis alimenta ministrat. Ast ea que feruet baratrum cum gentibus acris\n\ncircuit, et tetrum diuersis fluctibus orbem\n\nheaping fire on fire. To that place descend those who transgress laws and, once they have put God aside, they go where their perverse will wishes, keen to spoil anything that is forbidden them. A harsh judge stands there, weighing with well-balanced scales\n\nsecernit refluens, ignes ex ignibus augens.795\n\nIllic descendunt qui leges transgrediuntur,\n\npostpositoque Deo quo uult peruersa uoluntas\n\nincedunt auidi corrumpere quod prohibentur.\n\nTrux ibi stat iudex equali lance rependens,\n\nthe merit of each, and pays what is worthily due. The other sea, which is cold, rolls over the precious sands which it is the first to produce from the nearby vapour which arises when Venus’ star applies its rays. The Arabs maintain that this star begets glittering gems\n\ncuique suum meritum condignaque debita soluit.800 Altera que friget preciosas uoluit harenas,\n\nquas secum gignit uicino prima uapore\n\nquando suos radios immiscet stella Diones.\n\nHanc perhibent Arabes gemmas generare micantes,\n\nwhen it passes through Pisces, when glances upon the ocean with its flames. With their power, these gems benefit those who wear them and restore many to health and keep them safe. These the Maker divided into species, like everything else, so that we can clearly tell their\n\ndum peragrat Pisces, dum respicit equora flammis.805\n\nHec uirtute sua populis gestantibus ipsas\n\nprosunt, et multos reddunt seruantque salubres.\n\nHas quoque per species distinxit ut omnia Factor,\n\nvt discernamus per formas, perque colores\n\nkind and value from their shapes and colours. The third kind of sea which surrounds our world provides us with many good things, by being close to us. For it feeds the fish, and produces salt from its water, carries off and carries back again the ships which carry our wares,\n\ncuius sint generis, cuius uirtutis aperte.810 Tercia forma maris, que nostram circuit orbem,\n\nproximitate sua nobis bona multa ministrat.\n\nNutrit enim pisces, et sal producit ab unda,\n\nfertque refertque rates commercia nostra ferentes,\n\nfrom which a poor man may suddenly become rich thanks to his profits. This sea makes the adjacent soil fertile and nourishes the birds, which they say are born from it, as well as the fish, even though they move about by a different law of nature. For the sea can overwhelm birds more than fish\n\nvnde suo lucro subito fit diues egenus.815\n\nVicinam fecundat humum pascitque uolucres,\n\nquas perhibent ortas illinc cum piscibus esse,\n\ndissimilique tamen nature iure mouentur.\n\nPlus etenim dominatur eis quam piscibus equor,\n\nso they fly away through the sky, lightly borne aloft to make for the heights. But its water presses down upon fish and keeps them under the waves, and does not let them continue living on dry land. Their Maker also divided them up according to their species and provided a different nature for each, so that\n\nvnde leues excelsa petunt per inane uolantes.820\n\nAt pisces suus humor agit reprimitque sub undis,\n\nnec sinit ut uiuant dum sicca luce fruuntur.\n\nHos quoque per species distinxit Factor eorum\n\nnaturamque dedit distinctis, unde per euum\n\nthey might be marvelled at and provide healing for the sick. So, for example, they say that the mullet damps down the heat of lust, but it blinds the eyes of anyone who eats it all the time. And the timallus (grayling), which is named after the plant called thyme, because it has an odour, gives away anyone that eats it very often,\n\nmirandi fierent egrotantique salubres.825 Nempe ferunt mullum cohibere libidinis estum,\n\nsed reddit cecos iugiter uescentis ocellos. At qui nomen habet timeos de flore timallus\n\nsic quoniam redolet, uescentem sepius illo\n\nand these fishes give off a scent while in the river. They say that morays, contrary to the laws of nature, are all female, but they nonetheless copulate and reproduce and multiply their offspring with the seed of another species. For serpents often gather on the shores\n\nprotrahit, ut tales oleant per flumina pisces.830 Feminei sexus subtracto iure murenas\n\nesse ferunt cunctas, coeunt tamen ac renouantur,\n\nmultiplicantque suos alieno germine fetus.\n\nConueniunt etenim per litora sepius angues\n\nwhere they live and make sounds and hiss appealingly and in this way, by attracting the morays, they mate in the normal way. It is an amazing fact that the remora, half a foot long, can stick to a ship and hold it in the sea as if it were anchored to the shore, and it does not let it go\n\nquo degunt faciuntque sonos ac sibila grata,835\n\net sic eductis coeunt ex more murenis. Est quoque mirandum quod semipedalis echinus\n\nherens, cui fuerit fixam quasi littore nauem\n\ndetinet in ponto, nec eam permittet abire\n\nuntil it chooses to swim away: this power means it is to be feared. The one which they call fish-sword, because it does damage with its sharp snout, is very often dreaded by sailors if it comes near their ship; because if it gets underneath a ship, it can straightaway bore through it and sink the holed ship in a sudden swirl of water.\n\ndonec discedat, tali uirtute timendus.840 Quemque uocant gladium, quia rostro ledit acuto,\n\nsepius hunc naute metuunt accedere naui;\n\nnam si subtus erit confestim perforat illam\n\net mergit sectam subito cum gurgite nauem.\n\nThe sawfish is to be dreaded by boats because of its fins, with which it punctures them when it swims underneath, and after damaging them, it tosses them into the waves: a fish to be feared for a fin like a sword. The sea-dragon, which is said to have venom underneath its fins, is to be dreaded by those who catch it,\n\nFitque suis cristis metuendus serra carinis,845\n\nquas infigit eis dum subnatat, atque secatas\n\ndeicit in fluctus, crista uelud ense timendus. Equoreusque draco, qui fertur habere uenenum\n\nsub pennis, metuendus erit capientibus illum,\n\nand whenever it stings, it does harm by pouring out its venom. By contrast the crampfish is said to cause other injuries: for the arms and the feet of anyone who touches it while it is still alive suddenly become stiff, and other limbs are deprived of their functions as if dead,\n\net quociens pungit ledit fundendo uenenum.850 Ast alias clades torpedo fertur habere,\n\nnam qui tangit eam uiuentem protinus illi\n\nbrachia cum pedibus torpent, et cetera membra\n\nofficioque suo quasi mortua destituuntur.\n\nso poisonous is its bodily secretion. God provided the sea with these and other fishes, and He placed many islands in its waves, which humans inhabit because of the fertility they found there, which the earth produces with its fruitful soil.\n\nSic solet esse nocens illius corporis aura.855\n\nHis Deus ac aliis ditauit piscibus equor\n\nadiecitque suis plures in fluctibus orbes,\n\nquos habitant homines pro fertilitate reperta, quam producit ibi fecundo cespite tellus.\n\nOf these islands, Britain is said to be the foremost and the best, because by its abundance it produces all things. For it bears crops that yield the valuable gift of grain, rendering it up for human use year by year; woods and forests dripping with honey,\n\nQuarum prima quidem meliorque Britannia fertur,860\n\nvbertate sua producens singula rerum.\n\nFert etenim segetes que nobile munus adoris\n\nvsibus humanis tribuunt reddendo per annum;\n\nsiluas et saltus et ab his stillancia mella,\n\nhigh mountains and widely-blossoming meadows, springs and rivers, fish and flocks and wild beasts, fruit from the trees, gems, precious metals and everything that Mother Nature is accustomed to offer. It also has healing springs, with hot water\n\naerios montes lateque uirencia prata,865\n\nfontes et fluuios, pisces pecudesque ferasque,\n\narboreos fructus, gemmas, preciosa metalla\n\net quicquid prestare solet natura creatrix.\n\nPreterea fontes unda feruente salubres,\n\nwhich nurses the sick and provides welcome baths, and soon restores them to health, taking away their sickness. So Bladud, while he was ruling the realm, established them and gave them the name of Alaron, his wife.\n\nBladud is the legendary founder of Bath. There is no other mention of Bladud’s wife, Alaron.\n\nTheir water is useful for many diseases because of its healing power,\n\nque fouet egrotos et balnea grata ministrat,870\n\nat subito sanos pellit languore repulso. Sic Bladudus eos regni dum sceptra teneret\n\nconstituit, nomenque sue consortis Alaron.\n\nVtilis ad plures laticis medicamine morbos,\n\nbut especially for women’s diseases, as it has proved many times. Next to this island is Thanet, which abounds in many things: it has no deadly snakes, and if its earth is mixed with wine and drunk, it removes venom. Our sea separates us from the Orkneys.\n\nsed mage femineos, ut sepius unda probauit.875 Adiacet huic Thanatos, que multis rebus habundat:\n\nmortifero serpente caret, tollitque uenenum\n\nsi sua cum uino tellus commixta bibatur. Orchades a nobis nostrum quoque diuidit equor.\n\nThey are thirty-three altogether, divided by channels flowing between: twenty of them lack any inhabitant, the others are inhabited. The furthest point is called Ultima Thule, named after the sun, because when the summer sun makes its solstice there, it turns aside its rays so that it does not shine beyond that place\n\nHee tres ter dene seiuncto flumine fiunt,880\n\nbis dene cultore carent, alieque coluntur. Vltima que Tyle nomen de sole recepit\n\npropter solsticium quod sol estiuus ibidem\n\ndum facit, auertit radium ne luceat ultra\n\nand takes daylight away, so that with perpetual night the atmosphere produces darkness and also makes the sea frozen with cold, sluggish and inaccessible to ships. The island said to be the most distinguished of all after ours is Ireland, because of her blessed fertility.\n\nabducitque dies ut semper nocte perhenni885\n\naer agat tenebras, faciat quoque frigore pontum\n\nconcretum pigrumque simul ratibusque negatum. Insula post nostram prestancior omnibus esse\n\nfertur hibernensis felici fertilitate.\n\nFor it is the next largest, and it does not produce either bees or birds except a few, and it does not permit snakes to reproduce at all. Hence it happens that if some earth or stone taken from there is scattered, it drives snakes and bees away. Next to the Herculean Gades\n\nModern Cadiz.\n\nis the island of Gades:\n\nEst etenim maior, nec apes, nec aues nisi raras890\n\neducit, penitusque negat generare colubres.\n\nVnde fit ut tellus illinc auecta lapisue,\n\nsi superaddatur, serpentes tollat apesque. Gadibus herculeis adiungitur insula Gades:\n\nhere a tree grows, from whose bark a gum drips which turns glass into gems when it is smeared over it. The Hesperides are claimed to have a watchful dragon, which, so they say, guards the golden apples under the leafy boughs. Women with goat-bodies inhabit the Gorgades,\n\nnascitur hic arbor cuius de cortice gummi895\n\nstillat, quo gemme fiunt superillita uitra.\n\nHesperides uigilem perhibentur habere draconem,\n\nquem seruare ferunt sub frondibus aurea poma.\n\nGorgades habitant mulieres corporis hirci,\n\nand they are said to outstrip hares with their swift running. As it is said, Argyre and Chryse render gold and silver as readily as Corinth produces common rocks. Taprobana (Sri Lanka), comely with its fruitful soil, is verdant: for in a single year it produces two crops,\n\nque celeri cursu lepores superare feruntur.900 Argire Crisseque gerunt ut dicitur aurum\n\nargentumque simul ceu uilia saxa Corinthus. Taprobana uiret fecundo cespite grata:\n\nbis etenim segetes anno producit in uno\n\nit has two summers and two springs, twice renders grapes and other fruit; it is much loved for its shining gems. The island of Atilis [Tiles] produces verdant flowers and vegetation in an everlasting spring, green all year round. The island of the apples which is called Fortunate,\n\nGeoffrey calls this island Insula pomorum (‘Island of the apples’) or Fortunata, while his main source for these lists, Isidore of Seville, writes of a group of islands that he calls fortunatarum insulae, a name that according to Isidore suggests that they provide all goods. In De gestis Britonum Geoffrey identified the island where the wounded Arthur was brought with Avalon.\n\nbis gerit estatem, bis uer, bis colligit uuas,905\n\net fructus alios nitidis gratissima gemmis. Atilis eterno producit uere uirentes\n\nflores et frondes per tempora cuncta uirendo.\n\nInsula pomorum, que Fortunata uocatur,\n\ntakes its name from the fact that it produces everything by itself. It does not need any farmers to plough the fields, there is no cultivation at all, apart from what nature affords. It spontaneously produces plentiful crops and grapes and fruits born in its woods from the precious stock.\n\nex re nomen habet quia per se singula profert.910\n\nNon opus est illi sulcantibus arua colonis,\n\nomnis abest cultus nisi quem natura ministrat.\n\nVltro fecundas segetes producit et uuas\n\nnataque poma suis precioso germine siluis.\n\nThe soil produces everything instead of the plants in spontaneous abundance; life there lasts a hundred years or more. There nine sisters give out laws with a kindly rule over those who come to visit them from our regions. Among them the eldest is the most learned in the art of healing\n\nOmnia gignit humus uice graminis ultro redundans;915\n\nannis centenis aut ultra uiuitur illic.\n\nIllic iura nouem geniali lege sorores\n\ndant his qui ueniunt nostris ex partibus ad se.\n\nQuarum que prior est fit doctior arte medendi\n\nand outshines her sisters in her remarkable beauty. Morgen is her name\n\nThis is the first literary appearance of the Arthurian character that will become better known as Morgan le Fay.\n\nand she learned the healing properties of all plants so that she can cure ailing bodies. She also knows the art of changing her own shape and how to cut through the air on new-made wings, like Daedalus.\n\nIn Greek mythology Daedalus was the builder of the labyrinth in Crete, who, once imprisoned by King Minos, flew away using some wings he made with feathers and wax.\n\nexceditque suas forma prestante sorores.920\n\nMorgen ei nomen didicitque quid utilitatis\n\ngramina cuncta ferant ut languida corpora curet.\n\nArs quoque nota sibi qua scit mutare figuram\n\net resecare nouis quasi Dedalus aera pennis.\n\nWhen she chooses, she is in Brest, Chartres or Pavia; when she wants, she glides down out of the sky to our shores. Her sisters – Moronoe, Moroe, Glitorn, Glitonea, Gliten, Tythonoe, Tythen, as well as Tithen,\n\nMorgan/Morgen’s sisters are not otherwise known.\n\nhighly renowned for her harp – say she learned astrology.\n\nCum uult est Bristi, Carnoti siue Papie,925\n\ncum uult in nostris ex aere labitur horis.\n\nHancque mathematicam dicunt didicisse sorores\n\nMoronoe, Moroe, Glitorn, Glitonea, Gliten,\n\nTythonoe, Tythen, cithara notissima Tithen.\n\nThere after the battle of Camlan\n\nThe final battle between Arthur and his nephew Mordred. According to Welsh traditions, it was fought in 537.\n\nwe brought the wounded Arthur, with Barinthus\n\nThis helmsman is probably connected to St Brendan’s nephew, the monk Barinthus, who makes his appearance at the very beginning of the Navigatio sancti Brendani.\n\nguiding us, to whom the seas and stars of the sky were known. With him at the ship’s helm, we came there with the prince and Morgen welcomed us with the honour that was fitting,\n\nIlluc post bellum Camblani uulnere lesum930\n\nduximus Arturum nos conducente Barintho,\n\nequora cui fuerant, et celi sidera nota.\n\nHoc rectore ratis cum principe uenimus illuc,\n\net nos quo decuit Morgen suscepit honore\n\nand laid the king down in her b"
