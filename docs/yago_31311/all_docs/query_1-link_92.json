        "text": "V\n\nVaa, Aslaug â (1889 â 1967)\n\nNorwegian lyric poet and dramatist\n\nAslaug Vaa was born at Rauland, the daughter of a farmer. She was well educated and studied philosophy and psychoanalysis before her marriage (1911 â 1938) with the noted philologist Ola Raknes, to whom she bore five children, and from whom she was later divorced after a marriage of thirty years. A champion of modernist verse before modernism became popular in Norway, she was the author of the collection of poems entitled Nord i leite (In the North Horizon) (1934) and the dramatic work Steinguden (God of Stone) (1934). Aslaug Vaa produced a total of seven collections of poetry, and wrote well over a hundred and fifty articles and essays on a variety of subjects.\n\nVaca, Brianda de â (fl. c1455 â 1461)\n\nSpanish concubine\n\nBrianda de Vaca became the mistress of the Infante Carlos of Aragon, Prince of Viana (1421 â 1461), the eldest son of Juan II, King of Aragon (1458 â 1479). Brianda bore him a son Felip de Navarra (1456 â 1488), who was recognized by his father and later created Archbishop of Palermo in Sicily. He was later killed in battle against the Moors of Granada.\n\nVacaresco, Zoe Palaeologina â (1762 â 1867)\n\nGreek aristocrat\n\nPrincess Zoe Palaeologina was the daughter of Prince Rodokan Palaeologus (1735 â 1780) and his wife Helena Juliani. She was a descendant of Thomas Palaeologus, Despot of the Morea, and of the former emperors of Byzantium. Zoe was married (1794) to Barbo Vacaresco, Grand Duke of Krakow in Poland. Their daughter, Elisa Vacaresco-Palaeologina (1796 â 1827) became the wife of her coucin, Prince Matthew Palaeologus (1793 â 1825). Through her daughter, Zoe was the great-great grandmother of Prince Paul Theodore Palaeologue-Crivez (1894 â 1984), Head of the Sovereign Imperial house of Constantinople (1945 â 1984) who died childless. Princess Zoe died aged one hundred and four years.\n\nVacarescu, Helene â (1866 â 1947)\n\nRomanian novelist\n\nHelene Vacarescu wrote verse and novels in French and with such acclaim that she was awarded the prize of the French Academy (1886). She was taken under the wing of the Romanian queen, Elisabeth of Wied, better known as âCarmen Sylva,â the wife of King Carol I, and became her favourite lady-in-waiting. The queen played at being match-maker, and was said to have encouraged the infatuation for Helene felt by the kingâs nephew and heir, Prince Ferdinand. When Ferdinand proposed to her (1891) this became a political issue, and public opinion comdemned the liasion. Helene accompanied the queen on a visit to Venice, where the fashionable novelist Pierre Loti wrote a book about them entitled LâExilee, which was banned in Romania. However, she resolved never to marry, and several decades later, her reputation was restored to such an extent that Madamoiselle Varescu was permitted to return to Romania (1925), and was elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. As a final tribute, she was appointed a Romanian delegate at the Paris Peace Conference (1946).\n\nVachnadze, Nato â (1904 â 1953)\n\nGeorgian actress and famous film star\n\nBorn Natalya Georgiyevna Andronikashvili (April 3, 1904) in Warsaw, Poland, she came from an ancient patrician Greek family. She was hired by the Russian Studio Sakhinmretsvi and made her first film appearance as Neno in, Arsena Kachagi (1923). Nato quickly achieved film star status equal to that enjoyed by popular film sirens in the west. Other films credits included Tariel mklavadzis mklvlelobis saqme (The Hero of Our Time) (1925), Krazna (Wisp) (1928), Ukanaskneli maskaradi (The Last Masquerade) (1934), Samshoblo (Motherland) (1939) and Is kidev dabrundeba (He Would Come Back (1943), amongst others. Her personal success was mirrored by the rise in importance of the movie studio. Vachnadze was married twice, firstly to the aristocrat Merab Vachnadze, and secondly to the movie director Nikoloz Shengelaya. She was mother to the noted architect, Tengis Vachnadze and to the film director Eldar Shengelaya. Her last film appearance was as Elisabed Lomidze in Mtsvervalta dampkrobni (1952). Nato Vachnadze was tragically killed (June 14, 1953) in a plane crash, aged forty-nine.\n\nVadamerca â (fl. c370 â c400 AD)\n\nQueen of the Huns\n\nVadamerca was the granddaughter of Vinitharius, King of the Ostrogoths, being probably the daughter of his son Vandalarius. She was married to the Hunnish king Balamber who led an attack against the Ostrogoths (c370 AD) after her grandfatherâs death, probably to secure an alliance, and the marriage was recorded by Jordanes in his chronicle Getica.\n\nVaganova, Agrippina Yakovlevna â (1879 â 1951)\n\nRussian ballerina, choreographer and teacher\n\nVaganova was born (July 6, 1879) and attended the Imperial Theatre School (1888) where she was trained under Eugenia Sokolova, Enrico Cecchetti and Marius Petipa. She appeared in the title role of Petipaâs ballet La Esmeralda (1899). Agrippina performed as a ballerina at the Marinskii Theatre and became the prima ballerina (1916). With her retirement (1917) she then became a teacher at the School of Russian Ballet (1919 â 1921) and at the Leningrad Choreographic School (1921 â 1951). Madame Vaganova was appointed as the director of the former Imperial Ballet School (1934) which later became the Vaganova Ballet Academy. Her pupils included Natalia Dudinskaya, Galina Ulanova and Olga Lepeshinskaya. She was the author of the teaching manual Basic Principles of Classical Ballet (1948). Agrippina Vaganova died (Nov 5, 1951) aged seventy-two.\n\nVagts, Miriam Beard â (1901 â 1983)\n\nBritish historian and author\n\nMiriam Beard was born (Nov 19, 1901) in Manchester, Lancashire, the daughter of the noted historians Charles A. Beard, and his wife Mary Ritter Beard. Mrs Vagts wrote articles to various publications over her long career including the New York Times.

Miriam Vagts died (Sept 3, 1983) aged eighty-one, at Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nVaile, Bobbie Anne â (1959 â 1996)\n\nAustralian astrophysicist and educator\n\nRoberta Anne Vaile was born (June 25, 1959) in Junee, New South Wales. She attended secondary school in Wagga Wagga and Newcastle before obtaining a science degree from the University of Newcastle. Bobbie Vaile was later made an honorary fellow of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) Australia Telescope National Facility, where she was involved in research concerning astronomical masers which used radio waves to predict where new planets were forming in the universe. Vaile also worked with Project Phoenix which was established at Parkes (1995) as part of the SETI (Search for Extaterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in California, and was a member of the SETI Committee of the International Academy of Astronautics. She was the recipient of the Unsung Hero Award (1995) from the Australian Scientific Communicators. Her published works included Physics: A First Year University Study Guide which she co-wrote with Chris Turman. Bobbie Vaile died (Nov 13, 1996) aged thirty-seven of a brain tumour, at Elderslie in NSW.\n\nVala â (fl. c400 AD)\n\nCeltic queen\n\nVala (Gwawl) was the daughter of the British queen Caelius Votepacus (Coel Hen, the Old King Coel of the nursery rhyme). Vala was married to King Cunedda (c370 â c440 AD) and was mother of the Welsh prince Einion Yrth (the Impetuous) of Gwynedd (c400 â c435 AD), through whom she was the direct ancestress of the Tudor Dynasty of England (1485 â 1603) and of the present British royal family of Windsor. Vala and Cuneddaâs children founded the leading Welsh royal family. Wales became divided into separate kingdoms, the three most important being Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth, of which Gwynedd proved the most long lasting. Welsh tradition also provides Vala with a daughter Gwen, the wife of Amlawdd, King of Rheged, whose daughter Ygerna (Igraine) wife of Uthyr Pendragon was the mother of King Arthur (c465 AD â c527).\n\nVala, Katri â (1901 â 1944)Â\n\nFinnish poet\n\nBorn Karen Alice Wadenstrom, she was a truly tragic figure in the Finnish literary tradition. She was born into and was raised in poverty. Katri later trained as a schoolteacher and was married, becoming Madame Karin Heikel and produced several children. Valaâs work was often compared with that of Edith Sodergran, and like her, Vala died young of tuberculosis in Sweden. Vala was one of the leading poets of the modernist Tulenkantajat (âTorchbearersâ) Group, and her book of verse entitled Collected Poems (1945) was published posthumously.\n\nValadon, Suzanne (Marie Clementine) â (1865 â 1938)\n\nFrench painter\n\nMarie Clementine Valadon was born near Limoges, in the Limousin region. Known as 'Suzanne' she became the mother of the famous painter Maurice Utrillo (1883 â 1955). Valadon had originally been employed as a circus acrobat, but an accident put an end to this rather dangerous career, and instead, she obtained work as a model for several painters including Auguste Renoir (1841 â 1919). With encouragement from established artists such as Edgar Degas (1834 â 1917) and Paul Cezanne (1839 â 1906), amongst others, Suzanne Valadon took up painting herself, and became noted for her realistic style, producing nudes, portraits, and landscapes. Her best known works were Family Portrait (1912) and The Blue Room (1923).\n\nValcin, Cleanthe â (1891 â 1956)\n\nCaribbean poet, novelist, editor and literary critic\n\nBorn Cleanthe Desgraves (Jan 13, 1891) at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, she was educated there, and became the wife of Virgile Valcin. Madame Valcin became editor of the feminist journal La Semeuse, whilst he rpublished works included the collection of verse Fleurs et pleurs (1924) and the novels Cruelle destinee (1929) and La blanche negresse (1934). Cleanthe Valcin died (Jan 27, 1956) aged sixty-five, in Port-au-Prince.\n\nValdes Mendoza, Mercedes â (1820 â 1896)\n\nCuban minor poet\n\nMercedes Valdes Mendoza was particularly remembered for two collections of verse entitled Cantos perdidos (1847) and Poesias (1854). Her poems âLa esperanzaâ and âLa rosaâ were included in many popular poetic anthologies.\n\nValdrada of Sicily â (c1189 â after 1213)\n\nNorman princess\n\nValdrada was the fourth and youngest daughter of Tancred of Leece, King of Sicily (1189 â 1194), and his wife Sybilla di Medania, the daughter of Ruggiero di Medania, Count of Acerra. She was sister to the child kings, Roger III (1194) and William III (Guglielmo) (1194 â 1197). Princess Valdrada was confined with her mother and sisters in the convent of Hohenburg in Alsace, Germany, at the command of the emperor Henry VI, after the deposition of her brother William. They were later released after the intercession of Pope Innocent III, and Valdrada returned to Italy. She was eventually married to Giacomo Tello, a Venetian patrician. It is possible, though unlikely, that Valdrada was the unnamed daughter of King Tancred who was betrothed in infancy (1190) to Duke Arthur I of Brittany, the grandson of Henry II of England. This princess was more likely to have been her elder sister Constance.\n\nVale, May â (1862 â 1945)\n\nAustralian artist, enamellist and painter\n\nMay Vale as born in Ballarat, Victoria, and studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. She later travelled to London where she had further instruction from Sir James Linton. After her subsequent return to Australia she was married to Alexander Gilfillan. Her work was exhibited with the Victorian Artistsâ Society and the Melbourne Society of Women Painter and Sculptors, and examples are preserved at the National Gallery of Victoria.\n\nValentia, Lucy Lyttelton, Lady â (1743 â 1783)Â\n\nBritish heiress and socialite\n\nLucy Lyttelton was the only daughter and eventual heiress of Sir George, first Baron Lyttelton (1709 â 1773) and his wife Lucy, the daughter of Hugh Fortescue of Filleigh, Devon. Lucy became the first wife (1767) of Arthur Annesley (1744 â 1816), Viscount Valentia (later first Earl of Mountnorris), to whom she bore six children including Sir George Annesley (1771 â 1844) who succeeded his father as second Earl of Mountnorris (1816 â 1844) but left no surviving issue. Her elder daughter Juliana Lucy Annesley (1768 â 1833) became the wife of the fifth Baron Farnham, and left issue. Lucy Valentia was a prominent figure in Hanoverian society and paid visits to France and was received at the court of Versailles. She was mentioned in the correspondence of the noted British antiquarian, Sir Horace Walpole. Lady Valentia eventually became the heiress general (1779) of her brother Thomas, second Lord Lyttelton after he died without issue, but the baronetcy reverted to their uncle, Lord William Lyttelton of Westcote. She was represented (1967) by her great-grandson Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Arthur, Lord Lyttelton-Annesley, KCVO. Lady Valentia died (May 20, 1783).\n\nValenti i Petit, Helena â (1940 â 1990)\n\nSpanish novelist and poet\n\nHelena Valenti i Petit was born in Barcelona, Aragon, into a wealthy middle-class family. She studied romantic languages at the University of Barcelona and later travelled to England, where she continued her studies at Cambridge University. Valenti was then employed as a Catalan lecturer at the universities of Cambridge and Durham and translated the works of such authors as Doris Lessing, Katherine Mansfield, and Virginia Woolf into the Catalan language. She later returned to Spain (1974) and died in Barcelona. Her published works included the feminist themed semi-autobiographical novels Lâamor adult (Adult love) (1977), La solitud dâAnna (The solitude of Anna) (1981) and Dâesquena al mar (With backs to the sea) (1991).\n\nValentina ViscontiÂ Â Â see alsoÂ Â Orleans, Valentina Visconti, Duchesse dâ\n\nValentina Visconti â (1367 â 1393)\n\nQueen consort of Cyprus (1378 â 1382)\n\nValentina Visconti was born (Aug 12, 1367) in Milan, Lombardy, the daughter of Bernarbo Visconti, Count of Milan and his wife Beatrice della Scala. She was betrothed (1376) to Peter (1358 â 1382), who succeeded his father as Peter II of Cyprus. Valentina was magnificently entertained at Modena, Ferrara, and Venice, before arriving at Kyrenia in Cyprus where they were married (1378).\n\nTheir only child, a daughter, died in infancy, but the queen became involved in domestic disputes with her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aragon, which resulted in the queen motherâs removal from court (1380). With her husbandâs death (Oct 3, 1382) Queen Valentina returned to the court in Milan, where she remained as queen dowager till her death (before Sept, 1393). Her nephew, Filippo Maria Visconti continued demands for many years for the repayment of her large dowry, but met with no success.\n\nValentine, Ann â (1762 â 1842)\n\nBritish organist, music-seller and keyboard composer\n\nAnn Valentine was baptised (March 15, 1762) at Leicester, the daughter of musician John Valentine. Miss Valentine was the organist for many years at the church of St Margaret at Westminster in London, and finally retired in 1834. She composed many pieces including sonatas for the piano and harpsichord, and published Monny Music (1798) for the keyboard. Ann Valentine died (Oct 13, 1842) aged eighty, at Leicester.\n\nValentinois, Duchesse deÂ Â Â see Â Â Â Poitiers, Diane de\n\nValentinois, Marie Christine Chretienne de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon, Comtesse de â (1728 â 1774)\n\nFrench Bourbon courtier\n\nMarie Christine de Rouvroy was born (May 7, 1728), the daughter of Jacques Louis de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon (1698 â 1746), Marquis and Duc de Ruffec, and his wife Catherine Charlotte Therese de Gramont, the daughter of Antoine V de Gramont, Duc de Gramont and de Guiche, and Marshal of France (1672 â 1725), and the widow of Philippe Alexandre, Prince de Bournonville (1699 â 1727). She was thus the paternal granddaughter of Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon, the famous chronicler of the court of Versailles under Louis XIV, and his wife Marie Gabrielle de Durfort. Marie Christine was married (1749) to Charles Maurice de Goyon de Matignon de Grimaldi (1727 â 1798), Comte de Valentinois (1747 â 1798) and grandee of Spain, a younger son of Jacques I Grimaldi, Prince de Monaco. Madame de Valentinois was a prominent courtier of Louis XV at Versailles, and also attended the court of the Dauphin Louis Auguste and the Dauphine Marie Antoinette. She attended the famous salons of Madame Du Deffand and the Marquise de Forcalquier, and was a particular friend to the Vicomtesse de Cambis, mistress to the infamous Duc de Lauzun. She had her residence at Passy, near Paris, and served at court as a lady-in-waiting (dame du palais) to Josephine of Savoy, Comtesse de Provence, the sister-in-law of Louis XVI (1774 â 1792). She is mentioned in the correspondence of the noted British antiquarian Horace Walpole. Madame de Valentinois died (July 15, 1774), aged forty-six.\n\nValentinois, Philippa de Fay, Comtesse deÂ Â seeÂ Â Fay, Philippa de\n\nValera, Sinead de â (1879 â 1975)\n\nIrish First Lady (1959 â 1973)\n\nBorn Sinead Flanagan in Balbriggan, County Dublin, she was trained as a teacher at Leinster College, where she first met her future husband, Eamon de Valera, then a mathematics teacher. They were married (1910) and Sinead bore him seven children. Sinead de Valera played no part in public life, and after the abortive 1916 uprising, whilst her husband was in prison or forced to remain overseas, she devoted herself to the upbringing and education of their children. A supporter of the Gaelic League, she produced over one dozen plays for children, the first of which was Buaidhirt agus Brod (1934). She also published several collections of stories such as Fairy Tales of Ireland (1967) and More Irish Fairy Tales (1979). Sinead de Valera died (Jan 7, 1975) aged ninety-five, in Dublin.\n\nValeria, Galeria â (c273 â 316 AD)\n\nRoman Augusta (305 â 311 AD)\n\nGaleria Valeria was the only child of the emperor Diocletian and his wife Prisca. She was married (293 AD) to Galerius (c265 â 311 AD) when he was appointed as Caesar in the East in order to strengthen the new Tetrarchy. With her husbandâs accession she was accorded the Imperial title and styles (305 AD) and part of Lower Pannonia was named a new province in her honour. Their marriage remained childless, though the children of Galerius and a mistress, Maxentius, Candidianus, and Maximilla, were raised in Valeriaâs household. Empress Valeria and her mother were amongst the first to sacrifice to the pagan gods when Diocletian began his series of persecutions against Christianity, despite several old traditions, notably by Lactantius, which attempted to make the two women lapsed Christians. When Galerius issued edicts forcing people to conform under threat of banishment, the two Imperial ladies again performed the required rituals. Christian records make no mention of Valeria or Prisca, nor were they honoured posthumously. This tradition of Lactantius is spurious.\n\nWhen Galerius lay dying, he commended Valeria to the care of the emperor Licinius. However, she incurred his displeasure by fleeing to the protection of Maximian Daia instead. When Daia wanted to marry her, Valeria refused and fled his court in Nikomedia, together with her mother, and Valeria Maximilla, the widow of Maxentius, and several others. The group went in exile in Syria, and requests by the aged Diocletian for their safe return went unheeded. Eventually the party was recognized in Thessalonika. They were all publicly beheaded by order of the Emperor Licinius, their bodies all being thrown into the sea. Valeria is attested as empress by surviving coinage such as the gold aureus (c308 AD), which portrays a bust of the empress behind a crescent on the obverse, with the inscription GAL VALERIA AVG. The reverse side shows the goddess Venus behind Valeria, an apple in her right hand, and, catching up her mantle in her left, below the inscription VENERI VICTRICI.\n\nValeria MaximillaÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Maximilla, Valeria\n\nValeria Messalla â (fl. c100 â 78 BC)\n\nRoman Republican patrician\n\nValeria Messalla the daughter of Marcus Valerius Messalla Niger and his wife Hortensia, the sister of Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, consul (69 BC). Valeria was sister to Marcus Valerius Messalla Rufus, consul (53 BC). The historian Plutarch referred to her as âa very beautiful woman of a most distinguished family.â Valeria had recently been divorced from her first husband (whose identity remains unknown) when she attracted the attention at the public games of the dictator, Lucius Cornelius Sulla (138 â 78 BC), whose fifth and last wife she became (79 BC). Plutarch recorded that âhowever chaste and worthy a character she may have been, Sullaâs motive in marrying her was neither chaste nor virtuous ; he was carried away, like a boy might have been, by a good-looking face and a saucy manner --- just what naturally excites the most disgraceful and shamesless sort of passion.â Sulla died after only a few months of marriage and Valeria bore him a daughter, Postuma Cornelia Sulla. The fate of mother and daughter remains unknown.\n\nValeria Messalla Corvina â (fl. 10 BC â c14 AD)\n\nRoman Imperial patrician\n\nValeria Messalla Corvina was the daughter of Marcus Messalla Corvinus and his wife Calpurnia. She became the wife of Titus Statilius Taurus, consul (11 AD), to whom she bore three children, Titus Statilius Corvinus, consul (45 AD), Statilius Taurus, consul (44 AD), and Statilia Messallina, the wife of Lucius Valerius Catullus. Valeria Corvina was a courtier of the Emperor Augustus and his wife Livia Drusilla, and was the maternal grandmother of the Augusta Statilia Messallina (66 â 68 AD), third and last wife of the emperor Nero (54 â 68 AD).\n\nValeria MessallinaÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Messallina, Valeria\n\nValeriana â (fl. 513 â 518)\n\nByzantine nun\n\nValeriana held the position of deaconess and then abbess in Constantinople. She received a letter from St Severus of Antioch, which congratulated her upon being elected to abbatical office and proferred spiritual and moral advice for herself and the nuns living under her rule.\n\nValeria Poplicola â (fl. c500 â c488 BC)\n\nRoman Republican patrician\n\nValeria Poplicola was the sister of Publius Valerius Poplicola, who twice served as consul (508 and 504 BC). It was Valeria who advised the noble matrons to ask Veturia, the mother of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, to go to her sonâs military camp, in order to deprecate his anger against the city of Rome. The historian Plutarch recorded that ââ¦ Valeria lived still, and enjoyed great respect and honour at Rome, her life and conduct no way disparaging her birth.â\n\nValerie, Olive â (1893 â 1951)\n\nAmerican minor film actress\n\nOlive Valerie appeared in two silent movies Fantee (1920) and Red Hot Romance (1922) as Madame Puloff de Plotz. She retired before the advent of sound. Olive Valerie died (Oct 27, 1951) in New York.\n\nValette, Aline â (1850 â 1899)\n\nFrench socialist\n\nAline Valette was born in Paris and was trained as a schoolteacher. With the early death of her husband she worked as a journalist and published the volume dedicated to domestic household management La journee de la petite menagere (1883). Together with Eugenie Potonie-Pierre she was a founding member of the Federation Francaise des Societes Feministes (1892), and a member of the National Council of the Parti Ouvrier Francais (1893). Aline Valette died at Arcachon.\n\nValette, PierreÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Vieu, Jane\n\nValivon, Comtesse deÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â La Vigne, Julie de\n\nValla, Trebisonda â (1916 â 2006)\n\nItalian athlete\n\nTrebisonda (Ondina) Valla was born (May 20, 1916) in Bologna. As a girl she competed in sports with Claudia Testoni, who would become her rival in later years. Valla became the national champion hurdle jumper at the age of thirteen (1930), and joined the national team. She also excelled in the longjump and the sprint race. She won the 80 metre hurdle race in the Berlin Olympics (1936), defeating her rival Testoni, and received a gold medal, the first female Italian athlete ever to do so. Trebisonda Valla died (Oct 16, 2006) aged ninety.\n\nVallach â (c870 â 934)\n\nIrish poet\n\nSurnamed âthe Arrogantâ Vallach was the daughter of an Irish chieftain named Muimhechan. She was renowned for her poetic gifts, and was publicly honoured as an outstanding poet.\n\nValladares Nunez, Avelina â (1825 â 1902)\n\nSpanish poet\n\nAvelina Valladares was born in Vilancosta, in Pontevedra, of humble parentage. She never married and much of her work remained unpublished. Avelina was the author of Mi aldea (My town), and A ulla, A Galicia os que emigran (Galician Emigration). She was awarded the literary Cruz de Benefiicencia de Segunda Clase (1894). She also wrote the Dialogo entre un peregrino que se dirige a Compostela y un labriego which consisted of a conversation between a farm labourer and a pilgrim travelling to the shrine of St Iago de Compostela.\n\nVallayer-Coster, Anne â (1744 â 1818)\n\nFrench still-life and flower painter\n\nAnne Vallayer-Coster was the daughter of a goldsmith who then worked as tapestry weaver. She later came to Paris with her family (1754) and began to establish a name for herself as a popular artist. Her works Allegory of the Visual Arts and Allegory of Music (1770) gained her acceptance as a member of the Academie Royale. She was married (1781) to fellow painter Jean Pierre Coster and was later granted apartments in the Louvre Palace by Queen Marie Antoinette. Well over four hundred of her works survive.\n\nValle, Magdalena de Guzman, Marquesa del â (c1570 â 1621)\n\nSpanish courtier\n\nMagdalena de Guzman was originally the protÃ©gÃ© of the Duke de Lerma, who engineered her appointment as lady-in-waiting to Margaret of Austria, the wife of King Philip III. Later she was appointed governess to the Infanta Anna (Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV), and also assumed the full responsibilities of running the queenâs household during the illness of her superior, the Duchess di Gandia. Until 1603 she maintained herself as a spy for Lerma, but slowly the marquesa began to develop her own network of contacts throughout the court. As the affection between the queen and the marquesa developed, she was gave official audiences to petitioners. Instead of reporting to Lerma, the marquesa switched allegiance, and she and Queen Margaret petitioned the king personally for requests.\n\nWhen the Marquis of Montesclaros was granted his requested appointment to Mexico, he wrote to the marquesa, thanking her and the queen for bring this about.
