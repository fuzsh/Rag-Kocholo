Marriage

In Valencia on 29 June 1407, Isabella married James II of Urgell, soon after the marriage, James was appointed lieutenant of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1408.

The county of Urgell was dissolved in 1413, following her husband's revolt against the new King Ferdinand I of Aragon who had been chosen to succeed to the throne of Aragon in 1412 despite James having had the stronger claim as the closest legitimate agnate to the Royal House of Barcelona. Earlier, King Ferdinand had offered James 150,000 florins, the title of Duke of Montblanc, and proposed an alliance between his son Henry and their eldest daughter, Isabella, but James had refused Ferdinand's offer on the advice of his mother. In addition to the loss of his title and assets, James was later tried, condemned, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The couple had five children:

Isabella of Urgell, Duchess of Coimbra (12 March 1409 – 29 August 1443). Married Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra and was mother of Isabella, Queen of Portugal
