        "text": "No new nominations will be accepted.\n\nEstablished 1962\n\nThe Robert A Millikan Medal recognizes those who have made notable and intellectually creative contributions to the teaching of physics. The recipient delivers an address at an AAPT Summer Meeting and receives a monetary award, the Millikan Medal, an Award Certificate, and travel expenses to the meeting. Self-nomination is not appropriate for this award. Preference in the selection of the recipient will be given to members of AAPT.\n\nThis award has been renamed.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, the AAPT Board of Directors voted unanimously to remove Robert A. Millikan’s name from the award that recognizes “those who have made notable and intellectually creative contributions to the teaching of physics.” This decision follows the recent decision by Cal Tech to remove Millikan’s name from buildings based on his participation in the eugenics movement through affiliation with the Human Betterment Foundation, an organization which supported eugenic sterilization research.\n\nThe Board of Directors have unanimously approved renaming the award to the Lillian McDermott Medal with the citation “Lillian McDermott Medal recognizes those who are passionate and tenacious about improving the teaching and learning of physics and have made intellectually creative contributions in this area”.\n\nAward Winners\n\n2021\n\nGregory E.
