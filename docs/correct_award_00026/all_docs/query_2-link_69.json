One of the three winners of the 2022 prize, John Clauser, is from the United States. Clauser was given the prize jointly with Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger \"for [their] experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.\""
