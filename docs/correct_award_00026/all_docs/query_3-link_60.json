He spent a number of years teaching and conducting research at the University of Chicago, where he had also studied as a graduate student.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1915, and served as president of the American Physical Society.\n\nMillikan was appointed director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in 1921.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Prize two years later, and presented a lecture on \"The electron and the light-quant from the experimental point of view.\"\n\nMillikan's later work included groundbreaking studies of the ultraviolet spectrum and cosmic radiation.\n\nThe 37Â¢ blue definitive stamp honoring Millikan (Scott 1866) was issued Jan. 26, 1982, at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif."
