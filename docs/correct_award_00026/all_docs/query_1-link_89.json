        "text": "\"Recent Microsoft Outrage: Where do we stand?\" Microsoft outrage has shown that we are not a big force in the field of computer engineering and how much we have to depend on others. We just work for the American companies! There are thousands of indian technocrats working for the giants in the field of IT sector. The big question is, \"Can we not develop our own systems equivalent or better than operating system of Microsoft?\" If we look at social media platforms (Facebook, X, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on), all are ....!! And have we ever thought how much revenue is being drained out of our country?\n\n\"Causes of Failure of Civil Structures - Part (2)\" It is basic understanding about the civil structures (stone, brick, RCC structures and steel structures) that a poorly designed structure fails during or immediately after the completion. At this stage, the failure may also be due to poor quality of material used, poor workmanship including the weld quality, etc. Stone, brick and RCC structures having some short of design and construction flaws are likely to fail in the rainy season. Such structures, if not properly maintained, may also fail during the rainy season. The reasons may be: leaking water through the roof and cracks which may get entery (penetrate) into the walls, settling of the foundation due to poor consolidation during construction that allows entry of water into the foundation, accumulation of water on the roof, etc. The steel structures may fail due to exceptionally heavy loads (such as accumulation of water on the roof top, heavy stationary or moving loads), high loads due to exceptionally high speed winds, uneven settling of the foundation, weakening of the steel sections due to excessive corrosion, etc. Just like part(1) of the post, I have put some points from the basic knowledge and hope that, unlike the Part(1), this part will attract the attention of the experts and their enlightening comments will enrich the knowledge of all learned members of LinkedIn who are from different fields of science, engineering, management, etc.\n\n\"Causes of Failure of Civil Structures - Part (1)\" The engineering knowledge has significantly enhanced than it was in last 500 years and powerful computational tools are available. Better materials and fabrication technologies are also available. Thousands of skilled dedicated engineers and technocrats for this job are available whose salaries and consultancy fees are hundred of times better than the construction people of olden times. Despite these all, the structures made a few months or years back fall to the ground like a pack of cards. The cost of such failure to the nation is tremendous and impact on the perception of the people is heart breaking. Doesn't it require serious thought? Please open the secret or put the facts before the public to establish their faith in science and technology and restart! The above has special significance and importance in the light of recent mishaps at Delhi, Rajkot and Jabalpur airports, and collapse of multiple bridges in Bihar. Scientists and engineers can learn a lot from the objective analysis of the failures. I expect comments from the experts in the field of civil and structural engineerings, which will be of great value for all fellow engineers and students. #structure_failure #expert_opinion\n\n* The Best Sources of Entertainment and Enjoyment * • Reading good literature related to history, society, economics, religion, etc. with objectivity • Listening good stories or music • Writing stories, poems, your experiences, to your friends, good posts • Learning something new • Drawing sketches, painting, etc. • Singing or playing any musical instrument • Laughing and even weeping • Playing with kids, birds, pets and animals or studying their behaviour • Talking to your relatives and friends • Gardening • Fixing the broken window glass, painting doors or walls • Doing small repair works relating to mason, plumber, carpenter, electrician • Cooking, washing dishes or clothes, ironing • Stitching • Planning or creating anything new • Walking or running at the pace you enjoy • Doing light to heavy exercise • Playing indoor or outdoor games • Vising gardens • Helping others • Doing some social work or related studies In the nutshell, \"Enjoyment is embedded in doing something different from your routine work. Be humble and enjoy what you do.” Choose or follow any celebrity with utmost care and objective thinking as far as entertainment is concerned; remember that you are not less than any celebrity. In general, you don't need their performances or stories for any form of enjoyment in your life. Note that none of the suggested hobbies in this post requires any expenditure!!\n\n# Corporate Educational Responsibility (CER) Similar to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), there must be Corporate Educational Responsibility (CER) to disseminate information and knowledge to the higher education institutions. For example, in the field of engineering and technology, there are many claims of development of new technologies but the teachers and students are being deprived of that. There may be many reasons for this situation and it us essential to tackle this problem at war footing otherwise, after only a few years, the industry will feel a dire need of competent engineering graduates. It is to note that the engineering institutions can never produce industry ready engineers, especially in the field of mechanical engineering. The students need proper training and in-depth exposure to the developments in the industries."
