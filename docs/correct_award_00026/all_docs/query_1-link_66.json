        "meta_description": "The Robert A. Millikan House in Chicago (1907). Robert Andrews Millikan was born in Iowa and was the first person to earn a Ph.D. from the physics department at Columbia University. He was hired as a professor by the University of Chicago, where he performed his most famous experiment. He set up two parallel metal plates with a potential difference (i.e. there was a uniform electric field between them). Above the plates, oil was sprayed into a vacuum chamber. Due to friction with the nozzle, some of these oil droplets would become electrically charged. The droplets could enter the space between the plates through small holes, and could be made to rise or fall based on the charge between the plates. In other words, Millikan balanced gravitational forces acting on the droplets with the electric forces provided by the plates. The density and mass of the oil was known, so Millikan was able to derive the charge of the electrons in the oil. Over several experiments, he determined that electrons had a charge of 1.5924 x 10^-19 coulomb, which is within 1% of today's accepted electron charge of 1.6022 x 10^-19. In 1923, Millikan was presented with the Nobel Prize for Physics for this discovery.",
