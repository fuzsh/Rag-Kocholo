        "text": "Millikan did not directly contribute to the model of atom but did help future scientist change the atomic model. Due to the long lasting evaporation time of oil Millikan could get better results. Water evaporated too quickly to get good results, (evaporated in seconds). Millikan contributed to finding the charge of the electron He did this by using the famous “Oil Drop Experiment” in 1909 He created a more efficient process in comparison to the process made by H.A. Dezember 1953 in San Marino bei Pasadena, Kalifornien) war ein US-amerikanischer Physiker. One hundred years ago, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Robert Millikan for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect.\n\nHe proved that the electron was fundamental particle with a fundamental charge.Ĥ How Did His Experiment Change the Atomic Model Robert Andrews Millikan ( 22.März 1868 in Morrison, Illinois 19. 2.9 Electric Field Lines: Multiple Charges.\n\n2.8 Electric Field: Concept of a Field Revisited. 2.5 Static Electricity and Charge: Conservation of Charge. 2.4 The Wave Nature of Matter Causes Quantization. The concept that matter is composed of discrete particles is an ancient idea, but gained scientific credence in the 18th and 19th centuries when scientists found it could explain the behaviors of gases and how chemical elements reacted with each other. So Millikan’s paper is not at all, as we would now expect, an experimental proof of the quantum theory of light. 2.3 Bohr’s Theory of the Hydrogen Atom - Atomic Spectral Lines. By balancing charged oil droplets between an electric field and gravity. Atomic theory is the scientific theory that matter is composed of particles called atoms. His main contribution to the atomic theory was deducing the electric charge of an electron. In 1909 he observed that the charge on any drop was an integral multiple of fundamental value. His discoveries in science mostly related to electricity and physics. Millikan was a physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1923 for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and the photoelectric effect. Millikan found that the rapid evaporation of the water droplets made measurement difficult and the results erratic. this device allows the oil drops to fall between two plates with an electric field under it to test the charge of the electrons. Mass of electron 1.602×1019C× 1kg 1.759×1011C 9.107×1031kg Mass of electron 1.602 × 10 19 C × 1 kg 1.759 × 10 11 C 9.107 × 10 31 kg. He determined the electron's charge by measuring the movement of small electrically charged drops of oil in a gravitational field. 1 When the oil drop is in the electric field, there is an electric force, F, acting upwards. Millikan was a physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1923 for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and the photoelectric effect. That is, the single unit of charge which could be multiplied up to give the charge he measured on all his oil drops. He selected 58 of his results and found the highest common factor. Millikan used his experimental design to test the charge of the electrons that were in the oil droplets that he evaporated this method was called oil-drop. Millikan repeated the experiment for over 150 oil drops. \\): Millikan’s experiment measured the charge of individual oil drops.Presentation on theme: \"Robert Millikan: How He Changed the Atom\"- Presentation transcript:ġ Robert Millikan: How He Changed the Atomĭone by: Maxwell Murray, Calix Waldrop, Elijah Jennings, and Emily Maul"
