        "text": "Robert Andrews Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1923, in large part for his pioneering measurement of the charge of the electron. He was a founder, first leader and all-around patron saint of the California Institute of Technology. In the first half of the 20th century, he was one of the most famous scientists in America. Yet he has been accused of male chauvinism, anti-Semitism, mistreating his graduate students and, worst of all, scientific fraud. Because Millikan, who died in 1953, remains something of a hero at my institution (Caltech), I felt a duty to investigate these allegations and, after doing so, became convinced that they are unreasonably harsh. To appreciate how I reached this conclusion requires, first, a broad understanding of the man's life and career.\n\nMillikan was born in 1868, the son of a Mid-- western minister. He attended Oberlin College, earned a Ph.D. in physics from Columbia University, did some postdoctoral work in Germany and, in the last years of the 19th century, took a position at the brand-new University of Chicago, in a physics department headed by his idol, A. A. Michelson.\n\nDuring the next decade, Millikan wrote some very successful textbooks, but he made little progress as a research scientist. This was a period of dramatic change in physics: Max Planck had kicked off the quantum revolution; Albert Einstein produced his theories of relativity and the photo-electric effect; and Jean Perrin's experiments and Einstein's theory on Brownian motion established forever that matter was made of atoms. Millikan made no contribution to these advances. Nearing 40 years of age, he became very anxious indeed to make his mark...."
