        "text": "Today is national Lollipop üç≠ Day (US) With the surplus of sugar in the 17th century, the English started the trend of preparing boiled sugar candy and, of course, they too inserted sticks into the treats. In Northern England, the word for ‚Äòtongue‚Äô is ‚Äòlolly‚Äô and pop means ‚Äòslap‚Äô ‚Äî so ‚Äòlolly pop‚Äô means ‚Äòtongue slap.‚Äô The term probably got popularized by street vendors in London. In 1905, the McAviney Candy Company was producing boiled hard candies, the mixture of which was stirred using a stick. By the end of the day, the owner would take home sticks covered with hardened candy for his children to enjoy. Later on, in 1908, he marketed these ‚Äòcandy sticks.‚Äô But it is George Smith, owner of the confectionery company Bradley Smith Company, who is credited for creating the modern lollipop that we all enjoy today. He started making them in 1908 and trademarked the word ‚Äòlollipop‚Äô in 1931. Lollipops were also referred to as ‚Äòdum dum suckers‚Äô to appeal to kids. The first automated production of lollipops also started in 1908 in Wisconsin, U.S.A. The Racine Confectioners Machinery Company built a machine that attached hard candy on the end of sticks at 2,400 sticks per hour. Russian immigrant Samuel Born also invented a machine that did the same thing, in 1916. His machine was called the ‚ÄòBorn Sucker Machine‚Äô and was so well-received that San Francisco awarded Born the ‚Äòkey to the city‚Äô that year. #nationaltoday #sciencecommunication #science #sugarcane #chemistry #chemical #foodscience #foodscienceandtechnology #lollipop #candy #confectionery #candyshop #science #infographic via Compound Interest | Chemistry infographics\n\nHere Miller et al describes a very practical use of charge determine mass spectrometry for the determination of linearly state of mega Dalton pasmide DNA üõéOverview: Plasmid DNA is a critical component of oligonucleotides based vaccines. Supercoiled plaside DNA is the preferred industry standard ( >90%) as it has the highest actitry. But plasmid DNA can exists in other from such as, relaxed (circular), linearized, and condensed. But with lower activity and not prefer by industry. Here Miller et al employed a CDMS assay to determine and plasmid DNA structures üéØSummary: Work with electrospray MS revealed two main structures supercoiled and condensed. Where as Miller et al observed that all all four structural types for plasmid DNA have unique charging #massspectrometry #massspec #vaccines #vaccineswork #science #scienceandtechnology #chemistry #pharmacy #biotherapeutics #biopharma #processmonitoring #dna\n\nToday is National Tattoo Day (US). Archaeological evidence shows that the ancient Egyptians practiced tattooing and the ‚ÄòIceman,‚Äô or √ñtzi, the natural mummy discovered in glacial ice in the Alps in 1991 and carbon-dated at 3250 B.C., bore 61 tattoos. Ancient tattooing was most widely practiced among the Austronesian-speaking peoples as far back as 1500 B.C. They practiced tattooing traditions including facial tattoos that some modern scientists allege were connected to headhunting among warring indigenous tribes. Fast forward to 17th-century Europe, ‚Äòpainted‚Äô individuals were sometimes abducted from their native countries and put on public display, the European abductors collecting money for each viewing. The explorer William Dampier took his tattooed slave Jeoly, known as the ‚ÄòPainted Prince,‚Äô on an extensive tour to show off and capitalize on Jeoly‚Äôs tattoos. The first tattoo shop to open in the U.S. belonged to Martin Hildebrandt, who started his business in New York City in 1846 and was sought after by Union and Confederate soldiers alike. By 1975, there were still only 40 tattoo artists operating in the U.S. But what is the chemistry ‚öóÔ∏è of Tattoo inks? #nationalday #tattoo #tattooartist #chemistry #artist #biochemistry #inks #scientists #sciencecommunication #scienceandtechnology #tattoos #infographic via Compound Interest | Chemistry infographics\n\nToday is National Hot Dog üå≠ Day German immigrants brought their own culinary traditions with them to the new world. It‚Äôs believed they brought to New York America‚Äôs first hot dogs, originally referred to as a dachshund sausage ‚Äî for their long shape that resembled the beloved dachshund pups. Around 1870, Charles Feltman, a German immigrant, began to sell hot dogs out of a stand on Coney Island. He sold over 3,600 frankfurters in a bun that year alone. Hot dogs became a household name in the late 19th century when casual food lover and baseball team owner of the St. Louis Browns ‚Äî better known to some as the Baltimore Orioles ‚Äî Chris Von de Ahe brought the two together at his own amusement park.

From the Roman Empire to the Chinese dynasties, the little red fruits have been on the plate of millions and came to America by ship with early settlers in the 1600s. Modern-day cherry production in the United States began in 1852 when Peter Dougherty began planting cherry trees on the Old Mission Peninsula in the state of Michigan. The maraschino cherry, created from sweet cherries, is what popularized cherries in the U.S. This popular dessert cherry was invented by merchants on the Balkan Peninsula and in northern Italy by adding liqueur to a local cherry called the Marasca. The resulting cherry product was shipped into the United States in the 1890s. In 1896, U.S. cherry processors began trialing an indigenous sweet cherry for maraschino cherries, in which less liqueur was used in the processing, and almond oil was added. In the end, the liqueur was eliminated completely. By 1920, the American variation of the maraschino cherry was so popular that it had substituted the nonnative variety in the United States #foodandbeverageindustry #cherries #foodscience #foodscienceandtechnology #chemistry #biochemistry #summer #fruits #fruitsandvegetables #infographic via Compound Interest | Chemistry infographics"
