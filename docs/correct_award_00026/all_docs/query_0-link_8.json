        "text": "In 1923, R.A. Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect. Recently, historical research had a focus on Millikan’s publication practice, as well as on the role of his assistant, Harvey Fletcher. Several studies have raised doubts on whether Millikan can actually be taken as a role model for scientific practice; however, what has not been discussed yet is the question of how the Nobel Committee came to their decision to award Millikan’s work. Based on archival material from the Nobel Committee, this paper discusses the nomination procedure, as well as the evaluation process of Millikan’s work."
