May for his work in the field of x-rays, December 20, 1930. Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 - December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist. In 1908, while a professor at the University of Chicago, he began experiments in which he measured the charge on a single electron. He and his graduate student Harvey Fletcher used the oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron (as well as the electron mass, and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known). Millikan took sole credit, in return for Fletcher claiming full authorship on a related result for his dissertation. Millikan went on to win the 1923 Nobel Prize for Physics, in part for this (...)",
