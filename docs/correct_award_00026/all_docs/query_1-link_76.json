        "text": "Thomson\n\nMillikan\n\nRutherford\n\nEinstein\n\nAnswer is Right!\n\nAnswer is Wrong!\n\nThe correct answer is: B. Millikan\n\nRobert Andrews Millikan was an American experimental physicist who won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the elementary charge and on the photoelectric effect. He is best known for his oil drop experiment, which was used to determine the charge of an electron.\n\nThomson discovered the electron in 1897, but he did not determine its mass. Rutherford discovered the nucleus of the atom in 1911, but he did not determine the mass of the electron. Einstein developed the theory of relativity, which was used to determine the mass of the electron, but he did not directly measure it.\n\nMillikan’s oil drop experiment was a very clever and ingenious experiment. He used a very fine spray of oil drops to create tiny charged droplets. He then measured the rate at which the drops fell in an electric field. By knowing the electric field and the rate of fall, he was able to calculate the charge of the electron.\n\nMillikan’s oil drop experiment was a very important experiment in the history of physics. It was the first experiment to directly measure the charge of an electron. This was a major breakthrough in our understanding of the atom."
