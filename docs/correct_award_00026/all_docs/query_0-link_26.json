        "text": "Robert A. Millikan High School is named after the educator and Nobel Prize winner who became the first person to earn a Ph.D. in physics at Columbia University.\n\nBorn on March 22, 1868, in Morrison, Ill., Millikan grew up in Iowa. After graduating from Oberlin College in 1891, he taught physics for two years, which made him more interested in the subject. Accordingly in 1893 he earned a master’s in the field, according to the Nobel Prize website. Two years later, Millikan would earn a doctorate in physics from Columbia.\n\nMillikan married Greta Erwin Blanchard in 1902, fathering three sons during the marriage. He continued to excel in his career in the first decade of his marriage.\n\nIn 1910, Millikan became a physics professor at the University of Chicago. There, he wrote several books about physics, including textbooks he hoped would make it easier to teach the subject.\n\nMillikan has received credit for a number of scientific discoveries involving electricity, optics and molecular physics, the Nobel Prize website states: “His earliest major success was the accurate determination of the charge carried by an electron, using the elegant ‘falling-drop method;’ he also proved that this quantity was a constant for all electrons (1910), thus demonstrating the atomic structure of electricity,” according to the website.\n\nHe also verified experimentally Einstein’s all-important photoelectric equation. In 1923, Millikan won the Nobel Prize for his research on the photoelectric effect and the charge of the electron.\n\nThe son of a minister, Millikan authored a number of books specifically about the link between science, religion and philosophy. These works include “Science and Life,” “Evolution in Science and Religion,” “Science and the New Civilization” and “Time, Matter, and Values.”\n\nAs vice chairman of the National Research Council during World War I, Millikan created anti-submarine and meteorological devices, according to the Nobel Prize site. In 1921, he was named director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He remained in the role until his retirement in 1946.\n\nDuring his time in Pasadena, Millikan participated in the Human Betterment Foundation, which supported eugenics, or the belief that humanity would improve if only people with desirable genetic traits reproduced. Eugenicists did not consider people with mental health issues, racial minorities and immigrants of Eastern and Southern European origin as desirable. Noting Millikan’s involvement in the eugenics movement, the Pomona College Magazine stated, “The now discredited eugenics movement was not considered out of the mainstream in those days and had many other noteworthy proponents, including President Theodore Roosevelt and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.” In 1958, Pomona named its Millikan Laboratory for Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy after the physicist.\n\nMillikan died on Dec. 19, 1953, in San Marino. Before his death, he won several awards for his work, including the Comstock Prize of the National Academy of Sciences and the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society of Great Britain.\n\nContact Nadra Nittle at 562-499-1291."
