        "meta_description": "IT is stated by Science Service, of Washington, D.C., that a Roosevelt Medal for achievement in science has been presented to Dr. Robert Andrews Millikan, director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics and chairman of the executive council of the California Institute of Technology. The presentation was made by James R. Garfield, Secretary of the Interior in the Roosevelt Cabinet. The medal is one of a series of awards established in 1923 by the Roosevelt Memorial Association. Usually three are given each year in three out of twelve fields of activity associated with Col. Roosevelt's career, but only one award has been made in 1932. Dr. Millikan has become widely known because of his achievements in physical research and was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1923. Outstanding among his accomplishments are the measuring of the charge on the electron and the study of cosmic radiation. Former recipients of the Roosevelt medal for work of a scientific nature include: Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History; Dr. Frank M. Chapman, curator of ornithology for the Museum; Dr. Herbert Putnam, librarian of Congress; and Richard E. Byrd, explorer.",
