        "text": "13 Nobel Laureates\n\nThirteen Nobel laureates have enriched our department through their contributions as students, postdocs, or faculty members, including John Bardeen, the only person to have won two Nobel Prizes in Physics, and Anthony J. Leggett, currently the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Chair in Physics.\n\n2003 Sir Peter Mansfield\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\n\"for discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging\"\n\nMansfield was a postdoctoral researcher with Charles P. Slichter, 1962–64.\n\n2003 Sir Anthony J. Leggett\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\n\"for pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids\"\n\nLeggett received postdoctoral training here with David Pines (1964–65) and has been a member of our faculty since 1983.\n\n1989 Norman Ramsey\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\n\"for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method and its use in the hydrogen maser and other atomic clocks\"\n\nRamsey was an assistant professor of physics in 1940 before leaving for war service.\n\n1977 Rosalyn Sussman Yalow\n\nNobel Prize in Medicine\n\n\"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones\"\n\nYalow was a student of Maurice Goldhaber and received an Illinois physics PhD in 1945.\n\n1973 Brian Josephson\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\n\"for his theoretical predictions of the properties of a supercurrent through a tunnel barrier, in particular those phenomena which are generally known as the Josephson effects\"\n\nJosephson was a postdoctoral research associate at Illinois Physics, working with John Bardeen and David Pines, in 1965–66.\n\n1972 John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and J. Robert Schrieffer\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with Leon Cooper and Robert Schrieffer)\n\n\"for their jointly developed theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS-theory\"\n\n1972 Leon Cooper\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with John Bardeen and Robert Schrieffer)\n\n\"for their jointly developed theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS-theory\"\n\nCooper was a postdoctoral research associate at Illinois Physics from 1955 to 1957.\n\n1972 J. Robert Schrieffer\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper)\n\n\"for their jointly developed theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS-theory\"\n\nSchrieffer was a student of John Bardeen; he received his PhD from Illinois in 1957. He was an assistant professor at Illinois Physics 1959–61, and an associate professor in 1962.\n\n1969 Murray Gell-Mann\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\n\"for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions\"\n\nGell-Mann was a postdoctoral research associate at Illinois Physics in 1951 and a visiting research professor in 1952–53, while he was an instructor at the University of Chicago. Gell-Mann was attracted to the University of Illinois because Wheeler Loomis paid summer salaries—about the only source of summer money for theorists at the time. He spent two productive summers in the fourth-floor Physics \"penthouse,\" working with Francis Low on what came to be known as the Gell-Mann-Low equations of particle theory. He is said to have commented that it was so hot in the penthouse that they had to write everything in ink, because pencil notations got too smudged from sweat.\n\n1959 Emilio Segrè\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with Owen Chamberlain)\n\n\"for their discovery of the antiproton\"\n\nSegrè was a visiting professor at Illinois Physics in 1951–52.\n\n1957 Tsung-Dao Lee\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with Chen Ning Yang)\n\n\"for their penetrating investigation of the so-called parity laws which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\"\n\nLee was a postdoctoral research associate at Illinois Physics in 1952–53.\n\n1957 Chen Ning Yang\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with Tsung-Dao Lee)\n\n\"for their penetrating investigation of the so-called parity laws which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\"\n\nYang was a postdoctoral research associate at Illinois Physics in 1952–53. He returned as a visiting professor in 1964.\n\n1956 John Bardeen\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (with William Shockley and Walter Brattain)\n\n\"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect\"\n\nBardeen was a professor at Illinois Physics from 1951 until his death in 1991.\n\n1955 Polykarp Kusch\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\n\"for his precision determination of the magnetic moment of the electron\"\n\nA student of Wheeler Loomis, Kusch received an Illinois PhD in 1936."
