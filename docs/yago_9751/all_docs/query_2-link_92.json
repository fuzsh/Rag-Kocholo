        "text": "Notes\n\nRanked #3 on the album chart. 110,000 copies sold.\n\nNo singles were released from this album but music videos were made for \"...In Heaven...\", Physical Neurose\", and \"Victims of Love\".\n\nThe was the first Buck-Tick album to have artwork and design by Ken Sakaguchi, who would go on to work with the band for many years. He did the artwork for 2 other releases earlier this same year.\n\n\"Fragile Article\" is practically an instrumental. It originally had lyrics in English but Atsushi didn't know how to sing it and sang \"la la la\" instead.\n\nThis was the first album that U-ta used a fretless bass. It was during \"Oriental Love Story.\"\n\nThe influence of Bauhaus is undeniable in the \"Physical Neurose\" video. It is reminiscent of the video Bauhaus made for their cover of \"Telegram Sam\" in 1980.\n\nThe original title of \"Desperate Girl\" was \"Jiruba de Odoroou Ze\" (let's dance the jitterburg) because Atsushi thought it sounded like a jitterbug.\n\n\"Seventh Heaven\" was originally titled \"Chatty Bunny\". In the original lyrics, which are almost completely different from what became the lyrics for \"Seventh Heaven\" as we know it today, instead of singing in the chorus \"whisper to so far away\", Atsushi would sing \"whisper to chatty bunny\".\n\nAt the time, \"Victims of Love\" was a song Buck-Tick tended to draw out live and have an improvised jam in the middle with Hisashi creating various solos as well as Atsushi singing random lines.\n\nWith this album, Atsushi begins to write more of the lyrics. Songs with his lyrics outweigh lyrics by Hisashi.\n\nThis is the first album to have a song written by Hide.\n\nGuest musician Ken Morioka was a member of Soft Ballet at the time.\n\nThis was the first album that Buck-Tick worked with engineer Yasuaki \"V\" Shindoh. He worked with them earlier in the year and would go on to work with them a few more times.\n\nThis is the album that broke Hisashi. Their schedule was so hectic that he didn't even know what he was doing anymore. He started to hate recording in a studio with this album.\n\nThe cassette came in a slipcase with the album cover on one side and on the other side, the group picture on the back of the CD.\n\nThe first pressing of the vinyl was in a special packaging that included a slipcase with alternative artwork and an extra booklet of images (catalogue number BT-1). The extra booklet, oddly, has it's own catalogue number and price (KK1, Â¥400). Perhaps it was (intended to be) sold separately later on.\n\nThe 2007 reissue was packaged like the first pressing vinyl.\n\n\"Physical Neurose\" is the first Buck-Tick released song that contains a person's name. Gregor Samsa is the main character in the book Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka. Incidentally, the word for metamorphosis in Japanese is \"Henshin\", which is the title of another Buck-Tick song that came along a few albums later on Kurutta Taiyo.\n\nWhen performing \"...In Heaven...\" live, Atsushi would often get very close to Hisashi, as do many vocalists and lead guitarists during performances, however Atsushi's carressing of Hisashi at the given moment in the lyrics 'I want! I kiss you in heaven' was along the lines homosexual teasing that delighted many of their straight female fans. (Please note that Atsushi would do this sort of thing to Hisashi during other songs as well and though he gets close to the other members during performances, never in the same way as his interactions with Hisashi. Though this died down over the years, other Visual-kei bands picked up on this, that female fans liked the homosexual teasing and feminine male musicians.)"
