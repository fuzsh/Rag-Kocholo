        "text": "World Thinking Day 2025 - 2028\n\n100 Years of WAGGGS & World Thinking Day\n\nAs we prepare for the centenary of World Thinking Day (2026) and centenary of WAGGGS (2028), World Thinking Day is taking a new direction. Over the next four years we will celebrate our Movement through broad themes which explore our history, symbolism, people and future.\n\nThe official titles and content will be created by a volunteer writers pool, so there may be small changes if required. These themes were created following a consultation with WAGGGS staff, global volunteers and local leaders who participated in the 2024 WTD celebrations worldwide.\n\nIn line with Girl Guide and Girl Scout methodology, we are taking a girl-centered and volunteer-led approach to develop all the WTD activity packs. It is a great opportunity to develop your skills in content creation and work with an international team.\n\nIf you or your Member Organisation are interested in celebrating World Thinking Day or volunteering as part of the World Thinking Day writing team, please email wtd@wagggs.org.\n\nIn the next four years we are celebrating\n\n2025 - Our Story\n\nReflecting on the symbolism and values of our Movement, we will explore what it has meant to be a Girl Guide and Girl Scout over the years. This includes exploring how we can understand our past in the world today, while supporting girls around the world to feel confident, care about their world and develop the skills needed to make a difference.\n\n2026 - Our Friendship\n\nCelebrating 100 years of World Thinking Day. This day began with the birthday celebration of our founders and evolved into landmark event for our Movement. This is a chance to be curious and creative, to form meaningful connections with our sisters in Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting and beyond.\n\n2027 - Our People\n\nShedding light on the changemakers of the Movement. We will look at the inspiring members of our Movement and the girls and women who are always prepared to adapt to change. We will also explore how we can create more spaces for more girls and young women to grow and thrive together."
