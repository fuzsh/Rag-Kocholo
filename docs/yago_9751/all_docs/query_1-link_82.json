        "text": "Probably only Alan Rudolph, the director of Choose Me and Trouble in Mind, could have come up with the quirky vision of heaven that he has created in his new film, Made in Heaven. Instead of the customary sanitized billows of clouds, Rudolph’s heaven is a place where all your most romantic ideas seem to have flowered.\n\nHeaven is where you can spend all your time painting, while the Paris cityscape stretches out through your window; where all the streets are cobblestoned; where a bench next to a lakeside rises up over the water during a lovers’ conversation. This is, quite simply, the way Heaven really should be, a place where God is a sympathetic, slightly ornery red-haired man named Emmett.\n\nThis heaven is where Mike (Timothy Hutton) ends up after his young death in the 1950s. In Heaven, Mike meets another soul, Annie (Kelly McGillis), with whom he falls in love.\n\nFine. But according to the screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon (the obviously talented writers of Stand by Me), souls are constantly being recycled. So Annie must leave Heaven to enter the body of a baby being born on Earth, in the 1950s, and Mike begs Emmett for the chance to be born on Earth, too, and somehow find his true love. Emmett agrees, but Mike only has 30 years to locate the reborn Annie.\n\nAnd so the film leaves Heaven for a tumultuous time on Earth. Mike and Annie are new people, with no conscious memory of their past lives, and they find vastly different paths to take; she as a successful toymaker and unhappy wife of a director of TV commercials, he as an illegitimate poor child who grows up to be a drifter, crisscrossing the country in search of a something he just can’t remember.\n\nRudolph allows the movie to become an impressionistic portrait of recent times, with an especially keen ear for the way music drops into lives and helps give meaning to an era. But the romance remains of primary importance, and Rudolph remains unabashedly true to his lovers.\n\nWith his customary indulgence for eccentricity, Rudolph has populated Made in Heaven with strange and wonderful actors. He’s got members of his stock company popping up in small roles, and he’s got prominent musicians doing cameos: Ric Ocasek as a grease money, Tom Petty as a gambler, Neil Young as a truck driver who helps the hero down the road.\n\nAnd there are strange, uncredited bits, including Ellen Barkin as a floozy who uses Hutton in a scam. Most notable guest appearance is by Debra Winger (Hutton’s wife), who plays God. It isn’t just a cute stunt, either; Winger creates a complex character. She even establishes that, perhaps in response to all his awesome responsibilities in Heaven and Earth, God is a chain-smoker.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, November 1987\n\nFor Rudolph’s stock company, I must have been referring to folks like John Considine and Dirk Blocker – and Tom Robbins is in here, too. The cast is crammed with good people: Maureen Stapleton, Amanda Plummer, Ann Wedgeworth, Don Murray, David Rasche, James Gammon. My memory is that the movie doesn’t really work, but is pretty fun to watch along the way. This review has too much synopsis going on, but (writing an hour or so after seeing it, no doubt) I seem to be pleasantly in the movie’s mood."
