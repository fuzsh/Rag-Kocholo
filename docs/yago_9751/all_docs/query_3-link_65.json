Maastricht is also the city where the summit conference of the European Council was held in December 1991, which resulted in 'Treaty of Maastricht' and the Euro. Guy Haug, Delegate-at-large of the Association of European Universities (CRE), gave the keynote speech at the conference.\n\nTime: 22–24 November 1998\n\nLocation: Stockholm, Sweden\n\nTheme: International education: Interactions with the wilder community\n\nCelebrating its 10th Anniversary, the EAIE held its Annual Conference in Stockholm, Sweden.

Willem Deetman, Chairman of the Dutch Parliament and of Nuffic, spoke during the Opening Plenary of the need to guard against a 'Fortress Europe' mentality and instead to build up cooperation with developing countries. Ismail Serageldin, Vice President for Environmentally Sustainable Development at the World Bank, talked a lot about the European Idea and the need for European universities to help fight against the increasing gaps that are occurring in terms of technology and knowledge. Colin Power, Assistant Director for Education at UNESCO, also spoke of this. This conference provided a significant step forward in focusing on what are commonly referred to as North-South issues - issues dealing with the discrepancies between the developing world and the developed world. During this conference, a meeting was organised to establish a provisional Special Interest Group on North-South cooperation within the EAIE.\n\nTime: 05–07 November 1992\n\nLocation: Berlin, Germany\n\nTheme: The Atlantic link\n\n‘The Atlantic Link’ was the special theme of this conference, which concentrated on cooperation and exchange in higher education across the Atlantic.

All speakers addressing the plenary session stressed the role of education in overcoming divisive attitudes.\n\nTime: 05–07 December 1991\n\nLocation: Montpellier (La Grande Motte), France\n\nTheme: International education in Europe\n\nInternational Education in Europe was the theme for the 3rd Annual EAIE Conference, and in his keynote speech Peter Scott of the Times Higher Education Supplement noticed the following trends which could affect international education: expansion, efficiency, diversity, Europe and the enlightenment. He pleaded for Europe not to look inwards at this time of both promise and problems, but to involve countries outside Europe. He asserted that the massification of higher education should be seen and implemented in global terms and student mobility should be at the core of higher education systems.\n\nTime: 06–08 December 1990\n\nLocation: Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nTheme: The new Europe\n\n\"Almost everybody around seems to be quite excited about what is going on in Eastern and Central Europe.\" When Janusz Grzelak, deputy minister of Education in Poland, proclaimed this in his keynote speech, he not only gave a good description of the mood prevailing in Europe in 1990 but also that at the second EAIE Conference which took place again in Amsterdam. The theme of this conference, The New Europe, referred to the educational cooperation between East and West which was becoming more and interlinked, especially during that transition period for Eastern and Central Europe from central planning to a free market economy. The 1990 Conference also saw the founding of the Professional Sections, emphasising the professional character of the EAIE.\n\nTime: 07–09 December 1989\n\nLocation: Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nTheme: International relations of European higher education\n\n\"It was the right imitative at the right time and in the right way – an association of colleagues and friends, non-profit, democratic, open, something to which everybody could contribute.\" This is the way one of the founding members explained the successful launch of the European Association for International Education in 1989. Besides the formal founding of the EAIE during the Business Meeting, an extensive conference programme addressing the theme 'International Relations of European Higher Education' was attended with great enthusiasm by close to 600 people from all over Europe and the world in Amsterdam."
