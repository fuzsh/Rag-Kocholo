        "text": "1987 film by Alan Rudolph\n\nMade in HeavenDirected byAlan RudolphWritten byBruce A. Evans\n\nRaynold GideonProduced byDavid Blocker\n\nBruce A. Evans\n\nRaynold GideonStarringCinematographyJan KiesserEdited byTom WallsMusic byMark IshamDistributed byLorimar Filmed Entertainment\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n102 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$13 million[1]Box office$4,573,000\n\nMade in Heaven is a 1987 American fantasy comedy film directed by Alan Rudolph, script from Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, and produced by Lorimar Productions. The film stars Timothy Hutton and Kelly McGillis and has cameos by Tom Petty, Ric Ocasek in his film debut, Ellen Barkin and Neil Young. Emmett, a chain-smoking male angel, was played by Debra Winger (Hutton's then wife), but the character was only credited as being played by \"Himself.\"\n\nThe original music score was composed by Mark Isham. The film was marketed with the tagline \"How in Heaven did they meet? How on Earth will they find each other?\"\n\nMade in Heaven concerns two souls who cross paths in Heaven and then attempt to reconnect once they are reborn on Earth.\n\nIn 1988, the film was released on VHS format as well as digital stereo LaserDisc format. In 2009, the film made its DVD debut as part of the Warner Archive Collection.\n\nIn a small Pennsylvania town in 1957, Mike Shea (Hutton) dreams of escaping small-town life and moving to California with his girlfriend Brenda Carlucci. But Brenda leaves him with his motor running and Mike takes off alone.\n\nOn the way to California, Mike rescues a woman and her children from their car that went into a river, but he drowns in the process. Finding himself in Heaven, his Aunt Lisa greets him, and explains the rules and regulations. While searching for someone he used to know, Mike comes across heavenly guide Annie Packert (McGillis), and instantly they fall in love.\n\nUnlike Mike, Annie has not yet lived on Earth, so their love is interrupted just as they are going to perform a wedding ceremony. As she has not yet earned her wings on Earth, she must leave on a tour of duty and put in time inhabiting a human body.\n\nMike is beside himself with despair, but the heavenly powers, in the form of Emmett Humbird, chain-smoking and sporting an orange crew-cut, offer him a deal: Mike can return to Earth for 30 years to search for Annie, with the stipulation that neither he nor Annie will remember each other.\n\nAlly, the reincarnation of Annie, names her imaginary friend Mike. She grows up, gets married and writes a book whose protagonist is Mike. Her husband leaves her, and she is disconnected for a time. She dreams and daydreams of Mike, which confuses her, as she's not yet met him in this life.\n\nMike is reborn as Elmo. When he is 28, Emmett visits him to remind him of his purpose because he is living aimlessly and wasting time. Just conned by a woman, Mike is wandering down the road. Later, he gets a copy of Ally's book.\n\nMike ends up meeting his original parents while hitchhiking; they are kind to him and buy him a trumpet. As a result, Elmo starts his musical career and ends up writing a hit song that he had been working on in Heaven. The song was \"We Never Danced\"—one of the last things Annie said to Mike in heaven.\n\nMike/Elmo ends up finding Ally/Annie on the street at the end of the film, and their eyes lock on one another. It's his 30th birthday—they met in the nick of time.\n\nActor Role Timothy Hutton Mike Shea/Elmo Barnett Kelly McGillis Annie Packert/Ally Chandler Maureen Stapleton Aunt Lisa Ann Wedgeworth Annette Shea James Gammon Steve Shea Mare Winningham Brenda Carlucci Don Murray Ben Chandler Timothy Daly Tom Donnelly David Rasche Donald Summer Amanda Plummer Wiley Foxx Willard E.
