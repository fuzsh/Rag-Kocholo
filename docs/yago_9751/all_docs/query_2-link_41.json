Spend a day, a week, or a lifetime in Fayette County and enjoy La Grange, Texas.\n\nThe streets of La Grange were laid out several years before the organization of Fayette County in 1837. First populated by Austin's colonists - \"The Original Three Hundred\", then followed by German immigrants in the 1840's and Czech and Moravians in the 1850's, the cultures of these pioneers are evident today and have been proudly passed through generations.\n\nMore about La Grange"
