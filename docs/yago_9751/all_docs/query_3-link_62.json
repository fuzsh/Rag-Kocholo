The recent alignment between CDP and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) simplifies financed emissions reporting. This collaboration is supporting financial institutions to transparently disclose in line with the PCAF Standard and demonstrate their progress to reduce real world emissions.\n\nIntroducing CDP’s corporate questionnaire for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs): how our Accredited Solutions Providers can help SMEs with their environmental ambition and action.\n\nCDP Partnerships Team - August 08 2024\n\nWith SMEs accounting for approximately 50% of global emissions and 90% of global business, supplier engagement from an ESG perspective is an area many companies are focusing on. It is therefore increasingly important that SMEs are equipped with the knowledge, tools and resources they need to disclose and accelerate their environmental action."
