        "text": "Earlier this year, I had a long conversation with Jamal Joseph, who in 1969 was prosecuted alongside Afeni Shakur as one of the Panther 21 and would later earn two college degrees and begin a career as a playwright while in federal lockup for harboring Afeni’s husband, Mutulu. This was at an exhibit in downtown L.A. that displayed hundreds of papers and artifacts from 2Pac’s life. Toward the end of our talk, Joseph nodded at the exhibit’s final portion, which I had yet to see. He asked: “Do you see how high the walls got?”\n\nI thought, at first, that he was speaking in metaphor. But in a room dedicated to the final year of Pac’s life, the exhibitors had stacked master reels from his brief time on Death Row Records, and they reached so high as to make visitors claustrophobic. By all accounts—and in any reading of his work—Pac felt, in that final year, that the walls were closing in around him. He rapped about death even more than he had before going to prison; he worked at a frantic pace, living off per diem and barring his collaborators from editing their work. He had things to say to Bill Clinton, C. Delores Tucker, and other critics of his work, but the sessions for All Eyez on Me and the album that would become The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory were so frenzied that they were usually crowbarred into songs that doubled as radio singles about sex, or lists of grievances with fellow rappers.\n\n“Picture Me Rollin’” bucks this trend. Tucked in the middle of All Eyez’s second disc, it is the rare moment across that opus when Pac allows himself to breathe, reminisce, luxuriate in shreds of revenge. This is true not so much during his verse—a typically magnetic masterpiece of fear and defiance (“My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone”)—but in the outro, where Pac sounds positively gleeful as he taunts the district attorney who locked him up and the COs who made his life hell in prison. “Can you see me?” he cackles at them. “Am I clear to you?” —Paul Thompson\n\nIn Los Angeles, you’re almost always near the ocean, but also far from it. Sometimes, it’s a matter of distance: In sunlight, a 10-mile drive to the coast can take hours. Sometimes, it’s a matter of perspective: The vision of L.A. that Kendrick Lamar paints on good kid, m.A.A.d. city is mere minutes from the beach, but seemingly a world apart from it.\n\nComing as a bonus track on the deluxe version of the darkly poetic good kid, m.A.A.d. city, “The Recipe” remix is a reprieve from the violence and existential crossroads that define the album’s narrative. It’s not the best song that he and his full Black Hippy collective created—that’s possibly “Say Wassup” or even their take on “U.O.E.N.O.”—and it’s not the one that showcases the collective’s full potential (that’s likely early highlight “Zip That Chop That”). But “The Recipe” is their most L.A. song, complete with a Dr. Dre cosign and a smooth Scoop Deville production. The song begins with the sound of a plane landing at LAX—a sign this will be a vacation from the world of “Sherane” and “Money Trees”—before Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and ScHoolboy Q give praise to the three Ws that define their city: women, weed, and weather. Over the course of four minutes, the quartet luxuriates in good vibes, cruising down blocks with the top down and offering visions of ladies with their tops off. It’s a beachside oasis amid a palm-treed Hades, and a reminder that sometimes all you need is a few simple things to find peace. It’s also a reminder to kick your Nike Cortezes up—it’s gonna take awhile to get back home, so make the most of it. —Justin Sayles\n\nAfter the success of West Coast gangsta rap in the late ’80s and early ’90s, artists and labels from coast to coast wanted to cash in on the craze. However, many of the rappers who hopped on the bandwagon were labeled as frauds or studio gangsters, using street fables to exploit a lifestyle they never actually lived.\n\nRecord producer Ronnie “Ronnie Ron” Phillips had an idea of how to combat this epidemic and make the music more authentic: a supergroup of actual Bloods and Crips. Ronnie held auditions for the best rappers from each set (for most it was their first time in a recording studio) and settled on 16 artists—eight from each faction.\n\nThe album, Bangin’ on Wax, was recorded in two weeks in 1993, with a lineup that included the likes of Tweedy Bird Loc, Bloody Mary, Sin Loc (who famously donned a Freddy Krueger mask on the cover), Battlecat (who was already established as a producer and DJ), and Genuine Draft (who would blow up later in 1993 as Domino, who also appears on this list as a solo artist).\n\nWhile the album was largely seen as a cash grab and gimmick by critics, it did produce the minor hit “Piru Love,” which received heavy airplay on BET’s Rap City and was a favorite on The Box. Over a slick flip of Zapp & Roger’s “Computer Love” by producer J. Stank, the Bloods celebrated their respective sets and gave Middle America a crash course in L.A. gang slang. (“Piru is Crip in reverse but the C’s on its back.”)\n\nWhile the Crips had the more established artists of the bunch, none of their contributions matched the height of “Piru Love.” They did make some noise, however, with their single “Steady Dippin’,” which celebrated SoCal lowrider culture and the Blue side of things. —Andrew Barber\n\nIn the early ’90s, Long Beach was a gold mine for rap talent: Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg, and Daz Dillinger, to name a few. Warren G, who had a firsthand account of Death Row’s success, decided to try his hand at his own label named G-Funk Records under the Def Jam umbrella. He went on to sign two acts from Long Beach: the Twinz and the Dove Shack, both of which released their debut albums on the same day in August 1995. Both contained minor hits, but one lives on as one of L.A. County’s best nearly three decades later.\n\nSummertime in Southern California has inspired countless songs—in rap or otherwise—but this one by the trio of Bo-Roc, C-Knight, and 2Scoops is easily among the best. Every piece of the track serves a different function that locks into place perfectly: the beat, built from guitars, pianos, and drums; guest singer Arnita Porter’s verse, where she cruises the Long Beach coast wearing Daisy Dukes in a 1994 Jeep Wrangler; 2Scoops’s urgent flow, which gives the impression he had to finish his verse quickly because he was next in line to grab his plate of free lunch and go about his afternoon. But perhaps the most profound part comes courtesy Bo-Roc and his deep baritone voice, when he says, “I’m smothering ribs with barbecue sauce / Fools get tossed if they reach across my barbecue grill, so continue to chill.'' It shows both sides of Bo: his affinity for barbecue ribs and cookout culture, but also his upbringing on the notorious east side of Long Beach, which is home to many gangs I’d rather not name here.\n\nWhen I traveled to Honolulu in 2021, “Summertime in the LBC” was played everywhere as if it were on the new Drake album. I heard it in bars, on the radio, and speakers controlled by natives with the aux cord. You can’t go to a cookout, a pool party, or the islands of Hawaii without being smothered by this song like ribs with barbecue sauce, or getting tossed if you reach across to change the track, even all these years later. —Rosecrans Vic\n\nCapitalism shouldn’t sound good. If any community should be the most antagonistic to the toxic, all-consuming nature of the American dollar it would be that of the modern rapper. But if hip-hop has proved anything it’s that songs about wanting, chasing, and/or flaunting money have an exponentially high hit rate. Which is a long way of saying, I don’t know whether Marx would fuck with “Money Trees,” but it’s a song so perfect he might make an exception.\n\n“Money Trees” is one of the most deceptively dark songs on good kid, m.A.A.d. City. Together, Kendrick and Jay Rock spin a tale of inhumane poverty—home invasions, Top Ramen, baking soda, and turkey-less Thanksgiving. The life of a rapper is a far-flung dream for Kendrick and his childhood friends before they’re ripped back to a reality where even the slight flex of a Louis belt isn’t enough to stem the dread of daily existence. For these reasons alone, “Money Trees” is one of the most potent songs to come out of L.A. in the past 20 years.\n\nThen comes the Jay Rock verse.\n\nFor a minute straight, Rock is a man possessed. His words tumble out of his mouth like they contain a lifetime of regret, resentment, and resolve. It’s a tightrope act of suspense, where at any moment the TDE originator might miss a pocket and fall behind the beat. Yet he never does. Instead, Rock barrels forward with the type of alliteration, forced rhyme, and descriptive prose that makes him feel like an artist fully in grasp of his talents. Within 16 bars, Rock builds a world of intense humanity. His projects are the place of “cocaine residue,” government cheese, and where Santa doesn’t visit. “Money Trees” is a nature-vs.-nurture story documenting generations of people forced to make impossible decisions against improbable odds. In that way, there are very few songs that could sound more like L.A. —Charles Holmes\n\nThe year was 1990, and Kid Frost was tired of dudes getting over on the raza (technically translates to “race” in English, but more accurately used as a metonym for “our people”). So he made a song about it. By that time, Frost had been rapping for eight years, challenging the likes of Ice-T to battles, having Dr. Dre and DJ Yella spin records at his shows, and breakdancing for Uncle Jamm’s Army, but he still had no tangible success. Being the first Chicano rapper in the music business couldn’t have been easy, but the moment he leaned into that reality with “La Raza,” his career was off to the races.\n\nA funky bassline kicks this instrumental off, followed by a sample of “Viva Tirado” by brown-eyed soul band El Chicano. The most distinguishable instrument in this song, however, is the snazzy saxophone over the chorus. It’s important to note that the first lyrics Frost raps are in Spanish: “Q-Vo, aqui estoy, MC Kid Frost / Yo soy jefe, matón, yes the Big Boss / My cuete's loaded, it's full of balas.” That translates to: “What’s up, here I am, MC Kid Frost / I’m the boss, the killer, the big boss / my gun is loaded and it’s full of bullets.” The rest of the song masterfully mixes English and Spanish, culminating in one of the best bilingual bars of all time: “You’re so cool that I’ma call you a culo.\"\n\nThe visual for this song was so powerful. Rife with Aztec symbolism and displays of Chicano culture, it was the first time lowrider culture was displayed in hip-hop to the masses, reaching national shows like Yo! MTV Raps. This song not only influenced thousands of Latinos, but it empowered them to be brown and proud while paving the way for those who would soon follow. —Rosecrans Vic\n\nFor the first decade and a half of this millennium, Dr. Dre cast a long shadow of perfectionist tyranny over mainstream L.A. rap. MCs aspired to become metronome Terminators, chasing a bulletproof, mistake-free, and polished ideal. Then Drakeo dropped “Impatient Freestyle,” hopping out of the Batmobile (a Mercedes) with his eyes closed, spilling juice, clutching a chopper the size of a toddler, and revolutionizing West Coast rap.\n\nOn his first two I Am Mr. Mosely mixtapes, the South-Central foreign whip crasher introduced his counterclockwise, slithering brand of nervous music. This is where he mastered it—simultaneously taking it back to the offbeat Ras Kass, Aceyalone, Suga Free attack while sounding like none of his ancestors. After this song dropped, it became impossible not to hear the mumbling, conversational mud walk flow that absorbed almost every breakout street rapper from San Diego to Seattle. He became L.A.’s Gucci Mane, ushering in esoteric lingo, fluorescent get-money flexes, and sinister taunts. (“If I call you-know-who, you know the job is done.”) Los Angeles rap exists in phases of before and after “Impatient Freestyle,” as it once did with N.W.A and The Chronic. Drakeo might as well have set the city’s supply of khakis on fire and sent all the lowriders to the scrap heap.\n\nOnly innate genius and relentless dedication can make something so difficult seem this effortless. This is like a duck smoothly gliding on a pond: On top of the water, it looks calm; seen from below, it’s furiously paddling. It initially sounds slow, rapped in an opiated chopped and screwed ooze, until you realize that he’s practically spitting in double time, never breaking a sweat or cramming in too many words to fit the bars.\n\nFrom London on Da Track’s beat, originally conceived for Jeremih’s late-night seductions, Drakeo hallucinates a quintessentially L.A. nightmare. The song is stripped of carnality, but the smoothness and sleeplessness remain. This is a prowler’s anthem made for the home invasion hours: a two-and-a-half-minute creepy crawl with no hook, obscure references, witty punch lines, and neck-swiveling menace. It ends with a coda of coded shit talking that Pac would’ve envied. Suge would’ve risked everything just to sign him. —Jeff Weiss\n\nThe book of Revelation prophesizes that the opening of God’s seventh seal will cue seven angelic trumpeters whose brass melodies trigger plagues that turn the seas to blood, envelop the sky in total darkness, and unleash earthquakes that reduce great cities to rubble. So it would naturally follow that Freestyle Fellowship’s “7th Seal”—a mystic language masked as a subterranean hip-hop classic—theoretically catalyzed the biblical infernos, seismic chaos, civil unrest, and Dancing Itos that wracked L.A. in the ’90s.\n\nThis was the new invasion, the black magic divinations summoned by Michael “Myka 9” Troy, or Microphone Mike—the South-Central-raised Goliath born to a brilliant ne’er-do-well trumpeter who allegedly cracked his 4-year-old prodigy upside the head with claves as punishment for failing to keep accurate time. After earning local renown for clowning Bobby Jimmy and the Critters on KDAY and ghostwriting a couple of songs on N.W.A and the Posse, rap’s John the Revelator formed the Freestyle Fellowship, whose self-pressed limited run of To Whom It May Concern became jazz-rap’s holy grail. Myka’s archangel levitations obliterated conventional time signatures. He heralds the group’s own ascendance: “Be advised they’ll come from a pure black whirlwind.”\n\nIf modal jazz flips defined the generation, Myka 9 was among the first to decipher how to become the instrument itself. The “7th Seal” sample comes from George Duke and Billy Cobham live fusion wax, but Myka somehow embodies both saxophone and trumpet. A light-speed baritone, sinking and soaring like a spaceship launched from Alpha Centauri, crashing into a Leimert Park health food hideaway. His influences included John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and the sounds of the birds. (“When I come home late at night,” Myka once said, “there are finches and sparrows singing. I listen to the way they sing, the way their sounds blend. I try to duplicate what they do.”)\n\nMark the beginning of L.A.’s hyper-technical avant-garde strain with this cleansing of all stagnant flows. Everything from the Low End Theory to Kendrick Lamar owes a spiritual debt to Freestyle Fellowship and “7th Seal.” When Busta Rhymes first heard these “warping telekinetic measures of rhythmic unison,” he allegedly exclaimed, “What type of style is this?” In the L.A. old school, they used to call freestyling “sky rapping.” More than three decades later, Myka 9 still hasn’t landed. —Jeff Weiss\n\nThink about the sheer number of things “Deep Cover” is responsible for: the launch of Dre’s solo career in a sinister fashion; the introduction of Snoop Dogg, who stalks the track like the grim reaper for undercover detectives; popularizing California Penal Code in the broader culture; the birth of a beat so addictive that Biggie rapped on it just before the Bad Boy–Death Row feud and Big Pun used it as the backdrop for his most spellbinding tongue twisting. (One thing it couldn’t do was make anyone watch the film it served as the theme to; like the totally real movie Judgment Night, Deep Cover seems to exist only for the songs it contains.)\n\nBuilt largely on a four-note bass line and a Sly & the Family Stone drum break, this pre–Chronic Dre single has gone from casualty of the Body Count controversy to soundtrack curiosity to street classic to one of hip-hop’s most influential songs, full stop. For all the credit Dre gets for smoothing out the edges of gangsta rap with “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” and Doggystyle, it’s easy to forget just how ominous his music could sound. “Deep Cover” distills that energy to its purest form. And while he’s no one’s platonic ideal of a dexterous rapper—even on this early solo showcase, he can sound wooden—he’s proved himself as rap’s greatest talent scout. Here, he does so by unveiling perhaps his greatest find: a 21-year-old, rail-thin Snoop Dogg. (For all the credit Snoop gets for his otherworldly charisma, it’s easy to forget how menacing he can sound; “Tonight’s the night like Betty Wright, and I’m chilling,” he raps cooly mid-verse. “Killing, feeling no remorse, yeah.”) “Deep Cover” is a master class in using a song to evoke atmosphere, and it pushed past the limits of what it meant for a rap song to be considered hardcore. It wouldn’t have the same commercial success as the singles from The Chronic, but 30 years later, it’s just as responsible for everything that came after it. —Justin Sayles\n\nOK, let’s just get it out of the way: The D.O.C. is from Dallas. But in the video for “It’s Funky Enough,” with his Kings hat and villain-in-black outfit, the D.O.C. looked like a native of the L.A. rap world that he shaped both on and off the mic. In the mid-’80s as a member of the Fila Fresh Crew, the Texan grabbed the attention of Dr. Dre, who encouraged him to move out west. He subsequently became a key collaborator in the super producer’s long (and sometimes whispered about) history of collaboration. The D.O.C. ghostwrote on Straight Outta Compton and Eazy-Duz-It, and went on to be a critical part of Death Row’s early years—in The Chronic’s credits, Dre singled him out “for talking me into doin’ this album.” But in the space between those two moments, the D.O.C. was poised to become the star of Ruthless Records’ second phase, thanks largely to this song. Over one of Dre’s best beats from that era, the D.O.C. is commanding presence, even when he is rapping in a fake patois. His performance on “It’s Funky Enough” is indelible, a strand in hip-hop’s lyrical DNA that’s just as crucial as “Top Billin” and “La-Di-Da-Di.” Sadly, just four months after the release of his debut album, No One Can Do It Better, the D.O.C. fell asleep at the wheel after a night of partying. He crashed on the Ventura Freeway and flew through his car’s rear window. Though that accident could have ended his life, instead it destroyed his vocal cords, leaving him with just a rasp. A generation of rap literally lost one of its most promising voices, but thankfully it didn’t lose his words. —Eric Ducker\n\nWhat would it take for you to kill someone? Granted, it’s much easier considering than actually doing, and you don’t want to be in the position to have to ponder it regardless, but here’s an example, courtesy of B-Real: “One-time tried to come in my home / Take my chrome, I said ‘Yo, it’s on.” Was it necessary? No, as he acknowledges (“Didn’t have to blast out, but I did anyway”), but it’s a glimpse of the mentality at the core of Cypress Hill’s breakout hit.\n\nCypress Hill describes homicide so casually on “How I Could Just Kill a Man” that it’s almost chilling, but B-Real, Sen Dog, and DJ Muggs each do their part to make it sound exquisite. Sen Dog punctuates B-Real’s animated, nasally delivery on the hook, where the former goes low while the latter goes high. But it’s DJ Muggs who shines brightest in the background, crafting the aggressive, plodding canvas built on Manzel’s “Midnight Theme.” He adds Jimi Hendrix’s wailing guitar on the chorus, then inserts an off-kilter organ riff from the Music Machine’s “Come On In” at the beginning of the final verse. Each layer adds to the journey.\n\nAdmitted recklessness notwithstanding, “How I Could Just Kill a Man” isn’t all wanton disregard for life. As B-Real reminds, you might not be able to comprehend what it takes to pull a trigger if you haven’t been in certain scenarios. To truly understand is to know that you may never understand—and you probably don’t want to, either. —Julian Kimble\n\nIn the early 1980s, the LAPD purchased two Cadillac Gage V100s, a military-grade vehicle designed for a variety of battlefield uses. They were supposed to be used for high-risk warrant arrests. This being Daryl Gates’s LAPD, that was often not the case. The department affixed 10-foot battering rams to both, adorning each with a crudely painted smiley face and the phrase “Have a nice day.” The V100s became harbingers of destruction cruising the streets of South-Central and adjacent neighborhoods, as the department tasked with serving and protecting the area transformed it into a new kind of battlefield. Soon, the battering rams were being deployed extrajudicially, knocking down suspected crack houses and whatever else overzealous LAPD officers felt was appropriate. (In one mission, it destroyed a home while two mothers and three young children sat inside eating ice cream.)\n\nThese raids caught the attention of Johnnie Cochran, who lambasted the department for civil rights violations and wanton destruction. They also caught the attention of Compton Posse member Toddy Tee, who came up with a shorthand name for these seven-ton monuments to force: the batterram. Inspired by the wreckage he saw around him, Tee wrote a song about the V100s and recorded it in his rudimentary home studio. As legend has it, the early lo-fi, Dr. Dre–produced version spread throughout the city until famed L.A. DJ Greg “Rap Attack” Mack heard it at a promotion event at a high school. Mack began playing it on KDAY—off tape reels, as Tee had yet to record the song to wax—and it quickly became a local hit. Eventually, the song made its way into the ears of funk singer Leon Haywood (who, coincidentally, would later be sampled to genre-redefining success by Dr. Dre). Haywood signed on to produce what would become the classic version of “Batterram,” a song as responsible as any for the creation of the subgenre we now call “gangsta rap.”\n\nIn its final form, “Batterram” is a seven-minute electro-tinged horror story, in which the V100s become an unstoppable force, tearing through your street and heading straight toward your front door. Its first verse tells the story of an alleged drug dealer who beat his case, only to find a threat lurking outside his home: “You won't hear a snatch, you'll hear a boom,” Tee raps, his voice serving as the warning siren the V100s lacked. It’s a chilling tale—one where there’s a thin line between heroes and villains, and a thinner one between life and death. “Batterram” is proof that simply telling your story can be political, even if you never set out to tell an overtly political tale.\n\nEventually, the LAPD succumbed to the political pressure spurred partly by the success of “Batterram.” Within a few years, the V100s were decommissioned. That’s not to say the LAPD changed its ways—this was only a few years before the Rodney King beating and the Rampart scandal, and even today, there are questions about the department’s use of force. But like “Fuck Tha Police” and other indelible rap songs that double as protest anthems, “Batterram” lives on as a testament to the power of music that’s too often dismissed as a glorification of violence—and a reminder that sometimes the worst violence is perpetrated by those who are supposed to serve and protect. —Justin Sayles\n\nIt’s hard to believe that one of the most memorable personalities in rap history had to spend so much time introducing himself. As with “Deep Cover,” “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang,” and “Who Am I? (What’s My Name?),” “Gin and Juice” begins as a form of branding: “With so much drama in the LBC, it’s kinda hard being Snoop D-O-double-G.” And having spotted you the first line, how much of “Gin and Juice” can you go on to recite from memory? At least the entire first verse? All of it? Think about all the “important” things that “they ain’t leavin’ till 6 in the morning” or “Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I’m fucked up now” have pushed out of your brain—birthdays, court dates, bills, and so forth.\n\nBut as to why “Gin and Juice” is embedded in the cultural lexicon to a degree that no other Snoop Dogg song can match, it all comes back to how Snoop Dogg somehow fades into the background. He’s one of the biggest rap stars on the planet, but on this song he still lives with his mom. Here, Dr. Dre is not the genius architect behind one of the most profound pop cultural shifts of the 20th century, but a guy who refreshes the party favors. Up to that point, Snoop’s music was about the experience of being Snoop Dogg; no one outside of Long Beach or Compton could hear anything from The Chronic and think, “Yeah, I’ve been there.” Perhaps “Gin and Juice” was too accessible, as those of us raised in the Napster era are still likely traumatized by the Gourds’ alt-country cover. But like the best party music, Snoop’s masterwork is relatable if you’ve ever been in a car, smoked weed, got drunk, and felt like life couldn’t possibly get any better. —Ian Cohen\n\nWhen 2Pac joined Death Row, it was something like two high-speed trains colliding and creating a giant fireball of an explosion. Death Row, thanks to Suge Knight’s strength and fear factor and Dr. Dre being in his production heyday, was a massive, seemingly unstoppable force of mega-hits and mega-talent. 2Pac was already a superstar, but after a stint in jail and being targeted in a nearly fatal robbery, he was a man on fire. He kicked off a vengeance tour like none other. Out of all of that came arguably the most important song in all of West Coast rap history: “California Love.”\n\n2Pac’s rhymes with Dr. Dre’s production made for a highly potent mixture that couldn’t fail. Not only is it a perfect party record but it’s the perfect L.A. party record, a gleefully vibrant ode to hedonistic Southern California vices and culture. Dre reinvents and reinvigorates Ronnie Hudson’s record “West Coast Poplock” as not only the ultimate party jam for the ’90s, but a celebratory announcement of Pac’s return to the outside world. The subsequent music video only propelled this image further with the Mad Max–themed party in the desert; the apocalypse could come and Death Row would still be on top and jamming on your skulls, so get used to it. Dre and Pac turned out to be too powerful and too combustible to actually last, as their relationship would fall apart very soon after. It’s an absolute shame, too—the surround sound of Dre’s production is a perfect canvas for 2Pac’s unsparing, pent-up aggression and irascible charm. It sounds like actual bombs going off during the “Shake it, shake it, baby” refrain, making this song feel larger than life. “California Love” is as nuclear now as it was when it debuted in 1995. And yes, of course, California still knows how to party. —Israel Daramola\n\nThe thundering centerpiece of good kid, m.A.A.D city is a nearly six-minute chronicle of innocence lost, a breathless, claustrophobic spiral into the perpetual war Kendrick Lamar grew up inside. Frantic, and replete with the expected trauma and gore, the song still manages to convey the depth of what was taken from Lamar and his generation: “A wall of bullets comin’ from AKs, ARs,” he raps, and then, in the same breath, “‘Ay, y’all–duck!’ That’s what Momma said when we was eating that free lunch.” “m.A.A.d city” is a Technicolor coming-of-age nightmare with the bird’s-eye scope of an LAPD chopper and the detail of an autopsy. Lamar was already the savior of L.A. when good kid, m.A.A.D city dropped, but “m.A.A.d city” is what cemented him as the city’s cryptkeeper.\n\nPart one is anchored by longtime collaborator Sounwave’s looping John Carpenter violins and earthquaking 808s. It’s nocturnal and frenetic, blood red and pitch black; it’s the quiet of night interrupted by gunfire and sirens, the crushing weight of the memory, at age 9, of seeing someone in a new light after suspecting them of murder. But almost as soon as it starts, the song switches: When legendary Compton rapper MC Eiht’s voice emerges on the Terrace Martin–produced part two—“Wake yo punk ass up!” he yells, just as he did at the opening of “Streiht Up Menace,” his 1993 ur-text of L.A. gangsta rap realism—Lamar’s rapping moves from the material to the straight up poetic, as if he’s floating above his dead body. He’s “Compton’s human sacrifice,” a formerly faultless teenager now carrying a big enough gun to hold an entire cul-de-sac hostage.\n\nThe choice to feature Eiht, the “Deep Cover” drums and Chronic synths, the same sample as Ice Cube’s “A Bird in the Hand,” the references to the 1992 Bloods and Crips truce—“m.A.A.d. City” is, maybe most of all, a 25-year-old Lamar’s attempt to position himself in the history of Los Angeles, and to claim a place in its rap pantheon. It worked. And then he took on the world. —Jackson Howard\n\nWhen reduced to bullet points, Ice-T’s life reads like the plot of an adventure novel. He was kicked from one coast to the other after the tragic deaths of his parents; he tried his hand as a hustler and a heavy metal kid, a soldier and a jewel thief; he eventually became the catalyst for a debate over free speech among parties who were forgetting the fundamental, underlying truth: that Ice’s speech was more stylish than virtually anyone else’s on the planet.\n\nBut the fantastical is the enemy of the real. When Ice was selling drugs, he wasn’t Tony Montana—he was trying to flip the Social Security checks he got from the government in the wake of his father’s death so that he could keep his head above water and feed his young daughter. Likewise, the Army was a place of financial refuge, not a swashbuckling excursion. It was in the service that he fell in love with hip-hop. When he came home from his station in Hawaii, he came with DJ equipment under his arm. Before long he was spinning parties, rapping in the sense that the original Bronx DJs rapped: as a feature of the performance behind the decks.\n\nThese early sets were likely dominated by the electro music that Ice favored, and that inflected his earliest recorded raps, like 1984’s “Body Rock” and “Reckless.” But as he was coaxed, inch by inch, away from the turntables, he felt more and more confident deploying the oil-slick pimp talk he adapted from Iceberg Slim novels and his friends back at Crenshaw High. He stopped writing about how nice he was at parties and turned his eye to the gang culture that had exploded during his youth, and that now seemed to dictate what his peers wore, how they talked, and where they felt free to go.\n\nIn 1986, inspired by the Philadelphia gangsta rap pioneer Schoolly D’s “P.S.K. What Does It Mean?,” he got to work on a song that would eventually stretch to 10 verses and more than seven minutes, spanning almost a decade within its narrative—and even ending back in New York. “6 ‘n the Mornin’” is perhaps the only song that surpasses “P.S.K.” as a foundational text for what was originally called “reality rap.” Its depictions of crime and punishment are frequently brutal and sometimes misanthropic, its narrator essentially unflappable. It even features a delightfully tossed-off rejection of a contemporary’s work: in this case Ice’s sneering “This shit was for real—it was no ‘La-Di-Da-Di.’”\n\nAnd yet for all the influence “6 ’n the Mornin’” would exert in the genre over the next 35 years, its genius lies in its most granular details. Ice’s verses are tactile: the “fresh Adidas” that “squeak” across the bathroom floor when cops are pounding outside, the knees that ache during a dice game, the grin that spreads on a friend’s face when Ice is out of prison after seven years instead of 10. For all the years, scenes, and characters he churns through on the record, not a single detail scans as a cliché, no friend or foe an archetype. It’s overwhelmed by color, relentless in its originality. —Paul Thompson\n\nIt’s easy to forget now, but The Chronic was no sure thing.\n\nFollowing the release of N.W.A’s 1991 sophomore album, the many-times-platinum producer Dr. Dre had grown disenchanted with Ruthless Records and forged a new partnership with rapper the D.O.C., former UNLV defensive end Marion “Suge” Knight, and funk music executive Dick Griffey. (Imprisoned drug dealer Michael “Harry O” Harris would serve as their benefactor.) They wanted to name their venture Def Row—a play on the iconic New York label Def Jam—but Compton’s Most Wanted’s the Unknown DJ owned the rights to the name. So the quartet settled for the proper spelling: Death Row Records. It was a rare case in rap of proper grammar being cooler than an intentional misspelling.\n\nShortly after, the Compton native went about shopping a completed album to distributors. Except no one seemed that interested in the record that would eventually forever alter popular music history. Maybe they thought the Suge–Harry O connection was too volatile, maybe they doubted Dre as a solo artist, maybe they just didn’t get the music. But one imagines Dre putting on his crispest White Sox hat, going door-to-door at the major labels, playing his tape for white guys in suits, and getting polite rejection letters in the mail a few weeks later. It seemed no one understood what they were listening to—until it hit the ears of Jimmy Iovine and Interscope Records.\n\nInterscope was itself a fledgling enterprise, and it was all too happy to get into bed with Death Row. The two companies formed an alliance that eventually made mostly everyone involved very, very rich—and relatedly, drew plenty of controversy. But most of that would come later. First there was a matter of marketing Dre’s new music. Understanding that programmers wouldn’t catch on to the music like the label hoped, Interscope tried a bold but brilliant promotional strategy: buying 60-second radio spots teasing one song, with the hope that people couldn’t help but call into the station to request it. To work, it had to be the perfect track. I think you already know which song they picked.\n\nDebuting in late 1992, “Nuthin but a ‘G’ Thang” is an extension of what Dre was building toward with N.W.A, but still feels like a portal to a whole new world. It takes the Moog synthesizers he had deployed on beats like “Alwayz Into Somethin’” and laid them atop replayed portions of Leon Haywood’s “I Want’a Do Something Freaky to You,” creating something simultaneously warm and inviting but cold and sinister. Throw in some vocal samples from Chuck D and a few old records in Dre’s crates, and you have the perfect backdrop for Dre and his new secret weapon: a bean stalk of chill menace named Snoop Doggy Dogg.\n\nA thing Dre learned in N.W.A is that even when you’re the star, it’s best to play the background. (It’s easy to do that when working alongside a ball of fury like Ice Cube and a showman like Eazy-E.) Here, in his grand solo coming-out party, Dre holds a fair amount of ground (with verses penned by the D.O.C.), but cedes just as much territory to his protégé. Snoop goes first and does a lot with it without seeming like he’s trying to do anything at all. He’s calm and casual, but in complete command of his craft. Even the sing-songy, mostly nonsensical chorus feels cool as hell in that voice. You listen—then and now—and intuitively, you know you’re witnessing the birth of the modern rap star.\n\nMuch of The Chronic dealt with violence: inner-city mayhem, police brutality, the 1992 riots following the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King—an uprising Dre absorbed as he crafted the album miles away in his Calabasas home. (The record did not, however, deal with Dre’s own relationship with violence, which includes multiple accounts of domestic abuse and violence against women.) But while much of The Chronic is late-20th-century L.A. street culture blown up to IMAX proportions, “‘G’ Thang” and its day-in-the-life video were pure escapism. Dre and Snoop made what was by all accounts a deeply unglamorous life seem aspirational, and they made the hardest music ever created the most accessible thing on the airwaves. It wasn’t long before radio was playing this song nonstop, of its own volition.\n\nThere’s an oft-quoted comment Iovine gave to famed L.A. scribe Jonathan Gold shortly after The Chronic exploded: “See that kid over there? That’s my 12-year-old nephew from Staten Island. You couldn’t get more white and suburban than him. But Dre’s record is all the kid listens to. When you sell this many albums, they are not all going to the South Bronx.” There are several complicated realities in that statement—the way Black pain is commoditized and the way white listeners consume it among them—but the most curious phrase Iovine uses is “South Bronx,” the borough considered the birthplace of hip-hop. Intentional or not, Iovine’s choice of locale gets at another reality: Rap may have started out East, but it was revolutionized on the Left Coast. The streets of South-Central are just as important as the parks in the South Bronx, and Death Row is just as influential as Def Jam. Much of that can be traced to this song, the most impactful in L.A.’s storied rap history—and on the short list of most impactful in the genre’s. Looking back, it should’ve been obvious: Of course this was going to work. How could it not? —Justin Sayles"
