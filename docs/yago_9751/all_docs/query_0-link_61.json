        "text": "Page 41 →Chapter 4 Neo-noir and Anti-noir Playing with Tropes\n\nWe wanted to push the noir fantasy from [the 1940s] forward.\n\n—Alan Rudolph\n\nFor as much as the look and story line of Trouble in Mind buck trends of easy temporal placement, the film holds a solid place among the neo-noirs of the 1980s, with its characters, mood, set design, style, and story all bringing noir elements to the table. Stylized 1940s detective movies had been on the rise since the 1970s, with movies such as Chinatown (1974) and Farewell My Lovely (1975) leading the pack for studios; among indies was Altman’s revisionist The Long Goodbye (1973), which formally marked the unsteadiness of its noir world by a continuously moving camera. The trend continued well into the next decade (and beyond) with Body Heat (1981), culminating the next year in Ridley Scott’s inimitable Blade Runner, the mold-breaking “retro-futurist noir” whose stylistically and temporally mixed setting informs Trouble in Mind.\n\nOther films of the time, including remakes such as The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981) and No Way Out (a 1987 Page 42 →remake of The Big Clock [1948]) and new titles such as Dressed to Kill (1980) and Blood Simple (1984) used noir conventions for the sense of mystery and erotic intrigue they offered, upping the ante with bigger budgets and bigger stars. The 1986 adaptation of Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective from the UK used noir tropes—the lead character is Philip Marlowe—in its quirky musical adaptation.\n\nNoir was so ensconced within the public imagination in the 1980s that Carl Reiner was able to make a parody of the genre in his hilarious Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982). Though not a parody per se, Trouble in Mind has a certain irreverence in its homage to film noir, producing its characters and conventions with ironic affection and humor, as revealed by casting Divine as the evil Hilly Blue, the mobster whose silly name calls to mind Hill Street Blues, a popular US cop show in the 1980s, and who incarnates the iconic “vast and sinister”1 Sydney Greenstreet, known for classic noirs such as The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Casablanca (1942),2 where he is also linked to the color blue via the Blue Parrot, his nightclub down the street from Rick’s Café.\n\nRudolph describes Rain City as “a place of 40s Hollywood noir,” and, according to David Blocker, he chose Seattle “specifically for its bad weather.”3 (The producer notes that, while filming, Rudolph was always ready and wishing for rain.) Ironically, the glistening, wet, urban streets so common to film noir had to be created for the film: Seattle was going through a dry spell at the time, and adding artificial rain drew curious looks from bystanders.\n\nWhen asked about his personal take on film noir, Rudolph Page 44 →said that he “was always drawn to movies that had an invented surface. The contradiction of noir was that it felt realistic because it was so highly manipulated.”femmes fatales; and, more thematically, the deceptive nature of appearances—couldn’t be further from the minimal style stereotypically ascribed to documentaries.6 Although there were exceptions in the 1940s and 1950s, in general film noirs were not big-budget affairs until their revival in the 1970s (compare D.O.A. [1949/50] to Chinatown). Says Rudolph, “Not having lots of money forces you to come up with ideas that somehow draw upon the best things you can do. You film a certain way to compensate, and the critics call it style.”7\n\nFollow for extended description\n\n“My script for Trouble never cited time or place or design. It was straightforward, hard-boiled noir. But I wanted to stretch that.” Divine as “the Sydney Greenstreet character” was one way to upend convention; in fact, with this provocative casting, Trouble in Mind’s sense of “operatic noir” was born.Page 45 →the collective memory filmgoers have of its classic era, and his neo-noir (to French interviewers he referred to it as l’amour noir) isn’t fixed in that period in any sense. As Roger Ebert describes the film, “It does not take place in the 1940s, but its characters dress and talk and live as though it did. Could this movie have been made if there had never been any movies starring Richard Widmark, Jack Palance or Robert Mitchum? Yes, but it wouldn’t have had any style.”9\n\nAs in many noirs, fate, botched chances, and troubled histories plague the characters. Like others before him, the male protagonist of Trouble in Mind, Hawk, has a broken relationship with the police. Once a member of the force, he was fired and imprisoned for killing Fat Adolph, whom Wanda calls a “very, very dangerous man,” leaving, at this point, blurry boundaries between the law and the underworld (often depicted as twin syndicates in film noir). Protagonists’ hopes and momentary successes—typically financial or sexual—are usually killed off by corruption, collaborators who betray them, greedy women and men, and guns. Hawk brings that knowledge of corruptible dreams with him into Rain City when he says, tired as an old noir legend would be by 1985, “Let everyone get what they deserve.” Rudolph follows that precept, but only to a point.\n\nNeither Wanda nor Georgia is the classic untrustworthy femme fatale (or the bland girl next door that noir often set up in opposition to her). Wanda stands up for herself in a way that the later Ida Lupino did, even if she was behind the camera and made a different kind of film. Georgia might be one of the girls next door who contrasted with the femmes fatales, but she brings such luminosity to the role that there’s no dullnessPage 46 → to her, just naive goodness—French critics labeled her the white angel to Hawk’s black one. Indeed, that’s what attracts the world-weary hero to her, and what her desperate husband may or may not want to hold on to. For only male characters betray other people in Trouble in Mind.\n\nHawk’s status as the most fixed noir icon—in behavior, dialogue, look, and movement through the plot—holds him back. Though in the end he appears to leave Rain City, driving into the sunset no less, he’s no more successful at realizing his dreams or escaping from his failures than Coop. Regarding the finale, Rudolph recounts the dismay some people have expressed to him over Trouble in Mind’s unlikely, last-minute “boy gets girl” ending. “Could be either that,” deadpans Rudolph, “or he’s dead.” Literal readings get you nowhere in the cinematic worlds of Alan Rudolph, and Rain City’s harsh, cynical ecosystem—however comically and romantically rendered—is hardly going to serve up such a cliché. Or if it does, it will be trifled with. Again, as Rudoph states, “People hate it when I mess with their myths.”\n\nLike many a film noir—and like Rudolph’s Choose Me the year before—a watering hole or bar provides a gravitational center—think of Rick’s café in Casablanca as well as Eve’s in Choose Me. In Trouble in Mind, it is Wanda’s Café, less boozy than either, that serves as the place where characters cross paths, the only exception being Hilly Blue, whose own empire is sufficiently grand that he’s not obliged to leave it. Indeed, we see him outside it only in a Mob meeting at a Chinese restaurant and in a car, both moments in which he coldly asserts his authority over the other characters, notably Coop, Solo, and Hawk.\n\nPage 47 →By the 1970s and 1980s, the splintering of the myth of the intact, wholesome nuclear family may have been partly responsible for the glut of film and television shows in which bars, restaurants, and cafés supplanted the home as places where characters converged and seemed to forge their closest relationships and connections, as shown in American media such as Altman’s Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982), My Dinner with Andre (1981), Diner (1982), Mystic Pizza (1988), the Tom Cruise comedy Cocktail (1988), and the long-running TV sitcom Cheers (1982–93), in which the bar is a place of familiarity, “where everyone knows your name.” Less utopian versions that centered on this “third space” include Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and Barfly (1987) and the Miramax film that bucked an X rating, Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989). One can trace a discernible path since then through workplaces as the new featured setting—or at least subgenre—of film and TV fare, possibly as an indicator of the increasingly blurred lines between our ostensibly private lives and our lives as laborers.\n\nWanda’s Café fulfills the same function. Its details—like those of all of Rain City—suggest you are in the 1940s, while at the same time they don’t. The café is very much made on the model of an old American diner, with waitresses pouring coffee for the (primarily male) clientele seated at stools and at tables; swing music plays from an old radio. Wanda, however, who seems to transcend time and place, doesn’t wear the apparel of a noir film—that cross is given to Hawk to bear—and appears in somewhat nondescript dresses, with a few notable exceptions. An exterminator roams the café, periodicallyPage 48 → spraying invisible insects from a pump that seems right out of the 1940s or 1950s; his hair is up in a net, a comic but indecipherable figure who takes Keystone Cop pratfalls during the more chaotic scenes in the café.\n\nHawk\n\nTo cast Hawk, Rudolph said, he “needed a legend to play a legend. Ex-cop ex-con, trench coat, fedora, Garfield, Bogart. Kris was our only casting choice for Hawk.”10 Rudolph had been impressed by Kristofferson’s work in Songwriter and was delighted to work with him again. Thanks to Rudolph’s script and Kristofferson’s performance, Hawk expresses laconic authority at every turn. He is self-assured, fearless, with nothing he needs to prove, his only Achilles heel being weariness and, of course, women. It’s as if the star’s established western-rock image walked in as its film noir corollary. Indeed, costumer Tynan recounts that Kristofferson was reluctant to wear a dark 1940s-style wool suit for Trouble in Mind and insisted that the legs be cut tight so that he would be comfortable wearing something akin to the blue jeans he favored. Topped with a fedora, Hawk never changes his outfit and exudes “film noir leading man” even before walking out of jail—the legend Rudolph sought. In fact, the film’s opening, with its deep shadows and low-key lighting, followed by the soft lighting of the sepia-toned old train station and the old-city bus that Hawk takes to Wanda’s, suggests that he enters Rain City from an earlier time.\n\nTrouble in Mind repeatedly establishes the violence that Page 49 →Hawk is capable of and the violence of his past. He’d been imprisoned for killing a man to “protect” Wanda (shown in flashback late in the film); he has a punching bag in his room that he socks before his date with Georgia (with whom he is exceedingly gentle); effortlessly, he stops a man from going after Coop when the latter first enters town and mouths off, and moments later, he trips Coop in Wanda’s Café and will soon deck Coop in their altercation over Georgia. Before this, he responds to Coop’s dare-posed-as-question:\n\nCoop: “What’re you lookin’ at?”\n\nHawk: “I’m lookin’ at her,” pointing to Georgia.\n\nCoop: “She’s my woman.”\n\nHawk: “Don’t nothing surprise me anymore.”\n\nPage 50 →In addition to his contrast with Coop, Hawk provides a physical counterpart to Hilly. A fundamentally verbal creature who looks askance at everyone, Hilly has no need to prove his dominance through physical movement (think Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca [1940]), but spews mortally serious threats that a gaggle of henchmen are happy to carry out. All are (somewhat) alpha men, worlds apart from Coop, who, whether talking to Hilly, Solo, Hawk, Georgia, or Wanda, seems like a kid training to be a tough guy. Carradine deserved that Academy Award.\n\nRudolph’s commentary on all these tough guys is clear in his slapstick staging of the café brawl, just as he had shown in the brawl between two men who have bedded the same woman in Choose Me. They topple over each other as if they were the insects that the out-of-place exterminator seeks to annihilate. About the machismo, and in response to an interviewer’s claim that Harvey Keitel appeared “weak” in Welcome to L.A., Rudolph said, “If the men in Welcome to L.A. are blank,” he said, “it’s because they’re the ones closest to the machine, closest to the fire. They’re getting burned out quicker. And the women are trying to throw them lifelines. Mainly my men are considered weak because there’s no physical action.” With little physical action except for comically macho fight scenes, Trouble in Mind troubled that kind of claim. Women did less to throw physically violent men lifelines rather than try to stop them, as Wanda did, or run from them, like Georgia. (Significantly, neither woman attends Hilly Blue’s final “party”—it would have made no sense—but remains at the café as Coop and Hawk come straggling back after its destructive conclusion.)\n\nPage 51 →We see Hawk’s barely submerged violence in his relationships with women, especially when he forces himself on Wanda. (In Remember My Name, Geraldine Chaplin plays a woman newly released from prison who wants revenge; Kristofferson, by contrast, wants sex.) Both Hawk and Coop speak about women as possessions that can be obtained through contract. Coop turns to crime because Georgia “tells him to [provide for the family].” Hawk is particularly transactional in his approach, making a deal to help Georgia by retrieving Spike and then, after agreeing to get Coop out of trouble, extracting promises first for sex and then for ownership: “So, once I fix this up and send him on his way, you belong to me. Completely. You’ll live with me, and I’ll take care of you and the kid. . . . Otherwise, let him get what he deserves.”\n\nNot unlike his film noir clothing, these attitudes expressing old-school machismo create a certain discomfort, on at least this viewer’s part, watching the film thirty-five years later. That sense is enhanced in part by the age difference between Kristofferson, a weathered forty-nine at the time, and Singer, twenty-eight, performing as naive, young waif and “angel.” Interestingly, the director gifts the pair with tender hopes and romance—including a brief, discreet sex scene—although he mercilessly skewers a more extreme May-December romance. Nate Nathanson (John Considine) and Sonja (Antonia Dauphin, daughter of one of the Deauville Film Festival organizers) present a truly chilling couple: he a corrupt, wealthy man with connections to Hilly Blue, she a gift-happy child-bride celebrating her birthday. They’re the ones Coop and Solo try to rob, meeting them at the Space Needle restaurant and followingPage 52 → them to the couple’s mansion, where weapons are turned on the inept robbers. Nate and Sonja are nothing but cruel caricatures of greed. (Rudolph has argued that ambition is desire in the lifeworld of capitalism.) There’s a schism, then, between Rudolph’s affectionate treatment of Georgia and Hawk, despite their age difference, and of this very 1980s couple, who are so grotesque that it would surprise no one if they wore 101 Dalmatian skins, like Cruella de Vil. Does caricaturizing them let Georgia and Hawk’s unlikely coupling off the hook? Or does the latter pairing get us to reflect on the trope of doomed heterosexual couples in film noir?\n\nThe Model\n\nWe learn that, to pass the time in prison, Hawk has made an elaborate model of Rain City. Heather Ramsay, among the many Seattle-area artists whose work Rudolph used in the film, rendered the actual model—or sets of models to cover different areas of the city. Rudolph notes that the model is a “reflection of Hawk’s inner noir,” despite the fact that, rather than models, film noir more typically turns to the surface world of maps (again, think Casablanca). More generally, models in the cinema tend to serve either as three-dimensional blueprints of urban and other planning projects, or as retroactive, sometimes nostalgic miniatures of existing buildings and environs. Mainstream and indie films such as Wonderstruck (Haynes, 2017) and Undine (2020) use them in both of these ways— Trouble in Mind uses them primarily for nostalgic purposes. Sometimes models reinforce class and gender divides, Page 53 →with doll houses for girls and miniature train sets for boys. Others, such as those in Jia Zhangke’s The World (2004), articulate grander themes, such as labor in a thoroughly globalized world that takes shape in a Beijing theme park populated by small-scale versions of famous landmarks, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Eiffel Tower. In the work of directors such as Peter Greenaway, Jacques Rivette, and Alain Resnais, landscape itself can become an unmoving model, something Stanley Kubrick uses to chilling effect in the overhead shots of the maze at the end of The Shining (1980).\n\nFollow for extended description\n\nRamsay’s models of Rain City for Hawk are magnificently Page 54 →detailed. They include signs for buildings, streets, and facades and figures of people that were meaningful to Hawk: Wanda’s Café, the police station, the red-light district. The director’s stylistic sense is captured in the model’s miniaturized artifice: through artifice and detail, he says, truths can be conveyed. In Choose Me, style enabled the dreams and emotional states of his main characters to come to the surface—both acoustically and visually. In some ways here, the model seems a small-scaled version of Rudolph’s personal affection for Seattle and its cultural richness. Happily, some sets of the model still exist, with Wanda’s Café in the hands of producer David Blocker.\n\nIn this model, Hawk literally carries around his nostalgia for Rain City, for the past he might wish to regain or rewrite, and for the memories and feelings it contains, be it his protective love for Wanda or his resignation over having lost his police job for “protecting” her. Its significance—its literal and figurative weight—is signaled from the beginning of the film: in the first scene, the jail wardens ask Hawk whether he wants to have his model sent to him, likely because it is too much to carry as Hawk reenters nonincarcerated life. Had the model been more portable, its burden would be less obvious. As Hawk later unpacks it in his room at Wanda’s, the camera moves deep into it, letting us into Hawk’s mind to note the outsized place Rain City occupies within it. And while this obsession doesn’t serve the character well, it helps us see the authority that it has over him and, as we shall also see, that he exerts over it.\n\nThe model also provided what Rudolph called “establishing shots”Page 55 →itself, whose spaces the characters traverse, underscoring the importance of facades and veneers to the subjective realities and feelings they house. Thanks to its carefully positioned buildings and signs for “Police” and “Wanda’s Café,” the miniature model initiates a movement from the interior of Hawk’s mind onto the external noirish space of his postprison world. The establishing shots it yields provide a modest sense of the city’s spatial relations, and when they are mixed with establishing shots of actual locations and sets, the result is a doubly fictitious group of spaces with little geographical reliability. This combination, more than anything else, contributes to the film’s dreamlike style and subjective perspectives. What the model reveals with great clarity, however, is the fully enclosed nature of Rain City: it is a destination that trades in repetitions, failed dreams, and endings, granting new beginnings only in the form of departures and death. In this way, and despite the clarity of its details, the miniature Rain City gives out no plans, no future, and a nonbeating heart. Even its past is frozen in time, replete with a waitress holding a plate of food that will never be served. It will never be able to hand Hawk’s past back to Hawk or enable him to move forward.\n\nThe model also underscores the idea of replicability that Trouble in Mind takes up in other ways. Its characters (and the actors who depict them) reactivate famous noir actors and types, as Rudolph notes: Hawk was Bogart (or John Garfield or Ward Bond), Keith was Richard Widmark, with “Genevieve in the Claire Trevor role, Lori as a young Ida Lupino or Jane Greer. Joe Morton was Peter Lorre.” In that sense, the film is engaged in reconstruction as much as Hawk’s model: refashioningPage 56 → a gallant myth filled with familiar icons. Moreover, the cynical plots of Trouble in Mind and of film noir are almost as generic and interchangeable as their characters. (Years after making the film, Rudolph remarked at a retrospective of his work that Trouble in Mind was a movie about recycling). To be sure, the plot of Trouble in Mind lacks the utter indecipherability of Chandler and Hawks’s The Big Sleep (1946), but a recent comment made by the director reveals a similar perspective on storytelling: “A film is a living thing. Endings are constantly evolving. Written endings have a general destination but no specific map.”12\n\nMilica Topalovic argues that models question, not reaffirm, the reality of a place:\n\nWhen a space of a place seems to be doubled or multiplied, when a place thus comes to act for another place, the reality of both the original and replica loses credibility. . . . The space of a model always seems unreal. . . . a model always points beyond its specific geographic and temporal coordinates to a different space and a different time. In the space of a model, here becomes there, and now becomes then.13\n\nSuch temporal irregularity could not be truer than it is for Hawk, a character who seems to drop into this 1985 movie from the 1940s and who, within the film, fuses past and present enough that he believes that Wanda wants to rekindle their relationship and that he can regain his old job. The model’s ability to convey Hawk’s feelings about it is transparent, providing an object correlative of his desire and frustrated Page 57 →goals. It carries the weight of additional desires, such as those he holds for Georgia. “Ardor has a pull,” Rudolph would say of the “harmonious” tone and design of this film. Placed on a table in Hawk’s room, the model twinkles with Rain City’s dull but rainy beauty. Unlike the film’s other characters trapped in this reproducible world, Hawk, though confined as he’d been in jail, is, through the model, in a position to see it at a partial distance, from bird’s-eye view, external to it (in the words of the film’s final number, “El Gavilan / The Hawk,” with “freedom to fly”).\n\nThe Rain City miniature allows Hawk to view the small outside worlds from above, giving him a wider perspective than the other characters, particularly Coop, who, as his bird-name implies, is trapped in small spaces—trailers, hotel rooms for partying, private dining rooms, militia jeeps, even the Space Needle elevator—unable to find a way out. Coop’s interest lies in assessing the wacky nature of his unique “look,” over which he preens, but which leads Georgia to say, in the end, “I don’t know you, Coop.” Thanks to the model, Hawk’s gaze has power over others, particularly over Georgia, his chief object of prey. Wanda shares some of this all-seeing capacity, apportioned to her by her elevated apartment windows that look into the café. And whereas Wanda is a somewhat detached narrator/observer on her landing—she stays out of the fray—Hawk is continually jumping into it.\n\nSome artful editing conveys Hawk’s partial command over Rain City’s inhabitants—and to a certain extent, its space. The camera assumes his POV while looking over the model: a reverse shot points to him, as if the city were returning his Page 58 →gaze. Then, without cutting, the camera travels to take in the view of the city outside Hawk’s second- or third-story window, again adopting his POV while he overlooks Rain City, lowering his gaze to catch Coop and Georgia arguing. Coop storms off, spurring Hawk then to come downstairs to ask an angry, disinterested Georgia out to a nice restaurant. Later, though, he uses his crow’s-nest view to follow her (when he catches up to her and she asks why he followed her, he replies, “You looked like you needed following”). As a terrified Georgia runs through Rain City, alarmed for her child and frightened by her disintegrating marriage, Rudolph intercuts the alleys, streets, and buildings of Rain City’s / Seattle’s exterior spaces with shots of the model, mingling the two to nurture the sense that Rain City is a “world of the mind.”14 (Here its function in establishing shots also becomes clear, without recourse to Hawk’s POV.) Hawk might not be able to see or understand all that transpires in his frame of vision, much less control it, but his gaze enables him to roam across Rain City in a way that other characters cannot, and that authority is echoed in camera angles and in his positioning vis-à-vis other characters. When he needs a favor from Gunther, the police chief played by George Kirby, he looks down at the napping cop in a dark scene replete with cast shadows of venetian blinds; he towers over Wanda in their scenes together (Bujold is 5′4″ tall) and appears to loom over Coop as well, even though Carradine is taller by several inches."
