All of the people around the world who have been affected by the virus continue to be in our thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery.\n\nFor over 70 years, Gatorland has been dedicated to providing a safe, clean and welcoming theme park experience for our guests. We recognize the seriousness of currently evolving health-concerns, and are proactively taking all necessary actions to keep our park as clean, healthy, and safe as possible, so our visitors can get out, relax and enjoy Gatorland’s wide open spaces. We have meaningfully stepped up all of our cleaning and disinfection activities throughout the park, including the installation of additional alcohol-based hand sanitizer stations and additional hand washing stations.\n\nWe also recognize that this situation is fluid and evolving. We are monitoring daily updates and guidelines from the Florida Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We will smartly manage our park activities with an amplified sense of our obligation to do our very best to provide the safest possible environment in an inspiring natural open-air setting for you, your family, and friends.\n\nTo insure the wellbeing of our guests and employees, Gatorland has implemented the following additional precautionary measures to provide the highest standards of area sanitization and disinfection:\n\nHigher frequency cleaning and disinfection throughout the day, especially areas frequently touched by guests and employees\n\nProviding additional alcohol-based hand sanitizer stations throughout the park\n\nAdding additional hand washing stations\n\nSanitizing rides and zip line equipment between each guest\n\nDaily team member training of guidelines and updates to better serve guests\n\nQuick responses to any cleanliness or sanitation concerns\n\nDisinfecting all guest areas each night\n\nCurrently, Gatorland will remain open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. According to the Florida Department of Health, the risk to the public in Florida remains low. We will closely follow updates and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control, as well as our local and federal governments. We will adapt our operations and enhance our preventative measures to insure we do our part to protect our guests, employees, and community.\n\nMark McHugh\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nGatorland"
