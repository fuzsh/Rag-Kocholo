        "text": "Quantum random exploration can change reality as you know it. The superpower behind Randonautica gives you a random location to journey to. Set your intention in your mind for what you seek, you will find.\n\nReasons to use Randonautica to generate completely random coordinates for you to travel to:\n\n-To go on an unexpected adventure\n\n-To test out quantum entropy and the mind's ability to influence reality\n\n-To break the matrix\n\n-To get some exercise by walking to a random location\n\n-To open a real world portal\n\n-To get off screens and go on an outdoor adventure\n\n-To feel heightened awareness and observation\n\n-To feel being present\n\n-To find new areas in your neighborhood, town or city\n\n-To connect with other people of similar interests across the globe on Randonautica's in-app Social Media feed, Discover\n\nProven:\n\nGoing to a random location makes you hyperaware and present, often providing a sense of meditation or the feeling of being alive again. Random exploration adds novelty to life!\n\nTheoretical:\n\nBy interfacing with quantum entropy there is growing evidence that the mind, thoughts, emotions and words have an impact on matter. Using Randonautica creates a bridge to access a very malleable reality. Having an intense thought or \"intention\" while the generation process is happening can result in an effect in the real world as you journey to the random coordinates provided by the app. People have reported that there is a ripple effect where their intention has lasting effect on their personal reality and observation.-To defeat feeling \"stuck\" in the day-to-day\n\nRandonautica is the first ever quantumly generated adventure game that takes you on a journey of true randomness. The adventure is yours to have and the legend will be yours to tell. Welcome, future Randonauts!\n\nThe app uses both pseudo and quantum entropy sources for randomization which provides a set of coordinates that can be opened in a map to navigate to or the user can digitally explore the coordinates. While âBlind Spotsâ are random points meant to be visited for exploring the unknown world around you, choosing an âAnomalyâ type coordinate will run an algorithm over your radius to find the most statistically improbable distribution of random points within your radius. These are destinations where the real magic happens.\n\nExplore the world beyond the habitual and deterministic patterns of your everyday life, discover adventures right in front of your doorstep.\n\nEye luv InstaGram ,\n\nONLY 2 BECAUSE CREEPY\n\nMe and my friend weâre having a sleepover and we walk to the gas station to get some snacks for our movie. on the way there we saw these two cats that looked worried and i kept stopping me and my friend to go look at them. itâs like something was telling me to stay and watch the cats. but we kept walking after a while, made it to the gas station. and on our way back I just suddenly thought of the app randonoutica and my last experience using it. so I told my friend and we were getting creeped out. then when we got home we got the app and started using it this is when it got creepy. then the first time we used it it brought us to one of my sisters friends house. so we were freaking out but we use it again because it was cool. and we didnât think that it was anything at the time. then we used it the second time. it brought us right to the house where the cats were right where we were at. so we didnât want to go back to it even though it brought us to that because we were creeped out. then we were freaking out and kept using it but we didnât go to the location. we did it two more times and it brought me to my friends street right at her house. then we did it for the last time and it brought us to our school and my friendâs girlfriendâs house. DONT use this app for a joke\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHello! It sounds like the app showed you personally significant locations, which is exactly what it's supposed to do!"
