        "text": "The Terrifying Next Chapter\n\nDark Nights™ at Hersheypark Halloween™ returns Friday, September 13 with more haunting dates than ever before. For 25 days, including Halloween night, darkness will fall from coaster to coaster. All-new terrors will be introduced, and never-before-seen characters will find you whether you're ready or not. Beware, the creatures you know have scattered, multiplied, and taken over. Remember, the only thing more terrifying than the dark, is what lurks within.\n\nAll-New! Estate of Evil\n\nA charming new brownstone has officially hit the market. Wander through the 13 rooms of this spacious mansion and prepare to be captivated by the meticulous care the live-in waitstaff has taken to preserve the past. While exploring, envision yourself tending to the enchanting garden, entertaining inside the lively game room, and raising a glass inside the private wine cellar. But, be vigilant, or suffer the same fate as the previous owners.\n\nstipendium peccati mors est\n\nAuntie Mortem’s Abattoir\n\nStep into the back office where the secrets of the Mortem family's trade are kept hidden in plain sight. Uncover the devious tactics her nephews use to keep the business in the red, but beware—you just might meet Auntie Mortem in the flesh.\n\nFallout Zone\n\nRogue radioactive material has begun to emit an eerie green fog. Crews are scrubbing the midway to isolate, contain, and neutralize any threats. You may avoid the fallout but can you escape the madness from those within?\n\nMidway of Misery\n\nMisery loves company...The Decayed Brigade will welcome new sliders from the underworld and now have more corners to lurk in and ground to cover. Beware, for those who flock to the flames you never know who (or what) is waiting beyond the arch.\n\nDarkstone’s Hollow\n\nOusted from his own show, Darkstone is now caged for all to see, while the showmen that hawked his traveling mythical collection now frantically seek shelter from the creatures that have claimed the hollow as their own."
