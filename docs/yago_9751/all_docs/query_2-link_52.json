        "meta_description": "Hollywood, where dreams collide with harsh, sometimes deadly, realities. But crime in LA is unlike crime anywhere else in the world. It is often dramatic and sensational, with an element of celebrity and glamour that you won’t find in a small town murder mystery. These tragic true crime stories are ripped from actual headlines, but often play out like a Hollywood script. \r\nFrom the creators of Up and Vanished, this is ‘To Live and Die in L.A.’",

        "text": "Our debut season takes a deep dive into the mysterious disappearance of 25-year-old Adea Shabani, an aspiring actress and model who vanished without a trace from her apartment complex near Hollywood’s famous Walk of Fame. Last seen in February of 2018, Shabani is a native of Macedonia. Like the thousands who flock to Los Angeles each year, she hoped to realize her Hollywood dream of stardom. What really happened to Adea? The full story has never been told.\n\nIn Feb 2018, an aspiring actress vanished from her Hollywood apartment. Rolling Stone journalist Neil Strauss was asked to help the family get answers. Together, they found them…sometimes at great personal risk. Now the award-winning true crime podcast returns, unraveling the baffling and tragic case that started Neil Strauss down the rabbit hole of true crime investigation, along with his wife and his neighbors, Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger, and concert violinist Ann Marie Simpson. To Live and Die in LA Season 2 is available now with new episodes every thursday.\n\nNeil Strauss is a ten-time New York Times best-selling author, award-winning writer for Rolling Stone, and former reporter at the New York Times. Strauss has also contributed to Esquire, Salon, Spin, Entertainment Weekly, Details, The Source, New York Newsday, and many other magazines and newspapers. He has interviewed some of the biggest icons in the world of entertainment and beyond, including the legendary Chuck Berry, Tom Cruise, Madonna, and Elon Musk. He received The President’s Volunteer Service Award for work during his book Emergency.\n\nFounded by Atlanta director and independent filmmaker, Payne Lindsey, and music industry veteran, Donald Albright, Tenderfoot TV is a hub for content creators and storytellers. The company launched in August 2016 with the release of the viral true crime podcast Up and Vanished and has since created projects that include the number one hits podcasts, Atlanta Monster and Culpable, as well as Radio Rental hosted by Rainn Wilson from NBC’s The Office. Together the Tenderfoot slate of podcasts have amassed over 500 million downloads in total.\n\nTenderfoot strives to tell compelling stories that forge a deeper level of connection and engagement with the audience. No rules. No restrictions."
