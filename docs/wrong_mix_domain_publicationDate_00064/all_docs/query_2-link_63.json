In particular, it marks the anniversaries of the founding of Clarkesworld and the heart attack that almost killed me three years ago. Both of those events occured at Readercon (readercon.org), which I’m returning to again this month. With the exception of the heart attack year, I always have a good time there and, as usual, I’ll be set up in the dealer’s room firesaling my long-closed bookstore’s inventory and promotion my magazines. I’ll also be participating in two panels: The Future of Speculative Fiction Magazines and Insider Tips and Tough Truths of the Publishing Business. If any of you will be in the Burlington, MA area July 9-12, you should definitely check it out. Either way, I hope to recap some of what was said in next month’s editorial.\n\nWe’re now six months into Forever and I’m mapping out the next six. I’ve resigned Ron Guyatt (www.ronguyatt.com) for the next six covers and have just started another fiction buying spree. At this point, I’d love to hear from some of you. The feedback would be very useful as I continue to map out the future course of this magazine. Feel free to say hi at Readercon or drop me an email at neil@clarkesworldmagazine.com. You can also make fiction suggestions over at the Forever Magazine website (forever-magazine.com).\n\nAs always, thanks for reading! If you enjoy the issue, please tell a friend! Until next month . . .\n\n-Neil\n\nFeral Moon\n\nAlexander Jablokov\n\nThe corpses fell from interior of the moon like drops of water from an icicle. The body repatriation team that hung in the open space just outside the blast crater maneuvered back and forth and caught them in a grid of storage modules, one by one. Behind them, the stars moved slowly past.\n\nTo Kingsman, the module grid looked disturbingly like an ice cube tray. The repat team filled it in strict order, from one end to the other, then sealed and marked each module.\n\nOne body brushed against a twisted length of structural beam and spun slightly as it came down, making the team scramble. If they missed it, the body would float out of the crater and into open space, requiring an embarrassing, and expensive, recovery effort.\n\nPreceptor Dakila Uy muttered in exasperation. Clumsy. Looks like crap.\n\nKingsman thought that was a beamed signal, for him alone, but maybe a member of Uy’s staff was noting it down, for later discipline. They were all hidden somewhere, out of Kingsman’s sight, leaving only Kingsman and Uy on the shelf in the crater torn out of the side of Phobos. From the look of the stretch of tile still left on the wall nearby, it had probably once been part of someone’s bathroom.\n\nThe team caught the body and flipped it into its module. These were the bodies of enemy combatants, of course. Defenders of Phobos. Their faces were displayed on the black shrinkwrap that protected the bodies. These were mostly file photos from their dogchips, sometimes cleaned up and reprocessed versions of the dead faces beneath, when no file could be found. Other identifying information appeared on their chests. Kingsman hadn’t been issued the proper codes, so they appeared to him as generic scribbles.\n\nThe lack of code access was just another annoyance for Kingsman to work through. More serious was the three days he had been stranded in orbit, within sight of Phobos but without access. The official story had been safety concerns.\n\nKingsman had a specific sort of power. Strictly speaking, he could only exercise it once. After that, he would be a hollow shell, without power to further influence events. He would need to use the weight of his single authority to gain cooperation in other areas. It was going to be a delicate game.\n\nTechnically, you outrank me, Uy said.\n\nI suppose all ranks are merely ‘technical’, Preceptor. Kingsman had expected his encounter with Uy to start with a fight. He supposed he should be glad it was over something so petty. I have the same rank as you, with three years’ seniority. But I’m not here to—\n\nThat’s ridiculous. What, they count time in prison as ‘seniority’? You lost all right to anything like that when you were convicted and sentenced.\n\nI don’t want to argue about legal details. That’s not my area of expertise. Yours either, I suspect. My seniority might come into play if we’re fighting for spots on a ceremonial dais. Otherwise, it’s pretty much meaningless. I have no rights of command here. I do have the right to demand treatment appropriate to my rank and role. Which does not include being left in the hull of transport vessel for three days after my mission has already started.\n\nOh, Uy said. My apologies. We were preparing for a major push. Working every minute, preparing. You remember how that is, don’t you, Tony? Combat? Everything else takes second place. Everything else is pretty much irrelevant.\n\nThe body modules were sealed and marked for chain of custody. Eventually, they would be returned to their families. Some diplomatic relations were still maintained with forces deeper within Phobos, though the political structure had fragmented, and it was sometimes unclear as to the authority of the counterparties.\n\nThis crater had been blown out of the side of Phobos during the surprise attack by the Alliance ship. It widened out beneath Uy and Kingsman’s feet, dangling lengths of pipe, shattered transport corridor, and strips of the reinforcing rings that kept the welded-together outer layer of the moon’s regolith stable. Phobos’ rotation was slow, creating just enough gravity for orientation. Every few minutes, the vast face of Mars would scrape past, filling virtually their entire field of view.\n\nNo one in the busy crater paid attention to it, any more than they paid attention to parade of enemy bodies. Instead, Kingsman felt himself the focus of interest from everyone working in the busy crater space, which was the ingress point for supplies to the Alliance forces fighting to conquer the moon. Some things could not be kept secret, and who he was was one of them.\n\nAre you at liberty to reveal the results of your push? Kingsman said.\n\nIt fully achieved its tactical objectives. Two more levels taken, and a significant pumping node. The Phobs can fight, but they’re doomed. There is no reason for your mission here . . . Preceptor.\n\nKingsman had expected a desperate effort preceding his arrival. If a rapid success could be achieved, Kingsman’s mission might become irrelevant. Uy was showing off its fruits now: a parade of enemy dead. Alliance corpses would be moved more discreetly, with dark ceremonial. Three dead, five wounded, two seriously enough to be rotated out. They hadn’t been able to hide that from him. A reasonable cost, if you had a good basis for your mission.\n\nUnsupported hope was not a good basis for anything, least of all military operations. Kingsman was more relevant than ever.\n\nAnthony Kingsman was a tall man with big joints pushing out against his skin, and he knew that his spacesuit emphasized his boiled-and-mounted appearance. He wore his graying hair long, pulled back from his high forehead and tied back in a queue. Both the receding hairline and the gray hair were signs of his time in the prison asteroid, where aesthetic treatments weren’t part of the routine.\n\nDakila Uy was shorter and stockier, with dark skin and black hair he brushed straight up. He’d even made that hair an element of how his suit displayed him. He had a practiced way of staying absolutely still, as if he was the center around which all else revolved. He was the commander of a five-thousand-troop invading force, a challenging role at this point in a long war, and one that he had to play without a break. He did his best.\n\nKingsman knew Uy of old, from before his own disgrace, even from before the Rim War had become the disaster it now was. Uy was both brave and smart. More importantly, he was increasingly listened to in higher political circles. So he had maneuvered himself into command of the Phobos Expedition. Victory there would secure his reputation.\n\nBut some operations required more than bravery and intelligence. They needed a level of understanding beyond rationality. They needed a kind of twisted genius. They needed what looked a lot like luck. Instead of an easy victory, Phobos had turned out to be a desperate vortex that sucked down soldiers, resources . . . and reputations.\n\nSurely Uy had to see that Kingsman was the only way he could salvage his.\n\nI’ll need access to all of your tactical records, Kingsman said. All pre-op intel as well.\n\nUy snorted. You can’t possibly live long enough to get through all that.\n\nI’ll skim.\n\nThat’s more than I can give you, Uy said. At least for an operation that’s still forging toward victory. But I have something better. I’ve assigned a unit commander to put you in touch with what’s going on, right at the face. Full access, Tony. Just like you like. I think you’ll understand things a bit better once you’ve actually seen it. It’ll do you good to get back in combat. Though you probably got more than your share of action in the prison hulk. I hear the place wasn’t well managed for a while.\n\nKingsman had seen more than he would ever want to share with anyone. Least of all Uy. I could cancel this operation right now. You know that.\n\nUy was silent for a long moment. You could. But would it stick? Not with the troops, I can tell you that. And not with your controllers, either. They need you to at least give the appearance of looking things over. All you’d get from a snap recommendation is chaos. Lessened effectiveness. Defeat. Is that really how you want to play it?\n\nThe hell of it was, Uy was right. An order to pull out that could be argued with was worse than no order at all. In addition, Uy knew Kingsman of old too. He knew Kingsman would compel himself to understand everything he could before making a decision. He knew he had a handle on Kingsman’s pride.\n\nIt was hard to bluff when you hadn’t been dealt any cards yet.\n\nShe’s my best commander, Tony, Uy said. You’ll be in good hands.\n\nA figure detached itself from some overhead strutwork and dropped slowly down. For a moment, it looked to Kingsman like she would miss. But he had misgauged the Coriolis curve. While the path was straight with reference to the stars, the rotation of the moon made it seem curved relative to where they stood. The officer landed on the ledge next to Kingsman. He saw dark eyes, cheeks with decorative metal implants.\n\nPreceptor Anthony Kingsman, Uy said, with forced heartiness. Sub-Commander Leila Ferhat. SC Ferhat will serve as your guide to the Phobos Expedition.\n\nThe last of the Phob bodies floated past and was packaged up. Kingsman noted that Ferhat kept her eyes averted. She hated this corpse parade. That would have been a possible way to bond with her, if hadn’t been for the fact that she clearly hated Kingsman even more.\n\nFerhat didn’t talk to him. Instead, she shot him a set of instructional and safety icons: click into the air supply on this reaction sled, make sure the partial pressure of oxygen is between these two bars, at least two of these five points must be secure for you to be considered attached to the sled,"
