As per usual, the con is taking place at the Boston Quincy Marriott in Quincy, MA, from July 11 – 14, with Guests of Honor Rebecca Roanhorse and Amal El-Mohtar. If you have any interest in the practical craft of writing or the current issues on the minds of genre publishing professionals, I absolutely recommend registering and attending if you can. Previous years’ schedules can be seen (and drooled over) here: https://readercon.org/readercon_past\n\nAmong many other exciting things, for the first time in over a decade (at least) all four Siblings of No Story Is Sacred will be attending a con together, so the odds of us recording a podcast– or prowling the halls like a feral pack of hyenas with too many in-jokes– is VERY HIGH.\n\nI also have a reading! And since my erstwhile sister Pippin (who is secretly the Other Half of nearly all humorous dialogue I write) will be around, she’s going to hop on and read with me. I know for a fact that we’ll be reading “They’re Made Out of Corn,” but one or two others will probably be under consideration until the very last moment.\n\nA lot of interesting things on my schedule this year, including several Funny Ones and one that I’m pretty sure I’m on because of my mad scientist forays into experimental archaeology— check it out:\n\nAI: The Good Parts Version\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 3\n\n12 July 2024, Friday 11:00 AM EST\n\nThe rollout of, and hype around, generative AI has been a mess, but the technology can have its uses. Panelists will discuss some of the ways they’re using GenAI in their personal and creative lives, talk about ways that creatives should be protecting and redefining their IP, and note what work needs to be done on a governmental level—for instance, defining actors’ voices as copyrightable IP.\n\nDavid G. Shaw, Katherine Crighton, Kevin McLaughlin, Wendy Van Camp, Sarah Smith (mod)\n\nI Don’t Know Why I’m on This Panel!\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 3\n\n12 July 2024, Friday 4:00 PM EST\n\nIn this new take on those dreaded words, all the panelists on this panel have been selected for reasons unknown to them. Will they discover what they have in common? Will they take turns ranting about subjects the others have never even considered? Will they have taken what little advance notice they received to prepare a group song-and-dance number? There’s only one way to find out!\n\nNatalie Luhrs, Scott Edelman, Zin E. Rocklyn, William Alexander, Katherine Crighton (mod)\n\nWhat to Do with Your 15 Minutes of Fame\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 4\n\n12 July 2024, Friday 6:00 PM EST\n\nSo a tweet about your book has gone unexpectedly viral (cough This is How You Lose the Time War cough) or your book’s been featured on a popular TikTok, or in the New York Times Book Review—now what? Panelists will share stories of their own 15 minutes of fame, and discuss how they rode the wave (or didn’t!) and which choices, in retrospect, were right for them.\n\nMelissa Caruso, P. Djèlí Clark, Sarena Straus, Katherine Crighton (mod)\n\nMeet the Pros(e)\n\nFormat: Event | Salon 3\n\n12 July 2024, Friday 10:15 PM EST\n\nAt the Friday night Meet the Pros(e) party, program participants are assigned to tables with a roughly equal number of conferencegoers and other participants, and then table placements are scrambled at regular intervals so that everyone gets to meet a new set of people in a small-group setting. Think of it as a low-key sort of speed dating where you need never be the sole focus of anyone’s attention, and the goal is just to get to know some cool Readerconnish people.\n\nArcheology in Reality and Speculative Fiction\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon B\n\n13 July 2024, Saturday 11:00 AM EST\n\nArcheology is the study of human cultures through their material remains. Panelists will examine archeology’s past flaws, current practice, and future potential, and suggest ways that the field can inform speculative fiction, including what archeology tells us about the range of human cultures and how an archeological mindset can strengthen worldbuilding.\n\nJeff Hecht, Katherine Crighton, Kathryn Morrow, Victoria Janssen, Alexander Jablokov (mod)\n\nReading: Katherine Crighton (AND SECRETLY ALSO PIPPIN MACDONALD)\n\nFormat: Reading | Salon C\n\n13 July 2024, Saturday 8:00 PM EST\n\nBattle of the Academy\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 4\n\n14 July 2024, Sunday 2:00 PM EST\n\nBesides the obvious cosplay connections (flowing robes! Funny hats!), academia and fandom both prize the ability of participants to expostulate upon a variety of topics, often impromptu and orally. Watch our panelists defend academic theses they’ve picked out of a hat (“The Reification of Martyrdom in [Pokemon]” “Confronting Bias through Teaching the Works of [Hayao Miyazaki]”) while offering learned critiques of each others’ attempts.\n\nAndrea Kriz, Benjamin Rosenbaum, Tom Greene, Trisha J Wooldridge, Katherine Crighton (mod)\n\n(Image credit: Image by Siala from Pixabay)\n\nVideo from Boston Post Mortem!\n\nIf you missed the Boston Post Mortem panel about the Memoirscape project I’ve been a part of–SURPRISE AGAIN, THERE’S A VIDEO.\n\nAgain, here’s the official blurb:\n\nAfter a successful run of their Fall 2023 escape room Home for the Holidays, Interactive Media and Game Development graduate students at WPI decided to completely revise their escape room into a cozier interactive experience, giving players timed-entry tickets but unlimited time once inside, three rooms, several actors written as NPCs, and five potential endings. On this panel, five core members of the design team will discuss the process of designing and redesigning the physical interactive experience that became Memoirscape.\n\nUpcoming appearance: Boston Post Mortem panel “Designing a Cozy Escape Room: The Memoirscape Project at WPI”\n\nSurprise! I have yet more things happening with this Mysterious MFA I’m pursuing– and this is one of them.\n\nTonight at 7 PM (and online, for free), join me and four other core designers of an immersive, interactive, narrative experience called Memoirscape talk about how it came about, what challenges we faced, what fascinating results have come from it (SO FAR), and what the future holds for running it again in the future– particularly after a 10-day public run, a first-ever remote playthrough via players from The Cryptid Factor podcast’s Patreon, and culminating in its incredibly successful appearance at the Foundations of Digital Games 2024 conference last week.\n\n(I HAVE BEEN A VERY BUSY BEE.)\n\nHere’s the official blurb:\n\nAfter a successful run of their Fall 2023 escape room Home for the Holidays, Interactive Media and Game Development graduate students at WPI decided to completely revise their escape room into a cozier interactive experience, giving players timed-entry tickets but unlimited time once inside, three rooms, several actors written as NPCs, and five potential endings. On this panel, five core members of the design team will discuss the process of designing and redesigning the physical interactive experience that became Memoirscape.\n\nDrop in and listen to us all burble with Boston Post Mortem, the Boston chapter of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), by signing up to attend through their Meetup link here: https://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev/events/300996689/\n\nUpcoming appearance: Fan Studies Network North America 2023\n\nSomething different for me: I’ve coauthored a poster/presentation (“Faking and Re-Making: The Use of Emotional Responses and Creative Resonances in Communal Multimedia Storytelling”) with Dr. Naomi Jacobs and Shivhan Szabo that’ll be presented tomorrow, October 15, at Fan Studies Network North America 2023!\n\nIt’s connected to my overall recent move toward academic pursuits (that I should, uh, really write a post about…), but a big reason to drop in to this virtual conference if you have the chance is that our “poster” was invited to be multimedia… so, naturally, we decided to write a text game:\n\nFolks who attend the conference will have first shot at reading/playing “Building the Spear,” where:\n\nThe year is 1718…\n\n…And this is the world of Blow the Man Down, where clever pirate captains Olivier Levasseur and Sam Bellamy, each pursuing the same vast treasure of Spanish gold, meet up and—through storms, enemy fleets, and their combined delight in codes and hidden messages—eventually fall in love.\n\nYou, though, are just a simple pirate who’s woken up in a strange place—and with no idea who you are or how you got there. Through your choices, you piece together your memories…and create your own place within the BTMD universe.\n\n(For those who listen to the No Story Is Sacred podcast, we talked extensively about Blow the Man Down there as well, including its origin as an element in an alternate-universe game.)\n\nNaomi, Shivhan, and I intend to link the game-poster and presentation publicly afterward, but if you want to see yours truly live (and have a chance to share your game results early) FSNNA 2023 is the way to go.\n\n(Image credit: Image by Fan Studies Network North America)\n\nUpcoming appearance: Readercon (updated)!\n\nMy schedule for Readercon 32 is ready to go! As mentioned in an earlier post, it’s taking place July 13 – 16 at the Boston Quincy Marriott in Quincy, MA, with Guests of Honor Jeff VanderMeer and Justina Ireland. I absolutely recommend registering and attending if you can. Previous years’ schedules can be seen (and drooled over) here: https://readercon.org/readercon_past\n\nI also have my first ever Kaffeeklatsch! “A kaffeeklatsch is a low-key, wide-ranging conversation hosted by one or two program participants for up to 12 fans. It gives you an opportunity to interact directly with writers, editors, and other estimable personages you admire. Spaces are limited, so sign up early in the weekend.” God only knows what I’d talk about, but pretty certain I’m gonna be weird about it! 👍👍\n\nI am over the moon about my schedule — check it out:\n\nHow Can Short Story Authors Build an Audience?\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 4\n\n14 July 2023, Friday 3:00 PM EST\n\nShort stories today are published across a wide variety of media, formats, and imprints. As a result, writers specializing in short stories have difficulty connecting with and building an audience over time. How can you find the people who enjoy your work, and how can they find you in a cost-effective way? We will discuss short story collections, social media, conventions, and other ways of finding and keeping in touch with our favorite short fiction writers.\n\nArley Sorg, Christopher Mark Rose, Katherine Crighton, Scott Edelman, F. Brett Cox (mod)\n\nExcavating the Slush Pile\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon B\n\n15 July 2023, Saturday 1:00 PM EST\n\nMany small press and magazine publishers rely on volunteer “slush” readers for the first review of submissions. What are best practices for slush reading, and what issues and challenges face these volunteer readers? Do “blind” submissions policies help or hinder the #OwnVoices movement? How do slush readers handle controversial or triggering content without excluding marginalized voices? Must a story be appealing to the slush reader in order to earn a second set of eyes, or merely engaging?\n\nAlex Shvartsman, Katherine Crighton, Leon Perniciaro, Neil Clarke, Scott H. Andrews (mod)\n\nCareer Promotion for Pseudonymous Writers\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon B\n\n15 July 2023,Saturday 9:00 PM EST\n\nSome writers use pseudonyms to keep their private and public lives separate. Others use them to differentiate their works in different genres. All professional writers need to bring their works to the attention of readers, but how should one go about doing that when one can’t, or doesn’t want to, pin it to one’s established name? A conversation with Elaine Isaak (E.C. Ambrose) and Katherine Crighton.\n\nElaine Isaak and Katherine Crighton\n\nSpace: The Ultimate Locked Room\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 3\n\n16 July 2023, Sunday 10:00 AM EST\n\nAdd “…but in space” to “locked room mystery” and you make the stakes even higher. From Tade Thompson’s Far From the Light of Heaven to Mur Lafferty’s Station Eternity to Mary Robinette Kowal’s The Spare Man, contemporary authors embrace and explore this collision of tropes, but what are the thematic implications?\n\nElizabeth Bear, Robert Killheffer, Sarah Pinsker, Shweta Adhyam, Katherine Crighton (mod)\n\nKaffeeklatsch: Katherine Crighton\n\nFormat: Kaffeeklatsch | Concierge Lounge\n\n16 July 2023, Sunday 12:00 PM EST\n\nSerial Fiction: Everything Old Is New Again\n\nFormat: Panel | Salon 3\n\n16 July 2023, Sunday 2:00 PM EST\n\nPresent-day serialized fiction can be found as webnovels in China and on English-language sites like Royal Road; on platforms like Patreon, WattPad, and Inkitt; and as sequential art designed for mobile apps like Webtoon—among many others. Meanwhile, classic fiction is finding new readers through email newsletters like Dracula Daily. What opportunities does the serialized format offer authors and readers? And how has the proliferation of platforms affected authors, readers, and their communities?\n\nKatherine Crighton, Sarah Smith, Kat Nepveu (mod)\n\n(Image credit: Image by 愚木混株 Cdd20 from Pixabay)\n\nUpcoming (and, whoops, prior) appearances: SFWA Nebula Conference and Readercon\n\nSo in keeping to true ridiculous form, I have both a conference I will be at and one I was just at. Let’s get the old one out of the way first–\n\nSFWA‘s 2023 Nebula Conference Online was a hybrid event held in Anaheim, CA, and over Zoom, which is fortunate because I? Am not in Anaheim. The majority (or possibly all?) of the panels were recorded; you can still register and get access to them until they’re removed for next year’s conference. I only appeared on one panel, but I’m proud as hell about it:\n\nNeurodiversity and Writing: There’s No One Correct Way to Write Format: Panel (Virtual)\n\n13 May 2023, Saturday 6:00 PM PST\n\nNeurodiverse authors have always been around. However, some of the most famous writing advice out there — such as put your butt in a chair and write, or write 1000 words a day — can actually be harmful to or counterproductive for neurodiverse writers. In this panel, a group of neurodiverse authors will share writing advice that works for them and may also work for other writers who are autistic, have ADHD, anxiety, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, or other diverse ways of experiencing the world.\n\nVida Cruz-Borja, Maria S. Picone, Clara Ward, Katherine Crighton, Jason Sanford (mod)\n\n…and upcoming, I have:\n\nReadercon is an old favorite and always deeply insightful and interesting– it’ll be taking place July 13 – 16 at the Boston Quincy Marriott in Quincy, MA, with Guests of Honor Jeff VanderMeer and Justina Ireland. I don’t have my schedule yet — KEEP AN EYE OUT for an update on that — but I absolutely recommend registering and attending if you can. Previous years’ schedules can be seen (and drooled over) here: https://readercon.org/readercon_past\n\n(Post banner image credit: Sakari Niittymaa from Pixabay. Nebula Conference image credit: “Nebula Star Deity” by Lauren Raye Snow.)\n\nUpcoming appearance: Apex Magazine’s “Happy Hour” livestream\n\nSo remember “DEMON FIGHTER SUCKS,” my fantasy-horror short story set during a livestream?\n\nWELL OH DANG:\n\nIn celebration of the Apex Magazine 2021 limited edition anthology — coming out December 20th with all new afterwards for each story — come listen to chief editors Jason Sizemore and Lesley Conner talk to me and my fellow authors Carson Winter (“In Haskins”) and Lavanya Lakshminarayan (“Samsāra in a Teacup”).\n\nWe’ll be talking about writing, publishing, our anthology stories, and who knows what else during Apex’s regular Happy Hour livestream event on Tuesday, December 13th, at 8 PM EST. We’ll also be fielding questions that viewers leave in the livestream chat, so I definitely do not encourage you to ask about what is or isn’t a good idea to summon using public-domain magic during the course of, say, a livestream. NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO BE FOUND HERE.\n\nSo once more with feeling:\n\nWhat: Happy Hour livestream event: Apex Magazine 2021\n\nWhen: Tuesday, December 13th, 8 PM EST\n\nWhere: Apex Magazine‘s YouTube\n\nReading: “Your Hand in Mine, We’ll Be All Right”\n\nBack in October of 2021, I recorded a performance of my 2014 flash horror story “Your Hand in Mine, We’ll Be All Right” for Flash Fiction Online — it’s only recently that I remembered that I didn’t actually announce it on my own dang site. As we head into spooky season, though, I thought I’d toss up a link– enjoy!\n\n(Some handy trigger warnings: body horror, self-harm, mutilation, fetal distress, and my questionable acting ability.)\n\nSpring 2022 Class: “Writing Short Fiction”\n\nI’m stretching my wings, folks, and taking 20+ years of experience writing, editing, and publishing — not to mention three-odd years’ worth of podcast hosting — to the classroom. This spring I’ll be teaching a practical, nuts-and-bolts approach to writing short fiction at Assabet After Dark, the largest adult continuing education program in metrowest Massachusetts.\n\nFrom the catalogue:\n\nWriting Short Fiction\n\nShort fiction is an easy medium to attempt, a difficult one to master. We will focus on a practical, nuts-and-bolts approach to writing short fiction in multiple genres. You will discover different narrative techniques, tips for effective dialogue, plotting a short story versus plotting a novel, and how to submit your work and where. You will workshop your story one-on-one with the instructor, with the goal of having a completed, ready-to-submit short story by the end of the course.\n\nAssabet After Dark Spring 2022 catalogue\n\nIt’s six classes, one a week in 2-hour blocks every Tuesday from March 8 to April 12. The only cost is the course fee, which I haggled down to $85 to keep the cost of entry low for those who might otherwise not be able to afford writing classes. Representative demos of my approach to writing (both the art and the commerce thereof) can be found on my blog post about How to Sell Your Fiction, my appearances at conferences, or my co-hosting gig on the No Story Is Sacred podcast.\n\nBut! I recognize that not everybody is in or around Massachusetts, or would feel comfortable with in-person teaching right now. (VERY fair.) So here’s the skinny — I’m offering two options to people who want to be part of this, regardless of where you are in the world.\n\nOption 1 – In Person: This is an open class (though spaces are limited — ETA 2/11/22: And is now using a waitlist!). If you’re in Massachusetts and want to make the drive, you can register to attend the “live” course, whether that ends up being in person or over Zoom. Registering for the in-person course gets you access to:\n\n12 hours of dedicated live teaching\n\nOne-on-one short-story workshopping and support with me\n\nA course site with resources and copies of the presentations for later review\n\nAccess to a dedicated Discord server to talk over assignments, ping me and others for help, and generally build a writing community for those who may not have had one previously\n\nOption 2 – Online-Only: For those who still want to be part of a community and learn along with others in an online setting, I’m creating a special role in this class’s Discord server called “Virtual Student”. You’d be locked out of the in-person class channels, but everything else will be open for you, including:\n\nSingle-shot talks\n\nWorkshop-versions of future classes\n\nCrowd-sourced resources, open submission calls, and general support\n\nAnd that’s it! This is a new direction for me, but one I’m very excited about.\n\nETA: 12/6/22: Online-only server access closed for now! Check in again in the spring of 2023 for another opening~\n\nHave an idea for classes or talks you’d like to see, or other topics you’d like me to address? Drop me a line and I’ll add it to the list!\n\n(Image credit: Image by StartupStockPhotos from Pixabay)"
