The primary focus of the con is literary science fiction, but we also pay attention to art, media sf, and gaming. Every year dozens of professional writers, artists and editors attend the convention. Sometimes they come to make deals but more often they come to have fun.\n\nWho runs ArmadilloCon?\n\nArmadilloCon is sponsored by The Fandom Association of Central Texas, Inc. (FACT), a nonprofit literary organization based in Austin. Each of ArmadilloCon's chairs or co-chairs is required to be a member of FACT. Many of the other people who work on the convention are members of FACT, but that is not a requirement. Most of the convention workers live in the greater Austin area, but there are also several workers from San Antonio, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso, and sometimes even from out of state.\n\nIs ArmadilloCon a \"for-profit\" convention?\n\nNo. When an ArmadilloCon takes in more money than it cost to run the convention, this money is put into a fund to run future ArmadilloCons. No individual or organization gains material benefit from ArmadilloCon.\n\nAttending ArmadilloCon\n\nDo I need to join FACT to attend ArmadilloCon?\n\nNo.\n\nDo I have to be pregistered to attend ArmadilloCon?\n\nNo. Memberships may be purchased at the door, although the cost is higher.\n\nMay I buy a 1-day or 2-day membership at the door?\n\nCertainly. See our membership information page for prices.\n\nMaybe I preregister for a 1-day or 2-day membership?\n\nNo. Only full-con memberships are available in advance. The advance cost of a 3-day membership is less than the cost of a 2-day at the door membership, and if bought before April it's the same price as a 1-day at-the-door membership.\n\nI just want to attend one event at the convention. Do I still have to pay?\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a lower \"dealers room only\" membership rate?\n\nNo.\n\nIs there a lower \"gaming only\" membership rate?\n\nNo.\n\nEtiquette\n\nI'm a writer and I'd like to be on programming (panels, readings, autographings, etc.) at ArmadilloCon. How do I go about it?\n\nSend us a letter stating your qualifications and how you'd like to be involved in programming. We'll only use writers on programming if they've published something in a professional market. If your greatest achievement is having a story or book under consideration at a publisher or magazine, you aren't ready to be on programming at ArmadilloCon.\n\nWhen may I approach an author about getting a book signed?\n\nIt's easiest during a scheduled autographing, but most authors will also sign books after they're on a program item such as a reading or panel. It's inappropriate to corner an author at a meal or in the bathroom.\n\nMaybe I distribute flyers for another con here?\n\nCertainly.\n\nGuests\n\nWhy do you only have new and relatively obscure authors as Guest of Honor at ArmadilloCon?\n\nSince its very beginning, ArmadilloCon has bestowed the Guest of Honor position on innovative authors of cutting edge SF. We try to be the first to notice the rising stars of tomorrow. Our record has been fairly successful, since several past Guests of Honor have gone on to become popular and respected writers.\n\nWho has been Guest of Honor at ArmadilloCon?\n\nCatherine Asaro, Neal Barrett Jr., Pat Cadigan, Bradley Denton, Gardner Dozois, George Alec Effinger, William Gibson, Alexander Jablokov, K.

There is no competetion with the other participants, and there is no \"winner\".\n\nWho does the critiquing?\n\nAll critiquing is done by published SF/F writers with professional credentials.\n\nWhen may I submit a manuscript?\n\nAll entries must be received by the posted deadline, which is several weeks before the con. No at-the-door submissions will be accepted.\n\nCan I still get a submission into the Writers' Workshop after the deadline has passed?\n\nNo. The deadline was set to allow appropriate time to evaluate each submission.\n\nCopyright © 2002 by the Fandom Association of Central Texas, Inc.\n\nSend comments to webmaster."
