This audio collection presents the best-of-the-best short science fiction novels published in 2013 by current and emerging masters of this vibrant form.\n\nIn Earth I, by Stephen Baxter, a search among the stars to ferret out the origins of mankind amidst the Xaian normalisation digs up many surprises.\n\nIn Success, by Michael Blumlein, a brilliant but erratic biologist studying epigenetics struggles to hang onto his grip on everyday life as he writes his ground-breaking tome.\n\nIn Feral Moon, by Alexander Jablokov, the Alliance military is invading Phobos to retrieve dead bodies for later repatriation, but stiff resistance is putting the operation into serious doubt.\n\nIn The Weight of the Sunrise, by Vylar Kaftan, winner of both the Nebula Award and the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, the Incan empire is offered a vaccine, to contain a smallpox out-break, by a Virginian raising funds for the American war against the British.\n\nIn One, by Nancy Kress, a boxer down on his luck gains the ability to read minds and grapples round-after-round with the consequences.\n\nIn the Great Ship story Precious Mind, by Robert Reed, an immortal captain who has been living incognito for hundreds of years is kidnaped to help salvage an ancient derelict spaceship."
