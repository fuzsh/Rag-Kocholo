        "text": "Carve the Sky by Alexander Jablokov. At goodreads, with a good review here. Some corrections:\n\nWow, did I get the cover wrong.1\n\n\"George Harvey Westerkamp, Lord Monboddo, Interrogator of Boston\" is American, not British.\n\nThe artist is a sculptor.\n\n\"futuristic policing agency\" is the \"Union of Nations\", \"martians\" are the \"Technic Alliance\", the \"boorish lord\" is the \"Justice of Clavius\", Mongolia is actually the Pamir Mountains (I think), and I forgot to mention the \"Academia Sapientae\".\n\nPublished in 1991.\n\nThis is one a few stories that explores futuristic feudalism with any sort of meaning or permanence, along with \"The Fluted Girl\" by Paolo Bacigalupi and \"Dune\" by Frank Herbert."
