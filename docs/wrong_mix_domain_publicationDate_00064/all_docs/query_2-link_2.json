        "text": "March 29, 2023\n\nAs the reviews on the book proclaim, there is no way the reader could predict what this book has in store. I couldn't agree more, but that is far from a compliment. The book opens by introducing Stasov, the mad scientist and Soviet militant who has long been obsessed with bridging the gap between human and dolphin communication and is willing to go to any length to do so. I was expecting a profound breakthrough that would take time and negotiation between two intelligent species as they worked their way around the communication barrier, as was the experience of Dr. John Cunningham Lilly when attempting to decode the secrets of delphinid communication during his studies back in the 60's. However, a matter of chapters in, you find out that all it took to get the first dolphin to talk was playing the sound of an ancient underwater volcano erupting, then the dolphin starts screaming \"Let me die!\" in a HUMAN language, and then jumps out of its tank and commits suicide. The fact that interspecies communication was achieved through simply speaking using the same communication mechanism was... well... anticlimactic. While Lilly, in his real-world trials, had attempted to navigate the anatomical and vocal barriers that impede communication between humans and dolphins, in \"A Deeper Sea\", the dolphins suddenly decide to start speaking to humans without any practice or reliance on their own communication strategies.\n\nWhile the way that communication began was stupid, I still gave the book a chance because I wanted to know why the dolphin had begged for death. Clearly there had to be some deeper reason. Well, that's my problem with the book: the philosophy and reasoning behind the actions of the cetaceans make no sense, and the whole time, the book tries to really convince the reader that it is saying something profound. The truth is, this book presented a very dark and disturbing characterization of cetaceans, all of which, I feel, were heavily inaccurate. I am a cetacean specialist, and I have grown up around the ocean my whole life. The way orcas were depicted in this book was, frankly, disgusting. They are characterized as violence-obsessed bullies of the ocean who, like horror movie-inspired sharks, want to kill and eat everything for the sake of pleasure. This idea is also extended to the dolphins, who, at times in the book, revel in memories of raping and killing humans and sharks. Both of these descriptions of delphinids play into negative and outdated stereotypes: killer whales are dangerous murderers, and dolphins can't keep themselves from raping anything that moves. First of all, orcas have never intentionally harmed humans in the wild and there has only ever been one recorded incident of an orca killing a con-specific. In regards to other delphinids, while it is true that dolphins do engage in sexual acts with other species, to call this behavior \"rape\" is extending human intention and morality to dolphins. Furthermore, it pissed me off when the author claimed that humpback and sperm whales were not self-aware and that they were stupid. Studies show that the sperm whale has quite possibly the most advanced brain on the planet (John Lilly claims in his book \"The Mind of the Dolphin\" that the sperm whale has the mental capacity to listen to a 90-minute symphony once and then be able to recall any section by memory), and the humpback whale is one of the few animals on the planet whose brain contains spindle cells, cells that are believed to be involved in social recognition and self-awareness. While we do not know exactly what goes on in the minds of cetaceans, quite a bit of what we do know was either not properly researched or was ignored when writing this book. As a cetacean enthusiast and advocate, I found the portrayals of cetaceans not just terrible, but out-right offensive.\n\nI give this book two stars instead of one because though it was a mess, there were some genuinely interesting philosophical considerations, at times, in the plot. For example, when Stasov is imprisoned at a Japanese torture camp, one of his comrades, Makarygin, teaches him the value of accepting responsibility and seeing oppression as a chance for redemption. I also really appreciated how accurately and authentically Jablokov captured the Soviet way of living and the \"mysterious Russian soul\" in Stasov and his comrades; it's refreshing to see Russian characters that are not depicted as cartoon villains, though one could argue that Stasov is, in many ways, an internally tormented antagonist. However, in the end, the few things I enjoyed about this book were ripped apart in the last two chapters as a cyborg sperm whale plunged into the atmosphere of Jupiter and an orca was torn apart by other con-specifics. Overall, the plot and premise of this book made no sense, and the whole book came off as a pseudo-philosophical fever dream. While I wanted to love this book, I ultimately absolutely HATED it.\n\nI do not recommend this book to anyone. If you're thinking of reading \"A Deeper Sea\", do not waste your time: it's a disaster.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
