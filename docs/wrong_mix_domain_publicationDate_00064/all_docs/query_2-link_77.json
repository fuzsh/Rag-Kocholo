        "text": "The first broadcast will be at 3:55 p.m., and it will be repeated in the five minutes before the end of the hour for most of the remaining hours of the day. ================================================================= 25 June 2000 I previously posted word here that I will be Guest of Honor at Contact JAPAN 4, in suburban Tokyo, November 3-5, 2000. The enterprising people at the Kyoto University Science Fiction Association took note of the fact that I will be in Japan then, and extended an invitation to me to be Guest of Honor at their convention, Kyoto SF Festival, the following weekend. They've agreed to pay my hotel expenses for seven days 혰 the intervening time between the two conventions, and the time at the Kyoto convention. The Contact JAPAN people were delighted to accommodate the request of the Kyoto group (Contact JAPAN is really focussed on first-contact issues, not on SF per se, so they don't see the Kyoto event as competition), so I am now Guest of Honor at two separate cons in Japan this November. Needless to say, I'm thrilled about this. ================================================================= 25 June 2000 And speaking of Japan ... I received my author's copies of the Japanese edition of FRAMESHIFT today. For some reason, it's substantially thicker than my previous Japanese books; in English, it's about the same length as others that they've translated. By the way, the Kyoto SF Festival is planning to add my translator, Masayuki Uchida, as a special guest 혰 which will be fabulous; we've become great friends through E-mail, but have never met ... ================================================================= 25 June 2000 Today was the official book launch for Calculating God. It was held at the Central Branch of the Richmond Hill Public Library, north of Toronto, and also commemorated the conclusion of my three-month stint as writer-in-residence at the library (I actually have eight more appointments later this week with aspirant writers, but this was the official conclusion of my residency). It was a fabulous launch. The event started with live music: a terrific flute-and-harp duo. Cameron Knight, my supervisor at the library, talked about the residency program, then Shelagh Harris, the chair of the library board, gave a really fine talk about Calculating God; she gave a very insightful analysis of the book. I then read most of the opening chapter of the book, and did a Q&A session with the audience of 75 people (the maximum the venue could hold, according to fire regulations). After, we sold books 혰 lots of books <grin>. The library had gotten 25 hardcovers to sell, but ran out. Fortunately, I always have stock in the trunk of my car <hee hee>. The library laid on a terrific selection of munchies, and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. After, a bunch of people came back to Carolyn and my place for an impromptu party. All in all, it was a really terrific launch. ================================================================= 23 June 2000 I'm pleased to announce that I've been named Toastmaster for Ad Astra 2001, Toronto's big regional SF convention, to be held February 23-25, 2001. ================================================================= 23 June 2000 I'm pleased to announce that I've sold two books to Quarry Press, a leading Canadian literary publisher, via my agent, Ralph Vicinanza. The first is a nonfiction book, 50% reprint and 50% new material, a combination literary memoir and history of Canadian SF. The working title is A FANTASTIC LIFE: WRITING SCIENCE FICTION IN CANADA. It will be published in 2002. And the second, to appear in hardcover, is a collection of 22 of my short stories. The working title for the collection is ITERATIONS, and it will be published next year. The collection sports an introduction by JAMES ALAN GARDNER, plus individual intros to each story by me, and these short stories: \"The Hand You're Dealt,\" first published in FREE SPACE, edited by Brad Linaweaver and Edward E.

Greenberg, DAW Books, New York, July 1993. \"The Contest,\" first published in WHITE WALL REVIEW 1980, Ryerson Polytechnical Institute, Toronto; reprinted in 100 GREAT FANTASY SHORT SHORT STORIES, edited by Isaac Asimov, Terry Carr, and Martin Harry Greenberg, Doubleday, New York, 1984. \"Stream of Consciousness,\" first published in NO LIMITS: DEVELOPING SCIENTIFIC LITERACY USING SCIENCE FICTION and PACKING FRACTION AND OTHER TALES OF SCIENCE AND IMAGINATION, both edited by Julie E.

Greenberg and John Helfers, DAW Books, New York, June 2000. Between them, the stories in this collection have: * Won the Crime Writers of Canada Arthur Ellis Award * Won the Aurora Award twice three times! [I won again on 16 July 2000] * Won the CompuServe SF&F Forums' HOMer Award 혰 twice! * Won France's top SF award, Le Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire * Won a writing contest sponsored by The Village Voice * Been nominated for the Hugo Award * Been nominated for Japan's Seiun Award * Appeared in SFWA's Nebula Awards anthology * Appeared in Year's Best SF * Been the lead stories in four major U.S. anthologies ================================================================= 22 June 2000 Well, by this point, I'm sure everyone knows that the news story I said I would be talking about on TV today is the discovery of what looks to be subsurface liquid water on Mars. I spent the whole day doing TV related to this: two different programs for CBC Newsworld, and \"Studio 2,\" the nightly current-affairs program for TVOntario. Whew! ================================================================= 21 June 2000 Got a call from CBC Newsworld, asking me to make myself available down at the Broadcasting Centre in Toronto tomorrow at noon to comment on a breaking story. So, those in Canada, look for me on Newsworld between noon and 1:00 p.m. tomorrow Eastern time (earlier in Vancouver, later in Halifax, obviously). The news is embargoed until 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time tomorrow morning, but watch your local media for a big announcement about Mars then ... ================================================================= 18 June 2000 This evening was fabulous! Carolyn and I had a two-and-a-half-hour dinner with Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin (just the three of us), at a terrific four-star restaurant, with our mutual book distributor picking up the tab. Life is sweet. We talked about book publishing, about film deals, about getting humanity back into space, about the animated series I'm developing, and more. It was really wonderful. After dinner, I went off to the Idler Pub 혰 a Toronto landmark, famous for its literary readings 혰 were I read with three others in honor of father's day, in an evening organized by the Crime Writers of Canada. Tomorrow, Buzz and I appear live on stage together at Indigo Books in the Toronto Eaton Centre at 7:00 p.m. ================================================================= 18 June 2000 Back in December, I bought the 12-part Home Box Office series \"From the Earth to the Moon\" on videocassette. This is a dramatic hour-long series about the Apollo missions. Tonight, Carolyn, her brother, and I finished watching it. It was a fabulous piece of work; I really was blown away by it. On every level, it was tremendous. The acting was first-rate; I suspect executive producer Tom Hanks had a large hand in suggesting the use of sitcom actors in serious roles, since, of course, he himself had gotten his start in sitcoms. They used Dan Lauria (the father on THE WONDER YEARS), Grant Schaud (Miles on MURPHY BROWN), Stephen Root (the station owner on TALK RADIO), Dave Foley (the station manager on TALK RADIO), Debra Jo Rupp (Mrs. Foreman on THAT '70s SHOW), Dan Butler (Bulldog from FRASIER), Lane Smith (Perry White on LOIS AND CLARK), and Kevin Pollock (the standup comic who did the first good William Shatner impersonation 혰 everyone who does Shatner today is really doing Pollock doing Shatner). All of them turned in first-rate dramatic performances. The effects were outstanding; everything looked absolutely real. A great mix of CGI and motion-control. The choice of music was inspired 혰 everything from BLUE MOON to the ending theme from FIREBALL XL5 (\"I wish I were a spaceman / the fastest guy alive / I'd fly around the universe / in Fireball XL5 ...\"). But, most of all, the writing was amazing. Two episodes in particular blew me away, in part because they made really good dramatic television out of topics that one might have thought were impossible to make dramatic. One called \"Spider\" dealt with the engineering challenges in designing the Lunar Module; it was just stunningly good. Equally excellent was \"Galileo Was Right,\" an incredible piece of work devoting the entire hour to the process of training astronauts to be good geologists. David Clennon turned in the best performance as a brilliant university professor since John Houseman essayed Charles W. Kingsfield. I've rarely seen anything in science fiction that was as good as this episode at conveying the excitement of science. Each of the twelve episodes had different directors and different writers, and they took very different approaches to telling the tales of the various Apollo missions: for Apollo XI, they really did a character study of Buzz Aldrin, and the psychological impact of being the second, not the first, man on the moon; for Apollo XIII, they did a story about competing journalists 혰 old guard and new wave 혰 covering the reactions of the families to the space accident; for Apollo XIV, they focussed on Alan Shepard's long struggle to get back into space; for Apollo 16, they concentrated on the astronauts' wives (played by such big names as Elizabeth Perkins, Sally Field, and JoBeth Williams); for Apollo 17, they intercut between the making of Georges Melies 1902 film (lovingly recreated) \"Le Voyage dans la lune\" and the last Apollo mission. Really, I haven't enjoyed a miniseries this much since I, CLAUDIUS. Four stars on the RJS scale ... ================================================================= 13 June 2000 Chapters, Canada's largest bookstore chain, was a little slow off the mark getting Calculating God (and a lot of other summer titles) onto the shelves, but I'm pleased to report that the book is in stock, and in good quantities, across the entire chain now. ================================================================= 13 June 2000 A little news: Carbon Based Productions of Toronto has renewed its option on Robert J. Sawyer's Illegal Alien for a second year. The screenplay by Michael Lennick is undergoing final edits, with Sawyer serving as consultant. Actually, Carolyn and I met today face to face with the producer and screenwriter to pick up the check (and a nice, heavy check it was, too <grin>). And the venue could not have been more appropriate. The screenwriter, Lennick, is a special-effects designer, who has worked frequently with David Cronenberg, and who did the special effects for the War of the World's TV series. The meeting was in his office, and hanging from the ceiling was a four-foot wide model of a flying Martian war machine (the manta-ray design from the George Pal movie). This wasn't an original from the Pal film, but one of the duplicates made by master model maker Greg Jein for the TV series. It was gorgeous. Things seem to be going well with the movie; some of the financing is in place, the screenplay is in very good shape, and the producer, David Coatsworth, who just finished line producing Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest, is very pleased with how everything is coming together. It was an exciting day on other fronts: had lunch with John Pellatt, and award-winning animation scriptwriter, best known for his work on the NED'S NEWT series, and picked his brain for the series pilot I've been commissioned to write (which is coming along nicely, thanks). And in the evening, Carolyn and I went to a meeting of a reading group here in Toronto. They were doing FlashForward (which they'd voted their favorite book of the year, to my delight), and had asked me to come and sit in. Lots of fun. ================================================================= 12 June 2000 I have it in my hot little hands! Picked up a copy of David G. Hartwell's YEAR'S BEST SF 5 this evening at the Chapters bookstore near my home 혰 my first appearance in a YEAR'S BEST (although both Gardner Dozois and Datlow/Windling have given me multiple honorable mentions). It's quite a kick to be in this book. And speaking of my short fiction, yesterday was the official on-sale date for STAR COLONIES, a DAW paperback anthology edited by Martin Harry Greenberg and John Helfers. The lead story in that anthology is \"The Shoulders of Giants\" by yours truly; in terms of CompuServe content, there's also a Paul Levinson story; and in terms of Canadian content, there are also stories by Edo van Belkom and Robert Charles Wilson. I haven't seen the finished book yet myself (DAW is notoriously late getting their books into Canada), but it should be widely available in the U.S. now. The cover is great, though: a mostly-green Vincent DiFate outer-space shot. Fortunately, as one comes out, another is commissioned: I just received another story order from Tekno-Books (Marty Greenberg's company), with the kind of deadline I like to see: eleven months away, on May 1, 2001. ================================================================= 06 June 2000 Man, it's been a busy week! On Monday of last week, Carolyn and I headed off to Hockley Valley, a ski/golf resort outside of Toronto for a meeting of the Group Insurance Broker mangers for National Life, a big insurance company. That was a relaxing day. I sat around the pool, reading Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes's The Return while Carolyn hit a bucket of golf balls. Tuesday morning, I gave a 75-minute futurism speech as the keynote address at the National Life meeting. As the vice-president said, \"It could not have been better.\" I really had a blast doing it. Thursday, I gave three different readings at a Toronto area high school, to three different groups. Then, late in the afternoon, I gave another reading and did a Q&A session for a meeting of English teachers from across the Toronto District School Board. Thursday night was \"First Thursday,\" Toronto's pub night for the SF community. Carolyn and I went and had a great time; they recently changed venues, and the first time, I thought the food was mediocre, but it was fabulous this time. Over the weekend, Calculating God soared in sales on Amazon.com, hitting a top sales rank of 260 out of all the titles available on Saturday at 5:00 p.m. Nice! Yesterday, I did a 50-minute phone interview promoting Calculating God for the public-radio station in Indiana. All that, plus a bunch of appointments at the Richmond Hill Public Library, as my residency enters its last month. Whew! ================================================================= 02 June 2000 The webzine SCI-FI DIMENSIONS (www.scifidimensions.com) features a 41-minute streaming-audio interview with yours truly, talking about Calculating God. You'll need the (free) Real Audio player (available from www.realaudio.com, if you don't already have it) to hear the interview 혰 or you can read the transcript 혰 all 7,100 words of it 혰 on the site. ================================================================= 29 May 2000 It's been a busy but terrific week ... Tuesday was \"Hangman's Night\" at Sleuth of Baker Street, Toronto's mystery-fiction bookstore, the annual wine-and-cheese reception the day before the Arthur Ellis Awards banquet. The Arthurs are Canada's national mystery-fiction awards presented by the Crime Writers of Canada. This was a special Hangman's Night, since the anthology ARTHUR ELLIS AWARDS, edited by Peter Sellers, was launched. My story \"Just Like Old Times\" is reprinted in that book; I signed more than fifty copies to fulfill the store's mail-order and store-stock needs. Wednesday, Carolyn and I had lunch with Mark Askwith, producer at Space: The Imagination Station, Canada's counterpart of the Sci-Fi Channel. Mark gave me a tape of the \"Shelf Space\" segment they'd just started running to promote my new novel CALCULATING GOD. \"Shelf Space\" is two minutes long and runs as a filler between programs; the Calculating God one will run forty times over the next couple of weeks. It's way cool: like getting a free commercial on national TV that runs over and over again ... Wednesday evening was the actual Arthur Ellis Award banquet, held at a place called The Coloured Stone in downtown Toronto. I was honored and thrilled to be asked to be the presenter for the Best Novel award; the award went to Rosemary Aubert, which pleased me 혰 her first novel, several years ago, had a blurb on it from me. Thursday, Carolyn and I flew to Vancouver, British Columbia (a four-hour flight), where we were writer guests of honour, along with Spider and Jeanne Robinson, at V-Con 25, the Vancouver regional SF convention. Thursday night we had dinner with the Con-Com. Friday, the con began. It was a great convention, with very well attended panels and lots of lively discussion. I gave a reading of my new short story \"The Shoulders of Giants\" and the opening of Calculating God. Both were very well received. All in all, a fun time, and it was terrific to get to spend time with old friends Spider and Jeanne Robinson. Meanwhile, I'm very excited to announce a special event at the Indigo book superstore in the Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto: on Monday, June 19, at 7:00 p.m., I will be doing a live interview with Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin E. \"Buzz\" Aldrin. I'm very much looking forward to this! (Actually, this will be the second astronaut I've met; in 1994 I received an Aurora Award from Marc Garneau, the first Canadian in space.) I really feel privileged to get to do this. ================================================================= 19 May 2000 I now have a copy of Calculating God in my hot little hands. My local Indigo had copies in stock this evening, and I bought two, just so that I'd have a couple (including one to wave in front of the cameras on Canada AM on tuesday). The book looks FABULOUS 혰 absolutely stunningly gorgeous. The advance dust jackets looked really good, but this is even better: they've selectively varnished parts of the dust jacket so that the title and my name leap out now. It really is beautiful, the nicest cover I've had, I think. ================================================================= 19 May 2000 Well, my three-month stint as Writer in Residence at the Richmond Hill Public Library is more than half over now, and I must say I've been enjoying it. I've had meetings with dozens of aspirant writers 혰 SF writers, mystery writers, poets, nonfiction writers, etc. etc. 혰 and it's all been very stimulating. Some of the work submitted, of course, has been just plain awful, but a surprising amount of it has been excellent. I'm amazed, thought, at how many people don't know the difference between \"it's\" and \"its.\" ================================================================= 19 May 2000 One of the things I've been trying to do of late is establish myself further as a futurist / science commentator. I've been making good progress, I think. For instance, on Wednesday, the CBC sent a cab over to whisk me down to the Broadcasting Centre to go live on Newsworld (their 24-hour-a-day all-news cable service) to talk about a comet that had gotten within 1.5 AU of the sun without being detected by any comet hunters (it was unearthed in old data being sifted through from the SOHO solar-wind satellite). ================================================================= 15 May 2000 I was pleased to see on the weekend that Illegal Alien is now in a second paperback printing. To paraphrase Jonny Hart, \"Book Got Legs!\" ================================================================= 14 May 2000 LIBRARY JOURNAL has weighed in very favorably on Calculating God, which should be in bookstores in a couple of weeks: Sawyer once again demonstrates his wild talent for innovative, iconoclastic storytelling as he relates a thought-provoking, sobering, yet wryly compassionate tale of one man's discovery of timelessness even as his own time is running out. A good choice for most sf collections. ================================================================= 10 May 2000 Courtesy of my translator, Masayuki Uchida, here is the list of foreign works nominated for this year's Seiun Awards, Japan's top honor in SF. The awards are for works first published in Japanese translation in 1999; this is the Japanese award frequently presented at the Worldcon as part of the Hugo ceremony. FOREIGN NOVELS: Permutation City (Greg Egan) Quarantine (Greg Egan) Forever Peace (Joe Haldeman) The Immortality Option (James P. Hogan) Kirinyaga (Mike Resnick) Starplex (Robert J. Sawyer) Endymion & The Rise of Endymion (Dan Simmons) One of Us (Michael Marshall Smith) FOREIGN SHORT STORIES: Aurora in Four Voices (Catherine Asaro) War Birds (Stephen Baxter) The Cutie (Greg Egan) Three Hearings on the Existence of Snakes in the Human Bloodstream (James Alan Gardner) Doing the Circuit (Alexander Jablokov) Cosmic Expense Account (C. M. Kornbluth) \"...Where Angels Fear to Tread\" (Allen Steele) Taklamakan (Bruce Sterling) Out of the Everywhere (James Tiptree, Jr.) ================================================================= 10 May 2000 A nice surprise today: Chapters.ca 혰 Canada's largest online bookseller 혰 is offering Calculating God today at 50% off list price as a \"Pre-Release 50%\" and \"Be First ... Buy Today!\" special. The book is the second of only seven titles featured right on the main BOOKS page of the site (go to http://www.chapters.ca, then click on the \"BOOKS\" tab at the top of the screen, or go staight to this screen with http://www.chapters.ca/books/). ================================================================= 04 May 2000 A crew from Space: The Imagination Station (the Canadian counterpart of the Sci-Fi Channel) came by today, and interviewed Edo van Belkom (who had rendezvoused with us here at my place) about his new book WRITING HORROR, and his nominations for the Aurora Award. If you see Edo sitting on a bench in front of some trees, that's the backyard to the condo apartment building I live in. They then interviewed me, at other places around the building's grounds (we have great landscaping in our building) about my Aurora nominations, about my web site, and about my upcoming novel Calculating God. So, if you get Space, look for Edo and me to be edited together into a piece about the Auroras, and other separate news pieces with each of us over the next couple of weeks ..."
