        "text": "I didn’t intend to read any more Sterling immediately after his Holy Fire and Globalhead, but mission creep is a common feature of our literary recon here. Once I remembered that some of the stories in the latter share the protagonist of this novel, I decided to read this one now.\n\nReview: Zeitgeist: A Novel of Metamorphosis, Bruce Sterling, 2000.\n\nIt seems that no one much seems to care about this novel anymore. It may evoke the “spirit of an age” or, with a moral literal translation of the German, be a “time ghost”, but either way no one much seems to care about it anymore. In my quick perusal of the Web of a Million Lies, I find not much in the way of reviews since 2018.\n\nThat’s understandable. This is not only a goodbye to international trickster Leggy Starlitz, smuggler and entrepreneur of questionable goods and services, but, as the Science Fiction Encyclopedia’s “Bruce Sterling” entry says “a mocking homage to the forever-disappeared twentieth century”.\n\nWith guest cameo references to George Soros, Osama Bin Laden, and Slobodan Milošević, this isn’t even a science fiction novel though it has interludes of magical realism. It’s a vivid and often funny look at the gaps in the global order’s wainscotting that a man like Starlitz thrives in, or, as he puts it, the places where the global order is fraying and he shapes a counternarrative. And the world it describes is one I mostly remember: Russia and the other former countries of the USSR coping with economic and often demographic devastation, Turkey trying to become the leader of the Islamic countries of central Asia, its more secular Islam a counterpoint to Iran, and the bombing of Kosovo in 1999. I didn’t remember the self-immolation of Kurds to embarrass their old enemy Turkey.\n\nY2K is a major concern of Starlitz all throughout out this book, and it wasn’t published until October 2000. This is not a book about millennial anxiety that wasn’t published timely like James Gunn’s The Millennium Blues nor was it blindsided by events like Norman Spinrad’s Russian Spring. It starts toward the end of the millennium and in Istanbul. Leggy Starlitz, as part of a bet with genius music producer Makoto — essentially that they can make money out of a girl band – the G-7 – that has interchangeable members and whose music is crap.\n\nStarlitz teams up with a rich Turk, Ozbey, to take the G-7 on a tour of Islamic countries including some that were formerly in the USSR. But, eventually, Starlitz finds out that Ozbey is tied up with the Turkish Deep State that is going to use the band to culturally destabilize those countries and make them more secular and less fundamentalist Islamic countries like Turkey. Not only will Turkey be sort of a leader of a new Caliphate, but Ozbey will make some money heroin smuggling too.\n\nStarlitz doesn’t want any of the girls dying before Y2K which is the absolute shutdown of the whole project. When he finds out what Ozbey is up to, Starlitz leaves the group, has some odd experiences in Mexico and America and Hawaii, and returns to confront Ozbey in Turkish Cyprus.\n\nCharacters from all the previous Starlitz adventures show up: Khoklov and Tamara (now residing in Hollywood) from “Hollywood Kremlin”, Vanna and ex federal prosecutor Jane O’Houlihan and Leggy’s daughter Zeta from “Are You for 86?”, and, maybe, characters from the “The Littlest Jackal” (no, my blogger due diligence didn’t cover re-reading that story).\n\nThe fantastical content enters in the weird interlude when Starlitz and Zeta leave Cyprus for Mexico. There he tosses their passports and ID papers and money. They slip across the border and end up squatting in some abandoned buildings in New Mexico.\n\nIt’s all part of a weird ritual to bring Starlitz’s father into existence, so Zeta can meet him before he vanishes for good at the end of the century. Starlitz’s father has a strange, obscure past, but the relevant point is that, when trying to steal some valuable metal around America’s first atomic bomb, he was in the device when it was detonated turning him into a sort of ghost haunting the twentieth century whose central narrative event was that first detonation. He can be evoked by use of old objects and music and dance. And, since the century is coming to an end, Starlitz’s father won’t be showing up again.\n\nThere is plenty of humor in the book and bizarre characters and a surprising number of bodies that need disposing of.\n\nUpon finishing it about three weeks ago, it seemed fresh and delightful.\n\nBut thinking about it gradually generated annoyance. And that comes from Sterling’s seemingly sincere buy-in of post-modern notions of reality merely being a narrative. As Starlitz tells Zeta, when expressing his respect for French semioticians and structuralists and post-structuralists. It’s impossible to escape the world of language, that “social discourses” creates our reality. Granted, as he tells Zeta, there is a physical reality but then he goes to talk about how only French deconstructionists understood reality and it did them no good. Starlitz sees himself as existing in the places where the master narratives of the world are fraying and coming up against new, counter narratives.\n\nThis motif of politics and society as a narrative shows up elsewhere. Ozbey, when he confronts Starlitz towards novels’ end, says his destiny, his narrative, won’t allow him to be killed. Likewise, he has decided not to kill Starlitz since that seems an incongrous part of Starlitz’s narrative. It will be better if Leggy just disappears on New Year’s Day. The whole G-7 affair is an attempt to impose a narrative on Islamic countries.\n\nTurkey is astounded that NATO has let it bomb Christian Serbia. Tim from ECHELON seems to be trying to impose some order, part of the US government’s new concern with international terrorism and the drug traffic. If Sterling was using this version of “narrative “as just a metaphor for making plans or using propaganda or lies we tell ourselves and others, that would be one thing. But the story seems to embrace the idea that things like rock bands can shape reality. “Controlling the narrative” and its variant phrases may have been the stated goal of many a would-be politician and bureaucrat throughout the world, but it turns out that mere narratives don’t determine the amount of munitions someone can produce or even the desire to use them.\n\nAt novel’s end, Zeta tells her father’s he’s bad,\n\ntotally provisional and completely without morality. You can personify the trends of your day, but you never get ahead of those trends. You never make the world any better.\n\nPeople aren’t happy to him show up. However, when she grows up (she’s only 11), people are going to be happy to see her since she’ll make sure they get fed, watered, and bathed. (Zeta has been exposed to much squalor and poverty in the trip with her dad in Mexico, and he makes sure to tell that this is how most of the world lives. Her education is complete when she helps her dad bury some bodies in Cyprus.) The twentieth century’s problems, she says, are “crude and lousy”. The new century will have “serious, sophisticated problems”\n\nNor is she going to emulate her lesbian parents and their friends: “lame hippie crap” and petty criminals high on drugs.\n\nThe book seems to imply that hope of the world is NGOs or even a blatantly corrupt UN as Khoklov’s nephew thinks. Perhaps, Sterling foresaw the possibility of a do-good grifter like Chelsea Clinton or a Greta Thunberg. However, you can’t be absolutely sure with Sterling. Starlitz’s new idea, at novel’s end, is helping people with bad consciences spend their money. It sounds a lot like many a NGO scam today with a hardy skimoff for the people managing the NGO. Perhaps Sterling is once again ironically undercutting his seeming moral point.\n\nOf course, few trend lines of the novel continued. Or, shall we say, those narratives couldn’t be imposed on reality. Russia revived. Turkey did not dominate Central Asian Moslems as it hoped. Turns out bombing Serbian Christians didn’t make Moslems any less tractable in their dealings with Europe, and Osama bin Laden introduced a new phase in the (failed) War on Terror. Still, it was an enjoyable book and is genuinely full of humor."
