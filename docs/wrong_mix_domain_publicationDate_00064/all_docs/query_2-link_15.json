        "text": "Angelina Jolie, an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian of global repute, has been a prominent figure in Hollywood for her remarkable acting prowess and dedication to philanthropic endeavors. Born on June 4th, 1975 in Los Angeles, California to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, she was destined for the limelight from an early age. Her breakthrough came with the biographical television film George Wallace (1997), which won her a Golden Globe Award. However, it was her portrayal of video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider that launched Jolie into international stardom. Jolie's career is marked by diverse roles across genres that showcase her versatility as an actor. She bagged an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Girl Interrupted (1999). In addition to mainstream cinema success with films like Mr & Mrs Smith, Wanted, and Maleficent, she ventured into directing and screenwriting with projects such as In the Land of Blood and Honey(2011) - a war drama set during the Bosnian War. Apart from being one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses over time, Angelina Jolie has made significant contributions towards humanitarian causes. She became involved with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) after filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in Cambodia – eventually becoming their Goodwill Ambassador and later Special Envoy. Her work focuses on areas like refugee rights, conservationist efforts including wildlife protection initiatives globally along with education programs especially designed for children affected by conflict.\n\nEminem, born as Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is a globally recognized figure in the music industry known for his raw talent and controversial lyrics. Born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph Missouri, Eminem's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. Raised primarily by his mother in Detroit, Michigan after a tumultuous relationship with his father who left when he was still an infant, Eminem found solace and expression through rap music. Rising to prominence in the late 1990s with his debut album Infinite, Eminem quickly gained notoriety for his provocative themes and explicit language. His unique style of storytelling combined with intricate wordplay won him critical acclaim despite stirring controversy among conservative audiences. His second studio album The Slim Shady LP launched him into superstardom earning him both commercial success and critical recognition including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In addition to being one of the best-selling solo artists of all time with over 220 million records sold worldwide; Eminem has also made significant contributions to the film industry too. He starred in the semi-autobiographic movie 8 Mile, where he portrayed a struggling rapper akin to himself during his early days in Detroit which earned him an Academy award for Best Original Song – Lose Yourself. Despite facing numerous challenges throughout his personal life including battles with addiction; Eminem continues to be regarded as one of the most influential figures within hip-hop culture.\n\nIrwin Allen Ginsberg (; June 3, 1926 – April 5, 1997) was an American poet, philosopher and writer. He is considered to be one of the leading figures of both the Beat Generation during the 1950s and the counterculture that soon followed. He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism, and sexual repression and was known as embodying various aspects of this counterculture, such as his views on drugs, hostility to bureaucracy and openness to Eastern religions. He was one of many influential American writers of his time who were associated with the Beat Generation, including Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. Ginsberg is best known for his poem \"Howl\", in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States. In 1956, \"Howl\" was seized by San Francisco police and US Customs. In 1957, it attracted widespread publicity when it became the subject of an obscenity trial, as it described heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when sodomy laws made homosexual acts a crime in every U.S. state. \"Howl\" reflected Ginsberg's own sexuality and his relationships with a number of men, including Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong partner. Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that \"Howl\" was not obscene, adding, \"Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?\"Ginsberg was a practicing Buddhist who studied Eastern religious disciplines extensively. He lived modestly, buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in downscale apartments in New York's East Village. One of his most influential teachers was the Tibetan Buddhist Chögyam Trungpa, the founder of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. At Trungpa's urging, Ginsberg and poet Anne Waldman started The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics there in 1974.Ginsberg took part in decades of non-violent political protest against everything from the Vietnam War to the War on Drugs. His poem \"September on Jessore Road\", calling attention to the plight of Bangladeshi refugees, exemplifies what the literary critic Helen Vendler described as Ginsberg's tireless persistence in protesting against \"imperial politics, and persecution of the powerless.\"His collection The Fall of America shared the annual U.S. National Book Award for Poetry in 1974. In 1979, he received the National Arts Club gold medal and was inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Ginsberg was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1995 for his book Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems 1986–1992.\n\nAnne Rice (October 4, 1941 – December 11, 2021) was an American author of gothic fiction, erotic literature, and Christian literature. She was best known for her series of novels The Vampire Chronicles. Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations—Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Queen of the Damned (2002). Born in New Orleans, Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas, and later to San Francisco. She was raised in an observant Catholic family but became an agnostic as a young adult. She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire in 1976, while living in California, and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, following a publicized return to Catholicism, Rice published the novels Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana, fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus.
