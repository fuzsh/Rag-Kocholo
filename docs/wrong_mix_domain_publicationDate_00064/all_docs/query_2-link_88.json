        "text": "I spent most of Memorial Day weekend in Hunt Valley, MD at Balticon—and what a great weekend it was!\n\nDespite a few scheduling speed bumps (panelists didn’t find out their panels until a few days prior), everything eventually went just fine. Many of us had some kind of transportation challenge, whether we came via plane, train or automobile. I got grounded on the tarmac in Charlotte for an hour due to thunderstorms. Jean Marie Ward got stuck on the highway for five hours. Lots of people got stuck behind a funeral procession. Even folks who came via train had problems. Ah, holiday traffic. It made for missed panels and sparse audiences early on Friday, but gradually worked its way out and everything went well later on.\n\nThe panels were a lot of fun, as always, packed with lively audiences and feisty panelists. We had an especially good turnout on Books You Loved as A Kid That You Still Love. That seemed to really strike a chord with a lot of people. Philcon, Capclave, and the Texas NSFIC bid all held very nice parties, and the SFWA get-together for members was very nice as well. In addition, the movie and science tracks had a very strong schedule, and while I didn’t get a chance to see as many of them as I wanted, I was happy to note that the programming was there for others to enjoy.\n\nAnd now for the Hawthorn Moon Sneak Peek!\n\nLong-time readers have heard about my June 21 sneak peek online event, but for folks just finding out, here’s the scoop. Every year on June 21 (the summer solstice), I post the new book cover for my upcoming book, plus I hold an online sneak peek with content, giveaway contests and online goodies spread across my web site, blog, social media pages and also on the sites of my publisher and other media partners. It’s your first look at the first chapter of The Dread, the gorgeous cover, and some can’t-get-it-anywhere-else extras like interviews with me and my characters.\n\nWhy is it called The Hawthorn Moon event? Because in The Summoner, the big event in the plot happened on the summer solstice, which was called the Hawthorn Moon. I called the first online event that, and it just stuck.\n\nWhere do you get the details? Watch this blog on June 21 and you’ll see where to find all the goodies. I’ll also send out an announcement to my Chronicles of the Necromancer newsletter list. Stay tuned—it’s always a real good time!\n\nBook News\n\nIf you are a frequent con-goer, Larry Smith Books also has signed copies of my stuff., so look for his booth at conventions.\n\nHave you read my short stories? If not, check out Rum & Runestones or The Bitten Word for a totally different world and set of characters!\n\nSignings and Events\n\nI will be in stores doing book signings and at genre conventions throughout 2011, and I love to meet readers, so please stop by and say hello! Here’s the list of events so far (we’ll keep a running list posted on the Events tab).\n\nCan’t make it when I’m at the store? Most stores have signed copies of all the books after the event, so be sure to stop in! If you call ahead before a signing, many stores will let you buy the book(s) over the phone so I can sign them when I’m there, and you can pick them up later.\n\nJune 4 – 6: ConCarolinas, Charlotte, NC\n\nJune 21: Hawthorn Moon Online Sneak Peek Event\n\nSeptember: DragonCon, Atlanta, GA\n\nOctober: Capclave, Gaithersburg, MD\n\nOctober 24 – 31: Days of the Dead Blog Tour\n\nNovember: Philcon, Cherry Hill, NJ\n\nDecember: Watch for new in-store dates in the Charlotte area\n\nGhost in the Machine Podcast\n\nI host a podcast called The Ghost in the Machine Fantasy Podcast (www.GhostInTheMachinePodcast.com) where I introduce my listeners to authors, artists, publishing pros and other interesting folks show up on the podcast, so please check it out!\n\nIn May guests were Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, author of over 80 novels, on making a long series work and paranormal mystery writer Casey Daniels (Pepper Martin mysteries) about merging magic with mystery.

This is always one of my favorite conventions because it’s big enough to have a lot to do and small enough to spend quality time with friends, readers and other authors.\n\nFor once, Michael Ventrella and I weren’t on every single panel together, although Michael graciously asked me to join hin on two books marketing panels. Alan Wold did his wonderful writing workshop, and then Alan, Peter Prellowitz and I were together on a new two-session workshop on plot and character. That was really a lot of fun, and there are plans to do the plot/character workshop again next year!\n\nOne of my favorite panels was with Toni Weisskopf (Baen Books) along with the cover artist for John Ringo’s books, where we were talking about everything that goes into making a great cover.\n\nCoyote Run played a concert (alas, I had a reading during the first hour), and I caught the last half—they are always fantastic.\n\nKudos to the con suite team admirably headed up by Leigh and Alexis Gilliland. A con moves on its stomach (and on caffeine).\n\nWe shared the hotel with a high school prom. I don’t think it occurred to the seniors at the prom that they were every bit as much in costume as we were, or that it was just as much of a fantasy for them as for us. (I was, however, very impressed by the Klingon in a formal purple outfit with a parasol. Nice touch.)\n\nMy next convention is Balticon on Memorial Day weekend—hope to see you there!\n\nBook News\n\nThe Sworn is in bookstores and online now! Also in Kindle and Nook, with audiobook coming soon.\n\nThanks for your patience—Dark Lady’s Chosen is finally available for Nook!\n\nJust signed contracts for Dark Lady’s Chosen to be translated into French and for The Sworn and The Dread to be translated into Polish. The first three Chronicles of the Necromancer books came out in French last year, and I felt bad that French readers had to wait for the resolution to Dark Haven’s cliffhanger ending, but publishing is not a quick business!\n\nRemember—all the books are available in Nook, Kindle and audiobook, so tell your alternative-format friends!\n\nIf you couldn’t be at one of my recent signings, you can stop by any of the stores where I’ve just been to pick up signed copies of all the books!

I’ve just gotten back from Lunacon up in New York. This was Lunacon’s 54th year, and it didn’t disappoint, though attendance was down a bit from prior years. The programming track was robust and varied, panels had a good number of panelists as well as good attendance by attendees, and the vendor room had a great selection of items for sale.\n\nI was on about 12 panels—I lose track after a while—and had fun with all of them, although I have to admit that I’m a little fuzzy on the details about the panels that ended around midnight due to sheer exhaustion. There were also several launch parties for new books of authors such as GOH Lawrence Schoen and Joshua Palmatier. Plenty of great conversations continued at all hours in the dining room, bar, corridors and room parties. A good time was had by all.\n\nMy assigned panels were a lot of fun. Titles included Developing Believable culture and Religion, Urban Fantasy, Creating Heroic Characters, Incorporating the Supernatural, The Essential Sidekick, Ghosts and Witchcraft, Folklore and Mythology in Fantasy, Skeptics and the Paranormal, Writing a First Chapter that Sells and Writing Battle Scenes. Whew! Thanks to all my fellow panelists and to the lively audiences we had at every panel.\n\nNext up is Ravencon in Richmond, Va. Ravencon has such a great, friendly vibe and also boasts a fantastic con suite. Ravencon is also usually a popular place for book launch parties, making it a great place to meet new people and chat in a relaxed setting.\n\nAfter Ravencon comes Balticon, another very well-run convention with a fantastic con suite. If I seem a bit obsessed with con suites, it’s because writer guests often are scheduled on back to back panels and we don’t have time to grab a bite to eat in a restaurant between panels. A good con suite means the difference between getting “real” food and living off the vending machine, so the committed con suite volunteers are near and dear to my heart. They’re also often unsung heroes, so hug a con suite volunteer and be sure to say ‘thank you’.\n\nCatch my new interview on kick-ass women characters on #BroadPod: Broad Pod.

Both were first-time cons for me, and I really had a great time at both of them. Arisia is big and jam-packed with panels. Despite the fact that the con was in a brand new hotel, everything ran very smoothly. I met some fun people, including Guest of Honor Kelly Armstrong (who will be a guest on an upcoming segment of my Ghost in the Machine podcast later this spring). Kelly and I were on several vampire panels, and I somehow ended up on several urban fantasy panels. (I figure that since my books take place in city settings, they’re just medieval urban fantasy, right?)\n\nArisia also had me on several awesome myth, fantasy and religion-in-fantasy panels that were loud, noisy and fun. I love it when the audience is well-versed in a subject and passionate in their beliefs, and when they actually participate instead of watching the panel do silly author tricks. Arisia also had a very nice anime track and some interesting choices for the film track. The vendor room/art show was pretty awesome, as was the extra floor of suites with additional vendors offering predominantly steampunk outfits and accessories.\n\nChattacon was smaller but also amazingly friendly. It’s held at the Chattanooga Choo Choo hotel, a converted Victorian railway station, and it looks like the kind of place where steampunk is totally at home. In fact, there was a big turnout of steampunk costumes, including an organ grinder with a darling “monkey”. (Gee, I never made my kids dress like a monkey. But she was cute!)\n\nChattacon does a great job with gaming and its con suite, as well as the ops/green room for guests. The vendor room was very friendly also. I had the opportunity to meet Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (another upcoming Ghost in the Machine guest) and K.K. Rusch (ditto), as well as to get some quality chat time with Baen publisher Toni Weisskopf and my good friend (and Artist Guest of Honor) Ruth Thompson. Another friend, J.F. Lewis, showed up, and joined in the conversation.\n\nMy next con will be Lunacon in Rye Brook, NY March 18 – 21. Lunacon has a long and storied history, as this will be it’s 54th convention. It’s known for its mindbendingly difficult to navigate hotel (dubbed the Escher), as well as its diligent lineup of great panels and a fantastic vendor room. I’m thrilled to be going back!\n\nI’m spending every weekend in February in bookstores with the launch of The Sworn. Signings are fun because I get to reconnect with long-time readers as well as getting the chance to introduce new readers to the books. I’ve gotten to know many readers who have been showing up to my signings since the beginning, and it’s great to see them again and hear their news. I always get into some fun conversations with readers and with the bookstore staff, who know everything about everything!\n\nIf you’ve been to one of my signings, you know my style is to greet everyone who comes into the store, offer a free bookmark, and engage them with the new book. Most people think it’s pretty cool to have an author in the store, or at least they’re polite enough to let me finish my greeting before telling me that fantasy isn’t there thing, which is OK, too. When I mention the words “fantasy adventure” I can tell pretty quickly whether someone is interested or not by whether their pupils dilate or contract. Well, that and the few people who have made a cross with their fingers and backed away, but that doesn’t happen very often.\n\nLongtime readers, take note—I will not be at the Arizona Renaissance Festival this year due to a calendar mix-up. (Likewise, a prior commitment forced me to cancel my appearance at StellarCon and I was unable to appear at SheVaCon.) Normally both the Arizona Ren Fest and StellarCon are part of my March line-up, but this year it didn’t work out. I’ve already scheduled a 2012 date for Arizona, and I’m hoping the programming gods will invite me back next year for StellarCon and SheVaCon.\n\nBook News\n\nThe Sworn is in bookstores and online now!

Keep an eye out also for the ebook and audio editions.\n\nFor those who have never read my books, The Sworn is an entry point into my world of the Winter Kingdoms. You don’t have to read the Chronicles books to be able to jump right into the action (but of course I hope you will). For those who have followed Tris, Jonmarc and the gang from the beginning, The Sworn is the next phase of the adventure, picking up six months after the end of Dark Lady’s Chosen with all new dangers and aventures.\n\nHere’s the blurb from the cover:\n\nAs plague and famine scourge the winter kingdoms, a vast invasion force is mustering from beyond the northern seas. And at its heart, a dark spirit mage wields the blood magic of ancient, vanquished gods.\n\nSummoner-King Martris Drayke must attempt to meet this great threat, gathering an army from a country ravaged by civil war. Neighboring lands reel toward anarchy while plague decimates their leaders. Drayke must seek new allies from among the living – and the dead –- as an untested generation of rulers face their first battle.\n\nThen someone disturbs the legendary Dread as they rest in a millennia-long slumber\n\nbeneath sacred barrows. Their warrior guardians, the Sworn, know the Dread could be pivotal as a force for great good or evil. But if it’s the latter, could even the Summoner-King’s sorcery prevail?\n\nSignings and Events\n\nI will be in stores doing book signings and at genre conventions throughout 2011, and I love to meet readers, so please stop by and say hello! Here’s the list of events so far (we’ll keep a running list posted on the Events tab).\n\nJan. 21-23 – Chattacon, Chattanooga, TN\n\nFeb. 5 – Barnes & Noble, Pineville NC—The Sworn will be out!\n\nFeb. 12 – Barnes & Noble, Morrocroft (South Charlotte)\n\nFeb. 19 – Books A Million, Concord Mills\n\nFeb. 26 – Barnes & Noble, Birkdale Village (Huntersville NC)\n\nApr. 2 – Carolina Writers Conference\n\nApr. 8 – 10 – Ravencon, Richmond, VA\n\nMay 27 – 29 – Balticon, Hunt Valley, MD\n\nJune 4 – 6 – ConCarolinas, Charlotte, NC\n\nJune 21 – Hawthorn Moon Online Sneak Peek Event\n\nSeptember – DragonCon, Atlanta, GA\n\nOctober – Capclave, Gaithersburg, MD\n\nOctober 24 – 31 – Days of the Dead Blog Tour\n\nNovember – Philcon, Cherry Hill, NJ\n\nCon updates!\n\nI was a panelist at Arisia in Boston for the first time Jan. 14 – 16, and had a wonderful con! I was on 10 panels, so I got to meet a lot of other writers as well as some fantastic readers, and of course, to see old friends. Several of my panels focused on myth and folklore in fantasy, and we had a very lively crowd! Other panels touched on religion in SF/F, Vampires in Urban and Epic Fantasy, and tips to help authors use social media to reach readers more effectively. Although one of my panels conflicted with the Broad Universe Rapid Fire Reading, I was with the BU folks in spirit, and hope to be on one of their RFRs again soon.\n\nChattacon in Chattanooga, TN is another first for me. I’m always excited when I get to go to a new convention and meet readers from a different area of the country. Some of my panels include topics with dragons and multi-book series. A good friend of mine, artist Ruth Thompson, was guest of honor. Now Ruth and I have known each other for several years from the Renaissance Festival circuit, and I have her fabulous paintings all over my house. It’s always fun to be at an event with Ruth!\n\nLongtime readers, take note—I will not be at the Arizona Renaissance Festival this year due to a calendar mix-up. (I was invited but we couldn’t get the dates to work out.) However, we’re making plans now for 2012 with the intent for me to return, so stay tuned!\n\nLikewise, a prior commitment forced me to cancel my appearance at StellarCon. It’s going to be better than ever this year and I’m really sorry about having to miss. Hopefully next year!\n\nGhost in the Machine Podcast\n\nI host a podcast called The Ghost in the Machine Fantasy Podcast (www.GhostInTheMachinePodcast.com) where I introduce my listeners to all of the cool people I meet traveling around to conventions and Renaissance Festivals. Two audio interviews air each month (they’re about 15 minutes long). Authors, artists, publishing pros and other interesting folks show up on the podcast, so please check it out!\n\nIn January/February, guests include: Juliet McKenna (Irons in the Fire) on the concept of legacy in epic fantasy and author Karina Sumner-Smith about the continuing importance of short fiction in a writer’s career. February guests are Laura Anne Gilman (the Retrievers series) and Juliet Blackwell (Secondhand Spirits: A Witchcraft Mystery).\n\nPodcast guests are also invited to post a guest blog on my Disquieting Visions group blog (http://DisquietingVisions.wordpress.com). Disquieting Visions is co-hosted by J.F. Lewis (Staked, Revamped, Crossed), Crymsyn Hart (paranormal romance), Tina McSwain (Charlotte Area Paranormal Society) and me. We’ll also be inviting our friends to guest blog, so you’ll see some of the top names in epic and urban fantasy, paranormal romance and mystery, as well as psychics, clairvoyant mediums, and paranormal researchers. Check it out!\n\nOK, That Covers It For Now\n\nI’m now writing two books a year (I just turned in The Dread, Book Two in The Fallen Kings Cycle), and I’m working on a whole new series for 2012, The Ascendant Kingdoms. I do plan to return to the world of Tris and Jonmarc and the gang with more adventures after The Dread, but the plot line takes a several year break until the next big adventure, so it seemed to be a good time to let those characters rest (they’ve been through a lot) and launch a new world. Details to come, but suffice to say that The Ascendant Kingdoms books will be a whole new world, all new characters and lots more magic and adventures. (And yeah, there will still be ghosts and vampires and shapeshifters.) Details to come!\n\nAmid all of that, I will do my best to blog when I have something to say. And to answer questions. So keep the comments coming!\n\nCategorized as: Uncategorized"
