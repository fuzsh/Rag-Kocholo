After the mob boss's Cadillac mysteriously resurfaces in a Las Vegas lake and a photo turns up of the murder victims posing with him in the 1970s, the CSIs begin to investigate whether or not the notorious gangster, whose disappearance remains a mystery, might somehow be connected to the current killing spree in Las Vegas.
