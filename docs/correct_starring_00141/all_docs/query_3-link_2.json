        "text": "71 Metascore\n\n1994\n\n2 hr 7 mins\n\nDrama, Comedy\n\nR\n\nWatchlist\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nHomage to 1950s schlock director Edward D. Wood Jr., focusing on his friendship with Bela Lugosi. Wood was a surreal character: self-deluded, eternally optimisticâ€”and a heterosexual who enjoyed wearing women's clothing. He's become a cult icon thanks to the unintended humor of his schlock classics \"Glen or Glenda?\" (1952) and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1959)."
