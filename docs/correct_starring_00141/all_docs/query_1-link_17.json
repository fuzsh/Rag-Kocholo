Mankiewicz's Cleopatra—Martin Landau became a star as Rollin Hand in the hit television series Mission: Impossible. But the actor and his then-wife, Barbara Bain, who co-starred with him on the show, left after two seasons in a contract dispute. Neither of their careers were to recover. For almost two decades, Landau was just another working actor, appearing in seemingly endless low-budget throwaways and such made-for-television fare as The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island.\n\nHis renaissance from the industry scrap heap came when he was cast in Francis Coppola's Tucker: The Man and His Dream, which netted Landau critical kudos and an Oscar nomination. He offers an eye-opening performance as Abe Karatz, a New York financier who helps Preston Tucker (Jeff Bridges) start up an automobile manufacturing company. Finally, Landau had a movie role worthy of his gift for fleshing out character. His performance is at once entertaining and quite moving; the character of Karatz is at the core of the story, and Landau adds some genuine heart to what is an otherwise slickly made film. Those who had forgotten Landau existed, or had considered him a has-been (or worse, a never-was), had no choice but to acknowledge his talent.\n\nThe actor earned further acclaim, and a second Oscar nomination, in Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors, a high drama of ethics and morality in contemporary American society. Landau plays Judah Rosenthal, a pillar of his community whose neurotic, possessive mistress (Anjelica Huston) threatens to expose his extramarital activities. Judah feels he has no alternative but to initiate her murder. He at first is horrified by his decision, but soon comes to rationalize the action as being necessary to his survival. And in Tim Burton's Ed Wood, Landau was never better as the aging horror film star Bela Lugosi. He walked off with virtually every critics' prize, along with the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, for his beautifully rendered performance.\n\nBut perhaps his most revealing late-career role is in Mistress, in which Landau plays a character one senses he knows all too well: Jack Roth, an aging film producer who has come upon an old screenplay written by a movie purist/failed writer (Robert Wuhl). Roth feels that the script is a \"knockout,\" and wants to get it made. But there is a catch: The producer notes that the script \"does get heavy in places.\" It is, after all, about a painter who commits suicide. In order to secure funding for the project, Roth declares that perhaps the suicide part can be deleted—even though the act is the entire point of the story.\n\nRoth is an intriguing character. He takes his meetings not at Le Dome or another A-list eatery but at a glorified diner. He \"used to be a big shot at Universal,\" but blew his career after standing up to his boss in a show of integrity. If the project in question had been a success, Roth might have gotten away with his indiscretion. But it bombed, and for 15 years he has had to \"crawl around on my hands and knees to get a couple of bucks for something.\"\n\nLandau's departure from Mission: Impossible might be contrasted to Jack Roth's indiscretion. Thankfully for Landau, he eventually was able to reestablish himself on the A-list of Hollywood actors—albeit after too many years, and too many bad movies. Post-Ed Wood, he has been a busy actor, appearing in a range of roles. Perhaps his best was in the media satire Edtv, in which he stole his every scene as Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey's ailing stepfather.\n\n—Rob Edelman"
