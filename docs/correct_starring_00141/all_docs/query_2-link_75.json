Six decades later since she made her acting debut, Bain is still going strong and has shown no signs of stopping.\n\nBarbara Bain is an award-winning American actress best known for her role as Cinnamon Carter in the 1966 action television show Mission: Impossible. Her portrayal of Cinnamon Carter won her three Primetime Emmy Awards and received a Golden Globe Award nomination.\n\nBain has also appeared in many other television shows, including Space: 1999 (1975–1977), Walker, Texas Ranger (1998), and the classic 1957 legal drama series Perry Mason.

Her parents were Russian Jewish who immigrated to the United States. She grew up in Chicago, Illinois, where she experienced her childhood. She attended college at the University of Illinois and graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology.\n\nAfter her graduation, Bain developed an interest in dance. She moved to New York City to fulfil her dreams and even took on a dance class. But dancing did not advance her career as she had wished. As a result, she became a model.\n\nMildred had a short stint in modelling. She took on another bold step while young to study acting at the Theater Studio and later progressed to the Actors Studio, allowing her to become an actress.\n\nFamily, husband, children\n\nWhen Barbara Bain left Chicago for New York City to study acting, she met actor, producer, and cartoonist Martin James Landau at the Actors Studio. Initially, both Barbara and Martin had different impressions of each other’s characters, with Barbara portraying him as arrogant and stupid, while Martin thought of her as an empty-headed model.\n\nBarbara Bain and Martin Landau got married in 1957. They worked together on several television shows, including Mission: Impossible and Space: 1999. The couple shared two children (daughters), Susan Landau Finch and Juliet Landau.\n\nBut in 1992, Barbara and Martin divorced. They had shared 35 years of marriage, with Mildred describing it as half good and half not so good. But in the end, she had enough. After the divorce, Barbara never remarried.\n\nProfessional career\n\nMildred Bain did not start her career as an actress. Instead, she worked as a dancer but was never satisfied with it. That forced her to change to modelling. In the early 1950s, model Barbara Bain partnered with Vogue, Harper's, and other publications. But, unfortunately, modelling as a career did not satisfy her either.\n\nMildred was working as a model and dancer while living in Chicago. Then, she left Chicago for New York City to study acting.

Between 1961 and 1965, Bain made many appearances in TV shows on minor roles or as a guest. She even appeared in Perry Mason in 1964 but portraying a different character named Elayna Scott. After eight years of working as a TV actress, Mildred Bain never landed a significant role.\n\nThat all changed in 1966 when she portrayed Cinnamon Carter in the television series Mission: Impossible. She played a role perfectly for three seasons between 1966 and 1969 and appeared in 78 episodes. Because of her excellent character portrayal, Bain won three Emmy Awards in a row, 1967, 1968, and 1969 for Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series.\n\nAlthough actress Mildred Bain was excellent during her prime, it took her 31 years to make her first appearance in a film.
