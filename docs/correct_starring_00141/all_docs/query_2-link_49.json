Landau died at the age of 89 on Jul 15, 2017 in Los Angeles, CA .\n\nMINI BIO:\n\nMartin Landau was an American actor reminiscent of Raymond Massey but with a more desperate look. He seemed set for a prolific film career after his second-lead villain in Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\", but, in fact, made very few films, getting tied up in the television series \"Mission Impossible\" (as Rollin Hand) and \"Space 1999\" (as Commander John Koenig), in both of which he appeared with his wife Barbara Bain (1957-1993, divorced).\n\n(Source: available at Amazon Quinlan's Illustrated Dictionary of Film Character Actors).\n\nHONORS and AWARDS:\n\n.\n\nMartin Landau was nominated for three Academy Awards, winning one for Best Supporting Actor for Ed Wood (as Bela Lugosi) in 1994.\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nYearAwardFilm nameRoleResult1988Best Supporting ActorTucker The Man and His DreamAbeNominated1989Best Supporting ActorCrimes and Misdemeanors (1989)Judah RosenthalNominated1994Best Supporting ActorEd Wood (1994)Bela LugosiWon\n\n.\n\nHe was honored with one star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the category of Motion Pictures.\n\nBlogHub Articles:\n\nNo article for at this time.
