        "text": "For countless seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, the Southern California mansion known as Villa de la Vina has remained the home base. But that’s not the case for Jenn Tran’s season of The Bachelorette, which premiered on July 8. The latest installment of the dating franchise swapped its iconic mansion for another famous SoCal filming location: Hummingbird Nest Ranch. And while the contestants typically stay in the mansion for a good portion of each season, the franchise is mixing things up this time around. Instead, most of the season takes place internationally. Below, find out everything we know about the new season’s filming locations.\n\nWhere Was The Bachelorette Filmed?\n\nThe Bachelorette season 21 kicks off at the 130-acre property known as Hummingbird Nest Ranch in Santa Susana, California. Located about 30 minutes from Los Angeles, the property’s main villa encompasses 17,000 square feet with courtyards and sparkling water fountains. The Spanish-style architecture is marked by barrel tile roofing, white stucco walls, arched entryways, curved columns, tiled staircases, and detailed ironwork. Whether you need accommodations for a wedding or vacation, there are casitas, townhomes, and a cottage on the property that are all available to rent starting at $500 for a cottage that allows for up to four guests. The sprawling estate also features shaded groves of olive trees, a horse barn, manicured grass fields, and dramatic mountain views. It's certainly a dreamy destination for potentially meeting a soulmate.\n\n\"I feel like a new mansion is the perfect way to break the mold,” Tran, the show’s first-ever Asian American lead, told Entertainment Tonight. “I'm gonna bless it with some really good vibes.\"\n\nApart from The Bachelorette, Hummingbird Nest Ranch has been tapped as a filming location for many productions, including Claim to Fame (which is currently back for season three!) and The Last Thing He Told Me.\n\nTran’s season isn’t the first time the dating franchise has switched up locations. A few seasons during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were filmed at other places, including Matt James’s at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort in Pennsylvania and Katie Thurston’s at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort & Spa in New Mexico. Of course, prior to that, each season involved some sort of travel—domestic or international.\n\nThat brings us to the other twist in Tran’s season: Most of it was filmed internationally. At the end of the premiere episode, Tran notifies the remaining men vying for her heart that they won’t be staying at Hummingbird Nest Ranch. “We are doing something completely unprecedented that has never been done before,” she said. “We are going to Melbourne, Australia.”\n\nAlong with Australia, filming reportedly also took place in New Zealand and other locations. Stay tuned for more details as the season continues to roll out."
