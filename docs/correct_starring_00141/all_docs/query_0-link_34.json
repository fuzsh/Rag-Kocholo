        "text": "Earlier this month, the entertainment world lost a legend with the passing of Martin Landau. Let’s examine the role as Bela Lugosi in 1994’s Ed Wood that scored Landau his only statuette in a sixty-plus years career.\n\nNot to downplay a wonderful performance, but for those who looked at Martin Landau’s Oscar-winning work as Lugosi in Tim Burton’s Ed Wood and call it gospel truth (the film includes Lugosi on a profane rant against Karloff), keep in mind that, a) the film depicts only a short, pained part of Lugosi’s life, and b) the families of both Karloff and Lugosi denounced the film, though they were in the extreme minority.\n\n“I said to (Burton), ‘You have a 74-year old morphine-addicted alcoholic who has mood swings,’” recalls Landau. “That would be hard enough, but it had to be Bela Lugosi, who everyone knows. There are a lot of elements in Lugosi’s career as a man, in what he stood for, what he cared about, his successes, his disappointments. There were a lot of things I understood, intuitively and innately. I also saw a lot of humor. Because it’s a Tim Burton movie, there’s a certain kind of style. There can’t be a kitchen-sink kind of approach to a character. It is a comedy. It’s kind of extensive.” His daughter Juliet had a small role as a budding starlet in the film.\n\nIn a sad display of the superficial nature of the film world, Lugosi’s talent was often overshadowed by his Hungarian accent, which directors felt wouldn’t translate – perhaps literally – to comprehensive by American audiences. In the later years of his career, the actor attempted to “improve” his American voice, but never truly achieved it.\n\n“One of the things I did,” explains Landau, “I learned the accent, learned where the tongue goes, and I tried not to do it.” Basically, he exemplified a fight that Lugosi didn’t win – a Hungarian actor obviously trying to get rid of his natural voice, but still inadvertently hanging onto it.\n\nAlong with watching a few dozen of Lugosi’s films and even a few interviews for his role, Landau and the crew focused in on one sad image of Lugosi’s decline – one of the first mainstream celebrities to publically enter rehab, there’s an infamous tabloid photo of the man in his room at the center, his legs pencils, his body more gaunt than a starvation victim. To Lugosi, any publicity was good publicity, shown by a scene in the film where he welcomes paparazzi to take the shot.\n\n“It told me something about him,” says Landau. “(Lugosi) was made out of balsa wood, and about to break. He was a powerful actor, with enormous strength and force, but we didn’t get to see the kind of things he was capable of doing.”"
