Mistaken for a government agent by foreign spies, he's thrust into a perilous cross-country chase. Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a mysterious and alluring woman, aids him in his desperate struggle for survival. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this thrilling masterpiece of intrigue and mistaken identity is filled with iconic scenes, including the famous crop-duster sequence and the climactic Mount Rushmore showdown. It's a testament to Hitchcock's mastery over tension and suspense.\n\n2\n\nJohnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nReleased : 1994\n\nDirected by : Tim Burton\n\nEd Wood (Johnny Depp) is a passionate but troubled filmmaker, struggling in Hollywood's golden age. This biographical comedy-drama, directed by Tim Burton, chronicles Wood's life and his unconventional friendship with horror film legend Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose career was in decline. The movie explores the production of Wood's infamous B-movie classics like Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. Landau's exceptional portrayal of Lugosi earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Despite its humorous tone, Ed Wood remains a poignant tribute to one of cinema's most eccentric figures.\n\n3\n\nMartin Landau, Woody Allen, Mia Farrow\n\nReleased : 1989\n\nDirected by : Woody Allen\n\nJudah (Martin Landau) is a philandering eye doctor who wants to preserve his marriage, and his dangerous brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) comes up with what appears to be the only viable solution. Certain that his mistress (Anjelica Huston) is about to tell his wife (Claire Bloom) about his affair, Judah agrees to Jack's murderous plan. Twinned with Judah's tale is that of Cliff Stern (Woody Allen), a documentary filmmaker whose problems, which involve love and art, are tame but funny.\n\n4\n\nMatt Damon, Ed Norton, John Turturro\n\nReleased : 1998\n\nDirected by : John Dahl\n\nMike McDermott (Matt Damon) loses his money in a poker game against Russian gangster Teddy \"KGB\" (John Malkovich). Under pressure from his girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol), he promises to quit gambling. This lasts until his friend, Lester \"Worm\" Murphy (Edward Norton), gets out of prison and needs to pay off an old debt. The pair come close to earning the money back but are caught cheating. Then Mike finds out the debt is owed to Teddy and makes one last-ditch effort to beat the Russian.\n\n5\n\nMartin Landau, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Genevi√®ve Bujold\n\nReleased : 1996\n\nDirected by : Steve Barron\n\nA fairy answers a wish, bringing to life the puppet of woodcarver Geppetto (Martin Landau), who names him Pinocchio (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).\n\n6\n\nJohnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson\n\nReleased : 1999\n\nDirected by : Tim Burton\n\nIn the eerie, atmospheric film Sleepy Hollow, constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is dispatched from New York City to the secluded town of Sleepy Hollow. His task: investigate a series of beheadings rumored to be the work of a supernatural Headless Horseman. Backed by a star-studded cast including Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tassel and Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel, director Tim Burton weaves a chilling tale that combines elements of horror and mystery. The movie won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, a testament to its striking visual style. As Crane delves deeper into the mystery, he uncovers dark secrets that blur the line between reality and nightmare."
