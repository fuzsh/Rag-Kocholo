        "text": "“This is the most uncomfortable coffin I’ve ever been in. You are wasting my time!”\n\nThe Scoop: 1994 R, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray\n\nTagline: Movies were his passion. Women were his inspiration. Angora sweaters were his weakness.\n\nSummary Capsule: The story of a man who just had to live his dream, and the audience who just wished that he wouldn’t.\n\nHeather’s rating: Every time I hear Bela Lugosi’s name my mind starts running the Hanukkah song on a loop.\n\nHeather’s review: I disagree with Sue’s opinion of this film, although I do not, in her words, think that she is a big, nasty poopyhead. From what I’ve seen, she looks quite petite in her pictures, and I trust that she has commendable hygiene.\n\nEd Wood. Oh, Ed Wood. Unless you’ve been glossing over every review or article I’ve ever done, it’s safe to say that you know I LOVE MST3K and therefore have seen a couple of Mr. Wood’s films multiple times. If you travel the forums from time to time you’ll also know that I have spent actual money in these times of economic downfall to watch Plan 9 From Outer Space twice in theaters this past year. In my defense, both were Rifftrax viewings seen either live or on delayed broadcast and totally worth it.\n\nAll of this is to say that I was very familiar with Ed Wood as a director, but until I saw this film I had little knowledge of him as a person. I did know that he was passionate about the movies he made, and never let anyone tell him he couldn’t achieve his dreams. Has someone’s moxie ever inspired you to both cheer them on and punch them at the same time?\n\nI suspect that everyone who came across this man or his creations had that reaction (at least the latter). Ed Wood made some of the worst piles of dung to grace the silver screen, but he was unique among his fellow dung pile-ers in his unabashed love of making films. He didn’t care about all of the intricate details, or making things realistic, or even making sure that there weren’t shots revealing critical set pieces getting knocked over like the pieces of cardboard they were. Like a teenager on a date, Ed Wood just loved doing what he did; he didn’t care whether or not he was doing it right.\n\nIt must have been that child-like glee Johnny Depp was trying to tap into with his portrayal of the B movie auteur. In my opinion he ran the tap dry with this performance and gave Wood a wide-eyed, childish creepiness that doesn’t fit with how I imagine him. It was especially difficult to take the role seriously having first watched his nearly identical but ramped-up version of this performance in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. I kept looking for the purple top hat and tails.\n\nStill, Depp is enjoyable to watch, as is everyone in the movie, especially Martin Landau. Holy Inanimate Objects, that man did a fantastic Bela Lugosi. I suffered as Sue did, not really feeling for anyone, except I did feel for Mr. Lugosi. I was moved by the defeat in his eyes when talking about his career, and the pain of that second (made up) scene where he nearly commits a suicide and homicide and gets himself checked into rehab. I could even laugh at him for his Old Man Crotchetyness ™ when Ed kept yelling at him to roll around in freezing cold water at four AM for a shot. “F*** you! You come out here!” Indeed, Mr. Lugosi. Indeed.\n\nThe story is interesting and mostly true. Wood’s life and group of friends was so off the wall that it can’t have made anything but an intriguing story. The cinematography is fantastic and I love the look of it in all black and white. Aside from being monochromatic the way this film was shot, as well as the care taken in all the set details and the fantastically eerie score, make this movie have a really odd B movie quality to it. I love the film’s quirkiness, even though I would give its subject a good post-mortem kick.\n\nSue’s rating: Better than a long whiff of ether in a Civil War surgical tent!\n\nSue’s review: Ed Wood is a schlocky film about a schlocky writer/director of schlocky B movies. I could, in fact, stop my review right there, because I know this is a cult favorite, crafted by the fine hand of Tim Burton no less, and we’re a cult site and I’m supposed to feel the cult love, and if you can’t say something nice you shouldn’t say anything at all… *deep breath*… oh man, I’m sorry but this just sucked.\n\nI’ve got to be honest. I didn’t even watch Ed Wood to the absolute end. It wasn’t for lack of trying. I took five very determined shots at it, the last with a long run-up, a girding of the loins, and a liter bottle of Mountain Dew to keep me going. To no avail. I nodded off. Just plain nodded off. Every time. I wasn’t even tired! It was like Johnny Depp and his angora sweater sucked all of the oxygen out of the room. Don’t get me wrong, I think Johnny Depp is one of the best actors of my generation. In my wild, misspent youth, I lusted after Johnny Depp. I don’t even dislike Tim Burton. Heck, I loved Big Fish! I blame the sweater.\n\nMy guess is that the point of this movie was to showcase the great drive and enthusiasm of Mr. Wood in his production of countless craptastical movies. Maybe it’s all about the idea of success as a state of mind, or daring to live your dream, or reaching for the stars – even when they won’t return your calls and you’ve been served with several restraining orders.\n\nI wasn’t feeling it, folks. All I got was, “Holy cow, that guy is creeeeeepy.” His demeanor was too chipper, his smiles too manic, his monologues so rapid-fire that they deteriorated into white noise and my brain went all slushy under the onslaught. I mean, there are some funny lines, but quite of few of them were drowned in the ‘Golly gee, Mister, that’s just swell!’ schtick. Drowned, I tell you. Like puppies in a burlap sack.\n\nThe supporting characters really aren’t much better. Bela “don’t call me Boris!” Legosi is especially one nasty, temperamental, drug-addicted son of a biscuit. He’s a little sad, a little funny, a little edgy, a little pathetic and a little repellent. None of those things make me want to give him a hug, y’know? In fact, there are no characters whatsoever that I can cheer for, or that seem to have any appreciable depth. Despite that, the movie is certainly well acted, but only after you remind yourself that overacting is in the script.\n\nIn retrospect, I think that if a few external factors had been different, I might have had a better – at least cheerier – perspective on Ed Woods’ alleged culty sweetness. Those factors would have included large quantities of alcohol, mycologically produced hallucinogens and a large group of boisterous, roistering friends to share them with. Unfortunately, I have long since been riding the wagon, I’m allergic to certain varieties of mushroom and I like my friends a little too much to inflict this on any of them. I mean, what have they ever done to me??? Come to think of it, few of my friends roister. At least not when I’m around.\n\nNow I know there are folks out there who are even now screaming words like “heretic” and “apostate” and “shallow minded idiot” and even “big nasty poopyhead’, and to you all, I apologize.\n\nMaybe sometime, I’ll give Ed Wood another try. Maybe I won’t dislike it quite as much. Maybe I will.\n\nIn the meantime, keep that hate mail coming, as long as it makes you feel better about yourself, okay?\n\nIntermission:\n\nTor’s character seemed a lot more eloquent in Ed Wood than the real Tor Johnson ever sounded in the films he did. I say that without even a hint of sarcasm.\n\nThe crew used black and white because none of them had ever seen a color photo of Lugosi. No one had any idea what color his eyes were, and to look at Landau made up as Lugosi in color didn’t seem quite right.\n\nMartin Landau won an Oscar for the role of Bela Lugosi. I also want to mention how in awe I am that he learned a Hungarian accent and then learned how to speak it like a Hungarian trying not to talk in a Hungarian accent. Brain hurt yet?\n\nGroovy Quotes:\n\nBunny: How do you do it? How do you get all your friends to get baptized, just so you can make a monster movie? Ed Wood: It’s not a monster movie. It’s a supernatural thriller.\n\nBela Lugosi: They don’t want the classic horror films anymore. Today it’s all giant bugs. Giant spiders, giant grasshoppers… Who will believe such nonsense?\n\nEdward D. Wood, Jr.: I like to dress in women’s clothing.\n\nGeorgie Weiss: You’re a fruit?\n\nEdward D. Wood, Jr.: No, not at all. I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.\n\nGeorgie Weiss: You’re not a fruit?\n\nEdward D. Wood, Jr.: No, I’m all man. I even fought in W.W.2. Of course, I was wearing women’s undergarments under my uniform.\n\nEdward D. Wood, Jr.: [after Tor Johnson bumps into a scenery wall while walking through a door making the wall shudder] Ok, and CUT! PERFECT! PRINT IT!\n\nCameraman Bill: Don’t you wanna do another take Ed? Seems like big baldy had some problems gettin’ through that door.\n\nEdward D. Wood, Jr.: No, it’s fine. It’s real. You know, in actuality, Lobo would have to struggle with this problem every day.\n\nOrson Welles: Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else’s dreams?\n\nIf You Liked This Movie, Try These:"
