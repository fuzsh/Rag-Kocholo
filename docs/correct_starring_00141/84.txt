(1994) Always upbeat, uncompromising auteur struggles against a misunderstanding world to realize his unique artistic vision—only trouble is, he’s Johnny Depp as Ed Wood, and his visions are Glen or Glenda? and Plan 9 from Outer Space, with Martin Landau Oscaring (supporting actor) as Bela Lugosi. 35mm.

“Tim Burton’s very good film about a very bad film maker, has a cheerful defiance that would surely have appealed to Orson Welles, who was Ed Wood’s hero. Late in the film, Welles appears (played deftly by Vincent d’Onofrio, who really looks like him) to advise Wood that independence is everything and that an artist’s visions are worth fighting for. Mr. Burton, currently Hollywood’s most irrepressible maverick, has taken that credo to heart.”

– Janet Maslin, The New York Times

“SUBLIME ABSURDITY! [Wood] had the imaginative intensity of an artist with none of the craft, the dreams without the taste; he’s an auteur despite himself.”

– Richard Brody, The New Yorker
