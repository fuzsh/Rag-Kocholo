        "text": "Since the late 1970s, anglophone and German military literature has been fascinated by the Wehrmacht‘s command system, especially the practice of Auftragstaktik. There have been many descriptions of the doctrine and examinations of its historical origins, as well as unflattering comparisons with the approaches of the British and American Armies prior to their adoption of Mission Command in the late 1980s. Almost none of these, however, have sought to understand the different approaches to command in the context of a fundamental characteristic of warfare – friction. This book seeks to address that gap. First, the nature of friction, and the potential command responses to it, are considered, in order to develop a typology of eight command approaches, testing each approach to identify their relative effectiveness and requirements for success. Second, the British and German Armies’ doctrines of command during the period are examined, in order to reveal similarities and differences in relation to their perspective on the nature of warfare and the most appropriate responses. Third, the interaction of these different command doctrines is traced through a series of key battles, allowing the strengths and weaknesses of each to be highlighted and the typology to be tested. The result will be a new and deeper understanding of both the nature of command as a response to friction, and the factors that need to be in place in order to allow a given command approach to achieve success. The book therefore represents a sequel to my earlier work, Command or Control? Command, Training and Tactics in the British and German Armies, 1888-1918 (London: Cass, 1995), in that it takes the conceptual model of command developed there to a deeper level, and also takes the story up to the start of Second World War.\n\nA thread running through German military history has been the need to achieve victory in the face of potentially overwhelming odds, a consequence of Germany’s geopolitical situation. Following the Wars of Unification, attention became focused upon the threat of a simultaneous war against both France and Russia. As the army’s military elite recognized, such a war had the potential to ’turn into a monster, devouring ever larger masses of people, ever more resources, and, in due course, the military leaders as well’. To avoid such a catastrophe, it was necessary to seek a rapid decision. A strategy of attrition could not promise the necessary speed, so the German Army came to rely on the achievement of a conclusive victory on the battlefield - annihilation. In seeking to gain such a swift decision over a potentially more numerous opponent, the Army identified the requirement to maximize the effectiveness of the forces it had available. In recent years, two contrasting interpretations have been made concerning the means by which the German Army sought to resolve these challenges. These may be classified as the ’traditional manpower-centred approach’, proposed by Michael Geyer, and the ’progressive technology-centred approach’, developed by Arden Bucholz. This article seeks to chart a course between these two arguments. The focus is upon the philosophy of command at the operational level developed within the German General Staff and the means by which this was passed on to each new generation. Central to this philosophy was the concept of the Schwerpunkt.\n\nIn 1914, the German Army was widely considered to be the most powerful armed force on the planet. Its plan of operations for the opening stages of the war were breath-taking in their scale and ambition, though perhaps doomed to failure for precisely those reasons. Yet almost nothing has been written about the men who led that vast force into battle. Apart from the royal princes, not one of the fifty or so generals who commanded the field armies and corps of that army has been the subject of a biography in English, in stark contrast to, for example, the commanders of the British Expeditionary Force. Drawing on the statistical techniques developed by Daniel Hughes in his analysis of Prussian generals from 1870 to 1914, The King's Finest, this article seeks to present a collective examination of the backgrounds and careers of those fifty commanders.\n\nAt the beginning of July 1916, the British and French armies launched a massive offensive against the Germans along the Somme River. Surprised by both the intensity and ferocity of the Entente battle of material on the Somme, the German army was caught completely off guard and suffered high casualties, if not great loss of terrain. Over the course of the battle, the Germans were forced by superior Anglo-French weaponry and tactics to improvise a new defensive tactical doctrine. This article makes use of contemporary German ‘lessons-learned’ reports to explore the development of these new defensive tactics and show that the lessons-learned system refined during the battle allowed the German army to stay intellectually flexible despite the overwhelming pressures of the battle."
