        "text": "This article is an examination of the operational record of the World War Two German Panther tank during the Normandy Campaign of summer 1944. Challenging its perception as mechanically unreliable, this article argues Allied combat action was responsible for a large percentage of Panthers that were out of action. Secondly, the inferior resources of the German tank replacement and repair program were no match for superior Canadian Army practices during 1944. To support these arguments the author examines Canadian and German wartime primary documents as well as multiple secondary sources. D the summer of 1944 in Normandy, the German Panzerkampfwagen V medium tank, the Panther, was one of the most dangerous armoured opponents of the Anglo-Canadian armies. Its design is often described in postwar writing as having the best mixture of speed, armour, and weaponry on the Second World War battlefield. Due to this successful formula, some writers have held up this late war German panzer as t...\n\nOne of the enduring images of the desert war is that of the rapidly advancing Afrikakorps sweeping all before it. This is certainly what happened in April 1941 during the re-conquest of the Cyrenaica and Marmarica provinces of Libya. It led to considerable gains of terrain for the Axis, and losses in men and equipment for the Empire forces. The offensive culminated in the siege of Tobruk. This advance was against clear orders given to Rommel, namely, to await the arrival of 15. Panzerdivision in May 1941 before commencing operations. This was of course of major propaganda value, and it has shaped the image we have of Rommel today, with a victorious German force advancing rapidly, encircling and defeating all Empire forces before them. The modern assessment of Rommel’s initial offensive is that because it was conducted from an unsound logistical basis, it ultimately doomed the Axis effort in North Africa . This article considers what the situation in North Africa would have been had Rommel adhered to his orders. It is drawing on period documents and participant views.\n\nIn the early hours of 6 June 1944, the first reports of a major Allied operation were transmitted to the 12th SS Hitlerjugend Panzer Division. In anticipation of the long-awaited Allied invasion of occupied France, a company was sent to investigate the Caen area. Though the young soldiers of the division were uncertain of what actually awaited them, the first\n\nThe defeat of italy’s forces in North Africa over the winter of 1940/41 threatened Germany's 'Fortress Europe'. For his own security, Hitler felt that he had no option but to intervene on behalf of his ally. By the middle of February 1941, the first contingent of German support had reached Tripoli. It was not very large - in fact, it consisted of one general and two staff officers; but the general was a man called Rommel. As the commanding officer of the 'Ghost' Division in France, Major-General Erwin Rommel had won a reputation as a brilliant commander. His orders were to stabilize the situation. Rommel's force initially included only the Fifth Light Division. For the moment, he was simply expected to stiffen Italian resistance.\n\nAlthough much has been written about the arguments between Churchill and Auchinleck over when Eighth Army should move over to the offensive in the spring of 1942, the plans for that offensive have been almost entirely overlooked in the literature. Drawing on the records in the archives, and on Auchinleck’s personal correspondence, reveals a planning process characterised by disagreements between the senior officers involved, a lack of urgency, and a flawed operational concept."
