        "text": "A defence ministry building in Berlin is the site of a memorial to the plotters\n\nGermany has marked the 65th anniversary of the failed attempt by a group of officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and drive the Nazis from power.\n\nThe 20 July Plot saw Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg plant a bomb under a table inside the \"Wolf's Lair\", Hitler's command post in East Prussia.\n\nBut through a series of lucky circumstances Hitler was only slightly hurt, and the conspiracy was exposed.\n\nThe assassination attempt is one of the proudest traditions of the German army.\n\nDuring a ceremony in Berlin on Monday, hundreds of young recruits to the force took their ceremonial oath to a democratic Germany.\n\nMemorial\n\nFor many Germans, Von Stauffenberg is a hero - one of the few officers who chose to follow his conscience rather than orders, says the BBC's Oliver Berlau.\n\nThe plot in which he participated was the closest Hitler's opponents within the German armed forces ever got to killing him.\n\nThe attempted coup, which would have seen the establishment of a conservative military regime in Germany which was willing to negotiate an honourable peace, was led by senior military leaders like Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben and Gen Ludwig Beck.\n\nCol Von Stauffenberg was convinced Hitler had to be removed from power\n\nAs had been planned, Von Stauffenberg placed a briefcase containing explosives under the table next to Hitler inside the Wolf's Lair. After he left the building, he heard the bomb explode and assumed the German dictator was dead.\n\nBut an officer had moved the briefcase behind a sturdy leg of the table, and Hitler suffered only minor burns and concussion.\n\nUnaware, Von Stauffenberg flew to Berlin to join Von Witzleben and Beck and to take over using the German Home Army. However, they had hesitated and failed to take over the communications network.\n\nOnce it became known that Hitler was still alive, the plot crumbled.\n\nVon Stauffenberg and several of his co-conspirators were shot the same night in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, a building in Berlin which is still part of the defence ministry and the site of a memorial.\n\nDozens of others were later humiliated in a show trial and executed, hanged with piano wire from meat-hooks. Their deaths were filmed and shown to senior members of the Nazi Party and the armed forces.\n\nTHE 20 JULY PLOT\n\nStauffenberg placed a briefcase bomb under the oak table and left\n\nOne of the table's two heavy supports shielded Hitler from the blast\n\nLarge windows and wooden walls allowed pressure to escape\n\nAll present would have died if they had met in a bunker as usual\n\n1.
