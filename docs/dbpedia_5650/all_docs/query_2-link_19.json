        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nHYAZINTH GRAF STRACHWITZ VON GROSS-ZAUCHE UND Camminetz was the most decorated regimental commander, and one of the most effective panzer leaders, in the German Army.\n\nHe was one of only 27 men in the entire Wehrmacht to be awarded the Knight’s Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Of these he was the only one to receive grades of the decoration for both bravery and his command abilities, which led to the significant outcomes which merited the award. The other Diamonds recipients received awards for either their bravery and combat accomplishments, such as Erich Hartmann for his 352 aerial victories, or for their skill in command, such as Hans Hube and Walter Model. In the latter cases their men did the actual fighting and the award was as much for the units under their command as for them.\n\nVon Strachwitz’s rapid rise during World War II from a lowly captain to a lieutenant general, equivalent to a major general in the UK and US armies, was nothing short of extraordinary, and this in an army not lavish in granting promotions.\n\nHe fought in nearly all of the major campaigns—the invasions of Poland, France and Yugoslavia, and the important campaigns and battles in the east including Operation Barbarossa, the battles of Kiev, Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Kursk, the Baltic States and finally of Germany and his beloved Silesia—his service being almost a microcosm of World War II in Europe. In the course of these battles, not only did he win renown—becoming a legend among those who fought on the Eastern Front who gave him the title Panzer Graf (Armoured Count)—but was also wounded 14 times, probably was probably unique amongst the ranks of Germany’s senior officers and a testament to his leading from the front.\n\nSuch an extraordinary record of courage and command would have made him unique in any army of World War II. Yet he is a man of mystery, with very little known about him and nothing of substance yet been written. He is mentioned in countless books, articles and websites, but at most is only given a brief biographical outline, and even this is often inaccurate in parts. Günter Fraschke wrote a German-language biography in 1962, which, if largely factual, was nevertheless discredited for its inaccuracies and sensationalism and rejected by the Panzer Graf himself.\n\nUnfortunately the Panzer Graf himself wrote no memoirs; left no diary, and any notes and papers were lost along with his home in 1945. His records of service in the 16th Panzer Division were destroyed along with the division in the battle of Stalingrad in 1943. After a period of distinguished service with the elite Grossdeutschland Division, he served as commander of several ad-hoc units, some bearing his name, in a period when records, if kept at all, were scanty, or lost. It all makes for a rather threadbare paper trail. His comrades-in-arms have now all passed away, so there are no witnesses to his many battles and exploits.\n\nAll of this of course makes writing a full-length book about him enormously difficult. It is only possible with reference to the academies that he attended, the units he served in or alongside, the battles in which he fought and the many outstanding men he met or served with, as well as the events that shaped him and his world. This book must then of necessity deal not only with his life, but the broader topic of the times in which he lived.\n\nThe amount of research and effort required to tell his story, taking in a great many major and minor little-known events, was quite daunting, as was of course the scarcity of detailed information about him, yet he is indeed a subject worthy of the effort. Of equal importance was to produce a serious, studied and accurate representation of his life without the sensationalism that his exploits could easily lead to. I hope I have succeeded in this and beg forgiveness if I have lapsed occasionally in some descriptions that add colour and life to some of his actions. I hope also that this book fills the gap that currently exists, and gives him the proper recognition that he deserves, not only as the superlative warrior, war hero and panzer commander that indeed he was, but also as the decent and honourable man of integrity that he remained throughout his life.\n\nFinally, it must be remembered that all too often good men, through no fault of their own, are forced to serve an evil cause. He served his cause without adding to its criminality, and sought to end it honorably if the opportunity arose.\n\nLittle more could be asked of any man.\n\nONE\n\nEARLY YEARS\n\nTHE ARMOURED FORCE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TO DO battle. The surging horde from the east would soon be upon them, ready to tear the heart out of Christian Europe.\n\nIt could be a scene from Upper Silesia in 1945, where Lieutenant General Hyazinth Graf (Count) Strachwitz von Gross Zauche und Camminetz waited with his Panzerjäger (Tank-hunter) Brigade to block the Russians invading his beloved Silesian homeland. But instead it was Liegnitz, 9 April 1241, where the 20,000-strong army of Duke Henry II The Pious was preparing to fight a Mongol force of similar size. In his army were the flower of Silesian chivalry, among whom were several knights and retainers of the von Strachwitz family.\n\nThe Mongol horde was a diversionary force, sent to plunder parts of Poland and divide the Christians while the main force invaded Hungary. At Liegnitz the Mongols surrounded and destroyed the Polish and Silesian cavalry, before attacking the infantry from the flanks and routing them. Duke Henry attempted to flee but was caught and beheaded. To count the dead, the Mongols cut off the right ear of the fallen, filling nine large bags with their grisly trophies. The entire von Strachwitz contingent, 14 family members and their retainers, was wiped out. But it was not in vain, for the casualties suffered by the Mongol diversionary force made them loathe to proceed further, and they retreated to join their main force. It was believed by many that Duke Henry’s sacrificial battle had forced the Mongol retreat and he was declared a hero.\n\nThe von Strachwitz family was proud of their ancestors’ heroic stand, which set a precedent for military service and glory which then became part of the family ethos. Over the years the family garnered wealth, titles and position. The brothers Christof and Maximillian were created barons (Freiherr) in 1630. Johann Moritz von Strachwitz (1721–81) was the apostolic vicar and bishop of Breslau, highlighting the family’s strong and enduring connection with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nMoritz Graf von Strachwitz (1822–47) was a renowned lyric poet, indicating that not all in the family were involved in, or famous for power and politics; however Hyazinth Graf von Strachwitz (1835–71) resumed the prior trend by entering the German Reichstag.\n\nThe family became wealthier through the time-honoured way of the aristocracy—marriage to wealthy heiresses. It was much easier than having to work for a living, tending to unprofitable estates or through vulgar commerce, which at that time were below the diginity of the aristocracy. This way they added Zauche and Camminetz to their name: the former came from the marriage of Nicholas von Strachwitz to Katherine von Zauche, the daughter of a prominent Breslau family, added to distinguish the line from the Strachwitzs of Gabersdorf; the latter was added by the acquisition of the village and estate of Kaminetz and Dombrowka by Karl von Strachwitz.\n\nThe family seat was in Gross-Stein, named for the limestone deposits in the ground. The manor house and estate were purchased in 1808, then steadily built up to comprise an estate of 10,150 acres, of which 2,920 acres were farmland, 6,764 were forest and 41 acres consisted of gardens and parkland. The estate also held a quarry, limekiln and distillery. The family used it as their principal residence until 1944 when it was turned into a hospital.\n\nSilesia had a very chequered history, forming at times part of Greater Moravia, Bohemia, Poland, the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Prussia and finally the Greater German Reich, first under the Hohenzollern kaisers and then under the Third Reich. The Poles, when their country was not being dismembered and part of another empire, laid claim to it, a claim which would later involve von Strachwitz in fighting to keep it German, as for him it had always been.\n\nHyacinth was born on 30 July 1893, his parents’ second child. His mother was Maria Aloysia Hedwig Frederike Therese Octavia Grafin (Countess) von Matuschka and Freiin (Baroness) von Toppaczan und Spaetden, named after many ancestors, who was just 20 years old when she gave birth to her son. His father was also named Hyacinth (1864–1942), in accordance with the family tradition that dictated the first-born son was always named Hyacinth after St Hyacinth, a Dominican preacher who was canonised in 1594. The saint was connected to the family by marriage in the distant past. Being very proud of the connection, the family had venerated the saint ever since. The Panzer Graf later adopted to spell his Christan name “Hyazinth,” particularly during his army career, and his army documentation reflects this. Hyazinth was particularly close to his older sister, Aloysia, born on 28 June 1892. His younger siblings were Celaus, born 1 December 1894, Elisabeth born 20 December 1897, Manfred born 17 April 1899—who also became a panzer commander in World War II—Mariano, born 28 November 1902 and Margarethe, born 12 July 1905.\n\nHyazinth’s upbringing was one of aristocratic privilege and luxury, tempered by strict discipline and devotion to church, family and class. Tradition and responsibility went hand in hand with noble rank and lineage, and these were to be young Hyazinth’s guiding principles throughout his life. Even in the less class-conscious army of Nazi Germany he insisted on being addressed as Graf and was singularly conscious of his family history and status. Living on a large agricultural estate, horsemanship and farming were a part of his daily life, and it was especially in riding that he excelled, taking to it with a natural talent. So his young life was sheltered and, for his time, idyllic. Given his rural background and interest in an outdoor life it was only natural that he would be steered towards a military career, the more so as under Kaiser Wilhelm II (r. 1888-1918), Germany became a militarised state with the army, especially the officer corps, enjoying a high prestige within all levels of society. It was expected, almost incumbent upon higher-ranking families to have at least one son enter the military.\n\nFor its part, the army looked to the higher classes to supply its officers while the elite guards regiments looked to the aristocracy to provide theirs. When it came to advancement, high social rank was more important than educational achievement, thus, the dull-witted or lazy scions of the aristocracy were treated, initially in their careers, equally to the intelligent and industrious, and well ahead of any diligent or clever members of the middle classes.\n\nThere were two main routes to becoming an officer: candidates from rich and upper-class families went through the cadet school system, while the less privileged went straight to a regiment. To do this, an officer aspirant had to be recommended by the colonel of the regiment. Often the aspirants were known to the colonel or another ranking officer, or had some other connection to the regiment. The potential officer then had to spend six months in the ranks as an advantageur or officer candidate, which gave him a few privileges but also saddled him with high expectations and sometimes extra bullying and punishments to test his mettle. He had to either provide evidence of his higher educational qualifications or pass an examination. On completion of his service in the ranks and proof of his leadership abilities and character, he had to be approved in turn by his future company, battalion and regimental commanders. This method of promoting from the ranks was widely used by the 1930s, with front-line soldiers being designated as officer candidates for a lengthy period before being sent to an officer candidate school.\n\nThe alternative route saw boys, often as young as ten, enter one of the eight cadet preparatory schools in Germany, and remain there until seeking admission to the central cadet school at Gross Lichterfelde—the German equivalent to the British Sandhurst or American West Point—at the age of 15. Hyazinth von Strachwitz attended Whalstatt Junior Cadet School in Silesia, a popular choice for the Silesian upper classes. Johann von Ravenstein, who would earn a Pour le Merite in the Great War, and achieve fame fighting the British under Erwin Rommel in Africa, was a graduate, as was the fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen, and General Erwin von Witzleben.\n\nThe life that von Strachwitz experienced at Wahlstatt was austere and often harsh. Discipline was strict, and bullying rife. The staff was generally second rate, and a great deal of control was left to the older boys, with a head boy called the aclteuter in charge of each dormitory. His word was law and most were little dictators lording over their charges with little restraint or supervision from the senior staff. Punishments for the smallest infractions, real or imagined, were routine, and at times bordering on the sadistic. No matter, for it all ostensibly built character.\n\nThe young von Strachwitz wore a military uniform, his classes were called companies, with teachers holding nominal military rank. Drill and discipline were the watchwords of the school and every activity was carried out to shouted orders, even praying and sleeping.\n\nThe school was deeply unpopular with most, if not all of its students, and Hyazinth von Strachwitz would have been no exception. Manfred von Richthofen disliked it so much that he expressed his poor opinion of it and his contempt for its staff in his memoirs.\n\nFrom Whalstatt, von Strachwitz went on to the Central Cadet School at Gross Lichterfelde, on the southern outskirts of Berlin, where he would live and study until he received his commission. The Kaserne was a rather ugly red-brick building whose cornerstone was laid on 1 September 1873 in the presence of the Kaiser himself. The original construction included an administration building, residential area for senior officers, and two chapels, Catholic and Protestant. Later additions included a barracks, mess hall, stables, gymnasium, shooting ranges and a hospital. All this was constructed for the princely sum of nine million marks, an enormous amount of money for the time. As befitted Germany’s premier cadet school, the staff was highly competent. In 1911 Lichterfelde had a staff of 72 real officers—as opposed to the mostly nominal or low rankers at Wahlstatt—and military instructors, as well as a civilian staff of 41 professors, teachers, chaplains and doctors. Its academic status was equivalent to the German Gymnasium, or senior high school, meaning that basic education subjects were given priority alongside military studies and physical education. Its guiding principles were obedience, comradeship and duty. These were not just hollow words, but concepts for the cadets to live by and follow.\n\nA wide range of subjects were on offer for the 1,000 cadets, and Hyazinth would have studied mathematics, history, drawing, geography and languages, ranging from Latin, English and German to French. Military studies were a compulsory part of the curriculum. The academic subjects were studied in the mornings, with the afternoons reserved for sport, which included football, tennis, hockey, riding and fencing. Hyazinth proved to be an excellent fencer and swordsman and was well above average in athletics, but it was in horsemanship that he excelled, becoming the top in his class.\n\nThree meals a day were provided, with breakfast eaten standing up, a practice which Princess Louise of Prussia—the youngest of whose three sons attended Lichterfelde in 1907—found “strange and bad for their health.”1 She also disapproved of the fact that the boys did not bathe in the evenings, since the military governor of the college at the time, Captain von Gartner, did not regard personal hygiene important. It was all she could do to persuade him to allow the cadets a small jug of water for this purpose. His replacement, Freiherr (Baron) von Schleintz, was a little more amenable, but by this time the princess was thoroughly sick of fighting the system.\n\nThe best of the cadets, which would have included von Strachwitz, were often called upon to attend the Kaiser on special occasions at the Emperor’s Neues Palais (New Palace) at Potsdam. Here duties included waiting on the tables of the great and mighty—ambassadors, generals, ministers and visiting royalty—with one privileged cadet standing directly behind the Kaiser’s chair, often for very long periods of time (causing the future General Ravenstein to almost faint on one occasion). However this was a small price to pay for the privilege of overhearing the Kaiser’s tabletalk. Other duties included running errands and messages, as well as any other tasks required by senior courtiers. Notwithstanding the lowly nature of these tasks, to serve was considered an honour, and the cadets would have vied for the opportunity. Just to be in the corridors of power and overhear privileged conversations was considered enough for some. The court marshal, Graf Robert Zedlitz-Triitschler, was a Silesian nobleman and landowner who would have been aware of the young von Strachwitz and may well have kept a paternal eye on him.\n\nPhysical fitness was vital, with emphasis on gymnastics, which was practised daily. The best gymnasts were expected to leap from a springboard over two rows of cadets interlocking their rifles with fixed bayonets. Duelling, although forbidden and not commonplace, still happened in secret, as a cadet’s honour, like an officer’s, was paramount. The scars often inflicted during these encounters were worn with pride.\n\nThe regime was demanding, but for von Strachwitz—young, fit, smart enough to handle the academic side, and totally committed to sports and the outdoor life—the experience as a whole was an enjoyable one, and far removed from his time at Wahlstatt. Von Ravenstein, von Richthofen, von Kleist and others had similar appreciation for Lichterfelde, and given the future careers of these men it could be said that the cadet school was hugely successful in its raison d’être—turning out accomplished future officers.\n\nThe young Graf von Strachwitz would have enjoyed his time there, mixing with an exclusive group of young men with similar backgrounds, interests and prospects to himself. The physical life and comradeship appealed, and it allowed for free rein and appreciation of his horsemanship, the love of which would stand him in good stead for his career. Prowess with women was equally prized by the testosterone-charged young cadets. The cadets were considered a good catch by most young women, and with his dark good looks von Strachwitz undoubtedly attracted some attention.\n\nAs in many exclusively male structured societies, homosexuality almost certainly existed, and although forbidden, was rarely brought to light as exposure would have demeaned the reputation of the cadet school and indeed the whole of the officer corps. There was a major scandal in Germany in 1907 when accusations of homosexuality were made that involved the Kaiser’s senior aides-de-camp, including his close friend and confidante Prinz (Prince) Phillip zu Eulenburg, whose friendship with von Moltke, a cavalry officer and military commander of Berlin, raised eyebrows. The scandal was in reality part of a court power play to remove von Eulenburg from the Kaiser’s close circle since, apart from jealousy, there were those who considered von Eulenburg’s influence on the Kaiser to be far too pacifist. The Kaiser abandoned von Eulenburg and his ADCs, and insisted that von Moltke sue in order to clear his name and prevent any tarnishing of the Kaiser by association. In four trials over two years, a whole lurid tale of perversion and homosexuality came out. The accusation of tawdry orgies in the Garde du Corps, von Strachwitz’s regiment of choice, would have particularly concerned him at the time.\n\nScandals at the top and in the Garde du Corps notwithstanding, Gross Lichterfelde enjoyed a high reputation throughout German society. Among its many graduates were Colonel General Hans Guderian, father of the German Panzer arm (graduated 1907); Manfred von Richthofen; Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, army group commander on both Western and Eastern fronts; Werner von Blomberg, War Minister under Hitler, Erwin von Witzleben, a major conspirator against Hitler; Field Marshal von Hindenburg, president of the Weimar Republic and World War I army commander; Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, army group commander of Army Group North in the invasion of Russia; Field Marshal von Manstein, commander of Army Group South in Russia; Franz von Papen, chancellor of the Weimar Republic; and Reichmarshall Herman Goering, Luftwaffe commander-in-chief. Three thousand Lichterfelde graduates gave their lives for Germany in World War I. So important was it to Germany’s military officer corps and ethos that after Germany’s defeat in 1918, the Allies insisted on its closure, accurately assessing it as a hotbed of Prussian militarism. It became a state high school and later the barracks for Hitler’s bodyguard regiment, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler.\n\nOn graduating from Lichterfelde, Hyazinth von Strachwitz’s name was submitted for commissioning to the elite Garde du Corps, the personal bodyguard of the German Emperor. Founded in 1741 by Frederick the Great, it was the premier regiment of the German Army, ranking higher even than the Emperor’s Foot Guards. Garrisoned in Potsdam, it formed part of the elite 1st Guards Cavalry Division. The Garde du Corps’ officers were almost exclusively aristocrats. In 1890, 98% of the corps’ officers were noble, and although members of the middle classes were admitted, they occupied the technical, clerical and quartermaster positions, thus relieving the aristocrats of the boring but very essential service tasks. After 1908 the Kaiser began recruiting more army officers from the middle classes, but by 1914 the process was still incomplete and had barely started to take effect in the elite guards regiments.\n\nThe Kaiser’s attitude to his guards was summed up in his statement that with them, “I found my family, my friends, my interests, everything I had previously missed.” In 1891 he addressed new recruits to his guard:\n\nYou have sworn me allegiance. That, children of my guard, means that you are now my soldiers. You have given yourselves over to me body and soul. There is only one enemy for you and that is my enemy, with the present socialist agitation it may be that I shall order you to shoot down your own families, your brothers, yes your parents without a murmur.2\n\nAfter receiving the Kaiser’s approval, von Strachwitz was commissioned; the regiment now owned him body and soul. It was his second, and more immediate family. He was expected to wear his uniform everywhere, civilian clothes or mufti being an inferior form of dress. Being deprived of the right to wear the uniform was a singular dishonour. Captain Hoenig, a crippled veteran of the Franco-Prussian War and a military historian who dared to criticise the General Staff, was deprived of his right to wear the uniform by a kangaroo “Court of Honour” consisting of officers with whom he had served, a judgement which disgraced him in German eyes.3\n\nHis new uniform gave Hyazinth entrée to the best social circles and restaurant tables, with unquestioned respect from a public conditioned to honour and admire the military. In the street, civilians made way for him, while ladies would have discreetly admired him, seeing first his uniform and then his face.\n\nHis life consisted of riding, manoeuvres, watching an NCO supervise his soldiers’ drill, and an endless round of visits and dinners where he was expected to drink prodigiously, but always hold his liquor. A move towards temperance in 1910 was only partially successful, and heavy drinking remained a normal part of garrison life. There was also the opera and numerous balls. The polka had waned in popularity, the gavotte was in but fading, while the waltz was perennially popular. Von Strachwitz would have been expected to dance every dance.\n\nMilitary manoeuvres and war games involving the Garde du Corps were invariably attended by the Guards’ commander-in-chief—the Kaiser—meaning that the Guards were always on the winning side. A feature of these war games was that each officer participating acted one rank higher to his own, testing his ability for higher responsibility and command. Foreign observers often attended these manoeuvres, the military correspondent of British newspaper The Times being particularly scathing of the manoeuvres he observed in 1911:\n\nThe infantry lack dash, display no knowledge of the ground, are extremely slow in their movements, offer vulnerable targets at medium ranges, ignore the service of security, perform the approach marches in old-time manners, are not trained to understand the connection between fire and movement, and seem totally unaware of the effect of modern fire.\n\nHowever as to the cavalry he had this to say: “The cavalry drill well and show some beautifully trained horses, while the cavalry of the Guard is handled well.”4\n\nAs a lieutenant von Strachwitz earned less than £60 per year, a salary which would rise over time to £120. It was certainly not enough to maintain the lifestyle expected of a cavalry guards officer, so an allowance from home was a necessity. This ensured that only men from wealthy families would try to join the elite Guards units, let alone the Guard cavalry, especially the Garde du Corps. Equestrian and uniform costs were essential and could be considerable. Officers were proud of their horses, purchasing the very best, along with the best equipment and accessories they could afford. Von Strachwitz was expected to maintain nine different uniforms, for gala, guard, gold society, street, dancing, service, light service, court and party duties. He also had to provide a cuirass, and a gold parade helmet surmounted with the imperial eagle, which was unique to the Garde du Corps.\n\nVon Strachwitz might have perhaps spared a thought for the ordinary soldiers, who earned less than a penny a day; however, it is very unlikely that he would have given them the slightest consideration. The gulf between officers and men in all units, but especially the Guards, was so great as to be unbridgeable. It would take World War I, together with Hitler’s military expansion, his dislike for aristocratic officers in general, and increased promotion through the ranks to change all that.\n\nIn 1912 von Strachwitz attended the Cavalry School in Hanover, a recognition of his equestrian ability and a clear sign that his talent had been noted, and that he was on the road to eventual senior rank. The cavalry school was renowned throughout Europe for the quality of its horses and instruction. It had a staff of three officers, and took 133 students of whom 91 belonged to the cavalry and 42 to the horse artillery. The course took one year, with the more proficient, like von Strachwitz, being given an extended course of another year. Three years earlier, in 1908/09, Paul von Kleist had attended the Cavalry School. He would rise to command 14 divisions, including the 16th Panzer Division in which von Strachwitz would serve in 1941.\n\nVon Strachwitz’s time at Hanover was spent learning advanced horsemanship, dressage, hurdles jumping, cavalry drill and advanced tactics. Sports were again on the agenda and this included hunting with a hound pack personally provided by the Kaiser as a special gift. There being no foxes in the area, the officers had to be content with hunting wild pigs.\n\nWhile he was at the cavalry school the 1916 Olympics would have been clearly in von Strachwitz’s sights. There is no doubt that he would have made the team and quite likely been a medal contender, had not World War I intervened.\n\nDuring his sojourn at the school von Strachwitz almost certainly studied the book just published by the military theorist General Friedrich von Bernhardi, Deustchland und der Nächste Krieg (Germany and the Next War). It would have been enough to set his pulse racing, for what young officer does not long to go to war. But of course junior officers’ desires are of no consequence. What does matter is what the politicians and generals think, and with barely more restraint they too longed for war. It would not be long in coming.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.
