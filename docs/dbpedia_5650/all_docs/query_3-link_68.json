If you spot a mistake, please help with fixing it.\n\nThe German Reich (or often just referred to as Germany for short in community parlance) is the current incarnation of Germany. After the collapse of the German Empire in the November Revolution of 1918/19 after WW1 the Weimar Republic was proclaimed, named after the German city where its constitutional convention was held. The troubled Weimar Republic would exist until 1933 when the NSDAP seized power and transformed the country into a fascist dictatorship led by Adolf Hitler. By 1936 the NSDAP had cemented its power, having purged most of the opposition, and thus could focus on preparing for the next war.\n\nGermany was the primary Axis Power in the European Theatre. Historically, the German Reich precipitated the Second World War by attacking Poland on 1 September 1939, and would go on to establish a brief but notorious hegemony over continental Europe and the German Reich closed down the European Theatre of the Second World War through its surrender and fall between 4 May and 9 May 1945.\n\nGermany is in many ways \"the star of the show\" in Hearts of Iron IV, with both historical and technical precedence, as it acts as the primary driving force of many early-game events in historical playthroughs and is also usually the instigator of World War II, with many of the in-game events and focus trees tailored to bring about a conflict roughly comparable to the real-life counterpart. That being said, the player can freely change the course of events and either change the course of Germany's path or steal the spotlight as another country.\n\nGeography[edit | edit source]\n\nIn 1936, the German Reich is one of the largest countries in Europe, spanning parts of both Western and Central Europe from the Rhine to Silesia, and from the North and Baltic Seas to the Alps. Clockwise from the north, Germany borders Denmark, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Additionally, the exclave of East Prussia runs from the Baltic Sea to the north to Lithuania to the northeast and has Poland to the east, south, and west. The border states of Rhineland and Moselland are demilitarised in 1936, and the German Reich cannot move forces into the area until it completes the Rhineland national focus, or if it gets involved in a war before doing the Rhineland national focus.\n\nThe coastline consists mostly of flat, arable land and the East Frisian marshes, which together form part of the North European Plain. Much of the German interior is heavily forested, most prominent being the Black Forest region near the Alsatian border. Foothills dominate the Czechoslovakian border. The southern border with Switzerland and Austria is somewhat mountainous, although very little Alpine territory actually resides within prewar German borders; Lake Constance (the Bodensee) forms part of this southern border with Switzerland and Austria. The Rhine and Danube rivers both run partially through Germany towards the North Sea and the Black Sea respectively, whilst the Elbe, Oder, and Weser all run to the German coastline and the major ports of Hamburg, Stettin, and Bremen. The Kiel Canal traverses the German state of Schleswig-Holstein to connect the North and Baltic seas, allowing German and allied vessels to bypass the Danish straits.\n\nThere are many large urban areas in Germany, and most German states host at least one major city. The capital, Berlin, and the regional hubs Frankfurt and Munich are the most important cities from a strategic point of view, and the large Rhine-Ruhr conurbation in the northwest is also a vital, highly industrialized region. Germany's largest naval bases are situated at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, and the nation has a generally high infrastructure level, even by European standards.\n\nEvents[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: German events\n\nNational focus[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: German national focus tree\n\nGermany, as one of the seven major powers, has a unique national focus tree.\n\nThe German national focus tree can be divided into 6 branches and 3 Sub-branches:\n\nFour Year Plan Branch\n\nThis is the economic branch and improves Germany's industry by adding factories, adds a research slot, builds fort lines around Europe in the East and West and also allows Germany to choose between turning Hungary and Romania into puppets or gaining even more factories. At the end of the branch, if Germany is Fascist, it allows them to create a set of Reichskommissariats, which are unique puppets that allow for more effective resource extraction and administration of occupied territories while at war.\n\nAir Innovations Branch\n\nThis branch improves Germany's air force and speeds up research of nuclear weapons and rockets.\n\nArmy Innovations Branch\n\nThis branch improves Germany's land forces and allows for an alliance with the Soviet Union.\n\nRhineland Branch\n\nThe Fascist branch opens up the aggressive expansion across Europe, allowing Germany to go to war with the Soviet Union, and to befriende either China or Japan. It leads to the Anschluss sub-branch with more aggressive expansion and war options.\n\nAnschluss Sub-branch\n\nThis sub-branch under the Rhineland branch is full-on aggressive expansion, as it allows Germany to annex several states and to ally with or declare war on several countries. Among other things, it leads to the annexation of Austria and Poland, the partitioning of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Greece and finally war with Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Switzerland. It also allows Germany to ally with Hungary, Italy and Nationalist Spain. Additionally, the sub-branch also contains the option to befriend Poland and Czechoslovakia instead of just annexing and partitioning them, respectively.\n\nNaval Rearmament Branch\n\nThis branch improves Germany's navy and befriends the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway and Sweden as well as the Netherlands.\n\nOppose Hitler Branch\n\nThis branch allows Germany to remove Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP from power via civil war and restore the German Monarchy to pursue a democratic or non-aligned path.\n\nReturn of the Kaiser Sub-branch\n\nThis sub-branch restores Germany's monarchy under Wilhelm II, re-creating the German Empire that fell in 1918 and gives war goals against the British and the French, and allows for restoring the Italian and Austro-Hungarian monarchies; Germany can also choose to be subordinate to the British and ally them while fighting against communist France. It also allies with eastern nations in order to crush the communist threat of the Soviet Union in the east.\n\nThe Monarchy Compromise Sub-branch\n\nThis sub-branch creates a constitutional monarchy; it can happen under both Kaisers Wilhelm II and Wilhelm III. It creates a faction with Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Finland in order to crush the Soviet Union and other communist factions (like France and any other country that turns communist through its focus tree). It also adds one more research slot than the regular five slots and gives boosts to nuclear technology.\n\nTechnology[edit | edit source]\n\nArmy Technology Naval Technology Air Technology Electronics & Industry\n\nSupport Weapons II (1939)\n\nInfantry Equipment I\n\nInfantry Equipment II (1939)\n\nEarly Truck\n\nMotorized\n\nInterwar Armored Car\n\nParatroopers I (1939)\n\nMountain Infantry I\n\nSupport Equipment\n\nEngineer Company I\n\nRecon Company I\n\nGreat War Tank\n\nLight Tank I\n\nLight Tank II\n\nMedium Tank I (1939)\n\nHeavy Tank I\n\nArtillery\n\nAnti-Air\n\nInterwar Artillery (1939)\n\nAnti-Tank (1939)\n\n1936 Destroyer Hull\n\nPassive Sonar\n\nBasic Depth Charges\n\n1936 Cruiser Hull\n\n1940 Cruiser Hull (1939)\n\nBasic Cruiser Armor Scheme\n\nInclined Belt Armor Scheme (1939)\n\n1936 Heavy Ship Hull\n\n1936 Carrier Hull (1939)\n\n1936 Submarine Hull\n\nBasic Light Battery\n\nBasic Medium Battery\n\nBasic Heavy Battery\n\nImproved Heavy Battery (1939)\n\nImproved Ship Torpedo Launcher\n\nTurreted Secondary Battery\n\nTransport Ship\n\nContact Mine\n\nMinelaying Submarine\n\nWithout Man the Guns:\n\nDestroyer II\n\nLight Cruiser II\n\nHeavy Cruiser II\n\nHeavy Cruiser III (1939)\n\nBattlecruiser I\n\nBattleship II\n\nBattleship III (1939)\n\nCarrier III (1939)\n\nSubmarine II\n\nTransport Ship\n\nBasic Small Airframe\n\nBasic Medium Airframe\n\nInter-War Large Airframe\n\nBombs\n\nLight MG\n\nCannons I\n\nAircraft Construction\n\nEngines II\n\nWithout By Blood Alone:\n\nClose Air Support I\n\nClose Air Support II (1939)\n\nFighter I\n\nNaval Bomber I\n\nHeavy Fighter I (1939)\n\nTactical Bomber I\n\nStrategic Bomber I\n\nSynthetic Oil Experiments\n\nOil Processing (1939)\n\nFuel Refining I\n\nFuel Refining II (1939)\n\nAdvanced Machine Tools (1939)\n\nDispersed Industry IV (1939)\n\nConstruction IV (1939)\n\nDecimetric Radar (1939)\n\nComputing Machine (1939)\n\nWithout La Resistance:\n\nEncryption -

In Europe, only Italy has positive relations with the German Reich. The Treaty of Versailles demilitarized Germany's border with Belgium, Luxembourg, and part of the Netherlands and France. The German Reich is the leader of the Axis at the start of the game but has no allies yet at the beginning of the grand campaign. Following the 1.5 patch, Germany is able to form the German Empire through national focus, and the Greater German Reich or Holy Roman Empire through decisions. If Germany becomes Democratic, they may also form the European Union through a decision (West Germany may also form the EU if it is divided by the Yalta Conference, but East Germany cannot form the EU).\n\nIn terms of cores, outside of the cores granted through any of the formable nations, Germany can also gain cores on Austria (either through the Anschluss focus, or through an event that will fire off if Germany is either Democratic or Non-Aligned and in a faction with Austria - said event has a 90% chance of giving the positive answer, which will annex Austria and core them), West Poland (Danzig can be cored through Danzig or War even if Poland refuses; if the USSR conquers Poland and secedes West Poland, Germany will gain cores on all of West Poland, even if they took Oppose Hitler after signing the pact; Monarchist Germany can gain cores on Danzig, Posen, and Katowice if they do the focus \"Danzig for Guarantee\" and Poland accepts; Democratic Germany can regain Danzig and Poznan if they are in the same faction as Poland, Poland is Democratic or Non-aligned, Germany has completed the focus The Big Red Menace, Poland is at war with the USSR, and Poland has lost more than 30% of their victory points to the USSR), Alsace-Lorraine (if Germany takes Reintegrate Luxembourg and Alsace-Lorraine - which also cores Luxembourg - or is Monarchist and takes Reinstate Imperial Possessions), and the Sudetenland (if Germany either does the focus Demand Sudetenland and both the allies and Czechoslovakia agree, or if Czechoslovakia completes the focus \"Deliver Sudetenland\").\n\nWhile Germany is ordinarily the aggressor in Hearts of Iron IV, several nations can gain war goals on it and attack Germany first.\n\nFrance\n\nItaly\n\nPoland\n\nSoviet Union\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nPolitical parties[edit | edit source]\n\nPolitical party Ideology Popularity Party leader Country name Is ruling?

military and civilian factories, rounded up.\n\nThe German industrial capacity is formidable. Germany possesses the largest military production capacity out of all European countries and its civilian industry is on par with the other European major countries. The only thing Germany lacks is a sizable naval production capacity, something that eventually needs to be addressed in order to challenge the navies of other countries.\n\nResources[edit | edit source]\n\nYear\n\nOil\n\nAluminum\n\nRubber\n\nTungsten\n\nSteel\n\nChromium 1936 3 (-1) 137 (-34) 0 5 (-1) 412 (-103) 5 (-1) 1939 7 (-2) 139 (-35) 12 (-3) 6 (-2) 433 (-108) 6 (-2)\n\nNumbers in red indicate how many resources are reserved for export due to trade laws.\n\nAs far as resources are concerned, Germany falls a little short compared to the United Kingdom and France. While Germany has access to a large amount of steel and a good amount of aluminum, they have a severe shortage of everything else and can easily become dependent on foreign import to fuel their military apparatus. Luckily, the Rubber and Oil shortage can be at least partially mitigated with synthetic resource refineries while metals (Tungsten and Chromium) can be secured throughout Europe.\n\nMilitary industrial organizations[edit | edit source]\n\nGerman Reich have access to these Military industrial organizations\n\nTanks Ships Planes Materiel Equipment Porsche\n\nHeavy Tanks Designer\n\nGermaniawerft\n\nBattle Line Ship Builders\n\nMesserschmitt\n\nLight Aircraft Design\n\nRheinmetall\n\nArtillery Designer\n\nHenschel\n\nFast Tanks Designer\n\nBlohm & Voss\n\nRaiding Fleet\n\nJunkers\n\nCAS Aircraft Design\n\nMauser\n\nInfantry Weapons Designer\n\nMAN\n\nMedium Tank Designer\n\nFocke Wulf\n\nMulti-Role Aircraft Designer\n\nOpel\n\nAutomotive Manufacturer\n\nDaimler Benz\n\nStandardized Production\n\nHeinkel\n\nMulti-Role Tactical Aircraft\n\nDornier\n\nNaval Aircraft Designer\n\nMilitary[edit | edit source]\n\nGerman Reich's Wehrmacht is a military force in Hearts of Iron 4 divided into three parts the Heer (Army), the Kriegsmarine (Navy) and the Luftwaffe (Air force).\n\nArmy[edit | edit source]\n\nArmy Type # 1936 # 1939 Infantry 24 99 Light Tank 3 11 Motorized 1 7 Mountaineers 1 3 Cavalry 1 1 Paratroopers 1 Total divisions 30 122 Manpower used 269.60k 1.10m\n\nIn 1936, German Reich's Heer is relatively small compared to the armies of the other major powers. However, quality is its strength, the Heer is well trained, with all divisions being regulars and thus receiving 25% bonuses in combat. The Heer is also well equipped, with no equipment shortages, large infantry divisions (a width of 18), and support artillery and engineers. Most importantly, it has a highly elite mobile segment, with 3 light tank Panzer divisions and one motorized SS division. The Panzers are mostly light tank 1, but light tank 2 is already researched and in production for upgrades. This 4 division unit can be dangerous if deployed effectively to punching through enemy lines on plains and then aggressively encircling enemies.\n\nThus, there is no need to wait for slow rearmament in single player. The player can easily crush the UK (through a surprise invasion) or France with its starting army with the right strategy. Even in peacetime, the elite mobile divisions can be sent as volunteers to Spain or Japan for extremely decisive impacts. Neither Republican Spain nor China will usually have countermeasures against aggressive encirclement by Panzers, that being said, ending the wars too quickly may have negative strategic effects due to rocketing world tension.\n\nExamples of alternative division template names for German Reich include:\n\nMountaineers - Gebirgs-Division\n\nMarines - Marine-Division or Marine-Korps\n\nParatroopers - Flieger-Division or Fallschirmjäger-Division (after 1943)\n\nMotorized - Motorisierte-Division\n\nMechanized - Panzergrenadier-Division\n\nArmor - Panzer-Division\n\nField Marshals Name Skill ATK DEF PLN LOG Traits Gerd von Rundstedt 3 3 2 3 2 Old Guard Urban Assault Specialist Defensive Doctrine Günther von Kluge 3 4 2 2 3 Armor Officer Offensive Doctrine Heinrich Himmler 1 1 1 1 1 Politically Connected Walter Model 3 3 4 3 2 Brilliant Strategist Cautious Politically Connected Defensive Doctrine\n\nGenerals Name Skill ATK DEF PLN LOG Traits Albert Kesselring 4 3 4 4 4 Brilliant Strategist Cautious War Hero Alexander von Falkenhausen 3 2 2 3 3 Infantry Officer Alfred Jodl 3 2 2 3 3 Career Officer Politically Connected Erich von Manstein 4 3 4 4 4 Brilliant Strategist Armor Officer Trickster Engineer (trait) Ernst-Eberhard Hell 3 3 2 3 2 War Hero Engineer (trait) Winter Specialist Erwin Rommel 4 4 4 2 3 Reckless Media Personality Armor Officer War Hero Trickster Erwin von Witzleben 4 4 3 2 4 Career Officer Infantry Officer Ewald von Kleist 2 2 1 2 2 Cautious Armor Officer Fedor von Bock 4 5 3 4 2 Cautious Harsh Leader Felix Steiner 3 3 2 3 2 Friedrich Paulus 1 1 1 1 1 Cautious Armor Officer Friedrich Schulz 3 3 3 1 3 Infantry Officer Georg von Küchler 4 3 2 4 4 Georg-Hans Reinhardt 3 1 2 4 3 Cautious Armor Officer Gotthard Heinrici 3 3 1 3 3 Cautious Infantry Officer Engineer (trait) Hasso von Manteuffel 4 4 3 3 3 Career Officer Cautious Armor Officer Heinz Guderian 4 3 4 5 3 Brilliant Strategist Career Officer Armor Officer Trickster Panzer Leader Hermann Hoth 3 2 2 3 3 Reckless Armor Officer Johannes Blaskowitz 3 3 2 3 2 Infantry Officer Kurt Student 4 4 2 4 3 Reckless Commando Maximilian von Weichs 4 4 2 3 4 Cavalry Officer Paul Hausser 4 5 3 4 2 Armor Officer Politically Connected Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck 4 3 3 2 5 Trickster War Hero Media Personality Jungle Rat Sepp Dietrich 4 3 3 5 4 Brilliant Strategist Reckless Armor Officer Politically Connected Walter Krüger 3 3 3 1 3 Reckless Armor Officer Politically Connected Wilhelm List 2 2 3 1 3 Inflexible Strategist Career Officer Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb 3 4 3 1 2 Old Guard Infantry Officer\n\nDivision composition list Division Name list Support companies Combat battalions Infanterie-Division Infantry Engineer, Artillery 9x Infantry Sicherungs-Division^ Garrison 9x Infantry Panzer-Division Panzer Motorized Recon, Engineer, Artillery* 4x Light Tank, 2x Motorized Infantry Leichte-Division^ Light Motorized Recon, Engineer 1x Light Tank, 4x Motorized Infantry Infanterie-Division (mot.)

However, it can be rebuilt in the time available into an effective fighting force, especially if operating under the protection of the Luftwaffe.\n\nHistorically, the Third Reich had begun to implement a massive shipbuilding programme known as Plan Z that called for no fewer than ten modern battleships (including the Scharnhorst and Bismarck classes), four aircraft carriers (including the unfinished Graf Zeppelin) and three battlecruisers (the planned O-class) to lead a large fighting force of surface raiders capable of both operating far out into the Atlantic against convoys and fighting pitched fleet battles in the North Sea against the Royal Navy, but efforts stalled as resources and yards were diverted to more critical material following the outbreak of war.\n\nProduction shifted almost entirely to U-boats in a bid to cut Britain off from the resources of the Commonwealth and USA through unrestricted submarine warfare, and by the end of the war, the Kriegsmarine was overwhelmingly comprised of U-boats, many of very advanced design that heavily influenced post-War Allied submarines after the fall of the Third Reich. The player can choose either of these directions through the small naval branch of Germany's national focus tree, although Plan Z will take some more time to execute than the construction of a submarine raiding fleet.\n\nGermany starts with some technological advantages in naval design, including 1936 designs for light cruisers, destroyers and submarines, and in 1936 has eight Type IIA U-boats and four Type 1934-class destroyers under construction, as well as the famous Admiral Graf Spee \"pocket battleship\" (heavy cruiser) about to leave the drydock. Two Scharnhorst-class tiers II battleships are under construction as well. It has two manufacturers to choose from - Germaniawerft and Blohm & Voss - which respectively confer bonuses for capital ships and raiding fleets.\n\nAdmirals Name Skill ATK DEF MNV COR Traits Alfred Saalwächter 4 4 2 3 4 Old Guard Bold Erich Raeder 4 3 4 3 3 Battleship Adherent Naval Lineage Günther Lütjens 3 4 1 1 4 Gentlemanly Career Officer Superior Tactician Hermann Boehm 4 3 4 4 2 Craven Superior Tactician Karl Dönitz 5 5 3 3 5 Career Officer Sea Wolf Wilhelm Marschall 4 4 2 3 4 Old Guard Bold\n\nNaval units list Type Class Hull Engine # 1936 1936 # 1939 1939 Design note CV Graf Zeppelin^ 1936 Carrier Carrier II 1 3x Hangar Space, Anti-Air I, Secondary Battery I BB Bismarck^ 1936 Heavy Ship Heavy II 2 2x Heavy Battery III, 2x Anti-Air I, Fire Control I, 2x Secondary Battery II, Battleship Armor II, Floatplane Catapult I BB Scharnhorst 1936 Heavy Ship Heavy II 2 2 2x Heavy Battery II, 2x Anti-Air I, 2x Secondary Battery I, Battleship Armor I BB Deutschland* Pre-Dreadnought Heavy I 2 2 Heavy Battery I, 2x Anti-Air I, Secondary Battery I, Battleship Armor I CA Deutschland Panzerschiff Cruiser I 2 1 3 Heavy Battery II, 2x Anti-Air I, Secondary Battery I, Cruiser Armor I, Floatplane Catapult I, Torpedo Launcher I CA Admiral Hipper 1936 Cruiser Cruiser I 1 1 4 2x Heavy Cruiser Battery II, 2x Anti-Air I, Cruiser Armor II, Torpedo Launcher I, Floatplane Catapult I CL Leipzig 1936 Cruiser Cruiser I 2 2 2x Light Cruiser Battery I, 2x Anti-Air I, Cruiser Armor I, Torpedo Launcher I, Floatplane Catapult I CL Bremse* Early Cruiser Cruiser I 2 2 Light Battery I, 2x Anti-Air I, 2x Minelaying Rails CL Emden* Early Cruiser Cruiser I 1 1 2x Light Cruiser Battery I, Cruiser Armor I, Torpedo Launcher I CL Königsberg* Early Cruiser Cruiser I 3 3 2x Light Cruiser Battery I, Anti-Air I, Cruiser Armor I, Torpedo Launcher I, Minelaying Rails DD Zerstörer 1936^ 1936 Destroyer Light II 5 1 Light Battery II, Anti-Air I, Torpedo Launcher I, Depth Charge I DD Zerstörer 1934A 1936 Destroyer Light II 12 12 Light Battery II, Anti-Air I, 2x Torpedo Launcher I, Depth Charge I DD Zerstörer 1934* 1936 Destroyer Light II 4 4 Light Battery II, Anti-Air I, 2x Torpedo Launcher I, Minelaying Rails DD Type 24* Early Destroyer Light I 12 11 6 Light Battery I, Torpedo Launcher I, Minelaying Rails SS Type VII 1936 Submarine Submarine I 32 5 Torpedo Tubes II SS Type II* Early Submarine Submarine I 14 8 26 Torpedo Tubes I * marks a variant as \"outdated\".\n\n^ marks a variant that is only available in the 1939 start.\n\nShip type terminology:\n\nCV - Carrier\n\nBB - Battleship\n\nCA - Heavy cruiser\n\nCL - Light cruiser\n\nDD - Destroyer\n\nSS - Submarine\n\nNaval variants list (Without Man the Guns)\n\nAir force[edit | edit source]\n\nAir Force Type # 1936 # 1939 Close air support 80 390 Fighter 280 1148 Naval bomber 72 162 Heavy fighter 120 Tactical bomber 480 1036 Transport 80 (As of 1.12.11) 132 Total planes 916 2988 Manpower used 28.16k 90.80k\n\nThe Luftwaffe in 1936 is smaller than the RAF, which is usually its main adversary, and the small fighter force is outdated. However, the German Reich does start with 1936 designs for all aircraft except carrier variants and heavy fighters, meaning that modern aircraft production can begin right away and research efforts can be diverted elsewhere.\n\nHistorically, Germany focused on flexible medium bombers such as the He 111 that could provide tactical support, and also pioneered close-in air support with dive bombers such as the Ju 87 operating in concert with ground troops on the offensive. Germany's default air doctrine and unique advisors allow for the execution of very effective ground support operations.\n\nThe Luftwaffe was rapidly built into a modern air force in the late 1930s, playing a key role in German offensives in Poland, the Benelux, and France. After losing to the RAF in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe would go on to play a vital role in early German victories on the Eastern Front, although the lack of strategic bombers to destroy Russian industry beyond the Urals ultimately contributed to the failure of Operation Barbarossa. German aerial innovation continued throughout the war, even after the tide had turned against the Axis, leading to the development of both the first operational jet fighter, the Me 262, and the V-2 rocket, the first long-range guided ballistic missile.\n\nAircraft variants list\n\nMilitary staff[edit | edit source]\n\nThese are the military staff candidates for appointment of German Reich.\n\nChief of Army Candidate Specialty Skill Effects Requirements Ludwig Beck Army Organization Expert\n\nArmy Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nArmy Organization: +8%\n\n100 20 Wilhelm Keitel Army Drill Expert\n\nArmy Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nDivision training time: −10%\n\n100 20\n\nCurrent ruling party is Fascist\n\nFranz Halder Army Offense Expert\n\nArmy Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nDivision Attack: +10%\n\n100 20 W. von Brauchitsch Army Maneuver Expert\n\nDivision speed: +10%\n\nArmy Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\n100 20\n\nHas completed focus Army Innovations.\n\nChief of Navy Candidate Specialty Skill Effects Requirements Erich Raeder Decisive Battle Expert\n\nNavy Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nCapital Ship, Screen:\n\nAttack: +10%\n\nArmor: +10%\n\n100 20 Karl Dönitz Commerce Raiding Genius\n\nNavy Experience Gain: +0.40 daily\n\nConvoy Raiding Efficiency: +20%\n\n200 10\n\nChief of Airforce Candidate Specialty Skill Effects Requirements Hermann Göring Ground Support Expert\n\nAir Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nAir Superiority: +10%\n\n100 20\n\none of the following must be true:\n\nCurrent ruling party is Fascist\n\nReinstated Nazi Leadership\n\nRitter von Greim All-Weather Expert\n\nAir Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nBad Weather Penalty: −20%\n\n100 20\n\nHas completed focus Air Innovations.\n\nAlbert Kesselring Air Reformer Expert\n\nArmy Experience Gain: +0.30 daily\n\nAir Experience Gain: +10%\n\n100 20\n\nMilitary High Command Candidate Specialty Skill Effects Requirements Ferdinand Schörner Infantry Expert\n\nInfantry Division:\n\nAttack: +10%\n\nDefense: +15%\n\n100 20 Erwin Rommel Armor Genius\n\nArmor Division:\n\nAttack: +15%\n\nDefense: +15%\n\n200 10\n\nHas completed focus Army Innovations.\n\nGerd von Rundstedt Army Regrouping Expert\n\nDivision Recovery Rate: +8%\n\n100 20 Werner von Fritsch Army Logistics Expert\n\nDivision Attrition: −8%\n\n100 20 Hugo Sperrle Close Air Support Expert\n\nClose Air Support:\n\nAttack: +3%\n\nDefense: +3%\n\nAgility: +3%\n\n100 20\n\nHas completed focus Air Innovations.\n\nErhard Milch Bomber Interception Expert\n\nInterception:\n\nAttack: +3%\n\nDefense: +3%\n\nAgility: +3%\n\n100 20 Kurt Student Airborne Assault Expert\n\nParadrop:\n\nAttack: +2%\n\nDefense: +5%\n\nAgility: +5%\n\n100 20 Erich Bey Naval Air Defense Expert\n\nNaval AA attack: +15%\n\n100 20 Günther Lütjens Fleet Logistics Expert\n\nNaval max range factor: +10%\n\n100 20 Viktor Schütze Anti-Submarine Specialist\n\nSubmarine Detection: +10%\n\n50 30\n\nStrategies and guides[edit | edit source]\n\nDuring 1936, player should build civilian factories until end of 1937 while not building infrastructure. Germany stats at Partial mobilisation which doesn't have debuff for building civilian factories. At the beginning of 1938 its wise to start shifting construction towards military factories. In the year 1939 you should start building refineries in Autobahn states for rubber and oil. After that build Military factories again.\n\nStart with the \"Rhineland\" national focus which gives you 120 political power to switch for Free trade law. Then pick either \"Four Year Plan\" second (delayed and few tech juggeling in research to construction 1 and Basic Machine tools so bonuses does not applies to dispersed 1,2 or construction 2) or go \"Army Innovations\" and \"Treaty with the USSR\" and select \"Four Year Plan\" as fourth focus. Then continue to \"Anschluss\", \"Demand Sudetenland/Slovenia\" and other diplomatic focuses are achieved the player should take them. Germany is in a race against time to occupy Allied countries before they outgrow Germany industrially. Given enough time the Allied countries have enough factories and manpower to beat both Germany and Italy. Therefore it is recommended the player has declared war on France, Yugoslavia, Poland, and/or the Benelux countries before 1939 is over.\n\nRemember to send volunteers to fight for Nationalist Spain to gain military experience.\n\nGermany suffers from a lack of fuel for most of the early to mid-game so it's important to keep in mind to build refineries and trade are important parts of the pre-war buildup. After the war is declared with the Allies Germany can still trade with Romania and the Soviet Union without risking losing German convoys. Avoid trading with the Soviet Union, unless absolutely necessary, since Germany will likely be at war with them in the future and the player doesn't want to give them more civilian factories.\n\nIn the buildup to the war with Poland Germany has many strategies to choose from. However, one approach is to build up the army with tanks and motorized, while upgrading the infantry template to include artillery and support divisions, air force with fighters and Close Air Support/Tactical Bombers and leaving the navy largely ignored as it won't help much in the wars with France, Poland and the Benelux countries. Use naval bombers and submarines to disrupt UK shipping and troop transports. This strategy largely follows the historical strategy of the German Reich.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on a strong navy, particularly submarines. While only producing a small amount of \"elite\" tank divisions and letting motorized/motorized artillery divisions be your \"punching force\". Air superiority is still very important and it's recommended Germany have deployed a minimum of 1000 fighters at the outbreak of the war. Use submarines to sink as much of UK transports and trade convoys in the English Channel at the start of the war. Keep the surface fleet in dock until the player thinks it can match the Royal Navy, and France has surrendered.\n\nNational focus[edit | edit source]\n\nA generally agreed upon order for national focus is as follows:\n\nHistorical[edit | edit source]\n\nRhineland\n\nArmy Innovations\n\nTreaty with the USSR\n\nFour Year Plan\n\nAutarky\n\nHermann Goring-Werke\n\nKdF-Wagen\n\nExtra Research Slot\n\nReichsautobahn\n\nAnschluss\n\nThe general purpose of this order is to use the early game to prioritize the building of the German economy. These choices, combined with research focused on industry, maximize the economy such that by 1939 it is possible to make a shift to producing updated military units at a very high rate. For example, Rhineland going first assumes the political power will be used on changing to a Free Economy which provides a significant early economic boost. One could consider choices 2 & 3 somewhat flexible, though these are presented as they provide very early medium armor, allowing for Panzer IV in 1938, which is highly desirable. The reason for taking four year plan in the fourth slot (as opposed to the second) is that it pushes the research bonuses gained from that focus to later years (assuming the player is researching industry at the start of the game), allowing the player to continue to focus on industrial tech research well ahead of time, and thus gain those bonuses for the longer term. Note that Four Year Plan --> Autarky --> Hermann Goring-Werk --> KdF-Wagen is a chain that would almost always make senses to follow in any strategy being considered. Finally, while the last three listed are widely considered optimal, flexibility here is possible for certain specific strategies.\n\nFor a historical DOW on Poland (9/1/1939), the following chain needs to start by February 1, 1939:\n\n17. Reassert Eastern Claims\n\n18. Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\n\n19. Danzig or War\n\nThe reason we are doing Reassert Eastern Claims first is to not allow the Soviet Union to possibly take Lithuania (and thus Memel) before us. You may reassert eastern claims at any time, so long as it happens before the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\n\nAhistorical (Democratic)[edit | edit source]\n\nOppose Hitler\n\nFour Year Plan\n\nAutarky\n\nKaiser Werke\n\nWilhelm Wagen\n\nExtra Research Slot\n\nSecure the New State\n\nRe-Establish Free Elections\n\nThe Monarchy Compromise\n\nReverse the Brain Drain\n\nThe general purpose of this order is to minimize the world tension generated by the player, and to prepare for the main focus of our conflict with the Soviet Union - as the German Civil War can vary for everyone, the 5 focuses in between Oppose Hitler and Secure the New State are to ensure that you have plenty of time. It's recommended that one rush the 2nd level of Industrial Focus (Concentrated/Dispersed Industry II and Construction II) before taking Four Year Plan to benefit the most from those bonuses - one does not need to have finished the respective techs to use the bonuses on the 1939 industry. If the civil war is still ongoing by the time you finish Extra Research Slot, feel free to add Army Innovations and Treaty with the USSR for more time and also to get Medium Tanks early (note you can take the latter focus any time as long as you haven't done Bulwark Against Bolshevism or the Great Red Menace, so if you want to hold off on taking them until you've flipped to Democracy, feel free to do so). If, on the other hand, you finish the civil war early, feel free to tackle Secure the New State early, and come back to what economic focuses you skipped after doing Re-Establish Free Elections while you wait for enough Democracy support to do the Monarchy Compromise.\n\nNote that taking Großraumwirtschaft during the civil war if it lasts that long is also worth considering, as doing so will allow you to align Hungary and Romania and boost Democracy in those countries, thus preventing them from flipping to Fascism and joining either Novus Imperium Romanum or the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere (in the case of Romania, the boost from Appoint Pro-Allied Government may also result in them flipping back to Democracy).\n\nAhistorical (Imperial)[edit | edit source]\n\nArmy Innovations\n\nTreaty with the USSR\n\nOppose Hitler\n\nNaval Rearmament\n\nNaval Effort\n\nFour Year Plan\n\nSecure the New State\n\nRevive the Kaiserreich\n\nReturn of the Kaiser\n\nFocus on the True Enemy\n\nUnlike with the Democratic tree, tension is not a limiting factor if pursuing the Kaiser and letting him restore the Central Powers - one can take some time to justify a few war goals before overthrowing Hitler; in particular, Switzerland or the Netherlands are ideal candidates (former gives one a second way of bypassing the Maginot if the French manage to secure the Belgian border; latter is ideal for gaining access to the Dutch East Indies and the oil, manpower, and other resources it grants), although if one wishes to have Wilhelm II, they should be mindful of how much tension they generate, as the UK and France can block the Netherlands from returning the Kaiser. Taking Army Innovations first allows for one to have some army XP to customize their divisions (in particular, adding 2 motorized units to the starting panzer division is very effective during the civil war), and Treaty with the USSR allows for one to get Medium Tanks early on. The two naval focuses are required to progress down Focus on the True Enemy (and getting more dockyards early means you can begin the construction of capital/screen ships earlier), and Four Year Plan's placement is to ensure that one at least has the chance to get started on the 1937 industry techs so they can research the 1939 ones ahead of time. Unlike with the Democratic Tree, however, it is advised that, if possible, for one to rush Return of the Kaiser as soon as possible; one can get enough Non-Aligned support by doing rounds of anti-Fascist/anti-Communist raids, and also banning the latter ideology.\n\nForming the Holy Roman Empire[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire is a very daunting, but powerful, path that Germany can form, consisting of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Northern Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and some territory from France.\n\nFirst, one should wait until they have enough political power to justify on Yugoslavia; while the country itself (and Romania, who is one of the 3 nations guaranteeing Yugoslavia) is not required to form the HRE, it is guaranteed by 2 nations (France and Czechoslovakia) who are. In the meantime, use your starting infantry to guard the border with France, convert all your starting units who aren't infantry to the Panzer Division, and have them prepare a naval invasion from Wilhelmshaven to either Dunkerque or Calais. Train and force deploy cavalry until you have 48 units, and use them to guard the Czech border - make sure to exercise them so they aren't lv 1. Have your navy exercise until they are at least lv 2, and then set them on strike force on the necessary bodies of water. Your focuses should be Naval Rearmament, Army Innovations, Treaty with the USSR, Air Innovations, Four Year Plan, and Großraumwirtschaft - use the 10 Army XP you get from Army Innovations to add 2 motorized units to your Panzer Division Template, to make them faster and stronger, and use the bonuses from Four Year Plan to go ahead of time on the 1939 Industrial and Construction techs. Note that while Align Romania would allow you to eventually bring Romania into your faction (thus allowing you to get around the Romanian guarantee of Yugoslavia), by the time Romania would be able to join your faction, France will have joined the Allies as well as having cancelled its guarantee on Yugoslavia, so it's best to just hold off on aligning Romania (and it's best to wait until after you overthrow the Nazi regime to get them as a puppet anyways).\n\nWhen the war breaks out, launch your naval invasion as soon as France gets called in - while the starting French navy is stronger than the starting German navy, there is a small period where they will not be deployed in the English channel; even if you lose naval superiority during the invasion, as long as the naval invasion starts while you have superiority, you'll be able to carry it out. As soon as your 6 panzer divisions land on France, call back your navy and have them rush the victory points; due to the Disjointed Government spirit, if you can take Paris and a few other cities, they will capitulate easily (and the 2 motorized units you added will make the divisions very fast). After capitulating France, during the peace conference, take all of mainland France and Corsica as well as any resource-rich territory (French Indochina, France's South American territory, and some of their African colonies) and territory that isn't attached to a nation, and then liberate the rest - while you want to cause some world tension, you do not want to cause too much, as you want the British to like you (and if the tension gets too high in the civil war, there is a chance Italy could intervene on the Reich's side), yet you also want tension to be high enough so that you can form a faction with Austria (to annex them through an event) and Romania (after taking \"Align Romania\"). If you wish to go for House of Kurds on this playthrough, it's recommended that you liberate an extra African territory to compensate for the tension taking the French-held Kurdish territory will generate (alternatively, one can liberate Brittany, as it is not required for the HRE; liberating Occitania is not a good idea, as one of the Occitanian cores, Savoy, is required for forming the nation). Do not puppet any nations - when the civil war breaks out, any puppets you have will join the Reich, and will go free after the Reich falls.\n\nAfter the peace deal with France, take your Panzer Divisions and have them enter the tile of Czechoslovakia that borders Poland; this tile will not be fortified, and will go down easily. Have the Panzers rush the Victory points and capitulate them. After this, use your cavalry units to stop the Romanians from entering (as neither France nor Czechoslovakia will have joined a faction, you will not have to worry about capitulating a faction leader; that being said, if you justify any more war goals while at war, they will be guaranteed by the British, so don't), and disband the rest of your army. As soon as Czechoslovakia capitulates (take all states; while you only need the Czech states and not the Slovak states, you might as well take everything), take Oppose Hitler, and 1-2 days before that focus completes, disband your existing units (the Romanians will not be able to get to any of your cores in this time), and send all your equipment to either Nationalist or Republican Spain (or one of the Chinese Warlords, if the Sino-Japanese war has broken out). After the war fires, cancel the lend-lease, take the Decision \"Sharpen Air Safety Regulations\" (to ensure that you do not get the Hindenburg Disaster; the only other guaranteed way to prevent it is to remain at war until May 6, 1939, which is not practical), and train Panzer Divisions (6 at a time) - the AI's troops are nowhere near as strong as even force-deployed Panzer Divisions. Romania and Yugoslavia will still be at war with the AI Controlled German Reich, but they will not be at war with the German Military Junta (if you wish to have the Romanian occupied lands in Czechoslovakia revert to your control, give Romania military access). It's also recommended that you change your conscription and mobilization laws now if you want to - going to Extensive Conscription as Germany is a very good idea, as Fan Prussian Militarism can offset the training time increase Extensive Conscription has, and you won't get another chance to go to War Economy for a while. During or after the war, form a faction with Austria - this will get you an event that allows you to peacefully annex them after a random amount of time (if you form a faction with them during the war, the event can still fire, which will result in not only a new front opening for the Reich, but also you getting their well-equipped troops). After completing the war, consider taking \"Align Hungary\", \"Align Romania\", and \"Integrate War Economies\" to get Romania as a puppet (Hungary won't become a puppet as you own Czechoslovakia, some of the states it has claims on). If historical is on and one has Death or Dishonor, by 1938, Romania should flip to Non-Aligned (the \"Align Romania\" focus will help tremendously), and will accept an invitation to your faction. If one has La Resistance, consider setting up a collaboration government on Italy by this point for later.\n\nRegardless of if you decided to Integrate the Economies of Romania and Hungary or not, take Restore the Kaiserreich and Return of the Kaiser, but disband all your units before the latter finishes - as long as you have fewer units than the Dutch, they will block the return of the Kaiser (note that units that have yet to be deployed are not counted; as such, feel free to queue up a large number of units before disbanding your army; make them a single cavalry or infantry division to get them out quickly). Rather than declare war in response, accept their decision to get Wilhelm III (if one has caused too much World Tension, the British can threaten war instead of the Dutch blocking you, but as we need to have the British on our side, we can't let that happen). Then, wait for some of the tension you caused to go down (now would be a good time to take Fan Prussian Militarism, as well as any other economic focuses you want), and take the decisions \"Reinstate Wilhelm's Line of Succession\" and \"Modernize the Succession Laws\" (the latter will allow Victoria to become Kaiserin). Afterwards, take \"Expatriate the Communists\", and let the tension die down more - do not take \"See to the Eastern Front\" until after you have restored the British Titles, as it will raise world tension (and thus lower British opinion of you. After a few months (stockpiling PP in the meantime), take \"Acknowledge British Naval Dominance\" and \"An Alliance with the Shade\", join the UK (making sure to request military access beforehand), and after getting their opinion of you to 100 (if improving relations doesn't get it, guarantee their independence) request the restoration of British Titles. When they accept, opt to send a liaison forward, and the rest of the royal family will die in an event, letting you get Queen Victoria - if the Hindenburg Disaster was gotten instead of the Hindenburg incident, you will not be able to get Victoria and will instead get August Von Mackensen again, and have to restart. Note that it's recommended that if you wish to build any more capital ships, you do so before acknowledging British Naval Dominance (an Aircraft Carrier or two is not a bad idea, especially since you have more than enough Chromium from New Caledonia); after the focus finishes, divert all dockyard production to submarines/destroyers and convoys afterwards (as well as repairing your existing ships).\n\nWith the Royal Titles restored, and the Kaiserin on the throne, you now have the Benelux, Italy, and Switzerland left to conquer before you can form the HRE. While you can manually justify a war goal on Italy (as a non-aligned nation, tension will be high enough, and Italy will have caused world tension), it is much easier to guarantee the independence of either Greece or Yugoslavia, and have them call you in when Italy inevitably declares war on one of them (naval invasions on the Italian coastal cities in combination with a few collaboration governments should do the trick). Afterwards, defeat Italy, take the northern Italian territories (Piedmont (158), Lombardy (159), South Tyrol (39), Veneto (160), Emilia Romagna (161), Tuscany (162) and Istria (736)) required, and leave the Allies (feel free to take See to the Eastern Front and Danzig for Guarantee to return Memel to your borders and have East Prussia connected at this point; you can later form a faction with Poland if you wish, who likely are still non-aligned and are inclined to join a faction with you). Garrison troops on the UK's victory points, justify on the Benelux countries or Switzerland (due to how high world Tension is, if the UK is controlled by an AI, they will guarantee them), and when the war is declared, the British will join, which will cause them to come close to capitulating, if not instantly capitulating. If Man the Guns is installed, there's a very good chance that the Netherlands has joined the Allies by this point, so you could justify on either Belgium or Luxembourg and also get the Dutch in the peace deal. If playing with Man the Guns, it's recommended that one do this sooner rather than later, as there is a chance that if the British have not taken their political focuses, they will take a Change in Course and go Fascist/Communist (if they take the former, they'll join the Japanese on historical; if they go the latter, they'll join the USSR). Take whatever you want during the peace deal (while you cannot get territory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, or South Africa unless you occupied them, fought them directly, or dropped one bomb on them through strategic bombing, you can satellite British Malaya and the Raj; if you do wish to go after the British dominions, however, you should have territory to stage naval invasions from thanks to the French lands of Madagascar (543), St. Pierre and Miquelon (730), and New Caledonia (635), and compared to the Royal Navy, the colonial navies are relatively weak), and then focus on taking down the remaining Benelux countries and Switzerland - the latter can be defeated easily if you use a trap, tricking them into coming onto territory you control (outside of the mountains), and then rushing their victory points. Afterwards, take the decision and restore the HRE. If you took Danzig for Guarantee and See to the Eastern Front, congratulate yourself on restoring not just the HRE, but Prussia to German hands.\n\nBy this point, there are very few nations that can stand up to you (the United States, USSR, and a fully unified China are the most notable examples), so feel free to do whatever you want."
