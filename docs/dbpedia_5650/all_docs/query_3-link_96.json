C., top government officials had just received the Al Ainorictis Master Spy We've learned, we no longer, regard spying \"dirty business.\" Today, our CIA is beating the Russians at their own game cli Ijillies.-. by Martin L. Gross startling news. Joseph V. Stalin was dead. The White House and the Pentagon were paralyzed. Excited officials asked each other: What does it mean? Would it set off a new Russian revolution? Or would pudgy Malenkov's bombers soon be leveling New York and Detroit? All eyes turned to Allen Dulles, head of our super-secret Central Intelligence Agency-the man responsible for knowing what is going on behind the Iron Curtain. No one could act without his intelligence report. It wasn't long in coming. Soon after the first newspaper extras hit the stands, one of our agents left Allen Dulles' private office at CIA headquarters. He clutched a sealed envelope under his arm. A few minutes later he strode past White House guards and was hurriedly ushered into the inner confines of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He placed the envelope on President Eisenhower's desk. It was the CIA's top-secret \"crash report\" on Stalin's death. Included in the portfolio were last minute espionage reports from our undercover agents in Moscow, Prague, Warsaw and East Berlin. Copies of stolen Russian docu- ments, notes on Red' Army troop movements, political re- ports from men close to the Kremlin. It was everything the President had to know. The vital report was the result of the fantastic CIA co- ordination. Seconds after the news of Stalin's death flashed on the teletype at CIA headquarters at 2430 E. Street, Allen' Dulles sprang into action. Word was sent to hundreds of regular CIA agents and anti-communist spies on our pay- roll throughout the world. Dulles' orders were blunt and simple: bring in every scrap of information on the strength of the new Communist regime and its war plans. His orders were immediately transformed into action. In West Berlin, a newly-arrived East German \"business- man\" cast a nervous glance over his shoulder. He stepped into a phone booth and dialed the number of his American (,IA contact-another supposed businessman. \"The machinery is still in the same warehouse,\" the German said into the phone. The CIA agent understood. It meant that the Russian tank division in the East Berlin suburbs had not been moved since Stalin's death. In Prague, an important Communist official out for an evening's stroll brushed past one of Dulles' agents. Their hands met for a split second. Safely stowed away in our CIA man's pocket was the latest Kremlin directive to satellite leaders. These scenes were repeated across the length and breadth of the Iron Curtain. In Washington, the lights of the CIA's 34 buildings burned late into the night. Incoming cables from overseas offices were quickly decoded. They told the full story of Soviet armament shipments, purges, morale behind the Iron Curtairn, the state of Russian fifth columns, and Red Army troop movements. Usually jovial CIA chief Allen Dulles grimly called a hurried conference with his top aides, including Lieutenant General Harold R. Bull and Professor Sherman Kent of Yale. The last-minute reports from the field were evaluated. They were then compared with background material oii Malenkov and the new Soviet leaders. The result, the CIA emergency \"crash report,\" was finally in the President's hands for action. Allen Dulles-backed up by a fabulous staff and 15 hard-won years of intelligence experience-had assured President Eisenhower that Russia was not ripe for either revolution or an atomic war. Wash- ington breathed easier. The cloak and dagger CIA is something new in Ameri- can life. For a long time, \"spy\" was considered a dirty word in our vocabulary. In fact, back in the 30's, Secretary of State Henry Stimson cut out the super-secret \"Black Cham- ber\" division because \"gentlemen don't read each other's mail.\" But the heroic adventures of our undercover OSS agents (luring World War II taught Washington a lesson. Today, somewhere between 3,000 and 10,000 American CIA agents, spread out from Germany to Singapore, cajole, buy, and steal information of all kinds for Uncle Sam. The CIA is a secret agency. It is so secret that less than a dozen men know its budget or how many employees it has. Estimates of its budget (a good clue to CIA strength) vary from $10,000,000 to $500,000,000. But only a few care- fully chosen Congressmen know the exact figures. CIA funds are cleverly hidden away in the budiets of other govern- ment agencies. Dulles' agents are spotted in some 30 foreign nations, where they pose as \"insurance salesmen\" or \"importers.\" They operate under dozens of different covers and their true identity is kept secret, even from trusted American officials in the same country. CIA men never carry important documents. These are sent to Washington by a special top-secret courier service. Communists claim CIA conspired with Laszlo Rajk (left), Hungary's Foreign Minister, and Rudolf Slansky (right), CPYRGHT When a CIA agent is hurt in an accident out of town, Allen Dulles quickly whisks him out of local hands. Those who crack under the strain of espionage work are cared for by the CIA's own doctor-agents. In a coma, or under the influence of drugs these men might reveal secret irtfornta- tion. CIA office trash-from Dulles' office clown to the lowliest clerks-is shredded and burned daily, The charwomen who clean up are thoroughly screened. Even typewriter ribbons used on secret documents are taken out of the machines and locked uli for the night. Employees of the CIA go through Washington's most severe security check. Out of every 1,000 job applicants, 800 are quickly weeded out. Of the remaining 200, only 90 lucky ones come through after being screened to see if they talk too much, can't carry their liquor, or have rela- tives behind the Iron Curtain. Secrecy has been the motto of the CIA ever since it was first organized by President Truman in September, 1947. A CIA official once said: \"Art intelligence officer who talks about his work ceases to be an intelligence officer.\" Officially, all the Agency will say about its work is: \"The main func- tion of the C[A is to coordinate intelligence activities.... CIA's security responsibilities are limited to the area out- side the United States and no one connected with the CIA will discuss them in any manner.... Employees of the CIA will never tell what their duties are, how they work, with whom they work. They will say they are employed by the CIA, period.\" The man who runs this close-mouthed, secret agency for America is lanky Allen Welsh Dulles, Washington's official master spy. Not too long ago, Dulles was engineering minor revolutions, outwitting the highly-praised Gestapo, and stealing Nazi secrets from under Hitler's nose. To find out what makes a 20th century master spy click, CAVALIER arranged an interview for me with Mr. Dulles. I met himn. at CIA Headquarters in Washington, D. C. The nerve center of the CIA is housed in a cluster of about 10 old buildings on a small hill on the outskirts of Washington. During World War II, it served as OSS head- quarters. The entrance to the property is plainly marked \"Central Intelligence Agency.\" The driveway bears uphill then bends right and left up to the Administration Build- ing where Dulles works. I got no further than the lobby. A uniformed guard stopped me. 'Then a ruddy faced mili- tary-looking man suddenly appeared from a little ante room off the lobby and introduced himself. \"I'm Colonel Stanley Grogan,\" he said, \"one of Mr. Dulles' assistants.\" I was given a preliminary briefing by the Colonel. He warned me not to ask' certain questions, and told me to avoid certain topics because of security. About an hour later, Mr. Dulles arrived back at CIA. Headquarters after a mid-day plane trip to New England. I interviewed him in his inner office where he was seated Party head in Czechoslovakia. Both men were executed for treason. Center, trial scene of Rajk and accomplices. behind a large desk Flanked by flags of the United States and the CIA. Hd rose to say hello, and for a man who is known to operate on a split second schedule, he seemed completely relaxed as he spoke. Dulles is a tall, well-built man of about 190 pounds. He looks younger than his 60 years and bears only a slight family resemblance to his famous brother, John Foster Dulles, our Secretary of State. He wore what is considered an Allen Dulles \"uniform\"- a tweed suit and a pipe that he kept putting in and taking out of his mouth. With his bristly mustache and bouncy youthful manner he reminds a lot of people of the old Roughrider, Teddy Roosevelt, in his slimmer days, Yet Dulles looks more like a prep school headmaster than the wily master spy history has proven him to be. in reply to my question, \"How good is the CIA?\" Dulles bit on his pipe and thought a moment. \"Well, that's a tough one.. It's hard to say how good the Central Intelligence Agency is; but I can say that we're always improving. I can't say that I'm satisfied. If I were, it would be time to hang up and quit. In this business, you can never be satisfied that you're doing enough. There's always another idea you haven't thought of.\" The next question was a touchy one. \"The American people,\" I said, \"have always been afraid that we can't hold a candle to the rest of the world in espionage and intelli- gence work. Is that true?\" \"No, it's not,\" Dulles said firmly. \"Our intelligence work is not inferior to other countries-although we have one great. fault. We talk too much for our own good. We're improving all the time,\" he repeated, \"but you see it takes years for a man to learn the very complicated intelligence business. We have ten years experience counting the OSS (luring World War IT. In ten more years, our career men will be that much better.\" Next, I asked Dulles about training agents. \"Does the CIA have a special school for its agents?\" \"Yes,\" Dulles answered, \"but I'm afraid. Fin not free to say much more about it.\" The exact location of the CIA school is secret, but we do know that many of Dulles' agents- in-training spend up to two years learning to speak, read, arid write a variety of languages. \"Is the CIA as good as the Russian intelligence network?\" I next asked. The CIA chief pondered this a bit. \"Well, let's say that we still don't put as much emphasis on intelligence work as the Communists do.\" Mr. Dulles was just being modest, at least if what the Russians say about him is true. According to the Kremlin, the insidious spy work of the \"imperialist warmonger\" Allen Dulles is threatening the entire Communist world. His agents, they claim, have wormed their way bohind the Iron Curtain from East Berlin to Shanghai. There have been a number of reports tying'Allen Dulles' carters in Berlin, then destroy all means of communicpprPWredl-Eia rRelelase 2000/ quarters. As soon as Hitler was dead, Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben was to assume control of all German land, sea and air forces. The Replacement Army was to restore order throughout the coun- try. General Kortzflcisch, Nazi Command- ing General of the Berlin Area was to be arrested and replaced by General von Thungen. Lieutenant General Paul von Hase, Commander of Berlin itself, was one of the plotters. Count Wolf von liclldorf, Police Chief of Berlin, was to hold his men ready until the Replace- ment Army arrived to arrest the chief Nazis and disarm the SS troops. The conspirators' ace-in-the-hole was to be the age-old blind obedience of the Prussian officer. Scaled orders under the code name \"Walkure,\" had already been sent out to every German command in Europe by the conspirators in Army Headquarters. At the signal that Hitler was dead, orders to open them would fol- low. The \"Walkure\" envelope contained detailed instructions of the location of secret Gestapo headquarters and orders that martial law was to be enforced and all Nazis arrested. The plotters had guessed correctly in that no one had opened the \"Walkute\" envelopes in ad- vance to tip their hand. Those generals who were irrevocably bound to the plot-Field Marshal Rom- mel; General Count Heinrich von Stulp- nagel, Military Governor of France; General von Falkenhausen, Military Gov- ernor of Belgium; and Field Marshal. von Kluge, Commander in Chief of the Western front-were to arrest all SS and Gestapo leaders and make preparations to surrender to the Allies. General Beck was to speak over the official radio station, Deutschland Sender, and announce that he was Chief of State, There would be a three day state of emer- gency, during which the Nazis would be eliminated and a new governitient formed. The new cabinet would immedi- ately enter into armistice negotiations with the Allies. In Berrie, Dulles anxiously waited for news of Hitler's death. Washington had refused to take the plot seriously. But the OSS Chief knew that if Stauffenberg's bomb were well placed, there would be no need to defeat the Germans in battle. The night of July 20th, the news hit Switzerland. The plot had failed. Hitler had spoken on the radio. \"Air extremely small clique of ambiti- ous, unscrupulous and at the same time coolish, criminally stupid officers hatched a plot to remove me and, together with me, virtually to exterminate the staff of the German High Command,\" Hitler said.. \"The bomb that was placed by Colonel count von Stauffenberg ex- ploded seven feet away from me on my right side. It wounded very seriously a number of my dear collaborators. One of them died. I, personally, am entirely unhurt, apart from negligible grazes, bruises, and burns.\" Hitler was not telling the truth.

Our agents have supposedly been thoroughly trained to use such innovations as plastic explosives that are put on a building as easily as chewing gum, and microfilm that will hide a complete four-page document under a postage stamp. But this is only penny-ante stuff, the Communists say. According to them, Allen Dulles has been using American cash and a tremendous network of \"spies, informers, 'kulaks,' reactionaries, fascists, and Wall Street stooges\" to foment revolution behind the Iron Curtain. Using a plan masterminded' by Allen Dulles, the Reds say, CIA agents behind the Iron Curtain are cutting com- munication wires,. slowing down factory production, dis- rupting civilian morale, and worst of all, plotting with dis- gruntled Communist satellite bosses to overthrow Russia's puppet governments in Eastern Europe. This is one Communist claim that doesn't sound like a Vishinsky fairy tale. The Reds connect Allen Dulles with every Eastern European leader who has gone to the gallows for \"cooperating with the imperialist west.\" His name has become a curse word in the hallways of the MVD secret police in Moscow. The Dulles plan, against Russia, according to the Coin- munist New York Daily Worker, is officially called \"Project K.\" One of Dulles' boldest schemes-a daring plot to over- throw the Hungarian Communist government of Premier Rakosi-was recently described iii' detai, in a series of articles in the Daily Worker and called \"Espionage, Inc.\" It was also discussed in detail in a British Communist pamphlet, \"Cloak and Dollar War.\" Allen Dulles set the fantastic scheme into operation back in 1944, when he was still in the OSS, the Communists claim. Dulles was worried that Eastern Europe would be gobbled up by the Reds. He made contact with six impor- tant Hungarian refugees in Switzerland. One of them was Dr. Tibor Szonyi, a prominent pre-war politician. The refugees returned to Hungary right after the war. Under orders from Dulles, the Kremlin says, Szonyi and his friends, now agents of America, became active members of the Communist Party. Szonyi rose to the strategic position of Personnel Chief of the Communist Party. After a few years, Laszlo Rajk, the powerful secretary of the Hungarian Party, was brought into the conspiracy. He was to become head of the government after Rakosi was kicked out by their revolution. In time, the CIA reportedly took over activities of the OSS. According to the Communists, our CIA contact man was Lieutenant Colonel Kopscak, the American military attache in Budapest. He was later kicked out of Hungary by the Communists. They claimed he had photographed secret military installations on the Hungarian-Yugoslav border and had worked with 40 anti-Communist collabora- Gen.

The plot was bold but simple. Gyorgy Palffy, a pre-war Hungarian officer and one of the con- spirators, was named head of the entire Hungarian Army. Rajk helped engineer the appointment. His job was to organize a Hungarian People's Army battalion equipped with all the heavy weapons al- lowed Hungary by the Allies. At the right time, his battalion was to take over all important government offices. The date for the coup was set for early June, 1949, but the Hungarian Secret Po- lice got wind of it and swooped clown on Rajk and the other conspirators. The plot was killed. At the purge trials, Rajk, Szonyi, and the others gave de- tailed \"confessions\" of their collabora- tion with Allen Dulles. Dulles, the. Communists complain, has also been using every trick of modern psychological warfare in his campaign against the Kremlin. One morning, Hun- garians reading their newspaper found a full-page insert that didn't read much like the rest of the official party organ. It was a fervent plea calling on the United Nations to deliver Hungary \"from the boot of our Russian overlords.\" One CIA plot to breed revolution be- hind the Iron. Curtain is still going strong, the Communists say. We are sup- posedly right in the midst of a plan to overthrow the Hodza regime in Albania. According to Albanian reports, dozens of Dulles' agents, armed and equipped with short-wave transmitters, have been smuggled into the country by land, sea, and air. With local anti-communist help, these \"agents\" are supposedly staging guerilla raids, sabotaging Red military projects and organizing a pro-western underground. Dulles and the CIA have gotten fea- ture billing at the biggest purge trials be- hind the Iron Curtain-Kochi Xoxe in Albania, Kostov in Bulgaria, Gomulka in Poland, and Slansky in Czechoslovakia. At the Slanksy trial, the Kremlin claimed that Dulles had plotted with the former Communist leader to overthrow the government. But when the plot looked doomed, the Reds say, our secret CIA headquarters in Frankfurt, West Germany, made arrangements with Slanksy to smugglr him out of the coun- try. The CIA had secretly delivered a letter to Slanksy, outlining the escape route. Further messages were to be sent to hini in code over Radio Free Europe. But Slanksy never got out alive. The Secret Police arrested him before the CIA plan could be put into effect. At Slanksy's trial, the Communists also claim that Czech agents on the CIA pay- roll are recruited from refugee organiza- tions throughout Western Europe and Approved financed by a secret $75,000,000 fund for \"Project X,\" controlled by Allen Dulles. One million dollars of this CIA \"revo- lution fund,\" the Daily Worker claims, was recently handed over to W.I.N., a group of Polish underground fighters ranking with the best behind the Iron Curtain. Communist complaints like these fill the pages of Pravda and the satellite press. In fact, Allen Dulles' name is prob- ably better known behind the Iron Cur- tain than here in America. Dulles came to the CIA with a list of espionage credits that makes the Coni- rnunist claims about hire sound tame. Born in 1893, he was one of five chil- dren of a Presbyterian minister, Rev. Allen Macy Dulles. His grandfather, John Watson Foster, was Secretary of State under Benjamin Harrison and his uncle, Robert Lansing was to become Secretary of State under Wilson. By the time he was 23, Dulles had an M.A. from Princeton and :one year's teaching experience in Allaliabad Chris- tian College in India under his belt. Then in .1916 he joined the State De- partment's Foreign Service and was as- signed to Vienna, the seat of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. When America en- tered the war against Austria in 1917, Dulles was quickly whisked out of enemy territory and sent to neutral Switzerland. It was there that he first wet his toes in the queasy business of \"intelligence.\" Dulles' appetite for secret intelligence work was whetted. But it wasn't until World War [1 and the'OSS, after spend- ing 15 of the 20 intervening years as a Wall Street lawyer, that he developed his masterful talent for espionage. Soon after Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt formed the OSS, an undercover agency that was to handle jobs we couldn't assign to either Army or Navy G-2. Brigadier General \"Wild Bill\" Don- ovan was named to head the new organ- ization. He grabbed Allen Dulles out of law practice and made him one of his top assistants. Dulles was first sent to Bolivia where lie kicked the Nazis out of the airlines business. Then in November 1.942, he was dispatched to Switzerland, nominally as the Special Assistant to the U. S. Min- ister at Berne. but actually as European Chief of the OSS. Dulles began operations on the Her- rerr.gasse, a street in Berne, with only vague instructions from Washington. But before long lie turned his OSS Bureau into a center for all kinds of political refugees from Hitler. Dulles soon got his first important as- signment. He was to contact the anti-Nazi underground in Germany. He made dis- erect inquiries among German refugees. One of the clues led to the German un- ally a member of the Abwehr, the seer t Nazi intelligence organization. Gisevius, who hated Hitler, had bee assigned to Switzerland by General Oste , the deputy leader of the Abwehr. Ost was one of the heads of the anti-Nazi co - spiracy in Germany. Gisevius was to coy - tact Dulles and through him seek Amer - can help in a plot to kill Hitler. The plot was no idle dream. The u - derground leaders, Gisevius told Dulle. , included Colonel General Ludwig Bec , former Chief of Staff of the 1Fehrmach :Admiral Canaris and General Oster the Abwehr, General Haider, Count FIel - dorf, Chief of the Berlin Police, an dozens of high-ranking officers of th I4'chrmacht. Gisevius asked Dulles' help. Could h get a promise from Washington that the would welcome a new anti-Nazi govern nient should their Hitler coup succeed Dulles sent a number of coded tel grams to Washington stressing th urgency of the plot. Then one clay ii February, 1943, Gisevius made contac and suggested another meeting. \"We have to stop seeing each othe immediately,\" he told Dulles. \"The Nazi have broken your code.\" To prove his point, Gisevius reache into his pocket and Nom a small not book he read a digest of several message Dulles had recently sent to Washington He had seen the decoded telegrams i the Berlin office of the Abwehr. Dulles listened, then assured Giseviu that \"Breakers\"-as lie called the anti Hitler plot-was still intact. He had use( .another code to transmit the secret infor mation about the conspiracy. In April, 1944, in the hope of arousin Washington's enthusiasm for the plo against Hitler, Dulles wired a summar of the conspirators' position. But Wash ington made no promises to \"Break ers.\" For weeks the Germans brok off relations with Dulles after hearing th discouraging news from Washington. Bu then on July 12, 1944, Gisevius was or dered to Berlin. The conspiracy wa going ahead without Washington. The date of the coup had been set for Jul 20th. Hitler was to be assassinated in hi, East Prussian headquarters by one of hi.s trusted aides, Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg, the one-armed Chief of Staff of the Germany Replacement Army. Dulles learned the news from Gisevius. Fie wired Washington the details. The plot was amazingly simple. Colonel Stauffenberg was to report to Hitler's se- cret headquarters on July 20th. But in- stead. of staff plans, his briefcase would hold a new British-designed bomb to be detonated by acid eating through a re- lease wire. Stauffenberg was to place the loaded briefcase near Hitler at the con- ference table, and then leave the room on some pretext. The second the bomb ex- ploded, General Erich Fellgiebel, Chief of the German Army Signal Corps, was to call the plotters at 14\"ehrmacht Head- yLihe xne man from the Auswaertiges .flint was accep ed b Du am given ICPYRGHT CPYRGHT e 2000/ the code name*P19\"\" 46c1. @IirAJ was born, as General Eisenhower later said, one of the Allies' most valuable in- formants. During the next two years, \"Wood\" made five trips from Berlin to Berrie, often at the risk of his life. In all, he de- livered to Dulles 2,600 documents. Through \"Wood,\" Dulles learned of the secret radio in the German Embassy in Dublin that was directing Nazi U- boats; of the Laval plan for the arrest and possible execution of relatives of soldiers who joined General deGaulle. It was \"Wood\" who discovered the identity of Cicero Diellio, the Nazi spy who was a butler in the home of the British Ambassador to Turkey-and later became the subject of the film Five Fingers. One of. \"Wood's\" most important bits of information was a message from the German Embassy in Buenos Aires. It re- ported the impending departure of a large American convoy from an Atlantic port. But as soon as Washington received the news from Dulles, the shipping date was changed. A number of U-boats were highly disappointed. Dulles' cables to Washington became highly-awaited events. The German courier received no money, or medals for his heroic work. All he had was Dulles' assurances that the free world would never forget his contribution. By February, 1945, the Allies had re- captured most of Western Europe and were pushing their way into Germany. Dulles had. dor;e an ingenious job of in- telligence, and his work seemed behind him. But one day he received a visit from Major Max Weibel, Intelligence Officer of the Swiss General Staff. He had come on behalf of SS General Karl Wolff, Gestapo Chief of all Italy. Wolff's proposition, as relayed by Wei- bel, was startling. Both he and Field Marshal Kesselring, as Commanders of the SS and 1Vehrniacht armies in Italy, were willing to negotiate with the Allies to surrender 600,000 German troops then in Northern Italy. The surrender had nothing to do with Hitler and would be accomplished without his blessings. Wolff wanted to arrange a meeting with Dulles in Switzerland to discuss the surrender. Dulles' first reaction to the fantastic offer was one of skepticism. He told Major Weibel he would think about it, but could do nothing at the present time. But as the days went by and the Allies pushed forward, Dulles reconsidered. He had read OSS reports on the increasing defeatist attitude among the German offi- cer ranks. Kesselring's reported agree- ment to Wolff's plan made it sound more authentic. Dulles decided it was too good an opportunity to pass up. He contacted Weibel and said he would agree to meet with one of General Wolff's personal representatives. Late in February of 1945 General Wolff, sent an SS officer, Dollman, to see Dulles; but Dulles decided to have an assistant handle this stage of the talks.

The elate was set for March 8, 1945. \"Both Kesselring and I wish to quit this useless war so that we can avoid further bloodshed and destruction in Italy,\" the Nazi General told Dulles. \"Hitler has ordered a scorched earth de- struction of Northern Italy when we re- treat. I wish to avoid this at all cost. I am therefore . prepared to discuss surrender of our armies in Italy.\" To show his sincerity, Wolff swore that he would deliver several hundred Jewish prisoners as soon as the surrender was signed. fie would he personally re- sponsible for: the 350 American and Brit- ish POW's under his control. He also guaranteed that the important ports of Genoa and Trieste would be delivered intact. Dulles listened carefully to Wolff's proposal. He felt certain that he was telling the truth. At this late (late, the Gestapo had nothing to gain by such tactics. It was obviously a legitimate bid to surrender. I f it could be worked out, it would save thousands of American lives. Wolff departed with Dulles' promise to contact Allied HQ at Caserta to ar- range another meeting. On March 13th, things started moving quickly in \"Operation Sunrise Cross- word,\" as Dulles had dubbed it. Two \"sergeants\" from Allied headquarters, Nicholson and McNeely, arrived in Berne that day. They went directly to Dulles on the Herrengasse. For six clays, the two men lived there behind drawn shades, the reason for the security was obvious. The two \"sergeants\" were really U. S. Major General Lyman L. Lem- nitzer, Assistant Chief of Staff at Caserta, and British Major General Terence S. Airey, the Combined Command's In- telligence Chief. They were to meet with Dulles and Wolff on March 19th to ar- range the surrender. On the 19th, the German and Ameri- can delegation met near Locarno in two villas borrowed for the occasion. The American villa had a secret radio that kept Dulles in constant touch with our headquarters. The meeting went off fine so far as details were concerned. But a major hitch had come up since the last meeting. Kesselring had been transferred from Italy and replaced by Colonel General Heinrich von Vietinghoff, who was not yet sold on unconditional surrender. Nothing could be done until Vietinghoff agreed. Meanwhile our Army's advance was cutting the line of communication be- He could then radio Dulles in a secret American code. Little Wally, a Czech refugee, got the perilous job and he was installed behind the enemy lines in SS Lieutenant Zimmer's Milan apartment overlooking Mussolini's secret hideout. Dulles and Wolff kept in constant touch, but Vietinghoff had not yet changed his mind. To help persuade him, Nazi General Wolff asked Little Wally to radio Allied Headquarters and ask for a slight \"touch-up\" bombing raid on Vietinghoff's headquarters. Wally was also kept busy directing Allied aircraft to likely targets in the area. Nothing much happened for almost a month. Then.on April 21, Allied Head- quarters abruptly told Dulles to cut off his talks with the Germans. Dulles wasn't told, but Stalin had become distrustful of our OSS chief. Stalin had written both Churchill and Roosevelt spouting fire because he was sure Dulles was negotiat- ing a separate peace with Germany. President Roosevelt assured Stalin that the plan was purely a military surrender. A Soviet representative would be invited, should anything concrete develop. Finally, on April 24, 1945, Little Wally sent news that Vietinghoff had agreed. Wolff and his aides met .Dulles in Switzer- land. They waited for news from Allied HQ in Caserta. By April 27, the Russian fears had obviously been soothed for headquarters gave permission for the surrender. Wolff's two representatives were flown to Caserta where the docu- ments were signed on April 29th. A few days later, on May 2, 1945-five days be- fore Germany capitulated-the 600,000 Nazi soldiers in Italy laid down their guns. Without so much as firing a single shot, Allen Dulles had delivered a German Army. When the war ended, Dulles moved to Germany as head of our OSS mission there, then went back into private law practice for a few years. But in January, 1951, he answered a call from the CIA. By August of that same year he was named the Agency's Deputy Director. In February, 1953, he was placed in charge of the entire organization. When President Truman set up the CIA in 1947, it was according to the recommendations of a three man commit- tee, one of whom was Allen Welsh Dulles. The organization was put in charge of all undercover work previously handled by Army, Navy, and Air Force G-2 sec- tions. Whenever called to, the CIA makes its important \"crash reports\" to the Pres- ident and the National Security Coun- cil. These National Estimates contain not only information secured by es- pionage, but a round-up of intelligence obtained by analysis of foreign newspa- pers, magazines, and radio broadcasts. Once a week, the day before the Na- tional Security Council meeting.`at the White House, Dulles meets with the In- telligence Chiefs of the F13I, State t fe- lowing day Dulles makes his. weekly re- port at the National Security Council meeting. Assisting Allen Dulles in running the CIA is Lieutenant General Charles Pearrc Cabell, Deputy Director of Cen- tral Intelligence and former Director of Intelligence for the Air Force. Robert Amory, Jr., a 38-year-old former Profes- sor of Law at Harvard, is in charge of the vital Intelligence Division. The CIA has a reputation for employ- ing more super-civil servants ($12,000- $14,000) than any other bureau in Washington. The Agency's hush-hush policy keeps the public from learning much about its work. But occasionally something happens that brings the CIA to our attention. ~ Not long ago, for example, CIA agents in Germany saved America a great deal of embarrassment. A Soviet Guards Offi- cer, Red Army Lieut. Colonel J. D. Tas- soyev, crossed the Iron Curtain and ap- proached American agents, saying he wanted to desert the Russian Army. He loved democracy, and had lots of secrets to tell. He was a real find for an intelli- gence agent, but something smelled wrong to the sensitive nose of the CIA. The orders were \"Hands off.\" The British, however, were more gul- lible. They flew Tassoyev to London in Montgomery's personal plane and set him up in a fancy West Kensington flat complete with blond female agent Betty Wiggin. But instead of talking, the Red Army \"deserter\" asked questions. What was the route other deserters had taken? How did Allied Intelligence learn so much about Russia? The Tommies soon learned that they had been taken. The not-so-clever MVD Colonel was promptly flown back behind the Curtain. Another time, the CIA showed a curi- ous American general the extent of the Agency's knowledge. A high-ranking Air Force official asked how much help the Agency could give him in determining bomb targets in a certain \"Country X,\" a potential enemy. In five minutes, CIA officials produced complete dossiers of every significant target in the nation, several thousand in all. The general was deeply impressed. Actually, things haven't changed too much since Dulles' eventful years on the Herrengasse. Today, Dulles' office is at 2430 E. Street, Washington, instead of Berne, Switzerland. The aggressor is the Soviet Union instead of Nazi Germany. But the work of masterminding an intri- cate espionage and intelligence network for the United States is old hat to the master spy with the innocent air. Should we ever doubt it, we have only to listen to the cackling criticism of Dulles offered by Ilya Ehrenberg, the Kremlin's best propagandist: \"Even if the spy Allen Dulles should arrive in heaven through somebody's ab- sent-mindedness, he would begin to blow up the clouds, mine the stars, and slaugh- ter the angels.\" ? 4R Approved For Release 2000/08/03 : CIA-RDP70-00058R000100100047-8"
