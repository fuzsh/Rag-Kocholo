Their lifes and careers later took different directions, and they faced two completely different destinies.Avantgarde German filmmaker Walther Ruttmann (born in Frankfurt am Main, in 1887), created his first movies in 1921. The films were short animation experiments titledOpus 1, 2, 3 e 4.Later, Ruttmann created the Impressionistic \"City Symphony\" movement when he releasedBerlin: Symphony of a Big Cityin 1927. A rhythmic, documentary-look at the city's industry and daily life, the film inspired a number of imitators. Before becoming an experimental filmmaker in the early '20s, Ruttman was a painter and an architect. In 1924, he helmed the dream sequence in Lang'sDie Niebelungen, and two years later collaborated with Lotte Reiniger to create the first feature-length animated film,The Adventures of Prince Achmed. Following the success ofBerlin, Ruttman joined the Nazi Party and later made another\"City Symphony\"film calledWorld Melodyin 1929.In 1933Ruttmann directed a Futuristic film in Italy,Steel, written by the Italian Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello. He helped edit Leni Riefenstahl'sOlympia, in 1938. During WWII, he made propaganda films for the Nazis. Ruttmann was wounded while filming a battle on the eastern front in 1941. Recovered in Berlin, he died soon after.\n\nWalther RuttmannWalther Ruttmann in 1927\n\nBorn in Berlin, Germany in 1888, animator Hans Richter started out as a Cubist painter in Berlin. With artists Tristan Tzara and Jean Arp, he helped establish Dadaism in Zurich in 1916. Working in Germany with Viking Eggeling in the 1920s, he produced the short filmsRythm 21,Rythm 23andRythm 25, as well as, among the others,Film StudyandGhosts Before Breakfast. In the late 1920s and 1930s, Richter turned to advertising and lecturing before quitting Nazi Germany and settling in New York in the 1940s. In the US he produced live-action experimental films. Between 1942 and 1957, he was the director of the Film Institute of the City College of New York. Hans Richter passed away in Switzerland in 1976.\n\nHans RichterHans Richter, first on the left, in New York City, circa 1941\n\n-------\n\n1919germany-EinzudDerWurtemberger.mp4\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:07:32Audio/Visual:silent,B&W Quality: # # # # Einzud Der Wurtemberger (1919)\n\nProducer: Unknown\n\nThe 1919 Bavarian Communist Republic putsch is stopped by the German army machine guns.

Walther Ruttmann did not make a documentary about Berlin, although 75 after date it certainly can be considered a document about a Berlin that is no more, he composed a film that tries to catch the essence of the atmosphere of a big city. The film is a good example of the art style Neue Sachlichkeit (functionalism): it is a cross-section of Berlin's life in which every element is equally important, shown without comment and in its totality it is the expression of the joy of Berlin's life. It is not a film about the life of Berliners, it is Berlin seen as a living mechanism.\n\nThe subtitle referring to Großstadt (big city) is the key, it could have been any other city. The idea as such is not the makers' prerogative. Elsewhere the fascination with the hustle and bustle of the big city was also present as was the idea to catch this on this film and in music: e.g. Cavalcanti in France made a film about Paris and the US Ferde Grofé composed his musical suite Metropolis (1927) with New York in his mind. The irony of all these endeavours is that the film or music is abstract, but that the result is a romanticizing view.\n\nRuttmann made several abstract film and he refers to them in the beginning with abstract horizontal lines dissolving to rail way tracks. In my view the rest of the film is also abstract. Although we see real people and situations the brilliant editing constantly keeps the film abstract: the situation and the people in a shot are not important, important is the juxtaposition to other shots: is the composition varied enough?. Thus we see a filmic composition (in stead of a musical one) and the subtitle Symphony is just. As with every composition the theme has to be modulated to keep it interesting and it is here where the weakness of the film is. The building up from the start and elaboration up to the beginning of the afternoon is splendid, precise and exiting; but from that point it bogs down for a while: we see another shop, another street etc. without adding much to what already was. It may be that Ruttmann was aware of this, note how quickly he finishes the afternoon to continue with the night-life and then immediately all the excitement and filmic fun is back.\n\nIn an 1939 interview cameraman Karl Freund said that everything possible was filmed using only candid cameras. I have my doubts. Let's take for example the sequence of the drowning lady: how could he make an extreme close-up with a hidden camera in such a brilliant angle? (By the way: if she really tried to commit suicide, was Freund himself not only one of the gaping bystanders without doing anything to save her?) How could he foresee the right angle to film the prostitute picking up her client near the cornered shop window? Not that it matters for the quality of the film, but it proofs the old adagium: filming is deceiving.\n\n1927berlin-STILLS.mov\n\nAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:07:56Audio/Visual: Silent/B&W Quality: # # # # #Producer: Romano-ArchivesSlide-show of stills from theWalther Ruttman's movie\"Berlin, die Symphonie der Großstadt\"(Berlin, Symphony of a Big City) (1927).1928CubismWeimarBerlin.mov\n\nAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:00:55Audio/Visual: Silent/B&W Quality: # # # Excerpt from epoca German newsreels.

What are its outstanding features and contributions?\n\nPeter Lorre's portrayal of a serial killer is one of the defining performances of movie history. Not only did it set the benchmark for his own career (something which he may have regretted for years to follow) it also defined the role of the psychopatic killer for all the future movie productions.\n\nIt was one of the very first movies with audio track. Fritz Lang handled the new medium of sound in a very professional manner, employing off-voices and personal music themes (he even goes so far as tieing a specific melody - Grieg's \"Hall Of The Mountain King\" - to the dangerous state of the murderer, in one of the most impressive scenes of the movie the Beckert tries to supress his devious instincts and as he struggles to control himself he starts whistling the trademark melody until his transformation into the killer is complete). These are traits that may be quite common for today's good movies but it is absolutely brilliant for a director's very first experience with a brand-new technology.\n\n\"M\"is the predecessor to all serial killer thrillers like \"Psycho\" and \"The Silence Of The Lambs\", one of the defining movies of European pre-WWII cinema and much more.\n\n\"M\"premiered May 11th 1931 in the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin to the standing ovations of an enthusiastic audience.\n\n\"M\" was outlawed once the Nazis came into power and pictures of Peter Lorre's portrayal of \"M\" ended up in the chilling anti-Semitic propaganda movie \"Der Ewige Jude\" (The Eternal Jew).Peter Lorre in the lower right.In \"Der Ewige Jude\" the narrator reads:Der Jude Lorre in der Rolle eines Kindermörders. Nach dem Schlagwort: \"Nicht der Mörder, sondern der Ermordete ist schuldig\", wird versucht, das normale Rechtsempfinden zu verdrehen und durch mitleiderregende Darstellung des Verbrechers das Verbrechen zu beschönigen und zu entschuldigen.\n\nTranslation:The Jew Lorre in the role of a child murderer.

In 1927, theNational Socialist Society for German Culture was formed.Theaim of this organization was to halt the \"corruption of art\" and inform the people about the relationship between race and art. By 1933, the terms \"Jewish,\" \"Degenerate,\" and \"Bolshevik\" were in common use to describe almost all modern art.In 1937, Nazi officials purged German museums of works the Party considered to be \"degenerate\". From the thousands of works removed, 650 were chosen for a special exhibit ofEntartete Kunst. The exhibit opened in Munich and then traveled to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. In each installation, the works were poorly hung and surrounded by graffiti and hand written labels mocking the artists and their creations. Over three million visitors attended making it the first \"blockbuster\" exhibition.Here is a complete list of the artists included in the exhibit's catalog.* Adler, Jankel* Barlach, Ernst* Bauer, Rudolf* Bauknecht, Philipp* Baum, Otto* Baumeister, Willi* Bayer, Herbert* Beckmann, Max* Belling, Rudolf* Bindel, Paul* Brün, Theo* Burchartz, Max* Burger-Mühlfeld, Fritz* Camenisch, Paul* Caspar, Karl* Caspar-Filser, Maria* Cassel, Pol* Chagall, Marc* Corinth, Lovis* Davringhausen, Heinrich* Dexel, Walter* Diesner, Johannes* Dix, Otto* Drexel, Hans Christoph* Dreisch, Johannes* Eberhard, Heinrich* Ernst, Max* Feibusch, Hans* Feininger, Lyonel* Felixmüller, Conrad* Freundlich, Otto* Fuhr, Xaver* Gies, Ludwig* Gilles, Walter* Gleichmann, Otto* Grossmann, Rudolph* Grosz, George* Grunding, Hans* Haizmann, Richard* Hausmann, Raoul* Hebert, Guido* Heckel, Erich* Heckrott, Wilhelm* Heemskerck, Jacoba van* Heister, Hans Seibert von* Herzog, Oswald* Heuser, Werner* Hoerle, Heinrich* Hoefer, Karl* Hoffman, Eugen* Itten, Johannes* Jawlensky, Alexej von* Johansen, Eric* Kallmann, Hans Jürgen* Kandinsky, Wassily* Katz, Hans* Kirchner, Ernst Ludwig* Klee, Paul* Klein, Cesar* Kleinschmidt, Paul* Kokoschka, Oskar* Lange, Otto* Lehmbruck, Wilhelm* Lissitzky, El* lüthy, Oskar* Marc, Franz* Marcks, Gerhard* Matare' Ewald* Meidner, Ludwig* Metzinger, Jean* Mitschke-Collande, Constantin von* Moholy-Nagy, Laszlo* Moll, Margarethe* Moll, Oskar* Molzahn, Johannes* Mondrian, Piet* Muche, George* Meuller, Otto* Nagel, Erich* Nauen, Heinrich* Nay, Ernst Wilhelm* Neistrath, Karel* Nolde, Emil* Pankok, Otto* Pechstein, Max* Watenphul, Max Peiffer* Purrmann, Hans* Rauh, Max* Richter, Hans* Röder, Emy* Rohlfs, Christian* Scharff, Edwin* Schlemmer, Oskar* Schlichter, Rudolph* Schmidt-Rottluff, Karl* Scholz, Werner* Schreyer, Lothar* Schubert, Otto* Schwitters, Kurt* Segal, Lasar* Skade, Friedrich* Stukenberg, Friedrich (Fritz)* Thalheimer, Paul* Tietz, Johannes* Topp, Arnold* Völker, Karl* Voll, Christoph* Wauer, William* Wollheim, GertMany of the artists included in theEntartete Kunstexhibition are now considered masters of the Twentieth Century. The Nazi Regime had a direct influence on the private and public life of many of those artist.Here are some example.Paul Klee is ranked as one of the most original masters of contemporary art. He was born in Bern, Switzerland and lived for many years in Germany. He was one of the instructors at theBauhaus. In 1931 he began teaching at Dusseldorf Academy, but he was dismissed by the Nazis, who termed his work \"degenerate.\" In 1933, Klee went back to his native Switzerland. He died on June 29, 1940.-------------During World War I Ernst Ludwig Kirchner was a volunteer in the army, but he could not stand the discipline and constant subordination. He suffered a nervous breakdown and was moved to a sanatorium, where he became dependent on Veronal (sleeping pills), morphine and alcohol. The addictions did not hinder him from painting. He slowly recovered, and worked on paintings and woodcuts. His art was exhibited in Switzerland and Germany. The Germans banned his work, and he became increasingly depressed. On June 15, 1938, he took his own life.------------Emile Nolde was an expressionist painter and graphic artist known for his religious works. His distortion and violent use of color attracted the attention of Die Brücke resulting in an invitation in 1906 to join the group. Nolde's temperament was not suited for collective work and he left Die Brücke in 1907 after learning the technique of woodcut. Nolde was able to remain in Germany during the Nazi regime, but over one thousand of his works were confiscated.----------\n\nMax Beckman was influenced by Edvard Munch. Beckman served in the medical corps during World War I, an experience that led to extreme pessimism in his artwork. Many of his paintings were sold by the Third Reich after theEntartete Kunstexhibition. Beckman was able to escape to Amsterdam and then eventually made his way to the United States.-----------Otto Dix was another expressionist painter whose work was influenced by the experience of World War I. He was appointed professor at the Dresden State Academy, but was dismissed in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. Two hundred sixty of Dix's paintings were removed from German museums in 1937. Many of these were burnt on Goebbels's order. Dix survived on a remote farm until 1945 when he was drafted by the Nazis and then captured by the French and made a prisoner of war. After the war, Dix returned to teaching.----------Not every artist considered by the Nazis to be \"degenerate\" was included in theEntartete Kunstexhibit. One such artist was Käthe Kollwitz whose paintings, drawings, and sculptures were commentaries on social conditions. She was much loved by the German people, with streets and parks being named after her. Käthe Kollwitz became the first woman elected to the Prussian Academy of Art in Berlin. But because her work was critical of the Nazism, she becamepersona non grata. She was expelled from the academy in 1933.Kollwitz believed that art should reflect social conditions in one's time. The Nazis forbade her work to be displayed, and banished her sculpture from the cellar of the Crown Prince Palace, declaring \"In the Third Reich mothers have no need to defend their children. The State does that\".\n\nAn enlarged version of Käthe Kollwitz's Mother with Dead Son was done by Harald Haake and stands in the middle of theNeue Wachein Berlin.-----------Paul Fuhrmann'sKriegsgewinnler(War Profiteer), an oil painting from 1932 was a clear statement against the rising regime-art. Two of Fuhrmann's works were included in theEntartete Kunstexhibition.-----------Julius (Julo) Levin was considered a degenerate artist by the Nazis. He was arrested and died in Auschwitz.------------Fortunately, many prominent artists were able to escape German-controlled Europe thanks to Varian Fry.Fry was an American who went to France on behalf of the Emergency Rescue Committee with the mission of rescuing artists, writers, academics, and others at risk. Fry and his co-workers were able to rescue 4,000 at-risk persons including artists Max Ernst and Marc Chagall.The Emergency Rescue Committee (now known as the International RescueCommittee) still provides relief, protection, and resettlement services forrefugees and victims of oppression or violent conflict.If you want to know more about the Entartete Kunst exibit there is a great thesis, 57 pages in pdf format, courtesy of Maren Laurel Read from the University of North Carolina at Capel Hill.\n\nCopy and pastethe following link to download it. http://www.google.it/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unc.edu%2F~mlread%2FThesis%2520Complete%2520Version.pdf&ei=ieraUMH4C8bNtAaloYDQDQ&usg=AFQjCNEy9UEnVElWUbqHKzS7moDp-KEVRQ&bvm=bv.1355534169,d.Yms1937GoebbelsSpeechOnGermanArt.mp4\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:01:09Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W Quality: # # # #Part of a Goebbels' 1937 speech on Art in Nazi Germany.

They outlawed it on their homefront, throwing it into the category of \"degenerate\" art, but at the same time, they employed it in the service of the Fatherland. Paul Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, assembled a fairly competent Swing band called Charlie and His Orchestra to perform Nazified versions of the Jazz hits of the day.\n\nLed by an English speaking German, Karl Schwendler, Charlie and His Orchestra broadcast on the medium-wave and short-wave bands, throughout the 1930s and the early 40ies, to Canada, the US and Britain.The idea was to lure the masses in with the irrestible tonic of Swing music and then slyly work in the anti-Jewish, American and British lyrics after the second or third verse.\n\nThe broadcasts of Charlie and His Orchestra were not available in the Fatherland proper, but that only enhanced their legend, and they picked up an underground following in Germany as well.\n\nHere are 3 samples of lyrics from songs performed by Charlie and His Orchestra:-----\n\nYou're Driving Me Crazy\n\nHere is Winston Churchill's latest tearjerker:\n\nYes, the Germans are driving me crazy.\n\nI though I had brains, but they shattered my planes.\n\nThey've built up a front against me, it's quite amazing\n\nClouding the skies, with their planes.\n\nThe Jews are the friends who are near me to cheer me, believe me they do.\n\nBut Jews are the kind that will hurt me, desert me and laugh at me too.\n\nYes, the Germans are driving me crazy,\n\nmy last chance I'll pray, to get in this muddle the U.S.A.\n\nThis new pact also is driving me crazy, Germany, Italy, Japan, it gives me a pain.\n\nI'm losing my nerve, I'm getting lazy\n\nA prisoner forced to remain in England to reign.\n\nThe Jews are the friends who are near me, that still cheer me, believe me they do.\n\nBut Jews are not the kind of heroes who would fight for me, now they're leaving me too.\n\nYes, the Germans are driving me crazy, by Jove, I pray, come in U.S.A.\n\n-----\n\nF.D.R Jones\n\nIt's a Hebrew holiday everywhere,\n\nAll the Jewish family has a brand new heir,\n\nHe's their joy heaven sent,\n\nAnd they proudly present,\n\nMr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones,\n\nHe's grown up, but I'm afraid he will stray,\n\nWith a name like the one he's got today,\n\nHe sends the boys to Iceland's shore, to engage in foreign wars,\n\nMr. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones,\n\nNon-intervention, how he shows it,\n\nHis decision to send troops along,\n\nOh what a jam and I bet he knows it,\n\nBut the folks in the world all agree,\n\nHe's aggressive, aggressive as he can be,\n\nIf he could he'd like to be, known to those in history,\n\nAs the big Emperor D. Roosevelt Jones.\n\n-----\n\nWho's Afraid Of the Big Bad Wolf\n\nListen to the BBC, BBC, BBC,\n\nListen to the BBC, tra-la-la-la,\n\nWho's preaching world democracy, democracy, democracy?\n\nWho wants to make free people free? tra-la-la-la\n\nFirst they won the war in France,\n\nThen they said they no chance,\n\nEach time the Germans did advance,\n\nHow could they have a chance?\n\nThey told stories so divine,\n\nOft'n marched across the Rhine,\n\nGermans eat only rats and mice,\n\nBut in England all was fine,\n\nBye-Bye Churchill, BBC, BBC, BBC\n\nYour tricks won't work with Italy, tra-la-la-la,\n\nWhy not give us different news, different news, different news,\n\nSkip those Soviets, skip those Jews, tra-la-la-la.\n\n-----\n\nThe notion of this material having its desired effect seems ludicrous in retrospect, but imagine yourself an East Coast resident of the United States during a period when victory over the Nazis was not assured. As you scan the radio dial aware that German U-boats may be trolling the seas miles away from your home, you come across the song \"Submarines.\" If the desired effect was to crush morale and instill fear, these songs probably worked great. As recruitment tools for the Nazi party, Charles Lindbergh probably did a better job.In some sense, the point of Jazz is to inspire a visceral reaction, an unfiltered, direct emotion. Never was this more true than during the 20ies and the 30ies, when Jazz was young, new, and shockingly unconventional.\n\nThis American music was outrageously popular not just in the United States, but also in other parts of the world—including places where English was not the primary language. In the 1930s and 1940s, German residents were just as enamored of Jazz as everyone else, but Nazi leaders saw it as much more than mere entertainment: they saw it as a threat. For one thing, the Nazis felt that Jazz lyrics encouraged a level of sexual permissiveness that was at odds with the standards they set. But more deeply, Jazz represented the enemy—both literally, in the sense of its being American, and figuratively in the sense that its African roots made it racially degenerate, an offense to Aryan purity. To enjoy Jazz music was to thumb your nose at the Nazi cause. There were also those who claimed that American Jews were behind the whole Jazz movement, and the Nazi anti-Semitic rage only added to their distrust of Jazz.Hitler’s government tried repeatedly and in various ways (though with mixed success) to outlaw Jazz. Playing, listening to, or owning recordings of Jazz music was made illegal—and that included listening to Jazz from abroad on a shortwave radio. The very worst form of Jazz, from the Nazi perspective, was Swing, which was especially popular among young people. German youth frequently used Swing music and dancing as their outlet for rebellion—in this case, rebellion against the Nazi values in general and the Hitler Youth in particular. Many of the young people who were caught at covert Swing parties were sent to concentration camps. But, of course, every attempt to wipe out Swing just galvanized its fans further. The surest way to make something desirable, after all, is to forbid it...\n\nOf course, while making the music of Charlie and His Orchestra freely available overseas, the Nazis did their best to keep it from the German public. Despite the pro-Nazi lyrics, the government could not be seen promoting a form of music it had gone out of its way to repudiate. So although all Swing music was forbidden to Germans, the music of Charlie and His Orchestra was the most forbidden, with extremely severe penalties for those caught listening. Naturally, this increased the band’s popularity within Germany.The band members themselves, curiously enough, were not particularly sympathetic to the Nazi cause. Karl \"Charlie\" Schwedler may have been in it for the money, and some of the band members, who spoke little English, would later say they did not even realize what the lyrics said. But playing in the band paid well and exempted the members from military service. More importantly, it may have saved the lives of some members. Drummer Fritz Brocksieper, for example, had a Jewish grandmother, and so would have been considered Jewish according to Nazi reckoning...Fritz Brocksieper\n\nAlso curious is the fact that the group developed a significant following among Americans who were exposed to their music. This either says a lot for their music or very little for their lyrics—but in any case, the propaganda was clearly ineffective.\n\nThe individual members of Charlie and His Orchestra went on to successful careers in music after the war, their unique songs all but forgotten once the authentic originals were again in free circulation. All in all, not a bad gig for a bunch of musicians who found themselves on the wrong side of a war...Those rare original tracks of Charlie and His Orchestra, digitalized as mp3 in top audio quality are included upon request, free of charge, in the DVD with the video(s) for private use you'll order from this Collection:01 - Nice People02 - Thanks For The Memory03 - Indian Love Call04 - The Sheik Of Araby05 - Lets Put Out The Lights06 - Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen07 - Lilli Marleen08 - Elmers Tune09 - Picture Me Without You10 - I Double Dare You11 - Macpherson Is Rehearsin12 - I Cant Give You Anything But Love13 - Daisy14 - Stardust15 - Submarines16 - United Air Man17 - I Got Rhythm18 - And So Another Lovely Day Is Over19 - Roll On The Blue Funnel20 - Under An Umbrella In The Evening21 - Calling Invasion Forces22 - Atlantic Wall (Incomplete)23 - You're Driving Me Crazy 24 - You Can't Stop Me From Dreaming25 - Saint Louis Blues 26 - Slumming On Park Avenue27 - Dinah 28 - Daisy 29 - FDR Jones30 - Who'll Buy My Bublitchky 31 - I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket32 - The King's Horses 33 - I've Got A Pocketful Of Dreams34 - Three Little Fishes35 - Why'd Ya Make Me Fall In Love?36 - Miss Annabelle Lee 37 - South of the Border38 - Hold Tight 39 - The Man With The Big Cigar40 - I'm Sending You The Siegfried Line 41 - Bye Bye Blackbird42 - Japanese Sandman 43 - Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?44 - Untern Linden-----1936berlin-OlimpicGames.mp4\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:08:24 Audio/Visual: sound, C Quality: # # # # #\n\nBerlin - Reichshauptstadt 1936 (1936)\n\nNazi propaganda complete color film from 1936.

HItler arrives at the Berghof with an Italian delegation leaded by Count Ciano. The Fuhrer partecipates in a \"spontaneous way\" to what seems to be a funny joke about Goering told by Bruckner, Eva Braun's bodyguard. Bruckner says:\"Haben sie denn Herr Goring tanzen gesehen, mein Fuhrer?\", \"Have you seen Herr Goering dancing, my Fuhrer?\". Hitler reacts impersonating the way the rather heavy minister Goering danced. (This finally explains what was behind the \"Dancing Hitler\" or \"Hitler Dance\" clip, that's on line pratically since the Internet exist!!!). Then he changes uniform, meets his segretaries and friends and gives orders to various SS officers, Surprisingly, (maybe a Galeazzo Ciano's idea...) they listen to radio-news in English from the BBC!\n\nEva Braun private color amateur footage from September, 28 1938 filmed at the Berghof, near Berchtesgaden.

The expedition was also sent to find traces of the origins of the \"Aryan\" race in Tibet which was where Himmler thought evidence of could be found. As a follower of the Hollow Heart theory, Himmler was also looking in Tibet for the \"doors to Agharty\", the mythical underground town, home of the \"Unknown Masters\". This film is a Nazi era documentary of that expedition.\n\nErnst Schäfer (1910-1992) was a famous German hunter and zoologist in the 1930s, specializing in ornithology.\n\nHe is most famous for his three expeditions to Tibet in 1931, 1934-1935, and 1938-1939, the first two led by the American Brooke Dolan II, and the third led by himself under the patronage of Himmler's Ahnenerbe organization.\n\nIn July 1934, during his second expedition in Asia, he met the then exiled Panchen Lama, Thubten Chökyi Nyima, in Hangzhou, China.\n\nSchäfer joined the SS in 1933, but after World War II he claimed to have been an unwilling recruit into the organization, a step necessary to advance his career.\n\nSchäfer wrote several books, including Berge, Buddhas und Bären (Mountains, Buddhas and Bears), and helped to produce this film.\n\nGeheimnis Tibet was never released to the public in Nazi Germany but intended as a film for SS internal use only.\n\n1939-MussoliniInDeutschland-SondersendungDerFox-wochenschau.movAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:30:56Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W\n\nQuality: # # #\n\nMussolini in Deutschland - Sondersendung der Fox-Wochenschau(1939)\n\nProducer: Universum Film (UfA)\n\nNazi propaganda film about the visit of Mussolini in Germany in 1939.1939-DeutscheFreiwilligeInSpanien-VomKampfDerLegionCondor.movAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:14:46Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W\n\nQuality: # # #\n\nDeutsche Freiwillige in Spanien - Vom Kampf der Legion Condor (1939)\n\nProduction: Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands (NSDAP)\n\nNazi propaganda film about the Legion Condor military mission in the Spanish Civil War.\n\n1939HitlerVisitsHisSchool.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:01:13 Audio/Visual: silent, C\n\nQuality: # # # #\n\n06-12-1939.

Thus, it isn't surprising that the film utilizes the historical facts at its disposal to prime the pumps for the Third Reich. Playing the title role is Paul Wegener, who during the Hitler regime was named Actor of the State and who, like Harlan, compromised his talent on behalf of Der Fatherland. Der Grosse Koenig won the Venice Film Festival Award and the Mussolini prize, though odds are the contests were fixed. On the strength of Der Grosse Koening, Veidt Harlan in 1944-45 was assigned to direct the famous money-squandering propaganda picture Kolberg (also available in this Collection).1942FlyingFortress.mpg\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:10:39Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W Quality: # # # # Mission accomplished: The Story of the Flying Fortress (1942)\n\nProducer: U.S. Office of War Information, Bureau of Motion PicturesChronicles one of the early (August 1942) missions of B-17s over Germany.1942-45made-CombatAmericaP1.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:13:17Audio/Visual: Sound/Color Quality: # # # # #1942-45made-CombatAmericaP2.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:13:33Audio/Visual: Sound/Color Quality: # # # # #1942-45made-CombatAmericaP3.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:16:02Audio/Visual: Sound/Color Quality: # # # # #1942-45made-CombatAmericaP4.mpegAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:16:43Audio/Visual: Sound/Color Quality: # # # # #Combat America (1945 - Filmed in 1942)\n\nSponsor: U.S. Office of War InformationProducer: U.S. Army Air ForcesFour reels 62 minutes movie.

The \"Memphis Belle\" took part in a great bombing raid on sub-pens in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. On their way they encounterd heavy AA fire and interceptors.The pilot was 24-year-old Captain Robert K. Morgan from Asheville, North Carolina who was an industrial engineer before joining the Army in 1941; the co-pilot, whom Captain Morgan insisted was \"the other pilot', was 25-year-old Captain James A. Verinis from New Haven, Connecticut, who was a business administration student at the University of Connecticut before entering the service in July of 1941; Captain Vincent B. Evans, the 23-year-old bombadier was one of the two married members of the crew, and was a fleet-truck operator in his home town of Fort Worth, Texas before enlisting in January of 1942; Captain Charles B. Leighton, from East Lansing,Michigan and a chemistry student at Ohio Wesleyan before entering the service, was the navigator. The engineer and top turret gunner was Technical Sergeant Harold P.Loch, a 23-year-old stevedore from Green Bay, Wisconsin who joined the service in November of 1941; Technical Sergeant Robert J.Hanson, a construction worker from Washington state and the other married crew member, was the radio operator. The 19-year-old \"baby\" of the Memphis Belle crew was waist-gunner Staff Sergeant Casimer A. Nastal who was a washing machine repairman from Detroit, Michigan with two confirmed fighter kills to his credit who thought he had more \"but never had time to watch whether they went down\"; Staff Sergeant Cecil H. Scott, a pressman for a rubber company in Rahway, New Jersey was the ball turret gunner and, at 27, the oldest member of the crew. One of the three cameraman was First Lieutenant Harold J. Tannenbaum, from Binghamton,New York, a World War I veteran who remained in the Navy until 1927. He re-entered the service in July,1942 when he received his commission in the Army Air Force. He was killed in action,age 46, in April of 1944 while filming this movie and received a posthumous Purple Heart.1944Germany-Bomb-Disposal.mp4\n\nAvailable on DVD\n\nRun Time: 00:01:09Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W Quality: # # # #A German bomb-disposal hero.

Compare with Mizoguchi's The Loyal 47 Ronin (1941-42); Sergei Eisenstein, Ivan the Terrible (1943); Lewis Seiler, Guadalcanal Diary (1943); Laurence Olivier, Henry V (1944):\n\nit is about war (the Franco-Prussian war of 1806-07)\n\nit shows men in combat\n\nit is made during another war (WW2)\n\nit is made for the war effort (propaganda).\n\nTo complete the filming, a top priority for Nazi Propaganda minister Paul Joseph Goebbels, thousands of Wermacht soldiers were taken out of the front line to partecipate in the battle sequences of \"Kolberg\" and quickly sent back to fight (and die) against the upcoming Red Army.\n\nGoebbels' sense that he was living in a film of the Nazi's own making. In April 1945 as Berlin was being encircled Goebbels spoke to his staff at the Propaganda Ministry about the spirit of resistance in the film \"Kolberg\" and predicted that an even more important historical film would one day be made about their final hours defending the Reich:\n\n\"Gentlemen, in a hundred years' time they will be showing another fine colour film describing the terrible days we are living through. Don't you want to play a part in this film, to be brought back to life in a hundred years' time? Everybody now has a chance to choose the part which he will play in the film a hundred years hence. I can assure you that it will be a fine and elevating picture. And for the sake of this prospect it is worth standing fast. Hold out now, so that a hundred years' hence the audience does not hoot and whistle when you appear on the screen.\"\n\nDetailed infos about this movie can be found here:http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/WarFilms/OldGuides/Kolberg.html1945Goebbels-totalerkriegundBerlingefallen.aviAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:03:12Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W Quality: # # # #Language: German\n\nEnglish SubtitlesMontage with Goebbels' speech on \"Total War\" at Berlin Sportpalatz and shots of the last battle for Berlin.1945LASTGERMANNEWSREEL-MARCH45.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:09:59Audio/Visual: Sound/B&W Quality: # # # Language: German\n\nEnglish SubtitlesGerman complete newsreel.

Frank CapraPropaganda documentary film directed by Frank Capra. Like its companion film, Know Your Enemy: Japan, the film is a full-length exploration of why one of the two major Axis countries started World War II and what had to be done to keep them from \"doing it again\".\n\nThe film opens with scenes of everyday life in Germany. It shows people such as housewives, policemen and farmers at work, and notes that these people weren't so different than us. Or are they? another narrator interrupts. The film then switches to a montage of Nazi concentration camps and piles of dead bodies. The narrator notes that this isn't the only time that Germany has unleashed war on the world, stating that while its generation fought the \"Nazis\", its fathers fought the \"Huns\" (pejorative term for Germany during World War I), and its grand father remembers the \"Prussians\". The narrator claims that its was all part of the same German lust for conquest.\n\nGoing even further back 150 years, the film informs us that while America, Britain, and France were forming their democratic traditions, Germany was a group of 300 medieval feudal states, not one of them with a constitution or parliament. The film traces the rise of Prussia from Frederick the Great through Bismarck, telling the audience that the Prussian state was dominated first by aristocratic landowners, militarists and state officials, later joined by the big industrialists. This development of a military industrial dominated state climaxes in World War I. When the above mentioned elements knew that they were beaten, according to the film, they put the democratic parties in charge in order to discredit the new republic. Once that was accomplished they found a stooge in Hitler, who would finally destroy the Weimar Republic with the addition of a 5th pillar - criminals.\n\nThe film depicts the Third Reich entirely from this perspective, seeing Nazism as simply a continuation of the aggressive German tradition, and then merely a façade for the military-industrial complex. Antisemitism is never mentioned explicitly, only implied when a picture of Julius Streicher is shown and the narrator mentions that he was a \"hatemonger\".1945-47 The Survived Germany1945-BerlinJune1945-Aer01.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:10:40Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.\n\n1945-BerlinJune1945-Aer02.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:03:12Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.1945-BerlinJune1945-Aer03.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:04:34Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.1945-Berlin1945-June-02.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:08:28Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.1945-Berlin1945-July-10.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:02:42Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.1945-Berlin1945-July-13.mp4\n\nAvailable on DVDRun Time: 00:09:32Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.1945-BerlinJuly1945-Truman.mp4Available on DVDRun Time: 00:05:21Audio/Visual: Silent/Color Quality: # # # Color footage filmed in Berlin By US Army Camera Units in the months following V-Day Europe.
