        "text": "AALFRED DELP, a Germa Jesuit priest, wrote his prison cell just be fore his execution the Nazis in the at tumn of 1944: “One da there will be other who will be allowed to live better an Atappier than we who have had die.” These ‘'others,” who form Ge. many's postwar generation, are sti questioning how out of political indil Terence Hitler's regime could hay evolved—a regime that afflicted th entire German people like a menu disease.\n\nIt is all more because of Germany's large culture and moral contribution to Europe earlier centuries.\n\nThis postwar generation though nocent of Hitler's crimes feels exce: sively burdened by guilt. Only th knowledge that thousands died in th struggle against Fascism in Nazi Gel many redeems the shame of bein german. Those who died fought alon or in organized groups.\n\nFather Delp was a member of group of military officers, civil sei vents, landowners, socialists, the logians and university professors wh tried to overthrow the Nazi Goverr ment thirty years ago today, on Jul 20, 1944. The attempt, known as th Officers’ Plot, failed as had eight pre##\n\nvious attempts since 1938.\n\nThese opponents of Hitler—his for In Germany became increasingly nt. merous during the war—did not conSider themselves part of a resistant organization but rather a legitimat opposition fighting an illegitimat\n\nBecause the earlier abortive assassination attempts had all been mad while Hitler was traveling, the key figures in the military opposition coneluded that to be successful an effort “would have to take place inside Hit ler's heavily guarded headquarters.\n\nIt was not until July I, 1944, the the opposition succeeded in placing Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg one of its members, within Hitler's her circle. There was not much tim to lose. Another member of the of position, the Social Democratic leader Julius Leber, designated by the conspirators as chancellor in the Ile, government to be formed after Hitler death, was arrested on July 5. Dr. Ca Friedrich Goerdeler, the former May( of Leipzig, designated as president new government, was under Gestap “'suspicion.\n\nOn July 20, Hitler was receiving military briefing at his headquarters East Prussia, known as Die Wolfschanze (“The Wolf's Lair”). He said his generals were standing around heavy oak table. Stauffenberg ha concealed a tithe bomb in a brief cm and placed the case underneath the table. The bomb exploded.\n\nHowever, the explosive charge ha ‘been prepared for a different barrack, with a stone floor, where general usually held briefings about the sits ation on the military fronts. This tim the meeting place had been change( Hitler survived.\n\nHitler's death would have automat ically led to the transfer of authority to the military high command in Berlin, which was the center of the oppo sition.\n\nStauffenberg, who had left the briefing room for a prearranged etele phone call, watched the explosio, from a distance and saw the barrack ,,leveled. He told Berlin that the coup d'etat had been successful.\n\nAll the military districts in Ger many as well as the occupied. coun tries were immedately notified bt Telex that “Operation Valkyrie” was to take effect. This meant that the army would arrest party leaders and officers of the SS (Elite Guard). in addition, it signaled occupation of the Government radio station and headquarters in Berlin.\n\nIn Vienna, Prague and Paris the operation went into partial effect; in Germany, several hours after the explosion headquarters issued a statement that Hitler had survived. The result was confusion and insecurity among the responsible officers, who began questioning the validity of the Valkyrie order from Berlin. Hitler himself spoke over the radio the same night. At 12:45 P.M. the bomb had exploded; by midnight the plot was broken. Later the conspirators were condemped to death.\n\nThe aims of the revolt were to form a provisional government until free elections could be held after the war, to begin immediate armistice negotiations, arrest the Nazi Government, stop the murdering of the Jews, open the concentration camps and put those responsible on trial,\n\nBetween July 20, 1944, and the end of the war in 1945 approximately 7,000 political enemies of Hitler were executed, 200 of them in connection with the Officers’ Plot. Their families were put Into concentration camps and prisons, their children under fifteen into a special camp in Bad Sachsa in central Germany.\n\nIn 1944 1 was eleven years old. heard about the revolt over the radio on the afternoon of July 21. I remember hearing the name of Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, whose autographed photo hung above by bed. We were vacationing in the country; it was a hot day, and the house was full of guests. My older brother was out shooting ducks. I was so upset by the newscast that I woke my mother from her midday nap. She said the news could not be true and reassured me that all would be cleared up later.\n\nThe next morning the photograph had disappeared. My mother had burned all incriminating evidence, including pictures and letters. On the next newscast more names of my father's friends were mentioned, deepening my fears that something terrible had happened. But even then it was too painful to imagine that my own father was implicated.\n\nHe was arrested in Berlin on the evening of July 20. We were arrested Aug. 7. I wanted to wear my Jungvolkuniform — the Hitler Youth uniform, worn by boys between eleven and fourteen—which I had never put on before. I wanted to prove we were Nazis although I knew by the way was brought up we were not. But mother refused firmly to let me put it on.\n\nI spent the first few weeks of our arrest in an orphanage in Gilstraw. Later I learned that my mother and brother were in prison in the same :own. Several days after my father's execution on Sept 9, my brother and were transferred to the children's camp at Bad Sachsa. We were given the name Seifert for our own protec, tion, we were told,'.because the other children, stanch Nazis; would ter‐##\n\nrorize us if. they.. learned our real lame. The authorities told us ‐offlandedly that.our father had already been executed’ and.that mother would be next, but She was not executed. ##At the time of the liberation, the motives and dirdensions of the oppo,sition movement, which lad reached is climax with ‘the Officers’ Plot, were still largely unknown.\n\nIn Germany of 1944, the pro‐Nazi mass hysteria, sustained by the military successes of the earlier years, had given way to sullen apathy. Neither the revelations of Nazi crimes nor the imminence of military defeat could stir the',people. The cities’ were being bombed, andlthe civilians’ main concern was survival.\n\nThe moral and political insensitivity of the German people in 1944 was misinterpreted by everyone including the German opposition. Germans who had beer) involved in active resistance lived as strangers in their own country, often in complete isolation, threatened by denunciations even by their own’ families, terrorized by the Gestapo. They could not have anticipated the people's reaction had the Officers’ Plot been successful.\n\nWhat ‘happened July 20 created nothing but indifference.\n\nIn 1944 hardly anyone in the opposition really believed in the possibility of constructing a new and better Germany once Hitler was dead. Everyone knew that a military defeat could not be avoided, that the Allies would insist on unconditional surrender and that they would not prevent the. Soviet Union from occupying eastern Germany.\n\nFrom documents on hand today, we know., that the motives behind the Officers Plot were more moral than political. The risk of self‐liberation had to be undertaken to save Germany's honor.\n\nIt was amazing that both high officers in the German Army and members of the Prussian—the so‐called Junker—aristocracy, realizing the political futility of the attempt to assassinate Hitler, risked their lives. Indeed, not one of the great aristocratic names of Prussia is missing from the death list.\n\nIt’ has been said that only the military was in the position to organize a revolution and that only the aristocrats who held high civil‐service, jobs were aware of. the illegality of the Nazi regime. In reality, the resistance was composed of an elite from all classes, traditions and regions of Germany.\n\nThe nonpolitical middle classes found ways of spiritual resistance against the state's totalitarian damends.\n\nIt was the tragedy of the abortive middle‐class revolution of 1848 all over again, when the spirit was killed by the bayonet, when democratic ideals were stamped out by convincing the German peOple that history was made only with blood and steel. Suppression of all the political instincts of this middle class led to resentment against all things political.\n\nSimilarly, indifference over the death of the unpopular Weimar Republic later produced a complete withdrawal from political life.\n\nUnder the Nazis, on the other hand, there was the demand for a total commitment. Thus for the middle classes opposed to the regime the word “political” became a synonym for “immoral.” The middle classes withdrew into the family and the church and found solace in literature. And this is the way the middle classes in East Germany still live.\n\nThe Social Democratic oriented working classes were from the beginning the natural political enemy of the totalitarian state. Ever since the’ days of Bismarck they had to’ fight and make sacrifices for their democratic rights and liberties. Their political convictions resulted from simultaneous development of trade unions and the Social Democratic party. In contrast with the aristocracy and the middle classes, the working classes were deeply attached to the Weimar Republic, despite the rise of unemployment.\n\nImmediately after Hitler took power, he ordered the arrest of Social Democrats and Communists, in and out of Parliament. By July 31, 1933, he had put 26,789 of them into concentration camps, and many more were murdered.\n\nThe collaboration between the Social Democrats, who were constantly under Nazi surveillance, and the military Opposition could only take place in 1943 when Social Democratic and Christian Union’ leaders took part in planning the future state after the fall of the Hitler regime.\n\nHundreds of Social Democrats were arrested after July 20, 1944, and even though they were not part of the Officers’ Plot they were executed."
