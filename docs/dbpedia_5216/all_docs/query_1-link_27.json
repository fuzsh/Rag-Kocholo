The subject of the round table was the persecution of the Serbs, Jews and Roma by the Independent State of Croatia and its troops in Herzegovina in the period from 1941 to 1945. The interest in this conference was great, and more than 70 participants took part in its proceedings – academicians, university professors, PhDs, PhD students, writers, representatives of the Zahumlje-Herzegovina and Maritime Diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church, prefects, deputy prefects and mayors of Eastern Herzegovinian municipalities, lawyers investigating war crimes and genocide, directors of companies and institutions, media representatives, National Liberation War (NOR) veterans, survivors of the atrocities committed on the territory of Herzegovina in the Second World War, their descendants and family members, and many others. Both the presented papers, written analytically and supported by irrefutable and verifiable evidence, and the survivor and witness accounts heard, pointed out that major atrocities were committed in Eastern Herzegovina between 1941 and 1945. Herzegovina is a vast area of execution, with a myriad individual sites where crimes were done, the River Neretva and its one-hundredkilometre-long banks being among the gravest ones. The presenters particularly stressed the cruelty with which the crimes were committed. Responsible for all those atrocities is the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which it committed in collaboration with its fascist-Nazi followers and with the support and assistance of the Catholic Church. Next-door neighbours, members of the Croatian people and Muslims, were especially prominent in the reckless liquidation of innocent Serbs, Jews and Roma, as stressed by the round table participants. Genocidal crimes were mostly committed against helpless victims – the elderly, children, pregnant women, even unborn children, who were forcefully removed from their mothers’ stomachs, only because they belonged to another nation and another religion.\n\n9\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nIt was particularly stressed that all crimes must be investigated and must not be forgotten, and that we must cherish the memory of the innocent victims and mark accordingly all places of persecution. It is very important to document all victims of the atrocities, as well as the perpetrators of those heinous acts. Just as the victims had identities of their own, so did those who committed those bestial crimes. In the end, it was concluded that such round tables must be organised in the future.\n\n10\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\n11\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\n12\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\n13\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\n14\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\n15\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\n16\n\nSlavko Šanjević\n\nGREAT HELP FROM THE JASENOVAC – DONJA GRADINA ASSOCIATION I hereby open the first round table in Trebinje on “The Suffering of Serbs, Jews and Roma People by the Independent State of Croatia and its Troops from 1941 to 1945 in Herzegovina.” For this round table to function competently and efficiently, I propose the following working chairpersons: Prof. Vladimir Lukić, PhD, president of the “Jasenovac–Donja Gradina” Association; Saša Aćić, LL.B., from Banja Luka, Boško Buha, a history teacher from Nevesinje; journalist Manojlo Ćuk from Trebinje, and Slavko Šanjević. Let me greet the clergy of the The Eparchy of Zahumlje, Herzegovina and the Littoral, the mayor of Trebinje, mayors of municipalities of Eastern Herzegovina, deputy mayors and chairmen of municipal assemblies of municipalities of Eastern Herzegovina, directors of working organisations, the dean of the Faculty of Tourism and Hotel Management, Mr. Velimir Lojović, Academician Srboljub Živanović, president of the International Commission for the Truth on Jasenovac, and Jovan Mirković, museum curator at the Museum of Genocide Victims in Belgrade. I would like to give special regard to the members of the Executive Committee of the “Jasenovac – Donja Gradina” Association, headed by Prof. Vladimir Lukić, PhD, who have immeasurably helped us in organising this first round table, as well as all contributors who have prepared papers on this subject, who I will not name at this moment because they will be well introduced when they present their contributions. May we also greet the witnesses and all media representatives who are present, Mira Jovanović, a PhD student from the University of Zurich, Prof. 17\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nDrago Mastilović, PhD, from the University of East Sarajevo, the delegation of the Federation of Veterans Associations of the People’s Liberation War of Yugoslavia, Milenko Jahura, LL.B., member of the Management Board of the Prebilovci Serbian National Society from Belgrade, distinguished guests and all other visitors. I propose that we form a delegation to go tomorrow for a visit and lay flowers on the grave of Milan Bulajić, in the village of Vilusi in the Republic of Montenegro. I wish you successful work, a pleasant stay in Trebinje and Herzegovina have the desire to make this a new beginning, and that such events, in memory of our innocent suffered, be still. I invite Mr. Professor Dr. Vladimir Lukic, who gave unselfish contribution to meet here today to speak to us.\n\n18\n\nProf. Vladimir Lukić, PhD\n\nEVEN THE ITALIANS WERE APPALED Greetings to all present parties, especially those who will present their papers and testimonies. Since we have been trying to organise this assembly in Trebinje for more than five years, first and foremost I would like to thank Mr Slavko Šanjević, as well as Prof. Lojević who discovered him. Having in mind that places of mass execution from the Second World War have been more or less neglected and forgotten, we, the deans and professors of the University of Banja Luka, including Prof. Zdravko Marijanac, launched discussions about renovating Donja Gradina and founding the “Jasenovac – Donja Gradina” Association, as well as about adopting a more active approach to holding international conferences and turning the attention of numerous countries, institutions and individuals in the worlds to the crimes against Serbs, Jews and Roma people that have been committed in WWII by the Independent State of Croatia. We have also concluded that Donja Gradina has remained unexplored, unmaintained and undeveloped. Perhaps the state of this place of execution was best described in a paper by the Babić brothers from Kozarska Dubica, which they sent in 1998.\n\n“How to renovate the Donja Gradina Memorial Site” “Donja Gradina is more of a testimony of our dereliction and neglect than it is a monument worthy of those who found eternal rest there... The whole project should be aimed at charting what is probably our largest necropolis – and yes, it is the largest – into the world’s maps... The Serbian people have their Holy Mountain [Mount Athos in Greece, t/n], but that beacon of ours has never become a place of 19\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nmass pilgrimage for us, our Mecca. In the true sense of the word, we have no Mecca of our own. We have no Wailing Wall, no Yad Vashem. Can it be Gradina, where the atrocity was on a larger than even at the Skull Tower? Our answer is that yes, it can! Donja Gradina should be renovated in such a way that it becomes a place where not only Serbs gather, but also Jews and Roma people, a place of their pilgrimage as well.” Considering there were proposals to also build a monastery at Donja Gradina, the publicist Branislav Božić and I talked with the Bishop of Banja Luka Jefrem [Ephraim], which was another reason to direct more of our activities towards renovating Donja Gradina. The renovation program for Donja Gradina found was on the agenda of the Fourth International Conference on Jasenovac, held in Banja Luka in 2007. The Executive Committee decided to have all the material from previous conferences (Washington 1997, Banja Luka 2000, Jerusalem 2002) printed in the form of proceedings in Serbian and English and sent out all over the world along with the proceedings from the Fourth International Conference. After this conference we concluded that a significant number of our guests from all over the world, and even our own citizens, are getting the impression that in WWII there weren’t any crimes in many municipalities and villages across the Independent State of Croatia, which is absolutely not true. This is why we proposed and helped with the organisation of round tables: First and Second Round Table “Šušnjar 1941” in Oštra Luka in 2008 and 2010 (5,500 Serbs and 50 Jews killed) and the First Round Table “Garavice 1941,” held in Banja Luka in 2010 (12,000 Serbs and Jews killed). The proceedings from these round tables were printed in Serbian and English and were sent out into institutions of many world countries, primarily in countries of ex-Yugoslavia, then to Israel, Russia, USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Italy etc. Apart from these listed here, we have had: the First Round Table on the crimes on Mount Kozara and the surrounding area, where 51,750 Serbs and 377 Jews had been killed; the First Round Table on atrocities in Glamoč, Duvno (Tomislavgrad), Livno, Grahovo and Kupres) in 2012, with 8267 Serbs and 25 Jews killed; the Third Round Table Šušnjar 1941, held in Oštra Luka in 2013; and the First Round Table in Trebinje in 2013. The preparation of the proceedings from these round tables is undergoing.\n\n20\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nThe Fifth International Conference, held in Banja Luka in 2011, yielded, among other things, the Declaration on Genocide of the NDH against Serbs, Jews and Roma people during the Second World War. The Sixth International Conference on Jasenovac will be held in the second half of May, 2014. The plan is to post all places of execution in the NDH to Google. ...... (I would like to ask Saša Aćić, secretary of the Executive Committee and member of the International Commission for the Truth on Jasenovac, to read the letter from an Italian General to Mussolini about the slaughter of Serbs in Prebilovci, i.e. in the Independent State of Croatia, as reported by Dr Hermann Neubacher.) Pavelić and his state are no better described in the extant Italian documents. On 25th April 1941, the then Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Galeazzo Ciano, wrote in his diary: “I see Pavelić, surrounded by his ruffians.” The Italians were revolted at the Croatian crimes in WWII, leaving a significant number of documents on that topic. One of the most heart-rending Italian documents on Croatian genocide against the Serbs is a letter from General Alessandro Luzano to Mussolini. We print the letter here:\n\n“Duce! I hope that my infinite devotion to you gives me the right to disregard strict military protocol in this one matter. It is for this reason that I am in a hurry to describe an event that I myself have witnessed in the past three weeks. In my tour of the counties of Stolac, Čapljina and Ljubinje (between 60 and 130 kilometres north of Dubrovnik), I learned from our intelligence officers that Pavelić’s Ustashas had on the previous day committed a crime in one of the villages (Prebilovci), and that once the word is out the Serbs in the region will be stirred. I am at a loss for words to describe what I have seen there. In a large school classroom, I found a teacher and 120 of her pupils, all slaughtered! None of the children were over 12 years of age! 21\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nThe word crime is a gross understatement – it was beyond all madness! Many of the bodies had been decapitated and the heads were lined up on the classroom desks. Some of them were disembowelled, and the entrails stretched out across the room, nailed to the walls! Swarms of flies and unbearable stench made it impossible for us to stay there for long. I noticed an opened bag of salt in a corner and was appalled when I realised that the victim’s throats had been slit slowly, while being sprayed with salt! And just as we were leaving we heard a child’s gurgle in the back row. I ordered two soldiers to look into it. They brought out a pupil, still alive, breathing with his throat half-slit! I transported the poor child in my car to our army hospital, where he regained conscience and told us the whole truth about the tragedy. The criminals had first taken turns raping the Serb teacher (her name was Jasmina Arnautović) and then killed her in front of the children. They even raped eight-year-old girls. All the while, a Gypsy band was forced to play their instruments. To the eternal shame of our Roman church, a man of God, a pastor, took part in the whole thing! The boy we rescued quickly recovered. And as soon as the wound healed, he used a moment of our recklessness and escaped from the hospital to his village, to look for his relatives. We sent a squad to retrieve him, to no avail – they found him at his doorstep with his throat slit! The thousand plus souls in the village had all perished! On the same day of the school massacre (which we only discovered later on) the Ustashas captured another 700 villagers of Prebilovci, threw them into a pit or savagely killed them on the way to the pit. Only around 300 men managed to survive – they were the only ones who managed to break through the Ustasha troops and escape into the mountains! These 300 survivors are more powerful than Pavelić’s most elite division! They had lost all that could be lost! Children, wives, sisters, homes, property. They were even cured of the fear of death. The only purpose of their lives has become revenge, where in a way they feel disgrace in surviving! And there are many villages such as Prebilovci all across Herzegovina, Bosnia, Lika, and Dalmatia. Slaughters against Serbs have reached such proportions that many water springs are contaminated. In Popovo Polje I personally witnessed reddish water spouting from a spring, which was near a pit 22\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nwhere 4,000 Serbs had been dispatched! There will be a permanent stain on the conscience of Italy and our culture, unless we distance ourselves from the Ustashas lest the insanity be ascribed to us as well!” .......... When Hitler’s special envoy for the Balkans, Dr Hermann Neubacher, delved deeper into the issue of the Serbs, he first attempted to put an end to Croatian crimes. In his memoirs, Neubacher describes the Croatian slaughter: “The slaughter of Serbs by Croats must be the most atrocious act of mass murder in the history of the world. I have heard Ustasha leaders boast about slitting the throats of a million Serbs, including nurselings, children, women and the elderly.” From the reports he had at his disposal, Neubacher estimates the number of slaughtered defenceless people to 750,000. .......... The genocide in Herzegovina was carried out in around 110 places of execution, most of which were “bottomless pits in the Independent State of Croatia, the butcher of the Serbian people 1941-...?,” as was written by Dane Lastavica in his book of the same title. Many bottomless pits in Herzegovina were full of dead, wounded, and in many cases living Serbs, and most of those pits were filled with concrete.\n\n23\n\nPAPERS\n\n25\n\nJovan Mirković, museum curator\n\nHERZEGOVINA-BORN VICTIMS OF THE 19411945 WAR according to the revised 1964 Census, with a special focus on the suffering of children and the elderly Abstract: Analyses based on the “Victims of the 1941-1945 War” database and the extent to which the victims of the war have been recorded in the region of 16 municipalities of Herzegovina at the time of the 1964 Census, broken down in categories with an emphasis on civilian victims and a focus on victims that are characteristic to crimes of genocide (children, women, the elderly), have shown that the NDH had committed not only war crimes, but also crimes of genocide against its Serb residents. What is characteristic for Herzegovina is that there were mass killings of Serbs in places where they were a relative or absolute minority, which means that the crimes were most often committed by residents of the same or surrounding communities of different ethnicity and religion, where the majority of the crimes were committed in the early days of the war, i.e. before any organised resistance movement, which is a testament to the character of that state and the ideology it was based on. Keywords: crimes of genocide, war victims, civilian victims, suffering of children and the elderly.\n\nThe mass atrocities of the executive, judicial, army and police institutions and troops of the Independent State of Croatia,1 as well as Ustasha organisations and party troops, from the first day of this establishment, were aimed\n\n1\n\nThe term “so-called NDH” is not used, since it in fact relativises the responsibility of the Croatian state, because the NDH had all the characteristics of a state: territory, people, military and police force.\n\n27\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nprimarily at the Serb ethnic space, in efforts to discontinue and disperse the Serbian ethnic fibre by eliminating its physical manifestation.

Out of that, 30.67% were Orthodox Christians (33.21% in 1931), 45.80% were Catholic (42.94% in 1931), 23.43% were Muslims (23.08% in 1931) and 0.10% were of other religions (0.27% in 1931). According to demographic estimates, the total number of residents in B&H would have increased by about 22% between 1931 and 1941.

Unfortunately the census of war victims was not carried out at the same time. When comparing the 1948 Census to the projections for the number of residents of a certain area we see how many residents the area has lost: real or direct losses from the war (soldiers and civilians killed during the war, succumbing during and immediately after the war to gunshot wounds, illnesses and other difficult conditions resulting from the war), decreased birth rate immediately prior to the war, during and after the war, and the negative migration balance caused by emigration.9 Herzegovina population according to 1931 and 1948 Censuses and population estimate for 1941, divided by religion/ethnicity10 Religion/ethnicity 1931 Census ac‐ Estimated popu‐ 1948 Census ac‐ cording to religion lation in 1941 cording to ethnicity Total 320.343 384.412 330.864 Orthodox Christian / Serbs 98.253 117.604 94.590 Roman Catholic / Croats 146.718 176.061 163.750 Muslim / unaffiliated Muslims 75.068 90.082 71.102 Others 304 365 1.422\n\n45.8\n\n50\n\n1931 Census according to religion – percentage of total population\n\n40\n\n30.67 30\n\n23.43\n\n20 10\n\n0.1 0\n\nОrtodox\n\nRoman Catholic\n\n9\n\nMuslim\n\nOthers\n\nDušan Vrućinić, Demografski gubici Srbije prouzrokovani ratovima u XX veku, Beograd, 2007, pp. 9-10.

According to the 1931 Census, the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina was 2,323,555, of whom 1,028,139 were Orthodox Christians (44.25%), 547,949 were Roman Catholics (23.58%), 718,079 were Muslims (30.91%) and 29,390 were of other religions (1.26%). Demographers calculated that between 1931 and 1941 the total population of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased by around 22% (2,834,737),11 while it should be noted that the population growth rate varies for different religious/ethnic groups.12 1931 Census according to religion ‐ percentage of total population\n\n24% Ortodox 31%\n\nRoma Catholics\n\n44% 1%\n\nMuslims Others\n\n11 Vladimir Žerjavić, Gubici stanovništva Jugoslavije u drugom svjetskom ratu, Zagreb 1989, p.12, calculated that the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1931 (census was carried out across the banovinas, according to religion and mother tongue) was 2,321,502, and that by 1941 it would have been 2,850,396 (p. 12), i.e. 2,825,000 (p. 18). Bogoljub Kočović, Žrtve drugog svetskog rata u Jugoslaviji, London 1985, states on page 69 that the population in 1941 would be 2,814,000 people. CD-Popis 1991 calculates that in 1921 Bosnia and Herzegovina would have had 1,890,440 residents, and 2,323,555 in 1931. See also: Definitivni rezultati popisa 1931 i Prethodni rezultati popisa 1921). 12 Kočović, n. d., p.69, states that Serbs had the highest growth rate between 1931 and 1941, followed by Muslims and then Croats, while in later periods Muslims claim the highest increment.\n\n32\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nThe actual losses in the Second World War in the area of Yugoslavia were determined in censuses in 1946,13 195014 and 1964,15 while each census, as well as the material of the Reparation Commission on Human and Material Losses,16 has failed to provide a definitive answer on the actual number of casualties in the Second World War in the area of Yugoslavia, and subsequently the NDH..\n\n13\n\nThe Statistics Division of the State Commission came up with 505,182 fatalities in the war other than members of armed forces.

They state: \"according to available information (sic!) in 1950 the SUBNOR of Yugoslavia carried out a census of all fighters who were killed and of victims of fascism, the results of which are unknown to this day\".

There are no records for Jews and the Roma people in the observed area in the 1931 Census, nor consequently in the 1941 estimated numbers. In proportion, the Jewish ethnic/religious population had the largest losses in Bosnia and Herzegovina: compared to the 1931 Census the recorded casualties are 78.21%, and if we applied the same criteria to the estimated numbers the losses would be 64.12%. In victim analysis according to ethnicity, it is important to point out the ratio of percentage in the total population to the percentage among the victims. If we compare losses among ethnicities, the ratio of Croatian to Serb victims is 1:4.9 (while the same ratio is 1:0.67 in total population); the ratio of Muslims to Serbs is 1:3.5 (1:1.31 in total population); and the ratio of Croats and Muslims together to Serbs is 1:2.05 (1:0.44 in total population).\n\nVictims of the 1941-1945 War in the area of Herzegovina, by year of death War victims in the area of Herzegovina, according to year of death Total→↓ Born in ↓ 1941 No. 17638 6617 ∑ Hercegovina % → 100 37,52 1 Bileća 1574 687 2 Čapljina 2189 1542 3 Čitluk 89 12 4 Gacko 2069 573 5 Grude 117 7 6 Jablanica 355 11 7 Konjic 1000 189 8 Lištica 226 22 9 Ljubinje 574 320 10 Ljubuški 427 74 11 Mostar 2719 1051 12 Nevesinje 1424 408 13 Posušje 134 5 14 Prozor 844 16 15 Stolac 1686 912 16 Trebinje 2211 788\n\n42\n\n1942 3257 8,47 195 110 24 563 7 146 123 43 68 48 334 306 39 611 253 387\n\nYear 1943 3168 17,96 282 156 16 607 34 106 327 24 91 57 422 307 42 127 223 347\n\n1944 2633 14,92 273 234 11 203 32 39 159 52 57 116 517 213 23 64 185 455\n\n1945 1963 11,13 137 147 26 123 37 53 202 85 38 132 395 190 25 26 113 234\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nWar victims in the area of Herzegovina, according to year of death 17.96% 18.47% 14.92%\n\n1941 1942\n\n11.13%\n\n37.52%\n\n1943 1944 1945\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina‐born victims of the 1941‐1945 war, by year of death Year Total 1941. 1942. 1943. 1944. 212384 52706 (24,82) 77470 (36,48) 40380 (19,01) 28250 (13,30)\n\n1945. 13574 (6,39)\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina‐born victims of the 1941‐1945 war, by year of death\n\n36.48% 19.01% 24.82%\n\n1941 1942 1943\n\n6.39%\n\n1944\n\n13.30%\n\n1945\n\n43\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\n37.52\n\n40\n\n36.48\n\nComparison of data on victims of the 1941‐1945 war for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the observed area, by year of death\n\n35 30 25\n\n24.82\n\n18.47\n\n20\n\n19.01 17.96 13.3\n\n15\n\n14.92\n\n10\n\n11.13 6.39\n\n5 0\n\n1941\n\n1942\n\n1943\n\nB&H\n\n1944\n\n1945\n\nObserver area\n\nAccording to the year of death, the largest number of victims were killed in 1941 (37.52%), while the numbers are similar for 1942 (18.47%) and 1943 (17.96%), as for 1944 (14,92%) and 1945 (11.13%). Relative to the total number of war victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to year of death, this area is specific for having a significantly larger percentage of casualties in the first year of the war – 37.52% victims in 16% of the duration of the war, i.e. in less than eight months of the war the monthly average was more than double of the number of victims in the remaining 84% of the duration of the war. Although most of the civilian victims (victims of direct violence) during the war in the area of the NDH can be deemed as victims of the genocidal policies of the NDH, it especially goes for victims from the first year of the war, when there was no armed resistance provoked by mass crimes, which was the formal motive. Direct mass crimes were formally justified as retribution and cleansing, i.e. pacification of the territory. Of course, the composition of the civilian victims (gender or age-wise), as well as the time of execution clearly indicate real intentions, i.e. the implementation of genocidal policies.\n\n44\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nVictims of the 1941-1945 war in the area of Herzegovina, by manner of death Other cate‐ gories25\n\nOther\n\nUnknown\n\n17638 100 1574 2189 89 2069 117 355 1000 226 574 427 2719 1424 134 844 1686 2211\n\nDirect vio‐ lence (at home)24\n\n∑ Hercegov. % → Bileća Čapljina Čitluk Gacko Grude Jablanica Konjic Lištica Ljubinje Ljubuški Mostar Nevesinje Posušje Prozor Stolac Trebinje\n\nState insi‐ tutions23\n\nTotal →↓\n\nPLW\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nBorn in ↓\n\nFRYA\n\nNo.\n\nWar victims in the area of Herzegovina according to manner of death\n\n214 1,21 22 6 5 21 3 3 9 13 12 11 32 31 5 4 9 28\n\n3896 22,0926 490 222 32 396 46 117 294 33 106 146 540 425 40 111 295 603\n\n2151 12,20 113 179 13 145 5 15 85 10 107 65 763 157 3 27 196 268\n\n8943 50,70 677 1657 28 1136 26 176 431 79 312 115 1071 574 57 628 1000 976\n\n1124 6,37 64 64 9 171 26 20 138 55 18 60 185 109 15 43 37 110\n\n1171 6,64 200 51 ‐ 191 11 24 37 28 17 18 100 109 12 29 137 207\n\n139 0,79 8 10 2 9 ‐ ‐ 6 8 2 12 28 19 2 2 12 19\n\nMilitary and civilian victims, according to category Total\n\nMilitary victims\n\nCivilian victims\n\nState in‐ stitutions\n\nDirect vi‐ olence\n\nOther cate‐ gories\n\nOther and un‐ known\n\n17638 100,00% % od ∑ CV\n\n4110 23,30\n\n13528 76,70 100,00\n\n2151 12,20 15,90\n\n8943 50,70 66,11\n\n1124 6,37 8,31\n\n1310 7,43 9,68\n\n23\n\nCamps, prisons, deportation, forced labour, shelters for children Direct violence, mass slaughter, at home, on the run, thrown in a pit, thrown in a well, thrown in a river, German offensive, in a church. 25 As a civilian, in combat, from bombings, in refuge, in the People's Liberation War (PLW) 26 Military victims 4,110 or 23.30%, civilian victims 13,528 or 76.70% 24\n\n45\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina‐born victims of the 1941‐1945 War, by category Total\n\nMilitary victims27\n\n∑ Civilian victims\n\nState insti‐ tutions28\n\nDirect vio‐ lence29\n\nOther cate‐ gories30\n\nOther and unknown31\n\n212384 100,00%\n\n39501 18,60\n\n172883 81,40 100,00\n\n53664 25,27 31,04\n\n89626 42,20 51,84\n\n10042 4,73 5,81\n\n19551 9,20 11,31\n\n% od ∑ CV\n\nWar victims in the area of Herzegovina according to manner of death 6.37% 7.43%\n\n1.21% 22.09%\n\n50.70%\n\nFRYА PLW State Inst.\n\n12.20%\n\nDir.

The data for the observed area correspond with the data for the general area of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The largest number and percentage relative to unknown culprits is in the category of “Croatian troops” (4,683, i.e. 26.55%),42 Germans are listed as responsible for 526 victims or 42\n\nBoth in the “Victims of the 1941-1945 War” database and in relevant literature the culprits are mainly listed to be the “Ustashas”, as if other formations took no part in the crimes, when the crimes were committed by members of all armed forces of the Croatian state. When identifying guilty parties for crimes it is usual to say “German”, “Italian”, “Bulgarian”, “Hungarian” and others’ crimes (aggressor forces are implied); however, they are almost never listed as “Croatian”, not implying the Croatian people but the Croatian state and its armed forces, whether legitimate or paramilitary. This is also the result of the “policy of brotherhood and unity”, to keep anyone from thinking that by any chance responsibility lies in a wider body than the Ustasha party organisation and their armed forces. If anybody did mention the responsibility of the Croatian state in Croatian historiographical opinion journalism, it is so labelled to place the “genocidal blame” onto the entire Croatian people, which is false of course, because this sort of categorisation is then done by those who comment that any emphasis on the responsibility of the Croatian state is an expression of the outspoken responsibility of the Croatian people.\n\n51\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\n2.98%, Chetniks (not only members of the JVUO [Yugoslav Homeland Army, troops commanded by Serbian General Draža Mihailović 1942-1944, t/n] but also local groups beyond the scope of the JVUO chain of command) for 796 or 4.51%, while the rest of the identified culprits are responsible for 350 victims or 1.99% (221 of which belong to Italians). The expression “Croatian troops” is used purposefully because it both fits into the “Croatian language,” and also encompasses all military and paramilitary formations, police and parapolice forces – not only the “Ustashas” as a political organisation with their own armed forces, whose ideology was the basis of the newly-founded government and state organisation, but the responsibility of the Croatian sate is emphasised as well.43\n\n70\n\nComparison of data on victims of the 1941‐1945 war for B&H and the observed area, by perpetrators\n\n63.97 56.88\n\n60 50 40 30\n\n34.19 26.55\n\n20\n\n5.41\n\n10\n\n2.98\n\n3.02 4.51\n\nGERMANS\n\nCHETNIKS\n\n0.49 1.99\n\n0\n\nCROATIAN TROOPS\n\nB&H\n\nOTHERS\n\nUNKNOWN\n\nObserver area\n\n43\n\nCrimes, especially from the first year of the war, if mentioned at all, were, in order to conceal the true agitators and organisers of the massacre, imputed to the so-called “rogue Ustashas” – local unorganised formations of Croatian and Muslim militias that were beyond state control.

The municipalities analysed are: Bileća, Čapljina, Čitluk, Gacko, Grude, Jablanica, Konjic, Lištica, Ljubinje, Ljubuški, Mostar, Nevesinje, Posušje, Prozor, Stolac, and Trebinje. According to the 1931 Census, the population of the observed area was 320,343 people, 30.67% of which were Orthodox Christians, 45.80% were Roman Catholic, 23.43% were Muslims and 0.10% was of other religions. According to demographic calculations in 1941, the population of the observed area would be 384,412, which amounts to 6.12% of the population of the NDH. In this area a total of 17,638 fatalities were recorded, which is 8.30% of the total recorded number of victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e. 3.87% of victims recorded in the NDH, and 4.59% (7.49% in Bosnia and Herzegovina) of the estimated population of the observed area in 1941. The percentage of victims born in the area of Herzegovina in relation to the estimated population is lower than the average for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Analysis of victims in Herzegovina according to the various categories yields the following results: - by gender: 77.98% of the victims were male and 22.02% were female (27.98% in Bosnia and Herzegovina); when only looking at children, 46.09% were female, and 53.91% were male; - by ethnicity: 66.28% of the victims were Serbs (who were 30.67% of the population), 13.44% were Croats (45.80% of the population), 18.89% were Muslims (23.43% of the population); in relation to the estimated number of residents in 1941 the recorded victims account for 9.92% among the Serbs (12.57% for Bosnia and Herzegovina), 1.35% for Croats (1.66% for Bosnia and Herzegovina) and 3.70% for Muslims (3.64% for Bosnia and Herzegovina), or if we are to look at the Croatian and Muslim population together, since they together constituted the “Croatian political people” in the NDH, i.e. were regarded as a single nation, then the recorded victims account for 2.14% of the estimated population (2.57% for Bosnia and Herzegovina);\n\n68\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nfor children, 65.46% were Serb children, 8.01 were Croatian children and 25.01% Muslim children; - relative to the total number of war victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina according to year of death, this area is specific for having a significantly larger percentage of casualties in the first year of the war – 37.52% victims in 16% of the duration of the war, while the average for certain units of time was more than double of the number of victims in the remaining period of the war; nearly half of the lives of children (42.24%) perished in 1941; - by perpetrators, Croatian troops take up 26.65%, Germans 2.98%, Chetniks 4.51%, Italians 1.25%, other known 0.74% and unknown 63.97%.; for children victims the perpetrators were listed as Croatian troops for 62.68% of the victims, Germans for 3.09%, Chetniks for 19.37%, Italians for 2.51%, other known 1.39% and unknown 10.96%; - by category: military victims 23.30%, civilian victims 76.70%; (state institutions: camps, prisons, deportation and forced labour 12.20%, from direct violence 50.70%, other causes 6.37%, other and unknown 7.43%); the area of Herzegovina is characterised by a smaller share of the total category of “state institutions” in the percentage of total victims and civilian victims relative to the average for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also a significantly higher percentage of victims of direct violence; - by cause of death: 68.19% executed, 21.41% killed in action, 2.88% died and 1.52% missing; - by occupation, relative to the average in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the percentages in the observed area is larger in the categories of agricultural workers, industrial workers, craftsmen, tradesmen and labourers, officials and experts, and smaller in categories of dependants, unemployed people and unknown; categories of agricultural workers and dependants account for almost 2/3 of all victims; Analysis of the suffering of children born in Herzegovina, according to the extent to which the victims of the war have been recorded in the aforementioned revision of the Census, shows that out of 17,638 casualties there were 2,235 (12.67%) children up to 14 years of age, and out of 13,228 civilian victims children make up 16.90%. Next to children, executions of the elderly during a war, i.e. persons who are mostly not able to work or fight, as a rule represents a crime of genocide or a war crime. In the observed area the number of war victims over 60 years of age is 1,612, accounting for 9.14% of total victims. The highest rate of death 69\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nwas in 1941 – 48.32%, which is significantly higher than in total victims (35.53%). Although statistical methods in historiography may seem dehumanised, one should bear in mind that each number represents one person, with all its innermost feelings, troubles and joys of life, individual pasts and plans for the future. And when that person is a child, then those plans for the future are as immeasurable as the grief of their families, as well as of the nation.\n\nReferences Antonić, Zdravko, Dokumenta o genocidu nad Srbima u Bosni i Hercegovini od aprila do avgusta 1941, Banja Luka – Srpsko Sarajevo, 2001.

There were few Catholics, so the Roman Catholic “Church” had been trying for centuries to convert the Serbs in some way, i.e. to catholicise them and expand its influence. The prevailing idea was that if Serbs were to accept Catholicism, they would eventually become Croats, loyal to Rome. These politics of the Roman Catholic “Church” was particularly prominent during the Austro-Hungarian occupation and subsequent annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and most so during the World War I. Promptly after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, the Roman Catholic “Church” and its bishops called upon the Muslims and Croats to retaliate against Orthodox Serbs, to kill, torture, rob and blame them for all sorts of affairs. There were crimes against Serbs in all villages and towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A prominent role in spreading hatred towards Orthodox Serbs was that of the monks in Catholic monasteries, friars and Jesuits, as well as various Catholic activists. Roman Catholic schools, seminaries and organisations turned into hubs of ethnic hatred towards Serbs. It would be too large a digression to\n\n75\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nname all these monasteries, all the friars and Jesuits, as well as Roman Catholic bishops, who had committed and enticed others to commit crimes against Serbs. Unfortunately, in between the two world wars, first within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and then within Yugoslavia, these crimes of Roman Catholics, i.e. Croats, were not spoken of or written about, because the state policy was to reconcile the criminals and their victims, who were Orthodox Serbs. The authorities feared that the truth of the suffering of Serbs by Roman Catholic Croats and Muslims could offend one of the three tribes of the same people, as Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were then labelled. Although Croatia and Slovenia lost the war, as integral parts of the Austro-Hungarian state, and Serbia was on the winning side, and although it was a wellknown fact that Croats and Slovenes as soldiers in the ranks of the AustroHungarian army and occupying forces had committed numerous crimes in Serbia, these facts were suppressed, they weren’t spoken of or written about, because the Croats and Muslims had joined forces with Serbia and become citizens of the same kingdom. At the same time, the Roman Catholic “Church” continued to spread hatred against Orthodox Serbs and to indoctrinate generations of future criminals and slayers of Serbs, who would become prominent during WWII and the Independent State of Croatia, which included Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Roman Catholic “Church” continued to pave the way and train recruits for a repeat of the slaughter, pillage, torture, rape and extermination primarily of Serbs, as well as other non-Catholics, Jews and the Roma people. Although the Roman Catholic “Church” in Herzegovina was detached from the authority of Bosnian archbishops since as early as Pope Pius IX, i.e. since 1846, its anti-Serbian politics had not changed. And in Herzegovina, the Franciscans were also very prominent in spreading religious friction and antagonism towards Orthodox Serbs and Jews. This is best evidenced in articles published in Catholic press of the time. Franciscans, Jesuits and Catholic activists used any occasion to belittle the Orthodox Church and what it stood for, constantly insulted Orthodox priests and bishops and used any occasion to intensify all sorts of feuds. The Franciscans from the Široki Brijeg Monastery near Mostar and their activists, teachers from the Catholic Gymnasium, were the most persistent in that dissemination of hatred against Serbs. They used any means available to further religious and ethnic intolerance. At the same time, Orthodox Serbs never harboured or displayed such intolerance or hatred towards Catholic Croats nor Muslims. To Serbs they were brothers that followed a “different law.” Many even felt sympathy towards Roman Catholics and Franciscans. Some Croats were aware of the hostile activities of the Franciscans and Catholic priests in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. One of them was 76\n\nNDH ATROCITIES AGAINST THE SERBS, JEWS AND ROMA IN HERZEGOVINA 1941-1945\n\nStjepan Radić, president of the Croatian Peasant Party, who served as Minister in the Government at the time. One time in 1926 he said: “I used to greatly value the cultural and ethnic work of the Franciscans of Bosnia and Herzegovina, only to be disappointed in the end and realise that they were dishonest liars. All their ethnic and cultural work is nothing else but deception and misdirection of the people to make it easier for them to exploit the people. They used and still use the church, pulpit and confessionals only for their lowly and selfish purposes.” When WWII broke out and Serbs were occupied by Germans, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Italians, Albanians and Croats, and when the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, the anti-Serbian rampage of the Roman Catholics in Herzegovina boomed. The Roman Catholic “Church” in Herzegovina was headed by an elderly bishop, Franciscan Alojzije Mišić, born in Velika Gradiška. For 30 years he had lead the Roman Catholic “Church” in Herzegovina before he died in 1942. As the bishop he was in the forefront of the Roman Catholic clergy in hatred against the Orthodox Serbs. To him, Croatia’s Poglavnik [head of state, now synonymous with Pavelić, t/n] Ante Pavelić “was a model Catholic Christian.” In his newsletter no. 670, published in Mostar, he glorified the Ustashas and the newly-established government in Zagreb, and ordained that all Herzegovina’s Roman Catholic churches were to hold Mass to honour the newly established Independent State of Croatia. After he died, Franciscan bishop Alojzije Mišić was replaced by Jesuit Petar Čule, who was recommended for the position by war criminals and Archbishops Ivan Šarić and Alojzije Stepinac. Pope Pius XII, known collaborator to German Nazis and Hitler, was among the first to support the dissolution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the occupation of Serbia and creation of the Independent State of Croatia as a Civitas Dei or a Catholic State and he appointed Petar Čule, a known Ustasha as the bishop of Herzegovina. Regularly travelling across Herzegovina, bishop Čule disseminated the Ustasha propaganda, especially in Catholic centres of Ljubuški, Široki Brijeg, Čapljina and other places. For his activities against Serbs, Jews and Roma people, Petar Čule was dignified by the Poglavnik of the Croatian state, Ante Pavelić, who stated that Čule was commended for spreading the Ustasha ideology, and was awarded the Order of Merit, Grand Cross medal. From the very beginning of the war, the Roman Catholic “Church” in Herzegovina, as well as in all other parts of the Independent State of Croatia, performed forced conversion of Orthodox Serb population to Catholicism, although there were very few Catholic Croats in Herzegovina. According to Zdravko Antonić, all Catholic priests in Herzegovina performed forced conversion of Serbs to Catholicism. A special prominence in these activities belonged to Don Ilija Tomas, friar Tugomir 77\n\nPROCEEDINGS – Rоund Table, Trebinje, September 28th, 2013\n\nSoldo, friar Viselko from Čapljina, Don Ante Bakula and many others. Catholic priests ordered the newly baptised Serbs to attend holy mass regularly, which many Serbs tried to escape under various excuses. The Orthodox Serbs were forced to convert to Catholicism hoping to save their necks and avoid death. Soon it turned out that conversion to Catholicism didn’t mean much, as they were slaughtered by the Croats in 1941. Armed Roman Catholic priests and other Croats and Ustashas demolished Orthodox churches, seized and destroyed registers of births, marriages and deaths, pillaged church treasures and were particularly cruel towards Orthodox clergy. They terrorised innocent and helpless Serbs, tortured, raped, pillaged and murdered all Serbs, sparing not even small children, women, the sick, or anyone else they got hold of. Special notoriety in committing crimes in Mostar went to Leo Petrović, secretary of the Catholic bishop of Mostar, who had a PhD. He personally led campaigns of slaughter, torture and rape in various places in Herzegovina. He followed everywhere his chief, bishop Petar Čule, who made a public statement that he was firmly supporting the Ustasha regim"
