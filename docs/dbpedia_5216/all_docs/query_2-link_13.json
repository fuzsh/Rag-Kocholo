        "text": "A critical review of the literature on harvestmen from Bosnia and Herzegovina was performed, and data from major collections of harvestmen in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been listed to provide an overview of recent knowledge on the topic. Where needed, comments and/or corrections have been added to avoid further confusion. At the moment, 54 valid species and two subspecies have been identified of 59 nominal species in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Six nominal species must be confirmed with respect to taxonomical status and validity. Systematic taxonomical revisions are strongly required in the travuniid genera and in Paranemastoma. Six further species may be present in the country, and the discovery of new species cannot be excluded. According to present knowledge , the richness of the harvestman fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina is comparable to that in the surrounding countries. U svrhu dobivanja trenutnog stanja poznavanja teme rada, donosi se kriti~ki pregled literature o koscima Bosne i Hercegovine te podaci iz glavnih zbirki kosaca u Bosni i Hercegovini. Da bi se izbjegle eventualne daljnje gre{ke dodani su i komentari i/ili ispravci. U Bosni i Hercegovini sa sigurno{}u su utvr|ene 54vàe}e vrste i jedna podvrsta od 59 nominalnih vrsta. Za {est no-minalnih vrsta potrebne su taksonomske revizije, {to je pogotovonùno u travuniidnim rodovima te u rodu Paranemastoma. Potencijalno tùivi jo{ {est vrsta, a ne treba isklju~iti ni otkrivanje novih. Prema sada{njim spoznajama bogatstvo faune kosaca Bosne i Hercegovinemòe se usporediti s faunama kosaca susjednih zemalja.\n\nThe current knowledge on the Odonata fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina is summarized based on museum and private collections, literature and new unpublished data of the authors. In all, 63 spp. are known, including first reports of Platycnemis pennipes nitidula, Anax parthenope, Gomphus flavipes, G. schneiderii, Cordulegaster heros and Selysiothemis nigra for the country. Caliaeschna microstigma is rediscovered after more than 100 yr. The first reliable data on the occurrence of Somatochlora metallica is reported. More than 1,400 new records were collected and a national odonatol. database has been created. Annotations to the new spp. and to some other faunistically interesting species are given. Possible future additions to the fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina are discussed.\n\nAuthors present a summary of hitherto published as well as non-published data about occurrence of harvestmen in the Tatra Mts., proposing to fi ll information gaps about the species diversity of Opiliones in the Slovak part of the Tatra Mts. Total 18 harvestmen species were identifi ed in the Tatra Mts. representing 54.5 % of the species richness of the Slovak opiliofauna (S = 33). The species Paranemastoma kochi, Ischyropsalis manicata, Platybunus pallidus, Gyas titanus have been documented as a Carpathians elements and the harvestmen typical for undisturbed site conditions of climax mountain spruce stands. On the other hand, the species Rilaena triangularis, Mitopus morio, Leiobunum aff. rupestre, Phalangium opilio or Opilio parietinus are typical for ecotonal sun-heated habitats, forest meadows, clear cuts, borders of agricultural land and even for human settlements. In the future, more harvestmen species should be anticipated in the Tatra Mts., for example Siro carpaticus, Astro...\n\nMITOV P.: Contribution to the knowledge of the harvestmen (Arachnida: Opiliones) of Albania. In GAJDOŠ P., PEKÁR S. (eds): Proceedings of the 18th European Colloquium of Arachnology, Stará Lesná, 1999. Ekológia (Bratislava), Vol. 19, Supplement 3/2000, p. 159-169. The opilionid fauna of Albania is still poorly known. In the entire literature on this topic from the territory of this country are recorded 31 species, some of which have vague taxonomical status or need confirmation. As a result of examination of material from the collections of the author and of the National Museum of Natural History in Sofia, 20 species were established altogether. Ten of these (Paranemastoma titaniacum (ROEWER), Mitostoma cancellatum (ROEWER), Trogulus ne-paeformis (SCOPOLI), Opilio saxatilis C. L. KOCH, Opilio transversalis ROEWER, Metaplatybunus carneluttii HADŽI, Metaplatybunus strigosus (L. KOCH), Rilaena balcanica ŠILHAVÝ, Lacinius dentiger (C. L. KOCH), Amilenus aurantiacus (SIMON)) are new to t...\n\nThe work summarizes the data on the harvestmen-fauna of the Eastern Rhodopes Mountains, a relatively poorly known territory of Bulgaria. The faunistic list includes 24 species altogether (from 18 genera and 5 families), or roughly 45% of the opilionid species recorded so far from Bulgaria. Eleven species are new to the fauna of the Eastern Rhodopes and new chorological data are added for six species and subspecies. A comparison between the faunas of the Eastern and the Western Rhodopes is presented, and a zoogeographical characterization of the opilionid fauna of the latter region is furnished. Some comments on endemism, expected number of species, and the conservation status of the studied animal group in the investigated area are provided.\n\nThis paper deals with faunistical data and taxonomic notes on Odonata in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A database containing all available published, previously unpublished, and new data was made in order to create a review of the current knowledge of the country’s Odonata fauna and point out the priorities in future investigations. 57 Odonata species are listed as resident species in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Of that number, exact data on the occurrence of 6 species (Lestes parvidens, L. macrostigma, Erythromma viridulum, Aeshna grandis, Lindenia tetraphylla and Somatochlora flavomaculata) are presented and discussed here for the first time."
