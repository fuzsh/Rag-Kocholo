        "text": "History of Slovenian archaeology reveals a pattern of sharp ruptures (both in infrastructure and in concept) concomitant with major political changes. However, in order to understand the development of archaeological discipline a set of factors and contingencies operating on a smaller scale should also be taken into consideration. The aim of this paper is not to present the history of the archaeological discipline in Slovenia ordered according to the historical and chronological developments only, but rather to focus on some crucial aspects and contingencies, which considerably conditioned its course in the last 150 years.\n\nThis study attempted to profile the archaeological community of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in line with the aims and objectives of the 'Discovering the Archaeologists of Europe' (DISCO) project undertaken in several EU states between 2006 and 2008. The study culminated in a report, available on the DISCO project's website, at www.discovering-archaeologists.eu/bosniaherzegovina.html. In line with the aspirations of the twelve national reports of the original 'Discovering the Archaeologists of Europe' project, the primary objectives of this investigation were to investigate the archaeological labour market in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and profile the workers in terms of age, gender, education level and other demographic indicators, and to assess the workforce as a whole. Furthermore, the report attempted to identify any deficiencies in the support and remunerations provided to them by their employers. Also, the report aimed to recognize problems posed to the institutions themselves, whether from a perspective of funding and equipment, or identifiable weaknesses in the available workforce. The report also presented the views of Bosnia-Herzegovina's archaeological community with regard to the internationalization of archaeology and the freedom of labour movement between Bosnia-Herzegovina and other states. It also attempted to reveal the extent to which opinions on ethnicity, religion and language pervade the labour market, a notable potential problem facing this country's attitudes toward cultural heritage. This article outlines the methodologies employed in the creation of the report, and also outlines some of the difficulties and problems encountered during research."
