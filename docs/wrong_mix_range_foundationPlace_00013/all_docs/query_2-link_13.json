        "text": "Part of WRT’s sustainable strategy was to reduce water consumption for irrigation by 58% from a baseline condition and to position the project for further water use reductions once native areas are fully established. This was accomplished by designing significant portions of the campus’ landscape as a native, high desert plant palette. More ornamental planting, requiring higher levels of irrigation was limited to high-use, high-visibility zones near the campus’ major social spaces and recreational areas. This approach allowed vast areas of the campus perimeter, parking zones and freeway frontage to be landscaped with a simple native palette of grasses and wildflowers on the ground plane and native tree groupings along drainage-ways. A more ornamental – but still drought-tolerant – grass mix was used for sculptural mounds running along key public spaces and through parking areas."
