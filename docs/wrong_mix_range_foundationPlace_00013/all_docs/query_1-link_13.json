        "text": "The Creative Residents program gives artists early in their career access to a museum’s resources, including staff expertise, mentorship, and a platform to display their work. During a 12-to-18-month period, Creative Residents hone their skills, expand their networks, and strengthen their practice.\n\nThroughout their Residency, Creative Residents partner with their local community to produce socially engaged artwork. For greater detail on opportunities each museum offers Residents to support its creative programming, visit its site below.\n\nAdobe x Museums aims to engage 10 million students globally online and in person with creative programming and resources that will enable them to bring their creativity to the world. To learn more about these museums’ creative programming for the public, visit their sites below."
