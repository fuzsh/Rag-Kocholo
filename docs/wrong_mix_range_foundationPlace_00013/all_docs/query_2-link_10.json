        "text": "Just north of Lehi, Utah, busy Interstate 15 winds like a river past a new campus for the technology giant Adobe. Situated between the highway and the steep Wasatch Mountains, with typical suburban sprawl and billboards just across the highway, the 38-acre site is in motorists' full view. With its strong form and contemporary material palette, this first phase of the campus, by the San Francisco–based design firms WRNS Studio (the core-and-shell architect) and Rapt Studio (which designed the interiors), is a bold and visible symbol for the software company. Silicon Valley–based Adobe chose Lehi for its newest facility because of its proximity to outdoor recreation and to numerous other technology companies. While employees can enjoy the mountains and nearby Utah Lake, Salt Lake City is just a 25-minute drive north on I-15.\n\nDespite its banality, the highway is “part of the topology of the place,” says Bryan Shiles, a principal at WRNS. It is “framed and captured as part of a larger painterly notion of landscape.” This is clear in the parti sketch for the Adobe Utah Campus, which includes three long lines drawn on the site so as to embrace the valley and mimic the adjacent Wasatch Range. Those lines developed into three four-story bar-shaped buildings, each bent slightly to follow the shifting topography and fit into the rough terrain. The first completed phase of the campus comprises a 200,000-square-foot office block and a connected 80,000-square-foot amenities building. The structures hug the ground in places and in others cantilever over it, with chamfered vertical metal fins rhythmically punctuating the steel-and-glass shell above the exposed concrete base.\n\nThe visual prominence of the highway was not the only challenge: a four-lane road also bisects the long, thin site. So the architects designed these first structures to be anchored firmly on the hillside and span the road as a graceful concrete bridge. Driving under the building on the approach makes for a dramatic introduction to the campus.\n\nTextured poured-in-place concrete at the building's base links the refined steel-and-glass facades above with the rugged Utah landscape. Around the buildings, board-formed-concrete retaining walls demarcate planted areas and places to sit, while also defining paths to both the main entrance and the north employees' entry. One such textured wall extends into the double-height north lobby, marking the stair leading up to the main floor. There, a spacious corridor offers views to the eastern mountains and connects the north and central lobbies, as well as private meeting spaces and a well-appointed customer-briefing center, with its conference and presentation areas.\n\nThe upper floors similarly maximize views, which alternate from floor to floor between the mountains to the east and the valley to the west. Here and there, conference rooms or collaboration spaces push out from the core into the open-plan office spaces. The result is a sense of privacy in the open offices—remarkable in a building designed to house 1,000 workers with few individual offices. Rapt Studio design principal David Galullo explains, “We developed the idea of bringing neighborhoods to the work spaces, so there was some visual break to what the client called the 'sea of same.' ”\n\nAn atrium connects the office block with the amenities building, which includes a full gym and locker rooms. It is where employees park their bikes after a lunchtime ride, blow off steam with a game of Ping-Pong or billiards, or take a break in the gaming “dungeon” or the piano room. Just outside, to the south, a soccer field and a basketball court beckon, while an enclosed full-size basketball court juts over the north end of the sloping site with long views out across the highway.\n\nWhile the recreation spaces are important elements of the work environment, the heart of the campus is the atrium caf' facing the “campus green.” Employees share meals and work individually or in small groups at tables and long wood counters. Distinguished by its faceted wood slat ceiling, the space accommodates the entire workforce when management calls an all-hands meeting.\n\nStraightforward and sophisticated in both its architecture and its ability to build community, this first phase of the Adobe Utah Campus is an eye-catching addition to the landscape along Interstate 15. It was important to Adobe that “the story of the building starts at the freeway and the design is meaningful for the inhabitants,” says Galullo. Shiles adds, “Adobe really wanted to say 'we're here' with drama and a sense of place.”\n\nSize: 280,000 square feet\n\nCost: $74 million\n\nCompletion date: November 2012"
