        "text": "AEM WCM Core Components\n\nSet of standardized Web Content Management (WCM) components for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to speed up development time and reduce maintenance cost of your websites.\n\nContributions are welcome, read our contributing guide for more information.\n\nIdeas and questions are discussed on our public mailing list; you can also subscribe via email.\n\nComponent Library: A collection of examples to view the components in their various configurations.\n\nComponent Documentation: For developers and authors, with details about each component.\n\nGet Started:\n\nWKND Tutorial: A two-day tutorial for building a new site.\n\nSummit Tutorial: A two-hour tutorial for building a new site (from a Lab at US Summit 2019).\n\nGems Webinar: A guided tour of the Core Components (recorded on Dec 2018).\n\nProduction-Ready: 29 robust components that are well tested, widely used, and that perform well.\n\nCloud-Ready: Whether on AEM as a Cloud Service, on Adobe Managed Services, or on-premise, they just work.\n\nVersatile: The components represent generic concepts with which the authors can assemble nearly any layout.\n\nConfigurable: Template-level content policies define which features the page authors are allowed to use or not.\n\nTrackable: The Adobe Client Data Layer and Google Data Layer integrations support the tracking of all aspects of the visitor experience.\n\nAccessible: They comply WCAG 2.1 standard, provide ARIA labels, and support keyboard navigation.\n\nSEO-Friendly: The HTML output is semantic and provides schema.org microdata annotations.\n\nWebApp-Ready: The streamlined JSON output allows client-side rendering, still with a possibility of in-context editing.\n\nDesign Kit: A UI kit for Adobe XD allows designers to create wireframes that they can then style as needed.\n\nThemeable: The components implement the Style System, and the markup follows BEM CSS conventions.\n\nCustomizable: Several patterns allow easy customization, from adjusting the HTML to advanced functionality reuse.\n\nVersioned: The versioning policy ensures we won't break your site when improving things that might impact you.\n\nOpen Sourced: If something is not as it should, contribute your improvements!\n\nTemplate Components\n\nPage\n\nNavigation\n\nLanguage Navigation\n\nBreadcrumb\n\nQuick Search\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPage Authoring Components\n\nTitle\n\nText\n\nImage\n\nButton\n\nTeaser\n\nList\n\nDownload\n\nPDF Viewer\n\nEmbed\n\nSharing\n\nProgress Bar\n\nSeparator\n\nExperience Fragment\n\nContent Fragment\n\nContent Fragment List\n\nContainer Components\n\nContainer\n\nCarousel\n\nTabs\n\nAccordion\n\nForm Components\n\nCore Form container\n\nForm text field\n\nForm options field\n\nForm hidden field\n\nForm button\n\nTo learn about the main upcoming components and features, visit the roadmap wiki page.\n\nTo include the Core Components in a new project, we strongly advise to use the AEM Project Archetype; this guarantees a starting point that complies to all recommended practices from Adobe.\n\nFor existing projects, take example from the AEM Project Archetype by looking at the core.wcm.components references in the main pom.xml, in all/pom.xml, and in ui.apps/pom.xml. For the rest, make sure to create Proxy Components, to load the client libraries and to allow the components on the template, as instructed in Using Core Components.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nCore Components AEM as a Cloud Service AEM 6.5 Java SE Maven 2.25.4+ Continual 6.5.21.0+ 8,\n\n11 3.3.9+\n\nFor the requirements from previous Core Component releases, see Historical System Requirements.\n\nThe Core Components require the use of editable templates and do not support Classic UI nor static templates. If needed, check out the AEM Modernization Tools.\n\nSetup your local development environment for AEM as a Cloud Service SDK or for older versions of AEM.\n\nTo compile your own version of the Core Components, you can build and install everything on your running AEM instance by issuing the following command in the top level folder of the project:\n\nmvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage\n\nYou can also install individual packages/bundles by issuing the following command in the top-level folder of the project:\n\nmvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -pl <project_name(s)> -am\n\nWith AEM as a Cloud Service SDK, use the cloud profile as follows to deploy the components into /libs instead of /apps:\n\nmvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage,cloud\n\nNote that:\n\n-pl/-projects option specifies the list of projects that you want to install\n\n-am/-also-make option specifies the dependencies that should also be built\n\nFor detailed informations see BUILDING.md.\n\nThe Core Components leverage both OSGi configurations and Sling context-aware configurations. For a description of defined configurations see CONFIGS.md\n\nKnown Issues\n\nThe provided oEmbed URL Processor configuration for Facebook and Instagram is not working at the moment as a new version of the endpoint was released by Facebook and now an access token needs to be passed in the request. A possible workaround is described in #1225"
