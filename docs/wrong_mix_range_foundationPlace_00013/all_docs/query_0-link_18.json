Code of practice - UK guidelines that dictate how to comply with the UK Disability Discrimination Act 1995 • UNE 139803 - Spanish accessibility guidelines that track very closely to WCAG standards\n\n9. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com AODA & WCAG • AODA : Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act • January 1st, 2025.

In reality a lot of customization was required\n\n12. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Project Goals • Layouts, templates, design, components needed to be compliant • Accessibility Checker must provide “0” errors • Screen reader validation (Jaws & VoiceOver) • Accessibility notice for rare cases • Ability for site users to customize overall look (font, contrast, size, character spacing)\n\n13. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Accessibility Dashboard • Choice of style is kept in browser cookie • Cookie value is then assigned to HTML element • Cookie value = CSS class • Preview area for users\n\n14. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Accessibility Dashboard\n\n15. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com How did we approach the project? • To achieve the accessibility requirements, INM: • Ensured that all components used by authors were compliant • All templates included properties and options that authors needed to fill out to comply • AEM default components that were not compliant were hidden from authors (i.e. the default table component) • Accessibility Checker was integrated into the AEM authoring environment to support author compliance\n\n16. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Accessibility Checker Integration • Hosted on AWS • You install an AEM Package on Authoring Environment • Authors get a “Check AA Compliancy” button for real-time validation before publishing a page • Available now as a Private Beta\n\n17. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Accessibility Checker Integration\n\n18. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Headaches worth pinpointing • Tables – upgrade WYSIWYG plugin to add captions, summary attribute, scope attribute to associate header cells with data cells • Radio buttons/checkbox : Fieldset Legend was not available OOTB • Override LayoutHelper class to add “required” text beside labels as it was just a “*” for required fields\n\n19. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com Headaches worth pinpointing • Aria attributes were not available OOTB on form components, Bootstrap Accessibility plugin helped • Text component generating <b> and <i> tags instead of <strong> and <em>, not handled well by screen readers • Integrate latest version of RECATPCHA from Google for it’s new simple action validation\n\n20. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com In the end… • Many people start with a strong assumption that many elements for accessibility come OOTB with AEM. In reality a lot of customization was required • Projects built on INM AEM Foundation are WCAG 2.0 “AA”/AODA compliant • It was very helpful to have the Accessibility Checker integrated within the author instance\n\n21. www.INM.com +1 514 871 1333 info@INM.com"
