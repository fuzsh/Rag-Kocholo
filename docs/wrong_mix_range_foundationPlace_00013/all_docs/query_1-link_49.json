C2PA is a Joint Development Foundation project, formed through an alliance between Adobe, Arm, Intel, Microsoft and Truepic.\n\nC2PA unifies the efforts of the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) which focuses on systems to provide context and history for digital media, and Project Origin, a Microsoft- and BBC-led initiative that tackles disinformation in the digital news ecosystem.\n\nThe C2PA held a major event on January 26, 2022 where policymakers, academics and industry leaders discussed the future of responsible digital media creation, publication and sharing.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe C2PA Specification along with a series of companion documents can be found here. That site offers a “Downloads” menu where PDF versions of each of the documents can be obtained.\n\nFeedback on the specification can be provided in our github issues.\n\nIntroduction Video\n\nThis video will introduce the technology used to power the C2PA Specification."
