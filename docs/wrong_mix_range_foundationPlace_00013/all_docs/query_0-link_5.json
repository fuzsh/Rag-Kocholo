Each year, employees drive millions of dollars in grants to support local nonprofits to address challenges in our hometowns.\n\nAdobe employees from around the world can invite eligible nonprofits to apply for a grant that supports our largest office communities. Then, groups of employee-led grant review panels at each office decide which organizations best align with Adobeâ€™s philanthropic work and local priorities to receive funding.\n\nThe ECF application window is March through April. Organizations must be invited to apply by an active Adobe employee to access the application link. Check out where employees create change through ECF below."
