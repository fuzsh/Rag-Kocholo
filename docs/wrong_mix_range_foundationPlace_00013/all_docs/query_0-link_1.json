        "text": "People\n\nThis place is packed with super-smart people who do their best work together. We embrace our differences and ensure we have fun along the way. We walk the talk on fair pay and opportunity. And we go out of our way to make everyone feel included through employee networks, clubs, and year-round celebrations.\n\nPurpose\n\nGreat ideas come from everywhere in the company, and the next one could be yours. Join us if you’re game for challenging and meaningful work that impacts our customers, our communities, and everyone who experiences our products. We also realize that being the best at what you do requires constant learning. We’ll invest in your growth and keep feedback flowing through our Adobe Check-In conversations.\n\nPride\n\nThere’s a lot to be proud of when you have the Adobe “A” on your badge, like under-the-hood AI and machine learning technology, household names like Adobe Photoshop and PDF, and our ability to transform how people and brands tell their stories. We’re also an award-winning employer for giving employees the space to be who they are and the support to become who they want to be.\n\nFrom Design and Legal to Engineering and Sales, we hire exceptional talent with the best ideas — and together we’re changing the world through digital experiences. Explore our teams and turn your passion into purpose.\n\nExplore the teams\n\nLive well.\n\nAt Adobe, we know that health is more than doctor visits and life is much more than work. That’s why we go beyond generous medical, dental, and vision benefits for you and your family. Into yoga or working out with a trainer? You’ll get wellness reimbursements. Feeling stressed? Our employee assistance team is here to help. Best of all, we know that work and life are intertwined so we’re a flexible, high-trust workplace. You can manage your own hours and have plenty of time for your people and your passions.\n\nTake time to recharge.\n\nNot gonna lie — we work hard here. But we work smart, too, by balancing things out with vacations, holidays, and company breaks plus time off when personal or family challenges crop up. And in most locations, every five years we’ll give you a paid sabbatical to say thanks for everything you’ve done to keep Adobe’s winning streak going.\n\nFuel your creativity.\n\nFocus. Energy. Yummy snacks and those fizzy waters you love. It takes a lot to be creative all day, but we’ve got you covered. Practice meditation and mindfulness with coaching from Headspace. Build healthy habits with LifeDojo. Eat local, sustainable, delectable fare at our cafes, and plunder our pantries for fresh fruit and other goodies whenever you need a boost.\n\nFocus on your future.\n\nLet’s face it — we all work to support ourselves and our families. And after years of hard work, we all deserve a secure future. Adobe doesn’t just offer financial benefits like a 401(k) plan, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and employee stock options — we also help you make sense of them, make the most of them, and make your down-the-road dreams a reality.\n\nNever stop learning.\n\nWant to explore data science, pick up new coding skills, or get that MBA? We love it! Learning is everything around here, so we kick in serious cash for higher education and professional development. We also offer leadership development opportunities, training through LinkedIn Learning and Harvard ManageMentor, and more.\n\nWant to give back? We can help.\n\nWish you could do more for the causes close to your heart? At Adobe, you can. When you give your time and money, we send a matching donation. When you want to help out your local community, we provide funds and opportunities. And since your volunteer work is real work, we always take it into account when looking at your career growth and plans."
