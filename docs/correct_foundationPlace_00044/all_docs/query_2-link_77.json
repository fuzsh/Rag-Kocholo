        "text": "OTTAWA, ON, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Solace, a leader in powering real-time, event-driven enterprises, announced today that Qlik, a leading provider of real-time data integration and analytics solutions, has selected Solace PubSub+ Platform to meet their solution's real-time event distribution requirements.\n\nAs Qlik's Cloud service has experienced a significant year-over-year growth, Qlik needed to optimize its event platform with a low latency solution. Qlik approached Solace and selected their PubSub+ Platform to meet its growing needs.\n\n\"The real-time, reliable distribution of events within Qlik's distributed system is a critical component of our solution and enables Qlik's customers to move faster and work smarter so we needed to make sure our solution is built on the best event-driven architecture platform available. That's why when it came time to revisit our solution's data distribution framework, we chose Solace and their PubSub+ platform,\" said Mike Potter, CTO, Qlik.\n\nAfter a rigorous evaluation and proof of concept, Qlik selected PubSub+ Platform because it best met their performance criteria and they found it easy to deploy in a variety of environments.

We are proud they have selected PubSub+ Platform to serve as such an important element of their innovative real-time data integration and analytics offering,\" said Bill Jackes, SVP Americas, Solace.\n\nQlik is actively rolling out Solace to their commercial and FedRAMP clients and will continue to expand their deployment throughout 2024.\n\nAbout Qlik\n\nQlik converts complex data landscapes into actionable insights, driving strategic business outcomes.
