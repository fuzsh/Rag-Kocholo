        "text": "Project Description\n\nTransforming a tedious, manual process to organized, automated deployments.\n\nOur long-term partner, Active Ingredients enlisted us to help Qlik optimize their deployment process so their IT department could spend more time developing and less time deploying. The manual process included up to 15 systems, was prone to human error, and could take up to a whole business day to manage. Our automated release process resulted in approximately 3 minute builds and under 10 minutes deployments per-environment. Most importantly, we reduced human intervention steps to a click of a button.\n\nStrategy and Implementation\n\nWe started by defining a DevOps strategy to set up a foundation for success. We implemented and enforced a standard source control branching process, and developed a release and hotfix strategy with the teams. All procedures were documented for both developers and build administrators.\n\nThe deployment process and tools were tailored to Qlikâ€™s release strategy. This included triggering builds based on defined merge/commit operations, and using custom config transformation to adjust environment-specific settings per node."
