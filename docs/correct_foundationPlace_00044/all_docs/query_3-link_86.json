Market model\n\n25. 77 Visual analytics market — shift in centricity Business and personal External data Analysis-centric Analytic platforms Most “new” data is generated outside the organization from diverse sources From system centricity to business unit and eventually personal centricity Classic market disruption Data Centricity Analytic Centricity Buyer Centricity Seller Centricity IT Developer Data Scientist Business Analyst Information Worker Descriptive Diagnostic Predictive Prescriptive Mainstream shifting from “report-centric w/ some analysis” to “analysis-centric w/ some reporting” Volume Velocity Variety Stack Vendors Specialist Tools Analytic Platforms\n\n26. 78 A shift to external data Data Centricity IT Personal LoB CloudOn-premise • “Half of the organizations access external data sources” • Increasingly data is born in the cloud, especially for mid-market and down • No clear leader in Cloud BI ─ 7% of total BI market spend ─ 25% of new 2016 spend ─ 40% planning on adopting 2016 • Data connectivity, both on- and off-premise, key to capture market share\n\n27. 79 A shift to analysis Analytic Centricity Backward looking Forward looking • “Half of new buying is data discovery-driven” • Also driven by analytic applications and embedded analytics • Reporting is still important, but increasingly a commodity (and key to stack replacement) • Significant rise in competition ─ Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP Lumira, Microstrategy Analytics Desktop, IBM Watson, Domo… • Battle today is analytics but tomorrow will be Smart Data Discovery with prediction and prescription\n\n28. 80 A shift to business driven Buyer Centricity IT Business Personal • “Half of buying will be driven from the business” • Central IT to business IT to personal • Users demand the control of analysis centric BI: usability, speed, context, time to value • Critical advantage to those that make the data supply chain easy to consume • From traditional BI to big data and visual analytics\n\n29. 81 A shift to analytic platforms Seller Centricity High Governance Low LowAgilityHigh • “Majority of BI vendors made data discovery their prime BI platform offering.” • Enterprise IT = low agility but high governance • Desktop/small workgroup = high agility but low integration • Dominant design will emerge from a business unit-centric approach providing, agility for the business but strength and trust for IT • Enterprise readiness will be key to long-term success\n\n31. 83 Qlik corporate social responsibility Change Our World • Leveraging our people, products, and culture to make a difference • Touching a billion lives"
