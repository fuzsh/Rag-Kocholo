This partnership aligns with our mission to offer travellers a seamless and enjoyable travel experience while maintaining our focus on affordability and convenience.”\n\n“We’re pleased to enhance our partnership with GO7, Blade and Monacair to offer our customers a swift 7-minute helicopter ride between Nice and Monaco. Emirates has been serving Nice with world-class services for more than 30 years and we look forward to raising the bar even higher with seamless door-to-door travel experiences. We remain committed to the French Riveria and look forward to flying our customers better in the air and on-ground.”\n\n“We are delighted to offer Emirates passengers the ability to fly from Dubai into Monaco with a seamless connection from their Emirates flight directly to a BLADE helicopter to Monaco. They will enjoy the best views of the French Riviera while skipping an hour and a half of traffic. With the time they save, they will have plenty of time to enjoy our Monaco BLADE Lounge upon their arrival or one of our Nice lounges upon their return.”\n\n“We are pleased to deepen our partnerships with Icelandair and GO7. Their networks and intermodal capabilities complement our European presence, providing an array of connections for our customers to simplify their journeys. Together, we will open up new travel opportunities, and more choice for customers wishing to travel across Europe. We believe that these partnerships will bring real benefits to our customers and business, and we’re taking positive steps towards further strengthening our relationships in the future.”\n\n“As an ultra-low-cost airline, our business model relies on keeping our expenses low. GO7’s innovative and no-complexity approach to expansion is exactly what our airline needs to grow. Working with GO7 enables us to identify new revenue streams as we broaden our route network and connect more travelers here at home and across the globe to the joy of traveling in Canada and beyond.”\n\n“From implementation to training and development of new features, it has been an absolute pleasure working with the GO7 team to bring our vision for LIFT to life. It’s felt like we have another department within our existing team rather than a separate business supporting us.”\n\n“Multichannel distribution is important as it goes hand-in-hand with our network expansion plans for summer 2023. Thanks to our marketing partnership with GO7 and its global distribution technology, Aeroitalia services are now closer to the travel agency community to the benefit of our customers.”\n\n“PNG Air is excited to partner with GO7. For a regional carrier, GO7’s Global BSP Ticketing solution is a winner, helping to optimise GDS sales in non-strategic markets through their global reach, enabling travel agents all over the world to issue PNG Air fares on W2-365 documents, which the airline could not achieve on its own.”"
