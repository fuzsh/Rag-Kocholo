        "text": "One of the nation’s largest credit unions wanted to modernize its analytics and reporting to uncover new insights and opportunities.\n\nQlik Sense enhanced data analysis by reducing the time to insight, providing a diverse set of analyses and reporting all in one place, and enabling on-the-fly investigation and self-serve analytics.\n\nChallenge\n\nSince 2007, ORI has supported data collection, analysis, and reporting for the client’s web-based monthly customer satisfaction survey. Using Qualtrics, the survey tracks overall satisfaction as well as numerous dimensions of the credit union’s value proposition, including various aspects of customer experience and product and channel feedback to inform and enhance customer-facing services and outreach. The client required analyses for different audiences on monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual bases, in addition to monthly data transformations with short turnaround times following the close of each monthly survey. The credit union also needed to be able to analyze and investigate the data flexibly—depending on the outcomes—to identify causes of fluctuations, compare data, answer questions about the results, and perform ad hoc analysis.\n\nSolution\n\nBy implementing Qlik Sense®, ORI modernized the client’s analytics and reporting in order to conduct analyses beyond the existing monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual activities. The modernization effort enabled the client to access unique views of its data and analytics that were not possible prior to the use of Qlik, speed up the ask-analyze-act cycle, reduce manual workload, and improve reporting and sharing efficiency and efficacy.\n\nOutcome\n\nQlik Sense enhanced data analysis by reducing the time to insight, providing a diverse set of analyses and reporting all in one place, and enabling on-the-fly investigation and self-serve analytics. The platform accelerated the ask-analyze-act cycle while also improving the efficiency and efficacy of reporting and sharing. Additionally, the solution freed up client resources by reducing the manual workload of data exploration, custom calculation development and application, and report preparation."
