        "text": "Introduction\n\nI am deeply passionate about 2 fields: Data Science and start-ups.\n\nI feel data science is the only way to enable logical decisions in this world and constantly improve yourself through self-exploration. On the other hand, I am also a start-up guy! Before on-boarding Analytics Vidhya, I had done multiple internships across various start-ups.\n\nI have an inherent fascination and deep rooted respect for entrepreneurs. I consume any kind of content I get, which helps me understand them better. I hope one day, I’ll be able to create significant value for this world we live in through my own pursuit! So, it was only a matter of time before I put out this list – A list of datapreneurs across the globe.\n\nWho is a datapreneur?\n\nA datapreneur is basically an entrepreneur focused on data science. In interest of avoiding the definition conflict, I am using data science in a broad sense – any effort made to extract information from data. So this would include Big Data, Business Intelligence, Business Analytics, Predictive Modeling, Machine learning etc.\n\nPlease see that I am excluding entrepreneurs using data science to solve other problems. Hence, you will not see Larry Page & Sergey Brin in this list! Nor would you see Airbnb or Uber. Similarly, I have not included the likes of Doug Cutting (creator of Hadoop & Lucene). Hope this gives you a purpose of this list.\n\nFurther, in order to represent this list in meaningful manner, I have divided the datapreneurs by their focus areas, namely:\n\nData Products\n\nData Science services\n\nData Science Trainings\n\nData Science Communities\n\nA few more things to note before we look at the list:\n\nThe list is not in any order, each of these contribution is immense and unique!\n\nSome of these companies would have overlapping presence – for example, SAS creates data products and does trainings as well. I have classified them in the area, which I thought was their primary focus\n\nData Products\n\nJim Goodnight & John Sall (SAS)\n\nThe story of SAS began way back in 1976 when Jim and John decided to team up to build a product in business analytics known as SAS. SAS was originally developed to analyze agricultural data. The consistent growth registered in their revenue since 1976 has established their dominance over the years (SAS revenue in 2014 $3.09 Bn). SAS would probably be the world’s largest private software company.\n\nJim Goodnight holds a doctorate in statistics from North Carolina State University, where he was a faculty member from 1972 to 1976. Harvard Business School named him a “Great American Business Leader” for his leadership of a business that has changed the way Americans have lived, worked and interacted. Jim is currently the CEO of SAS.\n\nJohn Sall is the Co-Founder and Executive Vice President at SAS. He earned a bachelor’s degree in history from Beloit College and a master’s degree in economics from Northern Illinois University (NIU). Both NIU and NC State awarded him honorary doctorate. He’s the primary architect for JMP Software. As Sall says, ‘ the goal of JMP is to make statistical modeling as friendly, accessible and informative as possible, and to increase the efficiency of experimentation.\n\nChristian Chabot (Tableau)\n\nTableau is one of the most preferred product in the arena of data visualization.

However, our publishing guidelines prohibit me to put him in this list.\n\nEnd Notes\n\nI think we owe a lot to these datapreneurs for what they have done to create these products, services, trainings and communities. It is difficult to imagine the data science eco-system with out them. I also think that this is just the start of a revolution in making and we will see a lot of action in this area in coming years.\n\nWhat do you think about these contributions? Do you think, there are others who should be added to this list? Or some contribution I have missed? Do let me know your thoughts in comments below."
