        "text": "In this episode of the \"Let's Talk About Data\" we focused on using AI-powered analytics for SAP data with Qlik Cloud and Amazon Bedrock. Host Prasad Matkar is joined by John Park from Qlik and Satish from AWS who provide an overview of how AI can enhance business intelligence and analytics for complex SAP enterprise data.\n\nAmazon Bedrock provides access to large foundation AI models that can understand natural language and generate insights. Qlik Cloud offers an integrated platform for data integration, reporting, and analytics now augmented with AI capabilities like autoML. Together, they enable more robust analytics beyond just descriptive for SAP data. John demonstrates prompting an AI model with a sample business question on SAP data and getting a contextual response. He highlights best practices like high-quality data and metadata, testing for hallucinations, and building capabilities incrementally. Satish elaborates how retrieval augmented generation (RAG) models can continuously integrate external knowledge to provide updated, relevant insights from SAP data. The guests emphasize how AI-powered analytics helps organizations extract more value from their SAP data.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nAI-powered analytics provides predictive insights and recommended actions, beyond just descriptive analytics.\n\nSAP data is highly complex, AI can help analyze it more easily.\n\nAmazon Bedrock provides access to large foundation AI models.\n\nQlik Cloud offers an integrated platform from data integration to reporting, now with AI like autoML.\n\nDemo shows prompting an AI model with a sample business question on SAP data.\n\nAI assists with natural language interfaces, automated data insights, data classification.\n\nBest practices include quality data/metadata, testing for hallucinations, incremental build-up of capabilities.\n\nRAG models integrate external knowledge to generate updated, relevant insights from SAP data.\n\nAI-powered analytics helps organizations extract more value from their SAP data.\n\nLoading...\n\nPrasad Matkar - Database Specialist Solutions Architect @ AWS\n\nJohn Park - Solution Architect @ Qlik\n\nSathisan Vannadil - Sr. Partner Solutions Architect @ AWS"
