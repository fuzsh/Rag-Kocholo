        "text": "Numerous organisations have consistently ranked BI as their top priority among application and technology advancements, which attracts most of the investments and garners substantial attention from the leadership. The course's main goal is to strike a balance between theory and practice by considering the demands of the current employment requirements in ICT and business trends.\n\nThe course explores BI at both micro and macro levels. At the micro level, the development of BI applications is covered by defining a business problem and identifying the necessary data to answer the identified problem. Students will work in small groups to address a real-world problem given a set of data. As part of the assignment each group must hand in a written report and make an oral presentation. The overarching goal is that students should acquire knowledge on how to develop BI applications and design BI solutions for different BI users and use cases.\n\nAt the macro level, the course explores theoretical advancements of BI from the standpoint of information systems and overarching effects of BI across the entire organisation. Issues related to data integration, data modelling, data quality, meta-data, data management, BI architecture, data visualisation, data storytelling, Big Data and scalability are addressed. Moreover, contemporary BI trends, such as BI governance, privacy, ethics, and AI are also partly covered. Overall, the course describes the evolution and current state of BI theory and practice.\n\nThe teaching method consists of lectures, guest lectures from industry and/or academic experts, seminars, computer laboratories, and individual and group supervision through office hours.\n\nThe course doesn't require any programming and database knowledge, but having such knowledge can be advantageous, particularly since Qlik Sense and Power BI are used in the group project for creating a BI application. As part of the course enrolment process, Qlik Sense licenses are allocated to students in the beginning of the course.\n\nCourse director\n\nBlerim Emruli\n\nHow to apply\n\nLund University uses a national application system run by University Admissions in Sweden.
