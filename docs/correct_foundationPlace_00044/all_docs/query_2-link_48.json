But many users do not realize it is also an emerging alternative for planning and budgeting applications. Several vendors complement Qlik with functionality ranging from data entry to preconfigured CPM solutions for financial planning.\n\nIn our webinar series, you will get an overview of the market trend to integrate planning functionality directly into leading reporting technologies from Microsoft, Qlik and Tableau.\n\nThis event focuses on Qlik: four providers of data entry & planning add-ons present their solutions in direct comparison and then answer viewers’ questions in a panel discussion.\n\nAfter an introduction to the market by BARC Fellow Stefan Sexl, the vendors demonstrate their solutions. The focus is on architecture, planning models, front end design and the use of add-ons.\n\nWatch to find out whether your existing Qlik installation could be the foundation for your next-generation planning and budgeting solution.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I register for the webinar?\n\nPlease enter your details in the form above and click on “Submit” or \"Register\". After a few minutes, you will receive a registration confirmation email.\n\nIs participation in the webinar free of charge?\n\nAbsolutely! We want to provide you with free knowledge that can benefit you in your work. Keep us in mind when you need assistance with your next project!\n\nWhy do I have to give my details to participate?\n\nWe ask you to provide some information in exchange for our free content so we can send you information from time to time that may be of interest to you.\n\nWhy can't I register for the webinar with my private email address?\n\nSince we operate in the B2B space, we only accept registrations from business addresses. If for some reason you would like to register with your private email address, please contact us directly at info@barc.de.\n\nHow do I fill out the form field \"I...\"?\n\nHere is some guidance:\n\nIf your company does not offer software consulting or solutions, and the use of one or more software solutions (e.g., BI or ECM solutions) is either part of your everyday work or in the pipeline, then please select the option \"work for a software user company\" regardless of your industry sector or company size.\n\nDo you work for a company that offers software solutions (e.g., BI or ECM solutions)? Then please select \"work for a software provider\".\n\nIf your company offers IT/software consulting or services, then \"work for an IT service provider/consulting firm\" is the right choice.\n\nDo you work or study in an educational institution such as a university or a research institute? Then choose \"work/study in an educational institution\".\n\nDo you work as an IT journalist and write technical articles, features, blogs etc. for media companies? Then please click on \"work as a journalist\".\n\nDoes your company invest in companies in the B2B software sector? Then please select \"work for an investment company.\"\n\nIf you do not feel you belong to any of the above categories, please select \"None of the above/Other\".\n\nI am having problems submitting the form.\n\nIf you are unable to submit the form, please copy the URL of this page and open it in another browser. Google Chrome usually works fine. If that doesn’t work, please try Firefox, Microsoft Edge or Safari.\n\nWhy haven't I received a registration confirmation email?\n\nIf you have not received a confirmation email after a few minutes, please do the following:\n\nCheck your spam folder. Did the email land there? If not...\n\nHave you unsubscribed from all BARC mailings in the past? Check this by entering your email address in the form. If the text \"You are currently unsubscribed from receiving emails\" appears below your email address, click on it. We will then send you an automated email. Click on the link in the email to enter your \"Subscription Center\". To ensure you receive an email with the link to free content, please select \"BARC products and services\". Now fill out the form again. If you still do not receive an email, please continue with step 3.\n\nAre BARC’s email sending domains blocked in your company? This could be the case if your colleagues do not receive BARC mailings either. Please ask your IT/email team to add BARC's email sending domain to their allowlist. This will enable you to receive emails from BARC. That wasn't the problem either? Then off to step 4.\n\nIt seems that we made a mistake. We apologize for that. Please contact info@barc.de and describe your problem in detail, if possible with screenshots. We will find a solution as soon as possible. Promise!\n\nWhy can I participate in the webinar free of charge?\n\nYour free participation in the webinar is made possible by our sponsors.
