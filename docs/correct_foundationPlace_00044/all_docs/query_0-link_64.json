Qlik History Founded in Lund, Sweden in 1993, originally called “QuikView” as in “Quality, Understanding, Interaction, Knowledge” Product was designed as a way to reduce the brain works. A key aspect was the color-coding scheme in which selected values are highlighted in green, linked values in white, and excluded values in highlighted grey First two versions were basically written in Excel using VLOOKUPs Håkan Wolgé was later hired as lead software engineer to re-architect/re-write QlikView from the ground up as an in-memory application Renamed as “QlikView” in 1996 IPO’ed on Nasdaq in 2010 under symbol “QLIK” and was 7th best IPO of 2010 Now has over 24,000 customers Introduction to Qlikview3\n\n4. How Traditional BI works Introduction to Qlikview4\n\n5. How Traditional BI works Traditional OLAP/cube technologies primarily provide the ability to drill up and down through “dimension” hierarchies, allowing the end- user to see pre-aggregated “measures” Dimensions and measures must be know a prior any drill down activity A data warehouse or data mart is usually required as a pre-requisite before OLAP cubes can be built Detail record identification is very complex process ETL is very slow to test, which in turn slows down development time QlikView uses the word “associative” to distinguish itself from other BI vendors Introduction to Qlikview5\n\n6. Functionality of QlikView QlikView is a business discovery platform –User driven BI supporting the creation and consumption of dynamic apps for analysing the information. It’s allow non technical users to explore visual views of information , through simple interaction such as clicks and taps and it has patented software engine dynamically calculates new views of information , instantly based on user selection  QlikView does with in-memory technology that really makes a difference.  Has an inference engine that maintains the associations in the data automatically.  Calculates aggregations on the fly, as needed, for a super-fast user experience.  Compresses data down to 10% of its original size to optimise the power of the processors  The Result - Less Maintenance and Faster Deployment Introduction to Qlikview6\n\n7. What users do with QlikView Explore visual view of information through simple interaction Start any where and go anywhere  Make selection any chart and objects  Evaluate result across entire apps  Search across all data  Immediate time of the response, with no restrictions on the amount of data  Fast integration of all data from various sources into a single application  common decision-making process and real-time collaboration  Access, analyze and retrieve data from mobile devices Introduction to Qlikview7\n\n8. QlikView Workflow Introduction to Qlikview8\n\n9. QlikView Process Flow QlikView Clients QlikView Server Data sources Desktop Client IE plugin AJAX Client Mobile devices Introduction to Qlikview9\n\n10. QV Architecture Introduction to Qlikview10\n\n11. QV components  Directory Service Connector : Passes authentication to specified Directory Services such as Active Directory.  QlikView Distribution Service : Reloads, distributes and reduces QlikView dashboards and emails PDFs.  QlikView Management Service : Hosts the Management console and sends settings to the other services.  QlikView Server : Hosts the QlikView files in memory and performs user requested data analysis.  QlikView Webserver: The web server for the Access Point and the AJAX pages which are presented to Introduction to Qlikview11\n\n12. QV supported output formats  QlikView Graph can be exported to excel, image files, pdf  QlikView able to query and generate report from DB.  QlikView able to save query result to Excel (Word, pdf and PowerPoint)  QlikView able to drill-in/drill-out, dicing and slicing  Support real-time dashboards/reports.  You can pass QlikView result to other QlikView application Introduction to Qlikview12\n\n13. QV definition of licenses Named CAL Named User CAL is assigned to a unique and identified user who may access as many QlikView documents as may reside on the server or server cluster to which the Named User CAL is assigned. Document CAL A Document CAL is assigned to a unique and identified user who may access only the one QlikView document to which the Document CAL is assigned. Multiple Document CALs can be assigned to a particular user. Session CAL One QlikView client to access as many QlikView documents as may reside on the server or server cluster to which the Session CAL is assigned for a minimum period of 15 minutes. Usage CAL Usage CAL allows any user, identified or anonymous/unidentified, to access only one QlikView document, residing on the server or server cluster to which the Usage CAL is assigned, from one client (for example, the AJAX client, QlikView Desktop, or the Internet Explorer plugin) for a time period of 60 minutes per 28-day period.
