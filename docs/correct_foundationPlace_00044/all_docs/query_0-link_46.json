THE 1 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 BI SURVEY 13 The Customer Verdict The world’s largest survey of business intelligence software users This document is a specially produced summary by BARC of the headline results for QlikTech QlikTech in The BI Survey\n\n2.

In total, 3,149 people responded to The Survey with 2,298 answering a series of detailed questions about their usage of a named product. Altogether, 30 products or groups of products received a detailed analysis. The BI Survey 13 examines BI product selection and usage among users in areas including business benefits, costs, proportion of employees using the product, competitiveness, recommendation, innovation, performance, customer satisfaction and agility. One thing that all BI deployments ought to have in common is that they should deliver business benefits. We asked several questions that helped us measure how successful respondents’ deployments had been. The combined results were then used as a calibration tool that is widely used throughout The Survey to assess the correlation between many factors and project success. QlikTech overview QlikView is the main product of QlikTech, an American company originally founded as a consulting company in the Swedish university town of Lund in 1993. Its headquarters moved to Pennsylvania in 2005 after it raised funds from several venture capital firms. QlikTech went public in 2010. QlikTech has grown very quickly. The company says it has more than 26,000 customers in 100 countries and more than $320m revenue in 2011 and $388.5 million in 2012. QlikTech is commonly cited as a competitor by other vendors we speak with. It has very successfully addressed the self-service BI requirements of business users in both functionality and go-to-market. QlikTech customer responses QlikTech has featured in The BI Survey for several years. This year 178 respondents reported on their experiences with the tool, more than any other product in The Survey. About 73 percent of participants said they were using QlikView version 11 and 22 percent version 10. The rest of the respondents used older versions.\n\n4. QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 User and use case demographics Product usage 75% Dashboards 21% 70% Ad hoc query 19% Standard/Enterprise Reporting 69% 21% Visual Analysis/Data Discovery 65% 19% 36% Budgeting/Planning OLAP Analysis 29% 28% 19% Financial Consolidation 28% 31% Predictive Analytics/ Data Mining 25% 40% In use Planned QlikView is a dashboard and analysis platform based on in-memory technology which is particularly suitable for set analysis. The solution offers simplicity, performance and agility and is well positioned for the self-service BI market. Customers seem to use the solution for a broad range of applications. The analysis results produced in QlikView are used in dashboard and reporting applications. 4\n\n5. 5 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Company size (number of employees) Percentage of employees using QlikTech Average 49% 35% 15% 13% Average of all products 15% Number of users using QlikTech Median Less than 100 - 2500 More than 100 2500 50 Mean 379 QlikView continues to increase penetration in both mid-market and large enterprise\n\n6. QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Peer Groups Peer groups are used to ensure similar products are compared against each other both in fairness to the vendor and for the benefit of the customer. The groups are essential to allow fair and useful comparisons of products that are likely to compete. The peer groups are primarily data-driven and based on how customers say they use the product. QlikTech features in the following peer groups: - Large International Vendors - Dashboard Vendors - Visual Analysis and Data Discovery Vendors The KPIs The BI Survey 13 provides the reader with well-designed dashboards packed with concise information using aggregated KPIs, which can be absorbed at a glance. The KPIs all follow these simple rules: - Only measures that have a clear good/bad trend are used as the basis for KPIs - KPIs may be based on one or more measures from The BI Survey - Only products with samples of at least 20 - 30 (depending on the KPI) for each of the questions that feeds into the KPI are included - Each KPI is normalized so that the overall sample always has a value of 1.0 - The KPIs are calculated so that better-than-average products always have scores of greater than 1.0, while less good products score less than 1.0. When viewing the peer group KPI charts, note that the average for each peer group will usually be either higher or lower than 1.0 because the peer groups are all subsets of the overall sample. The products are sorted by value, the better the product the higher the value. The average is displayed as a green bar and separates the products into two groups, the ones that have performed better than average and the ones that have performed worse than average. 6\n\n7. 7 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 For more details on the KPIs, see the ‘KPIs and Dashboards’ document.

Given the fact that QlikTech often seems to be in evaluation considerations among large international vendors, the customers seem to achieve the goals they set. 8\n\n9. 9 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Leading Large International Vendor in considered for purchase Based on whether respondents considered purchasing the product Microsoft SSAS (1) 2.79 QlikTech (2) 2.75 SAP BW (3) 2.43 2.32 IBM Cognos BI (4) Microsoft SSRS (5) 2.01 Microsoft Excel (6) 1.81 1.57 Average MicroStrategy (7) 1.46 1.27 IBM Cognos TM1 (8) SAP BO WebI (9) 1.18 1.11 Oracle Essbase (10) Oracle BI Found.

As a result, QlikTech is the top ranked vendor in the Visual Analysis & Data Discovery Vendor and Dashboard Vendor peer groups, as well as one of the leading vendors in the Large International Vendor peer group for the ‘considered for purchase’ KPI. This is an achievement for a considerably smaller vendor operating at the same level as other, very large vendors and reflects the companies huge investment in marketing and sales. 10\n\n11. 11 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Leading Large International Vendor in competitiveness Combines the ‘Considered for purchase’, ‘Competitive win rate’ and ‘Chosen as standard’ KPIs Microsoft SSAS (1) 1.68 SAP BW (2) 1.53 QlikTech (3) 1.47 Microsoft SSRS (4) 1.44 IBM Cognos BI (5) 1.34 Microsoft Excel (6) 1.25 1.18 Average MicroStrategy (7) 1.12 SAP BO WebI (8) 1.10 Oracle Essbase (9) 1.05 IBM Cognos TM1 (10) 0.99 Oracle BI Found.

QlikTech is competitive in this area due to its agility in sales situations. The sales process is targeted towards a short proof of concept and can show rapid benefits to the customer. QlikTech also uses a large partner network efficiently. This network is an excellent asset for the vendor. 12\n\n13. 13 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Top ranked Large International Vendor in collaboration How many sites currently use collaboration features with their BI tool QlikTech (1) 1.36 SAS (2) 1.28 IBM Cognos TM1 (3) 0.98 Microsoft Excel (4) 0.96 Infor (5) 0.95 Microsoft SSAS (6) 0.93 Microsoft SSRS (7) 0.92 Average 0.84 Oracle Essbase (8) 0.78 MicroStrategy (9) 0.75 Oracle BI Found.

Users can use text field or bookmarks to annotate published content. Customers can also make threaded, chat-like comments. In QlikView 11.2 there is also a new feature called collaborative sessions that helps users view and interact with QlikView applications without needing a licence. V12 will have a different name and will be released at the end of the year. Previews suggest that enabling collaborative workspaces and user experiences is one of the main improvements in the new version. 14\n\n15. 15 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Leading Large International Vendor in mobile BI How many sites currently use mobile BI with their BI tool MicroStrategy (1) Oracle BI Found.

The vendor has also invested in HTML5 technology for displaying interactive content to users. As a result the mobile device experience and user interfaces have dictated the way future GUI interfaces will be developed in QlikTech. By contrast, we weren’t impressed by the company’s mobile client. The non-native implementation of the software is perhaps not adapting to the device, but the company is working on this.\n\n16. QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Leading Large International Vendor in advanced information design How many sites currently use advanced information design with their BI tool Infor (1) MicroStrategy (2) Information Builders (3) QlikTech (4) SAS (5) Oracle Essbase (6) Microsoft SSRS (7) Average Microsoft SSAS (8) Oracle BI Found.

Another jump in innovation has been announced for 2013/14 and it will be interesting to see if the company can make this move successfully. 16\n\n17. 17 QlikTech in THE BI Survey 13 Leading Large International Vendor in innovation Combines the ‘Cloud BI’, ‘Collaboration’, ‘Mobile BI’ and ‘Advanced information design’ KPIs to measure the product’s level of innovation 1.22 MicroStrategy (1) 1.18 QlikTech (2) 1.10 Oracle BI Found.
