        "text": "#CelebratingSuccess with the Qlik Web Team led by AnnaMae Wilson, alongside Omer Arman, Annie Ho and Michael Marquis, who won our 'We Succeed Together' Core Values Award at our recent Town Hall. The web team delivered a brand new, optimized website that reflects a best-in-class experience and incorporated our new branding and Talend products. This undertaking could have taken 12-18 months to complete, but with support from many cross-functional teams, this team delivered the work in less than seven months. Qlik CEO Mike Capone commented: \"What these folks and their teams were able to deliver together – in partnership with marketing, legal, strategy, and the business – was an incredible feat.\" Fantastic achievement from everyone involved! #WeAreHiring!
