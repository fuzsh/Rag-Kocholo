        "text": "In order to operate a successful business, corporate leaders must have visibility into the performance of the company across all areas. Access to data and analytics not only enhances business intelligence but also empowers smarter decision-making.\n\nFor many businesses, QlikView has been the product that’s enabled companies across many industries to gain greater business intelligence on their way to more intelligent decision-making for a successful long-term future. These insights have transformed businesses, making them more efficient and collaborative through customizable dashboards and other business-driven data capabilities.\n\nTo further improve business intelligence, Qlik Sense is a next-generation platform that empowers modern, self-service oriented analytics.\n\nAlthough Qlik Sense and QlikView share similar properties, Qlik Sense is not an updated version of QlikView but rather a product that supports the full range of analytics use cases across an organization.\n\nDoes it make sense for your business to migrate to Qlik Sense? Here are three reasons why Qlik Sense could be a premier product for your organization.\n\n1. Qlik Sense Is Located on a Multi-Cloud Architecture\n\nData is vitally important to any business, thus it’s imperative that a business’s data is completely secure. Qlik Sense’s hybrid, multi-cloud capabilities provide unparalleled security and trust for companies across even the most demanding industries.\n\nThe hybrid architecture enables companies to deploy the platform both on-premise and in the cloud, in order to align with specific company needs in the present and as they evolve in the future.\n\nThis setup provides ultimate flexibility, allowing for use on any device thanks to a responsive mobile design.\n\n2. Qlik Sense Is an End-to-End, Customizable Product\n\nFrom data preparation to visualization to exploration and collaboration, Qlik Sense supports the entire analytics life-cycle.\n\nIt’s also a robust and customizable platform that offers a complete set of open and standard APIs for developers to build custom applications, embed analytics in operational apps and even extend Qlik Sense functionality for standard technology skill sets such as HTML5, JavaScript and .NET.\n\nThis level of customization allows the platform to meet unique business needs without sacrificing efficiency or effectiveness.\n\n3. Qlik Sense Empowers Greater Collaboration\n\nEverything is centralized on Qlik Sense, allowing users to easily find and share relevant analytics with coworkers. Analytics can be published for others to use, and users can leverage Qlik Sense’s hybrid cloud setup to share and collaborate with users across both on-premise and cloud deployments.\n\nThis level of collaboration enables users to build the shared knowledge, confidence and trust that improves businesses and better positions them for long-term success.\n\nAm I Right for Qlik Sense?\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Qlik Sense is how it can be applicable to current QlikView users as well.\n\nAlthough Qlik Sense is not an updated version of QlikView, they do share similar properties, such as how they both run on Qlik’s Associative Engine. With this Associative Engine as the foundation for both the Qlik Sense and QlikView platforms, existing QlikView assets like data models and analytics expressions can be easily reused in Qlik Sense.\n\nOur continued commitment to invest in both products and how they exist with one another helps ensure that companies who choose to leverage Qlik Sense and QlikView in their environments will benefit from their invaluable and distinct capabilities for greater business intelligence."
