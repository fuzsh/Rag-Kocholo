Qlik approached Solace and selected their PubSub+ Platform to meet its growing needs.\n\nSolution\n\nAfter a rigorous evaluation and proof of concept, Qlik selected PubSub+ Platform because it best met their performance criteria and they found it easy to deploy in a variety of environments. They purchased the software on a subscription basis from the AWS Marketplace, which provides financial benefits.\n\nBenefits\n\nWith PubSub+ Platform as part of their SaaS offering, Qlik can ensure a consistent, low-latency experience for their clients. Furthermore, migrating to PubSub+ will let them scale by an order of magnitude while still meeting their latency requirement."
