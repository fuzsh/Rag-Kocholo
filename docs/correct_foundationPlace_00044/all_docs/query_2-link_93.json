        "text": "10 / 10\n\nTom, COOK\n\nQlik Sense Advanced Scripting\n\nI have now completed three Qlik training courses with Websy, going from having never used Qlik to completing the Advanced Scripting Course. All have built on knowledge from the previous with a lot of new information as well. Peter is more than happy to into more detail about any of the areas that were relevant to what I have been working on day to day. I am now comfortable building ETL in Qlik from source and front ends to visualise the data. I would happily recommend the courses to anyone looking to learn or improve their Qlik skills.\n\n10 / 10\n\nJosé P. Díaz G., Diextra International, S.R.L.\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - Level 1\n\nThis is a great quick-booster course that could be extremely useful for QlikView experts that do not have a lot of experience with web development, and would like to become proficient in creating web applications that integrate visualizations from Qlik Sense and third parties. The content of the course is well structured and includes plenty of hands-on exercises. I estimate that what I learned by taking this course with Liam Walton probably saved me of at least a month of work exploring the Qlik Capabilities API on my own,\n\n10 / 10\n\nPaul Pirolli, Advance Central Services\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - Level 2\n\nI don't have any background in Web Development. Having prepared for this class (on my own) with some basic Javascript, HTML and CSS classes, I found the class & Liam's presentation very helpful in learning how to create mashups with the Qlik Sense API's. He did an excellent job demonstrating how to create a working app while showing the complexity of the scripts. I would recommend the class for anyone new to Qlik mashups who has some elementary understanding of the syntax & elements of web development.\n\n8 / 10\n\nShah Ali, Informance\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - 3 Day Fast Track\n\nI like to commend Liam for his exceptional knowledge and the energy to deliver the course, he made it all that more enjoyable which is conducive to learning. All our questions were answered and Liam’s willingness to investigate questions further meant that we were getting a better understanding of the concepts. I can see the course might be basic for seasoned web developers who are looking into working with Qlik APIs. However, for complete novices like myself, I did find the Web technologies a challenge to learn quickly and implement with Qlik APIs. Given the nature of Web technologies with the added complexity of Qlik APIs, there was a lot to take in and digest within the course. Having said that, the course activities did significantly help with the learning and developing Qlik Mashups. In my opinion, I think it would be more beneficial to spend more time on developing extensions and include D3 charts, and minimise time spent on widgets. I believe there’s real value in being able to deliver custom extension charts that help visualize data differently within a Qlik Application. Overall the course was really good, covers all the core aspects and has provided a good foundation to build on. I would say the course and especially Liam has inspired me to invest more time in learning and building my web skills.\n\n10 / 10\n\nNormunds Silinieks,\n\nQlik Sense Visualisation Extensions\n\nAwesome course. Great content. The instructor is excellent, very helpful and explained complicated things in a simple way. The course material is exactly what I needed. This course is very helpful, and after learning everything from this course I was able to build extension object of my own. I think I have a pretty good foundation now how QlikSense, API and different JavaScript libraries are wired together. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get their feet going with extension objects.\n\n8 / 10\n\nDarrell Butler, University of Glasgow\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - Level 1\n\nReally enjoyed the course, I'd no prior experience of HTML, CSS , JavaScript etc so found this a useful introduction to the languages. I did find the pace on the latter stages of day 1 and day 2 a bit frantic and struggled with some of the activities. In hindsight a bit more prep up front on my behalf may have been advisable. However, what the course did do was highlight the power and possibilities of the Qlikview Capability API's and how we could potentially exploit these.\n\n9 / 10\n\nAaron Couron, Visual Data Group\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - Level 1\n\nThe pacing is perfect and Peter is very good at delivering material. I would feel better if I had the slides as they nicely summarize the content although I understand why you might not want to publish them. It would also be good to have the materials in pdf format so I can search for the lessons I need to review using keywords etc. The content is dead-on appropriate for audience which is the primary advantage of this class for me. We did encounter a few buggy items but nothing that Peter couldn't explain or handle.\n\n8 / 10\n\nPatrick Anderson, Health Catalyst\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - Level 1\n\nI felt like the course moved a little bit slow in the beginning portion. Once we got in to the capabilityAPI it really picked up. I wish we could have got to that sooner, but i do understand the need for the foundational web stuff as well though. Promises are still a bit fuzzy for me as well. Overall though this course was AWESOME and Peter was a great teacher and handled all of our questions in a patient and helpful manner. I feel much less intimidated by the huge library of APIs, like i was when i first saw the QAP and am very excited to start building my own creations!\n\n10 / 10\n\nCheenu Janakiram, Tungsten Network\n\nWeb Development for Qlik Devs - Level 1\n\nThe course was a tremendous eye-opener. The content and pedagogical approach Nick used were critical to being able to absorb the information. From both my experience as a trainer and a trainee in different contexts/technologies, I have often noticed that ease of “skills transfer into the work environment” was typically the Achilles heel of most training courses and one I spent a lot of time and energy as a trainer to prevent. The value of the course Nick delivered actually incorporated this key training element. Following the training, it has been very easy to transfer the skills acquired to my work environment and projects and this is why I view the course and Nick as crucial for any QlikSense developer."
