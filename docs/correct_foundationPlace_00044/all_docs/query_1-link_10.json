Although the technology is still relatively young, the product convinces customers by yielding business benefits and delivering fast pro- ject implementation cycles. Qlik Sense customers see the soluti- on as innovative and give it very good marks in ‘Innovation’ cate- gories such as cloud BI, mobile BI and location intelligence. Customers use the product mainly for ad hoc querying and data analysis, including data modeling and visualization using dashboards. The median number of users in a Qlik Sense environment is 100 – similar to the QlikView median – while the mean figure of 551 shows it is also capable of performing in mid-sized deployments with 500 or more users.

Custo- mers see QlikView as one of the most competitive solutions on the market and the product recei- ves top ranks in all of its peer groups. Results for query and overall performance are especial- ly strong. From its very beginnings Qlik- View has been equipped with in- tegrated in-memory data storage. Over the years Qlik has invested heavily in tuning the system, finally introducing the next gene- ration of its in-memory engine – the QIX engine – in 2015 with the launch of QlikView version 12. In this year’s BI Survey, 85 percent of QlikView customers say they are still using version 11 so any resulting change in performance will not show up in our results until next year.

Introduction THE BI Survey 16 is based on findings from the world‘s largest and most comprehensive survey of business intelligence end users, conducted from February 2016 to May 2016. In total, 3,137 people responded to the sur- vey with 2,611 answering a series of detailed questions about their usage of a named pro- duct. Altogether, 37 products (or groups of products) are analyzed in detail. THE BI Survey 16 examines BI product selec- tion and usage among users in categories (KPIs) including business benefits, project success, business value, recommendation, customer satisfaction, customer experience, innovation and agility. There are 32 KPIs in total. This document contains just a selection of the headline findings for Qlik. It does not show all the KPI results and focuses mainly on the positive findings. For more information on the survey visit our new BI Survey homepage. Qlik overview 5 ©2016 BARC - Business Application Research Center, a CXP Group CompanyQlik in Qlik customer responses This year we had 239 responses from QlikView users. 85 percent of them use version 11 and the remaining 15 percent run version 12. We also received 43 responses from users of Qlik Sense, all of whom are on version 2. Qlik Technology (Qlik) was originally founded in 1993 in Lund, Sweden, and moved its headquar- ters to the United States in 2005 after raising funds from several venture capital firms. In 2010 Qlik went public on NASDAQ. In 2016 Qlik transi- tioned to become a private company. Today, Qlik’s products and innovation are divided into three main strategic areas: Analytics, Data and Cloud. Analytics includes all functionality and capabilities for self-service analytics, guided analytics, custom analytics, and reporting and collaboration. Products such as QlikView, Qlik Sense or Qlik NPrinting can be assigned to this category. Data focuses on the tools and capabi- lities for preparing, integrating and loading data from multiple sources, data connectivity capabi- lities for file based, on premise, cloud, and web sources, and Qlik’s DataMarket product, which allows subscription to third party data sources from within Qlik products. The final area is cloud, which includes the recently released Qlik Sen- se cloud offerings, as well as Qlik in the cloud (hosted, single tenant environments), and cloud based, value added services. Besides that, the vendor provides solutions and best practices apps to deliver blue prints and content for custo- mer projects. QlikView is a dashboard and set-based, ’asso- ciative’ analysis product based on in-memory technology, and was the first product in the “data discovery” product category. It is positioned as a solution for building guided analytic apps targe- ted at business users, enabling them to analyze data without going to an expert for a new report or dashboard. Qlik Sense is positioned as Qlik’s next-generati- on visual analytics platform. It addresses a mix- ture of use cases from self-service data visua- lization to building guided apps to embedded analytics. It is supplied with enterprise features including a central library for common metadata, policy-based security, and open, modern APIs.\n\n7.

The product is mostly used for dashboard creation, basic data analysis and ad hoc query. 58 percent of users use Qlik Sense for standard/enterprise reporting. This may change with version 3, in which printing and layout capabilities have been extended with the NPrinting component, enabling users to create print-oriented reports. Qlik Sense is used by a median of 100 users, the same as the combined average of all products in The BI Survey 16. A much higher mean figure shows that Qlik Sense is also used in larger mid-sized scenarios with over 500 users. Comment\n\n8. 8 ©2016 BARC - Business Application Research Center, a CXP Group CompanyQlik in Peer Groups & KPIs THE BI Survey 16 features a range of different types of BI tools so we use peer groups to help identify competing products. The groups are essential to al- low fair and useful comparisons of products that are likely to compete. The peer groups have been defined by BARC ana- lysts using their experience and judgment, with segmentation based on two key factors: 1. Usage scenario - functional peer groups are mainly data-driven and ba- sed on how customers say they use the product. 2. Regional focus - is the vendor a large international vendor with a truly global presence or does it focus on a particu- lar region. We also take into account the location of BI Survey respondents. Qlik Sense features in the following peer groups: • Large international BI vendors • Self-service reporting-focused products • Visual discovery-focused products Large enterprise BI platforms Includes products equipped with functionality for enterprise deployments that focus on a broad range of BI use cases. Dashboarding-focused products Includes products that focus on creating advanced and highly sophisticated dashboards. Self-service reporting-focused products Includes products that focus on self-service reporting and ad hoc analysis. OLAP analysis-focused products Includes products that focus on analysis in dimensio- nal and hierarchical data models. Visual data discovery-focused products Includes products that focus on visual data discovery and advanced data visualization. Integrated performance management products Includes products that provide integrated functiona- lity for BI and performance management, especially planning and budgeting. Large international BI vendors Includes products from companies with annual re- venues of $200m+ and a truly international reach. EMEA-focused vendors Includes products from vendors that have a signifi- cant presence in - and focus on - the EMEA region. Americas-focused vendors Includes products from vendors that have a signifi- cant presence in - and focus on - the Americas region. THE BI Survey 16 provides the reader with well-de- signed KPI dashboards packed with concise infor- mation, which can be absorbed at a glance. The KPIs all follow these simple rules: • Only measures that have a clear good/ bad trend are used as the basis for KPIs. • KPIs may be based on one or more measures from THE BI Survey. • Only products with samples of at least 20 - 30 (depending on the KPI) for each of the questions that feeds into the KPI are included. • For quantitative data, KPIs are conver- ted to a scale of 1 to 10 (worst to best). • A linear min-max transformation is ap- plied, which preserves the order of, and the relative distance between, pro- ducts‘ scores. The terms ‘top-ranked’ and ‘leader’ are used in the following KPI chart titles. ‘Top-ranked’ indicates first position. ‘Leader’ usually denotes a position in the top 20-25% of products listed in the chart. Peer Group Classification Peer Groups Overview The KPIs\n\n9. Report The business benefits KPI is based on the achievement level of a variety of business benefits. The price-to-value KPI is based on how users rate their BI tool in terms of price-to-value. Business benefits & price-to-value perception\n\n10. 10 ©2016 BARC - Business Application Research Center, a CXP Group CompanyQlik in Qlik Sense is the second highest rated product in the large international BI vendors peer group for price-to-value perception. In contrast to QlikView, Qlik Sense is offered to customers with a simplified so-called token-based license concept. This is a flexible option, which makes it possible to buy both named user licenses or to use one token for several users where licensing is restricted by sessions or time. The product is also available as a cloud version with subscription-based pricing. Customer feedback indi- cates that Qlik Sense buyers are satisfied with the price they pay and the value they receive. Viewpoint Qlik Sense is highly rated in terms of providing business benefits to custo- mers compared to other large international BI vendors. Through its inter- active drag-and-drop UI for content creation, Qlik Sense convinces casual business users they can use it for dashboard and analysis creation. For power users with some technical knowledge, the product offers a script- ing environment for performing “light” ETL tasks to integrate and transform data. User-friendly products and UIs are crucial for acceptance in business departments, helping business users to analyze and understand their data.

Project success\n\n12. 12 ©2016 BARC - Business Application Research Center, a CXP Group CompanyQlik in Qlik Sense is the top-ranked large international BI vendor and one of the leading visual disco- very-focused products for project success. In general the software is very ad hoc oriented and supports the creation of dashboards and visualizations via drag-and-drop. Existing Qlik- View customers in particular may well decide that Qlik Sense offers better potential for at- tracting new users from business departments, who are seeking a more ad hoc oriented so- lution.

Qlik Sense ranks among the leading tools for location intelligence in the large international BI vendors peer group. The product supports mapping with MapBox or by pasting a URL from a web map ser- vice such as OpenStreetMap. Point maps and choropleths can be used. Several Qlik partners also provide geo solutions with broader capabilities, and some support map layers to visualize more information on maps. Viewpoint In the area of mobile usage, Qlik ranks in second place among the large in- ternational BI vendors. Qlik Sense was built with a strategy of providing one client and development environment for different output formats. Visualiz- ations and dashboards developed with the Qlik Sense client are available on mobile devices, the Web and desktop PCs as soon as they have been created. This has been achieved using HTML5, which is now the standard industry technology for providing both a Web and mobile client at the same time.

Existing Qlik customers - as well as other companies searching for a self-service data discovery and visualization solution - tend to evaluate Qlik Sense. This high ranking is very impressive considering the pro- duct is still so young. Qlik Sense’s features and appearance seem to convince users to take a closer look. Data from The BI Survey 16 shows that - in most cases - the product competes well with its older sibling QlikView. Viewpoint Qlik Sense ranks as one of the leading innovative products in the self-service reporting-focused products peer group. It was built using up-to-date technolo- gy and created as a cloud-ready solution to be used on various devices with a focus on providing an intuitive UI so users would require a minimum of training. Qlik also opened its APIs, which can be used by partners and other developers, so the solution can be extended with additional features or modules, or used in modern BI usage scenarios such as embedded BI.

Qlik Sense may not be the most feature-rich product, but it seems to be well-conceived and less buggy than competing products from other large BI vendors. Viewpoint Qlik has always been one of the leading vendors in providing good support. The company has grown from a small Swedish one-product company into a large international enterprise with a range of different products based on one central engine.

Customers give Qlik Sense a leading ranking among the large international BI vendors for quick product implementation. Besides its ad hoc focus, another factor here is that existing QlikView customers have a head start when implementing Qlik Sense because they can reuse the data models created in QlikView. The data management phase of a BI project - including data integration, data transforma- tion and modeling - typically represents 70 to 80 percent of the total project ef- fort, so it is logical that Qlik Sense might appeal to existing QlikView accounts. Viewpoint Qlik Sense achieves a good rating for ‘Recommendation’ compared to other large international BI vendors, an impressive feat considering it is so much less mature than many of the products it beats here, including QlikView. Positive customer feedback in areas such as project success, project length and the general level of satisfaction with Qlik Sense, as well as strong ratings for inno- vation, lead customers to the conclusion that they are likely to recommend the solution to others.

Peer Group Classification Peer Groups Overview The KPIs 45 ©2016 BARC - Business Application Research Center, a CXP Group CompanyQlik in THE BI Survey 16 features a range of different types of BI tools so we use peer groups to help identify competing products. The groups are essential to al- low fair and useful comparisons of products that are likely to compete. The peer groups have been defined by BARC ana- lysts using their experience and judgment, with segmentation based on two key factors: 1. Usage scenario - functional peer groups are mainly data-driven and ba- sed on how customers say they use the product. 2. Regional focus - is the vendor a large international vendor with a truly global presence or does it focus on a particu- lar region. We also take into account the location of BI Survey respondents. QlikView features in the following peer groups: • Large international BI vendors • Dashboarding-focused products • Visual discovery-focused products THE BI Survey 16 provides the reader with well-de- signed KPI dashboards packed with concise infor- mation, which can be absorbed at a glance. The KPIs all follow these simple rules: • Only measures that have a clear good/ bad trend are used as the basis for KPIs. • KPIs may be based on one or more measures from THE BI Survey. • Only products with samples of at least 20 - 30 (depending on the KPI) for each of the questions that feeds into the KPI are included. • For quantitative data, KPIs are conver- ted to a scale of 1 to 10 (worst to best). • A linear min-max transformation is ap- plied, which preserves the order of, and the relative distance between, pro- ducts‘ scores. The terms ‘top-ranked’ and ‘leader’ are used in the following KPI chart titles. ‘Top-ranked’ indicates first position. ‘Leader’ usually denotes a position in the top 20-25% of products listed in the chart.\n\n46.

QlikView’s ranking has impro- ved in this KPI over recent years. The product has always used a proprietary associative en- gine, which processes data in-memory. With its redesigned in-memory engine - now known as QIX – Qlik’s capacity for handling large data volumes could improve further in the coming years. Since QlikView 12, both Qlik Sense and QlikView have used the QIX engine. As only 15 percent of respondents to this survey have upgraded to version 12 so far, its impact on QlikView’s results in The BI Survey 16 is mini- mal.
