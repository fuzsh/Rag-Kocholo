The command line version of COPASI is CopasiSE, which you can install besides the GUI CopasiUI via any source here http://copasi.org/Download/.

For example, see https://github.com/ICB-DCM/solverstudy/blob/master/Bash_Scripts/install_copasi.sh, in which case the executable resides in a local folder.
