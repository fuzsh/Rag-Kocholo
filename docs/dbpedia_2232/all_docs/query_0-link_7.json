Version 3.30 should be the final release (barring discovery of some serious bug in this version).\n\n... and the dawn of a new one\n\nStarting in 2000 we started working with the Kummer group in Heidelberg on a successor for Gepasi, named COPASI. This software has been available since 2004 and is now one of the most used software applications for modelling in systems biology. You should now be using COPASI instead of Gepasi.\n\nCOPASI has the following advantages over Gepasi:\n\nRuns on most used operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.\n\nCapable of carrying out stochastic integrations using a series of different algorithms, including the famous Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm.\n\nSimulations can have discrete events.\n\nDraws diagrams of the reaction network, and can use them to display results.\n\nCalculates Lyapunov exponents, cross-sections, and can do time-scale separation analysis.\n\nCalculates generic sensitivity coefficients (beyond MCA analysis).\n\nAnalyses stochastic steady state properties using the linear noise approximation.\n\nReads Gepasi files (backwards compatibility)."
