        "text": "Dear all,\n\nI am attempting to install Copasi on a Ubuntu virtual machine. This is my attempt at figuring out how to install and use Copasi on Ubuntu before I update the Copasi software version on our cluster (we're currently running Copasi 89). I have:\n\n1) downloaded and unzipped the Copasi installation files (to the directory '/home/cw00137/Desktop/COPASI-4.15.95-Linux-64bit')\n\n2) Added an environment variable called COPASIDIR using the command 'export COPASIDIR=/home/cw00137/Desktop/COPASI-4.15.95-Linux-64bit'\n\nProblems:\n\n1) The CopasiUI file in the ./bin directory of the copasi installation files gets opened by default in a text editor. In order to get CopasiUI to actually run I need to first make it executable using the command 'chmod +x CopasiUI' and then run this using './CopasiUI'. I am however aware that it is possible to set it up so that CopasiUI will open using the command 'CopasiUI' (or 'CopasiSE Copasi_filename.cps'), since this is how it currently works on the cluster with build 89. Does anybody know how to set this up?\n\nAdditionally, if anybody has any advice on installing Copasi on a cluster it'd be greatly appreciated. I'm told it may be possible to use a script from the 'central node' using a repository but this is all the information I have.\n\nThanks\n\nCiaran"
