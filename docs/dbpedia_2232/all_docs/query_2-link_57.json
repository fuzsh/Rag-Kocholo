        "text": "Objective\n\nA senior full-time or consulting position focused on software architecture design, application development and/or database administration.\n\nProfessional Experience\n\nConfidential, Since Dec 2001\n\nResearch Associate (faculty rank) Blacksburg, VA\n\nDeveloped an application using a C/C++ based multiplatform toolkit known as Qt for a popular numerical simulation scientific software named COPASI.\n\nUsed design patterns such as Model-View-Controller to implement Widgets in Qt.\n\nConverted widget classes in Qt from single-threaded to being able to operate from a new thread.\n\nDesigned and developed a network component, which allows communicationusing simple APIs between a C++ server and a Java client or vice-versa using raw sockets.\n\nComponent is thread safe and designed to work for any unix machine (Big or Little Endian).\n\nDeveloped another software called 'DOME' for the NSF funded project (details below), from its inception to its completion (4 years).\n\nUsed complex query constructs to access a PostgreSQL databasefrom php scripts.\n\nImplemented with good effect, following database concepts/objects: triggers, transactions, indexes, views, schemas, PL/SQL code.\n\nTuned/Optimized complex SQL queries.\n\nDeveloped two more systems in php named 'BNet' and 'CurationTracking' to assist in database access and its curation respectively.\n\nHelped design and administered PostgreSQL database for these three projects.\n\nDid backups/restore of various PostgreSQL databases for these projects.\n\nWrote perl scripts which read an XML file, extracted the data from the file and wrote it to a database (used SAX model for parsing XML).\n\nAll projects at this workplace use CVS as the code repository.\n\nWorking knowledge of ETL tool Informatica.\n\nSupervised a number of graduate students.\n\nConfidential, Aug 2000 - Dec 2000\n\nAssociate Consultant Mumbai, India\n\n(An SEI-CMM Level 5 Company and a Citigroup Subsidiary)\n\nWorked on Equity Desk Trade System, a highly customizable XMotif based system designed for Solomon Smith Barney to trade stocks at any market in the world, from any place, at any time.\n\nWork required knowledge of makefiles, sockets, shared memory, mutexes, semaphores, CVS, etc.\n\nWrote Unix shell-scripts and system utilities in C.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nMaster of Science, Computer Science & Applications\n\nBachelor of Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications\n\nComputing Skills\n\nLanguages : Qt , C/C++, Visual C++, Java, Perl, Visual Basic, Scheme, Prolog.\n\nDatabases : PostgresSQL, Oracle, Sybase, MS Access, PL/SQL.\n\nInternet : php, javascript, HTML/CSS, XML, RDF, Java Servlets.\n\nOperating Systems : Windows NT/ XP/2000/9X, Solaris, Linux.\n\nOthers : CVS, CGI, OOPS, UML,XMotif, TOAD, Informatica, Visual Studio.\n\nProjects Undertaken\n\nProjects at Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech: Multiplatform software called COPASI using a C/C++ Development kit called Qt\n\nQt is a toolkit, which allows a (C/C++) program to run on different platforms (Windows, different unix platfroms, Mac) without any changes to the programmer code or sacrificing any speed since the application is in compiled code (rather than bytecodes).\n\nImplemented Widgets in Qt using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.\n\nConverted some of the existing widget classes in this application from single-threaded architecture to multi-threaded architecture enabling them to operate from different \"worker\" and \"UI\" threads.\n\nWriting this multi-threaded code required implementation of concepts such as thread synchronization and mutexes.\n\nConverted object oriented code and widgets from Qt version 3 to Qt version 4.\n\nNetwork Component for Client-Server Implementation of COPASI - (C++ and Java)\n\nDeveloped a multithreaded network component using raw sockets, which allows communication using simple APIs between a C++ server and a Java client (or any combination of the type of client and server).\n\nThis component may be thought of as a small CORBA component, which supports only C++ and Java without the overhead of an Object Request Broker (ORB).\n\nBioinformatics Research on Medicago truncatula, NSF Funded Project, $3.6M - (php with PostgreSQL on Solaris)\n\nData from experiments conducted on a model plant legume named Medicago truncatula is put in a relational database.\n\nThe data is enormous and has to be viewed in manageable proportions.\n\nHence worked on optimizing queries written at the Front-End to retrieve data in fastest possible way from a server with a processor slower than a modern desktop machine.\n\nWrote the software in php which allows data selection as well as a number of algorithms to be run on the selected data.\n\nWritten scripts to mirror data between two copies of the same database at different physical locations.\n\nWas also the Database Administrator for this Postgres database.\n\nSupervised graduate students related to this software.\n\nMasters Projects at Virginia Tech:\n\nOnline virtual collaborative symposium / classroom\n\n(Technologies: Java, Swing, RMI/Sockets and some XML)\n\nA distance learning software, which allows the instructor and students to communicate using blackboard, online documents, voice and text chatting.\n\nStock Bidding System using Java Swing and JavaSpacesTM\n\nDesign and implementation of distributed buyer & seller stock trading system using Tuple Space concept.\n\nTuple Space-based communication has the advantage over the traditional Client-Server architecture that:\n\nit does not require that a sender must know the receiver\\'s location and\n\nboth sender and receiver may not be available at the same time.\n\nSimple Relational Database Management System - (Language: Scheme)\n\nSystem implemented a collection of seven functions - 1. Selection, 2. Projection, 3. Join, 4. Union, 5. Intersection, 6. Difference and 7. Printing a table.\n\nSimple Web-Server implementation (Tools: Java)\n\nA system that responds to HTTP GET requests and serves files on port 80.\n\nReasearch Study: Learning and Retention in Data Structures: A Comparison of Visualization, Text, and Combined Methods [Publication 1]\n\nConducted a research study through an experiment that compares three methods for learning data structures: (1) text material, (2) animated data-structure visualization, and (3) guided tutorial-style visualization.\n\nAround 60 undergraduate subjects were given 15 minutes to learn the AVL Tree data structure using one of these methods\n\nThis was followed by a short quiz and survey and the results were analyzed using statistical methods.\n\nOther Projects: Image Reconstruction by using Digital Image Processing (Language: C)\n\nProject involved reconstruction of an image from data obtained from a device such as C.T. Scanner. Convolution Back Projection method was used in the reconstruction of the image.\n\nAdmission System for a School"
