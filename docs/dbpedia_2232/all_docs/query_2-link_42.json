        "text": "We provide several types of downloadable materials for the BioCyc databases and Pathway Tools software.\n\nAccess to the BioCyc.org website and to BioCyc data files requires a paid BioCyc subscription for all users, obtained from SRI. Access to BioCyc also requires that you create a free account after a certain number of page views, even if you are a subscriber.\n\nAccess to the Pathway Tools software by academic users requires a free license (see table at bottom of this page). For access by commercial users, a fee is required (see table at bottom of this page).\n\nA comparison of BioCyc.org versus Pathway Tools is provided here.\n\nDownload BioCyc Data Files\n\n[Access to BioCyc data files requires (1) a license (see bottom of page), and (2) a paid BioCyc subscription (exceptions: access to the EcoCyc data files is free, although a license is required).]\n\nThe BioCyc web-based SmartTables facility can save you significant time in answering large-scale data analysis questions, and is significantly easier to use than downloading and parsing BioCyc files. See the SmartTables menu at BioCyc.org.\n\nWe provide the BioCyc databases (such as EcoCyc and MetaCyc) as collections of data files in several alternative formats including the following.\n\nBioPAX format\n\nPathway Tools attribute-value format\n\nPathway Tools tabular format\n\nSBML format\n\nGene Ontology annotations (EcoCyc only): [Download from GO Web site]\n\nClick here for an exact listing of files provided and their formats. Note that these files are not in a format suitable for importing into the Pathway Tools software.\n\nDownload Pathway Tools Software/Database Bundle\n\n[Access to Pathway Tools requires a license (see bottom of page) and is freely available to academic users and available for a fee to commercial users. Use of Pathway Tools with subscription-only BioCyc databases, whether obtained via the registry or via pre-built bundles, requires a paid BioCyc institutional subscription for all users. ]\n\nThe software/database bundle is a program you install on your computer (Mac, PC, Linux) that combines the Pathway Tools software with various pre-built sets of BioCyc databases. To use Pathway Tools with other PGDBs than the pre-built bundles we provide, you should download the bundle that is closest to your needs, and then download additional PGDBs from the PGDB registry using the command Browse PGDB Registry from the Tools menu. Pathway Tools functionality includes:\n\nCreate new BioCyc-like DBs for sequenced organisms, predicting their metabolic reactions and pathways\n\nCreate steady-state metabolic flux models from those DBs\n\nQuery and visualize BioCyc DBs\n\nRuns in two modes: as a desktop application (Mac, Windows, and Linux), and as a Web server (Mac and Linux). The desktop mode runs faster and has more functionality. Web mode allows you to run a Web server similar to BioCyc.org.\n\nAnalyze omics data (such as gene expression or metabolomics data) via enrichment analysis and by painting data onto a full pathway map for an organism, onto the full genome, and onto the Omics Dashboard.\n\nProgrammatic Access to BioCyc Data\n\n[Access to BioCyc data via APIs requires a paid BioCyc subscription (access to the EcoCyc data is free).]\n\nWe provide several APIs for accessing BioCyc data:\n\nThe BioCyc Web Services interface.\n\nPython, Perl, Java, R, and Lisp APIs [details]. These options require local installation of the Pathway Tools software bundled with various BioCyc DBs.\n\nThe BioVelo query language.\n\nThe advanced query interface via the Web menu command Search â†’ Advanced.\n\nHow to Obtain Downloads\n\nA paid subscription is required to access the BioCyc.org website and data files.\n\nPathway Tools and BioCyc databases are available through different license agreements; please choose the license below that is best suited to your needs."
