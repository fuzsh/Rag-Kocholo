        "text": "Melanie Stefan\n\nunread,\n\nto COPASI User Forum\n\nHi all,\n\ntl;dr: I tried installing Copasi on Manjaro Linux, it didn't work at first, but then it did, so I am sharing what I did for anyone else who may find themselves in the same situation.\n\nFull story:\n\n- I am running Manjaro Linux 21.3.6, downloaded the installer for Copasi 4.36 (Build 260) for 64-bit Linux. The installation ran without any obvious problems.\n\n- BUT navigating to the relevant directory and typing\n\n./CopasiUI\n\ngives the following error message:\n\nThis application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\"\n\nin \"<path_to_copasi_dir>/share/copasi/lib/plugins\"\n\nAvailable platform plugins are: xcb.\n\nReinstalling the application may fix this problem.\n\n- (Narrator: Reinstalling the application did not fix this problem).\n\n- But after a bit of searching around I found (here: https://forum.manjaro.org/t/undefined-symbol-ft-done-mm-var/36461) that this may work:\n\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libfreetype.so ./CopasiUI\n\n- And this did work! You can make this part of an alias in your .bashrc or .zshrc or wherever you do this kind of stuff.\n\nalias CopasiUI='LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libfreetype.so <path_to_CopasiUI>'\n\n(I don't understand this well enough to explain. It has to do with telling the system where it should look for libraries first (?), but honestly I don't know. I just spent the day googling and trying random things like a monkey with a keyboard. And am hoping this post will save someone else some time.)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nMelanie"
