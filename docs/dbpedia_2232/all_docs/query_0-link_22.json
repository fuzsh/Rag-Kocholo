Python, R and Octave are also available.\n\nNSG provides a simple web-based interface that makes it quick and easy to create an account, upload model code, run simulations, and get back results.\n\nOpen Science Community Driven Neuroscience Computing Platforms:\n\nNeuroDebian provides a large collection of popular neuroscience research software for the Debian operating system as well as Ubuntu and other derivatives.\n\nNeuroFedora is an initiative to provide a ready to use Fedora based Free/Open source software platform for neuroscience."
