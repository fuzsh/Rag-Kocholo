Most importantly, JupyterLab has full support for Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, JupyterLab enables you to use text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other custom components side by side with notebooks in a tabbed work area.\n\nLaunch Jupyter Lab Jupyter Lab page\n\nLaunch a Jupyter Notebook Jupyter Notebook page\n\nCOPASI is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using ODEs or Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations.\n\nCOPASI carries out several analyses of the network and its dynamics and has extensive support for parameter estimation and optimization. COPASI provides means to visualize data in customizable plots, histograms and animations of network diagrams.\n\nLaunch Copasi Copasi page\n\nMesquite is modular, extendible software for evolutionary biology, designed to help biologists organize and analyze comparative data about organisms. Its emphasis is on phylogenetic analysis, but some of its modules concern population genetics, while others do non-phylogenetic multivariate analysis. Because it is modular, the analyses available depend on the modules installed.\n\nMesquite also has many features for managing and processing data, including processing of chromatograms, sequence alignment, editing of morphometric data, and others.\n\nLaunch Mesquite Mesquite page\n\nPPLANE is a tool for phase plane analysis of a system of differential equations with 2 state variables. Users can select from a verity of numerical solvers, and control the parameters of those solvers. Solutions can be viewed in three dimensions. PPLANE also graphs the linearization about equilibrium points, displays eigenvalues, eigenvectors, nullclines, and stable & unstable orbits.\n\nLaunch PPLANE PPLANE page"
