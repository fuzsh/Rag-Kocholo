        "text": "Version 4.5 (Build 30)\n\nRelease Date: April 14, 2009\n\nNew Features since COPASI 4.4 (Build 26)\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nMIRIAM compliant annotation for the model, species, compartments, reactions, global quantities, and kinetic functions. For details about this new feature please see the technical documentation for MIRIAM Annotation.\n\nAdded time scale separation task.\n\nThe correct number of substrates and products is only enforced for kinetic functions which are classified as being reversible or irreversible. This means the list of valid functions shows now all functions which are classified as unrestricted.\n\nCOPASI can display graphical layouts of the reaction network. It is able to overlay simulation results of time courses onto them. Layouts can be imported through SBML files which contain them in the SBML layout extension format. The COPASI file format preserves this layout information.\n\nAdded information to the to the Time Course task displaying the integration and output interval.\n\nAdded 3D bar chart display to all color coded matrices.\n\nEnhanced the object selection dialog to support selecting individual matrix elements.\n\nCOPASI is now able to exchange SBML models with the Systems Biology Workbench. The exchange of models works in both directions.\n\nThe initial time for autonomous models is set and kept at 0. Autonomous models are models which do not depend explicitly on time, i.e., time does not appear in any rate law, ODE, or assignment.\n\nThe COPASI specific file dialog has been replaced with the standard dialog of the operating system COPASI is running on.\n\nIt is now possible to save plots as well as the main widget in the png graphic format. This feature provides an additional way to preserve the results.\n\nIt is now possible to hide or show all curves within one plot by clicking a single button.\n\nThe results for the optimization task now feature an update button which allows the user to modify the model.\n\nAdded save button to the result of the elementary flux mode task.\n\nAdded save button to the parameter overview.\n\nLocal reaction parameters can now be selected in mathematical expressions for initial assignments, assignments, and ODEs.\n\nCOPASI supports now dimensionless units.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nAdded time scale separation analysis.\n\nWe added the capability to use matrix elements in mathematical formulas. This enables e.g. optimization of control coefficients.\n\nScans of optimizations and parameter estimation calculations are now possible.\n\nSBML\n\nCOPASI imports the invalid RDF/XML used in SBML Level 2 Versions 2-3. The SBML Level 2 Version 4 specification resolves this issue but is not yet supported by COPASI.\n\nMIRIAM annotation is now exported to SBML as valid RDF in the COPASI name space in the annotation element and as invalid RDF/XML required in SBML Level 2 Versions 2-3.\n\nBug Fixes since COPASI 4.4.29 (development)\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nMissing reaction rates have been added to the simple selection widget.\n\nFixed crash occasionally occurring under Windows when changing the modifier of a reaction.\n\nFixed occasional crash in the sensitivities task.\n\nFixed crash when an invalid MCA subtask was specified for the optimization task.\n\nEscape characters such as %3A arenow properly decoded in the display of MIRIAM annotation.\n\nA problem in the display of the MIRIAM resource urn:miriam:sgd and urn:miriam:sgd.pathways has been corrected.\n\nFixed occasional crash in the dialog defining the experimental data for the parameter estimation task.\n\nInitial values are now updated correctly when they depend on matrix elements (e.g. from the stoichiometry matrix).\n\nAdded missing and corrected incorrect units in all appropriate places in the GUI.\n\nCorrected minor problems in the Latex export feature.\n\nFixed crash caused when displaying a layout caused by some OpenGL library incompatibilities under Linux.\n\nFixed missing confirmation dialog when a compartment was depending on the object to be deleted.\n\nFixed problem in the report definition that ignored other changes if the name was modified simultaneously.\n\nFixed crash when starting an SBW application failed due to a firewall blocking the communication under Windows.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nFixed load failure caused by files containing layouts with incomplete information.\n\nSBML\n\nCorrected export of the MIRIAM information of the model history if non is present.\n\nFixed crash during SBML export occasionally occurring when a previous load of a COPASI file failed."
