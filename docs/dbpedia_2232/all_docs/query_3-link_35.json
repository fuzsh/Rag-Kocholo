        "text": "Enabled setting event assignment_target to model properties such as ‘Time’.\n\nThis can be useful e.g. for stopping timecourses after an event, like the runaway accumulation of a model species, which could trigger an error for stochastic simulation due to ‘Internal step limit exceeded’. Such an event can be created like so:\n\nnewEvent(name = \"abort\", trigger_expression = \"{Prey.ParticleNumber} > 1e5\", assignment_target = \"Time\", assignment_expression = 1e9).\n\nFixed a regression where NaN in experimental data was lost and converted to NA.\n\nIt is now correctly exported to the ‘.txt’ experimental data. This matters because COPASI handles NaN differently than NA.\n\nImplemented the download of COPASI platform specific libraries during package installation.\n\nThis makes getCopasi() obsolete. The function has been deprecated.\n\nPackage installation now requires an internet connection by default, which can be circumvented by providing the correct libraries locally with the COPASI_LIB_PATH environment variable. One option to set this variable is with the configure.vars argument of install.packages().\n\nFixed a major issue with addExperiments(), where some experimental data was lost or misassigned.\n\naddExperiments() is also used by runParameterEstimation() and setParameterEstimationSettings()."
