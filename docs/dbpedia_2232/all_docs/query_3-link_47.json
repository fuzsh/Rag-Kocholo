Now COPASI clearly indicates that no steady state was found.\n\nCOPASI now only requires a single environment variable (COPASIDIR) on all platforms.\n\nCOPASI was allowing several object browser windows to open simultaneously. Only one object browser window can be open at any single time.\n\nIn some rare conditions an object could be created in duplicate (eg by trying to save as, canceling and only then comiting a new object.\n\nIf an object was used in more than one plot, COPASI could plot the wrong curve.\n\nIf COPASI was called on the command line with a file name as argument, when that file would not exist, COPASI would crash.\n\nThe steady state widget would not commit changes when the user left the widget."
