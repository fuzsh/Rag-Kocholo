        "text": "Abstract. With the sequence of many genomes now available the major challenge of functional genomics is' reassembling the pieces'. One functional view of a living system is as a chemical reaction network, and new genomics technologies like RNA and protein profiling are providing ways to measure the state of these networks. The goal here is being able to simulate an arbitrary ensemble of hypothesized biochemical and genetic regulatory networks to predict what a cell is doing, ie.\n\nAs the scope and complexity of bioinformatic research widens, the need for a practical simulator for biochemical systems has grown considerably. The influx of experimental data begs the need for analytical tools; however, current implementations exhibit limitations with user-interactivity. We present CASS (Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator), an analytical modeling tool with a focus on a clean user-interface and malleable terms. Through adaptations of the Gillespie algorithm, our program accepts a broad range of user-specific input and simulates network interactions across time according to chemical propensity functions. CASS offers users a layout of parameter and plotting preferences in order to maximize compatibility for experimental models. This versatile tool shows promise for applications across the board in small-scale research."
