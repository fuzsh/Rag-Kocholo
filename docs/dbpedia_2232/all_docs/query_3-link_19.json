The software package has a GUI that lets users define biochemical network models by entering chemical reactions and kinetic equations. A powerful simulation engine can then perform simulations of the dynamics of the networks and carry out many different computational analyses. COPASI can simulate dynamics using either an ODE approach or a stochastic chemical kinetics approach (Gillespie-type algorithms).License: Free for non-commercial useChanges:\n\nBugfixes.\n\nMore..."
