        "text": "Linux Installation for COPASI 4.31 and newer\n\nAs of version 4.31 we do provide a self extracting script for installations of COPASI. This script either automatically extracts the COPASI files (if the -e option is given). Or COPASI will be installed into the given directory, and a .desktop file will be created and registered (so that you can directly start the COPASI GUI from your window manager).\n\nDownload the installer from the Download page (it will be named something like COPASI-*-Linux-64bit.sh).\n\nMake the file executable: chmod +x COPASI-*-Linux-64bit.sh\n\nRun the installer: ./COPASI-*-Linux-64bit.sh. At this point the the installation script will ask where to extract files temporarily to (defaults to /tmp), where the files should be installed to (defaults to /opt/COPASI/{version}/), and where or whether to install a .desktop file.\n\nLinux Installation for older COPASI versions\n\nDownload the Linux (recommended) installation package.\n\nExpand the contents of the tarball into a directory of choice with tar -xzvf COPASI-*-Linux-*bit.tar.gz.\n\nCopasiUI is a dynamically linked executables, and has no library dependencies except the glibc shared library, CopasiSE has no library dependencies.\n\nOptionally, add the environment variable COPASIDIR to your start up script. The value must be the absolute path for the directory \"copasi\" created during extraction.\n\nLinux Alternative Installation\n\nDownload the Linux (all static) installation package.\n\nExpand the contents of the tarball into a directory of choice with tar -xzvf COPASI-*-Linux-*bit.tar.gz.\n\nCopasiUI and CopasiSE are the executables, and have no library dependencies except that they need glibc version 2.3.6 (it may not run well with older versions.)\n\nOptionally, add the environment variable COPASIDIR to your start up script. The value must be the absolute path for the directory \"copasi\" created during extraction.\n\nPlease note, you will have to replace the* above with the build number of your package."
