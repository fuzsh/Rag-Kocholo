However the installation needs to be able to write files somewhere in the system, so you need to have writing rights in the installation directory.\n\nJC-MSMB can be installed in any directory where writing rights are granted (e.g., the local 'User' directory, 'Desktop', etc.). A default directory is chosen by the installer (e.g., 'Program Files' for a Windows system) but the user can easily select a different directory using the 'Browse' button and proceed with the installation in a different directory.\n\nNotes to start JC-MSMB:\n\nfor Window users: double click on the JCMSMB.jar file.\n\nfor Mac users: double click on the JCMSMB_launcher.command file\n\nfor Linux users: double click on the JCMSMB_launcher.sh file\n\nSource code of JC-MSMB (includes JC-RM extension): available from GitHub\n\nIf you have any trouble with the installer or compiling the source code, please send an email to alida [dot] palmisano [at] gmail [dot] com"
