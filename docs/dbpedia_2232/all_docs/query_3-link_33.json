        "text": "The ENteric Immunity Simulator (ENISI) is a simulator of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract mucosal immune responses created for generating and testing hypothesis of mechanisms of immune regulation in response to the presence of resident commensal or pathogenic bacteria. ENISI is an implementation of an agent-based model of individual mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue immune cells each endowed with a program for trafficking and differentiation according to their intrinsic properties, i.e. epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, and natural regulatory T cells (Treg). The internal programs specify movement among the epithelium, lamina propria, and blood in response to inflammation-inducing pathogens and tolerance-inducing commensal bacteria. The model focuses on the antagonistic relationship between inflammatory and regulatory (anti-inflammatory) factors whose constant presence characterize mucosal tissue sites in general and gut mucosa in particular.\n\nIn its current stage, ENISI is capable of testing hypotheses to predict the net immune response to a pathogen given the complex interplay between both regulatory and inflammatory pathways. In addition, ENISI can be used to identify aspects of competing immune pathways that could likely be manipulated, through pharmacological intervention for instance, to inhibit pathogen invasion, infection, and evolution.\n\nAccurately predicting these outcomes in specific individual backgrounds sets the stage for modeling determinants of a successful infection (host susceptibility), the capacity of the host as an infectious carrier, and pathogen phenotype selection. These are all relevant to devising effective therapeutic approaches that intervene in microbial infection cycles and pathogenic functions.\n\nThrough user-manipulation of cell type-specific programs, ENISI allows one to observe the effects of phenotypic changes in individual cell-types, observed in vitro, at the tissue level. As such, it is a translational research tool that allows researcher to:\n\nTest plausibility of in vitro observed behavior as explanations for observations in vivo in situ,\n\nPropose behaviors not yet tested in vitro that could be plausible explanations for observations at the tissue level.\n\nConduct low-cost, preliminary experiments of proposed interventions/ treatments.\n\nIndicate useful areas of research through identification of missing data necessary to address a specific hypothesis.\n\nPerform in silico experiments that help define the best experimental design for successful immunological outcomes.\n\nThe tool currently captures dynamics of four possible outcomes in response to pathogen exposure in the presence of tolerance-inducing microflora:\n\nComplete tolerance that leads to ongoing pathogenic microbe persistence.\n\nHypo-inflammation in which a pathogen is not completely eliminated and persists chronically in the host.\n\nInflammation that eliminates the microbe, but it ceases prior to extensive tissue damage.\n\nHyper-inflammation in which the microbe is eliminated, but at expense of host tissue damage.\n\nThe ENteric Immunity Simulator (ENISI) Visual, developed by the Center for Modeling Immunity to Enteric Pathogens (MIEP), is the first agent-based simulator for modeling and simulating gastrointestinal (GI) infections caused by immune responses to invading microbe. It is built upon Repast Symphony, an open source agent-based modeling and simulation platform. Also, it is implemented in Java language and is highly portable. We have successfully run ENISI Visual simulations on Windows, MAC, and Linux machines.\n\nENISI Visual provides quality visualizations for simulating gut immunity to enteric pathogens and is capable of simulating gut immunity, including pathogen invasion, pro-inflammatory immune responses, pathogen elimination, regulatory immune responses, and restoring homeostasis. Users can build their own models using it. ENISI Visual provides rich graphic user interfaces. Users can control initial cell concentrations, simulation speed, data and graphic outputs. Users can take snapshots and record videos of the simulations. ENISI Visual also simulates the secreting and diffusing of cytokines and chemokines. Each grid has a value indicating the concentrations of cytokines or chemokine and the background colors of grids changes as the values change. The visualizations can help modelers to test verify, and tune their models. The visualizations can also help immunologists to test novel hypotheses and design their biological experiments accordingly.\n\nENISI Visual has five compartments: lumen, epithelium, lamina propria, draining lymph nodes, and blood. The left figure shows three compartments: lumen is on its left side; Epithelium is the middle vertical layer; and Lamina Propria is on the right side. The gastric lymph node and blood are not shown in the visualization. Both compartments can provide immune cells during immune responses. The recruitment of immune cells is represented by the influx of immune cells from the right side of Lamina Propria.\n\nIn immune responses to pathogen invasions, the immune cells release cytokines and chemokine that are important for cell-cell communications, cell signaling, and cell movement. ENISI Visual uses a single value layer of REPAST Symphony to represent both cytokines and chemokines since they are usually secreted in parallel. We use background colors to represent the cytokine or chemokine gradient. In contacting with pathogenic bacteria, the epithelial cells become pro-inflammatory and release cytokines and chemokines. The cytokines and chemokines diffuse inside the Lamina Propria and form the gradient. Each cell has different states or phenotypes. In each simulation cycle or step, each cell checks its neighbors and its environment and determines whether it keeps its state or changes to another state. Different cell types are represented by different logos and the logos change colors when the cells change cell types. ENISI Visual has two types of movement models: random and chemotactic. Random movements are directionless and chemotactic movements follow the chemokine gradient. The movement speed is controllable and configurable.\n\nIn the following example, we developed a model using ENISI Visual. We target this model for gut immune responses to invasions of gastroenteric pathogens. This model shows how the inflammatory immune responses remove the pathogens, how the lesions are forming, and how regulatory immune responses restore the intestinal homeostasis.\n\nReferences:\n\nYongguo Mei, Raquel Hontecillas, Xiaoying Zhang, Keith Bisset, Stephen Eubank, Stefan Hoops, Madhav Marathe, Josep Bassaganya-Riera.

[Full text]\n\nThe ENISI model is provided to the user as a network depiction of inflammatory and regulatory immune cell interactions with epithelial cells and bacteria in the four tissue compartments; lumen, epithelium, lamina propria, and lymph node.\n\nIn the network red nodes indicate cells that participate in the inflammatory pathways and blue indicate those in the regulatory pathways. Green nodes are cell-types that may participate in either response. Black arrows between nodes in the same tissue compartment represent differentiation from one cell-type to another. Black arrows between nodes in different compartments indicate migration from one tissue site to another. Green arrows point from cell-types to the differentiation and migration processes in which they participate. The network is created in CellDesigner, a structured diagram editor for drawing regulatory networks. MIEP uses this software to create the structural model. If you are interested in using CellDesigner to build your structural models you can download and install the program. An interactive version of the network is created with CellPublisher and provided to the user. Users can navigate through different cells types and interactions on the network and get useful information though the info windows. ENISI is a simulator of the mucosal immune pathways in a tissue sample. As a tool, ENISI allows users to modify model parameters creating a customized in silico environment in which infection dynamics can be predicted given the specific experimental conditions represented.\n\nThere are three options for viewing model predictions of outcomes given specific infection scenarios: 1. One may view the results of a simulated infections under hypothetical experimental conditions that have been pre-configured for past in silico studies at http://www.modelingimmunity.org/modeling/enisi/ Navigation and interpretation of these results are described in the tutorial video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdNuS-G8rqo. 2. One may run own simulations setting the host immunological set point and controlling the does and time of infection with different strains using the graphical user interface. Instructions for using ENISI are give in the tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdNuS-G8rqo. 3. One may download the code and customize their in silico enviornment further by manipulating any of the 87 parameters of the middle to fit specific experimental conditions. This involves a scripting language that is described in the on-line documentation."
