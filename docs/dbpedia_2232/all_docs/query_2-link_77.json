Computational Models in Systems Biology\n\nby Prof. Dr. Ion Petre\n\nDetails:\n\nT1. WiMAX Technologies: Architectures, Protocols, Resource Management and Applications\n\nby Prof. Dr. Eugen Borcoci\n\nThe IEEE/802.16/WiMAX emerging technology provides attractive metropolitan area broadband wireless access (BWA), highly efficient and suitable to support a large range of applications for residential and enterprise environments. This tutorial discusses the key aspects, emphasizing both the current state of the art and future trends. Basic architectures IEEE 802.16/WiMAX Forum are presented, for point to multipoint and mesh topologies with focus on layer two and above, related protocols, resource management and mobility.\n\nThe following specific topics will be discussed:\n\nMain standards in BWA\n\nApplications\n\nIEEE 802.16 and WiMAX Forum Architectures\n\nBasic PHY, Â MAC and Convergence layer aspects\n\nQoS and WiMAX Resource Management and Control\n\nIEEE 802.16/WiMAX Integration in End to END Architectures\n\nMicro and Macromobility\n\nMedia Independent Handover Approach\n\nWiMAX versus other Broadband Technologies\n\nRelevant Actors on WiMAX Market\n\nFuture Trends: WiMAX andÂ 4G networks\n\nT2. Computational Models in Systems Biology\n\nby Prof. Dr. Ion Petre\n\nObjectives:\n\nBiology is witnessing nowadays a transformation towards a more quantitative science, based on major technological breakthroughs in the past decade. In this transformation, biology is incorporating mathematical modeling techniques and computational approaches towards numerical simulations, model analysis, and predictions. Systems biology is perhaps the best example in this respect. A major effort here goes into understanding the biological functioning of the whole based on the well-understood function of its parts. The aim is to formalize and analyze the ever-changing interconnections between components (often on different time and space scales), their influence on one another, regulatory patterns, alternative pathways, etc. This is a typical example of a branch of biology where formal reasoning rather than empirical observations is the main driving force.\n\nThe importance of biology as a new application area for applied mathematics and computer science has been recognized in our community. There are already significant contributions in this field from well-established computer science research groups (from the formal methods community see D.Harel, L.Cardelli, G.Plotkin, and others), as well as a number of international conferences and journals dedicated to the topic, having computer science as the main target community.\n\nThe main difficulties for a computer scientist entering this field are on one hand, the lack of a proper (if minimal) biological background and on the other hand, the lack of training in the mathematical and computational techniques most often used in this field. Through this one-day (6 hours) tutorial, we aim to give an introduction to computational systems biology, starting with a crash course on molecular biology for computer scientist, continuing with continuous and discrete modeling techniques, as well as formal methodsbased modeling approaches. We also plan to give a computer tutorial on Copasi (Complex Pathway Simulator), a useful tool for modeling and simulating sysbio projects.\n\nFinally, we plan to give an overview of a well-rounded off sysbio project (on the heat shock response) that we have been working on in our groups for a couple of years now. We believe that this combination of basic notions and techniques, computer tutorial, and a well-defined complex research project should give our audience a valuable insight into the beauty and the challenges of systems biology. We also hope to give them an insight into the potential of their already existing computer science tools and techniques in this new application area.\n\nContent:\n\nMolecular biology for computer scientists - a crash course\n\nMathematical modeling techniques in biology: differential equations and stochastic processes\n\nComputer science modeling techniques in biology: Petri nets, temporal logic, process algebra, membrane systems\n\nCopasi tutorial: model implementation and simulation, parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, steady state analysis\n\nA sysbio project: the heat shock response\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nIt is the aim of the course to give the audience a minimum background on molecular biology and so, no prerequisites are required in this respect. With respect to the mathematical and computational techniques we plan to discuss, we will only consider them with respect to their applications to systems biology. As such, an elementary background on the notions of differentials, probabilities, Petri nets, temporal logic, process algebra, etc would be welcome. We expect this should be no problem for our target audience of graduate students and senior researchers in formal methods.\n\nPast experience of instructors:"
