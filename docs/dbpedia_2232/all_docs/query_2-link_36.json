        "text": "San Diego Convention Center\n\n#cellbio2024\n\nScientific Sessions Schedule\n\nBelow is a list of all scientific sessions at Cell Bio 2024 by day and time. It includes the Keynote, Symposia, Special Interest Subgroups, Workshops, Panels, Sponsored Scientific Sessions, and Microsymposia.\n\nFinal session descriptions, organizers, and speakers are subject to change and will be listed in the final online Program and Mobile App in October.\n\nSaturday, December 14 | 9:30 am to 11:00 am\n\nOrganizers: Ethan Garner, Harvard; and Susan Schlimpert, John Innes Center\n\nWork over the last 25 years has revealed that, in contrast to previous beliefs, bacteria and archaea are not “bags of enzymes.” As fluorescent and electron microscopy approaches have improved, it has become more and more apparent that bacteria and archaea contain a great deal of spatial and temporal organization: there exists a growing number of cytoskeletal polymers that conduct various long-range tasks that segregate DNA and other cargos, define cell shape, and help divide the cell. It has also been revealed these organisms contain not only membrane-bound compartments but also protein-based microcompartments that sequester metabolic enzymes and storage granules that accumulate excess nutrients. Similar to findings in eukaryotic organisms, biomolecular condensates also form in bacteria and archaea, functioning to modulate transcription, RNA processing, and signaling. This subgroup will highlight recent progress in the identification of the self-organizing systems in bacteria and archaea that confer multiscale cellular organization, as well as the work dissecting their underlying mechanisms. The session also welcomes talks demonstrating new developments, approaches, and techniques that can be used to probe the function and dynamics of these systems. The target audience for this session includes not only prokaryotic and archaeal cell biologists but also eukaryotic cell biologists, biophysicists, and computational biologists interested in how the very different self-organizing systems found in archaea and bacteria accomplish similar long-range spatial tasks as eukaryotic cells, often with a far smaller number of components. After attending this session, participants should be able to: 1) Describe a diversity of mechanisms microbes use to establish cellular and temporal organization.2) Appraise new approaches to image and dissect cellular processes within small microorganisms.3) Compare and contrast mechanisms used by prokaryotes, and archaea to conduct long-range tasks.\n\nOrganizers: Hui Chen, University of South Carolina; Jan Skotheim, Stanford University; and Matthew Good, University of Pennsylvania\n\nProliferating eukaryotic cells coordinate growth, division, and differentiation processes. A broad variety of cell types, from fungi to human, utilize a cell size checkpoint, a mechanism which ensures that they grow a defined amount of or achieve a specific size to trigger cell division or differentiation. Recent discoveries have uncovered the molecular basis of cell and tissue growth regulation both in cultured cells ex vivo and in stem cells in situ. Underlying the importance of regulatory processes, alterations to cell growth, cytoplasmic density and cell size impact subcellular partitioning, cellular physiology, mechanics, and gene expression. Additionally, in developing tissues, changes to cell size and nucleocytoplasmic ratio regulate decision-making events essential for growth and cell fate determination. Highlighted in this session is cutting-edge research on how cells and tissues sense and regulate their dimensions and undergo compensatory growth or expression homeostasis. We will feature speakers presenting the latest insights on the mechanistic basis of cell size and growth control. Moreover, we will discuss the dysregulation of cell growth in disease, the links between cell size and shape in cell fate determination, and the extent to which organelle size and protein expression scales with dimensions of cells and tissues.\n\nOrganizers: Mustafa Aydogan, University of California San Francisco; and Qiong Yang, University of Michigan\n\nThis special interest subgroup will bring together a broad group of scientists who work on questions of biological time control, using approaches of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science to advance the field forward. The session will not only showcase groundbreaking findings in classic fields of the cell cycle and the circadian clock, but also highlight new discoveries on autonomous clocks – biological timing mechanisms that are normally entrained by the cell cycle and/or the circadian clock to run synchronously, but can also run independently of these major programs to execute a variety of sub-cellular functions. Similarly, the subgroup will host researchers who investigate clocks and timers as a function of space and patterns (particularly in development), seminally including the segmentation clock. As cutting-edge tools have been critical to explore aspects of biological timing, the session will also feature advances in networks and dynamics theories to study complex rhythms in biology, as well as new methods to investigate biological timing in vitro, in silico or at the systems levels. Our goal is to promote new interactions between biologists, physicists, and engineers, to invigorate fresh perspectives in the overarching field of biological timing.\n\nOrganizer: Qiong Annabel Wang, City of Hope\n\nWhite, beige, and brown adipocytes play indispensable roles in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Adipocytes exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to various physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. Traditional concepts of adipocyte plasticity encompass adipogenesis, the generation of adipocytes from adipose progenitor cells, as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and cell death. Recent technological advancements, particularly in single-cell and spatial technologies, alongside comprehensive genetic mouse models, have paved the way for uncovering new dimensions of adipocyte dynamics. Emerging research is shedding light on previously unexplored phenomena, including adipocyte dedifferentiation and redifferentiation, modulation of adipocyte heterogeneity to meet metabolic demands, and the remodeling of adipocyte function associated with aging. In this session, we will highlight the latest findings in adipocyte biology and their implications for developing innovative adipocyte-based therapeutic strategies.\n\nOrganizer: Maddalena Nano, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nLiving systems are continually faced with potentially lethal challenges. Resilience is the ability to adapt to and resist environmental stress and is essential across cell types and organisms. While ensuring the continuation of life and driving evolution, resilience can also mediate the emergence of diseases and therapeutic resistance. It is therefore essential to understand the physiological and pathological mechanisms of resilience. Cellular resilience encompasses the ability of cells to survive environmental and intracellular challenges, and to escape regulated cell death. In the past decades, we have accumulated knowledge on the mechanisms, consequences and signaling networks sensing and relaying stress and lethal stimuli. However, the mechanisms and consequences of cellular resilience are only now coming into focus. This session brings together researchers studying different aspects of cellular resilience. It focuses on the strategies cells can use to overcome potentially lethal stimuli, and on the experimental methodologies we can use to investigate them. This session also aims to help addressing key challenges in the field, such as identifying the variables establishing commitment to cell survival or cell death, to build predictive models and to learn how to experimentally steer these decisions.\n\nOrganizers: G.W. Gant Luxton, University of California, Davis; Hanaa Hariri, Wayne State University; and Mary Mirvis, University of California, San Francisco\n\nThe last decade has seen a rapid acceleration in organelle interactions research, uncovering a wealth of knowledge on the molecular basis of inter-organelle membrane contact sites (MCS) and communication. This has given rise to an emerging integrative view of organelle structural and functional interconnectivity, featuring many interdependencies and redundancies. The next challenge is to understand the organelle network as a dynamic and highly complex system. The prospect of pursuing a simplified bottom-up view by building in vitro organelle interactions systems has been gaining traction as a promising emerging research area, but remains an untapped avenue of research. Such systems can potentially provide a new perspective on many open questions. What are the precise functions of MCS proteins within their complexes? How do MCS respond to environmental perturbations and changing functional states? How is information transmitted between organelles? What is the interplay between genetically programmed organelle interactions and passive self-organization? Can organelle contact and communication be engineered? This session will showcase cutting edge knowledge and technical advances from organelle biology, biochemistry, synthetic biology, bioengineering, systems biology, biophysics, and more, highlighting the potential for new applications and collaborative work toward the goal of in vitro organelle networks.\n\nSaturday, December 14 | 11:15 am to 12:45 pm\n\nOrganizers: Assaf Zaritsky, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; and Meghan Driscoll, University of Minnesota\n\nCell imaging has entered the ‘Big Data’ era. New technologies in light microscopy and molecular biology have led to an explosion in high-content, dynamic and multidimensional imaging data. Computation, traditionally used to quantitatively test specific hypotheses, must now also enable iterative hypothesis generation and testing by deciphering hidden biologically meaningful patterns in complex, dynamic or high-dimensional cell image data. Data Science, an emerging interdisciplinary field that involves the development and application of computational tools to extract domain-specific insights from large and/or complex datasets, is uniquely positioned to aid in this process. In this subgroup, we bring together biologists and data scientists to help build a data science community within ASCB. After organizing six similar subgroups in the last six years, and currently organizing the ASCB webinar series on the same topic, this year we propose, if possible, to include tandem talks selected from submitted abstracts in which pairs of experimental and computational biologists present their collaborative work. We will maintain our tradition of focusing on early career scientists that have not yet had the stage to showcase their science, as well as not selecting speakers that have already presented in any of the previous subgroups we organized.\n\nOrganizers: Margaret Johnson, Johns Hopkins University; and Michael Blinov, CENTER FOR CELL ANALYSIS AND MODELING, UConn Health\n\nCell biology has been transformed by revolutions in imaging and sequencing, generating vast amounts of quantitative data that demand increasingly sophisticated quantitative models capable of determining whether hypothesized mechanisms can explain observed phenomena. These complex models can typically only be solved via computer simulation, and to describe living cells they must integrate networks of interacting components over space and time. The ultimate goal of modeling a dynamic, living cell is still computationally intractable, but efforts from across the modeling and software development spectrum are helping to bring this goal closer while also making these tools more accessible to experimentalists and non-experts. With this subgroup, we thus aim to bring together scientists addressing three key challenges towards realistic models of living cells: 1) expanding model descriptions of cellular dynamics beyond biochemical dynamics to include molecular structure or mechanical elements 2) developing software to efficiently interface with experimental datasets and perform parameter estimation 3) developing software or web-based tools that facilitate model sharing and reproducibility amongst experts and non-experts alike. A goal for this subgroup is to foster closer collaboration between experimental cell biologists and computational modelers.\n\nOrganizers: Bhuminder Singh, Vanderbilt University Medical Center; and Heike Folsch, Northwestern University\n\nPolarized epithelial cells form monolayers that virtually line every organ thus forming barriers between the inside and outside of the body. Apical membranes face the luminal side of organs, basal membranes face extracellular matrix and the basal lamina, and lateral membranes contact neighboring cells. This polarized architecture is established during embryonic development and maintained throughout life by active sorting and delivery of plasma membrane proteins to the correct membrane locations from intracellular sorting stations such as the TGN, early endosomes, and recycling endosomes. Understanding the key mechanisms that regulate polarity and polarized trafficking are key to understanding how epithelial cells may lose polarity and morph into metastatic cancer cells. The goal of this special interest subgroup meeting is to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the dynamic subcellular organization (TGN and endosome organization) in 3D, how this contributes to polarized delivery of plasma membrane proteins, and how these processes modulate cancer progression.\n\nSponsored by the Journal of Cell Biology\n\nOrganizers: Arshad Desai, University of California San Diego; and Tim Fessenden, Rockefeller University Press\n\nWhere is cell biology research going? In this session, members of the Early Career Editorial Advisory Board of the Journal of Cell Biology share how their research confronts open questions across fields of cell biology. This session will tour areas of inquiry that are emerging as new techniques to examine cell structures converge with new conceptual frameworks of how cells function across scales.\n\nOrganizers: Arthur Molines, University of California San Francisco; and Rikki Garner, Harvard Medical School\n\nThe cytoplasm is an extremely complex and crowded solution of macromolecules that can behave as a liquid, a gel, or a glass, depending on the context. There has been a recent explosion of new reports implicating physical properties of the cytoplasm, such as its crowdedness and viscosity, in a diverse range of critical biological processes - including differentiation, cell viability, cellular aging and senescence, cytoskeleton dynamics, and biocondensate formation. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that a variety of cell types precisely regulate properties such as their intracellular density, particularly throughout the cell cycle and in response to changes in their environment. It is an exciting time in the field, as a rapidly-growing collective of scientists and engineers are becoming increasingly (a) interested in the physical properties of the cytoplasm and their consequences for cell biology, and (b) enabled by a suite of new methods and technologies to explore these rich phenomena. Our goal is to expose a broad biological audience to this emerging field, and inspire the use of modern methodologies to discover new roles for cytoplasm biophysics in diverse biological processes. In this 3rd iteration of the subgroup, special emphasis will be given to the physiological implications and regulation of cytoplasmic characteristics, as well as related themes observed in the study of organelles (e.g., nucleoplasm, ER lumen) and membraneless cellular compartments.\n\nOrganizer: David Sanchez, Western University of Health Sciences\n\nViruses have evolved to exploit multiple aspects of cell biology to further their replication. These convergence of virus and host cells allow us to better understand how viruses can be targeted as well as unravel fundamental cell biology. Here we will highlight new advances in how viruses and host cells interact. This Special Interest Subgroup is for anyone interested in how viruses interact with cells as well as how host defenses deter these interactions.\n\nSaturday, December 14 | 1:45 to 3:15 pm\n\nOrganizers: Christopher Obara, UC San Diego; Itay Budin, UC San Diego; and Sarah Cohen, UNC Chapel Hill\n\nLipids are the fundamental building block of membrane-bound organelles, with functions in organelle structure and dynamics, protein interactions, cell signaling, and energy storage. Fueled by emerging technologies in chemical biology, microscopy, and biophysics, it is becoming increasingly clear that these important molecules are not passive components of membranes. Instead, they play active roles in the control of organelle morphology, function, and communication. In this subgroup, we aim to bring together scientists from diverse subfields of cell biology, biophysics, and tool development who are interested in lipid-mediated processes within organelles. Talks will focus on a wide variety of organelles, including but not limited to the secretory pathway, endolysosomal system, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lipid droplets, and chloroplasts.\n\nOrganizer: Matthew Welch, University of California, Berkeley, and MBoC Editor-in-Chief\n\nMolecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC), the scientific journal of the ASCB, has served the cell biology community for more than 30 years, providing researchers with constructive feedback and a platform to showcase their work to a global audience of cell scientists. In this interesting and thought-provoking session, MBoC is inviting emerging scientists and leading experts to showcase research that represent the future of cell biology. We welcome speakers to showcase novel technologies or experimental approaches in cell biology research.\n\nOrganizers: Kevin Eliceiri, Morgridge Institute for Research; and Nikki Bialy, Morgridge Institute for Research\n\nThis workshop will start with an overview of BioImaging North America and the Quality Control and Data Management efforts ongoing within the organization. It will then describe the different stages of the life cycle of image data and which metadata has to be collected at each stage on the basis of community recommendations such as REMBI and the 4DN-BINA-OME Microscopy Metadata specifications. The workshop will emphasize the importance of creating both human and machine readable representations of the metadata to facilitate the generation, management and sharing of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) cell biology data, in compliance with recent NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) policies. The target audience is cell biologist, imaging professionals and educators using light microscopy techniques to generate quantitative image data. The learning objectives will be to understand the need and value of both human and machine readable representations of metadata. To this end attendees will participate in hands-on training on how to generate well documented image data starting from textual descriptions of experimental protocols and filling-in metadata annotation templates. In addition, attendees will have the opportunity to learn about community-developed software tools and checklists available to help cell biologists capture microscopy metadata. At the end of the session participants will have an opportunity to discuss the relative merits and limitations of different approaches and challenges related to the generation of DMS plans.\n\nOrganizers: Amélie Fréal, Amsterdam UMC; and Kelsie Eichel, University of Colorado Boulder\n\nNeurons face extreme cell biological challenges due to their large size, stringent polarity, elaborate morphologies, active plasticity, and long lifespan. As a result, neurons heavily rely on membrane trafficking mechanisms to meet these cell biological demands. Recent advances in molecular, genetic, and imaging tools in numerous neuronal types have been essential in uncovering membrane trafficking mechanisms that underlie nervous system function. These membrane trafficking mechanisms serve as a convergent point to integrate protein and organelle transport, the movement of membrane material and lipids, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Studying cell biological mechanisms at the extremes, as is the case in neurons, will facilitate the discovery of general principles of cell biology and provide fundamental insights into neuronal function. This subgroup meeting will bring together cellular neurobiologists working on these different areas and discuss recent advances in understanding how membrane trafficking mechanisms contribute to neuronal health and go awry in disease states. We will bring together a diverse and dynamic group of speakers from a balanced range of career stages, geographic locations, and backgrounds.\n\nOrganizers: Dorothee Dormann, Johannes Gutenberg University; and Edward Lemke, Johannes Gutenberg University\n\nResearch in the last decade has provided experimental solid evidence for multivalent interactions between biopolymers such as DNA, RNA and proteins as a driving force to form non-deterministic assemblies, including condensates that form by phase transitions. This notion has reshaped how we understand and study cellular organization and biological mechanisms. What we have witnessed in recent years is how a field that started with a few specific publications grew exponentially and ushered in a new era of \"Cell Biology 2.0\". The new research concept of biomolecular condensation has changed how life scientists think about and approach biological problems. However, this is history now! Most importantly, this history teaches us that fundamentally understanding polymers accelerates the discovery of polymer-centric explanations for cellular function. After all, the ability to phase separate is just one property intrinsic to a polymer. We believe other properties await their turn in the spotlight as well. At the same time, we also see how biological complexity can inspire fundamental polymer research. This quid pro quo between the polymer and the molecular life sciences is our primary motivation for hosting this special interest subgroup on “Polymer Concepts in Cellular Function”. In this session, we will select for those contributions that showcase the use of polymer concepts to understand cellular function. Preference will be given to topics where polymer principles/concepts besides Phase separation are the main focus or those that bring our understanding of the role of phase separation beyond the state of the art. Research contributions can present novel technologies or mechanistic insights across the whole spectrum of cell biology but should showcase how integrating polymer science into life science approaches can drive cell biology into the future.\n\nOrganizers: Josefina del Marmol, Harvard Medical School; and Paul Garrity, Brandeis University\n\nThe goal of this session is to provide a forum highlighting the exploration of some of the wide variety of sensory receptor molecules and specialized sensory cells that organisms use to monitor their environments, both internal and external. Emphasis will be on mechanistic advances on the structure and function of the molecular receptors as well as the specialized cells in which these receptors operate. Developmental and evolutionary perspectives are encouraged.\n\nSaturday, December 14 | 4:30 pm-6:00 pm\n\nLorenz Studer\n\nDirector, Center for Stem Cell Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nSunday, December 15 | 8:45 am to 9:45 am\n\nPietro De Camilli, Yale University\n\nGia Voeltz, University of Colorado-Boulder\n\nOrganizers: Amy Shaub Maddox, UNC Chapel Hill; Dimitrios Vavylonis, Lehigh University; Douglas Robinson, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Jian-Qiu Wu, The Ohio State University; Julie Canman, Columbia University; and Ulrike S. Eggert, King’s College London\n\nCytokinesis is a spectacular cellular shape change, which requires coordination of complex cellular machinery over many scales of space and time. In animal cells, this includes signaling pathways that guide the rearrangement of spindle microtubules to position the division plane, assembly of a contractile actomyosin network at the division site, force production to drive a dramatic cell shape change, timely remodeling of the plasma membrane, and finally abscission into two daughter cells. In a multicellular setting, cytokinesis further requires cell-cell and cell-environment communication. This geometrically simplified cell shape change serves as a paradigm for numerous other cell shape change events including those that take place during migration and tissue morphogenesis. In this 8th Biannual Special Interest Subgroup Meeting, we propose to bring together a group of investigators using systematic genetic and chemical methods, biophysical techniques for measuring contractility, high resolution imaging, diverse model organisms and cell types, and mathematical modeling. To ensure that our Subgroup meeting is exceptionally valuable to attendees, we will encourage our speakers to present newly-emerging results. We envision inviting one or two distinguished scientists in the field, and a diverse slate of speakers will be selected democratically from submitted abstracts.\n\nOrganizer: Margherita Perillo, Marine Biological Laboratory\n\nEpithelia often organize into biological tubes that transport fluids, cells and gasses. This simple epithelial organization is the foundation for a great diversity of structures that are vital to support life across organisms, including organs, glands, and the vascular system. Tube malfunctions have severe health implications, such as tissue fibrosis, cancer and impaired organs. Building tubes, or tubulogenesis, consists of forming an epithelium surrounding a lumen that grows, elongates and branches. Key cellular events in in lumen formation, size regulation and elongation include acquisition of cell polarity, maintenance of cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions and regulation of cytoskeleton mechanical properties. Additionally, these cellular behaviors are coordinated by developmental signaling pathways and physical parameters like pressure and flow. This special interest subgroup will be the first to bring together a broad group of scientists that focus on cellular, developmental, and physical mechanisms of tube morphogenesis. Because biological tubes are present in virtually all multicellular organisms, this session includes speakers bringing their diverse perspectives by working with a variety of systems (such as plants, animals, cell culture and organoids) and diverse technological expertise. By fostering interactions across scientists from diverse backgrounds, this session will provide a forum for researchers at multiple career stages to collaborate and expand the emerging field of tubulogenesis with new concepts, ideas and interdisciplinary approaches.\n\nOrganizer: Sahand Rahi, EPFL\n\nMuch of biology is associated with specific time scales, time windows, and dynamics. What determines the timing of biological events is becoming a subject of intense interest. From single proteins to gene circuit-level timing mechanism to growth thresholds, timers and clocks can come in different guises. In this subgroup, we will bring together scientists exploring different timing mechanisms to look for common mechanistic and conceptual principles.\n\nOrganizers: Danielle Schmitt, University of California Los Angeles; and Maria Fernanda Forni, Yale University\n\nThis session promises an engaging exploration into cellular metabolism, unveiling new perspectives in cell biology and innovative approaches to measuring metabolism. Tailored for researchers at all levels with a keen interest in dissecting every facet of metabolism, this session will focus on comprehending metabolism’s pivotal role in shaping the future of cell biology. We aim to shed light on the metabolic pathways shaping fundamental cellular functions and unravel the complex signaling networks that govern cellular responses. This session is designed to facilitate a deep dive into the complexity of metabolic processes. From dissecting how metabolic pathways frame cellular life to understanding the sophisticated signaling networks dictating cellular and organismal responses, participants will gain insights into the dynamic world of cellular energy dynamics. Moreover, this session aims to emphasize upcoming technical novelties that promise to revolutionize our ability to measure and observe metabolism. Join us in this comprehensive exploration, where scientific inquiry meets technological innovation, paving the way for a deeper understanding of cellular functions and energy regulation.\n\nSunday, December 15 | 10:00 am to 11:00 am\n\nEach talk is a 4-minute to 5-minute overview of the presenter’s poster without Q&A. Each Microsymposium session will include 10 Poster Teasers selected from top-scoring abstracts each day across all scientific topics. All Microsymposia speakers must also present a poster.\n\nSunday, December 15 | 3:15 pm to 4:45 pm\n\nOrganizers: Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz and Ron Vale, Janelia Research Campus\n\nSponsored by the HHMI Janelia Research Campus\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in cell biology today is how to make sense of the explosion of data at the single cell-level, tissue-level, and organism-level so that we can answer core questions such as how genes interact to give rise to a particular cell type, how different cell types organize into tissue architectures and how cell state transitions are precisely controlled. The four speakers in this session will discuss how AI can help in this endeavor by creating theoretical, computational, and algorithmic paradigms for understanding the programs of life. They will discuss how AI offers a landscape of opportunities ranging from the mapping of cellular programs (from genes to cell state) to the mapping of cellular networks (from cells to tissues). Additionally, they will talk about how AI and cell biology can develop as a two-way street, with cell biology fueling questions and foundational advances in AI, and AI driving new types of data generation and analyses in cell biology.\n\nOrganizers: Claudia Vasquez, University of Washington; Matthew Akamatsu, University of Washington; and Shaohe Wang, HHMI Janelia\n\nMulticellular organisms intricately craft tissues of various shapes to fulfill a range of physiological functions. The art of tissue building entails precisely positioning cells of appropriate types, which necessitates a dynamic interplay between subcellular processes, cells themselves, and their extracellular matrices. The mechanical interactions shaping tissue morphology are guided by biochemical signaling and mediated by organization and remodeling of cytoskeletal, membrane reshaping, and adhesion complexes. These actions collectively determine the shape and positions of cells within tissues, along with the distribution and underlying sculpting activity of extracellular matrices. The study of how organisms construct complex tissues and organs is a burgeoning field, with recent research highlighting the significance of initial geometry, the active role of the extracellular matrix, adhesion coding between cell types, and the interplay between mechanical and biochemical signaling. This subgroup will showcase studies across scales using a variety of model systems and technologies that build an emerging picture of how cells self-organize into tissues.\n\nOrganizer: Stacey Glasgow, University of California, San Diego\n\nBuilding a nervous system requires exquisitely precise coordination of cellular events. These events provide cellular identity, establish appropriate pathways, and regulate connectivity, all of which ultimately contribute to optimal performance and function. Once the nervous system is established, regeneration from injury or neurodegenerative disease is limited in the CNS resulting in loss of neuro-functionality. Nervous system development, function, and regeneration depends on the coordinated action of both neurons and glia. Many unanswered questions remain, including: what are the molecular mechanisms involved in axon terminal differentiation?; how do glial cells influence neural circuitry, function, plasticity, and regeneration?; and, how do neuron-glia interactions contribute to development, function, and disease?. This session focuses on emerging findings in how axons find their targets during development and how glial cells play a role in neuron function and connectivity. It will also provide emerging insights into how these processes are dysregulated in disease and exploited during regeneration. This subgroup will highlight work on diverse cell type interactions in the CNS across organisms both during development and regeneration from diverse researchers at multiple career stages.\n\nOrganizers: Amy Gladfelter, Duke University; Guatam Dey, EMBL; Monica Bettencourt-Dias, Gulbenkian Institute; Samara Reck-Peterson, UCSD\n\nMultiscale interactions from molecules and cells to ecosystems link the biosphere to the climate. Mitigating the climate crisis will require understanding and interventions that cross these scales, which are often siloed. Cells are the first responders to environmental signals and have machinery to sense and make decisions based on external conditions. This makes cell biology an essential lens for examining the mechanisms of adaptation and resilience in the face of extreme environmental stressors. However, cell biologists are just beginning to think about how their work can impact planetary health. By integrating cell biology with ecological and evolutionary frameworks, and the physiochemical alterations related to climate change, we aim to uncover new solutions for mitigating the impacts of climate change on human health and supporting the sustainability of our planet. This special interest subgroup will focus on understanding how cells can adapt to changing environments and can be engineered for sustainability applications. An objective is to inspire ASCB members to consider new intersections between their work and the problems of a planet facing climate change.\n\nOrganizer: Prasanna Satpute-Krishnan, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\n\nFar beyond a trash recycling center, lysosomes are dynamic organelles that function as the central organizer of cellular homeostasis. They detect metabolic changes, integrate signaling pathways and switch the cell between anabolic and catabolic states. Lysosomal biogenesis and reformation is reliant on proteins and membranes derived from the secretory pathway, and delivered via autophagosomes or endocytic vesicles. Lysosomes form contact sites with the ER, Golgi, peroxisomes and mitochondria to engage in mutual homeostatic regulation. This subgroup will congregate cell biologists whose work centers on any of the diverse aspects of lysosomal biology including (i) lysosomal dynamics and positioning, (ii) contact sites and Ca2+, Fe2+, and lipid transfer, (iii) acidification, membrane and protein trafficking during biogenesis and reformation, (iv) nutrient sensing and signal transduction and (v) degradation and autophagy. We will discuss the consequences of defects in these processes such as neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage diseases, cancers, metabolic disorders and ultimately a reduced life-span, and potential therapeutic approaches to address these issues.\n\nSunday, December 15 | 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm\n\nSarah Teichmann, Cambridge University\n\nLacramioara Bintu, Stanford University\n\nOrganizers: Amy Shaub Maddox, UNC Chapel Hill; Dimitrios Vavylonis, Lehigh University\n\nDouglas Robinson, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Jian-Qiu Wu, The Ohio State University; Julie Canman, Columbia University; and Ulrike S. Eggert, King’s College London\n\nCytokinesis is a spectacular cellular shape change, which requires coordination of complex cellular machinery over many scales of space and time. In animal cells, this includes signaling pathways that guide the rearrangement of spindle microtubules to position the division plane, assembly of a contractile actomyosin network at the division site, force production to drive a dramatic cell shape change, timely remodeling of the plasma membrane, and finally abscission into two daughter cells. In a multicellular setting, cytokinesis further requires cell-cell and cell-environment communication. This geometrically simplified cell shape change serves as a paradigm for numerous other cell shape change events including those that take place during migration and tissue morphogenesis. In this 8th Biannual Special Interest Subgroup Meeting, we propose to bring together a group of investigators using systematic genetic and chemical methods, biophysical techniques for measuring contractility, high resolution imaging, diverse model organisms and cell types, and mathematical modeling. To ensure that our Subgroup meeting is exceptionally valuable to attendees, we will encourage our speakers to present newly-emerging results. We envision inviting one or two distinguished scientists in the field, and a diverse slate of speakers will be selected democratically from submitted abstracts.\n\nOrganizers: Carolyn Ott, Janelia Research Campus; and Maxwell Heiman, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School\n\nCilia have superpowers that are only beginning to come to light. This subgroup will explore surprising roles for cilia revealed by recent studies in mammals, traditional research organisms such as C. elegans and unconventional ones like Euplotes, as well as the fabrication of biologically-inspired artificial cilia. Attendees will learn how cilia are 'more than cellular antennae', mediating exquisitely specific cell attachments in the nervous system, acting as cellular transmitters through the release of extracellular vesicles, and undergoing highly coordinated control to perform complex mechanical tasks. By bringing together diverse scientists studying cilia in novel contexts, this session will spotlight open questions about the diversity and function of these remarkable cellular structures.\n\nOrganizer: Leslie Loew, U. Conn. School of Medicine\n\nMathematical modeling offers a deeper understanding of cellular functions and phenomena. It also enables researchers to make predictions and test hypotheses in silico before conducting costly and time-consuming experiments. In this interactive hands-on workshop, we will demonstrate how several mathematical modeling techniques help understanding important biological questions as well as provide aid in analyzing complex experimental data. Examples of the kinds of topics that may be covered include: Analyzing FRAP experiments on biomolecular condensates from microscope images and 3D reaction-diffusion modeling. Parameter estimation in a complex intracellular metabolic network. Rule-based modeling to account for the combinatorial complexity in RTK signaling. Explaining pigmentation Turing patterns in flower petals using 2D reaction-diffusion models. During the workshop, we will use the popular software packages COPASI (http://copasi.org) and VCell (http://vcell.org).\n\nParticipants will follow simple step-by-step guides on their own laptops. We will offer a choice of exercises using peer-reviewed published models (such as the examples above). We will explain how to find and use existing models using databases such as BioModelDB and VCellDB, how to save and exchange models between different modeling software using exchange formats such as SBML, and how to annotate models using public databases of biological entities (such as UniProt and ChEBi).\n\nOrganizer: Anne Straube, Centre for Mechanochemical Cell Biology, University of Warwick\n\nMolecular motors drive intracellular transport, actively organise cytoskeletal filaments and generate extensile and contractile forces. This session focusses on recent insights into how molecular motors are activated and recruited to cargo for transport, switched off when the cargo arrives at the destination, how their activities are coordinated when working in teams, or controlled in space or time in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals.\n\nOrganizer: Xiaolei Su, Yale University\n\nIn response to pathogen infection or tissue injury, circulating leukocytes take a serial process of tethering, rolling, arrest, adhesion, and finally migration across the endothelium to reach inflamed tissues and execute their immune functions. In a similar pathway, circulating metastatic cancer cells transmigrate through the endothelial layer to reach new colonization sites. In traditional views, transendothelial migration occurs at cell-cell junctions (paracellularly). However, recent evidence suggested the presence of transcellular migration, in which leukocytes or cancer cells penetrate through the endothelial cell body to exit blood vessel. Both the paracellular and transcellular process requires intimate interactions and bidirectional signaling between the invading and receiving cells, accompanied by highly coordinated remodeling of cytoskeleton and membrane systems. This subgroup focuses on mechanistic studies of transendothelial migration, as well as its consequences in infectious diseases and cancer metastasis. Scientists from all career stages and diverse ethnic and culture background are welcome to attend and present at this subgroup. Equally important as its scientific excellence, this session also emphasizes providing educational opportunities for trainees to present at the subgroup and engage with speakers through on- and post-session discussions.\n\nMonday, December 16 | 8:45 am to 9:45 am\n\nAnthony Covarrubias, University of California, Los Angeles\n\nVera Gorbunova, University of Rochester\n\nOrganizer: Joseph Arron, Sonoma Biotherapeutics\n\nEngineered immune cell therapies, most notably chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cells, have delivered significant benefit to subsets of patients with hematologic malignancies in recent years. Now, efforts are emerging to engineer T cells for the treatment of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, with several novel candidate therapies entering clinical development. This panel will consider a variety of approaches, challenges, and opportunities unique to developing cell therapies for immune disorders. LEARNING OBJECTIVES:\n\n- explore recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in engineered cell therapy approaches for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders\n\n- compare and contrast mechanisms of effector (Teff) and regulatory (Treg) T cell therapies\n\n- discuss engineering considerations for antigen recognition (CAR vs. TCR), methods for transduction (lentivirus vs. CRISPR), and methods for clinical production (selection, expansion, product characterization)\n\n- discuss engineering considerations for cellular enhancements (e.g., persistence, stability, payloads, safety switches)\n\n- understand clinical development and regulatory considerations with special relevance to immune indications (e.g., trial design, patient selection, biomarkers, endpoints, pre-conditioning).\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE: Academic and industry researchers with interests in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, T cells, cell engineering.\n\nOrganizers: Nathalie Gaudreault, Allen Institute for Cell Science; and Rick Horwitz, Allen Institute for Cell Science\n\nQuantitative cellular imaging is arguably the next big step in the postgenomic era. Making this happen at scale and across the spectrum of imaging labs, both big and small, will require a large community effort to create a federated network of high-quality, readily accessible, interoperable, and reusable image data, with appropriate metadata and tools to access and analyze it, as well as to train and validate AI/ML models. Several meetings and publications have already appeared supporting this goal and outlining the key challenges and how to address them. This panel discussion will bring together key community stakeholders, imaging scientists, funding agencies, instrument manufacturers, cloud storage providers, and scientific publishers, to develop a concrete plan to create this network. The learning objective for this session will be to understand the challenges faced by each stakeholder group (funding agencies, instrument manufacturers, imaging scientists and scientific publishers) in making quantitative image data FAIR and outline pathways for resolving them. The target audience for this session is all stakeholders working on cellular imaging - funding agencies, instrument manufacturers, imaging scientists, scientific publishers, research institutions, open science organizations, and supporters. A unique feature of this panel is to bring them all together, in person, at the ASCB meeting.\n\nOrganizers: Marc Germain, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Riviere; and Samantha Lewis, UC Berkeley\n\nMitochondria are the nexus of cellular energy metabolism and major signaling hubs that integrate information from within and without the cell to implement cell function. These organelles harbor a distinct polyploid genome, mitochondrial DNA, the integrity of which is required for cellular, tissue, and systemic metabolic homeostasis. Despite this, how the regulation of mitochondrial DNA and its gene products are integrated more broadly with inter-compartmental signaling pathways is not well understood. In this subgroup we aim to bring together scientists studying mitochondrial gene expression, membrane integrity, and immunology who are interested in (i) Mechanistic regulation of the mitochondrial central dogma inside the organelle and coordination via membrane contacts, (ii) Extrinsic signaling pathways that converge on mitochondrial genome maintenance, and (iii) Consequences of dysregulation, including inflammation. Our discussion will synthesize emerging insights from multiple fields to highlight how extrinsic and intrinsic signals converge to modulate mtDNA maintenance and expression.\n\nOrganizer: Nadir Kaplan, Virginia Tech\n\nThe structure and behavior of animal cells including locomotion or decision making strongly depend on the physicochemical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tissues and cell cultures. To that end, how a porous, viscoelastic medium, such as the ECM or its synthetic analogs, affects the reconfiguration of an isolated single cell in vitro or in vivo requires a fundamental biophysical understanding. Developing such an understanding will elucidate the microscopic origins of tissue mechanics and growth, as well as stem cell differentiation or malignant cell migration. Further, it may provide insights into tissue self-organization through matrix-mediated mechanical interactions between isolated cells and motivate new physical models of active matter in elastic media. The goal of this session will be to provide a comprehensive single cell-level mechanistic perspective for the dynamical coupling between the cell and the medium in two and three dimensions. To achieve that, the session aims to showcase stimulating theoretical and computational advancements that address open questions in biology and guide new experiments to appeal to the broader cell biology community.\n\nOrganizer: Mike Boyce, Duke University\n\nIn this session, ASCB MOSAIC Program (AMP) scholars will present their latest research on a range of cell biology topics. The goal of the NIH-funded MOSAIC program is to diversify the tenure track faculty at research-intensive universities nationwide. AMP scholars are leaders in both their subfields of cell biology and in advancing equity and inclusion in the academic biosciences. Our target audience is all attendees of the Annual Meeting. Learning objectives include gaining new knowledge of cutting-edge cell biology research and networking with rising-star speakers.\n\nMonday, December 16 | 10:00 am to 11:00 am\n\nEach talk is a 4-minute to 5-minute overview of the presenter’s poster without Q&A. Each Microsymposium session will include 10 Poster Teasers selected from top-scoring abstracts each day across all scientific topics. All Microsymposia speakers must also present a poster.\n\nMonday, December 16 | 3:15 pm to 4:45 pm\n\nThis session highlights the work of researchers who have experience of working across multiple continents in multiple research environments. Talks will be research focused, but with an emphasis on what the speakers have learned from working in these very different research environments.\n\nOrganizers: Ameya Jalihal, Duke University; Amy Gladfelter, Duke University; and Madeline Keenen, Duke University\n\nMultinucleate cells have arisen repeatedly through evolution both in unicellular and tissue contexts. Also referred to as coenocytes or syncytia, multinucleate cells are typically large, and often extreme cells, spanning length scales from 100s of microns to meters. Why do some cells and cell-types choose a multinucleate lifestyle repeatedly through evolution? What unique cell biological properties emerge from multinucleate organization? In this subgroup we hope to seed a community engaged in exploring the emergent cell biological functions of syncytia. By bringing together experts across single-celled syncytial organisms and multinucleate tissues, and showcasing work aimed at understanding novel and understudied cell-scale functions, the “Emergent Functions of Syncytia” subgroup is targeted to the general cell biologist and aims to explore the frontiers of cell biology with implications for the emergence of multicellularity and polyploidy.\n\nOrganizers: Erik Dent, University of Wisconsin; and Francesca Bartolini, Columbia University\n\nIt has long been accepted that microtubules provide the architectural elements to achieve and maintain complex neuronal shapes and long-distance transport. Emerging studies support the notion that microtubules further control central aspects of synaptic activity, including neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. The pleiotropic effects caused by a dysfunctional synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton may thus represent a key point of vulnerability for neurons and a potential driver of neurodegenerative disease. Anomalies in synaptic function are widely observed in the CNS of subjects affected by neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disease. Compelling evidence from clinical studies and animal models of disease support the concept that a disrupted cytoskeleton underlies these anomalies, and genetic linkage studies associate microtubule regulating proteins with an increased risk for neurodegeneration. Despite the significance of these clinical observations, whether microtubules play a direct role in regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity is surprisingly understudied. The idea for this session is to present outstanding examples of how employing state-of-the art cell biology approaches can bring us closer to deciphering the mechanisms underlying microtubule dependent synaptic function at pre and post synaptic compartments and its implication in neurodegenerative disease. There will also be a description of the detailed road map of microtubule orientations and modifications obtained with protein engineering combined with advanced optical methods. The symposium will be chaired by two pioneers in the field with the intent to share this emerging knowledge in synaptic biology that naturally forms a novel area of investigation with many questions remaining. Most importantly, it has become critical to determine whether defective microtubule dynamics at synapses contributes to the loss of synaptic function in synaptic disease and whether restoring the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton might be sufficient to prevent or normalize this dysfunction.\n\nOrganizers: Kara Bernstein, University of Pennsylvania; and Mikael Garabedian, University of Pennsylvania\n\nAll cells must dynamically coordinate genomic functions and contend with DNA lesions such as double strand breaks. Many aspects of DNA repair and genomic regulatory machinery have been characterized from yeast to human. In recent years, however, new discoveries have shifted traditional models and new paradigms of how cells maintain genomic integrity have emerged. These include liquid-liquid phase separation and condensate formation of DNA repair factors and the involvement of cytoskeletal machinery in order to facilitate DNA repair and fidelity. Further, the past decade has given rise to new tools and technologies to study protein complexes and ensembles at unprecedented scales. This session will feature a diverse array of speakers from multiple career stages to present the latest research in how cells employ different strategies to repair and regulate their genome. We will highlight several emerging concepts, survey the latest insights and models for functions of nuclear bodies, and explore cutting edge tools and techniques available to interrogate. Further, because this topic and proposed speakers are not traditionally members of ASCB, this session presents an opportunity to invite a new group into the organization and grow our society.\n\nOrganizers: Sandra Maday, University of Pennsylvania; and Swetha Gowrishankar, University of Illinois at Chicago\n\nIn the last few decades, there has been a growing interest in understanding the biogenesis, transport, and functioning of endo-lysosomal and autophagic pathways in different cells of the central nervous system (CNS), including the highly polarized and morphologically complex neuron, microglia and astrocytes. More recently, the interactions between these cell types, including communication between each other through extracellular vesicles and the molecular pathways involved, have gained much attention. These pathways are critical to normal development and functioning of the CNS, and dysregulation in these pathways is linked with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We propose a session that will feature exciting and recent discoveries in our understanding of trafficking within and between the various CNS cells.A key goal for this session is to join scientists doing exciting cell biology in neuroscience. This session will feature a diverse and broad scope of science at multiple levels: (1) exploration of biological mechanisms from molecular to cellular resolution, (2) pathways and machinery operating in different parts of the neuron, astrocyte, or between these cells; (4) mechanisms in physiology and pathology, (5) different model systems from human iPSC-derived neurons to rodent models.\n\nOrganizers: Allyson Sgro, Janelia Farms; and Daniel Cohen, Princeton University\n\n“The body is a cell state, and every cell a citizen”—Virchow, c. 1840. From multicellular animals to pluricellular consortia, strange and amazing things happen when large numbers of cells get together. Such cellular communities include algae, bacterial biofilms, fungi, and cellular cities humming along inside you as you read this. The resulting collective behaviors in these communities enable multicellular life and underpin processes spanning morphogenesis, collective migration, healing, long-range communication, and even cancer invasion. This session aims to bring together a collective of collective cell behavior researchers across different model systems to showcase new behaviors, methods, and mindsets.\n\nMonday, December 16 | 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm\n\nMichael Murrell, Yale School of Medicine\n\nCynthia Reinhart-King, Rice University\n\nOrganizers: Arthur Charles-Orszag, UCSF; and Dyche Mullins, UCSF\n\nUntil the early 1970s, living cells were not known to survive (and thrive) in the most extreme environments on Earth, with broader assumptions about the possibility of finding life on other planets. This view was challenged in 1972 with the discovery of the first thermoacidophilic archaea in terrestrial hot springs. Since then, many more bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic species have been discovered that are highly adapted to extreme conditions: low and high temperature, low and high pH, high salinity or low water activity, and extreme nutrient starvation. These discoveries have immensely expanded the theoretical range of conditions favorable to life. Studies in cell biology at the extremes have a direct impact on our basic understanding of Earth’s biology and biochemistry, on our ability to predict/detect traces of life elsewhere in the universe, and has direct biotechnological applications as a source of new enzymes that can perform work under various physicochemical conditions. This session will present recent advances made in this interdisciplinary field. Emphasis will be put both on the cellular mechanisms of basic processes in extremophilic species, and on technical advancements that led to such discoveries (such as high-tmperature microscopy). This session will attract cell biologists working in all domains of life (bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes) and interested in diverse aspects of cell biology (from chromosome segregation, to protein trafficking, to cytoskeleton dynamics), as well as astrobiologists and biophysicists. After attending this session, participants will: 1) Better understand how macromolecules and cells have adapted to function and thrive under a wide range of physicochemical conditions. 2) Learn new biochemical, biophysical, and genetic mechanisms by which cells have adapted to extreme environments.3) Have an expanded vision of the limits of life on Earth.\n\nOrganizers: Amit Joshi, University of Tennessee; and Laura Lackner, Northwestern University\n\nMembrane-bound organelles are a hallmark of eukaryotic cells. Historically, research in cell biology focused on studying the function of organelles as individual entities. Recent work in the field has revealed that two or more organelles interact dynamically forming inter-organellar membrane contact sites (MCSs). MCSs are mediated by specific proteins known as tethers. The tethers, which are composed of one or more proteins, often have a specific function at the MCS beyond bringing the organelles into proximity. The interest in MCSs has increased tremendously in recent years as they play a crucial role in important cellular functions such as lipid metabolism, organelle homeostasis, membrane dynamics, cellular stress responses, autophagy, and intracellular cell signaling, including calcium and lipid signaling. In this subgroup, we aim to focus on the latest MCS research. Topics covered will include various aspects relevant to MCSs such as (i) novel mechanisms of inter-organelle contact, (ii) novel MCS functions, (iii) regulation of MCSs under normal and stress conditions and in different cell types, (iv) new technologies for detection and analysis of MCSs. Speakers will cover the latest MCS research across different membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, the plasma membrane, peroxisomes, lipid droplets, and the vacuole/lysosome.\n\nOrganizers: Marcus Taylor, Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology; Meghan Morrissey, University of California Santa Barbara; Minna Roh-Johnson, University of Utah\n\nWe will spotlight how fundamental immune cell biology is driving innovation in cancer immunotherapy. This subgroup will showcase research in immunology covering multiple spatial scales - from molecules to the organism level. We will also highlight how the iterative design and engineering approach of synthetic biology is simultaneously leading therapeutic innovation and revealing fundamental insights into the vertebrate immune system. Invited speakers will cover diverse disciplines, ranging from oncology and immunology to synthetic biology and high-resolution imaging. We aim to invite researchers who may not traditionally identify as cell biologists, with the goal of broadening the scope of inquiry at ASCB, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, and stimulating fresh perspectives in the field of immune cell biology and cancer research. We will explore the following themes: 1) Mechanism of Immune Signaling Pathways and Therapeutics - We will highlight how synthetic biology is revolutionizing the field of immunotherapy by uncovering essential design parameters crucial for enhancing immune responses; 2) Visualizing immune Cell-tumor Interactions in Animal Models - Explore the dynamic interactions between immune cells and tumors through advanced imaging techniques in innovative model systems, providing valuable insights into tumor microenvironments and immune responses at the organismal level; and 3) Biophysical Approaches to Immune Cell Biology - Investigate the biophysical properties of immune cells and their role in cancer immunotherapy, offering novel perspectives on immune cell function and behavior.\n\nOrganizer: Rong Li, Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore\n\nSupported by the Mechanobiology Institute\n\nForces and mechanics impact biological processes across all scales, from molecules to cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms. The interdisciplinary science of mechanobiology aims to uncover fundamental knowledge about how forces are generated in biological systems and the mechanotransduction and signalling processes that direct cellular, tissue, and organ function. This session will bring together researchers to discuss diverse perspectives and approaches of studying mechanobiology. Topics presented will cover the range of biological scales, starting at the molecular level with an interrogation of cytoskeletal components, to cell migration in health and disease, up to the behavior of cell collectives in tissue and organ development.\n\nOrganizers: Jonathan Friedman, UT Southwestern; and Natalie Niemi, Washington University in St. Louis\n\nEukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into membrane-bound organelles, allowing precise spatial and temporal control of metabolic processes. With such compartmentalization comes unique challenges, requiring organelle-specific programs that influence their content and maintenance within various cell types. The learning objective of this session is to explore the mechanisms underlying the synthesis, turnover, and quality control of various eukaryotic organelles and their resident molecules (e.g., lipids or proteins). The target audience of this session is cell biologists with an affinity for organellar biology, or for those seeking to learn more about recent advances in their regulation.\n\nTuesday, December 17 | 8:45 am to 9:45 am\n\nMina Gouti, Max Delbruck Center\n\nDeepak Srivastava, Gladstone Institutes\n\nOrganizers: Mark Chan, San Francisco State University; and Susanne Rafelski, Allen Institute for Cell Science\n\nModern cell biology has made great strides in understanding cell structure and function. Cells also face an important engineering challenge: assembly. How are the complex three-dimensional structures found within the cell specified and regulated by instructions from a one-dimensional genome? In Building the Cell we explore this question, which lies at the interface of biology and physics. This session will be highly interdisciplinary with speakers whose interests span physics, mathematical modeling, biochemistry, cell biology and more. This year the entire subgroup agenda will be based on submitted abstracts.\n\nOrganizers: Lori Hensley, Jacksonville State University; and Nathan Reyna, Ouachita Baptist University\n\nOften, research done at the undergraduate level is appreciated for the experience, which significantly undervalues the quality of research done by undergraduate students. This misconception is further enhanced when the work is conducted at a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). This scientific session aims to highlight the excellent research by undergraduate students and their faculty mentors. From cancer cell culture to cell physiology, an emphasis will be placed on undergraduate students presenting work that contributes to their field of study.\n\nOrganizers: Jadranka Loncarek, NCI/CCR-Frederick; Jennifer Wang, Washington University in St Louis; Kevin O'Connell, National Institutes of Health; and Susana Godinho, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London\n\nNearing the 150th anniversary of the discovery of centrioles and centrosomes, our understanding of their structural complexity and the breadth of their cellular functions is far from complete. Best known for their roles in the organization of the mitotic spindle poles and cilia, centrioles, and centrosomes have recently been shown to play unexpected roles in regulating the cell cycle and remodeling tissue architecture. These exciting new avenues of research have enriched our understanding of how centrosomes and centrioles impact human development and health.\n\nIn this session, we will showcase emerging mechanisms driving centrosome and centriole assembly and discuss the latest breakthroughs in understanding the roles of centrosomes in cell proliferative decisions, how perturbations of their structure and numbers impact tissue remodeling, motility, and signaling, and the roles of centrosomes during development. This session will also address exciting new findings on the roles played by noncanonical (acentriolar) centrosomes in development and disease.\n\nOur session will provide a unique opportunity for researchers inside and outside the field to exchange ideas that will foster collaborations.\n\nOrganizer: Joshua Tran, University of Geneva\n\nCellular membranes serve an indispensable role as the guardians of cellular integrity, selectively regulating the entry and exit of macromolecules to maintain homeostasis. They are not just passive barriers but dynamic platforms for communication, signaling, and interaction both within and outside of the cell, making them crucial for processes such as nutrient uptake, protein and organelle degradation, and signaling cascades. Their importance extends beyond physical boundaries, as they are integral in defining cellular identity, facilitating intercellular communication, and orchestrating the complex biochemical processes that sustain life. In \"Surfing the Surface: Navigating the Waves of Membrane Dynamics\", we will explore how cellular membranes serve as dynamic platforms for essential cellular processes. From endocytosis to cell-cell communication to membrane repair, this subgroup will feature speakers highlighting how macromolecular complexes can use and remodel membranes to facilitate dynamic processes. This subgroup aims to bring together scientists and topics from different backgrounds, from cell signaling to structural biophysics to cell migration. The session provides a unique opportunity for all career stage scientists to explore these highly dynamic interfaces.\n\nOrganizers: Gilbert Di Paolo, Denali Therapeutics Inc\n\nLipid biology has historically been at the forefront of several peripheral disease areas but has only recently come to center stage in neuroscience. This special session will include presentations from key leaders in the field, both from academia and the private sector. They will discuss the role of lipid metabolism and signaling in health and neurological diseases, with a strong emphasis on neurobiology and cutting-edge biochemical, molecular and cell biological approaches to address these fundamental questions. The scientific presentations will be followed by a general panel discussion on how academia and industry can advance this knowledge, outline emerging opportunities and potentially synergize to solve key challenges and accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapies.\n\nTuesday, December 17 | 10:00 am to 11:00 am\n\nEach talk is a 4-minute to 5-minute overview of the presenter’s poster without Q&A. Each Microsymposium session will include 10 Poster Teasers selected from top-scoring abstracts each day across all scientific topics. All Microsymposia speakers must also present a poster.\n\nTuesday, December 17 | 3:15 pm to 4:45 pm\n\nOrganizers: Lindsey Narkchareon, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Foundation - Redwood City, CA; and Sandra Schmid, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco, San Francisco, CA\n\nDedicated to helping scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of this century, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a technology-focused philanthropy aimed at unlocking the mysteries of the cell. CZI provides funding for basic research, builds open source software, and oversees a family of research institutes including the Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging, and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohubs in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. This session will feature talks from key leaders across CZI’s scientific ecosystem about the variety of ways scientists around the world can engage with our work. It will also include a panel discussion by existing CZI or CZ Biohub Network grantees and partners about their experience collaborating, networking, and growing their projects with CZI support.\n\nOrganizer: Shuibing Chen, Weill Cornell Medicine\n\nOrganoids represent a remarkable advancement in biomedical research, offering a revolutionary platform for studying human biology and diseases. These in vitro-grown miniaturized organs faithfully replicate the intricate functional, structural, and biological complexity of their in vivo counterparts. Significant progresses have been made in the derivation, culture, and manipulation of human organoids, utilizing both pluripotent and adult stem cells. In this session, we aim to spotlight the groundbreaking work from scientific pioneers who have spearheaded the development of state-of-the-art human stem cell and organoid models. These models exhibit an extraordinary capacity to mimic complex cellular and tissue phenotypes, holding promise for their integration into organ systems in vivo. Moreover, we will showcase innovative initiatives aimed at creating next-generation disease models, offering invaluable insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of various human diseases.\n\nOrganizers: Kaelyn Sumigray, Yale School of Medicine; and Zachary Smith, Yale School of Medicine\n\nAlthough the core pathways that underly morphogenesis are deeply conserved, how these mechanisms ultimately pattern and organize differentiating cells into functional tissues remains a daunting scientific challenge. Rising single cell and spatial sequencing technologies have enabled unprecedented resolution into the diversity of transcriptional states and responses over the course of animal development. Simultaneously, advancements in microscopy currently enable detailed investigation of dynamic processes from the scale of single molecules to whole organisms. To date, these innovations have largely run in parallel and have not yet established a common language that unifies their distinct perspectives. This session seeks to integrate cellular and genetic definitions of cell state as they control morphogenic processes, including efforts to combine live imaging with single cell genomic data, to track and define single cell behaviors as they shape complex tissues, and to connect transcriptional maps to novel cellular functions. Our session will then end with a panel discussion about the rising potential of these tools to advance our understanding of developmental biology as it scales from the behavior of single genes to the collective realization of complex forms.\n\nOrganizers: Mark Chan, San Francisco State University; and Susanne Rafelski, Allen Institute for Cell Science\n\nModern cell biology has made great strides in understanding cell structure and function.

Physiological and pathological conditions are accompanied by frequent plasma membrane injuries, which are caused by: (i) mechanical wounding in contractile tissues, (ii) chemicals or pore-forming proteins released by pathogens or the immune system during inflammation, or by (III) toxic protein aggregates. The plasma membrane can be rapidly repaired to restore homeostasis; however, plasma membrane injury may also lead to cell death further promoting inflammation. In this session, we will discuss the spatiotemporal dynamics of the molecular machineries that remodel the plasma membrane to reseal the cell and the mechanisms controlling cellular fate downstream from plasma membrane injury.\n\nOrganizers: Andreas Boland, University of Geneva; and Julia Kamenz, University of Groningen\n\nCell division is one of the most fundamental processes of life. Errors during cell division result in the loss or gain of genomic information, and can result in disease development such as cancer. Eukaryotic cells employ sophisticated surveillance mechanisms – so-called cell cycle checkpoints - to monitor the faithful execution of cell cycle processes (e.g., DNA replication, chromosome segregation) and delay or halt cell cycle progression until the impediment has been resolved. Checkpoint satisfaction often links to dramatic, irreversible cell cycle transitions that ensure the unidirectional progression through the cell cycle, usually orchestrated by interlinked positive feedback. Recent developments in high-throughput single cell fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution microscopy (e.g., expansion microscopy, single molecule microscopy), and structural biology of key cell cycle regulators, have catalyzed a multitude of novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of cell cycle control. This subgroup aims to unite researchers leveraging quantitative and structural biological approaches to decode the intricacies of faithful cell proliferation, providing a forum to exchange perspectives on current advancements and future breakthroughs.\n\nTuesday, December 17 | 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm\n\nCarlos Carmona-Fontaine, New York University\n\nJuanita Merchant, University of Arizona\n\nOrganizer: Melissa Gardner, University of Minnesota\n\nPost-translational modifications of the tubulin molecules that comprise microtubules act as labels to alter microtubule-based cellular signaling and cargo trafficking, controllers that regulate the binding of microtubule-associated proteins to microtubules, and can modify that mechanical properties of the microtubules themselves. Further, tubulin post-translational modifications can be dysregulated in disease. In this session, learning objectives will include development of an expanded understanding of microtubule post-translational modifications and their role in a range of important cellular processes. The target audience will include cell biologists, biophysicists, and computational modelers.\n\nOrganizers: Jadranka Loncarek, NCI/CCR-Frederick; Jennifer Wang, Washington University in St Louis; Kevin O'Connell, National Institutes of Health; and Susana Godinho, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London\n\nNearing the 150th anniversary of the discovery of centrioles and centrosomes, our understanding of their structural complexity and the breadth of their cellular functions is far from complete. Best known for their roles in the organization of the mitotic spindle poles and cilia, centrioles, and centrosomes have recently been shown to play unexpected roles in regulating the cell cycle and remodeling tissue architecture. These exciting new avenues of research have enriched our understanding of how centrosomes and centrioles impact human development and health.\n\nIn this session, we will showcase emerging mechanisms driving centrosome and centriole assembly and discuss the latest breakthroughs in understanding the roles of centrosomes in cell proliferative decisions, how perturbations of their structure and numbers impact tissue remodeling, motility, and signaling, and the roles of centrosomes during development. This session will also address exciting new findings on the roles played by noncanonical (acentriolar) centrosomes in development and disease.\n\nOur session will provide a unique opportunity for researchers inside and outside the field to exchange ideas that will foster collaborations.\n\nOrganizer: Daniel Cortes, Virginia Tech\n\nThis session will highlight emerging and unconventional model organisms in the field of cell biology. We will focus on quantitative techniques and data that drive research in these non-standard model organisms. We will also highlight novel perspectives and insights that can be gained from studying unconventional systems. This session is meant to promote a wide-range of topics within the scope of cell biology so long as quantitative approaches are highlighted.\n\nOrganizers: Beata Mierzwa, University of California San Diego; Leonora Martínez-Nuñez, UMass Chan Medical School; and Thomas Mueller-Reichert, Technische Universität Dresden\n\nThis Special Interest Subgroup aims to highlight the impact of artistic practices on scientific research and communication. In this session, scientists and artists will share their experiences exploring this emerging field, discuss avenues to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and highlight its benefits to creative research and scientific exchange. In biology, scientists who used artistic techniques to represent their discoveries have made significant scientific advances. Artistic representations can visualize time and scale in a manner that is easy for viewers to appreciate, thus allowing them to conceptualize scientific research intuitively. Collaborations between scientists and artists can open up new avenues of scientific research by bolstering ideas and concepts and allowing scientists with highly specialized expertise to communicate better with peers in other domains. Beyond their impact on research, such collaborations create artistic works that can be highly valuable for scientific outreach, public engagement, and education, thereby giving new life to work that started as a research-oriented project. Building on the success of the second session of this Special Interest Subgroup in ASCB 2023, we are eager to organize a new session in which speakers with diverse backgrounds and career stages will showcase how science and art can work together and how fostering these interdisciplinary collaborations can have a broad impact on science, art, and society.\n\nOrganizer: Alexander von Appen, Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics\n\nThe endomembrane system of vertebrate cells is dynamically remodeled throughout a cell's lifespan. For example, endomembranes have to be split and reassembled during cell division, during repair in response to spontaneous damage, or during cell differentiation to adapt biological function. Up to this point, it remains vastly unclear how molecular collectives efficiently self-organize across length and time scales to safeguard organelle architecture and function. In this subgroup, we will focus on new insights and approaches that allow us to understand the molecular mechanisms of organelle self-assembly during the lifetime of a cell. A particular focus will be put on cross-scale, cross-disciplinary approaches suitable for integrating structural biology, the physics of living systems, and cell biology.\n\nWednesday, December 18 | 9:00 am to 10:30 am\n\nOrganizers: Don Cleveland, University of California, Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, HHMI Janelia, and Xuebiao Yao, University of Science & Technology of China, Chinese Society for Cell Biology\n\nBiomolecular condensation is emerging as a common biophysical principle underlying many important cellular functions such as membraneless organelle organization, cellular signaling and organelle contacts. This session will bring together scientists from cell biology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, structural biology, developmental biology and polymer physiochemistry to study biomolecular condensation in biology and disease.The goals of this session are to: 1) increase our understanding of the physiological relevance of biomolecular condensation in diversified biological processes; 2) explore the large repertoire of new tools and methods that can be applied to study the phenomenon of biomolecular condensation; 3) provide transdisciplinary training to tackle the role of biomolecular condensation in cell biology. Session topics will include mechanisms of biomolecular; membraneless compartments in the cell, biomolecular condensation in cellular quality control, and emerging technologies for studying intrinsically disordered proteins\n\nOrganizers: Courtney Schroeder, UT Southwestern Medical Center; Holly Goodson, University of Notre Dame; Masayuki Onishi, Duke University; Michael McMurray, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; and Michelle Momany, University of Georgia\n\nEvolutionary cell biology (ECB) has two complementary aspects: One uses the perspectives and methods of evolutionary biology to gain insight into cell biological processes; the other uses the biology and diversity of cells to gain insight into the process of evolution. These different perspectives are united by the fact that cells are the fundamental unit of life and by the expectation that the study of ECB will illuminate the diversity of life at (sub)cellular scales and help elucidate the fundamental principles of living systems. Because cells and cellular processes lie at the interface between chemistry, physics, and biology, biophysics and biochemistry have central roles in ECB. Speakers will address topics across the range of ECB, with possible examples including the use of patterns of protein evolution to dissect protein structure and function, the study of comparative cell biology to illuminate the characteristics of the last universal (or eukaryotic) common ancestor, and the application of biophysics to elucidate the role of physical mechanisms in determining phenotype.\n\nOrganizers: Chenshu Liu, University of California, Berkeley; Needhi Bhalla, University of California, Santa Cruz; and Soni Lacefield, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth\n\nMeiosis, the specialized cell division cycle that generates haploid gametes from diploid progenitors, is a highly complex process that uses a variety of mechanisms to ensure the fidelity of gametes. For germ cells to differentiate and to develop into mature gametes, unique programs must be executed precisely in space and time so that the genome can reorganize and errors in doing so can be timely detected and corrected. These include DNA double strand break and repair, chromosome movement, gene expression, post-translational modification, phase separation, and mechanotransduction. Accordingly, the complexity of the meiosis provides unique opportunities for impacting many cell biology fields, including cell dynamics, cell signaling, genome stability, epigenetics and mechanobiology. Emergent principles and new technologies have fueled many exciting recent developments in the meiosis field. This is a recurring Subgroup that has garnered great interest last year, aiming to promote exchange of ideas in the field as well as cross-pollination amongst the international cell biology community attending Cell Bio 2024. In this Subgroup, we will deep-dive into the frontiers of the emerging mechanisms in germ cell biology and discuss how diversity arises among eukaryotes. To mirror the diverse and dynamic nature of the field of meiosis, we will highlight presentations given by early career scientists especially trainees and/or those from historically underrepresented or excluded groups.\n\nOrganizers: Katerina Akassoglou, Gladstone Institutes, UCSF\n\nEmerging evidence supports the role of the neuro-immune axis as a determinant of brain physiology and disease. This Special Interest Group focuses on the latest advances in emerging cellular and molecular mechanisms at the brain-immune interface that affect cognition, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration in the CNS. This Special Interest Group will intersect scientific areas of immune and glial cell biology, the blood-brain barrier, aging, neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Emphasis will be placed on innovative multiomic technologies, imaging, machine learning, and genome engineering that drive basic discoveries and therapeutics. The Special Interest Group will feature therapeutic strategies targeting neuroimmune mechanisms in neurological diseases. The target audience will be cell biologist, immunologists, neuroscientists and neuroimmunologists with interest in the blood-brain-immune interface studying CNS function and dysfunction and developing therapeutic strategies for neurologic diseases.\n\nOrganizers: John Hammer, National Institutes of Health; and Xufeng Wu, National Institutes of Health\n\nOrganoids are three-dimensional, stem cell-driven tissue models that are amenable to structure: function analyses using powerful tools like super resolution imaging and genome editing. Organoids can be used to study fundamental aspects of epithelial cell biology like cell division and cell extrusion in the context of a tissue like structure. Organoids can also be used to model tissue morphogenesis and regeneration, and they can be engineered to serve as disease models and used for drug screens. The goal of this special interest subgroup is to introduce the power of organoids to cell biologists who might like to work with a system that is more physiological than 2D cell culture.\n\nOrganizers: Edward Avezov, University of Cambridge, UK Dementia Research Institute; Elena Koslover, University of California San Diego, La Jolla; and Jonathon Nixon-Abell, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle that plays an important role in cellular processes ranging from protein quality control to calcium signaling to lipid distribution. The complex architecture of the ER, comprising stacks of perinuclear sheets interconnected with a network of hollow tubules stretching throughout the cell, helps to support these varied functions. Recent advancements in genetic and imaging techniques have unveiled the critical importance of ER structure and dynamics in brain cell performance, where it forms a cornerstone of neuronal and astrocytic activity and plasticity. This session aims to dissect the structure - function interplay of the ER, with an emphasis on its role in neuronal and supporting cells. Key questions to be addressed include: How does the ER’s structural complexity support diverse brain cell functions, and what mechanisms underlie its morphological regulation? How do alterations in ER morphology impact cellular health and contribute to disease states? How does ER network structure emerge and what is its impact on the formation of structural subdomains and interactions with other organelles? By integrating insights from biochemistry, cellular and neuronal biology, biophysics, and genetics, the session will catalyze multidisciplinary dialogue and chart a course towards a holistic understanding of the ER's contribution to cellular health in general, and brain cell function in particular.\n\nWednesday, December 18 | 10:45 am to 11:45 am\n\nIbrahim Cissé, Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics\n\nAmy Gladfelter, Duke University\n\n(D/S) - denotes sessions designed to bridge the gap between discovery-based and solution-oriented topics. These sessions aim to translate how groundbreaking scientific discoveries play a role in real-world applications."
