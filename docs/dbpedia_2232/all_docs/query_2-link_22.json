Morpheus supports the simulation and statistical analysis of (stochastic) spatial cell-based models coupled bi-directionally with ordinary differential equations, reaction-diffusion systems and SBML models. It allows rapid development of multiscale models in biological terms and mathematical expressions rather than programming code. Its graphical user interface supports the entire workflow from model construction and simulation to visualization, archiving and batch processing. For example SBML models can be imported as intra-cellular submodels into existing spatial tissue models. Morpheus is open-source (https://gitlab.com/morpheus.lab/morpheus) and pre-compiled installers are available for Mac/Win/Linux. AMICI 0.11.8 Latest submission Website AMICI provides a multi-language (Python, C++, Matlab) interface for the SUNDIALS solvers CVODES (for ordinary differential equations) and IDAS (for algebraic differential equations). AMICI allows the user to read differential equation models specified as SBML and automatically compiles such models as .mex simulation files (Matlab), C++ executables or Python modules. In contrast to the (no longer maintained) sundialsTB Matlab interface, all necessary functions are transformed into native C++ code, which allows for a significantly faster simulation. Beyond forward integration, the compiled simulation file also allows for forward sensitivity analysis, steady state sensitivity analysis and adjoint sensitivity analysis for likelihood based output functions. The interface was designed to provide routines for efficient gradient computation in parameter estimation of biochemical reaction models but it is also applicable to a wider range of differential equation constrained optimization problems.
