        "text": "Flint is a simulator for biological and physiological models written in CellML, PHML, and/or SBML. Originally developed as part of an in silico platform of Physiome, now it aims to provide an open, language-agnostic resource for reproducible simulation studies. While existing simultion tools, e.g. COPASI and OpenCOR, are great for simulation of models in a specific language, you may find Flint useful if searching a unified solution.\n\nFlint has the following features:\n\nIt can numerically solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations derived from models.\n\nIt runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.\n\nIt provides fully-featured graphical user interface with simplified command-line interface.\n\nIt is open source under the MIT license.\n\nPlease feel free to submit an issue on Flint's GitHub Issues for bugs or feature requests that you come up with when using Flint. For any question or suggestion about Flint, send an email to the author or to the official mailing list if you prefer open, transparent communication."
