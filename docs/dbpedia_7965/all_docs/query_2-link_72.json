        "text": "by Jason Adams\n\nA couple of weeks ago I told y'all about Luca Guadagnino's next film project, a feature based off of Bob Dylan's 1975 album Blood on the Tracks that he plans to make with Chloe Grace Moretz. Well Luca, never one to rest on them laurels of his, has sneaked in a totally seperate project while we weren't looking (or rather while we were gaping at the exploding heads of his Suspiria coven), much to my thrill. He's gone and directed a 35-minute short film slash \"memory piece\" for the fashion house Valentino that will star Kyle MacLachlan and Julianne Moore, along with Marthe Keller, KiKi Layne, Mia Goth (aka the secret MVP of Suspiria), and Alba Rohrwacher. Here's how it's described in Variety:\n\n\"Moore plays Francesca, an Italian-American writer who lives in New York and must return to Rome – and, by extension, her childhood – to retrieve her aging mother, a painter played at different ages by Keller and Goth. Layne plays “the spark that triggers the stream of consciousness in Francesca,” said Guadagnino, while Rohrwacher plays “a grande dame at a party. ”All the male characters – “fathers, lovers, servants,” Guadagnino noted – are played by MacLachlan.\"\n\nMaking a short-film for a fashion house probably isn't the best way for Luca to combat last week's criticism from the original Suspiria's director Dario Argento that he \"makes beautiful tables, beautiful curtains, beautiful dishes, all beautiful…\" but Luca gonna Luca (and bless him for it, quite honestly). The short was shot by Call Me By Your Name and Suspiria DP Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and the soundtrack is from Oscar-winner Ryuichi Sakamoto, and the plan is for it to hit legitimate film fests so stay tuned, fabulousness ahead.\n\nI actually love it when genuine film artists due one off corporate films like that. The thing is corporations are always going to advertise their wares so why not do it through an artistic lens and give paychecks to artists who then come up with things that are more than commercials. I'm thinking of how fun those BMW series of short films were. Some real gems from awesome filmmakers that I'm sure they were paid handsomely for."
