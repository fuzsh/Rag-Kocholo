Swiss actress Marthe Keller, who was in New York promoting her new United Artists film, 'The Formula,' is tired of being thought of as just a beautiful actress. 'I don't like being a plant in a hotel room to make it look better,' she told UPI.

'You know when the press interviews male actors they always ask how the actor liked the part but when they interview women actresses they always ask 'how's your personal life,'' she said. She describes her co-stars in the film, George C. Scott and Marlon Brando, as 'the heaviest of the heavy weight actors. Thank God I have no scene with Brando. He kills you. When he is on the screen nobody looks at you, they all look at Brando,' she said.
