        "text": "Description\n\nThe four-deck motor vessel Maxim Gorky built in 1974 was refurbished in 2020 to become a luxurious 5-star vessel. With a length of 110 metres and a width of 14.5, it can accommodate 86 passengers. The interior design was inspired by the Siberian landscape.\n\nMaxim Gorky's cabins have been created with every little detail in mind. They are a mix of comfort and luxury, with unique furniture, sumptuous furnishings and large windows offering an extraordinary view of the surrounding nature. On board, in addition to restaurants and bars, there is a spa, a fitness room and a library. The ship is equipped with modern navigation facilities and travels at a speed of up to 22 km per hour (13.7 MpH).\n\nGiorgia Lombardo"
