        "text": "Vodohod, a Russian river cruise line, has ordered a pair of expedition cruise ships from Helsinki Shipyard.\n\nThe deal was signed last week and the ships will be delivered in August 2021 and January 2022, according to a statement.\n\nThe yard was recently sold to a new owner, Algador Holdings. The company is owned by Rishat Bagautdinov and Vladimir Kasyanenko, who also own Vodohod.\n\nThe vessels will have capacity for 148 guests and are being built at a cost of $115 million each.\n\n“We are very proud and happy for the first order of the new shipyard and I believe this now proves to everyone that we have started a new chapter in the operation of Helsinki Shipyard. We will strengthen especially our design department in the near future and in connection with the start of production,” said Carl-Gustaf Rotkirch, CEO of Helsinki Shipyard Oy, in a prepared statement.\n\nVodohod owns and operates 25 river cruise boats, nine speed boats, and five pleasure boats, all on Russian waterways."
