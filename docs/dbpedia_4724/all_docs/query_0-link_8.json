The vessels are intented to operate in high latitude areas both in the Arctic and Antarctic waters as well as in the tropical waters during the Spring and Autumn seasons.\n\nThe design work for the project has already started at Helsinki Shipyard Oy. The first vessel is planned to be delivered in August 2021 and the second vessel in January 2022.\n\nThe vessels measure abt. 110 metres in length and 20 meters in breadth. The vessels will have an ice class PC6. The passenger capacity will be 148 persons and the maximum number of crew onboard will be 110 persons.\n\n“We are very proud and happy for the first order of the new shipyard and I believe this now proves to everyone that we have started a new chapter in the operation of Helsinki Shipyard. We will strengthen especially our design department in the near future and in connection with the start of production, also our production department. We invite everyone interested to contact our human resources department.” Says Carl-Gustaf Rotkirch, CEO of Helsinki Shipyard Oy.\n\nVodohod is a Russian cruise company and river cruise line operator, founded in 2004 by the Volga Shipping Company and named after Ivan Kulibin’s “water-going vessel” or “water-goer”.
