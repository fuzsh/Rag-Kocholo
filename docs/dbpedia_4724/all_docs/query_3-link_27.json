The Kremlin as we know it today was rebuilt as a stone structure during the beginning of the 14th century but the actual site has been inhabited and used as a fortified city wall for centuries before this period. The Kremlin is truly a fascinating structure - at the same time it is an ancient tower, the city's former military fortification, a palace and the workplace of the Russian President. The Kremlin is the center of Russia's political life and State power and has been home to Tsars, General Secretaries of the Soviet Union and Russian Presidents.\n\nDay 3\n\nUglich: You will be taken on a walking city tour with visit to the Kremlin, the Church of St. Demitrius on the Blood and the Transfiguration cathedral.\n\nDay 4\n\nArrival in the ancient village of Goritsy.

Here you will visit a fascinating open-air museum containing numerous examples of elaborate Russian, wooden architecture.\n\nDay 6\n\nA stop in the village of Mandrogui.

This tour is the best way to get acquainted with all of the city's major highlights. Our professional guide will take you down Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's most famous and vibrant thoroughfare. There you will see some of the city's most interesting architectural monuments including the Kazan Cathedral (exterior) and the Winter Palace. You will see the Peter and Paul Fortress (interior) - a symbol of St. Petersburg and also the oldest building in the city.\n\nOne of the highlights of your entire cruise will be a visit to the Hermitage, Russia's premier museum containing one of the largest art collections in the world. The museum consists of five historical buildings including the Winter Palace - the residence of the Russian Tsars. The museum contains over 3 million pieces of art with dates ranging from high antiquity to the present day. Among the Hermitage's treasures are artworks by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens and many others.\n\nOn the last day of your cruise you will say goodbye to Russia, your ship's crew and the many new friends we are sure you will have met during your time with us.
