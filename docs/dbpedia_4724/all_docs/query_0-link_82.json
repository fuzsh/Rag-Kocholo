        "text": "Cruise line Operators and the Cruise Ships\n\nThis is a pretty good list of current Cruise line Operators and the Cruise Ships they own or operate. The cruiseline business is incestuous. Many ships operate or have operated under many names, many ships are owned by one company and subleased or operated by two companies. Sometimes it can be confusing. Elite Cruises and Travel makes your traveling a breeze and can recommend a cruise for you.\n\nContact Us to book any of the ships or cruise lines listed at 877-294-4053\n\nIf you would like us to locate a ship on which you have cruised in the past, so you may once again cruise on it, let us know. Many ships have had many names. We have grouped together divisions of some of the largest operators such as Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean.\n\nGiven the current worldwide cruise situation, this list may not be current. The industry is in constant flux and several lines have either gone out of business or are in the process of selling or scrapping ships. Feel free to contact us for specific information.\n\nMass-market lines offer good product at affordable prices. Fares range from $50-300 (Inside-Suite) pp per day.
