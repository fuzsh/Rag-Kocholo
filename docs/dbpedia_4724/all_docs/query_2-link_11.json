        "text": "April 26, 2011\n\nThe prospects of regular passenger boat cruises have been discussed today in the administration of the Novgorod region.\n\nThe Novgorod Region possesses a lot of water resources, which are not used to the full extent. It is necessary to organize regular passenger and cruise lines on the rivers and lakes of the region. Such climate prevailed today at the expanded meeting in the administration of the region, dedicated to the development of tourism.\n\nThe event was attended by the representatives of construction involved in building and repairing of river passenger ships. They made presentations on the topic. Thus, the general director of group of companies \"GAMA\" (Nizhny Novgorod) Dmitry Galkin reported on prospects of development of water tourism with the usage of small size vessel and made a proposal to use passenger cruise ships designed by his company for the organization of tourist routes on the rivers of the Novgorod region. As an example he cited the possibility of organizing a cruise from St. Petersburg to Novgorod. According to him, the proposed vessels have a small draft (80 cm), so they are suitable for usage on small rivers. Capacity of such vessel  40 people.\n\nThe representative of the similar company, general director of company \"Aquatoria\" (Veliky Novgorod), in his turn, suggested more economical and spacious small size vessels - catamarans for 50 and 100 seats, which can be used as a scheduled passenger ships on the directions Veliky Novgorod - Saint- Petersburg and Veliky Novgorod  Moscow. Value of the vessel with 100 seats in complete set is 78 million rubles.\n\nIn general, the administration sets hopes on the involvement of water resources in the development of tourism of the Novgorod region. Previously, officials have discussed the necessity for the organization of cruises, parking lots for private boats and marinas, which should attract tourists from abroad. One of the main obstacles in this area can be a quite complicated border regime.\n\nApril 22, 2011\n\nTransport infrastructure of the Leningrad region needs investment within the framework of PPP\n\nThe Leningrad region needs modern transportation arteries that allow organizing the transportation of both cargo and passengers. This was announced during the Council meeting on sea and transport activities of the Government of the Leningrad Region by Vice Governor Nikolai Pasyada.\n\nIn addition, business representatives agree to invest funding in the development of water tourism and infrastructure development only in terms of public-private partnership. \"Private business can offer to share the harbor with state structures and it is ready to invest funding in infrastructure, for example in the Kirishi area (that opens a way to Veliky Novgorod), but implementation of these projects is possible if it is based on public-private partnership\", - said General Director of LLC The Russian yachting Denis Denisov. According to him, namely the lack of infrastructure for small ships and yachts - fuel stations, piers, pass channels - is a limiting factor for development of domestic water tourism.\n\n\"We need a regional program, which would indicate the points of development of the small fleet and water transport infrastructure\" - expressed his opinion Development Director of LLC Inter Yacht Service Denis Sinochkin. He stated that the organization of passenger and excursion traffic on the Neva River in the area of the region it is necessary to have budgetary subsidies, otherwise transportation for residents will be too expensive. Council suggested the Committee on Transport and transport infrastructure to take into account the proposals to create conditions for the work of investors.\n\nApril 18, 2011\n\nMinsportturizm: tourism gave only 3% of GDP\n\nThe volume of domestic tourist traffic in Russia in the past year amounted to 32 million people, the number is very small, and this figure should be increased, Deputy Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy Nadezhda Nazina said at a meeting of the Public Council on the preparation of the Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nThe industry grew during the year by just 1%. Its share in GDP, taking into account the multiplier effect was 6.5%, of which 3% is pure tourism.\n\nThe most active flow is to the Black Sea coast, it has grown by 12% (up to 10,5 million people). Nazina recognized that, in comparison with popular among Russians resorts of Egypt and Turkey, Russian leisure industry lacks hospitality. The Deputy Minister urged to improve the quality of service, to revive the practice of travel agencies, to develop public-private partnerships in the industry.\n\nThis year, the target programme for development of domestic tourism has launched in Russia, it involves increasing the number of people employed in this area from 1 million to 2.5 million. 7 billion rubles is allocated to the programme.\n\nIn October Nazina expressed the hope that by 2016 Russia will be able to take more than 40 million foreigners and to provide 50 million citizens with travel services.\n\nApril 14, 2011\n\nMoscow is preparing a tourism development programme priced at $ 9 billion rubles\n\nLong-term tourism development programme in the period of 2012-2016 of the cost of 9 billion rubles will be accepted by the Government of Moscow in the near future, said the chairman of the Tourism Committee of Moscow Sergey Shpilko at a board meeting of Minsportturizm.\n\n\"The programme should be adopted in the coming weeks. The budget is 3.5 billion rubles of the nine billion, but we're still going to work on these figures. In a year it will be necessary to make adjustments to this program. Its purpose is not merely to hold the World Cup in 2018 perfectly well in Moscow, but to make Moscow a popular modern tourist center. We understand that this is an ambitious goal, but we need to work on it, \"- said Shpilko, without specifying the timeframe for the new programme.\n\nHe noted that now the Committee on Tourism is preparing the city for the tourist season.\n\n\"We want to upgrade the tourist street orientation systems before the beginning of the season. It is planned to open a call-center, at least on an emergency in foreign languages for tourists, to solve a very difficult problem with the parking of tourist buses, \"- stated Shpilko.\n\nAccording to him, over the past years, Moscow has opened 27 large hotel complexes for 4,5 thousand rooms.\n\n\"We are doing everything to bring up the low-budget component of the hotel complex. Every day we hold meetings with investors, fighting for the site. We have investors, the problem is connected mainly to the territories\", - told the Shpilko.\n\nHe noted that Moscow tourist industry has not yet returned to pre-crisis level of 2008.\n\nInvestment in fixed assets are decreased by 36%. Tax situation is very complicated - the decline is of almost 40%, compared to pre-crisis level. The growth of foreign travel is also very low. Increase of the volume of paid services is many times lower than the increase of the number of trips. It means that the amount of travel increases and the tourist industry no longer earns. Tourist industry has never been in such a bad situation as it is today. Series of events that began with the crisis, has led many companies to serious condition. Moreover, Im talking about companies that have never found themselves in such a difficult situation before\"- said Shpilko.\n\nApril 13, 2011\n\nAmendments to the law on tourism will be made before July\n\nThe work on the draft of a bill on making amendments and supplements to the law on tourist activity is almost done. It is planned to introduce the draft to the parliament in the spring session of 2011, i.e. before July. This was announced at yesterday's meeting of the CCI Committee of enterprising development in the sphere of tourism by Yuri Barzykin.\n\n\"New powers of regional authorities in the sphere of tourism development are included in the legislation as a single line -\"creation of conditions for tourism development.\" Local authorities have no tool for this activity; certain powers and rights are prescribed, but not specified. We reveal the concept of creation of conditions for tourism development in the bill\", - said the Head of the Department of Tourism Ludmila Goltseva. According to her, now, the regions are sending changes, additions, suggestions on the bill to the Ministry. Yuri Barzykin added that his proposals have been already made by Buryatia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Moscow and the Moscow region.\n\nAccording to Lyudmila Goltseva, key determinations included in the draft, which are not connected with the division of powers in the sphere of tourism, are related to certification of guides and interpreters. In her opinion, it is expedient to follow the same path as it is done with the certification of accommodation facilities. \"The order of certification of hotels defined by decree, approved by the Ministry of Justice. Also, an order for the accreditation of organizations that conduct certification appeared. It is necessary to do the same with the certification of guides and interpreters. We have many compellations that the certification is completely different in different regions. People write to us complaining that tour guides are not allowed in museums, because they are not accredited in the region. We want to make guides certificated by the same rules so that they could work on any route, if they have the appropriate certification, \"- said Goltseva.\n\nYuri Barzykin highlighted the most important moments, referred in the bill to the powers of federal bodies of tourist authority. They are the protection of rights and security of tourists, the development of laws in the sphere of tourism, maintaining a register of tour operators, the definition of rules of selling tourism products, development of standards in the tourism, hotel certification and accreditation of interpreters and tour guides, the determination of the content of statistical reporting forms in the sphere of tourism industry. As a result of the meeting, the members of the committee of CCI on entrepreneurship in the sphere of tourism supported the bill.\n\nMarch 29, 2011\n\nPulkovo and Moscow Railway Station will be connected by express tramway in St. Petersburg\n\nExpress tramway will start making trips for convenience of numerous tourists in St. Petersburg in 2013.

A range of measures is necessary for creation of the cruise center on the international level: bottom dredging and bank pitching, prolongation of the main dock, reconstruction and expansion of the marine passenger terminal, installation of the crossing point in the passenger section of the port of Murmansk.\n\nSome other projects connected to development of the cruise tourism in the Murmansk region, were also presented at the meeting.\n\nBy results of the session it was decided to continue joint work for development of the cruise tourism between the two countries and include the considered projects into the international programme IESP-PS Kolarctic that aims at development of collaboration of the regions of the North-West of Russia with Norway, Northern Finland and Sweden in different directions of collaboration on the border territories.\n\nJanuary 24, 2011\n\nNew ferry line will open between St. Petersburg and Stockholm\n\nOpening of the direct ferry line between St. Petersburg and Stockholm in April will allow increasing the tourist flow from Russia to Sweden by 15-25% compared to 2010, as Director of the representative office of Visit Sveden, state company dealing with tourism in Sweden, in the Russian Federation Alexander Panko reported.\n\nBesides, if in the beginning 70% of passengers of this ferry will be Russians, by the end of this year it is expected that the share of Swedish passengers will increase from 30 to 50%. This means that the Swedes will visit Russia more actively as tourists,  Alexander Panko noticed.\n\nHe also added that the new advertising campaign that will soon start in Russia, will contribute to increase of the tourist flow to Sweden and the budget allocated by the Swedes for promotion of their country in Russia, will grow many times compared to the previous year.\n\nDecember 13, 2010\n\nMarine Facade will handle 550 thousand passengers in 2011\n\nPassenger port Marine Facade (St. Petersburg) will handle 380 thousand cruise passengers and 170 thousand ferry lines passengers, as commercial director of JSC Passenger port St. Petersburg Marine Facade Andrey Fyodorov reported on Monday.\n\nHe said that 7 quays that will handle 12-13 thousand passengers daily will open in the port in spring 2011.\n\nProject for construction of the marine passenger terminal and development of the western part of the Vasilyevsky island provides appearance of new territories with the total area of 476 hectares that will locate not only marine passenger terminal, but social objects and residential and commercial property as well.

The passenger terminal will be capable of handling about 12 thousand tourists daily (above 1,5 mln passengers annually).\n\nThe terminal is expected to bring about 56 mln dollars in the citys budget annually.\n\nConstruction of all the phases of the new passenger port of St. Petersburg will be completed in 2011.\n\nDecember 3, 2010\n\nPresident of Intourist called for strengthening of supervisory functions of Rostourism\n\nAt the conference Tourist business in Russia held by the newspaper Vedomosti, President of Intourism Alexander Arutyunov called for strengthening of supervisory functions of Rostourism. He underlined necessity of increasing of the tourism market transparency and reminded of Kapital Tour that admitted its incapacity to fulfill its obligations to clients.\n\nOn November 19 the First Deputy Chairman of the Committee of the State Duma for Economic Policy and Entrepreneurship Vladimir Golovnyov suggested granting Rostourism the right to suspend activities of the tour operator in case of financial problems that may result in default on obligations to clients.\n\nHe asserted that the situation with Kapital Tour showed that even large companies may face financial difficulties that will result in suspense of rendering services. This raises the issue not only of social responsibility of business but also of the increasing role of the state in provision of security for the citizens acquiring such services,  Mr Golovnyov concluded.\n\nDecember 1, 2010\n\nPassports will checked on river vessels of the Leningrad region\n\nThe North-Western Department of Internal Affairs on transport demands passport data from the tourists traveling by the river vessels of the Leningrad region.\n\nHead of the Line Department of Internal Affairs on sea and river transport of the North-Western Department of Internal Affairs on transport of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Aleksey Denisov suggested addressing the Ministry of Transport of Russia with this question. Today we havent got passport data of the people, who travel by ships. Among them there may be persons who are on the wanted list. Thats why we should possess their passport data,  explained Aleksey Denisov. Besides, he claimed that while servicing the riverside station within the city the issue on possibility for checking the citizens by policemen should be resolved on the legislation level as a passenger security measure.\n\nThese initiatives will be submitted to the Ministry of Transport by December 30.\n\nNovember 19, 2010\n\nMedvedev ordered regional governments to support tourism development\n\nThe President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev signed a federal law according to which creation of favourable conditions for tourism development in the subject of the Russian Federation is a task of regional governments, as press service of the Kremlin reported on Friday.\n\nExplanatory note of the draft law informed that absence of such norm in legislation hampers development of tourism and tourist industry in the subjects of the Russian Federation, including complex development of infrastructure and creation of additional jobs. It also doesnt allow to implement planning and expenditure of money from relevant budgets and search for other funding sources within the frames of medium- and long-term forecasting with account for regional opportunities which hampers development of the respective territory.\n\nNovember 18, 2010\n\nGovernment of Kamchatka will develop eco-tourism in the region\n\nGovernment of Kamchatka started working out a regional programme for development of eco-tourism on natural areas of preferential protection of regional significance. The programme will provide complex construction of infrastructure for allocation and supervision of tourists.\n\nKamchatka holds the first position among Russian regions in total square of reserves, including offshore zone, and the second position in natural parks square.\n\nThe largest natural area of preferential protection of regional significance in the Kamchatsky krai is natural park Volcanoes of Kamchatka with the area of 2,5 million hectares. It includes natural parks Nalychevsky, Bystrinsky, Klyuchevski and Yuzhno-Kamchatsky.\n\nNumerous unique natural complexes, suitable for organization of environment, scientific, ethnographic and extreme tourism are located on the territory of the natural park Volcanoes of Kamchatka. 15  20 thousand tourists visit the park annually. Not only relevant infrastructure should be created, but a complex approach to development of the territories and effective management of tourist flows should be applied for eco-tourism development. Volumes and sources of funding of the programme are not announced yet.\n\nNovember 17, 2010\n\n2 billion roubles will be invested into Baikal harbour in 2011\n\n2 billion roubles will be allocated for creation of the infrastructure of special tourist zone Baikal harbour in Buryatia in 2011. 76% of the sum will be invested from the federal budget and the rest of money will be granted by the Republics budget.\n\nThis will allow to complete creation of infrastructure of the two sections of the tourist zone  Turka and Peski.\n\nSpecial tourist zone Baikal harbour is created on the eastern coast of Baikal 150-180 km from Ulan-Ude and consists of five separate sections.

Nine residents are already registered here.\n\nNovember 16, 2010\n\nGovernor of the Novgorod region intends to increase tourism profitability for the regions economy\n\nShare of tourism in GDP of the Novgorod region comprises 1,5% and with account for multiplier effect it is 4-7%, as experts believe. These are very low figures, as governor of the Novgorod region Sergey Mitin reported.\n\nSuch low profitability of the tourist industry in the region is caused by the fact that tourists dont visit Novgorod more than for one day,  he said.\n\nHe considers that guests of the Novgorod region are weekend tourists. Travellers come on weekends and practically all hotels are occupied, thus, tour operators work out routes without spending a night in Velikiy Novgorod.\n\nWe prepare a strategy allowing tourists to stay in the city for a longer period of time. Increasing tourism profitability for the regions economy is a very important task for us,  the governor claimed.\n\nNovember 15, 2010\n\nMinistry of sports and tourism considered prospects of tourism development in the region\n\nGovernment of the Ivanovo region announced tourism development to be one of the priority tasks of domestic and foreign policy of the region, besides, the long term programme Tourism development in the Ivanovo region in 2009-2011, which provides creation of health tourist recreational cluster Plyos, is being implemented now. In April 2010 tourism department of the government of the region was created. It coordinates the process of development of the tourist potential of the region in all aspects of business and community activities. One of important tasks of the department is monitoring of the process of realization and optimization of the regional long term target programme.\n\nIn July by the decree of the government of the Russian Federation ¹1230 a strategy of the federal target programme Development of domestic and incoming tourism in the Russian Federation (2011-2016) was adopted.\n\nAccording to the decision of the Expert Council for examination of investment projects, the project of health tourist recreational cluster Plyos passed expertise and was recommended to the Ministry of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy of the Russian Federation for inclusion into the Federal Target Programme.\n\nToday department of tourism of the government of the region carries out preparation of documents necessary for inclusion of the project into the programme. Private investors and volume of allocations from the regional budget for the events implementation within the project are determined.\n\nNovember 13, 2010\n\nCitizens of border areas of Norway and Russia will cross the border without visas\n\nIn the nearest future an agreement between Russia and Norway on border visa free crossing for citizens of 30 km frontier area between the countries will be submitted to the State Duma for adoption, as Department of information policy and media relations of the government of the Murmansk region reported.\n\nTwo years ago Norway established maritime visas  multi visas for 5 years for citizens of the Murmansk and Archangelsk regions and the Nenets Autonomous District. The citizens who have already visited Norway and havent broken the visa regime, may address the Consulate General to get a visa.\n\nThe Department of information policy of the government of the Murmansk region reported that the Agreement on simplification of order of trips of citizens of border territories of Russia and Norway and Common announcement on strengthening of border collaboration were signed on November 1 in Oslo within the framework of the second ministerial meeting of Northern Dimension by Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Russia and Norway Sergey Lavrov and Jonas Store.\n\nGovernor of the Murmansk region Dmitry Dmitrienko called the agreement on border visa free crossing by the citizens of border areas logic continuance of the historic treaty on delimitation of disputed territories between the two countries. The treaty was signed in September this year in Murmansk by the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister of Norway Jens Stoltenberg, as the official portal of the government of the Murmansk region reports.\n\nNovember 12, 2010\n\nPeter the First coming back\n\nSt. Petersburg yacht Peter the First that was the first yacht in the history to cruise around the Arctic in one season, will arrive at the Lieutenant Shmidt embankment on Sunday.\n\nToday the yacht is to pass the frontier post in Ust-Luga, as the organizing committee reported at the ceremony of meeting Peter the First.\n\nThe world cruise with participation of the yacht started on June 4. During the five month cruise around the Arctic the vessel travelled about 12,5 thousand marine miles.\n\nNovember 11, 2010\n\nFederation Council adopted the draft law on accretion of power of regional authorities in tourism sphere\n\nFederation Council supported the law that includes creation of favourable conditions for tourism development in the subjects of the Russian Federation into the range of tasks of regional administration.\n\nHead of the committee for regional policy Rafgat Altynbayev asserts that absence of this norm in the legislation doesnt contribute to tourism development in the RF subjects.\n\nThe draft law, adopted on Wednesday, on November 10, 2010, is submitted to the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev for endorsement. Thus, after the document is signed and published, the legislative basis for tourism development on federal, regional and municipal levels will be created.\n\nDeputy Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy of the Russian Federation Nadezhda Nazina reported earlier that these amendments would allow regional administration to develop tourism.\n\nRegions couldnt provide funding for tourism development, because it was considered to be inappropriate expenditure of budget funds, Ms Nazina said earlier.\n\nToday she believes that amendments will contribute to tourism development on the regional level.\n\nNovember 10, 2010\n\nKaliningrad tour operators are against the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation\n\nThe association of tourist industry enterprises of the Kaliningrad region is against the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to cancel short-term visas for foreign tourists coming to the Kaliningrad region for two days.\n\nTour operators addressed governor of the Kaliningrad region Nikolay Tsukanov, the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev and the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin for support. Tour operators claim that short-term visas allow Kaliningrad travel agencies to attract thousands of foreign tourists who are ready to go on an excursion to the Russian exclave during their tour in the South Baltic.\n\nExpert from Kaliningrad Vladimir Abramov believes that actions of Russian diplomats are contradictory. On the one hand, Russia supports visa free regime with the European Union and on the other hand, the countrys initiative is to harden its border crossing. The politologist considers that in order to demonstrate good will, visa regime should be cancelled for citizens of the European Union coming to Kaliningrad.\n\nNovember 9, 2010\n\nFinland will issue about 1 mln visas to Russians in 2010\n\nFinland will issue about 1 mln visas to Russians this year, as President of the country Tarja Halonen claimed.\n\nThis year we will issue about 1 mln visas to the Russian citizens,  Ms Halonen said at the press conference after meeting the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday in Moscow.\n\nSpeaking about the issue of visa free regime between Russia and the European Union, the President of Finland noticed that the country supports introduction of such a regime in future and today it makes every effort to issue European visas to the Russians as soon as possible.\n\nMs Halonen added that the major number of visas that Finland issues to the Russians are multi-visas. She admitted that to cancel visa regime between Russia and the European Union, all interested parties should work out practical steps for fulfillment of this task taking into consideration all necessary conditions, including safety requirements.\n\nNovember 8, 2010\n\nStrategy for tourism development will appear in the Primorsky krai\n\nA strategy for tourism development will appear in the Primorsky krai in the nearest future. The project of the strategy is submitted to governor Sergey Darkin for consideration.\n\nThe strategy provides aims, tasks and priorities of tourism development, which government structures and local government authorities will take into consideration while implementing the policy for tourism development in the Primorsky krai. For instance, increase of domestic and incoming tourist flow to the region will be achieved by means of new tourist objects, routes and modern tourist products and expansion of the range of tourist services. Besides, issues of training high quality specialists and modernization and development of tourist infrastructure are considered in the strategy as well.\n\nNovember 3, 2010\n\nRussian tour operators study tourism possibilities of Kaliningrad\n\nOver 500 Russian tour operators arrived in Kaliningrad to study tourist potential of the region and its use as a transit ground for visiting Poland and other European countries, as head of the tourism department of the regional government Natalia Ryabinina said.\n\nThis project is implemented together with Polish tourist organization within the framework of the seventh Polish-Russian forum that will start in the Kaliningrad region and finish in Warminsko-Mazurskie Province.\n\nWe host such a great number of specialists of tourist industry for the first time. It is important for us to demonstrate to our Russian colleagues the splendid places of rest in Kaliningrad. We should use the advantages of our geographic position (the borderline with the European Union) for visiting European countries such as Poland,  said a representative of the agency.\n\nOn the first day of the tour Combined routes: the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation  Warmia Mazuri of the Republic of Poland the participants got acquainted with recreation areas on the Russian coast of the Baltic and visited hotels of the resort town of Svetlogorsk.\n\nOn November 3 a working meeting with Kaliningrad tour operators who will present various recreation zones on the Russian Baltic and abroad will take place. During the second half of the day the delegation of tour operators will visit the Polish temple Ryn.\n\nNovember 2, 2010\n\nTourists will surge to St. Petersburg\n\nGovernor of St. Petersburg Valentina Matvienko announced the start up of the programme for development of such means of accommodation as camping on the Neva river. She asserts that in 2-3 months the administration of the Northern Capital will tender several pieces of land suitable for camping.\n\nMatvienko underlined that organization of camping will contribute to development of the hotel services market of St. Petersburg. Zones for tourists will appear near the city entrance. Territories of Kurortny, Pushkinsky and Petrodvortsovy districts are among possible places for camping location. The Government will lend 10 sections of 0,5  1,5 hectares to managing companies for 10-15 years.\n\nThe idea of camping development near Petrodvorets or on the coast of the Gulf of Finland may be implemented within the frames of the All-Russian programme for domestic tourism development. In case this initiative will be supported on the federal level, an additional source of funding will probably appear.\n\nExperts believe that first camping will be popular among Finns and only then  among other Europeans who will go to Russia via Finland. For instance, by ferry, because its passengers have got the right for 72 hour stay without visas. Thus, the success of the camping will depend on attraction of the latter.\n\nOctober 29, 2010\n\nFirst infrastructural objects of the Baikal Harbour special economic zone are put into operation\n\nThe first phase of infrastructural objects of the special economic zone of tourist recreational type Baikal Harbour at a cost of 430 mln roubles is put into operation in the Baikal region of Buryatia, as press secretary of JSC SEZ Roman Chernigovtsev reported.\n\nInvestments into construction comprised 430 mln roubles and total volume of investments  1,4 billion roubles.

For the last 9 months about 170 thousand people, including representatives of Russian, German, French and Slovenian delegations, visited it. In spite of the fact that the zone has just started developing, it has already got the adopted development plan and functioning infrastructure. For instance, a new paved line is currently being constructed on the left coast of the river Katun.\n\nThe infrastructure of the complex is funded by the government, and tourist and recreational areas are funded by private investors. The external infrastructure of the special economic zone consists of several objects.

In contrast to passenger boats, these vessels can cruise on icy surface of rivers. 15 air-cushion vessels will follow the international passenger line Blagoveshchensk  Heihe  Blagoveshchensk. Eleven of them are provided by Russia and four  by China. A ticket to the common room will cost about 1,5 thousand roubles, to the serviced room  1,7 thousand roubles and to the luxury room  2,1 thousand roubles.\n\nSpeed air-cushion vessels will cruise from Russia to China and back till the beginning of January when ice becomes firm.\n\nEvery day several hundred people cross the boundary control point Blagoveshchensk to enter China.\n\nOctober 26, 2010\n\nMexican visa will be free for the Russians\n\nRussian citizens will be able to get a Mexican visa for free from November 1, 2010. The Government of Mexico will start up an electronic visa system.\n\nAn applicant wont have to come to the embassy: one should fill in an online application form and in some minutes receive a document with a code. This electronic visa is free of charge and will allow to stay on the territory of the country for 180 days. Besides, as the ambassador asserted, the citizens with open US visas, will gain permission to visit Mexico.\n\nThe new electronic visa is valid for a single entry. However, the embassy will continue issuing visas for 5 and 10 years. To get a long-term visa an applicant should visit the embassy.\n\nThe ambassador hopes that issuing of electronic visas will increase considerably a tourist flow to this country. Thus, about 20 thousand Russian tourists visited Mexico last year and in 2010 this number may grow up to 40 thousand. The embassy plans to increase Russian tourist flow to 70 thousand people next year.\n\nOctober 25, 2010\n\nArchangelsk region and Finland are working out a joint project\n\nA working meeting of representatives of Russia and Finland for preparation of the project European region  Arkhangelsk tourist ring was held in St. Petersburg.\n\nMinistry of Youth, Sports and Tourism of the Arkhangelsk region reported that main partners of the project took part in the meeting  representatives of governments of the Arkhangelsk and Vologda regions and Republics of Karelia and Komi.

Thus, we will have enough time to consider this issue (opening of green corridor),  he noticed.\n\nThe government pays special attention to development of tourism in the Kaliningrad region having no land border with the main part of Russia, but neighbouring with Lithuania and Poland (the EU members). According to the government decree Development of the Kaliningrad region as a tourist center in 2007-2014 adopted in August 2010, increase of the share of tourist-recreational sphere in Gross Regional Product should grow from 1,5 to 6% by 2014 and the tourist flow should be increased from 390 thousand to 1,5 mln tourists a year.\n\nOctober 20, 2010\n\nNew department will manage tourism in the Altai krai\n\nGovernor of the Altai krai Alexander Karlin signed a decree about creation of the Department of the Altai krai for development of tourist-recreational and sanatorium-resort complexes.\n\nThe administration claims that the department will contribute much to development of the tourism sphere and establishments of the sanatorium-resort complex.\n\nThis department belongs to the executive branch of the Altai krai authority that contributes to implementation of the unified state policy in the sphere of tourism in the region. The department will work out a general strategy for development of the complexes, create investment vehicles, prepare and implement regional target programmes, coordinate activity of executive power of the krai for provision of functioning of tourist-recreational and gambling zones.

She stated that today tourist business develops well. For instance, now we have twice as many hotel rooms as we had several years ago.\n\nThe head of the city administration also noticed that during the navigation period 2010 St. Petersburg handled over 400 passenger vessels. She reported that in 2011 construction of the Sea passenger port on the Vasilievsky Island will be finished, which will allow handling more ships. Besides, Matvienko underlined that time for staying of tourists arriving in St. Petersburg by water transport without a visa was prolonged to 72 hours, which made the city more popular and interesting.\n\nSpeaking of expensive accommodation in St. Peterburg hotels Matvienko reported that she doesnt support command regulation of prices. We live in market economy and should follow its rules. All we can set against high prices is increasing of the number of hotels. Now we need more three- and four-star hotels,  she underlined. The governor also suggested creating tourist camp-sites to improve the situation.\n\nOctober 18, 2010\n\nIn the Voronezh region four tourist zones will open\n\nOn October 15 in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Voronezh region a review of the project Strategy for domestic and incoming tourism development till 2016 took place. The project was prepared by the Department for Entrepreneurship and Consumer Market Development of the Voronezh region.\n\nExperts estimate that the share of tourism in GDP of the Voronezh region is less than 1%. However, the region is still attractive for tourists. It holds the 46th position among 89 federal subjects.\n\nFor the purpose of tourist potential disclosure authors of the strategy suggest creating four tourist recreational zones: Voronezh, Central, Southern and Eastern, at which not only traditional kinds of tourism, but also extreme and rural tourism will develop.\n\nAccording to the report of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one of the first steps for increasing of tourist attractiveness will be informational tour for representatives of tourist business of the neighbouring regions that will take place in November. Guests will go sightseeing, follow tourist routes and see the existing tourist infrastructure.\n\nOctober 15, 2010\n\nExpensive air tickets hamper development of incoming tourism in Sakhalin and Kurils\n\nTransport aspect is the main constraint of incoming tourism development in the Sakhalin region, as representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Vladimir Nosov states.\n\nThe Sakhalin region is of great interest to both Russian and foreign tourists. However, it is rather problematic to make effective use of tourist resources of Sakhalin and Kurils today,  claimed Nosov. He said that on the one hand, there are enough comfortable hotels, meeting the world standards, in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.\n\nOn the other hand, transport aspect and especially air tickets prices are the main hampering factor for foreign tourists. Besides, today it is almost impossible for a traveller to reach Kurils  underlined Nosov.\n\nHe believes that well coordinated work of aviation is required, so that a person arriving in Sakhalin could reach Kurils in 1-1,5 hours and get back as fast.\n\nRepresentatives of Sakhalin travel agencies raised an issue that Russian major air carriers dont provide them with promotional pack of tariffs for transportation of tourists from the central part of Russia and back. They gave the following example: in August-September 2010 (the most popular season among tourists) a price for an air ticket from Moscow to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk reached 40 thousand roubles. No one will pay such a sum of money to fly to Sakhalin, as tour operators claimed.\n\nOctober 14, 2010\n\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly are forging relationships in tourism sphere with Germany\n\nDevelopment of effective partnership in tourism sphere between St. Petersburg and the German town of Bad Ems was the crucial issue at the session of the Commission for Travel Industry. Mayor of Bad Ems, burgomaster of the Bad Ems region, head of tourist enterprises and healthy centers of Bad Ems took part in the session, as the press service of the Commission reports.\n\nChairman of the Commission Andrey Chernykh said that the modern St. Petersburg develops relationships in tourism sphere both on domestic and international levels. For instance, the initiative of the administration of St. Petersburg allowing foreign tourists who come to Russia by ferries to stay in the country without visas during three days, was adopted. The deputy underlined that Germany had been a strategic partner of Russia for a long time. The St. Petersburg Parliament has forged strong connections with the Consulate General.\n\nMayor of Bad Ems Berny Abt and burgomaster of the Bad Ems region Josef Oster thanked the receiving party for its hearty welcome and expressed his hope for further mutually advantageous cooperation.\n\nThe parties plan to work out a number of arrangements for expansion of tourist flow from St. Petersburg to Bad Ems and from Bad Ems to St. Petersburg, introduce new cultural and health recreation programmes, including spheres of social and health-related tourism. Implementation of the programmes will allow to considerably expand tourist markets of our countries and strengthen relationships between Russia and Germany.\n\nOctober 13, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg is expecting to host 5 mln tourists by the end of the year\n\nBy the end of 2010 over 5 mln tourists will visit St. Petersburg, as Chairman of the Committee for Investment and Strategic Projects of the Northern Capital Aleksey Chichkanov stated.\n\nAccording to Rostourism, in crisis 2009 St. Petersburg welcomed 2,35 mln guests. Chichkanov said that this year 1,2 thousand new hotel rooms will appear in the city, which will allow to reach the European level.\n\nHe underlined that in spite of the positive growth tendency in sphere of incoming and domestic tourism, the administration of the city still has a number of issues to tackle. We aim at creation of favourable conditions for business in the city, which will lead to decreasing of prime cost of the offered tourist services. It may be challenging: if we dont solve the problem of growing prices, tourist attractiveness of St. Petersburg will lower, stated the head of the Committee.\n\nHe also added that the administration intends to translate all signs and other navigation information into English due to the increasing flow of foreign tourists. When more foreign tourists prefer individual trips to our city, absence of translated names of streets, main culture-historical objects into English becomes a problem. We havent got a special programme for which the administration will allocate certain sums of money, but in the nearest future such programme will be worked out,  Chichkanov said.\n\nOctober 12, 2010\n\nThe Irkutsk region needs a law about tourism\n\nThe Irkutsk scientific center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) suggests adopting a law about tourism in the Irkutsk region and working out a strategy for the sphere development. The decision about submitting of such offer to the Legislative Assembly and the government of the region was adopted at the last session of the general committee.\n\nHead of the social geography department of Sochava Institute of Geography SB RAS Sergey Ryashchenko reported on the issue Tourist recreational natural resource use on Baikal at the session of the general committee of the Irkutsk scientific center.\n\nScientists admit that tourism development on Baikal without proper development of infrastructure and consistency many times exceeds the acceptable level of impact on nature. In warm months a lot of cars and tents appear on beaches and there is practically no free space left. After this invasion piles of garbage remain and because of absence of utilization they fall in Baikal.\n\nAccording to the similar law of the Republic of Buryatia, it sets economic and legal guarantees of tourism and tourist industry on the territory of the Republic of Buryatia and regulates relations in tourism sphere, tourist industry and sustainable use of tourist resources. Besides, the law considers tourism to be one of the priority directions of economic sustainable development of the Republic of Buryatia and a guarantee of security of lake Baikal as a part of the worlds heritage.\n\nOctober 11, 2010\n\nFirst Russian-Polish travel forum opened in St. Petersburg multimedia\n\nFirst Russian-Polish travel forum opened in the Northern Capital of Russia on October 11. Over 300 representatives of Polish tourist business and 30 enterprises of St. Petersburg will take part in the forum.\n\nThe most positive moment for the last seven years in relations between our countries in tourism sphere is that Russian tourism turned from shuttle and transit business into the real tourism,  president of Russian Travel Industry Union Sergey Shpilko announced. He believes that process of development of Russian-Polish tourism is hampered only by absence of cheep traffic.\n\nPresident of Polish Chamber of Tourism Yan Korsak raised an issue of creation a ferry line between the cities of Gdynia and St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 2003 a tourist office of the Republic of Poland opened in Moscow for the purpose of development of tourist sphere between Poland and Russia. 500 thousand Polish tourists visit Russia each year and the same number of Russian tourists visit Poland annually.\n\nOctober 8, 2010\n\nNumber of tourists visiting Shukotka in 2010 grew\n\nIn Chukotka Autonomous District the tourist season for 9 months of 2010 is summarized. According to the department of sport and tourism of the district, tourist flow in the region for the period increased almost by 2,5 thousand and comprised 22040 persons. The major number of tourists went to Chukotka on cruise tours with stops in towns of Chukotka.\n\nIn 2010 nine such stops were performed. For instance, large cruise vessels «Clipper Odyssey» and «Hanseatic» with foreign tourists on board visited the village of Providence and other places in Chukotka.\n\nBusiness, extreme and ecological kinds of tourism are less popular in the district in 2010. About 70 persons visited Chukotka within the frames of such cruises.\n\nTourists from 58 countries visited Chukotka. Major number of guests came from the USA, Germany, the Philippines and Australia. They took part in marine cruises.\n\nProfit of the Chukotka Autonomous District from tourist visits comprised almost 11 mln roubles that is 1,2 mln more than last year.\n\nToday 18 tourist operators function on the territory of Chukotka. They are nine local companies and nine organizations from other cities of Russia: Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Saint Petersburg, Smolensk, Khabarovsk and Moscow. Prospects for further growth of tourist sphere in the district are closely connected to development of cruise tourism.\n\nOctober 7, 2010\n\nThe State Duma will consider the draft law about accretion of power of regional administration in tourism sphere\n\nDeputy Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy of the Russian Federation Nadezhda Nazina said that on October 24 the second and third reading of the draft law about transfer of tourism into the joint competence of regional and federal administration would take place in the State Duma.\n\nAdoption of this law will allow to develop tourist infrastructure in regions more effectively and make them more attractive for investors. Besides, possibility of cancellation of temporary registration of foreign tourists from January 1, 2011 is being currently discussed.\n\nRussia takes an active part in international organizations in tourism sphere. Thus, 57 bilateral intergovernmental agreements are signed, 17 working groups function within the framework of international commissions, 13 organizations for collaboration in tourism sector are opened.\n\nSpeaking about development of tourism till 2016, Nazina noted that 8 investment projects are included into the federal target program.\n\n257 applications were submitted. Many of them may contribute to development of tourism in regions,  she stated.  The main reason why they were not included into the program is absence of real investors.\n\nOctober 6, 2010\n\nThe conference Development of resort and tourist infrastructure in the Black Sea Region opened in Sochi\n\nThe International conference for the member countries of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Development of resort and tourist infrastructure in the Black Sea Region opened in Sochi.\n\nThe official website of the Russian Federal Agency for Tourism (Rostourism) informs that the international conference in Sochi has received official support of the World Tourism Organization and will gather participants practically from all the member countries of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.

Therefore, the Russians will still need a visa to enter the Schengen zone countries.\n\nHe added that the Kazan visa center is the sixth. Five visa centers  in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg,  service over 10 diplomatic missions.\n\nVisa centers fulfill administrative function: they collect visa fees, check application forms, prepare documents, submit these documents to embassies in Moscow for endorsement and then issue passports to the applicants. Besides, they keep confidentiality of personal data of each client.\n\nTerm of getting a visa may vary from 6 days to 3 months.\n\nCitizens of the neighboring regions and some countries of the CIS may use services of the Kazan center.\n\nThe administration of the Kazan visa center informed that in the nearest two years VFS plans to open such visa centers in Irkutsk, Vladivostok and, possibly, in Nizhni Novgorod.\n\nOctober 4, 2010\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation suggests canceling registration of the citizens of the European Union who come to Russia for a short period of time\n\nRegistration of the citizens of the European Union countries in Russia is not mentioned in the draft agreement about visa free regime with the EU, as Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the RF Alexander Grushko reported. He said that Russia is aware of the European countries attitude to complication of registration procedure of foreign citizens in the RF. Deputy Minister underlined that today this procedure doesnt differ much from the procedure existing in majority of the countries of the EU.\n\nHe reminded that some European diplomats mentioned an issue of obtaining work permit in Russia for the citizens of the EU countries. However, Grushko noted that establishment of visa free regime concerns only the right to enter the territory of the Russian Federation and the European Union for a short period of time.\n\nHe also stated that issue of getting work permit by European specialists is discussed in the course of collaboration between Russia and the EU. Earlier, at the press conference in Moscow Ambassador of Germany in the RF Ulrich Brandenburg announced that if the RF would cancel procedure of compulsory registration of foreigners it would be a great contribution to visa free regime establishment with the EU. Head of the German diplomatic mission expressed his hope that Russia and the European Union will achieve considerable progress on the way to establishment of visa free regime in the nearest future.\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nThe Americans got interested in the Russian tourism market\n\nNext week the delegation of representatives of the national tourist office of the United States Visit USA will come to Russia for the first time and will hold meetings with representatives of Russian tourist business in seven cities.\n\nPresentation of travel opportunities to the USA will take place in the largest regional centers of Russia  from Moscow and St. Petersburg to Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.\n\nWithin the framework of the seminars, in which over 250 Russian companies will take part, presentations, business meetings and informal socializing will take place. Thanks to the seminars representatives of tourist business will get an opportunity to widen the range of services and find new business partners in the USA, and Russian tourists will get new opportunities of travelling to North America.\n\nHead of Visit USA Russia Margarita Babayan says that the decision of the American tourism for officials to make such a large-scale acquaintance with Russian tourist business was caused by a significant growth in the number of travellers from Russia to the USA that comprised 25% in 2008 and didnt decrease during the crisis 2009.\n\nExperts believe that increase of flow of Russians to the USA not only evokes interest in this country, but also contributes to simplification of the process of getting a visa that a couple of years ago was less available for the citizens of our country.\n\nAmbassador of the USA in Russia John Beyrle explained that 95% of all Russian applicants will get American visa. Number of tourist visa rejections comprises only 5%. 22 thousand visas were issued to Russians citizens from January till July.\n\nBesides, air travel between our countries is getting more diverse with regard to prices and flights.

Three trips a week will be performed to New York and two trips  to Miami. Besides, Transaero becomes the only airline company, performing direct non-stop flights between Moscow and Miami. Market participants assume that due to appearance of the new carrier on the routes Russia  USA the flight prices will go lower.\n\nSeptember 30, 2010\n\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization underlined the growing significance of tourism\n\nIn the Japanese city of Nara the APEC Tourism Ministerial Meeting and a session of the APEC Tourism Working Group took place. Deputy Head of the Russian Federal Agency for Tourism Alexander Radkov took part in the events. The agenda included investments, development of tourism business, ways to overcome the crisis, creation of conditions for stable tourism.\n\nHeads of delegations underlined the growing significance of tourism for economy. This sphere is an important, and for many countries the main source of income and occupation, and it contributes to diversification of economic life of the society.\n\nAt the meeting it was pointed out that the world travel industry recovers from the crisis, and 2010 has become the breaking point. From the national budgets considerable sums of money are allocated for tourism development. In the nearest future the positive tendencies will remain. In this respect it was decided to keep on working for promotion of tourism by improving conditions for business, taking part in new projects development and expanding regional cooperation. The necessity for extension of information cooperation including risks in tourism sphere was mentioned.\n\nAlexander Radkov underlined that Russias tourism sphere recovers from the crisis with stable growth rate. The government set the tasks for development of domestic and incoming tourism and defined measures for creating conditions for its stable development.

Alpine skiing and sanatorium resort will be developed in the district, as Vice Prime Minister, Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the RF in the North Caucasus federal district (NCFD) Alexander Khloponin reported today during the Parliament Hour at the Federation Council.\n\nHe claimed that one of the main goals of the government strategy for development of the district till 2025 is creation of tourist clusters that will allow implementing of the unique natural, climatic and recreational potential of the North Caucasus.\n\nITAR-TASS reports that Alpine skiing tourism will develop first, and then sanatorium  resort tourism will be improved.\n\nProspective territories are determined in every subject of the NCFD. Besides, the government intends to use additional forms of the state support: customs and tariffs measures and creation of special economic zones, as Khloponin announces.\n\nIn this respect the government decision on creation of six special tourist recreational zones on the territory of the district is being currently worked out and will be adopted in October, Khloponin reported.\n\nExperts claim that these measures will contribute to attraction of approximately 990 billion roubles of private investments.\n\nSeptember 28, 2010\n\nHelicopters and aquabuses will transport St. Petersburg tourists\n\nThe guests of the Northern Capital of Russia will use alternative modes of transport. The Russian Union of Travel Industry informs about creation of the Agency for transport infrastructure that will control all the city heliports and helipads and operate several helicopters. Chairman of the Committee on transport and transit policy Nikolay Asaul asserts that this service should become cheaper and more popular.\n\nSpeaking about water resources Asaul drew attention to opportunities of transportation of cruise passengers to the main sights of St. Petersburg by water. For instance, Meteors already take tourists from cruise vessels for sightseeing tours. This year only 35 such trips have been made, but in the nearest future due to closing of some central bridges of the city for repair works, this number will grow.\n\nTrips by aquabuses proved to be popular and alongside with the routes from Kronstadt and Lomonosov the new routes along the Neva from Rybatskoye to the centre and to Zelenogorsk-Kronstadt-Oreshek will open.\n\nIt should be noted that transport issue is one of the main factors hampering the development of incoming tourism in St. Petersburg.\n\nSeptember 27, 2010\n\nSeptember 27 is World Tourism Day\n\nWorld Tourism Day is an international holiday established by the General Assembly of the World Tourism Organization in 1979 in the Spanish city of Torremolinos.

On behalf of the Project St. Petersburg  the sea capital of RUSSIA we congratulate all the workers of the tourist sphere on this holiday and wish success!\n\nSeptember 27, 2010\n\nThe Passenger port of St. Petersburg enters the list of the customs stations using green corridor\n\nThe Federal Customs Service (FCS of Russia) enhanced the list of stations that use the so-called green corridor in customs clearance. The corresponding order was registered in the Ministry of Justice of the RF on September 23 and is available on the website of the Federal Customs Service. For instance, the Passenger port of St. Petersburg and the Chernyshevskoye automobile crossing point (The Kaliningrad region) are put in the document that lists 41 stations.\n\nThe corridor system presupposes that a person crossing the customs border chooses him or herself, whether to declare goods in the written form or not. When the green corridor is chosen, no goods subject to obligatory written declaring should be transported.\n\nThe construction of the Sea Facade Passenger port of St. Petersburg began in 2006 and in 2008 the first phase was completed. By September 2010 the port has handled about 600 thousand tourists.\n\nSeptember 24, 2010\n\nCruise vessels bring 80% of tourists to St. Petersburg\n\nExperts state that 80% of tourists arrive in St. Petersburg by cruise ships. In summer 2010 the sea port of the city handled 376 passenger vessels, 75 of which were regular ferry cruises between Russia and Finland.\n\nFor instance, from April till September 2010 Princess Maria ferry transported over 100 thousand passengers. It is expected that by the beginning of 2011 this number will grow to 180 thousand. This tendency is caused by permission provided to foreign passengers of cruise vessels to stay in Russian port cities during 72 hours without visa.\n\nFrom September 10, 2008 to September 10, 2010 the Passenger port of St. Petersburg handled over 600 thousand passengers that is the major part of all tourists, arriving in the city by sea transport. From the beginning of navigation this year and up to the mid-September the port handled more than 350 thousand cruise tourists.\n\nBy May Holidays next year St.PeterLine company plans to open a new line St. Petersburg  Stockholm with a stop in Tallinn.\n\nIn the last five years the number of cruising Europeans increased by 50% and comprised 4,9 mln in 2009. Thus, last year the number of European passengers of cruise liners comprised 30% of the total flow of tourists preferring this type of travelling. Today European cruise industry brings over 34 billions Euro profit. In 2009 23,8 mln passenger cruise liners visited European ports, which is 80% more than in 2005.\n\nSeptember 23, 2010\n\n96 billion roubles will be allocated for tourism development in Russia\n\nIn Russia 96 billion roubles will be allocated for tourism development in 2011-2016, as chairman of the Commission on Youth and Tourism Affairs of the Federation Council Vladimir Zhidkikh reported. He said that this sum is planned to be invested according to the project of the federal target program Development of domestic and incoming tourism in Russia in 2011-2016.\n\nHe stated that the federal target program is considered to be anti-crisis and strategically important for the state. This program will provide regions with an opportunity to develop tourism and work out their regional programs.\n\nIn this respect a draft law was prepared by the Federation Council. Mr Zhidkikh hopes that during the autumn session the law will be adopted.\n\nSeptember 22, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg  Stockholm ferry line may open in May 2011\n\nBy May Holidays 2011 a new ferry line from St. Petersburg to Stockholm will open.\n\nPress service of the Northwest Regional Branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI) reported at the session of the Incoming Tourism Committee in St. Petersburg that the ferry will also stop at Tallinn.\n\nBesides, another vessel will be put into operation on the St. Petersburg  Helsinki line. It has the same capacity as the ship Princess Maria. This vessel can carry 1 700 passengers and 400 automobiles on board.\n\nOver 100 thousand passengers used the St. Petersburg  Helsinki ferry line this year. It is expected that in 2011 this number will grow to 180 thousand persons.\n\nSeptember 21, 2010\n\nTourists will enter Chile without visa\n\nVisa free regime between Russia and Chile may be set already in September,  Ambassador of Chile in Moscow Juan Eduardo Eguiguren reported. He noted that preparation of the agreement will be soon completed. The head of the Chile diplomatic mission believes that lifting of the visa regime between the countries will lead to increase in the number of tourists from Russia.\n\nHowever, Russian tour operators dont share the diplomats optimistic point of view.\n\nLatin America is a rather specific area. It takes much time and money to get there and one cant speak of a large tourist flow,  says Yelena Tarasova, expert of the International Travel Club (ITC). She underlines that getting a visa is not a problem even today: despite the seven day term, set by the embassy, the actual term for document preparation does not exceed two days.\n\nThe situation will most likely follow the Brazil and Venezuela scenario  tourist flow will increase, but not significantly  by 10-15% maximum. The countries of Latin America will never be popular among Russian tourists. It is expensive and takes long to get there,  states head of the Latin office of the Astravel company Polina Geller. So, we cant speak of a considerable increase in the number of tourists. Cancellation of the visa regime with Chile is still good news for us. It will provide an opportunity to organize tours into several countries of Latin America (for instance, Chile and Peru), which have visa free regime with Russia. This will also simplify travelling from ski resorts of Argentine to other countries of Latin America along the Andes mountain chain,  says Yelena Tarasova.\n\nSeptember 20, 2010\n\nA cruise vessel arrived to Syzran for the first time in seven years\n\nOn the 17th of October a cruise vessel arrived to Syzran in the Samara region for the first time in seven years.\n\nLiner Vasily Chapayev follows the route Rostov-on-Don  Konstantinovskaya  Ilyevka  Volgograd  Saratov  Syzran  Ulyanovsk  Kazan.

They visited the local history museum and the exhibition hall. There are 140 historical and cultural monuments in Syzran.\n\nVasily Chapayev could arrive to Syzran thanks to collaboration of the administration of the Syzran urban district and JSC Samara River Port (this organization owns the Syzran river port). The town quay and coast infrastructure was recovered.\n\nSeptember 17, 2010\n\nA guides guild is created in Kazan\n\nA non-commercial partnership Kazan Guides Guild is created in Kazan. It was founded by the Tourist Information Centre, the National Cultural Centre Kazan and the National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan.

After amendments to legislation are adopted, the assets tax will be reduced to 0% and organization profits tax  to 13,5%. Tax cuts will be provided for 5 years.\n\nHead of the office for development of tourism and small and medium business infrastructure of the Department of Entrepreneurship Development of the Ministry of Economy of the Ulyanovsk region Vladislava Slepova states that this law adoption will allow to create favourable economic conditions for implementation of priority tourist projects for improvement of incoming tourism and modernization of tourist service in the region. First of all, this strategy of state support aims at attracting main entities of tourist industry, specializing in incoming tourism, and to develop collective means of accommodation on the territory of the Ulyanovsk region,  Ms Slepova notes.\n\nSeptember 14, 2010\n\nFrom 2011 the implementation of the new federal target program for tourism development in Russia will commence\n\nIn three years 7 billion roubles will be invested into development of domestic tourism in the Russian Federation, as the Prime Minister of the RF Vladimir Putin reported.

He added that 2 billion roubles of the total sum will be allocated already in 2011.\n\nThe Prime Minister also underlined that a strategy for decentralization of business, public and cultural life of the country and for efficiency of all the territories of the RF, will be continued. In this respect he reminded that Russia suggested to hold the FIFA World Cup 2018. If we get this right, we will firstly develop the cities of the Privolzhskiy Federal District  Nizhni Novgorod, Kazan, Samara, Saransk  for the needs of the World Cup,  said Mr Putin.\n\nSeptember 13, 2010\n\nThe international regatta Yaroslav Mudry devoted to the millennium anniversary of Yaroslavl finished on the 13th of September\n\nThe fifth regatta was held in Yaroslavl in the centre of the city on the slip of Volga and Kotorosl rivers.

We believe that young guests of our city, yachtsmen, will appreciate the beauty of Yaroslavl and the citizens will enjoy the splendid sailing festival. Sailing is a family sport. Besides, development of sailing tourism will attract more travelers to our city.\n\nDeputy president of the All-Russian Sailing Federation Georgiy Shaiduko said: The Yaroslavl region possesses large water resources, such as the Rybinskoye reservoir, the Volga river and other rivers and lakes. With regard to the existing water areas hundreds of children and adults should go in for yachting here. I hope that this regatta will contribute to development of the sailing infrastructure and childrens yachting sport.\n\nSeptember 10, 2010\n\nYaroslavl celebrates its 1000-years anniversary\n\nOn Friday a solemn ceremony of unveiling of the monument To the millennium of the city started the festive events.

The superliner will depart on Thursday, September 2, at 2 p.m.\n\nAugust 30, 2010\n\nThe Irkutsk Region submitted an application for federal funding of tourist projects\n\nThe Irkutsk, Slyudyansk, Olkhonsk districts and the town of Bratsk count on the government support in tourism development. Municipalities take an active part in preparing the regional long-term target programme for development of domestic and incoming tourism in the region in 2010  2016. The programme involves construction of general and tourist infrastructure.\n\nThe Regional programme provides funding for road, sewage, purification facilities and other engineering infrastructure construction. For tourist objects development of private investment is necessary. This refers to the existing tourist objects that are currently being developed, such as tourist centers in Bolshoy Goloustny and in the Narrow Sea, reconstruction of the section of Yelantsi-Khuzhir road and Irkutsk-Bolshoye Goloustnoye road.

In the meantime the minister added that they perform basically one function  environment protection. Environmental education and tourism functions are fulfilled insufficiently.\n\nYuri Trutnev believes that there are two reasons for that  absence of necessary infrastructure in natural areas of preferential protection and imperfection of legislation, in which possibilities for construction of national parks infrastructure as well as of ecological tourism and reserves visiting are not clearly stated.\n\nWhen asked the question if the boards of directors of the reserves are allowed to organize eco-tourism, Trutnev answered that according to the above stated reasons only private single excursions may perform ecological tourism function in reserves.\n\nPrime Minister reminded that in Russian nature reserves any economic activity is forbidden and in national parks it is allowed only in certain territories. His position is to keep this approach.\n\nAugust 26, 2010\n\nHeads of British tourism will come to Moscow for rowing regatta\n\nCompetitions held with the support of VisitBritain, the Russian Amateur Rowing Association and the British Council will continue the series of events devoted to the 150th anniversary of rowing in Russia.\n\nRegatta will start at the House of the Government of the Russian Federation and finish at the Andreyevsky pedestrian bridge (the Pushkin embankment, the Neskuchny park).
