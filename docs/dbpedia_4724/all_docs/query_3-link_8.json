        "text": "Description\n\nVodohod is a Russian river cruise tour operator, which is the largest cruise operator in Russia. For 17 years it has been offering itineraries that visit the country's most interesting cities and towns while providing a service with high quality standards. Vodohod has 12 ships that are continuously renovated to offer the best comfort on board by investing in high quality interior solutions, modern design, spacious cabins and maximum comfort for guests. Every year Vodohod introduces new destinations that allow guests to broaden their horizons and visit the most interesting corners of Russia. The mission is to showcase unknown rivers and hard-to-reach regions, creating a quality product and experiences that leave you breathless.\n\nIn 2020, the brand new river and sea flagship Mustai Karim was launched, the first luxury 5-star ship built in Russia in 60 years. A new type of ship was introduced in 2021 - a vessel with an inner tube of 0.9m, enabling it to sail on water, ice or even land. Propellers allow the vessel to turn in place, reverse and disembark passengers on any unequipped shore, giving travellers access to the most beautiful and inaccessible places along the route."
