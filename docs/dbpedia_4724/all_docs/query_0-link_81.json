Below are shown Carnival Breeze ship’s Premium Vista Balcony staterooms (sliding floor-ceiling doors open to a wrap-around veranda).\n\nCove Balcony Staterooms\n\nCove balconies unlike Balconies have two patio chairs and a table. The rest of the stuff is identical. First of all – balcony, and again twin beds that convert to king, sofa, private bath with shower, safe, closet, mini bar, television and phone, sitting area with chair and coffee table, bathrobes and hair dryer. Cove Balcony rooms are the Carnival’s specialty, available on some of the “Fun Ships”, and are interesting, because they are located on lower decks (thus closer to waterline). Here is shown Disne Fantasy ship’s “Navigator’s (Cove) Balcony Cabin”.\n\nOceanview cabins on cruise ships\n\nOceanview cabins: as sizes are similar to Interior staterooms on cruise ships, but each of them has a Porthole or normal window (both types do not open). Their window sizes also vary by line and ship. On some ocean ships and some luxury river ships, such staterooms feature floor-ceiling windows. Oceanview rooms’ window sizes are usually 4×3 ft (1,2×0,9 m). As furniture, Oceanview cruise cabins have twin beds that convert to king, sofa, television and phone, sitting area, safe, mini bar, private bath with shower, and also a washroom with sink and a junior tub, bathrobes and a hair dryer and of course a picture window. You should take a look at the cruise ship deck plans again as Cabins of 5A category have two porthole widows. Unlike deluxe, there is no washroom with sink and junior tub. Below are the layouts of Ovation of the Seas Oceanview cabins (categoris standard, large, and superior).\n\nDeluxe Oceanview\n\nThese cabins have no balconies but still can offer a marvelous view through their picture window as well as twin beds that convert to king. However beds in Category 6N can’t be joined to king and sleeps are no more than 5. The rest of the interior is sofa, television and phone, sitting area, safe, mini bar, private bath with shower, and also a washroom with sink and a junior tub, bathrobes and a hair dryer. Comprehensevely this category is also one of the most dreamed in cruise ship deck plans.\n\nScenic Oceanview\n\nThe interior is the same  twin bed that convert to king, picture window, sofa, television and phone, sitting area, safe, mini bar, private bath with shower, and also a washroom with sink and a junior tub, bathrobes and a hair dryer, the difference is that the cabin is larger. Below is the Carnival Sunshine ship Scenic Oceanview cabin layout (slanted floor-ceiling windows /non-opening).\n\nInside cabins on cruise ships\n\nInside cruise ship cabins’ best feature is their price – you book them with the line’s cheapest rates available. These cruise accommodations don’t offer window views. Still, on some of the newest cruise ships of Royal Caribbean and Disney, there are categories Interior staterooms with a “virtual window”, which is a large LED screen displaying outside cam views. The screen doesn’t have TV functions. On some Carnival Cruise Lines ships, there are category Inside cabins with a “French Balcony” (with an opening glassdoor). Also, some staterooms are actually Oceanview (with a window), but since their views are obstructed, they are available for booking as Interior. On Royal Caribbean ships, some Inside cabins have a nice window looking out to the ship’s interior promenade. As amenities, Inside cruise cabins are outfitted with twin beds that convert to king and private bath with shower, sitting area with chair, television and phone, safe, mini bar, bathrobes and a hair dryer. They have no view. Next are shown the layouts of Interior rooms on harmony of the Seas.\n\nSmall Interior Stateroom (as the name implies) is the least spacious standard cabin category on cruise ships. These cabins have two beds  (upper and lower), private bath (WC/shower), small sitting area.\n\nSingle cruise cabins\n\nSingle occupancy staterooms could be either Inside or Balcony. Some river cruise lines even offer single suites (booking with single occupancy rates). The most famous ship with single cabins (designed specifically for solo travelers) is NCL Epic. This huge vessel has a total of 128 such rooms (called “Studio”).\n\nNext are shown layouts of Quantum of the Seas single-occupancy cabins (balcony and interior).\n\nAnd finally, see here the “Family Connected Junior Suite” cabin’s floorplan of the “WOW” RCI cruise ship Quantum of the Seas. The ship’s main cabin grades (Balcony, Oceanview, Inside) are all combined here into a 10-guest Family Suite accommodation. The layout also shows the exact positioning of furniture, 3 baths (1 with hot tub), large seating area, 2 double-sofa beds, 2 connecting balconies.\n\nHow to choose cabins on cruise ships?\n\nIf you are planning a cruise, booking a cabin is certainly as important as picking up cruise line or the cruise ship for instance. Before you take that decision you should really consider some issues related with your own personality and the other people to be on the cruise ship with you and really carefully examine some cruise ship deck plans. The first important thing you have to be honest with your conscious is whether you can get seasick. Secondly, what type of person you are and what exactly do you intend to do on board? Are you a party type or you just would like to spend several calm days at sea, away from the office jungle on land. Would you enjoy the pool with its all opportunities for contacts or you would rather have a rest lying at a balcony. There are some factors that are related with the maritime matter and you should have them in mind before you book your cabin. No matter the type of your stateroom, it could still be noisy or make you seasick. The more central and lower position your cabin has, the more stable it is. That is why you would better take some time, explore a couple of cruise deck plans and figure out some things before you make the booking. And this is a good Wikipedia article about what is “deck” on a ship (cruise passenger ships, and also on any marine vessel in general).\n\nHow many passengers do you want to book a stateroom for?\n\nIn case you and the rest of the family members or your friends are thin or you just do not intend to spend too much time in the cabin you can pick a small one. The same goes if you are OK if your companion presses your back, shoulder or another part of your body. Usually these staterooms are able to house no more than four people. Two of the passengers pay a full charge and the others’ charges are discounted. If you need room for more than four people connecting cabins might be an option and could cost you less than a suite. Bathtubs cabins are few, and in case you insist on it, check whether it’s available or not, consulting yourself with the cruise ship deck plan or other source of information.\n\nIs noise an issue for you? Which cabins on the ship to avoid?\n\nIf you are a party type and louder sounds are not bothering, everything would be OK. If you organize a family cruise however, you should look for a cabin away from the noisiest areas in the cruise ship deck plans. The first thing to look for in the cruise ship deck plan is the engine room. If you’re not far enough from it, you’ll be forced not only to take the irritating sounds but you may also get some vibration as a plus. Staterooms under discos, sport playgrounds, gym centres can spoil your vacation. Same goes for cabins under the Lido deck, as people having their nice time around the pool can awake you, moving their chairs in search for the best place or conversing with their mates in a loud voice. Staircases can also be very noisy so they should be expelled from the list if possible. Cruise ship deck plans can help you in all this, supplying valuable information at no cost.\n\nTake a good look at the cruise ship deck plan – room location is crucial!\n\nLocation is undoubtedly of great importance. As written above, cabins that have lower and more central position are more stable. The fact that cool cabins are usually located on higher decks makes it the challenging when you look at the cruise ship deck plans and draw your final decision. So spending more money won’t necessarily save you from seasickness. Cabins at the stern of a cruiser usually have the largest balconies. Forward suite will enable you to get the same view as the captain. Other cabins, you should have in mind, can have a limited view due to a lifeboat for instance. So, again, cruise ship deck plans can save you hours of unhappy feelings.\n\nGuarantee staterooms – take your chance!\n\nIf you are not set on selecting something particular and location is not a priority, you should not investigate the cruise ship deck plan so cautiously. The so called ”guarantee” cabin grades can turn to be among the best booking options. The “guarantee stateroom” booking allows you to pick up a category, not a cabin. In case the category is sold out you’ll be proposed a higher category lodging. The first cabins to be booked are both thecheapest and the most expensive ones, be aware when you choose test your luck. However it could be a bit risky so it’s more reasonable to get back to the cruise ship deck plans.\n\nShipboard facilities\n\nIf want to cruise with your children you’d better book a stateroom close to kids entertainment facilities. Cruise ship deck plans can once again help you to choose from the many opportunities created to meet passengers requirements. Spa cabins are recently available for instance. Passengers get a free access to the steam room and other connected facilities. These cabins are of course close to the SPA and you can move between in your bathrobe only. Carnival, Norwegian Lines’ Haven and MSC Cruises Yacht Club have a brand new feature. These vessels offer ”ship within ship” service and have more complicate cruise ship deck plans. Cruisers that can afford it, can enjoy private pools, gym centres, sun decks and restaurants without anyone else around spoiling their moment. When you have the money you just have to explore the cruise ship deck plan and make your mind.\n\nNew (lightweight composite) prefabricated cruise ship cabin\n\nOn May 24, 2016, a new “Lightweight Composite Cabin” design was unveiled in Southampton, England. The innovation was funded by the UK Government. Involved in the cabin’s designing, engineering, manufacturing and furbishing are the companies Carnival UK (Carnival Corporation’s subsidiary), Gurit Ltd (global composite materials supplier), Lloyd’s Register Group Ltd (technical / business services, maritime classification company), PE Composites Ltd (composite designer / manufacturer), Trimline Ltd (marine interior fit-out / refurbishment specialist) and the University of Southampton.\n\nThe new modular cabin prototype is half the weight of a typical cruise ship cabin. It also fully complies with the FTP Code’s requirements (International Code for the Application of Fire Test Procedures). Reducing the ship’s topdecks weight is an important issue for naval architects as the trend for building large-capacity cruise vessels continues. The new (prefabricated) module’s halved weight opens up opportunities for adding more passenger rooms to newbuild ships, without adding to the ship’s DWT weight."
