In his 1946 publication How to be an Alien, Mikes called it “the national passion of an otherwise dispassionate race”. The next time you have to queue, and it’s bound to come up (usually in the rain) consider its knightly origins. The word is 15th century and is not British but French for “a tail” or, more impressively, the heraldic term “tail of a beast”. This seems apt, as the first queue I can think of is when Noah managed to persuade all those animals to line up for a cruise. Hard as it may be to believe, other nations also queue. The Danes have a system of numbered tickets in chemists to ensure the fit and the poorly are treated with equanimity. Queuing is tedious but it’s dull for everyone. Winston Churchill even invented the word “Queuetopia” to warn Britain that under the Opposition they might be transformed into a socialist country in which people were required to queue for everything. Self-service counters were invented to make people feel as though they weren’t queuing. In fact, by the time you’ve called six times for assistance at a self-service till, it’s taken longer than waiting in line.\n\nCommentaire déposé le 29.04.2022 à 17:40 par Coco888\n\nNot available at the moment https://appes.com.br/v2/stmap_38ddgxdq.html?thorazine.ampicillin.cialis ivermectin for demodex mites in humans Our Classified websites (Photos, Motors, Jobs and Property Today) use cookies to ensure you get the correct local newspaper branding and content when you visit them.
