        "text": "Russian river cruise line Vodohod is recruiting for six positions to bolster its new international office in the UK.\n\nManaging director John Warner and international marketing director Mario Bounas are looking to appoint a sales director and fill five marketing roles including a brand manager and a digital manger.\n\nThe river line, which has operated on Russian waterways for 15 years, will add Mustai Karim to its 25-ship fleet this year. The five-star vessel will sail between Moscow and St Petersburg from May.\n\nWarner and Bounas have been in position since last summer but are ramping up efforts to gain a foothold in the UK market.\n\nWarner, who previously worked at G Adventures for 12 years, said: “The owners are very keen to be regarded as the leading Russian river cruise brand. If you were to ask anyone in the trade in the UK – no one would have heard of us. From a capacity standpoint, we’re bigger than virtually every other river cruise line that agents are familiar with. We need to try and get on an equal footing.”\n\nJohn Warner and Mario Bounas\n\nWarner said current sales from the UK “would be almost negligible”.\n\nHowever, he has spoken with cruise specialists and online travel agencies ahead of the line’s international launch this month.\n\nBounas joined Vodohod from Royal Caribbean International, where he was director of marketing.\n\nHe said: “When it comes to the trade, it is about ensuring they have all the assets and resources available to support their needs.”\n\nUntil the end of February, the line is offering 40% off fares on three and four-star ships, has a ‘buy one get one free’ offer based on two people sharing a cabin on Mustai Karim, and is offering 20% off cruise fares on the revamped Maxim Gorky."
