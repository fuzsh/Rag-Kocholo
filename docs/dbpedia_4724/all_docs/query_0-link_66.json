        "text": "Information agency Credinform has prepared a review of trends in tourism. The largest Russian travel agencies (TOP-10 and TOP-1000) in terms of annual revenue were selected according to the data from the Statistical Register for the latest available periods (2015 - 2017). The analysis was based on data of the Information and Analytical system Globas.\n\nNet assets is a ratio reflecting the real value of company's property. It is calculated annually as the difference between assets on the enterprise balance and its debt obligations. The ratio is considered negative (insufficiency of property), if company’s debt exceeds the value of its property.\n\nTable 1. The largest Russian travel agencies with the highest and lowest net assets rate in 2015 – 2017 № Name, INN, region Net assets value, bln RUB Solvency index Globas 2015 2016 2017 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 JSC TOURIST COMPLEX KLJASMA LAKE\n\nINN 5029026466 Moscow region 5,48 5,33 5,08 212 Strong 2 ПVAO INTOURIST\n\nINN 7703016416 Moscow 4,62 3,99 3,39 310 Adequate 3 LLC VODOHOD\n\nINN 7707511820 Moscow 1,83 2,25 2,11 192 High 4 LLC LITEINYI 5\n\nINN 7838397950 Saint Petersburg 1,06 1,10 1,17 175 High 5 LLC KEYSUSTEMS TOUR\n\nINN 2130119586 Chuvash Republic 1,06 1,10 1,17 241 Strong 996 LLC SVOY TOUR AND TRAVEL\n\nINN 7730633954 Moscow -0,14 -0,12 -0,12 290 Medium 997 LLC VEGA\n\nINN 0256021810 Republic of Bashkortostan -0,11 -0,11 -0,12 367 Adequate 998 LLC HOTEL AND TOURIST COMPLEX LADOGA ESTATE\n\nINN 1007021940 Republic of Karelia -0,10 -0,11 -0,14 349 Adequate 999 LLC NTC INTOURIST\n\nINN 7717678890 Moscow -0,08 -0,02 -0,21 315 Adequate 1000 LLC TT-TRAVEL\n\nINN 7714775020 Moscow -4,34 -3,75 -4,96 306 Adequate\n\n— growth indicator in comparison with prior period, — decline indicator in comparison with prior period.\n\nFor the last ten years, the average values of TOP-1000 net assets showed the decreasing tendency (Picture 1).\n\nPicture 1. Change in average net assets value of travel agencies in 2008 – 2017\n\nFor the last three years, the share of enterprises with lack of property is decreasing (Picture 2).\n\nPicture 2. The share of enterprises with negative net assets value in ТОP-1000 in 2015 – 2017\n\nSales revenue\n\nIn 2017, the total revenue of 10 largest companies amounted to 24% from ТОP-1000 total revenue (Picture 3). This fact testifies high level of competition within the industry.\n\nPicture 3. Shares of TOP-10 in TOP-1000 total revenue for 2017\n\nIn general, over a ten-year period the decrease in average sales revenue is observed (Picture 4).\n\nPicture 4. Change in average revenue of travel agencies in 2008 – 2017\n\nProfit and loss\n\nIn 2017 profit of 10 largest companies amounted to 27% from TOP-1000 total profit (Picture 5).\n\nPicture 5. Shares of TOP-10 companies in TOP-1000 total profit for 2017\n\nFor the last ten years, the average net profit values show the growing tendency (Picture 6).\n\nPicture 6. Change in average net profit of travel agencies in 2008 – 2017\n\nOver a three-year period, the average net profit values of ТОP-1000 show the growing tendency, along with this the average net loss decreases (Picture 6).\n\nPicture 7. Change in average profit/loss of ТОP-1000 companies in 2015 – 2017\n\nMain financial ratios\n\nFor the last ten years, the average values of the current liquidity ratio were within the recommended values - from 1,0 to 2,0, with growing tendency (Picture 8).\n\nThe current liquidity ratio (ratio of total working capital to short-term liabilities) shows the sufficiency of company’s assets to meet short-term obligations.\n\nPicture 8. Change in average values of current liquidity ratio of travel agencies in 2008 – 2017\n\nFor the last ten years, the average values of ROI ratiowere mostly negative with growing tendency (Picture 9).\n\nThe ROI ratio is calculated as a ratio of net profit to sum of stockholder equity and long-term liabilities and shows the return from equity involved in commercial activities and long-term borrowed funds.\n\nPicture 9. Change in average values of ROI ratio in 2008 – 2017\n\nAssets turnover ratio is the ratio of sales revenue and company’s average total assets for a period. It characterizes the effectiveness of using of all available resources, regardless the source of their attraction. The ratio shows how many times per year the full cycle of production and circulation is performed, generating the corresponding effect in the form of profit.\n\nFor the last ten years, this business activity ratio demonstrated the downward trend (Picture 10).\n\nPicture 10. Change in average values of assets turnover ratio of travel agencies in 2008 – 2017\n\nProduction structure\n\nThe largest share of ТОP-1000 total revenue is occupied by the enterprises engaged in travel agency services (Picture 11).\n\nPicture 11. Distribution of activities in ТОP-1000 total revenue\n\n94% of ТОP-1000 companies are registered in the Unified register of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Russian Federal Tax Service. Herein, in 2017 their share in TOP-1000 total revenue amounted to 68%, it is significantly higher than indicator for the economy as a whole (Picture 12).\n\nPicture 12. Shares of small and medium-sized enterprises in ТОP-1000, %\n\nMain regions of activity\n\nТОP-1000 companies are unequally located across the country and registered in 70 regions of Russia. More than 76% of the largest enterprises in terms of revenue are located in Moscow, Moscow region and Saint Petersburg Picture 13).\n\nPicture 13. Distribution of TOP-1000 revenue by the regions of Russia\n\nFinancial position score\n\nAn assessment of the financial position of TOP-1000 companies shows that more than a half of them have stable or above average financial position (Picture 14).\n\nPicture 14. Distribution of TOP-1000 companies by financial position score\n\nSolvency index Globas\n\nMost of TOP-1000 companies got superior/high or strong/medium Solvency index Globas, this fact shows the ability of the companies to meet their obligations in time and fully (Picture 15).\n\nConclusion\n\nA complex assessment of activity of the largest Russian travel agencies, taking into account the main indexes, financial ratios and indicators, demonstrates the presence of favorable trends (Table 2).\n\nTable 2. Favorable and unfavorable trends, assessment factors Trends and assessment factors Relative share, % Growth/drawdown rate of average net assets value -10 Increase / decrease in the share of enterprises with negative net assets 10 Growth/drawdown rate of average revenue -10 Competition/ monopolization level 10 Growth/drawdown rate of average net profit (loss) 10 Increase / decrease in average net profit of TOP-1000 companies 10 Increase / decrease in average net loss of TOP-1000 companies 10 Increase / decrease in average values of current liquidity ratio 10 Increase / decrease in average values of ROI ratio 10 Increase / decrease in average values of assets turnover ratio, times -10 Share of small and medium-sized businesses in the industry by revenue more than 30% 10 Regional concentration -10 Financial position (the largest share) 10 Solvency index Globas (the largest share) 10 Average value of factors 4,3\n\n— favorable trend (factor), — unfavorable trend (factor)."
