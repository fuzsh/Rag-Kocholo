In 2020, the brand new river and sea flagship Mustai Karim was launched, the first luxury 5-star ship built in Russia in 60 years. A new type of ship was introduced in 2021 - a vessel with an inner tube of 0.9m, enabling it to sail on water, ice or even land. Propellers allow the vessel to turn in place, reverse and disembark passengers on any unequipped shore, giving travellers access to the most beautiful and inaccessible places along the route.
