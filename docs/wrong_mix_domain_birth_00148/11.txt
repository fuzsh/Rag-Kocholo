After co-founding Gary Sanchez Productions in 2006, Ferrell often received $20 million in earnings per film due to his acting salary plus producer credits.

Career Overview

Before he was making millions of people laugh on the big screen, Will Ferrell worked several small jobs. He graduated from the University of Southern California in 1990 with a B.A. in Sports Information. Having been an avid football player during high school, Ferrell was interested in pursuing a career in the sports industry.

Sports Broadcaster Internship & Minor Jobs

In the early 1990s, Ferrell began an internship for Sports Broadcasting at a local TV station. However, we quickly realized that the job wasn’t for him and started looking for something he was more passionate about.

While trying to pursue a comedy career, he also worked as a bank teller for Wells Fargo and a hotel valet. His first few days at both jobs did not end well: he accidentally ripped a baggage rack off a van by driving under a low beam at the hotel and came up almost $600 short in his first two days at the bank.

Breakout Comedy Films (2003-2008)

Ferrell worked on Saturday Night Live for several years before breaking through as an actor in the late 90s, but his mainstream popularity became evident in the mid-2000s.

It’s no secret that the 2000s produced some of the funniest films ever made, many of which, unfortunately, couldn’t have been made in today’s climate. The culture in the mid-late 2000s set the perfect scene for Ferrell’s comedy to shine.

During this time, Ferrell starred in movies such as Old School (2003), Elf (2003), Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), Blades of Glory (2007), Semi-Pro (2008), and Step Brothers (2009).

In 2003, Ferrell starred in Elf, later known as one of the funniest Christmas movies ever produced. However, the script was written initially with Jim Carrey in mind to play the role of Buddy. Ferrell has since shared that he was offered $29 million to make a sequel but declined.

Gary Sanchez Productions

In 2006, Will Ferrell founded the production company Gary Sanchez Productions alongside Adam McKay. From 2006 to 2019, the company produced some of Will Ferrell’s highest-grossing movies, producing impressive paydays.

Several actors in particular helped shape Ferrell’s career as his co-stars in multiple Gary Sanchez Productions movies, including:

John. C Reilly

Mark Wahlberg

Kevin Hart

Zach Galifianakis

Steve Carrell

Paul Rudd

John C. Reilly first starred alongside Ferrell in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby in 2006, just before the company was founded. The pair would co-star together again in 2008 on Step Brothers and in 2018 on Holmes & Watson, both produced by GSP.

Mark Wahlberg first co-starred with Will in 2010’s The Other Guys and later again in Daddy’s Home (2015) and Daddy’s Home 2 (2017). Ferrell starred with Hart in 2015’s Get Hard, Galifianakis in 2012’s The Campaign, and Rudd and Carrell in the two Anchorman movies.

Recent Work

Since Ferrell’s partnership with McKay ended in 2019 and Gloria Sanchez Productions acquired Gary Sanchez Productions, he has focused primarily on production work. In 2022, Ferrell starred alongside Ryan Reynolds in the Christmas musical film Spirited.

Acting Salary

In 2001, Ferrell became one of the highest-paid cast members of Saturday Night Live, earning $17,500 per episode. Since this was during the last two seasons that Will worked on SNL, it’s uncertain how long he had been earning this salary. Will appeared in 31 episodes between 2001 and 2002, earning an estimated $542,500.

In 2004, Ferrell earned a salary of $7 million for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. From then on, his reported salary per movie has always been $20 million. There are obviously undisclosed salaries missing from the list, but he has consistently been able to command $20 million per film for the last two decades.

Will Ferrell’s Net Worth

When we first discussed Will Ferrell’s net worth in 2019, it was estimated to be $100 million. Since then, he has increased his net worth by 60%, primarily due to his work as a producer through Gloria Sanchez Productions. He’s also received several more film paydays, the most notable of which is $20 million for Spirited, released in 2022.

Favorite Quotes from Will Ferrell

“I was never a class clown or anything like that, but I do remember being in the first grade and my teacher, Mr. Chad, told the class one day that we were going to do some exercises. He meant math exercises, but I stood up and started doing jumping jacks. To this day, I don’t know what possessed me to do that, but all my friends cracked up.” – Will Ferrell

“When I was ten, I wrote an essay on what I would be when I grew up and said I would be a professional soccer player and a comedian in the offseason.” – Will Ferrell

“It’s tough for me to get rid of clothes. I grew up in a household with a limited budget and we really had to make our nice clothes last, and so now I’ll get free pairs of shoes and this, that and the other and I’ll be like, ‘Oh great!’; even though it stresses me out that I don’t have enough room to put them, I can’t throw them away.” – Will Ferrell

“”I’d love to become like Bill Murray, who was so funny on ‘Saturday Night Live’ and has gone on to do some of the landmark comedies people like. And then to add this whole other phase to his career with ‘Lost in Translation’ and ‘Rushmore.’ I always felt to be able to have something similar to that would be great.” – Will Ferrell

“When I was a kid, ‘Land of the Lost’ was my favorite show, just because it was – in the landscape of Saturday morning cartoons – it was so unique. It was a live-action show and kids were in it, these creatures, these Sleestaks, and dinosaurs. Every week was a different adventure.” – Will Ferrell

Introduction

George Clooney is an American professional actor and producer with an estimated net worth of $500 Million.

Clooney has starred in almost a hundred films and has recently become a prolific producer. His films have grossed over $3 billion at the box office, earning him multiple $20 million+ paydays.

Like many of the world’s wealthiest actors, George Clooney’s net worth reflects his four-decade acting career combined with his work as a producer. In addition, the 2017 sale of his tequila brand, Casamigos Tequila, was estimated to have earned him roughly $300 million.

Career Overview

Before blowing up at the box office, Clooney studied broadcast journalism at the University of Cincinnati but later dropped out. He also worked odd jobs, including cutting tobacco for $3.30/hour, door-to-door insurance sales, shelve stocking, and construction work.

Extra Work & Early Roles (1978-1992)

At 17, he landed his first paying acting gig as an extra in Centennial in 1978. In the mid-80s, Clooney landed a significant role in the CBS sitcom E/R, which is not to be confused with his later work as Doug Ross in ER.

The series only lasted for two seasons, with Clooney appearing in just eight episodes, but it was enough to land him minor roles in other TV series such as Crazy Like a Fox, Hotel, Throb, and, more importantly, The Facts of Life. From 1985-1987, Clooney appeared in 17 episodes of The Facts of Life.

Breakthrough Acting Roles (1994-2000)

His breakthrough role came in 1994 when he landed the role of Doug Ross in the Drama series ER. Clooney starred in 107 episodes between 1994 and 2000, with reports stating his salary at $100,000/episode. However, a 1998 article from The Independent indicates the figures were in British pound sterling, which could have equaled $166,000/episode.

If we take the first figure as gospel, Clooney would have earned $10.7 million from his work on the series. He also returned as a guest star for one episode in 2009; however, his salary for that episode hasn’t been disclosed.

The popularity Clooney gained from starring in ER earned him roles in some of his highest-grossing movies to date, including One Fine Day (2006), The Peacemaker (1997), Batman & Robin (1997), and The Perfect Storm (2000).

Ocean’s Franchise (2001-2007)

While 2013’s Gravity remains Clooney’s highest-grossing movie, all three Ocean’s Franchise films he starred in have grossed more than $200 million worldwide.

Clooney starred in 2001’s Ocean’s Eleven alongside Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. The film grossed over $450 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing movie of the year. It remains on the list as Clooney’s second-highest-grossing film.

Ocean’s Twelve, released in 2004, featured the same co-stars and grossed $362.7 million worldwide. George starred in Ocean’s Thirteen in 2007, which wasn’t as popular as the previous installments but still reached $311.3 million at the box office.

Reports confirmed he earned $35 million for the first and third films combined, plus an estimated $15 million for Ocean’s Twelve. This brings his total earnings from the franchise up to $50 million.

Favorite Quotes from Ryan Gosling

“I loved growing up in Canada. It’s a great place to grow up, because – well, at least where I grew up – it’s very multicultural. There’s also good health care and a good education system.” – Ryan Gosling

“I’m glad I have an outlet. I don’t think I would put my aggression elsewhere, but working on the projects I have worked on, you tend to benefit personally from trying to wrap your head around the way other people look at the world.” – Ryan Gosling

“You can’t make a movie for everybody. You can’t go into it trying to alienate people, but you have to assume that you’re going to.” – Ryan Gosling

“You have to question a cinematic culture that preaches artistic expression, and yet would support a decision that is clearly a product of a patriarchy-dominant society, which tries to control how women are depicted on screen.” – Ryan Gosling

“I don’t know what art is exactly, but I’m pretty sure it’s not something you get paid to do. For myself acting is a job. I think it’s easier to get better at it if you don’t lose your identity in it. You do whatever you can to try to understand the character. Because they’re paying you to feel like you should be doing something.” – Ryan Gosling
