        "text": "Nick Kyrgios was born on April 27, 1995, in Canberra, the capital of Australia. Still, despite representing his country in both individual and team competitions, such as the Davis Cup, Kyrgios has managed to make headlines among his fellow Australians.\n\nHe recently sparked controversy after stressing that Australia is a racist country.\n\n\"I have dealt with bad racism,\" Kyrgios told Men's Health.\n\n\"Australia is a pretty racist country in general, one of the most racist countries in the world.\n\n\"Some of the most iconic people in sport in Australia have told me and my family to go back where we came from and this kind of bullshit.\n\n\"Stuff that isn't acceptable, not acceptable at all.\"\n\nHe refers to the fact that his father, Giorgos, is Greek, and his mother, Nortalia, is Malaysian.\n\nIt should be noted that he withdrew from the last Davis Cup finals, where Australia reached the final, due to his non-existent relationship with captain Lleyton Hewitt. He also withdrew at the last minute from the inaugural edition of the United Cup.\n\nNick Kyrgios' praise for Alcaraz\n\nThe flamboyant finalist of the last edition of Wimbledon had to withdraw from this year's edition due to his ongoing recovery from knee surgery.\n\nIn a recent interview, Kyrgios was full of praise for world number one Carlos Alcaraz.\n\n\"He's fun to watch,\" Kyrgios noted.\n\n\"He's got so much discipline and so much desire to do well, but he's got that showman about him, as well, which I like.\n\n\"He loves getting the crowd involved. He loves getting people chanting his name, which is pretty cool.\""
