But I can say I have positive scores so I like it against him.”\n\n“He’s unbelievably tough because his legs are unbelievable, his footwork. I don’t know. I like to play him. His game suits my game. I believe so.”\n\nKarlovic leads series 4-1\n\n2003 Wimbledon R128 Karlovic 16 76 63 64\n\n2005 Queens Club QF Karlovic 76 63\n\n2007 Tokyo QF Karlovic 76 76\n\n2009 French Open R 128 Hewitt 67 67 76 64 63\n\n2012 Queens Club R64 Karlovic 63 62\n\n———————————\n\n“He did things that aren’t possible.”\n\nGreg Rusedski: “My first memory of Hewitt was in Adelaide when he beat Andre Agassi in the semifinal. Then I saw him the week after in Australia. But he’s always been a guy that if you had to have someone play for your life, he’s the guy you’d want to play. Kind of reminiscent of the Jimmy Connors of old. A guy who maximized everything he possibly can and just loves the game and wants to keep on competing no matter what. He’s a walking miracle right now with that toe surgery and all the surgeries he’s had, to be playing the way that he is. He absolutely loves the game.”\n\nWhat was your most memorable match with Hewitt?\n\n“Probably the ones that I won. I beat him in Indianapolis one year. I lost to him a few times at Queens Club. But we always had really close, tight matches against Lleyton. He’s just a great competitor and someone who always wants to win.”\n\nCan you share an on or off court anecdote that captures Hewitt’s essence?\n\n“[Laughs] Let me see…that captures his essence…Probably all of those shouts of ‘COME ON’ every two seconds is the essence of him and then copying that thing that Mats Wilander used to do, his fist pump at winning those matches. But I just think the essence of Hewitt is just winning matches that he shouldn’t win. Just doing things that aren’t possible. Basically, between Sampras and Federer’s domination, he was the man in the middle who really got the No. 1 and then maximized everything he could. So it just shows you what sheer determination and desire can do.”\n\nHewitt leads series 4-3\n\n1999 Nottingham QF Rusedski 64 75\n\n2000 Basel QF Hewitt 76 62\n\n2000 Stuttgart QF Hewitt 64 64\n\n2001 San Jose QF Rusedski 57 61 64\n\n2001 Queens Club QF Hewitt 64 64\n\n2002 Indianapolis R16 Rusedski 76 64\n\n2005 Cincinnati Masters R32 Hewitt 16 75 64\n\n—————————\n\n“It just blew my mind.”\n\nTaylor Dent: “I saw him in the juniors. We grew up playing in the juniors. My first memory is kind of out of nowhere. He was always a good junior player but out of nowhere he got a wildcard into Adelaide and he ended up winning the thing. And he beat a lot of good players on the way to the title. It just blew my mind.”\n\nDescribe what it was like to play him?\n\n“It was tough for me. It was a disaster of a match up. I played him a lot of times. I only ever got him once. Actually in his hometown of Adelaide. And he was just tough. I liked attacking. And he was very accurate with his shots. He was able to dip it down at my feet. When I came to the net, he was able to lob it over my head. It posed a lot of problems for my style of game.”\n\nYou must have played extremely well the day you beat him?\n\n“You know what? It’s interesting. The courts were quick and I kind of changed the tactics a little bit. I ended up staying back at the baseline and just kind of chipping and waiting for a golden opportunity to come in. And he was a little bit off. He didn’t pass quite as well as normal. And that’s kind of the way how it goes.”\n\nDo you have a memory or anecdote that captures Hewitt’s essence, on or off court?\n\n“Off court, for me, he was always great. There was the stage when I was – I was getting good enough coming up to where I was being considered for Davis Cup. And so obviously with my background – my dad’s Australian – he gave me a call up to try and lobby for me to come play for the Australian team. And he was very nice on the phone and that’s kind of how he was. A good guy, a straight-forward guy. He doesn’t really beat-around-the-bush too much and I appreciate that.”\n\nHewitt leads series 5-1\n\n2001 Wimbledon R64 Hewitt 16 75 63 67 63\n\n2001 Indianapolis R32 Hewitt 62 76\n\n2003 Scottsdale SF Hewitt 62 64\n\n2005 Adelaide QF Dent 76 63\n\n2005 Wimbledon R16 Hewitt 64 64 67 63\n\n2005 US Open R32 Hewitt 63 36 67 62 75\n\n———————————–\n\n“I expected to steamroll the kid.”\n\nVince Spadea: “I played against Hewitt in the 1998 quarters at Adelaide, his hometown in the south of Australia, when he was a sixteen year old wildcard. Everyone was wondering how he got a wildcard in the first place, because he was like No. 500 in the world at the time and nobody had ever heard of him. Some of the other Australian players were mystified. He had just played a Satellite, which is an even lower pro tournament than a Challenger, that has since been mostly phased out in favor of Futures, the week before Adelaide, and he had lost to a nobody. Our match was a night match, center court. I see this little guy with long blond hair who looks like a surfer, walk out on the court. I figure: ‘I’m in the semis. This kid is sixteen and he looked weak, inexperienced, unrehearsed, and unpolished.'”\n\n“The match begins and he’s holding his own. He keeps on hitting balls in the court. I wasn’t playing strongly enough or consistently enough to overpower him even though I’ve got him outweighed by about forty pounds. I end up losing the first set 7-5. Now I’m thinking: ‘What does this kid think he’s doing?’ He didn’t miss one shot long the entire set. My dad, who was coaching me, said after the match, ‘He missed into the net and he missed wide but he never missed past the baseline.’ Whenever Hewitt won a big point he screeched out, ‘COME ON’ and punched the air with his fist. I thought that was a little annoying and cocky of him but I didn’t let it bother or intimidate me. I won the second set 6-3. I had been working with Jim Pierce (coach and father of Mary Pierce), so I was in great shape. I had been killing myself in training. I expected to steamroll the kid in the third set. But instead, he put his game into another gear and beat me soundly 6-1 to win the match.”\n\n“The next day I was sitting eating breakfast with my dad in the player’s cafeteria and Brad Gilbert, coach of Andre Agassi, walked up to us and completely ignored me. He approached my dad and said, ‘Your son had Hewitt last night but he choked. Andre will show you how to handle the kid tonight.'”\n\n“Of course, Hewitt straight-setted Agassi 76 76 and then went on to win the tournament. Hewitt has gone on to win almost twenty million in his career, along with a Wimbledon and U.S. Open title. He’s a true warrior on the court. He doesn’t get fazed by disappointment or failure. He doesn’t worry about if he’s hitting the ball great or if he’s winning or losing, he just enjoys the battle. The only other player who battled as successfully as Hewitt was Jimmy Connors. Hewitt will never give up and he doesn’t mind if he has to win hard or easy. He’s one of the greatest competitors in tennis.”\n\nHewitt leads series 7-0\n\n1998 Adelaide QF Hewitt 75 36 61\n\n1999 Lyon SF Hewitt 63 63\n\n2003 Indian Wells Masters Hewitt 75 61\n\n2006 Sydney R32 Hewitt 26 75 63\n\n2006 San Jose SF Hewitt 63 64\n\n2006 Washington DC Hewitt R32 67 76 64\n\n2007 Las Vegas RR Hewitt 63 63\n\n————————–\n\n“He was a lion on the court.”\n\nDavide Sanguinetti: “I played him when he was No. 1 in the world. He was the best. I remember once in Cincinnati and I retired. Because my daughter was gonna be born so I had to leave. So I found an excuse and I run away with it. But I don’t think I had a chance with him that day [smiles].”\n\nWhat was it like to play Hewitt at his best (in previous round of Cincinnati match with Sanguinetti, Hewitt beat Robby Ginepri 6-0 6-0)?\n\n“I think it was tough to make a point because he was such a fighter on the court, which he still is, but before he could run a little faster than now. And to make a point you had to sweat because of the pain. He was all around. You cannot say he had like unbelievable forehand, backhand, but he was an all around player. That he put all his heart out on the court. He was a lion on the court.”\n\nHewitt leads series 2-0\n\n2001 ‘S-Hertogenbosch R32 Hewitt 62 61\n\n2002 Cincinnati Masters R32 Hewitt 50 (ret.)\n\n———————————\n\n“Turning point in tennis history.”\n\nIvan Ljubicic: “When I played Hewitt he had just won Wimbledon. He was at the top of his game. I remember that I qualified and I think it was quarterfinals so for me it was a great week anyway. And it was 7-6 6-7 and he ended up winning 6-4. I was 5-1 down and I came back to 5-4 and he won it. But it’s incredible that we played only once and we were around together on the Tour maybe fifteen years. And not ever close – I can’t remember like even being close to playing him. So it’s unbelievable. But obviously he is a great fighter and I think the way he managed his career – we would love that he played more. For so many years after U.S. Open he would take a break and prepare for Australian Open. I feel like, with all the injuries that he had, and he had many, the type of game that he played, he managed his tennis incredibly well. To be able to be still on the Tour at 33 and still fighting and playing at this level.”\n\nDid anything surprise you about him?\n\n“No, not really. The thing is that he’s an unbelievable fighter. But what I say – it doesn’t mean he’s only saying ‘COME ON’ – he finds the way to win matches. He’s always very, very difficult to play. Obviously, with now, it’s different than it was ten years ago. But to win Wimbledon, to win U.S. Open with the game that he had, back then, it was a turning point in the history of tennis. Because he was the first one really to win Wimbledon from the baseline, like playing this way, not like Agassi, because he was still hitting the balls. He was the first one to really, like, demolish Sampras’ serve in the final of U.S. Open. So he is, let’s say, the first one of this new generation of really, really solid players.”\n\nDid you get along well with Hewitt off court? Ever practice together?\n\n“We practiced a few times. He’s really shy, actually, you know, incredibly. Off the court he’s kind of calm, doesn’t really talk to anybody, really shy. We obviously, being of similar age, we got along because we spent so much time together on the Tour. So I like him a lot, actually.”\n\nHewitt leads head to head 1-0\n\n2001 Cincinnati Masters QF Hewitt 76 67 64\n\n———————————————\n\n“Rios told me Hewitt was going to be No. 1.”\n\nGuillermo Canas: “I have a lot of memories of playing Hewitt. I played many times against him. I remember once when he was really young we met in Delray Beach, Florida. I think the first time we played was in qualies of one tournament. He beat me. And then I beat him in Houston, I think in ’99. I think the first time I make a final in ATP was against him. I lost in the final to him in ‘S-Hertogenbosch. I beat him in round 16 in Roland Garros once and I lost once in five sets. But my memories…it was always really tough fighting when we play each other. It was long matches. I think he’s one of the greatest competitors of this sport.”\n\nDid you enjoy to play Hewitt?\n\n“I loved to play him. I know what I have in front of me, is a guy who is going to fight for every point, like me. And always we were at certain sides of the court a lot and always we have really tough matches.”\n\nAny interaction with Hewitt off court? Ever practice together?\n\n“We practice some. But we don’t have a relationship, like two guys who played the Tour for many years. I know him, I say Hi all the time. He travels the last years with a guy I know really well.”\n\nDid anything surprise you about Hewitt?\n\n“I’m not surprised. I know him when he was 15, watching on TV he won his first ATP title in his hometown. And I know he’s going to be a really good player. Every year he surprises me more and more, when he got to No. 1 in the world and some moments. It was really, really tough to beat him on any courts. But I have one memory when he was so young. I practice with Marcelo Rios. At that moment Rios was No. 1 or No. 2 in the world. And he told me, ‘That guy is gonna be the next No. 1.” Eventhough he was in the forties in the rankings. It was funny. I said, ‘No way.’ And Rios was right. He told me he was going to be No. 1. He was right.”\n\nHewitt leads head to head 6-2\n\n1999 Orlando R16 Canas 63 63\n\n1999 Delray Beach R32 Hewitt 67 (12) 62 64\n\n1999 Nottingham R16 Hewitt 62 75\n\n2001 French Open R16 Hewitt 36 67 62 63 63\n\n2001 ‘S-Hertogenbosch F Hewitt 63 64\n\n2001 Stuttgart R16 Hewitt 36 61 64\n\n2002 French Open R16 Canas 67 (1)76 (13) 64 63\n\n2007 Wimbledon R32 Hewitt 64 36 63 64\n\n————————————— This is an excerpt of the book “Facing Hewitt”\n\nHewitt ruled the sport for two years\n\n<< Patty Schnyder Update: Still Grinding at 37"
