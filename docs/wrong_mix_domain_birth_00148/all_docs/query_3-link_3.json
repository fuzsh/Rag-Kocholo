        "text": "1. By Zoe McIntosh TENNIS! Lleyton Hewitt- Ball Boys- -Sam Stosur -Tennis Gear\n\n2. TENNIS HISTORY! The origination of tennis is not quite known but many experts believe that it was invented during 1873 (then called lawn tennis) by Waltor Clopton Tennis goes back to nearly 1,000 years ago known to be very popular in the 12th centaury in France. The game had spread across to England during the reign of Henry vii racquets were introduced. The people of England introduced the tennis court but was much narrower than what we use today and they were indoors. A very interesting point is that a rule they could use was that they could rebound off the walls to return to the opponent. < What they wore. >how they played it.\n\n3. THE RULES OF TENNIS! You must always start on the right hand side of the court (the forehand side) and behind the base line in singles and doubles to serve to the opposite side of the court in the ‘servers square.’ The ball must bounce into the square and the opponent can hit the ball back anywhere into the court but must be inside the inner lines. If the receiver can not hit the ball back this is called an ace and you receive a point. If the ball continues to be hit back and forth, this is called a rally and as soon as someone misses, hits the ball out or hits the ball into the net the rally stops and the person that does not do any of these wins the next point. base line, serve on the right. Receive the ball on the right (forehand side) When serving the ball must land in the opposite side. Hit the ball inside the inner lanes.\n\n4. EQUIPMENT USED! Obviously you need a Tennis racquet, but you have to make sure its your size so that you can swing it easily. You need a normal tennis ball. Many adults and some kids like to use sweat bands on their head and their wrists to keep the sweat away from your face and so that your hands don’t become slippery. A breathable top and shorts for males, a dress or skirt and singlet is great for females. Its best to get one that fits firm on you so that its not swaying around whilst your trying to play hard. Dress for females > Skirt and singlet for females > T-shirt and shorts for males. > < Sazenger tennis ball Racquet for anyone >\n\n5. SPONSORS!

At three years of age she was doing 2 hour practersics with her father Richard Williams. In 1995 Serena turned into a pro tennis player along with her sister Venus. 2009 Serena made a a bad decision and was fined and put on a probation for illegally threatening a lines women, but she quickly moved on from this bad remark.

I have been playing tennis now for approximately 2 years now. I played over at West but recently just got moved over to Treloar Park in East Tamworth. I loved playing tennis because it was great meeting new people as none of my friends play. I have not played for a few weeks now as I originally hurt my ankle, I then went back once and then haven't gone back since as I hurt my ankle again! I don’t think I will go back as I am finding it a lot easier to have Friday afternoons off. (I still believe it’s a great sport thought!)\n\n20. WIMBLEDON!

The French Open (also known as the Roland garros) is a major tournament held over two weeks, between late May and early June in Paris France, at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Open is the only tournament that is played on hard clay courts, clay slows down the ball and also makes the ball bounce much higher compared to grass courts or hard courts. This can be a disadvantage of big servers and volleyers. This makes it harder to serve based players to dominate on the surface.\n\n23. TECHNICAL WORDS! Volley- A volley is a hit when right up close to the net. Players usually smash the ball down to a space of where there is no player. Let- A let is a serve when the ball skims across the top of the net and goes in. This then means that you get either one more serve or two more. If it was your first serve and you do a let, that means you get two more, but if its your second serve you get one more. Ace- An ace is when you serve the ball that hard that it goes in and the opponent doesn’t even get a chance to hit it. <volley <let\n\n24. THE DAVIS CUP! The Davis Cup was first contested in 1899, it is the premier international team event in mens tennis. From 1905 till 1919, Australia competed as an Australasian team.
