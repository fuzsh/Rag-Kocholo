        "text": "18 editions of The Tennis Podcast produced in 18 days from Roland Garros in Paris. They were gruelling, challenging and sometimes upsetting, but also uplifting, amusing and heartwarming. For the first time we saw our online community ‘The Barge’ in full swing during a Grand Slam tournament, and the thousands of messages exchanged between our listeners, as they soaked up the action, were wonderful to witness. Upon publishing the final show, recorded next to the statue of Rene Lacoste, it was pleasing to see that we had finished the tournament as the No.1 ranked tennis podcast in the US, UK, Australia and Canada, among many others. On to the grass.\n\nLeaving a Grand Slam tournament always comes with a competing mix of emotions. I first came to Melbourne to cover the Australian Open 21 years ago. The event was as good as ever (middle-of-the-night finishes aside), and the success, ambition and execution of the people that put it on is mind-blowingly impressive. But truth is, I’ve never wanted to get home more than this year. The day before leaving for Melbourne, we held the funeral for my Dad, Trevor Law, whose entrepreneurial spirit, enthusiasm, love, support, and belief in me gave me the confidence to go for it all those years ago, and to continue going for it when we launched The Tennis Podcast. I miss him. A few days in, news came through whilst I was commentating on a tie-break for BBC Radio at close to midnight that our dear colleague, the brilliant, long-time Daily Mail Tennis Correspondent, Mike Dickson, had collapsed and died. He was 59. He had been telling me two days earlier about his young son’s year-out travel adventures with a twinkle of amusement in his eye, and great pride. I respect my media colleagues immensely. Since meeting Mike 28 years ago and reading his work for longer, I’ve not respected anyone more than him. He was the first person I’d go to read for new information, and a definitive verdict. Russell Fuller and I on BBC radio attempted to digest this devastating news in real time and pay instant tribute to him. I tried to do the same on the podcast shortly after. I can now only think of Mike’s family, friends and my media room colleagues, who worked more closely with him than I did. It was such a terrible shock and blow. With three days to go, I became unwell. Nothing serious, thankfully, but enough to rule me out of the finals weekend BBC Radio commentaries and the last couple of Tennis Podcasts. I feel happy and lucky to be home, and very thankful for the kindness and support of my colleagues (particularly my wonderful Tennis Podcast co-hosts Catherine Whitaker and Matt Roberts)."
