He tragically died of a drug overdose in 2015.\n\nShe released many EP's including I'm Not Here. She went on release This Isn't Happening in 2015 and music 2 die 2 in 2016.\n\nShe was became known for her some of her earlier hit singles like 'Selfie' and 'Glen Coco.'\n\nRogers opened up about her ambitions, her history of drug addiction and the death of her mother in an 2018 interview with Pitchfork.\n\n\"My mom would be really tight with me if I used her as an excuse to fall off,\" she said. \"It's just more reason to work and get this s--- done. I didn't feel like I deserved to be making a living off talking about my life yet because I just couldn't relate to enough people.\n\n\"It wasn't just the drug-addict thing, but also all the behaviours that come with it, all the situations you end up in, and the people you end up around just living that life.\"\n\nIf you, or someone you know would like to talk to someone confidentially about addiction, contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or visit Reach Out.
