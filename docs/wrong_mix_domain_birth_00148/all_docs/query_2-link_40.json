        "text": "A sellout crowd packed into the city to watch one of South Australia’s sons give a one off exhibition and he gave them occasional moments to cheer but was ultimately outclassed by Czech World No.7 Tomas Berdych — 6-2 6-3.\n\nHewitt started the match slowely and gave up his opening service game after leading 30-0 with a series of unforced errors.\n\nBerdych was solid up the other end and Hewitt dropped serve again in the fourth game, his radar well off on the forehand.\n\nBerdych held for 5-0 and the crowd was in almost stunned silence before Hewitt settled and began making a contest of it.\n\nHe found the radar on the forehand and had some nice moments around the net to hold and then break for 2-5, but the big Czech kept pressuring in the breezey conditions and broke again to take the opening set.\n\nHewitt’s first service percentage picked up early in the second set an he began holding more comfortably as games went on serve.\n\nBut Berdych was the more solid player from the back and he broke in the sixth game to go 4-2 up.\n\nHewitt threw everything at the Czech in the following game, the crowd treated to some world class rallying but Berdych’s serve and ultimately a lucky net-cord ensured he held after several dueces.\n\nHewitt held and then had 15-40 on the following game, the trademark fight on show but his forehand again let him downat in opportune moments and Berdych closed it out."
