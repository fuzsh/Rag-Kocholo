Hewitt played Australian Rules football until he was 13, when he dedicated himself to tennis. He became the leading Australian junior tennis player in 1996. Two years later he secured his first professional singles title. By the end of 1999, he had advanced to number 22 in the world and had helped Australia to win the Davis Cup. He concluded 2000 ranked seventh in the world after having swept 61 of the 80 matches he contested that season, establishing himself as the first teenager since Pete Sampras in 1990 to garner four singles titles in a year.\n\nIn 2001 Hewitt was the most prolific winner on the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) circuit, claiming 80 match victories and becoming the youngest man to have finished a year at number one since the official ATP world rankings were introduced in 1973. Hewitt defeated Sampras to win the 2001 U.S. Open, his first grand slam title. Ten months later Hewitt excelled on the grass courts at the All-England Club and ousted Argentina's David Nalbandian to win the 2002 Wimbledon tournament. Hewitt failed to retain his U.S. Open title that year, however, losing to American Andre Agassi in the semifinals. He won the Indian Wells ATP Tennis Master's Tournament in both 2002 and 2003, defeating England's Tim Henman and Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, respectively. Though he failed to capture any grand slam titles in the ensuing years, he did advance to the finals in both the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2005 Australian Open."
