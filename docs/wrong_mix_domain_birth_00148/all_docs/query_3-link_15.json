Giving in this way also brings them happiness.” Ms Westbury said one of the group members is legally blind and wanted to help so much that she decided to crochet a rug in light colours from memory. “The result was she crocheted a couple of rugs, beanies and scarves!” Every piece of clothing will be donated to the Gosford Refugee Group. Thank you ladies – what an amazing job. 👏👏 #WeAreUniting #AgedCare #community #team #NFP\n\nExciting times at Uniting! We recently held a Uniting Innovation Masterclass, hosted by our fantastic Social Innovation Hub. 🎓 Eighteen of our dedicated practice leaders and operations staff worked tirelessly, tackling pressing issues such as youth mental health and affordable housing. 🌏🏠 What made this process unique? Real-world, hands-on research. Our team reached out to get a diverse array of perspectives, which led to the creation of truly innovative solutions. The program concluded with the team presenting their pitches to Uniting's senior leaders - this journey reflects our our ambition to be a bold and imaginative workforce. We're buzzing with excitement to see where this new wave of innovative solutions will lead us. 🚀 #InnovationMasterclass #WeAreUniting #HustleLikeaCorporate #ActLikeaNFP\n\n📲 Scan the QR code and follow our campaign for Fair Treatment. The campaign was launched in 2018 by the Uniting Church NSW/ACT and Uniting and now includes more than 70 partner organisations. We all want to live in a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, including people who use drugs. To achieve this, we need increased access to harm reduction, prevention and treatment services, particularly in rural and regional areas, and a compassionate, health and wellbeing-based response to personal drug possession. Stand with us, and together we can reduce shame and stigma and create positive change for our community. ❤️ #HarmReductionWorks #ReduceStigma #StopShame #HumanCentred #FairTreatment #ThoughtLeadership #HealthandWellbeing\n\nThe team at Uniting St Matthews Early Learning recently welcomed the original Yellow Wiggle Greg Page - who officially handed over an automated external defibrillator (AED) as part of his Heart of the Nation charity. 🟡🤩 Heart of the Nation is committed to increasing Australia's cardiac arrest survival rates through education, access to AEDs, and fostering a community where every individual is empowered to act in an emergency. A big thank you to Greg and the Heart of the Nation team. 👏 #WeAreUniting #NFP #EarlyEducation #Educator #Earlylearning\n\nWe are very pleased that a Drug Summit has finally been announced and will be held in October and December in both Sydney and regional areas in NSW. #GoodNewsStory We know that community support for health and welfare-based responses to drug use continues to grow. We thank our Fair Treatment community (you) for uniting with us as we advocate for this opportunity to have an open and honest conversation about alcohol and other drugs and how we treat those who use them. Please follow and share this milestone announcement as we continue our mission for @fairtreatmentau for all.
