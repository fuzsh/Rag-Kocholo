        "text": "Born: 24/2/81\n\nNationality: Australian\n\nSeeded: 15\n\nWorld ranking: 15\n\nAustralian Open best:\n\n4th round (2003, 2000)\n\nRecent record:\n\n2003: 4th round\n\n2002: 1st round\n\n2001: 3rd round\n\nBy most people's standards, Lleyton Hewitt endured a disappointing 2003.\n\nBeginning the year as world number one, he ended it outside the top 10 and reached only one Grand Slam quarter-final.\n\nThe nadir came at Wimbledon when, as defending champion, he was ousted in the first round by unheralded Croatian Ivo Karlovic.\n\nHowever, Hewitt insisted his only goal for the year was to win the Davis Cup with Australia - and he was true to his word as the Aussies lifted the Cup in December.\n\nAndy Roddick, Roger Federer and Juan Carlos Ferrero have dominated the tennis scene in the last 12 months - but Hewitt should not be discounted.\n\nHis fiercely competitive spirit has been sorely missed in the latter stages of Grand Slam tournaments, and despite a relatively quiet year he nonetheless picked up two titles.\n\nPast form suggests the turnaround may not come at the Australian Open, which has never been a happy hunting ground.\n\nDespite his brilliance on hard courts, he has never gone past the fourth round in front of his home fans.\n\nBut he remains one of the favourites with the bookies, and the top seeds will hope to avoid him in the draw."
