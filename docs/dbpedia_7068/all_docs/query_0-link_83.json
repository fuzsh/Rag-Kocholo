        "meta_description": "Abstract. Projections of changes in extreme droughts under future\nclimate conditions are associated with large uncertainties, owing to the\ncomplex genesis of droughts and large model uncertainty in the atmospheric\ndynamics. In this study we investigate the impact of global warming on soil\nmoisture drought severity in west-central Europe by employing pseudo global\nwarming (PGW) experiments, which project the 1980â2020 period in a globally\nwarmer world. The future analogues of present-day drought episodes allow for\ninvestigation of changes in drought severity conditional on the historic\nday-to-day evolution of the atmospheric circulation. The 2018 west-central European drought is the most severe drought in the\n1980â2020 reference period in this region. Under 1.5,\n2 and 3ââC global warming, this drought episode\nexperiences strongly enhanced summer temperatures but a fairly modest soil\nmoisture drying response compared to the change in climatology. This is\nprimarily because evaporation is already strongly moisture-constrained\nduring present-day conditions, limiting the increase in evaporation and thus\nthe modulation of the temperature response under PGW. Increasing\nprecipitation in winter, spring and autumn limits or prevents an earlier\ndrought onset and duration. Nevertheless, the drought severity, defined as\nthe cumulative soil moisture deficit volume, increases considerably, with\n20â% to 39â% under 2ââC warming. The extreme drought frequency in the 1980â2020 period strongly increases\nunder 2ââC warming. Several years without noticeable droughts\nunder present-day conditions show very strong drying and warming. This\nresults in an increase in 2003-like drought occurrences, compounding with\nlocal summer temperature increases considerably aboveÂ 2ââC. Even without taking into account a (potentially large) dynamical response to\nclimate change, drought risk in west-central Europe is strongly enhanced\nunder global warming. Owing to increases in drought frequency, severity and\ncompounding heat, a reduction in recovery times between drought episodes is\nexpected to occur. Our physical climate storyline provides evidence\ncomplementing conventional large-ensemble approaches and is intended to\ncontribute to the formulation of effective adaptation strategies.",

We tested the sensitivity of hydrological predictions to changes in model parameters that reflect ecosystem adaptation to climate and potential land use change. We estimated a 34 % increase in the root zone storage parameter under +2 K global warming, resulting in up to 15 % less streamflow in autumn, due to 14 % higher summer evaporation, compared to a stationary system.\n\nComparing interannual variability in three regional single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) over Europe\n\nFabian von Trentini, Emma E.

They all show good consistency with observational data. The magnitude of variability and the future development are similar in many cases. In general, variability increases for summer indicators and decreases for winter indicators.\n\nRapid attribution of the May/June 2016 flood-inducing precipitation in France and Germany to climate change\n\nGeert Jan van Oldenborgh, Sjoukje Philip, Emma Aalbers, Robert Vautard, Friederike Otto, Karsten Haustein, Florence Habets, Roop Singh, and Heidi Cullen\n\nHydrol.

After such an event the question is always posed to what extent it can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using observations and five model ensembles we give a first answer. For the 3-day precipitation extremes over the Seine and Loire basins that caused the flooding all methods agree that the probability has increased by a factor of about two. For 1-day precipitation extremes in Germany the methods disagree.\n\nSea Level Rise in Europe: Summary for Policy Makers\n\nBart van den Hurk, Nadia Pinardi, Alexander Bisaro, Giulia Galluccio, Jose Jimenez, Kate Larkin, Angelique Melet, Lavinia Giulia Pomarico, Kristin Richter, Kanika Singh, Roderik van de Wal, and Gundula Winter\n\nState Planet Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/sp-2024-3,https://doi.org/10.5194/sp-2024-3, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for SP\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Summary for Policy Makers compiles findings from ‘Sea Level Rise in Europe: 1st Assessment Report of the Knowledge Hub on Sea Level Rise’. It covers knowledge gaps, observations, projections, impacts, adaptation measures, decision making principles, and governance challenges. It provides information for each European basin (Mediterranean & Black Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea, Atlantic, Arctic) and aims to assist policymakers in enhancing the preparedness of European coasts for sea level rise.\n\nAre dependencies of extreme rainfall on humidity more reliable in convection-permitting climate models?\n\nGeert Lenderink, Nikolina Ban, Erwan Brisson, SÃ©golÃ¨ne Berthou, Virginia Edith CortÃ©s-HernÃ¡ndez, Elizabeth Kendon, Hayley Fowler, and Hylke de Vries\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-132,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-132, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture extreme rainfall events are influenced by changes in both absolute and relative humidity. The impact of increasing absolute humidity is reasonably well understood, but the role of relative humidity decreases over land remains largely unknown. Using hourly observations from France and The Netherlands, we find that lower relative humidity generally leads to more intense rainfall extremes. This relation is only captured well in recently developed convection-permitting climate models.\n\nThe movement of atmospheric blocking systems: can we still assume quasi-stationarity?\n\nJonna van Mourik, Hylke de Vries, and Michiel Baatsen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-999,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-999, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric blockings are quasi-stationary high-pressure areas with large influences on our weather. We show that using the most common blocking index does not only lead to stationary blocks, but also to east- and westward moving blocks. These respective moving blocks are found to have different characteristics in size and location. Even though they are not stationary, they still impact our surface temperatures. Thus, for impact analyses no restriction in propagation velocity is needed.\n\nCompound flood impacts from Hurricane Sandy on New York City in climate-driven storylines\n\nHenrique M. D. Goulart, Irene Benito Lazaro, Linda van Garderen, Karin van der Wiel, Dewi Le Bars, Elco Koks, and Bart van den Hurk\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

We find that sea level rise can quadruple coastal flood volumes, while changes in Sandy's landfall location can double flood volumes. Our results show the need for diverse scenarios that include climate change and internal variability and for integrating climate information into a modelling framework, offering insights for high-impact event assessments.\n\nSea Level Rise in Europe: Knowledge gaps identified through a participatory approach\n\nJosÃ© A. JimÃ©nez, Antonio Bonaduce, Michael Depuydt, Giulia Galluccio, Bart van den Hirk, H. E. Markus Meier, Nadia Pinardi, Lavinia G. Pomarico, Natalia Vazquez Riveiros, and Gundula Winter\n\nState Planet Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/sp-2023-34,https://doi.org/10.5194/sp-2023-34, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for SP\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe European Knowledge Hub on Sea Level Rise (SLR) has done a scoping study involving stakeholders from government and academia to identify gaps and needs in SLR information, impacts, and policies across Europe. Gaps in regional SLR projections and uncertainties were found, while concerns were raised about shoreline erosion, emerging problems like saltwater intrusion and ineffective adaptation plans. The need for improved communication to make better decisions on SLR adaptation was highlighted.\n\nStrengthening gradients in the tropical west Pacific connect to European summer temperatures on sub-seasonal timescales\n\nChiem van Straaten, Dim Coumou, Kirien Whan, Bart van den Hurk, and Maurice Schmeits\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 887–903, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-887-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-887-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVariability in the tropics can influence weather over Europe. This study evaluates a summertime connection between the two. It shows that strongly opposing west Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies have occurred more frequently since 1980, likely due to a combination of long-term warming in the west Pacific and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Three to six weeks later, the distribution of hot and cold airmasses over Europe is affected.\n\nValidation of boreal summer tropicalâextratropical causal links in seasonal forecasts\n\nGiorgia Di Capua, Dim Coumou, Bart van den Hurk, Antje Weisheimer, Andrew G. Turner, and Reik V. Donner\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 701–723, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-701-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-701-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHeavy rainfall in tropical regions interacts with mid-latitude circulation patterns, and this interaction can explain weather patterns in the Northern Hemisphere during summer. In this analysis we detect these tropical–extratropical interaction pattern both in observational datasets and data obtained by atmospheric models and assess how well atmospheric models can reproduce the observed patterns. We find a good agreement although these relationships are weaker in model data.\n\nEcosystem adaptation to climate change: the sensitivity of hydrological predictions to time-dynamic model parameters\n\nLaurÃ¨ne J.

We tested the sensitivity of hydrological predictions to changes in model parameters that reflect ecosystem adaptation to climate and potential land use change. We estimated a 34 % increase in the root zone storage parameter under +2 K global warming, resulting in up to 15 % less streamflow in autumn, due to 14 % higher summer evaporation, compared to a stationary system.\n\nModel development in practice: a comprehensive update to the boundary layer schemes in HARMONIE-AROME cycle 40\n\nWim C. de Rooy, Pier Siebesma, Peter Baas, Geert Lenderink, Stephan R. de Roode, Hylke de Vries, Erik van Meijgaard, Jan Fokke Meirink, Sander Tijm, and Bram van 't Veen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 1513–1543, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1513-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-1513-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a comprehensive model update to the boundary layer schemes. Because the involved parameterisations are all built on widely applied frameworks, the here-described modifications are applicable to many NWP and climate models. The model update contains substantial modifications to the cloud, turbulence, and convection schemes and leads to a substantial improvement of several aspects of the model, especially low cloud forecasts.\n\nComparing seasonal streamflow forecast systems for management of a fresh water reservoir in the Netherlands\n\nRuud T. W. L. Hurkmans, Bart van den Hurk, Maurice J. Schmeits, Fredrik Wetterhall, and Ilias G. Pechlivanidis\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-604,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-604, 2022\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeasonal forecasts can help in safely and efficiently managing a fresh water reservoir in the Netherlands. We compare hydrological forecast systems of the river Rhine, the lakes most important source and analyze forecast skill for over 1993–2016 and for specific extreme years. On average, forecast skill is high in spring due to Alpine snow and smaller in summer. Dry summers appear to be more predictable, skill increases with event extremity. In those cases, seasonal forecasts are valuable tools.\n\nImpact of Eurasian autumn snow on the winter North Atlantic Oscillation in seasonal forecasts of the 20th century\n\nMartin Wegmann, Yvan Orsolini, Antje Weisheimer, Bart van den Hurk, and Gerrit Lohmann\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 2, 1245–1261, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-1245-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-1245-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNorthern Hemisphere winter weather is influenced by the strength of westerly winds 30 km above the surface, the so-called polar vortex. Eurasian autumn snow cover is thought to modulate the polar vortex. So far, however, the modeled influence of snow on the polar vortex did not fit the observed influence. By analyzing a model experiment for the time span of 110 years, we could show that the causality of this impact is indeed sound and snow cover can weaken the polar vortex.\n\nStorylines of weather-induced crop failure events under climate change\n\nHenrique M. D. Goulart, Karin van der Wiel, Christian Folberth, Juraj Balkovic, and Bart van den Hurk\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1503–1527, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1503-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1503-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAgriculture is sensitive to weather conditions and to climate change. We identify the weather conditions linked to soybean failures and explore changes related to climate change. Additionally, we build future versions of a historical extreme season under future climate scenarios. Results show that soybean failures are likely to increase with climate change. Future events with similar physical conditions to the extreme season are not expected to increase, but events with similar impacts are.\n\nStatistical modelling and climate variability of compound surge and precipitation events in a managed water system: a case study in the Netherlands\n\nVÃ­ctor M. Santos, MercÃ¨ Casas-Prat, Benjamin Poschlod, Elisa Ragno, Bart van den Hurk, Zengchao Hao, TÃ­mea KalmÃ¡r, Lianhua Zhu, and Husain Najafi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Data (from a previous study) were obtained from a physical-based hydrological model driven by a regional climate model large ensemble, providing a time series expanding up to 800 years in length that ensures stable statistics. The length of the data set allows for a sensitivity assessment of the proposed statistical framework to natural climate variability.\n\nComparing interannual variability in three regional single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) over Europe\n\nFabian von Trentini, Emma E. Aalbers, Erich M. Fischer, and Ralf Ludwig\n\nEarth Syst.

They all show good consistency with observational data. The magnitude of variability and the future development are similar in many cases. In general, variability increases for summer indicators and decreases for winter indicators.\n\nAn update of IPCC climate reference regions for subcontinental analysis of climate model data: definition and aggregated datasets\n\nMaialen Iturbide, JosÃ© M.

This revision was guided by the basic principles of climatic consistency and model representativeness (in particular for the new CMIP6 simulations). We also present a new dataset of monthly CMIP5 and CMIP6 spatially aggregated information using the new reference regions and describe a worked example of how to use this dataset to inform regional climate change studies.\n\nDominant patterns of interaction between the tropics and mid-latitudes in boreal summer: causal relationships and the role of timescales\n\nGiorgia Di Capua, Jakob Runge, Reik V. Donner, Bart van den Hurk, Andrew G. Turner, Ramesh Vellore, Raghavan Krishnan, and Dim Coumou\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 1, 519–539, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-519-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-1-519-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the interactions between the tropical convective activity and the mid-latitude circulation in the Northern Hemisphere during boreal summer. We identify two circumglobal wave patterns with phase shifts corresponding to the South Asian and the western North Pacific monsoon systems at an intra-seasonal timescale. These patterns show two-way interactions in a causal framework at a weekly timescale and assess how El NiÃ±o affects these interactions.\n\nHCLIM38: a flexible regional climate model applicable for different climate zones from coarse to convection-permitting scales\n\nDanijel BeluÅ¡iÄ, Hylke de Vries, Andreas Dobler, Oskar Landgren, Petter Lind, David Lindstedt, Rasmus A.

Model Dev., 13, 1311–1333, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1311-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1311-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new regional climate modelling system, HCLIM38, is presented and shown to be applicable in different regions ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. The main focus is on climate simulations at horizontal resolutions between 1 and 4 km, the so-called convection-permitting scales, even though the model can also be used at coarser resolutions. The benefits of simulating climate at convection-permitting scales are shown and are particularly evident for climate extremes.\n\nTropical and mid-latitude teleconnections interacting with the Indian summer monsoon rainfall: a theory-guided causal effect network approach\n\nGiorgia Di Capua, Marlene Kretschmer, Reik V. Donner, Bart van den Hurk, Ramesh Vellore, Raghavan Krishnan, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 17–34, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-17-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-17-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrivers from both the mid-latitudes and the tropical regions have been proposed to influence the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) subseasonal variability. To understand the relative importance of tropical and mid-latitude drivers, we apply recently developed causal discovery techniques to disentangle the causal relationships among these processes. Our results show that there is indeed a two-way interaction between the mid-latitude circulation and ISM rainfall over central India.\n\nSummertime precipitation extremes in a EURO-CORDEX 0.11Â° ensemble at an hourly resolution\n\nPeter Berg, Ole B. Christensen, Katharina Klehmet, Geert Lenderink, Jonas Olsson, Claas Teichmann, and Wei Yang\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 957–971, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-957-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-957-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA state-of-the-art regional climate model ensemble for Europe is investigated for extreme precipitation intensities. The models poorly reproduce short duration events of less than a few hours. Further, there is poor connection to some known hotspots for extreme cases. The model performance is much improved at 12 h durations. Projected future increases scale with seasonal mean temperature change, within a range from a few percent to over 10 percent per degree Celsius.\n\nHuman influence on European winter wind storms such as those of January 2018\n\nRobert Vautard, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike E. L. Otto, Pascal Yiou, Hylke de Vries, Erik van Meijgaard, Andrew Stepek, Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, Sjoukje Philip, Sarah F. Kew, Cecilia Costella, Roop Singh, and Claudia Tebaldi\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 271–286, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-271-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-271-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of human activities on the probability of winter wind storms like the ones that occurred in Western Europe in January 2018 is analysed using multiple model ensembles. Despite a significant probability decline in observations, we find no significant change in probabilities due to human influence on climate so far. However, such extreme events are likely to be slightly more frequent in the future. The observed decrease in storminess is likely to be due to increasing roughness.\n\nTropical and mid-latitude teleconnections interacting with the Indian summer monsoon rainfall: A Theory-Guided Causal Effect Network approach\n\nGiorgia Di Capua, Marlene Kretschmer, Reik V. Donner, Bart van den Hurk, Ramesh Vellore, Raghavan Krishnan, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2019-11,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2019-11, 2019\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBoth drivers from the mid-latitudes and from the tropical regions have been proposed to influence the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) subseasonal variability. To understand the relative importance of tropical and mid-latitude drivers, we apply recently developed causal discovery techniques to disentangle the causal relationships among these processes. Our results show that there is indeed a two-way interaction between the mid-latitude circulation and ISM rainfall over central India.\n\nThe Cloud_cci simulator v1.0 for the Cloud_cci climate data record and its application to a global and a regional climate model\n\nSalomon Eliasson, Karl GÃ¶ran Karlsson, Erik van Meijgaard, Jan Fokke Meirink, Martin Stengel, and Ulrika WillÃ©n\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 829–847, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-829-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-829-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo enable fair comparisons of clouds between climate models and the ESA Cloud_cci climate data record (CDR), we present a tool called the Cloud_cci simulator. The tool takes into account the geometry and cloud detection capabilities of the Cloud_cci CDR to allow fair comparisons. We demonstrate the simulator on two climate models. We find the impact of time sampling has a large effect on simulated cloud water amount and that the simulator reduces the cloud cover by about 10 % globally.\n\nFuture extreme precipitation intensities based on a historic event\n\nIris Manola, Bart van den Hurk, Hans De Moel, and Jeroen C. J. H. Aerts\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3777–3788, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3777-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3777-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn a warmer climate, it is expected that precipitation intensities will increase and form a considerable risk of high-impact precipitation extremes. We investigate how observed extreme precipitation events would look like if they took place in a future warmer climate. This study applies three methods to transform a historic extreme precipitation event in the Netherlands to a similar event in a future warmer climate, thus compiling a future weather scenario.\n\nThe INTENSE project: using observations and models to understand the past, present and future of sub-daily rainfall extremes\n\nStephen Blenkinsop, Hayley J.

We might expect the intensity of such events to increase in a warming climate but these are poorly realised in projections of future climate change. The INTENSE project is collating a global dataset of hourly rainfall measurements and linking with new developments in climate models to understand the characteristics and causes of these events.\n\nEuropean climate change at global mean temperature increases of 1.5 and 2â¯Â°C above pre-industrial conditions as simulated by the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models\n\nErik KjellstrÃ¶m, Grigory Nikulin, Gustav Strandberg, Ole BÃ¸ssing Christensen, Daniela Jacob, Klaus Keuler, Geert Lenderink, Erik van Meijgaard, Christoph SchÃ¤r, Samuel Somot, Silje Lund SÃ¸rland, Claas Teichmann, and Robert Vautard\n\nEarth Syst.

Considerable near-surface warming exceeding that of the global mean is found for most of Europe, already at the lower 1.5 Â°C of warming level. Changes in precipitation and near-surface wind speed are identified. The 1.5 Â°C of warming level shows significantly less change compared to the 2 Â°C level, indicating the importance of mitigation.\n\nStorm surge and extreme river discharge: a compound event analysis using ensemble impact modelling\n\nSonu Khanal, Nina Ridder, Hylke de Vries, Wilco Terink, and Bart van den Hurk\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2018-103,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2018-103, 2018\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study assesses the possibility of finding near simultaneous storm surge and extreme river discharge using an extended data set derived from a storm surge model and two hydrological river-discharge models forced with conditions from a highresolution climate model in ensemble model. The study highlights that the hazard of a co-occurrence of high river discharge and coastal water levels cannot be neglected in a robust risk assessment.\n\nModelling the climate and surface mass balance of polar ice sheets using RACMO2 â PartÂ 1: Greenland (1958â2016)\n\nBrice NoÃ«l, Willem Jan van de Berg, J. Melchior van Wessem, Erik van Meijgaard, Dirk van As, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Stef Lhermitte, Peter Kuipers Munneke, C. J. P. Paul Smeets, Lambertus H. van Ulft, Roderik S.

The model successfully reproduces the present-day climate and surface mass balance, i.e. snowfall minus meltwater run-off, of the GrIS compared to in situ observations. Since run-off from marginal narrow glaciers is poorly resolved at 11 km, further statistical downscaling to 1 km resolution is required for mass balance studies.\n\nThe influence of antecedent conditions on flood risk in sub-Saharan Africa\n\nKonstantinos Bischiniotis, Bart van den Hurk, Brenden Jongman, Erin Coughlan de Perez, Ted Veldkamp, Hans de Moel, and Jeroen Aerts\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Understanding the flood triggering mechanisms will result in increasing warning lead times, providing sufficient time for early action. Findings of this study indicate that the consideration of short- and long-term antecedent conditions can be used by humanitarian organizations and decision makers for improved flood risk management.\n\nCurriculum vitae of the LOTOSâEUROS (v2.0) chemistry transport model\n\nAstrid M.

Recently, version 2.0 of the model was released as an open-source version. Next to a technical description and model evaluation for 2012, this paper presents the model developments in context of the history of air quality modelling and provides an outlook for future directions. Key and innovative applications of LOTOS–EUROS are also highlighted.\n\nShould seasonal rainfall forecasts be used for flood preparedness?\n\nErin Coughlan de Perez, Elisabeth Stephens, Konstantinos Bischiniotis, Maarten van Aalst, Bart van den Hurk, Simon Mason, Hannah Nissan, and Florian Pappenberger\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 4517–4524, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4517-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4517-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDisaster managers would like to use seasonal forecasts to anticipate flooding months in advance. However, current seasonal forecasts give information on rainfall instead of flooding. Here, we find that the number of extreme events, rather than total rainfall, is most related to flooding in different regions of Africa. We recommend several forecast adjustments and research opportunities that would improve flood information at the seasonal timescale in different regions.\n\nRelative impacts of land use and climate change on summer precipitation in the Netherlands\n\nEmma Daniels, Geert Lenderink, Ronald Hutjes, and Albert Holtslag\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4129–4142, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4129-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4129-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a weather model, we find that historic and future land use changes have a smaller effect (decrease) on summer precipitation in the Netherlands than climate change has (increase). As a result, precipitation will likely continue to increase over the coming decades. Nevertheless, in the Netherlands the influence of land surface changes on summer precipitation is not negligible and counters the effect of climate change, especially for extreme precipitation.\n\nAction-based flood forecasting for triggering humanitarian action\n\nErin Coughlan de Perez, Bart van den Hurk, Maarten K. van Aalst, Irene Amuron, Deus Bamanya, Tristan Hauser, Brenden Jongma, Ana Lopez, Simon Mason, Janot Mendler de Suarez, Florian Pappenberger, Alexandra Rueth, Elisabeth Stephens, Pablo Suarez, Jurjen Wagemaker, and Ervin Zsoter\n\nHydrol.

This article demonstrates the design of a new system of forecast-based financing, which automatically triggers action when a flood forecast arrives, before a potential disaster. We establish \"action triggers\" for northern Uganda based on a global flood forecasting system, verifying these forecasts and assessing the uncertainties inherent in setting a trigger in a data-scarce location.\n\nLS3MIP (v1.0) contribution to CMIP6: the Land Surface, Snow and Soil moisture Model Intercomparison Project â aims, setup and expected outcome\n\nBart van den Hurk, Hyungjun Kim, Gerhard Krinner, Sonia I.

After such an event the question is always posed to what extent it can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using observations and five model ensembles we give a first answer. For the 3-day precipitation extremes over the Seine and Loire basins that caused the flooding all methods agree that the probability has increased by a factor of about two. For 1-day precipitation extremes in Germany the methods disagree.\n\nThe climatic imprint of bimodal distributions in vegetation cover for western Africa\n\nZun Yin, Stefan C. Dekker, Bart J. J. M. van den Hurk, and Henk A. Dijkstra\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 3343–3357, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-3343-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-3343-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBimodality is found in aboveground biomass and mean annual shortwave radiation in West Africa, which is a strong evidence of alternative stable states. The condition with low biomass and low radiation is demonstrated under which ecosystem state can shift between savanna and forest states. Moreover, climatic indicators have different prediction confidences to different land cover types. A new method is proposed to predict potential land cover change with a combination of climatic indicators.\n\nForecast-based financing: an approach for catalyzing humanitarian action based on extreme weather and climate forecasts\n\nE.

This article offers a framework for determining when it is \"worth\" taking action to try to avoid a potential disaster. Considering forecast probabilities, actions, and funding constraints, we propose a novel forecast-based financing system that would automatically trigger action based on forecasts of increased risks.\n\nLand-surface controls on afternoon precipitation diagnosed from observational data: uncertainties and confounding factors\n\nB.

Severe-weather forecasts and warnings need to advance in order to trigger our imagination of what might happen and enable us to start preparing.\n\nModelling crop hail damage footprints with single-polarization radar: the roles of spatial resolution, hail intensity, and cropland density\n\nRaphael Portmann, Timo Schmid, Leonie Villiger, David N.

Over seas, GSPs per flash surpass inland, reaching a minimum in the Alps. Mountainous areas like the Alps and Pyrenees have the closest GSP separation, highlighting terrain elevation's impact. The daily peak current correlates with average GSPs per flash. These findings could significantly influence lightning protection measures, urging a focus on GSP density rather than flash density for risk assessment.\n\nThe role of citizen science in assessing the spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall events in urban areas: a case study in the city of Genoa, Italy\n\nNicola Loglisci, Giorgio Boni, Arianna Cauteruccio, Francesco Faccini, Massimo Milelli, Guido Paliaga, and Antonio Parodi\n\nNat.

Rainfall observations were made using rain gauge networks based on either official networks or citizen science networks. The merged analysis stresses the spatial variability in the precipitation, which cannot be captured by the current spatial density of authoritative stations. Results show that at minimal distances the variations in cumulated rainfall over a sub-hourly duration are significant.\n\nPrecipitation extremes in Ukraine from 1979 to 2019: climatology, large-scale flow conditions, and moisture sources\n\nEllina Agayar, Franziska Aemisegger, Moshe Armon, Alexander Scherrmann, and Heini Wernli\n\nNat.

During all seasons EPEs are associated with pronounced upper-level potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. In addition, we find distinct seasonal and regional differences in moisture sources. Several extreme precipitation cases demonstrate the importance of these processes, complemented by a detailed synoptic analysis.\n\nCharacterizing hail-prone environments using convection-permitting reanalysis and overshooting top detections over south-central Europe\n\nAntonio Giordani, Michael Kunz, Kristopher M.

Hail likelihood peaks in mid-summer at 15:00 UTC over northern Italy and shows improved agreement with observations compared to previous estimates. By separating ambient signatures based on hail severity, enhanced appropriateness for large-hail occurrence is found.\n\nAircraft engine dust ingestion at global airports\n\nClaire L.

This has financial implications for the aviation industry and results in increased fuel burn with climate impacts. Here we quantify dust ingestion by aircraft engines at airports worldwide. We find Dubai and Delhi in summer are among the dustiest airports, where substantial engine degradation would occur after 1000 flights. Dust ingestion can be reduced by changing take-off times and the altitude of holding patterns.\n\nCatchment-scale assessment of drought impact on environmental flow in the Indus Basin, Pakistan\n\nKhalil Ur Rahman, Songhao Shang, Khaled Saeed Balkhair, Hamza Farooq Gabriel, Khan Zaib Jadoon, and Kifayat Zaman\n\nNat.

This study investigates historical Arctic ship tracks, cyclone tracks, and shipping incident reports to determine the number of shipping incidents caused by the passage of Arctic cyclones. Results suggest that Arctic cyclones have not been hazardous to ships and that ships are resilient to the rough sea conditions caused by Arctic cyclones.\n\nEstimation of future rainfall extreme values by temperature-dependent disaggregation of climate model data\n\nNiklas Ebers, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, and Hannes MÃ¼ller-Thomy\n\nNat.

Sci., 24, 2025–2043, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2025-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2025-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture changes in sub-daily rainfall extreme values are essential in various hydrological fields, but climate scenarios typically offer only daily resolution. One solution is rainfall generation. With a temperature-dependent rainfall generator climate scenario data were disaggregated to 5 min rainfall time series for 45 locations across Germany. The analysis of the future 5 min rainfall time series showed an increase in the rainfall extremes values for rainfall durations of 5 min and 1 h.\n\nClimatic characteristics of the Jianghuai cyclone and its linkage with precipitation during the Meiyu period from 1961 to 2020\n\nRan Zhu and Lei Chen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1937–1950, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1937-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1937-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is a positive correlation between the frequency of Jianghuai cyclone activity and precipitation during the Meiyu period. Its occurrence frequency has an obvious decadal variation, which corresponds well with the quasi-periodic and decadal variation in precipitation during the Meiyu period. This study provides a reference for the long-term and short-term forecasting of precipitation during the Meiyu period.\n\nApplication of the teachingâlearning-based optimization algorithm to an analytical model of thunderstorm outflows to analyze the variability of the downburst kinematic and geometric parameters\n\nAndi Xhelaj and Massimiliano Burlando\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1657–1679, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1657-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1657-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study provides an in-depth analysis of a severe downburst event in Sânnicolau Mare, Romania, utilizing an analytical model and optimization algorithm. The goal is to explore a multitude of generating solutions and to identify potential alternatives to the optimal solution. Advanced data analysis techniques help to discern three main distinct storm scenarios. For this particular event, the best overall solution from the optimization algorithm shows promise in reconstructing the downburst.\n\nProjections and uncertainties of winter windstorm damage in Europe in a changing climate\n\nLuca G. Severino, Chahan M. Kropf, Hilla Afargan-Gerstman, Christopher Fairless, Andries Jan de Vries, Daniela I. V. Domeisen, and David N. Bresch\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1555–1578, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1555-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1555-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combine climate projections from 30 climate models with a climate risk model to project winter windstorm damages in Europe under climate change. We study the uncertainty and sensitivity factors related to the modelling of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. We emphasize high uncertainties in the damage projections, with climate models primarily driving the uncertainty. We find climate change reshapes future European windstorm risk by altering damage locations and intensity.\n\nImproving seasonal predictions of German Bight storm activity\n\nDaniel Krieger, Sebastian Brune, Johanna Baehr, and Ralf Weisse\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1539–1554, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1539-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1539-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrevious studies found that climate models can predict storm activity in the German Bight well for averages of 5–10 years but struggle in predicting the next winter season. Here, we improve winter storm activity predictions by linking them to physical phenomena that occur before the winter. We guess the winter storm activity from these phenomena and discard model solutions that stray too far from the guess. The remaining solutions then show much higher prediction skill for storm activity.\n\nA satellite view of the exceptionally warm summer of 2022 over Europe\n\nJoÃ£o P. A. Martins, Sara Caetano, Carlos Pereira, Emanuel Dutra, and Rita M. Cardoso\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1501–1520, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1501-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1501-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOver Europe, 2022 was truly exceptional in terms of extreme heat conditions, both in terms of temperature anomalies and their temporal and spatial extent. The satellite all-sky land surface temperature (LST) is used to provide a climatological context to extreme heat events. Where drought conditions prevail, LST anomalies are higher than 2 m air temperature anomalies. ERA5-Land does not represent this effect correctly due to a misrepresentation of vegetation anomalies.\n\nDemographic yearbooks as a source of weather-related fatalities: the Czech Republic, 1919â2022\n\nRudolf BrÃ¡zdil, KateÅina ChromÃ¡, and Pavel ZahradnÃ­Äek\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1437–1457, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1437-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1437-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe official mortality data in the Czech Republic in 1919–2022 are used to show long-term fluctuations in the number of fatalities caused by excessive natural cold and heat, lightning, natural disasters, and falls on ice/snow, as well as the sex and age of the deceased, based on certain meteorological, historical, and socioeconomic factors that strongly influence changes in the number and structure of such fatalities. Knowledge obtained is usable in risk management for the preservation of lives.\n\nFOREWARNS: development and multifaceted verification of enhanced regional-scale surface water flood forecasts\n\nBen Maybee, Cathryn E. Birch, Steven J. BÃ¶ing, Thomas Willis, Linda Speight, Aurore N. Porson, Charlie Pilling, Kay L. Shelton, and Mark A. Trigg\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1415–1436, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1415-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1415-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents the development and verification of FOREWARNS, a novel method for regional-scale forecasting of surface water flooding. We detail outcomes from a workshop held with UK forecast users, who indicated they valued the forecasts and would use them to complement national guidance. We use results of objective forecast tests against flood observations over northern England to show that this confidence is justified and that FOREWARNS meets the needs of UK flood responders.\n\nAssessment of windâdamage relations for Norway using 36 years of daily insurance data\n\nAshbin Jaison, Asgeir Sorteberg, Clio Michel, and Ãyvind Breivik\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1341–1355, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1341-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1341-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study uses daily insurance losses and wind speeds to fit storm damage functions at the municipality level of Norway. The results show that the damage functions accurately estimate losses associated with extreme damaging events and can reconstruct their spatial patterns. However, there is no single damage function that performs better than another. A newly devised damage–no-damage classifier shows some skill in predicting extreme damaging events.\n\nInterannual variations in the seasonal cycle of extreme precipitation in Germany and the response to climate change\n\nMadlen Peter, Henning W. Rust, and Uwe Ulbrich\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1261–1285, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1261-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper introduces a statistical modeling approach describing daily extreme precipitation in Germany more accurately by including changes within the year and between the years simultaneously. The changing seasonality over years is regionally divergent and mainly weak. However, some regions stand out with a more pronounced linear rise of summer intensities, indicating a possible climate change signal. Improved modeling of extreme precipitation is beneficial for risk assessment and adaptation.\n\nConvection-permitting climate model representation of severe convective wind gusts and future changes in southeastern Australia\n\nAndrew Brown, Andrew Dowdy, and Todd P. Lane\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-322,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-322, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA computer model that simulates the climate of south-eastern Australia is shown here to represent extreme wind events associated with convective storms. This is useful as it allows us to investigate possible future changes in the occurrences of these events, and we find in the year 2050 that our model simulates a decrease in the number of occurrences. However, the model also simulates too many events in the historical climate compared with observations, so these future changes are uncertain.\n\nClimatology of large hail in Europe: characteristics of the European Severe Weather Database\n\nFaye Hulton and David M. Schultz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1079–1098, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1079-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1079-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge hail devastates crops and property and can injure and kill people and livestock. Hail reports are collected by individual countries, so understanding where and when large hail occurs across Europe is an incomplete undertaking. We use the European Severe Weather Database to evaluate the quality of reports by year and by country since 2000. Despite its short record, the dataset appears to represent aspects of European large-hail climatology reliably.\n\nAmplified potential for vegetation stress under climate-change-induced intensifying compound extreme events in the Greater Mediterranean Region\n\nPatrick Olschewski, Mame Diarra Bousso Dieng, Hassane Moutahir, Brian BÃ¶ker, Edwin Haas, Harald Kunstmann, and Patrick Laux\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1099–1134, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1099-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1099-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe applied a multivariate and dependency-preserving bias correction method to climate model output for the Greater Mediterranean Region and investigated potential changes in false-spring events (FSEs) and heat–drought compound events (HDCEs). Results project an increase in the frequency of FSEs in middle and late spring as well as increases in frequency, intensity, and duration for HDCEs. This will potentially aggravate the risk of crop loss and failure and negatively impact food security.\n\nGTDI: a gaming integrated drought index implying hazard causing and bearing impacts changing\n\nXiaowei Zhao, Tianzeng Yang, Hongbo Zhang, Tian Lan, Chaowei Xue, Tongfang Li, Zhaoxia Ye, Zhifang Yang, and Yurou Zhang\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-45,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-45, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo effectively track and identify droughts, we developed a novel integrated drought index that combines the effects of precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture on drought. After comparison and verification, the integrated drought index shows superior performance to a single meteorological drought index or agricultural drought index in drought identification.\n\nAssimilation of surface pressure observations from personal weather stations in AROME-France\n\nAlan Demortier, Marc Mandement, Vivien Pourret, and Olivier Caumont\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 907–927, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-907-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-907-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nImprovements in numerical weather prediction models make it possible to warn of hazardous weather situations. The incorporation of new observations from personal weather stations into the French limited-area model is evaluated. It leads to a significant improvement in the modelling of the surface pressure field up to 9 h ahead. Their incorporation improves the location and intensity of the heavy precipitation event that occurred in the South of France in September 2021.\n\nAn open-source radar-based hail damage model for buildings and cars\n\nTimo Schmid, Raphael Portmann, Leonie Villiger, Katharina SchrÃ¶er, and David N. Bresch\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 847–872, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-847-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-847-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHailstorms cause severe damage to buildings and cars, which motivates a detailed risk assessment. Here, we present a new open-source hail damage model based on radar data in Switzerland. The model successfully estimates the correct order of magnitude of car and building damages for most large hail events over 20 years. However, large uncertainty remains in the geographical distribution of modelled damages, which can be improved for individual events by using crowdsourced hail reports.\n\nLinkages between atmospheric rivers and humid heat across the United States\n\nColin Raymond, Anamika Shreevastava, Emily Slinskey, and Duane Waliser\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 791–801, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-791-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-791-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow can we systematically understand what causes high levels of atmospheric humidity and thus heat stress? Here we argue that atmospheric rivers can be a useful tool, based on our finding that in several US regions, atmospheric rivers and humid heat occur close together in space and time. Most typically, an atmospheric river transports moisture which heightens heat stress, with precipitation following a day later. These effects tend to be larger for stronger and more extensive systems.\n\nEvaluating pySTEPS optical flow algorithms for convection nowcasting over the Maritime Continent using satellite data\n\nJoseph Smith, Cathryn Birch, John Marsham, Simon Peatman, Massimo Bollasina, and George Pankiewicz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 567–582, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-567-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-567-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNowcasting uses observations to make predictions of the atmosphere on short timescales and is particularly applicable to the Maritime Continent, where storms rapidly develop and cause natural disasters. This paper evaluates probabilistic and deterministic satellite nowcasting algorithms over the Maritime Continent. We show that the probabilistic approach is most skilful at small scales (~ 60 km), whereas the deterministic approach is most skilful at larger scales (~ 200 km).\n\nClimate change impacts on regional fire weather in heterogeneous landscapes of central Europe\n\nJulia Miller, Andrea BÃ¶hnisch, Ralf Ludwig, and Manuela I. Brunner\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 411–428, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-411-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-411-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess the impacts of climate change on fire danger for 1980–2099 in different landscapes of central Europe, using the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) as a fire danger indicator. We find that today's 100-year FWI event will occur every 30 years by 2050 and every 10 years by 2099. High fire danger (FWI > 21.3) becomes the mean condition by 2099 under an RCP8.5 scenario. This study highlights the potential for severe fire events in central Europe from a meteorological perspective.\n\nHigh-resolution projections of ambient heat for major European cities using different heat metrics\n\nClemens Schwingshackl, Anne Sophie Daloz, Carley Iles, Kristin Aunan, and Jana Sillmann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 331–354, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-331-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-331-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient heat in European cities will substantially increase under global warming, as projected by three heat metrics calculated from high-resolution climate model simulations. While the heat metrics consistently project high levels of ambient heat for several cities, in other cities the projected heat levels vary considerably across the three heat metrics. Using complementary heat metrics for projections of ambient heat is thus important for assessments of future risks from heat stress.\n\nHeat wave characteristics: evaluation of regional climate model performances for Germany\n\nDragan Petrovic, Benjamin Fersch, and Harald Kunstmann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 265–289, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-265-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-265-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe influence of model resolution and settings on the reproduction of heat waves in Germany between 1980–2009 is analyzed. Outputs from a high-resolution model with settings tailored to the target region are compared to those from coarser-resolution models with more general settings. Neither the increased resolution nor the tailored model settings are found to add significant value to the heat wave simulation. The models exhibit a large spread, indicating that the choice of model can be crucial.\n\nRain-on-snow responses to warmer Pyrenees: a sensitivity analysis using a physically based snow hydrological model\n\nJosep Bonsoms, Juan I. LÃ³pez-Moreno, Esteban Alonso-GonzÃ¡lez, CÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, and Marc Oliva\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 245–264, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-245-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-245-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate warming is changing mountain snowpack patterns, leading in some cases to rain-on-snow (ROS) events. Here we analyzed near-present ROS and its sensitivity to climate warming across the Pyrenees. ROS increases during the coldest months of the year but decreases in the warmest months and areas under severe warming due to snow cover depletion. Faster snow ablation is anticipated in the coldest and northern slopes of the range. Relevant implications in mountain ecosystem are anticipated.\n\nProbabilistic short-range forecasts of high precipitation events: optimal decision thresholds and predictability limits\n\nFranÃ§ois Bouttier and Hugo Marchal\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3111,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3111, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWeather prediction uncertainties can be described as sets of possible scenarios – a technique called 'ensemble prediction'. Our machine learning technique translates them into more easily interpretable scenarios for various users, balancing the detection of high precipitation with false alarms. Key parameters are precipitation intensity, space and time scales of interest. We show that the approach can be used to facilitate warnings of extreme precipitations.\n\nIntense rains in Israel associated with the 'Train effect'\n\nBaruch Ziv, Uri Dayan, Lidiya Shendrik, and Elyakom Vadislavsky\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-215,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-215, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\n'Train effect' is related to convective cells that pass over the same place. Trains produce heavy rainfall, sometimes floods, and reported in N. America during spring and summer. In Israel, 17 trains were identified by radar images, associated with Cyprus Lows, sharing the following features: Found at the cold sector south of the low center, at the left flank of a maximum wind belt; they cross the Israeli coast, with a mean length of 45 km, last 1–3 hours and yield 35 mm rainfall, up to 60 mm.\n\nOn the potential of using smartphone sensors for wildfire hazard estimation\n\nHofit Shachaf, Colin Price, Dorita Rostkier-Edelstein, and Cliff Mass\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-211,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-211, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have used the temperature and relative humidity sensors in smartphones to estimate the Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and important atmospheric parameter closely linked to fuel moisture and wildfire risk. Our analysis for two severe wildfire case studies in Israel and Portugal show the potential for using smartphone data to both compliment the regular weather station network, while also providing high spatial resolution of the VPD index.\n\nReturn levels of extreme European windstorms, their dependency on the North Atlantic Oscillation, and potential future risks\n\nMatthew D. K. Priestley, David B. Stephenson, Adam A. Scaife, Daniel Bannister, Christopher J. T. Allen, and David Wilkie\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3845–3861, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3845-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3845-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research presents a model for estimating extreme gusts associated with European windstorms. Using observed storm footprints we are able to calculate the return level of events at the 200-year return period. The largest gusts are found across NW Europe, and these are larger when the North Atlantic Oscillation is positive. Using theoretical future climate states we find that return levels are likely to increase across NW Europe to levels that are unprecedented compared to historical storms.\n\nWind as a natural hazard in Poland\n\nTadeusz Chmielewski and Piotr A. BoÅkowski\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3839–3844, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3839-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3839-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper deals with wind speeds of extreme wind events in Poland and the descriptions of their effects. Two recent estimations developed by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management in Warsaw and by Halina Lorenc are presented and briefly described. The 37 annual maximum gusts of wind speeds measured between 1971 and 2007 are analysed. Based on the measured and estimated wind speeds, the authors suggest new estimations for extreme winds that may occur in Poland.\n\nExploring extreme event attribution by using long-running meteorological observations\n\nErik Holmgren and Erik KjellstrÃ¶m\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2879,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2879, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssociating extreme weather events to changes in the climate remains difficult. We have explored how these relationships can be investigated using a more common method, and relying solely on long-running observational records of temperature and precipitation.\n\nOur results show that while both methods lead to similar conclusions for two recent weather events in Sweden, the commonly used method risks underestimating the strength of the connection between the event and changes to the climate.\n\nClimatological occurrences of hail and tornadoes associated with mesoscale convective systems in the United States\n\nJingyu Wang, Jiwen Fan, and Zhe Feng\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3823–3838, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3823-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3823-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHail and tornadoes are devastating hazards responsible for significant property damage and economic losses in the United States. Quantifying the connection between hazard events and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is of great significance for improving predictability, as well as for better understanding the influence of the climate-scale perturbations. A 14-year statistical dataset of MCS-related hazard production is presented.\n\nCharacteristics of cloud-to-ground lightning (CG) and differences between +CG and âCG strokes in China regarding the China National Lightning Detection Network\n\nRuijiao Jiang, Guoping Zhang, Shudong Wang, Bing Xue, Zhengshuai Xie, Tingzhao Yu, Kuoyin Wang, Jin Ding, and Xiaoxiang Zhu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3747–3759, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3747-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3747-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning activity in China is analyzed. Low latitudes, undulating terrain, seaside, and humid surfaces are beneficial for lightning occurrence. Summer of the year or afternoon of the day is the high period. Large cloud-to-ground lightning frequency always corresponds to a small ratio and weak intensity of positive cloud-to-ground lightning on either a temporal or spatial scale. Interestingly, the discharge intensity difference between the two types of lightning shrinks on the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nThe climatology and nature of warm-season convective cells in cold-frontal environments over Germany\n\nGeorge Pacey, Stephan Pfahl, Lisa Schielicke, and Kathrin Wapler\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3703–3721, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3703-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3703-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCold fronts are often associated with areas of intense precipitation (cells) and sometimes with hazards such as flooding, hail and lightning. We find that cold-frontal cell days are associated with higher cell frequency and cells are typically more intense. We also show both spatially and temporally where cells are most frequent depending on their cell-front distance. These results are an important step towards a deeper understanding of cold-frontal storm climatology and improved forecasting.\n\nForecasting large hail and lightning using additive logistic regression models and the ECMWF reforecasts\n\nFrancesco Battaglioli, Pieter Groenemeijer, Ivan Tsonevsky, and TomÃ Å¡ PÃºÄik\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3651–3669, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3651-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3651-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProbabilistic models for lightning and large hail were developed across Europe using lightning observations and hail reports. These models accurately predict the occurrence of lightning and large hail several days in advance. In addition, the hail model was shown to perform significantly better than the state-of-the-art forecasting methods. These results suggest that the models developed in this study may help improve forecasting of convective hazards and eventually limit the associated risks.\n\nThe impact of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) zenith total delay data assimilation on the short-term precipitable water vapor and precipitation forecast over Italy using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model\n\nRosa Claudia Torcasio, Alessandra Mascitelli, Eugenio Realini, Stefano Barindelli, Giulio Tagliaferro, Silvia Puca, Stefano Dietrich, and Stefano Federico\n\nNat.

The improvement lasts for at least 6 h of forecast.\n\nGlobal estimates of 100-year return values of daily precipitation from ensemble weather prediction data\n\nFlorian Ruff and Stephan Pfahl\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2057,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2057, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh-impact river floods are often caused by very extreme precipitation. Flood protection rely on reliable estimates of the return values. Observational time series are too short for a precise calculation. Here, 100-year return values of daily precipitation are estimated on a global grid based on a large set of model-generated precipitation events from ensemble weather prediction. The statistical uncertainties of the return values can be substantially reduced compared to observational estimates.\n\nShallow and deep learning of extreme rainfall events from convective atmospheres\n\nGerd BÃ¼rger and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3065–3077, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3065-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3065-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur subject is a new catalogue of radar-based heavy rainfall events (CatRaRE) over Germany and how it relates to the concurrent atmospheric circulation. We classify reanalyzed daily atmospheric fields of convective indices according to CatRaRE, using conventional statistical and more recent machine learning algorithms, and apply them to present and future atmospheres. Increasing trends are projected for CatRaRE-type probabilities, from reanalyzed as well as from simulated atmospheric fields.\n\nLinking reported drought impacts with drought indices, water scarcity and aridity: the case of Kenya\n\nMarleen R. Lam, Alessia MatanÃ³, Anne F. Van Loon, Rhoda A. Odongo, Aklilu D. Teklesadik, Charles N. Wamucii, Marc J. C. van den Homberg, Shamton Waruru, and Adriaan J. Teuling\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2915–2936, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2915-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2915-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is still no full understanding of the relation between drought impacts and drought indices in the Horn of Africa where water scarcity and arid regions are also present. This study assesses their relation in Kenya. A random forest model reveals that each region, aggregated by aridity, has its own set of predictors for every impact category. Water scarcity was not found to be related to aridity. Understanding these relations contributes to the development of drought early warning systems.\n\nFuture heat extremes and impacts in a convection-permitting climate ensemble over Germany\n\nMarie Hundhausen, Hendrik Feldmann, Natalie Laube, and Joaquim G. Pinto\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2873–2893, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2873-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2873-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a convection-permitting regional climate ensemble, the magnitude of heat waves (HWs) over Germany is projected to increase by 26 % (100 %) in a 2 °C (3 °C) warmer world. The increase is strongest in late summer, relatively homogeneous in space, and accompanied by increasing variance in HW length. Tailored parameters to climate adaptation to heat revealed dependency on major landscapes, and a nonlinear, exponential increase for parameters characterizing strong heat stress is expected.\n\nAssessment of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ensemble extreme precipitation forecast skill over Europe\n\nPauline Rivoire, Olivia Martius, Philippe Naveau, and Alexandre Tuel\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2857–2871, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2857-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2857-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHeavy precipitation can lead to floods and landslides, resulting in widespread damage and significant casualties. Some of its impacts can be mitigated if reliable forecasts and warnings are available. In this article, we assess the capacity of the precipitation forecast provided by ECMWF to predict heavy precipitation events on a subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescale over Europe. We find that the forecast skill of such events is generally higher in winter than in summer.\n\nA long record of European windstorm losses and its comparison to standard climate indices\n\nStephen Cusack\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2841–2856, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2841-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2841-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe link from European windstorm research findings to insurance applications is strengthened by a new storm loss history spanning 1950 to 2022. It is based on ERA5 winds, together with long-term trends from observed gusts for improved validation. Correlations between losses and climate indices are around 0.4 for interannual variations, rising to 0.7 for decadal variations. A significant divergence between standard climate indices and storm losses over the past 20 years needs further research.\n\nAssimilation of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) Lightning Imager (LI) pseudo-observations in AROME-France â proof of concept\n\nFelix Erdmann, Olivier Caumont, and Eric Defer\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2821–2840, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2821-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2821-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work develops a novel lightning data assimilation (LDA) technique to make use of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) Lightning Imager (LI) data in a regional, convection-permitting numerical weather prediction model. The approach combines statistical Bayesian and 3-dimensional variational methods. Our LDA can promote missing convection and suppress spurious convection in the initial state of the model, and it has similar skill to the operational radar data assimilation for rainfall forecasts.\n\nA phytoplankton bloom caused by the super cyclonic storm Amphan in the central Bay of Bengal\n\nHaojie Huang, Linfei Bai, Hao Shen, Xiaoqi Ding, Rui Wang, and Haibin LÃ¼\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2807–2819, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2807-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2807-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe super cyclonic storm Amphan occurred in the central Bay of Bengal in May 2020, and a phytoplankton bloom occurred. Its dynamic mechanism was first researched. An inertial oscillation with a 2 d period appeared and lasted for approximately 2 weeks. With the weakened thermocline and thinner barrier layer thickness, nitrate and Chl a were uplifted to the upper ocean by upwelling. With the high photosynthetically available radiation, a phytoplankton bloom occurred.\n\nCited articles"
