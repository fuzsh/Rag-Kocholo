Within these themes, they discuss issues arising from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, and highlight the co-benefits of nature-based solutions and ecosystem services. They discuss recent findings in the context of global trade and international policy frameworks, and highlight lessons for local implementation of nature-based solutions.\n\nDisentangling future effects of climate change and forest disturbance on vegetation composition and land-surface properties of the boreal forest\n\nLucia S. Layritz, Konstantin Gregor, Andreas Krause, Stefan Kruse, Ben F. Meyer, Tom A. M. Pugh, and Anja Rammig\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1028,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1028, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDisturbances (e.g. fire) can change which species grow in a forest, affecting water, carbon, energy flows, and the climate. They are expected to increase with climate change, but it is uncertain by how much. We studied how future climate and disturbances might impact vegetation with a simulation model. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both factors, with future disturbance patterns posing significant uncertainty. More research is needed to understand their future development.\n\nModelled forest ecosystem carbonânitrogen dynamics with integrated mycorrhizal processes under elevated CO2\n\nMelanie A. Thurner, Silvia Caldararu, Jan Engel, Anja Rammig, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1391–1410, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1391-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1391-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to their crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems, we implemented mycorrhizal fungi into the QUINCY terrestrial biosphere model. Fungi interact with mineral and organic soil to support plant N uptake and, thus, plant growth. Our results suggest that the effect of mycorrhizal interactions on simulated ecosystem dynamics is minor under constant environmental conditions but necessary to reproduce and understand observed patterns under changing conditions, such as rising atmospheric CO2.\n\nFrost matters: incorporating late-spring frost into a dynamic vegetation model regulates regional productivity dynamics in European beech forests\n\nBenjamin F. Meyer, Allan Buras, Konstantin Gregor, Lucia S. Layritz, Adriana Principe, JÃ¼rgen Kreyling, Anja Rammig, and Christian S. Zang\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1355–1370, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1355-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1355-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLate-spring frost (LSF), critically low temperatures when trees have already flushed their leaves, results in freezing damage leaving trees with reduced ability to perform photosynthesis. Forests with a high proportion of susceptible species like European beech are particularly vulnerable. However, this process is rarely included in dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). We show that the effect on simulated productivity and biomass is substantial, warranting more widespread inclusion of LSF in DVMs.\n\nReference maps of soil phosphorus for the pan-Amazon region\n\nJoÃ£o Paulo Darela-Filho, Anja Rammig, Katrin Fleischer, Tatiana Reichert, Laynara Figueiredo Lugli, Carlos Alberto Quesada, Luis Carlos Colocho Hurtarte, Mateus Dantas de Paula, and David M. Lapola\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 715–729, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-715-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-715-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhosphorus (P) is crucial for plant growth, and scientists have created models to study how it interacts with carbon cycle in ecosystems. To apply these models, it is important to know the distribution of phosphorus in soil. In this study we estimated the distribution of phosphorus in the Amazon region. The results showed a clear gradient of soil development and P content. These maps can help improve ecosystem models and generate new hypotheses about phosphorus availability in the Amazon.\n\nExploring the impacts of unprecedented climate extremes on forest ecosystems: hypotheses to guide modeling and experimental studies\n\nJennifer A. Holm, David M. Medvigy, Benjamin Smith, Jeffrey S. Dukes, Claus Beier, Mikhail Mishurov, Xiangtao Xu, Jeremy W. Lichstein, Craig D. Allen, Klaus S. Larsen, Yiqi Luo, Cari Ficken, William T. Pockman, William R. L. Anderegg, and Anja Rammig\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2117–2142, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2117-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2117-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnprecedented climate extremes (UCEs) are expected to have dramatic impacts on ecosystems. We present a road map of how dynamic vegetation models can explore extreme drought and climate change and assess ecological processes to measure and reduce model uncertainties. The models predict strong nonlinear responses to UCEs. Due to different model representations, the models differ in magnitude and trajectory of forest loss. Therefore, we explore specific plant responses that reflect knowledge gaps.\n\nClimate and parameter sensitivity and induced uncertainties in carbon stock projections for European forests (using LPJ-GUESS 4.0)\n\nJohannes Oberpriller, Christine Herschlein, Peter Anthoni, Almut Arneth, Andreas Krause, Anja Rammig, Mats Lindeskog, Stefan Olin, and Florian Hartig\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 6495–6519, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6495-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6495-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding uncertainties of projected ecosystem dynamics under environmental change is of immense value for research and climate change policy. Here, we analyzed these across European forests. We find that uncertainties are dominantly induced by parameters related to water, mortality, and climate, with an increasing importance of climate from north to south. These results highlight that climate not only contributes uncertainty but also modifies uncertainties in other ecosystem processes.\n\nRecent extreme drought events in the Amazon rainforest: assessment of different precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets and drought indicators\n\nPhillip Papastefanou, Christian S. Zang, Zlatan Angelov, Aline Anderson de Castro, Juan Carlos Jimenez, Luiz Felipe Campos De Rezende, Romina C. Ruscica, Boris Sakschewski, Anna A. SÃ¶rensson, Kirsten Thonicke, Carolina Vera, Nicolas Viovy, Celso Von Randow, and Anja Rammig\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3843–3861, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3843-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3843-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Amazon rainforest has been hit by multiple severe drought events. In this study, we assess the severity and spatial extent of the extreme drought years 2005, 2010 and 2015/16 in the Amazon. Using nine different precipitation datasets and three drought indicators we find large differences in drought stress across the Amazon region. We conclude that future studies should use multiple rainfall datasets and drought indicators when estimating the impact of drought stress in the Amazon region.\n\nAccounting for forest management in the estimation of forest carbon balance using the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (v4.0, r9710): implementation and evaluation of simulations for Europe\n\nMats Lindeskog, Benjamin Smith, Fredrik Lagergren, Ekaterina Sycheva, Andrej Ficko, Hans Pretzsch, and Anja Rammig\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 6071–6112, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6071-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6071-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForests play an important role in the global carbon cycle and for carbon storage. In Europe, forests are intensively managed. To understand how management influences carbon storage in European forests, we implement detailed forest management into the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. We test the model by comparing model output to typical forestry measures, such as growing stock and harvest data, for different countries in Europe.\n\nCO2 physiological effect can cause rainfall decrease as strong as large-scale deforestation in the Amazon\n\nGilvan Sampaio, MarÃ­lia H. Shimizu, Carlos A. GuimarÃ£es-JÃºnior, Felipe Alexandre, Marcelo Guatura, Manoel Cardoso, Tomas F. Domingues, Anja Rammig, Celso von Randow, Luiz F. C. Rezende, and David M. Lapola\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2511–2525, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2511-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2511-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of large-scale deforestation and the physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on Amazon rainfall are systematically compared in this study. Our results are remarkable in showing that the two disturbances cause equivalent rainfall decrease, though through different causal mechanisms. These results highlight the importance of not only curbing regional deforestation but also reducing global CO2 emissions to avoid climatic changes in the Amazon.\n\nUnderstanding the uncertainty in global forest carbon turnover\n\nThomas A. M. Pugh, Tim Rademacher, Sarah L. Shafer, JÃ¶rg Steinkamp, Jonathan Barichivich, Brian Beckage, Vanessa Haverd, Anna Harper, Jens Heinke, Kazuya Nishina, Anja Rammig, Hisashi Sato, Almut Arneth, Stijn Hantson, Thomas Hickler, Markus Kautz, Benjamin Quesada, Benjamin Smith, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3961–3989, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3961-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3961-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe length of time that carbon remains in forest biomass is one of the largest uncertainties in the global carbon cycle. Estimates from six contemporary models found this time to range from 12.2 to 23.5 years for the global mean for 1985–2014. Future projections do not give consistent results, but 13 model-based hypotheses are identified, along with recommendations for pragmatic steps to test them using existing and novel observations, which would help to reduce large current uncertainty.\n\nQuantifying impacts of the 2018 drought on European ecosystems in comparison to 2003\n\nAllan Buras, Anja Rammig, and Christian S. Zang\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1655–1672, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1655-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1655-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study compares the climatic conditions and ecosystem response of the extreme European drought of 2018 with the previous extreme drought of 2003. Using gridded climate data and satellite-based remote sensing information, our analyses qualify 2018 as the new European record drought with wide-ranging negative impacts on European ecosystems. Given the observation of forest-legacy effects in 2019 we call for Europe-wide forest monitoring to assess forest vulnerability to climate change.\n\nTowards a global understanding of vegetationâclimate dynamics at multiple timescales\n\nNora Linscheid, Lina M. Estupinan-Suarez, Alexander Brenning, Nuno Carvalhais, Felix Cremer, Fabian Gans, Anja Rammig, Markus Reichstein, Carlos A. Sierra, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 945–962, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation typically responds to variation in temperature and rainfall within days. Yet seasonal changes in meteorological conditions, as well as decadal climate variability, additionally shape the state of ecosystems. It remains unclear how vegetation responds to climate variability on these different timescales. We find that the vegetation response to climate variability depends on the timescale considered. This scale dependency should be considered for modeling land–atmosphere interactions.\n\nA generic pixel-to-point comparison for simulated large-scale ecosystem properties and ground-based observations: an example from the Amazon region\n\nAnja Rammig, Jens Heinke, Florian Hofhansl, Hans Verbeeck, Timothy R.

We provide statistical measures accounting for the uncertainty in ecosystem variables. We demonstrate our approach by comparing simulated values of aboveground biomass, woody productivity and residence time of woody biomass from four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with measured inventory data from permanent plots in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nLPJmL4 â a dynamic global vegetation model with managed land â PartÂ 1: Model description\n\nSibyll Schaphoff, Werner von Bloh, Anja Rammig, Kirsten Thonicke, Hester Biemans, Matthias Forkel, Dieter Gerten, Jens Heinke, Jonas JÃ¤germeyr, JÃ¼rgen Knauer, Fanny Langerwisch, Wolfgang Lucht, Christoph MÃ¼ller, Susanne Rolinski, and Katharina Waha\n\nGeosci.

The model allows for the consistent and joint quantification of climate and land use change impacts on the biosphere. The model represents the key ecosystem functions, but also the influence of humans on the biosphere. It comes with an evaluation paper to demonstrate the credibility of LPJmL4.\n\nLPJmL4 â a dynamic global vegetation model with managed land â PartÂ 2: Model evaluation\n\nSibyll Schaphoff, Matthias Forkel, Christoph MÃ¼ller, JÃ¼rgen Knauer, Werner von Bloh, Dieter Gerten, Jonas JÃ¤germeyr, Wolfgang Lucht, Anja Rammig, Kirsten Thonicke, and Katharina Waha\n\nGeosci.

The article is the second part to a comprehensive description of the LPJmL4 model. We have evaluated the model against various datasets of satellite observations, agricultural statistics, and in situ measurements by applying a range of metrics. We are able to show that the LPJmL4 model simulates many parameters and relations reasonably.\n\nImpacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones\n\nJannis von Buttlar, Jakob Zscheischler, Anja Rammig, Sebastian Sippel, Markus Reichstein, Alexander Knohl, Martin Jung, Olaf Menzer, M.

We show that heat extremes typically increased mainly respiration whereas drought decreased both fluxes. Combined heat and drought extremes had opposing effects offsetting each other for respiration, but there were also strong reductions in GPP and hence the strongest reductions in the ecosystems carbon sink capacity.\n\nDetecting impacts of extreme events with ecological inÂ situ monitoring networks\n\nMiguel D.

Dynam., 7, 953–968, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-953-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-953-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmazonia is heavily impacted by climate change and deforestation. During annual flooding terrigenous material is imported to the river, converted and finally exported to the ocean or the atmosphere. Changes in the vegetation alter therefore riverine carbon dynamics. Our results show that due to deforestation organic carbon amount will strongly decrease both in the river and exported to the ocean, while inorganic carbon amounts will increase, in the river as well as exported to the atmosphere.\n\nClimate change increases riverine carbon outgassing, while export to the ocean remains uncertain\n\nF. Langerwisch, A. Walz, A. Rammig, B. Tietjen, K. Thonicke, and W. Cramer\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 559–582, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-559-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-559-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Amazonia, carbon fluxes are considerably influenced by annual flooding. We applied the newly developed model RivCM to several climate change scenarios to estimate potential changes in riverine carbon. We find that climate change causes substantial changes in riverine organic and inorganic carbon, as well as changes in carbon exported to the atmosphere and ocean. Such changes could have local and regional impacts on the carbon budget of the whole Amazon basin and parts of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA probabilistic risk assessment for the vulnerability of the European carbon cycle to weather extremes: the ecosystem perspective\n\nS. Rolinski, A. Rammig, A. Walz, W. von Bloh, M. van Oijen, and K. Thonicke\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 1813–1831, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1813-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1813-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme weather events can but do not have to cause extreme ecosystem response. Here, we focus on hazardous ecosystem behaviour and identify coinciding weather conditions. We use a simple probabilistic risk assessment and apply it to terrestrial ecosystems, defining a hazard as negative net biome productivity. In Europe, ecosystems are vulnerable to drought in the Mediterranean and temperate region, whereas vulnerability in Scandinavia is not caused by water shortages.\n\nOn the importance of cascading moisture recycling in South America\n\nD.

The conclusions are (1) drought will pose increasing risks to productivity in the Mediterranean area; (2) this is because severe droughts will become more frequent, not because ecosystems will become more vulnerable; (3) future C sequestration will be at risk because carbon gain in primary productivity will be more affected than carbon loss in respiration.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Current perspectives on biosphere research – 2024\n\nFriedrich J.

To help predict how wildfires will change in future, global fire models are being developed. We analyze and further develop one such model, SPITFIRE. Our work identifies and corrects sources of substantial bias in the model that are important to the global fire modelling field. With this analysis and these developments, we help to provide a crucial platform for future developments.\n\nUnderstanding and simulating cropland and non-cropland burning in Europe using the BASE (Burnt Area Simulator for Europe) model\n\nMatthew Forrest, Jessica Hetzer, Maik Billing, Simon P.

We used statistical models with satellite data, climate data and socioeconomic data to determine what affects burning in cropland and non-cropland area Europe. We found different drivers of burning in cropland burning vs non-cropland, to the point that some variable, e.g. population density, had completely the opposite effects.\n\nSpectralIndices.jl: Streamlining spectral indices access and computation for Earth system research\n\nFrancesco Martinuzzi, Miguel D.

We derived a dataset covering the impacts of droughts in Germany between 2000 and 2022 on sectors such as agriculture and forestry based on newspaper articles. Notably, our study illustrated that the longer drought had a wider reach and more varied effects. We show that dealing with longer droughts requires different plans compared to shorter ones, and it is crucial to be ready for the challenges they bring.\n\nDisentangling future effects of climate change and forest disturbance on vegetation composition and land-surface properties of the boreal forest\n\nLucia S.

They are expected to increase with climate change, but it is uncertain by how much. We studied how future climate and disturbances might impact vegetation with a simulation model. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both factors, with future disturbance patterns posing significant uncertainty. More research is needed to understand their future development.\n\nThe long-term impact of transgressing planetary boundaries on biophysical atmosphereâland interactions\n\nMarkus DrÃ¼ke, Wolfgang Lucht, Werner von Bloh, Stefan Petri, Boris Sakschewski, Arne Tobian, Sina Loriani, Sibyll Schaphoff, Georg Feulner, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nEarth Syst.

We use the comprehensive Earth system model POEM to study the impact of the interacting boundaries for climate change and land system change. Our study shows the importance of long-term effects on carbon dynamics and climate, as well as the need to investigate both boundaries simultaneously and to generally keep both boundaries within acceptable ranges to avoid a catastrophic scenario for humanity.\n\nModelled forest ecosystem carbonânitrogen dynamics with integrated mycorrhizal processes under elevated CO2\n\nMelanie A. Thurner, Silvia Caldararu, Jan Engel, Anja Rammig, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1391–1410, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1391-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1391-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to their crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems, we implemented mycorrhizal fungi into the QUINCY terrestrial biosphere model. Fungi interact with mineral and organic soil to support plant N uptake and, thus, plant growth. Our results suggest that the effect of mycorrhizal interactions on simulated ecosystem dynamics is minor under constant environmental conditions but necessary to reproduce and understand observed patterns under changing conditions, such as rising atmospheric CO2.\n\nFrost matters: incorporating late-spring frost into a dynamic vegetation model regulates regional productivity dynamics in European beech forests\n\nBenjamin F. Meyer, Allan Buras, Konstantin Gregor, Lucia S. Layritz, Adriana Principe, JÃ¼rgen Kreyling, Anja Rammig, and Christian S. Zang\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1355–1370, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1355-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1355-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLate-spring frost (LSF), critically low temperatures when trees have already flushed their leaves, results in freezing damage leaving trees with reduced ability to perform photosynthesis. Forests with a high proportion of susceptible species like European beech are particularly vulnerable. However, this process is rarely included in dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). We show that the effect on simulated productivity and biomass is substantial, warranting more widespread inclusion of LSF in DVMs.\n\nBiological nitrogen fixation of natural and agricultural vegetation simulated with LPJmL 5.7.9\n\nStephen BjÃ¶rn Wirth, Johanna Braun, Jens Heinke, Sebastian Ostberg, Susanne Rolinski, Sibyll Schaphoff, Fabian Stenzel, Werner von Bloh, and Christoph MÃ¼ller\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2946,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2946, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new approach to model biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in the Lund Potsdam Jena managed Land dynamic global vegetation model. While in the original approach BNF depended on actual evapotranspiration, the new approach considers soil water content and temperature, the nitrogen (N) deficit and carbon (C) costs. The new approach improved global sums and spatial patterns of BNF compared to the scientific literature and the models’ ability to project future C and N cycle dynamics.\n\nReference maps of soil phosphorus for the pan-Amazon region\n\nJoÃ£o Paulo Darela-Filho, Anja Rammig, Katrin Fleischer, Tatiana Reichert, Laynara Figueiredo Lugli, Carlos Alberto Quesada, Luis Carlos Colocho Hurtarte, Mateus Dantas de Paula, and David M.

To apply these models, it is important to know the distribution of phosphorus in soil. In this study we estimated the distribution of phosphorus in the Amazon region. The results showed a clear gradient of soil development and P content. These maps can help improve ecosystem models and generate new hypotheses about phosphorus availability in the Amazon.\n\nClimate tipping point interactions and cascades: a review\n\nNico Wunderling, Anna S. von der Heydt, Yevgeny Aksenov, Stephen Barker, Robbin Bastiaansen, Victor Brovkin, Maura Brunetti, Victor Couplet, Thomas Kleinen, Caroline H.

We find indications that many of the interactions between tipping elements are destabilizing. This means that tipping cascades cannot be ruled out on centennial to millennial timescales at global warming levels between 1.5 and 2.0 °C or on shorter timescales if global warming surpasses 2.0 °C.\n\nConnecting competitor, stress-tolerator and ruderal (CSR) theory and Lund Potsdam Jena managed LandÂ 5 (LPJmLÂ 5) to assess the role of environmental conditions, management and functional diversity for grassland ecosystem functions\n\nStephen BjÃ¶rn Wirth, Arne Poyda, Friedhelm Taube, Britta Tietjen, Christoph MÃ¼ller, Kirsten Thonicke, Anja LinstÃ¤dter, Kai Behn, Sibyll Schaphoff, Werner von Bloh, and Susanne Rolinski\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 381–410, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-381-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-381-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), the role of functional diversity in forage supply and soil organic carbon storage of grasslands is not explicitly taken into account. We introduced functional diversity into the Lund Potsdam Jena managed Land (LPJmL) DGVM using CSR theory. The new model reproduced well-known trade-offs between plant traits and can be used to quantify the role of functional diversity in climate change mitigation using different functional diversity scenarios.\n\nTipping points in ocean and atmosphere circulations\n\nSina Loriani, Yevgeny Aksenov, David Armstrong McKay, Govindasamy Bala, Andreas Born, Cristiano M.

We find indications for tipping in the ocean overturning circulations and the West African monsoon, with potentially severe impacts on the Earth system and humans. Tipping in the other considered systems is considered conceivable but currently not sufficiently supported by evidence.\n\nCautionary Remarks on the Planetary Boundary Visualisation\n\nMiguel D. Mahecha and Guido Kraemer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2760,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2760, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur paper examines the influential visual representation of the planetary boundary concept, a widely discussed concept for understanding the limits of the Earth to sustain human societies. We identify three aspects that can lead to misleading interpretations: 1) exaggeration of effect size, 2) complex colour patterns, and 3) combined effects that could potentially overstate certain risks. We suggest revising these visual elements to improve accuracy in communicating this important concept.\n\nThe Pareto effect in tipping social networks: from minority to majority\n\nJordan Paul Everall, Jonathan F. Donges, and Ilona M. Otto\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2241,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2241, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA social tipping process is a rapid, large change in society, and can be started by few people. Does the 80/20 rule apply here? We see if this is the case for human social groups. We find that if so then it occurs when around 25 % of people engage. Tipping seems generally possible in the range of around 10 % to 40 % of the population, with most systems having tipped by the 40 % mark. When people don't change so easily, trusting groups of friends and housemates can help convince wayward friends.\n\nLearning Extreme Vegetation Response to Climate Forcing: A Comparison of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures\n\nFrancesco Martinuzzi, Miguel D. Mahecha, Gustau Camps-Valls, David Montero, Tristan Williams, and Karin Mora\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2368,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2368, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated how machine learning can forecast extreme vegetation responses to weather. Examining four models, no single one stood out as the best, though \"echo state networks\" showed minor advantages. Our results indicate that while these tools are able to generally model vegetation states, they face challenges under extreme conditions. This underlines the potential of artificial intelligence in ecosystem modeling, also pinpointing areas that need further research.\n\nNegative Social Tipping Dynamics Resulting from and Reinforcing Earth System Destabilisation\n\nViktoria Spaiser, Sirkku Juhola, Sara M.

Abrams\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1475,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1475, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we identify potential negative social tipping points linked to Earth system destabilisation and draw on related research to understand the drivers and likelihood of these negative social tipping dynamics, their potential effects on human societies and the Earth system, and the potential for cascading interactions and contribution to systemic risks.\n\nA global social activation model of enabling conditions for positive social tipping – the role of sea-level rise anticipation and climate change concern\n\nE. Keith Smith, Marc Wiedermann, Jonathan F. Donges, Jobst Heitzig, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1622,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1622, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSocial tipping dynamics have received recent attention as a potential mechanism for effective climate actions – yet how such tipping dynamics could unfold remains largely unquantified. We explore how social tipping processes can developed via enabling necessary conditions (exemplified by climate change concern) and increased perceptions of localized impacts (sea-level rise). The likelihood for social tipping varies regionally, mostly along areas with highest exposure to persistent risks.\n\nExploring the impacts of unprecedented climate extremes on forest ecosystems: hypotheses to guide modeling and experimental studies\n\nJennifer A. Holm, David M. Medvigy, Benjamin Smith, Jeffrey S. Dukes, Claus Beier, Mikhail Mishurov, Xiangtao Xu, Jeremy W. Lichstein, Craig D. Allen, Klaus S. Larsen, Yiqi Luo, Cari Ficken, William T. Pockman, William R. L. Anderegg, and Anja Rammig\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2117–2142, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2117-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2117-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnprecedented climate extremes (UCEs) are expected to have dramatic impacts on ecosystems. We present a road map of how dynamic vegetation models can explore extreme drought and climate change and assess ecological processes to measure and reduce model uncertainties. The models predict strong nonlinear responses to UCEs. Due to different model representations, the models differ in magnitude and trajectory of forest loss. Therefore, we explore specific plant responses that reflect knowledge gaps.\n\nAccelerated photosynthesis routine in LPJmL4\n\nJenny Niebsch, Werner von Bloh, Kirsten Thonicke, and Ronny Ramlau\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 17–33, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-17-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-17-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impacts of climate change require strategies for climate adaptation. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are used to study the effects of multiple processes in the biosphere under climate change. There is a demand for a better computational performance of the models. In this paper, the photosynthesis model in the Lund–Potsdam–Jena managed Land DGVM (4.0.002) was examined. We found a better numerical solution of a nonlinear equation. A significant run time reduction was possible.\n\nInterannual global carbon cycle variations linked to atmospheric circulation variability\n\nNa Li, Sebastian Sippel, Alexander J. Winkler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Markus Reichstein, and Ana Bastos\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1505–1533, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the imprint of large-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics and associated carbon cycle responses is key to improving our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics. Using a statistical model that relies on spatiotemporal sea level pressure as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric circulation, we quantify the fraction of interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the land CO2 sink that are driven by atmospheric circulation variability.\n\nClimate and parameter sensitivity and induced uncertainties in carbon stock projections for European forests (using LPJ-GUESS 4.0)\n\nJohannes Oberpriller, Christine Herschlein, Peter Anthoni, Almut Arneth, Andreas Krause, Anja Rammig, Mats Lindeskog, Stefan Olin, and Florian Hartig\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 6495–6519, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6495-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-6495-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding uncertainties of projected ecosystem dynamics under environmental change is of immense value for research and climate change policy. Here, we analyzed these across European forests. We find that uncertainties are dominantly induced by parameters related to water, mortality, and climate, with an increasing importance of climate from north to south. These results highlight that climate not only contributes uncertainty but also modifies uncertainties in other ecosystem processes.\n\nRecent extreme drought events in the Amazon rainforest: assessment of different precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets and drought indicators\n\nPhillip Papastefanou, Christian S.

SÃ¶rensson, Kirsten Thonicke, Carolina Vera, Nicolas Viovy, Celso Von Randow, and Anja Rammig\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3843–3861, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3843-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3843-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Amazon rainforest has been hit by multiple severe drought events. In this study, we assess the severity and spatial extent of the extreme drought years 2005, 2010 and 2015/16 in the Amazon. Using nine different precipitation datasets and three drought indicators we find large differences in drought stress across the Amazon region. We conclude that future studies should use multiple rainfall datasets and drought indicators when estimating the impact of drought stress in the Amazon region.\n\nSPECTRAL: AWESOME SPECTRAL INDICES DEPLOYED VIA THE GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE JAVASCRIPT API\n\nD.

Haacker, Jonathan F. Donges, Torsten Albrecht, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1077–1096, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1077-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1077-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet under global warming is crucial. Here, using PISM, we study how the interplay of feedbacks between the ice sheet, the atmosphere and solid Earth affects the long-term response of the Greenland Ice Sheet under constant warming. Our findings suggest four distinct dynamic regimes of the Greenland Ice Sheet on the route to destabilization under global warming – from recovery via quasi-periodic oscillations in ice volume to ice sheet collapse.\n\nEVALUATING THE POTENTIAL OF DESIS TO INFER PLANT TAXONOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITIES IN EUROPEAN FORESTS\n\nJ.

Model Dev., 14, 6071–6112, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6071-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6071-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForests play an important role in the global carbon cycle and for carbon storage. In Europe, forests are intensively managed. To understand how management influences carbon storage in European forests, we implement detailed forest management into the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. We test the model by comparing model output to typical forestry measures, such as growing stock and harvest data, for different countries in Europe.\n\nVariable tree rooting strategies are key for modelling the distribution, productivity and evapotranspiration of tropical evergreen forests\n\nBoris Sakschewski, Werner von Bloh, Markus DrÃ¼ke, Anna Amelia SÃ¶rensson, Romina Ruscica, Fanny Langerwisch, Maik Billing, Sarah Bereswill, Marina Hirota, Rafael Silva Oliveira, Jens Heinke, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4091–4116, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4091-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4091-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study shows how local adaptations of tree roots across tropical and sub-tropical South America explain patterns of biome distribution, productivity and evapotranspiration on this continent. By allowing for high diversity of tree rooting strategies in a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), we are able to mechanistically explain patterns of mean rooting depth and the effects on ecosystem functions. The approach can advance DGVMs and Earth system models.\n\nCM2Mc-LPJmL v1.0: biophysical coupling of a process-based dynamic vegetation model with managed land to a general circulation model\n\nMarkus DrÃ¼ke, Werner von Bloh, Stefan Petri, Boris Sakschewski, Sibyll Schaphoff, Matthias Forkel, Willem Huiskamp, Georg Feulner, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 4117–4141, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4117-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4117-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we couple the well-established and comprehensively validated state-of-the-art dynamic LPJmL5 global vegetation model to the CM2Mc coupled climate model (CM2Mc-LPJmL v.1.0). Several improvements to LPJmL5 were implemented to allow a fully functional biophysical coupling. The new climate model is able to capture important biospheric processes, including fire, mortality, permafrost, hydrological cycling and the the impacts of managed land (crop growth and irrigation).\n\nInteracting tipping elements increase risk of climate domino effects under global warming\n\nNico Wunderling, Jonathan F. Donges, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 601–619, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-601-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-601-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the Earth system, climate tipping elements exist that can undergo qualitative changes in response to environmental perturbations. If triggered, this would result in severe consequences for the biosphere and human societies. We quantify the risk of tipping cascades using a conceptual but fully dynamic network approach. We uncover that the risk of tipping cascades under global warming scenarios is enormous and find that the continental ice sheets are most likely to initiate these failures.\n\nCO2 physiological effect can cause rainfall decrease as strong as large-scale deforestation in the Amazon\n\nGilvan Sampaio, MarÃ­lia H. Shimizu, Carlos A. GuimarÃ£es-JÃºnior, Felipe Alexandre, Marcelo Guatura, Manoel Cardoso, Tomas F. Domingues, Anja Rammig, Celso von Randow, Luiz F. C. Rezende, and David M. Lapola\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2511–2525, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2511-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2511-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of large-scale deforestation and the physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on Amazon rainfall are systematically compared in this study. Our results are remarkable in showing that the two disturbances cause equivalent rainfall decrease, though through different causal mechanisms. These results highlight the importance of not only curbing regional deforestation but also reducing global CO2 emissions to avoid climatic changes in the Amazon.\n\nGlobal cotton production under climate change â Implications for yield and water consumption\n\nYvonne Jans, Werner von Bloh, Sibyll Schaphoff, and Christoph MÃ¼ller\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 2027–2044, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2027-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2027-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGrowth of and irrigation water demand on cotton may be challenged by future climate change. To analyze the global cotton production and irrigation water consumption under spatially varying present and future climatic conditions, we use the global terrestrial biosphere model LPJmL. Our simulation results suggest that the beneficial effects of elevated [CO2] on cotton yields overcompensate yield losses from direct climate change impacts, i.e., without the beneficial effect of [CO2] fertilization.\n\nFunctional convergence of biosphereâatmosphere interactions in response to meteorological conditions\n\nChristopher Krich, Mirco Migliavacca, Diego G. Miralles, Guido Kraemer, Tarek S. El-Madany, Markus Reichstein, Jakob Runge, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2379–2404, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2379-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2379-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEcosystems and the atmosphere interact with each other. These interactions determine e.g. the water and carbon fluxes and thus are crucial to understand climate change effects. We analysed the interactions for many ecosystems across the globe, showing that very different ecosystems can have similar interactions with the atmosphere. Meteorological conditions seem to be the strongest interaction-shaping factor. This means that common principles can be identified to describe ecosystem behaviour.\n\nThe tipping points and early warning indicators for Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica\n\nSebastian H. R. Rosier, Ronja Reese, Jonathan F. Donges, Jan De Rydt, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1501–1516, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1501-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1501-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPine Island Glacier has contributed more to sea-level rise over the past decades than any other glacier in Antarctica. Ice-flow modelling studies have shown that it can undergo periods of rapid mass loss, but no study has shown that these future changes could cross a tipping point and therefore be effectively irreversible. Here, we assess the stability of Pine Island Glacier, quantifying the changes in ocean temperatures required to cross future tipping points using statistical methods.\n\nVegetation modulates the impact of climate extremes on gross primary production\n\nMilan Flach, Alexander Brenning, Fabian Gans, Markus Reichstein, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 39–53, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought and heat events affect the uptake and sequestration of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. We study the impact of droughts and heatwaves on the uptake of CO2 of different vegetation types at the global scale. We find that agricultural areas are generally strongly affected. Forests instead are not particularly sensitive to the events under scrutiny. This implies different water management strategies of forests but also a lack of sensitivity to remote-sensing-derived vegetation activity.\n\nEcosystem physio-phenology revealed using circular statistics\n\nDaniel E. Pabon-Moreno, Talie Musavi, Mirco Migliavacca, Markus Reichstein, Christine RÃ¶mermann, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3991–4006, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3991-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3991-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEcosystem CO2 uptake changes in time depending on climate conditions. In this study, we analyze how different climate variables affect the timing when CO2 uptake is at a maximum (DOYGPPmax). We found that the joint effects of radiation, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most relevant controlling factors of DOYGPPmax and that if they increase, DOYGPPmax will happen earlier. These results help us to better understand how CO2 uptake could be affected by climate change.\n\nUnderstanding the uncertainty in global forest carbon turnover\n\nThomas A. M.

Estimates from six contemporary models found this time to range from 12.2 to 23.5 years for the global mean for 1985–2014. Future projections do not give consistent results, but 13 model-based hypotheses are identified, along with recommendations for pragmatic steps to test them using existing and novel observations, which would help to reduce large current uncertainty.\n\nSummarizing the state of the terrestrial biosphere in few dimensions\n\nGuido Kraemer, Gustau Camps-Valls, Markus Reichstein, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2397–2424, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo closely monitor the state of our planet, we require systems that can monitor the observation of many different properties at the same time. We create indicators that resemble the behavior of many different simultaneous observations. We apply the method to create indicators representing the Earth's biosphere. The indicators show a productivity gradient and a water gradient. The resulting indicators can detect a large number of changes and extremes in the Earth system.\n\nEarth system modeling with endogenous and dynamic human societies: the copan:CORE open WorldâEarth modeling framework\n\nJonathan F.

Zimmerer, and Wolfgang Lucht\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 395–413, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-395-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-395-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an open-source software framework for developing so-called world–Earth models that link physical, chemical and biological processes with social, economic and cultural processes to study the Earth system's future trajectories in the Anthropocene. Due to its modular structure, the software allows interdisciplinary studies of global change and sustainable development that combine stylized model components from Earth system science, climatology, economics, ecology and sociology.\n\nQuantifying impacts of the 2018 drought on European ecosystems in comparison to 2003\n\nAllan Buras, Anja Rammig, and Christian S. Zang\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1655–1672, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1655-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1655-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study compares the climatic conditions and ecosystem response of the extreme European drought of 2018 with the previous extreme drought of 2003. Using gridded climate data and satellite-based remote sensing information, our analyses qualify 2018 as the new European record drought with wide-ranging negative impacts on European ecosystems. Given the observation of forest-legacy effects in 2019 we call for Europe-wide forest monitoring to assess forest vulnerability to climate change.\n\nEstimating causal networks in biosphereâatmosphere interaction with the PCMCI approach\n\nChristopher Krich, Jakob Runge, Diego G. Miralles, Mirco Migliavacca, Oscar Perez-Priego, Tarek El-Madany, Arnaud Carrara, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1033–1061, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1033-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1033-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCausal inference promises new insight into biosphere–atmosphere interactions using time series only. To understand the behaviour of a specific method on such data, we used artificial and observation-based data. The observed structures are very interpretable and reveal certain ecosystem-specific behaviour, as only a few relevant links remain, in contrast to pure correlation techniques. Thus, causal inference allows to us gain well-constrained insights into processes and interactions.\n\nEarth system data cubes unravel global multivariate dynamics\n\nMiguel D.

However, researching a data-rich world brings novel challenges. We present the concept of Earth system data cubes to study the complex dynamics of multiple climate and ecosystem variables across space and time. Using a series of example studies, we highlight the potential of effectively considering the full multivariate nature of processes in the Earth system.\n\nTowards a global understanding of vegetationâclimate dynamics at multiple timescales\n\nNora Linscheid, Lina M. Estupinan-Suarez, Alexander Brenning, Nuno Carvalhais, Felix Cremer, Fabian Gans, Anja Rammig, Markus Reichstein, Carlos A. Sierra, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 945–962, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation typically responds to variation in temperature and rainfall within days. Yet seasonal changes in meteorological conditions, as well as decadal climate variability, additionally shape the state of ecosystems. It remains unclear how vegetation responds to climate variability on these different timescales. We find that the vegetation response to climate variability depends on the timescale considered. This scale dependency should be considered for modeling land–atmosphere interactions.\n\nImproving the LPJmL4-SPITFIRE vegetationâfire model for South America using satellite data\n\nMarkus DrÃ¼ke, Matthias Forkel, Werner von Bloh, Boris Sakschewski, Manoel Cardoso, Mercedes Bustamante, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 5029–5054, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-5029-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-5029-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work shows the successful application of a systematic modelâdata integration setup, as well as the implementation of a new fire danger formulation, in order to optimize a process-based fire-enabled dynamic global vegetation model. We have demonstrated a major improvement in the fire representation within LPJmL4-SPITFIRE in terms of the spatial pattern and the interannual variability of burned area in South America as well as in the modelling of biomass and the distribution of plant types.\n\nA social-ecological approach to identify and quantify biodiversity tipping points in South America's seasonal dry ecosystems\n\nKirsten Thonicke, Fanny Langerwisch, Matthias Baumann, Pedro J. LeitÃ£o, TomÃ¡Å¡ VÃ¡clavÃ­k, Ane Alencar, Margareth SimÃµes, Simon Scheiter, Liam Langan, Mercedes Bustamante, Ignacio Gasparri, Marina Hirota, Jan BÃ¶rner, Raoni Rajao, Britaldo Soares-Filho, Alberto Yanosky, JosÃ©-Manuel Ochoa-Quinteiro, Lucas Seghezzo, Georgina Conti, and Anne Cristina de la Vega-Leinert\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-221,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-221, 2019\n\nPublication in BG not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropical dry forests and savannas harbor unique biodiversity and provide critical ecosystem services (ES), yet they are under severe pressure globally. We need to improve our understanding of how and when this pressure provokes tipping points in biodiversity and the associated social-ecological systems. We propose an approach to investigate how drivers leading to natural vegetation decline trigger biodiversity tipping and illustrate it using the example of the Dry Diagonal in South America.\n\nSimulating the effect of tillage practices with the global ecosystem model LPJmL (version 5.0-tillage)\n\nFemke Lutz, Tobias Herzfeld, Jens Heinke, Susanne Rolinski, Sibyll Schaphoff, Werner von Bloh, Jetse J. Stoorvogel, and Christoph MÃ¼ller\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2419–2440, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2419-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2419-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTillage practices are under-represented in global biogeochemical models so that assessments of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and climate mitigation options are hampered. We describe the implementation of tillage modules into the model LPJmL5.0, including multiple feedbacks between soil water, nitrogen, and productivity. By comparing simulation results with observational data, we show that the model can reproduce reported tillage effects on carbon and water dynamics and crop yields.\n\nA generic pixel-to-point comparison for simulated large-scale ecosystem properties and ground-based observations: an example from the Amazon region\n\nAnja Rammig, Jens Heinke, Florian Hofhansl, Hans Verbeeck, Timothy R. Baker, Bradley Christoffersen, Philippe Ciais, Hannes De Deurwaerder, Katrin Fleischer, David Galbraith, Matthieu Guimberteau, Andreas Huth, Michelle Johnson, Bart Krujit, Fanny Langerwisch, Patrick Meir, Phillip Papastefanou, Gilvan Sampaio, Kirsten Thonicke, Celso von Randow, Christian Zang, and Edna RÃ¶dig\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 5203–5215, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-5203-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-5203-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose a generic approach for a pixel-to-point comparison applicable for evaluation of models and remote-sensing products. We provide statistical measures accounting for the uncertainty in ecosystem variables. We demonstrate our approach by comparing simulated values of aboveground biomass, woody productivity and residence time of woody biomass from four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with measured inventory data from permanent plots in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nContrasting biosphere responses to hydrometeorological extremes: revisiting the 2010 western Russian heatwave\n\nMilan Flach, Sebastian Sippel, Fabian Gans, Ana Bastos, Alexander Brenning, Markus Reichstein, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 6067–6085, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6067-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6067-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNorthern forests enhanced their productivity during and before the 2010 Russian mega heatwave. We scrutinize this issue with a novel type of multivariate extreme event detection approach. Forests compensate for 54 % of the carbon losses in agricultural ecosystems due to vulnerable conditions in spring and better water management in summer. The findings highlight the importance of forests in mitigating climate change, while not alleviating the consequences of extreme events for food security.\n\nUpscaled diurnal cycles of landâatmosphere fluxes: a new global half-hourly data product\n\nPaul Bodesheim, Martin Jung, Fabian Gans, Miguel D. Mahecha, and Markus Reichstein\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 1327–1365, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1327-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1327-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide continuous half-hourly carbon and energy fluxes for 2001 to 2014 at 0.5Â° spatial resolution, which allows for analyzing diurnal cycles globally. The data set contains four fluxes: gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent heat (LE), and sensible heat (H). In addition, we provide a derived product that only contains monthly average diurnal cycles but which also enables us to study the important characteristics of subdaily patterns at a global scale.\n\nImplementing the nitrogen cycle into the dynamic global vegetation, hydrology, and crop growth model LPJmL (version 5.0)\n\nWerner von Bloh, Sibyll Schaphoff, Christoph MÃ¼ller, Susanne Rolinski, Katharina Waha, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 2789–2812, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2789-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2789-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle are of central importance for Earth system science. Nutrient limitations, especially from nitrogen, are important constraints on vegetation growth and the terrestrial carbon cycle. We extended the well-established global vegetation, hydrology, and crop model LPJmL with a nitrogen cycle. We find significant improvement in global patterns of crop productivity. Regional differences in crop productivity can now be largely reproduced by the model.\n\nAnalytically tractable climate–carbon cycle feedbacks under 21st century anthropogenic forcing\n\nSteven J. Lade, Jonathan F. Donges, Ingo Fetzer, John M. Anderies, Christian Beer, Sarah E. Cornell, Thomas Gasser, Jon Norberg, Katherine Richardson, Johan RockstrÃ¶m, and Will Steffen\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 507–523, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-507-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-507-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAround half of the carbon that humans emit into the atmosphere each year is taken up on land (by trees) and in the ocean (by absorption). We construct a simple model of carbon uptake that, unlike the complex models that are usually used, can be analysed mathematically. Our results include that changes in atmospheric carbon may affect future carbon uptake more than changes in climate. Our simple model could also study mechanisms that are currently too uncertain for complex models.\n\nLPJmL4 â a dynamic global vegetation model with managed land â PartÂ 1: Model description\n\nSibyll Schaphoff, Werner von Bloh, Anja Rammig, Kirsten Thonicke, Hester Biemans, Matthias Forkel, Dieter Gerten, Jens Heinke, Jonas JÃ¤germeyr, JÃ¼rgen Knauer, Fanny Langerwisch, Wolfgang Lucht, Christoph MÃ¼ller, Susanne Rolinski, and Katharina Waha\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 1343–1375, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1343-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1343-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we provide a comprehensive model description of a global terrestrial biosphere model, named LPJmL4, incorporating the carbon and water cycle and the quantification of agricultural production. The model allows for the consistent and joint quantification of climate and land use change impacts on the biosphere. The model represents the key ecosystem functions, but also the influence of humans on the biosphere. It comes with an evaluation paper to demonstrate the credibility of LPJmL4.\n\nLPJmL4 â a dynamic global vegetation model with managed land â PartÂ 2: Model evaluation\n\nSibyll Schaphoff, Matthias Forkel, Christoph MÃ¼ller, JÃ¼rgen Knauer, Werner von Bloh, Dieter Gerten, Jonas JÃ¤germeyr, Wolfgang Lucht, Anja Rammig, Kirsten Thonicke, and Katharina Waha\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 1377–1403, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1377-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1377-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the now launched version 4.0 of the LPJmL biosphere, water, and agricultural model. The article is the second part to a comprehensive description of the LPJmL4 model. We have evaluated the model against various datasets of satellite observations, agricultural statistics, and in situ measurements by applying a range of metrics. We are able to show that the LPJmL4 model simulates many parameters and relations reasonably.\n\nImpacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones\n\nJannis von Buttlar, Jakob Zscheischler, Anja Rammig, Sebastian Sippel, Markus Reichstein, Alexander Knohl, Martin Jung, Olaf Menzer, M.

Scott, Francesco P. Vaccari, Eva van Gorsel, Andrej Varlagin, Georg Wohlfahrt, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1293–1318, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work systematically quantifies extreme heat and drought event impacts on gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration globally across a wide range of ecosystems. We show that heat extremes typically increased mainly respiration whereas drought decreased both fluxes. Combined heat and drought extremes had opposing effects offsetting each other for respiration, but there were also strong reductions in GPP and hence the strongest reductions in the ecosystems carbon sink capacity.\n\nModeling vegetation and carbon dynamics of managed grasslands at the global scale with LPJmL 3.6\n\nSusanne Rolinski, Christoph MÃ¼ller, Jens Heinke, Isabelle Weindl, Anne Biewald, Benjamin Leon Bodirsky, Alberte Bondeau, Eltje R. Boons-Prins, Alexander F. Bouwman, Peter A. Leffelaar, Johnny A. te Roller, Sibyll Schaphoff, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 429–451, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-429-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-429-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOne-third of the global land area is covered with grasslands which are grazed by or mowed for livestock feed. These areas contribute significantly to the carbon capture from the atmosphere when managed sensibly. To assess the effect of this management, we included different options of grazing and mowing into the global model LPJmL 3.6. We found in polar regions even low grazing pressure leads to soil carbon loss whereas in temperate regions up to 1.4 livestock units per hectare can be sustained.\n\nA data-driven approach to identify controls on global fire activity from satellite and climate observations (SOFIA V1)\n\nMatthias Forkel, Wouter Dorigo, Gitta Lasslop, Irene Teubner, Emilio Chuvieco, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 4443–4476, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4443-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4443-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWildfires affect infrastructures, vegetation, and the atmosphere. However, it is unclear how fires should be accurately represented in global vegetation models. We introduce here a new flexible data-driven fire modelling approach that allows us to explore sensitivities of burned areas to satellite and climate datasets. Our results suggest combining observations with data-driven and process-oriented fire models to better understand the role of fires in the Earth system.\n\nAssessing the impacts of 1.5â¯Â°C global warming â simulation protocol of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b)\n\nKatja Frieler, Stefan Lange, Franziska Piontek, Christopher P.

ISIMIP brings together over 80 climate-impact models, covering impacts on hydrology, biomes, forests, heat-related mortality, permafrost, tropical cyclones, fisheries, agiculture, energy, and coastal infrastructure.\n\nTowards representing human behavior and decision making in Earth system models â an overview of techniques and approaches\n\nFinn MÃ¼ller-Hansen, Maja SchlÃ¼ter, Michael MÃ¤s, Jonathan F. Donges, Jakob J. Kolb, Kirsten Thonicke, and Jobst Heitzig\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 977–1007, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-977-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-977-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nToday, human interactions with the Earth system lead to complex feedbacks between social and ecological dynamics. Modeling such feedbacks explicitly in Earth system models (ESMs) requires making assumptions about individual decision making and behavior, social interaction, and their aggregation. In this overview paper, we compare different modeling approaches and techniques and highlight important consequences of modeling assumptions. We illustrate them with examples from land-use modeling.\n\nReverse engineering model structures for soil and ecosystem respiration: the potential of gene expression programming\n\nIulia Ilie, Peter Dittrich, Nuno Carvalhais, Martin Jung, Andreas Heinemeyer, Mirco Migliavacca, James I. L. Morison, Sebastian Sippel, Jens-Arne Subke, Matthew Wilkinson, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 3519–3545, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3519-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3519-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate representation of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes is essential for future climate projections, although some of the responses of CO2 fluxes to climate often remain uncertain. The increase in available data allows for new approaches in their modelling. We automatically developed models for ecosystem and soil carbon respiration using a machine learning approach. When compared with established respiration models, we found that they are better in prediction as well as offering new insights.\n\nDetecting impacts of extreme events with ecological inÂ situ monitoring networks\n\nMiguel D. Mahecha, Fabian Gans, Sebastian Sippel, Jonathan F. Donges, Thomas Kaminski, Stefan Metzger, Mirco Migliavacca, Dario Papale, Anja Rammig, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 4255–4277, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the likelihood of ecological in situ networks to detect and monitor the impact of extreme events in the terrestrial biosphere.\n\nReviews and syntheses: An empirical spatiotemporal description of the global surfaceâatmosphere carbon fluxes: opportunities and data limitations\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Miguel D.

Roman-Cuesta, Christopher Schwalm, Gianluca Tramontana, Alexandra Tyukavina, Riccardo Valentini, Guido van der Werf, Tristram O. West, Julie E. Wolf, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3685–3703, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3685-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3685-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we synthesize a wide range of global spatiotemporal observational data on carbon exchanges between the Earth surface and the atmosphere. A key challenge was to consistently combining observational products of terrestrial and aquatic surfaces. Our primary goal is to identify todayâs key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that would need to be addressed in future measurement campaigns or expansions of in situ observatories.\n\nMultivariate anomaly detection for Earth observations: a comparison of algorithms and feature extraction techniques\n\nMilan Flach, Fabian Gans, Alexander Brenning, Joachim Denzler, Markus Reichstein, Erik Rodner, Sebastian Bathiany, Paul Bodesheim, Yanira Guanche, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 677–696, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnomalies and extremes are often detected using univariate peak-over-threshold approaches in the geoscience community. The Earth system is highly multivariate. We compare eight multivariate anomaly detection algorithms and combinations of data preprocessing. We identify three anomaly detection algorithms that outperform univariate extreme event detection approaches. The workflows have the potential to reveal novelties in data. Remarks on their application to real Earth observations are provided.\n\nRefining multi-model projections of temperature extremes by evaluation against land–atmosphere coupling diagnostics\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Rene Orth, Markus Reichstein, Martha Vogel, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 387–403, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study (1) evaluates land–atmosphere coupling in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble against an ensemble of benchmarking datasets and (2) refines the model ensemble using a land–atmosphere coupling diagnostic as constraint. Our study demonstrates that a considerable fraction of coupled climate models overemphasize warm-season moisture-limited climate regimes in midlatitude regions. This leads to biases in daily-scale temperature extremes, which are alleviated in a constrained ensemble.\n\nSustainable use of renewable resources in a stylized socialâecological network model under heterogeneous resource distribution\n\nWolfram Barfuss, Jonathan F. Donges, Marc Wiedermann, and Wolfgang Lucht\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 255–264, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-255-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-255-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHuman societies depend on the resources ecosystems provide. We study this coevolutionary relationship by utilizing a stylized model of resource users on a social network. This model demonstrates that social–cultural processes can have a profound influence on the environmental state, such as determining whether the resources collapse from overuse or not. This suggests that social–cultural processes should receive more attention in the modeling of sustainability transitions and the Earth system.\n\nImpacts of future deforestation and climate change on the hydrology of the Amazon Basin: a multi-model analysis with a new set of land-cover change scenarios\n\nMatthieu Guimberteau, Philippe Ciais, AgnÃ¨s Ducharne, Juan Pablo Boisier, Ana Paula Dutra Aguiar, Hester Biemans, Hannes De Deurwaerder, David Galbraith, Bart Kruijt, Fanny Langerwisch, German Poveda, Anja Rammig, Daniel Andres Rodriguez, Graciela Tejada, Kirsten Thonicke, Celso Von Randow, Rita C. S. Von Randow, Ke Zhang, and Hans Verbeeck\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1455–1475, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1455-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1455-2017, 2017\n\nA matrix clustering method to explore patterns of land-cover transitions in satellite-derived maps of the Brazilian Amazon\n\nFinn MÃ¼ller-Hansen, Manoel F. Cardoso, Eloi L. Dalla-Nora, Jonathan F. Donges, Jobst Heitzig, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Kirsten Thonicke\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 24, 113–123, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-113-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-113-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDeforestation and subsequent land uses in the Brazilian Amazon have huge impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, local climate and biodiversity. To better understand these land-cover changes, we apply complex systems methods uncovering spatial patterns in regional transition probabilities between land-cover types, which we estimate using maps derived from satellite imagery. The results show clusters of similar land-cover dynamics and thus complement studies at the local scale.\n\nHave precipitation extremes and annual totals been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60Â years?\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Martin Heimann, Holger Lange, Miguel D. Mahecha, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike E. L. Otto, and Markus Reichstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 441–458, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-441-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-441-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper re-investigates the question whether observed precipitation extremes and annual totals have been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60 years. Despite recently postulated increasing trends, we demonstrate that large uncertainties prevail due to (1) the choice of dryness definition and (2) statistical data processing. In fact, we find only minor (and only some significant) increases if (1) dryness is based on aridity and (2) statistical artefacts are accounted for.\n\nDeforestation in Amazonia impacts riverine carbon dynamics\n\nFanny Langerwisch, Ariane Walz, Anja Rammig, Britta Tietjen, Kirsten Thonicke, and Wolfgang Cramer\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 953–968, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-953-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-953-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmazonia is heavily impacted by climate change and deforestation. During annual flooding terrigenous material is imported to the river, converted and finally exported to the ocean or the atmosphere. Changes in the vegetation alter therefore riverine carbon dynamics. Our results show that due to deforestation organic carbon amount will strongly decrease both in the river and exported to the ocean, while inorganic carbon amounts will increase, in the river as well as exported to the atmosphere.\n\nCollateral transgression of planetary boundaries due to climate engineering by terrestrial carbon dioxide removal\n\nVera Heck, Jonathan F. Donges, and Wolfgang Lucht\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 783–796, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-783-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-783-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess the co-evolutionary dynamics of the Earth's carbon cycle and societal interventions through terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) with a conceptual model in a planetary boundary context. The focus on one planetary boundary alone may lead to navigating the Earth system out of the safe operating space due to transgression of other boundaries. The success of tCDR depends on the degree of anticipation of climate change, the potential tCDR rate and the underlying emission pathway.\n\nImpact of temperature and precipitation extremes on the flowering dates of four German wildlife shrub species\n\nJonatan F. Siegmund, Marc Wiedermann, Jonathan F. Donges, and Reik V. Donner\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5541–5555, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5541-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5541-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we systematically quantify simultaneities between meteorological extremes and the timing of flowering of four shrub species across Germany by using event coincidence analysis. Our study confirms previous findings of experimental studies, highlighting the impact of early spring temperatures on the flowering of the investigated plants. Additionally, the analysis reveals statistically significant indications of an influence of temperature extremes in the fall preceding the flowering.\n\nClimate change increases riverine carbon outgassing, while export to the ocean remains uncertain\n\nF. Langerwisch, A. Walz, A. Rammig, B. Tietjen, K. Thonicke, and W. Cramer\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 559–582, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-559-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-559-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Amazonia, carbon fluxes are considerably influenced by annual flooding. We applied the newly developed model RivCM to several climate change scenarios to estimate potential changes in riverine carbon. We find that climate change causes substantial changes in riverine organic and inorganic carbon, as well as changes in carbon exported to the atmosphere and ocean. Such changes could have local and regional impacts on the carbon budget of the whole Amazon basin and parts of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMediterranean irrigation under climate change: more efficient irrigation needed to compensate for increases in irrigation water requirements\n\nM.

Sci., 20, 953–973, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-953-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-953-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAt present, the Mediterranean region could save 35 % of water by implementing more efficient irrigation and conveyance systems (EICS). By 2080–2090 the region may face an increase in gross irrigation requirements (IRs) of up to 74 % due to climate change and population growth. EICS may be able to compensate to some degree these increases. Most countries in the northern and eastern Mediterranean have a high risk of not being able to meet future IRs due to water scarcity.\n\nA novel bias correction methodology for climate impact simulations\n\nS. Sippel, F. E. L. Otto, M. Forkel, M. R. Allen, B. P. Guillod, M. Heimann, M. Reichstein, S. I. Seneviratne, K. Thonicke, and M. D. Mahecha\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 71–88, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-71-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-71-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a novel technique to bias correct climate model output for impact simulations that preserves its physical consistency and multivariate structure. The methodology considerably improves the representation of extremes in climatic variables relative to conventional bias correction strategies. Illustrative simulations of biosphere–atmosphere carbon and water fluxes with a biosphere model (LPJmL) show that the novel technique can be usefully applied to drive climate impact models.\n\nTopology of sustainable management of dynamical systems with desirable states: from defining planetary boundaries to safe operating spaces in the Earth system\n\nJ. Heitzig, T. Kittel, J. F. Donges, and N. Molkenthin\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 21–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-21-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-21-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe debate about a safe and just operating space for humanity and the possible pathways towards and within it requires an analysis of the inherent dynamics of the Earth system and of the options for influencing its evolution. We present and illustrate with examples a conceptual framework for performing such an analysis not in a quantitative, optimizing mode, but in a qualitative way that emphasizes the main decision dilemmas that one may face in the sustainable management of the Earth system.\n\nModelling Mediterranean agro-ecosystems by including agricultural trees in the LPJmL model\n\nM. Fader, W. von Bloh, S. Shi, A. Bondeau, and W. Cramer\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 8, 3545–3561, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3545-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3545-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the inclusion of 10 Mediterranean agricultural plants in an agro-ecosystem model (LPJmL): nut trees, date palms, citrus trees, orchards, olive trees, grapes, cotton, potatoes, vegetables and fodder grasses. The model was successfully tested in three model outputs: agricultural yields, irrigation requirements and soil carbon density. With this development presented, LPJmL is now able to simulate in good detail and mechanistically the functioning of Mediterranean agriculture.\n\nReview: visual analytics of climate networks\n\nT. Nocke, S. Buschmann, J. F. Donges, N. Marwan, H.-J. Schulz, and C. Tominski\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 22, 545–570, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-22-545-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-22-545-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper reviews the available visualisation techniques and tools for the visual analysis of geo-physical climate networks. The results from a questionnaire with experts from non-linear physics are presented, and the paper surveys recent developments from information visualisation and cartography with respect to their applicability for visual climate network analytics. Several case studies based on own solutions illustrate the potentials of state-of-the-art network visualisation technology.\n\nGlobal terrestrial water storage connectivity revealed using complex climate network analyses\n\nA. Y. Sun, J. Chen, and J. Donges\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 22, 433–446, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-22-433-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-22-433-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTerrestrial water storage (TWS) plays a key role in global water and energy cycles. This work applies complex climate networks to analyzing spatial patterns in TWS. A comparative analysis is conducted using a remotely sensed (GRACE) and a model-generated TWS data set. Our results reveal hotspots of TWS anomalies around the global land surfaces. Prospects are offered on using network connectivity as constraints to further improve current global land surface models.\n\nNon-linear regime shifts in Holocene Asian monsoon variability: potential impacts on cultural change and migratory patterns\n\nJ. F. Donges, R. V. Donner, N. Marwan, S. F. M. Breitenbach, K. Rehfeld, and J. Kurths\n\nClim. Past, 11, 709–741, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-11-709-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-11-709-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPaleoclimate records from cave deposits allow the reconstruction of Holocene dynamics of the Asian monsoon system, an important tipping element in Earth's climate. Employing recently developed techniques of nonlinear time series analysis reveals several robust and continental-scale regime shifts in the complexity of monsoonal variability. These regime shifts might have played an important role as drivers of migration, cultural change, and societal collapse during the past 10,000 years.\n\nModelling the role of fires in the terrestrial carbon balance by incorporating SPITFIRE into the global vegetation model ORCHIDEE â Part 2: Carbon emissions and the role of fires in the global carbon balance\n\nC. Yue, P. Ciais, P. Cadule, K. Thonicke, and T. T. van Leeuwen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 8, 1321–1338, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1321-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1321-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted parallel simulations using a global land surface model, with and without fires being included, respectively. When the anthropogenic land cover change fire is excluded, we find that natural wildfires have reduced the global land carbon uptake by 0.3Pg C per year over 1901-2012. This is equivalent to 20% of the land carbon uptake in a world without fire. This fire-induced reduction in carbon uptake could be partly explained by climate variability, in particular the ENSO events.\n\nA probabilistic risk assessment for the vulnerability of the European carbon cycle to weather extremes: the ecosystem perspective\n\nS. Rolinski, A. Rammig, A. Walz, W. von Bloh, M. van Oijen, and K. Thonicke\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 1813–1831, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1813-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-1813-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme weather events can but do not have to cause extreme ecosystem response. Here, we focus on hazardous ecosystem behaviour and identify coinciding weather conditions. We use a simple probabilistic risk assessment and apply it to terrestrial ecosystems, defining a hazard as negative net biome productivity. In Europe, ecosystems are vulnerable to drought in the Mediterranean and temperate region, whereas vulnerability in Scandinavia is not caused by water shortages.\n\nOn the importance of cascading moisture recycling in South America\n\nD.

Van Oijen, J. Balkovi, C. Beer, D. R. Cameron, P. Ciais, W. Cramer, T. Kato, M. Kuhnert, R. Martin, R. Myneni, A. Rammig, S. Rolinski, J.-F. Soussana, K. Thonicke, M. Van der Velde, and L. Xu\n\nBiogeosciences, 11, 6357–6375, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-6357-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-6357-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a new risk analysis method, and six vegetation models, to analyse how climate change may alter drought risks in European ecosystems. The conclusions are (1) drought will pose increasing risks to productivity in the Mediterranean area; (2) this is because severe droughts will become more frequent, not because ecosystems will become more vulnerable; (3) future C sequestration will be at risk because carbon gain in primary productivity will be more affected than carbon loss in respiration.\n\nModelling the role of fires in the terrestrial carbon balance by incorporating SPITFIRE into the global vegetation model ORCHIDEE â Part 1: simulating historical global burned area and fire regimes\n\nC. Yue, P. Ciais, P. Cadule, K. Thonicke, S. Archibald, B. Poulter, W. M. Hao, S. Hantson, F. Mouillot, P. Friedlingstein, F. Maignan, and N. Viovy\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 7, 2747–2767, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-2747-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-2747-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nORCHIDEE-SPITFIRE model could moderately capture the decadal trend and variation of burned area during the 20th century, and the spatial and temporal patterns of contemporary vegetation fires. The model has a better performance in simulating fires for regions dominated by climate-driven fires, such as boreal forests. However, it has limited capability to reproduce the infrequent but important large fires in different ecosystems, where urgent model improvement is needed in the future.\n\nClimate-mediated spatiotemporal variability in terrestrial productivity across Europe\n\nX.
