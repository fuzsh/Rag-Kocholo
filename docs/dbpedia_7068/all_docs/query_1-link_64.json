        "text": "Public Library Training Institute is a three-year program of continuing education for new library directors, support staff, and trustees of small public libraries. The focus of the curriculum is public libraries. Institute is limited to 25 students. Preference will be given to students that are new to their position and have limited experience working in libraries.\n\nSouth Dakota-based library practitioners, support staff and trustees of small public libraries are encouraged to register. No prior formal library science education, or previous college attendance, is required to attend. Students will earn two college credits when attending summer session.\n\nInstitute participants can start the program at any point in the curriculum, but must complete a program of continuing education that includes on-campus and off-campus requirements. A winter course for current students is held every December through April. Participation in this course every year a student is part of the program is required.\n\nRegistration for new students opens every February. Students are responsible for paying for lodging (on or off campus), meals, and transportation.\n\nInstitute instructors provide in-depth classes in: the foundations of public library service; public library administration; services to the public; collections; cataloging and metadata; technology; as well as other current topics. Students earn college credit from the host university, and after completion of the program, are recognized as certified public library practitioners.\n\nFocus areas of the program are administration, library resources and collections, and youth services.\n\nLibrary Institute students are encouraged to attend Regional Library trainings in the spring and fall. Two physical locations will be scheduled, along with an online option. ."
