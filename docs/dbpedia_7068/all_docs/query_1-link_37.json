        "text": "Endosomal escape of delivered mRNA from endosomal recycling tubules visualized at the nanoscale\n\nDelivery of exogenous mRNA using lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is a promising strategy for therapeutics. Which parameters correlate with endosomal escape vs. cytotoxicity remain elusive. Therefore, we compared the endosomal distribution of six LNP-mRNA formulations in different human cell types. Surprisingly, we found that total uptake is not a good predictor of delivery. Prolonged uptake impaired endosomal acidification and mRNA accumulated in delivery incompetent. We showed that early endocytic/recycling compartments have the highest probability for mRNA escape. Our results change the view of the mechanisms of endosomal escape and could guide the development of LNPs towards higher efficacy and lower cytotoxicity.\n\nParamasivam, P., Franke, C., Stöter, M., Höijer, A., Bartesaghi, S., Sabirsh, A., Lindfors, L., Yanez Arteta, M., Dahlén, A., Bak, A., Andersson, S., Kalaidzidis, Y., Bickle, M., Zerial, M.

In the liver, however, hepatocytes share the apical surface only between adjacent cells and form narrow lumina that grow anisotropically, generating a 3D network of bile canaliculi (BC). Here we discovered that adjacent hepatocytes assemble a pattern of specific extensions of the apical membrane traversing the lumen ensuring its anisotropic expansion. These previously unrecognized structures form a pattern reminiscent of the bulkheads of boats, also present in the developing and adult liver. Our results suggest that apical bulkheads are cell-intrinsic anisotropic mechanical elements that determine the elongation of BC during liver tissue morphogenesis.\n\nBelicova, L., Repnik, U., Delpierre, L., Gralinska, E., Seifert, S., Valenzuela, J.I., Morales-Navarrete, H., Franke, C., Räägel, H., Shcherbinina, E., Prikazchikova, T., Koteliansky, V., Martin Vingron, Kalaidzidis, Y., Zatsepin, T., Zerial, M.

Here we address the mechanism whereby a tethered vesicle comes closer towards its target membrane for fusion by reconstituting an endosomal asymmetric tethering machinery consisting of the dimeric coiled-coil protein EEA1 recruited to PI3P membranes and binding vesicles harbouring Rab5. Surprisingly, structural analysis reveals that Rab5:GTP induces an allosteric conformational change in EEA1, from extended to flexible and collapsed. Our results suggest a new mechanism in which Rab5 induces a change in flexibility of EEA1, generating an entropic collapse force that pulls the captured vesicle towards the target membrane to initiate docking and fusion.\n\nMurray, D.H., Jahnel, M., Lauer, J., Avellaneda, M.J., Brouilly, N., Cezanne, A., Morales-Navarrete.

It includes newly developed algorithms that address specific challenges of thick dense tissue reconstruction. Our implementation allows for a flexible workflow, scalable to high-throughput analysis and applicable to various mammalian tissues. We analysed liver tissue and extracted quantitative parameters of sinusoids, bile canaliculi and cell shapes, recognizing different liver cell types with high accuracy. We uncovered an unexpected zonation pattern of hepatocytes with different size, nuclei and DNA content, thus revealing new features of liver tissue organization.\n\nMorales-Navarrete, H., Segovia-Miranda, F., Klukowski, P., Meyer, K., Nonaka, H., Marsico, G., Chernykh, M., Kalaidzidis, A., Zerial M., Kalaidzidis Y.
