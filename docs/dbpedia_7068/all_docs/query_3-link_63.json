        "meta_description": "Abstract. Combined droughts and heatwaves are among those compound extreme events that induce severe impacts on the terrestrial biosphere and human health. A record breaking hot and dry compound event hit western Russia in summerÂ 2010 (Russian heatwave, RHW). Events of this kind are relevant from a hydrometeorological perspective, but are also interesting from a biospheric point of view because of their impacts on ecosystems, e.g., reductions in the terrestrial carbon storage. Integrating both perspectives might facilitate our knowledge about the RHW. We revisit the RHW from both a biospheric and a hydrometeorological perspective. We apply a recently developed multivariate anomaly detection approach to a set of hydrometeorological variables, and then to multiple biospheric variables relevant to describe the RHW. One main finding is that the extreme event identified in the hydrometeorological variables leads to multidirectional responses in biospheric variables, e.g., positive and negative anomalies in gross primary production (GPP). In particular, the region of reduced summer ecosystem production does not match the area identified as extreme in the hydrometeorological variables. The reason is that forest-dominated ecosystems in the higher latitudes respond with unusually high productivity to the RHW. Furthermore, the RHW was preceded by an anomalously warm spring, which leads annually integrated to a partial compensation of 54â% (36â% in the preceding spring, 18â% in summer) of the reduced GPP in southern agriculturally dominated ecosystems. Our results show that an ecosystem-specific and multivariate perspective on extreme events can reveal multiple facets of extreme events by simultaneously integrating several data streams irrespective of impact direction and the variables' domain. Our study exemplifies the need for robust multivariate analytic approaches to detect extreme events in both hydrometeorological conditions and associated biosphere responses to fully characterize the effects of extremes, including possible compensatory effects in space and time.",

We study the impact of droughts and heatwaves on the uptake of CO2 of different vegetation types at the global scale. We find that agricultural areas are generally strongly affected. Forests instead are not particularly sensitive to the events under scrutiny. This implies different water management strategies of forests but also a lack of sensitivity to remote-sensing-derived vegetation activity.\n\nMultivariate anomaly detection for Earth observations: a comparison of algorithms and feature extraction techniques\n\nMilan Flach, Fabian Gans, Alexander Brenning, Joachim Denzler, Markus Reichstein, Erik Rodner, Sebastian Bathiany, Paul Bodesheim, Yanira Guanche, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D.

The Earth system is highly multivariate. We compare eight multivariate anomaly detection algorithms and combinations of data preprocessing. We identify three anomaly detection algorithms that outperform univariate extreme event detection approaches. The workflows have the potential to reveal novelties in data. Remarks on their application to real Earth observations are provided.\n\nCautionary remarks on the planetary boundary visualisation\n\nMiguel D.

We identify three issues: exaggerated impact sizes, confusing color patterns, and inaccessibility for colour-vision deficiency. These flaws can lead to overstating risks. We suggest improving these visual elements for more accurate and accessible information for decision-makers.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Current perspectives on biosphere research – 2024\n\nFriedrich J.

They discuss recent findings in the context of global trade and international policy frameworks, and highlight lessons for local implementation of nature-based solutions.\n\nHow atmospheric CO2 can inform us on annual and decadal shifts in the biospheric carbon uptake period\n\nTheertha Kariyathan, Ana Bastos, Markus Reichstein, Wouter Peters, and Julia Marshall\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1382,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1382, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe carbon uptake period (CUP) refers to the time of the year when there is net absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere to the land. Several studies have assessed changes in CUP based on seasonal metrics from CO2 mole fraction measurements to understand the response of terrestrial biosphere to climate variations. However, we find that the CUP derived from CO2 mole fraction measurements are not likely to provide an accurate magnitude of the actual changes occurring over the surface.\n\nSpectralIndices.jl: Streamlining spectral indices access and computation for Earth system research\n\nFrancesco Martinuzzi, Miguel D.

Heat extremes are mostly introduced by large-scale atmospheric circulation but can be modulated by vegetation. Vegetation with access to water uses solar energy to evaporate water into the atmosphere. Under dry conditions, water may not be available, suppressing evaporation and heating the atmosphere. Using climate projections, we show that regionally less water is available for vegetation, intensifying future heat extremes.\n\nTextÂ mining uncovers the unique dynamics of socio-economic impacts of the 2018â2022 multi-year drought in Germany\n\nJan Sodoge, Christian Kuhlicke, Miguel D.

We derived a dataset covering the impacts of droughts in Germany between 2000 and 2022 on sectors such as agriculture and forestry based on newspaper articles. Notably, our study illustrated that the longer drought had a wider reach and more varied effects. We show that dealing with longer droughts requires different plans compared to shorter ones, and it is crucial to be ready for the challenges they bring.\n\nEarth Virtualization Engines (EVE)\n\nBjorn Stevens, Stefan Adami, Tariq Ali, Hartwig Anzt, Zafer Aslan, Sabine Attinger, Jaana BÃ¤ck, Johanna Baehr, Peter Bauer, Natacha Bernier, Bob Bishop, Hendryk Bockelmann, Sandrine Bony, Guy Brasseur, David N.

However, this behavior is poorly understood for soils. In this analysis, we test whether eddy covariance is able to measure the so-called adsorption of atmospheric water vapor by soils. We find that this flux occurs frequently during dry nights in a Mediterranean ecosystem, while EC detects downwardly directed vapor fluxes. These results can help to map moisture uptake globally.\n\nTechnical note: Flagging inconsistencies in flux tower data\n\nMartin Jung, Jacob Nelson, Mirco Migliavacca, Tarek El-Madany, Dario Papale, Markus Reichstein, Sophia Walther, and Thomas Wutzler\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1827–1846, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1827-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1827-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a methodology to detect inconsistencies in perhaps the most important data source for measurements of ecosystem–atmosphere carbon, water, and energy fluxes. We expect that the derived consistency flags will be relevant for data users and will help in improving our understanding of and our ability to model ecosystem–climate interactions.\n\nDeepPhenoMem V1.0: Deep learning modelling of canopy greenness dynamics accounting for multi-variate meteorological memory effects on vegetation phenology\n\nGuohua Liu, Mirco Migliavacca, Christian Reimers, Basil Kraft, Markus Reichstein, Andrew Richardson, Lisa Wingate, Nicolas Delpierre, Hui Yang, and Alexander Winkler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-464,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-464, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model canopy greenness and phenology, integrating meteorological memory effects. LSTM model outperforms traditional methods, enhancing accuracy in predicting greenness dynamics and phenological transitions across plant functional types. Highlighting the importance of multi-variate meteorological memory effects, our research pioneers unlocking the secrets of vegetation phenology responses to climate change with deep learning techniques.\n\nConstraining biospheric carbon dioxide fluxes by combined top-down and bottom-up approaches\n\nSamuel Upton, Markus Reichstein, Fabian Gans, Wouter Peters, Basil Kraft, and Ana Bastos\n\nAtmos.

To address this, we create a model with a dual constraint based on bottom-up eddy-covariance data and top-down atmospheric inversion data. Our model overcomes shortcomings of each approach, producing improved NEE estimates from local to global scale, helping to reduce uncertainty in the carbon budget.\n\nX-BASE: the first terrestrial carbon and water flux products from an extended data-driven scaling framework, FLUXCOM-X\n\nJacob A.

Here we outline a method to estimate global water and CO2 fluxes based on direct measurements from site around the world called FLUXCOM-X. We go on to demonstrate how these new estimates of net CO2 uptake/loss, gross CO2 uptake, total water evaporation, and transpiration from plants compare to previous and independent estimates.\n\nDrought counteracts soil warming more strongly in the subsoil than in the topsoil according to a vertical microbial SOC model\n\nMarleen Pallandt, Marion Schrumpf, Holger Lange, Markus Reichstein, Lin Yu, and Bernhard Ahrens\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-186,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-186, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs soils get warmer due to climate change, SOC decomposes faster because of higher microbial activity, but only with sufficient soil moisture. We modelled how microbes decompose plant litter and microbial residues at different soil depths. We found that deep soil layers are more sensitive than topsoils. SOC is lost from the soil with warming, but this can be mitigated or worsened depending on the type of litter and its sensitivity to temperature. Droughts can reduce warming-induced SOC losses.\n\nNitrogen Availability and Summer Drought, but not N:P Imbalance Drive Carbon Use Efficiency of a Mediterranean Tree-Grass Ecosystem\n\nRichard Nair, Yunpeng Luo, Tarek El-Madany, Victor Rolo, Javier Pacheco-Labrador, Silvia Caldararu, Kendalynn A. Morris, Marion Schrumpf, Arnaud Carrara, Gerardo Moreno, Markus Reichstein, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2434,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2434, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied a Mediterranean ecosystem to understand carbon uptake efficiency and its controls. These ecosystems face potential nitrogen-phosphorus imbalances due to pollution. Analysing six years of carbon data, we assessed controls at different timeframes. This is crucial for predicting such vulnerable regions. Our findings revealed N limitation on C uptake, not N:P imbalance, and strong influence of water availability. whether drought or wetness promoted net C uptake depended on timescale.\n\nLearning Extreme Vegetation Response to Climate Forcing: A Comparison of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures\n\nFrancesco Martinuzzi, Miguel D. Mahecha, Gustau Camps-Valls, David Montero, Tristan Williams, and Karin Mora\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2368,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2368, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated how machine learning can forecast extreme vegetation responses to weather. Examining four models, no single one stood out as the best, though \"echo state networks\" showed minor advantages. Our results indicate that while these tools are able to generally model vegetation states, they face challenges under extreme conditions. This underlines the potential of artificial intelligence in ecosystem modeling, also pinpointing areas that need further research.\n\nReducing errors on estimates of the carbon uptake period based on time series of atmospheric CO2\n\nTheertha Kariyathan, Ana Bastos, Julia Marshall, Wouter Peters, Pieter Tans, and Markus Reichstein\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 3299–3312, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3299-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3299-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe timing and duration of the carbon uptake period (CUP) are sensitive to the occurrence of major phenological events, which are influenced by recent climate change. This study presents an ensemble-based approach for quantifying the timing and duration of the CUP and their uncertainty when derived from atmospheric CO2 measurements with noise and gaps. The CUP metrics derived with the approach are more robust and have less uncertainty than when estimated with the conventional methods.\n\nDiagnosing modeling errors in global terrestrial water storage interannual variability\n\nHoontaek Lee, Martin Jung, Nuno Carvalhais, Tina Trautmann, Basil Kraft, Markus Reichstein, Matthias Forkel, and Sujan Koirala\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1531–1563, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1531-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1531-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe spatially attribute the variance in global terrestrial water storage (TWS) interannual variability (IAV) and its modeling error with two data-driven hydrological models. We find error hotspot regions that show a disproportionately large significance in the global mismatch and the association of the error regions with a smaller-scale lateral convergence of water. Our findings imply that TWS IAV modeling can be efficiently improved by focusing on model representations for the error hotspots.\n\nHuman influence on growing-period frosts like in early April 2021 in central France\n\nRobert Vautard, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, RÃ©my Bonnet, Sihan Li, Yoann Robin, Sarah Kew, Sjoukje Philip, Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, Brigitte Dubuisson, Nicolas Viovy, Markus Reichstein, Friederike Otto, and IÃ±aki Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1045–1058, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1045-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1045-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA deep frost occurred in early April 2021, inducing severe damages in grapevine and fruit trees in France. We found that such extreme frosts occurring after the start of the growing season such as those of April 2021 are currently about 2°C colder [0.5 °C to 3.3 °C] in observations than in preindustrial climate. This observed intensification of growing-period frosts is attributable, at least in part, to human-caused climate change, making the 2021 event 50 % more likely [10 %–110 %].\n\nAssessing uncertainties in landslide susceptibility predictions in a changing environment (Styrian Basin, Austria)\n\nRaphael Knevels, Helene Petschko, Herwig Proske, Philip Leopold, Aditya N. Mishra, Douglas Maraun, and Alexander Brenning\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 205–229, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-205-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-205-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn summer 2009 and 2014, rainfall events occurred in the Styrian Basin (Austria), triggering thousands of landslides. Landslide storylines help to show potential future changes under changing environmental conditions. The often neglected uncertainty quantification was the aim of this study. We found uncertainty arising from the landslide model to be of the same order as climate scenario uncertainty. Understanding the dimensions of uncertainty is crucial for allowing informed decision-making.\n\nResolving seasonal and diel dynamics of non-rainfall water inputs in a Mediterranean ecosystem using lysimeters\n\nSinikka Jasmin Paulus, Tarek Sebastian El-Madany, RenÃ© Orth, Anke Hildebrandt, Thomas Wutzler, Arnaud Carrara, Gerardo Moreno, Oscar Perez-Priego, Olaf Kolle, Markus Reichstein, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6263–6287, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6263-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6263-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we analyze small inputs of water to ecosystems such as fog, dew, and adsorption of vapor. To measure them, we use a scaling system and later test our attribution of different water fluxes to weight changes. We found that they occur frequently during 1 year in a dry summer ecosystem. In each season, a different flux seems dominant, but they all mainly occur during the night. Therefore, they could be important for the biosphere because rain is unevenly distributed over the year.\n\nTransfer learning for landslide susceptibility modeling using domain adaptation and case-based reasoning\n\nZhihao Wang, Jason Goetz, and Alexander Brenning\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8765–8784, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8765-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8765-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA lack of inventory data can be a limiting factor in developing landslide predictive models, which are crucial for supporting hazard policy and decision-making. We show how case-based reasoning and domain adaptation (transfer-learning techniques) can effectively retrieve similar landslide modeling situations for prediction in new data-scarce areas. Using cases in Italy, Austria, and Ecuador, our findings support the application of transfer learning for areas that require rapid model development.\n\nInterannual global carbon cycle variations linked to atmospheric circulation variability\n\nNa Li, Sebastian Sippel, Alexander J. Winkler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Markus Reichstein, and Ana Bastos\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1505–1533, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the imprint of large-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics and associated carbon cycle responses is key to improving our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics. Using a statistical model that relies on spatiotemporal sea level pressure as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric circulation, we quantify the fraction of interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the land CO2 sink that are driven by atmospheric circulation variability.\n\nExploring the relationship between temperature forecast errors and Earth system variables\n\nMelissa Ruiz-VÃ¡squez, Sungmin O, Alexander Brenning, Randal D. Koster, Gianpaolo Balsamo, Ulrich Weber, Gabriele Arduini, Ana Bastos, Markus Reichstein, and RenÃ© Orth\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1451–1471, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1451-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1451-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSubseasonal forecasts facilitate early warning of extreme events; however their predictability sources are not fully explored. We find that global temperature forecast errors in many regions are related to climate variables such as solar radiation and precipitation, as well as land surface variables such as soil moisture and evaporative fraction. A better representation of these variables in the forecasting and data assimilation systems can support the accuracy of temperature forecasts.\n\nContrasting drought legacy effects on gross primary productivity in a mixed versus pure beech forest\n\nXin Yu, RenÃ© Orth, Markus Reichstein, Michael Bahn, Anne Klosterhalfen, Alexander Knohl, Franziska Koebsch, Mirco Migliavacca, Martina Mund, Jacob A. Nelson, Benjamin D. Stocker, Sophia Walther, and Ana Bastos\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4315–4329, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4315-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4315-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIdentifying drought legacy effects is challenging because they are superimposed on variability driven by climate conditions in the recovery period. We develop a residual-based approach to quantify legacies on gross primary productivity (GPP) from eddy covariance data. The GPP reduction due to legacy effects is comparable to the concurrent effects at two sites in Germany, which reveals the importance of legacy effects. Our novel methodology can be used to quantify drought legacies elsewhere.\n\nSPECTRAL: AWESOME SPECTRAL INDICES DEPLOYED VIA THE GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE JAVASCRIPT API\n\nD. Montero, C. Aybar, M. D.

In the international research and policy community it is recognised that risk management could benefit from a more systemic approach. In this perspective paper, we argue for an approach that addresses multi-hazard, multi-risk management through the lens of sustainability challenges that cut across sectors, regions, and hazards.\n\nTowards hybrid modeling of the global hydrological cycle\n\nBasil Kraft, Martin Jung, Marco KÃ¶rner, Sujan Koirala, and Markus Reichstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1579–1614, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1579-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1579-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a physics-aware machine learning model of the global hydrological cycle. As the model uses neural networks under the hood, the simulations of the water cycle are learned from data, and yet they are informed and constrained by physical knowledge. The simulated patterns lie within the range of existing hydrological models and are plausible. The hybrid modeling approach has the potential to tackle key environmental questions from a novel perspective.\n\nEVALUATING THE POTENTIAL OF DESIS TO INFER PLANT TAXONOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITIES IN EUROPEAN FORESTS\n\nJ.

McGuire, Sungmin O, Julia Pongratz, and Stephen Sitch\n\nEarth Syst.

However, these conditions may become more frequent in the coming decades. Because stress conditions can leave legacies for many years, this may result in reduced ecosystem resilience under recurrent stress. We assess vegetation vulnerability to the hot and dry summers in 2018 and 2019 in Europe and find the important role of inter-annual legacy effects from 2018 in modulating the impacts of the 2019 event.\n\nOptimizing and validating the Gravitational Process Path model for regional debris-flow runout modelling\n\nJason Goetz, Robin Kohrs, Eric Parra HormazÃ¡bal, Manuel Bustos Morales, MarÃ­a BelÃ©n Araneda Riquelme, CristiÃ¡n HenrÃ­quez, and Alexander Brenning\n\nNat.

Using the Andes of Santiago as an example, we developed tools to finetune and validate models predicting likely runout paths over large regions. We anticipate that our automated approach that links the open-source R software with SAGA-GIS will make debris-flow runout simulation more readily accessible and thus enable researchers and spatial planners to improve regional-scale hazard assessments.\n\nFunctional convergence of biosphereâatmosphere interactions in response to meteorological conditions\n\nChristopher Krich, Mirco Migliavacca, Diego G. Miralles, Guido Kraemer, Tarek S. El-Madany, Markus Reichstein, Jakob Runge, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2379–2404, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2379-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2379-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEcosystems and the atmosphere interact with each other. These interactions determine e.g. the water and carbon fluxes and thus are crucial to understand climate change effects. We analysed the interactions for many ecosystems across the globe, showing that very different ecosystems can have similar interactions with the atmosphere. Meteorological conditions seem to be the strongest interaction-shaping factor. This means that common principles can be identified to describe ecosystem behaviour.\n\nVegetation modulates the impact of climate extremes on gross primary production\n\nMilan Flach, Alexander Brenning, Fabian Gans, Markus Reichstein, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 39–53, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought and heat events affect the uptake and sequestration of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. We study the impact of droughts and heatwaves on the uptake of CO2 of different vegetation types at the global scale. We find that agricultural areas are generally strongly affected. Forests instead are not particularly sensitive to the events under scrutiny. This implies different water management strategies of forests but also a lack of sensitivity to remote-sensing-derived vegetation activity.\n\nApparent ecosystem carbon turnover time: uncertainties and robust features\n\nNaixin Fan, Sujan Koirala, Markus Reichstein, Martin Thurner, Valerio Avitabile, Maurizio Santoro, Bernhard Ahrens, Ulrich Weber, and Nuno Carvalhais\n\nEarth Syst.

In this study, we provide a new, updated ensemble of diagnostic terrestrial carbon turnover times and associated uncertainties on a global scale. Despite the large variation in both magnitude and spatial patterns of τ, we identified robust features in the spatial patterns of τ which could contribute to uncertainty reductions in future projections of the carbon cycleâclimate feedback.\n\nHYBRID MODELING: FUSION OF A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH AND A PHYSICS-BASED MODEL FOR GLOBAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELING\n\nB.

In this study, we analyze how different climate variables affect the timing when CO2 uptake is at a maximum (DOYGPPmax). We found that the joint effects of radiation, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most relevant controlling factors of DOYGPPmax and that if they increase, DOYGPPmax will happen earlier. These results help us to better understand how CO2 uptake could be affected by climate change.\n\nLarge-scale biospheric drought response intensifies linearly with drought duration in arid regions\n\nRenÃ© Orth, Georgia Destouni, Martin Jung, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2647–2656, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2647-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2647-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought duration is a key control of the large-scale biospheric drought response. Thereby, the vegetation responds linearly to drought duration at large spatial scales. The slope of the linear relationship between the vegetation drought response and drought duration is steeper in drier climates.\n\nSummarizing the state of the terrestrial biosphere in few dimensions\n\nGuido Kraemer, Gustau Camps-Valls, Markus Reichstein, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2397–2424, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo closely monitor the state of our planet, we require systems that can monitor the observation of many different properties at the same time. We create indicators that resemble the behavior of many different simultaneous observations. We apply the method to create indicators representing the Earth's biosphere. The indicators show a productivity gradient and a water gradient. The resulting indicators can detect a large number of changes and extremes in the Earth system.\n\nScaling carbon fluxes from eddy covariance sites to globe: synthesis and evaluation of the FLUXCOM approach\n\nMartin Jung, Christopher Schwalm, Mirco Migliavacca, Sophia Walther, Gustau Camps-Valls, Sujan Koirala, Peter Anthoni, Simon Besnard, Paul Bodesheim, Nuno Carvalhais, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, Fabian Gans, Daniel S.

We show that we can reproduce seasonal variations in carbon assimilated by plants via photosynthesis and in ecosystem net carbon balance. The ecosystemâs mean carbon balance and carbon flux trends require cautious interpretation. The analysis paves the way for future improvements of the data-driven assessment of carbon fluxes.\n\nEstimating causal networks in biosphereâatmosphere interaction with the PCMCI approach\n\nChristopher Krich, Jakob Runge, Diego G.

To understand the behaviour of a specific method on such data, we used artificial and observation-based data. The observed structures are very interpretable and reveal certain ecosystem-specific behaviour, as only a few relevant links remain, in contrast to pure correlation techniques. Thus, causal inference allows to us gain well-constrained insights into processes and interactions.\n\nEarth system data cubes unravel global multivariate dynamics\n\nMiguel D.

However, researching a data-rich world brings novel challenges. We present the concept of Earth system data cubes to study the complex dynamics of multiple climate and ecosystem variables across space and time. Using a series of example studies, we highlight the potential of effectively considering the full multivariate nature of processes in the Earth system.\n\nTowards a global understanding of vegetationâclimate dynamics at multiple timescales\n\nNora Linscheid, Lina M. Estupinan-Suarez, Alexander Brenning, Nuno Carvalhais, Felix Cremer, Fabian Gans, Anja Rammig, Markus Reichstein, Carlos A. Sierra, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 945–962, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation typically responds to variation in temperature and rainfall within days. Yet seasonal changes in meteorological conditions, as well as decadal climate variability, additionally shape the state of ecosystems. It remains unclear how vegetation responds to climate variability on these different timescales. We find that the vegetation response to climate variability depends on the timescale considered. This scale dependency should be considered for modeling land–atmosphere interactions.\n\nCombining hyperspectral remote sensing and eddy covariance data streams for estimation of vegetation functional traits\n\nJavier Pacheco-Labrador, Tarek S.

This information, nowadays missing, is fundamental to improve our understanding and prediction of carbon and water cycles, and therefore to anticipate effects and responses to Climate Change. In this manuscript we propose a method to exploit the data provided by these satellites to successfully obtain this information key to face Climate Change.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Turning the challenges of partitioning ecosystem evaporation and transpiration into opportunities\n\nPaul C.

Nelson, Rafael Poyatos, Markus Reichstein, Russell L. Scott, and Sebastian Wolf\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3747–3775, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3747-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3747-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKey findings are the nearly optimal response of T to atmospheric water vapor pressure deficits across methods and scales. Additionally, the notion that T / ET intermittently approaches 1, which is a basis for many partitioning methods, does not hold for certain methods and ecosystems. To better constrain estimates of E and T from combined ET measurements, we propose a combination of independent measurement techniques to better constrain E and T at the ecosystem scale.\n\nCarbonâwater flux coupling under progressive drought\n\nSven Boese, Martin Jung, Nuno Carvalhais, Adriaan J. Teuling, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 2557–2572, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2557-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2557-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines how limited water availability during droughts affects water-use efficiency. This metric describes how much carbon an ecosystem can assimilate for each unit of water lost by transpiration. We test how well different water-use efficiency models can capture the dynamics of transpiration decrease due to increased soil-water limitation. Accounting for the interacting effects of radiation and water limitation is necessary to accurately predict transpiration during these periods.\n\nN : P stoichiometry and habitat effects on Mediterranean savanna seasonal root dynamics\n\nRichard K. F. Nair, Kendalynn A. Morris, Martin Hertel, Yunpeng Luo, Gerardo Moreno, Markus Reichstein, Marion Schrumpf, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 1883–1901, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1883-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1883-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated how nutrient availability affects seasonal timing of root growth and death in a Spanish savanna, adapted to a long summer drought. We found that nitrogen (N) additions led to more root biomass but number of roots was higher with N and phosphorus together. These effects were strongly affected by the time of year. In autumn root growth occurred after leaf production. This has implications for how we understand biomass production and carbon uptake in these systems.\n\nGlobal variability of carbon use efficiency in terrestrial ecosystems\n\nXiaolu Tang, Nuno Carvalhais, Catarina Moura, Bernhard Ahrens, Sujan Koirala, Shaohui Fan, Fengying Guan, Wenjie Zhang, Sicong Gao, Vincenzo Magliulo, Pauline Buysse, Shibin Liu, Guo Chen, Wunian Yang, Zhen Yu, Jingjing Liang, Leilei Shi, Shenyan Pu, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-37,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-37, 2019\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation CUE is a key measure of carbon transfer from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass. This study modelled global CUE with published observations using random forest. CUE varied with ecosystem types and spatially decreased with latitude, challenging the previous conclusion that CUE was independent of environmental controls. Our results emphasize a better understanding of environmental controls on CUE to reduce uncertainties in prognostic land-process model simulations.\n\nEvaluating the destabilization susceptibility of active rock glaciers in the French Alps\n\nMarco Marcer, Charlie Serrano, Alexander Brenning, Xavier Bodin, Jason Goetz, and Philippe Schoeneich\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 141–155, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-141-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-141-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study aims to assess the occurrence of rock glacier destabilization in the French Alps, a process that causes a landslide-like behaviour of permafrost debris slopes. A significant number of the landforms in the region were found to be experiencing destabilization. Multivariate analysis suggested a link between destabilization occurrence and permafrost thaw induced by climate warming. These results call for a regional characterization of permafrost hazards in the context of climate change.\n\nBasic and extensible post-processing of eddy covariance flux data with REddyProc\n\nThomas Wutzler, Antje Lucas-Moffat, Mirco Migliavacca, JÃ¼rgen Knauer, Kerstin Sickel, Ladislav Å igut, Olaf Menzer, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5015–5030, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5015-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5015-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNet fluxes of carbon dioxide at the ecosystem level measured by eddy covariance are a main source for understanding biosphere–atmosphere interactions. However, there is a need for more usable and extensible tools for post-processing steps of the half-hourly flux data. Therefore, we developed the REddyProc package, providing data filtering, gap filling, and flux partitioning. The extensible functions are compatible with state-of-the-art tools but allow easier integration in extended analysis.\n\nUpscaled diurnal cycles of landâatmosphere fluxes: a new global half-hourly data product\n\nPaul Bodesheim, Martin Jung, Fabian Gans, Miguel D. Mahecha, and Markus Reichstein\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 1327–1365, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1327-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1327-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide continuous half-hourly carbon and energy fluxes for 2001 to 2014 at 0.5Â° spatial resolution, which allows for analyzing diurnal cycles globally. The data set contains four fluxes: gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent heat (LE), and sensible heat (H). In addition, we provide a derived product that only contains monthly average diurnal cycles but which also enables us to study the important characteristics of subdaily patterns at a global scale.\n\nWater-stress-induced breakdown of carbonâwater relations: indicators from diurnal FLUXNET patterns\n\nJacob A. Nelson, Nuno Carvalhais, Mirco Migliavacca, Markus Reichstein, and Martin Jung\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 2433–2447, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2433-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2433-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlants have typical daily carbon uptake and water loss cycles. However, these cycles may change under periods of duress, such as water limitation. Here we identify two types of patterns in response to water limitations: a tendency to lose more water in the morning than afternoon and a decoupling of the carbon and water cycles. The findings show differences in responses by trees and grasses and suggest that morning shifts may be more efficient at gaining carbon per unit water used.\n\nImpacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones\n\nJannis von Buttlar, Jakob Zscheischler, Anja Rammig, Sebastian Sippel, Markus Reichstein, Alexander Knohl, Martin Jung, Olaf Menzer, M.

Scott, Francesco P. Vaccari, Eva van Gorsel, Andrej Varlagin, Georg Wohlfahrt, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1293–1318, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work systematically quantifies extreme heat and drought event impacts on gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration globally across a wide range of ecosystems. We show that heat extremes typically increased mainly respiration whereas drought decreased both fluxes. Combined heat and drought extremes had opposing effects offsetting each other for respiration, but there were also strong reductions in GPP and hence the strongest reductions in the ecosystems carbon sink capacity.\n\nGross changes in forest area shape the future carbon balance of tropical forests\n\nWei Li, Philippe Ciais, Chao Yue, Thomas Gasser, Shushi Peng, and Ana Bastos\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 91–103, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-91-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-91-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared the biomass recovery curves from a recent field-based study with those used in bookkeeping models and demonstrated the importance of considering gross forest changes rather than net forest changes. We also derived a critical gross-to-net forest area change ratio, beyond which the sign of carbon flux will be reversed. This critical ratio was further applied to the high-resolution satellite data in the Amazon to distinguish the sensitive regions.\n\nReverse engineering model structures for soil and ecosystem respiration: the potential of gene expression programming\n\nIulia Ilie, Peter Dittrich, Nuno Carvalhais, Martin Jung, Andreas Heinemeyer, Mirco Migliavacca, James I. L. Morison, Sebastian Sippel, Jens-Arne Subke, Matthew Wilkinson, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nGeosci.

The increase in available data allows for new approaches in their modelling. We automatically developed models for ecosystem and soil carbon respiration using a machine learning approach. When compared with established respiration models, we found that they are better in prediction as well as offering new insights.\n\nDetecting impacts of extreme events with ecological inÂ situ monitoring networks\n\nMiguel D.

A key challenge was to consistently combining observational products of terrestrial and aquatic surfaces. Our primary goal is to identify todayâs key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that would need to be addressed in future measurement campaigns or expansions of in situ observatories.\n\nMultivariate anomaly detection for Earth observations: a comparison of algorithms and feature extraction techniques\n\nMilan Flach, Fabian Gans, Alexander Brenning, Joachim Denzler, Markus Reichstein, Erik Rodner, Sebastian Bathiany, Paul Bodesheim, Yanira Guanche, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 677–696, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnomalies and extremes are often detected using univariate peak-over-threshold approaches in the geoscience community. The Earth system is highly multivariate. We compare eight multivariate anomaly detection algorithms and combinations of data preprocessing. We identify three anomaly detection algorithms that outperform univariate extreme event detection approaches. The workflows have the potential to reveal novelties in data. Remarks on their application to real Earth observations are provided.\n\nThe importance of radiation for semiempirical water-use efficiency models\n\nSven Boese, Martin Jung, Nuno Carvalhais, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3015–3026, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3015-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3015-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor plants, the ratio of carbon uptake to water loss by transpiration is usually thought to depend on characteristic properties (their adaption to water scarcity) and the dryness of the atmosphere at any given moment. We show that, on the ecosystem scale, radiation has an independent effect on this ratio that had not been previously considered. When including this variable in models, predictions of transpiration improve considerably.\n\nRefining multi-model projections of temperature extremes by evaluation against land–atmosphere coupling diagnostics\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Rene Orth, Markus Reichstein, Martha Vogel, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 387–403, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study (1) evaluates land–atmosphere coupling in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble against an ensemble of benchmarking datasets and (2) refines the model ensemble using a land–atmosphere coupling diagnostic as constraint. Our study demonstrates that a considerable fraction of coupled climate models overemphasize warm-season moisture-limited climate regimes in midlatitude regions. This leads to biases in daily-scale temperature extremes, which are alleviated in a constrained ensemble.\n\nPermafrost distribution modelling in the semi-arid Chilean Andes\n\nGuillermo F. AzÃ³car, Alexander Brenning, and Xavier Bodin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 877–890, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-877-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-877-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present in this work a new statistical permafrost distribution model that provided a more detailed, locally adjusted insights into mountain permafrost distribution in the semi-arid Chilean Andes. The results indicate conditions favorable for permafrost presence, can be present in up to about 6.8 % of the study area (1051 km2), especially in the Elqui and Huasco watersheds. This kind of methodological approach used in this research can be replicable in another parts of the Andes.\n\nHave precipitation extremes and annual totals been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60Â years?\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Martin Heimann, Holger Lange, Miguel D. Mahecha, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike E. L. Otto, and Markus Reichstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 441–458, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-441-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-441-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper re-investigates the question whether observed precipitation extremes and annual totals have been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60 years. Despite recently postulated increasing trends, we demonstrate that large uncertainties prevail due to (1) the choice of dryness definition and (2) statistical data processing. In fact, we find only minor (and only some significant) increases if (1) dryness is based on aridity and (2) statistical artefacts are accounted for.\n\nThe propagation of inventory-based positional errors into statistical landslide susceptibility models\n\nStefan Steger, Alexander Brenning, Rainer Bell, and Thomas Glade\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 16, 2729–2745, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2729-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2729-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the propagation of landslide inventory-based positional errors into statistical landslide susceptibility models by artificially introducing such spatial inaccuracies. The findings highlight that (i) an increasing positional error is related to increasing distortions of modelling and validation results, (ii) interrelations between inventory-based errors and modelling results are complex, and (iii) inventory-based errors can be counteracted by adapting the study design.\n\nPredicting carbon dioxide and energy fluxes across global FLUXNET sites with regression algorithms\n\nGianluca Tramontana, Martin Jung, Christopher R.

Obtained results have shown high consistency among ML and high capability to estimate the spatial and seasonal variability of the target fluxes. The results were good for all the ecosystems, with limitations to the ones in the extreme environments (cold, hot) or less represented in the training data (tropics).\n\nA novel bias correction methodology for climate impact simulations\n\nS.

The methodology considerably improves the representation of extremes in climatic variables relative to conventional bias correction strategies. Illustrative simulations of biosphere–atmosphere carbon and water fluxes with a biosphere model (LPJmL) show that the novel technique can be usefully applied to drive climate impact models.\n\nSun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and photochemical reflectance index improve remote-sensing gross primary production estimates under varying nutrient availability in a typical Mediterranean savanna ecosystem\n\nO.

Meteo-driven models (MMs) were unable to describe nutrient-induced effects on GPP. Important implications can be derived from these results, and uncertainties in the prediction of global GPP still remain when MMs do not account for plant nutrient availability.\n\nGlobal spatiotemporal distribution of soil respiration modeled using a global database\n\nS.

In this study, landslide initiation frequency along interurban highways was investigated in the Ecuadorian Andes across different climates. Using statistical models, landslides were found to be about 20 times more likely to occur in close proximity to highways compared to areas in 200m distance from highways while accounting for other environmental factors. Road effects appear to be enhanced in some geological units.\n\nCurrent systematic carbon-cycle observations and the need for implementing a policy-relevant carbon observing system\n\nP. Ciais, A. J.

We focus on three nesting bird species and the islets they select as refuges from their main predator, the Arctic fox. A geomorphological process, ice-wedge polygon degradation, was found to play a key role in creating these refuges. This process is likely to affect predator–prey dynamics in the Arctic tundra, highlighting the connections between nature's physical and ecological systems.\n\nDistinguishing mature and immature trees allows estimating forest carbon uptake from stand structure\n\nSamuel M. Fischer, Xugao Wang, and Andreas Huth\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 3305–3319, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3305-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3305-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding the drivers of forest productivity is key for accurately assessing forests’ role in the global carbon cycle. Yet, despite significant research effort, it is not fully understood how the productivity of a forest can be deduced from its stand structure. We suggest tackling this problem by identifying the share and structure of immature trees within forests and show that this approach could significantly improve estimates of forests’ net productivity and carbon uptake.\n\nâBloomingâ of litter-mixing effects: the role of flower and leaf litter interactions on decomposition in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems\n\nMery Ingrid GuimarÃ£es de Alencar, Rafael D. Guariento, Bertrand Guenet, Luciana S. Carneiro, Eduardo L. Voigt, and Adriano Caliman\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 3165–3182, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3165-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3165-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlowers are ephemeral organs for reproduction, and their litter is functionally different from leaf litter. Flowers can affect decomposition and interact with leaf litter, influencing decomposition non-additively. We show that mixing flower and leaf litter from the Tabebuia aurea tree creates reciprocal synergistic effects on decomposition in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. We highlight that flower litter input can generate biogeochemical hotspots in terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nFrom simple labels to semantic image segmentation: leveraging citizen science plant photographs for tree species mapping in drone imagery\n\nSalim Soltani, Olga Ferlian, Nico Eisenhauer, Hannes Feilhauer, and Teja Kattenborn\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2909–2935, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2909-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2909-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this research, we developed a novel method using citizen science data as alternative training data for computer vision models to map plant species in unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) images. We use citizen science plant photographs to train models and apply them to UAV images. We tested our approach on UAV images of a test site with 10 different tree species, yielding accurate results. This research shows the potential of citizen science data to advance our ability to monitor plant species.\n\nPlant functional traits modulate the effects of soil acidification on above- and belowground biomass\n\nXue Feng, Ruzhen Wang, Tianpeng Li, Jiangping Cai, Heyong Liu, Hui Li, and Yong Jiang\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2641–2653, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2641-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2641-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlant functional traits have been considered as reflecting adaptations to environmental variations, indirectly affecting ecosystem productivity. How soil acidification affects above- and belowground biomass by altering leaf and root traits remains poorly understood. We found divergent trait responses driven by soil environmental conditions in two dominant species, resulting in a decrease in aboveground biomass and an increase in belowground biomass.\n\nRegional effects and local climate jointly shape the global distribution of sexual systems in woody flowering plants\n\nMinhua Zhang, Xiaoqing Hu, and Fangliang He\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2133–2142, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2133-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2133-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlant sexual systems are important to understanding the evolution and maintenance of plant diversity. We quantified region effects on their proportions while incorporating local climate factors and evolutionary history. We found regional processes and climate effects both play important roles in shaping the geographic distribution of sexual systems, providing a baseline for predicting future changes in forest communities in the context of global change.\n\nIdeas and perspectives: Sensing energy and matter fluxes in a biota-dominated Patagonian landscape through environmental seismology â introducing the PumalÃ­n Critical Zone Observatory\n\nChristian H. Mohr, Michael Dietze, Violeta Tolorza, Erwin Gonzalez, Benjamin Sotomayor, Andres Iroume, Sten Gilfert, and Frieder Tautz\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1583–1599, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1583-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1583-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal temperate rainforests, among Earth’s carbon richest biomes, are systematically underrepresented in the global network of critical zone observatories (CZOs). Introducing here a first CZO in the heart of the Patagonian rainforest, Chile, we investigate carbon sink functioning, biota-driven landscape evolution, fluxes of matter and energy, and disturbance regimes. We invite the community to join us in cross-disciplinary collaboration to advance science in this particular environment.\n\nComparison of carbon and water fluxes and the drivers of ecosystem water use efficiency in a temperate rainforest and a peatland in southern South America\n\nJorge F. Perez-Quezada, David Trejo, Javier Lopatin, David Aguilera, Bruce Osborne, Mauricio Galleguillos, Luca Zattera, Juan L. Celis-Diez, and Juan J. Armesto\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1371–1389, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1371-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1371-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor 8 years we sampled a temperate rainforest and a peatland in Chile to estimate their efficiency to capture carbon per unit of water lost. The efficiency is more related to the water lost than to the carbon captured and is mainly driven by evaporation instead of transpiration. This is the first report from southern South America and highlights that ecosystems might behave differently in this area, likely explained by the high annual precipitation (~ 2100 mm) and light-limited conditions.\n\nLeaf habit and nutrient availability drive leaf nutrient resorption globally\n\nGabriela Sophia, Silvia Caldararu, Benjamin Stocker, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-687,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-687, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThrough an extensive global dataset of leaf nutrient resorption and a multifactorial analysis, we show that the majority of spatial variation in nutrient resorption may be driven by leaf habit and type, with thicker, longer-lived leaves having lower resorption efficiencies. Climate, soil fertility and soil-related factors emerge as strong drivers with an additional effect in its role. These results are essential for comprehending plant nutrient status, plant productivity and nutrient cycling.\n\nKilometre-scale simulations over Fennoscandia reveal a large loss of tundra due to climate warming\n\nFredrik Lagergren, Robert G. BjÃ¶rk, Camilla Andersson, Danijel BeluÅ¡iÄ, Mats P. BjÃ¶rkman, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Petter Lind, David Lindstedt, Tinja Olenius, HÃ¥kan Pleijel, Gunhild Rosqvist, and Paul A. Miller\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1093–1116, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1093-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1093-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Fennoscandian boreal and mountain regions harbour a wide range of ecosystems sensitive to climate change. A new, highly resolved high-emission climate scenario enabled modelling of the vegetation development in this region at high resolution for the 21st century. The results show dramatic south to north and low- to high-altitude shifts of vegetation zones, especially for the open tundra environments, which will have large implications for nature conservation, reindeer husbandry and forestry.\n\nBiomass Yield Potential, Feedstock Quality, and Nutrient Removal of Perennial Buffer Strips under Continuous Zero Fertilizer Application\n\nCheng-Hsien Lin, Colleen Zumpf, Chunhwa Jang, Thomas Voigt, Guanglong Tian, Olawale Oladeji, Albert Cox, Rehnuma Mehzabin, and Do Kyoung Lee\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-203,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-203, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRiparian areas are subject to environmental issues (nutrient leaching) associated with low productivity. Perennial grasses can improve ecosystem services from riparian zones while producing forage/bioenergy feedstock biomass, as potential income for farmers. In this study, the forage-type buffer can be an ideal short-term candidate due to its great efficiency of nutrient scavenging; the bioenergy-type showed better sustainability than the forage buffer and a continuous yield supply potential.\n\nMicroclimate mapping using novel radiative transfer modelling\n\nFlorian Zellweger, Eric Sulmoni, Johanna T. Malle, Andri Baltensweiler, Tobias Jonas, Niklaus E. Zimmermann, Christian Ginzler, Dirk Nikolaus Karger, Pieter De Frenne, David Frey, and Clare Webster\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 605–623, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-605-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-605-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe microclimatic conditions experienced by organisms living close to the ground are not well represented in currently used climate datasets derived from weather stations. Therefore, we measured and mapped ground microclimate temperatures at 10 m spatial resolution across Switzerland using a novel radiation model. Our results reveal a high variability in microclimates across different habitats and will help to better understand climate and land use impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nRoot distributions predict shrubâsteppe responses to precipitation intensity\n\nAndrew Kulmatiski, Martin C. Holdrege, Cristina ChirvasÄ, and Karen H. Beard\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 131–143, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-131-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-131-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWarmer air and larger precipitation events are changing the way water moves through the soil and into plants. Here we show that detailed descriptions of root distributions can predict plant growth responses to changing precipitation patterns. Shrubs and forbs increased growth, while grasses showed no response to increased precipitation intensity, and these responses were predicted by plant rooting distributions.\n\nThermophilisation of Afromontane forest stands demonstrated in an elevation gradient experiment\n\nBonaventure Ntirugulirwa, Etienne Zibera, Nkuba Epaphrodite, Aloysie Manishimwe, Donat Nsabimana, Johan Uddling, and GÃ¶ran Wallin\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 5125–5149, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-5125-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-5125-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwenty tropical tree species native to Africa were planted along an elevation gradient (1100 m, 5.4 °C difference). We found that early-successional (ES) species, especially from lower elevations, grew faster at warmer sites, while several of the late-successional (LS) species, especially from higher elevations, did not respond or grew slower. Moreover, a warmer climate increased tree mortality in LS species, but not much in ES species.\n\nSoil smoldering in temperate forests: A neglected contributor to fire carbon emissions revealed by atmospheric mixing ratios\n\nLilian Vallet, Charbel Abdallah, Thomas Lauvaux, Lilian Joly, Michel Ramonet, Philippe Ciais, Morgan Lopez, IrÃ¨ne Xueref-Remy, and Florent Mouillot\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2421,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2421, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\n2022 fire season had a huge impact on European temperate forest, with several large fires exhibiting prolonged soil combustion reported. We analyzed CO and CO2 concentration recorded at nearby atmospheric towers, revealing intense smoldering combustion. We refined a fire emission model to incorporate this process. We estimated 7.95 MteqCO2 fire emission, twice the global estimate. Fires contributed to 1.97 % of the country's annual carbon footprint, reducing forest carbon sink by 30 % this year.\n\nAbove-treeline ecosystems facing drought: lessons from the 2022 European summer heat wave\n\nPhilippe Choler\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4259–4272, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4259-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4259-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe year 2022 was unique in that the summer heat wave and drought led to a widespread reduction in vegetation growth at high elevation in the European Alps. This impact was unprecedented in the southwestern, warm, and dry part of the Alps. Over the last 2 decades, water has become a co-dominant control of vegetation activity in areas that were, so far, primarily controlled by temperature, and the growth of mountain grasslands has become increasingly sensitive to moisture availability.\n\nCanopy gaps and associated losses of biomass â combining UAV imagery and field data in a central Amazon forest\n\nAdriana Simonetti, Raquel Fernandes Araujo, Carlos Henrique Souza Celes, FlÃ¡via Ranara da Silva e Silva, Joaquim dos Santos, Niro Higuchi, Susan Trumbore, and Daniel Magnabosco Marra\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3651–3666, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3651-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3651-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combined 2 years of monthly drone-acquired RGB (red–green–blue) imagery with field surveys in a central Amazon forest. Our results indicate that small gaps associated with branch fall were the most frequent. Biomass losses were partially controlled by gap area, with branch fall and snapping contributing the least and greatest relative values, respectively. Our study highlights the potential of drone images for monitoring canopy dynamics in dense tropical forests.\n\nIdeas and perspectives: Beyond model evaluation â combining experiments and models to advance terrestrial ecosystem science\n\nSilvia Caldararu, Victor Rolo, Benjamin D. Stocker, Teresa E. Gimeno, and Richard Nair\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3637–3649, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3637-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3637-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEcosystem manipulative experiments are large experiments in real ecosystems. They include processes such as species interactions and weather that would be omitted in more controlled settings. They offer a high level of realism but are underused in combination with vegetation models used to predict the response of ecosystems to global change. We propose a workflow using models and ecosystem experiments together, taking advantage of the benefits of both tools for Earth system understanding.\n\nPrimary succession and its driving variables â a sphere-spanning approach applied in proglacial areas in the upper Martell Valley (Eastern Italian Alps)\n\nKatharina Ramskogler, Bettina Knoflach, Bernhard Elsner, Brigitta Erschbamer, Florian Haas, Tobias Heckmann, Florentin Hofmeister, Livia Piermattei, Camillo Ressl, Svenja Trautmann, Michael H. Wimmer, Clemens Geitner, Johann StÃ¶tter, and Erich Tasser\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2919–2939, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2919-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2919-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrimary succession in proglacial areas depends on complex driving forces. To concretise the complex effects and interaction processes, 39 known explanatory variables assigned to seven spheres were analysed via principal component analysis and generalised additive models. Key results show that in addition to time- and elevation-dependent factors, also disturbances alter vegetation development. The results are useful for debates on vegetation development in a warming climate.\n\nContemporary biodiversity pattern is affected by climate change at multiple temporal scales in steppes on the Mongolian Plateau\n\nZijing Li, Zhiyong Li, Xuze Tong, Lei Dong, Ying Zheng, Jinghui Zhang, Bailing Miao, Lixin Wang, Liqing Zhao, Lu Wen, Guodong Han, Frank Yonghong Li, and Cunzhu Liang\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2869–2882, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2869-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2869-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used random forest models and structural equation models to assess the relative importance of the present climate and paleoclimate as determinants of diversity and aboveground biomass. Results showed that paleoclimate changes and modern climate jointly determined contemporary biodiversity patterns, while community biomass was mainly affected by modern climate. These findings suggest that contemporary biodiversity patterns may be affected by processes at divergent temporal scales.\n\nQuantifying vegetation indices using terrestrial laser scanning: methodological complexities and ecological insights from a Mediterranean forest\n\nWilliam Rupert Moore Flynn, Harry Jon Foord Owen, Stuart William David Grieve, and Emily Rebecca Lines\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2769–2784, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2769-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2769-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying vegetation indices is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and modelling. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has potential to accurately measure vegetation indices, but multiple methods exist, with little consensus on best practice. We compare three methods and extract wood-to-plant ratio, a metric used to correct for wood in leaf indices. We show corrective metrics vary with tree structure and variation among methods, highlighting the value of TLS data and importance of rigorous testing.\n\nRevisiting and attributing the global controls over terrestrial ecosystem functions of climate and plant traits at FLUXNET sites via causal graphical models\n\nHaiyang Shi, Geping Luo, Olaf Hellwich, Alishir Kurban, Philippe De Maeyer, and Tim Van de Voorde\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2727–2741, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2727-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2727-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn studies on the relationship between ecosystem functions and climate and plant traits, previously used data-driven methods such as multiple regression and random forest may be inadequate for representing causality due to limitations such as covariance between variables. Based on FLUXNET site data, we used a causal graphical model to revisit the control of climate and vegetation traits over ecosystem functions.\n\nDynamics of short-term ecosystem carbon fluxes induced by precipitation events in a semiarid grassland\n\nJosuÃ© Delgado-Balbuena, Henry W. Loescher, Carlos A. Aguirre-GutiÃ©rrez, Teresa Alfaro-Reyna, Luis F. Pineda-MartÃ­nez, Rodrigo Vargas, and Tulio Arredondo\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2369–2385, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2369-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the semiarid grassland, an increase in soil moisture at shallow depths instantly enhances carbon release through respiration. In contrast, deeper soil water controls plant carbon uptake but with a delay of several days. Previous soil conditions, biological activity, and the size and timing of precipitation are factors that determine the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere. Thus, future changes in precipitation patterns could convert ecosystems from carbon sinks to carbon sources.\n\nThroughfall exclusion and fertilization effects on tropical dry forest tree plantations, a large-scale experiment\n\nGerman Vargas GutiÃ©rrez, Daniel PÃ©rez-Aviles, Nanette Raczka, Damaris Pereira-Arias, JuliÃ¡n TijerÃ­n-TriviÃ±o, L. David Pereira-Arias, David Medvigy, Bonnie G. Waring, Ember Morrisey, Edward Brzostek, and Jennifer S. Powers\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2143–2160, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2143-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2143-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo study whether nutrient availability controls tropical dry forest responses to reductions in soil moisture, we established the first troughfall exclusion experiment in a tropical dry forest plantation system crossed with a fertilization scheme. We found that the effects of fertilization on net primary productivity are larger than the effects of a ~15 % reduction in soil moisture, although in many cases we observed an interaction between drought and nutrient additions, suggesting colimitation.\n\nTectonic controls on the ecosystem of the Mara River basin, East Africa, from geomorphological and spectral index analysis\n\nAlina Lucia Ludat and Simon KÃ¼bler\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1991–2012, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1991-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1991-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite-based analysis illustrates the impact of geological processes for the stability of the ecosystem in the Mara River basin (Kenya/Tanzania). Newly detected fault activity influences the course of river networks and modifies erosion–deposition patterns. Tectonic surface features and variations in rock chemistry lead to localized enhancement of clay and soil moisture values and seasonally stabilised vegetation growth patterns in this climatically vulnerable region.\n\nSpruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) cause up to 700 times higher bark BVOC emission rates compared to healthy Norway spruce (Picea abies)\n\nErica Jaakkola, Antje GÃ¤rtner, Anna Maria JÃ¶nsson, Karl Ljung, Per-Ola Olsson, and Thomas Holst\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 803–826, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-803-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-803-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncreased spruce bark beetle outbreaks were recently seen in Sweden. When Norway spruce trees are attacked, they increase their production of VOCs, attempting to kill the beetles. We provide new insights into how the Norway spruce act when infested and found the emitted volatiles to increase up to 700 times and saw a change in compound blend. We estimate that the 2020 bark beetle outbreak in Sweden could have increased the total monoterpene emissions from the forest by more than 10 &percnt;.\n\nTechnical note: Novel estimates of the leaf relative uptake rate of carbonyl sulfide from optimality theory\n\nGeorg Wohlfahrt, Albin Hammerle, Felix M. Spielmann, Florian Kitz, and Chuixiang Yi\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 589–596, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-589-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-589-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe trace gas carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is taken up by plant leaves in a process very similar to photosynthesis, is thought to be a promising proxy for the gross uptake of carbon dioxide by plants. Here we propose a new framework for estimating a key metric to that end, the so-called leaf relative uptake rate. The values we deduce by applying principles of plant optimality are considerably lower than published values and may help reduce the uncertainty of the global COS budget.\n\nObserved water and light limitation across global ecosystems\n\nFranÃ§ois Jonard, Andrew F. Feldman, Daniel J. Short Gianotti, and Dara Entekhabi\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5575–5590, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5575-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5575-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of light and water limitation in plant function at the ecosystem scale. Using satellite observations, we characterize the nonlinear relationships between sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and water and light availability. This study highlights that soil moisture limitations on SIF are found primarily in drier environments, while light limitations are found in intermediately wet regions.\n\nA question of scale: modeling biomass, gain and mortality distributions of a tropical forest\n\nNikolai Knapp, Sabine Attinger, and Andreas Huth\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4929–4944, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4929-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4929-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe biomass of forests is determined by forest growth and mortality. These quantities can be estimated with different methods such as inventories, remote sensing and modeling. These methods are usually being applied at different spatial scales. The scales influence the obtained frequency distributions of biomass, growth and mortality. This study suggests how to transfer between scales, when using forest models of different complexity for a tropical forest.\n\nSeed traits and phylogeny explain plants' geographic distribution\n\nKai Chen, Kevin S. Burgess, Fangliang He, Xiang-Yun Yang, Lian-Ming Gao, and De-Zhu Li\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4801–4810, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4801-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4801-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhy does plants' distributional range size vary enormously? This study provides evidence that seed mass, intraspecific seed mass variation, seed dispersal mode and phylogeny contribute to explaining species distribution variation on a geographic scale. Our study clearly shows the importance of including seed life-history traits in modeling and predicting the impact of climate change on species distribution of seed plants.\n\nEffect of the presence of plateau pikas on the ecosystem services of alpine meadows\n\nYing Ying Chen, Huan Yang, Gen Sheng Bao, Xiao Pan Pang, and Zheng Gang Guo\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4521–4532, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4521-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4521-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInvestigating the effect of the presence of plateau pikas on ecosystem services of alpine meadows is helpful to understand the role of the presence of small mammalian herbivores in grasslands. The results of this study showed that the presence of plateau pikas led to higher biodiversity conservation, soil nitrogen and phosphorus maintenance, and carbon sequestration of alpine meadows, whereas it led to lower forage available to livestock and water conservation of alpine meadows.\n\nAllometric equations and wood density parameters for estimating aboveground and woody debris biomass in Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi) forests of northeast Siberia\n\nClement Jean FrÃ©dÃ©ric Delcourt and Sander Veraverbeke\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4499–4520, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4499-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4499-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides new equations that can be used to estimate aboveground tree biomass in larch-dominated forests of northeast Siberia. Applying these equations to 53 forest stands in the Republic of Sakha (Russia) resulted in significantly larger biomass stocks than when using existing equations. The data presented in this work can help refine biomass estimates in Siberian boreal forests. This is essential to assess changes in boreal vegetation and carbon dynamics.\n\nStrong influence of trees outside forest in regulating microclimate of intensively modified Afromontane landscapes\n\nIris Johanna Aalto, Eduardo Eiji Maeda, Janne Heiskanen, Eljas Kullervo Aalto, and Petri Kauko Emil Pellikka\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4227–4247, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4227-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4227-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTree canopies are strong moderators of understory climatic conditions. In tropical areas, trees cool down the microclimates. Using remote sensing and field measurements we show how even intermediate canopy cover and agroforestry trees contributed to buffering the hottest temperatures in Kenya. The cooling effect was the greatest during hot days and in lowland areas, where the ambient temperatures were high. Adopting agroforestry practices in the area could assist in mitigating climate change.\n\nExcess radiation exacerbates drought stress impacts on canopy conductance along aridity gradients\n\nJing Wang and Xuefa Wen\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4197–4208, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4197-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4197-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExcess radiation and low temperatures exacerbate drought impacts on canopy conductance (Gs) among transects. The primary determinant of drought stress on Gs was soil moisture on the Loess Plateau (LP) and the Mongolian Plateau (MP), whereas it was the vapor pressure deficit on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Radiation exhibited a negative effect on Gs via drought stress within transects, while temperature had negative effects on stomatal conductance on the TP but no effect on the LP and MP.\n\nDispersal of bacteria and stimulation of permafrost decomposition by Collembola\n\nSylvain Monteux, Janine MariÃ«n, and Eveline J. Krab\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4089–4105, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4089-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4089-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the feedback from the decomposition of thawing permafrost soils is crucial to establish adequate climate warming mitigation scenarios. Past efforts have focused on abiotic and to some extent microbial drivers of decomposition but not biotic drivers such as soil fauna. We added soil fauna (Collembola Folsomia candida) to permafrost, which introduced bacterial taxa without affecting bacterial communities as a whole but increased CO2 production (+12 %), presumably due to priming.\n\nModeling the effects of alternative cropâlivestock management scenarios on important ecosystem services for smallholder farming from a landscape perspective\n\nMirjam Pfeiffer, Munir P. Hoffmann, Simon Scheiter, William Nelson, Johannes Isselstein, Kingsley Ayisi, Jude J. Odhiambo, and Reimund RÃ¶tter\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3935–3958, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3935-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3935-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSmallholder farmers face challenges due to poor land management and climate change. We linked the APSIM crop model and the aDGVM2 vegetation model to investigate integrated management options that enhance ecosystem functions and services. Sustainable intensification moderately increased yields. Crop residue grazing reduced feed gaps but not for dry-to-wet season transitions. Measures to improve soil water and nutrient status are recommended. Landscape-level ecosystem management is essential.\n\nContrasting strategies of nutrient demand and use between savanna and forest ecosystems in a neotropical transition zone\n\nMarina CorrÃªa Scalon, Imma Oliveras Menor, Renata Freitag, Karine S. Peixoto, Sami W. Rifai, Beatriz Schwantes Marimon, Ben Hur Marimon Junior, and Yadvinder Malhi\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3649–3661, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated dynamic nutrient flow and demand in a typical savanna and a transition forest to understand how similar soils and the same climate dominated by savanna vegetation can also support forest-like formations. Savanna relied on nutrient resorption from wood, and nutrient d"
