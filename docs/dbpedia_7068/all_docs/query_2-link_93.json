        "text": "Oh hell. Maybe we are approaching the end of the thread.\n\nThe problem of the “subject” is like, hard, you know? Part of the reason that I, and others on the Left, are interested in Schmitt is that he raises the question of the undetermined subject. His answer or arguments seem to me, and maybe to James Dodd’s list of writers in comment 35 (I left out Sartre), feel somehow connected to the existentialism of the 20s to 50s. I might also include the Lukacs of H & CC. I also am not so repelled by Schmitt’s view of friend/foe since I am trying to connect it to the Self/other/Other of Levinas and Lacan. A large part of the Continental philosophical project is the attempt to recover the revolutionary subject after 1968. Anyway. The following quotes are selected from my notes on Warren Breckman, Adventures of the Symbolic, 2013, with gratitude and apologies. Recommended.\n\n” Castoriadis later compressed these various attributes into a succinct deï¬nition of the social imaginary: â€œImaginary: an unmotivated creation, that exists only in and through the positing of images. Social: inconceivable as the work or the product of an individual or a host of individuals (the individual is a social institution), underivable from the psyche in itself as such.â€\n\nâ€œA full recognition of the radical imagination is possible,â€ he claimed\n\nin 1978, â€œonly if it goes hand in hand with the discovery of the other\n\ndimension of the radical imaginary, the social-historical imaginary,\n\ninstituting society as source of ontological creation deploying itself\n\nas history.â€\n\nAs with every other element of the discursive ï¬eld, the subjectivity of the agent\n\nis penetrated by the same precariousness and polysemy that overï¬‚ow all attempts\n\nto conceal or â€œsutureâ€ the indeterminacy of meaning. Ultimately, then,\n\nhegemonic politics is about the struggle for the creation of new subjects\n\nor, more precisely, new subject positions, through the practices of\n\narticulation.\n\nWe have already seen that Laclau attempted to distance himself and Mouffe from\n\nAlthusser…and full recognition that forms of overdetermination\n\nensure that subjects will always be in excess of any symbolic order.\n\nNotwithstanding these objections to the Althusserian theory of subjectivation,\n\nHegemony and Socialist Strategy remained predominantly within\n\nthe framework of a linguistic conception of the subject. To be sure,\n\nAlthusserâ€™s rigid structuralism has given way to a more dynamic\n\ndecentered model animated by surplus and slippage, and interpellation is now imagined as the outcome of political contestation, not an automatic effect irradiating from the big Other. However, Laclau and Mouffe still understand subjectivity as a product of the symbolic order, with identities being relayed up and down the chain of signiï¬cation, while they see the â€œoverdeterminationâ€ that exceeds the symbolic as stemming from the indeterminacies of signiï¬ers themselves\n\nAgon, after all, signiï¬es a de-escalation of the existential struggle implied in the concept of antagonism, and, in this sense, the presiding ï¬gure in Mouffeâ€™s later work is not Schmitt, but Hannah Arendt. Mouffe remains committed to a project that\n\nchallenges the hegemonic self-understanding of liberal democracy, but she\n\ndoes so from a position that explicitly embraces the legitimacy of liberal\n\ndemocratic values and institutions.\n\nLike Å½iÅ¾ek, Laclau argued that this void is revealed precisely by the\n\nâ€œretroactive failure of the Symbolicâ€ in its attempt to name it and, again\n\nlike Å½iÅ¾ek, Laclau emphasized that this emptiness itself, this negativity,\n\nâ€œproduces a series of crucial effects in the structuration/destructuration\n\nof social relations.â€\n\nThat is to say, social relations will be driven by the impossible desire to\n\nï¬ll the empty place of the universal with positive content and the inevitable\n\nfailure of every such attempt. Laclau even edged up toward the explanatory\n\nrole of fantasy in supplementing the lack in the Other when he describes\n\nthe content of subjective identiï¬cation and social representations of totality\n\nAt a certain level who would quarrel with the basic claim that passionate attachment is necessary for engaged struggle? What is disturbing is that Å½iÅ¾ek reduces political attachment entirely to a psychological process. Attachment to Truth is not the result of arguments but of a series of psychological short circuits. Numerous commentators have rightly worried about Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s â€œspontaneistâ€ and â€œintuitivistâ€ view of agency, the â€œgratuitousnessâ€ of political acts as he conceives them, and the impossibility on his terms of preï¬guring alternative paths of action.\n\nIndeed, Å½iÅ¾ek produces a vision of political action that goes well\n\nbeyond the decisionism of Carl Schmitt. Of Schmitt, one could say that,\n\neven if he saw no rational grounds for decision, it is nonetheless a subject\n\nwho makes the decision through an act of will. Å½iÅ¾ekâ€™s subject is never\n\nreally present in the moment of the act, but only discovers meaning retro-\n\nactively.”\n\nOkay?\n\n(Suddenly awakening in the middle of the night, after struggling to hold the jaws of alligators shut…)\n\ngeo:\n\nPhysicalism, as the thesis, no mindedness without embodiment, such that all mental attributes “must” have a causal, physical substrate or basis, is likely “true”. But of itself, such a thesis conveys little. “Physicalism” doesn’t even imply atheism, or necessarily vitiate religious beliefs; Mormons. e.g, might be quite comfortable with such notions. (Whole tomes and infinite papers are dedicated to trying to make it out, one way or another, but how much depends on such efforts, I’m not sure). At any rate, there are not 2 things, “mind” vs. “matter”, but rather a 3rd thing, “information”, and that 3rd thing is really the “hard problem”.\n\nAs for “materialism” vs. “idealism”, I said it’s an aporia. Rough-sketch, reduced form, the aporia is as follows. If one starts from the premise that all phenomena must be derived from physical causes, then ones requires concepts or ideas about material causes. Oops! Where do they come from. Usually no such account is forthcoming and likely no such account can satisfactorily be completed in fully consistent terms. But if one starts from the premise that all phenomena must somehow be “constituted” by mind, spirit, intentionality, etc. , then one must take on ever-increasing loads of material contents, such that it becomes increasingly implausible that any rational purpose could account for such twisted complexity. Materialism inadvertently slips into idealism and vice versa.\n\nAs to “metaphysics”, the point isn’t that our claims don’t or can’t have any “metaphysical” implications, but rather that such implications are undecidable, can’t be made out and certified by rational means in any fully satisfactory way. That is why Rorty, among others, would say that says that terms like “reductionist physicalism” can be dispensed with. Not because they are completely meaningless as discursive constructs, but because the effort to provide some supernal guarantee or certification of such constructs, which they seemingly promise, necessarily fails.\n\nAll human knowledge, understanding. experience and action or activity is mediated by our meanings and concepts, (which is not to say, “constituted” by them). There is simply no way to strip our meanings and concepts off of the world or out of our consciousness, and compare them either to the things or experiences themselves.\n\nYour distinction between coerced and “free” action is downright Hobbesian. But it doesn’t explain what the “thing” that can other be coerced or free is in the first place. Likewise your insistence that language comes from “biology and culture” is a muddle and petitio principii and the functionalist/instrumentalist “justification” given doesn’t help your case. Natural language, and the symbolic thinking and communication that it enables, opens up the world and gives rise to culture. And the semantic range that it affords can’t be reduced to prior causes.\n\nI’m just surprised that you remain caught up in traditional substantialist metaphysics, with your insistence that something can’t come from nothing. The classical notion of substantia/ousia interprets being as that which remains the same amidst all change, thus as what is permanent. continuous, and perpetual, “eternal”. But in the course of the 19th and onto the 20th century, historical awareness and thinking took hold. And “history” involves changes in meanings, norms, basic conceptions, leaving behind the certainties, self-evidence or securities of traditions. And that is precisely what classical substance metaphysics can’t explain or account for.\n\nTo get back to Schmitt, he was raising basic questions about sovereignty, law and legitimate authority, precisely because he experienced them as being in crisis, with the traditional understandings no longer “holding”. If law requires a sovereign source, which promulgates and coercively enforces it, just what anymore constitutes the identity and unity of a people gathered under such sovereignty? Especially since not only are we dealing with modern structurally-functionally differentiated societies and democratic demands, but also because domestic and inter-national politics have become inter-penetrated in the post-war order/chaos. Civil war has spilled beyond borders even as global domination threatens. (Ironically, it was his very struggles with the notion that sovereignty derives from “the people” and thus must be “democratic” that drove him, given his priors, into collapsing into totalitarianism). But the single most interesting question he raises, if not uniquely, then signally, is the constitutional paradox of the constituting/constituted power. That still deserves consideration.\n\nThat’s a fair response Corey, and I actually went back and took a look at some of Brooks’s earlier work. I read your essays on fear, and on neoconservatives, which I liked even as I disagreed with parts, and I read the two articles by him that you cited.\n\nHowever, I think you’re misreading Brooks. Partially.\n\nAnd I say this because, for reasons surpassing my own understanding, I went back and read some of the things he wrote before 9/11.\n\nBrooks is a political romantic in the sense that he believes people are nourished and elevated by grand, unifying projects and purposes. Brooks dislikes the notion of a culture that shrinks an individual’s purpose in life to the welfare of his particular self.\n\nBut, those grand, unifying projects and purposes need not be war, or a fundamental division between friends and enemies. He’s not Schmitt.\n\nLet me cite what seems to be the best evidence of this. In 1997 Brooks directly addressed the question of national greatness in an article entitled A Return to National Greatness: A Manifesto for a Lost Creed in The Weekly Standard.\n\nNow here, surely, one would expect to find any affinities for Schmitt painted vividly and unmistakeably.\n\nInstead, Brooks chooses as his model for unifying and elevating national projects: the Library of Congress.\n\nHe writes: The librarian of Congress at the time, Ainsworth Spofford, gave pride of place to American heroes like Benjamin Franklin and Robert Fulton in the pantheon of historical likenesses that covers the walls. Spofford and his colleagues saw the building as a statement of American greatness — and as a way to elevate America to greatness.\n\nAnd even as he invokes the metaphor of conflict, he’s more often talking about something other than actual conflict with other human beings, much less war. For example:\n\nDuring the 23 years it took to design and build the library, more people immigrated to America than in the previous 250 years combined. The nation’s population almost doubled, and white Americans settled more land in these years than in the preceding three centuries. Cities grew exponentially. Slums spread. It was a period of labor unrest.\n\nBut menaced by these threats to national cohesion, Americans redoubled their devotion to American nationalism. Hit by economic blows to their confidence, they reasserted their faith in themselves. Faced by anxiety and intellectual uncertainty, they did not succumb to malaise or cynicism. Instead they counter-attacked, with big projects like the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair and the Library of Congress.\n\nThe counter-attack was not the division of the world into friends and enemies, or the conscious affirmation of eternal war against some necessary, and human, enemy. It was in collaborative, constructive projects.\n\nThe malaise of the 1990s that Brooks discusses elsewhere, the fear (yes) that America was turning into a giant, tepid kitchen (paraphrasing), is specifically described in this article as:\n\nThe designers must have felt in their bones what Tocqueville observed: Democracy has a tendency to slide into nihilistic mediocrity if its citizens are not inspired by some larger national goal. If they think of nothing but their narrow self-interest, of their commercial activities, they lose a sense of grand aspiration and noble purpose. “What frightens me most,” Tocqueville writes, “is the danger that, amid all the constant trivial preoccupations of private life, ambition may lose both its force and its greatness, that human passions may grow gentler and at the same time baser, with the result that the progress of the body social may become daily quieter and less aspiring.”\n\nNow, without question, what he terms “an active foreign policy” is part of what he thinks America’s role should be in its achievement of “national greatness.” But that doesn’t necessarily involve war (he cites the Panama Canal as an example), and even when it’s mentioned, it is as one piece of a larger picture:\n\nFor much of this century, liberals possessed high aspirations and a spirit of historical purpose. Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, the New Deal, John F. Kennedy’s New Frontier — these were efforts to aim high, to accomplish some grand national endeavor. Liberals tried to use American preeminence as a way to shape the world, fight communism, put a man on the moon. But then came the 1970s, and suddenly liberalism became a creed emphasizing limits.\n\nThe emphasis on friend and foe, on defining human elevation through a politics of antagonism directed at another group of people, is absent here in a way that it is not in the portions of Schmitt you cited.\n\nSo I think you have Brooks right in that he’s a political romantic, in a sense. He does think that political action is as important as political ends. But I think you have him wrong in your emphasis on military conflict, and so far as the comparison to Schmitt goes, that is the crucial point imho.\n\nO.K. Just to clear up some issues with geo.\n\nAs to “metaphysics”, arguably we all make residual “metaphysical” claims. And there are still those that continue to explicitly continue such projects, not only in the air-conditioned offices of curators in the Analytic Philosophy museum, with stacks of paper piling high, but among scruffy partisans of “guerilla metaphysics” with their “object oriented ontology” who complain that Heidegger’s “correlationism” is still too humanistic. The only difference between the “Higgs boson” and metaphysical claims is that in the former case there is some hope of empirical substantiation, in highly pre-suppositioned ways, whereas in other projects there is never any possibility of providing clear criteria for deciding between one claim or the other. But both are equally obscure.\n\nSo, no, your reading of Rorty is likely wrong. All “metaphysical” claims fail, in principle and not just “so far”, but that doesn’t imply that they are simply unintelligible or unconstruable. Rorty simply declares them “optional”. Else why would he advocate “hermeneutics” as continuing conversation, (though his account is rather lame and unmotivated compared to Gadamer’s)? If “metaphysical” claims or projects were simply unintelligible, then how could we possibly read the whole prior tradition of philosophy and see how its various and sundry claims fail in their aims, even as they uncover partial truths that still inform “our” understandings?\n\nConsider as an example, (since you want to get down to cases), Levinas’ remark “metaphysics, perhaps the very essence of which is reification”. And yet he styles his own project “metaphysical ethics”. Somehow those two remarks have to be reconciled, whether hermeneutically or logically, else we just complacently and with full philistinism, conclude he’s spouting nonsense, which “we” are comfortably immune from.\n\nBut then you seem to be caught up in performative contradictions of your own making. You’re insisting in the guise of “anti-metaphysics” on metaphysical criteria of your own. But, more importantly, you want to uphold a liberal conception of “freedom”, while denying any possible account of such a “thing”. (I’d agree with you that “free will” is a pretty useless term, but it’s more because of the “will” part than the “free” part. Insistence on causal determinism, aside from being a fairly primitive account of causal issues, is a reaction formation against traditional “free will”). I prefer the term ” human agency”, but then you seem to have no account of any such thing. Neither in the individual, nor the collective instance. What is the “nature” of such “freedom”, as a real phenomenon, not an illusory epi-phenomenon? How is it possible? Why is it valuable and what would give it “value”? Just radio silence there.\n\n“Your objection to materialism seems to be that decisions/choices/meanings/symbolic thinking/concepts/consciousness etc. arenâ€™t â€œthings,â€ i.e., medium-sized dry goods. No, theyâ€™re actions or practices or verbal formations or moves in a language game or whatever you like. But that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re immaterial, or that anything is”.\n\nNo, actions and intentions are not “objects” at all. Bob Mc already did the work of the signifier/signified distinction, which effectively blocks off any sort of Platonism, insofar as patterned sounds or their corresponding written marks are part of the system of meaning-generating communication. But that’s a limited result. More importantly, language is always directly or indirectly a relation to an other, as that which is invoked and addressed by any utterance. And that other is inherently unobjectifiable, which is what gives “sense”. IOW language is what gives the possibility of (structured and conditioned) agency, and thus any human agency is not individual, atomistic, but bound up in interactions with others, such that there are no acts or intentions without interactions, such that the first-person solipsistic account of “intentional agency” is severely deficient, not at all sufficient “common sense”. You aren’t being “liberal” there, ie. “generous”, but rather defending against and repressing any relation to the “other”, potentially “violent” or disruptive of the ego. How can something come from nothing? How could it not?\n\nBut your philosophic objections were just a derailment of the direct issues. Part of Schmitt objections were directed against the notion that legal system is an autonomously self-regulating system, (which at the time was represented by the likes of Kelsen and buttressed by neo-Kantian idealism), as a liberal illusion. Of course, that mirrors the other liberal illusion, that the market economy is an autonomously self-regulating system. Hence the liberal mentality would be bifurcated between private moralism and private interests, without any genuinely public-political dimension. (This is pretty directly an inverted version of Lukacs’ Marxian account of “the antinomies of bourgeois consciousness”). To the contrary, Schmitt claims, any legal system requires a sovereign source, as the promulgating and enforcing power, and that any legal system is riddled with indeterminacies, which requires a political “supplement” to be sustained. The sovereign source and the popular basis need to be reconciled, extra-legally, in any narrow sense. Hence, he claims, the sovereign is what/who decides the exceptions. So who or what is the sovereign power that can back and enforce the authority and legitimacy of law? And what is its popular basis?\n\nIf you want examples for deciding the exceptions, they aren’t hard to find. Consider, e.g., Bush v. Gore, or the actions of the Federal Reserve Bank in 2008-09. In “international law” the issues are even more rife. But they don’t occur without issues about the inclusion/exclusion of relevant agents or agencies. Which aren’t actually derived from legal or normative deductions.\n\nSo what is the distinction between the “constituting/constituted power”? The constituting power gathers together and forms “the people” that would be subject to a constitution, as authorizing sovereign power. (It doesn’t matter, in the first instance, exactly what that constituting power consists in; theoretically, it might as well be flying monkeys). But it inaugurates, via some sort of constitution, a sovereign law-giving and law-enforcing body. The result then is the constituted power, the various delegated offices and authorities which derive from any such inaugurated constitution, which then uphold that constitution and rule over those who are subsumed under it. If the constituting power is said to be “the people”, then “the people” are subjected to their own “authority”, the constituted power rules over what constitutes it, what it ostensibly derives from. Already something of a paradox. But further, there is a “performative” dimension, connected to the dating of a before-and-after. The collective inaugural act, which derives from a collectivity, however assembled, that precedes it, also defines retrospectively the “identity” of that subjected collectivity. How can something come from nothing? Et voila! But it’s not as if the “constituting power” ceases to exist, after the “constituted power” takes hold. “Nations” can change their constitutions historically like clothing, and sufficiently severe national or international conflicts can give rise to “constitutional” issues.\n\nYes, indeed, there is something “mysterious” about such historical processes. Especially if one wants to insist that they all derive from “freedom” and that “freedom” readily converts into political obligation, recognizable authority and common “justice”.\n\nAndrew F and LFC: Thanks for the thoughtful responses and qualifications. Both of your respective points — that Brooks is a political romantic open to a romanticism derived from political sources that need not be simply about war and conflict, and that WWI marks a break in which that kind of romanticism is no longer as widely shared across the spectrum — seem basically right. I would say though that while Andrew F is definitely right about Brooks in the 1990s, the post-9/11 Brooks really brought out what I think was always lingering there in Brooks: namely the military/violent/conflict dimension. His one essay that he did for The Weekly Standard or Newsweek or somewhere — “This Age of Conflict” — is really telling. Just some highlights (what follows is all Brooks):\n\n“Obviously nobody knows what the future years will feel like, but we do know that the next decade will have a central feature that was lacking in the last one: The next few years will be defined by conflict. And it’s possible to speculate about what that means. The institutions that fight for us and defend us against disorder–the military, the FBI, the CIA–will seem more important and more admirable. The fundamental arguments won’t be over economic or social issues, they will be over how to wield power–whether to use American power aggressively or circumspectly. We will care a lot more about ends–winning the war–than we will about means. We will debate whether it is necessary to torture prisoners who have information about future biological attacks. We will destroy innocent villages by accident, shrug our shoulders, and continue fighting. In an age of conflict, bourgeois virtues like compassion, tolerance, and industriousness are valued less than the classical virtues of courage, steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for victory.\n\n“LOOKING BACK, the striking thing about the 1990s zeitgeist was the presumption of harmony. The era was shaped by the idea that there were no fundamental conflicts anymore. The Cold War was over, and while the ensuing wars–like those in Bosnia and Rwanda –were nettlesome, they were restricted to global backwaters. Meanwhile, technology was building bridges across cultures. The Internet, Microsoft ads reminded us, fostered communication and global harmony. All around the world there were people casting off old systems so they could embrace a future of peace and prosperity. Chinese Communists were supposedly being domesticated by the balm of capitalist success. Peace seemed in the offing in Northern Ireland and, thanks to the Oslo process, in the Middle East.\n\n“Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were elected president of the United States. Neither had performed much in the way of military service. Neither was particularly knowledgeable about foreign affairs. Both promised to be domestic-policy presidents. In that age of peace and prosperity, the top sitcom was “Seinfeld,” a show about nothing. Books appeared with titles like “All Connected Now: Life in the First Global Civilization.” Academics analyzed the twilight of national sovereignty. Commerce and communications seemed much more important than politics.\n\n“Defense spending was drastically cut, by Republicans as well as Democrats, because there didn’t seem to be any clear and present danger to justify huge budgets. The army tried to recruit volunteers by emphasizing its educational benefits, with narcissistic slogans like “An Army of One.” Conservatives, of all people, felt so safe that they became suspicious of the forces of law and order. Conservative activists were heard referring to police as “bureaucrats with badges”; right-wing talk radio dwelt on the atrocities committed by the FBI, the DEA, and other agencies at places like Ruby Ridge and Waco. Meanwhile, all across the political spectrum, interest in public life waned, along with the percentage of adults who bothered to vote. An easy cynicism settled across the land, as more people came to believe that national politics didn’t really matter. What mattered instead, it seemed, were local affairs, community, intimate relations, and the construction of private paradises. When on rare occasions people talked about bitter conflict, they usually meant the fights they were having with their kitchen renovators.\n\n“Historians who want to grasp the style of morality that prevailed in the 1990s should go back to the work of sociologist Alan Wolfe. In books like “One Nation, After All” and “Moral Freedom,” Wolfe called the prevailing ethos “small scale morality.” Be moderate in your beliefs, and tolerant toward people who have other beliefs. This is a moral code for people who are not threatened by any hostile belief system, who don’t think it is worth it to stir up unpleasantness. “What I heard as I talked to Americans,” Wolfe wrote of his research, “was a distaste for conflict, a sense that ideas should never be taken so seriously that they lead people into uncivil, let alone violent, courses of action.”\n\n“BUT NOW VIOLENCE HAS COME CALLING. Now it is no longer possible to live so comfortably in one’s own private paradise. Shocked out of the illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize that we, as individuals, simply cannot protect ourselves. Private life requires public protection. Now it is not possible to ignore foreign affairs, because foreign affairs have not ignored us. It has become clear that we are living in a world in which hundreds of millions of people hate us, and some small percentage of them want to destroy us. That realization is bound to have cultural effects.\n\n…\n\n“There are other cultural effects. For example, commercial life seems less important than public life, and economic reasoning seems less germane than cultural analysis. When life or death fighting is going on, it’s hard to think of Bill Gates or Jack Welch as particularly heroic. Moreover, the cost-benefit analysis dear to economists doesn’t really explain much in times of war. Osama bin Laden is not motivated by economic self-interest, and neither are our men and women who are risking their lives to defeat him. To understand such actions, you need to study history, religion, and ethics. The people who try to explain events via economic reasoning begin to look silly….\n\n“BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT CULTURAL EFFECT of conflict is that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it more grandly, a tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession reminds us of certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the decade of peace and prosperity. Evil exists. Difficulties, even tragedies, are inevitable. Human beings are flawed creatures capable of monstrosity. Not all cultures are compatible. To preserve order, good people must exercise power over destructive people.\n\n“That means that it’s no longer sufficient to deconstruct ideas and texts and signifiers. You have to be able to construct hard principles so you can move from one idea to the next, because when you are faced with the problem of repelling evil, you absolutely must be able to reach a conclusion on serious moral issues.\n\n…\n\n“ut history never repeats itself neatly. No one can predict the political and cultural consequences of a war, any more than the course of the war itself. But it does seem clear that we have moved out of one political and cultural moment and into another. We have traded the anxieties of affluence for the real fears of war. We have moved from an age of peace to an age of conflict, and in times of conflict people are different. They go to extremes. Some people, and some nations, turn cowardly or barbaric. Other people, and other nations, become heroic, brave, and steadfast. It all depends on what they have in them. War isn’t only, as Bourne said, the health of the state. It’s the gut-check of the nation.”\n\nThis is me again: That war as the gut-check of the nation business — not exactly Schmitt, of course, but more of a Brooksian version of Schmittianism. American Schmittianism if you will. Political romanticism, politics as the highest good, with violence always around the edge.\n\nMr. Timberman @125 – “converting freedom into political [or any kind] of obligation” appears to translate as “converting freedom into its opposite.” If I’m obligated to you and yours at all – to put on a uniform and take up arms if war is declared and I’m summoned to serve, or even just to pay taxes or buy health insurance – then I am obviously in that way or to that extent less ideally free. Maybe you were already observing the contradiction with your italics.\n\nI’m not preparing to argue against such compromises of ideal freedom in the manner of a Tea Partier. Instead of attempting a comment thread essay on the “mixed regime” and mass polities, a discussion that I trust will be familiar to many or most of you, I’m simply emphasizing that the contradiction arises not just in columns by big-name moderate-conservative pundits, or in books by political theorists who were implicated in crimes against humanity, or every day on Fox News, but at the highest level of “metaphysical” abstraction, or at the very conceptual as well as historical origins of modern liberalism. I was trying to suggest as much in my “incomprehensible” remarks above, and the excellent comment by JCH, to which you link, puts the argument much more clearly, generously, and expertly.\n\nWe are history’s great experts at negotiation of this contradiction, but the point of relevance to the discussion of Brooks and Schmitt, and the argument that must be admitted at some point on their behalf, is that both are arguing against forms of ideological liberalism that do not acknowledge or only very grudgingly acknowledge the existence of any significant theoretical problem at all, resulting in a discourse – as well as in policy, rhetoric, and popular expectations – that in their view is not just unrealistic, but tragically detached from reality, leaving their “friends” perhaps dangerously unprepared for whatever next inevitable conversion of the (thought to be) free into the un-free.\n\nThis necessity is, as said, realism for the statist conservative: a rule of “reality.” In the real world, they believe, there really are decisively illiberal enemies of liberalism who are both prepared and capable of forcing it to convert itself into its opposite. One such familiar form of resultant self-alienation was alluded to in a comment above, on liberal ideology as a “cloak” for “the same old grosse politik,” but such hypocrisy would be merely one common form – actual hypocrisy – of the more general problem addressed by Schmitt and perhaps, if obviously less incisively and coherently, by Brooks. On this basis arises one of the great ironies, rehearsed on this thread, of brown-baiting Schmitt in reference to his writings in the ’20s, since they were composed well before his abortive join-’em phase, when he was in fact arguing for beat-’em: employ the highly illiberal measures included in the very liberal Weimar constitution on behalf of the liberal or mostly liberal or liberalist order against the “negative” parties including the extreme right. He happened to be saying, at that moment, and I think with some clear if heavily qualified sympathy for liberalist aspirations, “Guys, this is what you always do, always have done, and must and will sooner or later do, if you want to survive at all, and survival doesn’t mean, because it’s never meant, preserve a perfectly orderly and lawful regime of peace and freedom: It means preserve some type of self-contradictory or hybrid mess sustained by an order that, in addition to maintaining some space for your ideals, also maintains some space for my different ones.” It is, in short, a Hobbesian argument, but modified for modern mass society under pressure.\n\nBoth in the comments originally cited and all the more in the extensive excerpts that Professor Robin supplies, Brooks is making a somewhat parallel Leviathan argument: We’re going to or ought to sacrifice some ideal liberalism-individualism for the sake of some reinforced nationalism-patriotism-statism (which latter configuration always includes and, according to Schmitt among many others – Arendt quite famously – rests on the potential for organized mass violence). He says, “You may not like the medicine, but will be good for us for a number of reasons, and it will be necessary whether or not you’re ready to call it good.” Viewed in historical context, he goes on to say, it won’t be in the least unusual, and there neither is nor ever has been any real alternative. The form of this argument also explains why Brooks is treated with such grave mistrust from the “constitutional conservative” and libertarian right.\n\nI believe that Schmitt’s thought, on its own and “in translation,” became relevant again for one main and perhaps too obvious reason: Not because the state of the USA 1990-2014 greatly resembles the state of the Weimar Republic, and not simply because the War on Terror saw an escalation in illiberal or “legal-exceptional” policy supposedly on behalf of Western liberal commitments, but because the collapse of Communism finally posed or allowed for the posing of the question of the American-led international liberal-humanitarian order unambiguously. Schmitt was perhaps the most penetrating political thinker from the other side during the last great crisis of liberal democracy in its Eurocentric form, prior to the ascension of the Americanized global successor. (Schmitt in his post-Nazi writings analyzes this historical process in careful detail, incidentally – in many ways it’s even more “timely” reading.) Schmitt provides a set of apparent answers that we have determined we must oppose, but which we, or often the people we have claimed we wanted to help, end up adopting or modifying to suit whichever exigency.\n\nIn treating Brooks as Schmitt’s translator, Robin makes a version of the same charge against Brooks that Leo Strauss made in 1932 against Schmitt – the same charge frequently made against Strauss, and a charge that Robin himself often seems to be on guard against: of overly identifying with his subject. Obviously, unlike Schmitt and Strauss and Brooks, Robin has thusfar kept himself off the proscription lists. As for Robin’s specific point, I don’t think it’s wrong to say that Brooks’ stance is anticipated in Schmitt. On the other hand, so are a lot of other people’s, including, as we have seen right here on this thread, the stances of many of Schmitt’s self-styled enemies. The related but to me, and clearly to Strauss, more interesting question is whether Schmitt’s crypto-fascism (not a term used by Strauss, but I think clearly implied) and its intermediate enemy, ideological liberalism, define a horizon that we are in any way usefully able to think beyond without falling off the edge of the world.\n\nJCH: Thank you for the lengthy philosophy tutorial. I’ll be pondering it for quite a while. Meantime, a very partial and inadequate response.\n\nThe only difference between the â€œHiggs bosonâ€ and metaphysical claims is that in the former case there is some hope of empirical substantiation, in highly pre-suppositioned ways, whereas in other projects there is never any possibility of providing clear criteria for deciding between one claim or the other. But both are equally obscure.\n\nThe second sentence seems to me in flat contradiction to the first. The mode of verification of a statement may not be the whole of its meaning, but the absence of any imaginable verification procedure seems to me equivalent to meaningless. I’m not just alluding to the dear, deluded old Vienna Circle, but also to Hume’s well-known anti-metaphysical dictum (quoting from memory): “You are holding a book in your hand. Does it contain any reasoning concerning facts or numbers? No? Does it contain any poetry or imaginary narrative? No? Then commit it to the flames, since it can contain nothing of value?”\n\nAll â€œmetaphysicalâ€ claims fail, in principle and not just â€œso farâ€, but that doesnâ€™t imply that they are simply unintelligible or unconstruable.\n\nIndeed, it implies the opposite. They cannot be known to fail if they are completely unintelligible. Disproven claims are, by definition, intelligible.\n\nIf â€œmetaphysicalâ€ claims or projects were simply unintelligible, then how could we possibly read the whole prior tradition of philosophy and see how its various and sundry claims fail in their aims, even as they uncover partial truths that still inform â€œourâ€ understandings?\n\nYes, that’s a hard question, but I don’t believe, as you evidently do, that it’s unanswerable. Here’s a first pass at it: A large part of the history of philosophy consists of attempts to answer such intuitively plausible questions as “What is Being?” and “Why is there something rather than nothing?” Those of us who believe that no one has ever formulated a satisfactory, or even intelligible, answer to these questions have begun to wonder if posing those questions isn’t the wrong way of responding to the experiences that give rise to them. Maybe we should write poetry instead, or do neurophysiology, or insure that everyone has enough to eat, a place to sleep, a decent education, medical care, etc, and then come back to those experiences. At that point, they may suggest different, more promising questions. I suspect this is also what Rorty would say, and is part of what he meant by “the priority of democracy to philosophy.”\n\nRe Levinas: of course it’s impossible to conclude from the little you quote that he’s “spouting nonsense.” But the very little I’ve read of him did, I admit, give me that impression, on the whole.\n\nYouâ€™re insisting in the guise of â€œanti-metaphysicsâ€ on metaphysical criteria of your own.\n\nThis sounds a little like the believer’s tired retort: “But atheism is a religion too!”\n\nyou want to uphold a liberal conception of â€œfreedomâ€, while denying any possible account of such a â€œthingâ€.\n\nI thought I made it pretty clear in a previous comment that defining “freedom,” in the sense of “absence of coercion,” is a practical matter, i.e., for legal definition and political debate. It has no reference whatever to uncaused volitions or spiritual substances.\n\nInsistence on causal determinism, aside from being a fairly primitive account of causal issues, is a reaction formation against traditional â€œfree willâ€\n\nYes, which is why Rorty rightly proposed that we drop both causal determinism and free will and just get on with figuring out what we want to mean by “cause” and, more important (since we have at least a working definition already, and a lot of urgent problems to deal with) what causes what.\n\n. I prefer the term â€ human agencyâ€, but then you seem to have no account of any such thing. … What is the â€œnatureâ€ of such â€œfreedomâ€, as a real phenomenon, not an illusory epi-phenomenon? How is it possible? Why is it valuable and what would give it â€œvalueâ€?\n\nHere’s a tentative account: People do things and give reasons why, which may or may not be identical with what appears to others the causes of their doing those things.\n\nWhat is freedom and why is it valuable? Freedom is (again very roughly) an individual’s sense of control over her own (or a group’s sense of control over its own) fate. This is valuable to most of us in 21st-century capitalist democracy’s because when we look back, in the course of our education/socialization/acculturation at the lives of the people we identify with, things seem to have turned out better for them when that had that control than when others had it.\n\nany human agency is not individual, atomistic, but bound up in interactions with others, such that there are no acts or intentions without interactions, such that the first-person solipsistic account of â€œintentional agencyâ€ is severely deficient, not at all sufficient â€œcommon senseâ€\n\nYes, I agree. At the risk of driving you back into the alligator’s jaws, what made you think I wouldn’t?\n\nAnd now to the “direct issues” that all of the above is a “derailment” from:\n\nany legal system requires a sovereign source, as the promulgating and enforcing power, and that any legal system is riddled with indeterminacies, which requires a political â€œsupplementâ€ to be sustained. The sovereign source and the popular basis need to be reconciled, extra-legally, in any narrow sense. Hence, he claims, the sovereign is what/who decides the exceptions. So who or what is the sovereign power that can back and enforce the authority and legitimacy of law? And what is its popular basis?\n\nI’m afraid I don’t see the paradox here. I’m not sure what you mean by “indeterminacies” or “supplement,” what the distinction is supposed to be between the “sovereign source” and the “popular basis.” Perhaps you could illustrate historically? [As CK does @128.] My account of the process you describe in the above paragraph would be: Historical contingencies sometimes give rise to a group with enough of a common life to warrant their constituting themselves a democratic polity. This may happen in the state of nature or after overthrowing a previous regime. They talk about how to do this, agree on procedures, send delegates, agree on rules (including rules for interpreting and modifying the rules or withdrawing from the polity), and submit the scheme (ie, constitution) for popular ratification. When conflicts arise that cannot be reconciled within the constitutional scheme (including the rules for amending the rules), they may peacefully separate or engage in civil war. This seems to be the constitutional history of United States. What examples did you have in mind?\n\nSo what is the distinction between the â€œconstituting/constituted powerâ€? The constituting power gathers together and forms â€œthe peopleâ€ that would be subject to a constitution, as authorizing sovereign power.\n\nI’m missing something: why can’t “the people” be the “constituting power”; ie,gather themselves together once the course of their history has made it seem advisable to enough of them to do so? Isn’t that (to a reasonable approximation) what happened in the US?\n\n@geo/133: First I should say that conservatist-statists under their reality principle are the ones who accuse liberal idealists of tragic un-realism. Anyway, I don’t think I was being cavalier. I was describing how I think they see things. I seek a different view, though I will confess that I do take the conservative-statist view seriously. Whether that makes me suspicious or deserving of banishment, I’ll leave to others to decide for themselves.\n\nAs for the global capitalist regime, it seems to me that to deny even “the slightest evidence of concern for humanitarianism” in American policy ever and overall would be very close to saying, and for a self-styled humanitarian virtually the same as saying, that we might as well have let the Nazis have their way. To say anything else would be to admit of some meaningful difference between Nazism and Americanism. If you identify yourself as above all a humanitarian, then such a meaningful difference, if you recognize it, would presumably be a humanitarian difference.\n\nThere might also potentially or at least conceivably an alternative and possibly very Schmittian difference, based on the assumption that on balance it’s better to win than to lose a war for the winners, and that “we” (the friends) won (defeated the foes). Even under this construction, however, and without pretending to judge motives and morals of all involved on any side, among the fruits of that victory was the opportunity to impose an order of international law, entailing a global regime of human rights law and a range of global institutions, all in keeping with long-standing American aspirations, adopted under American tutelage, echoing American documents, and so on, and so on. So there’s rich irony, or arguably an exhibition of filial ingratitude, in standing on that same foundation or in that house in absolute condemnation of America or Americanism. Whether the global regime under whatever name and in its current form, including America’s role in it, is worth preserving (worth working to preserve, potentially fighting to preserve), and if so under what modifications, is another way of phrasing the historical-conjunctural question as I previously stated it.\n\nOn the specific circumstances that Schmitt addressed or encountered over the course of the ’20s, I believe JCH will be able to recall and recite the play-by-play and identify all the players far better than I can. However, I can say that, though you might think “the disagreement between Schmitt and his liberal opponents should only have concerned whether preemptive action was necessary and feasible rather than whether it was legitimate,” I expect JCH will agree that situation was very unfortunately not that simple. You can check the Wikipedia article if you want to get into the details on the above-mentioned “Article 48” – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_48_%28Weimar_Constitution%29 – but, to summarize, Schmitt’s constitutional argument rested on a kind of emergency reading of ambiguities in the emergency clause, or of the reading of ambiguities into the emergency clause. In other words, and one might say wonderfully, if not for the historical sequels, the constitutional provisions for suspension of provisions of the constitution did not, according to the best legal analysis, allow for their own suspension to the degree necessary…. for their use: To follow them in this instance, it was concluded, you’d have to break them. So, to the legal idealistic mind, there might indeed under some circumstances be a legally sound basis potentially for suspending basic laws, but not in the way that Schmitt argued was necessary under the obtaining circumstances.\n\nHindenburg was not Lincoln, and Weimar was not the USA, so no one or not enough ones were ready to presume to negate the constitutional order in order to save the constitutional order. What they ended up with was a constitution that was still nominally the basis of law throughout the Third Reich, but which had been rendered impotent as an instrument of liberal-democratic order as understood anywhere else or anytime since. You can pay me now, or you can pay me later.\n\nG considering alternate POVs, (as you are formally committed to agreeing to). Just as ,eo @131:\n\nI started a response last night, but got interrupted by a lengthy phone call (my birthday), and decided to scrap the effort and go to bed. And I don’t want to get side-tracked here on discussion of philosophical issues, (philosophical discussions being by their very nature “infinite”, interminable). Nor do I think that I could ever shake you from your “happy positivism”, nor from your Irving Howe type politics. (The latter is not exactly a criticism). The only thing I could ask is that you not reify them, in as should be fairly obvious, am not trying to impose my personal preferences here. No one’s preferences or presuppositions extend throughout the world or its history, even if they might hold past one’s front door.\n\nJust a few quick points. Defining “freedom” as the absence of coercion is a negative definition. I mentioned Hobbes there, for whom, if a body wasn’t literally bound by chains, it was thereby free. (I myself, in a much different sense, would see human agency as constituted by constraints, as structured, rule-governed behavior). But the most relevant point here is that we’re discussing, among other matters, legal orders, “the rule of law”, and coercion is always ingredient in any such order. Does that mean you would define “freedom” as the absence of law or legal sanctions?\n\nYou also seem to have a rather instrumentalistic conception of language, as a tool or organ, (which derives from the Greek for “tool”). When asked where language comes from, you replied biology and culture, which is a backwards answer. (But the matter of how biological organization and drives and socio-cultural structure inter-penetrate to form “human nature” is Arnold Gehlen’s territory, not Carl Schmitt’s). Not only are there many more roles of language which are pervasive throughout the conduct of human life, but language, as I said earlier, is always a relation to an other. Which means that, though you acknowledge the humans are fundamentally social, you still seem to conceive of society as an “external” association of individuals. (“Individual” means etymologically undivided. But are human beings really undivided?). Which implies that human life is always a collective matter and the collective has a certain “priority” over the individual. So “freedom” is as much a collective as an individual issue, as are the various identities and identifications of individuals, (an especially important point when considering the hold that political “opinions” exercises on people).\n\n“Performative contradictions” are always possible, since things are a tangle. One shouldn’t make such a charge manipulatively, nor under any assumption of immunity. But the sort of unruffled compatibilism that you seem to advocate strikes me as rather oblivious to its own vunerabilities to such a charge or criticism.\n\nNow to try and get back on topic. Sovereignty precedes constitutionalism, both historically and “logically”. (The modern European notion of sovereignty is usually traced back to Jean Bodin, in the midst of the French Civil War). And the state as “the organized monopoly on legitimate violence” already involves a strange alchemy between violence and legitimacy, though often the key term “organized” is overlooked. That is why the “constituting power” can’t be reduced necessarily to a “democratic polity”, nor to a “social contract”, (which natural right theories were precursors to constitutionalism). And such a self-authorizing act can’t be derived, even heuristically, from the fiction of a “state of nature”, but remains paradoxical, since it draws on and presupposes the very “authority” that it creates. How can “freedom” be converted to submission to “authority” and how can such authority be “legitimated”? There are various and sundry possible answers to such questions. For example, the sovereign is said to “protect” freedom, if at the price of sacrificing some part of that freedom. But whose freedom and just why this sovereign? Or the sovereign protects its citizens/subjects from each other, in which case how could the sovereign be said to arise from the people and their freedom? There always remains something in excess of such stated reasons, as well as something arbitrary or contingent in them. Which owes to the rupture in the continuity of historical time of the inaugural act, which is precisely what you seem to wish to damp down.\n\nNow, a paradox is usually considered a sign of trouble. And no doubt numerous political and legal theorists have sought to resolve or diffuse any such constitutional paradox. (Whether there are any “true” paradoxes is a question, but a systematically complete and self-consistent account of reality is a bridge too far. Some logicians now appeal to para-consistency, which make it all a kludge anyway). But I think the point is that this one can always re-emerge in some form or another. I have no idea why you think that there is some problem with my use of “indeterminacy”, but perhaps there are 2 kinds here. One is the risk and uncertainty that inheres in political affairs, since no one can know the future, (which counts against retrospective post hoc propter hoc historical fallacies), even as sovereign arrangements attempt to protect themselves against such contingencies. But the other sense is that meaning is always a potential; something means always only what it could mean, (this and not that). Interpretation is always required. As to “supplement”, that refers to the fact that laws must be obeyed, even as the system of laws isn’t an autonomously self-regulating one, so some “legitimating” political alliance is required to secure such compliance. The two together go into Schmitt’s claim that “the sovereign is what decides the exception”. I don’t see what you think is unclear here.\n\nBut I want to get a bit beyond Schmitt into the political problem of “authority”. Authority is “necessary” in pragmatic or functionalist terms for securing some basis of social cooperation. But there is a still more intrinsic reason, (though it doesn’t contradict exactly the first). Years ago, Gregory Bateson said that there is both a report and a command aspect to every statement. That formulation is inadequate for a number of reasons, but its basic intuition is correct. Language usage is always riddled with imperatives, multiple, contradictory and possibly even paradoxical. And often in disguised or denegated forms, whereby speakers issue them unaware or disavowing. (Have you ever attended an “Occupy” meeting?) And speech is very much of the “essence” of the political, as Arendt would have it. But there is no “foundation” or prior basis for such imperatives. Simply put, any imperative exceeds the factual basis from which it arises. In fact, it usually aims at somehow altering at least partly that factual basis, or, in the case of a negative imperative, a prohibition, at altering the course that otherwise would ensue. So there is no basis for “authority” whatsoever, it’s groundless and abysmal. And yet it’s inevitable, in the sense of unavoidable. That, in a nutshell, is the political problem of authority: it somehow must be “secured” and projectively constructed, yet there is no “prior” basis for doing so. But it’s an entirely secular “mystery”.\n\nAs to your rather nostalgic appeal to the American revolution, (another kind of “exceptionalism”), I’m no expert on the historiography of the early American republic, but the U.S. constitution was a compromise among elites and then imposed upon the “people”. And though a “miracle” in its time, it was scarcely “democratic”, just republican, and however amended in the course of history in a more “democratic” direction,- (and I would guess you’d be just as ambivalent about Andy Jackson as I would),- nowadays it’s a rather archaic and outmoded document, that scarcely functions and has been repeatedly “gamed”. In many ways, the Civil War, (and the Revolution was already such), has never quite ended, but returns with the repressed.\n\nBut I can’t resist quoting John Austin here, to the effect that, whenever anyone uses the word “democracy”, it’s never quite clear what is meant. A piece of donnish liberalism, to be sure, but not without its point. (Of course, in the 19th century, liberalism and democracy were diametrically opposed terms: just ask the Chartists). To me, “democracy” is not the name of a political regime, but rather names a social ethos that may or may not attach to any such regime. There is scarcely any regime in the world today that doesn’t claim to rule in the name of the “people”. (It’s the “kratia” root that’s interesting. It meant “power”, but one of its senses was “overwhelmingness”. How very Greek!) So we have “liberal democracy”, “representative democracy”, “mass plebiscitary democracy”, “people’s democracy”, etc. I myself, in a very, very abstract sense, would be a republican, with a very small r, and in a secular non-ethnic, non-religious sense. But the problem is this: how can a public sphere arise and purport to regulate and even oppose a state, if there is no sovereign power vested in a state in the first place? And then there is also the problem of “legitimation” or “hegemony”. How much is required? There are weak, more-or-less positivistic accounts, such as Weber’s, the mere acquiescence of the governed, strong requirements, such as Arendt’s, the active assent and participation of the governed, and the reductive functionalist accounts, in which “normative” requirements are to be reduced to functionalist terms, such as Luhmann’s systems-theory account of “self-legitimating political elites”, since all social sub-systems strive toward “autonomization” in their self-referential “codes”, and the political one is just concerned with interlinking with the other sub-systems.\n\nBut the problem for liberalism has always been this: how does liberalism deal with its “illiberal” opponents and yet still “incorporate” them under liberal rule or hegemony. At some point, “illiberal” means must be deployed, which is deeply corrosive of such “liberal” hegemony. But that is precisely the problem that Schmitt pinpoints. The problem for “sovereignty” is, as I said, who is included and who is excluded in the unity and identity of a “sovereign” demos. A fully “inclusive” political order, according to Schmitt, would be no such thing. But then what is the “principle” at issue; how is it to be decided? And upon what “mortal clay” is it to operate? The refusal to deal with such “concrete” issues, in the name of abstract “principles”, is very much part of the trap that he lays.\n\nBut the willful mischaracterization of Schmitt’s liberal opponents speaks precisely to his point. Schmitt is not advocating hatred and war as the basis of political “unity”, (as with B.W. @ 142). He was RC, which may have predisposed him to conservative authoritarianism, (likely so), but also means he was thoroughly versed in religious doctrine. When he emphasizes the *possibility* of “physically” being killed and killing, aside from just reflecting the traditional doctrine of sovereignty, (in the aftermath of a World War, in which massive killing had occurred), he is also emphasizing the religious outrage of such a thing, since the religious injunction is “love thine enemy”. And thereby emphasizing the differentiation of “value spheres”, (Weber among others), as well as, emphasizing the thoroughly worldly “nature” of the political and political behavior, as against any “spiritualizing” or idealistic interpretations, (which were rife at that time). Hence the “physical” as a marker that blocks such moves, as a stand-in for “existential”. But political existence, (on any appreciable scale), involves living in community with others, who are other, i.e. not just alter-egos, just like oneself. And certainly the political domain might involve fear-and-loathing of the other, just as it might involve resentment, anxiety, contempt, or a whole host of other “evaluative” emotions. It is a domain of unknowing, more than of knowing. But how that is to be gathered together into a workable polity is the relevant question. And likewise the emphasis is on the public “nature” of the political domain. Personal morality is a private matter, not to be confused with public-political “justice”. And, indeed, the moralization of political issues just renders political conflicts all the more “absolute” and thus irresolvable. It does damage to both private morality and public “justice”, rather than preserving the independence of those “spheres”. (Arendt, who must have known of Schmitt from her background at least, makes a similar point). But self-righteous moralistic outrage is precisely how his “liberal” opponents respond to Schmitt. B.W. at least acknowledges a certain “integrity” in the man, in the manner of Kafka’s “old commandant”, but still seems to miss the brutal irony of the story as a whole.\n\nAs for Bob Mc @129. I will call and raise him. By remembering that other momentous assassination in the summer of 1914: Jean Jaures. After which the SPD voted by majority to support the German war, which split not just the SPD, but the Second International and the entire labor movement based left. The Archimedean lever that Marx had sought to devise definitively shattered and failed back then. Ebert’s reliance on the Freikorps, in order to preserve “parliamentary legitimacy”, was already a repetition of a precedence. We’re still in recovery mode.\n\nBut after all these palaverings about “authority” and its “legitimations”, the really hard question remains: power. If “knowledge is power” (Bacon), and therefore (sic!) “power is knowledge” (Nietzsche), then what is power? What is its “nature”, what are its sources, how is it generated and gathered, concentrated and re-distributed? What are its modes and how are they converted into each other? What can we know or understand of such processes? I’m still awaiting the genius, (etymologically, “guardian spirit”), who could enlighten us about such matters.\n\nWell, that’s all for now, folks. Cue the Loonie Tunes music.\n\nJCH:\n\nthe problem for liberalism has always been this: how does liberalism deal with its â€œilliberalâ€ opponents and yet still â€œincorporateâ€ them under liberal rule or hegemony[?]. At some point, â€œilliberalâ€ means must be deployed, which is deeply corrosive of such â€œliberalâ€ hegemony.\n\nI grant you that the above effectively summarizes the typical appearance of the problem, but it does so in a way that conceals or only partly and inconsistently acknowledges internal contradictions that bear directly on the matter in question, or effectively comprise the matter truly in question.\n\nTo state and address the matter sufficiently clearly, we will need to abide by a sufficiently strict definition of terms. If we define modern liberalism as the doctrine of the primacy of the universal rights of human beings, for early modern theorists of liberalism the “natural right” or “inalienable rights” of “men,” there can be no “liberal rule” or “liberal hegemony” or liberal “incorporation” of the illiberal. There will be only intrinsically non- or anti- or illiberal or always incompletely or qualifiedly liberal arrangements that may be more or less conducive to the liberation or fuller liberation of human beings, or to the full realization or flourishing of human beings as free and equal individuals.\n\nIn other words, strictly speaking there is not and cannot be a “liberal state” as such, in the sense of a political administrative state whose principles of organization will be strictly speaking liberal principles. We may imagine that the universal uncompromising and homogeneous adoption of liberal doctrines would produce a “liberal state of things,” and we can argue that different governmental orders will promote, foster, safeguard, protect, and allow for liberal aspirations more or less successfully than others, but whatever political-administrative state there is, to whatever extent it is at all, will be non-liberal on its own terms, and “anti-liberal” in the sense that its ordering principle will be contrary to, place limitations upon the liberties or otherwise free pursuit of happiness of equal individuals.\n\nSo, we can re-phrase your statement as follows: The problem for liberals has always been this: How much illiberalism must really be tolerated or which illiberal means must be employed for the sake of whatever best achievable realization of liberal ends?\n\nIn this form the question re-states and expands upon the classical political question on human flourishing or the best society or the good by giving modern natural right a privileged position, but it also allows for realism, or for cognizance of the reality of illiberal or pre-liberated or constrained, etc., social, political, and economic relations and environments: the liberalist version of The First Noble Truth.\n\nWe could, as some have, seek to dispense with every form of natural right, aka bourgeois values, but we mostly, even in these relatively radicalism-friendly parts, remain visibly and even dramatically reluctant to do so. Even among those ready to put all systems of social, political, and economic relations as they understand them in question, I think we today will find few speakers, even here, ready to surrender freedom of speech and conscience, or truly prepared to dispense entirely with the modern idea of the individual, of of individuality as a form of life worthy of respect and protection. So they or we are still children of Locke and nieces and nephews of our Uncle Sam to that extent, or in other words we are mostly still meaningfully liberals whether or not under socialistic or other advisement. In that connection, according to this same theory of the necessarily hybrid character of all real-existing liberal political orders this side of the apocalypse, all liberals will always remain liberals only under advisement.\n\nSince we, as individuals and in all real existing societies, are always also at least potentially, more likely flagrantly, “illiberal” in at least some respects regarding free realizations of some conceived interests of others – in murdering their rivals, say, or in stealing from their neighbors, or in abusing or effectively enslaving their employees, or in disposing of waste upstream from us – a second perhaps equally valid, or at least impartial way of re-phrasing the big question arises: The problem for us all has always been this: How much liberalism must really be tolerated, or which liberal means must be employed, for the sake of whatever best achievable realization of our not necessarily or entirely or simply liberal ends? (To declare this question impermissible would be to declare oneself an ideological or committed liberal, but illiberally, as an illiberally liberal liberal.)\n\nIn other words, the problem for the doctrines following from the asserted primacy of modern natural right under whatever name or configuration, including all of our very post-modern or supposedly post-modern but still recognizably and in the final analysis typically modern configurations, will always remain a matter of reconciliation of contradictory commitments, specifically commitments to the good of and for individuals as individuals and the good of and for collective or social entities.\n\nThe early modern political philosophers, I will maintain, did rather exhaustively examine these questions and the related ones on the nature of power or the origins of authority that you also raise. They did provide answers. They knew we wouldn’t all like them or fully understand them. Indeed, to a very significant degree they not only acknowledged, but rather depended on the latter – that is on general incapacities of understanding. They hoped and trusted that enough of us would accept and implement them, under whatever modifications. If we are in fact still living with those answers, showing no sign of succesfully implementing alternative ones, then Hegel was right, as far as we can say, to claim that in his time humanity had reached the end of history in principle.\n\nThe problem for Schmitt – who in some ways ironically, in other ways perhaps quite accurately was later charged with the crime of Hegelianism by his Nazi comrades – as for us in relation to Schmitt’s thought, or for that matter in relation to Brooks’ thought, is the simultaneous emergence into consciousness and into politics of a fundamental, or foundational, element of that answer, which upon every re-statement seems to re-embroil us in paradoxes and unacceptable logical as well as moral contradictions, for instance as the assertion of the actual rationality of acceptance of the seemingly irrational or perhaps never fully rationalizable – of that which, if ever actually fully rationalizable or fully thinkable, will remain not fully thinkable or rationalizable on terms accepted or understood by the same multitude, and by its tribunes, upon whose acceptance its success, to their benefit, would depend.\n\nFor related reasons, whoever presumes to think through these matters openly, honestly, and impartially, is likely to be greeted (if recognized and heard at all), by some or perhaps a large measure of opposition and incomprehension, while being left to wonder which is worse.\n\nOne of my touchstones in regard to these issues is the work of Bob Altemeyer on “right-wing” authoritarian followers — a common cluster of political attitudes, which forms a type of sorts in the spectrum of human ambivalence. Altemeyer makes his book, The Authoritarians, available online as a free pdf.\n\nHe describes some social experiments, in which people, who score fairly high on an index of authoritarian attitudes, are sorted into various groups by themselves and mixed with others, with different attitudes, and asked to perform some task or play a game together. The results can be kind of scary. In particular, combining a bunch of authoritarian followers with a sociopathic social dominator in the leadership role — the lethal combination — is a recipe for catastrophe.\n\nOne thing I’ve gotten from reflecting on the results reported by Altemeyer is that liberal hegemony is a vitally important project — the left shouldn’t expect to make everyone into a true-believer liberal or social democrat (ain’t gonna happen), but it is vitally important to do everything we can to keep at least a large part of the population, who are inclined to be authoritarian followers, away from sociopathic demagogues. A modicum of hypocrisy in service to liberal hegemony is a good thing, and the manufacture of consent a necessary task.\n\ngeo might want to revise: “The myth of the market, of its superior efficiency and compatibility with freedom, [WAS] part of our ruling ideology.” The liberal hegemony of the immediate post-WWII era is an empty shell. We still say the words, but we all know their falsity. As James K Galbraith wrote in The Predator State, the right gave up on all that in the late 1980s, and the left mouths the words out of fear and lack of engaged imagination.\n\nI’m generally in agreement with john c. halasz @ 170 about what I would like American foreign policy to look like, though I’m not so sure that arguments from reason and evidence about practical expedience are likely to be effective. As Altemeyer points out, right-wing authoritarian followers are highly resistant to reason and evidence, as well as susceptible to demagogic leadership. Many American foreign policy institutions are heavily weighted in their personnel toward exactly the wrong kind of personalities, and practices — the culture of secrecy and censorship — compound the problem. It doesn’t help that Obama seems to think he gains credibility by giving Republicans and right-wing technocrats free rein in key positions. The culture inside the military-industrial complex seems increasingly paranoid and insular. digby at Hullabaloo had an interesting note the other day (3/18 11:00 AM): someone had caught the distinguished journalist, Tom Ricks, on twitter, playing McCarthy to Glenn Greenwald — cultivating his sources, no doubt. These institutions, by the psychopathology of their own cultures, make themselves invulnerable to criticism. No one is going to make a cliche out of calling the CIA, an institution of serial failure, though it certainly is, and consequently there’s little hope of reforming or dis-establishing it. Incompetence breeds competence.\n\nAnother thing I would note, in general, about American leadership post-Cold War. During the Cold War and immediate post-WWII period down to 1970, there were American leaders, who were genuinely interested in the country performing well. It was both a product of the competition with the Soviets, and an outcome of the experience of WWII facing societies gone mad. (The Soviets had had their own experience, which is why it remained, mostly, a cold war and a competition to perform.) If you look at the people JFK appointed into foreign policy roles, you see the concern for competence. Edwin O. Reischauer as Ambassador to Japan. Can anyone imagine Juan Cole at Yale, let alone as, say, Ambassador to Egypt?\n\nSometime, in the mid to late 1980s, America’s elite began to abandon their concern with competence or performance — not just in foreign policy, but across the economy. Merit was removed from the meritocracy, in favor of systematic disinvestment. This is a general phenomenon in American domestic life; it is why we live with so many potholes, and why Johnny can’t go to college without accepting a life of debt peonage. One of the weirder residuals of American exceptionalism is thinking the military, with their fancy toys, has been an exception to this process.\n\nThe same kind of rotted thinking that drives the fumbling and bumbling of American foreign policy drives the conversion from trickle-down economics to the belief that jobs and prosperity can be had from fracking.\n\n[Not as far from Carl Schmitt as it seems.]\n\ngeo @ 171:\n\nI’d thought we’d been through some of this above. “Morality” concerns personal conduct in private affairs. Political matters concern public issues and conflicts. One way to make out the distinction between morality and ethics is, as Ian Welsh puts it, morality concerns how you treat those you know, whereas ethics concerns how you treat those that you don’t know, though that’s a bit short-circuited. Another way to make out the distinction is that morality only deals with issues of “right and wrong”, whereas ethics concerns issues of the good or goods and the sustenance of social relations. Or ethics is about acts and material and symbolic exchanges with respect to relations with others qua other, i.e. completely separate human existences. (Which is one way that “utilitarianism” falls short: a perennial complaint is that it lacks any criterion for the differentiation or separation of persons). But the key there is that anything good or just or right involves an acknowledgement of the other, and a certain amount of estrangement from which such criteria would arise.\n\nIn addition, there must be a distinction between ethical norms, ( about rightness, goodness and justice) and norms about “truth” and cognition, (about facts, functions, and theoretical frameworks), which are separate normative “dimensions”. (Anything that involves the derivation and application of a concept is “normative”, insofar as concepts can be well or poorly derived and applied. One of the key problems with positivism is that, though it claims that scientific theory is the uniquely valid form of knowledge and the rest is just “poetry” or “emotion”, it lacks in principle the normative resources to “justify” such a claim).\n\nSo what is “wrong” with “morality, you ask? Well, for one thing, it takes a certain amount of “amorality” to pry apart ethical and cognitive claims to see how they might fit together, in variable patterns of inference and implication, rather than just assuming that they run together, undifferentiated, into some POV or another. And for another, moralistic claims can be just as egotistical as self-interested ones, (and the former can serve to disguise the latter), especially if held self-righteously, (which is a vice rather than a virtue). Moralism can be self-denying, insofar as it replaces the very other that is the “object” of its concern.\n\nBut to return to the basic topic here, as I said above, with respect to both Schmitt and Arendt, moralizing public-political issues renders them all the more irresolvable, “absolutizing” political conflict and rendering it potentially all the more “deadly”. Because politics involves potentially competing “moralities”, which aren’t resolvable by political means, and which distract from resolvable public-political issues. (Which distraction is often the point, “strategically”, in crafting “wedge” issues, for electoral manipulation, as with abortion or gay rights, both of which belong to the private domain). Moreover, a basic distinction between public-political issues and private domains is “necessary” to the preservation of both, if only because the private “household” domain raises future citizens, even if the public support or regulation of “household” affairs is “necessary” for maintaining any “just” public realm. (Needless to say, the invocation of the “private household” realm has nothing to do with the maintenance of “private” business corporations). So public “justice” can’t and mustn’t be reduced to private “morality”.\n\nAbsolute and inconceivable justice belongs to “God” alone, the voice in the whirlwind. Human worldly and political justice is always compromised and “corrupted”. That doesn’t mean that standards shouldn’t be applied and the heavens cursed, that emendation shouldn’t be achieved. But it does mean that political and economic conditions and constraints should be acknowledged. And that political judgments are of a mixed kind, not reducible to “morality” alone. They are “prudential” judgements, in an old-fashioned idiom, involving not just ethical considerations, (usually expressed as political “legitimation”, the required “operational” extent of which I questioned above, but also involving more cuttingly questions of the common and public “good”), but also matters of means/end relations, and estimates of prevailing power relations. In that sense, they are “expedient”. Which doesn’t involve short-sighted manipulation or opportunism, the usual excuses of “pragmatic” and “realistic” political operatives, including our fearless leaders, who seek to maintain the established status quo (ante), which gave rise to their “success”. But rather involves some “clarity” about what they or we are actually doing and what we’re willing to take responsibility for. But, hey, geo, I’m not the one advocating for “pragmatism” as the fount of democratic “morality”, and then expecting that reality will comply, least of all on account of an “anti-foundationalism”, which should prohibit any appeal to “first principles”.\n\nIf I’ve done any good here, it’s to have made out the distinction between “authoritarianism” and “authority”, especially to the left-of-liberal end of the political spectrum, to which I belong, which too often lazily conflates the two, forgetting that we all must assert our “authority”, rather than conceding it, even as finite human beings. And to have moved any readers off their priors, unsettling them, and causing them,- (though that’s not quite the right verb),- some mite of anxiety, (if never enough). If so, then I’ve done my job.\n\nB.W. @ 179:\n\nThe “original” study was “The Authoritarian Personality” by Adorno et alia. They used a “controversial” methodology of in-depth sociological interviews and “content analysis”. And they used anti-Japanese racism in CA during the War, as a proxy for German anti-semitism.\n\nI’ve read john c. halasz’s “lectures” here with great interest, but not much satisfaction.\n\nI have some interest in Carl Schmitt as an historical figure. I’m interested in political constitutions, and Schmitt seemed to have some genuine and profound insight into the pathologies of the Weimar state and its liberal, but apparently unworkable, constitution. That he stood on a reactionary’s ground just adds to my interest in trying to see the world thru his eyes, because, not despite, the fact that, speaking from my own POV, I regard his reactionary politics as malignant.\n\nI appreciate jch’s caution about detaching from early moral judgments in trying to understand Schmitt, but I think it isn’t our moral judgments about Schmitt, which are the major obstacle to understanding him, but our moral judgments about Weimar, as a failure of liberal democracy. It’s too easy to cast the actors in the liberal coalition as fallen heroes or betrayers, as the case may be, and in attaching moral meanings to their behavior — heavily colored by the horrors that followed — completely miss the functional shortcomings of liberal democracy revealed in the pathos of Weimar.\n\nLooking for the ultimate logical or causal foundation of legal authority is a bit of a mug’s game, when the “authority” in question is but a transparent veil cast over domination. It’s the organic relationship implied by a body politic ordered and identified by domination, which distinguishes liberalism from the reactionary’s (nostalgic or rentier’s) attachment to feudalism. Liberalism aims to free the ordinary individual from relationships of domination, removing privilege from the social order and elevating and girding the individual’s political autonomy with rights, etc., while theoretically rationalizing the state’s authority as a delegation of the natural and organic autonomy of the individual, mediated through some organic social organization, and serving, a public good, reducible ultimately, to the good of the individual. It’s the properties of that mediating social organization — the People in We, the People — that is ambiguous and in ill-defined dispute.\n\njch mentioned in passing the hostility of English liberalism to the Chartists, as evidence that liberalism was not always identified in the 19th century with aspirations to democracy. I think that mistakes the case. 19th century liberalism pursued reform in preference to revolution, offering as promissory notes, progress — a kind of debt incurred to buy peace; given the proven costs of revolutionary struggle, it was a sensible purchase, and the debt was paid, in a succession of reform acts, that worked a step-wise change in the British constitution that continued well into the 20th century.\n\nThe more important point, it seems to me, is that 19th century liberalism identified with nationalism: its projects for parliamentary, representative democracy was tied to the self-determination of “peoples”. It wasn’t always sensible — as when Gladstone championed the secession of the Confederacy — and it sometimes went badly wrong, as in the Hungarian case. Liberalism’s mediating “people” were nations, its parliamentary democracy the institutions of nation-states. I think Ian Welsh, (and his friend Stirling Newberry), are wrong about the definition of morality — there is a morality that attaches to the relationship of the individual to the nation to the state. It might be a mere analogue, on a different scale of course, to the morality of family, and it differs from ethics for sure, but the sense of membership in, deep identification with, a social corporate whole, of loyalty and obligation, transcending merely transactional dealings (where ethics rule), etc. is the ground, if not the foundation for the constitutional state.\n\nThere are definitely bastard liberalisms — left libertarian or anarchic and conservative libertarian — that want to simplify the logic of power, and reduce all good to private good. I have no sympathy with these views. With Arendt, I would say power is a property of social organization, just as strength is a property of the individual. The practical freedom of the individual isn’t the absence of the power, but an individual’s claim on power, as a member of a social organization, and claim on, share in, and recognition of a public good.\n\nSo, circling around to Schmitt, I suppose Schmitt could be taking advantage of bastard liberalisms to take some cheap shots. That’s not very interesting. But, it seems to me that his insights are much deeper than that, and much more specific to the shortcomings of European politics and liberalisms, in the aftermath of WWI. I question whether epistemological reflections are going to be a productive way to approach Schmitt or his critique of liberalism. The deep demoralization of German political culture might have had something to do with his views. I don’t know if we can understand without a lot more imaginative effort to comprehend the strongly felt tensions and weakly-held center of Weimar, and that means accepting an organic character for the body politic, which affects the identity and well-being of its members, and the shared psychology of the political culture, even if we don’t embrace the silliness of David Brooks, political romantic.\n\nSchmitt’s locating an existential origin story for politics in a pseudo-Hegelian antithesis of enmity is an interesting move for a reactionary mind. Think about how much effort has gone into Whiggish accounts of liberal progress and precedent stretching back to the 13th century or before. He does this in the specific context of a Germany, shorn of 900 years of institutional history, where a consensus to govern seems impossible to form.\n\nI cannot say I understand Schmitt’s pov, although I would like to. I think circumstances, and how the heat of those circumstances cooked the politics of his time, matter more than I can grasp.\n\njohn c. halasz: One of the basic questions Iâ€™ve been raising here is, just how much â€œlegitimationâ€ of â€œauthorityâ€ is required for any state to still â€œhold powerâ€, operatively function? . . . Or IOW what happens when the â€œlegitimationâ€ of a state collapses? . . . what happens in the resulting â€œvoidâ€? TINA? Perhaps bog-standard (neo-)liberals are as clueless as monarchist legitimists once were.\n\nI think liberals have always had a tendency to be a bit clueless about legitimacy, thinking it a bit of magic, an example of the power of symbolism and ritual. In this, they are not different from the monarchists, I guess. For the liberals, elections and numerical majorities and idealistic constitutions confer legitimacy; for the monarchists, genealogy and religious sacrament.\n\nIn practice, there’s a reflexive relationship between operative functioning, as you put it, and legitimacy. Lose a war, fail to collect taxes, debase the currency — in general, fail to make decisions that resolve conflicts and solve problems, allowing the conflicts to become chronic and the problems, acute — and the legitimacy of a ruling class or system erodes.\n\nFunctioning is not the same thing as quality of performance, though I’m not sure how to make the distinction. Politics is, per se, about resolving conflict — conflicts that are inherent in social cooperation — not about making the trains run on time, though that might be a bonus. Having the capacity to repress conflicts, or otherwise release the pressure, when conflicting claims add up to more than the total surplus, is critical.\n\nThe surplus is produced by social cooperation, and the total surplus might be larger under “fair” terms, conceived of, say, as the bargain made in free, competitive markets. This was the classic liberal claim. It’s why Adam Smith thought slavery “uneconomic”. The surplus might also be larger, if less of it is frittered away in disputes — this is, I presume, the point behind proposals to kill all the lawyers. And, it is quite possible for the ruling class to seek extraction, at a cost to others, disregarding entirely the theoretical possibility of a larger total surplus, because such a total could only be realized by reducing the relative or absolute share of a parasitic elite.\n\nThe state’s functional capacity for regulative violence and repression, often plays a dramatically prominent role, when it all unravels; it often gets cast as the Fat Lady singing the end of the Opera. For the Soviet Union, the security apparatus was the linchpin. Louis XVI did not have the troops. Papen took the Prussian police away from the Social Democrats (and Carl Schmitt confirmed it).\n\nBut, the reflexivity of the relationship between legitimacy and operative functioning remains key: the state must function, dynamically resolving conflicts, to remain legitimate, meaning that it must find ways to resolve conflicts that add up to more than the total surplus.\n\nRepression to reduce or isolate claims can work. My precious Whigs legitimated the Glorious Revolution — which wasn’t a revolution so much as an invasion and conquest by a foreign monarch aided by a cabal of highly-placed traitors — by systematically marginalizing in politics large swathes of the population by religious tests and class distinctions, even while mouthing pieties concerning universal rights and securing property rights. (My peeps! Gotta love their creativity!)\n\nOne way to see the Great Depression and New Deal is as a prolonged stalemate in the struggle over the distribution of income, in which the Second World War created a context for resolution. (The inability of macroeconomics to acknowledge conflicting interests might be its greatest intellectual handicap, and the source of its usefulness to the plutocracy as ideology. Just a passing thought.)\n\nIn the most advanced countries, the monetary and financial system forms an institutional core for distributing and regulating the value of claims to surplus, and, whether a safety valve exists or is used, depends on how those systems are structured and administered. Historically, the differing fates of the Bourbons and the House of Hanover, turned on the differing outcomes of the Mississippi Bubble and the South Sea Bubble. Britain ended up with a central bank, and its burgeoning national debt became ballast for the ship of state; France imported its bankers, and its debt caused the ship of state to capsize. More recently, the Euro has been used to put enormous pressure on the social welfare state. We’ll see how that works out for the legitimacy of the European Union.\n\nTINA? I think that’s more an inevitable tactic, in the herding of cats, than anything else. There are other tactics for coordinating consensus that inevitably resurrect the past. How long did the French go on reviving corvÃ©e after 1789? If we can still trace the boundaries of the Roman Empire across the Balkans, what does that tell us?\n\nThe most interesting case for eroding legitimacy may be that of neoliberalism in the U.S. at the present moment. American politics lacks any vocabulary but that of market liberalism, but no one believes it. The rich just take more and more and more, every day. To the point where billionaires are having paranoid fantasies about being rounded up for internment. And, the masses wonder what is eroding their precious freedom to shop.\n\nI expect js. thinks I’ve bulldozed all his distinctions. Oh, well.\n\nSorry j.s., you seem to have not understood a thing that’s going on here. It doesn’t boil down to the simple logical triplet of necessity, possibility, contingency. It’s not about “logic” at all. (Politics is fundamentally a *practical*, not a theoretical matter!) It’s about the strange “alchemy” of the political that goes on not just within but in-between people’s heads (and bodies) between “freedom”, “authority”, “legitimation”, “violence” and “power”. (That there can be stateless societies is not an issue, because such stateless societies have existed. Though not without any sort of “politics”: nowadays even chimpanzees have “politics”. Nor is it reducible to a merely functionalist matter, though B.W. often tends that way). The “argument” here has been about some fundamental questions and problems concerning the necessarily political existence of human being, that don’t have any simple, nor invariant answers, that always lurk in the background of such arrangements and always can re-emerge into the foreground, in cases of exacerbated conflict or crisis. It’s not about any simple “dialectic” of argument. Rather, in many of the comments here, it has actually been about the incomprehension and various evasions of those sorts of questions.\n\nAnd Anarcissie, least of all, hasn’t made much of an argument. (In many ways his apparent position is just sheerly anti-political in Arendt’s sense). To the notion that all political orders are potentially violent, he asserts that actual violence, quite adventitiously, must be periodically demonstrated to “prove” the existence of a political order. That’s rather like the sophism, that it is law that causes crime, because crimes must be defined by law, and without laws there would be no crimes. And thus all the obvious ills and injustices of this world, including complexity and differentiation itself, are to be wished away by fiat, because government. As I said, just rather hollow and snobbish attitudinizing.\n\nSchmitt obviously viewed politics as an especially high “vocation”, (though not necessarily the only such), but one needn’t share his preferences on that, as on much else. (I myself don’t pay much attention to daily “topical” political chatter, as pointless and manipulated propaganda, and tend to look on the current course of political affairs with some combination of disgust and horror). But if you ignore politics, that doesn’t mean that politics will ignore you.\n\nSO then you invoke the progress “we” have made in recognizing and protecting, (how?), the rights of minorities (or even majorities). But “rights” are political-legal institutions. Those who “possess” rights have already been invested by a system pf power. (There is a very real sense, in which they give you your rights, in order to take away your freedom: if you’ve ever been arrested, you know how that feels). Rights are only “inalienable”, (though never “natural”), in the sense that their violation doesn’t vitiate their (counterfactual) status as norms. (And inalienability was precisely said to be a distinguishing feature of “sovereignty”). My own view of the value of rights is not that they are “absolute”, (as if descending from the heavens), but that they enable a “higher”, more productive resolution, or, at least, pursuit of political conflict. But politics is pre-eminently the realm of alienation, of passing over into otherness, (which is why it is prey to resentment, anger, anxiety, hatred, and the like, and their manipulation). But insisting on “rights” as the sole “substance” of politics is curiously de-politicizing, (especially in international affairs). And the ever greater enumeration of rights does not somehow guarantee “progress”. To the contrary, not only might they serve to maintain entitlements, in the classic liberal fashion of perpetuating (“substantive”) inequality in the very name of (formal) equality, but they might just promote the “juridification” of political conflict, leading to the reversal of “substantive” progress. (I myself am Frankfurt Schoolish by origin, and everything in my political experience since I left school, at the beginning of the Reagan era, seems to confirm their post-War prognosis that the persistence of capitalism would mean ever-continuing forms of political regression). At any rate, rights are neither a substitute for, nor an explanation of the generation of social recognitions upon which the solidarities underpinning any political order depend.\n\nAnd no one has bothered to attempt to address a question I raised above. How can there be an effective public sphere without a sovereign state, which it would rise up against and purport to regulate, (even as the state balances out conflicting “parties”). Arendt herself notably evaded that problem. But then the public sphere is one of those things that is always already said to be in decline, the moment the issue is broached and arises.\n\nSchmitt is not exactly anyone’s cup of tea. But it’s the questions and problems he raises that persist, long after his demise. And no matter how nasty the man, that doesn’t permit a lack of hermeneutic probity is grappling with his work. At any rate, I just picked up from Macleod a reference to a contemporary thinker I didn’t know of:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_W._Kahn\n\nBut then, why is this thread still open? I thought they were all closed by automatic timer.\n\n(once more into the breach…)\n\n@241, Mattski, and Anarcissie and others: Following from the mention of Kahn’s work and specifically his focus on “sacrifice,” the link between faith and violence is more profound than a simple one-way transaction. I want to say more “complex,” but in another way the problem is that it’s so simple and immediate we have a hard time talking about it directly, even while we never actually stop talking about it. This connection also goes to the larger speculative discussion about the state-as-we-know-it and theoretical alternatives, and points to a particular liberal blind spot characteristic at least as much of those on the fringes of modern liberal discourse – anarchists, libertarians, communists, and their early modern precursors – as of those at the moderate and compromising center. This blind spot or possible blind spot is centrally evoked in the Schmittian challenge to liberalism, and understanding it might help to explain to claim that the political is uniquely defined by the potential for lethal violence.\n\nSetting aside Anarcissie’s presumption of a necessity for “arbitrary” exercises of power, the question of “blood sacrifice” attaches to the notion of a “higher” or “broader” (we might also say “more basic,” or “eternal,” etc.) meaning of life and death, the death or life that points beyond itself. The ability to demand and to perform an authentic sacrifice rests on the notion of a reason for being beyond “merely being” (also beyond “mere being”) or of a meaning of “life, liberty, pursuit of happiness/property” necessarily resting beyond the horizon of any individual’s own life, liberty, pursuit of happiness/property.\n\nThe political-theological not only meets but tends to overpower and overwhelm the political-philosophical, or the rational-liberal, on this ground, since the “side” whose believers will die and (usually) kill for their beliefs possesses distinct advantages in any actual political struggle over the side that cannot produce a reason for doing so, or, put differently, that depends on mere reason as understood within the limitations of liberal thought for doing so.\n\nThe same mechanism, the ability to act on “faith” and in mutual confidence, on a firm basis of shared and effectively reflexive expectations, and so on, supplies the historical solution of the coordination problem, in diverse settings – thus the common utilitarian justifications for religion (it gets the job done).
