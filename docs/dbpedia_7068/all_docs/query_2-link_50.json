But cold winters can still cause problems for energy systems, infrastructure, or human health. Here we tested whether a record-cold winter, such as the one observed in 1963 over central Europe, could still occur despite climate change. The answer is yes: it is possible, but it is very unlikely. Our results rely on climate model simulations and statistical rare event analysis. In conclusion, society must be prepared for such cold winters.\n\nRobust global detection of forced changes in mean and extreme precipitation despite observational disagreement on the magnitude of change\n\nIris Elisabeth de Vries, Sebastian Sippel, Angeline Greene Pendergrass, and Reto Knutti\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 81â€“100, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-81-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-81-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation change is an important consequence of climate change, but it is hard to detect and quantify. Our intuitive method yields robust and interpretable detection of forced precipitation change in three observational datasets for global mean and extreme precipitation, but the different observational datasets show different magnitudes of forced change. Assessment and reduction of uncertainties surrounding forced precipitation change are important for future projections and adaptation.\n\nInterannual global carbon cycle variations linked to atmospheric circulation variability\n\nNa Li, Sebastian Sippel, Alexander J. Winkler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Markus Reichstein, and Ana Bastos\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1505â€“1533, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the imprint of large-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics and associated carbon cycle responses is key to improving our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics. Using a statistical model that relies on spatiotemporal sea level pressure as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric circulation, we quantify the fraction of interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the land CO2 sink that are driven by atmospheric circulation variability.\n\nLatent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder v1.0: a novel method for estimating and emulating dynamic precipitation at high resolution\n\nChristina Heinze-Deml, Sebastian Sippel, Angeline G.

We introduce a novel statistical model (Latent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder) that combines the flexibility of deep neural networks with the robustness advantages of linear regression. The method enables estimation of the contribution of a coarse-scale atmospheric circulation proxy to daily precipitation at high resolution and in a spatially coherent manner.\n\nVegetation modulates the impact of climate extremes on gross primary production\n\nMilan Flach, Alexander Brenning, Fabian Gans, Markus Reichstein, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 39â€“53, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought and heat events affect the uptake and sequestration of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. We study the impact of droughts and heatwaves on the uptake of CO2 of different vegetation types at the global scale. We find that agricultural areas are generally strongly affected. Forests instead are not particularly sensitive to the events under scrutiny. This implies different water management strategies of forests but also a lack of sensitivity to remote-sensing-derived vegetation activity.\n\nSynoptic-scale controls of fog and low-cloud variability in the Namib Desert\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Julia Fuchs, Peter Knippertz, Marco Gaetani, Julian Quinting, Sebastian Sippel, and Roland Vogt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 3415â€“3438, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are an essential but poorly understood element of Namib regional climate. Here, a satellite-based data set of FLCs in central Namib, reanalysis data, and back trajectories are used to systematically analyze conditions when FLCs occur. Synoptic-scale mechanisms are identified that influence the formation of FLCs and the onshore advection of marine boundary-layer air masses. The findings lead to a new conceptual model of mechanisms that drive FLC variability in the Namib.\n\nAsymmetric responses of primary productivity to altered precipitation simulated by ecosystem models across three long-term grassland sites\n\nDonghai Wu, Philippe Ciais, Nicolas Viovy, Alan K.

Collaboration between modelers and site investigators needs to be strengthened to improve the specific processes in ecosystem models in following studies.\n\nImpacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones\n\nJannis von Buttlar, Jakob Zscheischler, Anja Rammig, Sebastian Sippel, Markus Reichstein, Alexander Knohl, Martin Jung, Olaf Menzer, M.

Scott, Francesco P. Vaccari, Eva van Gorsel, Andrej Varlagin, Georg Wohlfahrt, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1293â€“1318, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work systematically quantifies extreme heat and drought event impacts on gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration globally across a wide range of ecosystems. We show that heat extremes typically increased mainly respiration whereas drought decreased both fluxes. Combined heat and drought extremes had opposing effects offsetting each other for respiration, but there were also strong reductions in GPP and hence the strongest reductions in the ecosystems carbon sink capacity.\n\nReverse engineering model structures for soil and ecosystem respiration: the potential of gene expression programming\n\nIulia Ilie, Peter Dittrich, Nuno Carvalhais, Martin Jung, Andreas Heinemeyer, Mirco Migliavacca, James I. L. Morison, Sebastian Sippel, Jens-Arne Subke, Matthew Wilkinson, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 3519â€“3545, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3519-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3519-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate representation of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes is essential for future climate projections, although some of the responses of CO2 fluxes to climate often remain uncertain. The increase in available data allows for new approaches in their modelling. We automatically developed models for ecosystem and soil carbon respiration using a machine learning approach. When compared with established respiration models, we found that they are better in prediction as well as offering new insights.\n\nDetecting impacts of extreme events with ecological inÃ‚ situ monitoring networks\n\nMiguel D. Mahecha, Fabian Gans, Sebastian Sippel, Jonathan F. Donges, Thomas Kaminski, Stefan Metzger, Mirco Migliavacca, Dario Papale, Anja Rammig, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 4255â€“4277, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the likelihood of ecological in situ networks to detect and monitor the impact of extreme events in the terrestrial biosphere.\n\nMultivariate anomaly detection for Earth observations: a comparison of algorithms and feature extraction techniques\n\nMilan Flach, Fabian Gans, Alexander Brenning, Joachim Denzler, Markus Reichstein, Erik Rodner, Sebastian Bathiany, Paul Bodesheim, Yanira Guanche, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 677â€“696, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnomalies and extremes are often detected using univariate peak-over-threshold approaches in the geoscience community. The Earth system is highly multivariate. We compare eight multivariate anomaly detection algorithms and combinations of data preprocessing. We identify three anomaly detection algorithms that outperform univariate extreme event detection approaches. The workflows have the potential to reveal novelties in data. Remarks on their application to real Earth observations are provided.\n\nRefining multi-model projections of temperature extremes by evaluation against landâ€“atmosphere coupling diagnostics\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Rene Orth, Markus Reichstein, Martha Vogel, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 387â€“403, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study (1) evaluates landâ€“atmosphere coupling in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble against an ensemble of benchmarking datasets and (2) refines the model ensemble using a landâ€“atmosphere coupling diagnostic as constraint. Our study demonstrates that a considerable fraction of coupled climate models overemphasize warm-season moisture-limited climate regimes in midlatitude regions. This leads to biases in daily-scale temperature extremes, which are alleviated in a constrained ensemble.\n\nA novel bias correction methodology for climate impact simulations\n\nS. Sippel, F. E. L.

The methodology considerably improves the representation of extremes in climatic variables relative to conventional bias correction strategies. Illustrative simulations of biosphereâ€“atmosphere carbon and water fluxes with a biosphere model (LPJmL) show that the novel technique can be usefully applied to drive climate impact models.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Current perspectives on biosphere research â€“ 2024\n\nFriedrich J.

Within these themes, they discuss issues arising from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, and highlight the co-benefits of nature-based solutions and ecosystem services. They discuss recent findings in the context of global trade and international policy frameworks, and highlight lessons for local implementation of nature-based solutions.\n\nTechnical Note: The divide and measure nonconformity Ã¢Â€Â“ how metrics can mislead when we evaluate on different data partitions\n\nDaniel Klotz, Martin Gauch, Frederik Kratzert, Grey Nearing, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 3665â€“3673, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3665-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3665-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evaluation of model performance is essential for hydrological modeling. Using performance criteria requires a deep understanding of their properties. We focus on a counterintuitive aspect of the Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and show that if we divide the data into multiple parts, the overall performance can be higher than all the evaluations of the subsets. Although this follows from the definition of the NSE, the resulting behavior can have unintended consequences in practice.\n\nCould an extremely cold central European winter such as 1963 happen again despite climate change?\n\nSebastian Sippel, Clair Barnes, Camille Cadiou, Erich Fischer, Sarah Kew, Marlene Kretschmer, Sjoukje Philip, Theodore G.

Several studies have assessed changes in CUP based on seasonal metrics from CO2 mole fraction measurements to understand the response of terrestrial biosphere to climate variations.

Heat extremes are mostly introduced by large-scale atmospheric circulation but can be modulated by vegetation. Vegetation with access to water uses solar energy to evaporate water into the atmosphere. Under dry conditions, water may not be available, suppressing evaporation and heating the atmosphere. Using climate projections, we show that regionally less water is available for vegetation, intensifying future heat extremes.\n\nTextÃ‚ mining uncovers the unique dynamics of socio-economic impacts of the 2018Ã¢Â€Â“2022 multi-year drought in Germany\n\nJan Sodoge, Christian Kuhlicke, Miguel D.

We derived a dataset covering the impacts of droughts in Germany between 2000 and 2022 on sectors such as agriculture and forestry based on newspaper articles. Notably, our study illustrated that the longer drought had a wider reach and more varied effects. We show that dealing with longer droughts requires different plans compared to shorter ones, and it is crucial to be ready for the challenges they bring.\n\nEarth Virtualization Engines (EVE)\n\nBjorn Stevens, Stefan Adami, Tariq Ali, Hartwig Anzt, Zafer Aslan, Sabine Attinger, Jaana BÃƒÂ¤ck, Johanna Baehr, Peter Bauer, Natacha Bernier, Bob Bishop, Hendryk Bockelmann, Sandrine Bony, Guy Brasseur, David N.

Paulus, Rene Orth, Sung-Ching Lee, Anke Hildebrandt, Martin Jung, Jacob A. Nelson, Tarek Sebastian El-Madany, Arnaud Carrara, Gerardo Moreno, Matthias Mauder, Jannis Groh, Alexander Graf, Markus Reichstein, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2051â€“2085, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2051-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2051-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPorous materials are known to reversibly trap water from the air, even at low humidity. However, this behavior is poorly understood for soils. In this analysis, we test whether eddy covariance is able to measure the so-called adsorption of atmospheric water vapor by soils. We find that this flux occurs frequently during dry nights in a Mediterranean ecosystem, while EC detects downwardly directed vapor fluxes. These results can help to map moisture uptake globally.\n\nThe perfect storm? Co-occurring climate extremes in East Africa\n\nDerrick Muheki, Axel A. J.

Here we investigate the joint occurrence of pairs of river floods, droughts, heatwaves, crop failures, wildfires, and tropical cyclones in East Africa under past and future climate conditions. Our results show that, across all future warming scenarios, the frequency and spatial extent of these co-occurring extremes will increase in this region, particularly in areas close to the Nile and Congo rivers.\n\nTechnical note: Flagging inconsistencies in flux tower data\n\nMartin Jung, Jacob Nelson, Mirco Migliavacca, Tarek El-Madany, Dario Papale, Markus Reichstein, Sophia Walther, and Thomas Wutzler\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1827â€“1846, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1827-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1827-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a methodology to detect inconsistencies in perhaps the most important data source for measurements of ecosystemâ€“atmosphere carbon, water, and energy fluxes. We expect that the derived consistency flags will be relevant for data users and will help in improving our understanding of and our ability to model ecosystemâ€“climate interactions.\n\nPossible role of anthropogenic climate change in the record-breaking 2020 Lake Victoria levels and floods\n\nRosa Pietroiusti, Inne Vanderkelen, Friederike E.

In this study, we characterize the spatial extent and impacts of the floods in the Lake Victoria basin and investigate how human-induced climate change influenced the probability and intensity of the record-breaking lake levels and flooding by applying a multi-model extreme event attribution methodology.\n\nDeepPhenoMem V1.0: Deep learning modelling of canopy greenness dynamics accounting for multi-variate meteorological memory effects on vegetation phenology\n\nGuohua Liu, Mirco Migliavacca, Christian Reimers, Basil Kraft, Markus Reichstein, Andrew Richardson, Lisa Wingate, Nicolas Delpierre, Hui Yang, and Alexander Winkler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-464,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-464, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model canopy greenness and phenology, integrating meteorological memory effects. LSTM model outperforms traditional methods, enhancing accuracy in predicting greenness dynamics and phenological transitions across plant functional types.

To address this, we create a model with a dual constraint based on bottom-up eddy-covariance data and top-down atmospheric inversion data. Our model overcomes shortcomings of each approach, producing improved NEE estimates from local to global scale, helping to reduce uncertainty in the carbon budget.\n\nDetecting the human fingerprint in the summer 2022 westernÃ¢Â€Â“central European soil drought\n\nDominik L.

Combining several observation-based estimates and models, we find that such an event has become at least 5 and 20 times more likely due to human-induced climate change in western Europe and the northern extratropics, respectively. Strong regional warming fuels soil desiccation; hence, projections indicate even more potent future droughts as we progress towards a 2 Â°C warmer world.\n\nX-BASE: the first terrestrial carbon and water flux products from an extended data-driven scaling framework, FLUXCOM-X\n\nJacob A.

Here we outline a method to estimate global water and CO2 fluxes based on direct measurements from site around the world called FLUXCOM-X. We go on to demonstrate how these new estimates of net CO2 uptake/loss, gross CO2 uptake, total water evaporation, and transpiration from plants compare to previous and independent estimates.\n\nDrought counteracts soil warming more strongly in the subsoil than in the topsoil according to a vertical microbial SOC model\n\nMarleen Pallandt, Marion Schrumpf, Holger Lange, Markus Reichstein, Lin Yu, and Bernhard Ahrens\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-186,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-186, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs soils get warmer due to climate change, SOC decomposes faster because of higher microbial activity, but only with sufficient soil moisture. We modelled how microbes decompose plant litter and microbial residues at different soil depths. We found that deep soil layers are more sensitive than topsoils. SOC is lost from the soil with warming, but this can be mitigated or worsened depending on the type of litter and its sensitivity to temperature. Droughts can reduce warming-induced SOC losses.\n\nAn increase in the spatial extent of European floods over the last 70 years\n\nBeijing Fang, Emanuele Bevacqua, Oldrich Rakovec, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2890,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2890, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use grid-based runoff from a hydrological model to identify large spatiotemporally connected flood events in Europe, assess extents' trends over the last 70 years, and attribute the trends to different drivers. Our findings reveal a general increase in flood extent, with regional variations driven by diverse factors. The study not only enables a thorough examination of flood events across multiple basins but also highlights the potential challenges arising from changing flood extents.\n\nCautionary Remarks on the Planetary Boundary Visualisation\n\nMiguel D.

We identify three aspects that can lead to misleading interpretations: 1) exaggeration of effect size, 2) complex colour patterns, and 3) combined effects that could potentially overstate certain risks. We suggest revising these visual elements to improve accuracy in communicating this important concept.\n\nNitrogen Availability and Summer Drought, but not N:P Imbalance Drive Carbon Use Efficiency of a Mediterranean Tree-Grass Ecosystem\n\nRichard Nair, Yunpeng Luo, Tarek El-Madany, Victor Rolo, Javier Pacheco-Labrador, Silvia Caldararu, Kendalynn A. Morris, Marion Schrumpf, Arnaud Carrara, Gerardo Moreno, Markus Reichstein, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2434,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2434, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied a Mediterranean ecosystem to understand carbon uptake efficiency and its controls. These ecosystems face potential nitrogen-phosphorus imbalances due to pollution. Analysing six years of carbon data, we assessed controls at different timeframes. This is crucial for predicting such vulnerable regions. Our findings revealed N limitation on C uptake, not N:P imbalance, and strong influence of water availability. whether drought or wetness promoted net C uptake depended on timescale.\n\nLearning Extreme Vegetation Response to Climate Forcing: A Comparison of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures\n\nFrancesco Martinuzzi, Miguel D. Mahecha, Gustau Camps-Valls, David Montero, Tristan Williams, and Karin Mora\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2368,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2368, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated how machine learning can forecast extreme vegetation responses to weather. Examining four models, no single one stood out as the best, though \"echo state networks\" showed minor advantages. Our results indicate that while these tools are able to generally model vegetation states, they face challenges under extreme conditions. This underlines the potential of artificial intelligence in ecosystem modeling, also pinpointing areas that need further research.\n\nReducing errors on estimates of the carbon uptake period based on time series of atmospheric CO2\n\nTheertha Kariyathan, Ana Bastos, Julia Marshall, Wouter Peters, Pieter Tans, and Markus Reichstein\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 3299â€“3312, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3299-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3299-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe timing and duration of the carbon uptake period (CUP) are sensitive to the occurrence of major phenological events, which are influenced by recent climate change. This study presents an ensemble-based approach for quantifying the timing and duration of the CUP and their uncertainty when derived from atmospheric CO2 measurements with noise and gaps. The CUP metrics derived with the approach are more robust and have less uncertainty than when estimated with the conventional methods.\n\nDiagnosing modeling errors in global terrestrial water storage interannual variability\n\nHoontaek Lee, Martin Jung, Nuno Carvalhais, Tina Trautmann, Basil Kraft, Markus Reichstein, Matthias Forkel, and Sujan Koirala\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We find error hotspot regions that show a disproportionately large significance in the global mismatch and the association of the error regions with a smaller-scale lateral convergence of water. Our findings imply that TWS IAV modeling can be efficiently improved by focusing on model representations for the error hotspots.\n\nHuman influence on growing-period frosts like in early April 2021 in central France\n\nRobert Vautard, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, RÃƒÂ©my Bonnet, Sihan Li, Yoann Robin, Sarah Kew, Sjoukje Philip, Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, Brigitte Dubuisson, Nicolas Viovy, Markus Reichstein, Friederike Otto, and IÃƒÂ±aki Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

We found that such extreme frosts occurring after the start of the growing season such as those of April 2021 are currently about 2Â°C colder [0.5 Â°C to 3.3 Â°C] in observations than in preindustrial climate. This observed intensification of growing-period frosts is attributable, at least in part, to human-caused climate change, making the 2021 event 50 % more likely [10 %â€“110 %].\n\nRobust global detection of forced changes in mean and extreme precipitation despite observational disagreement on the magnitude of change\n\nIris Elisabeth de Vries, Sebastian Sippel, Angeline Greene Pendergrass, and Reto Knutti\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 81â€“100, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-81-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-81-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation change is an important consequence of climate change, but it is hard to detect and quantify. Our intuitive method yields robust and interpretable detection of forced precipitation change in three observational datasets for global mean and extreme precipitation, but the different observational datasets show different magnitudes of forced change. Assessment and reduction of uncertainties surrounding forced precipitation change are important for future projections and adaptation.\n\nRiver flooding mechanisms and their changes in Europe revealed by explainable machine learning\n\nShijie Jiang, Emanuele Bevacqua, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6339â€“6359, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6339-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6339-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a novel explainable machine learning approach, we investigated the contributions of precipitation, temperature, and day length to different peak discharges, thereby uncovering three primary flooding mechanisms widespread in European catchments. The results indicate that flooding mechanisms have changed in numerous catchments over the past 70 years. The study highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in revealing complex changes in extreme events related to climate change.\n\nHotspots and drivers of compound marine heatwaves and low net primary production extremes\n\nNatacha Le Grix, Jakob Zscheischler, Keith B. Rodgers, Ryohei Yamaguchi, and Thomas L.

Here, we investigate the potentially harmful combination of marine heatwaves with low phytoplankton productivity. Using satellite-based observations, we show that these compound events are frequent in the low latitudes. We then investigate the drivers of these compound events using Earth system models. The models share similar drivers in the low latitudes but disagree in the high latitudes due to divergent factors limiting phytoplankton production.\n\nResolving seasonal and diel dynamics of non-rainfall water inputs in a Mediterranean ecosystem using lysimeters\n\nSinikka Jasmin Paulus, Tarek Sebastian El-Madany, RenÃƒÂ© Orth, Anke Hildebrandt, Thomas Wutzler, Arnaud Carrara, Gerardo Moreno, Oscar Perez-Priego, Olaf Kolle, Markus Reichstein, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nHydrol.

To measure them, we use a scaling system and later test our attribution of different water fluxes to weight changes. We found that they occur frequently during 1 year in a dry summer ecosystem. In each season, a different flux seems dominant, but they all mainly occur during the night. Therefore, they could be important for the biosphere because rain is unevenly distributed over the year.\n\nRapid attribution analysis of the extraordinary heat wave on the Pacific coast of the US and Canada in JuneÃ‚ 2021\n\nSjoukje Y.

This attribution study found such a severe heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change. Assuming no nonlinear interactions, such events have become at least 150 times more common, are about 2 Â°C hotter and will become even more common as warming continues. Therefore, adaptation and mitigation are urgently needed to prepare society.\n\nInterannual global carbon cycle variations linked to atmospheric circulation variability\n\nNa Li, Sebastian Sippel, Alexander J.

Using a statistical model that relies on spatiotemporal sea level pressure as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric circulation, we quantify the fraction of interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the land CO2 sink that are driven by atmospheric circulation variability.\n\nExploring the relationship between temperature forecast errors and Earth system variables\n\nMelissa Ruiz-VÃƒÂ¡squez, Sungmin O, Alexander Brenning, Randal D.

We find that global temperature forecast errors in many regions are related to climate variables such as solar radiation and precipitation, as well as land surface variables such as soil moisture and evaporative fraction. A better representation of these variables in the forecasting and data assimilation systems can support the accuracy of temperature forecasts.\n\nContrasting drought legacy effects on gross primary productivity in a mixed versus pure beech forest\n\nXin Yu, RenÃƒÂ© Orth, Markus Reichstein, Michael Bahn, Anne Klosterhalfen, Alexander Knohl, Franziska Koebsch, Mirco Migliavacca, Martina Mund, Jacob A. Nelson, Benjamin D. Stocker, Sophia Walther, and Ana Bastos\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4315â€“4329, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4315-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4315-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIdentifying drought legacy effects is challenging because they are superimposed on variability driven by climate conditions in the recovery period. We develop a residual-based approach to quantify legacies on gross primary productivity (GPP) from eddy covariance data. The GPP reduction due to legacy effects is comparable to the concurrent effects at two sites in Germany, which reveals the importance of legacy effects. Our novel methodology can be used to quantify drought legacies elsewhere.\n\nSPECTRAL: AWESOME SPECTRAL INDICES DEPLOYED VIA THE GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE JAVASCRIPT API\n\nD. Montero, C. Aybar, M. D.

Gilford, Andrew Pershing, Benjamin H. Strauss, Karsten Haustein, and Friederike E. L. Otto\n\nAdv. Stat. Clim. Meteorol. Oceanogr., 8, 135â€“154, https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-8-135-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-8-135-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a framework to produce global real-time estimates of how human-caused climate change affects the likelihood of daily weather events. A multi-method approach provides ensemble attribution estimates accompanied by confidence intervals, creating new opportunities for climate change communication. Methodological efficiency permits daily analysis using forecasts or observations. Applications with daily maximum temperature highlight the framework's capacity on daily and global scales.\n\nOn the links between sub-seasonal clustering of extreme precipitation and high discharge in Switzerland and Europe\n\nAlexandre Tuel, Bettina Schaefli, Jakob Zscheischler, and Olivia Martius\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2649â€“2669, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRiver discharge is strongly influenced by the temporal structure of precipitation. Here, we show how extreme precipitation events that occur a few days or weeks after a previous event have a larger effect on river discharge than events occurring in isolation. Windows of 2 weeks or less between events have the most impact. Similarly, periods of persistent high discharge tend to be associated with the occurrence of several extreme precipitation events in close succession.\n\nInvited perspectives: A research agenda towards disaster risk management pathways in multi-(hazard-)risk assessment\n\nPhilip J.

Sci., 22, 1487â€“1497, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1487-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1487-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe majority of natural-hazard risk research focuses on single hazards (a flood, a drought, a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, etc.). In the international research and policy community it is recognised that risk management could benefit from a more systemic approach. In this perspective paper, we argue for an approach that addresses multi-hazard, multi-risk management through the lens of sustainability challenges that cut across sectors, regions, and hazards.\n\nThe effects of varying drought-heat signatures on terrestrial carbon dynamics and vegetation composition\n\nElisabeth Tschumi, Sebastian Lienert, Karin van der Wiel, Fortunat Joos, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1979â€“1993, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1979-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1979-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts and heatwaves are expected to occur more often in the future, but their effects on land vegetation and the carbon cycle are poorly understood. We use six climate scenarios with differing extreme occurrences and a vegetation model to analyse these effects. Tree coverage and associated plant productivity increase under a climate with no extremes. Frequent co-occurring droughts and heatwaves decrease plant productivity more than the combined effects of single droughts or heatwaves.\n\nTowards hybrid modeling of the global hydrological cycle\n\nBasil Kraft, Martin Jung, Marco KÃƒÂ¶rner, Sujan Koirala, and Markus Reichstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1579â€“1614, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1579-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1579-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a physics-aware machine learning model of the global hydrological cycle. As the model uses neural networks under the hood, the simulations of the water cycle are learned from data, and yet they are informed and constrained by physical knowledge. The simulated patterns lie within the range of existing hydrological models and are plausible. The hybrid modeling approach has the potential to tackle key environmental questions from a novel perspective.\n\nEVALUATING THE POTENTIAL OF DESIS TO INFER PLANT TAXONOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITIES IN EUROPEAN FORESTS\n\nJ.

McGuire, Sungmin O, Julia Pongratz, and Stephen Sitch\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1015â€“1035, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1015-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1015-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTemperate biomes in Europe are not prone to recurrent dry and hot conditions in summer. However, these conditions may become more frequent in the coming decades. Because stress conditions can leave legacies for many years, this may result in reduced ecosystem resilience under recurrent stress. We assess vegetation vulnerability to the hot and dry summers in 2018 and 2019 in Europe and find the important role of inter-annual legacy effects from 2018 in modulating the impacts of the 2019 event.\n\nLatent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder v1.0: a novel method for estimating and emulating dynamic precipitation at high resolution\n\nChristina Heinze-Deml, Sebastian Sippel, Angeline G. Pendergrass, Flavio Lehner, and Nicolai Meinshausen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 4977â€“4999, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4977-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4977-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying dynamical and thermodynamical components of regional precipitation change is a key challenge in climate science. We introduce a novel statistical model (Latent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder) that combines the flexibility of deep neural networks with the robustness advantages of linear regression. The method enables estimation of the contribution of a coarse-scale atmospheric circulation proxy to daily precipitation at high resolution and in a spatially coherent manner.\n\nAttribution of the role of climate change in the forest fires in Sweden 2018\n\nFolmer Krikken, Flavio Lehner, Karsten Haustein, Igor Drobyshev, and Geert Jan van Oldenborgh\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2169â€“2179, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2169-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2169-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we analyse the role of climate change in the forest fires that raged through large parts of Sweden in the summer of 2018 from a meteorological perspective. This is done by studying observationally constrained data and multiple climate models. We find a small reduced probability of such events, based on reanalyses, but a small increased probability due to global warming up to now and a more robust increase in the risk for such events in the future, based on climate models.\n\nTowards a compound-event-oriented climate model evaluation: a decomposition of the underlying biases in multivariate fire and heat stress hazards\n\nRoberto Villalobos-Herrera, Emanuele Bevacqua, Andreia F. S. Ribeiro, Graeme Auld, Laura Crocetti, Bilyana Mircheva, Minh Ha, Jakob Zscheischler, and Carlo De Michele\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1867â€“1885, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1867-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1867-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate hazards may be caused by events which have multiple drivers. Here we present a method to break down climate model biases in hazard indicators down to the bias caused by each driving variable. Using simplified fire and heat stress indicators driven by temperature and relative humidity as examples, we show how multivariate indicators may have complex biases and that the relationship between driving variables is a source of bias that must be considered in climate model bias corrections.\n\nFunctional convergence of biosphereÃ¢Â€Â“atmosphere interactions in response to meteorological conditions\n\nChristopher Krich, Mirco Migliavacca, Diego G. Miralles, Guido Kraemer, Tarek S. El-Madany, Markus Reichstein, Jakob Runge, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2379â€“2404, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2379-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2379-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEcosystems and the atmosphere interact with each other. These interactions determine e.g. the water and carbon fluxes and thus are crucial to understand climate change effects. We analysed the interactions for many ecosystems across the globe, showing that very different ecosystems can have similar interactions with the atmosphere. Meteorological conditions seem to be the strongest interaction-shaping factor. This means that common principles can be identified to describe ecosystem behaviour.\n\nA standardized index for assessing sub-monthly compound dry and hot conditions with application in China\n\nJun Li, Zhaoli Wang, Xushu Wu, Jakob Zscheischler, Shenglian Guo, and Xiaohong Chen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1587â€“1601, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1587-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1587-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a daily-scale index, termed the standardized compound drought and heat index (SCDHI), to measure the key features of compound dry-hot conditions. SCDHI can not only monitor the long-term compound dry-hot events, but can also capture such events at sub-monthly scale and reflect the related vegetation activity impacts. The index can provide a new tool to quantify sub-monthly characteristics of compound dry-hot events, which are vital for releasing early and timely warning.\n\nCompound high-temperature and low-chlorophyll extremes in the ocean over the satellite period\n\nNatacha Le Grix, Jakob Zscheischler, Charlotte LaufkÃƒÂ¶tter, Cecile S. Rousseaux, and Thomas L. FrÃƒÂ¶licher\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2119â€“2137, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2119-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2119-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine ecosystems could suffer severe damage from the co-occurrence of a marine heat wave with extremely low chlorophyll concentration. Here, we provide a first assessment of compound marine heat wave and low-chlorophyll events in the global ocean from 1998 to 2018. We reveal hotspots of these compound events in the equatorial Pacific and in the Arabian Sea and show that they mostly occur in summer at high latitudes and their frequency is modulated by large-scale modes of climate variability.\n\nAttribution of the Australian bushfire risk to anthropogenic climate change\n\nGeert Jan van Oldenborgh, Folmer Krikken, Sophie Lewis, Nicholas J. Leach, Flavio Lehner, Kate R. Saunders, Michiel van Weele, Karsten Haustein, Sihan Li, David Wallom, Sarah Sparrow, Julie Arrighi, Roop K. Singh, Maarten K. van Aalst, Sjoukje Y. Philip, Robert Vautard, and Friederike E. L. Otto\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 941â€“960, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-941-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-941-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoutheastern Australia suffered from disastrous bushfires during the 2019/20 fire season, raising the question whether these have become more likely due to climate change. We found no attributable trend in extreme annual or monthly low precipitation but a clear shift towards more extreme heat. However, this shift is underestimated by the models. Analysing fire weather directly, we found that the chance has increased by at least 30 %, but due to the underestimation it could well be higher.\n\nIdentifying meteorological drivers of extreme impacts: an application to simulated crop yields\n\nJohannes Vogel, Pauline Rivoire, Cristina Deidda, Leila Rahimi, Christoph A. Sauter, Elisabeth Tschumi, Karin van der Wiel, Tianyi Zhang, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 151â€“172, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-151-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-151-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a statistical approach for automatically identifying multiple drivers of extreme impacts based on LASSO regression. We apply the approach to simulated crop failure in the Northern Hemisphere and identify which meteorological variables including climate extreme indices and which seasons are relevant to predict crop failure. The presented approach can help unravel compounding drivers in high-impact events and could be applied to other impacts such as wildfires or flooding.\n\nRetrieval and validation of forest background reflectivity from daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data across European forests\n\nJan Pisek, Angela Erb, Lauri Korhonen, Tobias Biermann, Arnaud Carrara, Edoardo Cremonese, Matthias Cuntz, Silvano Fares, Giacomo Gerosa, Thomas GrÃƒÂ¼nwald, Niklas Hase, Michal Heliasz, Andreas Ibrom, Alexander Knohl, Johannes Kobler, Bart Kruijt, Holger Lange, Leena LeppÃƒÂ¤nen, Jean-Marc Limousin, Francisco Ramon Lopez Serrano, Denis Loustau, Petr LukeÃ…Â¡, Lars Lundin, Riccardo Marzuoli, Meelis MÃƒÂ¶lder, Leonardo Montagnani, Johan Neirynck, Matthias Peichl, Corinna Rebmann, Eva Rubio, Margarida Santos-Reis, Crystal Schaaf, Marius Schmidt, Guillaume Simioni, Kamel Soudani, and Caroline Vincke\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 621â€“635, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-621-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-621-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstory vegetation is the most diverse, least understood component of forests worldwide. Understory communities are important drivers of overstory succession and nutrient cycling. Multi-angle remote sensing enables us to describe surface properties by means that are not possible when using mono-angle data. Evaluated over an extensive set of forest ecosystem experimental sites in Europe, our reported method can deliver good retrievals, especially over different forest types with open canopies.\n\nImpact of precipitation and increasing temperatures on drought trends in eastern Africa\n\nSarah F. Kew, Sjoukje Y. Philip, Mathias Hauser, Mike Hobbins, Niko Wanders, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Karin van der Wiel, Ted I. E. Veldkamp, Joyce Kimutai, Chris Funk, and Friederike E. L. Otto\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 17â€“35, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-17-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-17-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMotivated by the possible influence of rising temperatures, this study synthesises results from observations and climate models to explore trends (1900â€“2018) in eastern African (EA) drought measures. However, no discernible trends are found in annual soil moisture or precipitation. Positive trends in potential evaporation indicate that for irrigated regions more water is now required to counteract increased evaporation. Precipitation deficit is, however, the most useful indicator of EA drought.\n\nEvaluating the dependence structure of compound precipitation and wind speed extremes\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Philippe Naveau, Olivia Martius, Sebastian Engelke, and Christoph C. Raible\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1â€“16, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCompound extremes such as heavy precipitation and extreme winds can lead to large damage. To date it is unclear how well climate models represent such compound extremes. Here we present a new measure to assess differences in the dependence structure of bivariate extremes. This measure is applied to assess differences in the dependence of compound precipitation and wind extremes between three model simulations and one reanalysis dataset in a domain in central Europe.\n\nVegetation modulates the impact of climate extremes on gross primary production\n\nMilan Flach, Alexander Brenning, Fabian Gans, Markus Reichstein, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 39â€“53, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-39-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought and heat events affect the uptake and sequestration of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. We study the impact of droughts and heatwaves on the uptake of CO2 of different vegetation types at the global scale. We find that agricultural areas are generally strongly affected. Forests instead are not particularly sensitive to the events under scrutiny. This implies different water management strategies of forests but also a lack of sensitivity to remote-sensing-derived vegetation activity.\n\nA protocol for probabilistic extreme event attribution analyses\n\nSjoukje Philip, Sarah Kew, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike Otto, Robert Vautard, Karin van der Wiel, Andrew King, Fraser Lott, Julie Arrighi, Roop Singh, and Maarten van Aalst\n\nAdv. Stat. Clim. Meteorol.

We document a protocol developed by the World Weather Attribution group. It includes choices of which events to analyse, the event definition, observational analysis, model evaluation, multi-model multi-method attribution, hazard synthesis, vulnerability and exposure analysis, and communication procedures. The protocol will be useful for future event attribution studies and as a basis for an operational attribution service.\n\nApparent ecosystem carbon turnover time: uncertainties and robust features\n\nNaixin Fan, Sujan Koirala, Markus Reichstein, Martin Thurner, Valerio Avitabile, Maurizio Santoro, Bernhard Ahrens, Ulrich Weber, and Nuno Carvalhais\n\nEarth Syst.

In this study, we provide a new, updated ensemble of diagnostic terrestrial carbon turnover times and associated uncertainties on a global scale. Despite the large variation in both magnitude and spatial patterns of Ï„, we identified robust features in the spatial patterns of Ï„ which could contribute to uncertainty reductions in future projections of the carbon cycleÃ¢Â€Â“climate feedback.\n\nRisk of crop failure due to compound dry and hot extremes estimated with nested copulas\n\nAndreia Filipa Silva Ribeiro, Ana Russo, CÃƒÂ©lia Marina Gouveia, PatrÃƒÂ­cia PÃƒÂ¡scoa, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 4815â€“4830, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4815-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4815-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the impacts of compound dry and hot extremes on crop yields, namely wheat and barley, over two regions in Spain dominated by rainfed agriculture. We provide estimates of the conditional probability of crop loss under compound dry and hot conditions, which could be an important tool for responsible authorities to mitigate the impacts magnified by the interactions between the different hazards.\n\nHYBRID MODELING: FUSION OF A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH AND A PHYSICS-BASED MODEL FOR GLOBAL HYDROLOGICAL MODELING\n\nB.

Pabon-Moreno, Talie Musavi, Mirco Migliavacca, Markus Reichstein, Christine RÃƒÂ¶mermann, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3991â€“4006, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3991-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3991-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEcosystem CO2 uptake changes in time depending on climate conditions. In this study, we analyze how different climate variables affect the timing when CO2 uptake is at a maximum (DOYGPPmax). We found that the joint effects of radiation, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most relevant controlling factors of DOYGPPmax and that if they increase, DOYGPPmax will happen earlier. These results help us to better understand how CO2 uptake could be affected by climate change.\n\nLarge-scale biospheric drought response intensifies linearly with drought duration in arid regions\n\nRenÃƒÂ© Orth, Georgia Destouni, Martin Jung, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2647â€“2656, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2647-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2647-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought duration is a key control of the large-scale biospheric drought response. Thereby, the vegetation responds linearly to drought duration at large spatial scales. The slope of the linear relationship between the vegetation drought response and drought duration is steeper in drier climates.\n\nSummarizing the state of the terrestrial biosphere in few dimensions\n\nGuido Kraemer, Gustau Camps-Valls, Markus Reichstein, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2397â€“2424, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo closely monitor the state of our planet, we require systems that can monitor the observation of many different properties at the same time. We create indicators that resemble the behavior of many different simultaneous observations. We apply the method to create indicators representing the Earth's biosphere. The indicators show a productivity gradient and a water gradient. The resulting indicators can detect a large number of changes and extremes in the Earth system.\n\nSynoptic-scale controls of fog and low-cloud variability in the Namib Desert\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Julia Fuchs, Peter Knippertz, Marco Gaetani, Julian Quinting, Sebastian Sippel, and Roland Vogt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 3415â€“3438, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are an essential but poorly understood element of Namib regional climate. Here, a satellite-based data set of FLCs in central Namib, reanalysis data, and back trajectories are used to systematically analyze conditions when FLCs occur. Synoptic-scale mechanisms are identified that influence the formation of FLCs and the onshore advection of marine boundary-layer air masses. The findings lead to a new conceptual model of mechanisms that drive FLC variability in the Namib.\n\nScaling carbon fluxes from eddy covariance sites to globe: synthesis and evaluation of the FLUXCOM approach\n\nMartin Jung, Christopher Schwalm, Mirco Migliavacca, Sophia Walther, Gustau Camps-Valls, Sujan Koirala, Peter Anthoni, Simon Besnard, Paul Bodesheim, Nuno Carvalhais, FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Chevallier, Fabian Gans, Daniel S.

We show that we can reproduce seasonal variations in carbon assimilated by plants via photosynthesis and in ecosystem net carbon balance. The ecosystemÃ¢Â€Â™s mean carbon balance and carbon flux trends require cautious interpretation. The analysis paves the way for future improvements of the data-driven assessment of carbon fluxes.\n\nEstimating causal networks in biosphereÃ¢Â€Â“atmosphere interaction with the PCMCI approach\n\nChristopher Krich, Jakob Runge, Diego G. Miralles, Mirco Migliavacca, Oscar Perez-Priego, Tarek El-Madany, Arnaud Carrara, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1033â€“1061, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1033-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1033-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCausal inference promises new insight into biosphereâ€“atmosphere interactions using time series only. To understand the behaviour of a specific method on such data, we used artificial and observation-based data. The observed structures are very interpretable and reveal certain ecosystem-specific behaviour, as only a few relevant links remain, in contrast to pure correlation techniques. Thus, causal inference allows to us gain well-constrained insights into processes and interactions.\n\nEarth system data cubes unravel global multivariate dynamics\n\nMiguel D.

However, researching a data-rich world brings novel challenges. We present the concept of Earth system data cubes to study the complex dynamics of multiple climate and ecosystem variables across space and time. Using a series of example studies, we highlight the potential of effectively considering the full multivariate nature of processes in the Earth system.\n\nTowards a global understanding of vegetationÃ¢Â€Â“climate dynamics at multiple timescales\n\nNora Linscheid, Lina M. Estupinan-Suarez, Alexander Brenning, Nuno Carvalhais, Felix Cremer, Fabian Gans, Anja Rammig, Markus Reichstein, Carlos A. Sierra, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 945â€“962, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-945-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation typically responds to variation in temperature and rainfall within days. Yet seasonal changes in meteorological conditions, as well as decadal climate variability, additionally shape the state of ecosystems. It remains unclear how vegetation responds to climate variability on these different timescales. We find that the vegetation response to climate variability depends on the timescale considered. This scale dependency should be considered for modeling landâ€“atmosphere interactions.\n\nCombining hyperspectral remote sensing and eddy covariance data streams for estimation of vegetation functional traits\n\nJavier Pacheco-Labrador, Tarek S.

This information, nowadays missing, is fundamental to improve our understanding and prediction of carbon and water cycles, and therefore to anticipate effects and responses to Climate Change. In this manuscript we propose a method to exploit the data provided by these satellites to successfully obtain this information key to face Climate Change.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Turning the challenges of partitioning ecosystem evaporation and transpiration into opportunities\n\nPaul C.

Additionally, the notion that T / ET intermittently approaches 1, which is a basis for many partitioning methods, does not hold for certain methods and ecosystems. To better constrain estimates of E and T from combined ET measurements, we propose a combination of independent measurement techniques to better constrain E and T at the ecosystem scale.\n\nA new approach for assessing climate change impacts in ecotron experiments\n\nInne Vanderkelen, Jakob Zschleischler, Lukas Gudmundsson, Klaus Keuler, Francois Rineau, Natalie Beenaerts, Jaco Vangronsveld, and Wim Thiery\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-267,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-267, 2019\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nCarbonÃ¢Â€Â“water flux coupling under progressive drought\n\nSven Boese, Martin Jung, Nuno Carvalhais, Adriaan J. Teuling, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 2557â€“2572, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2557-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2557-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines how limited water availability during droughts affects water-use efficiency. This metric describes how much carbon an ecosystem can assimilate for each unit of water lost by transpiration. We test how well different water-use efficiency models can capture the dynamics of transpiration decrease due to increased soil-water limitation. Accounting for the interacting effects of radiation and water limitation is necessary to accurately predict transpiration during these periods.\n\nN : P stoichiometry and habitat effects on Mediterranean savanna seasonal root dynamics\n\nRichard K. F. Nair, Kendalynn A. Morris, Martin Hertel, Yunpeng Luo, Gerardo Moreno, Markus Reichstein, Marion Schrumpf, and Mirco Migliavacca\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 1883â€“1901, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1883-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1883-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated how nutrient availability affects seasonal timing of root growth and death in a Spanish savanna, adapted to a long summer drought. We found that nitrogen (N) additions led to more root biomass but number of roots was higher with N and phosphorus together. These effects were strongly affected by the time of year. In autumn root growth occurred after leaf production. This has implications for how we understand biomass production and carbon uptake in these systems.\n\nHuman influence on European winter wind storms such as those of January 2018\n\nRobert Vautard, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike E. L. Otto, Pascal Yiou, Hylke de Vries, Erik van Meijgaard, Andrew Stepek, Jean-Michel Soubeyroux, Sjoukje Philip, Sarah F. Kew, Cecilia Costella, Roop Singh, and Claudia Tebaldi\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 271â€“286, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-271-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-271-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of human activities on the probability of winter wind storms like the ones that occurred in Western Europe in January 2018 is analysed using multiple model ensembles. Despite a significant probability decline in observations, we find no significant change in probabilities due to human influence on climate so far. However, such extreme events are likely to be slightly more frequent in the future. The observed decrease in storminess is likely to be due to increasing roughness.\n\nAttributing the 2017 Bangladesh floods from meteorological and hydrological perspectives\n\nSjoukje Philip, Sarah Sparrow, Sarah F.

For the large Brahmaputra basin, using precipitation alone as a proxy for flooding might not be appropriate. In this paper we explicitly test this assumption by performing an attribution of both precipitation and discharge as a flooding-related measure to climate change. We find the change in risk to be of similar order of magnitude (between 1 and 2) for both the meteorological and hydrological approach.\n\nGlobal variability of carbon use efficiency in terrestrial ecosystems\n\nXiaolu Tang, Nuno Carvalhais, Catarina Moura, Bernhard Ahrens, Sujan Koirala, Shaohui Fan, Fengying Guan, Wenjie Zhang, Sicong Gao, Vincenzo Magliulo, Pauline Buysse, Shibin Liu, Guo Chen, Wunian Yang, Zhen Yu, Jingjing Liang, Leilei Shi, Shenyan Pu, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-37,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-37, 2019\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation CUE is a key measure of carbon transfer from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass. This study modelled global CUE with published observations using random forest. CUE varied with ecosystem types and spatially decreased with latitude, challenging the previous conclusion that CUE was independent of environmental controls. Our results emphasize a better understanding of environmental controls on CUE to reduce uncertainties in prognostic land-process model simulations.\n\nThe effect of univariate bias adjustment on multivariate hazard estimates\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Erich M. Fischer, and Stefan Lange\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 31â€“43, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-31-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-31-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany climate models have biases in different variables throughout the world. Adjusting these biases is necessary for estimating climate impacts. Here we demonstrate that widely used univariate bias adjustment methods do not work well for multivariate impacts. We illustrate this problem using fire risk and heat stress as impact indicators. Using an approach that adjusts not only biases in the individual climate variables but also biases in the correlation between them can resolve these problems.\n\nContrasting biosphere responses to hydrometeorological extremes: revisiting the 2010 western Russian heatwave\n\nMilan Flach, Sebastian Sippel, Fabian Gans, Ana Bastos, Alexander Brenning, Markus Reichstein, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 6067â€“6085, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6067-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6067-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNorthern forests enhanced their productivity during and before the 2010 Russian mega heatwave. We scrutinize this issue with a novel type of multivariate extreme event detection approach. Forests compensate for 54 % of the carbon losses in agricultural ecosystems due to vulnerable conditions in spring and better water management in summer. The findings highlight the importance of forests in mitigating climate change, while not alleviating the consequences of extreme events for food security.\n\nVarying soil moistureÃ¢Â€Â“atmosphere feedbacks explain divergent temperature extremes and precipitation projections in central Europe\n\nMartha M. Vogel, Jakob Zscheischler, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 1107â€“1125, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1107-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1107-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change projections of temperature extremes are particularly uncertain in central Europe. We demonstrate that varying soil moistureâ€“atmosphere feedbacks in current climate models leads to an enhancement of model differences; thus, they can explain the large uncertainties in extreme temperature projections. Using an observation-based constraint, we show that the strong drying and large increase in temperatures exhibited by models on the hottest day in central Europe are highly unlikely.\n\nBasic and extensible post-processing of eddy covariance flux data with REddyProc\n\nThomas Wutzler, Antje Lucas-Moffat, Mirco Migliavacca, JÃƒÂ¼rgen Knauer, Kerstin Sickel, Ladislav Ã… igut, Olaf Menzer, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5015â€“5030, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5015-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5015-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNet fluxes of carbon dioxide at the ecosystem level measured by eddy covariance are a main source for understanding biosphereâ€“atmosphere interactions. However, there is a need for more usable and extensible tools for post-processing steps of the half-hourly flux data. Therefore, we developed the REddyProc package, providing data filtering, gap filling, and flux partitioning. The extensible functions are compatible with state-of-the-art tools but allow easier integration in extended analysis.\n\nUpscaled diurnal cycles of landÃ¢Â€Â“atmosphere fluxes: a new global half-hourly data product\n\nPaul Bodesheim, Martin Jung, Fabian Gans, Miguel D. Mahecha, and Markus Reichstein\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 1327â€“1365, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1327-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1327-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide continuous half-hourly carbon and energy fluxes for 2001 to 2014 at 0.5Ã‚Â° spatial resolution, which allows for analyzing diurnal cycles globally. The data set contains four fluxes: gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), latent heat (LE), and sensible heat (H). In addition, we provide a derived product that only contains monthly average diurnal cycles but which also enables us to study the important characteristics of subdaily patterns at a global scale.\n\nAsymmetric responses of primary productivity to altered precipitation simulated by ecosystem models across three long-term grassland sites\n\nDonghai Wu, Philippe Ciais, Nicolas Viovy, Alan K.

Collaboration between modelers and site investigators needs to be strengthened to improve the specific processes in ecosystem models in following studies.\n\nWater-stress-induced breakdown of carbonÃ¢Â€Â“water relations: indicators from diurnal FLUXNET patterns\n\nJacob A. Nelson, Nuno Carvalhais, Mirco Migliavacca, Markus Reichstein, and Martin Jung\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 2433â€“2447, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2433-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2433-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlants have typical daily carbon uptake and water loss cycles. However, these cycles may change under periods of duress, such as water limitation. Here we identify two types of patterns in response to water limitations: a tendency to lose more water in the morning than afternoon and a decoupling of the carbon and water cycles. The findings show differences in responses by trees and grasses and suggest that morning shifts may be more efficient at gaining carbon per unit water used.\n\nImpacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones\n\nJannis von Buttlar, Jakob Zscheischler, Anja Rammig, Sebastian Sippel, Markus Reichstein, Alexander Knohl, Martin Jung, Olaf Menzer, M.

We show that heat extremes typically increased mainly respiration whereas drought decreased both fluxes. Combined heat and drought extremes had opposing effects offsetting each other for respiration, but there were also strong reductions in GPP and hence the strongest reductions in the ecosystems carbon sink capacity.\n\nExtreme heat in India and anthropogenic climate change\n\nGeert Jan van Oldenborgh, Sjoukje Philip, Sarah Kew, Michiel van Weele, Peter Uhe, Friederike Otto, Roop Singh, Indrani Pai, Heidi Cullen, and Krishna AchutaRao\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 365â€“381, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-365-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-365-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOn 19 May 2016 a temperature of 51.0 Â°C in Phalodi (northwest India) set a new Indian record. In 2015 a very lethal heat wave had occurred in the southeast. We find that in India the trend in extreme temperatures due to greenhouse gases is largely cancelled by increasing air pollution and irrigation. The health impacts of heat waves do increase due to higher humidity and air pollution. This implies that we expect heat waves to become much hotter as soon as air pollution is brought under control.\n\nReverse engineering model structures for soil and ecosystem respiration: the potential of gene expression programming\n\nIulia Ilie, Peter Dittrich, Nuno Carvalhais, Martin Jung, Andreas Heinemeyer, Mirco Migliavacca, James I.

The increase in available data allows for new approaches in their modelling. We automatically developed models for ecosystem and soil carbon respiration using a machine learning approach. When compared with established respiration models, we found that they are better in prediction as well as offering new insights.\n\nDetecting impacts of extreme events with ecological inÃ‚ situ monitoring networks\n\nMiguel D.

A key challenge was to consistently combining observational products of terrestrial and aquatic surfaces. Our primary goal is to identify todayÃ¢Â€Â™s key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that would need to be addressed in future measurement campaigns or expansions of in situ observatories.\n\nMultivariate anomaly detection for Earth observations: a comparison of algorithms and feature extraction techniques\n\nMilan Flach, Fabian Gans, Alexander Brenning, Joachim Denzler, Markus Reichstein, Erik Rodner, Sebastian Bathiany, Paul Bodesheim, Yanira Guanche, Sebastian Sippel, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 677â€“696, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-677-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnomalies and extremes are often detected using univariate peak-over-threshold approaches in the geoscience community. The Earth system is highly multivariate. We compare eight multivariate anomaly detection algorithms and combinations of data preprocessing. We identify three anomaly detection algorithms that outperform univariate extreme event detection approaches. The workflows have the potential to reveal novelties in data. Remarks on their application to real Earth observations are provided.\n\nBivariate return periods of temperature and precipitation explain aÃ‚ large fraction of European crop yields\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Rene Orth, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3309â€“3320, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3309-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3309-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use newly established methods to compute bivariate return periods of temperature and precipitation and relate those to crop yield variability in Europe. Most often, crop yields are lower when it is hot and dry and higher when it is cold and wet. The variability in crop yields along a specific climate gradient can be captured well by return periods aligned with these gradients. This study provides new possibilities for investigating the relationship between crop yield variability and climate.\n\nThe importance of radiation for semiempirical water-use efficiency models\n\nSven Boese, Martin Jung, Nuno Carvalhais, and Markus Reichstein\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3015â€“3026, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3015-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3015-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor plants, the ratio of carbon uptake to water loss by transpiration is usually thought to depend on characteristic properties (their adaption to water scarcity) and the dryness of the atmosphere at any given moment. We show that, on the ecosystem scale, radiation has an independent effect on this ratio that had not been previously considered. When including this variable in models, predictions of transpiration improve considerably.\n\nRefining multi-model projections of temperature extremes by evaluation against landâ€“atmosphere coupling diagnostics\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Rene Orth, Markus Reichstein, Martha Vogel, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst.

Our study demonstrates that a considerable fraction of coupled climate models overemphasize warm-season moisture-limited climate regimes in midlatitude regions. This leads to biases in daily-scale temperature extremes, which are alleviated in a constrained ensemble.\n\nweather@home 2: validation of an improved globalÃ¢Â€Â“regional climate modelling system\n\nBenoit P.

This is particularly useful when investigating extreme weather events, notably for the attribution of these events to anthropogenic climate change. A new version of weather@home is presented and evaluated, which includes an improved representation of the land surface and increased horizontal resolution over Europe.\n\nA statistical framework for conditional extreme event attribution\n\nPascal Yiou, AglaÃƒÂ© JÃƒÂ©zÃƒÂ©quel, Philippe Naveau, Frederike E. L. Otto, Robert Vautard, and Mathieu Vrac\n\nAdv. Stat. Clim. Meteorol. Oceanogr., 3, 17â€“31, https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-3-17-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-3-17-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe attribution of classes of extreme events, such as heavy precipitation or heatwaves, relies on the estimate of small probabilities (with and without climate change). Such events are connected to the large-scale atmospheric circulation. This paper links such probabilities with properties of the atmospheric circulation by using a Bayesian decomposition. We test this decomposition on a case of extreme precipitation in the UK, in January 2014.\n\nRapid attribution of theÃ‚ August 2016 flood-inducing extreme precipitation in south Louisiana to climate change\n\nKarin van der Wiel, Sarah B.

Here, we analyze the climatological statistics of the precipitation event, as defined by its 3-day total over 12Ã¢Â€Â“14 August. Using observational data and high-resolution global coupled model experiments, we find for a comparable event on the central US Gulf Coast an average return period of about 30 years and the odds being increased by at least 1.4 since 1900 due to anthropogenic climate change.\n\nThe weather@home regional climate modelling project for Australia and New Zealand\n\nMitchell T.
