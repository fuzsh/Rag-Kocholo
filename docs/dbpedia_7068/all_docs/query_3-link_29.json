Fundamentals of Fastener Metallurgy and Heat Treatment, April 18 & 19, at Industrial Fasteners Institute. Learn basic concepts of fastener metallurgy and heat treating with an enhanced curriculum that will be taught over two-full days. https://ow.ly/FsCW50QHUE0 Students will gain an understanding of mechanical properties and how designers can influence or change them with thermal treatments. Common thermal treatments for fasteners, including the actual process and equipment mechanics use, will be explored. The course is heavily focused on carbon and alloy steel; however, the theory behind solution hardening and aging will also be discussed. In this new class format, additional material related to common industrial fastener strength standards, like ISO 898/1 and SAE J429, has been added as well as several practical exercises intended to reinforce and hone understanding of the material. Although this is a fundamentals course, students should have some understanding of engineering and/or metallurgy. This course is designed for engineers and technical associates. Although some areas could be explored in much greater detail, the subject matter will be best understood by individuals who have a background in engineering materials and mechanics. Pricing for this two-day course is $900 and FREE for IFI members. #fasteners #fastenertraining #fastenerschool #manufacturing\n\nRegister today!
