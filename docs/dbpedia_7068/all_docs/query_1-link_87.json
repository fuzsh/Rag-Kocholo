        "text": "Title + Summary\n\nRobert Ashley is widely considered one of the great American composers of the post-Cage generation. Ashley created radical new forms of opera, incorporating electronic music and pioneering the use of opera in television. His multimedia projects expanded upon the form in surprising, often perplexing ways. Kurt Gottschalk spoke to Ashley in 2013 for a major feature in the 13th issue of White Fungus. At the time, Ashley was working on his opera Quicksand, which he completed before his passing in March 2014. The article can now be read online.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nBruce Russell writes about the history of New Zealand DIY electronic music, which he argues sprang from a strategy of “mis-competence”. That is a deliberate misuse of instruments and audio equipment to achieve a sound beyond the machinations of the music industry. Misuse, Russell says, is the defining feature of New Zealand sound work. This article was originally commissioned in 2012 by White Fungus for the first issue of its sister publication The Subconscious Restaurant.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nRoger Boyce explores through lucid, evocative prose the photographic still lifes of New Zealand artist Fiona Pardington. Casting an eye back across the history of painting, Boyce addresses the rich pathos of Pardington’s photography and its visually arresting forms. He describes in them an audacious “through a glass darkly” veneration of things and their inviolable circumstance, an amor fati.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nYao Jui-Chung is one of Taiwan’s most prolific and esteemed contemporary artists. In 2020, White Fungus editor Ron Hanson interviewed Yao for a major profile on the occasion of the artist’s mid-career retrospective, Republic of Cynic, at C-LAB in Taipei. The feature was to be published in a new online Japanese art magazine commissioned by a Tokyo art collector. After the project was aborted due to a clash over the publication’s title, this profile sat dormant in our archives for almost four years. It has now been published for the first time.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nSydney noise musician Lucas Abela, AKA Justice Yeldham, is one of the avant-garde's most electrifying performers. Playing music by orally manipulating mic'd-up shards of glass, he employs a range of unusual vocal and rhythmic techniques. His performances can be extreme, even bloody, but are also notable for the rich diversity of sounds he achieves through this rudimentary instrument. White Fungus editor Ron Hanson spoke to Abela about his unique musical trajectory and how a pandemic-enforced break from the stage altered his approach.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nIn the wake of the Covid pandemic, bats have once again been unfairly maligned. As the go-to scapegoat of choice for many, some even called for the mammals’ eradication. In Batlove Redux, Tessa Laird, author of the book Bat, part of Reaktion’s much-loved Animal series, mounts an impassioned defense of these marvelous creatures. Laird celebrates bats, recalling art and literature inspired by the mammals, while raising the alarm over their plight amidst a warming planet. She recalls her own heartbreaking experiences volunteering to rescue flying-foxes during forest fires at Yarra Bend Park in Australia.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nIn the realms of Taiwanese noise, sound, and media art, no figure is more influential than Wang Fujui. As an artist, publisher, curator, and organizer, Wang’s contribution to establishing these fields in Taiwan has been indispensable. In 2014, Alistair Noble interviewed Wang about his artistic trajectory. The interview was first published in the 14th print issue of White Fungus but is now available here.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nDo animals create and enjoy music on a similar level to humans? Or are their magnificent displays of sound merely functional? Tobias Fischer, co-editor of the book Animal Music, lays out the arguments for and against, drawing upon a trove of research and creative works by artists and scientists alike.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nIn 1959, Wallis Islander Aloï Pilioko met Russian French artist Nicolaï Michoutouchkine in what is now Vanuatu. The encounter proved pivotal as Michoutouchkine encouraged Piliko to become an artist, and he would go on to become one of the most famous Pacific artists of his generation. The pair became inseparable and began a remarkable decades-long adventure of traveling, collecting, exhibiting, and making Oceanic art all over the world. Peter Brunt wrote about the unique artistic collaboration for White Fungus.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nIn the space of only a few years, Taipei Popcorn, the creation of New Zealander Nick van Halderen, has emerged as one of Taiwan’s most iconic drag queens. Whether performing at underground clubs, doing photo shoots for Vogue, or starring in art films, Popcorn has become an omnipresent and pivotal figure in the island’s vibrant queer culture. Yet surprisingly, prior to relocating to Taiwan, Van Halderen had never ventured into the world of drag. White Fungus editor Ron Hanson spoke with Popcorn about their unusual journey and gained a window into their personal transformation and Taiwan’s surging queer scene.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nTaiwan-based independent arts magazine White Fungus returns to print for the first time since the pandemic with the release of its 17th issue. The new issue is available for purchase now at the White Fungus online shop.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nAvant-garde jazz group The Art Ensemble of Chicago has been breaking boundaries for more than five decades. Kurt Gottschalk takes a deep dive into the group's history and its continuing evolution in the present. \"A revolutionary who’s unwilling to change won’t likely be revolutionary for long,\" Gottschalk writes. Read an extended excerpt from the author's feature which runs over 30 pages in the new 17th issue of White Fungus.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nSocial Dissonance is a handbook published by the artist, performer and theorist Mattin which contextualizes his composition \"Social Dissonance'', performed at documenta 14 in 2017. The score dispenses with conventional musical instruments and instead instructs the performer to make the audience their instrument. Music cataloger Colin Morgan reviews Social Dissonance and considers how he would catalogue Mattin's disruptive medium.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nIn this series of wide-angle polaroids, Yao Jui-Chung photographs Madou Temple's animatronic religious display and other similar depictions of hell from throughout Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nBetty Apple is a musician and performance artist based in Taipei. Apple engages in what she terms \"live art\", intensely physical performances that deconstruct tightly composed constructions of corporeal and aural space. Advancing concepts of the feminine, Apple reworks the leftover rickety architecture of Taiwan's former military state while exploring new postcolonial subjectivities in its present reality, democracy saturated in hypercapitalism. Kyra Kordoski wrote about Apple's work for White Fungus.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nWang Fujui is one of the pioneers of Taiwanese noise music and sound art. Wang emerged in the 1990s during the explosion of Taiwanese experimental music following the lifting of martial law. In 1993, he founded NOISE, Taiwan's first zine and record label dedicated to experimental music. Wang's own work ranges from ecstatic extreme noise to sublime sound and light installations. Alistair Noble wrote about Wang's unique body of work for White Fungus.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nDo animals create and enjoy music on a similar level to humans? Or are their magnificent displays of sound merely functional? Tobias Fischer, co-editor of the book Animal Music, lays out the arguments for and against, drawing upon a trove of research and creative works by artists and scientists alike.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nDavid Frazier charts the growth of inter-Asian dialogue and networks in the art world amidst the fissures of globalization and a still-dominant Western paradigm for viewing art.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nNicholas Thoburn's \"Anti-Book\" is a 'book' that interrogates the book-form. In his critique of this beloved commodity, Thoburn challenges our understanding of books as transcendent moral and aesthetic objects unsullied by commerce. Rather, he says, books are pulsing with capitalist relations. Thoburn proposes instead a \"communism of textual matter\". White Fungus editor Ron Hanson has been corresponding with Thoburn and, in the first of a series of articles based on this communication, introduces Thoburn's concept of the anti-book and its historical precedents.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nKurt Gottschalk attended a New York performance of Max Richter's SLEEP, in which audience members are invited to stay overnight at a concert, slowing down to share a collective, somatic experience of music. Gottschalk reported on the experience for White Fungus. Speaking to other composers on the topic, and revisiting historic works, he extended his inquiry to consider at length this different process of listening.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nKyra Kordoski revisits the pantheon-building art theory of Clement Greenberg and its connection to modernity through the prism of the matsutake mushroom.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nSam Wallman is an award-winning Melbourne comics artist who utilizes journalism and the expanded canvas of the web to detail the lives of his subjects while delivering a penetrating social message. Drawing on his co-pursuits as a trade unionist and political activist, Wallman explores topics ranging from the history of trade unionism, meth use among gay, bi, and queer men, to the arbitrariness of human detention. Tim Bollinger interviewed Wallman and wrote an overview of his work for White Fungus.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nNew Zealand's Pink and White Terraces were dubbed the \"8th wonder of the world.\" But in 1886, they were lost forever in a single night of violent volcanic destruction. Tim Bollinger wrote about the Terraces and their storied history for White Fungus.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nLin Chi-Wei is a key member of the pioneering generation of Taiwanese noise/sound artists that emerged in the 1990s. Lin has made landmark contributions as a writer, performer, artist, and member of Z.S.L.O (Zero Sound Liberation Organization). In Lin’s Tape Work, the artist sits in the center of the audience and unfurls a tape of ribbon or paper upon which characters are hand-printed or embroidered. Passed hand to hand through the crowd, each audience member/participant vocalizes the succession of phonetic symbols. The result is the creation of a multi-headed human tape machine. In the Taiwanese-language version of the work, Lin reactivates the “killing tone” or (Rù tone 入聲) from the medieval Chinese seven-tone system.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nKalisolaite ‘Uhila is a Tongan performance artist based in New Zealand. In his 2011 work \"Pigs in the Yard\", 'Uhila challenged western notions and treatment of the pig. In traditional Tongan culture, the pig is sacred. 'Uhila's performance afforded pigs this reverence while challenging audiences to reappraise their relationship to these sentient creatures.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nFast-advancing AI technologies are throwing our notions of authorship and creativity again into flux. In creating their seventh album, Blossoms, the electronic music duo Emptyset created a machine-learning system to interpret their back catalog and recordings of improvisations. The musicians sought to identify results beyond mimicry and which constituted unique sonic expressions in and of themselves. What emerged was a bizarre, alien logic. Tobias Fischer interviewed the duo about the process.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nNoise music in Taiwan emerged in the 1990s, a tumultuous period of social upheaval following the lifting of 38 years of martial law. In the frenzied atmosphere of street clashes and political demonstrations, artists explored previously taboo subjects and experimented with radical forms. It was in this context that Taiwan's noise movement was born. Jeph Lo witnessed the evolution and reflects on that messy but protean time. His article is accompanied by photographs of political demonstrations of the period by Leon Tsai and Tsai Ming-Te.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nSumitomo Fumihiko writes about the video works of Okinawan artist Chikako Yamashiro.

Barry Schwabsky looks back on Celan's life and work following the 100th anniversary of the poet's birth, and the 50th of his death.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nThe Brazil-based artist duo Bárbara Wagner and Benjamin de Burca produce films blurring the lines between fiction and documentary.

Marcella Faustini spoke to the artists and wrote about their work.\n\nTitle + Summary\n\nRoger Boyce interviews Pavel Pepperstein for White Fungus.
