The photograph appears to have been taken in the 1890’s with Adam likely in his teens or 20’s at the time the photograph was taken. Based on limited research I was able to gather the following information regarding Adam and his family: Adam Frederick MERKLE was b. 5 Jun 1877 in Germany and came to the USA sometime between 1884 and 1894 and was naturalized in 1899 in Oskaloosa, IA. During the 1900 census of Oskaloosa, IA Adam was boarding in the home of Fred G. & Katherin LOOS. During the 1905 census, Adam was living in Jasper, IA. Adam was a Baker and married Katherine ROSENTHAL (1870-1958) in Denver, CO on 14 May 1922. Adam’s social security records indicate that he was to parents Frederick MERKLE and Katherine BAUCHLE. Adam died in 1965 and is buried in the Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, CO. I am hoping to see the photograph returned to family and would appreciate you contacting me if you are a member of this family or know someone who might be.

MASTERS was b. 28 Oct 1851 in Ashtabula, OH and married John Roberts PENNYBECKER or PENNEBECKER or PENNYPACKER or PENNY (1839-1914).

Lottie died 16 May 1920 in Cedar Rapids, IA and is buried in the Lisbon Cemetery in Lisbon, IA. The couple adopted a daughter, Lillie ZERBE. Lottie’s obituary lists their last name as PENNY and notes that she married John on 20 Sept 1868 in Tipton, IA.

Thanks, Shelley\n\nStarted by Shelley Cardiel @\n\nEVANS Family photographs\n\nI’ve recovered two old photographs belonging to the EVANS Family. The first is a photograph of Bill EVANS which was taken at the Miller & Co. Studio in Davenport, IA sometime in the 1880’s. Bill appears to be in his 20’s at the time the photograph was taken. The second photograph is one of Stella EVANS which was taken at the E. A. Parker Studio in Kinston, NC in the 1890’s or early 1900’s. Stella appears to be in her teens or 20’s at the time and is also identified as “Woman who stayed with M. E. Q.” which I believe is a reference to a member of the QUINNERLY or QUINERLY Family. I am hoping to return the photograph to family and would appreciate you contacting me if you are a member of this family or know someone who might be.
