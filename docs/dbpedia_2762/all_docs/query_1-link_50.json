Growing up, I did not have much, but my passion for music at an early age enriched me more than any money ever could.\n\nI BEGAN WRITING MUSIC AT A VERY EARLY AGE, BANGING EVERYWHERE TO CREATE SOUNDS AND SINGING AS LOUD AS I COULD EVERY DAY.\n\nTHROUGH THIS, MY SONGWRITING EVOLVED UNTIL THE POINT WHERE I REALIZED WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN THAT I WANTED TO RELEASE MUSIC OF MY OWN. VERY QUICKLY IT HIT ME AS I BEGAN TINKERING WITH MAGIX MUSIC MAKER THAT MAYBE MUSIC PRODUCTION IS WHAT I WANT TO DO.\n\nI WAS ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH PRODUCING MUSIC FROM THERE.\n\nI kinda realized that I would NEVER EVER be able to let go of the creative control of my music. I found myself PONDERING THE THOUGHT that I would rather have someone else sing the music I write, rather than have someone produce it for me.\n\nI fell absolutely in love with creating electronic music that had an obvious country/folk/bluegrass accent on it.\n\nFAST FORWARD TO TODAY.\n\nI AM A SEMI-TOURING DJ/ARTIST AND ELECTRONIC PRODUCER AND I CANNOT BE MORE GRATEFUL THAT I GET TO DO THIS FOR A LIVING.\n\nDJ and EDM Producer Joe Hanzen had a great debut,\n\ncoming from absolutely nowhere and quickly gaining over 50.000 streams on his first song Surrender, only to shortly after release three more energy filled songs with a lot more well on the way.\n\nNow, semi-touring Joe Hanzen from Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, is hell bent on playing at every venue in the world.\n\nThe young DJ from Norrland has, so far, experienced everything from broken attendance records and energy packed dance floors to collaborating several times overseas just to get the right vocals on a track.\n\nJoe Hanzen is smashing through expectations, ready to work harder than ever before.\n\nReading crowds is his middle name, so if you get to see see him play;\n\nPut on your favourite dance shoes, you’re going to have the night of your life.\n\nCHECK OUT MY STORE\n\nNEW STUFF\n\nGOOD STUFF\n\nNEW STUFF GOOD STUFF NEW STUFF GOOD STUFF\n\nFeatured"
