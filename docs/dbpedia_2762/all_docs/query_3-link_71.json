        "text": "Research involving human subjects is an essential component of furthering the knowledge of the etiology, characteristics, and treatment of human medical conditions and disorders. The realization of research relies on the ethical concerns for, and participation of, the study subjects. Informed consent –– or an explicit waiver of the need for it from an ethical review board –– is a cornerstone for recruitment of study participants for medical research (Rothstein & Shoben, Reference Rothstein and Shoben2013). When the choice to consent is dependent on characteristics pertaining to the individual or context, the selection of participants for the study is consequently non-random, which introduces the possibility of bias in estimations of associations within the sample (Groenwold et al., Reference Groenwold, van der Graaf and van Delden2013; Hernan et al., Reference Hernan, Hernandez-Diaz and Robins2004)\n\nIt has previously been demonstrated that individuals who consent to medical research participation may be different in several ways from those who decline participation, but consistent patterns are lacking (Kho et al., Reference Kho, Duffett, Willison, Cook and Brouwers2009). For example, several studies have shown that males were more likely to consent (Damery et al., Reference Damery, Ryan, McManus, Warmington, Draper and Wilson2011; Knies et al., Reference Knies, Burton and Sala2012; Matsui et al., Reference Matsui, Kita and Ueshima2005; Schwartz et al., Reference Schwartz, Brecher, Whyte and Klein2005; Woolf et al., Reference Woolf, Rothemich, Johnson and Marsland2000), whereas others have not demonstrated any sex difference in consent rates (Al-Shahi et al., Reference Al-Shahi, Vousden and Warlow2005; Baker et al., Reference Baker, Shiels, Stevenson, Fraser and Stone2000; Beebe et al., Reference Beebe, Ziegenfuss, Jenkins, Haas and Davern2011; Buckley et al., Reference Buckley, Murphy, Byrne and Glynn2007; Huang et al., Reference Huang, Shih, Chang and Chou2007; Klassen et al., Reference Klassen, Lee, Barer and Raina2005; McKinney et al., Reference McKinney, Jones, Parslow, Davey, Darowski and Chaudhry2005) and some have seen a higher likelihood of consent among females (Dunn et al., Reference Dunn, Jordan, Lacey, Shapley and Jinks2004; Kho et al., Reference Kho, Duffett, Willison, Cook and Brouwers2009). The age of the potential study participants may play a part in the choice to consent. Previous studies have shown that relatively older individuals may be more (Beebe et al., Reference Beebe, Ziegenfuss, Jenkins, Haas and Davern2011; Damery et al., Reference Damery, Ryan, McManus, Warmington, Draper and Wilson2011; Woolf et al., Reference Woolf, Rothemich, Johnson and Marsland2000) or less (Dunn et al., Reference Dunn, Jordan, Lacey, Shapley and Jinks2004; Huang et al., Reference Huang, Shih, Chang and Chou2007; Knies et al., Reference Knies, Burton and Sala2012; Matsui et al., Reference Matsui, Kita and Ueshima2005; Schwartz et al., Reference Schwartz, Brecher, Whyte and Klein2005) likely to give consent compared to younger individuals in the same study; however, variation in the age ranges of the study populations complicates comparisons between the studies. Interestingly, an individual's health status could have an effect on consent choice. Some studies have described that being afflicted with some medical conditions or disabilities was associated with higher likelihood of consent (Buckley et al., Reference Buckley, Murphy, Byrne and Glynn2007; Dunn et al., Reference Dunn, Jordan, Lacey, Shapley and Jinks2004; Klassen et al., Reference Klassen, Lee, Barer and Raina2005; McKinney et al., Reference McKinney, Jones, Parslow, Davey, Darowski and Chaudhry2005). However, it is possible that this is to some degree specific to the conditions in question, as other studies report no association between their health outcome under study and consent (Baker et al., Reference Baker, Shiels, Stevenson, Fraser and Stone2000; Damery et al., Reference Damery, Ryan, McManus, Warmington, Draper and Wilson2011) or that those suffering from certain diseases could indeed be less likely to provide consent (Huang et al., Reference Huang, Shih, Chang and Chou2007; Jacobsen et al., Reference Jacobsen, Xia, Campion, Darby, Plevak, Seltman and Melton1999; Schwartz et al., Reference Schwartz, Brecher, Whyte and Klein2005). Due to their focused scopes, these studies do not allow for deductions regarding whether the specific disease or its severity is a more important contributor to consent choice. An additional factor of importance for consent to research participation is the educational level of the potential study subject. Most reports including such information have concluded that individuals with a higher level of education are more inclined to agree to research participation (Huang et al., Reference Huang, Shih, Chang and Chou2007; Knies et al., Reference Knies, Burton and Sala2012; Schwartz et al., Reference Schwartz, Brecher, Whyte and Klein2005).\n\nRequests for consent to extract information from an individual's medical health records do not require in-person contact with the study participant. In this sense it entails low risk and little required effort for the individual compared to that associated with intervention studies or elements of observational studies requiring active participation (Kho et al., Reference Kho, Duffett, Willison, Cook and Brouwers2009). In addition, medical health records contain more objective measures compared to self-reported data (Knies et al., Reference Knies, Burton and Sala2012). Nevertheless, individuals may have concerns regarding the purposes of such research (Hill et al., Reference Hill, Turner, Martin and Donovan2013). Very little is known about factors predicting consent to collection of medical health records from adolescents.\n\nFollowing consent to extraction of information from medical health records, the subsequent retrieval and collection of these records may pose a further challenge to the representative selection of data available for a study, adding an additional dimension of potential bias. When conducting epidemiologic research, a systematic misrepresentation of the general population within a study population may cause problems with the external validity of the study results.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the extent to which an adolescent's choice to consent to collection of their child and school medical health records is associated with sex, health status, and parental factors, in order to identify risk for potential introduction of consent bias. Additionally, we evaluated the result of the subsequent data collection in terms of potential regional differences."
