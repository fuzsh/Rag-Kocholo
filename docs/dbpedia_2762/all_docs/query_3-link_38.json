        "text": "Mrs. James Brown - (Margaret Torbin).\n\naka \"Unsinkable Molly\" Brown. She was not a Chicagoan, but her brother, Daniel Torbin of Denver was a resident of the Palmer House at the time of the tragedy. He was a familiar sight at the White Star-Dominion Line Chicago offices. His sister escaped in port side lifeboat no. 6, the first lifeboat to leave from the port side of the Titanic at 12:55 a.m.\n\n+ Howard Brown Case\n\n- Age 48, originally of Rochester, NY. Chicago friends feared that the Howard Case listed was the same man that had been employed a year before by the Sunday Evening Club to help solicit attendance at lodging and boarding houses for services at the club. He had told friends he'd be leaving Chicago for Europe, but would return in 1912. The Howard Case on board the Titanic was the manager of the Vacuum Oil Company Ltd., Caxton House, Westminster, London and had boarded at Southampton. He may have intended to make a business trip to Standard Oil Cy., Rochester, New York. Mr. Case was a well-known American resident in England. First coming to England in 1886, he returned to the United States in 1891. Eight years later, in 1899, he came back to England to take the sole charge of his company's interests in England. He resided at Coombe Grange, Ascot together with his wife and four children (two sons and two daughters).\n\nSome survivors recalled that Case helped women and children into the boats and finally stepped back to meet his fate.\n\nMr. Howard Case died in the sinking. His body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nMrs. Tyrell W. Cavendish (Julia Siegel)\n\n- of 23 Chesham Place, London, and of New York. Prominent in Chicago social circles, she left the Titanic in lifeboat no. 6, , the first to leave on the port side at 12:55 a.m., with her maid, Miss Barber. Mrs. Cavendish was the daughter of Henry Siegel, New York millionaire (formerly of Chicago) and the niece of Ferdinand Siegel, of 3642 South Michigan Ave.\n\nTyrell Cavendish, educated at Harrow, was a descendant of William Cavendish, the third Duke of Devenshire, and was a first cousin, once removed, of Charles Frederick Cavendish, the fifth Baron Waterpark. He was fifth cousin of John Edward Dean Browne, the 5th Baron Kilmaine, whose daughter, Alicia Evelyn Browne, married Edward St. John Edmonstone, younger brother of Sir Archibald Edmondstone, 6th Baronet. Sir Archibald Edmondstone's wife, Gwendolyn Mary Field, was the granddaughter of Marshall Field, founder of the famous dry-goods store.\n\n+ George Quincy Clifford\n\n- Resident of Stoughton, Massachusetts. Age 40, Boarded in Southampton. President of the Belcher Last Company\n\nIn the winter of 1912, and before his planned combined business and pleasure trip to Europe, Mr. Clifford took out $50,000.00 worth of extra life insurance on his person. As it was, prior to his departure overseas, his brother had passed away and his own wife was very ill as well. On February 20, 1912, George Q. Clifford sailed from Boston, Mass, aboard the Megantic, another White Star liner, accompanied by his two traveling companions: Walter Chamberlain Porter, President of the Samuel Porter Last Manufacturing Co, Worcester, Mass and John Edward Maguire of the Dunbar Pattern Co., Brockton, Mass.\n\nMr. Clifford learned from a telegram upon his immediate arrival in Europe, that his mother had also passed away while he was crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He was informed that her estate was being held in probate awaiting his return as a beneficiary.\n\nThe three men boarded the Titanic in Southampton as first class passengers. Mr. Clifford shared ticket no. 110465 (£52) with Mr. Porter and occupied cabin A-14. Mr. Porter occupied cabin C-110. Mr. Maguire occupied the cabin next to Mr. Porters, C-108. All three men perished in the tragedy. Mr.Porter's body was discovered after the sinking by the MacKay Bennett (#207) in a remarkably good condition. Neither Mr. Maguire's nor Mr. Cliffords bodies were ever found.\n\nAfter Mr. Cliffords tragic death and due to his prior purchase of extra insurance, the total amount of his insurance policies reached $110,000.00. In addition, his estate was valued at $150,000.00. During his lifetime, Mr. Clifford had been a member of several Boston and Brockton area clubs.\n\nMrs. Edward G.

He was a director of the Quaker Oats Company and a cousin of James H. Douglas of 4830 South Woodlawn Avenue, President of Quaker Oats. With his brother George, Douglas had founded the family starch works in his native Cedar Rapids that later became Penick & Ford. Their father, George, had started Quaker Oats. Described as a ''Captain of Industry,'' Walter Douglas had amassed a fortune of at least $4 million in various Cedar Rapids industries and branched out into the linseed oil business in Minneapolis. With his new wife, Mahala, he'd built a mansion on bluffs overlooking Lake Minnetonka. Douglas had retired on Jan. 1, 1912, and the couple took off on a three-month tour of Europe to find furnishings for their palatial retreat. According to later reports Walter Douglas, dressed in his finest, helped lower the last lifeboat of survivors off the Titanic. It was reported that he refused to leave the ship while others remained, saying it would make him 'less than a man'. His body was later recovered by the Mackay-Bennett, and identified on April 22nd. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. His wife survived.\n\nMrs. Boulton Earnshaw\n\n- Resident of Philadelphia.

They had no children.\n\nHe was a famed New York producer, managing personalities as Lily Langtry and Amelia Bingham in \"The Climbers\" and launching Robert Edeson as a star. He was the uncle of Edward W. Steele who lived at 16 East Delaware Place and was manager of the Colonial Theater at 26 W. Randolph St..\n\nHarris and his wife boarded the Titanic at Southampton, they occupied cabin C-83. Among the other First Class Passengers was his friend John D. Baumann.\n\nMr Harris died in the disaster, his body, if recovered, was never identified\n\nIda S. Hippach\n\n- Wife of Louis Hippach, the co-founder of the Tyler & Hippach Glass Company.

She had two brothers Pierrepont and Edward Swift, and a sister Frances. Their father established a law firm with Robert Todd Lincoln (son of former US President Abraham Lincoln) called Isham, Lincoln & Beale in Chicago, Illinois. She lived for a time in Chicago where she was a member of the Friday Club and the Scribbler's Club, but by 1912 she had been living abroad for nine years; most of the time in Paris with her sister Frances (Mrs Harry Shelton). Ann's brother Edward lived in New York City and it was in order to spend the summer with him that she boarded the Titanic when it stopped at Cherbourg on April 10, 1912. Titanic passenger Arthur Larned Ryerson was a partner in her father's firm and it is likely that Ann and the Rysersons knew each other. Her cabin (C-49) was next to that of Colonel Archibald Gracie, although he did not remember ever seeing her. Ann was one of four first class women who died in the disaster; her body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nWhen Ann died, in addition to her siblings, she left a cousin, Mrs H. H. Porter, Jr., of Chicago. A memorial to her was erected by her family in Vermont.\n\nAs a further note: It has been suggested that Miss Isham brought on board with her a dog (possibly a Great Dane), and some believe that it was her refusal to leave her dog that led to her death. It has been further suggested that she was the woman observed to have had her arms frozen around her dog in the water following the sinking. However, no firm evidence has been found to support the claims.\n\n+ F.R. Kenyon\n\n- Resident of Pittsburgh, age 41, born on 14 March 1871.\n\nBrother-in-law of Mrs. George P.

She also claimed for loss of personal effects and other jewelry and for legal costs, which was met only on a pro rata basis.\n\n+ Walter Chamberlain Porter\n\n- Age 46, born May 13, 1865 to Mr. & Mrs. Samuel Porter in Worcester, Mass and was a resident of there at the time of his death.

After two months in the Agean and Egypt, Ross was feeling ill, and they decided to cut their vacation short. \"We are on the last lap of doing the old lands and ready for Winnipeg and business,\" he wrote a postcard to friends in Winnipeg. Ross canceled reservations on the Mauretania, and booked Cabin A-10 on Titanic instead. When he boarded on 10 April 1912, he was so ill from dysentery he had to be carried to his cabin on a stretcher. The last person to see Ross alive was probably Major Arthur Peuchen. Peuchen made his way up the grand staircase and saw Ross still in his pajamas. When Ross was told the ship had struck an iceberg and that he should get dressed, Ross refused to believe the trouble serious. \"Is that all,?\" he told Peuchen. \"It will take more than an iceberg to get me off this ship.\" Presumably, Ross drowned in his bed.

When her mother died, in March 1912, a sister took care of her father and Hilda could finally go. She booked her passage through the White Star agent in Gothenburg (Carl Eriksson). She was initially meant to travel on the Adriatic but was transferred on account of the coal strike. She boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger and occupied Cabin 135 far aft on D-Deck with other single women. Her destination was the home of her widowed aunt Johanna Erikson, 1032 Florence Ave. Evanston Illinois.\n\nHilda had not yet got into bed when she heard the collision; she went on deck but could see no disturbance so returned to her room. When she was back in her cabin she felt uneasy and decided to go back up on deck. Someone there grabbed her and guided her to a lifeboat. She was able to get into one of the last boats (probably) collapsible C with fellow Swede Velin Öhman. Hilda recalled that Velin produced a bottle of brandy and the two women shared it to calm their shattered nerves.\n\nIn a letter home she wrote about the arrival to New York on the Carpathia that she was \"broke, pale and skinny, we were stowed in like pigs on Carpathia.\" In New York she was brought to the Lutheran Emigrant Home. The Womens Relief Committee in New York gave her $25. After surviving the sinking she had such a terror of water that she never again traveled to Sweden or saw her Swedish relatives.

They had been released from the hospital wearing their nightgowns, old shoes someone had given them, and coats. They were met in Chicago by Dr. Mary O'Brien Porter of the Catholic Woman's league protectorate. Dr. O'Brien Porter appealed to the Mayor of Chicago to give some of the funds raised in the city to the two young women.\n\nAfter the disaster Anna became a nun, and upon ordination assumed the name of Sister Patrick Joseph Kelly. She did return to Ireland to visit her sister, Mrs Agnes Kelly Flanagan of Gortnaden, Crossmolina, Co Mayo. Anna resided in Adrian, Michigan until her death in December 1969. Read her story\n\nMr. Nikola Lulic\n\n- Going to Chicago. Boarded Vessel at Southampton\n\nMr Nikola Lulic was born on 24 February 1883 in the small village Konjsko Brdo, situated in the region of Croatia called Lika. While serving in the Austrian Army, in 1902, he decided to desert and leave for America. He went to Chisholm, Minnesota and worked as a miner in the \"Alpena Mine\". In autumn 1911 he came back to Croatia for half a year to visit his family. At this time he already was married for the second time (he had been married to his first wife Manda for 7 years). His second wife Marta and his two children lived in Croatia. When it was time to go back to America he served as unofficial companion to other emigrants who paid his ticket. He helped them with translation and advised them what to expect during the voyage and after arriving in America.\n\nLulic boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger. Mr Lulic survived the sinking and was rescued by the Carpathia in lifeboat 15. In New York his companion, Jan Jalsevac, gave the circumstances of his rescue:\n\n\"as to my friend Nikola Lulic, I have to say, that he was rescued by fetching the cap of a sailor, which he put on his head. So he could make his way to a boat.\"\n\nAfter arriving in New York, Lulic went to his uncle Ross Rosinic at 118 Torrence Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. His Americanized name was \"Nicola Lulich\". After the first world war Lulic returned to Croatia forever. He earned his living as a farmer, but worked many times in France as a seasonal worker between the wars. He was accompanied by his two sons. Long before his own death, his wife Marta died, so he had to look after the many children of his two marriages alone. In his older days he secluded himself more and more from his fellow inhabitants of Konjsko Brdo. Nikola Lulic died in 1962 in Perusic, Croatia, aged 79, in the house of his youngest daughter Mara. His grave is also in Perusic.\n\n+ Mary Mangan\n\n- aged 32, from Carrowskehine, Co Mayo, Ireland born in September 1879, the daughter of John Mangan and Bridget Bourke. Mary had been living in America with her sister Ellen for some years, and Mary was engaged to a Pat Walsh. In 1912 they had returned to Carrowskehine to visit relatives. She was returning to Chicago with 13 others who she knew from her area in Co Mayo.\n\nShe boarded the Titanic at Queenstown as a third class passenger. Mary had lived in America with her sister Ellen for several years, but returned to visit her home.

She boarded the Titanic at Queenstown as a third class passenger .\n\nAfter the Titanic collided with an iceberg, Margaret and Ellen Mockler were assisted to the Boat Deck by Martin Gallagher and Tom Kilgannon and were placed in Lifeboat 16. Upon arrival in New York City where her sister Mary was already living, Margaret became a domestic and lived there for seven years.\n\nIn 1919 she returned to her home in Ireland for a visit and married Martin Hopkins there. She lived in the village of Ahascragh where she raised her family, and spent the last eleven years of her life in the town of Clontuskert. She died in Clontuskert, Ireland on 15 May 1970.\n\nCatherine McCarthy\n\n- As with Mary Manion, there may be some confusion here. Chicago papers listed a Catherine McCarthy, survived, a sister of John McCarthy of 4431 South Wallace Avenue, Chicago.\n\nFrom the Encyclopedia-titanica.org website:\n\nMiss Catherine \"Katie\" McCarthy, 24, of Cahir, Co Tipperary, Ireland boarded the Titanic at Queenstown as a third class passenger . Her destination was Guttenburg, New Jersey. Miss McCarthy was rescued, possibly in lifeboat 15 or 16.

All perished.\n\nCatherine McCarthy died Friday 12th November 1948 and is buried in St. Michaels Cemetery in Ballintemple, Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nHer obituary on Saturday 20 November 1948 from the Tipperary Star:\n\nMrs. Catherine Croke, Ballintemple, Dundrum, whose death has occurred is believed to have been the last survivor in Ireland of the ill-fated Titanic. She was aged 21 at the time of the disaster and it was her first experience of being aboard a ship. When the tragedy occurred Mrs. Croke had a narrow escape from death, for at the last moment acting on instinct, she left a crowded boat and returned to the sinking ship. A few minutes later the boat capsized. She found refuge in the last boat to be launched and was the last but one to board it. The following morning a ship picked up the survivors. Mrs. Croke was a descendant of the McCarthys of Springhouse, an old Tipperary family. She is survived by her husband Mr. Jon Croke, farmer and merchant.\n\n+ John Meehan (aka Meehon, Mechan)\n\n- The U.S. Report lists him as having been lost; he was going to his sister, Nora Meehan of 4745 South Indiana Ave., Chicago. News accounts however reported that a John Meehan, brother of Mary Meehan, a domestic employed by M.W. Goodrich of 4458 South Drexel Blvd, was on the Titanic. A Mrs. John Worthington, of that address, reported as his sister, denied he was on the ship. Later, it was reported that Mary Meehan had received a cablegram from her mother in Ireland informing her that John had never left.\n\nFrom the Encyclopedia-titanica.org website:\n\n\"Mr John Mahon, 22, of Currowhunane, Curry, Co Sligo boarded the Titanic at Queenstown as a third class passenger. John Mahon's body, if recovered, has never been identified.\"\n\nHis destination is listed on this site as both Patterson, New Jersey AND Chicago.\n\nCarl Midtsjo\n\n- born 4 August 1890, the son of Johan Hansen and Marie Midtsjø in Krøkstad, Ski, near Christiania (Oslo), Norway\n\nHe was one of the few third class males to survive the Titanic, embarking at Southampton and was a nephew of Mr. Anton Lund, 3263 West Fullerton Avenue, Chicago.\n\nLike most single third class male passengers traveling alone he was quartered toward the bow possibly sharing with Johan Nysveen.\n\nWhen the accident occurred Karl Albert and Johan Nysveen went up to the deck, Johan who was 61 years of age, realized that he probably couldn't be saved so he gave his coat and watch to Karl Albert. Karl Albert was given permission by First Officer Murdoch to climb down the tackle and into lifeboat 15. When he arrived in New York Karl Albert was sent to St. Vincent's Hospital from where he wrote to his brother on 19 April. Karl's claim in that letter that passengers had been shot attempting to enter the boats was used by some to justify the controversial portrayal of Officer Murdoch on the film Titanic.\n\nAfter some days at the hospital Karl Albert traveled by train to Chicago. On the 26th of April 1912 he arrived in Chicago where he was immediately interviewed by the city largest Norwegian - American newspaper \"Skandinavian\".\n\nShortly after this, Karl Albert traveled to Cummings, North Dakota to give back to the relatives of Johan Nysveen his coat and watch. He stayed with them for some weeks, and told them about Johan Nysveen's last days on the Titanic.\n\nOn 15 September 1913 Karl was married to 25 year old Anna Christine Paulson from Wittenberg, Wisconsin. On January 5, 1915 their son Marvin Gilbert Midtsjø was born, and in 1917 they moved to Evanston, Illinois. Karl Albert got a job as a caretaker. In 1921 they moved back to Norway, but after a year they returned to the USA. They moved to Maywood, Illinois where Karl continued work as a caretaker, but around 1930 he started to work as a landscape gardener which he did for seven years until ill health forced him to stop. Karl Albert, even as a young man, suffered from hereditary heart disease and died 25 January 1939 in Maywood, Illinois at the age of 48. His wife and son then went to Wausau, Wisconsin where Mrs Midtsjø died in 1959. They both were buried in Chicago.\n\nTheir son changed his name to Marvin Midland (anglicized from the Norwegian) and lived in Denver, Colorado where he died on April 26, 1997.\n\nIn 1997 when the movie \"Titanic\" was presented in Norway. The county of Ski invited the relatives of Karl Albert Midtsjø for the premiere. Between them were three of his nephews and nieces who still remembered their uncle Karl Albert in the USA.\n\nHe is buried in Mt. Olive Cemetery in Chicago.\n\n+ Pehr Fabian Oliver Malkolm Myhrman\n\nBorn 10 October 1893, at age 18, he was coming here from Sweden to live with his uncle John Nelson, at 6726 North Laflin St., Chicago. His body was never recovered.\n\nHelmina Josefina Nilsson\n\n- Boarded at Southampton. Final destination was Joliet, IL, care of Edward Sander.\n\nAged 26, she was born 19 February 1886, to farmer Johan Peter Nilsson and Anna Kristina Magnusdotter Åkerslund, of Ramkvilla, Småland, Sweden. She had four younger brothers Albin, Emil, Frans & Edvin, a younger sister Ida and two elder sisters Alfrida & Hanna.\n\nAlbin, Emil & Edvin had previously emigrated, changed their name to Lander and were working in the Chicago era. Helmina traveled together with Elin Braf, also from Ramkvilla. When the accident occurred, the girls dressed themselves and Helmina rushed away in advance while Elin was left behind to pick together a few things. Helmina reached (probably) lifeboat 13 and was saved. Elin was lost.\n\nIn New York she was given an unknown sum of cash and a ticket to Joliet.\n\nIn 1918 she married Albin Linder and they had two sons. After some years they returned to Sweden and lived at Hillefällan, Rörvik where they had a daughter. Helmina died in spring 1971.\n\n+ Nils Martin Ödahl\n\n- Aged 23, he was born 22 October 1888 to Ola Öhdal and Hanna Nilsson. He embarked at Southampton and was going to live with his uncle Mr. N.O. Nelson of 725 Warner Ave, Peoria, IL. Nils Martin Ödahl had gone to agricultural schools at Sweden and Denmark. He worked as an agricultural inspector in Rydsgård, Örsjö, Skåne, Sweden. He was traveling to the USA to study further before returning to work in Sweden.\n\nÖdahl boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a third class passenger, he died in the sinking and his body was never found.\n\nVelin Orman\n\nBoarding at Southampton, Chicago was her destination to the home of her \"uncle\", Henry Forsander, who was actually her fiancee.\n\n14 March 1890 (or 1892), she was from Eks parish, Mariestad, Västergötland, Sweden. She was rescued in Collapsible C with fellow Swede Hilda Maria Hellström.\n\nShe died in Chicago, Illinois on 19 November 1966 and is buried in Chapel Hill Gardens West Elmhurst.\n\nPaulsson Family\n\nMrs. Alma Paulsson (aka Alma Cornelia Pålsson) and children Gusta, Paul, Stina and Torborg\n\nFive of the most tragic victims of the Titanic disaster must be the Paulsson Family, in which the mother and four children all perished. Mrs. Paulsson's husband, Nels Paulsson resided at 940 (or 938?) W. Townsend (or Thomas?) Street, who had come to Chicago two years before. Mrs. Paulsson, age 29, was the sister of Olaf Bergland, 2304 N. Springfield Ave. and Axel Bergland, 1725 N. Kimball Avenue.\n\nOn board the Titanic, Alma got to know August Wennerström. When the ship was sinking it took a long time to prepare the four children and Alma came too late for the lifeboats. She met Wennerström on the Boat Deck near collapsible A. Wennerström tried to hold on to two of the children as she had asked him to, but when water came up, Wennerström lost his grip and both disappeared.\n\nMrs Pålsson and the children boarded the Titanic at Southampton. They all perished in the sinking. Nils clung to the hope that stories about a rescued boy might refer to one of his children. He spent much money and time looking in vain for the boy, but eventually Mr Pålsson was informed at the Chicago offices of the White Star line that his family was among the missing.\n\nAlma's body was recovered by the Mackay-Bennett:\n\nNO. 206 - FEMALE - ESTIMATED AGE, 30 - FAIR HAIR\n\nCLOTHING - Brown Coat; green cardigan; dark shirt; brown skirt under; boots; no stockings.\n\nEFFECTS - Wedding ring; brass keeper; mouth organ; purse and two coins; a letter; 65 kroner; had four children with her; letter from husband, Neil Paulsson, 94 Townsend St, Chicago.\n\nTHIRD CLASS TICKET No. 349909 (5 TICKETS) - NAME - ALMA PAULSON\n\nShe was buried in Fairview cemetary in Halifax on 8 May 1912.\n\nNils remained in the USA, dying in 1962.\n\nErnst Ulrik Persson (aka Ernest Person)\n\n- Boarding in Southampton, his destination was 3546 LaSalle Street, Chicago (or Indiana Harbor, IN)\n\nBorn in Sweden on July 29, 1886, he was immigrating to America, together with his sister Elna Ström and niece Telma Matilda Ström it is believed that they occupied cabins on G deck (possibly room 6 or 7). They were traveling to Indiana Harbor, IN where Elna Strom had been settled for some time.\n\nErnst described the terrible experience of the sinking in a letter to his wife.\n\nWhen Elna and I came up all lifeboats were crowded at that time no rescue was found. We stood together all the time, so we agreed to accompany each other into the deep. But as the boat sunk and the water started pouring over the deck there was a terrible sight and scuffle and that separated us. Then I heard Elna saying \"Tell Wilhelm and my parents and sisters if you get rescued.\" Then I didn't see her any longer because then we were all washed overboard. When I came into the water I sunk several meters below the surface so as I came up again, I had a roof of wreckage over my head. I managed to come up in it and got hanging for a good while, but when the last part of the boat started to sink, so I had to leave the wreckage and try to swim away, otherwise I once again would have been dragged down into the deep. As I swam, I saw how people in the water tried to rescue themselves in an overloaded boat but as they hanged on the gunwale and all drowned and the boat turned the keel upwards, then I saw how some people climbed up on it, then I swam away towards it and was taken up. On this boat was only Italians and it was crowded, that it floated nearly one meter below the water. There I had to lie for six hours with the water up to my shoulders. Then we were taken up in a lifeboat that rowed us to the big boat that had come to rescue us.\n\nElna and Telma Ström were lost in the sinking, Persson's account suggests that he was rescued on one of the collapsible boats that were floated off the ship, probably collapsible B.\n\nErnst's wife Anna and sons Ernst Folke and Ernst Tage came to join him in America in October of 1912, two more children were born later. By 1914 Ernst had changed his name to Ernest Pearson, worked as a bricklayer at the Standard Forgings company (the same company as Wilhelm Strom) and lived with his family at 3725 A Carey Street, Indiana Harbor, Indiana. The family later moved to Hammond, Indiana. Ernst's wife appears to have predeceased him. Ernst himself died on 17 October 1951, aged 65. He was buried in Elmwood cemetery, Hammond, Indiana.\n\n+ Abraham W. Weller (aka Aaron Willer/Weller)\n\nOriginally from Russia, aged 37, a tailor, he had lived in America for several years but returned to London after the failure of his business. He was returning to America to start a new business. Married with five children, he embarked at Cherbourg, returning to his family at 1330 South Halsted St., Chicago. He perished in the sinking and his body was never recovered. In May, 1912, it was reported that his family intended to file suit seeking damages of $10,000. It was considered the first \"Titanic suit\" to be filed in Cook County.\n\nMr August Wennerström (August Edvard Andersson)\n\n- Age 27, was born 24 April 1884 to Knut Andersson and Elna Månsdotter. He was a journalist, typographer and socialist activist living in Malmö, Sweden. His socialist activities included the publication, in 1905, of \"Gula Faran\" (the yellow danger) and thereafter he was known under that nickname. The paper, which described the King Oscar II as \"King of thieves\" was not appreciated by the authorities. Confiscation and charges followed. Wennerström himself was acquitted but he decided to emigrate in 1912. He bought himself a ticket in Copenhagen, to conceal his identity he took the name of his friend, later Minister of defense, Ivar Vennerström's name but spelt with a W, boarding the Titanic at Southampton.\n\nOn board the Titanic he got in company with other Swedes traveling via Esbjerg, among them Carl Olof Jansson and Gunnar Isidor Tenglin with whom he shared a cabin. After the collision Wennerström took some Swedish girls to the boats, he then returned to steerage.\n\nAs the Titanic went down he met Alma Pålsson and her children. He tried to hold on to two of the children, but lost them when they came into the water. He and Tenglin also found Edvard and Elin Lindell of Helsingborg, Sweden, who were part of the surge of steerage passengers who appeared on the Boat Deck in the ship's final moments. As the ship sank the group struggled up the sloping deck until it was too steep and, clasping hands, they slid back down close to collapsible A.\n\nWennerström recounted that even though he was quite close to the ship, he detected no suction as it descended. Once the ship went under Wennerström and Lindell climbed into the boat. Wennerström saw Mrs Lindell in the water and grabbed her hand. Weakened by the cold he was unable to assist her further and after a while she drifted away. Fearfully, the young man glanced over at the woman's husband but he was already dead.\n\n\"All the feeling had left us. If we wanted to know if we still had legs (or any other part) left, we had to feel down in the water with our hand. The only exercise we got was when someone gave up hope and died, whom we immediately threw overboard to give the live ones a little more space and at the same time lighten the weight of the boat.\"\n\nIn New York he was quartered at Salvation Army's cadet school and he created a minor scandal when he accused the Lutheran immigrant home of embezzlement. He received $25 and a train ticket from the Salvation Army committee and $100 from the Red Cross. At the Salvation Army in Chicago he met Namoi Johnson of Swedish origin and they moved to Culver, Indiana where he became a gardener. They had seven children.\n\nAugust Wennerström died 22 November 1950 and is buried in Culver, Indiana.\n\nCREW\n\nMr. Charles John Joughim\n\n- The Titanic's chief baker, he was born in Birkenhead, Liverpool on 3 August 1878. A native of Southampton, he gave his address as Elmhurst Leighton Rd. He was on board the Titanic for her delivery trip from Belfast to Southampton after transferring from the Olympic. As Chief Baker he received monthly wages of £12.\n\nHe was the brother-in-law of G. Woodward, 2520 W. Washington Blvd, Chicago. He died 9th December 1956, and is buried in Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson, New Jersey.\n\n+ Harry John Stroud\n\n- Born 11 Sept 1876 to John Stroud (ship steward) and Amelia Matilda Morey, the family lived on Anderson Road, Southampton, Hampshire. When he signed on to the Titanic, on 4 April 1912, he gave his address as 167 Shirley Road, (Shirley, Southampton). His last ship had been the Danube. As a saloon steward he received monthly wages of £3 15s.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was age 38 and employed on the Titanic as a saloon steward.\n\nHis brother, William J. Stroud, resided at 217 E. 31st St, Chicago.\n\nTed Stroud, possibly a relative of Harry's, was a second class steward on the Titanic.\n\nBoth men died in the sinking. Their bodies, if recovered, were never identified.\n\nOn the 28 April 1912 Harry's father led mourners at a memorial service for victims of the sinking"
