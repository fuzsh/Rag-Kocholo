        "text": "Born Anna Märtha Vilhelmina von Oelrich, she became Märtha Adlerstråhle after her marriage in December 1889 to Adolf Ejnar Teodor Adlerstråhle. Her only notable international result was her bronze medal in the 1908 Olympic singles. She was a seven-time Swedish International Champion, winning in 1899 and 1901-06, and was Scandinavian Champion in 1906. Adlerstråhle pioneered women’s ice hockey and bandy in Sweden, and was a goaltender for the Crown Princess Hockey Club. She was the treasurer of the Swedish Lawntennisförbundet from 1907-18 and director of the Kungliga Lawn Tennis Klubben (KLTK) from 1899-1950."
