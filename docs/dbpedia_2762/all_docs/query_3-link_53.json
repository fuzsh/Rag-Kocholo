        "text": "At one with nature, the SÃ¡mi people inhabit parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia â a borderless region known as SÃ¡pmi, the land of the SÃ¡mi. Although many in the Swedish SÃ¡mi community live in Swedish Lapland â a vast area stretching from Sorsele and SkellefteÃ¥ in the northern province of VÃ¤sterbotten, right to the countryâs northernmost tip â SÃ¡mi enclaves are also found in the county of Dalarna in central Sweden. The stunning and seemingly untouched nature in all these parts of Sweden has been respectfully cared for by the country's indigenous SÃ¡mi people for thousands of years. So attuned are they to nature that they've divided the year into eight seasons, naming every mountain, stream and valley in their midst.\n\nToday, many SÃ¡mi people lead \"modern\" lives but remain true to their SÃ¡mi heritage, traditions and culture. Reindeer herding is both a way of life and a key source of income for many SÃ¡mi, with some 5,000 reindeer owners, counting even those owning a single animal. SÃ¡mis can lay claim to one of the oldest folk music forms in Europe â the âJoikâ. These unique songs typically tribute or \"call\" a mountain, a wild animal or person. It's also used to express emotion, be it sadness or joy.\n\nSami handicrafts â called âDuodjiâ in SÃ¡mi â are practised by many in the community, using natural and surplus materials, such as wood and bark, and every part of the reindeer, including the hide, antlers and even bone. Nothing goes to waste here; the Sami people were leading eco-friendly lives long before sustainability became the buzzword it is today.\n\nIn Swedish SÃ¡pmi, you'll be able to experience SÃ¡mi culture in an authentic, educational way courtesy of some 40 small-scale companies, with many run by entrepreneurial women. Many combine guest activities with reindeer herding, giving you the chance to discover this unique lifestyle across culture, food and outdoor activities, often with friendly reindeer taking an active part.\n\nSweden-wide SÃ¡mi experiences â from reindeer feeding to guided hikes\n\nThe variety of adventures you're able to embark on are as wide-ranging as the destinations themselves. Look for the âSÃ¡pmi Experienceâ seal of quality to ensure sustainable and responsible travel. JukkasjÃ¤rvi, Kiruna â home to Swedenâs famous Icehotel â is a SÃ¡mi experience hotspot. Within walking distance of the hotel, you'll find Nutti SÃ¡mi Siida, a key SÃ¡mi experience organiser for every season â in spring, you'll be given the unique chance to accompany a reindeer herder to see new-born calves taking their first steps. Educational in style, your guide will share knowledge about traditional reindeer husbandry, and to refuel, you'll tuck into a traditional SÃ¡mi meal in a âlÃ¡vvuâ tent (much like a tepee). Wintertime, you're invited to experience the magical Northern Lights and can also look forward to the SÃ¡mi guide's atmospheric folktales â storytelling is part of the heritage. Accommodation is available at Reindeer Lodge, right next to some of Nutti SÃ¡mi Siida's herd, who you might even participate in feeding in the morning.\n\nAlso consider Geunja Sami Eco Lodge, idyllically tucked away in Swedish Lapland's AmmarnÃ¤s. Run by the Vinka family, you'll get to participate in the traditional SÃ¡mi lifestyle and culture â off-grid style â via boat trips, fishing excursions, bird watching and invigorating hikes in the nearby mountains and forests, inhabited by wildlife such as wolverine and lynx. Food-wise, expect freshly caught fish and traditional fare such as reindeer stew cooked over an open fire. The accommodation is equally authentic â you'll be staying in goahti huts (traditional wooden SÃ¡mi huts) or grass-roofed log cabins.\n\nHiking through Laponia in Swedish Lapland â one of the world's few UNESCO Heritage Sites inhabited by indigenous people â is a trekker's dream. The area is home to seven SÃ¡mi villages active in the field of reindeer herding, each surrounded by stunning arctic nature. Take it all in as part of a hike through the numerous national parks and nature reserves found here, including Sarek, Padjelanta, Stora SjÃ¶fallet and Muddus.\n\nSeveral marked hiking trails snake through the enchanted, old forests of Muddus, while more experienced hikers will get a thrill trekking among Sarek's dramatic glaciers and 2,000 metre high peaks. The Padjelanta trail is a much-loved route, and the major Swedish trail Kungsleden runs along the eastern part of this national park, all the way to the Kebnekaise range. Places to stay in Laponia include Sapmi Nature Camp where you can glamp in a traditional âlavvuâ tent, meet a local reindeer family and enjoy winter wonderland trails on traditional wooden skis or snowshoes.\n\nSwedish museums with notable SÃ¡mi collections\n\nThe SÃ¡mi heritage of Sweden can also be lapped up at museums spread across the country. Ãjtte Mountain and Museum in Jokkmokk is a definite draw, and as the main museum and archive for the SÃ¡mi culture of Sweden, it has a lot to offer beyond its focal areas â the culture and nature of the mountainous area of northern Sweden.\n\nSilvermuseet i Arjeplog (The Silver Museum) is of equal calibre, charting the history and cultural significance of SÃ¡mi silversmithing via a wondrous collection dating as far back as the Middle Ages.\n\nThe city of Ãstersund, JÃ¤mtland, forms part of the south SÃ¡mi region and its resident museum, Jamtli, offers both interactive SÃ¡mi exhibits and other events. Stockholm's Nordiska Museet (The Nordic Museum) is another must-visit â it boasts the world's largest SÃ¡mi collection, regularly holding exhibitions featuring SÃ¡mi culture. Check the museum's website for current exhibitions before you go, as the SÃ¡mi collection isn't always on display.\n\nSupport local craft by taking home a SÃ¡mi handicraft souvenir\n\nTraditional âDuodjiâ handicraft is tightly woven into the SÃ¡mi heritage. The techniques behind these lovingly handmade items Â­have been passed on from generation to generation. Objects range broadly in shape and texture, and while many have practical uses, such as beautifully hand-carved birchwood bowls and ladles, there's also a wide range of jewellery and accessories to consider. Reindeer leather bracelets and bags are intricately embroidered with pewter thread, featuring buttons crafted from reindeer antlers. As always, making use of surplus material is second nature to the SÃ¡mi people.\n\nSo where might one find a good selection of SÃ¡mi handicrafts? Sami Duodji in Jokkmokk is a good bet as it's run by the SÃ¡mi craft association, SameslÃ¶jdstiftelsen. Risfjells SameslÃ¶jd, based in Vilhelmina and selling its wares online, is equally well stocked, offering everything from wool blankets to reindeer bone letter openers â most of which are made on the premises by Doris and Sven-Ãke Risfjell. Risfjells SameslÃ¶jd was named handicraft store of the year at Corporate Livewire Scandinavia Prestige Awards 2021/22.\n\nJokkmokk is where youâll also find StoorstÃ¥lka, a treasure trove of authentic SÃ¡mi handicraft, home goods and clothing, both traditional designs and modern interpretations of true SÃ¡mi style.\n\nIn Ãstersund, you'll find the SÃ¡mi Information Centre and Gaaltije â a shop selling a well curated edit of SÃ¡mi handicrafts, books and items for the home. In the same city, the resident shop of Jamtli Museum also offers a selection, including jewellery and books. Also consider Ãre HemslÃ¶jd, a craft-based shop located in the popular ski resort. Over in Stockholm, Svensk HemslÃ¶jd and the shop at Skansen both offer a selection.\n\nLast but not least, the iconic Jokkmokk Market, held at the beginning of February each year, is a goldmine for anyone keen to discover not only SÃ¡mi handicrafts, but also culture and food. In addition to the many quality Duodji and food stalls, there's ample opportunity to join a lecture or sit down for a Joik concert.\n\nThe SÃ¡mi food culture and its sustainable main ingredients\n\nThe SÃ¡mi culinary heritage is rooted in sustainability and tradition. Local produce is key and many ingredients are foraged in nature â think herbs, roots, lingonberries and the rarer cloudberry â an amber, nutrition-packed delicacy.\n\nReindeer meat is a staple enjoyed in smoked form â called âsuovasâ â but also as part of stews and sausages. In 2003 âSuovasâ became Swedenâs first Slow Food Presidia product â a culinary preservation listing issued by the international Slow Food movement to local, culturally important food products.\n\nElk also features on the menu and as for fish, Arctic char and whitefish are caught fresh in local waters â fishing and hunting for game are part of the SÃ¡mi lifestyle.\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to sample Kalix Caviar â a product of Swedish Lapland and the first Swedish food offering to have been given Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the EU, joining the ranks of Champagne and Parma ham. Cheese lovers will have plenty of choice courtesy of the small-scale dairy farms found in SÃ¡pmi country â Svedjan Ost in the county of VÃ¤sterbotten being but one example. You must try 'kokkaffe' â coffee made over an open fire, together with some dried, smoked reindeer meat and a spectacular view of the Swedish highlands. Just like the Sami people do when taking a break and keeping track of their reindeer herd.\n\nIf you're tempted to try a wide range delicacies, opt for the tasting menu offered at the Icehotel's fine dining restaurant The Veranda. Also consider Huuva Hideaway, a retreat located in the small village of LiehittÃ¤jÃ¤, and discover educational dining experiences in keeping with true SÃ¡mi tradition.\n\nEverywhere you go in Swedish SÃ¡pmi, youâll discover the carefully maintained origins of the sustainable ideals ingrained into Swedish culture. Please remember to respect the SÃ¡mi culture and customs and that you are a visitor to SÃ¡pmi, the traditional land of the indigenous SÃ¡mi people."
