Birgit worked as a dental assistant and later worked for Snohomish County. She is preceded in death by her parents Ruth and Viktor Viberg, and her brothers Gunnar, Ola, and Goran. Birgit is survived by her husband Bill Kick, her children Angela Black (Robby) and Eric Kick (Debbie), and her brother Sven Erik Viberg. Birgit had two children, seven grandchildren, ten great-grand children and fourteen nieces and nephews. She had a fiery spirit that lives on in the hearts of her loved ones and will be greatly missed. Memorial service to be held at a later date."
