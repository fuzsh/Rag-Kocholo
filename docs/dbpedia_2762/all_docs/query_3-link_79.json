        "text": "Vilhelminaborn photographer Bea Holmberg is one of the latest creators to step into the incubator. After filling her portfolio to the brim with stunning images from different parts of the world, the tent pegs have been pitched into Umeå's creative muck. The focus right now is to dig deeper and find an even greater security in entrepreneurship. Then the world lies at her feet.\n\nFor as long as Bea can remember, she has captured moments. Initially it was with disposable cameras, then full-frame cameras and more recently with drones. In various forms, photography has always been there.\n\nAs a child, she remembers her father showing her developed photos from his travels and how she was fascinated by her grandmother's many incredible photo albums from her youth. But it wasn't until Bea was submerged in Florida that she discovered how important the camera was to her. A new world opened up.\n\nIt was an incredible experience. A completely unexplored part that I had never encountered before. While I was diving, there were two documentary filmmakers from National Geographic following two young freedivers. I thought: can you work like that? What knowledge do I need to become an underwater photographer?\n\nThere and then, a desire to learn more was born. Bea went home to Gothenburg and immediately applied for a professional photography course. She was determined to learn more about the industry and explore her own photography.\n\nAfter her studies, her backpack was loaded with new knowledge and insights. The step to start my own business came quite naturally.\n\nI wanted to have more influence over my life and thus shape my own everyday life. It was easy to start up the company but not so easy to find work. In the beginning, I had other jobs on the side to make ends meet financially, but also to be able to do the traveling I wanted to do. Not knowing if the money would come in for the month was a worry for me, but plan B was to live in tents for a while. At the same time, it's a bit exciting not knowing what's coming next.\n\nAs a professional photographer, there has been a lot of travel. Bea has had the opportunity to hook up with industry colleagues and friends on assignments around the world, building up a solid portfolio and developing her expression.\n\nI have been able to travel to places I never thought I would see. It has been incredibly educational and inspiring. I've also had the privilege of working with photographers and filmmakers who share similar visions and values. This has often made the job not feel like work. We just did what we wanted to do.\n\nFor creators and entrepreneurs in the cultural and creative industries, collaboration is often the way forward. They grow in breadth rather than height - which means that new solutions emerge through the cross-fertilisation of experience, networks and skills. For Bea, this is a natural thing that she would like to see more of.\n\nI prefer to work with other creative people. I always believe in collaboration. Achieving a vision together only makes it stronger. Alone is not always the strongest, it's so easy to get stuck. Being able to bounce ideas off each other and have different areas of expertise is gold.\n\nBea is currently working with Granö Beckasin and has just started a craft study circle with some friends. The current focus is to explore more collaborations.\n\nBea is clear that Umeå is the base for the moment and although a lot is about building where she stands, there are plans to scale up the business in the long term.\n\nIn a few years, I hope to go on slow missions around the world focusing on nature and the outdoors. I may have an assistant and friend with me to do the work better, and work with several repeat clients. I'm also hoping to do more motion graphics. There's a lot of exciting stuff for me to explore there.\n\nAt eXpression Umeå, we wouldn't be the least bit shocked if it's Bea filming and photographing underwater for National Geographic in the future. Or judge for yourself, aren't they great pictures?\n\nFact box\n\nName: Amy Sara Beatrice Holmberg but called Bea\n\nAge: 28-year-old December child\n\nComing from: Vilhelmina\n\nBor: Central Umeå and in the camper Mrs Skalman\n\nBest corporate memory: I had the chance to document a sailboat trip from Tromsø to Svalbard.\n\nInspired by: Wow, so much! The brilliance of my friends, roommates and strangers, people who are passionate about whatever they do, my dog Aya and the constant change of nature.\n\nDreaming about: Have so many dreams. Many change as life goes on. I want to stay curious. Dream of working underwater and in the air. Working on nature documentaries, exploring our oceans and forests. About a cabin by the water or in the mountains where I can live with my friends, grow and develop. Going for long walks with my dog Aya. Sailing around the planet and diving from the boat. Feeling like I'm not working when I'm working. Feeling free in what I do.\n\nEducation: Professional photographer training in Gothenburg & Divemaster in Mozambique.\n\nGreatest interest: Difficult again, I seem to make up new ones all the time, but I enjoy board sports, climbing, sleeping out, seeing new places, cooking, socialising, dancing and playing music.\n\nI want to tell you about: To dare to fail. Dare to ask the stupidest questions. Dare to listen to and follow your inner voice. Just be more often.\n\nLinks\n\n\" Visit Beas website"
