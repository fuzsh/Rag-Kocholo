        "text": "About our research\n\nOur specific area of interest and expertise focuses on the impact of cancer treatment on fertility potential and the prevention of infertility through fertility preservation strategies. This new medical field has been recently recognized and is usually named “Reproductive Oncology”. In the U.S. the term “Oncofertility” has become popular. As several methods are available for fertility preservation and those are currently used for cancer patients, we consider it of outmost importance the investigation of their safety in the oncological context.\n\nOur research also encompasses the impact of several variables and interventions, such as the performance of ovarian surgery, even conservative and for benign diseases, in the development of infertility, as well as the treatment of infertility, in particular by using assisted reproductive techniques in both men and women. Psychological aspects of infertility after cancer, ethics in health care provision and a better understanding of specific patient groups’ access and barriers to healthcare are also subject of my research.\n\nOur research activity is clinically oriented and integrated into Dr Rodriguez-Wallberg clinical work as senior consultant at the Reproductive Medicine clinic of Karolinska University Hospital, where she has been the clinical responsible for the Program for Fertility Preservation since 2007. Our projects have developed into both clinical and experimental research and thus our current research network includes clinicians and basic science researchers. Our research results have contributed to the improvement of potentially safer stimulation protocols for female patients with hormone-sensitive tumors including breast cancer, one of the most challenging patient groups in the field of fertility preservation. Dr Rodriguez-Wallberg have introduced the use of aromatase inhibitors for stimulation protocols of patients with breast cancer at Karolinska University Hospital in 2010 and shared her experience with colleagues of several Swedish hospitals, who have thereafter implemented those protocols at their hospitals successfully. Several of our current projects in fertility preservation are prospective and of national coverage. Those projects include the evaluation of safety and efficacy of fertility preservation by surgical methods, such as in the case of gynecological cancer, and by the performance of assisted reproductive technologies.\n\nOur research is supported by:"
