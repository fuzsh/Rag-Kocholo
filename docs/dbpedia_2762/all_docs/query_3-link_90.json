        "text": "Salaries in Sweden by Industries and Professions\n\nSweden ranks sixth inÂ the United Nations' rating ofÂ living standards. InÂ this country, aÂ high level ofÂ healthcare, education, social welfare, coupled with developed trade unions, reflects aÂ commitment toÂ ensuring aÂ decent life for every worker.\n\nLetâs discuss the average salary inÂ Sweden, the highest and lowest paying professions, and also explore whether there isÂ aÂ minimum wage inÂ the country.\n\nPreviously, weÂ discussed how toÂ find aÂ job inÂ Norway.\n\nAverage and Median Salaries inÂ Sweden\n\nAccording toÂ the Statistical Office ofÂ Sweden (Statistikmyndigheten) for the year 2022, the average gross salary inÂ the country was 38,300 Swedish kronor. InÂ 2021, Swedes earned 36,400 SEK onÂ average. The net average figures are not provided byÂ the statistical service since tax rates vary significantly byÂ municipality, affecting the net salary.\n\nFrom 2020 toÂ 2021, the average salary inÂ Sweden increased byÂ 4.9 percent overall: wage earners received anÂ increase ofÂ 3.9 percent, while civil servants received aÂ 5.5 percent increase. InÂ kronor, this translates toÂ 1,080 and 2,260 respectively.\n\nThe average salary inÂ Sweden per month inÂ euros isÂ 3,419.43. This keeps the country inÂ aÂ strong position within the âmiddle rangeâ ofÂ the European Union inÂ terms ofÂ wage levels.\n\nFor aÂ more accurate representation ofÂ earnings, median figures are used. The median salary often provides aÂ more objective picture ofÂ the situation than the mean. The mean can beÂ significantly influenced byÂ the highest and lowest figures, even ifÂ they are singular.\n\nThe median isÂ the number that isÂ inÂ the middle ofÂ aÂ set ofÂ numbers. When calculating the median wage, all values are arranged inÂ order, and the one inÂ the middle isÂ taken: 1,000, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, 3,500. The median would beÂ 2,500.\n\nComparison ofÂ Median and Mean Salaries inÂ Sweden\n\nIndustry SectorMedian SalaryMean SalaryTotal34,20038,300Private Sector34,40039,000Public Sector33,90036,600\n\nSource: Statistikmyndigheten\n\nInÂ Sweden, the average earnings consist of:\n\nInÂ the private sector: base salary + variable allowances + benefits; overtime compensations are not included inÂ the calculation.\n\nInÂ the public sector: base salary + fixed and variable allowances.\n\nStatistics doÂ not account for individuals whose working day constitutes less than 5% ofÂ the total, nor doÂ they include positions with monthly wages below 12,000 Swedish kronor.\n\nData onÂ the average salary inÂ Sweden for 2023 atÂ the time ofÂ the articleâs publication were not yet available.\n\nSalaries inÂ Sweden byÂ Professions\n\nAccording toÂ aÂ study byÂ the trade union organization Akavias lÃ¶neenkÃ¤t, 7 out ofÂ 10 people with the highest pay work inÂ the information technology sector. Alongside them, the list traditionally includes bank managers and industry directors. IfÂ aÂ specialist works inÂ one ofÂ the major cities, their remuneration can beÂ very high.\n\nDifferences inÂ Average Salaries byÂ Professions and Municipalities\n\nCityEconomistLawyerSociologistITHRÂ SpecialistStockholm59,30055,00050,00057,50050,200Gothenburg53,90050,50045,00053,00045,000MalmÃ¶/Lund53,70049,00044,50052,00046,000South48,00046,80044,10049,00043,700Uppsala/Ãrebro/Dalarna48,20045,40045,00049,70043,000North45,90047,00043,00048,70044,100\n\nSource: Akavias lÃ¶neenkÃ¤t Salary Survey inÂ 2022\n\nEarnings inÂ High-Paying Professions inÂ Sweden\n\nThe most common position among high earners isÂ CEO. InÂ 2021, there were about 6,000 ofÂ them. Doctors also earn well, along with managers, ITÂ specialists, and civil engineers.\n\nPositionMonthly Salary (Swedish Kronor)Financial and Insurance Manager150,100Municipality orÂ County Council Director102,400Financial Broker99,200CEO90,100Specialist Physician86,400Financial and Economic Managers86,100Lower-Level Managers inÂ Finance and Insurance85,800Research and Development Managers83,800Operations Managers inÂ Mining and Construction81,000ITÂ Managers77,200\n\nSource: Statistikmyndigheten\n\nEarnings inÂ Low-Paying Professions inÂ Sweden\n\nPositionMonthly Salary (Swedish Kronor)Service Personnel23,400Berry Picker, Plantation Worker23,500CafÃ© and Confectionery Cashiers24,900Market Researcher, Interviewer24,900Restaurant Kitchen Assistants25,200Cleaner25,600Nanny25,800Wallpaperer26,100Gardener26,500\n\nSource: Statistikmyndigheten\n\nAverage Salary inÂ Sweden byÂ Gender\n\nThere isÂ aÂ noticeable gender disparity inÂ wages: men earn 40,200 Swedish kronor, while women earn only 36,200. The wage gap amounts toÂ about 10 percent.\n\nPartially, this disproportion can beÂ explained byÂ the fact that men and women are employed inÂ different sectors. When conducting standard weighing toÂ determine ifÂ both genders receive equal pay for the same position, the indicator adjusted toÂ 5%.\n\nSalary inÂ Sweden byÂ Regions\n\nInÂ some parts ofÂ Sweden, income levels can vary significantly. Municipalities with high average incomes are typically large cities.\n\nHowever, inÂ 2022, the highest earnings were inÂ Danderyd, aÂ small town near Stockholm. However, this may beÂ explained byÂ the fact that historically, many wealthy residents ofÂ the capital live inÂ this municipality.\n\nCompetition for skilled labor isÂ also strongest inÂ large cities. International companies' headquarters and the main branches ofÂ local network businesses are located here.\n\nBeyond the major municipalities, small companies are based, which cannot compete with market giants inÂ terms ofÂ payout levels.\n\nThus, inÂ Sweden, the salary ofÂ aÂ programmer, teacher, nurse, orÂ doctor will vary from region toÂ region.\n\nLabor Income inÂ Municipalities with the Highest Income Level\n\nMunicipalityAmount inÂ Swedish Kronor per YearDanderyd530,800Lomma505,900TÃ¤by485,000Vaxholm472,400LidingÃ¶470,600Nacka462,500Vellinge460,600EkerÃ¶457,600GÃ¤llivare443,300Kiruna440,600\n\nLabor Income inÂ Municipalities with the Lowest Income Level\n\nMunicipalityAmount inÂ Swedish Kronor per YearPerstorp312,700Ljusnarsberg320,400HÃ¶gsby322,100Filipstad326,800HÃ¤llefors329,000Ragunda330,000Vilhelmina330,100Ãstra GÃ¶inge330,100Flen331,600Lessebo332,900\n\nSalary inÂ Sweden byÂ Age Groups\n\nThe lowest remuneration isÂ received byÂ young people aged 18 toÂ 24, earning 23,650 Swedish kronor per year. Salaries increase from ages 20 toÂ 30 and peak between the ages ofÂ 40 and 60.\n\nCan You Earn More inÂ Sweden with Higher Education?\n\nEducation level significantly influences the level ofÂ remuneration inÂ Sweden. For example, workers with aÂ 9th-grade education earn half asÂ much asÂ those who have completed aÂ masterâs degree. AÂ bachelorâs degree graduate earns anÂ average ofÂ 59,000 Swedish kronor per year, whereas someone with only aÂ high school diploma can expect noÂ more than 27,300 kronor.\n\nEducation LevelMen (Swedish Kronor)Women (Swedish Kronor)Elementary School, upÂ toÂ 9 years28,50025,900Elementary School, 9-10 years33,10028,500Middle School, 2 years36,10031,400Middle School, 3 years35,60031,100Higher Education, less than 3 years41,80035,700Higher Education, more than 3 years51,100 42,700Postgraduate Education (Masterâs, PhD)61,10045,400\n\nSource: Statistikmyndigheten\n\nTaxes onÂ Salary\n\nSweden has aÂ relatively high tax burden. InÂ 2020, according toÂ the taxpayers' report, the tax burden inÂ the country was 10 percentage points higher than the world average.\n\nThe report states that the total revenue toÂ the treasury amounts toÂ 2,150 billion Swedish kronor per year. OfÂ these, about 700 billion goes toÂ municipalities, and 370 toÂ regions. Primarily, these funds consist ofÂ municipal tax (Kommunalskatt), which employed individuals inÂ Sweden pay monthly from their salaries.\n\nDeductions from the employeeâs salary goÂ toÂ the municipality where the person isÂ registered asÂ ofÂ November 1 ofÂ the previous year. When moving, the registration shifts toÂ the new location onÂ November 1, and payments atÂ the changed rate start onÂ January 1.\n\nThe tax rate isÂ determined byÂ the municipality, which depends onÂ the political party that governsÂ it. Therefore, when comparing, the indicator may differ byÂ several percentage points inÂ different regions ofÂ the country.\n\nInÂ 2024, the average tax rate will beÂ 32.37%. This marks anÂ increase ofÂ 0.14% compared toÂ the previous year, representing the largest growth inÂ nine years.\n\nThe highest taxes are inÂ northern Sweden, with the municipality ofÂ Degerfors inÂ the Orebro district having the highest tax rate.\n\nMunicipalityRate inÂ %Degerfors35.30Dorotea35.15Brekke35.09Sorsele34.95Windeln34.95Osela34.95Ragunda34.92Stromsund34.92Munkedal34.86Arjeplog34.86\n\nThe lowest tax rates are found inÂ the Stockholm and SkÃ¥ne districts.\n\nMunicipalityRate inÂ %Osteraker28.98Vellinge29.68Kavlinge29.69Solna29.75Taby29.93Lidingo30.22Orkelljunga30.24Nek30.26Staffanstorp30.37Stockholm30.36\n\nApart from municipal tax, residents ofÂ Sweden also pay other taxes. Approximately 100 kronor per month isÂ allocated for municipal services. Additionally, 1% ofÂ income isÂ paid for membership inÂ the Swedish Church. Even non-parishioners must contribute 26.1 Ã¶re for every 100 kronor earned asÂ aÂ burial fee (begravningsavgift). This tax isÂ not tied toÂ individual funerals; instead, the funds are used for maintaining burial sites, cremation, and burial services.\n\nFurthermore, high-income earners inÂ Sweden contribute 20% ofÂ their income directly toÂ the state (from 540,700 kronor per year / 45,000 per month).\n\nSocial benefits and employer contributions are not deducted from the net salary; instead, the employer covers these expenses.\n\nMinimum Wage inÂ Sweden\n\nAtÂ the national level, there isÂ noÂ legislatively established minimum wage inÂ Sweden. Instead, the minimum wage isÂ determined through collective agreements between employers and trade unions. Since such agreements are not mandatory, the lowest wage threshold isÂ determined byÂ the minimum salary set within aÂ specific company that has joined aÂ collective agreement.\n\nWhen considering applying for aÂ job inÂ Sweden, itÂ isÂ important toÂ inquire whether aÂ potential employer has signed any agreements with aÂ trade union, and ifÂ so, what minimum wage isÂ specified inÂ it.\n\nAsÂ anÂ example, letâs consider the indicators ofÂ aÂ popular collective agreement inÂ the service sectorÂ â the Green National Agreement for the 1st pay group (work requiring average education orÂ extensive practical experience).\n\nMinimum Wage Without Professional Experience, SEK:\n\nEffective from April 1, 2023: 25,539 per month / 147.62 per hour.\n\nEffective from April 1, 2024: 26,382 per month / 152.50 per hour.\n\nMinimum Wage with Work Experience ofÂ 6 Years, SEK:\n\nEffective from April 1, 2023: 27,339 per month / 158.03 per hour.\n\nEffective from April 1, 2024: 28,241 per month / 163.24 per hour.\n\nSource: HRF.net\n\nAdditionally, letâs provide the values ofÂ minimum wages that Kommunal (aÂ Swedish trade union with over 500,000 members) has negotiated with the Employers' Alliance. The agreement isÂ valid until September 30, 2025.\n\nEffective from October 1, 2023, Minimum Wage, SEK:\n\nOverall: 22,203\n\nFor individuals with sufficient secondary education: 24,456\n\nEffective from October 1, 2024, Minimum Wage, SEK:\n\nOverall: 23,252\n\nFor individuals with sufficient secondary education: 25,505\n\nSource: Kommunal.se\n\nThe difference isÂ quite small, but itÂ does exist. Collective agreements also specify the sizes ofÂ payments, contributions toÂ pension funds, the amount byÂ which wages will beÂ increased, and general terms ofÂ employment, such asÂ maternity benefits, voluntary resignation, etc.\n\nMigrant Salaries inÂ Sweden\n\nThe average income ofÂ individuals born abroad and coming toÂ work inÂ the country inÂ 2022 was SEK 301,700. This isÂ approximately 77% ofÂ the total wages among the native population.\n\nThe lowest earnings are noted among immigrants from Africa and AsiaÂ â 63 and 68% respectively. OnÂ the other hand, those who immigrated from neighboring Scandinavian countries have incomes roughly atÂ the same level asÂ Swedes.\n\nThe indicator increases with the length ofÂ stay inÂ the country. Those who have been inÂ Sweden for more than 20 years earn onÂ average 93 percent ofÂ the income ofÂ those born inÂ the country.\n\nCost ofÂ Living inÂ Sweden\n\nAccording toÂ the news publication Arbetet, aÂ 25-year-old unmarried individual living inÂ Stockholm needs aÂ minimum ofÂ 16,718 kronor per month (20,147 before tax deductions). This amount consists of:\n\nFood, assuming cooking atÂ homeÂ â 3,630;\n\nElectricity, insurance, media subscriptions, household expensesÂ â 3,710;\n\nPersonal expenses (clothing, mobile and internet, hygiene, leisure)Â â 2,350;\n\nPublic transportation (card)Â â 970;\n\nUnion fee and other miscellaneous expensesÂ â 490;\n\nRent inÂ StockholmÂ â 5,568.\n\nToÂ ensure that the salary matches these expenses, anÂ employee needs toÂ choose aÂ company where the collective agreement onÂ minimum wages exceeds the resulting amount. Not every agreement crosses the 20,000 Swedish kronor gross threshold.\n\nMoney Transfers from Sweden\n\nDespite the fact that migrant wages are lower than those ofÂ native-born individuals, the level ofÂ pay inÂ Sweden isÂ sufficiently high. The income earned allows foreigners not only toÂ support themselves but also toÂ help their relatives who remain inÂ their home countries.\n\nThe mobile application Korona isÂ aÂ convenient money transfer service from Europe toÂ 50+ countries. Sending transfers isÂ available from all European Union countries, including Sweden. When transferring money with currency conversion (when the sending and receiving currencies differ), noÂ commission isÂ charged."
