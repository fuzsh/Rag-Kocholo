        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Kochi shareholders have been given 10 days to incorporate their franchise and get their documents and money in place, failing which their contract too will be scrapped.\n\nMUMBAI: In a swift and unexpected move with far-reaching consequences, Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals were scrapped from the Indian Premier League on Sunday.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nThe BCCI, after its IPL governing council meeting, announced that the two franchises ’ contracts were being terminated with immediate effect for violating shareholding and ownership patterns.\n\nThe Kochi shareholders have been given 10 days to incorporate their franchise and get their documents and money in place, failing which their contract too will be scrapped.\n\nThe stunned team owners of Kings XI and RR promised to take the fight to the courts. Preity Zinta and Shilpa Shetty , the faces of their respective teams, both expressed shock and anguish through tweets.\n\nInevitably, suspended IPL commissioner Lalit Modi’s name was invoked: he is believed to have financial interests in both teams. BCCI president Shashank Manohar, however , denied any such motive, saying, ‘‘ It is not due to any single person.’’\n\nKings XI and RR have been feeling the heat right from the time the board decided to increase the number of IPL teams to 10. With major politicians and mega companies aligning with different bidders , the fight turned ugly.\n\nIn the process, Modi got engaged in a direct tussle with former minister of state Shashi Tharoor, who had guided Kochi’s successful bid. As the war became bitter, the government’s investigative agencies got into the act.\n\nThey soon discovered that the IPL had apparently violated many laws of the country; they even claimed to have spotted money-laundering trails and foreign exchange violations. King’s XI and RR, who were alleged to have benefited because of their proximity with Modi, were seen as the worst culprits.\n\nAccording to the two showcause notices, copies of which are with TOI, Rajasthan Royals have been charged with three gross violations.\n\nAddressed to Jaipur IPL Cricket Private Limited, the notice said: ‘‘ You had claimed that Emerging Media (IPL) Limited, UK (Bidco) would be the entity controlling the Indian holding company operating the franchise through its wholly owned Mauritian subsidiary. But you stepped into the shoes of the original bidder on the date of award of the franchise i.e., 14.4.2008, without being a group company or entity controlled by the bidder. Accordingly, under clause 11.2 and 11.3 of the franchise agreement, the contract has been terminated.’’\n\nRR, KINGS XI IN SHOCK\n\nMUMBAI: If the first showcause notice by the BCCI charged Rajasthan Royals with three gross violations, the other was reserved for KPH Dream Cricket private limited, the owner of Kings XI. It said, ‘‘ We have seen serious irregularities in your structure and share-holding pattern that are material and irremediable breaches of the agreement.’’\n\nIt pointed out that the KPH dream cricket company had been incorporated on March 10 2008 with only two share-holders : ‘‘ ACEE Enterprises with 9900 shares and Mohit Burman with 100 shares. The names of Preity Zinta, Ness Wadia and Karan Paul do not figure as share-holders . Mohit Burman had an insignificant stake in the newly formed company, even combining the 12.5 per cent shares held in ACEE. The other share-holders in this company are Anand Burman and Monica Burman and Gaurav Burman. The inclusion of the words ‘and others’ in the bid document cannot entitle complete strangers to take control over the franchise.’’\n\nIt further charges that ACEE and Mohit Burman transferred their shares to Dabur Investment and Windy Investments.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\n‘‘ These two companies have thereby taken control of the Franchise. On June 30, 2008, again, there were further changes in the share-holding in KPH. Under this, the 100 per cent control exercised by Dabur and Windy came down to only 23 per cent.\n\nPreity Zinta, Ness Wadia and Colway Investments (a Mauritian company), Karan Paul and Root Invest private limited (with registered office in New Delhi became the beneficiaries. They got 77 per cent of the share capital.’’\n\n‘‘ You have committed two irremediable violations, stepped into the shoes of the original bidder and violated the franchise agreement. These violations attract provisions of clause 11.3 and the contract, therefore, stands terminated.’’\n\nRR, it may be recalled, had bought the Jaipur franchise for $67m and Kings XI the Punjab franchise for $71m in 2008. The former even emerged surprise winners of the inaugural IPL. ‘‘ We have been left with no choice but to take the legal route,’’ both franchisees maintained, after the BCCI’s announcement.\n\nThe Board, however, seems to be on a strong legal wicket. Manohar said: ‘‘ We have sought top legal opinion on the matter and it has been unanimously decided to terminate their contracts.’’\n\nSoon after the BCCI decision, Rajasthan Royals’ CEO Sean Morris and his team got into a teleconference with their UK-based franchise co-owner Manoj Badale while Kings XI Punjab co-owners too got into a huddle.\n\n‘‘ We have been planning for the worst and it has come to that. We are looking at all the legal options available and well certainly be exercising our rights,’’ an official from RR said.\n\nA Kings XI Punjab official said his colleagues are ‘‘ shocked by BCCI’s decision and will certainly seek legal opinion.’’\n\n‘‘ It is their choice if they want to seek the legal route,’’ Manohar said when asked for a reaction, sounding completely unflustered.\n\nThe Kochi IPL franchise has been given 10 days to incorporate their franchise and keeping their documents and money in place. The BCCI has warned that, otherwise , their contract will also be terminated without any further consideration.\n\nFor the last couple of months, there have been internal squabbles among five stakeholders because of which they have been unable to incorporate the franchise . The Board has not sent a notice so far but will be doing so on Monday, October 11, and will ask the franchise stakeholders to respond by October 21.\n\n‘‘ It has been decided to issue a notice to the unincorporated joint venture holding the Kochi franchise calling upon them to resolve all their disputes and form a joint venture company which will hold the franchise rights,’’ the Board said in a statement.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nEconomic Survey’s plan to drop food from inflation targeting is a bad idea\n\nDollar bear cycle may fuel emerging markets rally till 2029: Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
