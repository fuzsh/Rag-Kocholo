Another lesson -(2) is that even though Korean War stepped-up depreciation had ended, our well remembered over-investment boom of 1956-57 allowed two years to go by before getting started without the benefit of ac¬ celerated ^capital cost spread. This was an obvious case Of capital, spending not dependent on a tax boost to cash flow. Further, (3) we have yet to equal 1937's plant-equipment outlay four and, it looks like, five years later — despite the population's growth and the stimulus it was supposed to provide, labor force growth, and the pump-priming to be found in the post^l954 years of chronic balance of payments deficit which did generate seme voluntary and, recently, tied dollars spent here.
