        "text": "I am truly humbled and excited to announce that MVP Factory is officially joining forces with Ness Digital Engineering and KKR to form a globally leading Digital Transformation & Innovation Platform. For our clients this means that we can now offer a truly end-to-end service, not only creating the new through digital innovation, venture building and product design, but also bringing decades of experience in modernizing and transforming the core into the mix. All while staying entrepreneurial, lean, agile and fun to work with. Thank you for your loyalty and for trusting us with your projects: DB Schenker, Venture Lab Niterra Group, JobRad GmbH | Deutschland, Haleon, Henkel, Bundeswehr Cyber Innovation Hub and many more. For our team this means more opportunities to shape the digital future of our clients - and now on a global scale, with the possibility for deeper integrations into their core to drive even more impact. I’m truly thankful to each and everyone of you - especially my partner in crime Johannes Simon, my leadership team Luisa Marie Robert Nermin, my good friends & business partners Niklas Marc Levin who had significant impact to get us here, Cezar for driving tech since the start and Laura for trusting us by building her career at MVPF. And the countless other fine humans. Without you we wouldn’t have come so far and I’m genuinely grateful. Together we will make sure that this next chapter will become an even larger success than the last one. This is a massive milestone after starting as a tech start-up over six years ago, setting out to automate MVP development. Little did I know about where this would be going. But we ate our own dogfood, abandoned our original idea, constantly challenged the status quo, validated new ideas with our clients and ultimately ended up where we are today: a leading corporate venture building & product design studio. It’s been a ride with many side quests (MVP Match, Alpakas, Minly, Mossy Earth to name a few) and I wouldn’t want to miss any of it. Meeting Ranjit and Ness for the first time last year we directly saw the synergies of working together, originally planning to collaborate on geographical expansion. When KKR acquired Ness Digital Engineering, we started to dream bigger what would ultimately culminate in this transaction - joining forces to build a globally leading, specialized services firm in Digital Transformation & Innovation - strategic brains with execution muscle. Design with engineering. Venture Building with core modernization and replatforming. Becoming a true one-stop-shop for our clients. Thank you for the warm welcome Peter, Rohan, Christopher, David, Lydia and all NESSians. Again, from the bottom of my heart: To all the current or former team members, clients, partners, freelancers, friends - THANK YOU. I love you all. It’s day 1 again and I’m all up for it. To the next six years of MVP Factory within its new home. Let’s get building and the best is yet to come! Philipp ❤️"
