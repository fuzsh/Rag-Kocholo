A courageous 12-year-old girl declared brain dead due to a rare autoimmune illness, has given the gift of life to four people through organ donation. Her kidneys, liver, and heart were sent from Wadia Hospital in Parel to patients in need across Mumbai. Her legacy continues to stay with our \"Wall of Honour\" as she continues to inspire us all with her selfless donation of giving the gift of life to others. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to these real-life superheroes, whose legacy of love continues to shine bright in our Hospital.
