Over 350 projects were taken up as part of this program in 2011-12 and covered every function and region. A structured program of continuous improvement was also undertaken in several manufacturing units, using kaizen, productive maintenance and total quality management. A separate program office has been set up to monitor these cross-functional projects on an ongoing basis, which involves a large number of employees across the organization. To drive ‘go to market’ efficiencies, dairy and bakery distribution and sales were integrated to provide a higher width and depth of coverage and availability for dairy products. Technology investments were made, in the form of hand-held computers for order booking and capturing of relevant market place information. Your Company’s international business also expanded with export from India growing 36.4% and the 2 companies in the Middle East growing at 32.5%.

BRANDS Brands are the fountainhead of your Company’s profitable growth and during the year, significant investments were made in product development, supply chain and advertising and promotion to make Britannia brands relevant and distinctive. Your Company invests a lot of time and effort in talking with consumers and crafting different, better and special products to delight and satisfy a vast array of their consumption occasions. As mentioned earlier, several new and renovated offerings were successfully introduced across the entire portfolio that include: NutriChoice Multigrain Thins and Roasty, Pure Magic, Treat Fruit Creams, Marie with Honey and Oats, 50-50-Snackuits, Good Day Fresh Bake Butterscotch and Chocolate Ecstasy, etc. Additionally, the Britannia bread range was augmented with Multigrain, Honey-Oats, 100% Whole Wheat and Multifiber breads. A Gourmet cheese range consisting of slices and spreads, as well as the Tiger-Zor chocolate and almond milk provided significant impetus to the Dairy business. Your Company has and will continue to invest aggressively in brand building programs, including the capability for establishing a continuous pipeline of innovations and renovations. Your Company has also collaborated with reputed academic institutions and other companies to complement its efforts and build strong platforms for sustained and significant product categories and businesses. YourCompanyiscommittedtobuildingacompetitive edge at the front-end, driving effectiveness by using technology powerfully and is the only food company that has introduced a ‘Hand-Held’ device for its sales people to book orders, enabling the capture of real time and accurate information to service demand with speed and precision. 6. SUPPLY CHAIN AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS The focus here continues to be on reducing complexity, improving stock replenishment at depots and distributors and reducing total cost to deliver. Capacity has been added in several existing manufacturing units and 2 new Greenfield units in Hajipur, Bihar and Khurda, Orissa were completed and commissioned towards the end of the year. Additionally, technology innovations that increase manufacturing productivity have been implemented in several units and will be rolled out where relevant. New tools are being introduced to deal with reducing the network complexity of manufacturing units and depots across the range of product lines, thereby improving availability at optimal cost. Your Company has, where relevant, created operational synergies through combining the sales, distribution and replenishment structure and infrastructure for domestic Bakery and Dairy. Procurement processes have been reinforced to ensure greater competitiveness and transparency in price discovery, through the use of e-platforms. 7. QUALITY STANDARDS The importance on comprehensively addressing quality right through the value-chain has been encompassed in a new program in the Company – ‘Q-Next’ where the emphasis is to continually raise standards of quality, not just in products and packs but also processes and systems. To maintain sustained focus on all operational excellence programs, a new function for Manufacturing Excellence has been set up to drive various initiatives like Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Total Quality Management (TQM) and ongoing improvements through a well-structured Kaizen program. As mentioned earlier, 4 manufacturing units were given the prestigious IMC Ramakrishna Bajaj National Performance Excellence Award in the manufacturing category. The Corporate Office at Bangalore also received an award, the requirements of which are based on the Malcolm Baldrige Award for Business Excellence in the USA. Additionally, the Delhi factory received the National Food Safety Award and the Gwalior factory a commendation certificate from the Confederation of Indian Industries. To strengthen the Company’s capability for exports to the EU, both these factories have also been certified for BRC (British Retail Consortium) standards. 8. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY The relevant and smart application of Information Technology enables your Company to improve operational efficiencies and decision effectiveness. During 2011-12 your Company implemented a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system to enhance the productivity of its Research and Development processes. A Supplier Portal was also created to effectively manage procurement operations.

A project has also been initiated to transform and integrate supply chain processes using an IT solution to enable dynamic demand planning and effectively address challenges in managing the supply chain.\n\n10. Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 6 9. ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY Energy conservation and the use of clean fuels continue to be a priority area for your Company. Following a successful pilot test at one unit, a new design oven, to conserve energy requirements, was commissioned in other units. The use of environment friendly fuels like propane, LPG, PNG and biomass for baking purposes has been extended wherever such fuels are available. Creation of multi-fuel flexibility has led to a significant shift towards use of cleaner fuels and more such opportunities will be harnessed in future. Additionally, a pilot test is in progress to use polymer fuel made from recycled plastic. The endeavor is to continually look for opportunities to shift to clean fuels and conserve energy. In the spirit of reducing waste and encouraging re- cycling, a wet waste composting facility has been set up at the Bangalore Office, in collaboration with a local NGO and a Waste Management System has been implemented that fully recycles both the dry and wet waste. The plan is to extend this to other office locations and factories, for which a pilot is already under way at a contract packing unit in Bangalore. As part of its overall safety initiatives, your Company has implemented several safety measures at all its offices, mainly in terms of: • An Emergency Preparedness Plan at the Corporate Office • Safety Audits as per National Building Code for all Regional Offices • Installation of Safety and Security systems (Fire Alarms, Access Control and Surveillance Systems) at regional offices • Fire fighting mock drills in most locations. Your Company is committed to being an environmentally responsible company and ensuring the health and safety of all its employees, contractors and visitors at the workplace. In line with this objective and to create a “Zero Accident” culture, all its factories and joint ventures will be OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety Systems) certified during the next two years in a phased manner, the work for which has already begun. Your Company is benchmarking its occupational health and safety performance indicators across all manufacturing locations to identify, monitor, record and adopt best practices in its operations. Its approach to safety and health in the workplace is an essential part of its value proposition for employees and several health and safety initiatives are undertaken on an ongoing basis. As part of OHSAS certification, GAP assessment on occupational health and safety has been undertaken by Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) at the Company’s factories in Delhi and Rudrapur and at Super Snacks, a contract packer. 10. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) Your Company believes that the best way to be socially responsible on a sustainable basis is to embed that into its business model. It, therefore, approaches CSR as Corporate Sustainable Responsibility and is focusing on 2 areas – food based solutions to increasing nutrition and energy conservation, which includes waste management, elaborated earlier in the note. Its health and nutrition efforts embody the removal of unhealthy ingredients like transfats from its biscuit recipes and the addition of micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals) to almost 60% of the volume it sells through brands like Tiger Glucose, Marie, Vita MarieGold, Milk Bikis, Britannia Bread, Tiger Chocolate and Badaam Milk. Your Company has also pioneered relevant products to address specific health concerns like diabetes, which is fairly prevalent in India and was the first to bring to market, energy-snacks, with a low glycemic index specially created for people with diabetes – Nutrichoice Diabetic Friendly Essentials. Last year, your Company added to the portfolio a savory, multi-grain roasted snack, Roasty, also with a low glycemic index. As you are aware, Indians, especially children and women, suffer from wide spread micronutrient deficiency – the most notable being Iron Deficiency Anaemia which affects almost 60% of school going children. Your Company has specially formulated iron-enriched biscuits that can supplement the main, hot meal that is given to children in school. The biscuit becomes an acceptable and welcome ‘carrier’ for iron supplementation. This initiative is executed through a range of partnerships with several NGOs and supply of iron-enriched biscuits to government schools in several states. During 2011-12, your Company partnered with the Karnataka Nutrition Mission and adopted 2 villages to comprehensively address health and nutrition concerns of children, adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women. The work involves a baseline understanding of the relevant nutrition and health parameters, creating awareness among women of good health and hygiene practices, educating them on the need for adequate food and nutrition for themselves and their families, supplementing their diet with micronutrients using biscuits as the carrier for these and measuring the health and nutrition indicators over a period of time.\n\n11. 7 Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 Your Company continues to pursue relevant partnerships with key organizations in Nutrition like GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), UNWFP (United Nations World Food Program), WBI (World Bank Institute), CGI (Clinton Global Initiative), etc. As mentioned in previous reports, the “Britannia Nutrition Foundation” was set up with the belief that every child in India has the right to growth and development through good food – every day. The work of the Foundation is in three core areas – disseminating scientific knowledge in the area of nutrition, building awareness of the massive malnutrition challenge and its solutions and creating a platform for multi-sectoral dialog and informed action. The Foundation does this through an annual symposium during the National Nutrition Week in the 1st week of September, each year. The topic of the symposium on 2nd September 2011 in New Delhi was, “Making a case for all stakeholders to come together to combat malnutrition”. The Symposium had 18 international and national speakers of eminence from the scientific and medical fraternities, the development sector and the Government. The Symposium shared success stories from other countries in combating malnutrition along with scientific advancements in the area. The final session was a panel discussion, televised on a leading national news channel and included an eclectic mix of participants from the nutrition, policy making, corporate and communication sectors, in addition to participation from the audience, several of whom are members of civil society networks and work in the development sector on issues relating to health and nutrition. For the first time, student papers were invited and awards given for new thinking. The jury for these awards was drawn from the academic and scientific community focusing on nutrition. Your Company also sponsored and participated in health and nutrition seminars to further the cause of awareness building. Some of them are: • International Life Sciences Seminar, New Delhi, April 2011 • Functional Foods and Beverages Seminar, Mumbai, July 2011 • India Diabetes Summit, New Delhi, August 2011 • 56th Annual National Conference of IPHA (Indian Public Health Association), Cochin, February 2012 • PFNDAI seminar on Carbohydrates for a Healthy Future, Mumbai, February 2012 • International Symposium on Access@Base of Pyramid, February 2012 11. PENSION The proceedings in the suit filed by the Pensioners Welfare Association (the Association) in the Hon’ble Court of City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore, are in progress.

A. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY (a) Some of the energy conservation measures undertaken during 2011-12 are: (i) New design oven using a different heating system successfully commissioned at one unit, resulting in significantly reducing energy consumption. (ii) Installation of pre-heating mechanisms to reduce fuel and power usage. (iii) Installation of energy efficient motors in turbulencefansofovensandVariableFrequency Drives (VFDs) in dough tilters at Uttarakhand factory to save power consumption. (iv) Usage of fuel catalyst in DG sets of Delhi factory to improve the combustion efficiency. (v) Replacement of reciprocating compressors in the chilling units by energy efficient screw compressors at Delhi factory. (vi) Replacement of inefficient motors in circulating fans of baking ovens and root blowers of the ETP by energy efficient motors to conserve energy, at Delhi factory. (vii) Use of pre-heated secondary air in the APV line at Kolkata factory to substantially reduce fuel consumption in the oven. (b) Additional Investments and proposals, if any, being implemented for reducing energy consumption: Your Company has already implemented the initiatives stated above and will extend and expand them wherever applicable. Additional investment of ` 7.5 crores has been planned for 2012-13 in various projects related to further reduction in energy consumption. (c) Impact of measures at (a) and (b) above: In spite of a significant increase in fuel and energy costs and a shift in the product mix in our factories towards products which consume more energy per tonne of biscuits produced, both electricity and baking fuel consumptions were maintained with a marginal increase. ANNEXURE ‘A’ TO THE DIRECTORS’ REPORT Form ‘A’ Form of disclosure of particulars with respect to conservation of energy: For the year ended 31 March 2012 31 March 2011 ELECTRICITY (a) Purchased (gwh) 13.47 11.67 Total amount (` crores) 7.53 5.78 Rate / Unit (`/kwh) 5.59 4.95 (1gwh = 1,000,000 kwh) (b) Own generation (i) Through diesel generator (gwh) 1.56 2.27 Unit per litre of diesel oil (kwh/Litre) 3.19 3.10 Cost / Unit (`/kwh) 11.45 10.73 (1gwh = 1,000,000 kwh) (ii) Through steam turbine / generator Units (KL) Nil Nil Unit per litre of fuel oil / gas Nil Nil Cost / Unit (`/KL) Nil Nil (iii) Others / Internal generation (Baking fuel consumption) * Quantity (Billion cal) 64,587 56,839 Total Cost (` crores) 28.3 20.4 Rate / Unit (`/Billion cal) 4,386 3,593 Consumption per unit of production Bakery products Biscuits (MT) 126,008 119,452 Electricity (kwh/MT) ** 119 117 Baking Fuel (Billion cal/MT) ** 0.51 0.48 * Different baking fuels like furnace oil, piped natural gas, coal gas and HSD are used at the factories. ** Of Equivalent Production. The rate per unit of electricity purchased was higher at ` 5.59 per kwh, compared with ` 4.95 per kwh in the previous year, due to increase in rate per unit of Electricity. The increase in cost per unit of own generation as well as the rate per unit of baking fuel is due to the increase in cost of HSD and other fuels used for baking.\n\n14. Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 10 Consumption of energy per tonne of biscuit produced has marginally increased in our own factories because of a higher proportion of premium varieties in the product- mix, which consume more fuel and electricity per tonne of production.

Chartered Accountants Firm registration number: 101248W Natrajh Ramakrishna Place: Mumbai Partner Date : 28 May 2012 Membership number: 32815\n\n19. 15 Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS A) INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT Bakery Your Company’s Bakery business comprises biscuits, bread, cake and rusk and the market growth across these categories has been 15-18%. In biscuits, Britannia brands have about one-third share and in all other categories Britannia is the only national player. In the domestic market, competitive intensity in both Bakery and Dairy will continue to increase as more players, both multinational and local companies, compete for a greater share of the large and growing packaged food segment, of which biscuits account for the highest share. We expect growth to be driven through heavy investment in advertising & promotions as well as infrastructure investments to build scale and support new introductions, both in the premium and discount segments. The attractiveness for consumers to migrate to branded, packaged food will provide the tailwind for market growth and this will be evident throughout the country – in maha metros and mini metros, in emerging towns and cities as well as rural India. Even with a relative slowdown in the economy – GDP growth between 6.5-7% in 2012-13, that will reduce disposable income and discretionary spending, we expect the market to grow 12-15%, with differential rates of growth across geographies and categories. Your Company is well positioned to participate in this growth and the challenge will be to do so, profitably. Dairy India is both the world’s largest producer and consumer of dairy products. Total size of the dairy market is ` 234,600 crores, growing at 5% and dominated by increasing consumption and sale of milk. The market that converts milk to value-added products like dahi, yoghurt, cheese and dairy based beverages is growing strongly, albeit from a narrow and small base of around ` 11,000 crores. Upgradation from unbranded and loose products to packaged milk and milk products, at accessible prices and price-points, as well as the emergence of higher value niches, anchored on superior differentiation will be the leading growth vectors. Competition in value added dairy will intensify as more players enter the market supported by significant brand and infrastructure investment. B) BUSINESS STRATEGY The major challenges around which we have based our strategic priorities, include the ability to handle greater competitive intensity; non-secular growth that calls for a careful choice on which geographies, consumer segments and product categories to participate in; and the uncertainty in commodity prices that for imported products like palm oil are further exacerbated by a weakening rupee. Bakery Your Company’s key priority is to generate profitable growth, anchored by the 3 priorities of revenue management, cost management and innovation, under-pinned by a drive towards operational excellence and capability enhancement right through the system. Revenue management comprises a greater thrust on better understanding consumer needs and commercializing them profitably through the design and delivery of our products. Building leadership economics will be the thrust of cost management both in terms of cost efficiency and effectiveness, right through the value-chain. Innovation involves the creation of new value through new product and benefit propositions as well as through the application of technology to processes and systems. Marketing and sales effectiveness will focus on extracting the maximum out of our investment in brands and in their advertising, promotions and display at point of sale. Towards this goal of extracting the maximum sale, significant investments have been made in the diffusion of information technology and ongoing training for the sales people. ‘Go to market’ synergies have also been created through the integration of the bakery and dairy sales and distribution system, to present ‘One Face of Britannia’ to our customers. And in order to create impact at points of purchase, your Company has invested in building a competitive edge in merchandising capabilities by training a dedicated merchandising team, equipped to create a ‘Britannia World’ in stores and on shelves. Your Company has implemented several initiatives to strengthen its supply chain capabilities – from procurement to logistics and including manufacturing and distribution. The manufacturing and depot footprints are being aligned to reduce distance to market, in line with our distributed\n\n20. Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 16 manufacturing units. New investments in capacity creation and capability to handle a distinctive and differentiated range of products are being made in Greenfield units that will lead to greater ownership of manufacturing capacity by your Company. This will lead to significantly higher capital investments over the next few years as new Greenfield units are created, owned and operated by Britannia. Dairy The Dairy strategy builds on the business momentum created in the last year of growing differentiated dairy products, extracting benefits from an integrated sales and distribution system and diversified sourcing. To drive this harder, the focus on understanding consumers and meeting their needs will be enhanced to create and sustain higher levels of purchase and consumption. Your Company has implemented several initiatives in all areas of operations to create an efficient and robust supply chain and build cold chain capabilities to enhance sales and service to the trade and final consumers. BritanniaNutritionFoundationwillcontinuetowork on initiatives related to malnutrition in children and women and will partner with the government, NGOs etc., to pilot and scale up successful initiatives. C) SEGMENT INFORMATION The primary business segment of the Company is Foods comprising (i) bakery products – biscuit, bread, cake & rusk, and (ii) dairy products – milk, butter, cheese, ghee, dahi, milk-based ready to drink beverages and dairy whitener. D) OUTLOOK As mentioned earlier, in the domestic market, your Company expects the growth momentum in branded, packaged foods to continue, with a relative slow down in the rate of growth – 12-15%, in the near term. Profitable growth will also be challenged by the volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices, together with the inflationary impact of a weaker currency for imported products like palm oil and fuel, as well as laminates that are linked to the price of crude. Simultaneously, the growing demand for packaged, branded products at affordable and accessible price points will fuel consumption and attract new players to the market, both local and multinational companies. To win in this competitive environment, calls for a combination of brands and packages that are relevant and distinctive and therefore preferred and purchased by consumers. The focus in both bakery and dairy is to strengthen the differentiated products where your Company has a relative advantage, through renovations that offer a superior experience, innovations that create new benefit and consumption propositions and effective cost management through the value-chain that generates profitable growth. The business of your Company is its brands and the consumer insight that drives their creation and commercialization is a competitive advantage. All investments, therefore, at the front-end of the business and in the infrastructure that supports this will be led by the opportunities for increasing purchase and consumption across consumer and geographic segments. International markets present an opportunity to segment and channel resources to generate profitable growth and the identification and selection of geographies is critical. Your Company’s focus areas continue to be the large and growing Middle East markets, with their own manufacturing base in Dubai and Oman, and North America. Additionally, your Company will pursue opportunistic sales where the economics are favorable. E) FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONALPERFORMANCE Sale of products in the domestic market for bakery products and exports from India (which is the standalone performance for your Company), increased 18.3% – from ` 4,230.59 crores last year to ` 5,005.66 crores in 2011-12. PAT grew 28.5% – from ` 145.29 crores to ` 186.74 crores. The key financials are as under: ` in crores 2011-12 2010-11 Sale of Products 5,005.66 4,230.59 Total Expenditure 4,780.35 4,074.38 Profit Before Tax 252.37 198.06 Income Tax 65.63 52.77 Net Profit 186.74 145.29 F) OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS Opportunities in India stem from the consumption appetite of a large and growing consumer base across allsocio-economicgroupsthataspiretobetter quality standards and greater variety to satisfy their needs. Branded and packaged food is ideally suited for both in-home and out of home consumption, driven by segmenting consumption opportunities across a diverse and heterogeneous set of consumers. Added to that is the fact that only 9% of food consumed in India is packaged and branded, thereby creating a large opportunity for growth. In an almost paradoxical situation, the pursuit of these large consumption opportunities and the migration from unbranded and loose products to branded and packaged food is often undertaken competitively by discounting categories that erode\n\n21. 17 Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 the overall profit pool. In this context, the emphasis on cost management and differentiation becomes critical to drive profitable growth. And that is the path your Company will pursue. G) RISKS AND CONCERNS The major risk and concern areas are related to driving profitable and high double-digit growth in an environment of slower economic and disposable income growth, uncertainty and volatility of commodity prices and greater competitiveness that could increase the cost of doing business. H) INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND ADEQUACY The Company’s internal control systems are commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its business and ensure proper safeguarding of assets, maintaining proper accounting records and providing reliable financial information. An external independent firm carries out the internal audit of the Company operations and reports its findings to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. Internal Audit also evaluates the functioning and quality of internal controls, and provides assurance of its adequacy and effectiveness through periodic reporting. The Company has a code of business conduct for all employees and a clearly articulated and internalized delegation of financial authority. These authority levels are periodically reviewed by management and modifications, if any, are submitted to the Audit Committee and Board for approval. The Audit Committee also reviews the risk management framework that is periodically updated. I) HUMAN RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS Greater employee engagement, supported by an energizing performance management culture that holds people accountable for results and behavior and rewards them for the value they generate, is a fundamental component of your Company’s people strategy. Towards that, the focus is on enhancing both individual competencies – skills, knowledge, attitude, and organizational capabilities – processes, metrics, structure and culture. This is facilitated through a structured ‘Goal Alignment and Cascading Program’ that aligns individual goals with Company deliverables and tracks both business and individual performance on an ongoing basis. The focus is on results and the demonstrated leadership behaviors that produce those results. A large number of initiatives have been taken to diversify learning and experience by engaging and challenging employees to work on different projects and in cross-functional teams that provide the foundation for new learning and development. Over 350 projects were completed last year by these cross-functional teams in the areas of cost efficiency and effectiveness, quality and service level improvements. Various forums have also been created to engage factory employees on an ongoing basis through Quality circles, Kaizen initiatives, TQM and TPM initiatives. Your Company has also started ‘lunch and learn’ sessions every month to expose employees to a range of topics that are interesting and pertinent to them and this includes outside speakers from a wide variety of areas and topics. Top performers and high achievers of the Company are felicitated with rewards and appreciation for their exemplary achievements and leadership behaviors at the Annual Conference. A formal Reward and Recognition Program has also been launched where quarterly achievement will be recognized. Equally, on-boarding processes and orientation programs for new employees have been strengthened to enable faster integration. Your Company is also working towards creating a ‘Learning Culture’, wherein employees take ownership for their self-development and impact on business results. In 2011-12 your Company worked towards improving its industrial relations environment and several of the grass-roots projects mentioned above were instrumental in creating a more engaged workforce. The pending case before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court pertaining to Mumbai Reay Road factory closure in 2004, was amicably settled. As of March 31, 2012, the Company had 1987 employees (including workmen – 800) on its rolls. J) CAUTIONARY STATEMENT Statements in this Management Discussion and Analysis describing the Company’s objectives, expectations or predictions may be forward looking within the meaning of applicable laws and regulations. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied. Important factors that could make a difference to the Company’s operations include raw material availability and prices, cyclical demand and pricing in the Company’s principal markets, competitive actions, changes in Government regulations, tax regimes, economic developments in India and in countries in which the Company conducts business and other incidental factors.\n\n22. Britannia Annual Report 2011-12 18 REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 1.
