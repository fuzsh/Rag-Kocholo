        "text": "Distinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2014\n\nLocation: Delhi-NCR\n\nPosts: 4,111\n\nThanked: 65,720 Times\n\nRe: Go First Airlines files for bankruptcy\n\nIn response to several posts above on what ails our airlines industry my take is as follows. This is my own amateur view from what little I know caveated by that fact that being now in my second innings I am not a part of the industry on a day to day basis at all. So, to that extent my knowledge is jaded.\n\nThe product an airline sells has a two characteristics. First it is self-expiring like a hotel room or a newspaper. The moment the flight taxies out the unsold seat and its revenues and profits are lost forever. Think of a manufacturing business where a percent of your inventory must be thrown away each day.\n\nSecond the largest cost component outside depreciation and lease rentals is fuel cost with its uncertainty of pricing and tax rates. In India the latter are unusually high and States levy their own surcharges that add to making it more economically unviable. Govt's in India still see air travel as a game to be skinned to extract tax money from the rich. So, in short, a self-expiring product mixed with volatile input prices and relatively inelastic revenue prices and it is a recipe for a challenge.\n\nTo run an airline well anywhere in the world needs tight process discipline and lean work methods. The so called glamour is only a glean that has no relation to the process rigour. In India only Indigo and Vistara have it.\n\nWhile many things in our aviation policy have gone right some have not. Things like the Udaan scheme, new airport terminals, new routes, privatization, are all big positives. Compared to 1989 we are literally more than light years ahead. However, two things DGCA has not learnt. First is to outgrow its deep and often vindictive inspector raj mentality. Second, upgrading the talent, knowledge and outlook of its staff. Third staying out of strategy, pricing and dispute settlements. For that we need an enlightened regulator with competent board of Govt & industry and independents. DGCA is a Govt department to oversee flight safety but due to lack of any other oversight body they willy nilly get dragged into higher issues for which they have neither the mandate nor the tools or knowledge. Airport Economic Regulatory Authority {AERA} was supposed to be one such body but has not fulfilled its promise. It should have been the Aviation Economic Regulatory Authority.\n\nComing to Go First or Go Air as it was known. First, I would not blame them for selection of P&W over CFM. It was a error many made and we are wise only in hindsight. P&W's new tech engine was supposed to be the new big breakthrough. Their fault lies in the fine print of the contract with P&W. That contract does not tie down P&W to warranty performance and provide replacements regardless of how many failures occur. Ordering 40 aircraft and a little over 80 engines does not give you the heft to make a giant like P&W kneel. For that you need 250 aircraft 550 engines orders life Indigo's. Then the buyer cracks the whip. Also the lease rental on a 250 order will be about 100 basis points cheaper than that on a 40 aircraft order. In an industry where every 10 basis points counts that is a chasm.\n\nTo add to this the Govt India, unlike Govt of China fails spectacularly in backing Indian companies facing situations with giant MNCs. In China, in a similar situation the CP of China would have made life miserable for P&W's existence within China. But not here. The same DGCA which will interfere in pricing, a matter beyond its remit will look the other way in situations like this!\n\nFinally Go First was not a sharply run airline. Not as poor as the political game Spicejet is but not a Vistara either, middling somewhere in between. Wadia's clearly are not hands on businesspeople like the owners of Indigo. I saw it every day in the quality of forward planning and detailing in areas I would touch them. So, all these factors have merged together to form one sad implosion.\n\nIn the end coming to fares. Fares in India are quite low in general. Compared to the recent past, say 2003 they are a vast improvement in favour of the customer. If our fuel taxation were to be reduced by say 5 percentage points while not changing prices that would give the industry the leeway to build reserves and become profitable.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nLast edited by V.Narayan : 3rd May 2023 at 21:59.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2013\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 37\n\nThanked: 302 Times\n\nRe: Go First Airlines files for bankruptcy\n\nWhile G8 might not have been the best run airline, and the owner/promoters did the professional managment no favours, I don't think we can absolve P&W either.\n\nIMO, P&W's customer service has been comparable to those of food delivery/ride aggregtors, or online retailers.\n\nNumerous airlines around the world have had large parts of their fleet grounded because of P&W issues, and haven't gone bankrupt only because they have large enough fleets, or are govt. subsidised and are able to absorb the losses.\n\nLufthansa:\n\nLufthansa AG said a third of its Airbus SE A220 fleet in Zurich has been temporarily grounded because of issues with Pratt & Whitney engines\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/artic...rich#xj4y7vzkg\n\nAir Egypt:\n\n\"seven out of twelve Airbus A220s from EgyptAir are currently grounded due to the same engine issues\"\n\nAir Senegal:\n\nAir Senegal originally planned to operate five of the A220s, but due to the engine problems, only one of the aircraft is currently parked, with the rest delayed.\n\nAir Tanzania:\n\nAir Tanzania, .... the countrys national airline is currently flying only one out of its four A220s in the fleet due to scarce spare parts and repair slots\n\nSource for the above 3: https://airspace-africa.com/2023/03/...al-woes-mount/\n\nTurkish Air:\n\nTurkish Airlines faces technical problems with its Pratt GTF engines and has been forced to ground four planes, CEO Bilal Ekşi said in an interview.\n\nTurkish Airlines is seeking leased engines and support from Raytheon Technologies Corp.s Pratt & Whitney unit to repair its grounded Airbus SE A320neo aircraft ahead of the peak summer travel season, as more airlines grapple with defects on their powerplants ahead of the busiest travel season.\n\nAir Baltic:\n\nAir Baltic Corp AS CEO Martin Gauss said that Pratt could not keep the given promise again on improved turnaround times, and it was forced to lease additional capacity starting this week in order to operate its schedule. It had previously said that a quarter of its 40 Airbus A220 jets were out of service\n\nSource: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/turkish-air-talking-very-seriously-with-pratt-on-engine-issues#xj4y7vzkg\n\nThere are a lot more airlines having trouble with P&W that I recall reading about over the least couple of years. These are just the ones I can find sources for where the management has actively complained in the press.\n\nThe CSeries is affected more than the A320 as it has only the GTF as a single engine option, unlike the 320Neo which has the Leap alternative. Most airlines inluding Indigo etc. changed their orders to the Leap as soon as they saw the GTF issues."
