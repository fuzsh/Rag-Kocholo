No. MCS-123/2018-20; Published on: Every alternate Monday R100\n\nYEAR END\n\nSPECIAL\n\nâ·\n\nP:03\n\nBusiness India u the magazine of the corporate world From the Publisher\n\nu 3 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nMaking predictions is fraught with all kinds of difficulties. And for every\n\nprediction it is easy to find a contrary one. But we all use the word loosely,\n\nusually to mean educated guesses about future possibilities.\n\nOn this basis one can try looking ahead at what 2023 might hold for\n\nus. Globally, the turmoil of 2022 will begin to settle down partly â but\n\nat a cost. With inflation continuing to be a concern in the West there\n\nwill continue to be monetary tightening to the point of many major\n\neconomies slipping into recession. This will bring down commodity\n\nprices, including oil, faster. But the big issue will be the continuing war\n\nin Ukraine and the ripple effect it has, particularly in Europe. So, while\n\nlower commodity prices will benefit India, the looming recession in our\n\nmajor export markets does mean a greater emphasis on our own domestic\n\nmarkets and demand.\n\nBusiness India has said on several occasions that our economy will be\n\ndriven, for many years, by domestic demand and growth of consumption\n\nin India. Leaving aside boasts of overtaking the UK and becoming the\n\nfifth largest economy, the harsh reality in India is that our consumption\n\nlevels are pitifully low. For Indian consumption levels to reach even where\n\nthe West was 50 years ago will still take well over a decade!\n\nTherefore, looking at the country as a whole, and not looking at merely\n\npockets of relative affluence of the bigger cities, there is a huge need\n\nand almost endless demand in all major sectors across the economy.\n\nWhichever measure one adopts for consumption of food, clothing,\n\nhousing, transportation, education and health, we have a long way to go\n\nin every field. This means that there will continue to be demand, year\n\nafter year, across the board, till our people reach decent levels across each\n\nof these basic needs.\n\nThis means that our food production will continue to grow, while also\n\ndiversifying into fruits and vegetables. Our major industries like steel,\n\ncement, chemicals, etc also will continue to grow to satisfy the need to\n\nbuild more homes, and to build new highways and railway lines. Across\n\nthe economy there will be growth and expansion. Of course, there will\n\nalso be slowdowns in export dependent industries, looking at slowing\n\nglobal demand. This also means our stock markets will continue to grow\n\nyear after year, with the normal corrections and small setbacks along the\n\nway. This is what explains our bullishness on Indiaâs growth.\n\nThe only question that will be is how fast can we grow. Will our growth\n\nbe 5 per cent or 6 per cent or 7 per cent in any year. The big issue will\n\nbe whether our governments, in the States and the Centre, can push our\n\ngrowth to consistently reach 7 per cent or 8 per cent or even 9 per cent. It is\n\nimportant to remember that these are not unrealistic targets. It is possible to\n\ntotally transform countries in 25 years. While the West did it much earlier,\n\nmore recently the countries of East Asia and SE Asia did so. And of course,\n\nChina has done so too. It is only if we reach these levels that we will be able\n\nto fulfil our dream of being a developed country by 2047.\n\nWe wish our readers all the best for the holiday season and the New Year!\n\nWe Are On www.businessindiagroup.com\n\nPublisher Ashok H.

Even as the world is overcome by the Yuletide spirit and prepares for the\n\nNew Year festivities to follow, Rohingya refugees\n\nare battling for their lives off the Indian coast. In\n\nIndia, thousands are celebrating the weddings of\n\ntheir near and dear ones, engaged in the kind of\n\nrevelry and ostentation on display only in Indian\n\nmarriages. Yet, in the Bay of Bengal, about 200\n\nRohingya Muslim refugees are stranded in a boat\n\nwith a failed engine with no food or medicine.\n\nThese people, including children, are dying. Yet\n\nno one cares to bat an eyelid or express concern.\n\nAppeals over the recent weeks to Union\n\ndefence ministryâs Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre, urging it to send out rescuers, have\n\nnot elicited any response. Clearly, no one is losing\n\nsleep over the plight of the ragtag bunch â neither\n\nthe government of India, nor our political parties,\n\nleast of all India Inc.\n\nThe mention of India Inc may raise eyebrows.\n\nThe ultra-wealthy, especially citizen investors,\n\nhave the wherewithal to create a better life for fellow human beings. Their wealth can be directed\n\nto worthy causes. Remember 2015, as Europe\n\nstruggled to address the worseningÂ refugee crisis, several billionaires around the world stepped\n\nup, offering shelter and jobs. In 2016, billionaire investor George Soros committed $500 million to meet the needs of migrants and refugees\n\nin response to the Obama administrationâs âCall\n\nto Actionâ initiative, asking the US companies to\n\nhelp ease the migrant crisis. Wy canât our leading\n\nbusinessmen also step up to tackle a refugee crisis\n\nin our neighbourhood?\n\nCurrently, not many governments want to\n\ntake up the Rohingya refugeesâ cause, thereby\n\nleaving them in the lurch. The UNHCRâs pleas\n\nfor intervention have been âcontinuously ignoredâ\n\nby several South and Southeast Asian countries.\n\nUNHCR claims it had alerted the Indian authorities, requesting immediate action, as the boat\n\nhas been sighted near the Indian territory of the\n\nAndaman & Nicobar Islands. The episode has\n\nalso found little mention in the Indian media,\n\na section of which demonises the Rohingyas as\n\nagents of jehadists. The government views them\n\nas trouble makers. Rohingyas in fact are the new\n\nânowhere peopleâ.\n\nMore than 200 Rohingya refugees had boarded\n\nthe boat, with hopes of a new start. But, days after\n\nleaving their refugee camp in Bangladeshâs Cox\n\nBazar, the engine on their boat failed. For almost\n\nthree weeks, they have found themselves adrift in\n\nthe Andaman Sea. Food and water ran out more\n\nthan 10 days ago and, as many as 20 people have\n\nalready died, including children, according to\n\nthe UN sources. Indeed, of late, many Rohingya\n\nlives have already been lost in maritime crossings,\n\nas they are using dangerous sea and land routes\n\nto escape, which highlights the sense of desperation and hopelessness experienced by them in\n\nMyanmar.\n\nThey are forced to flee from the overcrowded\n\nrefugee camps, where conditions are dire and\n\nwomen are at risk of sexual assault and violence.\n\nThe camps have swelled over the past five years,\n\nas hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled a brutal campaign of killing and arson by the Myanmar military in the western Rakhine state. Illegal\n\ntraffickers smuggle them out of the camps and the\n\nperilous voyage to relative safety takes weeks, as\n\nconditions at sea are challenging.\n\nAt least 20,000 Rohingya refugees are registeredÂ in India with the UNHCR and an estimated\n\n1,100 of them are living in a camp set up in the\n\ncapital New Delhi. Home Ministry officials argue\n\nspeciously that, an influx of Rohingya refugees,\n\nlike those from Bangladesh, places an economic\n\nburden on the state and poses security risks.\n\nHowever, it is the ambiguity inherent in the\n\ncountryâs refugee policy that gets reflected in our\n\ncallous approach to the problem. Our refugee\n\npolicy is guided by political expediency. While\n\nRohingyas are treated as âuntouchablesâ, the government has no problem in extending financial\n\nsupport to over 20,000 Chin refugees from Myanmar, who had fled to Mizoram, following the 2021\n\nmilitary coup. India also hosts a large number of\n\nSri Lankan Tamil, Tibetan and Afghan refugees.\n\nIndia has been hesitant to bring a refugee law\n\nbecause equality and the rule of law shall have to\n\nbe established. Only standard operating procedures are issued by the Home Ministry to deal with\n\nforeign nationals in India who say they are refugees. But basic humanity demands giving shelter\n\nto people who are running from persecution and\n\nviolence and rescuing people who are in the danger of losing their lives. After all, India gave shelter\n\nto thousands of refugees from East Pakistan fleeing Pakistani military oppression before the country was liberated. And now Bangladesh, despite\n\nits recent troubles, has taken over a million Ronhigyas in. That should be our New Year spirit. u\n\nP:07\n\nBusiness India u the magazine of the corporate world Editorials\n\nu 7 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nF\n\nootball has a long-standing popularity in India. Yet, the country has failed\n\nto produce a world-class player like the\n\nArgentinian great Lionell Messi or the French\n\nstar Kylian MbappÃ©, who scored a hat-trick in\n\nwhat is being rated as one of the greatest finals\n\nin the tournamentâs history. This is unlike\n\ncricket, another imported game, where Indian\n\nlegends have etched their name in the gameâs\n\nhistory. In recent ties, Indian footballers have\n\nstruggled to make it to Europeâs biggest\n\nleagues. Worse still, India has never played in\n\na World Cup.\n\nDue to this relative lack of success, many\n\nfans would never expect India to host a World\n\nCup. But Inda can flip the situation to its\n\nadvantage. For one thing, World Cups have\n\nbeen used to bolster football fever in countries before, like Japan and South Korea did in\n\n2002. There is also the argument that, if Qatar\n\ncan host a World Cup, why canât other nations\n\nwithout a history of international football?\n\nIndia fits into this category and, given its rising economic status, should make a pitch for\n\nthe World Cup also.\n\nNow that the Qatar show is over, all eyes\n\nwill be on who will host the coming World\n\nCup tournaments. While the US, Canada and\n\nMexico have jointly bagged the chance to\n\nhost the 2026 cup, there is still suspense over\n\nthe hosting nation for FIFA World Cup 2030.\n\nA number of nations has braced up for the bid.\n\nUkraine officially joined Spain and Portugal\n\nin their joint bid, which amazed everyone, as\n\nit is in a state of war with Russia. Morocco is\n\nalso eyeing to get the venue in 2030, after losing the bid for 2026 to the North American\n\nnations. Moreover, South American nations\n\nUruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile are\n\nalso in therace with a joint bid option.\n\nThis suspense over FIFA World Cup 2030\n\nhosting nation is not going to get resolved\n\nbefore 2024, when the FIFA congress sits\n\nfor the voting. That means that the 2030\n\nevent is still up for grabs. Our football associations and federations should get their act\n\ntogether, backed by the governmentâs diplomatic skills.\n\nAnd, why not? Despite our lack of success\n\nin international tournaments, India is one\n\nof the oldest football-playing nations, with\n\nBritish soldiers introducing the sport in the\n\n1800s. The Durand Cup was founded in 1888\n\nand is the oldest worldwide football competition, aside from the FA Cup and the Scottish Cup. The legendary football coach, Syed\n\nAbdul Rahim, was responsible for the golden\n\nage of Indian football during the 1950s. It is\n\nsaid that our team was arguably the best in\n\nAsia in this period. The All India Football\n\nFederation established the National Football\n\nLeague in 1996, eventually morphing into\n\nI-league before the Indian Super LeagueÂ came\n\nalong.\n\nAlthough itâs not the most well-known\n\nfootball league, the Indian Super LeagueÂ has\n\nseen several world-class greats see out their\n\ntwilight years at clubs like ATK, Goa and\n\nMumbai City. Players like Roberto Carlos,\n\nRobert Pires and John Arne Riise all played\n\nin the ISL, significantly improving its status.\n\nThe league, however, still has a long way to go\n\nbefore itâs recognised as one of the top football leagues.\n\nFootball fans the world over would never\n\nhave wagered on Qatar to host the 2022 World\n\nCup, so why canât India have a turn at some\n\npoint in the future? If anything, India has a\n\nricher history in the sport than the tiny gulf\n\nstate. One problem is infrastructure, which\n\nQatar aggressively fixed with a controversial\n\nstadium-building programme. India doesnât\n\nneed to start from scratch regarding stadiums.\n\nVenues like theÂ Salt Lake Stadium near KolkataÂ can hold at least 100,000 fans, which is\n\nmore than enough for a flagship World Cup\n\nstadium and is owned by the government of\n\nWest Bengal. Perhaps Mamata Banerjee can\n\ndivert some of her energies into also pitching for the event. After all, India has also\n\nmanaged to successfully host two FIFA U-17\n\nWorld Cups and is now trying to bid for AFC\n\nAsian Cup\n\nIt would be a shame if India never got to\n\nhost a World Cup. The competition would\n\nbring a much-needed focus to our vast nation.\n\nIn Qatar, Indian companies got on to the\n\nsponsorship bandwagon, aware that a football fiesta lifts consumer confidence, markets\n\nand investor sentiment. Messi was the brand\n\nambassador for edtech major Byjuâs and Amul\n\nwas the official sponsor of both the Argentina\n\nand Portugal teams. Even though Indian players were missing from the field, Indian companies had made their mark through some\n\ndeft advertising. u\n\nFootballâs endearing attraction\n\nWhy canât India bid for the 2030 Cup?\n\nP:08\n\nEditorials Business India u the magazine of the corporate world\n\nu 8 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nSeason of hope\n\nCome what may, this will be a year of Hope!\n\nThe ever-ebullient Mr Hope seemed a bit\n\nsubdued. Firmly ensconced in his favourite wooden oak armchair in the secondfloor study of Hope Villa, he was ruminating\n\nover the turn of events of the last few days of\n\nthe year. While his eyes seemed to be closed\n\nbehind his tinted sunglasses, his little grey cells\n\nwere whirring rapidly. Everything had gone well\n\nin the week ahead of the penultimate one. The\n\nH-20 meeting organised for the first time ever,\n\nhad gone down much better than expected. The\n\n20 junior Hopes from across the world who had\n\ncome down to Hope Village had really done a\n\ngood job. The one-page executive summary presented by each of the juniors in the day-long\n\nconference were all on the expected track. No\n\nroom for alarm, globally.\n\nYes, many regions were predicting a slowdown, which could eventually turn into a\n\nrecession. Hope distinctly recalled the promising young Hope, who in his Yankee drawl had\n\nsaid that the probability of the economy in his\n\nregion going into recession was as high as 70\n\nper cent. Since this was the first time that a\n\nregional Hope had made a presentation, there\n\nwas no real benchmark for judging the accuracy\n\nof this promising young Hope. It could be more\n\nthan the normal slowdown, another junior\n\nHope had reaffirmed in a stiff upper lip manner. Slowdown or no slowdown, our region will\n\nkeep on growing. After all, we are better than\n\nthe best, the Hope from South Asia had concluded. But there were a few contrarians who\n\ncould really say with certainty that their particular region would not undergo a slowdown or a\n\nmild or severe recession.\n\nMr Hope knew he would have to take the\n\ninputs of all the junior Hopes who had prepared\n\na detailed report and distilled it into a one-page\n\nexecutive summary, into account. Hope knew\n\nthat Santa with his Ho-Ho sounded very optimistic as if this year was as good as so many\n\nearlier ones. But, Hope reasoned, Santa was\n\nSanta and his Ho-Ho did not really have to be\n\ntaken seriously, despite the fact that Santa had\n\nhis ear in every house. After all, his opinions\n\nwere mostly based on interactions with kids\n\naround the world. And most kids were joyous\n\nlittle fellows who did not really care whether\n\nthe economy was drifting up or down or even\n\nstagnating.\n\nHope made a mental note to talk to Santa\n\nabout this and involve Santa in interactions\n\nwith the other segment of humanity also. In\n\nthese trying times, he reckoned, people have to\n\ndo more than one job.\n\nUltimately, Hope felt the decision was his\n\nand his alone. Mr Hopeâs father and his father\n\nbefore him and his entire clan of Hopes used\n\nto give out a bulletin year after year for centuries at a stretch. Hope ruminated that a few lazy\n\nancestors did not do any homework and merely\n\ncopied the report ditto from one of the reports\n\nin the ancestral library. The yearly report of\n\n2023 would be circulated far and wide across\n\nthe regions and would ultimately find a place in\n\nthe same ancestral book in the hallowed library.\n\nHope was happy that earlier in the year he\n\nhad inked an agreement with the two unwholesome pairs, Gloom and Doom, that they would\n\ngo away on a vacation in Alaska for at least a\n\nfortnight at the beginning of every year. Smiling gleefully at the fact that while the ostensible\n\nreason inked in the 462-page document was to\n\nallow the pair to reinvigorate themselves in the\n\nchilling cold, Hope knew it would also give him\n\ntime to ensure the uneventful and unhindered\n\ncirculation of his report for at least a fortnight.\n\nThe all-expenses-paid trip was, after all, a small\n\nprice to be paid to get Gloom and Doom out\n\nof circulation, even it was only for a fortnight.\n\nHope knew the duo could strike at the heart of\n\neveryone and spread panic rapidly. After all,\n\npanic builds on panic, as was seen in the spread\n\nof Covid since 2020. The discovery of a mutant\n\nwas used to the hilt by Gloom and Doom and\n\nhumans actually thought it would be the end of\n\nthe world. Gloom and Doom were past masters\n\nat spreading negativity, with fearful humans\n\nmore open to negative forces than positive. This\n\nwas really pity that negativism is more readily\n\nacceptable than positivity brought by Hope.\n\nShrugging off his diffidence he got up from\n\nhis chair to look at the chirping birds and\n\nbutterflies outside his villa. He made up his\n\nmind to write out his report. He had already\n\nthought of the conclusion. âCome what may,\n\nthis will be a year of Hope. Irrespective of the\n\nstate of the economy in the region, Hope will\n\nrule supreme. Optimism and cheerfulness will\n\nreturn faster. This is a season of Hope. A season that even the most battered amongst the\n\nhumans will feel that the new year will bring\n\nbetter tidings than last year. Mankind has survived several slowdowns and recessions. This\n\ntoo will pass. u\n\nP:09\n\nBI size.indd 2 23/11/22 5:12 PM\n\nP:10\n\nListening Post Business India u the magazine of the corporate world\n\nu 10 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nUttarakhand\n\nInternational?\n\nUttarakhand may soon have an international airport.

While announcing the companyâs second quarter results in a press\n\nrelease in July 2022, Suresh Narayanan, chairman & managing director,\n\nNestle India, observed: âPet Food business has evolved positively and has\n\nan exciting future, with pet adoption\n\non the rise after the pandemic. There\n\nare greater synergies with evolution in\n\nchannel strategies now than when the\n\nbusiness was launched in 2018. The\n\npet food business of Purina Petcare\n\nIndia has gained traction amongst\n\nIndian pet owners, establishing the\n\npet food brands across key segments,\n\nwhile building a robust pet specialty distribution network. Going\n\nforward, leveraging Nestle Indiaâs network would further accelerate the\n\ngrowth of pet food business in India\n\nand, for Nestle India, its portfolio has\n\nbeen enriched by a promising business\n\nfrom the last quarter ended 31 December 2022.â\n\nDuring the same month â July 2022\n\nâ Emami acquired 30 per cent stake\n\nin a pet-care start-up Cannis Lupus\n\nServices India. The company offers\n\nayurvedic remedies for pets under\n\nthe brand âFur Ball Storyâ. âWith the\n\nawareness of the psychological and\n\nphysical benefits of having a pet at\n\nhome increasing, people have started\n\ngradually identifying themselves as\n\nâpet parentsâ rather than being just\n\nâpet ownersâ,â said Harsha V. Agarwal,\n\nvice-chairman & managing director, Emami, in a press release. âThey\n\nare also looking for best treatments\n\nfor common ailments faced by their\n\npet children, especially in the form of\n\nayurvedic and herbal remedies. The\n\nbrand, âFur Ball Storyâ offers unique\n\nayurvedic products for the well-being\n\nof the pets and meets the emerging\n\nconsumer needs and aspirations.â It is\n\nalmost as if the idiom âit is a dogâs lifeâ\n\nhas lost its meaning! u\n\n[email protected]\n\nP:15\n\nBusiness India u the magazine of the corporate world Column\n\nu 15 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nAsurprising new agreement on biodiversity\n\namong nearly 200 governments will have\n\nprofound implications for Indian authorities and companies, including agriculture and\n\nfishing, if it goes beyond being high-minded sermonising to actual implementation of its confusingly vast scope. It was at a conference (COP15) in\n\nMontreal that a new Global Biodiversity Framework was agreed on that would safeguard at least\n\n30 per cent of the worldâs land, inland waters,\n\ncoastal areas, and oceans by 2030.\n\nCurrently, 17 per cent of land and 10 per cent\n\nof marine areas are protected. The agreement has\n\nbeen called historic, because of its large ambitions and is surprising, because of low expectations when the talks began. Many developing\n\ncountries, especially Africans, complained afterwards that Huang Runqiu, COP15âs Chinese president, used the final hours to push through an\n\nunsatisfactory text without debate.Â Â\n\nOpportunities for Indian companies active in\n\ngreen technologies arise from the planned creation of a new global biodiversity fund of $20\n\nbillion a year by 2025, and $30 billion a year by\n\n2030, within an existing Global Environmental Facility. Its actual size will depend on talks\n\nin 2023 because rich country aid agencies are\n\nalready under severe stress following their gigantic expenditures to support humanitarian needs\n\nof the Ukraine war.\n\nThe diplomatic pressure is intense because\n\nof catastrophic consequences for all human\n\nlife resulting from the loss of biodiversity worsened by climate change. So, the new fund will\n\nnot fall by the wayside.Â An important new measure will require businesses to assess and report\n\ntheir dependence on biodiversity to force them\n\nto make preservation a part of their normal governance and risk analysis by investors.\n\nThe framework includes efforts to end subsidies for human activities that could be harmful to nature and especially contains a pledge\n\nto end at least $500 billion a year in government subsidies to businesses in agriculture and\n\nfishing. With some fanfare, the European Union\n\nhas pledged â¬7 billion towards biodiversity\n\nconservation between 2021 and 2027, but\n\nmost of its 27 member states have ignored to follow it up.\n\nHarmful government subsidies are estimated\n\nat $1.8 trillion (2 per cent of global gross domestic product). Achim Steiner, head, UN Development Programme, said those subsidies worsen\n\nbiodiversity loss by encouraging unsustainable\n\nfarming and fishing practices, among others. The\n\nIntergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and\n\nEcosystem Services, a UN scientific body, rang\n\nloud alarm bells in a 2019 report that one million\n\nanimal and plant species are in danger of extinction. A 2020 estimate by the World Economic\n\nForum found that more than half of global GDP\n\n($44 trillion) was moderately or highly dependent on nature. More than 80 per cent of all subsidies harmful to nature go to agriculture, water,\n\nand fossil fuel.\n\nThe International Energy Agency reported that\n\nnearly $640 billion goes as subsidies to the\n\nfossil fuel industry each year and $520 billion\n\ngoes to agriculture practices that cause soil erosion, water pollution, commodity-driven deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions and conversion\n\nof natural habitats. About $350 billion annually\n\nis spent on unsustainable use of fresh water causing water pollution and harms to ecosystems. The\n\nharm is worsened by $90 billion in subsidies for\n\nconstruction, $85 billion for transport and $50\n\nbillion for industrial fishing.Â Â\n\nThe fact is that most of these huge and\n\nrepeated subsidies are given to companies in rich\n\ncountries, which are now asking India and others\n\nto cut back on aid given especially to agriculture\n\nwhile they continue their own harmful practices.\n\nThis calls for caution in Delhi. It should not rush\n\ninto implementing the new framework without\n\nfirst seeing evidence that the richer countries are\n\nnot using it as a constraint on others, while continuing their own bad behaviour.\n\nThe World Bank notes biodiversity loss is a\n\ncritical development issue that affects poorer\n\ncountries disproportionately. The volume of subsidies harmful to development is âat least five\n\nor six times more than the amount of funding\n\ndevoted to protecting biodiversityâ. The dismal\n\nfact is that less than $150 billion a year is spent\n\non conserving biodiversity. Protecting nature is\n\nrepeatedly emphasised as the right way to combat\n\nclimate change since deforestation and irresponsible land use by humans make up about 25 per\n\ncent of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSteiner says oceans are becoming devoid of\n\nfish stocks, so fishing vessels must go farther and\n\nfarther to find enough fish. That involves subsidising their diesel costs so they can travel farther,\n\nbecause fish stocks closer to where they live have\n\ncollapsed. u\n\nA historic agreement?\n\nIt has large ambitions but low expectations, even as the talks begin\n\nThe author is an\n\ninternational affairs\n\ncolumnist for Business\n\nIndia.

After making headlines for the acquisition of two\n\nprized cement companies from Holcim,\n\nthe Adani group companies ACC and\n\nAmbuja Cement have suspended operations in the state, due to soaring transportation cost. A war of attrition has\n\nbroken out between the Adani group\n\nand the state government on the issue.\n\nPolitical observers see the decision\n\nto suspend the plantsâ operations as\n\na retaliatory move against the newly\n\nelected government looking to reduce\n\ncement rates in the state, which has\n\nbeen a hot button issue in the state.\n\nVoters had been complaining about\n\nhigh cement prices in the run-up to the\n\nelection.\n\nThe closure of plants has brought\n\nmany development works to a grinding halt in the state, which has requirement of 6,000 tonnes of cement per\n\nday. Most of the governmentâs godowns\n\nhave run out of stock. The issue has\n\nalso disrupted the supply of cement to\n\nwholesalers. The Centre is said to be\n\nclosely watching the development.\n\nThe new government has not taken\n\nkindly to the decision to suspend operations in the Adani-owned plants.\n\nâShutting down plants without prior\n\nnotice is unlawful,â says R.D. Dhiman, chief secretary, HP government.\n\nIt has decided to buy cement from\n\nUltratech to complete the government\n\nconstruction works.\n\nClosure of the plants was bound to\n\nlead to shortage of cement,Â as Ambuja\n\nCement plant at Darlaghat produces\n\n2 million tonnes (mt) per annum.\n\nThe Barmana plant produces 3,000\n\nmt cement per day too. Cement from\n\nthe Barmana ACC plant, which has\n\nthe capacity to produce 15,000 tonnes\n\ncement and clinkerÂ daily, is supplied\n\nacross HP, Punjab and Haryana through\n\ntrucks. The employees of the two plants\n\nalso face loss of jobs.\n\nHigher freight rate\n\nBoth companies had been negotiating with transport unions to bring\n\ndown costsÂ as it has to transport both\n\nraw material and finished goods.In\n\na letter written to transport union,\n\nAmbuja Cementâs unit at Darlaghat\n\nsaid theÂ plants are under severe pressure to reduce cost of operations to\n\nsustain themselves in the market. âIn\n\nthe current market scenario, due to\n\nhigh transportation cost we are finding it difficult to compete in the market. If this continues our plants will\n\nbecome unviable,âÂ it added.\n\nIn response toÂ media queries, Adani\n\nCement, in a statement, has said: âOur\n\nplants at Gagal and Darlaghat have been\n\nincurring losses for quite some time\n\nnow, with no signs of improvement\n\ndue to stiff resistance from transportation unions, ignoring the larger cause of\n\nemployment generation and contribution to the stateâs revenue.â Due to the\n\nstand of the truck unions demanding\n\nfreight rates higher than the prevailing\n\nmarket rates, the company was compelled to shut down both plants with\n\neffect from December 15, as this has\n\nmade the plants unviable, it added.\n\nâThe freight rate in our plant areas\n\nin Himachal Pradesh is exorbitantly\n\nhigher than the market rate,â Adani\n\nCement management informed. âWe\n\nhave requested truck owners to reduce\n\nthe existing prevailing freight to R6\n\nper tonne per km in line with the recommendations of the Permanent\n\nCommittee Report constituted by HP\n\ngovernment. We deeply condemn the\n\ninsensitiveness of these transporters and\n\nregret the impact on over 9,000 people\n\nand various community development\n\ninitiatives around the Darlaghat region,\n\nwith an estimated revenue loss of about\n\nR2.26 crore per day to the state exchequer,â the statement added.Â\n\nAt present, the transportation rate\n\nfor per quintal of cement isÂ R10.58\n\nper km in hilly areas andÂ R5.38 in the\n\nplains. But truck operators say that\n\ncement companies are asking them\n\nto reduce the rates toÂ R6 per km per\n\nquintal in the hills. âWhat will truck\n\nowners earn, if they agree to these\n\nrates as fuel consumption is higher in\n\nthe hills?â\n\nThe new CM, who has his hands\n\nfull in meeting other challenges like\n\nconstituting the new Himachal cabinet, has delegated the responsibility\n\nto the Chief Secretary, who says the\n\nmatter of transportation costs is solely\n\nbetween the management of the company and transport unions. However,\n\nhe has asked the deputy commissioners of Bilaspur and Solan to intervene in\n\nthe matter.\n\nThe stateâs civil supplies corporation, which purchases cement from\n\ncompanies on rate contracts, has now\n\nalso written to the public works, rural\n\ndevelopment and Jal Shakti departments to make alternative arrangements for buying cement to continue\n\nthe development works. K.C. Chaman,\n\nMD, Civil Supply Corporation, says\n\nthe demand for cement has increased\n\ndue to the closure of the plants. âThe\n\ncorporation has more than 118 cement\n\ngodowns in the state, but stocks at\n\nmany of them have dried up,â he said.\n\nClearly, the last word on the tussle\n\nis yet to be said. u\n\nRak e sh J oshi\n\n[email protected]\n\nHimachal tussle\n\nCement plants face heat\n\nP:18\n\nGovernment & Politics Business India u the magazine of the corporate world\n\nu 18 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nF\n\nor some strange and unknown\n\nreason, the Goods & Services Tax\n\nCouncil continues to side-step\n\nthe move to deal with rising GST disputes by setting up appellate tribunals,\n\nas envisaged at the launch of the new\n\nindirect regime five and a half years\n\nago. A report with recommendations\n\non the functioning of these tribunals\n\nwas submitted by a group of ministers (GoM) of the council way back in\n\nAugust was part of the recent Council\n\nmeetingâs agenda. However, it wasnât\n\ntaken up and for now and GST disputes\n\nwill continue to clog high courts.\n\nThere is considerable disappointment within the industry that this\n\nmatter was not taken up. With GST\n\nbeing a relatively new tax regime,\n\nthere are a number of cases of interpretation of the law, classification of\n\ngoods & services and the rate, pending\n\nat various stages.\n\nThe meeting was expected to decide\n\non the composition and regional distribution of appellate tribunals that\n\nwill handle GST disputes. It was also\n\nexpected to decide whether there\n\nshould be one GST appellate tribunal\n\nper state or whether one per region\n\nwould suffice and how many members\n\nshould be there from the Centre and\n\nstates.\n\nThe report of the GoM, headed\n\nby Haryana deputy chief minister\n\nDushyant Chautala, has suggested setting up a principal bench at New Delhi.\n\nThe tribunal will hear appeals against\n\norders passed by the GST appellate\n\nauthorities. Appeals for cases involving up to R50 lakh would be heard by a\n\nsingle member while those above this\n\nthreshold would be heard by a division\n\nbench of at least one judicial and one\n\ntechnical member.\n\nGST Appellate Tribunal\n\nRegional benches will also be set up\n\nin states. In larger states, depending\n\non the population, up to five benches\n\nmay be set up. Each regional bench\n\nwould have one technical member,\n\nwhich would be a senior tax official.\n\nHowever, initially, the GST Appellate Tribunal may be set up on the lines\n\nof the Customs Excise and Service Tax\n\nAppellate Tribunal (CESTAT) and will\n\nat select centres only. The CESTAT is\n\nheadquartered in Delhi with regional\n\nbenches at Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Chandigarh and Hyderabad.\n\nIf the GST Tribunal had been\n\napproved by the council, it would have\n\nfigured in Finance MinisterÂ Nirmala\n\nSitharamanâs speech in the Union Budget 2023-24. Amendments to the Central GST Act would have been taken up\n\nin the Budget Session of Parliament\n\nto provide for all benches of the same\n\nkind with a principal bench in New\n\nDelhi where the tribunalâs president\n\nwill sit.\n\nOn the other hand, the council,\n\nconvened after a gap of six months,\n\ncleared what officials called a âpathbreakingâ move to decriminalise certain offences by taxpayers, with a\n\nhigher R2 crore threshold for initiating prosecutions, except in cases\n\ninvolving fake invoices. Aimed at\n\nreducing disputes and chances of tax\n\npayer harassment when the stakes\n\nare not too high, these changes will\n\ntake time to materialise. The Centre\n\nintends to introduce these changes in\n\nthe Finance Bill of 2023-24 to be presented on 1 February 2023, and state\n\nlegislatures will have to amend their\n\nrespective GST laws too. The move\n\nalso left the industry disappointed as\n\nit believes the prosecution threshold\n\ncould have been raised further.\n\nThe council also took up a handful of other items â a 5 per cent levy\n\non husk of pulses used as cattle feed\n\ninput was scrapped, while the tax rate\n\non snacks such as Fryums and SUVs\n\nwas âclarifiedâ. These minutiae apart,\n\nthe larger take-away is the outcomes\n\nnot pursued â including the tribunal\n\nproposal, virtually half the agenda\n\nwas abandoned and discussions were\n\ncurtailed to a little under three hours.\n\nSitharaman said this was done as some\n\nstatesâ representatives had other âcommitted businessâ to attend to. This is\n\nmost surprising as the 17 December\n\ndate was notified well in advance. It\n\nis not clear if some States, otherwise\n\nvocal about their pending GST dues\n\nand reforms to improve their revenue share, sought any rescheduling, if\n\nthey were short of time. It is being said\n\nthat some state finance ministers are\n\nbusy formulating their budgets for the\n\ncoming year, but the Union Budget\n\npreparations did not hold back Sitharaman from making time for this critical dialogue.\n\nThis casual approach of some states\n\ntowards the apex GST governance\n\nmechanism means delays in efforts to\n\nplug tax leakages in the tobacco and\n\ngutkha business, or fix the tax for the\n\nbooming online gaming business. It\n\nalso bodes ill for the effectiveness of\n\nthe council. u\n\nRak e sh J oshi\n\n[email protected]\n\nWhither GST tribunals\n\nCouncil meeting sidesteps move\n\nP:19\n\nBusiness India u the magazine of the corporate world Government & Politics\n\nu 19 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nHimachal Pradesh will soon\n\nbecome the fourth state in the\n\ncountry to restore the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), which guarantees\n\npension at 50 per cent of the last drawn\n\nbasic pay. The promise had boosted the\n\nbeleaguered Congress partyâs electoral\n\nprospects as government employees\n\nand retirees form a significant portion\n\nof the hilly stateâs electorate. Of course,\n\nreverting to OPS will tax the Stateâs\n\nexchequer. Data shows that pension\n\npayments form nearly 25.6 per cent of\n\nStatesâ own tax revenue â 80 per cent\n\nfor Himachal â but fall to close to a still\n\nsubstantial 12 per cent of the total revenue receipts of states.\n\nThe New Pension Scheme (NPS) that\n\nhas been in place in many states since\n\n2004 allows employees to contribute\n\nto their pension corpus from their salaries with matching contribution from\n\nthe government, is more robust as this\n\ncorpus is invested through Pension\n\nFund Managers and eases the Stateâs\n\nburden. The NPS has built a substantial\n\ncorpus and subscriber base over time.\n\nThe Congress-led UPA government\n\nhad indeed taken forward the pension\n\nreforms by the previous NDA regime\n\nand this is how the NPS has become relevant over the years. It is now breaking\n\na consensus on pension reforms.\n\nEconomists believe that reverting to\n\nOPS amounts to an imprudent option,\n\nas it will only benefit organised government sector employees, increase\n\nthe fiscal burden of carrying these payments and take up a significant portion\n\nof the stateâs budget, thereby curtailing its outlays on general welfare as a\n\nwhole. This holds good even if it allows\n\nfor short-term electoral dividends and\n\ncaters to those who form the backbone\n\nof the government.\n\nHowever, it appears that the centre is rattled by the political fallout of\n\nthe move towards the OPS. Currently,\n\nthe schemes under NPS do not guarantee any kind of returns or benefits as\n\nthey are market-determined.Â TheÂ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is now set\n\nto roll out the worldâs first minimum\n\nassured return scheme (MARS) by MayJune next year under theÂ NPSÂ guaranteeing 4-5 per cent annual returns on\n\nthe pension corpus for ten years.\n\nMaking them safe\n\nThe product is being launched more\n\nthan nine years after the PFRDA Act\n\n2013, passed by the UPA government,\n\nmandated the regulator to launch a\n\nMARS product. It took time as there\n\nwas no such product globally for reference. The recent political controversies\n\nappear to have expedited the launch\n\nof the product to make pension funds\n\nmore âsafe and attractiveâ.\n\nThe minimum annual contribution\n\nfor MARS would be R5,000 per annum\n\nand the upper age for subscribers would\n\nbe below 50 years, keeping in mind\n\nthe retirement age of 60. The guaranteed returns from MARS would be\n\nnearly half of the actual returns under\n\nthe he market-linked NPS schemes\n\nand it would also come with a higher\n\nfund management fee. Because of the\n\nrisks involved in guaranteeing returns,\n\nthe fund management fee could be\n\naround 25 basis points (bps) compared\n\nwith a maximum of 9 bps under other\n\nNPS schemes, yet lower than 150 bps\n\ncharged by insurance companies for\n\ntheir insurance products.\n\nFund managers would have a solvency ratio of 1.5 (asset/ liabilities) for\n\nMARS, meaning there will be requirement for them to infuse additional capital to run the scheme. No solvency\n\nratio is prescribed under the marketreturn-based NPS schemes. So, to make\n\nsuch a product attractive, the PFRDA\n\nwill give the flexibility to fund managers in the investment ratio of the MARS\n\ncorpus in government securities, corporate bonds and equities to generate higher returns over and above the\n\nguaranteed rate.\n\nInterestingly, in India or abroad,\n\nthere is no product like this. âWe are\n\ngoing to give a basic return guarantee\n\nanywhere between 4-5 per cent and all\n\nthe upsides in market returns will go to\n\nthe subscriber,â says Supratim Bandyopadhyay, chairman, PFRDA.\n\nThe average returns on NPS corpus\n\nhave been around 10 per cent in the past\n\n13 years for the central government and\n\nstate government employees, who form\n\nthe bulk of the subscribersâ AUM corpus\n\n(about 80 per cent of R8.5 lakh crore as\n\nof December 17, 2022). Currently, subscribers get R50,000 deduction annually\n\nunder the Income Tax ActÂ for their NPS\n\ncontribution over and above R1.50 lakh\n\nallowed under Section 80C.\n\nAccording to extant norms, at the\n\ntime of exit from NPS, a subscriber gets\n\n60 per cent tax-free lump sum and\n\nthe balance 40 per cent must be used\n\nto buy annuities for regular income\n\ntill death of subscriber and his/ her\n\nspouse; thereafter, principal amount is\n\nreturned to nominees. Similar benefits\n\nwill be available for MARS too. u\n\nRak e sh J oshi\n\n[email protected]\n\nInsulating NPS\n\nAssured returns under pension scheme\n\nP:20\n\nColumn Business India u the magazine of the corporate world\n\nu 20 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nWhere there is a need, there is a market for it\n\ntoo. Invariably, the needs have been taken\n\ncare of by various companies through\n\ntheir products and services over many decades.\n\nHowever, some unfulfilled needs still remain to be\n\ncateredÂ to. These âneed gapsâ provide a great opportunity for brand marketers to come up with innovative products and services, to be able to be pioneer\n\nnew segments and to introduce new concepts, which\n\nhelp achieve consumer satisfaction.\n\nAs the consumers evolve, their needs change too.\n\nBut some latent needs manifest at times; also, there\n\nare some needs which are created, while there are\n\nsome existing needs which get fine-tuned. Sometimes, new needs emerge to the forefront; while\n\nsome needs disappear and become âno needâ.\n\nâUnfulfilled needâ marketing is a great opportunity for companies in products and services to\n\nbe able to initiate a new category and be the firstmover in that category, which gives him/ her\n\nan advantage, because he/ she has been able to\n\ntap an unmet gap. It is interesting to note that\n\nmany market leaders of today were able to identify and tap the need gap of unfulfilled needs.\n\nLet us have a look at the new needs. Many new needs\n\nhave been identified and have been catered to. In\n\n1995, when the first mobile phone was used in India,\n\na new need was being catered to and that unfulfilled\n\nneed was satisfied and a new market got created. To\n\nbe able to walk and talk, to be able to communicate\n\non the phone and later on through data, pictures,\n\nvideos, voice --Â Â the new needs were being fulfilled.\n\nToday, over one billion people in India are able to\n\nuse mobile phones while they walk and talk, while\n\nthey travel, while they are indoors or outdoors,\n\nwhile they are in the country or abroad. They can\n\ncommunicate easily to anybody, anywhere, at any\n\ntime. This unfulfilled need was a gap and the mobile\n\nphone industry and service providers were able to\n\nsatisfy this. This consumer need has now become a\n\nbillion dollar industry and is growing at an incredible speed.\n\nThe best thing about a new need is that it does\n\nnot remain new forever. It keeps evolving. And today\n\nthe mobile phone and communication industry has\n\nevolved with not only talking, audio, sharing videos,\n\nwatching or surfing the internet and communicating in novel forms, but also in terms of its generations. The latest launch of 5G is an amazing jump of\n\nthis need going to the next level and increasing the\n\nspeed of communication. The mobile phone domain\n\nhas now graduated from feature phones to upscale\n\nsmartphones.\n\nIn fact, this unfulfilled need being satisfied has\n\nopened up so many businesses, generating lots of\n\nemployment and helped create revenue and profits.\n\nThis has made the industry go to a different height\n\nin sales and profit.\n\nThe latent variety is another type of need which,\n\nfor a long period of time, remains latent, hidden\n\nand invisible -- and then, it suddenly gets manifested and becomes blatant. While going out to\n\nshop, eat and pick things that you need from various stores is of course a part of human nature, there\n\nwas always a latent need for people to deliver things\n\nto your home and do it efficiently, easily, with\n\nspeed. Home delivery was a latent need, which has\n\nnow exploded and manifested itself in the field of\n\nall sorts of products and services. It is one of the\n\nimportant latent needs which, in the last few years,\n\nhave been able to give consumers satisfaction and,\n\nat the same time, build a vast and growing home\n\ndelivery service business.\n\nWhether it be home delivery of food services\n\nor groceries or garments or appliances, all types of\n\ngoods and services are being ordered online through\n\nan app. Getting products and services delivered at\n\nhome from any part of the world is a major latent\n\nneed, which has been manifested and is making not\n\nonly the consumers happy, but also putting the service provider companies in profit too -- in topline, as\n\nalso bottomline.\n\nThe home delivery offerings are not restricted\n\nonly to products, they also extend to other services\n\nlike having a haircut, beauty treatment or even a\n\nphotography session at home, instead of going to\n\na store, a parlour or a studio. The number of products and services, which get home-delivered, is\n\nmind-boggling and has been growing by leaps and\n\nbounds.

The speculation\n\nbegan after Rajan joined Rahul Gandhi\n\nin his Bharat Jodo yatra, a thinly-veiled\n\npolitical exercise. Rajan has not denied\n\nthe possibility yet. But he continues to\n\nmake news by needling the Modi government. During his recent stay in\n\nIndia, the economist said he believes the\n\ncountry will be lucky, if it achieves 5 per\n\ncent growth next year.\n\nThe former governor, in the course of\n\na recorded conversation with the Congress leader, said next year is going to be\n\nmore difficult than this one. âOf course,\n\nthis one had a lot of difficulties with the\n\nwar and all that. Growth is going to slow\n\nin the world. People are raising interest\n\nrates that bring down growth.â\n\nIndiaâs interest rates have also gone\n\nup but Indian exports have been slowing quite a bit,â added Rajan. âIndiaâs\n\ninflation problem is more about commoditiesâ inflation problem, vegetablesâ\n\ninflation problem. That is also going to\n\nbe negative for the growth.â\n\nDiverse views\n\nRajanâs remarks brought forth a raft of\n\nresponses from the government and\n\nthe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. At\n\nleast one Central minister, Gajendra\n\nSingh Shekhawat, recalled that Rajan\n\nhad erred in his prediction\n\nof default in repayment of\n\nMudra scheme, which involved\n\nloans of up toÂ R10 lakh to small businesses. Indeed, the government continues to stick to its stand that India is the\n\nfastest growing economy in the world\n\nand has emerged as a strong power.\n\nâThe November export figures have\n\ncome now and are encouraging,â commented Shekhawat. âIf you look at the\n\nstatistics of the last one month, many\n\ncountries in the world are facing recession. India has done well in terms\n\nof production and exports. Exports\n\nincreased by 10.79 per centâ. He listed\n\nâsteps taken by PM Modiâ, such as Skill\n\nIndia and Start-up India, as key factors. Through improvements in ease\n\nof doing business, âan atmosphere\n\nof security and stability was created,\n\nwhich increased foreign investment.\n\nEven critics of India believe that, given\n\nthe speed with which the economy is\n\ngrowing, it is estimated that, by 2027,\n\nIndia will become the third largest\n\neconomy in the world,â he added.\n\nInflation the bugbear\n\nInterestingly while the government\n\nis bullish about the economy, the RBI\n\nis wary of what the immediate future\n\nholds. âInflation may be slightly down,\n\nbut it is certainly not out,â the RBI\n\nsaid in its latest âState of the Economyâ\n\nreport. âIf anything, it has broadened\n\nand become stubborn, especially at its\n\ncore. And an âuneaseâ hangs over energy\n\nprices.â The report cautioned that the\n\nbalance of risks is increasingly tilted\n\ntowards a darkening global outlook and\n\nemerging market economies appear to\n\nbe more vulnerable. Yet, the RBI projects a 6.9 per cent growth for the current fiscal.\n\nIn its latest India Development\n\nUpdate, the World Bankâs flagship publication says that India has demonstrated\n\nremarkable resilience despite a challenging external environment. The report\n\ntitled Navigating the Storm,Â finds that\n\nthe impact of a tightening global monetary policy cycle, slowing global growth\n\nand elevated commodity prices will\n\nmean that the economy will experience lower growth in 2022-23,\n\ncompared to 2021-22. The World\n\nBank has pegged its latest forecast on growth at 6.9 per cent.\n\nThe Bank report, however,\n\nforecasts that the economy will\n\ngrow at a rate of 6.6 per cent in\n\n2023-24. While the deteriorating external environment will weigh on Indiaâs\n\ngrowth prospects,Â the economy isÂ relatively well- positioned to weather global\n\nspill-overs, compared to most other\n\nemerging markets, it says.\n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has\n\nkept its outlook for Indiaâs economic\n\ngrowth unchanged for the ongoing fiscal year at 7 per cent. For 2023-24, the\n\nGDP growth has been kept unchanged\n\nat 7.2 per cent. Compared to Rajanâs\n\nassessment, these are heart-warming\n\nestimates.\n\nBelow potential growth\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs, the Wall\n\nStreet brokerage firm, in its India 2023\n\noutlook report says that economic\n\ngrowth in 2023 is expected to slow to\n\n5.9 per cent. âGrowth will likely be a\n\ntale of two halves, with a slower first\n\nhalf as the reopening boost fades, and\n\nmonetary tightening weighs on domestic demand. In the second half, growth\n\nis likely to re-accelerate as global growth\n\nrecovers, drag from net exports diminishes and investment cycle picks up,â\n\nGoldman Sachs said.\n\nSajid Chinoy, Chief India Economist, JP Morgan, comes close to Rajanâs\n\nassessment when he writes in The Indian\n\nExpress that the impact of the pandemic\n\nThe âknown unknownsâ\n\nGrowth expectation is to be tempered by global headwinds\n\nNational\n\nInfrastructure\n\nPipeline: a key\n\ndriver of the\n\ngovernmentâs\n\ncapex growthÂ\n\nP:23\n\nBusiness India u the magazine of the corporate world Economy\n\nu 23 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nPredictions\n\n2023\n\nRajan: next year is going to be\n\nmore difficult than this one\n\nShekhawat: export figures are\n\nencouraging\n\nand the war has meant that emerging\n\nmarkets are a sizeable 4-5 per cent below\n\ntheir pre-pandemic potential path (versus 1 per cent for the developed markets). âAnd, this is before the sharp\n\nslowing of global growth in 2023 that\n\nwe must brace for. Even in a relatively\n\nsoft-landing scenario, global growth is\n\nexpected to slow to 1.7 per cent from 3\n\nper cent this year. The implications for\n\ngrowth, jobs and livelihood in emerging markets are ominous.â\n\nSuch starkly diverse assessments\n\nmake an assessment of the state of our\n\neconomy -- and a prediction about\n\nthings to come -- difficult. It remains\n\nto be seen whether the Indian economy, which managed to duck the global\n\nheadwinds in 2022, will continue doing\n\nso in the coming year. Clearly, the economyâs growth expectations in 2023 will\n\nbe punctuated by global headwinds â\n\nmainly a demand slowdown and geopolitical overhangs, as analysts atÂ Kotak\n\nEconomic Research point out.\n\nThe recent outbreak of Covid in\n\nChina, Japan, Korea, the US and Brazil, depending how serious the new\n\nvariant is, is another factor that could\n\naffect growth.\n\nPositives for India\n\nOther economists believe that, while\n\nsignals like capacity utilisation levels, higher capital spending and deleveraged balance sheets give strong\n\nindications of a revival in the capex\n\ncycle, India cannot afford to let down\n\nthe guard. The revival of the capex cycle\n\nis one of the main factors that could\n\nshape Indiaâs growth trajectory. Of the\n\nkey indicators, capacity utilisation level\n\nhas already shown an improvement -- at\n\n75 per cent, it has hit a 17-quarter high.\n\nCapex spending by the government and\n\nlisted companies has now hit an all-time\n\nhigh on a trailing 12-month (ttm) basis\n\nand, according to analysts atÂ ICICI Securities, it will touch Rs21 lakh crore in the\n\ncoming financial year.\n\nTwo schemes -- theÂ National Infrastructure PipelineÂ (NIP) worth R111\n\nlakh crore and the PLI (productionlinked incentive) scheme worth R2 lakh\n\ncrore -- will be the key drivers of the governmentâs capex growth, according to\n\nanother report by PrabhudasÂ Lilladher.\n\nThe rural economy is now showing\n\nsigns of a revival, according to the readings of four key indicators â employment, credit offtake, auto sales and\n\ntrade. Another key driver of Indiaâs\n\neconomic growth next year will be a\n\ndemand uptick. The WB report also\n\nargues thatÂ Indiaâs economy is relatively\n\ninsulated from global spill-overs compared to other emerging markets, partly\n\nbecause India has a large domestic market and is relatively less exposed to international trade flows. The report finds\n\nthat while a 1 percentage point decline\n\nin growth in the US is associated with\n\na 0.4 percentage point decline in Indiaâs\n\ngrowth, the effect is around 1.5 times\n\nlarger for other emerging economies.\n\nAnalysis for growth spill-overs from the\n\nEU and China also yields similar results.\n\nIt cannot be denied that there are\n\nsome other solid positives going for\n\nIndia. The economyâs external position\n\nhas improved considerably over the\n\npast decade. The current-account deficit is adequately financed by improving\n\nforeign direct investment inflows and\n\na solid cushion of foreign exchange\n\nreserves (India has one of the largest\n\nholdings of international reserves in\n\nthe world). The other key factors that\n\nunderscore the resilience of the economy are robust tax collections and\n\nforex reserves crossing the $550 billion\n\nmark once again.\n\nRole of reforms\n\nPolicy reforms and regulatory measures,\n\nhowever delayed, have played a key role\n\nin developing resilience in the economy.\n\nIncreased reliance on market borrowings has improved the transparency and\n\ncredibility of fiscal policy and the government has diversified the investor base\n\nfor government securities. The introduction of a formal inflation targeting\n\nframework during the past decade was\n\nan important step in lending credibility to monetary policy decisions. While\n\nthere are still some challenges in the\n\nfinancial sector, measures like the introduction of a new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the creation of the new\n\nNational Reconstruction Co have facilitated an improvement in financial sector metrics over the past five years.\n\nThe WB report notes that both\n\nlevers of macroeconomic policy -- fiscal and monetary -- have played a role\n\nin managing the challenges that have\n\nemerged over the past year. The report\n\nnotes that the RBI withdrew accommodative monetary policy settings in a\n\nmeasured approach, as it balanced the\n\nneed to rein in inflation while continuing to support economic growth. Â Fiscal policy supported the central bankâs\n\nrate actions by cutting excise duty and\n\nother taxes on fuel to moderate the\n\nimpact of higher global oil prices on\n\ninflation. However, the report also cautions that there is a trade-off between\n\ntrying to limit the adverse impact of\n\nglobal spill-overs on growth and available policy space.\n\nSajjid Chinoy recently wrote that\n\neconomies of the world will be beset\n\nby a plethora of âknown unknownsâ\n\nand policy makers will have to engage\n\nin a high-wired balancing act. He\n\nquotes the Fed Chairman Powell that,\n\nto succeed, policy will have to be both\n\nâhumble and nimbleâ. u\n\nRak e sh J oshi\n\n[email protected]\n\nsanjay b o r a d e\n\nP:24\n\nForign Policy Business India u the magazine of the corporate world\n\nu 24 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nPredictions\n\n2023\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina has\n\ndominated Bangladeshi politics\n\nfor well over a decade now. Yet,\n\nnow her position is getting wobbly, as\n\nthe Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),\n\nthe principal Opposition party, has\n\norganised several protest rallies across\n\nthe country to capitalise on the growing\n\neconomic distress. It hopes to corner the\n\nruling Awami League government and\n\nits leader in the run-up to the general\n\nelection slated for next year. The protests were initially sparked by hikes in\n\nfuel prices and frequent, lengthy power\n\ncuts because of the fuel shortage, but\n\nhas since taken a different turn.\n\nThe BNP has now charged the Sheikh\n\nHasina-led government with violating\n\nhuman rights and gagging the media --\n\na charge which is finding traction with\n\nwestern countries and human rights\n\nbodies. It is demanding the installation\n\nof a caretaker government, as it alleges\n\nthat the Awami League dispensation\n\nis not capable of either managing the\n\neconomy or allowing fair and free elections. India, which has a lot at stake in\n\nthe stability of Bangladesh, has so far\n\nchosen to watch the situation in silence,\n\nas has China intent on establishing a\n\ngeopolitical grip on Dhaka.\n\nPolicy challenge\n\nAs elections loom large, the situation in\n\nBangladesh presents a serious foreign\n\npolicy challenge to India, which will\n\nfully unfold in 2023. What if the BNP\n\ncomes to power? Is a Sri Lanka type of\n\nmacro-economic breakdown possible?\n\nSome experts feel that the situation\n\ncalls for a calibrated behind-the-scenes\n\nintervention by India. While Bangladesh continues to post impressive GDP\n\ngrowth numbers, its economy is facing\n\npressure from several quarters, forcing it\n\nto reach out to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help. Bangladesh\n\nwill receive assistance worth $4.5 billion (about R37,000 crore) from the IMF.\n\nTo receive IMF loan assistance, Bangladesh has to comply with several conditions and introduce reforms in the\n\nfinancial sector. A decade ago, Bangladesh had received an extended credit\n\nfacility of $1 billion from the IMF in\n\nseven instalments. One of the conditions, on the contrary, was to enact Value\n\nAdded Tax (VAT). The government of\n\nBangladesh will now have to deal with\n\nseveral new conditions imposed by the\n\nIMF. This has become the subject of a\n\nlively debate. Analysts are debating how\n\nfar the IMFâs reform proposals and conditions can provide a solution to Bangladeshâs ongoing economic crisis. Some\n\nsay that the reform proposals and conditions that the IMF is imposing to overcome the current crisis will be helpful\n\nin stopping various irregularities in the\n\nfinancial sector. Others feel that several\n\nof the reform proposals\n\nmay intensify the crisis.\n\nIMF prescription\n\nWhat are the IMFâs reform proposals? On 26 October, a visiting IMF delegation held three separate meetings\n\nwith Bangladeshâs Ministry of Finance,\n\nwhere the issue of reducing the subsidies\n\ngiven by the government in various sectors came up. According to local media\n\nreports, the IMF has asked for reforms in\n\nthe management of gas, electricity and\n\nfertiliser subsidies. This reform means\n\nreducing the subsidy. The organisation\n\nhas sought a time-bound plan from the\n\ngovernment in this regard. Apart from\n\nthis, they sought to know the plans to\n\ndivest the big government companies,\n\nwhich are kept running with subsidies,\n\nto the private sector.\n\nThe visiting team also sought to\n\nknow the trends in the actual spending\n\non education and health sectors from\n\nallocations to the social security sector. Besides, the IMF has asked to know\n\nabout the governmentâs plans to release\n\nthe subsidies to loss-making stateowned enterprises in oil, electricity, fertiliser and gas sectors.\n\nâThe economy of Bangladesh is not\n\nin a position to negotiate on whatever\n\nterms the IMF sets,â assesses Mohammad Helal Uddin, professor, economics,\n\nDhaka University & director (research),\n\nCentre on Integrated Rural Development for Asia & the Pacific (CIRDAP).\n\nâSo, Bangladesh has to take a loan.â\n\nâThis bad state of the economy is\n\nbecause the debt and domestic resources\n\nwere not used properly in the past,â he\n\nDhaka on tenterhooks\n\nShould India intervene? Modi may soon have to take a decision\n\nThe principal\n\nOpposition party BNP\n\nhas organised several\n\nprotest rallies across the\n\ncountry to capitalise on\n\nthe growing economic\n\ndistress\n\nP:25\n\nBusiness India u the magazine of the corporate world Foreign Policy\n\nu 25 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nPredictions\n\n2023\n\nadds. âAbout 30 per cent more than\n\nthe actual cost has been spent in various sectors, including on development\n\nprojects.â\n\nâBangladeshâs increasing foreign\n\ndebt has not reached a critical point,â\n\ncontends Salim Raihan, also professor in\n\nDhaka University. âHowever, every year\n\nafter 2026, Bangladesh will have to pay\n\nback the IMF debt with interest. Then\n\nthere will be pressure. So, if the loan is\n\nnot used properly, there will be a crisis.â\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThe country had overtaken India in\n\nterms of per capita income in 2020, on\n\nthe back of robust economic growth for\n\nthe better part of the last two decades,\n\nespecially since 2017. In fact, unlike\n\nmany countries, including India, that\n\nsaw their GDP contract in 2020, following theÂ Covid-19Â pandemic, the\n\neconomy of Bangladesh had actually\n\ngrown during this period. Its GDP\n\ngrew by 3.4 per cent in 2020 and by\n\n6.9 per cent in 2021. So, what went\n\nwrong after that?\n\nThe war in Ukraine has been an\n\nunsettling factor. Also, inflation has\n\nspiked to uncomfortable levels, as all\n\nkinds of commodities such as crude\n\noil became costlier. The inflation rate\n\nin November was 8.85 per cent, as\n\nagainst 5.98 per cent in November\n\n2021. The current account balance\n\n(the gap between the money coming\n\ninto a country on account of earnings\n\nthrough the export of goods and services and the money going out of the\n\ncountry via the import of goods and\n\nservices) has gone deep into a deficit.\n\nBangladesh has typically been hugely\n\ndependent on its export earnings but,\n\nas the Western economies slow down\n\nand their consumers put off their\n\ndemand for a later date, the country\n\nsuffers.\n\nThe local currency, âtakaâ, has weakened partly under the pressure of the\n\nsurge in dollar and partly on account of\n\nthe worsening current account deficit.\n\nA weaker taka further aggravated the\n\ninflationary spiral, because all imports\n\nbecome costlier still. Finally, the weakness in the external front has resulted in\n\nBangladeshâs foreign exchange reserves\n\ngetting depleted to just $33,790 million\n\nlast fortnight -- a fall of more than onefourth of its total valuation compared\n\nto last year.\n\nDistressing politics\n\nEqually distressing is the political situation. Of late, Hasina has been repeatedly accused by human rights groups\n\nof high-handedness against her critics, political opponents and journalists.\n\nLaws like the 2018 Digital Security Act,\n\nwhich the UN called âdraconianâ, have\n\nhelped her quell even the minutest of\n\ndissents. Over the past two years, more\n\nthan 2,000 people have been detained\n\nunder it. Indeed, after the Dhaka protests, among those detained were two\n\nsenior Opposition leaders Mirza Fakhrul\n\nIslam Alamgir and Mirza Abbas.\n\nThe BNPâs political strategy is to\n\ncatalyse the peopleâs anger and overthrow Hasina. But even if Hasina steps\n\ndown, a free and fair election is held and\n\nBNP assumes power in the 2023 elections, this is unlikely to change the status quo of the country, because the rot\n\nlies in the economy. BNP might not be\n\nable to appease the people alienated or\n\noffer a timely solution to the financial\n\ncrisis. Some political observers believe\n\nthat, if the country surges towards a Sri\n\nLanka-like situation, it would be the last\n\nthing India needs in the region.Â\n\nFor India, there is a lot on the table\n\nright now. It has just assumed the presidency of the G20. It is keen to play a role\n\nin brokering peace in Ukraine. In the\n\ncoming year, the government will have\n\nto spend time and resources in stabilising the domestic economic situation\n\nin view of the 2024 general election.\n\nBesides, the political ruckus in Bangladesh is happening at a time when Chinaâs incursions along the Line of Actual\n\nControl (LAC) have again begun. India\n\ncannot afford to let China have an\n\nupper hand in dealing with the crisis in\n\nBangladesh. Experts feel that, given the\n\nrelationship between India and Bangladesh, India definitely can, and should,\n\nplay a role in facilitating stability in\n\nBangladesh.Â\n\nBNP on the offensive\n\nOver the years, a string of issues has kept\n\nBNP on its toes for criticising Hasinaâs\n\nsupposed growing camaraderie with\n\nModi. Defence pacts signed between\n\nIndia and Bangladesh were flagged by\n\ncritics as they believed that these MoUs\n\nundermine the independence of Bangladeshâs armed forces in choice of procurement or training and unfairly binds\n\nthem to India.\n\nAmong a string of issues that are disenchanting Bangladeshi voters -- a huge\n\nchunk of them peasants -- is the longstanding dispute on the Teesta riversharing agreement between the two\n\ncountries. Dhaka wished for an equitable\n\ndistribution of the river water with India\n\non the lines of the Ganga Water Treaty,\n\nbut nothing significant has materialised\n\nyet.Â Bangladeshis, who live along the\n\nTeesta River, have been facing enormous\n\nwoes, flooding being one of them.\n\nHasinaâs critics believe that the benefits between the two countries flow\n\nonly from Dhaka to New Delhi and\n\nnot vice-versa and that India should\n\nequally reciprocate. Bangladesh has\n\nbeen maintaining a sturdy crackdown\n\non Islamic radical groups in the country, helping New Delhi contain the violence in the eastern and north-eastern\n\nstates.Â Last month, Hasina said that she\n\nhopes Bangladesh and India would be\n\nable to resolve the Teesta water sharing\n\nand other issues through deliberation\n\nand dialogue. Perhaps, if Modi extends\n\na helping hand to Dhaka, it could help\n\nHasina assuage the anger of her citizens\n\nand defuse the unrest that can potentially land the country in disaster. u\n\nRa k e sh J oshi\n\n[email protected]\n\nHasina: her\n\nposition is getting\n\nwobbly?\n\nP:26\n\nForeign Policy Business India u the magazine of the corporate world\n\nu 26 u\n\ndecember 26, 2022-JANUARY 8, 2023\n\nPredictions\n\n2023\n\nThe latest of a series of unprovoked transgressions of the Line\n\nof Actual Control (LAC) by Chinese troops on 9 December points to\n\na continuing failure of the governmentâs foreign policy, while betraying\n\nits inability to squarely address the issue\n\nwith Beijing. The government, though,\n\nunprecedentedly yielded to an adamant\n\nOpposition, and got Defence Minister\n\nRajnath Singh to make a statement in\n\nboth the Houses of Parliament on this\n\ncrucial issue.\n\nThe minister, however, riled the\n\nOpposition parties by making but a\n\nbrief statement and refusing to take any\n\nquestions. âOn 9 December 2022, PLA\n\n(Peopleâs Liberation Army) troops tried\n\nto transgress the LAC in Yangtse area of\n\nTawang Sector (in Arunachal Pradesh)\n\nand unilaterally change the status quo,â\n\nthe minister said. âThe Chinese attempt\n\nwas contested by our troops in a firm\n\nand resolute manner. The ensuing faceoff led to a physical scuffle in which\n\nthe Indian Army bravely prevented the\n\nPLA from transgressing into our territory and compelled them to return to\n\ntheir posts. The scuffle led to injuries\n\nto a few personnel on both sides. I wish\n\nto share with this House that there are\n\nno fatalities or serious casualties on our\n\nside.â\n\nArticle 75 of the Constitution makes\n\nthe government responsible to Parliament. However, presiding officers of\n\nboth the Houses â Lok Sabha Speaker\n\nOm Birla and Rajya Sabha\n\nDeputy Chairman Harivansh\n\nâ disallowed the requests, forcing the\n\nOpposition MPs to stage walk-outs.\n\nAs fleeting as the clash at Yangtse was, soldiers on both sides were\n\nwounded, with more PLA troops estimated to have been injured than the\n\n20 on the Indian side, atÂ least six of\n\nwhom needed to be airlifted to Guwahati, Assam, for treatment. It was also\n\nthe first physical combat between the\n\ntwo sides since the deadly clash in the\n\nGalwan Valley inÂ eastern LadakhÂ in\n\nJune 2020 that took a toll of 20 Indian\n\njawans.\n\nScuffle may be part of wider design\n\nIt is possible that the PLAâs wasÂ a tactical\n\nretreat and thisÂ scuffle was part of a\n\nwider design that may unfold in the days\n\nto come.
