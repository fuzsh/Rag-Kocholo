        "text": "Her name was Charlotte Green, and she was 101 years old when she died of kidney failure at a hospital in Manhattan on Saturday afternoon, a few hours after the year 2000 began. By the ordinary measures of a life in this city of power and riches that had been her lifelong home, she was an unknown woman.\n\nShe had never married, and for 60 years had worked for a Wall Street law firm as a secretary, librarian and chief clerk, retiring 22 years ago. And if it had not been for the span of her life, which gave her a foothold in three centuries, perhaps no one would have cared enough to write about her.\n\nBut there is a history in every life, as Shakespeare noted, and a few people who loved Miss Green -- relatives, friends and colleagues -- took a few hours on the telephone yesterday to remember a tall, intelligent and graceful woman who was a perceptive witness to the 20th century of her city, from horse-and-buggy days to the building of its skyline and the rise of its great institutions.\n\nShe wanted to do everything in her beloved city, they said, and came close. She saw Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium and Enrico Caruso at the old Metropolitan Opera and had subscriptions to the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall. She rode on trolley cars, worked for $6 a week, wore ribbed stockings and recalled winters in the days before the city plowed snow from the streets.\n\nAt Lord, Day & Lord, the now-defunct, once-prestigious law firm where she worked from 1918 to 1978, she became the most indispensable nonlawyer in the house, supervising the nonlegal staff and library and keeping track of court dates and case obligations for 125 lawyers who represented such clients as the Cunard ship line, The New York Times and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nMiss Green, as everyone at the firm called her, was an original tenant of Stuyvesant Town on the Lower East Side, moving into a $65-a-month, one-bedroom apartment in 1947 and staying on until the end of her life. On her vacations, she traveled the world -- to Europe, India, South America, Africa and Asia, to China for six weeks at the age of 85 -- savoring restaurants, theaters, museums, galleries and exotic street life, just as she did in New York.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
