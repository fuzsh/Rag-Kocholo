He had overcome an opiate addiction that started with marijuana in middle school and progressed to abusing prescription pills while a student at Bethlehem Central High School.\n\nAfter completing treatment, he had lived clean and sober for more than two years and was part of a rigorous recovery community, StepUp, on the campus of Augsburg College in Minneapolis.\n\nBassinson attended Augsburg on a music scholarship for piano performance. He was a junior, a talented classical pianist and member of the college choir. He was scheduled to perform with the choir at Carnegie Hall in New York City on March 22.\n\nHe loved animals and offered to take care of a friend's cat last weekend in his dormitory room. It was March 7, a Saturday. His girlfriend came over, they ate pizza and stayed up late. She fell asleep and was awakened in the middle of the night. She found him on the floor. She couldn't wake him up. She called 911.\n\nParamedics arrived within three minutes. They worked on Bassinson for more than 30 minutes, but could not revive him. He was pronounced dead.\n\nAn autopsy revealed that Bassinson's left coronary artery was 95 percent blocked. Bassinson died from advanced, undiagnosed heart disease. There was no family history and no symptoms.\n\nHe had come through the darkness of addiction. He life had shined its brightest. And then he was gone.\n\nHis parents got a phone call at 4:30 a.m. They boarded a 9 a.m. flight for Minneapolis.\n\nThe past week has been a blur of shock and grief and making arrangements for a funeral on Saturday. It was also an opportunity to begin healing. His parents spent a few days at Augsburg and attended two memorial services held on campus. They heard students, faculty and administrators praise their son.\n\nOther students in StepUp said they confided in him when they struggled with their own sobriety. They used words like radiant and inspiring to describe Max. They said he was a good listener who had a gift for reassuring them and making them feel better about themselves. He volunteered to serve as a sponsor to several people in the Minneapolis community in 12-step recovery programs. They came to the campus services to thank him.\n\n\"People told wonderful stories about Max for more than an hour,\" his father, Scott Bassinson, said. \"It was a wonderful, supportive community for him. He felt great about himself. It was the happiest time of his life. He had found love. He had become a giving, generous person in service of others. We're so grateful that he had found such happiness and love.\"\n\nA lot of pain and darkness had come before that. He started smoking pot at 14 because it helped him relax and cope with social anxiety. It made him \"feel normal,\" he told his parents. He moved on to opiates, including oxycodone and hydrocodone. He never tried heroin, although its use exploded among young adults in the Capital Region in the past two years after the supply of prescription opiate pills tightened.\n\n\"He left the market before pills dried up,\" his father said.\n\nIn December 2011, their 20-year-old son was stopped by State Police, who arrested him for driving impaired by drugs. The troopers drove him to his parents' house.\n\n\"Your son really needs help,\" one of the troopers told his father.\n\nThey had seen signs -- a string of lies, items missing from their house, marijuana seeds and empty pill capsules in his bedroom -- but they did not act on their initial concerns.\n\n\"We were in denial,\" the father said. \"Max was so smart and talented that we didn't see a downward trajectory. He graduated with a 91 average and got admitted to Northeastern.\"\n\nBy the time he dropped out of Northeastern his sophomore year, his addiction had spiraled out of control. The State Police arrest was a wake-up call to his parents. They immediately got him into the detox unit at St. Peter's Hospital and had him transferred directly to Hazelden's addiction treatment program for young adults outside Minneapolis. He quit treatment and relapsed and spent six months at Gray Wolf Ranch in Port Townsend, Wash. and returned to Hazelden before his recovery stuck.\n\n\"We were extremely fortunate,\" the father said. He's a lawyer whose law firm's insurance covered the high cost of treatment. He's now a hearings counsel and administrative law judge with the state Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\nHis wife, Meg, is a piano instructor. Both parents are accomplished pianists. Their son, Paul, 27, works for the Siena Research Institute.\n\n\"It's been really hard on Paul,\" his father said. \"We're all up and down.\"\n\nOthers had seen the change that addiction caused in Bassinson, including Tom Fris, a longtime Bassinson family friend and Bethlehem High School math teacher who taught Max in a pre-calculus course.\n\n\"I saw his brightness and positivity was starting to fade and there was a harder edge to him his senior year, but I didn't think he was that far gone,\" Fris said. \"But he came out clean and he was very proud of his sobriety. I saw him at Christmas and he shined like the sun. I'd never seen him looking so good. He was absolutely blossoming at Augsburg.\"\n\nFris said the outpouring of love from Augsburg students on social media helped him with his own sadness. \"It's tragic on so many levels,\" he said.\n\nAs part of his treatment program, Bassinson had taken pains to make things right with his parents and others he had hurt through his drug abuse. He had abandoned the lies, deceit and heavy baggage of addiction.\n\nHe felt free and unburdened for the first time in many years and reclaimed the best version of himself. He told his parents: \"I choose life.\"\n\nAt his college recital last month, he performed Maurice Ravel's composition for solo piano, \"Jeux d'eau,\" or Water Games. It evokes the sound and feel of flowing water, with life's unpredictable currents.\n\nHis parents have established a music scholarship in their son's name at Augsburg College. His girlfriend and several friends from Augsburg will attend his funeral Saturday at 11 a.m. at St. Vincent de Paul Church, 900 Madison Ave., Albany. The music at the funeral will including a recording of their son's performance of \"Jeux d'eau\" from the Feb. 16 recital.\n\nIt was the best he had ever played the Ravel piece. It was described as radiant and inspiring.\n\npgrondahl@timesunion.com - 518-454-5623 - @PaulGrondahl\n\nBeer, Brent -- [Published Thursday, October 2, 2014 in the Wisconsin State Journal, WI]\n\nPORTAGE - Brent Beer, age 80, of Portage, Wis., and Tucson, Ariz., died on Friday, Sept. 26, 2014.

He was 60.\n\nFordham's wife, Joan, said he died of an asbestos-related cancer that might have come from a time when he worked as a college student in construction in the 1960s or from the work he did at the ammunition plant.\n\nFordham went to the plant in 1971 as an engineer, she said. In 1976, he became a representative of the plant commander.\n\nIn that role, Fordham oversaw modernization, making the plant ready to produce more ammunition at any moment. But soon after he got there, the plant stopped producing ammunition.\n\nSince then, Fordham spent a lot of time working on environmental cleanup at the plant, his wife said. Production during World War II created many of the environmental problems, she said.\n\nThe vision to start prairie restoration at the plant was his, Joan Fordham said. He had already made some plantings at the plant in the 1980s.\n\nFordham retired in November.\n\nLate last year, after sometimes controversial discussions, federal, state and tribal governments assumed ownership of the land, after agreeing to use it for recreation and conservation purposes.\n\nFordham was an avid biker, hiker and spent a lot of time canoeing and raising the couple's three children.\n\n\"(The children) were put into the world of camping whether they wanted to do it or not,\" Joan Fordham said. \"That's what we did since they were little.\"\n\nShe said her husband also played guitar and was involved in church.\n\n\"There were just a lot of sides of him that I think people didn't know.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, three children and two grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at the First United Methodist Church in Baraboo.\n\nFrench, James Frazier Jr. -- [Published 9/6/2001 in the Times Union, Albany, NY]\n\nCOLONIE -- James F.

We played 'Sunny Side of the Street' and 'Every Time It Rains,' and of course his little schtick, 'Thanks for the Memories,\" Hayes said. \"The second time I played for him, in Tampa, he remembered me and he said, 'Didn't you just play for me on Cape Cod?' And I said,'yes'. And he said, 'Then you know my stuff. Don't bother me - go home and come back for showtime.' So that's what I did. And, you know, he still paid me for the rehearsal and we had a great time up there. I'll never forget it.\"\n\n\"To this day I have thousands of songs in my head. I may not remember your name but I'll remember your favorite song. For me, I chose the right career. I'm not bragging but I had the talent and I recognized it in myself and I went for it. And that's what being driven, and going after life is all about.\"\n\nBob was predeceased by his wife of 59 years, Lacy (McCord) Hayes, and a son, Robert C.
