There are six new productions this season—the Met premiere of Jeanine Tesori’s Grounded, starring Emily D’Angelo and directed by Michael Mayer, opens the season on September 23; Osvaldo Golijov’s Ainadamar, starring Angel Blue and Daniela Mack, in a staging by Deborah Colker in her Met debut; Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick, starring Brandon Jovanovich and Peter Mattei, in a staging by Leonard Foglia in his Met debut; John Adams’s Antony and Cleopatra, starring Julia Bullock and Gerald Finley, in a staging by Elkhanah Pulitzer in her Met debut; and Strauss’s Salome, starring Elza van den Heever and Peter Mattei, in a staging by Claus Guth in his Met debut. The pandemic-delayed premiere of a new production of Verdi’s Aida, directed by Michael Mayer, is scheduled for the annual New Year’s Eve Gala. Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Met’s Jeanette Lerman-Neubauer Music Director, conducts Grounded, Salome, and Aida. John Adams conducts his own score of Antony and Cleopatra.\n\nA full slate of revivals returns to the Met stage, including works by Verdi, Offenbach, Rossini, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini, as well as Strauss’s rarely performed Die Frau ohne Schatten, conducted by Nézet-Séguin, and Beethoven’s Fidelio, starring Lise Davidsen. In addition, a special gala performance of Puccini’s Tosca on November 12 commemorates the centenary of the composer’s death and marks Davidsen’s Met role debut as the title character.\n\n“At the Met, we’re committed to opera’s evolution as an art form, honoring the classics with revivals and new productions while presenting new works that relate to the times in which we live,” said Peter Gelb, the Met’s Maria Manetti Shrem General Manager. “We owe it our audiences, both old and new.”\n\nMaestro Nézet-Séguin added, “I find it so important to open the new season conducting an intensely dramatic Met commission like Jeanine Tesori’s Grounded, which addresses real issues in our world today, and follow that up with great operatic jewels like Salome, Aida, Die Frau ohne Schatten, and La Bohème. This is truly modern—to pay tribute to the essential works of the past while paving the way for an operatic future.”\n\nThe season opens with the Met premiere of two-time Tony Award–winning composer Jeanine Tesori’s Grounded, an opera commissioned by the Met and based on librettist George Brant’s acclaimed play. Mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo stars as Jess, a hot-shot fighter pilot whose pregnancy takes her out of the cockpit and lands her in Las Vegas, operating Reaper drones. Maestro Nézet-Séguin conducts a cast that also features tenor Ben Bliss as Eric—a Wyoming rancher who becomes Jess’s husband.\n\nArgentinian composer Osvaldo Golijov’s Grammy Award–winning Ainadamar premieres at the Met on October 15. The opera dramatizes the life and murder of poet-playwright Federico García Lorca, who was assassinated for his socialist politics and sexual orientation. Brazilian director and choreographer Deborah Colker, a Laurence Olivier Award winner, makes her Met debut with this new production. Mezzo-soprano Daniela Mack sings the trouser role of Federico García Lorca. Sopranos\n\nAngel Blue and Gabriella Reyes share the role of Lorca’s muse, the actress Margarita Xirgu; soprano Elena Villalón plays Nuria; and flamenco singer Alfredo Tejada—in his Met debut—completes the principal cast as the Falangist politician Ramón Ruiz Alonso. In his Met debut, Miguel Harth-Bedoya conducts a score that crackles with the energy and rhythms of flamenco and rumba.\n\nFor the annual New Year’s Eve gala premiere, Maestro Nézet-Séguin again takes the podium to lead acclaimed director Michael Mayer’s opulent new production of Aida. Soprano Angel Blue makes her Met role debut as the title Ethiopian princess. The cast also features mezzo-soprano Judit Kutasi as Amneris, tenor Piotr Beczała as Radamès, baritone Quinn Kelsey as Amonasro, bass Dmitry Belosselskiy as Ramfis, and bass Morris Robinson as the King.

Christina Nilsson, in her Met debut, is scheduled to sing the title role in March, and Alexander Soddy shares conducting duties. Maestro John Keenan conducts the final performance in the spring.\n\nThe second half of the season opens on March 3 with the Met premiere of Jake Heggie’s 2010 adaptation of Herman Melville’s epic Moby-Dick. A cast of standouts comes together on the decks of the Pequod, led by Maestro Karen Kamensek, with tenor Brandon Jovanovich starring as Captain Ahab, tenor Stephen Costello as Greenhorn, baritone Peter Mattei as Starbuck, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green as Queequeg. The cast also includes soprano Janai Brugger as Pip, tenor William Burden as Flask, and baritone Malcolm MacKenzie as Stub. Director Leonard Foglia, in his Met debut, expands his earlier production for the Met.\n\nIn its first new production at the company in 20 years, Strauss’s Salome returns on April 29 in a new staging by director Claus Guth, in his company debut.

The cast also includes mezzo-soprano Taylor Raven as Charmian, in her Met debut; tenor Brenton Ryan as Eros; and bass-baritone Alfred Walker as Enobarbus.

Mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo stars as Jess, a hot-shot fighter pilot whose unplanned pregnancy takes her out of the cockpit and lands her in Las Vegas, operating a Reaper drone halfway around the world. Confronted by the challenges of this new way of doing battle, she must fight to hold on to her sanity—and her soul. Met Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin oversees the Met premiere of Tesori’s score and a cast that also features tenor Ben Bliss as Eric, the Wyoming rancher who becomes Jess’s husband.

Lorca himself makes a dreamlike appearance, sung as a trouser role by mezzo-soprano Daniela Mack. Flamenco singer Alfredo Tejada completes the principal cast as the Falangist politician Ramón Ruiz Alonso, who arranged Lorca’s execution. Combining features of both an opera and a passion, Ainadamar, conducted by Miguel Harth-Bedoya in his Met debut, crackles with the energy and rhythms of flamenco and rumba, as well as the violent backdrop of civil war, all of which springs forth on the Met stage in a vivid company-debut production by Deborah Colker, renowned for her work with Cirque du Soleil.\n\nMusic by Osvaldo Golijov\n\nLibretto by David Henry Hwang\n\nA co-production of the Metropolitan Opera, Opera Ventures, Scottish Opera,\n\nDetroit Opera, and Welsh National Opera\n\nProduction a gift of the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Endowment Fund, and the Edgar Foster Daniels Foundation, in memory of Richard Gaddes\n\nAinadamar is part of the Neubauer Family Foundation New Works Initiative\n\nAida—Giuseppe Verdi NEW PRODUCTION\n\nOpening: December 31, 2024\n\nConductor: Yannick Nézet-Séguin / Alexander Soddy / John Keenan\n\nProduction: Michael Mayer\n\nSet Designer: Christine Jones\n\nCostume Designer: Susan Hilferty\n\nLighting Designer: Kevin Adams\n\nProjection Designer: 59 Productions\n\nChoreographer: Oleg Glushkov*\n\n*Debut\n\nLive in HD: January 25, 2025\n\nSoprano Angel Blue makes her long-awaited Met role debut as the title Ethiopian princess, one of opera’s defining roles.
