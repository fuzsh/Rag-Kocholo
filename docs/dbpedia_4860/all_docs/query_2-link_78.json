Quinn, 77, of Jamestown, RI died peacefully with family by his side in his winter home in Vero Beach, Florida after a long and brave battle with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Henry was an accomplished and popular educator, having influenced hundreds of lives during his career as an English teacher and vice principal at North Kingstown High School. Henry was born in West Warwick, RI on February 20, 1929, the youngest of six children, to the late Arcelia (Demers) Quinn and Charles C. Quinn. His sisters Eileen (Talbot), Barbara (Phillips), Virginia (Finnerty), Nancy (Michels) and brother, Charles, pre-deceased him. He was the grandson of the late Col. Patrick Henry Quinn, and the nephew of the late Maisie E. Quinn and the former Governor of Rhode Island, the late Judge Robert E. Quinn-individuals who significantly influenced him throughout his life. He was a devoted son, husband, father, grandfather and friend. Henry is survived by his closest friend and constant companion, his wife of nearly 30 years, Alicia (Parente) Quinn; and by his loving children Maureen Elizabeth Quinn of Jamestown, RI, Peter Quinn of Wickford, RI, Martha Huston of Glocester, RI, and Susan Quinn Romano and Marisa Quinn, both of Jamestown. He will be remembered by his six grandchildren Holly and Wyatt Huston, Alex, Amanda, and Jack Romano, and Emmet Noonan for his enormous presence and extraordinary generosity. He was the husband of the late Maureen Gilligan Quinn, and father to the late Margaret \"Kelli\" Quinn. Henry was an avid golfer. After retiring from North Kingstown High School in 1984, Henry worked at the Exeter Country Club, where he served for 20 years, golfing as much as possible when he wasn't working in the Pro Shop. Henry played bocce, and was part of the \"Shamrock League,\" which was composed of some of his closest friends, including David Reidy. An ardent reader, Henry was often seen sitting in the sun outside his home with a book in hand. He enjoyed the theater-particularly Trinity Repertory Theater-fine dining and cocktail hour. He loved long walks in Jamestown, and will be remembered by those in the community whom he knew since moving to the Island in 1968 for his walks through town, responding to passersby with an enthusiastic wave and his characteristically infectious smile. Henry graduated from West Warwick High School and enlisted with the U.S. Army as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. Through the G.I. Bill, he attended Providence College, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. He later received a principal's certificate from the University of New Hampshire. During the Korean War he was with 101st Airborne, and was stationed in Panama. He once remarked that his greatest accomplishment was raising his family of six children. \"We have enjoyed a beautiful home and good health,\" he explained. Henry will be cremated, with a private ceremony to be scheduled later this season. Per his wishes and instructions, there will be a celebration of his life at his favorite location, the Exeter Country Club, once the weather warms up. Friends and relatives will be notified.
