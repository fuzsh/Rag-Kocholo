He was united in marriage to Mary L. Litsey Jan 2, 1862 and to this union were born five children: Margaret E who died in infancy; Effie E. Moore of Kingman, Ind; Delia, LA and EH Bacus all of Howard and vicinity. These with 29 grandchildren and four great grandchildren are left to mourn his death. He was a soldier of Co A 85th Regiment, Indiana Volunteer Infantry, being honorably discharge from the service May 20, 1865. Brother Bacus was initiated into the mysteries of the Masonic Order in July 1858 and for almost 61 years has been a loyal member of his chosen order. He also united with the ME Church in Howard in 1894 and retained his interest in the church and its tasks throughout the years. For 37 years Brother Bacus has lived in this community, highly respected by his friends and beloved by his family. A good man hath fallen, one by one the veterans of the conflict of the sixties are passing away. They are a great host yonder, and the deeds they did are written in the very warp and woof of our nations life. Uncle John, as we loved to call him has had as it seems his share and more of the afflictions of life, having suffered a stroke of paralysis over three years ago but he did not complain. The funeral services were conducted from the ME Church Monday, June 9th at 2 oclock PM and interment was made in beautiful Grace Lawn.

Burial at the Vincent cemetery, two miles north of Perth, this afternoon.  The Brazil County Enterprise 18 Aug 1892 Page 3\n\nBAIN\n\nCommissioner Joe Bain, whose illness has often been mentioned in this paper, died Saturday. The funeral services were held at 1 o'clock Monday afternoon at Memorial Presbyterian church. The body was escorted from the home by the Modern Woodmen. County officials as follows were pall bearers: Henry Grubb, James H. Kerr, Thomas Gerard, D. J.. Chapin, Thomas Aydelotte, C. D. Renick and Ewing Chapman. A number of beautiful floral offerings covered the casket. Music was furnished by a quartet from the Presbyterian choir. The funeral services were conducted by Dr. H. L. Nave, pastor, assisted by Rev. F. W. Hixson. Dr. Nave embodied a sketch of Mr. Bain's life in his discourse as follows: Joseph Bain was born Nov 2, 1852; died Jan 30, 1904, age 51 years, 2 month, 28 days. He was born of Christian parents and consecrated to God in baptism at an early age by Rev. John Dixon, pastor of the Associate Presbyterian or Seceder church, near Portland Mills, this county. His religious training was very careful and thoro (sic) - family worship evening and morning, committing Psalms and catechism and strictest Sabbath observance. He was a thoro (sic) believer in the doctrines of that church. Telling me how much he appreciated the faithfulness of his parents he said: \"You know how hard it is to forget early training.\" He believed in the word of God and in prayer; was pleased when told that his sons had joined this church. He told his brother he was glad he had always encouraged his children to attend Sunday school and church. He never publicly confessed his Savior and united with any church. I am sure if, with his clearer knowledge since his spirit left the body, he could open his mute lips he would say to all who loved him: \"You could serve the Master better by joining His church on earth with its worship of God and communion of saints.\" Mr. Bain was married first to Melissa Burnside, Nov 28, 1877 who died Nov. 21, 1878. He was married to Mary K. Lanning Sept. 25, 1884, who is left to mourn for him. One of the children died in infancy. Roy, Thomas, Murl, Frost, Eliza and Catharine will help their mother keep the memory of this kind father precious. Frequently he told friends when he knew he could not possibly live that he did not fear death. He only wished to live long enough to see his boys started in life, helping them by his own experience to avoid mistakes he had made. The eldest son will ever remember and try to carry out his father's dying counsel so earnestly given just before he became unconscious. No wonder with such godly ancestry and thoro moral and religious training, Mr. Bain was an intelligent, honest man and citizen. He was a man of sunny disposition yet of strong convictions; a zealous worker in politics. Twice he was honored by election to the office of county commissioner. He conscientiously tried to do his whole duty. His faithfulness is shown in his struggle against weakness in order to be inducted into office and sit with the board at its last session. An honest man is the noblest work of God. A farmer until he became of age and then a buyer and seller of stock, his manner of life is known to you all. As a stranger, in our only talk together he impressed me as a thoughtful, earnest, faithful, true man. He feared and loved his God and tried to treat his neighbor as himself. Dr. Nave then read and commented upon the 23rd Psalm in a most beautiful and impressive manner, closing with prayer. The casket was opened and the large number of friends present took a last look at the placid features of Mr. Bain who lay as if asleep. The Woodmen escorted the body to the Rockville cemetery where the service for the dead they laid the deceased brother in his grave. Mr. Bain had a $2,000 insurance policy in the Woodmen order. - Newspaper unknown, but it is assumed it is a Rockville paper, February 1904\n\nFuneral Card -- In Memory of Ida Bain -- born: Feb 26, 1877 -- date of death: Sept 30, 1969 -- services from: Butler Funeral Home, Rockville, IN Friday, Oct 3, 1969 - 2:00 p.m. Clergyman: Rev.

Baldwin, was born in Lenox county, N.Y., Jan. 2, 1840. In her younger days she was an invalid, caused by curvature of the spine, and could never mingle freely in social gaieties around her. After the death of her parents she lived with her only brother until she came to Indiana 39 years ago last October to make her home with her sister, Mrs. Frances Hanna. She never married, but she was a second mother to two nieces, in whose lives she yet lives, and both of whom owe much of the gentler influences of their lives to the quiet examples and kindly teachings of her life. The one is Mrs. Gertrude Baldwin St. John, of Hartford, Connecticut, and the other, Mrs. Sara Hanna Vail, at whose home she died. Of two brothers and three sisters only one, Mrs. Julia Higgins, of Howard, N.Y., survives. Her life was quiet and unassuming. Never strong, she husbanded her strength for the business of life, and found her greatest pleasure in service to others. Her circle of acquaintances was small, but to know her was to become her friend, and for these chosen few no service was too heavy or sacrifice too great. She united with the Presbyterian church in early childhood, and, though never active in church work, was always an ardent Christian. Four years ago this month she was stricken with a return of the spinal trouble of her youth, and since then she has been an invalid. A year ago last February she became worse, and since then she has been confined to her room. For the last three months she has been entirely helpless. During all these years there has never been a complaint. It has been a quiet time of waiting--unassuming, like her whole life--never demanding much, always willing to abide by the Master's will, until He should call her home. The end came peacefully at 12:15 Thursday morning, May 25, when without a struggle and with scarcely a sigh, she fell asleep in the arms of Jesus. - Waveland Independent-June 9, 1916\n\nMrs. Ella Baldwin, age 81, died suddenly at her home here [Marshall] Thursday morning.

Rosco was a remarkably kind and loving child, too lovely and fair to live and blossom in this world of sin and care, so the kind Father in heaven transplanted him to bloom forever in the paradise of God. When we think of the pleasant home into which his life had fallen, that he never lacked for what money could buy or love bestow and surrounded by so many influences of right to prepare him for future usefulness, and as we think of the mysteries of Providence in taking away this sweet young life, we are made to say, We look thru a glass darkly. But we know that our darling, whose smile was like sunshine in our home, is now rejoicing with the angels around the great white throne. Never again, will his sparkling eyes beam forth with joy at the family circle. Never again will he greet his little playmates, whom he loved so well, and join them in their innocent games. Oh! How he will be missed by his teacher and schoolmates. When at Sunday school he would often ask his teacher about Jesus and the angels and would say he was going to be a good boy so that he could go to heaven when he died. It can truly be said of Rosco that he loved everyone whom he knew and we may add that everyone loved him in return. While his parents and kindred miss him as only parents and kindred can they have the consolation, that their early loss is his eternal gain. He passed away calmly and peacefully as if falling asleep. He leaves to mourn his loss father and mother, two sisters and a host of relatives and friends. I cannot say, I will not say, That he is dead. He is just away, With a cherry smile and a wave of the hand, He has wandered into a beautiful land And left us dreaming how very fair It needs must be, since he lingers there. Think of him still as the same, I say, He is not dead; he is just away. Funeral services were conducted at the family residence, Thursday afternoon, by Rev. Silas Adams. The remains were laid to rest in the Adams cemetery to await its seond calling in Christ.

For seven years, ten months and twenty-two days the gentle child lived a beautiful life fraught with the lessons of love and unselfishness that lead to the gate Beautiful and her mission being fulfilled on earth, the pure, white soul winged its flight back to Him who gave it on Oct 26, 1918. Those of the immediate family circle left to mourn her going away are the parents, a twin sister, Margaret and the grandparents, M/M CE Benson and M/M BF Brown. The lives of the little twin sisters were deeply intertwined with love and devotion each for the other. They had never been separated, each shared every childish joy and sorrow; all play, every thought and deed was one with them -- their mutual devotion was remarkable. Little Marjorie, though frail in body possessed a sweet, sunny disposition and shy loving way s that endeared her to all who knew her. She had a bright mind and excelled in her school work. At school, she was an especial favorite of her schoolmates and greatly loved by her teacher. Her last illness, due to the dread influenza, was brief but severe. At intervals she was irrational but again her own dear self patient and sweet and kind. The devoted parents did everything possible to relieve the little sufferer and now she is with them no more, they have the blesses consolation of that memory. On the morning of her last day the little girl rallied, played some with the little sister asked for her books and did some drawing in which she was talented, but she soon grew worse. As another change came the tiny hands uplifted pleadingly and begged, \"Oh, let me go, i want to go up higher,\" and who can say that these small earth angels are not given a foresight of eternal visions of the beauty of Heaven? The life-tide slowly ebbed until the evening shadows were falling when little Marjorie went to sleep in the arms of Jesus, the tender Shepherd of God's children. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. Private Funeral service were held at the family residence Mon. aft at 2:30 o'clock the Rev. Smith of Rosedale ME Church officiating. John R.

R. Bloomer and Squire F. M. Bryant rushed to the cabin of Perry Bishop in Wabash Township Thursday night when notified by neighbors that Mr. Bishop who was past 76 years of age had been found in the dooryard by his son, William. It seems that old man and his son, William, who is about 50 years old, kept batch in a cabin on the farm of Samuel McCune about a mile East of Armiesburg, the father working at odd jobs for farmers of the neighborhood. The son being employed at the Indiana Sewer Pipe works in Mecca. The son had worked at the plant during the day quitting about 4 p.m. and after purchasing a few groceries went home and claimed that as he entered the yard, he found the body of his father lying in a pool of blood about 40 or 50 feet from the house, a gunshot wound in his head. The son threw a cover over the body and ran to the house of Mr. McCune, crying that his father had shot himself. Mr. McCune and France McCalment accompanied by the son, hurried to the cabin and were surprised to find the old man alive, he having crawled several feet from where the son first claimed to have found him. Peculiar and suspicious things were found that will lead officers to make an investigation. While the son claims that the father shot himself, he avers that he did not see the act committed and there were no powder burns on the face, although an old single barrel muzzle-loading shot gun was found by his side. Deputy Sheriff Marlar found a locust club about 3 feet long and claimed by the son to have been used as a poker at the fireplace. On this club there were splotches of blood, although there was no blood on the ground near where the stick was picked up. It is alleged that scratches were visible on William Bishop's face the night the old man was found. Mr. Bishop never regained consciousness and Saturday evening around 5 p.m. he was taken to the county Asylum, dying 2 hours later.

McCune and France McCalment went at once with the son and when they reached the scene, the old man had crawled to the northeast corner of the building. The son, a man about forty years old, and McCalment carried the wounded man into the house and placed him in bed. When the Sheriff and his party reached Newton's they supposed the man was dead. The Sheriff and McCune left for the scene in a buggy and\n\nthe others walked down the track. When Sheriff Thompson entered the house, he still supposed the man to be dead, until he saw the bed clothes moving. He drew them back and a horrible sight met his eyes; the wounded man, literally covered with blood, was groaning and struggling, more like a wounded suffering animal than a human being. Dr. Bloomer dressed his wounds and he was taken to the poor farm, where he died Saturday evening about eight o'clock, without regaining consciousness. Sunday the body was removed to the home of his daughter, Mrs. William Straughn, south of Rockville, where funeral services were held Monday afternoon, with burial at Arabia cemetery. An autopsy was held on the body at Teague and Chapman's undertaking rooms, by Dr. Bloomer, assisted by Drs. J. J. Connelly and J.F. Swayne of Mecca. They found that at least forty shot had entered the left side of the man's face and head and that there was evidence of a wound on the side of his head that must have been caused by a blunt instrument. The Coroner is of the opinion that the man's death was not caused by suicide. A large wooden poker, covered with blood was found about fifteen feet away from where the man was found, and the gun was lying a little distance away. Sunday night, Prosecutor Dowd and Deputy Sheriff Marlar went to the Bishop home and procured the gun. The case is being investigated thoroughly.\n\nSuicide or Murder? --Sheriff Thompson was called to Wabash township, Thursday night, by telephone message stating that Perry Bishop had been found dead in the yard surrounding the cabin in which he lived on the farm of Samuel McCune, east of Armiesburg. The sheriff, accompanied by Deputy Marlar, Coroner Bloomer and Justice Frank Bryant went to the place but found Bishop still alive. He had been shot in the head and face with a shot gun. He was unconscious and died Saturday evening at the poor asylum, where he was taken, without regaining consciousness. An autopsy, held at Teague and Chapman's undertaking rooms, revealed the fact that death was due to a blow on the head with some blunt instrument or a club. Not far from the body a stick that had been used as a poker was found, and it is presumed he was struck by this in addition to being shot. The gun was lying by his side when found and the supposition at first was that he had killed himself. However, the direction of the shot in his head and other suspicious circumstances point to murder. The officials are still investigating. Coroner Bloomer had not filed his report this morning. Bishop was about 76 years old. He is survived by two sons, William and Tip, and one daughter, Mrs. Wm. Straughn, living south of Rockville where the body was taken after the autopsy. Burial in the Arabia cemetery at 10 o'clock Monday morning.
