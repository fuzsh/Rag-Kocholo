Culture alternatively is called the solution to the problem of double contingency (Parsons) and removed from this solution (Luhmann). It is shown that meaning is the more basic term whose description reveals a form rule of social systems which is only patterned, yet not understood by culture. Culture is a memory and control device of society. It may be conceived of as providing the distinction of correct versus incorrect behaviour. But who decides on the correctness or incorrectness of this distinction? Sociological thinking takes off where the cultural and the social are distinguished\n\nThe Interpretation of Cultures.\n\nGeertz, Clifford,\n\nOrganisation als System.\n\nWilts, A.

Through his many books he developed a highly original form of systems theory that has been hugely influential in a wide variety of disciplines. In Introduction to Systems Theory, Luhmann explains the key ideas of general and sociological systems theory and supplies a wealth of examples to illustrate his approach. The book offers a wide range of concepts and theorems that can be applied to politics and the economy, religion and science, art and education, organization and the family. Moreover, Luhmann’s ideas address important contemporary issues in such diverse fields as cognitive science, ecology, and the study of social movements. This book provides all the necessary resources for readers to work through the foundations of systems theory–no other work by Luhmann is as clear and accessible as this. There is also much here that will be of great interest to more advanced scholars and practitioners in sociology and the social sciences.\n\nNiklas Luhmann (1927 – 1998)\n\npor Dirk Baecker\n\nDirk Baecker, Universidad de Witten/Herdecke, Alemania\n\nFuente: http://www.isss.org/lumluhmann.htm.\n\nhttps://www.infoamerica.org/teoria_articulos/luhmann01.htm\n\nShape of things to come: From the ‘laws of form’ to management in the post-growth economy\n\nOrganizing for the post-growth economy\n\nAndré Reichel\n\nhttps://ephemerajournal.org/contribution/shape-things-come-%25E2%2580%2598laws-form%25E2%2580%2599-management-post-growth-economy\n\nNIKLAS LUHMANN’S THEORY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND JOURNALISM RESEARCH,\n\nAlexander Görke & Armin Scholl (2006)\n\nJournalism Studies, 7:4, 644-655, DOI: 10.1080/14616700600758066\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14616700600758066\n\nLenin’s Void : Towards a Kenogrammar of Management.\n\nBaecker, Dirk (2013).\n\n[S.l.] : SSRN.\n\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=2200779.\n\nProblems of Form\n\nby Dirk Baecker\n\nEDITED BY DIRK BAECKER\n\nTRANSLATED BY MICHAEL IRMSCHER, WITH LEAH EDWARDS\n\nStanford University Press 1999\n\nhttps://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=1485\n\nA Calculus for Autopoiesis\n\nBaecker, Dirk,\n\n(June 1, 2012).\n\nin: Dirk Baecker und Birger P.

An interest in complexity, for Heinz von Foerster, means that books get longer and longer, whereas an interest in recursivity could mean to help sociology to help people get out of perhaps pathological eigen-values of their behavior. That would open venues for a different kind of social therapy in conflicts, for instance. Luhmann answered that an understanding of social systems evidently consisting of recursive processes cannot do without the question of what distinctions enable those systems to reduce and enhance the complexity of their environment in the first place. The presentation proposes to switch to a mathematical understanding of complexity as the pairing of variables, which are as related as irreducible to each other (Diophantus). We are looking for a kind of a calculus that describes the co-evolution of complexity in brain, mind, and culture as the result and precondition of their recursive reproduction. And we propose to add the systems references of the mental and the social to the current interest in cognitive sciences in the systems references of the brain and the machine in order to be able to understand the recursive complexity of the cognitive phenomena we are currently dealing with.\n\nSelf-Reference and (Non-)Trivialization. The Social Impact of Cybernetic Concepts\n\nDirk Baecker (Friedrichshafen), Wolfgang Coy (Berlin), Jan Müggenburg (Lüneburg),\n\nClaus Pias (Lüneburg)\n\nHeinz von Foerster Congress\n\nUniversity of Vienna 2011\n\nhttps://hvfoerster.univie.ac.at/congress/abstract/baecker_dirk.html\n\nCybernetic Research in the 1960s faced a dilemma: On the one hand there was a growing awareness that the human being shares specific organizational principles with other biological and even technological systems and that the boundaries between them had started to blur. On the other hand cyberneticians such as Heinz von Foerster and the members of his Biological Computer Laboratory worried about a future society in which automated technologies could threaten individual liberty and constrain human creativity. As von Foerster famously put it: »If we don‘t act ourselves, we shall be acted upon«. Cybernetic Concepts of ›self-organziation‹ and ›non-trivial machines‹ can thus be read as a strategy to retain the humanistic idea of an autonomous subject within cybernetic research and theory. The Panel wants to discuss the original cybernetic concepts of ›self-organization‹ and ›non-trivialization‹ and examine their impact on other theories and debates outside the cybernetic core group during the 1960s and beyond.\n\nObservers Amongst Themselves / Beobachter unter sich\n\nA Theory of Culture\n\nDirk Baecker\n\nhttps://www.suhrkamp.de/rights/book/dirk-baecker-observers-amongst-themselves-fr-9783518585900\n\nThe philosophers of German Idealism – Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel – each developed concepts that may be regarded as prolegomena to a theory of the observer. These culminated, especially in the case of Fichte, in the notion of the self as empty and therefore in need of an external world.\n\nIn this world, theoretical knowledge and practical action are never in perfect alignment, which means that the very process of observation and the observer himself can only be conceived in terms of difference and complexity. This is fortunate for cultural theory, which depends precisely on placing the observer in relation not only to other observers but also that which he observes.\n\nDrawing on George Spencer-Brown’s formal calculus, Dirk Baecker shows that this provides a solid basis for the formulation of a theory of the observer. Building upon an original re-reading of the history of philosophy and theory, Baecker argues that it is possible to understand culture as the recognition of the position of an observer from the perspective of that position’s contingency. This book is nothing less than an impressive, formal foundation for a sociological theory of culture.\n\nSchlüsselwerke der Systemtheorie\n\n(key Works in System Theory)\n\nEditors\n\nDirk Baecker\n\n4th ed., Springer VS, 2021,\n\nDOI\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-33415-4\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-658-33415-4\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-3-658-33415-4/1?pdf=chapter%20toc\n\nThe Form of the Firm.\n\nSource: Organization .

It presents five suggestions, and one problem, on which the theory of the firm may be based. These are history, business, culture, management, systems references and context respectively. It goes on to introduce George Spencer Brown’s notion of form as an appropriate device with which to handle the problem. Niklas Luhmann’s theory of social systems is considered to be an important step in developing a theory of differentiation that combines closure with structure, or self-referentiality with coupling, in showing how dependent communication emerges from independent contingency. The model then focuses on the idea of a contingent co-variation of the variables product, technology, organization, economy, society and individuals. It is developed with respect to five levels of re-entry: work, business, corporate culture, communication and philosophy. The idea of the paper is that models of this kind may be able to contribute to an analytical understanding of the synthesis of a firm by enabling an observer, who may be an employee, a manager, an investor, a client, a partner, an analyst or a consultant, to interact selectively with that firm and thereby take part in its reproduction and variation.\n\nSchriften\n\nDirk Baecker\n\nhttp://homepage.mac.com/baecker/schriften.html\n\nSocial Systems (Writing Science)\n\nNiklas Luhmann, John Bednarz (Translator), Dirk Baecker (Translator)\n\nPublication Date: January 1st, 1996\n\nPublisher: Stanford University Press\n\nISBN: 9780804726252\n\nPages: 684\n\nhttps://mitpressbookstore.mit.edu/book/9780804726252\n\nThe Network Synthesis of Social Action I: Towards a Sociological Theory of Next Society\n\nAuthor: Baecker, Dirk\n\nSource: Cybernetics & Human Knowing, Volume 14, Number 4, 2007, pp. 9-42(34)\n\nPublisher: Imprint Academic\n\nhttps://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/chk/2007/00000014/00000004/art00002?crawler=true\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=856212\n\nThe Network Synthesis of Social Action II: Understanding Catjects\n\nDirk Baecker\n\nCybernetics And Human Knowing.

The paper looks at the “cross” established by the calculus of indications as a universal operator of general, or reflective, negation, presents second-order observation as a means to introduce indeterminacy as a precondition to communication and reads Spencer-Brown’s primary arithmetic and primary algebra as steps towards an understanding of the (socio-)logical space comprehending any arrangement and re-arrangement of indications and distinctions. A short overview of the history of the notion of “form,” or “idea,” as developed by Plato, disclaimed by Kant and Hegel, and employed by Marx, Simmel, and Cassirer shows that this notion from the beginning hides, and passes on, problems of self-reference, even if disguised as transcendental subjectivity. A way to deal with these problems may be shown by Spencer-Brown’s introduction of imaginary states within equations of the second degree. Imaginary states, or values, allow time, society, nature, and technology to be introduced as references accounting for, exploring, and exploiting the indeterminacy created by them. v5\n\nKeywords: calculus of indications, form, nature, time, society, sociology\n\nA Model of Social Action\n\nDirk Baecker\n\nOctober 2006, updated July 14, 2008\n\nA System One Research Journal Project http://journal.systemone.at/spaces/journal/members/Dirk+Baecker\n\nClick to access Modelsocialaction.pdf\n\nLayers, Flows, and Switches: Individuals in Next Society\n\nDirk Baecker\n\nZeppelin University Friedrichshafen, GERMANY\n\n(January 15, 2011).

Spencer-brown’s Laws of Form.\n\nDirk Baecker\n\nAbstract:\n\nG. Spencer-Brown’s Laws of Form is summarized and the philosophical implications examined. Laws of Form is a mathematical system which deals with the emergence of anything out of the void. It traces how a single distinction in a void leads to the creation of space, where space is considered at its most primitive, without dimension. This in turn leads to two seemingly self-evident “laws”. With those laws taken as axioms, first an arithmetic is developed, then an algebra based on the arithmetic. The algebra is formally equivalent to Boolean algebra, though it satisfies all 2-valued systems. By following the implications of the algebra to its logical conclusions, self-reference emerges within the system in the guise of re-entry into the system. Spencer-Brown interprets this re-entry as creating time in much the same way in which distinction created space. Finally the paper considers the question of self-reference as seen in Francisco Varela’s Principles of Biological Autonomy, which extended Spencer-Brown’s Laws of Form to a 3-valued system.\n\nOrganization and Decision\n\nAuthors NIklas Luhmann, Dirk Baecker\n\nEditor Dirk Baecker\n\nTranslated by Rhodes Barrett\n\nEdition illustrated\n\nPublisher Cambridge University Press, 2018\n\nISBN 1108472079, 9781108472074\n\nLength 418 pages\n\nWozu Systeme?\n\nAuthor Dirk Baecker\n\nPublisher Kulturverl.

In this sense, the concept is usually intended to overcome an unproductive oscillation between methodological subjectivism and objectivism. The concept is especially predominant in social theories and theories of the self.\n\nAlthough German idealist philosophers Johann Fichte (1762–1814) and G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) stressed the importance of intersubjectivity, the concept became influential in the twentieth century through the work of American social psychologist George Herbert Mead (1863–1931). Mead claimed that the development of cognitive, moral, and emotional capacities in human individuals is only possible to the extent that they take part in symbolically mediated interactions with other persons. For Mead, then, ontogenesis is essentially and irreducibly intersubjective. He also put forward a social theory explaining how social norms, shared meanings, and systems of morality arise from and concretize the general structures of reciprocal perspective-taking required for symbolic interaction. In short, he argued that intersubjectivity—understood specifically in terms of linguistically mediated, reflexively grasped social action—furnishes the key to understanding mind, self, and society.\n\nAlthough the work of Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) and Ludwig Wittgenstein(1889–1951) was often more directly inspirational, Mead’s bold claim that self and society are irreducibly intersubjective has been rearticulated and supported by many distinct subsequent inter-subjectivist approaches. Action theory, symbolic interactionism, lifeworld phenomenology, hermeneutic analysis, conversational analysis, ethnomethodology, social constructivism, dialogism, discourse theory, recognition theory, and objects relations theory all take inter-subjectivity as central and irreducible. For example, Erving Goffman(1922–1982) insisted that we need a microanalysis of face-to-face interactions in order to properly understand the interpersonal interpretation, negotiation, and improvisation that constitute a society’s interaction order. While macro-and mesostructural phenomena may be important in setting the basic terms of interaction, social order according to Goffman is inexplicable without central reference to agents’ interpretations and strategies in actively developing their own action performances in everyday, interpersonal contexts. Harold Garfinkel and other ethnomethodologists likewise insist that social order is only possible because of the strongly normative character of a society’s particular everyday interaction patterns and norms.\n\nWidely diverse social theorists influenced by phenomenology also center their analyses in intersubjective phenomena and structures. Most prominently, Alfred Schutz (1899–1959) sought to show how the lifeworld of persons—the mostly taken-for-granted knowledge, knowhow, competences, norms, and behavioral patterns that are shared throughout a society—delimits and makes possible individual action and interaction. In particular, he sought to analyze the way in which the constitutive structures of any lifeworld shape social meanings and personal experiences, by attending to the lifeworld’s spatiotemporal, intentional, semantic, and role typifying and systematizing dimensions. Other theories analyze different aspects of the lifeworld: how experience and knowledge is embodied (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), the intersubjective construction of both social and natural reality (Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann), the social construction of mind and mental concepts (Jeff Coulter), and the social power and inequalities involved in symbolic capital (Pierre Bourdieu). Finally, Jürgen Habermas emphasizes the linguistic basis of the lifeworld, constructing a theory of society in terms of the variety of types of communicative interaction, the pragmatic presuppositions of using language in order to achieve shared understandings and action coordinations with others, and the role of communicative interaction for integrating society. While acknowledging that some types of social integration function independently of communicative action—paradig-matically economic and bureaucratic systems—Habermas claims that intersubjective communication is fundamental in, and irreplaceable for, human social life.\n\nDiverse prominent theories of the self are united in supporting Mead’s claim that the self is developed and structured intersubjectively. Martin Buber’s (1878–1965) distinction between the different interpersonal attitudes involved in the I-Thou stance and the I-It stance leads to the insight that the development and maintenance of an integral sense of personal identity is fundamentally bound up with the capacity to interact with others from a performative attitude, rather than an objectivating one. Mead’s claim is also developed in diverse theories of the self: Habermas’s account of interactive competence and rational accountability, Axel Honneth’s and Charles Taylor’s theories of interpersonal recognition and identity development, Daniel Stern’s elucidation of the interpersonal world of infants, and psychoanalytic object-relations theories stressing the dependence of the ego on affective interpersonal bonds between self and significant others.\n\nSEE ALSO Bourdieu, Pierre; Goffman, Erving; Habermas, Jürgen; Mead, George Herbert; Other, The\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBenjamin, Jessica. 1988.

Zurn\n\nSource: JÜRGEN HABERMAS / SEP\n\nHabermas distinguishes the “system” as those predefined situations, or modes of coordination, in which the demands of communicative action are relaxed in this way, within legally specified limits. The prime examples of systemic coordination are markets and bureaucracies. In these systemically structured contexts, nonlinguistic media take up the slack in coordinating actions, which proceeds on the basis of money and institutional power—these media do the talking, as it were, thus relieving actors of the demands of strongly communicative action. The term “lifeworld,” by contrast, refers to domains of action in which consensual modes of action coordination predominate. In fact, the distinction between lifeworld and system is better understood as an analytic one that identifies different aspects of social interaction and cooperation (1991b). “Lifeworld” then refers to the background resources, contexts, and dimensions of social action that enable actors to cooperate on the basis of mutual understanding: shared cultural systems of meaning, institutional orders that stabilize patterns of action, and personality structures acquired in family, church, neighborhood, and school (TCA 1: chap. 6; 1998b, chap. 4).\n\nHabermas’s system-lifeworld distinction has been criticized from a number of perspectives. Some have argued that the distinction oversimplifies the interpenetrating dynamics of social institutions (e.g., McCarthy 1991, 152–80). Others attacked the distinction as covertly ideological, concealing forms of patriarchal and economic domination (e.g., Fraser 1985). Habermas’s attempt to clarify the analytic character of the distinction only goes partway toward answering these criticisms (1991b).\n\nSource: COMMUNICATIVE ACTION THEORY. A SYSTEM – LIFEWORLD COMPATIBILITY OR INCOMPATIBILITY?\n\n3.5. System and Lifeworld\n\nAn important subtitle of Habermas’s theory is the concept of “lifeworld”. He used this concept inspired by Husserl (Brand, 1973, p. 143), who first used it in his work “The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology”, and then by Schütz, who brought a new interpretation to the concept. For Husserl, the world of life is a space that exists before theory / science (Schutz, 1962, p.120), includes all entities, arranged in space-time dimensions, and and is the “soil” for all socail human experience (Husserl, 1970; Schutz, 1970, s. 116).\n\nHabermas, on the other hand, thinks that the interactions between people in the lifeworld (Lebenswelt) do not take place in the consciousness of individuals (Husserl 1969: 12), but in a common space. The lifeworld (Habermas, 1971). According to him, one of the places where the negative effects of rationalization underlying modernity, such as cultural transformation, are seen most intensely is the lifeworld, which is an area of interpersonal interaction. Habermas, who attaches great importance to this sphere as the area where social rationalization takes place through language, argues that this area is occupied by the system and its subsystems such as power and money (Habermas, 1984d, Vol II: 318) and shows that this space is not rationalized sufficiently in a communicative sense (Habermas, 1984e Vol. II: 119, 173).\n\nHusserl explains the reason behind his development of the concept of the “lifeworld” as an effort to find a solution to the separation of the objective- scientific field from the subjective lifeworld as the cause of an increasing crisis of meaning in the field of European science.\n\nHabermas, on the other hand, states that he developed the concept of the “lifeworld” against the possible invasion of the private sphere, where agreement- oriented communicative action is carried out, from the system and its subsystems such as power and economy, which operate with reason for success. Because the system and its subsystems has the possibility to occupy private space in conflict situations that prevent his success (Habermas, 1984f II,: 318-331).\n\nThis means that, with the concepts of System and Life world, Habermas tries to explain how a two-level social structure can coexist. This effort is in fact the duality such as individual-society, subject-object, theory-practice, nomothetic-idiographic, natural sciences, social sciences and structure-subject, which both philosophy and sociology have worked on and tried to overcome. These oppositions appear, for example, as the opposition of science and social sciences in the Enlightenment, as the opposition of the nation-state, individual- society in the French revolution, and as the product of human development in the technological field in the industrial revolution, the opposition of the acting and transforming subject and the object connected to it.\n\nThe opposition Habermas tries to overcome or balance is the opposition of the system, which is the field of material production, and the life world, which is opposed to it and consists of the private and public sphere* where symbolic production is realized. Taking these two concepts together and explaining their contrasts will make the meaning of these concepts for communicative action theory more visible.\n\nHabermas, in his two-strucrured social theory, explains the duality of symbolic and material reproduction of society through the “lifeworld” and “system” concepts.\n\n“System and lifeworld are each evolutionarily and structurally differentiated social spheres, subsystems or even sovereign territories that are either systemically or socially integrated” (Habermas, 1981: 140).\n\nFor the structure of modern, differentiated societies, this means that the system and lifeworld exist in them as concretely separated systems of action and can be set in relation to one another (in the sense of: boundaries, primacy, superiority / subordination, mutual penetration interpenetration, mediatization, colonization.\n\nThe economy and the state administration are systemically integrated, formally organized sub-systems of purposeful rational action, which are driven by money and power as media of action release. They serve the material reproduction, disturbances of the same are to be understood as system crises or control crises. These systems are subject to the imperatives of increasing complexity. People have official roles and must seek certain goals, even if sometimes with ethical restraints.\n\nThe lifeworld on the other hand is the daily world that we share with others. This includes all facets of life, apart from organised or institution-driven ones. For example, family life, culture and informal social exchange. It is the sphere within which we lead much of our social and individual life (Habermas, 1984g, Vol. II: 126). It’s based on a implicit foundation of shared values and understandings. that give us the ability to perform actions that we know others will understand. Thus daily actions that we produce in the lifeworld are generally communicative in nature (Cooke, 1998).\n\nIf one follows the thesis of the colonization of the lifeworld, reifying effects only arise when systemically established obligations impose oneself into the lifeworld.\n\n“It is not the uncoupling of media-steered subsystems and of their organizational forms from the lifeworld that leads to the one-sided rationalization or reification of everyday communicative practice, but only the penetration of forms of economic and administrative rationality into areas of action that resist being converted over to the media of money and power because they are specialized in cultural transmission, social integration, and child rearing, and remain dependent on mutual understanding as a mechanism for coordinating action” (Habermas, 1984h, Vol. II: 330).\n\nHabermas’s goal with the rationalization of the lifeworld and the system is the rationalization of both in their own unique way. On the one hand, the structures of the system should become more complex by differentiating, on the other hand, the lifeworld should provide an environment for free and independent communication and ensure that the best arguments are accepted as a result of consensus. According to Habermas, this is a formulation that will ensure that the life-world and the system balance each other and will have a positive effect on their development.\n\nSource: The problem of intersubjectivity in Western philosophy: Boundaries of the communicative approach\n\nSource: The problem of intersubjectivity in Western philosophy: Boundaries of the communicative approach\n\nSource: The problem of intersubjectivity in Western philosophy: Boundaries of the communicative approach\n\nSource: The problem of intersubjectivity in Western philosophy: Boundaries of the communicative approach\n\nSource: The problem of intersubjectivity in Western philosophy: Boundaries of the communicative approach\n\nMy Related posts\n\nYou can search for these posts using Search Posts feature in the right sidebar.\n\nIntersubjectivity in Buddhism\n\nMeditations on Emptiness and Fullness\n\nSelf and Other: Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity\n\nSemiotics and Systems\n\nSemiotic Self and Dialogic Self\n\nPhenomenological Sociology\n\nPhenomenology and Symbolic Interactionism\n\nIndividual Self, Relational Self, and Collective Self\n\nIndividual, Relational, and Collective Reflexivity\n\nBoundaries and Relational Sociology\n\nSemiotic Sociology\n\nKenneth Burke and Dramatism\n\nDrama Theory: Choices, Conflicts, and Dilemmas\n\nDrama Theory: Acting Strategically\n\nDrama Therapy: Self in Performance\n\nDialog and Dialectics\n\nErving Goffman: Dramaturgy of Social Life\n\nVictor Turner’s Postmodern Theory of Social Drama\n\nUnderstanding Metatheater\n\nSociety as Communication: Social Systems Theory of Niklas Luhmann\n\nCybernetics, Autopoiesis, and Social Systems Theory\n\nFrames in Interaction\n\nKey Sources of Research\n\nOn the Pragmatics of Social Interaction: Preliminary Studies in the Theory of Communicative Action.\n\nHabermas, Jürgen (2002).\n\nMIT Press.\n\nSubjectivity and Intersubjectivity in Modern Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: A Study of Sartre, Binswanger, Lacan, and Habermas,\n\nAuthor Roger Frie\n\nEdition illustrated\n\nPublisher Rowman & Littlefield, 1997\n\nISBN 0847684164, 9780847684168\n\nJürgen Habermas\n\nSEP\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/#:~:text=Habermas%27s%20theory%20of%20communicative%20action,on%20which%20social%20cooperation%20depends.\n\nIntersubjectivity\n\nencyclopedia.com\n\nhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/intersubjectivity\n\n“TOWARD A RHETORIC OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY: INTRODUCING JÜRGEN HABERMAS.”\n\nGrady, Hugh H., and Susan Wells.\n\nJournal of Advanced Composition 6 (1985): 33–47. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20865585.\n\nTheory of Communicative Action Vol. II: Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason\n\nJurgen Habermas\n\n(Boston: Beacon Press, 1987)\n\n“Individuation Through Socialization: On George Herbert Mead’s Theory of Subjectivity”\n\nJurgen Habermas\n\nin Postmetaphysical Thinking: Philosophical Essays, tr.

In addition, Habermas argues that in the course of social evolution, systems of economic and political action arise whereby action is coordinated by the consequences of self-interested action, rather than consensual understanding. This chapter explores Habermas’s idea of such “systems” based on his reading of Talcott Parsons. It also examines how Habermas integrates the lifeworld and system concepts into his model of system/lifeworld interchange. It argues that the critical model developed by Habermas in Theory of Communicative Action is more functionalist than straightforwardly normative.\n\n‘System, Lifeworld, and Habermas’s “Communication Theory of Society”’,\n\nBaxter, Hugh,\n\nHabermas: The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy (Redwood City, CA, 2011; online edn, Stanford Scholarship Online, 20 June 2013), https://doi.org/10.11126/stanford/9780804769129.003.0005, accessed 29 Aug. 2023.\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/stanford-scholarship-online/book/21022/chapter-abstract/180572956?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\nAbstract\n\nIn his Theory of Communication Action, Jürgen Habermas talks about a “reconstructive social theory which employs a dual perspective”—the perspective of “system” and “lifeworld.” Habermas’s proposed theory “should explain how the reconstructed normative self-understanding of modern legal orders connects with the social reality of highly complex societies.” In developing the “communication theory of society” in which his “discourse theory of law” is to be situated, Habermas departs from his earlier understanding of the relation between system and lifeworld. This chapter explores Habermas’s concepts of system and lifeworld as well as his communication theory of society. It considers his “model of the circulation of political power”, which presents the idea of “civil society” as an elaboration of the lifeworld’s “private sphere.” It also discusses Habermas’s reference to the three “structural components” (culture, society, and personality) and argues that his notion of “system” and “lifeworld” is similar to the post-Parsons “autopoietic” systems theory of Niklas Luhmann. Finally, the chapter rejects the concept of lifeworld as separate social sphere.\n\nIntersubjectivity and critical consciousness: Remarks on Habermas’s theory of communicative action.\n\nWagner, Gerhard & Zipprian, Heinz (1991).\n\nInquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy 34 (1):49 – 62.\n\nhttps://philpapers.org/rec/WAGIAC\n\n‘Intersubjectivity – interactionist or discursive?

Although he borrows some concepts from Talcott Parsons (Holmwood, 2009) and often mentions Niklas Luhmann, his conception is closer to those of Pierre Bourdieu and Anthony Giddens (Outhwaite, 2015).\n\nWhat Habermas (1987b: 553) stresses is that system theories and theories of action ‘isolate and overgeneralize’ aspects of modernity (system and lifeworld, respectively). When, here and elsewhere, he emphasizes the role of language, he does not intend to reduce “social action to the interpretive accomplishments of participants in communication … assimilating action to speech, interaction to conversation” (Habermas, 1987a: 143). This is rather the way in which action is ‘coordinated.’\n\nIntersubjectivity and interculturality: a conceptual link\n\nAuthor: Xiaodong Dai\n\nDate: Jan. 2010\n\nFrom: China Media Research(Vol. 6, Issue 1)\n\nPublisher: Edmondson Intercultural Enterprises\n\nIntersubjectivity reflects the condition of all human existence and constitutes the basis of social communication. Interculturality opens up new social space and constitutes the largest and most productive platform for intercultural dialogue. This paper attempts to define intersubjectivity and interculturality, interpret their implications and analyze how they interact with each other. Intersubjectivity refers to the interpersonal connection between individuals who are attuned to one another and construct social relations. The polysemic nature of intersubjectivity suggests that it not only embodies mutuality and consensuses but also disagreements and tensions. In like manner, interculturality refers to the complex connection between cultures whose members negotiate to reach agreements and achieve reciprocal interactions. It implies commonalities and similarities as well as differences, contrasts and conflicts. Intersubjectivity and interculturality share a similar structure, but have different operational mechanisms. The key difference lies in their frames of reference. With more exposure to other culture/cultures, communicators can broaden their horizons, reduce cultural distance and further transform intersubjectivity into interculturality. In establishing interculturality, they need to be open to other cultures and transcend monocultural ways of thinking. Key words: intersubjectivity, transformation, interculturality\n\nCommunication as analytical unit in Luhmann and Habermas\n\nSergio Pignuoli-Ocampo1\n\n1Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas y Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I draw on Jürgen Habermas’ formal-pragmatic theory of meaning and of the lifeworld as an alternative to phenomenological approaches. However, his conception of the lifeworld reflects a cognitivist bias. Intersubjectivity cannot be adequately conceptualised merely in terms of our mutual accountability and exchange or reasons; the affective dimension of our social interactions must also be recognised. I propose to redress this shortcoming by taking account of empirical research on intersubjectivity, joint attention, and attachment. This leads me to suggest supplementing the three Habermasian validity claims to truth, normative rightness, and sincerity with a fourth, a claim to attachment, which fits with understanding the earliest infant interactions in terms of altercentric participation. Since an adequate account of the social nature of linguistic communication must do justice not only to the lifeworld as a shared background of intelligibility, but also as a background against which differences in point of view are articulated, I conclude with a brief look at the ontogeny of perspective. Keywords: lifeworld; intersubjectivity; validity claims; attachment; cognition; affect; perspective; J. Habermas; M. Merleau-Ponty\n\nhttps://benjamins.com/catalog/ceb.6\n\nThe close relationship between motion (bodily movement) and emotion (feelings) is not an etymological coincidence. While moving ourselves, we move others; in observing others move – we are moved ourselves. The fundamentally interpersonal nature of mind and language has recently received due attention, but the key role of (e)motion in this context has remained something of a blind spot. The present book rectifies this gap by gathering contributions from leading philosophers, psychologists and linguists working in the area. Framed by an introducing prologue and a summarizing epilogue (written by Colwyn Trevarthen, who brought the phenomenological notion of intersubjectivity to a wider audience some 30 years ago) the volume elaborates a dynamical, active view of emotion, along with an affect-laden view of motion – and explores their significance for consciousness, intersubjectivity, and language. As such, it contributes to the emerging interdisciplinary field of mind science, transcending hitherto dominant computationalist and cognitivist approaches.\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE ACTION THEORY.\n\nA SYSTEM – LIFEWORLD COMPATIBILITY OR INCOMPATIBILITY?\n\nÖğretim Görevlisi AHMET KÜÇÜK\n\nDüzce Üniversitesi, Yabancı Diller ABD\n\nahmetkucuk@duzce.edu.tr, 0000-0001-7802-7236\n\nDoç.

How these five types correlated with theories of conceptual systems and methodologies is also sketched.\n\nSource: Five systems concepts of society\n\nBunge’s three “concepts of society” exemplify three types of systems philosophy. This article criticizes Bunge’s analysis as minimally inadequate by expanding his range to five concepts of society which exemplify five kinds of systems philosophy: individualism, emergentism, organicism, structuralism, and holism. Emphasis is given to stages in the development of emergentism, including cybernetics (four stages), systems theory (eight stages), and holonism, and then to opposing structuralism (four examples). Organicism as a type of systems philosophy and concept of society is constructed by incorporating the constructive claims of both emergentism and structuralism and by overcoming oppositions to them systematically.\n\nSource: Holons: Three conceptions\n\nRecent advances in systems theory have required a new term, ‘holon’ (a whole of parts functioning as part of a larger whole). These advances are complicated by differing interpretations provided by three competing kinds of general systems theory: Emergentism, structuralism and organicism. For emergentism, use of the term signifies a shift in emphasis from focusing on the dynamic equilibrium between a whole and its parts to that between the whole and the larger whole of which it is a part. For structuralism, the term serves in explaining subsystem adaptation to environmental and hierarchical constraints and determinations by invariant principles. By incorporating ideas from both emergentism and structuralism into its more intricate interpretations, the author claims that organicism presents a more adequate conception of the nature of holons—now regarded as essential to general systems thinking.\n\nSource: Comparing civilizations as systems\n\nComparison of Western, Indian and Chinese civilizations as cultural systems exhibiting persisting ideals constituting important structural differences reveals that two taproots of Western civilization (the Hebraic stressing will and the Greek stressing reason) as characteristics essential to the nature of the world and man, are opposed in Hindu culture idealizing Nirguna Brahman as complete absence of both will (desire) and reason (distinctions) and yogic endeavor designed to eliminate both from persons, are partially integrated as complementary opposites in Chinese taoistic yin-yang ideals about both the universe and man.
