        "text": "Self-management socialism displayed ambiguities and vagueness in handling social controversy and public life in general, giving rise to numerous peculiarities particular to this social phenomenon in Yugoslavia. While a Leninist interpretation of democracy in socialism constituted the background of Edvard Kardelj’s recipe for “socially responsible criticism,” Yugoslavia and Slovenia were at the same time under the influence of western liberal concepts. Considering the political and ideological contexts of late socialism, the article discusses the systemic way of dealing with social criticism between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s, while trying to determine the impact of these circumstances on the subsequent evolvement of democratisation. Prior to the major social shifts of the second half of the 1980s, the “pluralism of self-management interests” could be articulated in practice primarily in a way that did not force it into competition with the Party. In those cases when this never...\n\nMassive changes have taken place in the former socialist countries of Europe in the last twenty years. The political singularities, such as the creation of numerous new nation-states and radical changes of social and political systems within the newly created state formations, as the Slovenian social anthropologist Irena Sumi pointed out, &quot;no doubt held promise of exceptional social situations which offered unique and unprecedented insights into human sociality&quot;. Namely, in the wake of the collapse of the former Soviet bloc, the socialist states from Eastern Europe and the Balkans have introduced a variety of novel policies and political arrangements indicating radical social, cultural and economic changes. However, as postsocialist and late-socialist states implemented new political values and social initiatives, they acted upon complex social and cultural systems that responded in quite different, also unpredictable ways and unexpected reversals. This often happened beca...\n\nThe problem this text sets out to examine can be described as the social consequences of the legal encoding of the Slovenian nation and its membership versus citizenry in the Slovenian post-independence constitution and laws, illustrated by two cases in which the conflict between the two came into full play. What is the nation, what is its relationship to the state, who are its members, what is the relationship between belonging to the nation, and being a citizen; and finally, what are the possible relationships between the members of the nation that live outside the Slovenian state, and the said state? These seemingly legalistic questions that every modern state defines on the basis of empirical and practical insights into its population have, in their application, entirely practical consequences for the lives of the people. In Slovenia, the people who are deemed members of the Slovenian nation, whether living in Slovenia or not, are privileged in both the constitution and legislat...\n\nThe predominant “story” about the Slovenian nationalism before the collapse of the SFRY is simple: The Slovenian nationalism (negative perception) or “the Slovenian spring” (positive perception) “ap-peared” in the 1980s, it identified itself as “anti-Yugoslavism” and reached the climax in 1991 with the Slovenian independence. Yet, historical sources - both archival and publicist - expose different story: the relation between Slovenian nationalism and Yugoslavism is much more ambiguous and complicated. As H. Grandits and H. Sundhaussen have pointed out, if we research the history of a state that does not exist anymore, we unintentionally “search for” elements of the past, which explain why the state had failed. This is also the reason why Slovenian historians – those who consider the methodology of the academic historiography – are mainly focused on the “processes of independence” or the “processes of democratization”. Slovenian Yugoslavism is not in the spotlight of attention, furthermore, it is mostly seen as an insignificant side-effect of the official Yugoslav ideology of “brotherhood and uni-ty”, not as something genuinely Slovenian."
