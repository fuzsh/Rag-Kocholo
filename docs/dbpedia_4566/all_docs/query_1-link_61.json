        "meta_description": "The chapter addresses ideas developed by Max Weber and Niklas Luhmann related to sovereignty and the state in a framework that highlights a contested constitutional semantics. It demonstrates how sociology enables the ideals of sovereignty to be placed into more general social theories on rationalisation and functional differentiation. It discusses the concept of ‘constitutionalism’, arguing for a sociological version. It goes on to argue that Max Weber provided a concept of sovereignty along with his understanding of the constitutional state. It discusses Niklas Luhmann’s theory of the state, and argues that the sovereignty debate ought to be seen as a legitimating semantics.",
