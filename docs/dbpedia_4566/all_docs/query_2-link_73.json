        "text": "Niklas Luhmann (December 8, 1927 – November 6, 1998) was a German sociologist, philosopher of social science, and a prominent thinker in systems theory, who is considered one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century.[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann\n\nLuhmann wrote prolifically, with more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles published on a variety of subjects, including law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. While his theories have yet to make a major mark in American sociology, his theory is currently well known and popular in German sociology\n\nMuch of Luhmann's work directly deals with the operations of the legal system and his autopoietic theory of law is regarded as one of the more influential contributions to the sociology of law and socio-legal studies.\n\nLuhmann is probably best known to North Americans for his debate with the critical theorist Jürgen Habermas over the potential of social systems theory\n\nLuhmann's work tracks closer to complexity theory broadly speaking, in that it aims to address any aspect of social life within a universal theoretical framework - of which the diversity of subjects he wrote about is an indication.\n\nLuhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.[8]"
