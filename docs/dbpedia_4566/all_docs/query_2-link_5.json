        "text": "My understanding is that Luhmann's binary code applies to a very specific aspect of systems function; that of identifying information from noise inside the reified environment of the system. The binary mechanism is employed to establish the system's reality, which is necessarily different from any other realities. I am not aware that Luhmann extends the binary mechanism further than this. I would therefore expect criticism of this aspect of his theory to be thin on the ground also.\n\nI would love to hear a different opinion on this. Good luck with your search.\n\nHans-Georg Moeller gives an exegesis of Luhmann in Luhmann Explained. You will definitely find a critical examination there. Be forewarned though, Moeller is an orthodox Luhmannian so he does not diverge from Luhmann in any substantive way.\n\nFor what it's worth Law as a Social System uses the legal/illegal distinction. Religion as a Social System uses immanent/transcendent. Education uses pass/fail. And so on for Art, the Mass Media, Politics, the Economy...\n\nThe binary code (or opposition) can be most usefully thought as the distinction that grounds (my word) a functionally differentiated social system. I think it may not even have to be a strict binary distinction but mark end-points in a continuum which gives us (in the case of Law as a Social System, for instance) legal, quasi-legal, illegal, and their variants."
