It offers important insights into aspects of our social and natural environments and the role of the social sciences by challenging conventional notions of the relationship between empirical experiences, actual events, and causal mechanisms. Critical Realism and the Social Sciences brings together contributors from both sides of the Atlantic, all of whom engage with tenets of critical realism, juxtaposing them with traditional representations of social scientific enquiry. United in the belief that the conceptual systems hitherto relied upon affect our styles of thought, ethical choices, political orientations, and so on, the contributors explore critical realism in relation to other currents of theoretical thought, thus suggesting a basis for evaluation and further elaboration. As a whole, the volume seeks to show how this particular approach provides a way to better understand many aspects of social existence, from human attributes to the interrelatedness of human activities and the natural world. In this much-needed study, critical realism is carefully examined, sympathetically assessed, and creatively developed by authors from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. is an assistant professor of Sociology in the School of Social Sciences at York University.\n\nJON FRAULEY\n\nFRANK PEARCE is\n\nUniversity.\n\na professor in the Department of Sociology at Queen’s\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nEDITED BY JON FRAULEY AND FRANK PEARCE\n\nCritical Realism and the Social Sciences Heterodox Elaborations\n\nU N I V E R S I T Y O F TO R O N TO P R E S S Toronto Buffalo London\n\nwww.utppublishing.com © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2007 Toronto Buffalo London Printed in Canada ISBN 978-0-8020-9215-1\n\nPrinted on acid-free paper\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication Critical realism and the social sciences: heterodox elaborations / edited by Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce.

Whether your scepticism be as absolute and sincere as you pretend, we shall learn by and by, when the company breaks up: we shall then see, whether you go out at the door or the window; and whether you really doubt if your body has gravity, or can be injured by its fall; according to popular opinion, derived from our fallacious senses, and more fallacious experience. And this consideration, Demea, may, I think, fairly serve to abate our ill-will to this humourous sect of the sceptics.

Given the evidence provided by the essays collected here of the immense diversity of current interpretations and uses of CR, I might be forgiven a few paragraphs of autobiography concerning its original context. Until the end of the 1960s polarized meta-theoretical commitments – positivism and hermeneutics – dominated philosophical thinking in and about the social scientific enterprise. This polarity could be represented by the revolt of ‘symbolic interactionism’ against Parsonian orthodoxy in the United States, or by Peter Winch’s devastating Wittgensteinian attack on the very idea of a social science. The revolt against ‘scientism’ in the social sciences gained further ammunition in the shape of philosophical histories of the natural sciences – the fashionable works of Kuhn, Feyerabend, and, for those of us interested in sources, the work of Koyré, Bachelard, and Canguilhem. Not only was empiricism (and therefore positivism) faulty as a philosophical theory of knowledge, but its precepts had no purchase on its paradigms of knowledge – the actual processes of scientific thought and progress. What were the implications of the critique of empiricism for our practice in the social sciences? For many it meant abandoning large-scale theorizing about ‘structures,’ and statistical analysis of large data-sets in favour of the more modest task of interpreting the small-scale interactions of social actors in specific action-situations. But the late 1960s and early 1970s were also a time of heightened political activism and of intellectual attention to its requirements. Politically radical thought relied on critical understanding of the sources\n\nx Foreword\n\nand nature of extant social inequalities, forms of social exclusion and stigmatization, feelings of frustration and lack of fulfilment, obstacles to desired social and economic change, and so on. If social research were to limit itself to a normatively and cognitively relativistic practice of interpretation of symbolic communication in small-scale actioncontexts, more or less all the critical resources of past radical thought would have to be abandoned. At the same time, the accumulated power of the critiques of empiricism/positivism was undeniable: indeed, it had its own radical implications, in rendering socially porous and sociologically analysable the very processes of scientific thought that had previously seemed beyond critical reach. In my own case, the prospect of a resolution to this dilemma emerged in the shape of the realist account of science then being developed by Rom Harré. Here was a non-empiricist view of science that both displayed the creative role of theory in the construction of scientific explanation and sustained a defence of its objectivity. What if the question of the possibility of objective knowledge in the social sciences were posed in relation to a non-positivist, realist account of the natural sciences? At least some of the arguments of the hermeneutic tradition would have to be either abandoned or re-thought. I worked on this project through the early years of the 1970s, and Russell Keat and John Urry, it turned out, were thinking on very similar lines. It was no coincidence, as we used to say, that Russell Keat and I were both graduate students at Oxford, and both strongly influenced by the work of Harré. Although, according to his own account, not influenced by Harré, Roy Bhaskar was also a graduate student at Oxford at around the same time. His Realist Theory of Science was published in the same year (1975) as Keat and Urry’s Social Theory as Science. My Philosophical Foundations appeared a couple of years later, and Roy’s application of his ideas to the social sciences (The Possibility of Naturalism) appeared the year after that. It was only at about this time that I became aware of Roy’s pathbreaking Realist Theory of Science – the book that I still see as his greatest intellectual achievement. Though they were developed quite independently of one another, and, indeed used rather different argumentative strategies, the three books converged in important respects: they drew on non-positivist and realist accounts of natural scientific knowledge. They posed the question of the possibility of a non-positivist science of society in the light of these accounts of natural science. They answered that question in the positive – though with varying degrees of qualification. Another common feature was the connection they made\n\nForeword xi\n\nbetween a radical politics of the left and the defence of objectivity in the social sciences. This was expressed at the time in the repeated use of Marx’s Capital as an exemplar of a realist explanatory strategy, and an assumed affinity between the new realism and some form of Marxian or neo-Marxian critical theory. In my own work I took seriously the view (also shared by the three books) that the role of philosophy in the social sciences was that of ‘under-labourer’: in other words, that getting clear philosophically about the nature of scientific and social scientific theorizing and explanation was important in enabling new sorts of research practices, but could never substitute for that research. For me this meant ‘going native’ as a sociologist, abandoning the higher reaches of abstraction in favour of a more (eventually literally) ‘down-to-earth’ encounter both with the on-going research traditions in sociology and with substantive questions posed to inherited versions of the Marxian legacy. Several of these concerns intersect directly with the issues taken up by many of the essays in this volume. The first outcome was serious dissatisfaction with the qualified naturalism of Roy’s Possibility. To me this read as a qualified anti-naturalism, given the central role played in his argument by the dualism of ‘nature’ and ‘society.’ Frank Pearce gives an excellent account of my arguments against Bhaskar’s conception of social structure, since developed by Margaret Archer and himself, so I won’t repeat them here. My emphasis in that piece was on the methodological plurality of the natural sciences, suggesting that Bhaskar’s model of natural science not only fails to deal adequately with natural sciences in which experimental closure is not feasible but also ‘under-represents historicity and development as epistemologically significant characteristics of the objects of the objects of the natural sciences. Evolutionary biology, cosmology, geology, embryology are all natural sciences for which historicity and qualitative transformation pose epistemological and methodological problems which are in many respects directly comparable with those encountered in the sciences of human history, society and psychology’ (Benton 1981: 20). In other words, the methodological problems of the sciences do not stack up neatly on opposite sides of a categorical gulf between the natural and the social. The criticism went further than this. Bhaskar’s brilliant analysis of experimentation displayed the indispensability of human embodiment – of causally efficacious intentional action. But given that insight, why did the characterisation of social action and its relation to social structure\n\nxii Foreword\n\nempty the ontology of the social world of its material contents? Why were the facts of material embodiment and their psychic/social implications, the active role of material conditions of existence, of non-human living beings in the shaping of human social life and so on merely marginal presences in the ontology of The Possibility of Naturalism? At that stage, for me the issue was still one of finding an appropriate philosophical methodology to sustain a materialist understanding of social and historical processes. The aim was to develop a more adequate and sophisticated explanatory social theory that would, in turn, provide strategic orientation for a leftist politics. However, the residual Leninism implicit in this was soon to be eroded, partly by a succession of major political defeats, but more centrally by a growing awareness of very fundamental differences of value-standpoint within broadly conceived leftist/critical circles. How were issues of gender or racial oppression, stigmatized sexuality, cultural marginalization and ‘disablement’ to be normatively aligned with the emancipatory logic associated with the politics of class? Even more fundamentally (and, in retrospect, scandalously late on), I became aware of the salience of a radical green critique of capitalism and the deep challenge it posed to many of the unquestioned value orientations of the ‘traditional’ left. So, the hidden assumption that the purposes for which theory-based strategy could be taken as given was starkly exposed to questioning. If anything was to be rescued of an ‘emancipatory project,’ it would have to be one built from ‘below,’ recognizing value pluralism, respecting difference, but still seeking common ground through practice, selfcriticism, and dialogue. At this point we approach a key area of confusion surrounding the character of CR itself. Its significant achievement was critique and transcendence of the positivism/hermeneutics polarity in social science methodology. But this achievement was realized (perhaps I should say ‘actualized’) at a time of intense politicization of intellectual work, and the intellectual hegemony of various renditions of the Marxian heritage. This, and the epithet ‘critical,’ have led to the expectation that more can be asked of CR than mere underlabouring for the social sciences. Perhaps it can substitute itself for substantive scientific research? Perhaps it can draw from its own resources moral truths and a ready-made emancipatory project? Perhaps, it now seems, tell us about God and the spirit world? What can we make of all this? Was there some logical connection between realist philosophy of social science and the normative justification of an emancipatory political\n\nForeword xiii\n\nproject? What, exactly, was and is the ‘special relationship’ between Marxism and CR? How could an epistemically modest and fallibilist ‘underlabouring’ philosophy become transformed into an overwhelmingly ambitious and omnivorous religious/spiritual metaphysics? I’ll address the last of these questions first. The answer, I suspect, is only by virtue of some astonishingly weak arguments, hidden by a welter of impenetrable technical neologisms. Gary Potter has done us the great service of ploughing through this thicket to provide a clear and convincing demolition of the so-called spiritual turn. The importance of this critical work should not be underestimated. As Potter argues, the later metaphysical-religious writings of Bhaskar threaten to subvert the sources of intellectual liberation offered by CR in its original versions. This licensed and stimulated imaginative and creative theoretical work in the human sciences, welcomed plurality, and insisted on the provisional, fallible character of our understanding. This is sometimes a tough track to follow, and it is entirely different from the acknowledgement of higher sources of truth, obedience to doctrine and the struggle of faith against doubt that characterizes a religious orientation to the world. Of course, this is an orientation that many find attractive – even compelling – and they are entitled to its measures of comforts and pains. The only reservation I’ll choose to express here is that it should not claim, nor should its claims be accepted, to constitute a version, let alone development, of critical realism. To quote Potter (this volume): ‘Bhaskar (2000) identifies five moments in the history of the development of CR philosophy, each of these in turn identified with seminal text of his own authorship.’ Such flagrant self-promotion sits uncomfortably with Roy’s earlier view of CR as a collaborative research programme. But the problem is less with Bhaskar’s own view of his work than with the readiness of many followers and critics alike to see CR as somehow embodied in the person of Bhaskar (note how often this conflation appears even in this volume). Now, if CR is to retain its important intellectual role in sustaining independent and critical research, the earlier conception of CR as a diverse and collaborative research programme, not the intellectual trajectory of a single philosopher, no matter how brilliant, needs to be emphasized. The sheer diversity of the essays in this volume serves that purpose admirably. So, what of the other questions – the emancipatory project of CR, and the ‘special relation’ to Marxism? Let’s take ‘emancipation’ first. There are two main lines of argument that suggest an association\n\nxiv Foreword\n\nbetween CR and emancipatory politics. One works, but the other, in my opinion, doesn’t. The one that doesn’t is the idea advanced early on by Bhaskar of an ‘explanatory critique.’ At core this involves the claim that if a social structure can be shown to produce uncontroversially bad outcomes, it should be transformed. The standard example has been Marx’s critique of the wage form as generating false beliefs. Since it is clearly better to have true than false beliefs, then the wage form should be rejected. The particular power of this version of the argument derives form the evident performative contradiction involved in using language while denying the norm of truth-telling on which language depends. Of course, it can be conceded there may be situations in which the value of truth-telling is overridden by countervailing moral priorities, so the explanatory critique is hedged with the ceteris paribus clause. One trouble with this (there are quite a few) is that in situations where moral deliberation is required – for example, in trying to find an acceptable basis for collaborative action in politics – by definition, other things are not equal. We have not only to weigh conflicting descriptions of our situation and their rival moral claims against one another, but also to do so in dialogue with others who may make quite different choices. There are several other difficulties in this way of deriving an ‘ought’ from an ‘is,’ and some are well-explored in Andrew Sayer’s essay in this volume. Now, to an alternative, rather better, way of linking CR with emancipatory politics. Where CR differs from both empiricism and hermeneutics is in its licensing of explanatory theoretical work in the human sciences: there is no methodological barrier to attempts at explanation of patterns of events and experiences in terms of underlying structures, relations, and processes. If those patterns include ecological degradation, endemic poverty, and disease in conjunction with great affluence, gendered patterns of interpersonal violence, and so on, then they may be open to theoretical explanation in terms of deeper structural causes. This may be so quite independently of the moral or political status of the patterns to be explained. However, if there is seen to be something morally objectionable about economic inequality, domestic violence, or ecological degradation, the depth-realist mode of explanation will point to the likelihood that policies addressed at the level of the empirical patterns themselves, without changing their underlying structural causes will fail. Note that this is a very long way from supposing that emancipatory politics flows logically for an explanatory strategy. Nevertheless, it does suggest ways in which the outcome of substantive\n\nForeword xv\n\nsocial scientific research might illuminate an open and democratic dialogue in politics. The case for deeper, structural change can be made, but, as Sayer has argued, such change needs to be open to scrutiny in terms of what might be lost along with the elimination of the objectionable state of affairs, and what other problems might be posed by new, alternative structures. A recent email debate in my own institution might illustrate the point here. A petition opposing U.K. government proposals on road pricing was circulated. My personal response was to ask, Why did the petition not call for alternative ways of addressing the international conflict, ecological destruction, and health damage caused by everescalating CO2 emissions? Some participants accepted the need to reduce emissions, while they and others objected to ways of doing it that increased surveillance and loss of privacy, or that placed the burden unfairly on those least able to pay, granting privileges to the affluent. So, here is an issue in which rival values and priorities are in competition, without any obvious or uncontroversial resolution. While a quick ‘explanatory critique’ would hardly help, a depth realist critical political economy can illuminate the question why environmental issues tend to be addressed in ways that enhance state power while also deploying economic incentives that privilege the affluent. Critical political economy can also be used to suggest possible structural changes that might go some way to combining social justice, civil rights, and ecological sustainability. But note that substantive, researchbased critical political economy might be able to do this, not the unmediated philosophical nostrums of CR. It is also worth mentioning that while the above sketch suggests that a tendency to advocate structural change is a likely consequence of adherence to a depth-realist explanatory strategy in social science, it still recognizes that normative orientations to such policies are not logically entailed by the analyses they are informed by. This opens up the gap between facts and values, ‘is’ and ‘ought,’ that Bhaskar, Collier, and some other critical realists have sought to foreclose. This is a central theme of the interesting essay in this volume by Andrew Sayer. If I understand his argument, it is that the human sciences generally fail to, but ought to, recognize human social actors as needy and desiring beings, capable of suffering or flourishing, and that normativity is already present in the ‘facts’ of social life that we social scientists study. This is common ground, and although he does not cite any of this literature, there is already a great deal of philosophical and sociological\n\nxvi Foreword\n\nwork sustained by CR developing these ideas – from Kate Soper’s first book, On Human Needs (1981) onwards, including Maureen Ramsey’s Human Needs and the Market (1992), Soper’s Troubled Pleasures (1990), Ted Benton’s Natural Relations (1993), Carolyn New’s Agency, Health and Social Survival (1996), Ian Craib’s Importance of Disappointment (1994), Frank Pearce and Steve Tombs’s Toxic Capitalism (1998), Peter Dickens’s Society and Nature (2004), and many more. Oddly for a member of a sociology department, Andrew seems to derive his negative judgment of sociology’s contribution to this view of human being from its philosophical reflections, rather than through the substantive work of sociologists themselves (whether informed by CR or not). I would cite here the ‘classics’: Weber’s penetrating insights into the inner existential anxieties evoked by the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, or Durkheim’s powerful empirical demonstration of the individual’s need for normative integration and engagement in a wider sense of communal purpose in Suicide, or, subsequently, work by Sennett and Cobb on the Hidden Injuries of Class, or Arlie Hochschild’s investigation of the depth alienation involved in commercial ‘emotional labour’ in her Managed Heart. The rich content of explorations such as these far transcend the impoverished categories of either hermeneutic or positivist research methodology. Next, the question of CR’s special relation to Marxism. It seems clear that the coincidence in time of CR’s early development and the brief hegemony of critical theory and Marxism in the humanities and social sciences in some parts of Western Europe, the United States, and elsewhere has something to do with this. But is there more to it? If we take seriously the claim of CR to initiate a research programme in the human sciences, and define its role as that of ‘underlabourer’ rather than ‘masterbuilder,’ it follows that there can be no question of CR’s prescribing any specific theoretical orientation or research tradition – though it might provide resources for critical evaluation of some. The work of prominent critical realists such as Tony Woodiwiss and José López, including their essays in this volume, draws on Foucault rather than Marx, while other contributors make a case for realist readings of Foucault as well as of other post-structuralist writers, and Frank Pearce has made a convincing case for Durkheim’s status as a realist in his explanatory strategy. While conceding all this, I do think that there are good reasons for a continuing association of CR with Marxism of one sort or another. The significant contributions of Albritton, Engelskirchen and Ehrbar\n\nForeword xvii\n\nto this volume exemplify the continuing fruitfulness of that connection. I will mention three broad considerations that tell in favour of the ‘special relationship’: 1 Marx’s own philosophical reflections on his approach to theoretical concept-construction and historical explanation (and Engels’s work on history and philosophy of science) were capable of sustaining depth-realist explanatory strategies, whereas other ‘classics’ were limited in their theorizing by the deforming effects of inappropriate philosophical representations. In my 1977 book I attempted to display elements of depth realist explanation in both Durkheim and Weber, notwithstanding its incompatibility with their professed philosophies of social science. However, Marx was alone among the sociological ‘founding figures’ for whom this was practiced consistently and in a philosophically self-aware way. 2 Albritton, in this volume, explains very clearly the distinction between a theoretically ‘purified’ account of capital and the provision of ‘middle-range theories’ or concrete historical analyses. The latter two levels of analysis are not mere deductions from the most abstract (and, for him, objective) level but require further analysis and theorization of the practices, institutional forms, and so on within which capital is instantiated and with which it interacts. The structural Marxist concepts of ‘relative autonomy’ and ‘overdetermination’ were developed to achieve a similar purpose, and there is a link here, too, to Bhaskar’s use of the notion of ‘open system.’ But, with these important barriers against economic reductionism in place, it remains the case that the structures and dynamic tendencies of capitalism as a mode of economic production have overwhelming causal importance in shaping modern historical processes, constraining, promoting, and ‘colouring’ all available patterns of social life (Woodiwiss, this volume). The critical account of the political economy of capitalism that Marx developed, and that has been reworked and developed since his death, remains by far the most systematic and powerful explanatory theory of capitalism available to us. For this reason, historical materialism (as a pluralistic, fallible, and open research programme developing and revising the Marxian heritage) is indispensable for any adequate understanding of our contemporary predicament and how we arrived at it. Several of the essays in this volume (Woodiwiss, López, Frauley, Datta) testify to the value of other research traditions – notably those\n\nxviii Foreword\n\nderiving from both the earlier ‘archaeology’ and later genealogical writings of Foucault. However, the work of Foucault, as well as other post-structuralist writers, lacks (and commonly refuses, on epistemological grounds) large-scale theoretical analysis of capitalism as an economic and social system, or associated research and theorizing on the dynamic relations between capital and its various state forms, cultural processes, social cleavages, and patterns of international ‘development’ and conflict. That this is a rather fundamental defect of these alternatives to historical materialist analysis is not a conclusion that could be derived a priori from critical realist philosophy. Rather, it is argued on the basis of substantive theoretical and empirical research sustained by CR philosophy. 3 The third reason for maintaining a close link between CR and Marxism is the urgent requirement for adequate ways of thinking about the relation between human social and economic forms and the rest of nature. There are two related aspects to this. One is the commitment of the various strands of CR to a ‘naturalistic’ methodology for the human and social sciences. As argued above, Roy Bhaskar’s early defence of this position made deep concessions to anti-naturalist hermeneutic philosophies of social science through his retention of a categorical opposition between human/social and natural beings. This opposition can be displaced by recognizing the great ontological diversity of natural beings, structures, and relationships and, as a consequence (for critical realism), the great methodological diversity of the sciences that take them as their various objects. Studying the social lives of other primates in the wild is a natural science, but many of its methodological problems are closely related to those of human social psychology; the methodological problems of meteorology have much in common with the other sciences – including sociology – which also deal with open systems. Arguing from the human side of the ontological divide, no serious sociological investigation of emotional work, of epidemiology, of the health implications of socio-economic status or unemployment, of gender divisions, or patterns of crime could get far without engaging seriously with work in the life sciences (for a fuller version of this argument, see Benton 1991, 1993). These arguments have been given added force by the rise to prominence of a political agenda that recognizes the deep and growing crisis in the relationship between globalizing capitalism and the rest of nature.\n\nForeword xix\n\nThough climate change is the most widely recognised threat, the future of life on the planet is also jeopardized by other dynamic tendencies of the system. Some of these, like escalating international conflict and destabilization over access to fossil fuels, are directly causally connected to climate change. Others, such as shortages of fresh water and adequate sanitation, oceanic pollution, desertification, deforestation, and depletion of renewable resources have driving forces that are independent of climate change but still interact with it in potentially devastating ways. These changes have hitherto been seen as the domain of natural science, but there has been a growing awareness that they are the product of an inseparable intertwining of causal mechanisms, the understanding of which is fundamentally obstructed by the categorical division of the world into ‘nature’ and (human) ‘society.’ Raymond Murphy’s essay in this volume gives an admirably clear and persuasive account of the necessity of thinking across the culture/nature divide, and gives convincing illustrations in the shape of ‘natural’ disasters. Again, the tradition of historical materialism has distinctive strengths in providing conceptual resources to address these socio-ecological issues (though Murphy has elsewhere demonstrated the value of Weberian sociology in this respect – see, e.g., Murphy 2002a). The central concept of ‘mode of production’ conceptualizes social forms in terms of the structure of social relations through which human labour is deployed to work on non-human nature to produce means of consumption and the subsequent social division of the product. So, at the core of the theoretical approach is the socially organized ‘metabolism’ between society and its naturally given conditions, resources, and means. There is dispute about how far Marx himself got with exploring the implications of this for the ecological sustainability of capitalism, but the potential implicit in this and related ideas is being developed by numerous theorists and activists, some, such as Kate Soper, Peter Dickens, Frank Pearce, John O’Neill, Andrew Collier, and myself, directly influenced by CR.

Bhaskar’s next book, The Possibility of Naturalism (1978), focused more on the social sciences, and in 1989 he published Reclaiming Reality, a third crucial volume, where, in part through responding to critics of his work, he developed and consolidated his position. A Realist Theory of Science challenged the general representations of natural science while stressing that discipline’s capacity to produce valid knowledge. By reconceptualizing the nature of the relationship between empirical experiences, the wide range of actually occurring events, and the complex sets of generative mechanisms that produce experiences and events, Bhaskar developed what he termed ‘transcendental realism.’ In The Possibility of Naturalism he offered important insights into the social as well as the natural world while continuing his exploration of scientific enquiry, thereby developing a ‘critical naturalism.’ In Reclaiming Reality, he explicitly embraced what had become a general description of his position, namely ‘critical realism.’ Although there are many varieties of realism in the social sciences, we are concerned with this tradition that has emerged from the development of these early writings by Bhaskar, for, stemming from this philosophy of science and its subsequent incorporation into social scientific enquiry by British social scientists over the past quarter century, social scientific realism, especially this Bhaskarian variety, is now emerging as a formidable and major challenger to positivistic and phenomenological social science.\n\n4 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nCritical realism has had relatively little impact on North American social theory or empirical research, and this is precisely why we think it important to promote discussion and debate about its fruitfulness as an alternative to dominant modes of social scientific reasoning and enquiry. We see critical realism as providing for a renewal of social scientific enquiry, and this anthology is intended as a contribution toward the renewal. Although there are subtle differences between some critical realists, and as José López and Gary Potter (2001a: 9) point out it is a ‘broad church,’ there are some central tenets. And though we make no pretension to exhaustiveness, this movement’s tenets are, broadly speaking, the following: 1 Reality exists independently of our knowledge of it, which is also to say that it exists independently of the mind of social actors. For example, the existence of systematic inequalities within the legalpolitical sphere does not depend on our knowing of their existence. Reality is always mediated through ‘perceptual filters,’ so it makes little sense to hold that our knowledge corresponds exactly to what exists. Rather, our categories and concepts help us to make reference to some aspect of a material referent. As our knowledge is fallible, our references will always undergo continual revision. The referent does not change, but rather our references to it and how we make those references does. 2 Objects are held to belong to a stratified reality independent of our perception and are the products of (at least partially) unobservable, constitutive processes and relations. Social objects, then, are held to not simply exist but to be emergent, arising from the intersection of a mass of tangled material and discursive relations. These relations require sorting out, especially in order to identify and separate the contingent relations from the necessary relations that are constitutive of the conditions under which objects emerge as social objects that can be known by researchers. This also means that inherent to critical realism is a concern with both social structure and social action and their articulation. As well, there is a concern to see empirically apprehendable phenomena as not exhaustive of that which actually exists, which means that partially obscured or unobservable entities may be inferred to exist from what can be seen or measured. 3 There are unobservable features of social life that can be known to some degree and must be revealed in order to plausibly explain the existence, reproduction, and transformation of empirically\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 5\n\napprehendable social phenomena. For example, relations of power are not directly observable but can be inferred to exist from their effects in the social world. Such effects include class conflict, gender and racial inequalities, exploitation and domination. 4 Social structure pre-exists social action, as all human action is held to be situated activity. Social institutions such as the family, religion, education, work, and law pre-exist our birth and are relatively enduring or intransitive and constrain and enable social action. Our knowledge about these is transitive. Far from reifying social structure, that knowledge is held to be alterable and undergoing an incremental transformation. Social structure is not simply the sum of human interaction, although the former is reproduced and transformed through human interactions but also through non-human interactions as well as interactions between human and non-human entities. 5 Explanation is necessarily theoretical, and theoretical work is necessary for social scientific enquiry. It is active, conceptual work that is always tethered to an empirical referent. In other words, theoretical elaboration is tethered to an ongoing concern with the thing to be described and explained. 6 Critical realism is primarily concerned with ontology and so is ‘thing centred,’ meaning that it begins from questions about what exists (e.g., the conditions under which social objects such as ‘security’ emerge). It then moves to questions of epistemology, concerned with the production of knowledge about what exists (e.g., how can ‘security’ be investigated). This is to say that questions of epistemology are clearly distinguished from those of ontology. As critical realism is not a theory but a metatheory or a philosophy of (social) science it is compatible with a number of substantive theoretical positions (Layder 1990: 19; Sayer 1992: 4–5). For example, the work of Karl Marx (Brown, Fleetwork & Roberts 2002; Creaven 2000; Joseph 2002; Ehrbar, this volume; Engelskirchen, this volume; Albritton, this volume), Louis Althusser (Datta, this volume) Antonio Gramsci (Joseph 2002; Pearce & Tombs 1998), Émile Durkheim (Pearce 1989, 2001, and this volume), Jacques Derrida (Joseph & Roberts 2003; Norris 1987), Pierre Bourdieu (Potter 2000; Frauley 2006), Hans-Georg Gadamer (Chodos et al., this volume) and Michel Foucault (Pearce & Woodiwiss 2001; Woodiwiss; Frauley, this volume; Datta, this volume) have all been explored and situated in relation to critical realism. Likewise,\n\n6 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\npost-structuralism has also been found to be amenable (Stones 1996) as has critical race theory (Carter 2000; Frauley 2004) and feminist standpoint theory (Cain 1986, 1990; New 1998). Whether critical realists lean toward postmodernism (Stones 1996), hermeneutics and critical theory (Morrow 1994; Outhwaite 1983, 1987), are dealing with methodology (Carter & New 2004; Cruickshank 2002; Pawson 1989; Pawson & Tilley 1997; Frauley & Pearce, this volume; Sayer 1992), or are social psychologists (Manicas 1987; Layder 1990, 1993), philosophers (Norris 1987, 1997, 2000), legal theorists (Norrie 1993, 2005) geographers (Sayer 2000, this volume), or sociologists (Archer 1995; Benton 1977, Carter 2000; Carter & New 2004; Pearce & Woodiwiss, this volume), critical realism, as a metatheoretical position or set of methodological protocols, can and has been successfully and fruitfully employed for social enquiry. This collection brings together scholars from a range of disciplines from both sides of the Atlantic to systematically engage with and elaborate on critical realism, which offers an alternative to the dominant and long-standing reduction of social scientific enquiry to positivistic or interpretive-hermeneutic epistemologies. Contributors are united by a passionate belief that the conceptual systems that we deploy have serious consequences for our styles of thought, ethical choices, political orientations, forms of social analyses and modes of generating and evaluating empirical evidence. They explore these consequences in relation to realism and other currents of theoretical thought. Human attributes and capacities, societal relations and forces, and the interrelatedness of human activities and the natural world can all be investigated using the realist distinction between the empirical (the limited set of events and phenomena that human beings can experience), the actual (all the phenomena and events that have been produced), and the real (which includes not only the actual but also the stratified systems of generative structures and mechanisms that have the capacity, which may or may not be exercised, to produce these and possibly other events and phenomena). Realists recognize that ‘the objects investigated by science … exist and act independently of human activity [including that of scientists], and hence of both sense experience and thought’ (Bhaskar 1989: 12–13) and that these objects are an essential resource that needs to be shaped and modified in scientific and, above all, experimental activity. A distinction must be made between causal laws, which describe the tendencies of structures and mechanisms under specific conditions, and realized events. These latter are the outcomes of a confluence of disparate structures and mechanisms that happen to be parts of a spatially and\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 7\n\ntemporally located complexus of relations operating under specific conditions that may lead to some causal powers not being exercised, some being exercised but their effects negated, and yet others active and effective but mutually determining outcomes. Critical Realism and Natural Science: A Brief Overview When Roy Bhaskar wrote A Realist Theory of Science he identified two dominant understandings of science: empiricism and idealism. The first can be traced back to Francis Bacon and then, more important, to David Hume. According to empiricism, the ultimate objects of knowledge are atomistic events, the constant conjunction of which constitutes the facts that provide the objective content of our ideas of natural necessity. Empiricism holds science to be conceived of as a kind of behavioural response to repeated factual stimuli, and the validity of scientific knowledge is assessed by scientists in relation to its contribution to the recognition and prediction of determined effects. The second position, which can be traced back to Immanuel Kant, is transcendental idealism, which suggests that the objects of scientific knowledge are artificial constructs – models, conceptions of natural order, etc. The experience of constant conjunctions is still necessary, but this position holds that such experience is always mediated through features characteristic of all individual minds and/or through concepts collectively produced by, and informing the perceptions and practices of, human groups. What we think of as the natural world becomes a construction of the human mind and/or of the scientific community (Bhaskar 1978: 24–25). Not surprisingly, this position is also often described as a form of ‘conventionalism’ (Keat & Urry 1975: ch. 3). In order to understand why Bhaskar focused on empiricism and idealism, it is useful to elaborate on the manifestations of these positions in the decades prior to his groundbreaking work. During this period and since, the major contemporary variant of empiricism was positivism, characterized by an ontology that holds that, belying the bewilderingly complex data of our experience, the universe comprises both a series of atomistic events and a determinate order; only things that can be observed can be known to be real, and for these things to be of scientific interest, claims about them must be true for all times and places. Its epistemology holds that knowledge is to be attained though the senses via experiments, that our sensory experience of a thing corresponds in some sense to what that thing is really like, and\n\n8 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nknowledge is acquired in order to facilitate prediction and explanation of the world. This position is based on the idea that reality is simply a constant conjunction of events – that is, a series of related events that appear to us as regularities. Claims, therefore, are subject to verification or falsification to determine validity. Carl Hempel develops a sophisticated and influential variant of positivism that has been significant in discussions of both the natural and social sciences, and Bhaskar and other realists such Russell Keat and John Urry (1975) and Ted Benton (1977) pay close attention to his work and provide powerful realist critiques of it. In his covering law model of scientific explanation (Hempel 1965), Hempel’s goal is to provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be properly regarded as a scientific explanation. That which has to be explained is the ‘explanandum statement,’ which has reference to some observable event and it is explained by the ‘explanans statement.’ The latter consists of antecedent observable conditions and the general laws that on this occasion come into play. If this is an adequate explanation, it will also allow us to predict an event that has not yet occurred, and as such it also allows us to explain the event after it has occurred. In such ’deductive-nomological’ laws there is therefore symmetry between prediction and explanation.1 Hempel suggests that in addition to deductive nomological laws there are also inductive statistical laws. In the case of these latter, some particular outcome is explained when it can be shown that included in a description of its conditions is a premise that under these conditions there is a high degree of inductive probability that this particular outcome is one of a statistically determinable and demarcated range of possible outcomes.2 Scientific theories consist of sets of highly general statements, the truth or falsity of which can be ultimately decided only by systematic observation and experiment that produce agreed observation-statements. Progress in science occurs when a theory emerges that can explain all a competing theory explained but can also explain more. Progress also occurs when the concepts, laws, and theories of one science are derived from another more basic science – for example, sociology from psychology, psychology from biology, biology from chemistry, and chemistry from physics (Hempel 1969). However, Hempel, like other positivists, agrees with David Hume’s scepticism about inductivism (1740/1962: 286–302) in that we cannot assume that just because some set of events have been followed by another set, however often that has been the case, there is any logical\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 9\n\nnecessity that this will happen again. This leaves positivists in a difficult position, for there are then no grounds for asserting necessity in nature. In practice, a pragmatic resolution of this dilemma is to suggest that since there are always competing theories, and since, for a myriad of known and unknown reasons, the precise predictions of any scientific theory are only sometimes validated, a reasonable criterion for differentiating among a group of theories that try to explain some specific phenomenon is to give greater credence to the one most successful in its predictions. In this way progress in science is possible. A second more radical position is that proposed by Karl Popper. It accepts the Humean critique of inductivism (including his view that explanations are fictions, albeit useful ones) and suggests that while we can never know if a theory is correct – after all, some future prediction may be falsified – we can know that a theory is incorrect if one or more of its predictions has already been falsified. Falsificationists also typically argue that the scientific method does not first involve observations, then inductive generalizations from these to a theory, and then attempts to falsify it. Rather, it involves the hypothetico-deductive method whereby first a theory or hypothesis is formulated and then tested by making a series of potentially falsifying observations. Our conjectures tell us what to look for and what to test (Popper 1959, 1969). In this view, progress in science consists ultimately in the elimination of false theories and hence a narrowing of the field of competing potentially accurate accounts of the world. Those committed to both positions believe that science has progressed, albeit gradually, in that there has been a continuous increase in empirical knowledge, a related eradication of inaccurate representations, and a related rejection of false theorizing. And there has been a wider and more integrated plausible, but not definitive, theoretical understanding of the world. A problem for empiricists is that in order to explain phenomena they often invoke unobservable hypothetical or theoretical entities – for example, in the second book of Novum Organum (1620/1963) Francis Bacon suggests that heat is an effect of the usually unobservable expansive motion of microscopic parts of bodies, and Hempel endorses the use by science of concepts of unobservable electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields (Hempel 1965). But while positivists accept that they must on occasion make use of such entities in their explanations, they strongly differentiate these from observation terms and deny that any ontological commitment can be made to the real existence of such ‘theoretical entities.’ Instead, they assert that\n\n10 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nobservational language is ontologically and epistemologically privileged, although Hempel shows some disquiet over these distinctions (Hempel 1966: 81–82). Overall they retain the view that there is an absolute distinction between theories that offer explanations and that must be treated with scepticism, a scepticism magnified if they make use of theoretical entities, and observations that in principle can be established with certainty.3 The contrasting, conventionalist understanding of science, traced back to Kant’s transcendental idealism, yielded a powerful critique of empiricism in the 1960s. An influential indictment of many positivist arguments, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, by Thomas Kuhn (1970), takes as its starting point the history of science. He makes a distinction between two moments in scientific endeavours, one he calls normal science and the other revolutionary science; during the ‘normal’ phase scientists work within a ‘paradigm.’ They assume that their theories provide an adequate general account of which entities, forces, and relations constitute the cosmos and that any difficulties they experience in applying and developing the established theories, including failures to produce predicted results, are to be explained as problems stemming from their personal inadequacies, deficiencies in their apparatus, or with how particular aspects of the theory have been elaborated. During normal science there is little concern with falsification but a great deal with puzzle solving. However, anomalous results may accumulate to the point that a general dissatisfaction with the established paradigm may develop. There may be a revolution in thinking and the establishment of a new paradigm. This change will involve the acceptance of a new general account of which entities, forces, and relations constitute the cosmos and will provide a new research agenda producing new puzzles that will now be assiduously solved. Kuhn makes a number of crucial claims about paradigm shifts like this. He believes that such paradigms are incommensurable; the scientists operating within different paradigms live in ‘different worlds’ (Kuhn 1970: 118). Further, the movement from one to the other does not necessarily mean that the new one will account for all the problems resolved by the previous paradigm (plus providing additional solutions) but, rather, it puts in place a whole different schema for evaluating what is important. The paradigms are not in accord about how they conceptualize and explain the physical world or about what constitutes an adequate explanation, or about what counts as a proof, etc. He also argues persuasively that observations are never theory neutral,\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 11\n\nthat observers’ orientations, forms of instrumentation, and ways of interpreting results are always theory impregnated; hence, it is necessary to reject ‘the methodological stereotype of falsification by direct observation of nature’ (Kuhn 1970: 77). Predictions vindicated or falsified are no longer seen as determining the fate of theories, and the absolute distinction between observation statements and theoretical explanation is seen as no longer tenable. An even more radical version of scepticism or conventionalism is to be found in the work of Paul Feyerabend. In a series of articles and books he developed an ‘anarchist theory of knowledge’ challenging the notion that science was, could be, or ought to be a rational and objective enterprise. Feyerabend agreed with Kuhn that there are no theory-neutral observation languages or universal methodological rules; he agreed also that theories would not be rejected merely because of falsifications and that the history of science is characterized by change in meaning (Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1965: 168–172, 179–181). He concurred as well with revisionist Popperians such as Imre Lakatos (Lakatos and Musgrave 1970) that a crucial issue when evaluating rival sets of theories is to what extent they developed an empirically and theoretically fertile research programme. But he challenged the concept of ‘normal science’ – he was committed to a principle of proliferation that was opposed to any puzzle-solving normality. At the same time he was opposed to any model of scientific progress that assumed there should be a once-and-for-all replacement of one research programme paradigm by another newer one: ‘if it is unwise to reject theories the moment they are born because they might grow and improve, then it is also unwise to reject research programmes on a downward (degenerating) trend because they might recover and attain unforeseen splendour (the butterfly emerges when the caterpillar has reached its lowest stage of degeneration’ (Feyerabend 1975: 185). He believed that historically scientific progress had been possible because of ‘only one principle … anything goes’ (Feyerabend 1970: 26). For Feyerabend the implications of theses arguments were clear and positive. ‘Without universally enforced standards of truth and rationality we can no longer speak of universal error. We can only speak of what does, or does not, seem appropriate when viewed from a particular and restricted point of view, different views, temperaments, attitudes giving rise to different judgments and different methods of approach. Such an anarchistic epistemology … is not only a better means for improving knowledge, of understanding\n\n12 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nhistory. It is also a more appropriate for a free man to use than are its rigorous and scientific alternatives’ (Feyerabend 1970: 21). Bhaskar’s response to these positions is to subtly change the terms of the debate. Early in The German Ideology, Marx and Engels show that even at the dawn of truly human history, human beings, whatever the mythological categories in which they cloaked their understanding, must have developed enough effective practical understandings to manipulate the world so effectively as to collectively reproduce themselves as material and cultural beings, day by day and generation by generation (Marx and Engels 1845/1976: 31). Somewhat similarly, Bhaskar starts with the fact that there has been successful scientific practice – think of the adequacy of the scientific knowledge that is a precondition for the aeroplanes that so many of us now routinely use to fly at thirty-five thousand feet and take off and land safely – and then reflects on the very possibility of science. In doing so he is engaging in the process of answering the critical metaquestion, ‘What are the conditions of plausibility of an account of science?’ (Bhaskar 1978: 8). He draws a distinction between two sides of scientific knowledge. First, science is a social product ‘much like any other, … which has its own craftsmen, technicians, publicists, standards and skills and which is no less subject to change than any other commodity.’ But second, scientific ‘knowledge is “of” things which are not produced by men at all: the specific gravity of mercury, the process of electrolysis, the mechanism of light propagation.’ ‘These ‘‘objects” of knowledge’ do not ‘depend upon human activity,’ for if human beings ‘ceased to exist sound would continue to travel, and heavy bodies fall to the earth in exactly the same way although ex hypothesi there would be no one to know it’ (Bhaskar 1978: 21). Scientific practice involves the modelling and representing of ‘intransitive objects of knowledge’ by producing ‘transitive objects of knowledge.’ But then, acknowledging but providing a somewhat Althusserian reframing of some of the issues raised by Kuhn and Feyerabend, Bhaskar points out that such practice always draws on ‘the antecedently established facts and theories, paradigms and models, methods and techniques of enquiry available to a specific scientific school or worker.’ The scientific theories thereby produced may work poorly or well and may be modified or discarded and replaced. Science as a practice always makes use of prior ‘transitive objects’ and is only conceivable if there are intransitive objects. To elucidate this latter point. it is useful to look at Bhaskar’s crucial insights about the intelligibility of experimental activity in the natural sciences.\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 13 In an experiment the experimenter is a causal agent of a sequence of events but not of the causal law which the sequence of events enables him to identify. This suggests that there is an ontological distinction between scientific laws and patterns of events … To ascribe a law one needs a theory. For it is only if it is asked by a theory containing a model or conception of a putative causal or explanatory link that a law can be distinguished from a purely accidental concomitance … Now at the core of theory is a conception or picture of a natural mechanism or structure at work. Under certain conditions some postulated mechanisms can come to be established as real. And it is in the working of such mechanisms that the objective basis of our ascriptions of necessity lies … It is only if we make the assumption of the real independence of such mechanisms from the events they generate that we are justified in assuming that they endure and go on acting in their normal way outside the experimentally closed conditions that enables use to empirically identify them … Moreover it is only because it must be assumed, if experimental activity is to be rendered intelligible, that natural mechanisms endure and act outside the conditions that enable us to identify them that the application of known laws in open systems, i.e. in systems where no constant conjunction of events prevail, can be sustained. This has the corollary that a constant conjunction of events cannot be necessary for the assumption of the efficacy of a law. (Bhaskar 1978: 12–13)\n\nThere is, then, a need to make an ontological distinction between the intransitive causal powers of structures and mechanisms, which will only be activated and effective under specific conditions (and which, while still existing in potentia, may not be activated or effective under other conditions), the events of phenomena actually produced, and the small subset of these experienced by human beings. These objects can exist and act quite independently of human beings. At the same time, any attempts to produce knowledge of these intransitive causal powers and mechanisms necessarily depends on antecedent social products and involves human practices informed by socially situated forms of understanding and on the activation of the powers of at least some intransitive objects. These forms of knowledge may prove more or less adequate to their object and are always subject to revision. Here we have the essence of Bhaskar’s ‘transcendental realism.’ This introduction is no place to deal with Bhaskar’s treatment of these questions in detail; such is the task of the first substantive article in this volume and it is has been well explored by other realists such as Keat and Urry (1975), Benton (1977), and Sayer (1992; 2000). However, of immediate\n\n14 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\ninterest here is that from these considerations Bhaskar argued for an ontological realism and an epistemological relativism. This latter statement might seem to give support to Kuhn and Feyerabend in their claim (cf. Kuhn 1970: 100–101; Feyerabend 1965: 168–171) that theories may be so radically different in meaning as to be literally ‘incommensurable.’ However, ‘if they were literally incommensurable, i.e. shared no element of meanings in common, it is difficult to see how scientists could have had grounds for preferring one to another. It is clear that at the moment of falsification, when one theory is replaced by another, some elements of meaning must be shared in common’ (Bhaskar 1978: 191). Bhaskar’s understanding of experimentation has important implications here. Any experiment depends on theorizing what mechanisms and structures need to be excluded, stabilized, and manipulated, and hence observations and experimental apparatuses are never theory neutral. However, as time passes, constant and elaborated testing of theories provides grounds for giving credence to particular practices and results. The sciences in general are continually consolidating and making relatively secure generalized claims, and scientific apparatuses are improved and better understood, an understanding that includes also specifying their limitations. Whatever their differences about particular issues at any time, scientists share a very large set of understandings. Moreover, these include not only scientific knowledge but also everyday ‘good sense,’ that which helps secure desired outcomes, and not mere common sense, which is often little more than prejudice. Kuhn’s claim that people in different paradigms literally ‘live in different worlds’ is an example of rhetorical excess (see also Keat & Urry 1975: 60–63). We have thus far discussed some important trends in the philosophy of science that have had a major impact on the social sciences.4 These trends have been important for the growth and development of social scientific methodologies, as well as the development of various techniques of data collection and interpretation. Humean empiricism and Kantian idealism have each found their way into the social sciences, manifesting as positivistic analyses on the one hand and conventionalist, phenomenological interventions on the other. The next section will systematically set critical realism apart from these methodologies in order to get at what is distinct and similar about a realist social science. This objective is met by means of attention to modes of reasoning.\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 15\n\nModes of Reasoning, Methods, and Methodologies in Social Science Attention to methodology (modes of reasoning and explanation) as distinct from methods (techniques of data collection and interpretation) is important, but sadly this attention is more often than not considered ‘second’ order to the ‘real’ business of research (Benton 1977; Frauley 2004). However, as Sayer argues, the most crucial moment in any discussion of method is how we conceptualize. His view of method is one that ‘covers the clarification of mode of explanation and understanding, the nature of abstraction, as well as familiar subjects of research designs and methods of analysis’ (1992: 3). In other words, epistemology and ontology are key. A concern only with method or techniques of data collection can easily slide into scientism, which ‘uses an absurdly restrictive view of science, usually centring around the search for regularities and hypothesis testing, to derogate or disqualify practices such as ethnography, historical narrative or explorative research … ’ (Sayer 1992: 4). As was shown above, critical realism offers us an alternative strategy for investigating social phenomena, as it provides an alternative mode of reasoning and set of developed concepts through which to craft descriptions and explanations of social phenomena. As Norman Blaikie (1993) and Sayer (1992) have shown, research strategies (methodologies) are different from techniques of data collection (methods) in that they provide us with a mode of reasoning and sets of concepts that can be used to construct substantive theories and develop and evaluate methods. They offer us a way to understand the relationship between us and the things we seek to describe and explain. All research strategies (methodologies) offer a theory of what knowledge is and how it can be attained (epistemology) as well as offering a theory of the nature of social reality/objects of investigation (ontology). A crucial aspect of these strategies is that they are tools that allow us to conceptualize the production of knowledge and our objects of investigation, and they each offer us a different way of doing this, in that they use different analytical tools for the crafting of descriptions and explanations. In contemporary North American social science, the dominant research strategies stem from positivism (e.g., quantitative research) and phenomenology/conventionalism (e.g., hermeneutic, interpretive, and constructivist research) (see Benton & Craib 2001; Blaikie 1993; Delanty 1997; Keat & Urry 1975). It is pertinent, then, to briefly outline each in terms of its epistemological and ontological commitments.\n\n16 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nAs mentioned above, positivism is characterized by an ontology that holds that the universe is ordered by and comprises a series of atomistic and observable events that exist independently of our knowledge of them (but appear to us as regularities). It maintains that these events can be represented by universal truth claims, that only observable things can be considered real, that social reality is a set of complex causal relations between separate events, and that causes of human behaviour are external to individuals. The epistemology or theory of knowledge advanced by positivism holds that knowledge is to be attained though sensory perception via experiments, that our sensory perception of a thing corresponds to what that thing is really like, and that knowledge is gained toward prediction and explanation of the world. Prediction here is conflated with explanation. As there is a distinction made between theories that offer explanation and must be treated with scepticism, and observations that can be established with certainly, claims therefore are to be subject to verification or falsification. The ontology advanced by a conventionalist/phenomenological position holds that social reality consists of shared meanings and understandings. Here the process of interpreting our social reality rather than apprehending the physical world through sensory perception is central. Social reality is not held to be a thing interpreted in different ways but rather to be those different interpretations, and is therefore regarded as the product of our interpretations. The epistemology advanced holds that knowledge is derived from our everyday concepts and meanings, which are shared by members of our society. Researchers seek to understand the shared meanings about what is of interest and then attempt to ‘translate’ this into social scientific language using specialized categories (see Blaikie 1993). Falsification or verification is rejected as inadequate for determining validity. Realist ontology holds that objects exist independently of our knowledge of them, not unlike positivist ontology. Social reality is held to be stratified. That is, it is assumed to comprise three domains (outlined above): the real, the actual, and the empirical. For critical realists, causes of social phenomena are not located at the level of the empirical as they are for phenomenologists or positivists but in the ‘deeper’ level of the real (for Bhaskar 1975) and also the actual (for Sayer 1992). Social reality is held to be a constructed world – one comprising shared meanings – but underpinned by constitutive processes that require elucidation. The nature of the social world for realists is similar to that of conventionalists. However, unlike the latter, realism holds that there\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 17\n\nis a deeper reality underpinning what we can see or what we can know or interpret. What we see is an indicator of other things that exist that require explanation. A realist epistemology holds that social scientists need to build conceptual models in theorizing what underpins the social phenomena that are empirically apprehendable. These models are fallible. Whereas positivism attempts to find regularly occurring events or patterns in order to yield predictions, realism supposes that we can find tendencies or things that may or may not take place that may help us explain the event in question. Realism is often said to be ‘in between’ or a ‘third way’ between positivism and conventionalism. Although there has been some discussion of the compatibility of the research methods rooted in the traditions of positivism and phenomenology (conventionalism) (Bryman 1988; Layder 1993), because these are different philosophies there are irresolvable differences. Critical realism, as an alternative mode of reasoning and research strategy, shares some elements of both and has the capacity to yield knowledge that would not be arrived at if one was working from either a positivistic or phenomenological strategy of research, especially as it concerns the integration of analyses of social action and structure. Realism’s ontologically focused research questions have the potential to highlight new directions and forms of substantive research in the social sciences. It is highly unlikely that such questions would be generated or could be adequately dealt with by the methods informed only by positivism and phenomenology, as ontology is not explicitly attended to. One major feature of critical realism that differentiates it from positivism and phenomenology/conventionalism is its explicit concern with ontology, the ‘questions concerning the entities and structures that are constitutive of that region’ or field into which one is enquiring (Malpas 2001: 125). Although both positivism and phenomenology have provided the basis for North American social scientific methods for over a century, neither provides a basis for a rigorous theorization of the object of investigation. This distinction is important as our research strategies shape our styles of thought, forms of analyses, and our modes of generating and evaluating empirical evidence. Positivistic and phenomenological research designs emphasize how knowledge is to be generated without regard for what the object of investigation must be like in order for it to be known in the way proposed. As critical realism is primarily concerned with ontology. it is ‘thing centred’: it begins from questions about what exists (e.g., the conditions\n\n18 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nunder which social objects such as ‘security’ or ‘racism’ emerge). It then moves to questions of epistemology, concerned with the production of knowledge about what exists (e.g., how can ‘security’ or ‘racism’ be investigated). The demarcation of questions of ontology from epistemology in critical realism and the taking of the former as the starting point makes it unlike either of its competitors. This methodological difference reflects critical realism’s retroductive logic (Blaikie 1993). Positivistic research designs, such as those informed by middle range theory (MRT), operate via deductive reasoning while phenomenological designs, such as those informed by grounded theory (GT), operate via inductive reasoning. As the two currently dominant modes of reasoning are not retroductive in nature, critical realist research strategies will be fruitful for expanding the range of potential research questions, lines of enquiry, descriptions and explanations beyond what is available to researchers whose strategies of enquiry are rooted in either positivism or phenomenology. Given that a critical realist analytic can bear some similarities to more familiar social scientific research strategies, three caveats are worth entering. First, the suggestion that positivism and phenomenology have irresolvable epistemological differences that translate into an incompatibility of methods derived from these might be thought of as a claim that micro analysis is not compatible with macro analysis. Bryman (1988: 147) suggests that this understanding is common for the many researchers who link positivistic designs exclusively to macro analysis while linking phenomenological designs to micro-analysis. This understanding, however, is not a key issue and serves to divert out attention from more important matters. As Layder (1993: 110) has shown, and as realists in general assert, there is no necessary reason that investigation of social action and structure should be mutually exclusive, but this does not mean that the underlying modes of reasoning that animate positivistic and phenomenological modes of enquiry are compatible. Critical realism eschews both collectivism and individualism and emphasizes the articulation of social action and structure, holding that structure is antecedent and conditioning while action is reproductive and transformative. That is, there is an emphasis on the relation that obtains between situated and structured action (or human relationships) and a relatively enduring and conditioning set of social relations. The issue, then, is not whether macro-analysis is compatible with micro-analysis but with the compatibility of the different modes or logics of enquiry that inform the dominant research\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 19\n\nmethods. As Carter (2000: 64) points out, critical realism ‘preserves the empiricist concern with a unity of method in the sciences, and its correlate emphasis on objectivity, whilst incorporating the interpretivist anxiety about the reification of structures by insisting on the crucial role of human agency in the maintenance and transformation of social structures.’ Second, it may seem from this that critical realism is simply a version of grounded theory or middle range theory (see Layder 1993). However, GT and MRT offer protocols for the collection and interpretation of data. MRT encourages research led by a clear theoretical idea formulated prior to research. With MRT, one collects data that fit with a preconceived hypothesis, as the aim is to verify or falsify that proposition. In this way it only generates new theory or concepts when propositions are falsified. Evaluating the adequacy of the proposition in relation to variables is primary, and the nature (qualities/characteristics) of these variables as social objects is not problematized. Also, MRT proceeds via deductive reasoning, unlike a realist retroductive mode of reasoning. Critical realism is not a form of grounded theory either. GT has a narrow, situated focus and aims to generate a specific substantive theory to explain the particular cases utilized as data. It proceeds via analytic induction (Layder 1993: 59–60) and is basically a ‘constant comparison’ that allows for the continual revision of a specific hypothesis. The generation of such a substantive theory remains constrained by the data collected, and so theory construction is limited to the specific data analysed. The critical realist question, ‘What must the object be like in order for it to be known in the way proposed?’ is animated by retroductive reasoning. Retroduction is concerned with discovery; inductive and deductive reasoning are concerned with confirmation and verification, or, more generally, justification. A retroductive analytic is used to create a theoretical model of what might exist and what, if true, could explain the existence of that which is observed. In other words, ‘This mode of inference in which events are explained by postulating (and identifying) mechanisms which are capable of producing them is called “retroduction”’ (Sayer 1992: 107). Knowledge of how something is produced, as opposed to correlations or predictions, is the concern of this mode of reasoning. It ‘proposes something that may not have been observed or could not be observed directly’ (Blaikie 1993: 165), and it is this ‘something’ (whether actual or potential) that, if it were true (as knowledge is always fallible), would explain the existence of the social objects that MRT and GT take for granted.\n\n20 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nRetroductive reasoning is not unfamiliar to sociologists, and we can draw on classical sociological theory for illustrative purposes. Marx and Durkheim employed what could be characterized as retroductive reasoning. Marx inferred from empirically apprehendable class conflict the existence of an inherently contradictory process of capitalist production. That is, if Marx’s elaboration of a Capitalist Mode of Production were true, it could explain the emergence and reproduction of class conflict. Durkheim held that a social fact is the crystallization of constitutive and obfuscated social relations, and that these relations were what social scientists should be concerned with. Along these lines, the amount and kind of legal regulation in a society would refer to or indicate the presence of deeper constitutive relations; that is, for Durkheim, the level of social cohesion and the complexity of the division of labour can be inferred from the amount of legal regulation in a society. For Marx, from the level of exploitation and domination of one class by another it can be inferred that there is a degree of incongruence between the general lifeenhancing capacities of the means of production and their restrictive use determined by the extant social relations of production. The idea that empirically apprehendable phenomena are effects that are related in a complex way to underlying and sometimes obfuscated constitutive and sustaining processes, and that these effects can themselves generate further effects, is something that a critical-realist-informed research strategy would be explicitly concerned with, unlike positivistic and phenomenological research strategies. Third, it may be tempting to hold critical realism to simply be a version of an existing substantive realism such as criminological realism (left or right) (Lowman & MacLean 1992; Young & Matthews 1992a, b), legal realism (Hunt 1978; Leiter 1996), or feminist standpoint theory (e.g., Cain 1986, 1990; New 1998). These positions, however, offer substantive theories and attempt to be realistic in their descriptions of the empirical domains of concern. The realism that we are concerned with is very different from those that have been prominent in North American social science, especially sociology. Sayer (2001: 11, 70) captures this in his demarcation of ‘empirical realism’ from critical realism. Empirical realism ‘identifies the real with the empirical.’ That is, the domain of the real (tendencies and potentials) is held to be equivalent ‘with what we experience, as if the world just happened to correspond to the range of our senses and to be identical to what we experience’ (Sayer 1992). The ‘realistic’ theories do this and in doing so are empiricist. Critical realism, however, like positivism and phenomenology, is a\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 21\n\nmetatheory or a philosophy of science, not a substantive theory. Metatheory is speculative and not determined by empirical data. As metatheory, critical realism offers transcendental arguments that must be ‘translated’ into workable social science frameworks with specific regard to the object of investigation. As critical realism is a metatheory, it is not the same or similar to the substantive realisms known to social scientists, nor is it the same as GT or MRT. Because it is a mode of reasoning that can be used to construct new substantive theories of particular objects and events, craft alternative research designs aimed at yielding alternative descriptions and explanations of social phenomena, and discover rather than justify propositions about the object of investigation, it offers a method different from the dominant research strategies currently employed in North American social science (Sayer 1992, 2000; Frauley 2004; Outhwaite 1983). A Brief Overview of the Chapters The first set of papers by Frank Pearce, Sergio Sismondo, and Garry Potter outline and assess crucial elements of the critical realist position. These papers show appreciation of its strengths, probe it to discover some of its weaknesses, and then offer some correctives. Pearce provides a detailed account of the early work of Bhaskar and particularly of the distinctions he makes, on the one hand, between the empirical, the actual, and the real and, on the other hand, between open and closed systems. These distinctions depend on the recognition that things are agents, with potential powers, the specific nature of which need to be specified, as do the conditions that help determine whether or not they will be exercised and with what consequences. Nature itself is stratified, in that there are different levels of sets of things, and the different levels at which the particular things interact are characterized by distinctive and emergent properties. Unconstrained nature is also generally unpredictable because the same ‘things’ are often operating under different and shifting conditions, hence producing a wide range of empirical outcomes. As Pearce shows, Bhaskar’s account provides another understanding: of the nature of science; of equivalences and divisions within the sciences; of overlaps between some social sciences and some natural sciences; and of features unique to specific social sciences. At the same time, Pearce identifies ambiguities and weaknesses in Bhaskar’s arguments and shows that they compromise the ability to break with humanist reductionism. In contrast, he suggests a more\n\n22 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nstrictly sociological line of development, which he illustrates by drawing on a nuanced reading of the Durkheimian tradition. Sergio Sismondo offers a succinct discussion of a deflationist conception of truth, drawing on the sociology of science, arguing, against the dominant thought, that this is assumed to be wholly compatible with realism. Bhaskar’s deflationist understanding of truth, asserts Sismondo, serves to confine realism to an ideological position on truth that negates the logical outcome of such a position, namely, pluralism. Sismondo makes his points by means of an investigation of three broad positions on truth, namely, realism, instrumentalism, and constructivism. Garry Potter stresses the strengths of critical realism but then offers both a philosophical and a socio-political critique of much of the later work of Bhaskar, arguing that it potentially compromises not only critical realism but the (social) sciences as well. Potter, commenting on five ‘critical moments’ in the development of Bhaskarian realism, highlights for us Bhaskar’s move away from realism and illustrates the ‘sociological fracture lines of thinking within Critical Realism.’ According to Potter, Bhaskar’s later work accomplishes not an extension of realist thought but ‘a wholesale re-definition of what realism is.’ Against this latter turn in Bhaskar’s thought, Potter argues that ‘critical realism’s initial role was an under-labourer for science and social science. This is, I still believe, its most important role. I also believe that not only critical realists but all intellectuals should engage politically with the world. However, propounding unconditional love, karma, God, universal self-realisation and reincarnation does not in fact facilitate such roles.’ Potter’s conclusion is that Bhaskar has become ‘an idealist propagating errors about the nature of realism.’ Having illustrated the socio-political consequences of the later Bhaskar, Potter turns to an examination of the ‘intellectual moment’ when Bhaskar moved away from realism. The second set of papers by Anthony Woodiwiss, Richard Day, Raymond Murphy, and José López strive to show the ways in which realism(s) can be deployed to strengthen or supplement sociological enquiry. Woodiwiss is concerned to rescue sociology from constructionist idealism, which downplays the concept of social structure, with its importance being ‘eclipsed by identity within social theory over the course of the last two decades of the twentieth century.’ As a way of moving away from this position, he argues for making use of a Bourdieu-inspired ‘realist reflexivity,’ thereby combatting the flourishing of the ‘humanistic idealisms of many weird and not so wonderful\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 23\n\nkinds.’ Social constructionism and postmodernism are included here. Advocating and using this realist reflexivity, drawing heavily on Michel Foucault’s Archaeology of Knowledge, Woodiwiss seeks to demonstrate that this shift away from social structure to ‘identity’ weakens sociology’s explanatory import because it premises the sociological enterprise on a humanist ontology, which negates the complexities and autonomous aspects of the social. It is this ‘unthought’ in much of the sociological enterprise that makes reflexivity necessary, and the reproduction of the weaknesses of a humanist epistemology that require this reflexivity to be of the realist variety. The supplanting of social structure with identity is argued to be a consequence of four major events: First, as itself an object, sociology became the product of an Atlanticist institutional setting that was continuously transforming itself as the United States changed from being one of two super powers to being the sole super power and also, in ideological terms, changed from being a modern to being a post-modern society. Second, as a style of talking and writing, sociology became ever more culturalist, psychologistic and reflexive. Third, the more specific concepts that both depended on and gave content to the social structure problematic were picked off one by one and replaced by those, such as culture and discourse, that created the possibility of, or gave content to, the identity problematic. And fourth, strategically, all these developments were encapsulated in an activist feminism and an academically militant postmodernism, both of which sought the total re-theorisation of social life in a way that completely marginalized the study of capitalism and its pathologies. (pp. 114–15)\n\nRichard Day’s contribution explicitly takes up the position that poststructuralism has been wrongly and unfortunately been conflated with a poorly understood and stereotyped postmodernism, resulting in inappropriate dismissals. ‘Too many writers, from too many traditions, have for too long been dismissing so-called “postmodernism” without saying precisely what this term means to them, and without providing theoretical argumentation based on close readings of texts to support their claims. That is, “postmodernism” is all too often built up as a straw school before being casually burnt to the ground, with its occupants silently engulfed in the flames.’ Having said this, Day is clear that he is not defending eclectic and ad hoc invocations of Derrida or Jean-François Lyotard or others. He has in mind a defence of theorists\n\n24 Jon Frauley and Frank Pearce\n\nsuch as Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Jacques Lacan, achieved by demonstrating how their work cannot be adequately understood as examples of what he calls a ‘straw postmodernism.’ He thus hopes to make clear that some ‘so-called postmodernists are not discursive idealists at all, but share realism’s commitment to relative intransitivity and a depth ontology.’ He attempts ‘to show that postructuralist ontologies are like those of Bhaskarian-derived realisms, in that they are not classifiable as either positivistic or relativistic’ and that at the same time these are ‘unlike their realist counterparts.’ Drawing on Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, and Lacan, Day advances an argument that ‘post-structuralism’ is dismissed too readily by its detractors but shows how this work can be used to rethink the way in which Bhaskarian realism has approached the issue of stratification as hierarchical, the agency-structure problematic, and the transitive and intransitive aspects of social and natural reality. Raymond Murphy engages with the constructivist position on truth in his paper, arguing that critical realism ‘offers a more complete analysis by situating local constructions in their context or nature’s constructions.’ This he demonstrates through a systematic critique of constructivism and through theorizing ‘across the culture/nature divide,’ illustrating the necessity of enquiring into the articulation of humans and non-human entities in the context of natural and technological disasters. These considerations also serve to strengthen his argument that in order to flourish, critical realism must ‘also develop a strong empirical dimension.’ By looking at the subject of disasters and the sociology of science, Murphy shows that a realist social science is better equipped to illustrate that nature is not ‘impotent’ but rather is dynamic. This is necessary in that social science must be able to effectively grapple with dynamism if it is to yield adequate explanations of what he calls ‘culture-nature hybrids’ and their impact on both the natural and social worlds. José López concentrates on what he finds to be a tension between the depth explanation preferred by critical realism and the emancipatory effects to follow from this explanation. Lopez encapsulates the issue thusly: ‘While I fully endorse the depth explanation model, I have a certain difficulty in accepting its alleged correlated emancipatory function. This is not because I believe that the knowledges produced by the social sciences cannot be deployed in attempts to produce social change, but because the emancipatory model, developed thus far by critical realism, fails to capture the processes and tensions involved in\n\nMethodological and Epistemological Preliminaries 25\n\nusing social scientific knowledge to produce social change.’ To demonstrate his argument that ‘critical realism is, at the moment, poorly equipped’ to aid us in understanding the difficulties in deploying knowledge to foster social transformation, López engages with sociological and ethnographic analyses of American bioethics. These analyses illustrate what he views as the compelling depth-explanation aspect of critical realism as well as how the emancipatory aspect fails as it does not currently adequately address the pressures and constraints surrounding knowledge production and the deployment of knowledge toward social transformation. The fourth set of papers by Robert Albritton, Howard Engelskirchen, Hans Ehrbar, and Andrew Sayer each deal with political economy and its relation to realism. Albritton’s paper concerns the importance of elaborating ‘a more objective Marxian political economy.’ His elaborated conception of objectivity and ontology of capital is needed because, as Albritton stipulates, capital has played a central role in shaping modern history, and because of Marxian political economy’s role and aim in understanding this, the latter needs to be central to modern social science. As claims to objectivity have also been prominent within Marxist theory, some elaboration of an adequate conception of objectivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate ontology of capital, especially the latter’s ‘inner logic.’ The conception elaborated by Albritton ‘is sharply at odds with disembodied positivist conceptions, and while in some ways close to Bhaskar’s critical realism, it attempts to rethink ‘objectivity’ in relation to capital’s unique ontology.’ This uniqueness has to do with its ‘self-reifying properties.’ Thus, objectivity here has less to do with the epistemological notion of valueneutrality than with the nature and structure, or ontology, of capital as an object-like social entity and with the degree of the re"
