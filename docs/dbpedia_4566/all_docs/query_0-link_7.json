This is a collection of interviews with key figures in the generation of social semioticians who have taken Halliday’s concept of social semiotics and developed it further in various directions, making their own original contributions to theory and practice. This book highlights their main lines of thought and considers how they relate to both the original concept of social semiotics and to each other. Key themes include:\n\nLinguistic studies, multilinguality and evolution of language;\n\nText, discourse and classroom studies;\n\nDigital texts, computer communication and science teaching;\n\nMultimodal text- and discourse analysis;\n\nEducation and literacy;\n\nMedia work and visual and audio modes;\n\nCritical Discourse Analysis.\n\nFeaturing interviews with leading figures from linguistics, education and communication studies, a framing introduction and concluding chapter summing up commonalities and differences, connections and conflicts and key themes, this is essential reading for any scholar or student working in the area of social semiotics and systemic functional linguistics.

Practical exercises and examples as wide ranging as furniture arrangements in public places and advertising jingles, provide readers with the knowledge and skills they need to be able to analyze and also produce successful multimodal texts and designs.\n\nThe book traces the development of semiotic resources through particular channels such as the history of the Press and advertising; and explores how and why these resources change over time, for reasons such as advancing technology.\n\nFeaturing a full glossary of terms, exercises, discussion points and suggestions for further reading, Introducing Social Semiotics makes concrete the complexities of meaning making and is essential reading for anyone interested in how communication works.\n\nSocial semiotics.\n\nHodge, Robert Ian Vere, and Gunther R. Kress.\n\nCornell University Press, 1988.\n\nSemiotics was defined by Ferdinand de Saussure as” the science of the life of signs in society.” Robert Hodge and Gunther Kress here confront the conceptual difficulties that have limited its growth as a field of inquiry and demonstrate how it can be integrated with the social analysis of power, ideology, gender, and class. Social Semiotics explores the many possibilities for semiotic analysis that are created by the assumption that signs and messages must always be situated within the context of social relations and processes. Approaching semiotics as an evolving theory, Hodge and Kress first review the work of theoretical founders, including Saussure, CS Peirce, I. Voloshinov, and Freud. They build on the legacy of Voloshinov, who linked semiotics with the study of ideology, and develop the implications of his assertion that the form of signs is determined not only by the social organization of the participants but also by the immediate conditions of their interaction. Showing how such an approach can illuminate key issues is literary theory and communications, the authors analyze messages ranging from literary texts, television, and billboards to social interactions at home and school.\n\nSocial Semiotics is a major new textbook in communication and cultural studies. It offers a comprehensive and original approach to the study of the ways in which meaning is constituted in social life.\n\nHodge and Kress begin from the assumption that signs and messages – the subject matter of semiotics – must always be situated within the context of social relations and processes. They then show what is involved in analysing different kinds of messages, from literary texts, TV programmes and billboards to social interactions in the family and the school. While presenting a judicious assessment of different perspectives, Hodge and Kress also develop their own distinctive and highly fruitful approach, demonstrating how semiotics can be integrated with the social analysis of power and ideology, space and time, and gender and class.\n\nSocial Semiotics is richly illustrated with examples and written in a clear style which does not presuppose prior knowledge of the field. It will become a key textbook for courses in communications, media and cultural studies and will be of general interest to students of sociology, literature and linguistics.\n\n“Language as social semiotic: The social interpretation of language and meaning.”\n\nHalliday, Michael Alexander Kirkwood.\n\n(1978).\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/journals/csos20\n\nSocial Semiotics is a peer reviewed journal that publishes high quality papers that deal with the study of semiotic resources and practices including words, images, behaviours, settings, sounds, design, etc., and the way these are connected to the organization of societies and everyday lives.\n\nArticles must focus on a specific semiotic phenomenon and embody, in their argument and conclusion, a critique of the limitations on and variations in the ways in which semiotic resources/practices may perpetuate biases, imbalance or legitimize and maintain kinds of power interests.\n\nSemiotic analysis in articles might draw on linguistic analysis, visual analysis, content analysis, ethnography, interviews, as well as production studies, and can be tied to political economy. The journal especially welcomes papers that analyse everyday phenomena and the sociopolitical significance of representations.\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nWikipedia\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_semiotics\n\nLogic as Semiotic: The Theory of Signs,\n\nPeirce, C.

From a social semiotic perspective, contexts are constituted by the communicative processes taking place in them, so that semiosis—the process of signification in all its complexity—becomes the main focus of research. Klaus Jensen’ s book is an attempt to lay the foundations for a methodologically rigorous social semiotics of the mass media. From Jensen’ s perspective, what’ s important in mass media research is not so much the meaning of media texts, nor the institutional conditions under which the media operate, but “the social and cultural practices that constitute [the] production, transmission, and reception [of media discourses]” (p. 38). Ultimately, what Jensen has in mind is research driven by a “minimalist concept of the politics of communication. The key issue may not be how to ensure the right to engage in dialogue, but how to develop the procedures for ending dialogue and transforming it into other forms of social action” (p. 180). From this position, what counts is not so much how mass media communication takes place, but how it gets transformed into social action.\n\nIn order to gain some sort of analytical purchase on this issue, Jensen turns to Peirce’ s semiotics as his base, and carefully works through a range of theoretical arguments in support of a social semiotics which emphasizes the pragmatic character of semiosis in different contexts of mass media reception. In the first three chapters, Jensen develops Peirce’ s semiotic model in terms of the familiar triad (sign /object /interpretant) leading to ceaseless semiosis as the condition of all communicative process. Jensen’ s aim is to replace the dualism of the Western Logos tradition (mind / body; form /content; signifier/signified) with a pragmatic realism which takes as its object the way in which meaning and social action are inextricably intertwined. Through the key concept of reflexivity borrowed from Giddens, Jensen is able to redraft Peirce’ s model so that it incorporates ceaseless semiosis into the institutional and structured contexts of everyday life, leading to a study of the “reception” of mass media content by audiences.\n\nThe use of Peirce helps legitimate the essentially scientific nature of Jensen’ s project which seeks knowledge of the “empirical audience”: “there would appear to be no way around the empirical audience…. If mass communication research is to contribute a critique of media in the interest of their audiences, it must develop methodologies that engage audiences in the process of reflexivity about the social purposes of the mass media” (p. 95). The Social Semiotics of Mass Communication proposes a qualitative research program as an alternative to quantitative research into mass media. Jensen rejects the reduction of social semiosis to essential types, roles, and functions found in quantitative research, and instead opts for a “thick” description of the polysemy of discourses in contexts of media reception (chap. 8). He develops a discourse analysis which “seeks to establish the meaning of linguistic features in their discursive context, giving priority to measures of contextual meaning over measures of recurrence” (p. 99). This places Jensen’ s work firmly in opposition to research which attempts to gain objective knowledge of audiences, based on representativeness and generalizability of data. The advantage of this qualitative approach is that it provides descriptive insight into the concrete processes of discursive practices as they are likely to transform into social action in any given context, which accords with Jensen’ s desire to develop a political dimension to reception studies.\n\nIn his rejection of both quantitative research and text-based interpretation of media discourse, Jensen aligns himself with the television audience ethnography of Morley, Silverstone, Lull, Radway, and others during the 1980s which sought to define the classed and gendered basis for television audienceship. However, Jensen avoids the fundamental weakness of this cultural studies approach—its lack of methodological reflexivity in analyzing data—by proposing that data be analyzed as a discursive construct, and not as a direct representation of audience subjectivity. This “linguistic turn” is a promising move, foreshadowed in many critiques of television audience ethnography, but yet to be delivered in any empirical studies. Unfortunately Jensen also fails to deliver any extended research into audiences. His only attempts in this book are less than satisfying; there are some interviews with groups of academics and university workers, and a rather curious case of misreading by an elderly woman which provides insight into one of the many theoretical conundrums raised by Jensen. None of these excursions into the audience’ s domain really satisfies the standards of methodological and theoretical rigour which is obtained everywhere else in his book.\n\nBut I should not insist that Jensen’ s book be something that it was not designed to be. Jensen is not “doing” media research, but attempting to clear the ground for such work to take place. I have found some of his ideas insightful and challenging. For instance, Peirce’ s notion of abductive reasoning is developed by Jensen in interesting ways which might just prove useful for the discursive analysis of research data. In qualitative research based on interviews and focus groups, the problem faced by audience researchers is: what status does the data have with respect to the experience to which the information given by the research participants attests? Abduction is the commonsensical way in which people reconstitute the logic of events out of any information at hand. It might well prove useful to analyze the processes of abduction which take place within a research setting, thereby seeking to find the ways in which research participants as well as researchers “recontextualize” themselves as audience members. This kind of reflexive analysis is already done by ethnomethodology, and it is surprising that Jensen has ignored this line of sociological research.\n\nOverall, The Social Semiotics of Mass Communication is a challenging attempt to provide a theoretical basis for qualitative research into mass media audiences. There are, however, some difficulties with Jensen’ s approach. I found his syncretic treatment of issues, theories, and concepts a little too fragmenting and contradictory in places. It was difficult to see how some of the many theoretical positions Jensen manages to cram into his book, including Rorty, Habermas, Giddens, Thom, Eco, and Wittgenstein to name a few, are in any way compatible. For instance, Jensen uses cognitive psychology at one point to underwrite discourse analysis of research data (chap. 10). However, the project of cognitive psychology is to find a biological basis for the categories of meaning found in social use, thereby repressing the linguistic and discursive elements of its own undertaking. As Jensen himself has argued, discourse analysis of the contexts of reception would need to avoid abstracting data into various essentialized categories; otherwise, it risks universalizing reception into a series of predictable behaviours and attitudes, thereby losing sight of the transformational processes within contexts of communication. Another problem concerns the undeveloped relationship between the systematicity of semiosis—its intertextual connectedness to all possible signs—and social action. After considerable discussion of semiotic difference in Chapter 10, for instance, it is still not clear how Jensen gets beyond the study of sign systems in themselves (semiotics) to a study of the systematicity of signification as social action (social semiotics).\n\nNevertheless, Jensen’ s book offers a number of valuable theoretical and methodological tools for anyone wanting to develop ethnographic and qualitative research into media audiences, providing many useful ways forward, as well as many insights into the philosophical underpinnings of communication research as it relates to the media in social context.\n\nAdvancing Multimodal and Critical Discourse Studies\n\nInterdisciplinary Research Inspired by Theo Van Leeuwen’s Social Semiotics\n\nEdited BySumin Zhao, Emilia Djonov, Anders Björkvall, Morten Boeriis\n\nEdition 1st Edition First Published 2017\n\neBook Published 22 September 2017\n\nPub.

Chapter 1 provides a fully up-to-date introduction to the theory (while peculiar aspects of the theory will be dealt with in subsequent chapters when they become relevant for discussion and application to the data), and argues that social semiotics serves as a useful multidisciplinary framework for analysing text-image relations. With an aim to contributing to the existing monographs of empirical social semiotic analysis in the fields of education and humanities, this chapter argues for focussing the analytical lens on visual analysis in other major areas of impactful social research which could provide a nuanced view of semiotic resources and principles pertaining to visual imagery and text as the most prominent modes of communication in contemporary society before identifying and describing the resources and principles that operate within and across other modes.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.\n\nNotes\n\n1.A similar approach is presented by Jewitt and Oyama (2001: 138), who contend that “[i]n studies of the use of semiotic resources, visual social semiotics can only ever be one element of an interdisciplinary equation which must also involve relevant theories and histories”. Hence in the present project I integrate visual social semiotics with theoretical categories and propositions that reside in various disciplines in arts and social sciences.\n\n2.The difference between Bateman’s (2014) work and the present volume lies in the fact that the former is intended to be a textbook introducing a wide range of perspectives on text-image relations whereas there is a clear research agenda in the latter. This book aims to deal with the study of communicational practices through words and images and the way in which they are connected to the organisation of societies and everyday lives. It sets out to address the central and pivotal research question: ‘how do texts and imagery reflect and conceal specific interests, power relations and communicative strategies in specific institutional or social contexts?’, providing analyses that illuminate the everyday and the socio-political significance of representations.\n\nReferences\n\nBateman, John. 2014.

The conception of fourth-order systems as systems of meaning is embodied in social semiotics, and the conception of them as knowledge is embodied in cognitive science. Biological systems and physical systems are both systems of matter, and social semioticians have begun to investigate the semiotic affordance of materiality, for example Kress, as in the study of design, which involves ‘making meaning material’, as Kress puts it. Halliday introduced the notion of language as social semiotic in a collection of essays written between 1972 and 1976, as part of his ongoing development of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). Halliday’s book, Language as Social Semiotic or LASS, became the source of the development of social semiotics in and around linguistics, including off-shoots in critical, cultural and multimodal studies.\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nDOI:10.1075/hop.13.soc5\n\nIn book: Handbook of Pragmatics: 2009 Installment.

This notion was introduced by John Searle (1990), but we can try to find some similar background ideas. Starting from sociology, Emile Durkheim (1898) presents a study on “collective consciousness” and Max Weber (1922) thinks that we have a “subjective meaning” of what he calls communal or consensual action. In the field of philosophy, the most important sources come from phenomenology and existential philosophy. Gerda Walther (1923) maintains that we can have empathetic experience and identification with others. Max Scheler (1954) and Martin Heidegger (1928/29) think that a common intentional attitude like a reciprocal awareness is not the combination of individual intentionality and reciprocal attitudes. In the ambit of analytic philosophy, Wilfrid Sellars (1980) presents an interesting account of what he calls “we-intentions”. We-intentions involve a shared point of view from which the participants may critically assess each other’s contributions.\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: Introduction to From Individual to Collective Intentionality\n\nSource: “We in Me or Me in We?

If you enjoy reading this, please consider becoming a patron or making a small donation.\n\nWe are unfunded and your support is greatly appreciated.\n\n“If I am I, because you are you, and you are you, because I am I, then I am not I, and you are not you. But if I am I because I am I, and you are you because you are you, then I am I and you are you, and we can talk”. Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk\n\nThe capacity to engage in different types of collective intentionality is often considered a key feature of human sociality. We can enjoy a symphony, solve a task, reach a decision, and make plans for the future together, just as we can share responsibilities, traditions and customs. After winning a match with a group of teammates, I might share feelings of joy at our victory, just as I might regret that we, the Danes, lost Scania to the Swedes in 1658, or inform my mother that we have now finished moving all her furniture.\n\nBut who or what is this we, to whom intentions, beliefs, emotions, and actions are attributed? When confronted with a question like this, it might be natural to think of it as an invitation to reflect on the features that characterize us as a group, a community, or a nation. What is it that makes us, say, Danes, and who belongs – and who does not belong – to that group? Another option is to engage in a kind of descriptive sociology and examine the varieties of we. How do dyads, groups of friends, members of a bridge club, business associates, and national communities relate to one another, and what kind of we, if any, do they each instantiate? What is the relation between an ephemeral form of we that is bound to the here and now of concrete face-to-face interaction and a more enduring, but at the same time also more normatively mediated, trans-generational form of collective identity? All these questions merit further examination, but in the following my focus will be on the relation between group-identity and self-identity. What is the relation between the we and the I? This type of question is not merely of theoretical interest. Depending on one’s account, different implications follow for how to approachcrucial legal, political, and social questions related to, for instance, the status of national identity.\n\nIf we look at the political discourse, for example, the answer is often taken for granted. On a view found across the political spectrum, your group identity is your most important identity marker. Some would even claim that it is your membership of certain groups (be it a nation, a religious community, a social class, an ethnicity, a sexual orientation) and their intersection that provides you with a self-identity in the first place. It might consequently be tempting to reverse the order ofexplanation. What we need first and foremost is not an explanation of how a number of individuals come together as a we, but rather an explanation of how each of us eventually manages to secure some degree of separation and independence.\n\nPerhapsthereisawayofdefendingtheprimacyofthewethatcanavoidwhatsomewouldtaketobeexcessivemetaphysicalcommitments.\n\nIn the contemporary philosophical debate on collective intentionality, attempts to prioritize the weand the group have, however, frequently been met with scepticism. When John Searle insists that the very notion of a group mind is “at best mysterious and at worst incoherent” he is speaking for many. But perhaps there is a way of defending the primacy of the we that can avoid what some would take to be excessive metaphysical commitments, e.g. a commitment to the existence of some kind of “hive mind”. One might, for example, argue that the I – the first-person perspective, the self – is communally grounded and enabled by certain kinds of social circumstances. As one translation of the Nguni Bantu term ubuntu has it: “I am because we are”.\n\nThe community first view can take different forms. Some would argue that we first experience ourselves as part of a group, a family or tribe, and automatically partake in its way of life before we develop our own individuality and distinct perspective on the world. Others would defend the viewthat human selfhood presupposes the possession of the first-person concept. It requires the capacity to conceive of oneself as oneself and the linguistic ability to use the first-person pronoun to refer to oneself. On this account, being an I requires concept possession and language acquisition, and therefore also membership of a linguistic community. A third option would be to defend the view that the community does not merely condition what we experience, but also that we have experiences. On this account, subjective experiences are social constructs. All these accounts would claim that the standard way of addressing the problem of collective intentionality and identity suffers from what might be called an individualist bias.\n\nThere are many good reasons to reject an aggregative account of community, i.e., the view that the relation between a community and its members can be understood in analogy with the relation between a heap of sand and its composite grains. But should one go so far as to defend the reverse view and ascribe primacy to the we? Are you a member of a collective, of a we, before you acquire your own individual identity, and is the latter derived from the former?\n\nHere is one argument in favour of this view. On a certain understanding of selfhood, our self-identity is not something ready-made, something fixed by nature that simply awaits discovery. You do not have a self-identity in the same way you have a spleen, and you cannot use the same method to examine both. Who you are might partially depend on your biology, but it is certainly also a question of what matters to you and what you care about. In short, it is more an accomplishment than a given, more the result of an act than of a fact. It is a question of the values you embrace and the commitments you endorse. Indeed, it is by living a life in accordance with certain normative guidelines that you develop your own distinct point of view on matters, and thereby acquire a distinct individuality. This is why knowing that you are, say, pro-life and pro-gun rather than pro-choice tells me something about who you are. If you change your interests, political view, religion etc., you also change.\n\nBut of course, the community of which I am part influences what has significance and meaning for me. It is crucial to my personal flourishing and provides me with a background against which more individual choices about how to live can be made. To imagine that each of us develops our own preferences – be they culinary, religious or political – in splendid isolation, to imagine, as Hobbes did, that we each emerge from the earth like mushrooms without any obligations to each other, and that we only start to engage in social and communal activities because we deem this tobe conducive for the realization of our own individual goals, is clearly nothing but a fantasy. By implication, why not accept that you cannot be a self on your own, but only together with others, as part of a group?\n\nBut we need to tread carefully here. To argue that one owes one’s identity to the collective, and that one is what one is simply as a result of one’s group membership can quickly lead to the view that members of the same group(s) are alike in all essential respects. And that is obviously wrong. Indeed, just as one should not take groups and collective intentions to be simply the summation or aggregation of individuals and their intentions, one should not seek to reduce selfhood and self-identity to group identity and group membership. In what follows, I will consider two reasons why this kind of group-thinking is mistaken. First, it operates with too simplistic a conception of what itmeans to be a self and have a self-identity. Secondly, it fundamentally errs in its understanding of what it means to be (part of) a we.\n\nThe self is neither simple nor univocal. Rather, the self is something that is better viewed as multifaceted and multidimensional. This has often been recognized in the literature. Whereas William James, for instance, distinguishes between the material, social, and spiritual self, and Ulrich Neisser between the ecological, interpersonal, extended, private, and conceptual self, it has more recently become customary to distinguish a minimal experiential self from a more normatively enriched and extended self. Some dimensions of self are clearly social and first established in and through development and socialization. This would, for instance, include those aspects that are constituted by the values and norms we endorse. These dimensions can also be lost, for instance, in severe dementia.\n\nBut there are other, more fundamental dimensions that are present from very early on and which are linked to our embodiment and experiential life. Consider, for instance, the fact that we encounter the world from an embodied perspective. The objects I perceive are perceived as being to the right or left of me, or as being close by or further away from me. According to some developmental psychologists, from early infancy children are able to discriminate their own body from the surrounding environment; they can perceive where they are, how they are moving, what they are doing, and whether a given action is their own or not. Likewise, we do not experience hunger, pain, distress, fatigue, and anger as free-floating anonymous events, but as self-concerning experiences. When feeling nausea, I am not faced with a two-step process in which I first detect the presence of an unpleasant experience, and then wonder whose experience it might be. Rather, experiences are necessarily like something for a subject, they necessarily involve a point of view – they come with perspectival ownership. It might consequently be argued that a minimal form of selfhood is a built-in feature of experiential life, and that only, as Joseph Margolis has put it, “the utter elimination of experience could possibly vindicate the elimination of selves”.\n\nIf one really wishes to extirpate the so-called individualist bias, one should consequently go all the way and argue for the radical claim that experiences are socially constructed, not only when it concerns their specific content, but also their very being. Wolfgang Prinz, who defends such a view, has claimed that human beings who were denied all social interaction (like the famous case of Kasper Hauser) would be like zombies, “completely self-less and thus without consciousness”. But is such a view really plausible? The main difficulty with a view like this is that nobody so far hasbeen able to explain how social interaction is supposed to give rise to experience. Some psychoanalytically-influenced developmental psychologists have suggested that it is the caretakerthat teaches the infant to attend to its own initially non-conscious affective states, and that the latter only become experientially manifest as a result of being introspectively monitored by the infant. On this account, the caretaker’s social behaviour would thus be part of the causal process leading to experience. The problem, however, is that this model – like all other higher-order representational accounts of consciousness – fails to explain how a non-conscious mental state can be transformed into a subjective experience by being targeted by another (in this case, sociallyinduced) non-conscious higher-order mental state.\n\nYoucannotbeamemberofawewithoutsomehowaffirmingorendorsingthatmembershipexperientially.Tobepartofawe,youhavetoexperienceitfromwithin.\n\nWhat about the we? Why does an attempt to derive the I from the we fail to understand the nature of the first-person plural? It is important here to realize that a we is a quite particular kind of social formation. Although by birth(right) one might belong to a certain social category (family, class, ethnicity, blood group, etc.) regardless of whether or not one knows or cares about it, and although outsiders might classify one as a member of a certain group quite independently of one’s own view of the matter, such externally enforced classifications are not of much relevance if we wish to understand what it means to be part of a we. In contrast to various kinds of aggregate groups, a we requires an experiential anchoring. To put it differently, you cannot be a member of a we without somehow affirming or endorsing that membership experientially. To be part of a we, you have to experience it from within. That is what makes the we a first-person plural. Saying this is by no means to say that the identification with and participation in a given group always happens deliberatively and voluntarily or that it cannot be based on shared objective features such as biological kinship. One might be born into and brought up within a certain family and community, and such memberships might be quite beyond the domain of personal will and decision. What is important, however, is that the membership in question involves rather than bypasses the self-understanding and first-person perspective of the involved parties. Even in such cases, for the membership in question to count as a we-membership, it requires that you do experience yourself as one of us.\n\nTo conceive of the we as an undifferentiated fusional oneness is to misunderstand the very notion. The attempt to derive the individuality of minds from a pre-existing undifferentiated group will consequently not get us what we want, namely a proper account of the first-person plural. Rather, if we are to speak meaningfully of a we, plurality and differentiation must be preserved in order to make possible a genuine being-with-one-another. One might express this by saying that the interpersonal differences must be bridged rather than erased. Heterogeneity is an essential part ofcommunal life. But if this is so, the suggestion that the we precedes and enables individual differentiation – be it on the level of identity or on the level of experience – must be rejected as incoherent. When Martin Buber claimed that, “Only men who are capable of truly saying Thou to one another can truly say We with one another” he was onto something.\n\nAninfant’sfirstexperiencestypicallyoccurinthecompanyofothers,butthatdoesnotshowthatitsexperiencesareenabledorconstitutedbysocialinteraction.\n\nPerhaps some might object that abstract considerations like the preceding are all well and good, but we shouldn’t forget that in real life we are together with others from the start, that from the very beginning we are all embedded in sociality. So why not just acknowledge that the collective we is prior to the individual I, or that they at the very least arise together? But here again it is important not to move too fast. First, we need to distinguish factual co-occurrence (which nobody is denying) from constitutive interdependence (which is a much stronger – and theoretically interesting – claim). The former is no evidence for the latter. To put it differently, an infant’s first experiences typically occur in the company of others, but that does not show that its experiences are enabled or constituted by social interaction. Secondly, we shouldn’t make the mistake of assuming that one can prove the primacy of the communal we simply by pointing to the fundamental role of sociality. Whereas the different forms of we (the dyad of lovers, a group of friends, an editorial board, etc.) are all quite particular social formations, sociality is a much wider umbrella term that also covers relations of antagonism, indifference, instrumental interactions, etc. To put it differently, the number of people with whom we have social relations is much larger than the number of people together with whom we constitute a we. Even if infants are ultra-social from birth onwards, this hardly shows them to be part of a we from the outset.\n\nDenying that our identity can be reduced to or exhaustively explained by our group membership(s) is not to deny that this membership in many ways shapes who we are. Even if it should turn out that a we requires some pre-existing (minimal) form of selfhood, it is far from obvious that genuine we-phenomena are compatible with just any account of self, including one that considers the essence of selfhood to reside in some kind of self-enclosed disembodied interiority. To put it differently, the fact that an individual can identify with a group and adopt a we-perspective does tell us something significant about the fluid nature of selfhood and self-identity. If it is acknowledged that we can come to share intentions, emotions, and even identities with others, this will consequently put pressure on various assumptions about the nature of selfhood and constrain the range of available options. Selfhood is not only what allows us to mark our difference to others, it is also something that permits us to share a perspective with them.\n\nIt is currently not difficult to find advocates of some form of no-self doctrine, i.e., sceptics who – often on the basis of neuroscience and/or Buddhism – deny the existence of selves. A critical rejoinder to this scepticism would lead too far afield, but it is worth noting that the claim that the self is an illusion has wider ramifications. To deny that the self is real is by the very same token to deny the reality of the community. If you eliminate the first-person singular, you also lose the first-person plural.\n\nTodenythattheselfisrealisbytheverysametokentodenytherealityofthecommunity.Ifyoueliminatethefirst-personsingular,youalsolosethefirst-personplural.\n\nArguing that a we requires a plurality of selves, arguing that it involves processes of group-identification, is, however, only part of the story. Even if I cannot be a member of a we unless I identify with the group in question, my identification is only necessary and not sufficient for membership. Why is that? Because a we by necessity involves more than one member. And whether I count as one also depends on whether the others recognize me as such. To understand the nature of a we, it is consequently not enough just to look at the relation between I and we. One also has to look at the relationship between the prospective members.\n\nTo put it differently, if we wish to understand what it means to share a belief, an intention, an emotional experience or, more generally, a perspective with others, we also need to look at how we come to understand and relate to others in the first place. Collective intentionality requires some capacity for social cognition, but are all forms of interpersonal understanding equal to the task? Is it enough simply to be able to single out and relate to others as special kinds of objects (“agents with intentions”)? Will two people who simultaneously adopt a third-person observer perspective on each other be able to enter into and maintain a joint we-perspective, or is something else needed? While recognizing that size matters – there are important differences between the kind of we whose members know each other in person and the kind of large-scale we whose members have never met, but who are nevertheless united via shared rituals, traditions and normative expectations – let me propose that second-person engagement is of crucial importance. To relate to and address another as a you (rather than as a he or she) is to relate to someone, an I, who in turn relates to me as a you.\n\nSecond-person engagement is a subject–subject (you-me) relation in which I am aware of and directed at the other and, at the same time, implicitly aware of myself in the accusative, as attended to or addressed by the other. Second-person engagement consequently involves not merely an awareness of the other, but also and at the same time, a form of interpersonal self-consciousness. The idea that the you is important for the we can not only be found in Buber, but also in classical phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz. Schutz, for instance, claims that a we-relationship is established when two individuals engage in a reciprocal thou-orientation (Du-Einstellung). To make this proposal compelling, more details have to be added, but I find it very plausible that a proper account of the we calls for a closer examination of topics such as reciprocity, recognition, and communication.\n\nDan Zahavi is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Oxford, and director of the Centre for Subjectivity Research in Copenhagen.

Think of carpooling and playing tennis. In the past two or three decades, it has become increasingly popular to analyze such collective actions in terms of collective intentions. This book’s chapters address issues such as how individuals succeed in maintaining coordination throughout the performance of a collective action, whether groups can actually believe propositions or whether they merely accept them, and what kind of evidence, if any, disciplines such as cognitive science and semantics provide in support of irreducibly collective states. The theories of the Big Four of collective intentionality (Michael Bratman, Raimo Tuomela, John Searle, and Margaret Gilbert) and the Big Five of social ontology (which, in addition to the Big Four, includes Philip Pettit) play a central role in almost all contributions. Drawing on insights from a wide range of disciplines, including dynamical systems theory, economics, and psychology, the chapter develops existing theories, criticize them, or provide alternatives to them. A number of chapters challenge the idea that there is a straightforward dichotomy between individual and collective level rationality and explore the interplay between these levels in order to shed new light on the alleged discontinuities between them. These contributions make abundantly clear that it is no longer an option simply to juxtapose analyses of individual and collective level phenomena and maintain that there is a discrepancy. Some go as far as arguing that on closer inspection, the alleged discontinuities dissolve.\n\nKeywords: collective action, collective intentionality, collective rationality, coordination, group agency, irreducibility, reduction, social ontology\n\nFrom Individual to Collective Intentionality.\n\nArruda, C.

The mind is the original source of intentionality. The study of collective intentionality is the study of intentionality in the social context. What is distinctive about the study of collective intentionality within the broader study of social interactions and structures is its focus on the conceptual and psychological features of joint or shared actions and attitudes, that is, actions and attitudes of (or apparent attributions of such to) groups or collectives, their relations to individual actions and attitudes, and their implications for the nature of social groups and their functioning. It subsumes the study of collective action, responsibility, reasoning, thought, intention, emotion, phenomenology, decision-making, knowledge, trust, rationality, cooperation, competition, and related issues, as well as how these underpin social practices, organizations, conventions, institutions and social ontology. Collective intentionality is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary area of research that draws on philosophy, logic, linguistics, cognitive science, sociology, computer science, psychology, economics, political science, legal theory, and cultural and evolutionary anthropology.\n\nKey works\n\nPioneering work by philosophers Raimo Tuomela (Tuomela & Miller 1988) and Margaret Gilbert (Gilbert 1990; Gilbert 1989) in the 1980s led to a rapid expansion of interest in joint action and intention in the 1990s, with important contributions by Michael Bratman (Bratman 1992; Bratman 1993) and John Searle (Searle 1990; Searle 1995; Searle 2009). Tuomela, Gilbert and Searle offer non-reductive accounts of joint intention. Bratman (Bratman 2014), Miller (Miller 2001) and Ludwig (Ludwig 2007)(Ludwig 2016)(Ludwig 2017) offer reductive accounts. This has been attended by work on collective attitudes, reasoning, emotions, and so on more generally (Schmitt 2003).\n\nIntroductions\n\nTollefsen 2004, Schweikard & Schmid 2012, Jankovic & Ludwig 2016, Ludwig & Jankovic 2018\n\nReferences\n\nShared cooperative activity.Michael E.

Intentionality is the property of being about, directed at, oriented toward, or representing objects, events, properties, and states of affairs. Examples of intentional states (states with intentionality, not just intentions) are belief, desire, hope, intention, admiration, perception, guilt, love, grief, fear, and so on. Collective intentionality involves joint, shared, or group intentionality and the intentionality of members (qua members) of groups that have joint or shared attitudes. More broadly, the study of collective intentionality concerns forms of intentionality that underpin social reality. What is distinctive about the study of collective intentionality within the broader study of social interactions and structures is its focus on the conceptual, ontological, and psychological features of joint or shared actions and attitudes, that is, actions and attitudes of (or apparent attributions of such to) groups or collectives, their relations to individual actions and attitudes, and their implications for the nature of social groups and their functioning. It subsumes collective action, intention, thought, reasoning, emotion, phenomenology, decision-making, responsibility, knowledge, trust, rationality, cooperation, competition, and related issues, and how these underpin social practices, conventions, institutions, and social ontology. The two main theoretical questions in the study of collective intentionality concern the ontology and psychology of collective agency and collective attitudes. The main ontological question is whether we should admit into our ontology group subjects of intentional states or attribute intentionality only to their members. The main psychological questions are, if we admit group subjects of intentional states, first, how to understand what they come to, whether they are the same or different than the intentional states we attribute to individuals and if different exactly how, and, second, what is special about the attitudes of individuals who participate in group action or whose attitudes underpin attributions of intentionality to groups? More specifically, can we understand what is special about the attitudes of individuals who participate in group agency or sustain the potential for group agency in terms of concepts already available in our understanding of individual agency, or must we introduce new concepts either of the modes of intending, believing, etc., or in the contents of such attitudes? Both questions concern the debate between methodological individualists and holists about the social, the first with respect to its ontology, the second with respect to its ideology.\n\nGeneral Overviews\n\nJankovic and Ludwig 2016 provides a quick overview of the field and the major questions. Jankovic and Ludwig 2018 serves as the most in-depth introduction to the field through chapters on nearly all its major topics. Roth 2017 provides an excellent overview specifically of shared agency. Schweikard and Schmid 2013 provides a broader overview as well as historical background. Tollefsen 2019 is a good introduction to the summative/non-summative debate in collective intentionality.\n\nJankovic, Marija, and Kirk Ludwig, eds. The Handbook of Collective Intentionality. New York: Routledge, 2018. A comprehensive handbook on collective intentionality, with thirty-three chapters divided into eight parts, on collective action and intention, other shared and joint attitudes, epistemology and rationality, social ontology, collectives and responsibility, social institutions, the origins and development of collective intentionality, and the semantics of collectivity.\n\nJankovic, Marija, and Kirk Ludwig. “Collective Intentionality.” In The Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Social Science.

DOI: 10.4324/9781315410098.ch19A short general survey of the field of collective intentionality that covers collective action and intention, the role of collective intentionality in our understanding of the social, including institutional groups, conventions, status functions and roles, proxy agency and social norms, and collective attitudes other than intention.\n\nRoth, Abraham Sesshu. “Shared Agency.” In The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by Edward N. Zalta. Stanford, CA: Stanford University, 2017. An excellent introduction to the topic of shared agency, with a focus on theories of participatory intentions, that is, the intentions that individuals have when participating in a group of agents doing something together intentionally. Discusses theories of the interrelatedness of participatory intentions as well as whether they give rise to mutual obligations and group minds.\n\nSchweikard, David P., and Hans Bernhard Schmid. “Collective Intentionality.” In The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by Edward N. Zalta. Stanford, CA: Stanford University, 2013. Focuses on shared attitudes, especially intention and belief, and is organized around the tension between the irreducibility thesis that collective attitudes are not reducible to individual attitudes and the individual ownership thesis that intentional states are states of individuals. Contains a helpful review of the history of discussion of collective attitudes, and reviews content, mode, and subject accounts of what is collective in collective attitudes. Includes a brief review of social and institutional facts, collective responsibility, and team reasoning.\n\nTollefsen, Deborah. “Collective Intentionality.” In Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by James Fieser and Bradley Dowden. 2019. Short overview of collective intentionality, focusing on the contrast between summative and non-summative accounts of attitude attributions to groups, where summative accounts explain attributions to groups in terms of the individuals in the groups having the attitudes, whereas non-summative accounts deny this. Discusses Searle, Bratman, Gilbert, and Tuomela.\n\nPretence as Individual and Collective Intentionality\n\nHANNES RAKOCZY\n\nFirst published: 13 October 2008\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0017.2008.00357.x\n\nCan Collective Intentionality Be Individualized?\n\nAnthoniew.

Our aim in this introduction is to situate claims about extended cognition within a broader framework of research on human sociality. We briefly discuss the existing landscape, focusing on ways of defending socially extended cognition. We then draw on resources from the recent literature on the socially extended mind, as well as the literature on collective intentionality, to provide a framework for thinking about the social dimension of individual minds. We then turn to a brief overview of the individualistic approaches advanced by Ludwig and Spaulding in this volume. And we close with a discussion of the transformative role of the social mind in individual life presented by Kern and Moll, as well as the distributed approach to interacting systems defended by Goldstone and Theiner.\n\nThe multiple, interacting levels of cognitive systems (MILCS) perspective on group cognition,\n\nRobert L.

In this paper, we argue that the distinctive features of human culture derive from humans’unique skills andmotivations for coordinating with one another around different types ofaction and information. As different levels of these skills of ‘shared intentionality’emerged over the last several hundred thousand years, human culturebecame characterized first by such things as collaborative activities and pedagogy based on cooperative communication, and then by such things ascollaborative innovations and normatively structured pedagogy. As a kind of capstone of this trajectory, humans began to coordinate not just on jointactions and shared beliefs, but on the reasons for what we believe or howwe act. Coordinating on reasons powered the kinds of extremely rapid innovation and stable cumulative cultural evolution especially characteristic ofthe human species in the last several tens of thousands of years.\n\n“We and I”: An Essay by Dan Zahavi\n\nDan Zahavi\n\n(Keywords: Phenomenology; Collective Intentionality; Selfhood)\n\nFrom The Philosopher, vol. 108, no. 4 (“What is We?“).\n\nhttps://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/we-and-i\n\n5 Collective intentionality and the roots of human societal life\n\nHannes Rakoczy\n\n“A Relational Perspective on Collective Agency”\n\nWang, Yiyan, and Martin Stokhof. 2022.\n\nPhilosophies 7, no. 3: 63. https://doi.org/10.3390/philosophies7030063\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/7/3/63\n\nThe anthropology of intentions: Language in a world of others.\n\nDuranti, Alessandro. 2015.\n\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\nThe narrative sense of others\n\nShaun Gallagher\n\nUniversity of Memphis\n\nHAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory 2017 7:2, 467-473\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.14318/hau7.2.039\n\nhttps://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.14318/hau7.2.039\n\nHybrid collective intentionality\n\nThomas Brouwer · Roberta Ferrario · Daniele Porello\n\nSynthese\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-020-02938-z\n\nClick to access Brouwer2020_Article_HybridCollectiveIntentionality.pdf\n\nSocial Ontology: Collective Intentionality and Group Agent,\n\nR.

Zima (Author)\n\nhttps://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/subjectivity-and-identity-9781780937328/\n\nDescription\n\nSubjectivity and Identity is a philosophical and interdisciplinary study that critically evaluates critically the most important philosophical, sociological, psychological and literary debates on subjectivity and the subject. Starting from a history of the concept of the subject from modernity to postmodernity – from Descartes and Kant to Adorno and Lyotard – Peter V. Zima distinguishes between individual, collective, mythical and other subjects.\n\nMost texts on subjectivity and the subject present the topic from the point of view of a single discipline: philosophy, sociology, psychology or theory of literature. In Subjectivity and Identity Zima links philosophical approaches to those of sociology, psychology and literary criticism. The link between philosophy and sociology is social philosophy (e.g. Althusser, Marcuse, Habermas), the link between philosophy and literary criticism is aesthetics (e.g. Adorno, Lyotard, Vattimo). Philosophy and psychology can be related thanks to the psychological implications of several philosophical concepts of subjectivity (Hobbes, Stirner, Sartre).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface\n\n1.

In order to elucidate the phenomenon of collective intentionality, I shall present a taxonomy of collective, intersubjective and social intentionality, and consider a thesis about shared intentionality. The taxonomy intends to show that although collective, intersubjective and social intentionality are very close phenomena, nonetheless they are different types of intentionality, and that, like individual intentionality, collective and intersubjective intentionality involve different kinds of intentionality – practical, affective and cognitive – which have to be distinguished. The sharing thesis, I will argue for, maintains that collective intentionality is a shared intentionality in a very strong sense of the term “sharing”, a sense that implies some essential conditions, which are not required in the cases of intersubjective and social intentionality. Finally I shall point out that intersubjective intentionality is the basis and the necessary condition for collective and social intentionality.\n\nSocial Ontology and Collective Intentionality – An Interdisciplinary Workshop\n\nMacquarie University 2012\n\nhttps://philevents.org/event/show/1098\n\nDetails\n\nSocial Ontology as ontological inquiry of social reality – of collectives, practices, laws, material culture and other aspects of reality dependent on sociality including humans themselves and their minds – is a rapidly evolving international field of research. Collective intentionality is one of the key concepts in social ontology in terms of which the basic constitution of all things social is nowadays discussed. It is closely related to themes like mutual belief, joint action and shared emotion. Though many of the central authors in contemporary social ontology are philosophers (including Michael Bratman, Margaret Gilbert, Philip Pettit, John Searle, Raimo Tuomela and others), social ontology also brings together research in many other disciplines, including theoretical sociology, law, economics, cognitive science, psychology, anthropology and political science. The common focus in all these theoretical endeavors is the basic constitution of entities and processes of the social world.\n\nInterest in social ontology is globally shared, and prominently represented in the biannual Collective Intentionality Conferences (https://sites.google.com/site/collintviii/), meetings of the European Network for Social Ontology (http://cipp.unibas.ch/activities/network/) and other such events around the world. The aim of this interdisciplinary workshop is to bring together researchers in social ontology especially in the Australasian region, but contributions from all continents are heartily welcomed.\n\nCollective Intentionality\n\nLudwig, Kirk and Jankovic, Marija,\n\n(May 15, 2016).\n\n“Collective Intentionality,” with Marija Jankovic, in The Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Social Science, ed., Lee McIntyre and Alex Rosenberg, New York: Routledge, 2016., Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3388724\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3388724\n\nBryce Huebner: Macrocognition: A Theory\n\nof Distributed Minds and Collective Intentionality\n\nOxford University Press, Oxford, 2014,ISBN 9780199926275\n\nMatteo Colombo\n\nWho has got our Group-Intentions?\n\nLudger Jansen (Bonn)\n\nThe Ontology of Collective Action\n\nKirk Ludwig\n\nChapter 5 in Book From Individual to Collective Intentionality: New Essays\n\nWe Heal as One: Collective Intentionality as a Building Block for the Necessary and Urgent Reformation of Economics in the New Normal\n\nPaul John M.

Contemporary approaches to group intentionality have either dismissed these attributions as metaphorical or provided an analysis of our attributions in terms of the intentional states of individuals in the group. Insection1, the author argues that these approaches are problematic. In sections 2 and 3, the author defends the view that certain groups are literally intentional agents. In section 4, the author argues that there are significant reasons for social scientists and philosophers of social science to acknowledge the adequacy of macro-level explanations that involve the attribution of intentional states to groups. In section 5, the author considers and responds to some criticisms of the thesis she defends.\n\n1. There are some who might object to my use of Durkheim here. Admittedly, Durkheim’s collective representations are somewhat different from intentional states. I appeal here only to his analogy between the irreducibility of individual mental states and the irreducibility of social facts. Although my project may be very different from Durkheim’s, the analogy is relevant.\n\n2. Elster (1983) would, no doubt, argue that these ascriptions could be reduced to statements ascribing intentional states to individuals. My point here is simply that social scientists and philosophers of social science apply the intentional idiom at the level of groups.\n\n3. I assume throughout the article that application of the intentional idiom to individuals is explanatorily powerful. My focus is on defending the view that collective intentional state ascriptions are explanatorily powerful, and this is something I attempt to do insection4. There is a great deal of debate about the explanatory power of belief-desire explanation at the individual level. I do not have time to enter into this debate here. I will say briefly, however, that the attack on the explanatory power of folk psychology seems to stem from a narrow conception of explanation. See Lynne Rudder Baker (1995) for a convincing attack on this narrow conception of explanation.\n\n4. There are some immediate objections one might raise here. First, one might claim that we do not hold corporations morally responsible. Reflection on the way we talk about corporate acts seems to suggest otherwise, however. We certainly praise and blame corporations in our everyday moral discourse, and we do so without having any particular individuals in mind. One might argue that this practice is problematic and should be eliminated. But this claim is motivated by individualistic presuppositions. In more collectivist societies (China, for example), the practice of holding groups responsible is standard. That there are such practices does not, by itself, mean that groups are literally intentional agents. What it does suggest is that our ascriptions of responsibility and the ascriptions of intentionality presupposed by them are meant to be more than metaphorical. One might also object that corporations are not held legally responsible in the same way that persons are. Legal cases involving corporations are civil cases rather than criminal cases. In civil cases, there is no need to prove intent. Furthermore, the corporation itself is not held legally responsible. Particular individuals in the organization are held responsible. Both these claims are false. Organizations are now frequently brought up on criminal charges, and such charges need not be made against any individual in the organization. For an interesting discussion of the law and criminal charges against corporations, see http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/readingrooms/6161999.htm. This is a memorandum from the deputy attorney general on bringing criminal charges against corporations.\n\n5. This is the view espoused by Anthony Quinton in “Social Objects” (1975). He writes,\n\nTo ascribe mental predicates to a group is always an indirect way of ascribing such predicates to its members. With such mental states as belief and attitudes, the ascriptions are of what I have called a summative kind. To say that the industrial working class is determined to resist anti-trade union laws is to say that all or most industrial workers are so minded. (P. 242)\n\n6. The summative accounts are also criticized on the grounds that they do not explain certain normative phenomenon that occur in group contexts. See Gilbert (1988, 288-312).\n\n7. Gilbert uses this example to show, among other things, that it is not necessary for all or even most of the members to believe p in order for the group to believe that p. I use it here to make the stronger claim that it is not even necessary that some of the members believe that p in order for the group to believe that p. One might argue that the ascription would surely be false unless at least one member believed that the last line of Larkin’s poem was moving. This intuition needs to be defended. Our attributions of intentional states to groups will be made on the basis of certain evidence including group statements and actions. If group members are not openly opposed to the interpretation and continue to act in ways that suggest they accept it as true, then there will be no evidence to counter the group attribution.\n\n8. This is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition. Tuomela’s (1955) account is much more sophisticated than my gloss of it suggests, but I do not have the space here to give it full consideration. Since it is Tuomela’s methodology I object to rather than the details of his analysis, I think the oversimplification is justified.\n\n9. At the very most, what we do is idealize and assume that the individuals are ideally rational. But there are considerable problems with trying to explain group actions in this manner. For one, even if all of the individuals were ideally rational, this would not guarantee that they would work together to rationally obtain their goals.\n\n10. A similar point is made by David Velleman in “How to Share an Intention” (1997).\n\n11. The reason I do not adopt this line of argument is that I am interested in saying something about our practice of ascribing intentional states to organizations. Since functionalism"
