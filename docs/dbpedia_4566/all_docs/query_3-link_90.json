        "text": "This article considers the nature of the theoretical legacy-the system theory-of the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The author focuses on three topics: first, he briefly describes Luhmann's ideas in the context of the contemporary sociological thought; second, he identidies how Luh-mann's works are perceived today; third, he presents a new reflection on Luhmann's works. Paradigmati-cally, Luhmann's ideas can be attributed to the system theory, neo-functionalism and radical constructivism due to his efforts to find inspiration in natural sciences. At the same time, Luhmann found himself in the close position to the traditions of the German philosophical idealism. Although the system theory is holistic in nature, Luhmann used for its elaboration elements of the individualist-oriented approach (based on Max Weber's ideas). Thus, in Luhmann's conception, systems become holistic entities that, like individual subjects, are capable of making decisions and managing themselves. One of the strengths of Luhmann's conception is determined by his evolutionary theory consistent with random (in Luhmann's terms-contingent) development connected with the idea of an open future. As with Parsons, in Luh-mann's conception we find emphasis on the consensus ensured by communication processes. However, what is missing, are the topics of work, production, conflict, struggle and violence. The current decline in the interest in Luhmann's works has been reinforced by the fact that he was unable to translate his conceptions into instruments for the empirical sociological research. Nevertheless, Luhmann's theory of a functionally differentiated society and its consequences still represents a significant stimulus for the contemporary sociological thought.\n\nA sophisticated analysis must reflect on its basic categories, the elementary distinctions of the subject under study, before it can be applied. The most important of these, in sociology, concerns the fundamental element of the organization of sociality. If we start from what is still used in many theoretical analyses today, namely, that society is a totality of relations between people, we have not emphasized, but taken for granted, that the individual is the basic indivisible element of society. All further analysis is based on this, elementary distinctions can be drawn between at most two individuals, and the boundaries of broader social formations can be drawn between groups, strata, or possibly classes of individuals. Social structure thus inevitably becomes the structure of the population, as group structure, as stratum structure, as class structure. But how can the structural demarcations and mediating mechanisms of science, ideology, administration, law, economics, etc. be accommodated within it? Social theoretical thinking has been moving in this direction since the end of the 19th century, when it broke down \"man\" as a basic category of social organization and established that man participates in the functioning and construction of certain social formations in various roles and becomes a member of society through the socialization of the norms and rules of behavior associated with each role. The dissolution of traditional ties and increasing urbanization lead to an increase in the number of different roles per person and differences in their nature. Social theories based on roles and the relationships between them, rather than on the individual, have thus experienced greater resolution and have been able to examine more adequately the actual organization of society. However, a role is itself composed of elements that can be readily analyzed, and since Max Weber, the action that constructs the roles has been the focus of theoretical analysis. Behind the differences in roles are the types of actions, the motivations for actions, the pattern variables that characterize each action are well captured. As we have seen, Talcott Parsons based his understanding of the systemic formations that build sociality on the different roles that can be derived from the different types of actions, and finally the unitary action that builds the more complex formations can itself be decomposed into action components. Where do we stand with the compact conception of man! Modern social theory recombines these in its categories, typologies, and distinctions to capture the broader social formations. Luhmann followed this path in developing his basic categories, but was dissatisfied with the result obtained and radicalized the detachment of social theory from the individual."
