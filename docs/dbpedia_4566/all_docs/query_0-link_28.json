It is intended primarily for those who are relatively new to the discipline. To simplify the use of the dictionary abbreviations have been avoided in the text. An asterisk (*) placed before a word in a definition indicates that additional relevant information will be found under this heading. Some entries simply refer the reader to another entry, indicating either that they are synonyms, or that they are most conveniently explained, together with related terms, in one of the dictionary's longer articles. As a rule, nouns with an associated qualifying adjective may be searched for under either word; thus, for example, ‘nuclear family’ is also entered as ‘family, nuclear’. All the major entries and many of the shorter ones mention at least one bibliographical source which will allow the reader to pursue the relevant literature independently. Such references should be of interest to American and British students alike, despite the distinctive histories of the discipline in these countries, although some entries do point readers on either side of the Atlantic in slightly different directions. Sociology itself has a clear theoretical core but an irretrievably opaque perimeter. Arguably, this is one of the subject's principal merits, since it facilitates study of genuinely interdisciplinary problems—which include many if not most social issues. Sociologists are therefore likely to encounter the terminology of adjoining specialisms such as economics, psychology, and anthropology. For this reason the dictionary contains a number of entries that relate mainly to cognate disciplines but which will also be useful to the student of sociology. In recent years, dictionaries of sociology have included an increasing proportion of entries devoted to brief biographical sketches of contemporary practitioners of the discipline, although these often amount to little more than a date of birth, institutional affiliation, and short list of publications. The rationale for this practice is not at all obvious, since the dictionaries in question are intended to provide a guide to the content and terminology of the subject, rather than an annotated list of its proponents. 66\n\nMoreover, pilot research for this dictionary showed that it was in practice impossible to reach a consensus among one's peers as to who were the ‘leading contemporary sociologists’, partly because of the diversity of the subject itself. The dictionary therefore includes ‘names’ only in those cases where the individuals concerned have themselves become sociological subjects—mostly because of their influence upon the subsequent history of the discipline. A further criterion is that living authorities have been excluded. Entries will therefore be found under, for example, ‘Weber, Max’ and ‘Goffman, Erving’, but not ‘Merton, Robert K.’ or ‘Goldthorpe, John H.’ Arguably, this excludes from consideration a number of contemporary sociologists, the corpus of whose work has already become a subject for study within the discipline. Anthony Giddens, Jürgen Habermas, and Pierre Bourdieu are obvious examples. Some readers may think this makes only biological but not intellectual sense. In practice, however, the inclusion of any living sociologists as subjects merely reintroduces irresolvable disputes about who, among the current generation, are sufficiently influential—or controversial—to constitute proper ‘topics’ for inclusion. Naturally, the work of all these writers is here discussed in the context of wider substantive entries, as for example under the headings of critical theory (Habermas), anomie (Merton), and social mobility (Goldthorpe). All the contributors to the dictionary were, at the time of its inception, on the staff of the Department of Sociology at the University of Essex, Colchester, UK. The fact that many have since moved on is entirely coincidental.\n\n67\n\nPreface to the second edition For this edition I have revised and expanded much of the original text. More than 150 new entries—including several substantial essays—have been added. As a result the new volume is some 45 000 words longer than its predecessor. I have also corrected a few minor errors drawn to my attention by users of the dictionary. I should therefore like to take this opportunity for thanking the many readers who wrote either to me or to Oxford University Press, often with helpful suggestions for improvements, sometimes merely to express their admiration for the finished product. One correspondent from India proposed the inclusion of a consolidated bibliography, but I am not persuaded that this is as useful to students as is my current practice of citing appropriate references in the context of individual entries, so in this matter the format of the earlier edition has been retained. Nor—having read more about the subject—can I agree with the late Professor Hans Eysenck, who took the trouble to send a thoughtful letter explaining why he felt at least one of the entries gave an unbalanced account of the evidence for and against genetic differences in human behaviour, although the discussion of ‘intelligence’ has been extended to include some of the more recent (and still controversial) literature on this topic. Once again I have been the major contributor of entries, although several friends and former colleagues at the Department of Sociology of the University of Essex were kind enough to pen specialist pieces for this new edition: Tony Coxon, Ian Craib, Diana Gittins, Catherine Hakim, Maggy Lee, Sean Nixon, and Nigel South. The dictionary has been greatly improved by their entries and advice. Any remaining deficiencies are entirely my own responsibility. Oxford 1997\n\n68\n\nPreface to the third edition The third edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Sociology sees a change of editor but, I hope, not a change of style or approach. In editing the dictionary I have sought to retain the strong and distinctive style established by Gordon Marshall that has made it the leading reference book in its field. I have gone through every entry in the dictionary and have modified entries to reflect current concerns and to update their content. In doing so, I have deleted some of the less useful entries or have incorporated their content into other parts of the dictionary. Some existing entries have been completely rewritten. In introducing new entries to the dictionary I have sought to increase the coverage of topics that have increased in importance since the initial planning of the dictionary. The dictionary has, as a result, grown considerably in length. I have begun to introduce some biographical entries on living sociologists. There is not enough space for a comprehensive coverage of contemporary theorists and researchers, so I have concentrated on those who figure centrally in the areas covered in the dictionary. I hope that it will be possible to expand this coverage in future editions of the dictionary. I owe a great debt to the massive amount of work undertaken by Gordon Marshall in securing the core entries of the dictionary for the first two editions. His efforts have made my task that much easier. I have relied considerably on colleagues at the University of Essex for many of the new entries, but am also grateful to colleagues elsewhere who have provided new or updated entries. In addition to those entries that I produced myself, draft entries for this third edition of the dictionary were supplied by Eamonn Carrabine, Bob Connell, Tony Coxon, Miriam Glucksmann, Johs Hjellebrekke, Paul Iganski, Stina Lyon, David McCrone, Alison Pilnick, Lucinda Platt, Ken Plummer, Nirmal Puwar, David Rose, Susie Scott, Sanjay Sharma, Nigel South, Liz Stanley, Rob Stones, Tiziana Terranova, and Frank Webster. John Scott University of Essex 2004\n\n69\n\nPreface to the third edition revised This new edition of the dictionary now includes Internet links to online sources of information, available through the Oxford University Press dedicated website. I have concentrated on supplying the links for the most important and most authoritative sources of further information available on the Internet. A number of these sources are general links to specialized providers of information, and all Internet sources need to be treated with caution. The sites have been chosen to provide the most reliable and impartial information appropriate to the dictionary. John Scott University of Essex 2008\n\n70\n\nPreface to the fourth edition The Oxford Dictionary of Sociology has grown in scope and coverage since its first edition twenty years ago. First Gordon Marshall, then the two of us together, and finally I alone have included a wider range of topics, added more living sociologists, and sought to improve its style and usability. A major innovation for the revision to the third edition was the use of internet links that related the Dictionary to its online partner and allows a direct click-through to carefully selected sites that are known to be reliable. This innovation has been retained in the present edition. As more and more material becomes available online it is more than ever useful to have a reliable guide to these sources. I have sought to ensure that the links are up-to-date but the publishers would be grateful for any comments on difficulties in using these sites so that the links can be rectified as soon as possible. Please also let us know the sites that you have found especially useful and that you think might be shared with other users of the Dictionary. A significant change in this issue is that a number of the less used, very technical entries have been shortened or deleted to allow a number of new entries to be included and for coverage of newer areas to be expanded, such as intersectionality, Islamophobia, climate change, and social media, as well as new biographical entries on figures such as bel hooks, Ann Oakley, Stanley Cohen, and Randall Collins. I hope that you will find this change useful. The Dictionary includes many cross references indicated by an in-text asterisk marker (in the print edition) and a list of ‘See also’ sources. These are important ways of finding material and readers are encouraged to follow these in the same way that you might follow an online link on a web page: indeed, the online version allows you to do exactly this. If you do find ‘missing’ entries that you think a future edition should include, the publishers would again be glad to hear any suggestions. The Dictionary is a reference source, but I hope that you will also find it readable. I hope that you will get much pleasure and value from simply browsing the entries and following the links.

Intute is a collection of online resources for all the disciplines of the social sciences, and by following the links you can find articles and papers, datasets, books, journals and organizations related to your area of interest. It is an archive and is no longer being updated. British Sociological Association (BSA) The BSA is the main professional association for sociologists in the UK, and aims to provide information and services for its members. It is worth visiting this site to acquire an understanding of the nature of sociology and how the discipline is different from others in the social sciences. The BSA organizes conferences and workshops to bring together sociologists throughout the world, and publishes two major journals which may be familiar to you. Students can join the BSA for a reduced rate and enjoy all the benefits of membership. theory.org An entertaining introduction to contemporary social theory, written by David Gauntlett at the University of Leeds. A very accessible site showing the basics of some of the more innovative and unconventional theories. SocioSite, University of Amsterdam This site lists a number of sociologists and their main ideas, including excerpts from the original texts. Social Theory Pages A very helpful page of links to websites about the key thinkers, prepared by Jim Spickard at the University of Redlands. It includes links to resources on both classic and contemporary theory, as well as to some other major sites such as SocioSite. UK Data Service The UK Data Archive, housed at the University of Essex, contains a wider 75\n\nselection of quantitative data from social science research. You can browse the catalogue to find abstracts and methodological details of each study, and registered users can order a copy of the original data sets. There is also a bank of data from the major national surveys, including the British Crime Survey and the Social Attitudes Survey. The Service also includes the Qualidata archive that collects and disseminates qualitative data from a wide range of research projects. You can use the ‘Qualicat’ catalogue to search for data on a particular topic, or locate datasets from some of the classic studies in sociology. Social Research Update Another online store of articles about research methods, published and maintained by the Department of Sociology at the University of Surrey. The articles are relatively short, and the website is easy to navigate. It contains accounts of new and less conventional methods, such as visual ethnography and Internet-based research, alongside a number of other substantive issues in methodology.\n\n76\n\nability The power to perform a mental or physical task—either before or after training. Social psychologists usually distinguish ability from aptitude, the natural capacity to acquire or learn a body of knowledge as measured in an aptitude test. Sociologists would probably distinguish ability and *skill, the former being relatively specialized and task-specific, the latter referring to a wider set of learned techniques that can be applied to a number of cognate tasks. abolitionism A term originally associated with a call for the abolition of slavery on the grounds of its inhumanity (see, for example, the arguments of William Wilberforce, 1759–1833). More recently extended to arguments for the abolition of prisons and imprisonment. The latter stance developed within Scandinavian criminology (see T. Mathiesen, The Politics of Abolition, 1974) but has since been taken up within wider *critical criminology. Abolitionists argue that prisons are ineffective, their justification untenable, and their violations of human rights widespread. The abolitionist stance rejects mere reform on the grounds that this perpetuates and legitimates the existing system. Abolitionism proposes new responses to crime, offending, and disputes—for example community-based alternatives to incarceration—and argues that the urge to punish and inflict pain must be challenged. absolute deprivation See DEPRIVATION. absolute mobility See MOBILITY, SOCIAL. absolute poverty See POVERTY. absolutism (absolutist state) A strong and centralized form of state typical of societies in the process of transition from *feudalism to *capitalism and in which power is concentrated in the person of a monarch 77\n\nwho has at his or her disposal a centralized administrative apparatus. The label has been applied to a wide variety of *states, ranging from 16thcentury Tudor England to 19th-century Meiji Japan. This definition is not uncontroversial: the label has also been applied to Tsarist Russia, where the transition was from feudalism to *communism, and some would deny that Japan was ever a feudal society in anything other than the loosest sense. A useful overview can be found in Perry Anderson's Lineages of the Absolute State (1974). There has also been great controversy over the role that absolutist states played in the transition to capitalism. Many historians have seen the absolutist state as preparing the way for capitalism and have sometimes preferred the term ‘enlightened despotism’. (Others, however, have limited this term to the promotion of Enlightenment rationalism in states such as Prussia and Austria. Most Marxists have (at least until relatively recently) tended to see absolutism as an obstacle to the development of capitalism. The problem that both parties to this dispute have had to address is the variability in the historical outcomes. Within continental Europe, for example, the rise of absolutist states appears to have been associated with both a rapid transition to capitalism in the West, and an intensification of feudal domination in the East. For Max *Weber (General Economic History, 1919–20) and for nonMarxist scholars more generally, an explanation for the progressive role played by the absolutist or ‘rational state’ can be found in the immense contribution that these regimes made to the increasing predictability of action within their territories as they bureaucratized their own administrations, introduced elements of the rule of law, monopolized the legitimate use of force, and used this force to extend their jurisdiction throughout society. Weber's response to the divergent outcomes of absolutism in Eastern and Western Europe was to portray what happened in the East as a delay rather than a regression, and to explain it as the result of the state's lack of allies in the wider society, which in turn reflected the more general economic and cultural backwardness of these societies. The response of Marxists (such as Maurice Dobb, Eric Hobsbawm, and Perry Anderson) to this line of argument, has been to suggest that it owes more to the tendency amongst non-Marxists to accord analytical privilege to the political realm, than it does to sound historical research. Given that the absolute monarchs and their most powerful supporters were always representatives of the feudal nobility, so Marxists have argued, it is the short-lived absolutisms of Western Europe (and especially of England and Holland) that require explanation, rather than the long-lasting ones of the 78\n\nEast. The explanation that they provide revolves around the bold and controversial claim that the majority of continental states experienced a prolonged economic crisis during the 16th century, a crisis from which England and Holland were spared. As a result, the feudal nobility in every society except those two was able to crush or constrain its capitalist rivals. For this reason, it was possible for the bourgeois classes of England and Holland to gain an early advantage over their potential competitors, an advantage that they enhanced still further by overturning their absolute monarchies in relatively short order. Putting to one side the many empirical objections that this thesis has encountered, it is important to note that it rests on an analytical privileging of the economic realm that is arguably no more justified than the privileging of the political realm to which its proponents have rightly objected. Perhaps the most successful exception to both strictures is A. Lublinskaya's, French Absolutism: The Crucial Phase, 1620–1629 (1968). abstracted empiricism A term coined by C. Wright Mills in The Sociological Imagination (1959) to refer to the work of those sociologists who equate a strong and rigid *empiricism with science and make a fetish of survey-generated numerical data and quantitative research techniques. Mills saw this as having become the dominant style of social research in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s. It is empirical research abstracted from theoretical reflection. While Mills recognized the importance of empirical data, including numerical data and statistical analysis, in sociological work, he insisted that they are not sufficient for sociological analysis. Sociological accounts must always be theoretically informed. Mills held that *surveys, in particular, tend to restrict data to those concerning individuals and their attributes and so make it difficult to conceive of social *structure or to undertake comparative historical analyses. A fascinating historical account of the origins of abstracted empiricism will be found R. Bannister, Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880–1949 (1987). accommodation See ASSIMILATION. accounts See VOCABULARIES OF MOTIVE. acculturation See ASSIMILATION. accumulation See CAPITAL ACCUMULATION.\n\n79\n\nacephalous A term used to describe the political system of societies without centralized state authority—such as, for example, traditional African lineage political systems (see J. Middleton and D. Tait, Tribes without Rulers, 1958). Authority is wielded at the level of the clan, lineage, or lineage segment. For this reason these ‘headless’ societies are often referred to by the alternative term ‘segmented’. achieved status See STATUS, ACHIEVED. achievement The successful accomplishment or performance of a socially defined task or goal. Talcott *Parsons (in Social Theory and Modern Society, 1967) suggests that modern societies use indices of achievement —examination credentials or success in role-based tasks—rather than ascriptive criteria to recruit, select, and evaluate individuals for particular *roles. However, research demonstrates the continued influence of *ascription in social *stratification, notably in relation to such factors as race and sex. There is an interesting cross-disciplinary discussion of the concept and interpretation of achievement, its relationship to creativity and innovation, and its role in explaining economic growth in England and Japan since the 17th century, in Penelope Gouk (ed.), Wellsprings of Achievement (1995). See also ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION; MERITOCRACY; STATUS, ACHIEVED. achievement motivation Defined as the need to perform well or the striving for success, and evidenced by persistence and effort in the face of difficulties, achievement motivation is regarded as a central human motivation. Psychologist David McClelland (The Achieving Society, 1961) controversially hypothesized that it was related to economic growth and, for a period during the 1950s and 1960s, a lack of achievement motivation was widely proposed as explanation for the lack of economic development in the Third World. This was most notable among certain American *modernization theorists, and their thesis was much criticized by *dependency theorists such as Andre Gunder Frank (Latin America: Underdevelopment or Revolution, 1969). See also WORK ETHIC. act (action, social act) See MAX.\n\nACTION THEORY; MEANING;\n\nPARSONS; WEBER,\n\nactionalism A term generally associated with the name of French sociologist Alain Touraine, and not to be confused with the ‘action frame of reference’ (see ACTION THEORY) proposed by Talcott Parsons. Beginning 80\n\nin the 1960s, Touraine developed a radical new theoretical framework, most fully described in The Self-Production of Society (1973). In his own words, Touraine aimed to ‘replace a sociology of society with a sociology of actors’. His purpose was to overcome what he saw as a false division in sociology between objective and subjective, or system and action approaches. Actionalism places the social actor at the centre of theoretical attention, including theories of structural and historical phenomena. Actors are not simply the components of social systems, but the agents of those systems. Groups and collectivities such as social classes are treated not as mere categories but as dynamic sets of relationships among social actors. This dynamic aspect of actionalism is what Touraine calls historicity (a term adapted from Jean-Paul *Sartre) and referring to the ability of a society to act on itself, and the quality of history as a human activity. The sociologist is an agent of historicity—not a neutral observer—and has a stake in the conflicts of his or her society. This led Touraine to the method of ‘*sociological interventionism’, in which sociologists study social change movements by participating in them directly. An actionalist sociology, Touraine believes, is diverse and full of conflicts, but is more legitimate because of its active engagement in social change processes. In concrete terms, the actionalist approach attempts to explain how social values are shaped, and thus how social *change is accomplished, by identifying in each historical epoch the ‘historical subject’ (collective actor) that carries the capacity for accomplishing revolutionary change by organizing itself into a *social movement. In his earlier studies, Touraine argued that historical subjects attain the necessary self-awareness through the experience of productive work, seeing the key social movement expressing the historical subject of capitalism as organized labour. However, in later studies he broadened his conception of ‘production’ and extended the theory to other social movements, including those organized by women, students, nuclear protesters, and nationalists. Touraine's analysis of social movements can be found in his The Voice and the Eye (1978). action frame of reference See ACTION THEORY. action research A type of research in which the researcher is also a change agent. It is often used in local communities or by consultants working in companies, as part of the change process itself. The research subjects are invited to participate at various stages of a relatively fast81\n\nmoving sequence of research-action-research-action. There is an iterative process of investigating a problem, using *case-study methods, loosely defined; presenting the analysis, with one or more proposed solutions, to the subjects or group leaders; deciding which course of action to follow and implementing it; followed by further investigations to assess the outcomes and identify unanticipated problems and possible solutions to them; and finally followed by further action to refine and extend the new policies or activities. The process can be extended indefinitely, as the original focus of concern gradually moves to other related areas. The British community development programmes of the 1970s are an interesting example (see particularly the Coventry CDP Final Report, 1975). action theory (action frame of reference) These terms are not interchangeable but are closely related and carry a number of implications about the way we regard sociology as a science. It has been common, for example, to juxtapose action to structure as alternative starting-points for sociological investigation. Action theories are those that start from or see the major object for sociology as human action. A defining quality of action is that, unlike behaviour, it carries a subjective meaning for the actor. These approaches, therefore, concern themselves with the *meaning of action and its *interpretation. Sociology gives a rational, coherent account of people's actions, thoughts, and relationships. Action theories include Weberian sociology, phenomenological sociology, symbolic interactionism, ethnomethodology, rational choice theory, and structuration theory (all of which are dealt with under separate headings in this dictionary). The action frame of reference is associated with the name of Talcott *Parsons, whose theory starts with a systematic analysis of action that sees the social actor as choosing between different means and ends, in an environment which limits choice both physically and socially. The most important social limitations on choice are *norms and *values. From this, Parsons built up an elaborate model of the *social system, and his theory stressed the determining role of norms and values rather more than the choosing actor. Critics of Parsons such as John *Rex (Key Problems of Sociological Theory, 1962) have rejected this view but have retained the underlying action frame of reference as the basis of their own action theories. Action theories in contemporary sociology have raised three different concerns. First is the nature of *rationality and rational action itself. This 82\n\narises from of Weber's work and poses questions about the possibility of causal explanations of action. (Are the reasons for doing something a cause in the same way that heating a piece of metal causes it to expand?) It also addresses the issue of whether there are any absolute criteria of rationality, or whether sociological explanations are always in some sense culturally relative. *Rational choice theory takes up some of these problems in a more substantive way. The second concern is the taken-forgranted rules and stock of knowledge that underlie action—a theme pursued notably by ethnomethodology and phenomenology. The third, addressed by symbolic interactionism, is the learning and negotiation of *meaning that goes on between actors. Many important approaches are reviewed in Ira Cohen, ‘Theories of Action and Praxis’ in Turner (ed.), The Blackwell Companion to Social Theory (2000). actor (social actor) See ACTION THEORY; AGENCY; SELF; SUBJECT. adaptation A term widely used in evolutionary theory to describe the outcome of the process of natural selection. Genetic variations in biological species are seen as selected on the basis of their capacity to promote or inhibit survival in a particular environment. Those variations that allow a species to survive do so by allowing them to adapt to the pressures and opportunities of their particular environment. In much social *evolutionism a similar approach was adopted, with cultural innovations being seen as the objects of environmental selection and as the means through which social groups may be able to adapt to their physical and social environment. Talcott *Parsons took adaptation as one of the four functional prerequisites of any system of action—the others were goal attainment, *integration, and latency, forming the so-called AGIL scheme. See also FUNCTIONALISM. Addams, Jane (1860–1935) Addams was an American sociologist of central importance to the work of the *Chicago School in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A powerful influence on many other women in sociology, such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Emily Greene Balch, in 1889 she set up a social settlement in Chicago, Hull House to support social work and community activities. This was partly inspired by London's Toynbee Hall, but was more woman-influenced, more egalitarian, and less religious. Addams argued that one of the main problems for women was trying to manage the conflicting demands of family and society, and she believed social settlements were one way to 83\n\nresolve the problem. Hull House was an important sociological centre for the University of Chicago, and also attracted other leading social theorists, Marxists, anarchists, and socialists. A spokeswoman for women and working-class immigrants in particular, Addams was a cultural feminist who saw female values as inherently superior to those of men, and argued that a more productive and more peaceful society could be built by drawing on, and integrating, such values. Her commitment to pacifism made her a social pariah during the First World War, although in 1931 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. See Emily Cooper Johnson (ed.), Jane Addams: A Centennial Reader (1960), and Mary Jo Deegan, Jane Addams and the Men of the Chicago School (1989). http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=00027162(189905)13%3C33%3AAFOTSS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K • A classic article by Jane Addams on the idea of the social settlement: ‘A Function of the Social Settlement.’ (Subscription) addiction See DRINKING AND ALCOHOLISM; DRUGS. administrative theory (classical administrative theory) An early form of *organization theory, pioneered mainly by Henri Fayol (1841–1925) in his Administration industrielle et générale, 1916), which was concerned principally with achieving the ‘most rational’ organization for coordinating the various tasks specified within a complex *division of labour. The translation of this book into English as General and Industrial Management (1949) implies that Fayol was concerned mainly with business management, although he himself made it clear that his ideas about management were intended to apply to all formal organizations, including political and religious undertakings. Expressing the French ‘administration’ as ‘management’ has also led to the alternative designation of this approach as the ‘classical school of scientific management’, more recent exponents of which include Lyndall Urwick and Peter F. Drucker. Fayol identified the key functions of management as those of forecasting and planning. The most rational and efficient organizations were, in his view, those that implemented plans that facilitated ‘unity, continuity, flexibility, precision, command and control’. Universal principles of administration could be distilled from these objectives. These include the key elements of the scalar chain (authority and responsibility flowing in an unbroken line from the chief executive to the shop floor); unity of command (each person has only one supervisor with whom he or 84\n\nshe communicates); a pyramid of prescribed control (first-line supervisors have a limited number of functions and subordinates, with second-line supervisors controlling a prescribed number of first-line supervisors, and so on up to the chief executive); unity of direction (people engaged in similar activities must pursue a common objective in line with the overall plan); specialization of tasks (allowing individuals to build up a specific expertise and so be more productive); and, finally, subordination of individual interests to the general interest of the organization. This list is not exhaustive, but illustrates the key proposition of administrative theory, which is that a functionally specific and hierarchical structure offers the most efficient means of securing organizational objectives (see M. B. Brodie, Fayol on Administration, 1967). Classical administrative theory, like its near-contemporary the *scientific management approach, rests on the premise that organizations are unproblematically rational and (effectively) closed systems. In other words, organizations are assumed to have unambiguous and unitary objectives that the individuals within them pursue routinely by obeying the rules and fulfilling their role expectations according to the prescribed blueprint and structure. Moreover, in the attempt to maximize efficiency, it is only variables within that structure that need to be considered and manipulated. The interaction of the organization with its environment, together with the various factors that are external to the organization but nevertheless have consequences for its internal functioning, are systematically ignored. Clearly, both perspectives take a rather deterministic view of social action, since each assumes that individuals will maximize organizational efficiency, independently of their own welfare, and with no thought for the relationship between the collective goal and their own particular purposes. *Human Relations Theory in organizational analysis, an otherwise diverse group of writers and approaches, is united by its opposition to precisely this assumption. Despite such criticisms, the classical theory of administration has exerted considerable influence on the fields of business studies and public administration, and it still provides the basic concepts that many managers use in clarifying their objectives. adolescence First introduced as a concept in social psychology by G. Stanley Hall (in Adolescence, 1904). The term has been used to refer to the emotional and behavioural states supposedly associated with becoming adult; the phase in the *life-cycle before the physical changes associated with puberty are socially recognized; and the transition in status from 85\n\nchildhood to adulthood. Typically, in modern industrial societies, young people are sexually mature well before society acknowledges them as adults in other respects; and, because of education and training, they remain dependent on parents and guardians. Consequently, adolescence has been seen as a time of peak emotional turbulence (see J. S. *Coleman, The Nature of Adolescence, 1980). Sociologists do not see this as an exclusively biological process in which physical change itself brings about behavioural change. Rather, biological maturation is recognized as real but also as socially constructed in relation to social norms and values. This means that adolescence itself is a culturally relative condition. In the recent past in Europe children frequently had to move into adulthood as soon as they could do useful work and without passing through a stage of adolescence. Anthropologists too describe numerous examples (especially in *age-set societies) where the transition to adulthood is abrupt, marked by clear *rites of passage, and relatively free from alleged adolescent problems. Surveys and other field studies in the industrialized West itself have cast doubt on the ideas that adolescence is typically any more stressful than any other stage in life or that the majority of teenagers are rebellious. The treatment of adolescence as a social problem may say more about the stereotypes of youth in the adult world and indicate a *moral panic about *youth culture (see Frank Coffield et al., Growing Up at the Margins, 1986). For an overview of the literature see Patricia Noller and Victor Callan, The Adolescent in the Family (1991). Adorno, Theodor Wiesengrund (1903–69) A leading member of the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research, who worked in America during the Second World War, returning to West Germany after the allied victory. He was a man of immense learning, and complex, often obscure and difficult ideas. His work covered aesthetic theory, literary and musical theory, general cultural criticism, social psychology, and philosophy. A major work was (with numerous others) The Authoritarian Personality (1950), a (much criticized) empirical and theoretical investigation into the psychological roots of authoritarianism. With other members of the Frankfurt Institute he engaged critically with Marxism and sought to incorporate a sophisticated conception of culture and individual psychology into the revisionist strands of Marxism that were developed by such writers as *Lukács. His aesthetic and cultural criticism and his philosophy were concerned with form rather than content: the form of a work of art, or of a system of ideas, offered the clearest 86\n\ndemonstration of the limits and contradictions imposed upon us by society, as well as of the possibilities it offers. He particularly developed this idea in relation to music and wider trends in culture, where he saw a polarisation between artistic culture and the development of popular, mass culture and *mass society (see R. Witkin, Adorno on Music, 1998; Adorno on Popular Culture, 2002). His own difficult writing style was allegedly an attempt to avoid what he saw as the false integration of his ideas into modern industrial society. Perhaps the clearest statement of his view of modernity can be found in Minima Moralia (1951), a collection of aphorisms, which state that the notion of totality was once part of a liberating philosophy, but over the last century has been absorbed into a totalizing *social system, a real or potentially *totalitarian regime. For examples of his cultural criticism see Prisms (1955) and, with Max Horkheimer, The Culture Industry Revisited, ed. J. Bernstein (1992). Adorno's introductory lectures on sociology from 1968 have been published as Introduction to Sociology (published 2000).

Their studies seek to measure social problems with a view to heightening public awareness of them and providing a catalyst for policy proposals and other action to ameliorate the problem in question. Critics sometimes suggest that advocacy research studies bend their research methods in order to inflate the magnitude of the social problem described, and thereby enhance the case for public action to address the issue. See Neil Gilbert's article: ‘Advocacy Research and Social Policy’, Crime and Justice (1997). affect (affective, affectivity) An affect is an emotion. In sociology the use of the term generally implies that an action is being or has been carried out for emotional gratification. Affectivity versus affective neutrality is one of Talcott Parsons's so-called pattern variables for the classification and analysis of societies. This was used to explore the relationship between cognitive and emotional action orientations and social relations. For example, in their discussion of Class Awareness in the United States (1983), Mary R. Jackman and Robert W. Jackman discuss ‘affective class 87\n\nbonds’; namely, ‘the issue of whether subjective social class encompasses a feeling of emotional attachment’, rather than being merely a matter of nominal identification. See also AFFECTIVE INDIVIDUALISM. affective individualism A change in family life, said to have accompanied the demographic, industrial, and capitalist revolutions that occurred in 18th-century England, and has since been experienced widely in other modernized and modernizing countries. The term affective individualism describes the formation of *marriage ties on the basis of personal attraction, guided by norms of romantic attachment rather than being arranged by parents. A number of authorities (including L. Stone, The Family, Sex and Marriage in England, 1500–1800, 1977) have argued that the 18th century saw a revolution in familial norms. Hitherto, families (even nuclear *families) were deeply embedded in a wider network of community involvements (including close relationships with other kin), so that the family was not a major focus of emotional attachment and dependence for its members. Among other things, therefore, sex was instrumental (necessary to propagate children) rather than a source of pleasure; as indeed was marriage itself (which was undertaken for economic or political reasons, rather than feelings of romantic attraction). For reasons connected with *industrialization (the precise causality varies between accounts), this form of family life gave way rapidly to the ‘closed domesticated nuclear form’, characterized by intimate emotional or affective bonds, domestic privacy, a preoccupation with love and with the rearing of children for expressive rather than instrumental reasons. By extension, this process is said to have accompanied the spread of *capitalism and industrialization throughout the globe. The theory of affective individualism as an invention of modern societies has been strongly challenged—most notably by Alan Macfarlane (see The Culture of Capitalism, 1987)—mainly on the grounds that it posits as revolutionary a series of changes that were incremental and long pre-dated the processes of industrialization.

Age is also a cultural category and its meaning and significance vary both historically and cross-culturally. The sociology of ageing did not feature in standard sociology textbooks until recently. Like sex or gender, age tended to be seen as a purely ‘natural’ division, or else as a ‘problem’ reserved for social policy. By contrast, considerable sociological attention has been paid to *youth culture. In Western capitalism, a wage-labour system means fixed retirement from external production, thus categorizing the aged as non-productive, and a burden. In research priorities, *gerontology, with its medical model of ageing, has been influential. Sociological research in Britain has focused on the aged as isolates or in state institutions. Demographic changes—with increasing longevity, a declining birth-rate, and a greater proportion of the population over 65 in the West—have stimulated both a *moral panic and new interest in the consumer and political potential of the elderly. Stereotyping and an assumed homogeneity among the aged are to be challenged. Class, race, and gender, as well as culture, counter biological factors. For example, old age is not perceived as an impediment for males with supreme political power in either communist or capitalist states. In numerous articles on the social relations of old people, Ethel Shanas has criticized what has been termed the acquiescent functionalism of much writing on ageing and the family life of the elderly, a tradition which legitimates *ageism by excluding the elderly from the *labour market and other significant social *roles. By contrast, Shanas's own research seems to demonstrate that ageing is a process of *deprivation, leading to what has been called ‘structured dependency’ (see Shanas et al., Old People in Three Industrialised Societies, 1968, and Shanas and M. B. Sussman (eds.), Family, Bureaucracy and the Elderly, 1977). There is growing research interest in this field, not only in the experience and ethnography of the aged, but also in the specific constructions of ‘old age’ across cultures and through time (see, for example, M. W. Riley, ‘On the Significance of Age in Sociology’, American Sociological Review, 1987). http://www.sociosite.net/topics/aging.php • A portal site with links to numerous sites on aspects of ageing. 89\n\nageism Discrimination, or the holding of irrational and prejudicial views about individuals or groups, based on their age. It involves *stereotypical assumptions about a person's or group's physical or mental capacities and is often associated with derogatory language. These are most commonly applied to the elderly. Organizations such as the Grey Panthers have emerged in the United States to combat *discrimination against the elderly and to fight for their *rights. age sets (age grades) Broad age-bands that define the social *status, permitted *roles, and activities of those belonging to them and that include all the members of the society in the particular age category. Transitions from one age grade to the next are often major collectively organized social events with *rites of passage marking the change of social status and role. Although the term has sometimes been applied in the modern industrial context, it is more commonly used in reference to pre-industrial societies where an age-grade system of stratification (dividing members into youths, maidens, elders, and so forth) is superimposed on the organizing tribal, lineage, or clan structure, and class differences do not exist. age stratification A system of inequalities linked to age that involves the formation of *age sets. As a form of *stratification, it is most usefully distinguished from mere inequality. In Western societies, for example, both the old and the young are perceived and treated as relatively incompetent and excluded from much social life as distinct statuses, but they do not comprise unified and cohesive social strata. See also AGEISM. agency The term agency is often juxtaposed to *structure and is often no more than a synonym for action, emphasizing implicitly the undetermined nature of human action, as opposed to the alleged determinism of structural theories. If it has a wider meaning, it is to draw attention to the psychological and social psychological make-up of the actor, and to imply the capacity for willed (voluntary) action. Sociological theories are often characterized by the relative emphasis they place on agency or structure—and in terms, therefore, of an agency versus structure debate. Some recent theorists have intervened in the debate in a conscious attempt to transcend this *dualism. The French sociologist Pierre *Bourdieu is a good example. His insistence that the objective and subjective aspects of social life are inescapably bound together leads him to challenge the dualism of macro versus micro and 90\n\nstructure versus agency (Outline of a Theory of Practice, 1977). Another writer to have addressed this issue is Anthony *Giddens in his theory of *structuration. Similarly, the American sociologist Jeffrey Alexander argues for a multidimensional sociology that brings together the two levels of analysis, most notably in his four-volume Theoretical Logic in Sociology (1984). See also ACTION THEORY; STRUCTURATION. aggregate Large collections of people may act as groups, with some degree of common purpose, but they may also act as non-organized aggregates. For example, an audience or crowd may be said to be an aggregate, in so far as its members lack any organization or persisting pattern of social relationships. The term is also used more broadly in reference to research or analysis that deals only with aggregate data, which consist of statistics produced for broad groups or categories (for example certain types of persons, households, or companies), and in which the characteristics of individual respondents (persons, households, or companies) are no longer identifiable. See also COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR; MICRODATA. aggregate data See AGGREGATE (COLLECTIVITY). aggression Acts of hostility, injury, violence, or extreme self-assertion. There are several competing theories as to why people may become aggressive. Many of these are biological. Thus, for example, the philosopher Thomas *Hobbes argued that people were by nature violent and avoided a ‘war of all against all’ only by considerable ingenuity and effort. Many schools of psychology share this assumption, and argue that aggression is obviated by exhaustive processes of education or *socialization, combined with a generous measure of *social control. That is, social learning is not sufficient, and people must be continually rewarded for their civilized behaviour and punished for unacceptably aggressive conduct. Most sociological theories of aggression root it not in the biological substructure or psychological superstructure of the individual, but in his or her relationship to the social environment. Probably the most popular of these is the so-called frustration-aggression hypothesis or theory, which states that aggressive behaviour results when purposeful activity is interrupted (see the classic statement in J. Dollard et al., Frustration and Aggression, 1939). Thus, for example, children may attack other children who take their toys from them. This theory has, however, been criticized 91\n\nfor its inability to explain the circumstances under which frustration leads to outcomes other than aggression. (Some children may simply sulk quietly under these circumstances.) The frustration-aggression thesis has also been identified with the earlier work of Sigmund *Freud, who argued that frustration—the blocking of pleasure-seeking or pain-avoiding activities—always leads to aggression, either towards the perceived source of interference, or (if inhibited) displaced onto another object. Freud later suggested that aggression was the product of a death instinct (called Thanatos) that operates alongside the life instinct that he called libido or Eros. A third group of theories—learning theories—view violence as the result of successful socialization and social control. That is, aggressive behaviour in general and violent behaviour in particular occur where they are expected, even in the absence of frustration. For example, members of a *subculture may learn to behave in accordance with *norms of violence which have been presented to them as socially desirable, as in cases where the use of force (such as fist-fighting) is associated with masculinity. Similarly, soldiers at the front in times of war and teenagers in a *gang may feel violence is acceptable and the done thing, because they have been brought up to believe this to be the case, expect to win approval and prestige if they fight well, and wish to avoid censure should they ‘chicken out’. See also DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION. agnate (agnation) In Roman law, agnati were a group of males and females who were related through a common ancestor, and thus came under a single family authority. The modern use in social anthropology relates to patrilineal (or male) descent, but the element of male authority has been lost. An agnate is thus a blood relative in the patrilineal (or male) line. Agnation refers to a kinship system in which relationship is traced exclusively through the male line. In current anthropological usage the term *patrilineal is preferred. agrarian capitalism See CAPITALISM. agrarianism Agrarian societies are those that combine horticulture and animal husbandry in systems of farming. Agrarianism also refers to the romanticization of the rural farm as the ideal place for family life. See also RURAL SOCIOLOGY. agreement, method of See MILL, JOHN STUART. 92\n\nagribusiness A large-scale *capitalist farming and food-processing organization and enterprise (producing fertilizers, pesticides, or machinery) that shares many characteristics of other advanced industries. These include, for example, the use of advanced science and technology, techniques of mass production, and extensive vertical and horizontal integration of processes and *corporations. Thus, for example, one might find a frozen-food corporation, having long-term contracts with an array of large farms, using computers to plan production of highly specialized produce to order, and being supplied with inorganic fertilizers and other materials by a company also owned by the food corporation. These are increasingly organized on a global scale and with a global division of labour. The effects of agribusiness in the United States are discussed in Richard Merrill (ed.), Radical Agriculture (1976) and Susan George, How the Other Half Dies (1976).

AIDS The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a complex of symptoms and ultimately deadly infections caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV). An initial period of high infectivity is followed after some three months by the appearance of HIV antibodies that signal a reaction to the HIV infection and on which the main tests for the condition are based. Following what are often years of symptom-free living, the body finally succumbs to what are normally rare and unusual diseases— especially PCP (Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia) and KS (Kaposi's Sarcoma). The main vehicles of transmission are the bodily fluids, especially blood (blood-transfusion, intravenous drug uses, and vertical transmission from mother to child) and semen, chiefly by means of penetrative sexual intercourse (homosexual or heterosexual). UNAIDS distinguishes three zones and patterns of infection: Asia (now the principal growth area of infection), the African continent (initial discovery and primarily heterosexual in form), and industrialized Western nations (where the pandemic was recognized and defined in the 1980s). In the West, transmission was primarily by homosexual intercourse, and intravenous drug needle-sharing, but transmission is now primarily heterosexual. By 2010 an estimated 39 m people had been infected by HIV (over a half of whom were women and two-thirds of whom were in Sub-Saharan Africa) and over 20 m had died in 20 years. Rapid advances in treatments now make the infection chronic rather than acute in the West, but they are expensive and rarely available where most needed outside the West. 93\n\nSociology has contributed in various ways to the understanding and control of AIDS/HIV infection. Studies of sexual networks of transmission were crucial for identifying the virus in 1982. It has also informed national and large-scale studies of sexual and drug-taking behaviour, both KABP (Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviour and Practices) and more innovative and qualitative research necessary to find out and monitor the prevalence and incidence of high-risk behaviour and risk-taking activity. Techniques to identify and sample ‘hidden populations’ such as non-gay-identified men who have sex with men and illegal drug-taking activity have depended chiefly on sociological and anthropological methodologies. Theories of risk-taking have also developed from early reliance on the Health Belief Model to contextual and strategic aspects and collective and community response. http://www.unaids.org/en/ • A United Nations site providing statistical and other information on HIV/AIDS. alcoholism See DRINKING AND ALCOHOLISM. alienation In the most general terms, this concept describes the estrangement of individuals from one another, or from a specific situation or process. It is central to the writings of Karl *Marx, and Marxists have explored the philosophical, sociological, and psychological dimensions to his argument. (These are most usefully expounded in Istvan Meszaros, Marx's Concept of Alienation, 1970, and John Torrance, Estrangement, Alienation and Exploitation, 1977.) Alienation as a philosophical concept has its roots in *Hegel. It was Hegel’s view of the movement of ideas through history and their externalization, objectification, and reappropriation in knowledge that provided Marx with his revolutionary imperative. Turning Hegel on his head and building a *materialist vision, Marx argued that labour defines the ‘species being’; the needs, powers, and potential of human beings. It is human labour power that is externalised and objectified in the form of material objects and social relations. This alienation of labour dehumanizes people and is reappropriated on a fully human basis only with the advent of *communism, which represents the complete return of individuals to themselves as social beings. This philosophical conception of alienation permeates Marx's writings, though there has been much debate over the extent to which his early concerns continued to shape his later arguments. However, sociological 94\n\ndiscussion of the term relates more to his argument that externalisation and estrangement are consequences of social structures that oppress people, denying them their essential humanity. Alienation is an objec"
