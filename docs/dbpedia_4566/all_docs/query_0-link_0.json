This is a collection of interviews with key figures in the generation of social semioticians who have taken Halliday’s concept of social semiotics and developed it further in various directions, making their own original contributions to theory and practice. This book highlights their main lines of thought and considers how they relate to both the original concept of social semiotics and to each other. Key themes include:\n\nLinguistic studies, multilinguality and evolution of language;\n\nText, discourse and classroom studies;\n\nDigital texts, computer communication and science teaching;\n\nMultimodal text- and discourse analysis;\n\nEducation and literacy;\n\nMedia work and visual and audio modes;\n\nCritical Discourse Analysis.\n\nFeaturing interviews with leading figures from linguistics, education and communication studies, a framing introduction and concluding chapter summing up commonalities and differences, connections and conflicts and key themes, this is essential reading for any scholar or student working in the area of social semiotics and systemic functional linguistics. Additional video resources are available on the Routledge website.\n\nFeaturing: Christian M.I.M. Matthiessen, Theo Van Leeuwen, James R.

Practical exercises and examples as wide ranging as furniture arrangements in public places and advertising jingles, provide readers with the knowledge and skills they need to be able to analyze and also produce successful multimodal texts and designs.\n\nThe book traces the development of semiotic resources through particular channels such as the history of the Press and advertising; and explores how and why these resources change over time, for reasons such as advancing technology.\n\nFeaturing a full glossary of terms, exercises, discussion points and suggestions for further reading, Introducing Social Semiotics makes concrete the complexities of meaning making and is essential reading for anyone interested in how communication works.\n\nSocial semiotics.\n\nHodge, Robert Ian Vere, and Gunther R. Kress.\n\nCornell University Press, 1988.\n\nSemiotics was defined by Ferdinand de Saussure as” the science of the life of signs in society.” Robert Hodge and Gunther Kress here confront the conceptual difficulties that have limited its growth as a field of inquiry and demonstrate how it can be integrated with the social analysis of power, ideology, gender, and class. Social Semiotics explores the many possibilities for semiotic analysis that are created by the assumption that signs and messages must always be situated within the context of social relations and processes. Approaching semiotics as an evolving theory, Hodge and Kress first review the work of theoretical founders, including Saussure, CS Peirce, I. Voloshinov, and Freud. They build on the legacy of Voloshinov, who linked semiotics with the study of ideology, and develop the implications of his assertion that the form of signs is determined not only by the social organization of the participants but also by the immediate conditions of their interaction. Showing how such an approach can illuminate key issues is literary theory and communications, the authors analyze messages ranging from literary texts, television, and billboards to social interactions at home and school.\n\nSocial Semiotics is a major new textbook in communication and cultural studies. It offers a comprehensive and original approach to the study of the ways in which meaning is constituted in social life.\n\nHodge and Kress begin from the assumption that signs and messages – the subject matter of semiotics – must always be situated within the context of social relations and processes. They then show what is involved in analysing different kinds of messages, from literary texts, TV programmes and billboards to social interactions in the family and the school. While presenting a judicious assessment of different perspectives, Hodge and Kress also develop their own distinctive and highly fruitful approach, demonstrating how semiotics can be integrated with the social analysis of power and ideology, space and time, and gender and class.\n\nSocial Semiotics is richly illustrated with examples and written in a clear style which does not presuppose prior knowledge of the field. It will become a key textbook for courses in communications, media and cultural studies and will be of general interest to students of sociology, literature and linguistics.\n\n“Language as social semiotic: The social interpretation of language and meaning.”\n\nHalliday, Michael Alexander Kirkwood.\n\n(1978).\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/journals/csos20\n\nSocial Semiotics is a peer reviewed journal that publishes high quality papers that deal with the study of semiotic resources and practices including words, images, behaviours, settings, sounds, design, etc., and the way these are connected to the organization of societies and everyday lives.\n\nArticles must focus on a specific semiotic phenomenon and embody, in their argument and conclusion, a critique of the limitations on and variations in the ways in which semiotic resources/practices may perpetuate biases, imbalance or legitimize and maintain kinds of power interests.\n\nSemiotic analysis in articles might draw on linguistic analysis, visual analysis, content analysis, ethnography, interviews, as well as production studies, and can be tied to political economy. The journal especially welcomes papers that analyse everyday phenomena and the sociopolitical significance of representations.\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nWikipedia\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_semiotics\n\nLogic as Semiotic: The Theory of Signs,\n\nPeirce, C.

From a social semiotic perspective, contexts are constituted by the communicative processes taking place in them, so that semiosis—the process of signification in all its complexity—becomes the main focus of research. Klaus Jensen’ s book is an attempt to lay the foundations for a methodologically rigorous social semiotics of the mass media. From Jensen’ s perspective, what’ s important in mass media research is not so much the meaning of media texts, nor the institutional conditions under which the media operate, but “the social and cultural practices that constitute [the] production, transmission, and reception [of media discourses]” (p. 38). Ultimately, what Jensen has in mind is research driven by a “minimalist concept of the politics of communication. The key issue may not be how to ensure the right to engage in dialogue, but how to develop the procedures for ending dialogue and transforming it into other forms of social action” (p. 180). From this position, what counts is not so much how mass media communication takes place, but how it gets transformed into social action.\n\nIn order to gain some sort of analytical purchase on this issue, Jensen turns to Peirce’ s semiotics as his base, and carefully works through a range of theoretical arguments in support of a social semiotics which emphasizes the pragmatic character of semiosis in different contexts of mass media reception. In the first three chapters, Jensen develops Peirce’ s semiotic model in terms of the familiar triad (sign /object /interpretant) leading to ceaseless semiosis as the condition of all communicative process. Jensen’ s aim is to replace the dualism of the Western Logos tradition (mind / body; form /content; signifier/signified) with a pragmatic realism which takes as its object the way in which meaning and social action are inextricably intertwined. Through the key concept of reflexivity borrowed from Giddens, Jensen is able to redraft Peirce’ s model so that it incorporates ceaseless semiosis into the institutional and structured contexts of everyday life, leading to a study of the “reception” of mass media content by audiences.\n\nThe use of Peirce helps legitimate the essentially scientific nature of Jensen’ s project which seeks knowledge of the “empirical audience”: “there would appear to be no way around the empirical audience…. If mass communication research is to contribute a critique of media in the interest of their audiences, it must develop methodologies that engage audiences in the process of reflexivity about the social purposes of the mass media” (p. 95). The Social Semiotics of Mass Communication proposes a qualitative research program as an alternative to quantitative research into mass media. Jensen rejects the reduction of social semiosis to essential types, roles, and functions found in quantitative research, and instead opts for a “thick” description of the polysemy of discourses in contexts of media reception (chap. 8). He develops a discourse analysis which “seeks to establish the meaning of linguistic features in their discursive context, giving priority to measures of contextual meaning over measures of recurrence” (p. 99). This places Jensen’ s work firmly in opposition to research which attempts to gain objective knowledge of audiences, based on representativeness and generalizability of data. The advantage of this qualitative approach is that it provides descriptive insight into the concrete processes of discursive practices as they are likely to transform into social action in any given context, which accords with Jensen’ s desire to develop a political dimension to reception studies.\n\nIn his rejection of both quantitative research and text-based interpretation of media discourse, Jensen aligns himself with the television audience ethnography of Morley, Silverstone, Lull, Radway, and others during the 1980s which sought to define the classed and gendered basis for television audienceship. However, Jensen avoids the fundamental weakness of this cultural studies approach—its lack of methodological reflexivity in analyzing data—by proposing that data be analyzed as a discursive construct, and not as a direct representation of audience subjectivity. This “linguistic turn” is a promising move, foreshadowed in many critiques of television audience ethnography, but yet to be delivered in any empirical studies. Unfortunately Jensen also fails to deliver any extended research into audiences. His only attempts in this book are less than satisfying; there are some interviews with groups of academics and university workers, and a rather curious case of misreading by an elderly woman which provides insight into one of the many theoretical conundrums raised by Jensen. None of these excursions into the audience’ s domain really satisfies the standards of methodological and theoretical rigour which is obtained everywhere else in his book.\n\nBut I should not insist that Jensen’ s book be something that it was not designed to be. Jensen is not “doing” media research, but attempting to clear the ground for such work to take place. I have found some of his ideas insightful and challenging. For instance, Peirce’ s notion of abductive reasoning is developed by Jensen in interesting ways which might just prove useful for the discursive analysis of research data. In qualitative research based on interviews and focus groups, the problem faced by audience researchers is: what status does the data have with respect to the experience to which the information given by the research participants attests? Abduction is the commonsensical way in which people reconstitute the logic of events out of any information at hand. It might well prove useful to analyze the processes of abduction which take place within a research setting, thereby seeking to find the ways in which research participants as well as researchers “recontextualize” themselves as audience members. This kind of reflexive analysis is already done by ethnomethodology, and it is surprising that Jensen has ignored this line of sociological research.\n\nOverall, The Social Semiotics of Mass Communication is a challenging attempt to provide a theoretical basis for qualitative research into mass media audiences. There are, however, some difficulties with Jensen’ s approach. I found his syncretic treatment of issues, theories, and concepts a little too fragmenting and contradictory in places. It was difficult to see how some of the many theoretical positions Jensen manages to cram into his book, including Rorty, Habermas, Giddens, Thom, Eco, and Wittgenstein to name a few, are in any way compatible. For instance, Jensen uses cognitive psychology at one point to underwrite discourse analysis of research data (chap. 10). However, the project of cognitive psychology is to find a biological basis for the categories of meaning found in social use, thereby repressing the linguistic and discursive elements of its own undertaking. As Jensen himself has argued, discourse analysis of the contexts of reception would need to avoid abstracting data into various essentialized categories; otherwise, it risks universalizing reception into a series of predictable behaviours and attitudes, thereby losing sight of the transformational processes within contexts of communication. Another problem concerns the undeveloped relationship between the systematicity of semiosis—its intertextual connectedness to all possible signs—and social action. After considerable discussion of semiotic difference in Chapter 10, for instance, it is still not clear how Jensen gets beyond the study of sign systems in themselves (semiotics) to a study of the systematicity of signification as social action (social semiotics).\n\nNevertheless, Jensen’ s book offers a number of valuable theoretical and methodological tools for anyone wanting to develop ethnographic and qualitative research into media audiences, providing many useful ways forward, as well as many insights into the philosophical underpinnings of communication research as it relates to the media in social context.\n\nAdvancing Multimodal and Critical Discourse Studies\n\nInterdisciplinary Research Inspired by Theo Van Leeuwen’s Social Semiotics\n\nEdited BySumin Zhao, Emilia Djonov, Anders Björkvall, Morten Boeriis\n\nEdition 1st Edition First Published 2017\n\neBook Published 22 September 2017\n\nPub.

Chapter 1 provides a fully up-to-date introduction to the theory (while peculiar aspects of the theory will be dealt with in subsequent chapters when they become relevant for discussion and application to the data), and argues that social semiotics serves as a useful multidisciplinary framework for analysing text-image relations. With an aim to contributing to the existing monographs of empirical social semiotic analysis in the fields of education and humanities, this chapter argues for focussing the analytical lens on visual analysis in other major areas of impactful social research which could provide a nuanced view of semiotic resources and principles pertaining to visual imagery and text as the most prominent modes of communication in contemporary society before identifying and describing the resources and principles that operate within and across other modes.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.\n\nNotes\n\n1.A similar approach is presented by Jewitt and Oyama (2001: 138), who contend that “[i]n studies of the use of semiotic resources, visual social semiotics can only ever be one element of an interdisciplinary equation which must also involve relevant theories and histories”. Hence in the present project I integrate visual social semiotics with theoretical categories and propositions that reside in various disciplines in arts and social sciences.\n\n2.The difference between Bateman’s (2014) work and the present volume lies in the fact that the former is intended to be a textbook introducing a wide range of perspectives on text-image relations whereas there is a clear research agenda in the latter. This book aims to deal with the study of communicational practices through words and images and the way in which they are connected to the organisation of societies and everyday lives. It sets out to address the central and pivotal research question: ‘how do texts and imagery reflect and conceal specific interests, power relations and communicative strategies in specific institutional or social contexts?’, providing analyses that illuminate the everyday and the socio-political significance of representations.\n\nReferences\n\nBateman, John. 2014.

The conception of fourth-order systems as systems of meaning is embodied in social semiotics, and the conception of them as knowledge is embodied in cognitive science. Biological systems and physical systems are both systems of matter, and social semioticians have begun to investigate the semiotic affordance of materiality, for example Kress, as in the study of design, which involves ‘making meaning material’, as Kress puts it. Halliday introduced the notion of language as social semiotic in a collection of essays written between 1972 and 1976, as part of his ongoing development of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). Halliday’s book, Language as Social Semiotic or LASS, became the source of the development of social semiotics in and around linguistics, including off-shoots in critical, cultural and multimodal studies.\n\nSocial Semiotics\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nDOI:10.1075/hop.13.soc5\n\nIn book: Handbook of Pragmatics: 2009 Installment.

The book explains Fichte’s notion of subjectivity and how his particular view developed out of Kant’s accounts of theoretical and practical reason. Fichte argued that the subject has a self-positing structure which distinguishes it from a thing or an object. Thus, the subject must be understood as an activity rather than a thing and is self-constituting in a way that an object is not. In the final chapter, Professor Neuhouser considers how this doctrine of the self-positing subject enables us to understand the possibility of the self’s autonomy, or self-determination.\n\nIntersubjectivity\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity\n\nSelf models\n\nhttp://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Self_models\n\nHusserl: Intersubjectivity\n\nhttps://philpapers.org/browse/husserl-intersubjectivity\n\nThe Identities of Persons (Topics in Philosophy) (Volume 3)\n\nby Amélie Oksenberg Rorty\n\nUniversity of California Press (November 15, 1976)\n\nLanguage ‏ : ‎ English\n\nPaperback ‏ : ‎ 340 pages\n\nISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 9780520033092\n\nISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0520033092\n\nMerleau-Ponty: The Self as Embodied Subjectivity\n\nConsciousness, Higher-Order Theories of,\n\nBrown, Richard.\n\n2019, doi:10.4324/9780415249126-V051-1.\n\nRoutledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Taylor and Francis,\n\nhttps://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/consciousness-higher-order-theories-of/v-1.\n\nArticle Summary\n\nHigher-order theories are theories of phenomenal consciousness. Phenomenal consciousness is the property of there being something that it is like for one to have an experience. Something that it is like from the point of view of the organism. According to the higher-order approach, an organism is phenomenally conscious just in case it has an appropriate kind of inner awareness of itself as being in some mental state or other. So, when one consciously believes that Kentucky is south New York one is aware of oneself as believing that Kentucky is south of New York. Similarly, when one consciously sees red, or experiences fear, one is aware of oneself as seeing red or being afraid.\n\nThe relevant kind of inner awareness is what distinguishes the various kinds of higher-order theories. One might think that the right kind of inner awareness would be a kind of inner perception. Yet contemporary psychology and neuroscience do not seem to support the idea of a kind of inner sense. We do, in addition, become aware of things by thinking about them as being present. This has inspired the higher-order thought theory of consciousness, which was first explicitly developed in the 1990s.\n\nThere are many different kinds of higher-order thought theories. One version, the Relational Model, claims that the first-order state is transformed into a phenomenally conscious state when one becomes aware of that very state via having a higher-order thought. In addition, there are Joint-Determination Models which hold that the higher-order content and first-order content are part of the same mental state. These come in at least two varieties: the Same-Order Model and the Split-Level Model. These are distinguished by how they respond to worries about misrepresentation. In addition, there are Non-relational models which hold that the relevant higher-order state determines what it is like for one to have a conscious experience. Finally, there are non-standard higher-order theories that appeal to acquaintance or mental quotation.\n\nLevels of Consciousness\n\nhttps://www.barrettacademy.com/levels-of-consciousness\n\nThe Problem of Meaning and K.C. Bhattacharyya.pdf\n\nSharma, K. (1981).\n\nIndian Philosophical Quarterly 8 (4):457.\n\nOriginal Description:\n\nThis document discusses K.C. Bhattacharyya’s views on the problem of meaning and how they compare to analytical philosophers like Strawson and Russell. It summarizes that for Bhattacharyya, the subject cannot be meant by words like “I” as it has no objective content and varies between speakers, while objects are meant entities referred to by general terms. Strawson argues expressions only have reference in context of utterance, with “I” uniquely referring to the speaker, but for Bhattacharyya “I” expresses rather than refers to the subject. Overall, the document examines Bhattacharyya and analytical philosophers’ differing views on reference and meaning regarding subjective and objective contents.\n\nSelf and Subjectivity in Colonial India: AC Mukerji and KC Bhattcharyya\n\nNalini Bhushan and Jay L Garfield\n\nSolving Kant’s Problem: K.

Chattopadhyaya’s (DPC’s) chapter aims to cover the concept of freedom in K.C. Bhattacharyya (KCB). “Unlike most of the contemporary approaches to freedom”, DPC suggests, “KCB’s approach is not mainly social, ethical or aesthetic. … His concept of freedom is basically ontological or metaphysical. Its dimensions range from the physical via the somatological and the psychological to the psychical and the spiritual. … [H]e describes the disclosive process of freedom in the world, in our relation to the world of objects, within the contexts of psychological and psychical subjectivity, and beyond them”. DPC identifies a conversation in KCB’s writings between three approaches or systems of freedom: the Vedāntic, Kantian and phenomenological approaches. He discusses these three trajectories and their amalgamation in KCB. DPC further depicts KCB’s phenomenological process of inwardization toward the subject as freedom. He touches on the role of the body in this process, and explains that “our body-feeling starts getting resolved into psychic feeling. This is a sort of anti-projective or regressive ‘withdrawal’ of consciousness within a deeper layer of itself. The feeling of detachment or disengagement from the object, in this case from the body, provides us the ‘first’ or an inarticulate taste of freedom”.\n\nOn Exploration of Subjectivity in Advaita Vedanta\n\nAnindita N.

BHATTACHARYYA’s Philosophy\n\nBY: D.K. BHATTACHARYA\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Fundamentals of K.C. Bhattacharyyas Philosophy is the only exhaustive exposition of Krishnachandra Bhattacharyyas seminal philosophical ideas. Kalidas Bhattacharyya, son of Krishnachandra Bhattacharyya, had the opportunity of a prolonged critical exposure to this unique tradition. This monograph deals with Krishnachandra Bhattacharyyas epistemic and metaphysical line of thought from the definite to the indefinite, from the objective level to the higher levels of subjectivity, and from association to dissociation or freedom leading to an alternation between knowledge and freedom. Both definiteness and indefiniteness have been identified. The two, however, do not have a coordinate status. There is an alternation between them. One and the same situation could be alternatively understood as definite or as indefinite. This leads to Krishnachandra Bhattacharyyas well-known philosophical position of Alternative Standpoints.\n\nThe indefinite has to be made definite through layers of transcendental knowledge. The absolute-as-transcendental-knowledge is related to the understanding of the absolute-as-transcendental-will. The predatory outlook of the scientific intellect has been referred to and insightful correctives have been offered. Krishnachandra Bhattacharyyas style of writing is commensurate with the rigour and subtlety of his philosophy. The uninitiated requires a roadmap. This need is amply fulfilled by the present work. The monograph focuses on epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nThe insights gained through this faithful commentary will help advanced readers to develop their own philosophical pursuits and the beginner will receive a good grounding.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nEditors Note\n\nPreface\n\nIntroduction by Shefali Moitra\n\nThe Definite and the Indefinite\n\nThe Indefinite as Subjective\n\nSubjectivity as Freedom\n\nTruth Freedom and Value\n\nas Alternative Absolutes\n\nIndex\n\nFeeling for Freedom: K.

But this text relies on a set of ideas and develops from a set of concerns that KCB develops more explicitly in essays written both before and after that text, which might be regarded as its intellectual bookends. These ideas are important and fascinating in their own right. They also illuminate KCB’s engagement with Kant and with the Vedānta tradition as well as his understanding of freedom itself, including its soteriological dimension. These two essays are” Sankara’s Doctrine of Māyā”(1930) and” The Advaita and Its Spiritual Significance”(1936). We explore KCB’s conception of philosophy and its relation to spiritual practice through a close reading of these two essays.\n\nConsciousness in Advaita Vedanta\n\nBy William M.

The prevalence of selfies, sexting, Facebook pics and stories, tweets and Twitters, and new apps, all demonstrate the transition from a personal and private self to a public, even pubic, self.\n\nThis cult of the self may have emerged remotely from Delphi and Socrates but accelerated in the late 19th and 20th centuries with many philosophers, psychologists, and social psychologists, some of whom are mentioned here. These are now left behind by activists and the identity politics of gender, sexual orientation, gender orientation, and color. The front-page news in The New York Times recently (22 May) was the latest battle in the culture wars: bathrooms! We can fight about anything! — and everything, and we do.\n\nWho are you? What are you? What is your self? Most people, in my limited research on this topic, tend to identify in three principal ways: their familial roles, or their occupational roles or the defining characteristics of their personality (warm, strong, a survivor, romantic, adventurer, nurturing were common responses). (Thomas Kuhn’s Twenty Statements Test is more scientific.) And if you really don’t know who and what you are, the are plenty of personality tests to tell you, and perhaps some frenemies to explain precisely what is wrong with you.\n\nSome adopt a more existential vision. One respondent identified herself as “a butterfly” and as “a river. I have to keep moving or I’d die.” Active, but hopefully not all downhill. Performers are particularly demonstrative on the self. The Beatles: “I am the walrus” (A very strange self-concept, drawn from Lewis Carroll. “I am the emu” sounds much better). Michael Jackson: “I’m a lover, not a fighter.” Paul Simon: “I am a rock. I am an island.” (John Donne disagreed: “No man is an island.”) And Nietzsche: “I am… the Anti-Christ.” (1992:72.)\n\nAll sorts of different self-definitions and identities. All sorts of different people and types of people. What is also fascinating is how many people have tried to define this self, without too much agreement. It is elusive not least because it is constantly changing as we age, and enjoy or suffer different experiences: marriage, parenthood, promotion, job-change, sickness, disability, conversion, discrimination, lotto-winner, etc. Indeed the self is so mobile that Peg O’Connor described the self as a “unicorn” — “there is no authentic self. Identity is always a work in progress” (2014:50). One does have an identity, but it is fluid. You are not going to France or Indonesia in your gap year to “find yourself.” You are taking your self with you! Others believe it is a chameleon, for similar reasons. So this search for this unicorn-chameleon, albeit brief, looks useful, even fun.\n\n1. Sigmund Freud: Self as Iceberg.\n\nInfluenced by Charcot’s work on hypnotism and especially post-hypnotic suggestion, Freud came to understand that there are two types of mental processes, conscious and unconscious. And the unconscious is not easily accessed, but it is possible in therapy through dreams (in The Interpretation of Dreams) and the analysis of symbolism, and through parapraxes (in The Psycho-Pathology of Everyday Life), which we now know as Freudian slips (verbal slips, slips of the pen or of the body, mislaying, misreading, forgetting, and errors generally). He gives numerous examples of these giveaways. These parapraxes are thought of as expressions of repressed psychic material. Also conversion: how psychic concerns can affect the physical self: a union, or communion, of mind and body. One friend said that whenever her husband was unfaithful, she got sick. They say that 90% of an iceberg is underwater. Freud suggested that much of the self is below consciousness, and that it was important to bring it to the conscious. Perhaps how much is below varies with degrees of repression.\n\nFreud theorized the self far beyond the iceberg/unconscious to include the stages of psychosexual development (oral, anal, and phallic) and the stages of id, ego, and super-ego to include the many mechanisms of adaptation including fixation, regression, projection, repression, displacement, sublimation, transference, resistance (defense mechanisms), and more. While some of his contributions to self-understanding and to psychiatry have been contested, others have led to his being labeled among the top 10 intellectuals of the 20th century by Time magazine.\n\n2. William James: Self as Multiple.\n\n“A man has as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind.” But social selves may be contradictory, depending on the individuals. Your spouse will not have the same view of you as your ex-spouse. I think we can agree on that. And co-workers will not have the same image of him or her as the children do. But that is their concept of you, not your image of your self. So James does imply the possibility of contradictory, conflicting and multiple selves in the minds of others. Walt Whitman expressed this well: “Do I contradict myself? / Very well, then I contradict myself. / (I am large, I contain multitudes.)” As did American best-selling novelist Karin Slaughter. Here the protagonist, a rookie cop, debates shooting a villain:\n\nThe fifth Kate reared her ugly head. This Kate wanted darkness…Then the other Kates took over. She wasn’t sure which ones. The daughter? The widow? The cop? The whore? The real Kate, she wanted to think…The real Kate was a good person (2014:392).\n\nSo that makes six Kates in one; a double trinity, multiple personalities, and even conflicted and contradictory. Some of these images may be negative. In The Souls of Black Folk (1903) W.E.B. Du Bois pondered the question: “How does it feel to be a problem?” He explained that “being a problem is a strange experience – peculiar even for one who has never been anything else, save perhaps in boyhood and in Europe.” He added, “I remember well when the shadow swept across me. “ When as a “little thing” in school, a girl refused to accept his play visiting card. “Then it dawned upon me with a certain suddenness that I was different from the others…shut out from their world by a vast veil.” Self as problem to self, and to others who create the problem.\n\nIt is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. “One ever feels his two-ness – an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder” (ch. 1).\n\n3. C.H. Cooley: Self as Looking-Glass\n\nHis couplet:\n\nEach to each a looking-glass,\n\nReflects the other that doth pass.\n\nThe couplet reflects not only how poetic sociologists may be (don’t you love the “doth?”), but also their insight. Our idea of our selves is deeply influenced by what other people think of us or, strictly, what we think other people think of us. (True, the looking-glass is a flawed metaphor since it does not judge, unlike people.) This is especially true for our primary groups of intimate personal relations, the families of birth and our closest friendships. Significant others mirror us back to our selves, ranging from invective (crooked Hillary, crazy Bernie) to labelling (he’s a sexist, racist, fascist) to positive reinforcement (you’re the best) and high self-esteem to narcissism (I’m the best!). But there are many mirrors, all with different reflections, so figuring out who or what the self is would be tricky; indeed this self too would be multiple and contradictory.\n\nCooley perhaps under-estimated the degree to which we can refuse to internalize and can resist these looking-glass reflections which may problematize us, as Du Bois made clear. Distorting mirrors reflect us, badly. And much as mirrors may influence us, they do not determine us. One can fight back, resist the reflection, smash the mirror, as Frederick Douglass showed. Reflecting on his victory over an overseer when he was a slave, Douglass wrote: “The battle with Mr. Covey… was the turning point in my “life as a slave.”… I was a changed being after that fight. I was nothing before — I was a man now” (1962:143). A new self. Dramatic identity change.\n\n4. G. H. Mead: Self as Structure\n\n“The self, as that which can be an object to itself, is essentially a social structure and it arises in social experience” (1967: 140). Mead reflects both James and Cooley, but perhaps goes beyond them in his emphasis that the self is not only a reflection but is essentially a product, and reflexive. One can think about other people’s ideas about oneself, and react against them, like Douglass, (the boomerang effect,) or double-down and reinforce them, (the self-fulfilling prophecy). Yet Mead distinguishes between the core, the “me”, as object, developed out of past experiences and understandings, and the “I,” the sometimes impulsive subject, generating new ideas and new selves. So the self is both both solid and fluid.\n\n5. Abraham Maslow: Self as Flower\n\nMaslow is well known for moving psychology away from Freud to Humanistic Psychology: “It is as if Freud supplied us with the sick half of psychology and we must now fill it out with the healthy half.” (Not a very generous verdict!) He is also well-known for his “hierarchy of needs” which should be satisfied for optimal psychic health. The self in this view is like a flower, potentially growing into full bloom. The seven needs are: 1) physiological: warmth, food, etc. for the baby; 2) safety needs; 3) psychological needs: love, belonging; 4) esteem needs: self-satisfaction; 5) cognitive needs: education, skills; 6) aesthetic needs: harmony, order; 7) self-actualization: maturity, joy, creativity. The process is not automatic, like an elevator, but it can be linked to changes in the life cycle as discussed by Eric Erikson, Daniel Levinson, George Vaillant, and Gail Sheehy.\n\n6. Jean-Paul Sartre: Self as Self-Creative\n\n“Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.” (1957:15). Rejecting any traditional, essentialist idea of human nature, Sartre adds: “In other words, there is no determinism, man is free, man is freedom” (p.23). To clarify: “You are nothing less than your life” (p.33) combining all your projects, actions, and choices. We are who and what we make our selves to be. We create our selves. If we persistently cheat, we become cheats. The meaning of our lives is the meaning we give it. Again: “Man makes himself” (p.43). There is a choice of ethics, and a freedom to choose, whether we want it or not. Hence his idea that “man is condemned to be free” (p.23). He insists that “life has no meaning a priori. Before you come alive, life is nothing; it’s up to you to give it a meaning…” (p.43). The self, in his view, is not an iceberg, nor a passive reflection, nor a flower that may grow; it is what we make it. But it is somewhat atomistic.\n\nTwo dissenting opinions are worth noting. Schopenhauer insists on luck as the prevailing wind. That would include the luck of parents, genetics, country of birth, status, war, plague, etc.: pure chance, no freedom there.\n\nA man’s life is like the voyage of a ship, where luck…acts the part of the wind, and speeds the vessel on its way or drives it far out of its course. All that a man can do for himself is of little avail; like the rudder, which if worked hard and continuously, may help in the navigation of the ship; and yet all may be lost again by a sudden squall (n.d.:169)\n\nHe was a bit of a pessimist: “We are like lambs in a field, disporting ourselves under the eye of the butcher, who chooses out first one and then another for his prey.” (n.d. 382)\n\nThe second opinion, of a physicist, is also deterministic, not luck but neurons, but less pessimistic:\n\nWe have 100 billion neurons in our brains, as many as there are stars in a galaxy, with an even more astronomical number of links and potential combinations through which they can interact… “We” are the process formed by this entire intricacy, not just by the little bit of it of which we are conscious (in Lapham, 2016:17).\n\n7. Self as Onion\n\nWe might think of others, or ourselves, as like onions, layer upon layer, level upon level, or as a many-sided diamond, or like those Russian dolls, the matryoshka, one inside another, inside another. Someone might say: “I’ve never seen this side of you before!” (self as polygon). The novelist Dick Francis described this layering:\n\nI was amazed by his compassion and felt I should have recognised earlier how many unexpected layers there were to Tremayne below the loud executive exterior: not just his love of horses, not just his need to be recorded, not even his disguised delight in Gareth [his son], but other, secret, unrevealed privacies…(1990:50).\n\nBut the funniest has to be Shrek. Ogres are like onions, not layer-cakes.\n\nThis model is indicated by the phrase “hidden depths” (wherein monsters may lurk) and reflects the notion that one may not really know someone, just the Goffmanesque presentations of the different selves acting in different roles and circumstances, which may be camouflage and masks. But the better one gets to know someone under very different circumstances, the more clearly one can see different selves emerging — or not. The self may be remarkably opaque, not only to the self, as Freud indicated, but also to others.\n\nTwo classic examples are Kim Philby and Bernie Madoff. They were not who they seemed to be. Shakespeare got it, as Julius Caesar mused: “One may smile and smile and be a villain.” And as Lady Macbeth instructed her husband: “Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it.” It took years before investigators “uncovered” who Philby and Madoff were — and their double lives, double selves. “Uncovering” indicates the utility of this onion/layer metaphor.\n\nIn a less lethal application, spouses may take years to realize (and hopefully appreciate more and more) who and what their beloved “really” is. (Not as in the comic phrase: “deep down you’re shallow”). Onions do not have cores as dates and avocados do, so the metaphor is somewhat inadequate, but it does capture the layering.\n\nWinston Churchill expressed this well speaking of Russia: “Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” (Much like their nesting dolls.) Banyan in the Economist just applied exactly the same phrase to China (2 July 2016:36). The journalist Kim Barker wrote something similar about India: “India was a series of challenges wrapped up in a mystical blanket covered in an existential quandary” (2016:82-3). It seems that we do not know each other very well.\n\n8. Self as Identity\n\nOur self-concept is our identity, but identities are socially constructed according to cultural norms, which are not universal. Consider Barack Obama, widely described as the first black President of the USA, in accord with American norms, specifically in the tradition of the “one-drop” rule. But his mother was white. In accord with another possible rule, “one drop of white blood,” he would be considered white. He is really a shade of brown, anyway, and would be described as such in many other cultures, more sensitive to shades of color.\n\nJames McBride offers a classic example. His father was black, his mother white. He remarks about his 11 siblings: “We were all clearly black, of various shades of brown, some light brown, some medium brown, some very light-skinned, and all of us had curly hair” (1997:22). The usual confusion of chromatic and social color. The terms “black” and “white” are symbolic, cultural, and political. Malcolm X noted: “…when he says he’s white, he means he’s boss. That’s right. That’s what white means in this language.” (1966:163).\n\nThen again, Rachel Dolezal exemplifies the issue of who defines us. The daughter of white parents, she identified as black, darkened her hair and her skin and passed as black for years, and worked for the NAACP; but when her parentage became known, her self-defined identity was largely rejected by others as a lie and a fraud. She defended herself insisting that her identity was not biological, but presumably political or psychological. Color identity is seemingly problematic.\n\nConsider too how gender identities have suddenly been spotlighted, most publicly by Caitlin Jenner. We used to recognize two genders, biologically defined and immutable; now we recognize that they are psychologically defined and are mutable. India, however, recognizes three on visa applications. Other cultures also recognize three. As do some individuals who refuse to be labeled male or female. If even such apparently basic identities as color and gender are culturally constructed, not to mention age, beauty, and more, then so, clearly, are ideas of the self. Identity is slippery.\n\n9 & 10. Self as Unicorn and Chameleon\n\nIn sum, the self is both unicorn and chameleon. From the fog or flashlight brilliance of identity, theorists we might conclude that the self is a unicorn since it is partly unknown, even unknowable because it is so below consciousness and “in progress”; and a chameleon because it is multiple, mutable, adaptable, and selective in presentation. These selves may be complementary, contradictory, or conflicted.\n\nSo while the self is constantly presented to numerous “friends,” it is itself both one and many: unicorn and chameleon, iceberg and onion, a mask and camouflage, a flower and what you create, a looking-glass and a distorting mirror, fluid, a work in progress, a polygon with hidden depths and many layers. Given all these ideas and models, I suspect that there are not many selves who are an “open book.” If nothing else, the self and other selves are: “Surprise!” “Know thyself” is hard enough. Know someone else… really?\n\nYet surely all this fixation with the self is a trifle unhealthy — me! me! me! — since it may vitiate against community, and concern with and for others: a cultural narcissism.\n\nReferences\n\nBarker, Kim 2016.

He’s probably someone you’ve heard of; he’s a pretty famous psychologist from the late 19th early 20th centuries. While his theory of personalities is outdated, it was monumental in influencing how we think about personality today.\n\nWhen you think of Freud, you might think about going into therapy and lying down on a couch, telling your therapist about your problems. But if someone goes into therapy today, the therapist isn’t going to say ‘Oh, of course! Aha! It’s the id, the ego and the superego. They’re just not talking to each other right. Nevertheless, these three personality parts have entered the mainstream understanding of how we think about internal conflict.\n\nLet’s think about an average person who’s pushed and pulled in lots of directions by different drives, like sex and food, but also ethics and a wish to maintain a healthy body. These drives are pushing them and pulling them in different directions, and maybe they’re not even aware.\n\nThis is the idea of internal conflict. It’s the conflict between basic desires (the id), morality and being a good person (the superego) and consciousness (the ego.)\n\nThe Id\n\nSo first let’s start with the id. This is an unconscious part of your personality. It is basically the childish and impulsive part of you that just does what it wants, and it wants things really intensely and doesn’t really think about the consequences. Freud describes this as operating on a pleasure principle, which essentially means what it sounds like, which is that it’s always seeking to try to increase pleasure and decrease pain.\n\nNow, as an example of this, let’s say you come home and you find to your delight that your roommate has baked a cake. Your id would think ‘Oh! I want that cake right now! That looks delicious!’ You know your roommate’s not going to be happy if you eat it, so first, you eat a little piece of the corner, and then you have to cut yourself a slice so it doesn’t look disgusting, and then soon enough you’ve eaten the whole thing; it’s gone.\n\nHow did you manage to eat the whole cake? Blame your id for taking over. That’s what your id aims to do in life. It wants you to eat whole cakes because it wants you to increase pleasure. Cakes are going to make you feel good – why not eat the whole thing? Now, what it also wants to do is decrease pain. So let’s say you wake up the next morning and you think, ‘Oh no, I just ate a whole cake. That’s really bad, maybe I’ll get some exercise.’ You think to yourself about how you will go hiking in the mountains all day, and you tell yourself, ‘Alright, let’s get some exercise!’ No, your id says, ‘That’s not gonna happen; that’s gonna hurt. We don’t want to do that.’ So if you’re totally id driven, you’d basically eat the whole cake and then you would not go hiking the next day to burn off the calories. That’s the pleasure principle.\n\nThe Superego\n\nNow, we usually don’t eat whole cakes and lay on the couch all day every day. What helps to control the rampaging id? There is another part of your personality that’s mainly unconscious, and it’s the superego. The superego is the part of you that’s super judgmental and moralizing and is always trying to get you to behave in a socially appropriate way. Now let’s see what the superego would do if you come home and you find the cake.\n\nIf the superego is in charge, you wouldn’t eat the cake at all. You’d still think it looks delicious and want to eat it, but the superego would say, ‘No, it’s my roommate’s cake. I’m not gonna eat this cake!’ Remember, the superego wants you to behave morally and appropriately, and it’s not that socially appropriate to eat other people’s baked goods.\n\nBut, let’s imagine that your id takes over, so you do eat the cake. The same thing happens: you eat a little bit, you eat a little bit more, and somehow you end up eating it all. But now your superego jumps back into action. What happens now that you already ate the cake? Guilt is what’s going to happen. Your superego makes you feel really guilty when you do things that are not socially appropriate.\n\nWhat do you do now? If your superego is in control again, you would certainly go jogging, but you would also apologize to your roommate and bake them a new cake, maybe an even better one than before. The superego controls our sense of right and wrong. We feel bad when we do things that are wrong, and we feel good when we do things that are right, and that’s what the superego controls.\n\nPiaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development\n\nIntroduction\n\nMark, a two-year-old, and Ally, an eight-year-old, are sitting at the table waiting for a snack. Their mom presents them each with a cup of juice, the same amount in each cup. Mark begins to cry and point, saying ‘You gave her more.’ Mark’s mom tries to reason with the young child, explaining that the same amount of juice is in each cup, but he is insistent that he is being treated unfairly. What is happening in this situation? In this lesson, we will learn about the stages of cognitive development while watching Mark proceed through infancy to adolescence.\n\nJean Piaget proposed stages of cognitive development through which children and adolescents proceed based on maturation and experience. They are: sensorimotor stage, preoperational stage, concrete operations and formal operations.\n\nSensorimotor Intelligence and Preoperational Thinking\n\nThe first two sequential stages deal with the cognitive development of infants and young children. They are sensorimotor intelligence and preoperational (prelogical) intelligence.\n\nThe sensorimotor intelligence stage occurs from birth to approximately 1-2 years. In the child’s first year, the processes of intelligence are both presymbolic and preverbal. For the infant, the meaning of an object involves what can be done with it. These actions include pushing, opening, pulling, closing and so forth. In the second year of life, the young child develops the identity of his or her own body and others in time and space. The infant develops action schemes, such as reaching for an object or grasping something or pulling it towards them. At this stage of development, Mark can pull a string to reach the object at the end of it. He can pull a blanket to get an out-of-reach toy and so on. Another example is Mark putting objects into his mouth to determine the shape and structure. This is something that many infants and young toddlers do.\n\nOur next stage is preoperational thinking. This occurs from around 2-3 years to approximately 7 years of age. Partially logical thinking or thought begins during these years. For example, the child recognizes that water poured from one container to another is the same water. However, the child reasons only from one specific item of information to another and makes decisions based on perceptual cues. Preoperational thinking can and usually is illogical. For example, Mark, based on his perceptions, thought that the taller, slender glass had more juice in it than the shorter, wider glass that he received. In other words, perceptual cues, such as the height of the juice in the glass, dominate the child’s judgment. Also, children in this stage have difficulty accepting another person’s perspective or point of view. Piaget referred to this as egocentrism.\n\nConcrete Operational and Formal Operational Thinking\n\nThe basic units of logical thinking are particular kinds of cognitive activity that Piaget referred to as operations. The two levels of logical thinking identified by Piaget are concrete operational and formal operational thinking.\n\nThe concrete operational stage occurs from around 7-8 years of age to 12-14 or older. Concrete operational thinking is linked to the direct manipulation of objects. It involves situations that require an understanding of simultaneous changes in multiple characteristics of objects. An example is flattening a ball of clay into a hot dog shape – as the shape becomes longer, it also becomes thinner.\n\nThe child at the level of concrete operational thinking can demonstrate the following:\n\nA transformation in one feature or characteristic of a situation is exactly balanced by a transformation in another characteristic.\n\nThe essential nature of the object or data remains consistent.\n\nThe transformation in the object can be returned to the original form by an opposite or inverse action.\n\nLet’s discuss these more specifically and put some terms in. The capability of recognizing the unchanging characteristic of an object is referred to as conservation. The child can demonstrate conservation by returning the object to its original form or organization. For example, Mark has a ball of clay. It’s first in a ball shape. He can flatten it out. He understands now that the same amount of clay exists whether it’s in the ball form or the flat form. This is conservation.\n\nMoral Decision\n\nAt some point in your life, you’ve probably been faced with a moral dilemma. Consider this example: a father tells his daughter, Lauren, that she can have a bike if she saves enough money from her weekly allowance to pay for half of it. Finally, when Lauren tells her father she’s saved up all the money, her father gives her the other half and tells her to buy her bike. Lauren goes to the store to buy her bike and sees the one she’s been saving up for is on sale, so she will have money left over. She deliberates if she should return the extra money to her father or keep it and not tell him. They both kept their end of the agreement, so the extra money is a bonus surprise, but if she doesn’t tell him, it feels like she’s deceiving him.\n\nLawrence Kohlberg: Stages of Moral Development\n\nPsychologist Lawrence Kohlberg was especially interested in how children develop their ability to make moral decisions like this one. He came up with several stages of moral development, which, though not without criticism from other psychologists, form a good starting point to think about these questions. It is important to remember that not everyone, even adults, necessarily make it into all of the higher stages.\n\nPre-Conventional Level\n\nPeople first pass through two stages known collectively as the pre-conventional level. In the first stage, people are motivated by trying to avoid punishment; their actions are bad if they get punished and good if they don’t. In this stage, Lauren would give her father the money because she doesn’t want him to punish her.\n\nAt the second stage, people are motivated purely by self-interest. Lauren at this stage would likely keep the money, thinking that, even if she has the bike, she can’t use it unless she can buy a helmet.\n\nConventional Level\n\nThe next level of moral development, the conventional, also contains two stages. Adolescents typically operate at this level, as do some adults. In stage three, people make moral decisions based on getting people to like them. Lauren might decide to give her father the money because this will improve her relationship with him; but if her mother is upset that her father spent money they needed for bills, she might decide to give the money to her mother in order to be a ‘good girl’ in her eyes. Her decision would be based on whichever social relationship seemed most important.\n\nIn stage four, moral reasoning centers around maintaining a functioning society by recognizing that laws are more important than individual needs. In this stage, Lauren probably would give her father the extra money because not doing so, in her eyes, equates to stealing from her family.\n\nCarol Gilligan: Moral Development\n\nA community of moles gives shelter to a homeless porcupine. The moles, however, are constantly stabbed by the porcupine’s quills. What should they do?\n\nThis scenario was used to aid in the development of a theory that argued women and men may have differing paths to moral development. This lesson will introduce and apply that theory, developed by Carol Gilligan.\n\nThe field of moral development encompasses prosocial behavior, such as altruism, caring and helping, along with traits such as honesty, fairness, and respect. Many theories of moral development have been proposed, but this lesson will focus on the specific theory proposed by Psychologist Carol Gilligan.\n\nGilligan was a student of Developmental Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, who introduced the theory of stages of moral development. Gilligan, however, felt as though her mentor’s theory did not adequately address the gender differences of moral development due to the fact that participants in Kohlberg’s study were predominately male and because his theory did not include the caring perspective.\n\nGilligan argued that males and females are often socialized differently, and females are more apt than males to stress interpersonal relationships and take responsibility for the well-being of others. Gilligan suggested this difference is due to the child’s relationship with the mother and that females are traditionally taught a moral perspective that focuses on community and caring about personal relationships.\n\nCare-Based Morality & Justice-Based Morality\n\nGilligan proposed the Stages of the Ethics of Care theory, which addresses what makes actions ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. Gilligan’s theory focused on both care-based morality and justice-based morality.\n\nCare-based morality is based on the following principles:\n\nEmphasizes interconnectedness and universality.\n\nActing justly means avoiding violence and helping those in need.\n\nCare-based morality is thought to be more common in girls because of their connections to their mothers.\n\nBecause girls remain connected to their mothers, they are less inclined to worry about issues of fairness.\n\nJustice-based morality is based on the following principles:\n\nViews the world as being composed of autonomous individuals who interact with another.\n\nActing justly means avoiding inequality.\n\nIs thought to be more common in boys because of their need to differentiate between themselves and their mothers.\n\nBecause they are separated from their mothers, boys become more concerned with the concept of inequality.\n\nReturning to our mole/porcupine scenario, researchers found individuals approached the problem with two perspectives: justice-based morality or care-based morality. Gender differences were also evident.\n\nIndividuals with a justice-based perspective tend to see any dilemma as a conflict between different claims. The moles want one thing; the porcupine wants something incompatible. They can’t both have a valid claim on the burrow, so only one of them can be right. A solution to the dilemma is not a resolution of the conflict; it’s a verdict, in which one side gets everything and the other side gets nothing.\n\nThe care-based perspective approaches the problem differently. Rather than seeing all the parties as separate individuals with their own valid or invalid claims, it sees them as already in a difficult situation together. If there is a conflict between them, that is part of the problem. The point is not to decide the conflict one way or the other but to find a way to get around it or remove it. This perspective starts from the particular case and the actual people within it and hopes to find a solution that will not damage anyone. It will be ready to embrace compromise and creative solutions.\n\nResearchers have found a tendency for males to adopt the justice perspective and for females to be more likely than males to adopt the caring perspective.\n\nStages of Ethics of Care\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead’s Theory of Self\n\nIn sociological conceptions of the Self, the development of the Self is examined in the context of social phenomena like socialization. George Herbert Mead, an American sociologist, pioneered an essential theory in sociology. The mentality is viewed by George Herbert Mead’s theory as an individual’s incorporation of the collective. Mead used a social process to describe the person and the mind. A person’s body takes in gestures and the collective sentiments of others and responds accordingly with other structured mindsets that are also absorbed by the human organism.\n\nMead’s theory of self refers to this as the “I” and the “me” phase. The “I” is the answer to the “me,” which is the interpersonal Self. Put another way, “I” is a person’s reaction to other people’s emotions, whereas “me” is the ordered set of those perceptions that one acquires. How one assumes one’s organization sees oneself is what one refers to as the “me,” which is the total of the “generalized other“. The “I” stands for a person’s feelings and instincts. Self-as-subject and self-as-object are synonymous in the “I.” The “I” is the one who knows, and the “me” is the one who is being understood. “I” and “me” are constantly interacting, and this interaction is what we refer to as the “stream of thought.” The human cognition concept is based on these processes, which go beyond the idea of selfhood in a restricted sense. Mead sees the internal debate between “I” and “me” as the thinking process.\n\nMead’s “I” and “me,” when viewed as a synthesis of the “I” and the “me,” reveal a profoundly social nature. In Mead’s view, a person’s place in a community is more important than individuality. Being aware of one’s self-consciousness can only come about when one has actively participated in various social roles.\n\nAccording to Mead and Charles Cooley, the Self is determined by people’s social interactions. How one appears to others determines one’s social identity, or looking-glass self (a term coined by Cooley). In other words, the stage is attached to the concept of developing self. Cooley’s assertions about the social development of children formed the basis of this initial theory. People get the most direct feedback about themselves from the responses of others to their actions. This idea means that solitary activities cannot contribute to the development of the Self as it requires external interactions.\n\nAs per Cooley and Mead, self-identity is formed in three phases. First, people perceive how they look in the eyes of others. Additionally, individuals imagine how others judge them by relying on looks and how they display themselves. Finally, individuals perceive how others feel about them due to the moral judgments they create.\n\nHowever, Heinz Kohut, a psychologist from the United States, proposed a bipolar self, which he claimed was composed of two processes of narcissistic brilliance, one of which contained goals and the other constituted ideals. The narcissistic Self, according to Kohut, seems to be the pinnacle of aspiration. He referred to the idealized parental image as the pole of standards. According to Kohut, the two poles of Self portray the regular advancement of a child’s psychic life.\n\nOn the other hand, according to Jungian theory, the Self is one of several archetypes. It’s a metaphor for a person’s entire mind, including their subconscious and conscious thoughts, defined by Jung as the procedure of combining one’s personality that leads to the Self.\n\nWhat is the Role of Self in the Socialization Process?\n\nIn both Cooley and Mead’s view, a person’s identity is formed through self-socialization. For anyone to develop a precise self-image, self-socialization provides an opportunity to reflect and contend with themselves.\n\nDeveloping an image of oneself predicated on how one thinks or appears to others is known as the “looking-glass self”. Through one’s reactions to a behavior, other people serve as a reflector, referring to others the image they project. In Mead’s view, the first step is to see oneself as others do.\n\nSociological theories of Self attempt to describe how social processes like socialization impact the growth of the Self. It is common to use the concept of “self-concept” to describe how an individual views, assesses and interprets their own identity. To have a notion of oneself is to be self-aware.\n\nMead believed that the Self is formed through the child’s interactions with those around them. The newborn child’s needs, including clothes and food, are pressing and must be met. The mother meets these needs, and the baby develops a strong emotional attachment to her and grows to rely heavily on her.\n\nAccording to Mead’s theory, as the child grows older, they separate from their mother and must learn to submit to the mother’s authority over them. The child then repeats this for their dad. They distinguish the father from the mother before assimilating him into society. In this sense, the child’s number of significant others grows, and the child integrates the role of such others in their development. Using his own words, the child responds to them and behaves according to what they mean to the other individual.\n\nMead’s Theory of Self: Development of Self\n\nMead held the notion that humans form their self-images via connections with others. He contended that the Self results from society’s experience, which would be the part of a person’s personality that includes self-awareness or self-image. Mead laid out three concepts on how one’s Self grows:\n\nLanguage\n\nSymbols are exchanged in social interactions. According to Mead, language and other symbolic representations are uniquely human in how they carry sense. Therefore, the best way to understand others is to imagine the scenario from their point of view first. He formulated the term “taking the other’s role” to describe the way people perceive themselves concerning others. When children are in this phase, they begin to mimic their surroundings. Because of this, parents usually avoid using foul language in front of their children.\n\nPlay\n\nAt this stage, children assume and break the rules of structured games such as sports or freeze tag. Playing along with whatever rules they create throughout the game will be much more convenient than enforcing guidelines on them. Here, children pretend that they are the ones they love. As a result, they attempt to be their mothers and fathers when they role-play.\n\nForming Psychological Identities / Erik Erikson\n\nWhat are Erikson’s stages of development? Learn about Erikson life stages, psychosocial development theory, and the history and contributions to the theory.\n\nHow do we develop an identity, or a sense of self? Psychologists have many theories. One, named Erik Erikson, believed that we work on constructing psychosocial identities throughout our whole lives. By ‘psychosocial,’ he meant an interplay between our inner, emotional lives (psycho), and our outer, social circumstances (social).\n\nErikson believed that as we grow and age, we pass through eight stages of development. He thought that each stage was defined by a specific conflict between a pair of opposing impulses or behaviors. The resolution (or inability to resolve) these conflicts affects our personalities and identities.\n\nErikson defines four childhood stages and three adult stages, bridged together by one stage of adolescence. We’ll go through each stage and define it by its central conflict, as well we give some examples of behaviors and patterns of thinking characteristic of the stage.\n\nOral-Sensory Stage\n\nThe first is the oral-sensory stage, encompassing the first year of life and defined by a conflict between trust and mistrust. Infants during this time learn to trust their parents if they’re reliably cared for and fed; if not, if they’re neglected or abused, they’ll develop mistrust instead. Infants at this stage either learn that they can trust others to fulfill their needs, or that they can’t, that the world is a dangerous and unreliable place.\n\nMuscular-Anal Stage\n\nThe second stage is called muscular-anal and defined by the conflict between autonomy and shame and doubt. Parents who allow their toddlers, between the ages of about 1-3, to explore their surroundings and develop interests of their own help to foster a sense of autonomy. But parents who are too restrictive or cautious with their children can instead leave them with doubt about their abilities. Li"
