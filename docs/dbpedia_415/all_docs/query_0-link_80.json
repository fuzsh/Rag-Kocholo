No problems with my OTA TV reception, just wondering if someone can explain the following to me. The local NBC affiliate WSAZ (3.1) broadcast on RF-22 from barkers ridge (Cabell County WV). Recently I starting getting a second broadcast of WSAZ (3.10 ) on RF-24. Same program in HD just from a different location (Coal Mountain Putman Country WV). Before the last repack RF-24 was the local FOX affiliate.\n\nSinclair owns both the local ABC & FOX affiliates. When Sinclair moved both to RF-29, I hoped that meant the ATSC 3.0 broadcast of ABC & FOX would be on RF-24. WSAZ prides itself with being the first local TV station, first color broadcast in this part of the country. Flat & Scruggs did their show from WSAZ before Nashville got color. Just wondering what's going on. I tried emailing the station engineer at WSAZ but the link dosenb't work. Any suggestions or guess.\n\nIt looks like virtual channel \"03.10\" (NBC) is broadcasting on likely leased RF sub-channel 24.8 as a repeater for the Putnam County area that presumably has poor reception from the \"home\" channel tower on RF 22. Apparently you're in between them in an area good overlapping coverage.\n\nRabbitEars.Info\n\nRabbitEars, where you can learn all about local, over-the-air TV channels.\n\nI don't that is it, they both have the same coverage area. Both are between Charleston and Huntington WV and only 18 miles apart.\n\nWill ATSC 3.0 have better or less coverage for the same ERP ? Maybe WSAZ is planning on using the Putman County broadcast for ATSC 1.0 and the Barker ridge Broadcast for ATSC 3.0"
