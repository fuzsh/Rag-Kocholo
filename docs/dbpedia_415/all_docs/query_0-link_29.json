It was expected that Hearst would merge with Disney, ABC, Allbritton and E.W. Scripps, while selling off five stations (Hearst's WBAL-TV and Scripps' KJRH-TV, KSHB-TV and WPTV-TV to NBC, and Disney's KCAL-TV to California Television Investors, a limited partnership formed by two KTLA-TV employees).\n\n-\n\nTribune and Gaylord to merge\n\nTribune Company, a Chicago-based company comprising of newspapers and television stations affiliated with The WB announced plans to merge with Gaylord Entertainment Company.
