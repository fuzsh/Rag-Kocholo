        "text": "Fox affiliates (independently owned stations broadcasting Fox shows) fund Fox Lies. But a station manager or passerby may tell you the affiliate has nothing to do with Fox “News” and the newscasts from this station are independently produced. This is basically true. However, the stations at which you are protesting — along with the other 200+ affiliates — combine to pay Fox and Rupert Murdoch billions of dollars a year in affiliate fees.\n\n​\n\nLet your neighbors know that watching ANY Fox show fuels Fox Lies. (Yes, the Simpsons fuel Fox Lies)."
