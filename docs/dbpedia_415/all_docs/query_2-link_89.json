Goldfarb\n\nSpecialist in Industrial Organization and Telecommunications Policy\n\nResources, Science, and Industry Division\n\nA Condensed Review of Retransmission Consent and\n\nOther Federal Rules Affecting Programmer-Distributor\n\nNegotiations\n\nSummary\n\nWhen conflicts arise between a programmer (a broadcaster or a cable\n\nnetwork owner) and a multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD, usually\n\na cable or satellite operator) about the carriage of particular video programming, the\n\nprice for that programming, or the tier on which the programming is to be offered to\n\nthe end user, many consumers can be affected. Recently there have been several\n\nincidents in which a negotiating impasse between a programmer and a distributor has\n\nresulted in the programmer refusing to allow the MVPD to carry, or the MVPD\n\nchoosing not to carry, a program network. While contractual terms, conditions, and\n\nrates are determined by private negotiations, they are strongly affected by a number\n\nof federal statutory provisions and regulatory requirements, including the statutory\n\nretransmission consent and must-carry rules, the FCC program exclusivity rules,\n\nlocal-into-local and distant signal provisions in satellite laws, copyright law\n\nprovisions relating to cable and satellite, statutory commercial leased access\n\nrequirements and program carriage and nondiscriminatory access provisions, and the\n\nFCCâs media ownership rules.\n\nThe recent increase in negotiating impasses appears to be the result of structural\n\nmarket changes that have given programmers with âmust-haveâ programming much\n\ngreater leverage, particularly when they are negotiating with small distributors.\n\nCompetitive entry in distribution â almost all cable companies now face\n\ncompetition from two satellite companies, and are beginning to face competition\n\nfrom telephone companies â has emboldened programmers with popular\n\nprogramming to demand cash payment from distributors for the right to carry that\n\nprogramming. In particular, local broadcasters increasingly are using the statutory\n\nretransmission consent requirement to demand cash payment from small cable\n\ncompanies who could lose subscribers to the satellite providers and new telephone\n\nentrants if they reach an impasse with the broadcaster and can no longer carry the\n\nlocal broadcast signals. In the past, the cable companies were the only MVPD in a\n\nmarket and could use that countervailing power to refuse to pay cash for carriage.\n\nThus, ironically, competition in the distribution market may be resulting in higher\n\nprogramming costs that MVPDs may have to pass on to their subscribers.\n\nThe small cable companies have argued that some of the existing statutory and\n\nregulatory requirements were implemented at a time when cable was a monopoly and\n\nwere intended to protect broadcasters. Now that the market dynamics have changed,\n\nthey argue, some of these rules should be changed to allow for more even-handed\n\nnegotiations. At the same time, however, as a result of consolidation and clustering\n\nin the cable industry there are a few very large cable companies, which primarily\n\nserve major markets, as well as the two national satellite operators, that appear to\n\nhave sufficient market strength to be able to withstand many of the demands of the\n\nprogrammers with must-have programming and to place small independent\n\nprogrammers at a negotiating disadvantage.

Goldfarb.\n\n2 In the Matter of Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the\n\nDelivery of Video Programming, Federal Communications Commission, MB Docket No.\n\n05-255, Twelfth Annual Report, adopted February 10, 2006, released March 3, 2006, at\n\npara. 8. As of June 2005, there were 109.6 million television households, of which\n\napproximately 94.2 million subscribed to an MVPD service. Of the latter, 69.4% received\n\nvideo programming from a franchised cable operator and 27.7% from a DBS operator.\n\n3 Even where the impasse involves broadcast programming that is transmitted over the air,\n\nmost households that subscribe to an MVPD no longer have an antenna and therefore at a\n\nminimum would have to obtain and install an antenna to continue to receive the\n\nprogramming. In these cases, the MVPD typically has offered to provide a free ârabbit-\n\nearsâ antenna, although in many cases a higher quality rooftop antenna is needed to get good\n\nover the air reception, and some households cannot get decent reception even with a rooftop\n\nantenna. Indeed, that inability to receive broadcast signals over the air was the original\n\nimpetus for cable television, which was then called community antenna television, or\n\nCATV.\n\nCRS-2\n\nof the danger of losing access to particular programming and being encouraged by\n\neach side to contact the other side in order to place pressure on them to compromise.\n\nAlthough the contractual terms, conditions, and rates at which programmers\n\nmake their programming available to distributors are determined by private\n\nnegotiations, there are a number of federal statutory provisions and regulatory\n\nrequirements that strongly affect those negotiations.4 These include:\n\n! the retransmission consent and must-carry rules, which govern\n\nthe carriage of television broadcast signals by cable operators.5\n\nUnder these rules, every three years each local commercial broadcast\n\ntelevision station must choose between (1) negotiating a\n\nretransmission consent agreement with each cable system operating\n\nin its service area, whereby if agreement is reached the broadcaster\n\nis compensated6 by the cable system for the right to carry the\n\nbroadcast signal, and if agreement is not reached, the cable system\n\nis not allowed to carry the signal; or (2) requiring each cable system\n\noperating in its service area to carry its signal, but receiving no\n\ncompensation for such carriage.7 With this mandatory election,\n\n4 For a detailed discussion of many of these statutory provisions and regulatory\n\nrequirements, see Federal Communications Commission, Retransmission Consent and\n\nExclusivity Rules: Report to Congress Pursuant to Section 208 of the Satellite Home Viewer\n\nExtension and Reauthorization Act of 2004 (FCC Retransmission Consent Report),\n\nSeptember 8, 2005, available at [http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-\n\n260936A1.pdf], viewed on May 21, 2007.\n\n5 The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-385)\n\nestablished new rules, placed into Sections 325 and 614 of the Communications Act, as\n\namended (47 U.S.C. 534). These rules apply to all cable operators. AT&T has claimed that,\n\ndue to the technology employed, its MVPD service is an information service rather than a\n\ncable service, and thus not subject to cable rules. It views the retransmission consent rules\n\nas part of the copyright licensing framework and has agreed to negotiate for retransmission\n\nconsent, but it views the must-carry rules as part of the cable regulatory regime that does not\n\napply to its service. This is a controversial position.\n\n6 Compensation can take the form of cash payments, the MVPDâs purchase of advertising\n\ntime on the broadcast station, the broadcaster being given free advertising time on the\n\nMVPDâs system, the MVPDâs carriage (and tier placement) of other program networks\n\nowned by the broadcaster, or some combination of these.\n\n7 Section 614(b)(3)(A) of the Communications Act states that âA cable operator shall carry\n\nin its entirety, on the cable system of that operator, the primary video ... transmission of each\n\nof the local commercial television stations carried on the cable system....â As broadcasters\n\nhave deployed digital technology, they have been able to use their new digital spectrum to\n\ntransmit multiple video streams, not just a single stream, and/or to transmit their\n\nprogramming in high-definition as well as standard format. The broadcasters have sought\n\nan interpretation of the must-carry rule that would require cable operators to carry both their\n\nanalog and their digital transmissions and, where they are offering multiple video streams\n\nor high-definition transmissions, that would require cable operators to carry their multiple\n\nstreams and high-definition transmissions. To date, the FCC has not adopted that\n\ninterpretation, but it is currently under discussion. As a result, carriage of these additional\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-3\n\nbroadcasters with popular programming that are confident the local\n\ncable systems will want to carry that programming can make the\n\nretransmission consent election and be assured compensation for\n\nsuch carriage, and broadcasters with less popular programming that\n\nthe local cable systems might otherwise not choose to carry can\n\nmake the must carry election and be assured that their signal will be\n\ncarried by all local cable systems. In many cases local broadcasters\n\nthat are affiliated with a national broadcast network and have elected\n\nthe retransmission consent option have (as part of their affiliation\n\nagreement) assigned to the network the right to negotiate the terms\n\nof retransmission consent.\n\n! a number of Federal Communications Commission (FCC or\n\nCommission) exclusivity rules8 that give local broadcasters the\n\nexclusive right to distribute certain programming (the network\n\nprogram non-duplication rules9 and syndicated exclusivity protection\n\nrules10) or that protect a sports teamâs or sports leagueâs distribution\n\nrights to a sporting event taking place in a local market (the sports\n\nprogramming blackout rules11). These rules, which tend to mirror\n\n7 (...continued)\n\nvideo transmissions has been subject to retransmission consent negotiations, and is not\n\nmandatory on the part of cable or satellite operators.\n\n8 These rules are found in Part 76 of the FCCâs rules. For a description of these rules, see\n\nthe FCC Retransmission Consent Report, at footnote 8 and at paras. 17-30.\n\n9 Commercial television station licensees are entitled to protect the network programming\n\nthey have contracted for by exercising non-duplication rights against more distant television\n\nbroadcast stations carried on a local cable television system that serves more than 1,000\n\nsubscribers. Commercial broadcast stations may assert these non-duplication rights\n\nregardless of whether or not their signals are being transmitted by the local cable system and\n\nregardless of when, or if, the network programming is scheduled to be broadcast. Generally,\n\nthe zone of protection for such programming cannot exceed 35 miles for stations licensed\n\nto a community in the Commissionâs list of top 100 television markets or 55 miles for\n\nstations licensed to communities in smaller television markets. In addition, a cable operator\n\ndoes not have to delete the network programming of any station which the Commission has\n\npreviously recognized as significantly viewed in the cable community.\n\n10 With respect to non-network programming, cable systems that serve at least 1,000\n\nsubscribers may be required, upon proper notification, to provide syndicated protection to\n\nbroadcasters who have contracted with program suppliers for exclusive exhibition rights to\n\ncertain programs within specific geographic areas, whether or not the cable system affected\n\nis carrying the station requesting this protection. However, no cable system is required to\n\ndelete a program broadcast by a station that either is significantly viewed or places a Grade\n\nB or better contour over the community of the cable system.\n\n11 A cable system located within 35 miles of the city of license of a broadcast station where\n\na sporting event is taking place may not carry the live television broadcast of the sporting\n\nevent on its system if the event is not available live on a local television broadcast station,\n\nif the holder of the broadcast rights to the event, or its agent, requests such a blackout. The\n\nholder of the rights is responsible for notifying the cable operator of its request for program\n\ndeletion at least the Monday preceding the calendar week during which the deletion is\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-4\n\nthe terms found in most network-affiliate contracts and station-\n\nsyndicator contracts, limit the ability of a cable operator that has not\n\nbeen able to reach a retransmission consent negotiation with a local\n\nbroadcaster that transmits network or syndicated programming to\n\nimport the same programming from a more distant broadcaster.\n\n! the local-into-local and distant signal provisions in various\n\nstatutes that govern the carriage of television broadcast signals by\n\nsatellite operators,12 which define which households are eligible to\n\nreceive distant broadcast network signals and local network signals\n\nand include several copyright provisions. Under the Satellite Home\n\nViewer Act, direct-to-home satellite providers were granted a\n\ncompulsory copyright license to retransmit television signals of\n\ndistant networks stations to unserved households and to retransmit\n\nsignals of certain non-network broadcast stations (called\n\nâsuperstationsâ) to any household. The Satellite Home Viewer\n\nImprovement Act created a new statutory copyright license for\n\nsatellite carriage of stations to any subscriber within a stationâs local\n\nmarket, without distinction between network and non-network\n\nsignals or served or unserved households.\n\n! cable-related statutory copyright provisions, which set specific\n\nterms, conditions, and rates, including mandatory licenses, for\n\ncertain uses of programming.13 For example, cable systems enjoy a\n\nroyalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license â that is, do\n\nnot have to pay copyright fees â for the carriage of broadcast\n\nsignals of stations located in their local market areas (called\n\nâdesignated market areasâ or DMAs). But cable systems are\n\nrequired to pay royalties under a congressionally granted compulsory\n\n11 (...continued)\n\ndesired. If no television broadcast station is licensed to the community in which the sports\n\nevent is taking place, the 35-mile blackout zone extends from the broadcast stationâs\n\nlicensed community with which the sports event or team is identified. If the event or local\n\nteam is not identified with any particular community (for instance, the New England\n\nPatriots), the 35-mile blackout zone extends from the community nearest the sports event\n\nwhich has a licensed broadcast station. The sports blackout rule does not apply to cable\n\ntelevision systems serving less than 1,000 subscribers, nor does it require deletion of a sports\n\nevent on a broadcast stationâs signal that was carried by a cable system prior to March 31,\n\n1972. The rule does not apply to sports programming carried on non-broadcast program\n\ndistribution services such as ESPN. These services, however, may be subject to private\n\ncontractual blackout restrictions.\n\n12 Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988 (SHVA), P.L. 100-667, 102 Stat. 3935, Title II;\n\nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA), P.L. 106-113, 113 Stat. 1501,\n\n1501A-526 to 1501A-545; and Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act\n\nof 2004 (SHVERA), P.L. 108-447, 118 Stat. 2809. For a discussion of these rules governing\n\nsatellite carriage of local and distant signals, see CRS Report RS22175, Satellite Television:\n\nProvisions in SHVERA Affecting Eligibility for Distant and Local Analog Network Signals,\n\nby Julie Jennings.\n\n13 Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 111, 119, and 122).\n\nCRS-5\n\ncopyright license for the carriage of the signals of broadcasters\n\nlocated outside the DMA within which the cable system is located.\n\nThe royalty-free license extends to the secondary transmission of\n\nout-of-DMA broadcast stations, however, if it can be shown that\n\nthose out-of-DMA signals are âsignificantly viewedâ by those\n\nhouseholds within the cable systemâs service area that only receive\n\ntheir television signals over-the-air.\n\n! the commercial leased access requirements in section 612 of the\n\nCommunications Act, which require a cable operator to set aside\n\nchannel capacity for commercial use by video programmers\n\nunaffiliated with the operator.14\n\n! the program carriage provisions in section 616 of the\n\nCommunications Act directing the FCC to establish regulations\n\ngoverning program carriage agreements and related practices\n\nbetween cable operators or other MVPDs and programmers that\n\n14 Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Sec. 612 (47 U.S.C. Â§ 532). This statutory\n\nframework for commercial leased access was first established by the Cable Communictions\n\nPolicy Act of 1984 (P.L 98-549, 98 Stat. 2779). Cable operators with fewer than 36\n\nchannels must set aside channels for commercial use only if required to do so by a franchise\n\nagreement in effect as of the enactment of Sec. 612. Operators with 36 to 54 activated\n\nchannels must set aside 10% of those channels not otherwise required for use or prohibited\n\nfrom use by federal law or regulation. Operators with 55 to 100 activated channels must set\n\naside 15% of those channels not otherwise required for use or prohibited from use by federal\n\nlaw or regulation. Cable operators with more than 100 activated channels must designate\n\n15% of such channels for commercial use. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and\n\nCompetition Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-385) established new rules, modifying Sec. 612, that\n\nrequired the FCC to (a) determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable operator may\n\nestablish for commercial use of designated channel capacity; (b) establish reasonable terms\n\nand conditions for such use, including those for billing and collections; and (c) establish\n\nprocedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage. In\n\nimplementing the statutory directive to determine maximum reasonable rates for leased\n\naccess, the Commission adopted a maximum rate formula for full-time carriage on\n\nprogramming tiers and for Ã la carte services, and a prorated rate for part-time programming.\n\nOne condition of the FCCâs approval of the transfer of licenses of the bankrupt Adelphia\n\nCommunications Corporation to Comcast Corporation and Time Warner Inc., is that if an\n\nunaffiliated programming network is unable to reach an agreement pursuant to the\n\nCommissionâs commercial leased access rules with Comcast or Time Warner, that network\n\nmay elect commercial arbitration of the dispute, where the arbitrator would be directed to\n\nresolve the dispute using the rate formula specified in the Commissionâs rules. Another\n\ncondition allows an unaffiliated regional sports network that is unable to reach a carriage\n\nagreement with Comcast or Time Warner to elect commercial arbitration of the dispute. See\n\nIn the Matter of Applications for Consent to the Assignment and/or Transfer of Control of\n\nLicenses: Adelphia Communications Corporation (and subsidiaries, debtors-in-possession),\n\nAssignors, to Time Warner Cable Inc. (subsidiaries), Assignees; Adelphia Communications\n\nCorporation (and subsidiaries, debtors-in-possession), Assignors and Transferors, to\n\nComcast Corporation (subsidiaries), Assignees and Transferees; Comcast Corporation,\n\nTransferor, to Time Warner Inc., Transferee; Time Warner Inc., Transferor, to Comcast\n\nCorporation, Transferee, Memorandum Opinion and Order, adopted July 13, 2006, released\n\nJuly 21, 2006, at paras. 109 and 181.\n\nCRS-6\n\nwould prevent an MVPD from requiring a financial interest in a\n\nprogram service as a condition for carriage, from coercing a\n\nprogrammer to grant exclusive carriage rights, or from\n\ndiscriminating against an unaffiliated programmer in a fashion that\n\nunreasonably restrains the ability of that programmer to compete,\n\nwhen the programming is distributed over satellite.15\n\n! the requirements for nondiscriminatory access to programming\n\nin which a cable operator has an attributable interest in section\n\n628 of the Communications Act, which directs the FCC to establish\n\nrules to prevent a vertically integrated cable operator from\n\ndiscriminating in the prices, terms, and conditions at which it makes\n\nits programming available to non-affiliated MVPDs or have\n\nexclusive access to the programming in which it has an attributable\n\ninterest.16 But these prohibitions do not hold if the vertically\n\nintegrated companyâs programming is distributed over terrestrial\n\nfacilities (for example, over broadband lines), an exception that\n\nfrequently applies to regional sports networks and potentially could\n\napply to all cable program networks as broadband fiber optic cable\n\nbecomes more widely deployed. This exception has been termed by\n\nsome the âterrestrial loophole.â\n\n15 Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Sec. 616 (47 U.S.C. Â§ 536).\n\n16 Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Sec. 628 (47 U.S.C. Â§ 548). When\n\nNewsCorp, which owns many cable networks, acquired from Hughes Electronic Corporation\n\na large ownership interest in DirecTV, thus creating a vertically integrated programmer-\n\ndistributor entity, the FCC conditioned the transfer of the spectrum licenses upon a\n\nagreement to abide by the same non-discrimination requirements, even though the new\n\ncompany would not have been so required under the existing statutory provisions. (In the\n\nMatter of General Motors Corporation and Hughes Electronic Corporation, Transferors,\n\nand the New Corporation Limited, Transferee, for Authority to Transfer Control,\n\nMemorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 03-330, Appendix F, 2004.) The FCC imposed a\n\nsimilar condition on the transfer of the licenses of the bankrupt Adelphia Communications\n\nCorporation to Time Warner and Comcast. See In the Matter of Applications for Consent\n\nto the Assignment and/or Transfer of Control of Licenses: Adelphia Communications\n\nCorporation (and subsidiaries, debtors-in-possession), Assignors, to Time Warner Cable\n\nInc. (subsidiaries), Assignees; Adelphia Communications Corporation (and subsidiaries,\n\ndebtors-in-possession), Assignors and Transferors, to Comcast Corporation (subsidiaries),\n\nAssignees and Transferees; Comcast Corporation, Transferor, to Time Warner Inc.,\n\nTransferee; Time Warner Inc., Transferor, to Comcast Corporation, Transferee,\n\nMemorandum Opinion and Order, adopted July 13, 2006, released July 21, 2006, at\n\nAppendix B.\n\nCRS-7\n\n! the broadcast ownership rules17 and cable ownership rules18,\n\nwhich can affect the relative negotiating strength of programmers\n\nand distributors by restricting or allowing their reach in national or\n\nlocal markets. For example, some parties have argued that changes\n\nin broadcast ownership rules that allow broadcasters to own more\n\nthan one television station in a market has significantly strengthened\n\nthe retransmission consent bargaining position of those broadcasters\n\nthat own or control more than one station in a local market.19\n\n! certain statutory exemptions from the antitrust laws for sports\n\nleagues.20\n\nRecently, there have been more frequent incidents of programmers and MVPDs\n\nfailing to reach contractual agreements, and in several instances one or the other party\n\nâ or end users who were affected by the impasse â have sought federal\n\ngovernment intervention either at the FCC or with Congress. The parties seeking\n\nintervention often propose modification of existing statutory provisions or regulatory\n\nrequirements that allegedly favor one side in the negotiations or undermine the\n\nsuccessful consummation of negotiations. Although these impasses have involved\n\na number of different issues, the most controversial (and widely publicized) conflicts\n\nhave involved unresolved retransmission consent negotiations.\n\n17 The FCC has long regulated broadcast ownership as a means of promoting diversity,\n\ncompetition, and localism in the media without regulating the content of broadcast speech,\n\npursuant to sections 307, 308, 309(a), and 310(d) of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. Â§Â§\n\n307, 308, 309(a), 310(d)), which authorize the Commission to grant and renew broadcast\n\nstation licenses in the public interest.\n\n18 Section 613(f) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992\n\namended the Communications Act of 1934, directing the FCC to conduct proceedings to\n\nestablish reasonable limits on the number of subscribers a cable operator may serve\n\n(horizontal limit) and the number of channels a cable operator may devote to its affiliated\n\nprogramming networks (vertical, or channel occupancy limit). Congress intended the\n\nstructural ownership limits mandated by Section 613(f) to ensure that cable operators did\n\nnot use their dominant position in the MVPD market, acting unilaterally or jointly, to\n\nunfairly impede the flow of video programming to consumers. (47 U.S.C. Â§ 533(f))\n\n19 See, for example, Linda Moss and Mike Farrell, âDueling for Dollars,â Multichannel\n\nNewswire, March 5, 2007, available at [http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=\n\narticlePrint&articleid=CA6421302], viewed on June 28, 2007.\n\n20 In its 1922 ruling in Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore v. National Baseball Clubs, the\n\nSupreme Court ruled that baseball is a sport subject to state regulations, not a business\n\ninvolved in interstate commerce that would be subject to the federal antitrust laws.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court acknowledged in its 1953 decision in Toolson v. New York\n\nYankees, Inc. and again in its 1972 decision in Flood v. Kuhn that the baseballâs antitrust\n\nexemption was âan anomaly,â it ruled that it is up to Congress to change baseballâs antitrust\n\nexemption. Other sports leagues do not enjoy the same broad antitrust exemption as\n\nbaseball. But the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 (15 U.S.C. 1291) created a limited\n\nantitrust exemption that allows a league to negotiate the broadcasting rights for all the teams\n\nin a football, baseball, basketball, or hockey league. The act was amended in 1966 to\n\nexempt the combining of any professional football leagues.\n\nCRS-8\n\nThere are three basic functional components to the provision of video\n\nprogramming: producing content; assembling content into a programming package,\n\nsuch as a network, that can be efficiently distributed; and distributing the\n\nprogramming to end users. (For convenience, in this report, the content assembler\n\nis called a programmer.)\n\nIn most cases, the programmer is a media company that packages individual\n\nprograms or program series to create an over-the-air broadcast network or a cable\n\nnetwork. That programmer may or may not own the production studio or sports team\n\nwhere the creative talent (actors, directors, athletes, etc.) directly produces the\n\ncontent, that is, may or may not vertically integrate âbackwardsâ into direct\n\nproduction. On occasion, a sports team or league will vertically integrate forward by\n\npackaging its own games and other programming into a network under its own brand\n\nname (for example, a National Football League, Major League Baseball, or Yankees\n\nnetwork). Also, sometimes a company is both a programmer and a distributor. For\n\nexample, while an over-the-air broadcaster is just a programmer for the majority of\n\nhouseholds that receive their video programs from an MVPD, it is also a distributor\n\nof that programming to the minority of households that continue to receive their\n\nprogramming over-the-air. Similarly, most of the large MVPDs have vertically\n\nintegrated backward and now have partial or total equity interests in some of the\n\ncable networks distributed over their cable or satellite systems. Several MVPDs also\n\nown sports teams (for example, Cablevision owns the New York Knicks) and thus\n\nare content producers, as well. Moreover, the large media companies that own\n\nbroadcast networks also own cable networks and often tie distributor access to their\n\nbroadcast networks to agreement to carry some of their cable networks.\n\nAlthough existing statutory rules give the local broadcast station the right to\n\nnegotiate the terms under which it makes its programming available for\n\nretransmission by MVPDs, many of those local broadcasters are affiliated with a\n\nnational television network and, in their affiliation agreements with the national\n\nnetwork, give the network the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent.\n\nMoreover, increasingly the negotiations between large programmers and large\n\ndistributors also involve video-on-demand rights to large portions of the\n\nprogrammerâs library of content, as well as provisions setting conditions on how the\n\nprogrammer can make its programming available for Internet, cellphone, and other\n\nnew avenues of distribution. In addition, during the transition from analog to digital\n\ntransmission and the initial deployment of high definition technology, programmer-\n\ndistributor negotiations increasingly involve issues of whether a program will be\n\ncarried in multiple formats (analog and digital, high definition and standard\n\ndefinition) and whether a network will be placed on an analog or digital tier.\n\nThe relationship between programmer and distributor is characterized by mutual\n\nneed â the programmers need distributors that have direct contact with the potential\n\naudience; the distributor needs programmers with good content to attract subscribers.\n\nAt the same time, there is an inherent tension as each seeks to capture the lionâs share\n\nof the value that consumers place on that content. Each must weigh the potential loss\n\nif an impasse occurs and the programmer refuses to permit the distributor to carry the\n\nprogramming or if the distributor chooses not to carry the programming. For\n\nexample, for the programmer that potential loss could take the form of foregone\n\ncompensation from the MVPD and/or foregone advertising revenues as advertisers\n\nCRS-9\n\nrespond to a reduced audience,21 both of which could be substantial if the MVPDâs\n\nsubscribers represent a significant portion of the programmerâs total audience and if\n\nthose subscribers do not switch to another MVPD that does carry the programmerâs\n\nnetwork. For the distributor, that potential loss could take the form of foregone\n\nsubscriber revenue if, without the programming as part of its offering, some end users\n\nshift to a competing MVPD, as well as foregone advertising revenues. The losses\n\ncould be substantial if many subscribers switched to a competing MVPD. Given\n\nthese risks, negotiating impasses usually are avoided. Over time, market forces have\n\nled to the adoption of business models that serve content providers, programmers,\n\nand distributors.\n\nBut these business models represent an unstable equilibrium. When market\n\nconditions that affect the relative negotiating strength of programmers and\n\ndistributors change, the newly strengthened party typically attempts to change the\n\nprevailing business model to its advantage. That is happening today. Programmers\n\nare taking advantage of structural market changes favorable to them to pressure\n\nMVPDs to make cash payments for programming that up till now was available\n\neither for free or for non-cash considerations (or, where cash payments have been\n\nmade in the past, to make higher cash payments). Some MVPDs have had sufficient\n\ncountervailing market power to resist, or limit, these changes, but others have not.\n\nThis had led to calls by the smaller, often rural, MVPDs for modifications to the\n\nretransmission consent rules and other federal rules that allegedly favor programmers\n\nâ and, in particular, local broadcast stations â in their negotiations with\n\ndistributors.\n\nMarket Changes Affecting the Programmer-\n\nDistributor Relationship\n\nThe increase in programmer-distributor conflicts is, in large part, the result of\n\nseveral structural changes in the video market that are affecting the relative\n\nnegotiating strengths of the various parties and hence undermining prevailing\n\nbusiness models and affecting the availability and pricing of video programming for\n\nconsumers.\n\nMore Distribution Options\n\nThe most significant structural change is the increase in the number of program\n\ndistribution options. Today, programmers can distribute their product not only\n\nthrough traditional broadcast television stations and cable operators, but also through\n\ndirect broadcast satellite operators and other satellite companies, the new\n\n21 Kagan Research reported in Economics of Basic Cable Networks, 2006 (at p. 5) that the\n\nadvertiser-supported cable networks had gross advertising revenues of $13.7 billion and also\n\nhad license fee revenues of $13.7 billion in 2004. Kagan projected that in 2009 those totals\n\nwould be $25.4 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively. In contrast, broadcast networks\n\nhistorically have received almost all of their revenues from advertising, not from per\n\nsubscriber fees imposed on MVPDs. Broadcaster attempts to increase those per subscriber\n\nfees have been at the core of the recent broadcaster-MVPD retransmission consent conflicts.\n\nCRS-10\n\nmultichannel video offerings of the major telephone companies, cable\n\nâoverbuilders,â22 on-line video streams, and even cellular telephones. As a result,\n\nprogrammers have more options available to them to reach audiences and are able to\n\nnegotiate with distributors from a position of strength, often demanding terms,\n\nconditions, and rates that are more favorable to themselves and less favorable to\n\ndistributors than those that have prevailed in the past.23 The market implications are\n\ngreatest for âmust-haveâ programming, such as major sports programming and the\n\nprogramming of the four major broadcast networks, for which a significant portion\n\nof subscribers have a sufficiently strong intensity of demand that they consider\n\ncarriage of that programming a prerequisite for subscribing with an MVPD. An\n\nMVPD that does not offer must-have programming may find itself at a significant\n\ncompetitive disadvantage in the market. By contrast, the prevailing business model\n\nwas developed â and some of the programmer-distributor contracts that are\n\ncurrently expiring were negotiated â in the early and mid 1990s, when cable\n\noperators typically were the monopoly MVPD in their service area and therefore had\n\ncountervailing market power when negotiating with programmers, even programmers\n\nwith must-have programming.\n\nOne group of distributors â small and mid-sized cable companies â has been\n\nplaced in a particularly difficult position by this structural market change. They often\n\nface direct competition from the two major satellite companies, DirecTV and DISH\n\nNetwork. These cable companies have far fewer subscribers than the major satellite\n\ncompanies and thus when negotiating with programmers typically do not pose a\n\nserious risk to the programmers if there is an impasse and the programming is not\n\ncarried; a programmerâs foregone per subscriber fees from the cable companies and\n\nforegone advertising revenues would not be substantial. By contrast, a programmerâs\n\nrevenues could be significantly reduced if one of the satellite companies discontinued\n\ncarriage, since each of the satellite carriers have more than 13 million subscribers.24\n\nMoreover, many of the smaller cable companies have limited or no ability to offer\n\ntelephone and broadband access services and therefore limited ability to offer\n\nbundled video/telephone/broadband services that tend to foster customer retention\n\neven when favored programming is no longer carried. Thus, if an impasse were to\n\noccur, a smaller cable company would face significant risk of losing subscribers to\n\nsatellite companies. In fact, where a smaller cable company has had an impasse with\n\na programmer, sometimes the programmer or a satellite company that has a\n\nretransmission agreement with the programmer (and competes against the cable\n\ncompany) has offered a âbountyâ of up to $200 to households to switch to the\n\n22 These are companies that have been awarded franchises by local franchising authorities\n\nand have built their own wireline networks in areas already served by an incumbent cable\n\noperator. These overbuilders frequently offer broadband access service as well as cable\n\nservice and often serve smaller geographic areas than the incumbent cable operator,\n\nsometimes serving only high-rise buildings.\n\n23 For example, a Sinclair Broadcast Group executive reportedly has stated that as cable,\n\nsatellite, and telephone companies all seek to distribute Sinclairâs broadcast signals, Sinclair\n\nhas more bargaining power than it had in the past. See Joe Morris, âCable, WCHA at Odds:\n\nBroadcast Dispute Might Go To Court,â Charleston Gazette, July 7, 2006, at p. 1.C.\n\n24 This is a greater concern for a national programmer (such as a cable network or a\n\nbroadcast network) than for a local programmer (such as a local broadcast station).\n\nCRS-11\n\nsatellite service, with these offers marketed over the programmerâs network while the\n\nprogrammer-cable company negotiations are still on-going.25\n\nIronically, the market consequence of greater competition in the distribution of\n\nvideo programming appears to be greater negotiating leverage for programmers with\n\npopular â and especially must-have â programming, resulting in higher\n\nprogramming prices that MVPDs tend to pass through at least partially to subscribers.\n\nConsolidation and Clustering of Cable Operators\n\nAt the same time that additional distribution options have become available to\n\nvideo programmers, consolidation (acquisitions resulting in a small number of large\n\nfirms serving an increasing portion of total subscribers, nationwide) and clustering\n\n(acquisitions resulting in individual firms serving an increasing portion of subscribers\n\nin a particular local market) are occurring among cable operators and the two major\n\nsatellite operators are growing, so that the largest video distributors are serving a\n\nhigher share of total MVPD subscribers than they have in the past and the large cable\n\noperatorsâ serving areas have become increasingly concentrated into a small number\n\nof very large clusters. These trends are the result of acquisitions by the large cable\n\ncompanies of smaller cable companies, swaps among cable systems of local cable\n\nsystems that have allowed single companies to become the dominant cable provider\n\nin metropolitan statistical areas or beyond, and successful market growth by the two\n\nlarge DBS operators, DirecTV and DISH Network.\n\nTable 1 lists the 25 largest cable operators, which are often referred to as\n\nmultiple system operators or MSOs, and the number of subscribers they had as of\n\nDecember 2006. It is noteworthy that the largest MSO, Comcast, had almost as\n\nmany subscribers as numbers 3 through 25 combined.\n\n25 It is not always clear whether it is the satellite company or the programmer that is actually\n\npaying the customer to switch MVPD. For example, when Sinclair Broadcast Group and\n\nMediacom Communications were in an impasse in retransmission consent negotiations late\n\nin 2006, Mike Wilson, the general manager of Sinclairâs Fox 17 station in Iowa issued a\n\nstatement to viewers, stating in part that âthe termination of our relationship with Mediacom\n\nneed not limit your ability to continue to watch us.... you may choose to subscribe to either\n\nDirecTV or to the Dish Network, both of which will continue to carry FOX 17. We\n\nparticularly encourage you to call DirecTV ... because if you sign up with them prior to\n\nDecember 1, 2006 and comply with certain requirements, FOX 17 WILL PAY YOU $150\n\n(which will be applied as a rebate against your DirecTV bill, which will be applied as fifteen\n\n$10 rebates against each of your first 15 monthly DirecTV bills)!â The Wilson statement\n\nis available at [http://www.longren.org/2006/10/30/more-on-mediacom-vs-sinclair/], viewed\n\non June 27, 2007.\n\nCRS-12\n\nTable 1.

(An individual cable cluster most likely consists\n\nof multiple cable franchises negotiated with many local jurisdictions.) In the early\n\nyears of the cable industry, most of the larger firms bidding for cable franchises did\n\nnot focus their efforts on narrow geographic regions. As a result, the larger cable\n\noperators tended to have cable franchise that were widely scattered geographically.\n\nSubsequently, many of these large firms traded franchises, to develop clusters in a\n\nsmaller number of geographic areas. Clustering provides economies of scale in\n\noperations, marketing, and customer service. It also strengthens a cable operatorâs\n\nretransmission consent negotiating position with broadcasters, who are less likely to\n\nrisk the foregone subscriber fees and advertising revenues from an impasse with (and\n\ndiscontinued signal carriage by) a cable operator if that operator serves a large\n\nportion of the broadcasterâs serving area.\n\n26 According to the 2006 10-K reports filed by DirecTV and EchoStar Communications (the\n\nparent of DISH Network) with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of\n\nDecember 31, 2006, DirecTV had approximately 16 million subscribers in the U.S. (at p.\n\n3) and DISH Network had 13.105 million subscribers (at p. 1).\n\nCRS-13\n\nThere are 113 cable clusters serving at least 100,000 subscribers.27 But 102 of\n\nthose clusters are owned by the five largest cable operators and only two are owned\n\nby cable operators that are not among the 10 largest.\n\nCable system consolidation and clustering have different programmer-\n\ndistributor negotiating implications when the programmer has national reach (for\n\nexample, a national cable program network or a national broadcast network) vs. local\n\nreach (for example, a local broadcast station). As explained below, consolidation\n\nincreases the leverage of a cable system relative to national program networks, while\n\nclustering increases the leverage of a cable system relative to local broadcast stations.\n\nNegotiating with a cable program network.\n\nCable program networks get approximately half their revenues from per\n\nsubscriber fees imposed on MVPDs and half from advertising.28 And those\n\nadvertising fees depend on the number of subscribers reached, so the more\n\nsubscribers an MVPD reaches, the more valuable that MVPD is to the program\n\nnetwork. Cable program networks that fail to achieve substantial penetration on\n\nMVPD systems face financial peril. In recent proceedings at the FCC, parties have\n\nfiled comments asserting that in order to generate the advertising revenues necessary\n\nfor success, a national program network must reach between 40 and 60 million, and\n\nperhaps as many as 75 million, subscribers.29 Carriage on the major MVPD systems\n\nâ Comcast, Time Warner, DirecTV, and DISH Network â therefore is key to cable\n\nprogram network success. Cable network business strategies therefore focus on\n\nobtaining and retaining such carriage. For a new cable network, that might involve\n\ngiving one of the major MVPDs an equity interest in exchange for carriage. For an\n\nestablished cable network with a strong brand identity, that might involve creating\n\na sister network and demanding of MVPDs carriage of the new network in lieu of\n\ncash for carriage of the established network. But even an established program\n\nnetwork is unlikely to risk a negotiating impasse that results in discontinued carriage\n\nby any of those large MVPDs.\n\nThe 20 most widely distributed advertiser-supported cable program networks\n\neach are available to more than 90,000,000 households via MVPD subscription.30\n\n27 Kagan Research, Broadband Cable Financial Databook, 26th edition, 2006, at pp. 27-28.\n\n28 See footnote 21above.\n\n29 See In the Matter of Applications for Consent to the Assignment and/or Transfer of\n\nControl of Licenses: Adelphia Communications Corporation (and subsidiaries, debtors-in-\n\npossession), Assignors, to Time Warner Cable Inc.

While cable program networks will seek\n\ncarriage on all MVPDs, as the subscriber reach of the MVPD falls, the financial risk\n\nto a cable program network provider of failing to reach a carriage arrangement with\n\nthe MVPD falls. This may make it easier for the cable network provider to push\n\nharder for a high per subscriber fee from a smaller MVPD. From the perspective of\n\na small or mid-sized cable operator, however, failing to reach a carriage arrangement\n\nfor a relatively popular cable program network that is carried by DirecTV and/or\n\nDISH Network can be risky. Thus, a cable operatorâs negotiating position vis-a-vis\n\ncable network programmers will be strengthened by consolidation.\n\nNegotiating with a national broadcast network.\n\nWhen a local broadcast station that is affiliated to a broadcast network has\n\nassigned its retransmission consent rights to the network, the negotiations between\n\nthe network and the MVPDs are likely to be somewhat akin to those between large\n\ncable programmers and MVPDs â with the national subscriber reach of the MVPD\n\nan important factor. The major broadcast networks own both multiple broadcast\n\nstreams and cable networks, and are likely to seek compensation in some\n\ncombination of: the MVPDâs carriage (and tier placement) of other program\n\nnetworks owned by the broadcaster, the MVPDâs purchase of advertising time on the\n\nbroadcast station, the broadcaster being given free advertising time on the MVPDâs\n\nsystem, and cash payments. The broadcast networks, in offering the most popular\n\nprogramming, enjoy an even stronger negotiating position than most cable program\n\nnetworks, but even the major broadcast networks are unlikely to want to risk an\n\nimpasse with a large MVPD that serves 10 million or more subscribers.\n\nNegotiating with a local broadcast station or non-network\n\nbroadcast group.\n\nThe negotiating dynamic may be quite different when a broadcast station is\n\nconducting its own negotiations with MVPDs â which appears to be happening\n\nmore often these days. In this situation, the broadcasterâs reach is limited to the local\n\nmarket in which its station is located or, in the case of a station that is part of a non-\n\nnetwork broadcast group, the local markets in which the group has stations. Its\n\nconcern will not be with the total subscriber reach of the MVPDs with which it is\n\nnegotiating, but rather with the subscriber reach of those MVPDs within the local\n\nmarkets in which the group has stations. DBS operators are likely to offer service in\n\nmany or all of those markets, but an individual cable company, even one as large as\n\nComcast or Time Warner, is unlikely to operate in all those local markets. What\n\nbecomes most important, then, is whether the cable company is clustered in the\n\n30 (...continued)\n\n[http://www.ncta.com/ContentView.aspx?contentId=74], viewed on June 28, 2007.\n\n31 Moreover, these cable program networks most likely have attained carriage on the most\n\nbasic tier offered by these MVPDs â that is, the one with largest number of subscribers, for\n\nexample, the âtop 60â tier, rather than the âtop 120â tier.\n\nCRS-15\n\nmarket or markets in which the broadcaster has stations. There are many cable\n\nclusters that serve a substantial portion of the households in the local broadcast\n\nmarkets in which they are located. In these situations, the local broadcasters are less\n\nlikely to risk a negotiating impasse with the clustered cable company and therefore\n\nlikely to face constraints on the demands they can make for retransmission consent\n\ncompensation.\n\nCharter Communications CEO Neil Smit has stated that actions it has taken to\n\nincrease the densities of its existing clusters have strengthened its position in\n\nretransmission consent negotiations, making it more difficult for station groups to\n\nplay hardball given that they would put greater portions of their ad revenues at\n\nstake.32 One industry observer has described this negotiating situation as follows:\n\nCable operators have more clout than telcos and even DBS. Cable operators are\n\nbig enough in major markets to take a broadcaster dark in 60%-80% of local\n\nhomes overnight. That would guarantee immediate pain as major advertisers\n\ncancel. But a DBS operator might serve just 10%-20% of local homes so it can\n\ninflict far less pain. Telcos are in the weakest position.33\n\nMore Program Networks/Fragmented Audiences\n\nAnother major structural market change has been the dramatic expansion in the\n\nnumber of program networks (sometimes referred to as channels) available to\n\nconsumers, with a resulting fall in average audience size per channel. The number\n\nof video channels received by the average U.S. household increased from 18.8\n\nchannels in 1985 to 104.2 channels in 2006, but neither the number of television\n\nhouseholds nor the average household viewing time per day increased nearly so\n\ndramatically during that period.34 Thus the average audience size per program\n\nnetwork has fallen substantially.\n\nThis proliferation in program networks has had two general market implications.\n\nOn the one hand, the typical program network has an audience share of less than 1%,\n\nand unless its programming has very strong appeal to a subset of subscribers who\n\nwould be willing to pay separately for that programming, is not likely to command\n\n32 See Mike Farrell, âSmit: Charter System Sales Could Help Retrans Talks,â Multichannel\n\nNewswire, March 7, 2007, available at [http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=\n\narticlePrint&articleid=CA6422613], viewed on June 27, 2007.\n\n33 John M.

It may well be that if such a\n\nprogram network is not affiliated with an MVPD or with a major programmer it will\n\nhave to rely on the commercial leased access rules and pay to gain access to an\n\nMVPD.35\n\nOn the other hand, the relatively few program networks that attract larger\n\naudiences are valuable to MVPDs for two reasons. First, a program network that\n\nattracts a larger audience is, other things equal, likely to have more viewers who\n\nmight choose among competing MVPDs based on the availability of that networkâs\n\nprogramming; there is greater business risk to MVPDs not to carry that program\n\nnetwork. Second, larger audiences tend to attract more advertising revenues for the\n\nMVPD.\n\nAccording to Kagan Research, in 2005, of the several hundred advertising-\n\nsupported cable networks, only 8 received from MVPDs average monthly license\n\nfees of 40 cents or more per subscriber, only 24 received fees of 20 cents or more,\n\nonly 51 received fees of 10 cents or more, and only 112 received fees of 2 cents or\n\nmore.36 Clearly, the current price-driven programmer-distributor impasses do not\n\ndirectly involve the vast majority of program networks; programmers cannot\n\ncommand significant price increases for them and, in any case, losing the right to\n\ncarry such a program network is unlikely to result in significant subscriber migration\n\nto competing MVPDs.\n\nSome program networks, however, remain extremely valuable to MVPDs and,\n\nin fact, in some ways network proliferation has increased the value of these networks,\n\neven if their audience share has shrunk over time. Although the major broadcast\n\nnetworksâ share of U.S. television household usage has fallen substantially over time,\n\nthey continue to capture relatively large audiences. More than 25% of all television\n\nusage (including usage to watch VCRs and to play video games) is spent viewing the\n\nnational programming offered by the four major broadcast networks and the local and\n\nsyndicated programming offered by those networksâ local broadcast station affiliates,\n\nand that is projected to continue to approach 25% of all usage at the end of the\n\ndecade.37 Since both the national programming and the local programming offered\n\nby these major network affiliates attract such relatively large audiences, an MVPD\n\nin a market where there is competition from other MVPDs could find itself at risk of\n\nlosing substantial numbers of subscribers if a contract negotiation impasse resulted\n\nin it not carrying the programming of one of those affiliates.\n\n35 See footnote 14 above.\n\n36 Kagan Research, The Economics of Basic Cable Networks, 2006, 12th Annual Edition,\n\n2005, at pp. 58-60.\n\n37 Media Dynamics, Inc., TV Dimensions 2006, Annual Report. The usage shares attributed\n\nto broadcast networks covers their network-originated programming. The usage shares\n\nattributed to network affiliates covers their locally-originated programming plus syndicated\n\nprogramming. The average hours of set usage weekly counts multiple-set usage to different\n\nsources at the same time as separate exposures.\n\nCRS-17\n\nData on the cumulative weekly reach of various program networks also show\n\nthe breadth of viewership enjoyed by the major broadcast networks.38 In any given\n\nweek each of the four major networks is viewed (for at least one ten-minute segment)\n\nby more than 70% of all U.S. television households, while the cable network with the\n\ngreatest weekly cumulative market reach, USA, is viewed by only 37.7% of U.S.\n\ntelevision households.39\n\nMoreover, the four major broadcast networks provide almost all of the most\n\npopular television programs.40 During the 2005-2006 television season, the 100\n\nindividual television programs with the largest audiences all were major broadcast\n\nnetwork programs. Although other broadcast programmers provided shows that\n\nranked among the second one-hundred in ratings, the highest-rated advertiser-\n\nsupported cable network program was ranked 236, the second highest-rated cable\n\nnetwork program was ranked 389. For the foreseeable future the major broadcast\n\nnetworks are likely to continue to provide the lionâs share of the most popular\n\ntelevision programs.\n\nThere often is a timing element to must-have programming that programmers\n\ncan use strategically in their negotiations with distributors. Television households\n\nare far more likely to switch MVPD providers if they fear the loss of particular time-\n\nsensitive programming, such as the Super Bowl, the Olympic Games, the National\n\nFootball League season, or the finale of American Idol or some other extremely\n\npopular series. Some programmers have effectively timed their negotiations with\n\ndistributors to take advantage of such program schedules.41 In some cases,\n\nprogrammers with the rights to sports events have agreed to month-to-month\n\nextensions of lapsed agreements with MVPDs until a time when a key sports event\n\nwas imminent and then used the threat of lost access to that sports event as leverage\n\nto complete a more favorable distribution agreement with the MVPDs.42\n\nDespite the dominance of the four major broadcast networks, at least a dozen\n\ncable networks have succeeded in attracting more than 25% of all television\n\nhouseholds for at least one 10-minute segment each week. Not surprisingly, these\n\ncable networks generally have been able to command larger than average per\n\n38 Nielsen Media Research Television Activity Report, NHI First Quarter 2007, available\n\nat [http://tvb.org/rcentral/mediatrendstrack/tvbasics/ 10_Reach_BdcstvsCable.asp], viewed\n\non June 27, 2007.\n\n39 If the recent decreases in major broadcast network audiences persist, however, the gap\n\nbetween broadcast network reach and cable network reach may shrink.\n\n40 Television Bureau of Advertising, Viewer Track, âTop-rated programs of 2005-06 in\n\nHouseholds,â based on data from Nielsen Galaxy Lightning 9/19/05-5/24/06, Advertising-\n\nSupported Subscription TV only, available at [http://www.tvb.org/central/ViewerTrack/\n\nFullSeason/05-06-season-hh.asp], viewed on June 27, 2007.\n\n41 See, for example, Linda Moss and Mike Farrell, âDueling for Dollars,â Multichannel\n\nNewswire, March 5, 2007, available at [http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=\n\narticlePrint&articleid=CA6421302], viewed on June 27, 2007, which includes a discussion\n\nof how broadcasters have used timing to their negotiating advantage.\n\n42 Id.\n\nCRS-18\n\nsubscriber fees from MVPDs.43 Those networks commanding high per subscriber\n\nlicense fees that did not have broad reach into households tended to fall into one of\n\ntwo categories â sports networks or news networks â that have unique demand\n\ncharacteristics.44\n\nAudience fragmentation also appears to be affecting the relationship between\n\nthe large broadcast networks and their affiliated broadcast stations. Traditionally,\n\nunder the network-affiliate contracts, the networks assumed the retransmission\n\nconsent rights of their affiliates, in exchange for making cash payments to the\n\naffiliates. The broadcast networks then typically negotiated retransmission consent\n\nagreement in which the MVPDs agreed to carry new, or less popular, cable program\n\nnetworks owned by the broadcast networks (for example, MSNBC or ESPN Classic)\n\nas partial compensation for carrying the broadcast network. Recently, the broadcast\n\nnetworks seem to be changing their business strategy, giving back to their affiliate\n\nbroadcast stations the right to negotiate retransmission consent compensation from\n\nMVPDs in exchange for reducing or eliminating the cash payments they make to\n\ntheir affiliate stations. According to a report in Multichannel Newswire:\n\nAnd during the past several years, the âBig Fourâ networks have renegotiated affiliate deals\n\nto eventually eliminate once-lucrative network compensation fees paid to stations to carry\n\nprogramming from ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, those fees began to decline precipitously in 2005,\n\nright around the time that retransmission consent revenue [for the affiliate\n\nstations] began to rise. For example, in 2005, network compensation at Hearst-\n\nArgyle fell 35.9% from $28.8 million to $19.1 million and dipped another 48.7%\n\nin 2006 to $9.8 million.\n\nAt Nexstar, network compensation dipped 22.4% in 2005, to $6.6 million, and fell 36.4%\n\nto $4.2 million in 2006. At Sinclair, the drop-off was less dramatic â 7% in 2005, from\n\n$14.3 million to $13.3 million (the company has not yet released 2006 network\n\ncompensation) â but the station owner expects more dramatic declines in the coming years.\n\nIn its 2005 annual report, Sinclair even went so far as to say that retransmission consent fees\n\nhave âreplaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation.â45\n\nThe trend toward greater program network proliferation and fragmented\n\naudiences is complicated by several significant technologically-driven forces. During\n\nthe transition from analog to digital technology, programmers of both cable networks\n\nand broadcast networks are trying to get MVPDs to carry their programming in both\n\n43 Kagan Research, Economics of Basic Cable Networks, 2006, 12th Annual Edition, 2005,\n\nat p. 58.\n\n44 For example, in an interview that appeared in the May 7, 2007 edition of Broadcasting\n\n& Cable (at pp. 14-16), Jim Bewkes, president and chief operating officer of Time Warner,\n\nstated that about half of CNNâs viewers do not watch any other television, âso if youâre\n\ntrying to reach that audience, you want to reach them there.â\n\n45 Linda Moss and Mike Farrell, âDueling for Dollars,â Multichannel Newswire, March 5,\n\n2007, available at [http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=articlePrint&articleid=\n\nCA6421302], viewed on June 27, 2007.\n\nCRS-19\n\nanalog and digital format â and to carry their digital programming in high definition\n\nas well as standard format. Thus, a single program network now might seek multiple\n\nchannels on an MVPD system to offer analog, digital, and high-definition feeds. At\n\nthe same time, the deployment of digital technology is allowing broadcasters to\n\nprovide multiple digital signals (that is, multiple video programs) on their licensed\n\nspectrum, not just a single signal. A broadcaster that previously provided\n\nprogramming for one channel on an MVPD system now may seek multiple channels,\n\nwhich, depending on how the FCC ultimately implements the must-carry and\n\nretransmission consent rules in a multicast digital environment, could result in a\n\nlarger portion of an MVPDâs system being set aside exclusively for broadcast\n\nprogram networks. Whether these technological changes strengthen the negotiating\n\npositions of programmers or distributors may well depend almost entirely on how the\n\nFCC, or Congress, adopts the must-carry and retransmission consent rules for this\n\nnew environment. In the short run, however, to obtain carriage of multiple signals\n\nin their retransmission consent negotiations with MVPDs, broadcasters may have to\n\ncompromise on other objectives, such as higher cash payments.\n\nCable System Revenue is Growing From High Speed Internet\n\nAccess and Telephone Services\n\nMost cable operators have upgraded their systems over the past decade and now\n\nare able to offer a wide array of services over their broadband networks, including\n\nhigh speed data, telephone, and digital video services, as well as traditional analog\n\nvideo services. The revenue base of the cable system operators is diversifying, with\n\nfastest growth occurring in high speed data, telephone, and digital tier video\n\nservices.46 Most subscribers who select these newer services purchase them as part\n\nof a bundled package with basic cable service. This trend is helping cable operators\n\nin their negotiations with programmers in two ways. First, subscribers who purchase\n\nservice bundles are less likely to switch to a competing MVPD if their current\n\nprovider were to lose carriage of a particular program network, even a popular\n\nnetwork. This is particularly the case if the competing MVPD cannot offer the full\n\narray of services that the cable company does; for example, satellite companies often\n\ncannot offer high speed data and telephone services at a price or uplink speed that is\n\ncompetitive with cable companies. Second, if a cable company is enjoying rapid\n\nrevenue growth from non-video services, it may be more willing to hold the line in\n\nits negotiations with programmers because it is easier to absorb a potential loss of\n\nvideo revenues stemming from an impasse and loss of program carriage when other\n\nrevenues are growing. On the other hand, the revenues generated by these âtriple\n\nplayâ offerings may allow a cable company to pay more for programming.\n\nThere has been an interesting market response to the growth in cable system\n\nrevenues from non-video services. As these new revenue sources have increased the\n\naverage revenue generated per subscribing household (known in the industry as\n\naverage revenue per unit, or ARPU), the value of existing cable systems has grown\n\nand this has been reflected in the price per subscriber at which cable systems have\n\nbeen sold. This, in turn, has affected at least one programmer-distributor negotiation.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, Suddenlink Communications completed the purchase from Charter\n\n46 Kagan Research, Broadband Cable Financial Databook, 26th Edition, 2006, at p. 8.\n\nCRS-20\n\nCommunications of cable systems in West Virginia with 240,000 subscribers,\n\n200,000 of whom live in the Charleston, WV service area of a Sinclair Broadcast\n\nGroup-owned television station (WCHS, an ABC affiliate) and another television\n\nstation (WVAH, a Fox affiliate) for which Sinclair has a local marketing agreement.\n\nThe retransmission consent agreement between Charter and Sinclair had expired\n\nprior to the Suddenlink purchase,47 so Suddenlink entered retransmission consent\n\nnegotiations with Sinclair before the purchase was completed. Sinclair had sought\n\n$4 million in cash payments over three years. But when Sinclair learned that the\n\npurchase price was $800 million, it raised its demand to more than $42 million.\n\nSinclairâs vice president and general counsel reportedly stated that, âIf theyâre paying\n\n$3,200 per sub[scriber], why shouldnât a piece of that be coming to us?â48 This\n\nraises an interesting issue. To the extent the high cable system valuation is a function\n\nof the programming provided by Sinclair, Sinclair would seem to have a strong claim\n\nfor larger cash payments. But to the extent the valuation is not related to Sinclairâs\n\nprogramming, if Sinclair were nonetheless able to command larger cash payments\n\nthat might suggest that the current retransmission consent process may be allowing\n\nprogrammers to siphon off funds that might, from a public policy perspective, be\n\nbetter left to cable operators to expand their broadband infrastructure capabilities.\n\nIssues for Congress: Proposals for Statutory and\n\nRegulatory Change\n\nThe negotiations between programmers and distributors, although private, are\n\nstrongly affected by statutory and regulatory requirements and cannot be properly\n\ncharacterized as free-market. Those requirements were enacted to foster the three\n\npillars of U.S. media policy â localism, diversity of voices, and competition.\n\nCongress tried to craft them in a fashion that would minimize â but not eliminate\n\nâ government intrusion in the market. The specific public policy objectives they\n\nwere intended to further include: fostering local programming, especially local\n\nbroadcast programming; fostering diversity of news and public affairs voices and\n\nentertainment choices; fostering competition in all media markets; encouraging\n\ninnovative programming; keeping cable and satellite subscription rates affordable;\n\nand fostering infrastructure investment. Sometimes government intervention to\n\nfoster one of these objectives will impede another.\n\nIt is possible that, as market conditions have changed, statutes or regulations that\n\ndid not unduly favor one party over another when they were enacted, or that were\n\nintended to favor a party that was viewed as being in a disadvantageous position, now\n\naffect negotiations in an unintended fashion. For example, the various rules relating\n\nto cable carriage of broadcast signals â retransmission consent, network non-\n\nduplication, and syndicated exclusivity rules â were developed at a time when the\n\nlocal cable operator typically was the only MVPD in a broadcasterâs service area and\n\n47 See Mike Farrell, âSuddenlink, Sinclair in Retrans Clash,â Multichannel News, July 5,\n\n2006, available at [http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=articlePrint\n\n&articleID=CA6349903], viewed on June 27, 2007.\n\n48 Mike Farrell, âSuddenlink in Retrans Row,â Multichannel News, July 10, 2006, at p. 8.\n\nCRS-21\n\nthere was concern that cable operators might refuse to carry local signals or in some\n\nother way threaten the viability of local broadcasting. Today, with competitive\n\nprovision of multichannel video services by satellite and telephone systems, the\n\ntables are somewhat turned, and broadcasters with must-have programming often can\n\nnegotiate from a position of strength, especially with cable systems whose\n\nsubscribers do not represent a significant portion of a broadcasterâs audience.\n\nThe earlier discussion of market trends showed there is great variability in the\n\nnegotiating strength of both individual programmers and individual distributors.\n\nAlmost all impasses that resulted in MVPDs not carrying particular programming\n\noccurred outside major markets. Despite the trend toward greater programmer\n\nnegotiating strength, in major markets distributors tend to have enough market clout\n\nto be able to reach agreements they can live with. This is not the case in smaller\n\nmarkets. In this new market environment, it is possible that the âone size fits allâ\n\nregulations currently in place may no longer be fostering the public policy objectives\n\nthey were intended to advance â especially outside major markets. Most of the\n\nproposals for modification of the current statutory and regulatory framework have\n\ncome from parties that operate in smaller markets. In reviewing these proposals, it\n\nis important to consider their potential impact on large markets as well as smaller\n\nmarkets and to try to determine whether any changes should and could be limited to\n\nthose markets where the current statutory and regulatory framework may be failing\n\nto safeguard the public against lost programming or higher prices. Also, it is\n\nimportant to note that the parties that have been proposing statutory or regulatory\n\nchanges often cite the combined impact of multiple rules â for example, the impact\n\nof retransmission consent and program exclusivity rules in markets where a\n\nbroadcaster owns multiple stations that are affiliated to two or more major broadcast\n\nnetworks. Would changing just one of the existing rules resolve alleged existing\n\nproblems or create new ones? Would changing multiple rules represent overkill?\n\nSpecific Proposals to Modify Current Statutes and\n\nRegulations49\n\nMost of the federal statutes and regulations affecting programmer-distributor\n\nnegotiations were enacted before the recent structural market changes and, indeed,\n\nseveral were specifically intended to strengthen the negotiating position of\n\nbroadcasters. Not surprisingly, then, most of the proposals to modify current statutes\n\nand regulations have come from small distributors that are now in a relatively weak\n\nnegotiating position. These proposals include:\n\n! revising the retransmission consent, network non-duplication, and\n\nsyndicated exclusivity rules to allow MVPDs to import distant\n\nsignals when a retransmission consent impasse develops.\n\n! requiring broadcasters to publish rate cards that would apply to all\n\nMVPDs.\n\n49 These proposals are discussed in detail in CRS Report RL34078, Retransmission Consent\n\nand Other Federal Rules Affecting Programmer-Distributor Negotiations: Issues for\n\nCongress, by Charles B. Goldfarb.\n\nCRS-22\n\n! requiring parties to submit to binding arbitration to resolve leased\n\naccess, program carriage, or retransmission consent disputes.\n\n! strengthening the FCC test for what constitutes âgood faithâ\n\nretransmission consent negotiations.\n\n! prohibiting tying arrangements under which programmers require\n\nMVPDs to carry their less popular programming in order to obtain\n\nthe rights to carry their more popular programming.\n\n! requiring programmers to offer their broadcast and cable networks\n\nto distributors on an Ã la carte basis.\n\n! prohibiting programmers from requiring their networks to be placed\n\non the expanded basic service tier.\n\n! prohibiting the ownership or control of more than one television\n\nstation in a market or prohibiting a âduopolyâ owner from tying\n\nretransmission consent for one station to another.\n\n! not requiring MVPDs to get retransmission consent from\n\nbroadcasters if their subscribers have set-top boxes on the customer\n\npremises that can pick up local broadcast station signals directly off\n\nthe air.\n\n! closing the âterrestrial loopholeâ exception to the requirement for\n\nnondiscriminatory access to programming in which a cable operator\n\nhas an attributable interest.\n\n! clarifying the definition of a regional sports network."
