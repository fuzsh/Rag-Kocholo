        "text": "Fox is one of the must-have channels for sports and entertainment. Read on to learn how to watch Fox without cable!\n\nIn a hurry? We provide a ton of information below on the best ways to get Fox without cable. But these are our top picks for streaming it:\n\nHow to Get Fox Without Cable\n\nAs a network with local affiliate stations nationwide, most viewers can watch Fox for free by setting up an OTA antenna. If you haven’t seen what’s coming through antennas in a while, it’s worth looking!\n\nAnother option is a commercial streaming service that provides Fox and other local affiliates and a selection of cable channels. An advantage to these services is that they normally provide access to other Fox channels like Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Weather, and Fox Sports.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nHow To Stream Fox Online\n\nAll streaming services work more or less the same: for a monthly fee, you get access to a package of live TV channels. And you can stream them on pretty much whatever TV or mobile devices you own. But each service is also different — made for different kinds of TV viewers.\n\nWhen it comes to Fox, you need to understand that like the other major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC), it is distributed through a number of affiliated local channels throughout the US. There is no one Fox Channel, so you need a streaming service that provides access to the local Fox channel.\n\nThere is one wrinkle, however. Not all local stations are available everywhere. There are two reasons this can be the case. The area may simply not have a local affiliate. And if it does, there may not currently be a contract between it and a streaming service. But in most cases, the top streaming services will offer the local Fox affiliate.\n\nSo read on to figure out which streaming service is best for you.\n\nFubo: Ideal For Fox Sports Channels\n\nFubo is known for its live sports streaming. In fact, it was started by three friends who wanted to watch international soccer games, which are poorly covered on cable TV even today. They offer 35+ sports channels with their basic plan including ESPN and the NFL Network.\n\nHowever, regardless of its beginnings, Fubo is today one of the best live TV streaming services, offering a wide range of channels, such as HGTV, FX, and Disney.\n\nOne aspect of its focus on sports is that Fubo provides access to local channels and regional sports networks (RSNs). Fox, for example, airs a lot of sports, so Fubo has Fox almost everywhere.\n\nFor $79.99/mo, you get over 180 channels, including all the main Fox cable channels: Fox News, Fox Business, FS1, and FS2. And in most areas, you will get the other major networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and the Spanish-language channels Telemundo, Universo, UniMas, and Univision.\n\nFubo streams on most smart TVs and mobile devices. You can even use it with your Xbox. The base plan comes with 1,000 hours of DVR recording time and the ability to stream on up to ten screens simultaneously.\n\nFind out more about Fubo:\n\nFubo Review\n\nFubo Packages\n\nFubo Local Channels\n\nFubo Devices.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nSling TV: Stream Fox at the Lowest Price\n\nRegarding low-cost streaming, it’s hard to beat Sling TV. They offer two plans for $40.00/mo each (or $55.00/mo together). There are two ways to get Fox with Sling TV: streaming or via antenna.\n\nStreaming Fox With Sling TV\n\nThe Sling Blue plan includes local Fox and NBC affiliates in select markets. What are these? They offer Fox in 18 markets:\n\nSling Blue comes with 40+ other channels besides Fox. These include Fox News and Fox Sports 1 (FS1). If you want Fox Business, you can get it as part of the News Extra add-on for $6/mo — because you just can’t have too many newscasts, right? And you can get FS2 with the Sports Extra add-on for $11/mo. That would total $57/mo for 60+ channels, including NFL RedZone.\n\nFox with OTA Antenna and Sling TV\n\nIf you don’t live in one of the areas listed above, you can still get Fox with Sling TV. They have created their app so that the local channels you get from your antenna are included in your Sling TV guide. No other services offer this kind of integration!\n\nBetter still, if you sign up for two or three months, Sling TV will give you a compatible antenna for reduced cost — or even free!\n\nHere are the details of Sling TV’s offerings:\n\nHere is more information on Sling TV:\n\nSling TV Review\n\nSling TV Packages\n\nSling TV Local Channels\n\nSling TV Devices.\n\nSave 50% on Sling TV Now\n\nDIRECTV STREAM: Great Local Channels Including Fox\n\nIf you are skeptical of cord-cutting, DIRECTV STREAM (deal) has the kind of reputation that may allay your fears. It’s a bit more expensive than other streaming services but provides a solid selection of channels and technology.\n\nFor $79.99/mo, DIRECTV STREAM offers 75+ channels. In almost all areas, this includes the local affiliates of all the networks, including Fox. They also offer several less common affiliates like Univision and The CW.\n\nDIRECTV STREAM features good support for smart TVs and mobile devices. It also provides unlimited cloud DVR storage and simultaneous streams, which makes it particularly good for large households.\n\nFind out more about DIRECTV STREAM:\n\nDIRECTV STREAM Review\n\nDIRECTV STREAM Packages\n\nDIRECTV STREAM Local Channels\n\nDIRECTV STREAM Devices.\n\nGet DIRECTV STREAM Free for 5 Days\n\nHulu + Live TV: Stream Fox Live Along With Great On-Demand Channels\n\nHulu + Live TV is best known for its industry-leading on-demand library of current-run TV shows. However, it also provides an excellent live TV streaming service with ESPN+ and Disney+.\n\nHulu Live offers 100+ channels for $76.99/mo. You will get local network affiliates ABC, CBS, NBC, and especially Fox in almost all locations. If Fox isn’t available with the other streaming services in your area, there’s a good chance it is with Hulu.\n\nHulu + Live TV offers unlimited cloud DVR (9-month storage) and simultaneous streaming on two devices. It supports pretty much any smart TV, mobile device, or game console.\n\nThere is a lot more to Hulu + Live TV. See the following for more information:\n\nHulu + Live TV Review\n\nHulu + Live TV Packages\n\nHulu + Live TV Local Channels\n\nHulu + Live TV Devices.\n\nTry Hulu + Live TV for 3 Days Free!\n\nOther Ways to Stream Fox\n\nThere are other options for streaming Fox without cable:\n\nYouTube TV: a full-service live TV streaming service with 100+ channels, including local ones for $72.99/mo.\n\nFoxNow: This app allows you to watch Fox live and on-demand. However, you must subscribe to a service that provides TV Everywhere access.\n\nHow to Get Fox Via TV Antenna\n\nAs we discussed above, you can get Fox in most areas over-the-air (OTA) via an antenna with Sling TV.\n\nYou can find out if Fox is available where you live using the FCC’s app DTV Reception Maps. Just enter your address, and the app will list all the local stations and their signals’ strength.\n\nSetting up an antenna is easy if you can get Fox OTA where you live. See our guides:\n\nAntenna Buyer’s Guide: Learn what you need and the best models.\n\nMultiple TVs on One Antenna: Step-by-step instructions and background information on antenna installations.\n\nThese articles discuss the use of a wireless tuner. With these, you plug in the antenna, which broadcasts the signal locally. This way, you can use a single antenna on multiple TVs and mobile devices.\n\nTVs and Mobile Devices to Live Stream Fox On\n\nJust like you need a TV to see the channels you get from your cable provider, you need a TV or other streaming devices to see the channels you get from a live TV streaming service. The difference is that there are a lot more devices that are supported by the top streaming services. And this is good news because Fox streams in HD.\n\nAll the streaming services support the major smart TVs and TV devices:\n\nAmazon Fire TV: a device that plugs into a TV’s HDMI input allowing you to run apps for the various streaming services like a Smart TV.\n\nAndroid TV: Google’s operating system (OS) for Smart TVs.\n\nApple TV: Apple’s device plugs into your TV’s HDMI input, making it work like a Smart TV.\n\nRoku: A device that connects to a TV’s HDMI input to make it function like a smart TV.\n\nAll the services also support Samsung Smart TVs. Chromecast, which allows you to send video streams from your smartphone to your TV, is universally supported.\n\nThe services also stream to smartphones and tablets:\n\nAndroid: Google’s mobile OS powering phones and tablets.\n\niOS: Apple’s mobile OS that powers iPhones, iPads, and even some iPods.\n\nMany people stream using gaming systems. All the services except DIRECTV STREAM provide support for the Xbox. If you use the PlayStation, Hulu + Live TV has you covered. It even supports Echo Show. And for VR fans, Sling TV supports Oculus.\n\nFinally, all the services allow you to stream using a web browser. That means you can watch live TV using your laptop. You can connect this computer to your TV if you want to use its larger screen.\n\nYou’ll need to check around if you are using an older or unusual device. But the devices listed above should cover virtually all users and allow them to stream Fox in all its glory.\n\nToday’s Fox Schedule\n\nSee our Fox Schedule page for all the details of what’s playing today.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nFor most TV subscribers, the Fox network is essential. But there are lots of ways to get it without cable. Because it is so important, the major streaming services provide it. But even without that, you can get Fox in HD with an antenna in most locations.\n\nWe recommend Fubo for Fox. But if you are on a budget, check out Sling TV. What are you waiting for? Fubo allows you to try out its service with a free trial.\n\nSign Up for a Free Fubo Trial\n\nSee also: How to Watch Local Channels Without Cable.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I watch Fox for free?\n\nSince Fox is not a cable channel, you can watch it for free.

They are cable channels, so you can’t get them over-the-air with an antenna. But a lot of streaming services offer them. The low-cost Sling TV offers FS1 for just $40.00/mo. Most of the other services offer it as well.\n\nHow do I get local Fox without cable?\n\nFox is a network, so it is broadcast via local affiliates nationwide. There are two ways to get your local Fox affiliate. You can set up an antenna and get the signal over the air. This works well if you are relatively close to a broadcast tower.

However, these cost extra and aren’t included with the basic Prime subscription.\n\nHow do I watch Fox Business without cable?\n\nFox Business Network is a cable channel, so it isn’t available through an antenna.

They normally also provide other sources for breaking news, such as CNN and MSNBC.\n\nHow can I get Fox in my area with an antenna?\n\nFox is available throughout the United States, so you can buy an antenna and plug it into your TV. The only issue is whether there is a good enough signal where you live. For most people, a small indoor antenna will be just fine.
