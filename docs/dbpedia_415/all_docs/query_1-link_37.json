        "text": "Act III Communications, the entertainment company founded by Norman Lear, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell eight television stations for $500 million.\n\nAbry Broadcast Partners II L.P., a Boston-based buyout firm, is buying the stations, most of which are in the South.\n\nAct III said it would sell the stations and its Act III Broadcasting unit to Abry to focus on other media business. \"There are some other businesses we're looking at,\" said David Goldhill, vice president for strategic planning.\n\nAll eight of the stations are affiliated with the Fox Network, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, though one, WNRW-TV in Greensboro, N.C., is switching its affiliation to ABC in September.\n\nSeven of the eight stations are also affiliates of the fledgling United Paramount Network, which was started in January under the joint ownership of Chris-Craft Industries and Viacom Inc. They are the Greensboro station; WUTV-TV in Buffalo; WRGT-TV in Dayton, Ohio; WRLH-TV in Richmond, WVAH-TV in Charleston and Huntington, W. Va., WUHF-TV in Rochester and WTAT-TV in Charleston, S.C. The eighth station is WZTV-TV in Nashville.\n\nMr. Goldhill said the affiliation agreements had some time to run. Abry officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nMr. Goldhill said Abry would assume a substantial but unspecified amount of debt in the transaction, and that Act III would make money in the sale.\n\nFor the 12-month period ending on March 31, Act III Broadcasting reported operating income of $30.6 million and cash flow of $44.7 million on revenue of $93.8 million.\n\nMr. Lear, who is 72, produced hit television programs like \"All in the Family,\" \"Maude\" and \"The Jeffersons.\" He owns nearly 60 percent of ACT III Broadcasting through Act III Communications, of which he is the sole stockholder."
