        "text": "Another 10 p.m. newscast could soon be coming to Tampa Bay's already-crowded local news scene, developed during an extensive revamping of the market's newest network affiliate, WTTA-Ch. 38.\n\nExecutives at Sinclair Broadcasting Group say they will soon decide whether to add a late night newscast to the station's schedule when it debuts as a WB affiliate Sept. 1.\n\nOn that date, shows such as Dawson's Creek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Felicity will begin airing on WTTA, which takes over WB programing from WWWB-Ch. 32.\n\n\"The first step, obviously is to define the marketplace and see if there's a business for us. . . I think there is,\" said Steve Marks, a regional director for Sinclair responsible for running 11 stations, including WTTA.\n\nAs an outlet in the nation's 14th-largest TV market, WTTA serves the largest viewership of any TV property owned by Sinclair, a Baltimore, Md.-based company which controls about 65 television stations across the country.\n\nA newscast would bring added visibility to WTTA, which has plugged along as a cheaply run, sleepy independent station since 1991.\n\n\"We're exploring a newscast that would fill the void left by (WTOG-Ch. 44),\" Marks said of the UPN affiliate that eliminated its 10 p.m. newscast and 50-person news department last year. \"We believe it would add to the credibility of our station with local viewers.\"\n\nAlready, the company has likely spent millions juicing up WTTA's roster of syndicated shows, including Home Improvement (which moves from WFTS-Ch. 28), Cheers and The People's Court (both moving from WTOG), Caroline in the City, The National Enquirer and Judge Greg Mathis.\n\nIn the fall of 2000, expect to see Spin City, The Jamie Foxx Show and Suddenly Susan, with Seinfeld moving from WTOG in 2001. WTTA's call letters may be the only thing that doesn't change, Marks says, because WWWB retains the rights to its name.\n\nIf Sinclair were to establish a news department for WTTA, the company would have to spend millions more staffing and equipping the St. Petersburg station. Marks would not reveal how much Sinclair has spent revamping WTTA or speculate on how much adding a news department would cost.\n\nAs a cheaper alternative, WTTA might enlist an existing area news department to produce its newscast, using different anchors broadcasting from a different studio but using the same video footage.\n\nFor an established news department _ especially one with an 11 p.m. newscast _ the arrangement would mean additional revenue and a chance to undercut any other 10 p.m. news shows competing for advertising dollars.\n\nMarks is supervising the March 28 start of such an agreement at WVAH-TV in Charleston, W.Va., where Sinclair-owned ABC affiliate WCHS-TV will provide news for the Fox station.\n\nMarks would not say which area TV news departments are talking to WTTA.\n\nBut Dan Bradley, vice president of news at WFLA-Ch. 8, acknowledged advising Sinclair that the NBC affiliate might be interested in such a deal. WFLA last year offered to produce a similar newscast for WTOG.\n\nDave Boylan, general manager at WTVT-Ch. 13, brushed aside the possibility that WTTA could compete with WTVT's highly rated, hourlong 10 p.m. newscast.\n\n\"Their challenge will be _ as others have found _ to make enough money on a single newscast to justify the expense,\" said Boylan. \"A camera costs the same for me as it does for them. But we're offering almost 45 hours of news per week. It's hard to say there's an unserved market here for local news.\"\n\nMarks says financial concerns won't be the primary factor in Sinclair's decision.\n\n\"Obviously, we're already making a huge investment. . . (and) we have the wherewithal to do whatever we want,\" he added, noting that the company is also scouting locations to build expanded studios. \"I think we can serve the community and make a living at it.\"\n\n_ Times researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this story."
