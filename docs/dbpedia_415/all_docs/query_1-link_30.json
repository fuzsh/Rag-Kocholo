        "text": "The Charleston / Huntington WV market its affecting Channel 8 (WCHS) ABC and Channel 11 (WVAH) FOX have an outage. Last time it was Channel 13 (WOWK) CBS (only one Eastern ARC 77 satellite though) and I had to contact the engineer at the station and they didnt know anything about it and Dish Network said they were aware of the problem and it took them three days to fix it. What the heck is going on? Even the digital signal with an over the air antenna is out this time. It is out on 77 and 129 this time. My guess is something is wrong with their antenna receiver the signal because someone told me that they are receiving the channels on cable and they usually pick it up over the air. If it was an issue with their transmission tower then the cable company probably would not be receiving it either unless they are getting it by Fiber or something.\n\nJust as a note, both these stations are owned by the same company, Sinclair."
