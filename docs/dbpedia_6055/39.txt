You can count me, Lorrie! I'm like everyone else--somewhere around my house is a copy of the book (that is, if I haven't given it away). Anyway, I'll be here.

Lorrie and Ann, Our Quorum has been accounted for and is listed, HA Ha I had better put my own name down.

Me, too, I'll be here as I've read the book and thought it just wonderful! Is it going to be in February? I'll get a copy from the Library then. Looking forward to this one.

Ha! What I thought was A Lesson Before Dying on my bookshelf was As I Lay Dying (Faulker)! I must have given it away--I'll check it out of the library since I actually have already read this one.

I've read three chapters, and coming on top of the shuttle I'm getting very depressed. But I'll try to do the rest by tomorrow.

Cane River is another good book about the way black people suffered during and after the Civil War. Cane River tells more about the suffering of black women through generation after generation. Lalita Tademy is writing another book telling about her father's experiences.

I just received a book in the mail that I had ordered. I heard that it is a good one. You can find a synopsis on Amazon. It is called LAY THAT TRUMPET IN OUR HANDS BY SUSAN CAROL MCCARTHY. I have not read it yet. I just read reviews about it.

How about the question in the heading: scriptural connotations of the word "lesson?"

Hi, My name is Jeannette and I'm new. I really like this book...I'm listening to it in audio and though the narrator isn't that good, the message of the book is coming out loud and clear. It is so revealing of the predudice of that time and its so appalling. Legislation is what changed it and forced people to act differently, man's prejudice nature will never change ; thank God my children have been raised in a different age. Though uneducated, Emma was so wise in wanting Jefferson to die feeling a sense of value in himself. Grant is the educated one, the teacher, and somehow he just didn't "get it"...or didn't care...

I think the country has come a long, long way which is wonderful. I love Miss Emma and how she looks at each prisoner as one of her "children" She loves Jefferson and the others too. I think that prison cell is going to become a major classroom. All alone, Jefferson and Grant will learn from each other.

I'm not getting the feeling that Grant is treating the children harshly in order " to prepare them for life". I think he has alot of anger (and probably justifiably so) but instead of being constructive in dealing with it, he is taking it out on the kids. It may be sort-of like the harassment and hazing you received "in the old days(!)" when you pledged a sorority....the mindset that "if I put up with it you have to take your turn" kind of thing. I think he could be incredidibly constructive for those kids. Destroying a child's self esteem and being abusive is never beneficial, and that's what I see him doing. Also there is the element that he probably learned that kind of treatment when he was a kid. His formal education seems to have not taught him some of the more important things in life. I guess we have to remember though that back in the forties, people weren't taught about expressing anger ...that was a 70's thing, wasn't it? I also found it ironic when he said to Jefferson "remember what all Aunt Emma has done for you" when he had to be railroaded and coerced into visiting Jefferson in the first place! I'm anxious to see if his attitude changes as the book progresses. Jeannette from No. Va.

You know, reading the preceding post about Grant Wiggins I feel that it misses the point. True, on the surface it appears that he is arrogant, selfish, and boorish. But I look beneath the surface and I believe that the things he does that appear boorish and arrogant are things he does to keep from hurting. I've marked some passages, and when I get back to this I'll do them one by one. Of course, I may be superimposing my own tendencies on him. I know that during my first marriage I ranted and raved because I was very insecure and my first reaction was always to start yelling. With Bob, however, I felt very secure in his affection and knew I could rely on him to understand and I didn't need to panic as I had done before. I think that if Grant relaxes his attitude he's afraid he'll get plowed under and never get away. He feels for the children, and for his aunt but can't bring himself to appear 'weak'.

Oh, I agree with Opal Harriet. I love Ernest Gaines. I especially enjoyed reading 'A Gathering of Old Men.' I like his short stories too. I think Louisiana must be an interesting place to visit. I would like to learn more about the foods, music, etc.

Did any one name Maya Angelou? I will never forget her reading at the inauguration. Was it Clinton's inauguration? I am not sure. She has made many trips to Africa. She writes great poetry too. Her coming of age story I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is interesting. I loved her grandmother and brother. Of course, she went through some very painful times as a little girl.

I think Grant was not "living" because he could not be himself. In Bayonne, he had to be a totally different person from the one who lived on the university campus. I think this hits on question #3 that is asked above in the header. On the university campus, he could be an intellectual, asking and answering important questions. While in Bayonne, he had to slide back into a subservient role. So, he is "dying" in a symbolic way.

One of the chilling remarks that Grant made to his old teacher left me flabbergasted. "They teach us how to live as a colored man." As if getting an education didn't expand his options at all!

One of the things that comes to mind is the obligations and commitments as Ms Emma reminds the Pichots and Guidrys(sheriff's wife is a Pichot?) of her dedication to the family over the years. She also lets them know that they owe her this favor that she asks of them. How is this different from the way that we might ask a favor of an old friend today? Is it different?

Lorrie, I am writing down the quote from The Autobiography of Jane Pittman. One more thing, Lorrie. I kept looking and looking for the Christmas program. I didn't remember reading it. Guess what! I haven't gotten to it yet. It's in my next chapter. I have a hardback book. I will have a comment soon, I hope.

I am reading the book and lurking here, but I have to thank Carolyn and Bobbiecee for providing such a wonderful education on how things are in New Zealand and Australia. Our shared history of man's inhumanity makes me wonder - are human beings innately racist?

I can't remember the words but there is a song from South Pacific called You Have To Be Taught and the theme is just what we're talking about - you have to be taught to hate. I'll see if I can find the words but the song fits right in here.

I think Jefferson's journal is very interesting. I am glad Grant gave him a notebook and pencil. His writing is leading him to realize what he has missed in life, and he is also learning answers to hard questions about life and death. Jefferson is not the man who went into the whiskey store and witnessed those killings. Neither is Grant the same man. Really, I think the whole town has changed in some way.

We just finished watching the American Experience episode about the two men who first tried heart surgery. One was Dr. Blalock, a white surgeon and the chief of surgery at JohnsHopkins and his cohort, Vivan Thomas, was listed as a janitor. He was an Afro/American whose 7 yrs of savings for medical school had been wiped away in the bank failure of '29. When the first surgery, which was suggested by a woman pediactric surgeon, was performed by these two men, Thomas stood on a stool telling Blalock how to do the surgery. Blalock insisted on this. Thomas had not only designed the surgical tools for the operation but had performed it 100's of times on lab animals. I was in tear by the end of this compelling story. Yes, he was finally recognized by JohnsHopkins Institute after he turned 60 or more. Wonderful story but just so sad.

Hi Ann, I am sorry to have missed this American Experience episode. I hope it will be repeated. Thank you for sharing the lives of these two men.

Rev. Ambrose seems to feel uncomfortable with himself. It's as if he needs to prove that he is of more value than Grant. I like Grant for sticking to his guns and remaining honest. If he doesn't believe in a certain idea, he is not going to pretend to believe in it just to make the minister happy or content.

Ann, I connected with your question, "Wasn't murder, murder then? We needed a separate law?" It's unbelieveable to me that in recent times it was apparently NOT against the law to lynch people! To me, recent times are those that I can remember. But yes, why do we always need additional laws that are already covered by existing laws? I am thinking of the recent flurry about crimes considered as "hate" crimes. Isn't a crime by its very nature an act of hate? Is there such a thing as a friendly murder? I also object to the thought that it's a "worse" crime to kill an officer of the law than an ordinary citizen.

Lorrie, I found Harry Williams and his place in this novel on Page 238 of the PPB. He was a volunteer from the quarter as a witness to Jefferson's execution. Asked to do this by Rev Ambrose through a request from Sheriff Guidry.

This sounds too much like Viet Nam and Korea! 50 years have passed and mankind still can't find a different approach to getting along with our neighbors. Seems we are always in turmoil. Where did I read that? Some old philosopher said that.
