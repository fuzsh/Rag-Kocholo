        "text": "Background notes for teachers\n\nThe Mitchell Wing of the State Library of New South Wales is home to the Shakespeare Room. It is a beautifully decorated room built to commemorate the three hundredth anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare in 1616. The Shakespeare Room is filled with objects and books connected to the life and works of William Shakespeare.\n\nOne of the most beautiful art works in the room is a series of stained glass windows depicting images from a speech from Shakespeare's play As You Like It. The windows were created by Sydney stained glass artist Arthur G. Benfield. They were installed in 1942 during the construction of the building.\n\nThe windows depict the Seven Ages of Man, as described in the character Jaques’ soliloquy in As You Like It. In this comedy, Jaques is a melancholy lord who is living in the Forest of Arden after having been banished. He rarely takes part in the action around him, preferring to observe rather than to join in. In this speech Jaques first compares lives of men and women in the world to actors playing roles on a stage in the theatre. The speech then examines the changes that take place over the course of a man’s life.\n\nJaques divides the life of a man into seven stages:\n\nBaby or infant\n\nSchool boy or child\n\nLover\n\nSoldier\n\nJustice or judge\n\nOld man\n\nExtreme old age, again like a child\n\nEach of these stages is represented in a panel of the stained glass windows.\n\nThe idea of the Seven Ages of Man is very old and dates to the twelfth century (1100s). Shakespeare would have learnt about this idea as a young boy at school. Henry VIII owned a tapestry that featured the Seven Ages of Man.\n\nThe Seven Ages of Man\n\nSpeech from William Shakespeare’s As You Like It, Act II scene vii\n\nJaques: All the world's a stage,\n\nAnd all the men and women merely players:\n\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\n\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,\n\nHis acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\n\nMewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\n\nAnd then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\n\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail\n\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,\n\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\n\nMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\n\nFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\n\nJealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\n\nSeeking the bubble reputation\n\nEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\n\nIn fair round belly with good capon lined,\n\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\n\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\n\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\n\nInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\n\nWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\n\nHis youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\n\nFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\n\nTurning again toward childish treble, pipes\n\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\n\nThat ends this strange eventful history,\n\nIs second childishness and mere oblivion,\n\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\n\nGlossary\n\nballad: a story told through a song\n\ncapon: a castrated rooster, a luxury food\n\nhose: stockings\n\nlean: thin\n\nmewling: crying or whining\n\nmodern instances: new judgements or decisions\n\noblivion: nothingness\n\npantaloon: refers to the sixth stage of life, the character of Pantalone is a weak old man from Italian comedy. Pantaloon was sixteenth century slang for an old man and is similar to “geezer”.\n\npard: a big cat such as a leopard or panther\n\npipe: a musical instrument like a recorder with a high pitched tone\n\npuking: vomiting\n\nsans: the French word for “without\"\n\nsatchel: a school bag\n\nsevere: harsh or stern\n\ntreble: the high voice of a small boy\n\nwise saws: wise sayings or proverbs\n\nwoeful: sad\n\nSummary of the Seven Ages of Man speech\n\nThis monologue compares the world with a stage in a theatre. Men and women are the actors or players on this stage.\n\nActors playing roles have entrances and exits during a performance. Life also has its entrances and exits- people are born and die and pass in and out of our lives. Just as an actor plays a variety of roles in life, so too do men and women play different roles or pass through different stages or seven ages of their lives.\n\nThe speech then focuses on the experience of men. However it is also possible to consider how the lives of women might be divided into seven ages or stages.\n\nThe first role or stage is that of an infant or baby. The baby cries and whines before vomiting in the arms of his nurse.\n\nIn the second stage of life man plays the role of a small boy or child. He holds a school bag, has a shiny face and walks as slowly as he can because he does not like school and is reluctant to leave home.\n\nThe role of the lover is the third stage of life. He is young and foolish and falls passionately in love, singing a sad song about love in which he describes the beauty of a girl’s eyebrows.\n\nIn the fourth stage of life the man plays the role of the soldier. He has a beard, swears oaths and is ambitious to seek out honour. He is so keen to improve his reputation he is willing to risk dangers such as cannons in war.\n\nIn the fifth stage of life man plays the role of a justice or judge. He has grown fat from eating expensive meats. He uses his experience of life and the knowledge he has gained to offer what he thinks are wise sayings and advice and good decisions.\n\nIn the sixth stage of life the man becomes a pantaloon or weak old man. He is so thin his stockings become loose. The speech compares this stage of life to a return to being like a baby or child. Old men and small children both have high voices and are dependent on adults."
