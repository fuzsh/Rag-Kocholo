        "text": "When I were mere slip of a lad (stop laughing in the back), I had the wonderful fortune to work for one of the cinema industry greats. Steve Weiner was a pioneer in the world of exhibition, and he taught me some lessons I still do my best to live by. Steve had incredible vision and was a charismatic leader. I used to joke that if you cut me open, I would bleed black, white, and red – the Cineworld brand colours. And more amazing than that, I wasn’t unique. We all believed in him, in his company, in our company. Because that’s how he made us feel.\n\nToday our industry is at a crossroads. I’m not going to go into the whys and wherefores about how we got to where we are, or even my opinion on whether these changes are positive or negative. Frankly speaking it’s not my place, and there are people far more informed and intelligent than I, making decisions they feel are best for their business. Who am I to argue? Instead, I’ll talk about some facts, and they are relatively simple: The relationship between distribution and exhibition is changing. Films are going to be made available earlier in other formats after the theatrical release than they were before the pandemic. In some instances, and in some countries, those releases will be simultaneous.\n\nAs a former disciple of one of the great exhibitors this means one piece of Steve’s wisdom needs to change. One morning, after I had proposed some elaborate scheme about putting fashion shows in our foyers, Steve pulled me aside and told me to keep things simple. He enlightened me that as a cinema we are a big black box that sells popcorn. The people come for the films, but we make money on the popcorn they eat as they watch them.\n\nI’ve heard for a long time about the death of cinema – first it was TV, then VHS, DVD, streaming and so on. But there is a difference this time around. In all of those circumstances the content was only available in cinema. That was one of the main differentiators. As a child our local movie house was dirty, it was small, it was in a dodgy part of town. But it didn’t matter. If I wanted to watch Back to the Future Part 2, and I definitely did, then my Dad took me to the only real choice for doing that. Would he have done the same had that the movie been available at home at the same time, or in a few weeks? For ‘free’? I’d like to think he would – he is a great Dad and some of my fondest memories are going to the movies with him – but I’ll tell you something for nothing, he wasn’t taking me to a tiny, filthy cinema because of the experience, it was for the film. In the US at the moment, customers of HBO Max already have that choice – stay at home and watch it on the small screen for no incremental cost (on top of what they are already paying for their premium cable package) or buy a ticket and go to the cinema.\n\nAnd that’s where Steve’s lesson needs to change. Let’s think about going to the movies in a mathematical sense (stick with me people). People do a series of cost benefit analyses in their minds all the time, without knowing it. Should we have a takeaway or cook? Should we drive or take the train? Should we go to the cinema or watch it on HBO Max? We weigh up the cost of an activity or product, against the benefits it provides, and we do this for all options within something called the Choice Set. The criteria and the weighting applied to each will differ by person, so there is no definitive right answer, but let’s consider what it might look like for someone deciding between the cinema and streaming:\n\nGoing to the Cinema = Film + Quality of Presentation + Cost + Experience\n\nStreaming = Film + Quality of Presentation + Cost + Convenience\n\nCost is obviously a factor, and streaming will probably win in most circumstances. It will also be more convenient, but then it does lack the social connection. Quality will be defined by your home set up, but I would argue that unless your local is awful (I still love you Cineworld Hammersmith, despite the sticky floors and out of focus projection), the cinema will win this little battle 99% of the time – nevertheless it’s a lot closer than it used to be. And so, we get to Film. Depending on how you value everything else I’ve just discussed, it could be that Film is the deciding factor, and as the difference between what’s available at home and at the cinema is eroded, more and more people may opt for the latter.\n\nThis all sounds awfully gloomy. Yet it isn’t the end of our story, not by a long shot. We as an industry need to rethink how we market exhibition. No longer is it sufficient to be just shouting loudly that you’re showing the latest big blockbuster, \"only available in cinemas\". Because that last bit may not be true – at least not for a very long period. We need to make customers recalculate their own assessment of value. We need them to remember just how special the experience of sitting in front of a screen bigger than a house, in pitch black, with booming sound and stunning projection, can really be. We need announce it in our marketing campaigns and invest in the technology which makes this a reality. No longer is it sufficient to let the distributors do the hard yards of creating the demand for cinema, exhibitors need to take some of that responsibility back.\n\nAnd when those customers turn up at the box office, we need to deliver on the promises we have made. Premium cinema has been around for a long time. The last decade has seen a huge increase in giant screens, luxury seating, 3D, moving seats – the list goes on and will continue to grow. Never have these ‘premiums’ been more important in our industry. They give a rationale for consumers to increase the value they apportion to experience and presentation, in their own cost benefit analysis. They provide a crucial reason why cinema is better than streaming on the sofa. If you’ve ever seen a child laugh as they catch the bubbles or scream as they duck out of the way of something flying off the screen in a 3D film, you will know what I mean. These are experiences you cannot get in the home. They are emotions you cannot replicate with a big screen TV, no matter how many Ks it’s got.\n\nCinema is amazing. Cinema is wonderful. It is not just a big black box where they sell you popcorn. Not anymore."
