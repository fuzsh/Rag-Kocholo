        "text": "In the film, Night of the Living Dead, the movie starts with two siblings, John and Barbara, driving to their father's grave to drop off flowers. John is reluctant to be there and is eager to leave while Barbara is trying to pray. John teases her like when they were children saying “They’re coming to get you, Barbara!” when they both see an unknown man. Barbara goes to apologize to the unknown man but it seems he is dazed and kills John. Barbara escapes and finds herself at an empty house. In the house, she meets Ben, who borders up to the windows after taking down 3 undead. After a bit of listening to a radio for the current status of the state of emergency, Harry and Tom come upstairs. We learn that two men, two women, and a child had been in the basement of the house during Barbara’s and Ben’s struggle with the undead. After much argumentation on if the basement or upstairs was safer between Harry and Ben, Harry went back downstairs to his wife and child. Tom and his wife, Judy, stayed upstairs with Ben believing they could properly border up the windows together. After much convincing from Helen, Harry’s wife, Harry and she join the others upstairs. While listening on the radio, they are given more updates of the state of emergency. The radio announcer suggests instead of staying in place, to now go to one of the designated “safe areas”. When places are announced, Tom says that one of the\n\nHe took what was said in court, “Why, I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this,” to heart and now he feels as if he is just an animal (Gaines 8). Miss Emma was unable to come with Grant to visit Jefferson, however, she did send Grant with a plate of food. To which Jefferson responded by saying “You brought me corn...That’s what hogs eat” (Gaines 82). What was said about Jefferson was really digging into his conscience. He did not want to listen to anything that Grant said to him in his efforts to help him because he felt it was worthless since he was going to die anyway. He even went as far to eat without hands on the floor and sticking his head in the bag and ate, along with making sounds like a hog (Gaines 83). Jefferson is much like the father in The Road by Cormac McCarthy in that at times they both just felt that they should give up. Even though their situations may have been seen as completely different, they both felt as if there was no purpose in trying anymore. Not only did this cause suffering for Jefferson, but so did the fact that he was being put to death. As Ernest Gaines said “What did a person go through that week before, the day before, the night before he was to die? What was in his mind?” (\"NEA Big Read: Meet Ernest Gaines\"). Jefferson must have had numerous thoughts that had been running through his mind awaiting his execution and being called a hog added to these\n\nDying slowly as a worthless person or even a “hog” for something that never happened, can cause others to make more of this death. The poem, “If We Must Die” and the movie A Lesson Before Dying are very similar and point out how unfair it is to die in such a horrid way. In the movie, a man was wrongfully accused of murder and he was sentenced to death, however citizens work together to make him a “man” before death. The poem simply shows that some people really want to die with meaning. The main similarities in both these stories deal with how death should be done or even how a person should be considered before death.\n\nIt will honor people not only that are living but have also passed away. If we must die is a repetition which creates a more emphases that transcends into the readers thoughts. Zora Neale Hurston‘s put more emphasis on racial pride. She writes at the end of her writing about a bag-- a special bag that resembles something more meaningful \" In your hand is the brown bag. On the ground before you is the jumble it held--so much like the jumble in the bags, could they be emptied, that all might be dumped in a single heap and the bags refilled without altering the content of any greatly. A bit of colored glass more or less would not matter. Perhaps that is how the Great Stuffer of Bags filled them in the first place--who knows?\"(Hurston 17). She describes how there are different types of brown, white, red and yellow. There is a jumble of different objects and she furthermore explains some of those worthless and priceless objects. She describes how she dumps the bag and if she were to mix it up the items were still there. This symbolism states if you were to mix up everything in people and then put them into the bags, everyone is made up of the same thing. She uses this symbolism to demonstrate that blacks are equal to any other race. Both authors want to demonstrate to their society that racism should not get in the way of their\n\nIn “On Natural Death,” Thomas appeals to the readers by contemplating the subject of death with an academic approach that includes facts, data, and information. Thomas successfully transforms death from an awkward, emotional subject to a more comfortable intellectual one. This engages the readers by placing contemplation of death and dying within the confines of a more manageable and rational context. His gradual exhumation of death eases the audience into pondering the subject in the absence of emotional stress. The essay transitions from the death of an elm tree to that of a mouse. This is followed by Thomas giving a significant amount of attention to a scientific explanation of death, and then finally the description of the near death experience of a human. This use of an academic appeal moves the audience to a comfort zone with the subject of death and circumvents the common response of avoidance. The reader is simultaneously desensitized to the gravity of subject matter and given permission to consider death and dying without the normal societal negative stigma associated with the subject.\n\nTwo literary pieces, “Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night” by, Dylan Thomas and “Because I Could Not Stop for Death” by, Emily Dickinson are both poems that discuss the topic of death. While there are some similarities and comparisons between the two poems, when it comes to the themes, both poets writing styles are quite different from one another which makes each poem unique. Thomas and Dickinson both use identical figurative language devices and other literature symbolisms as they explain their main themes which contrasts the differences to the concept of death. These distinct variations between poems are apparent in both the form, and how the choice of words is used in the poems. Both of the authors have presented two very different ideas on death. The poems are well distinguished literature devices, they share minor similarities and differences between each other and how they present the meaning of death to a toll.\n\nI remember watching this film for the first time back in 2001 when it was released and having not watched it in over a decade, I feel I can say that this film is still solid. The Others holds up so well due to the film relying on storytelling, atmosphere and sense of impending doom to create its tension. The Others is one of the rare big budget, well cast horror films that seem to pop up every couple of years and I love it when they do. I feel horror often gets the short end of the stick when it comes to Hollywood.\n\nPart 1 - In American author's 2009 book, The Help, the primary thesis is the relationship between Black maids and white households in Jackson, Mississippi during the early 1960s. The story is really told from three perspectives, Aibileen and Minny are Black women, both maids, and Skeeter is the nickname of Eugenia Phelan, daughter of a prominent White family. Skeeter has just finished school and hopes to become a writer. In general, the relationship between the Black maids and the White employers is six sided: On one side we have the White employers who have three views: 1) Their personal and private beliefs that can range from extreme scorn and bias to kindness regarding race; 2) Their public persona that must have the \"proper\" attitude about Blacks and \"the help,\" and 3) Their employer attitude, which is condescending and parental. The Black view also has three segments: 1) Their personal and private beliefs that usually range from understanding not all Whites are the same and an extreme love and empathy for the White children for whom they care; 2) The public persona that is deferential, polite, and stoic to their White bosses; and 3) Their attitude and view among the Black community, which usually separates the \"poor and ignorant but rich\" White souls from the Black view of family and common sense. All in all, the relationship is contentious, phony, and based on economic advantage.\n\nIn the bucket list they accept the fact that they are dying and they decide to do a bucket list. In my life the guy made videos for his son to remember him cause he knew he was dying. Carter and Edward took the stages of dying and a chance to do the things they wanted to do before they died. Bob Jones took the stages of dying as a chance to let his son know who he was and make amends with his family. In both the movies each of the people dying handle it differently weather they were with someone in the same situation or\n\nThe movie A Time to Kill is engrossed in the emotions that revolves around hatred, this hatred originates from racism in the south. It begins with the brutal rape of a young black girl, Tanya Hailey. The rape was committed by two rednecks in a pickup truck. Tonya’s father Carl Lee Hailey takes the law into his hands and lashes out by killing the rapist. Charged with two counts of murder, he is assigned the young and brilliant lawyer Jake Brigance, who still believes he is able to receive a fair trial. With the trial beginning, viewers get to see this hatred somehow rise to become more significant. Focusing on the relationship between Carl Lee and Jake Brigance, and its impact on the southern town. The producers of this movie tried to make the audience or the viewers understand how these people in the south struggle with this hatred of racism, facing segregation head on and its judicial system. A Time to Kill is based on the first novel by John Grisham. Directed by Joel Schumacher, with the strong performances from Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey, the avenging father, and Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance, the lawyer. This paper will be analyzing some clips and scenes from the movie, and discussing how every visual aspect of a film's language especially cinematography. For example, shots, sounds, settings, and movements can give the audience a clear sign of emotions, motive, and clues as to what the filmmaker feels and\n\nFacing Death is a compelling documentary on, oftentimes, the final journey patients and their families will venture through together in life. The documentary seeks to capture how the patients and their families respond to the inevitability of death. The film includes families who respond to the issue by allowing their family member, the patient, to pass through the door of death without aggressive care, while there are yet other families who insist on everything being done to delay the moment of death. This topic of fighting death is attributed with producing much debate. On one hand are those who do not see the point of fighting death, however, on the other hand, there are those who believe that delaying death and staying alive is what ought to be done. Personally, from what I understand of either party, I think that I am a part of the later party. In addition, this issue naturally delves into what one believes occurs after death, as it is an issue dealing directly with death. This also compels me to view this topic from the viewpoint of the later party.\n\nPoetry is an art form that has often been highly regarded. It brings together some of the most complex forms of writing in the English language. Two poems that focus on the same topic may sometimes, have completely different views and provide perspectives that may not have been considered by the other. Two of these Poems are Let Me Die A Youngman’s Death by Roger McGough and On Death by Anne Killigrew. The former poem by Roger McGough talks of how the speaker does not wish to die the peaceful death of an elderly person but rather the chaotic death of a young man. In death is nothing at all the speaker proposes that all should be as happy as before his death, and not view it in such a negative and secretive light."
