He co-founded the business everyone used in the 1990s: Moviefone. His list of accomplishments also include co-writing the theme song for the hit TV show, <em>Felicity</em>, directing the Ryan Gosling film, <em>All Good Things</em>, and directing and producing the documentary, <em>Capturing the Friedmans,</em> which won 18 international prizes and earned an Academy Award nomination. He’s probably best known for directing the Emmy-winning HBO series <em>The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, </em>which will be back with Part Two this year. Andrew sat down with Bob to recount how he got Moviefone off the ground and changed the industry forever; the major pivots and innovations behind the production of his films; and share how his parents influenced his career. You’ll get a sense of the unique skills that have enabled him to turn curiosities into successes, and have fun along the way. </p><p>See <a href='https://omnystudio.com/listener'>omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
