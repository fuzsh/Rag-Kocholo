        "meta_description": "Glassfrogs (family: Centrolenidae) represent a fantastic radiation (~150 described species) of Neotropical anurans that originated in South America and dispersed into Central America. In this study, we review the systematics of Ecuadorian glassfrogs, providing species accounts of all 60 species, including three new species described herein. For all Ecuadorian species, we provide new information on the evolution, morphology, biology, conservation, and distribution.

Lastly, we identify priority areas for glassfrog conservation in Ecuador.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Neotropical family Centrolenidae Taylor 1951 is a monophyletic taxon that contains about 150 species classified into 12 genera [1] (Figure 1). Historical biogeographic evidence in a phylogenetic context suggests that the group originated in South America and subsequently dispersed to Central America [2,3]. Centrolenids share a unique morphology and behavior that makes them readily identifiable; some of the most evident traits include a green dorsum in most species (Figure 2), completely or partially translucent venter (Figure 3), out-of-water deposition of eggs along streams (Figure 4), and forward-directed eyes (Figure 2A). Other interesting features that have evolved within Centrolenidae include parental care [4] (Figure 5), fighting behavior [5] (Figure 6), and humeral spines in males of some species [6] (Figure 7).\n\nThe monophyly of Centrolenidae is well supported by morphological [7,8,9] and molecular [2,8,10,11,12,13,14] studies. Osteological characters shared by all glassfrogs (Figure 8) include a dilated medial process on Metacarpal III [7], T-shaped terminal phalanges [15], intercalary element between distal and penultimate phalanges [15], and complete or partial fusion of tibiale and fibulare [15,16]. The diversity of glassfrogs is growing and in constant revision (e.g., [1,6,17,18,19,20,21]). Centrolenid species richness is concentrated in mountain chains, where humidity is high, and streams provide suitable reproductive habitats. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Andes, by far, is the center of diversity and endemism for the group and that Colombia and Ecuador maintain the highest species richness.\n\nIn 1973, John D. Lynch and William E. Duellman [22] provided the first review of the glassfrogs of Ecuador, and they reported the presence of 20 species and suggested the occurrence of an additional one. Only 47 years later, the species richness of this family has tripled, reaching the incredible number of 60 species in Ecuador. Since Lynch and Duellman’s pioneering work, our understanding of centrolenid biology [23,24,25], morphology [6,9,17], systematics [1,6,17,26,27], biogeography [3,28], and evolution [2,19,25] has improved substantially. Still, there are novel challenges and conspicuous gaps that need to be filled.\n\nHerein, we provide a new review of Ecuadorian glassfrogs, bringing an update of what is known about the group, highlighting issues pending resolution, and providing a framework that we hope will facilitate further research, particularly with species identification, discovery, and conservation. We employ a candidate species system (e.g., [29]) to identify putative undescribed species to be investigated and to streamline the species discovery process. These tasks are particularly urgent in the current global amphibian extinction phenomenon [30,31,32,33].\n\nFigure 3. Ventral transparency in glassfrogs.

Methods\n\n2.1. Taxonomy and Species Concept\n\nThroughout this work, we use the name Centrolenidae as originally intended by Taylor [15]. The taxonomic arrangement below the family level (i.e., subfamily and genus) follows the proposal by Guayasamin et al. [1]. We use quotations to denote species with uncertain phylogenetic position to differentiate them from monophyletic clades (e.g., “Centrolene”, “Cochranella”), as proposed by Guayasamin et al. [1]. An updated taxonomy for all the species in Centrolenidae is provided in Table S1.\n\nFor recognizing species, we adhered to the evolutionary species concept first proposed by Simpson [34,35], modified by Wiley [36] and de Queiroz [37,38]. This concept incorporates important theoretical factors such as lineage independence, identity, and evolutionary tendencies, and provides a flexible framework when reproductive isolation is difficult to test (e.g., allopatric populations). Evidence supporting the validity of a species can come from different sources (e.g., morphology, DNA, behavior, ecology), and no trait alone can be considered a biological property that a species must have in order to be recognized [37]. In other words, under the evolutionary species concept, the only necessary property for an entity to be a recognized as a species is that it corresponds to a temporal segment of a metapopulation lineage evolving separately from other lineages [37,38]. Evidence for independent evolution is gathered from different data sources, where integrative taxonomy plays a fundamental role when assessing what represents (or not) a distinctive species (e.g., [39,40]).\n\n2.2. Characters and Terminology\n\nFor general terminology and descriptions of morphological characters we follow the proposals by Lynch and Duellman [22] and Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid [17]. We illustrate some of the most relevant traits for glassfrog identification, including dorsal color pattern (Figure 2), skin texture (Figure 9), and snout shape (Figure 10). To facilitate comparison with previous literature dealing with anurans, fingers are numbered preaxially to postaxially from I–IV. However, we stress that from an evolutionary perspective, anuran fingers should be numbered from II–V, to reflect the loss of Digit I in anurans [41,42,43]. Webbing formulae follow the method of Savage and Heyer [44], as modified by Guayasamin et al. [20] (Figure 11). Larval characters follow the terminology recommended by McDiarmid and Altig [45]. The morphology of nuptial excrescences and prepollical spines (Figure 12) follows the types proposed by Flores [46], with the additions and modifications detailed in Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid [17] and Guayasamin et al. [1]. Other key traits in centrolenid taxonomy are humeral spines (Figure 7, Figure 13, and Figure 14), ventral transparency (Figure 8), peritoneum and pericardium (with or without iridophores; Figure 13), enlarged subcloacal warts on thighs below vent (Figure 15), and tubercles on the external edge of arm, hand, and foot (Figure 16).\n\nWhen discussing parental care, we adopt the terminology by Delia et al. [25]. Egg brooding refers to a specific form of ventral contact where the parent positions its body over the egg clutch; this behavior reduces embryonic mortality by protecting embryos from dehydration and, possibly, by preventing fungal development and predation [25]. Parental care is divided into the following behaviors [25]: (i) Short-term maternal care, where brooding is provided for a few hours just after oviposition; (ii) prolonged male care, where parental care is provided for several weeks; and (iii) prolonged female care, where parental care is provided for several weeks (only observed in Ikakogi tayrona [47]).\n\nFigure 10.

Guayasamin.\n\nMorphometrics—morphological variables were measured with digital callipers to the nearest 0.1 mm, as follows: (1) Snout–vent length (SVL) = distance from tip of snout to posterior margin of vent; (2) tibia length (TL) = length of flexed leg from knee to heel; (3) foot length (FL) = distance from proximal margin of outer metatarsal tubercle to tip of Toe IV; (4) head length (HL) = distance from tip of snout to posterior angle of jaw articulation; (5) head width (HW) = width of head measured at level of jaw articulations; (6) interorbital distance (IOD) = distance between upper eyelids, representing the width of the underlying frontoparietals; (7) upper eyelid width (UE) = greatest transverse width of upper eyelid; (8) internarial distance (IN) = distance between nostrils; (9) eye–nostril distance (EN) = distance from posterior margin of nostril to anterior margin of eye; (10) snout–eye distance (SE) = distance from tip of snout to anterior margin of eye; (11) horizontal eye diameter (ED) = distance between anterior and posterior borders of eye; (12) tympanum diameter (TD) = distance between anterior and posterior margins of tympanic annulus; (13) eye–tympanum distance (ET) = distance from posterior border of eye to anterior margin of tympanic annulus; (14) radio–ulna length (RUL) = length of flexed forearm from elbow to proximal border of palmar tubercle; (15) hand length (HDL) = distance from the proximal margin of palmar tubercle to tip of Finger III; (16) Finger-I length (F1L) = distance from outer margin of palmar tubercle to tip of Finger I; (17) Finger-II length (F2L) = distance from outer margin of palmar tubercle to tip of Finger II; (18) disc of Finger III (3DW) = greatest width of disc of Finger III; and (19) Finger-III width (F3W) = width of Finger III measured at the level of distal subarticular tubercle, including lateral fringes and excluding webbing. For comparing different body sizes (SVL) among glassfrogs, we considered the average size of males and categorized them according to the following criteria: Minute (SVL < 22 mm), small (SVL 22–25 mm), medium (SVL 25–30 mm), large (SVL 30–50 mm), and giant (SVL > 50). Eye diameter was divided into small (eye diameter < 10% SVL), moderate size (eye diameter 10%–15% SVL), and large (eye diameter > 15% SVL). Tympanum was considered to be very small (tympanum < 20% of eye diameter), small (tympanum 20%–30% of eye diameter), moderate (tympanum 31%–40% of eye diameter), large (tympanum diameter 41%–50% of eye diameter), and very large (tympanum diameter > 50% of eye diameter.\n\nFigure 11. Webbing in glassfrogs. (A) Terminology used for webbing formula in hands and feet (see Guayasamin et al. [20]; modified from Savage and Heyer [44]). Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V) represent fingers or toes. Arabic numerals represent the number of phalanges completely or partially free of webbing. We use 0− to indicate that webbing reaches the distal margin of the disc; 0 indicates that webbing reaches the middle of the disc; 0+ indicates that webbing reaches the proximal margin of the disc; 1− indicates that webbing reaches the distal margin of the intercalary cartilage; 1 indicates that the webbing the middle of the intercalary cartilage; 1+ indicates that the webbing the proximal margin of the intercalary cartilage; 2− indicates that webbing reaches the distal margin of the distal subarticular tubercle; 2 indicates that webbing reaches the middle of the distal subarticular tubercle; 2− indicates that webbing reaches the proximal margin of the distal subarticular tubercle. For example, webbing formula in the illustrated foot is absent between Toes I and II (lateral fringes are not considered as webbing); II 12/3—3+ III 12/3—3− IV 3−—2 V.

Photos by Martín Bustamante.\n\nVocalizations—Calls were recorded in the field by different researchers (see Acknowledgments) using an Olympus Linear PCM Recorder LS-10 tape recorder and a Sennheiser K6-ME67 directional microphone. Recordings obtained by us are stored at the Laboratorio de Biología Evolutiva of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (LBE). Sounds were recorded in PCM format at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz. Audiospectograms and oscillograms were generated in the R package SeeWave [48]. Frequency information was obtained through fast Fourier transformation, with a 50% window overlap (Hanning window size of 1024 and a frequency window of 43.1 Hz). The following call variables were measured: Call duration, duration between calls, number of notes per call, note duration, duration between notes, dominant frequency, first harmonic, second harmonic [49,50,51] (Table 1). A call is defined as the sound produced in a single exhalation of air. Calls and notes were divided into two categories, tonal and pulsed, based on distinct morphology. Tonal calls/notes have non-peaked amplitude sustained throughout the duration of the note. Pulsed calls/notes are characterized by having at least one clear amplitude peak. Pulses were defined as a visible increase and decrease of amplitude peaks on the oscillogram within a single note, and notes were defined by a single and complete amplitude rise from and return to the base frequency of the background noise. For a review on the use of bioacoustics in taxonomy and specific variable definitions, see Köhler et al. [52].\n\nSpecimens examined—We examined ethanol-preserved specimens from the following herpetological collections: Centro de Biodiversidad y Genética, Cochabamba, Bolivia (CBG); Círculo Herpetológico de Panamá (CHP); Centro Jambatu de Investigación y Conservación de Anfibios, San Rafael, Ecuador (CJ); División de Herpetología, Museo Ecuatoriano de Ciencias Naturales, Quito, Ecuador (DHMECN); Field Museum, Division of Amphibians and Reptiles, Chicago, USA (FMNH); Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia (ICN); University of Kansas, Museum of Natural History, Division of Herpetology, Lawrence, Kansas, USA (KU); Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Section of Herpetology, Los Angeles, California, USA (LACM); Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA (MCZ); Museo de Historia Natural La Salle, Caracas, Venezuela (MHNLS); Museo de Zoología, Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, Quito, Ecuador (MZUTI); Museo de Zoología, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador (QCAZ); Colección de Herpetología, Escuela de Biología, Universidad de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica (UCR); Museo de Vertebrados, Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia (UVC); and Museo de Zoología, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador (ZSFQ). When specimens were not available for direct comparison, we relied on descriptions in the literature. Sexual maturity of specimens was determined by the presence of vocal slits and nuptial pads in males and by the presence of eggs or convoluted oviducts in females.\n\n2.3. Evolutionary Relationships\n\nTaxon and gene sampling—we combined genetic sequences available from previous work (mostly [2,3,19]) and new sequences generated during this study (Table S2). Genomic extraction, amplification, and sequencing are as described in Guayasamin et al. [2] and Castroviejo-Fisher et al. [3]. The final dataset contains complete or partial sequences of 10 genes representing 6513 bp of data (mitochondrial: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ND1; nuclear: BDNF, C-MYC exon 2, CXCR4, NCX1, POMC, RAG1, SLC8A3). We sampled 49 outgroup taxa from a large range of families within Hyloidea (Table S2), and include all three species from Allophrynidae, the sister group to Centrolenidae [2,12]. Finally, ingroup taxon sampling includes 251 terminals, representing 113 named species, and 24 putative new species. The percentage of named species sampled (i.e., matrix completeness) for each marker is as follows: 12S = 90%; 16S = 94%; BDNF = 55%; C-MYC exon 2 61%; CXCR4 = 61%; NCX1 = 59%; ND1 = 81%; POMC = 61%; RAG1 = 62%; and SLC8A3 = 60% (complete marker statistics can be found in Table S3). For most species of Ecuadorian glassfrogs, we obtained a total of ~2733 bp from the following mitochondrial markers: 12S rRNA (~907 bp), 16S rRNA (~864 bp), and ND1 (~960 bp). See Table S2 for genes sequenced for each species and GenBank Accession Numbers.\n\nCandidate species—to assist in identifying putative new species for future study, we employed the candidate species designation system of Vieites et al. [29]. Prior to this study, divergent centrolenid lineages have been designated in inconsistent ways (using sp. or aff. or museum numbers), which can result in confusion in identifying and studying tentative new species. Given the increasing number of putative new species in Centrolenidae, establishing candidate species aims to better organize and maintain the growing discovery of undescribed lineages. Importantly, designating a divergent lineage as a putative new species does not necessarily mean it is a new species; rather, the system is meant to identify these lineages for future study, incorporating multiple lines of evidence (i.e., morphology, bioacoustics, biogeography, or nuclear genes) in order to determine their species status.\n\nCandidate species are typically identified through evidence from genetic distances or phylogenetic lineage divergence through widely used genetic markers that provide a basis for comparison (i.e., 12S, 16S, CO1; [29,53]). In this study, we used the mitochondrial genetic markers 12S, 16S, and ND1 and integrated evidence from genetic distances and phylogenetic relationships to identify candidate species. We first used a threshold of 3% in identifying divergent lineages, which is a threshold that most named centrolenid species exceed (this study). Putative new species were then numbered using a scheme of “sp_CaXX”, with numbering beginning at 01 for each genus. Finally, we note that Vieites et al. [29] also uses “unconfirmed” and “confirmed” designations, whereas “confirmed” candidate species have additional evidence (morphology or calls) for their status as species and are simply awaiting detailed analyses and subsequent description. We did not use these designations, as most putative new centrolenid species are supported only through mitochondrial genetic divergence.\n\nPhylogenetics—the analyzed dataset contains complete or partial sequences of 10 genes representing 6513 bp of data (mitochondrial: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ND1; nuclear: BDNF, C-MYC exon 2, CXCR4, NCX1, POMC, RAG1, SLC8A3). See Tables S2 and S3 for details. Analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BA) criteria. We did not perform searches under the parsimony criterion because of its limitations under certain conditions (long branch attraction; [54,55]) and lack of theoretical support for transition/transversion bias and variation in substitution rates among different nucleotide sites [56]. The 12S and 16S rRNA sequence data were aligned using MAFFT 7.4 [57], using the Q-INS-i algorithm that takes RNA secondary structure into consideration. Protein coding genes were also aligned in MAFFT using the AUTO function and manually inspected for accuracy and open reading frames.\n\nMaximum likelihood was run in the IQ-TREE v1.5.5 software [58]. The data were automatically partitioned, and the best model was implemented using ModelFinder within IQ-TREE [59], which groups partitions with the same model and similar rates and simultaneously searches model and tree space. Node support was assessed via 100 ultra-fast bootstrap replicates [60].\n\nFor Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and divergence dating, we used BEAST v2.4.5 [61]. We used a single secondary calibration point using ages estimated from Hutter et al. [62], which estimates divergence dates for Hyloidea using 18 genetic markers and 8 fossil/geographic calibrations. We used median age of Centrolenidae with a normal distribution to capture the 95% confidence interval from this study (Mean = 33.4 Myr; Sigma = 6). We used a single uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock prior linked across all partitions. We partitioned data by codon position for protein-coding genes and used the Bayesian bModelTest package within BEAST to select the best model for each partition. We estimated the relaxed clock rate using an initial value of 1e-9 and a broad prior (in our case, a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.001 and scale parameter of 1000). We used a Yule speciation process for the tree prior. We ran Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) searches for a total of 100 million generations, sampling every 10,000 generations. Stationarity was assessed by examining the standard deviation of the split frequencies and by plotting the -lnL per generation, using Tracer v1.5 [63]; trees generated before stationarity were discarded as “burn-in”, which was 20% of trees.\n\nSpecies conservation status—global and local (Ecuador) conservation status of glassfrogs follow the categorization and criteria established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [64] (Figure 17), including rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of distribution fragmentation. The following categories were used: (i) Not Evaluated: The species has not yet been evaluated against the criteria, (ii) Data Deficient: There is inadequate information to make a direct or indirect assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status, (iii) Least Concern: The species is widespread and abundant and not under immediate risk of extinction, (iv) Near Threatened: For species that are not currently threatened, but are close to qualifying for or are likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future, (v) Vulnerable: A taxon is Vulnerable when it is considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild (Criteria A to E for Vulnerable), (vi) Endangered: When the species is considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild (Criteria A to E for Endangered), (vii) Critically Endangered: When the species is considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild (Criteria A to E for Critically Endangered), (viii) Extinct in the Wild: When the species is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity, or as a naturalized population, outside its historical range. A taxon is presumed Extinct in the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitats, at appropriate times, throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual, (ix) Extinct: When there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual of the species has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitats, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual.\n\n2.4. Biogeographic Regions of Ecuador\n\nIn this study, we applied biogeographic regions of continental Ecuador as a simplification of vegetation types [65,66] (Figure 18). This system has the virtue of combining the characteristics of the vegetation and the historic isolation between the western and eastern slopes of the Andes and the eastern and western lowlands. Mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature for each of the recognized regions are shown in Table 2. We also summarized the land cover of Ecuador, illustrating which ecosystems have suffered intensive deforestation and which are still preserved (Table 3, Figure 18).\n\nDry Shrub—characterized by a combination of warm and extremely dry conditions. Annual precipitation can be as low as 60 mm in the westernmost locality (Salinas, Santa Elena Province). This region covers an area of 8033 km2 and is restricted to the coastal margin of central Ecuador (Figure 18). In some areas, grasses introduced for raising livestock have replaced native plants. In the drier habitats, xerophytic plants are dominant, especially cacti and other thorny plants [67].\n\nWestern Deciduous Forest—this forest occurs at an elevation of 50–300 m in central and northern Ecuador (100–400 m in southern Ecuador) and covers 25,673 km2 (10.3% of Ecuadorian territory, Figure 18). Conditions are drier and the terrain has lower tree densities than in evergreen forests. The trees are generally shorter than 20 m with an understory that can be dense with abundant herbaceous plants. Some tree species lose their leaves during the dry season [67]. More than half of the land cover of this habitat type has been converted for agriculture and grazing cattle.\n\nChocoan Tropical Rainforest—this rainforest is the second largest biogeographic region in Ecuador, with 31,732 km2 at elevations ranging from sea level to 300 m (Figure 18). It has a closed canopy with trees that can reach 30 m in height and with an understory dominated by ferns and Araceae [67]. Tree diversity is high, with more than 100 species/ha with diameter at breast height >10 cm, but lower than in the Amazonian Tropical Rainforest [68]. Habitat destruction rate in this region is the highest in Ecuador and only 18.3% of its natural vegetation remains.\n\nWestern Foothill Forest—this forest covers 15,305 km2 on the western Andean slopes with an elevational range of 300–1300 m (400–1000 m in southern Ecuador). Plant endemism is high, especially between latitudes 0° and 3° S [67]. This forest is structurally similar to its counterpart from the eastern Andean slope, although the amphibian communities are highly differentiated.\n\nFigure 18. Land use, biogeographic regions, and provinces of Ecuador. Land cover: Modified from Ron et al. [66]; “Mosaics” are mixtures of natural vegetation and either agricultural land or pastures. “Other” includes urban areas, shrimp farms, lakes, rivers, glaciers, and sand banks. Biogeographic regions: Shown as a simplification of vegetation types (Sierra et al. [65], as modified by Ron et al. [66]). Provinces: Provinces are divided into three broad geographic regions: Coast, Andes, and Amazon.\n\nWestern Montane Forest—this evergreen forest covers 21,576 km2 at an elevational range between 1300–3400 m (1000–3000 m in southern Ecuador; Figure 18). The canopy is generally below 25 m with a high abundance of epiphytic plants (especially mosses, ferns, orchids, and bromeliads). At intermediate elevations, especially during the afternoon, the forests become misty and receive horizontal precipitation from low, overhanging clouds. Western Montane Forest is restricted to narrow stretches between the basin of the Mira River (close to the Colombian border) and the basins of the Chanchán and Chimbo rivers (2° S). It is replaced by drier habitats (principally Andean Shrub) south of 4° S, close to the border with Peru. Only 35% of its natural vegetation remains unaltered (Table 3).\n\nPáramo—this is the vegetation type that reaches the highest elevation and covers 15,976 ha (6.1% of the territory; Figure 18). Depending on the region, its lower limit lies between 3000 and 3600 m. Short herbaceous plants generally forming tight clumps dominate the vegetation. The plants are adapted to cold temperatures and to low availability of water. Open grassy areas predominate but are mixed with small patches of forest or shrubs [69]. At higher elevations, the vegetation is restricted to sparse clumps on otherwise bare land. Because of the occurrence of frequent freezes, agriculture is limited, and this has ameliorated anthropogenic habitat degradation. In this region, only 21.1% of the natural vegetation has been cleared or severely fragmented, the lowest proportion for any region (Table 3). However, the Páramo is the region with the highest proportion of endangered amphibians.\n\nAndean Shrub—this biogeographic region lies between 1400 and 3000 m and has an area of 11,266 km2; it is found in the inter-Andean basins between the Cordillera Occidental and Cordillera Oriental (Figure 18). As a result of rain shadow effects from both mountain chains, the Andean Shrub has a relatively low precipitation (Table 2). Although originally dominated by shrubs, most of the vegetation has been replaced by crops, pastures, or forests of exotic trees (Eucalyptus and Pinus; [69]). In dry valleys (e.g., Chota, Guayllabamba, and Patate) the native vegetation is spiny. Andean Shrub is almost unrepresented in the Ecuadorian National System of Protected Areas. Habitat degradation is severe; more than half the land cover is devoted to agriculture or to raising cattle (Table 3).\n\nEastern Montane Forest—this forest covers 31,555 km2 between 1300 m and 3600 m on the eastern Andean slopes (Figure 18). The vegetation is structurally similar to that from the Western Montane Forest. Above 2900 m, the soil of the forest is covered by moss and the trees are irregularly shaped [69].\n\nEastern Foothill Forest—this evergreen forest covers 13,133 km2 between elevations of 600 m and 1300 m (Figure 18), and is a mixture of tree species from the Andes and the lowlands of the Amazon Basin [68]. The canopy reaches up to 30 m in height and encloses a dense sub-canopy and understory. Tree diversity is lower (130 species/ha, >10 cm DBH) [68] than in the Amazonian Tropical Forest. Average annual precipitation is the second highest of all regions (2833 mm).\n\nAmazonian Tropical Rainforest—the Amazonian Tropical Rainforest is the most extensive biogeographic region in Ecuador with a total area of 73,909 km2 (29.8% of the Ecuadorian continental territory; Figure 18). It is restricted to elevations below 600 m and has the highest average annual precipitation of any region (3349 mm). The dominant forest type, Terra Firme, is characterized by well-drained soils. The canopy is 10–30 m high, punctuated with emergent trees up to 40 m (and rarely 50 m); small gaps created by fallen trees [68,70] are common. Tree diversity is high with 200–300 species of trees/ha (>10 cm DBH) [68,70]. Other vegetation types in this region include Várzea forest (flooded with white water), Igapó forest (flooded with black water), riparian woodland forest, river island scrub, and Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps [68,71]. At the local scale (≤100 km2), amphibian diversity reaches its global peak in the Amazonian Tropical Rainforest of Ecuador [72,73].\n\n2.5. Potential Distribution\n\nEstimating the distribution of a species is challenging, since biotic, abiotic, and historic factors come into play. As an approximation to species distributions and being aware of the associated caveats [74,75], we modelled the ecological niche of all species for which we had at least 10 independent localities (>1 km apart). Given that our ecological models did not include variables such as biotic interactions, random extinction, vagility, influence of diseases or introduced species, we used our results only as proxy, and are fully aware that predicted areas might be, in most cases, overestimated; nevertheless, models are useful for conservations assessments. Locality data were obtained from the following museums: AMNH, BMNH, FHGO, KU, QCAZ, MECN, MZUTI, ZSFQ, and USNM. All specimens were directly examined by Juan M. Guayasamin or Diego F. Cisneros-Heredia.\n\nWe used all 19 climatic variables from the WorldClim database (www.worldclim.org). These bioclimatic variables are derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values [76]. A correlation analysis was used to determine independent variables for the distribution of each species. The potential distributions of centrolenid species were estimated using default settings in Maxent v. 3.3.3k [77,78]. We used 70% of the presence records as training data, and the other 30% was used to evaluate the model. Maxent was run 10 times to obtain the ecological model for each species. In order to evaluate models, we employed the area under the curve (AUC), a value that is an indicator of model performance [77,79]. The AUC value was calculated in Maxent and ranges between 0.5 (random classification) and 1 (perfect fit). We discarded models that had AUC values below 0.7 [80]. Maxent continuous models were reclassified in order to obtain a binary map of potential presence or absence, using the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity threshold (MTS + S), a method that has been shown to produce highly accurate predictions [81,82]. The potential distribution models were edited using ArcMap v.10 to obtain more realistic estimates of species distributions by removing areas predicted as present that are located in inaccessible biogeographic regions (e.g., species restricted to the Amazon basin predicted as present in the Chocó and vice versa; species from the Pacific slope of the Andes predicted as present in the Amazonian slope and vice versa).\n\nImpacts of human activities to species—in order to build a layer of human impact (LHI) for Ecuador, we used shape files containing information on land use, roads, human settlements, human population density, mining, and oil exploration and concession shape files (ESRI, 2003). The original shape files were converted to raster files in ArcMap v. 10; we then calculated Euclidean distances in each raster file to compute buffer areas around specific features (i.e., roads, oil fields), giving values according to the intensity of human impact and distance from the specific human activity (Table 4). In the case of population density, the intensity value was equal to the logarithmic scale of the population density value for each grid cell. We obtained raster layers with buffer zones and intensity values for each of the impacts, which were added using the map calculator tool (ArcMap v. 10) to obtain a single map summarizing all considered threats.\n\n2.6.

Phylogenetic Systematics\n\nThe relationships among glassfrog genera are shown in Figure 19. We also included a tree for each genus that occurs in Ecuador. These trees are the source of evidence for generic placement and comments on the evolutionary relationships among species discussed below and are summarized in Table S1. Each genus was well supported and congruent with the trees estimated by Guayasamin et al. [1,2], Castroviejo-Fisher et al. [3], and Twomey et al. [19], with only a few differences resulting from our improved taxon sampling. There was significant support (ML: Greater than 95% bootstrap [BS]; BA: Greater than 0.95 posterior probability [PP]) for all genera.\n\n3.2. Potential Distribution\n\nThe area of the potential distribution of each glassfrog species is summarized in Table S5. AUCs associated to each model are reported in Table S4. The species with the largest area of potential distribution was Cochranella resplendens (77,792 km2), whereas the species with the most restricted predicted distribution was Centrolene heloderma (1067 km2). The areas with the highest impacts were the interandean valleys and the Pacific lowlands; these were also areas with the highest population density. In terms of distribution and range extensions, agriculture and ranching were the activities that had the highest impact on habitats. Other activities with high impact values are related to mining and the oil industry.\n\n4. Species Accounts\n\nGenus Centrolene Jiménez de la Espada, 1872 [83]\n\nEtymology: The name Centrolene is derived from the Greek words kéntron (point or spur) and ōlénē (elbow, forearm), alluding to the humeral spine found in males of this genus [84]. Although the name Centrolene has been used as neuter in gender for almost 150 years, now, because of an intricate game of words and nomenclatural regulations, it is considered to be feminine [85], creating nomenclatural instability that, in our opinion, was unnecessary. Centrolene is the type genus for the family Centrolenidae.\n\nCentrolenella ballux Duellman and Burrowes, 1989 [86]. Holotype: KU 164725.\n\nType locality: “14 km (by road) west of Chiriboga (00°18′ S, 78°49′ W), 1960 m, Provincia de Pichincha, Ecuador” (now in Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas).\n\nCentrolene ballux—Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1991 [6].\n\n“Centrolene” ballux—Guayasamin, Castroviejo-Fisher, Trueb, Ayarzagüena, Rada, and Vilà, 2009 [1].\n\nCommon names: English: Gold-dust Glassfrog. Spanish: Rana de Cristal Polvo de Oro.\n\nEtymology: The specific name ballux is Latin; it means “gold dust” and is used in reference to the minute gold flecks on the dorsum [86].\n\nIdentification: On the Pacific versant of the Ecuadorian Andes, only Nymphargus buenaventura and some populations of N. griffithsi are similar to Centrolene ballux in having a green dorsum with small light spots (Figure 20), but they differ by possessing basal webbing between outer fingers (moderate webbing in C. ballux), concealed prepollex (distinct in C. ballux), and lacking humeral spines (present in males of C. ballux). The Colombian “Centrolene” robledoi resembles C. ballux; both lack vomerine teeth, have a small series of white spots on flanks, and have a similar webbing and snout shape. However, C. robledoi has small dark spots on its dorsum (absent in C. ballux), concealed prepollex (distinct in C. ballux), and is slightly larger than C. ballux (males, SVL 19.9–24.4 mm in C. robledoi; 19.2–22.2 mm in C. ballux). Centrolene peristicta and C. lynchi are sympatric with C. ballux in several localities, but the two species can be distinguished by having dorsal dark and light minute spots (only light spots present in C. ballux; Figure 20).\n\nDiagnosis: (1) Vomers lacking teeth; (2) snout bluntly rounded to truncated in dorsal and lateral profiles (Figure 21); (3) tympanum oriented almost vertically, ED/TD = 31%–34%; tympanic annulus visible except for dorsal border covered by supratympanic fold; tympanic membrane partially pigmented, differentiated from surrounding skin; (4) dorsal surfaces shagreen with small warts; (5) pair of enlarged subcloacal tubercles (Figure 15); (6) anterior two-thirds of ventral parietal peritoneum white, posterior third transparent (condition P3); silvery white pericardium; no iridophores in peritonea covering intestines, stomach, testes, kidneys, gall bladder, and urinary bladder (condition V1); (7) liver tetralobed, lacking iridophores (condition H0); (8) humeral spines present in adult males; (9) no webbing between Fingers I and II, webbing between Fingers II and III basal or absent; webbing formula for outer fingers: III (21/4–23/4)—(2–2+) IV (Figure 21C); (10) webbing formula on foot: I 1—(2–2+) II 1—(2–2+) III (1–1+)—(2–21/3) IV 21/2—(1–11/3) V; (11) ulnar fold low, white; inner tarsal fold low; outer tarsal fold absent, but small white tubercles evident along ventrolateral margin of tarsus; (12) distinct prepollex, clearly separated from Finger I; in males, nuptial pad Type I; (13) Finger II slightly longer than Finger I (Finger I 91.4%–98.0% of Finger II); (14) disc of Finger III of moderate size, about 47.4%–59.3% of eye diameter; (15) in life, dorsum green with small white warts; upper lip white; bones green; (16) in preservative, dorsal surfaces lavender with small white and/or unpigmented spots, particularly evident on limbs; (17) iris whitish cream with dark-grey thin reticulation and pale yellow hue around pupil; (18) melanophores mostly absent from fingers and toes, except for a few on Toes IV and V and on base of Finger IV; (19) males call from the upper side of leaves; call emitted sporadically and consisting of a single short note (328.5–420.4 ms) with 7–9 pulses; mean dominant frequency at peak amplitude 4833 Hz ± 14 (range 444–464); notes are frequency modulated (Márquez et al. 1996); (20) fighting behavior unknown; (21) eggs deposited on the upper sides of leaves; short-term maternal care unknown; long-term parental care absent; (22) tadpoles undescribed; (23) minute body size; SVL 19.2–22.2 mm (X = 20.6 ± 0.911, n = 25) in males; SVL 21.0–23.3 mm (n = 3) in females.\n\nFigure 20.

Guayasamin.\n\nColor in life (Figure 20): Dorsum lime green with small greenish–white to yellowish–white warts; fingers and toes yellowish green; anterior two-thirds of ventral parietal peritoneum white; visceral peritoneum lacking iridophores; pericardium silvery white; bones green; upper lip yellowish white to white; iris cream white with fine black reticulations.\n\nColor in ethanol: Dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs lavender with small white and/or unpigmented warts; hands and Toes I–III mostly unpigmented; margin of upper lip white; ulnar fold white; small tubercles on outer ventrolateral margin of tarsus white; small white tubercles posterior to cloacal opening; ventral surfaces cream. Anterior two-thirds of the ventral parietal peritoneum white, posterior third transparent; silvery white pericardium; no iridophores in peritonea covering intestines, stomach, testes, kidneys, gall bladder, and urinary bladder.\n\nBiology and ecology: Individuals are active at night on the upper surfaces of leaves of bushes and trees 50–800 cm above and along small streams, or on ferns over roadside ditches (Arteaga et al. 2013). The reproductive activity of Centrolene ballux occurs in the rainy season (December–April [87]). One male (IND-AN 1725) was on a leaf 5 cm below another leaf on which there was a clutch of 18 eggs [86]. Another clutch found at La Planada had 13 eggs. Near Chiriboga, a gravid female (KU 164729) with green eggs and five adult males were found along a stream on 8 May 1975. At Reserva Las Gralarias, on March 2009, a clutch with 21 embryos was found on the upper side of a leaf, which was hidden by another leaf; an adult male was observed nearby (ca. 100 cm from the clutch). Centrolene ballux is relatively abundant at Reserva Las Gralarias, where it maintains reproductive populations along several streams (Ballux Creek, Five-frog Creek, Heloderma Creek, Chalguayacu River, Kathy’s Creek; [88]). It is unknown if females provide short-term parental care to egg clutches; males do not exhibit parental care [25].\n\nCall (Figure 22): The advertisement call of Centrolene ballux was described from Las Palmeras, Ecuador, by Márquez et al. [89]. The call was emitted sporadically and consisted of a single short note (328.5–420.4 ms, n = 2) with 7–9 pulses, the first 4–5 being repeated at short, regular intervals, and the last three pulses being emitted at longer intervals (mean pulses per second = 21.0 ± 0.1, range 21.3–21.4). The dominant frequency was high (mean dominant frequency at peak amplitude 4833 Hz ± 14). The notes were frequency modulated (dominant frequency at the beginning of note is lower than at its end). Recordings obtained at Reserva Las Gralarias, Ecuador, match this description.\n\nFigure 22. Call of Centrolene ballux from Reserva Las Gralarias, Pichincha province, Ecuador.\n\nTadpole: Not described.\n\nDistribution (Figure 23): Centrolene ballux is known from six localities in the cloud forests of Carchi, Imbabura, Pichincha, and Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas provinces (Ecuador) and one in the department of Nariño (Colombia) on the Pacific slopes of the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes at elevation between 1780 and 2340 m [86,87,89] (Specimens Examined). The species inhabits the Western Montane Forest ecoregion. In Ecuador, it has a potential distribution of 4752 km2.\n\nConservation status: Globally, Centrolene ballux is currently listed as Endangered by the IUCN [90]. In Ecuador, the most recent records of the species are from Reserva Las Gralarias (March 2018) and Reserva Río Manduriacu (2008) [21]. In Colombia, the last published record is from Reserva La Planada on April–June 1986 [86]. Recent surveys at Quebrada Zapadores and Las Palmeras (= Río Guajalito) have been unsuccessful in finding this species [91] (DFCH unpubl. data). During the rainy seasons (December–April) of 2011–2018, reproductive populations were observed in four streams at Reserva Las Gralarias. The species has a very restricted distribution, with only five known localities in Ecuador, in an area where forest fragmentation is common. At Reserva Las Gralarias, the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infects C. ballux with a relatively high prevalence, but no recent declines have been recorded [92].\n\nEvolutionary relationships (Figure 24): Centrolene ballux and C. buckleyi are sister species.\n\nSpecimens examined: Centrolene ballux: Ecuador: Provincia de Carchi: ca. 5 km W La Gruel (0.916667 N, 78.13333 W; 2340 m), KU 202798. Provincia de Pichincha: Reserva Las Gralarias (0.00806 S, 78.72433 W, 1852 m), QCAZ 40195–99; Quebrada Zapadores, 5 km ESE of Chiriboga on Chiriboga–Quito road (0.245278 S, 78.7261 W, 2010 m), KU 164733.

Evolutionary relationships among species in the genus Centrolene, inferred using maximum likelihood and Bayesian criteria.\n\nHylella buckleyi Boulenger, 1882 [93]. Syntypes: BM 78.1.25.16 (Intac), 80.12.5.201 (Pallatanga). See comments below on type material. Neotype: KU 202770.\n\nNeotype locality: Isla Wolf of Laguna Cuicocha (0°18′07″ N, 78°22′00″ W; 3070 m), Provincia Imbabura, Ecuador, collected on 28 February 1984 by W. E.

Type locality: “San Pedro, N of Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia”. Synonymy by Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1991 [6].\n\nCentrolene buckleyi—Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1991 [6].\n\nCommon names: English: Buckley’s Glassfrog. Spanish: Rana de Cristal de Buckley.\n\nEtymology: The specific name buckleyi was used to recognize Mr. Buckley, who collected the type series of the species.\n\nIdentification: Centrolene buckleyi is one of the few species of glassfrogs found in the highlands of Ecuador (2050–3070 m). It is easily recognized by the presence of a large humeral spine (in adult males), white upper lip, inclined snout in lateral profile, and reduced webbing between fingers (Figure 25 and Figure 26). In life, dorsal surfaces are uniform green, but some individuals have small whitish warts. Centrolene heloderma and C. condor can be confused with C. buckleyi; however, C. heloderma has a pustular dorsal skin (shagreen in C. buckleyi) and C. condor has small light and dark spots on the dorsum (dark spots absent in C. buckleyi). Similar species from other countries include Centrolene hesperia, C. lemniscata (Peru), C. altitudinalis, and C. venezuelensis (Venezuela). We note that, as currently defined, C. buckleyi is a species complex that requires further taxonomic studies.\n\nFigure 25. Centrolene buckleyi in life. (Left): Adult male from locality near Oyacachi, Napo province, 3012 m, MZUTI 763, photo by Eduardo Toral. (Right): Adult male from Guarumales, Zamora Chinchipe province, 2070 m, CJ-11364, photo by Diego Acosta-López.\n\nComments on type material: The description of Centrolene buckleyi was based on two specimens housed at The Natural History Museum, London (formerly British Museum of Natural History). As noted by Goin [97] and Lynch and Duellman [22], one syntype (BMNH 80.12.5.201; from Pallatanga, Provincia de Chimborazo, Ecuador) is now almost completely macerated in ethanol and almost no bones remain, and the other (BMNH 78.1.25.16; from Intac, Imbabura province, Ecuador) is missing and recent searches by Jeff Streicher and DFCH were unsuccessful. Both localities are on the western versant of the Andes of Ecuador, on the slopes of the Cordillera Occidental. Because Centrolene buckleyi represents a species complex [20,98] (Figure 24), we here designate a neotype for Centrolene buckleyi (KU 202770, adult female) collected from Laguna de Cuicocha (near the syntype locality of Intac = Intag), thereby allowing clear comparisons among populations that might represent independent lineages. The morphological characteristics of the neotype fully correspond to those mentioned by Boulenger [93] in the original description of the species. Additionally, mitochondrial sequences of the neotype are included in the phylogeny shown in Figure 24. The designation of the neotype is justified on the Article 75.3 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature [99].\n\nDiagnosis: (1) Vomers lacking teeth; (2) snout round in dorsal aspect, slightly sloping to sloping in lateral profile (Figure 26); (3) tympanum partially or completely hidden under skin, when visible oriented almost vertically, its diameter is 29.0%–38.6% of eye diameter; supratympanic fold moderately heavy; tympanic membrane slightly thinner than skin around tympanum; (4) dorsal skin finely shagreen, males with spicules; (5) pair of round subcloacal warts (Figure 26); (6) anterior half to two-thirds of venter covered by white parietal peritoneum, posterior portion translucent (condition P2–P3); silvery white pericardium; translucent peritoneum covering intestines, stomach, testes, kidneys, gall bladder, and urinary bladder (condition V1); (7) liver with four or five lobes, lacking iridophores (condition H0); (8) in males, humeral spines present; (9) webbing absent between Fingers I, II, and III; reduced webbing between outer fingers: III (21/4–3−)—(2+–21/2) IV (Figure 26); (10) webbing formula on foot: I (11/2–2−)—(2–21/4) II (1−–1+)—(2+–21/2) III (1+–12/3)—(21/3–3) IV (22/3–3)—(12/3–2−) V; (11) ulnar fold low, ventrolateral margin of arm white; inner tarsal fold evident; outer tarsal fold absent, external ventrolateral margin of tarsus white; (12) concealed prepollex; in males, nuptial pad Type I; (13) Finger II slightly longer than Finger I (Finger I 86.5%–98.7% of Finger II); (14) disc of Finger III of moderate size, about 54.2%–64.5% of eye diameter; (15) in life, dorsum uniform green that may have scattered whitish warts; upper lip white, usually continuing as a white line across the flanks; bones green; (16) in preservative, pericardium and anterior half to two-thirds of ventral parietal peritoneum white, visceral peritoneum translucent, peritoneum around kidneys translucent; (17) iris grey-white with thin black reticulation and a horizontal brown stripe; (18) melanophores mostly absent from fingers and toes, except for a few on Toes IV and V and on base of outer fingers; (19) males call from the upper sides of leaves; two call descriptions available (see Call section); (20) males fight upside down, grasping one another venter to venter; (21) eggs deposited on the upper sides of leaves; females provide short-term parental care; prolonged parental care is absent; (22) tadpoles unknown; egg clutches deposited within male’s territory, but parental care has not been reported; (23) medium body size, SVL in males 26.5–30.9 mm (X = 29.0; n = 25), in females 29.3–34.4 mm (X = 31.2; n = 9).\n\nFigure 26.

Ecuador, Imbabura province, Isla Grande, Lago Cuicocha, 3070 m. Photos by Juan M. Guayasamin.\n\nColor in life (Figure 25): Dorsal surfaces bright to dark green, sharply demarcated laterally from lower white flanks; throat and most of venter pale green; parietal peritoneum yellowish white; edge of upper lip white; ventrolateral borders of arms and tarsus white; small, white warts posterior to cloacal opening; bones green; grey–white iris with thin black reticulation and a horizontal brown stripe. Some individuals have whitish warts on dorsum (QCAZ 22388, 26031–32) or small white spots on legs and forearms (KU 202770)\n\nColor in ethanol (Figure 27): Dorsum of head and body uniform lavender or with minute whitish or unpigmented spots; limbs cream with slight lavender tone and with or without small white spots; conspicuous white border on the upper lip; dorsally, all fingers, Toes I–III, and most of Toe IV unpigmented; ventrolateral borders of arms and tarsus white; cloacal region mostly unpigmented, except for several white warts posterior to cloacal opening; males with cream nuptial pad on Finger I. Three specimens (QCAZ 26031–32, KU 178042) were dissected to observe coloration of internal organs: Anterior half to two-thirds of ventral parietal peritoneum white; pericardium white; hepatic peritoneum transparent; peritonea covering viscera and kidneys translucent to opaque.\n\nBiology and ecology: During the day, Centrolene buckleyi has been found in terrestrial and arboreal bromeliads near and away from streams in secondary forest and pastures (J. D. Lynch, W. E. Duellman field notes). During the night, Centrolene buckleyi were active on terrestrial bromeliads and vegetation 30–160 cm above streams, lakes, and marshes in primary and secondary forests ([20,22], this work). Lynch and Duellman [22] suggested that C. buckleyi might breed in the same situations as other centrolenids—rapid, mountain streams—but also in bromeliads or in ciénegas; they based this statement on the observation of an egg clutch (KU 170221) on the inner leaf of bromeliad in an area where C. buckleyi was abundant. Males fight dangling upside down while holding onto vegetation with their hind limbs, grasping one another venter to venter (Bolívar et al. 1999). A male (QCAZ 22388) was found on the upper side of a leaf close to another leaf with a clutch of eggs, approximately 160 cm above a stream [20]. Females provide short-term parental care to egg clutches; males do not exhibit parental care [25].\n\nCall (Figure 28): Two descriptions of the call of Centrolene buckleyi are available in the literature [20,100]. The differences between these calls, combined with the non-monophyly of C. buckleyi (Figure 24), clearly show that Centrolene buckleyi, as currently recognized, represents a species complex [20,98]. Below we describe a call from the highlands of Ecuador (MZUTI 763; see Examined Specimens); although the call presented herein is not from the neotype locality, genetically, it clusters together with samples from the type locality; thus, apparently corresponding to the same species. Calls are produced in series, every 45–67 s (mean = 53 ± 9.9; n = 10). Each call has a single, highly pulsed note, with a duration of 0.248–0.288 s (mean = 0.264 ± 13.7; n = 10; Figure 23). Calls have a slight frequency modulation, with an initial dominant frequency at 2816–2941 Hz (mean = 2893 ± 38; n = 10) and a final dominant frequency at 3222–3255 Hz (mean = 3229 ± 12; n = 10). First harmonics are at 5385–6393 Hz.\n\nFigure 28. Call of Centrolene buckleyi, MZUTI 763. Recorded at páramo wetland nearby Oyacachi, 3012 m, Napo province, Ecuador.\n\nTadpole: Not described.\n\nDistribution (Figure 29): The Centrolene buckleyi species complex occurs through the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador to Huacambamba in the Departamento de Piura in northern Peru at elevations between 2450 and 3300 m ([17,101,102], this work). Records below 2450 m are considered dubious. In Ecuador, Centrolene buckleyi is found along the Cordillera Oriental and Cordillera Occidental of the Andes, and inhabits the Western Montane Forest, Andean Shrub, Páramo, and Eastern Montane Forest ecoregions, with a potential distribution of 44,586 km2.\n\nFigure 29. Distribution of the species complex currently recognized as Centrolene buckleyi in Ecuador (yellow dots).\n\nConservation status: Centrolene buckleyi is listed as Vulnerable at a global level by the IUCN [103]. In Ecuador, Centrolene buckleyi was abundant along the high Andes, but recent fieldwork demonstrates population crashes at historical localities (e.g., Pilaló, Cuicocha, Cashca Totoras, Quito, San Pablo de Atenas, Papallacta) ([91], JMG pers. obs.). The last records of the species in Ecuador are from Bosque Protector Cashca-Totoras in 2002 [91], Morán on February 2017 (Diego Batallas, pers. com., Mario Yánez-Muñoz, pers. com.); Yanayacu Biological Station in 2001–2003 [20], Sigchos (0°42′ S, 78°53′ W; 2080 m) on March 2008, Zamorahuaico, near Loja (3°59′ S, 79°12′ W; 2100 m) on August 2008, and nearby Oyacachi (3012 m) on May 2012. The habitat (Páramo, Andean shrub, and montane forest) occupied by the species is heavily impacted by human activities, mainly agriculture and pasture lands. Considering that that populations declines are widespread in the species complex, we suggest the category of Critically Endangered in Ecuador (IUCN criteria A2c,e).\n\nEvolutionary relationships (Figure 24): As defined herein, Centrolene buckleyi is sister to Centrolene ballux. See Taxonomic Remarks.\n\nTaxonomic Remarks: Centrolene buckleyi is a species complex that requires formal subdivision [20,98]. Moreover, morphologically, Centrolene buckleyi is almost identical to four Andean species, namely C. altitudinalis, C. venezuelensis (Venezuela), Centrolene hesperia, and C. lemniscata (Peru). Myers and Donnelly [104] elevated the Venezuelan populations of Centrolene buckleyi (Centrolenella buckleyi venezuelensis Rivero, 1968 [105]) to the species status, without morphological justification; Señaris and Ayarzagüena [106] provided morphological and acoustic data supporting the recognition of Centrolene venezuelensis. The original descriptions of C. hesperia and C. lemniscata did not include a comparison between these species and C. buckleyi; therefore, a reevaluation of their species status is necessary. Genetic [20,98] and morphological [105,106] differences support the validity of Centrolene altitudinalis; for example, the lower two-thirds of the tympanic annulus is visible in C. altitudinalis, whereas the tympanum is completely or mostly concealed in C. buckleyi, C. lemniscata, and C. hesperia. Also, we call attention to the conspicuous geographical barriers that have the potential of limiting gene flow among these species. The Peruvian C. hesperia and C. lemniscata are isolated from other species by the Huacambamba Depression, and isolated from each other by interandean valleys. Likewise, the Venezuelan C. venezuelensis and C. altitudinalis are isolated from other species by the Táchira Depression. The distribution of C. buckleyi is restricted, mostly, to the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia, but these populations, based on genetic and call data, represent several independent evolutionary lineages (Figure 24). Thus, clearly, further work is necessary within this species complex.\n\nMeasurements of neotype (in mm): The morphometric data for the neotype (female, KU 202770) are as follows: SVL = 32.6; tibia length = 16.8; foot length = 15.1; head length = 9.3; head width = 10.3; interorbital distance = 3.3; upper eyelid width = 2.6; internarial distance = 2.8; eye-nostril distance = 2.2; snout-eye distance = 4.3; eye diameter = 4.6; tympanum diameter = —; eye-tympanum distance = —; radio-ulna length = 6.72; hand length = 10.4; Finger I length = 6.3; Finger II length = 6.7; disc of Finger III = 2.3; and Finger III width = 1.2.\n\nSpecimens examined: Centrolene buckleyi: Ecuador: Provincia del Azuay: 10 km N Girón (3.0833 S, 79.0833 W; 2750 m), KU 202777; 11.5 km SE Gualaceo (2.9333 S, 78.71667; 2940 m); Sigsig (3.05 S, 78.8 W; 2450), QCAZ 1245.

Holotype: MHNCP 13933.\n\nType locality: “near the village of La Oliva, past the village of Muyo (a larger village roughly 49 km N from Bagua), Amazonas, Peru (5°18′3.86″ S, 78°23′44.57″ W, 682 m)”.\n\nCommon names: English: Charapita Glassfrog. Spanish: Rana de Cristal Charapita.\n\nEtymology: The specific name charapita derives from a type of yellow chili pepper (ají charapita), which resembles the dorsal ocelli of the species [19].\n\nIdentification: Centrolene charapita is the only glassfrog with yellow dorsal ocelli, scalloped and enameled ulnar and tarsal folds (Figure 30), and relatively large size (adult male SVL = 34.7–37.0).\n\nFigure 30.

[19]): (1) Vomers with 4–10 vomerine teeth; (2) in Peruvian population, snout truncated in dorsal view and truncated to slightly rounded in profile; in Ecuadorian population, snout round in dorsal view and sloping in profile; (3) tympanum small, partially hidden under skin; supratympanic fold present; (4) dorsal skin smooth with microspicules and low enameled warts on ocelli; venter and thighs coarsely areolate, other ventral surfaces smooth; (5) cloacal ornamentation conspicuous, formed by enameled folded skin (flaps) surrounded by lower warts; pair of enlarged subcloacal warts; (6) anterior third-to-half of parietal peritoneum white, posterior portion transparent (state P2); pericardium, hepatic, renal, and gonadal peritonea transparent, visceral peritoneum white; (7) liver trilobed, lacking iridophores (state H0); (8) humeral spines absent; (9) no webbing between Fingers I and II; webbing formula for outer fingers: II 2−—31/3 III 2—(1+–11/3) IV; (10) webbing formula on foot: I (11/3–11/2)—(2−–2) II 1—(2−–21/3) III (1–1+)—(2–2+) IV (2–21/3)—1 V; (11) scalloped enameled ulnar and tarsal folds, extending from fringe on postaxial edge of Finger IV to elbow, and from fringe on postaxial edge of Toe V to ankle, respectively; (12) concealed prepollex; in males, nuptial pad Type I, not pigmented; (13) when appressed, Finger I about equal length or slightly longer than Finger II; (14) eye diameter about 2.5 times the width of disc on Finger III; (15) in life, dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces covered with yellow or pale green spots of different size (ocelli); upper lip and tip of finger and toes I, II, and III white (enameled); ventral surfaces not pigmented; bones green; (16) in preservative, dorsal surfaces and dorsolateral surfaces with cream spots of different size (ocelli), bearing enameled warts and microspicules set in a lavender-greyish reticulum; upper lip and tip of finger and toes I, II, and III white (enameled); ventral surfaces not pigmented; (17) iris in life off-white to light grey with yellow tones and black dots and reticulation, with black ring delimiting iris; in preservative, iris silvery white with black dots and reticulation, with black ring delimiting iris; (18) in life and preservative, tip of fingers and toes white (enameled), Finger IV and Toes IV and V pigmented, Finger II and Toe III not pigmented, but for a small group of melanophores towards the tip, Fingers and Toes I and II not pigmented; (19) males call from upper side of leaves; call not described; (20) fighting behavior unknown; (21) eggs deposition site unknown; parental care unknown; (22) tadpoles undescribed; (23) large size in adult males; SVL 34.7–37.0 mm (n = 5) in males; females unknown.\n\nColor in life (Figure 30): Modified from Twomey et al. [19]. Dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces green, with yellow or pale green spots of different size (ocelli). Upper lip and discs of fingers and toes I, II, and III white (enameled). Ventral surfaces, flanks, upper arms, Fingers I and II, and Toes I and II not pigmented. Iris delimited by a black ring, background coloration off white to light grey with yellow shades and black dots and reticulation. Anterior third-to-half of parietal peritoneum white, posterior portion transparent. Visceral peritoneum white. Hepatic peritoneum transparent.\n\nColor in ethanol: Obtained from Twomey et al. [19]. Dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces with relatively large cream spots bearing enameled warts and microspicules set in a lavender–greyish reticulum, which is formed by minute melanophores that are darker around the ocelli. Upper lip and tips of fingers and toes I, II, and III white (enameled). Ventral surfaces, flanks, upper arms, Fingers I and II, and Toes I and II not pigmented.\n\nBiology and ecology: Very little is known about Centrolene charapita. Twomey et al. [19] report that, at the type locality, individuals were found perched on riverine vegetation during the night, and that sympatric amphibians included Ameerega trivittata, Bolitoglossa altamazonica, Cochranella erminea, Hyloscirtus sp., Rulyrana mcdiarmidi, Pristimantis aff. acuminatus, Pristimantis sp., and Rhaebo glaberrimus. Parental care is unknown.\n\nCall: Unknown.\n\nTadpole: Not described.\n\nDistribution (Figure 31): Centrolene charapita is known from the type locality, a stream (5°18′3.86″ S, 78°23′44.57″ W, 682 m) near La Oliva, Peru [19], and Reserva Natural Maycu (4.2° S, 78.6° W, 940–1219 m) in southeast Ecuador.\n\nFigure 31. Distribution of Centrolene charapita in Ecuador (yellow dots).\n\nConservation status: The conservation status of Centrolene charapita has not been evaluated by the IUCN. In Ecuador, populations are within a private reserve (Reserva Natural Maycu). The whole distribution range of the species is within a mining concession. Based on IUCN criteriaB2, Ba, Bb(iii), we suggest that C. charapita should be considered as Critically Endangered in Ecuador.\n\nEvolutionary relationships (Figure 24): Our phylogeny places Centrolene charapita as the sister species to a clade formed by several Centrolene species. A previous analysis had inferred C. charapita as sister to C. geckoidea [19].\n\nSpecimens examined: Centrolene charapita: Ecuador: Provincia de Zamora Chinchipe: Reserva Natural Maycu (4.207° S, 78.630° W, QCAZ 66783; 4.222° S, 78.645° W, QCAZ 66786–87; 4.229° S, 78.616° W, QCAZ 66785; 4.226° S, 78.620° W, QCAZ 66784).\n\nCentrolene condor Cisneros-Heredia and Morales-Mite 2008 [107] (Figure 32 and Figure 33).\n\nCentrolene condor Cisneros-Heredia and Morales-Mite, 2008 [107].

Spanish: Rana de Cristal del Cóndor.\n\nEtymology: The name of this species is in reference to its type locality, Cordillera del Cóndor, a mountain chain shared by Ecuador and Peru [107].\n\nIdentification: Centrolene condor can be distinguished from all other glassfrogs by having a green dorsum with many small yellowish–white flecks and dark bluish-black/brown flecks and punctuations (Figure 32), sloping snout in lateral view, light labial stripe, vomerine teeth, small humeral spine in males, enameled ulnar fold, and enameled metatarsal fold followed by a row of distinct enameled tubercles along the outer edge of the tarsus. Among Ecuadorian centrolenids, only C. pipilata shares a similar dorsal pattern, but C. condor has vomerine teeth (absent in C. pipilata) and a small, curved humeral spine (larger and straight in C. pipilata).\n\nFigure 32.

Photo by Ana Almendáriz.\n\nDiagnosis: Centrolene condor is diagnosed by the following traits (modified from Cisneros-Heredia and Morales-Mite [107]): (1) Vomerine teeth present; (2) snout subacuminate in dorsal view and sloping in profile; nostrils slightly elevated, producing depression in the internarial area; (3) tympanic annulus visible, vertical, with slight dorsolateral orientation; tympanic membrane not differentiated from surrounding skin; (4) dorsal skin shagreen, but with low warts and abundant spicules; (5) ventral skin granular; subcloacal area also granular with several enameled warts; (6) upper two-thirds of parietal peritoneum covered by iridophores (condition P3), pericardium white, all other peritonea not covered by iridophores (condition V1); (7) liver lobed, lacking iridophores (condition H0); (8) small humeral spines present in adult males; (9) webbing absent between Fingers I and II, basal between II and III, moderate between outer fingers: III 2—2− IV; (10) webbing between toes moderate: I 11/2—2+ II 1—2+ III 1—2 IV 2—1 V; (11) enameled ulnar fold; enameled fringe on edge of toe V that continues into thin enameled metatarsal fold and then into row of enameled tubercles along outer edge of tarsus; (12) nuptial excrescences present, Type I; concealed prepollex; (13) first finger shorter than second; (14) eye diameter larger than width of disc on Finger III; (15) in life, green dorsum with abundant yellowish–white flecks and abundant dark flecks; green bones; (16) in preservative, dorsal surfaces greyish with slight lavender hue and abundant light and dark flecks; (17) in life, iris cream–yellow with fine dark reticulation; in preservative, iris light grey with fine dark reticulation; (18) melanophores absent from fingers and toes, except for few on dorsal surfaces of outer fingers and outer toes; (19) males call from upper side of leaves; call composed by two pulsed notes, with dominant frequency at 2.62–2.97 KHz; (20, 21, 22) parental care, fighting behavior, egg clutches, and tadpoles unknown; and (23) medium body size, SVL in adult males 23.2–27.6 mm (X = 25.4 ± 1.826; n = 5); females unknown.\n\nColor in life (Figure 32): Green dorsum with abundant yellowish–white flecks and dark punctuations. Enameled spots and yellowish–white flecks on arms and legs. Whitish–yellow labial line present. Enameled arm and leg folds. Green bones [107].\n\nColor in ethanol: Dorsal surfaces greyish with slight lavender tint, with abundant light and dark flecks. Anterior two-thirds of ventral parietal peritoneum white, pericardium white, all other peritonea lack white lining (modified from Cisneros-Heredia and Morales-Mite [107]).\n\nBiology and ecology: Centrolene condor is a recently described species and little information is available on its natural history. It is nocturnal and males call from amidst the leaves of riverine vegetation a few centimeters over water in mature elfin forest. The species seems to be fairly common at Loma Tigres Bajo, where about 30 males were heard calling [108]. Tadpoles have a bright red coloration and are benthic [108].\n\nCall: The advertisement call has a duration of 650–700 ms (n = 3); it is similar to a trill, composed of two pulsed notes; the first note has a duration of 435–510 ms and is conspicuously longer than the second (101–102 ms); the time between notes is 66–118 ms, and the dominant frequency is 2.62–2.97 KHz [108].\n\nTadpole: Not described.\n\nDistribution (Figure 33): Centrolene condor is endemic to Ecuador, from localities in the Cordillera del Cóndor, Ecuador, at an elevation of 1737–2920 m [107,108]. The species is distributed within the Eastern Montane Forest ecoregion. Additional searches in the Cordillera del Cóndor have not yielded additional localities for the species [108].\n\nConservation status: Centrolene condor is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN [109]. Given that the species is known from few localities in an isolated mountain range (Cordillera del Cóndor) with extensive mining activities and associated deforestation and contamination, we suggest considering the species as Endangered—EN B1ab(iii), at the global and local levels, in agreement with Almendáriz and Batallas [108].\n\nEvolutionary relationships (Figure 24): Terminals identified as Centrolene condor are placed in different positions in the tree. Thus, it is likely that more than one species is found in what is currently recognized as C. condor.\n\nSpecimens examined: Centrolene condor: Ecuador: Provincia Zamora Chinchipe: Destacamento Militar Cóndor Mirador, western slope of the Cordillera del Cóndor (03°18′25″ S, 78°23′36″ W, 1750–1850 m), QCAZ 37279.\n\nFigure 33. Distribution of Centrolene condor in Ecuador (yellow dots).\n\nCentrolene geckoidea Jiménez de la Espada 1872 [83] (Figure 34, Figure 35 and Figure 36).\n\nCentrolene geckoideum Jiménez de la Espada, 1872 [83]. Holotype: MNCN 1596.\n\nType locality: “las riberas del río Napo en el Ecuador”. See comment in Distribution.\n\nCentrolene geckoidea—Barrio-Amorós, Rojas-Runjaic, and Señaris, 2019 [85].\n\nCommon names: English: Gecko Glassfrog. Spanish: Rana de Cristal Geco.\n\nEtymology: The specific epithet geckoidea refers to the enormous size of the discs on fingers and toes of this species, which resemble those of gecko lizards (Gekkonidae). For almost 150 years, this species was known as C. geckoideum, but its specific ephited was recently modified to geckoidea [85].\n\nIdentification: Centrolene geckoidea is unique among centrolenids in having a giant body size (adult males, SVL 70.2–80.7 mm; females, SVL 61.8–72.9 mm) and webbing between the two innermost fingers (Figure 35). Males also have a conspicuous humeral spine (Figure 34), which in some individuals, perforates the skin of the arm. Only C. paezorum, endemic of the high Andes of Colombia, could be confused with C. geckoidea; C. paezorum is known only from a single female and is reported to be smaller (SVL 44.5 mm; see Remarks) and with less hand webbing than C. geckoidea [110].\n\nFigure 34.

(D) Humeral spine of adult female; modified from Rueda-Almonacid [111]. (E) Humeral spine of adult male; modified from Rueda-Almonacid [111].\n\nColor in life (Figure 34): Dorsum dull green, with enameled greenish or bluish warts; throat greenish yellow; margin of upper lip yellow; venter cream or yellow cream; ulnar, tarsal, and cloacal tubercles creamy white; white flecks on flanks; iris pale greenish gold with fine black reticulation; palpebrum clear (W. E. Duellman field notes, 9 April 1975; this work); bones green [111]. Males and females are dark grey to brownish green during the night [112].\n\nColor in ethanol: Dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs cream grey to dark grey with tips of spicules being white; cloacal, ulnar, and tarsal tubercles white; ventral surfaces cream. Anterior two-thirds of the ventral parietal peritoneum white, posterior third transparent; pericardium white; no iridophores in peritonea covering liver, kidneys, and digestive tract.\n\nBiology and ecology: Males and females of Centrolene geckoidea have been found clinging to vertical or overhanging rock surfaces in the spray zone behind waterfalls [112,113,114]. Males have remarkable call-site fidelity. Egg clutches are deposited on rocks within the spray zone and contain 89–112 black eggs, which are glued to the rocks by a brittle jelly unknown in other centrolenids [112,113]; an “empty space” is evident in the center of the attached clutch [113]. Although oviposition has not been observed, Grant et al. [112] suggested that the ova may be deposited as the female rotates through a circle with the head at the center, a scenario that would explain the origin of the “empty space” near the center of the egg mass. During the night, males have been observed sitting on or near up to four clutches of eggs while calling. During the day, males also have been observed sitting near or on clutches on the rockface behind a waterfall or hidden in spaces between rocks [112]. Thus, all observations by Grant et al. [112] suggest that males provide prolonged parental care to clutches.\n\nCall: Grant et al. [112] described the call of Centrolene geckoidea from El Queremal (3.483 N, 76.7 W), Valle del Cauca, Colombia. The information shown below is based on their study. Males call from behind waterfalls or within or near spray zones of fast-flowing streams. Males have call-site fidelity and have been observed vocalizing at the same site for up to a month. The call is a loud, high-pitched, trilled whistle that lacks any consistent pattern of amplitude modulation. The call is weakly to moderately pulsed and has a duration of 155–373 ms. Calls were emitted infrequently at intervals or 1.48–5.05 min; however, males typically call less frequently (i.e., as little as less than once per hour). The dominant frequency is at 3468–4187 Hz, and it is modulated, beginning at low frequencies (3593–3781 Hz) and rising to a maximum of 3718–4187 Hz, after which it falls, ending at 3468–3718 Hz.\n\nTadpole: Lynch et al. [113] and Rueda-Almonacid [111] provide descriptions and illustrations of the tadpole of Centrolene geckoidea. Lynch et al. [113] briefly described a tadpole (total length of 22.3 mm) as having a typical centrolenid body form; mouth lacking upper tooth rows, but with two evident lower rows (P1 with a wide medial gap); upper jaw sheath thick with minute serrations; lower jaw sheath thin and poorly keratinized; one row of large subconical marginal papillae borders the oral disc ventrolaterally and posteriorly. Rueda-Almonacid [111] mentioned that tadpoles in Gosner stage 22, one month after hatching, had two incomplete tooth rows on the anterior labium and three tooth rows on the posterior labium. However, three months after hatching, all the tooth rows were lost, and only dermal ridges were evident [111]. The dorsal surfaces of the body and the tail musculature were black, and the venter lacked pigmentation [111].\n\nDistribution (Figure 36): Centrolene geckoidea occurs across the three Andean Cordilleras of Colombia (Cordillera Occidental, Central, and Oriental; in the departments of Antioquia, Valle del Cauca, Caldas, Quindio, Risaralda, Tolima, Boyacá, and Caquetá), south to the Pacific Andean slope of Ecuador (Carchi and Pichincha provinces) at elevations of 1750–2525 m [111,112,113,114,115,116] (Figure 35). In Ecuador, the potential distribution of the species covers an area of 10,579 km2 within the Western Montane Forest region.\n\nJiménez de la Espada [83] mentioned that the species was found at “las riberas del Río Napo en el Ecuador”. During his trip in South America, Jiménez de la Espada visited several eastern Andean localities (e.g., Basin of Río Quijos, San José de Moti, Cordillera de Guacamayos, Cosanga) before reaching the lowlands near the Río Napo. It has been suggested that the type locality is in error [110], but the holotype of C. geckoidea could have been collected in the headwaters of the Napo river, or at one of the eastern Andean localities [17].\n\nFigure 36. Distribution of Centrolene geckoidea in Ecuador (yellow dots).\n\nConservation status: Globally, Centrolene geckoidea is listed by the IUCN as a Critically Endangered species [117]. In Ecuador, the species has a severely fragmented distribution, and evidence of population declines. Intensive fieldwork in historical localities such as Quebrada Zapadores has failed in finding the species [91] (JMG, pers. obs.; DFCH, pers. obs.). The last reports of C. geckoidea in Ecuador are from Río La Plata (00°48′ N, 78°02′ W; 2525 m), on the Maldonado–Tulcán road, on 25 July 1988, and from Bosque Protector Río Guajalito in January to May between 1998 and 1999 [17]. A similar situation exists for populations of C. geckoidea found at Valle del Cauca in the Cordillera Occidental (Colombia), as they have not been seen for more than 10 years (W. Bolivar and J.J Sarria-Ospina, pers. com.).\n\nEvolutionary relationships (Figure 24): The molecular tree reported by Twomey et al. [19] places Centrolene geckoidea as the sister species of C. charapita. However, our inferred tree recovers C. geckoidea as sister to all other Centrolene species. Since C. geckoidea is the type species for the genus Centrolene, its phylogenetic placement has fundamental taxonomic implications.\n\nRemarks: The external morphology, osteology, and myology of Centrolene geckoidea was studied in detail by Rueda-Almonacid [111]. Given the remarkable morphological similarly between C. geckoidea and C. paezorum, we consider the possibility that C. paezorum represents a junior synonym of C. geckoidea. Differences between these species include the absence of vomerine teeth in C. paezorum, smaller size, and reduced webbing [110]. Also, the two species occupy different elevations; C. geckoidea is found at elevations between 1750–2525 m, whereas C. paezorum occurs at 3030 m. Additional specimens from the type locality of C. paezorum (Colombia: Departamento del Cauca: km 55–56 on the Popayán–Inza road, 3030 m) are necessary to clarify its status. Until recently, the holotype of Centrolene geckoidea was thought to be lost [118], but in a recent publication, González-Fernández [119] provided dorsal and ventral photographs of the holotype (MNCN 1596).\n\nSpecimens examined: Centrolene geckoidea: Ecuador: Provincia de Pichincha: 1 km SW of San Ignacio (0.4486 S, 78.7478 W, 1920 m), KU 178015–17; Quebrada Zapadores, 5 km ESE of Chiriboga on Chiriboga–Quito road (0.245278 S, 78.7261 W; 2010 m), KU 164492; 9 km SE of Tandayapa (0.0167 S, 78.683 W; 2150 m), KU 164490–91. Provincia del Carchi: Río La Plata, on the Maldonado-Tulcán road (0.8 N, 78.033 W; 2525 m), DHMECN 0900.\n\nCentrolenella heloderma Duellman, 1981 [120]. Holotype: KU 164715.\n\nType locality: “Quebrada Zapadores, 5 km east-southeast of Chiriboga, 2010 m, Provincia de Pichincha, Ecuador (00°17′ S, 78°47′ W)”.\n\nCentrolene helodermum—Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1991 [6].\n\nCentrolene heloderma—Guayasamin, Castroviejo-Fisher, Trueb, Ayarzagüena, Rada, and Vilà, 2009 [1].\n\nCommon names: English: Warty Glassfrog. Spanish: Rana de Cristal Verrugosa.\n\nEtymology: The specific epithet heloderma combines the Greek words “helos” (wart) and “derma” (skin) and is used in allusion to the dorsal texture of the species.\n\nIdentification: Centrolene heloderma differs from all glassfrogs by having a green pustular dorsum and males with humeral spines (Figure 34). Centrolene heloderma mostly resembles Centrolene buckleyi; both species have humeral spines in males, snout inclined in lateral profile, and a narrow white labial stripe. The most conspicuous difference between these species is that Centrolene buckleyi lacks a pustular dorsal skin. Further, C. buckleyi differs by having a concealed tympanum (completely visible in C. heloderma; Figure 37).\n\nFigure 37. Centrolene heloderma from Reserva Las Gralarias, Ecuador. (A,B) Adult male.
