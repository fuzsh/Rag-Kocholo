        "text": "Ernesto Pujol\n\n(b. Havana, 1957)\n\nErnesto Pujol is a performance artist and social choreographer. Pujol pursued undergraduate work in humanities and visual arts, followed by studies in Western monasticism; and graduate work in education, media theory, and art therapy. During the 1990s, Pujol became known for ephemeral, site-specific, installation projects publicly addressing individual and collective repressed memories. In 1997 he represented the United States at the 2nd Johannesburg Biennial, South Africa; the 2nd Saaremaa Biennial, Estonia; and the 6th Havana Biennial, Cuba. He has been the recipient of fellowships from the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation (1994), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation (1993 and 1998), the Cintas Foundation (1991 and 1997), the Joan Mitchell Foundation (1997), the New York Foundation for the Arts (2008), and Art Matters (2008). He has served with the New York State Council on the Arts, the Academy for Educational Development, and the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, DC. Pujol has taught at the Cooper Union, Pratt Institute, the Rhode Island School of Design, the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, the Hartford Art School, the University of Utah, and Parsons The New School of Design (check this is the name).
