The safety, costs, and downstream effects of these tests on PE-related and non-PE-related outcomes warrant further investigation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSee Editorial by Gayle and Lindman\n\nPulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, and potentially fatal disease,1–3 afflicting diverse groups of patients including both young and old patients, patients with chronic medical conditions, such as active cancer, renal insufficiency, or morbid obesity.4 PE can also occur in pregnant women, leading to devastating outcomes.5\n\nPrompt diagnosis of PE is the key to initiation of appropriate, often life-saving, treatment. Over the past years, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of acute PE.6–8 However, there are provider or patient-related factors and institutional or logistical reasons that might limit the use of CTPA or lead to an alternative choice of imaging modalities to confirm PE.9–11 Patient-related factors include the presence of severe renal insufficiency—where there is concern for contrast-induced nephropathy; and pregnancy, or very young age (<18 years old) in which case there is concern over radiation exposure.12,13 Further, use of CTPA might be limited by factors such as hemodynamic instability (concern for deterioration during imaging or transport) or morbid obesity (weight limit with scanner tables or inability to fit in the scanner). In addition, institutional culture or resource availability may partially drive the choice of imaging modalities.14–16 Besides CTPA, alternative modalities of diagnoses for PE include—but are not limited to—ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning, pulmonary angiography, a combination of these tests, or objective confirmation of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by imaging—typically ultrasonography—in patients with signs and symptoms of PE.\n\nThe diagnostic profile, required resources, costs, safety features, and limitations of these tests have noticeable differences. Nevertheless, limited data exist to explore the patient characteristics or institutional-level factors that may drive the use of particular imaging modalities in patients with PE. Therefore, we used the data from the Registro Informatizado Enfermedad TromboEmbolica (RIETE) registry to characterize the variations in the choice of different imaging modalities in patients enrolled with acute PE.\n\nMethods\n\nData that were used for this study will be available to interested investigators upon mutual communication and consensus with the senior author and the RIETE Coordinating Center.\n\nStudy Design, Data Source\n\nRIETE is an ongoing international registry of patients with objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism, including DVT or PE, and includes collaborating centers located in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. The details about the methodology, definitions, and quality control for the registry have been previously described (URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02832245).17 In brief, RIETE started in Spain in 2001 and, in subsequent years, has expanded the sites in several countries. The protocol for enrolling patients in RIETE for research purposes has been approved by the ethics committees at the participating sites, and all the participating patients provided written or oral informed consent. In each center, PE diagnosis was confirmed with any of the following: CTPA, V/Q scanning, pulmonary angiography, a combination of these 3 tests, or based on the PE symptoms and signs along with presence of imaging-confirmed proximal DVT (by ultrasonography, venography, or magnetic resonance angiography).\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nFor the current study, of all the patients in RIETE, we included those with acute symptomatic PE who were enrolled from March 2001 to January 2019. We excluded patients with asymptomatic PE, and patients with PE symptoms who did not have either confirmatory chest imaging demonstrating PE, or confirmed proximal DVT. RIETE, by design, does not include the patients with suspected PE who do not have a confirmed diagnosis of PE. As such, the current study focused on use of imaging modalities in patients with confirmed PE.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary goal of this study was to determine the potential variations in the use of imaging modalities in patients with confirmed PE, based on patient-related factors, or institution-related factors. As such, the main outcome was the proportion of patients diagnosed with each imaging modality. Patient-related factors explored in this study included the presence of severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min), weight >150 kg, pregnancy, age <18 years, age >85 years, active cancer (defined as cancer diagnosed <3 months earlier, or that was being treated by surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, palliative care, or combined therapies), recent major surgery (within 2 months before the index venous thromboembolism event), chronic lung disease, and hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg).17 We also investigated the choice of imaging modalities based on the revised Geneva score (a score used for risk-stratification of patients with suspected PE), since the clinical features may have driven the choice of imaging tests,18 and the simplified PE severity index (a score to predict adverse outcomes in patients with PE), because we hypothesized that severity of illness may have influenced the providers’ choice of requesting particular imaging tests (Tables I and II in the Data Supplement).19\n\nInstitutional factors assessed in the current study included the country of enrollment (assessed for countries with at least 25 valid patients), and hospital capacity: small-sized (≤100 beds), medium-sized (101–300 beds), and large-sized (>301 beds) hospitals. We also assessed potential variations in the use of imaging modalities according to the time of admission during the week, that is, weekdays versus weekends. For that analysis, the use of imaging modalities was assessed in Europe and Americas to ascertain the consistency of weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays). Further, we explored the trends in use of imaging modalities over the study years.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nCategorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were reported as mean and SEM (or median and interquartile range, if the data were not normally distributed). We made a priori plans to minimize multiple pairwise statistical comparisons. For robustness, we presented the proportions with respective 99% CI. We used linear regression analysis to test for linear trends. A 2-sided P<0.01 was considered as significant.\n\nResults\n\nThere were 78 005 patients enrolled in RIETE during the study period (March 2001–January 2019), of whom 38 025 had symptomatic and confirmed PE, and were included in the current study. Mean age was 67.3±17 years, and 53.1% of the patients were female. Of all the study participants, 4396 (13.0%) had a history of recent major surgery, 6619 (27.4%) had active cancer, 2393 (6.3%) patients had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min), 5447 (14.3%) patients had chronic lung disease, 3939 (10.4%) were older than 85 years, and 54 patients were younger than 18 years old. There were 141 pregnant patients and 66 patients who weighed >150 kg (Table 1).\n\nImaging Modality for PE Diagnosis\n\nAll included patients (38 025 patients, 100%) had data regarding the imaging modality used for diagnosis of PE. Overall, CTPA was the most commonly used imaging modality (29 722 patients, 78.2% [99% CI, 77.6%–78.7%]), followed by V/Q scanning (4908 patients, 12.9% [99% CI, 12.5%–13.4%]). In addition, a total of 1538 (4.0% [99% CI, 3.8%–4.3%) patients had >1 chest imaging modalities and for 1263 (3.3% [99% CI, 3.1%–3.6%]) patients, no chest imaging was obtained, and the diagnosis of PE was made on the basis of PE signs and symptoms along with imaging-confirmed proximal DVT. Angiography was used for 594 (1.6% [99% CI, 1.4%–1.7%]) patients (Figure 1).\n\nSymptomatology According to the Modality of Diagnosis\n\nAmong patients diagnosed with each of the modalities, the most common symptom was dyspnea (Table 2). Chest pain was less frequently observed among PE patients who were diagnosed by ultrasonography alone. Most other PE signs and symptoms were relatively comparable among the diagnostic imaging subgroups.\n\nThe revised Geneva score was available for 35 725 (94.0%) patients, and the median revised Geneva score was 6 points. However, the revised Geneva score was higher in patients who were diagnosed by PE symptoms plus imaging confirmation of DVT without chest imaging (P<0.001 compared with all other imaging subgroups). The simplified PE severity index was available for 22 727 (59.8%) patients, and the median simplified PE severity index in all subgroups according the imaging modality of diagnosis was 1 point (Table 2, Table III in the Data Supplement).\n\nImaging Modality in Clinical Subgroups of Patients With Confirmed PE\n\nIn all clinical subgroups, CTPA was the most commonly used imaging modality to confirm PE. However, there were marked variations in the proportion of patients diagnosed with each imaging modality. The greatest proportions of PE diagnosis with CTPA were in those with recent major surgery (78.9% [99% CI, 77.3%–80.5%]), or chronic lung disease (78.3% [99% CI, 76.8%–79.8%]), and the lowest proportions—yet the dominant modality—were observed in pregnant patients (58.9% [99% CI, 47.7%–69.4%]), patients with severe renal insufficency (62.5% [99% CI, 59.9%–65.0%]), and obese patients weighting >150 kg (68.2% [99% CI, 51.7%–81.9%]). V/Q scan was the second most commonly used modality of PE diagnosis. Its use varied between 11.5% (99% CI, 9.3%–13.9%) in hemodynamically unstable patients and 25.6% (99% CI, 23.3%–27.9%) in those with severe renal insufficiency. The diagnosis of PE was made by PE symptoms along with imaging-confirmed DVT without chest imaging in as few as 2.0% (99% CI, 1.5%–2.7%) of patients with recent major surgery but as many as 17.0% (99% CI, 9.7%–26.6%) of pregnant patients. Figure 1 summarizes the utilization of various diagnostic modalities across the clinical subgroups.\n\nThe Choice of the Imaging Modality Based on Hospital Capacity\n\nCTPA was the dominant modality of diagnosis in patients admitted to small (≤100 beds), medium (101–300 beds), and large size hospitals (≥301 beds), varying between 71.2% in small hospitals and 79.7% in medium-size hospitals. In contrast, a greater proportion of patients in larger hospitals were diagnosed with V/Q scanning compared with those in small hospitals (13.1% versus 7.3%, P<0.001, Figure 2).\n\nThe Choice of Imaging Modality Based on the Country of Enrollment\n\nAcross the enrolling countries, the use of CTPA, alone, varied between 13.3% to 98.3%. Variations in use of other imaging modalities were noted as well (Table IV in the Data Supplement).\n\nTime Trends\n\nBetween January 2002 and December 2018, the proportion of patients diagnosed with CTPA increased significantly (from 46.5% [99% CI, 42.7%–50.3%] in 2002 to 91.7% [99% CI, 89.6%–93.6%], P<0.001 for linear trend for years 2002–2018). In contrast, the proportion of patients diagnosed with V/Q scanning, those diagnosed with >1 positive chest imaging modality, and those diagnosed based on PE symptoms and confirmed lower extremity DVT, declined over time (P for linear trend <0.001 for decline for all other groups, Figure 3).\n\nCTPA was the dominant modality of diagnosis during weekdays and weekends (78.1% and 82.4%, respectively). However, use of V/Q scanning was less frequent in patients diagnosed over weekends (10.2% versus 13.8%, P<0.001, Table V in the Data Supplement).\n\nHospitalization Status, and Subsequent Testing Based on the Modality of PE Diagnosis\n\nHospitalization status was available for all 38 025 (100%) patients. Among patients who were hospitalized after acute PE, the median length of hospitalization was 8 (interquartile range: 6–12) days. Among patients with valid information, transthoracic echocardiography within 72 hours of diagnosis was used in 16 619 (51%) patients with PE (Table 3). Early use of transthoracic echocardiography was more frequent in patients diagnosed with CTPA compared with patients who were diagnosed by V/Q scanning, or those diagnosed based on PE signs and symptoms plus confirmed DVT but no chest imaging (P<0.001 for both comparison, Table 3).\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nIn a post hoc analysis, we assessed the robustness of the main results in centers where both CTPA and V/Q scanning were available. Of all 38 025 patients in our study, 26 245 (69.0%) were enrolled from a total of 270 centers where both CTPA and V/Q scanning were available. In brief, the main study findings were robust, showing increasing use of CTPA over time. CTPA was the dominant modality of diagnosis across clinical subgroups (Figure I and Table VI in the Data Supplement).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this large multicenter, multinational registry of patients with PE, we observed variations in the choice of the imaging modalities in patients with acute PE, according to patient-related factors, hospital size, regional factors, and also a change over time. Imaging-confirmed proximal DVT, along with PE signs or symptoms (but without chest imaging), was rarely used for diagnosis of PE in the overall cohort (3.3%), but it was the modality of diagnosis in as many as 17.0% of pregnant patients with PE. Similarly, only 12.9% of overall cohort but as many as 25.6% of patients with severe renal insufficiency were diagnosed with V/Q scanning. Further, V/Q scanning was more frequent in larger hospitals, which may reflect the presence of patients with more comorbidities (including renal disease) in larger tertiary hospitals. Presence of statistical differences, despite a priori decision to choose statistically conservative representation with 99% CI, suggests that the point estimates reflect truly different utilization rates, rather than chance alone. Nevertheless, CTPA was the most commonly used imaging modality even in pregnancy or severe renal insufficiency, with increasing use over time. This finding is concerning because it reflects on a dominant diagnostic practice pattern even in subgroups where alternative tests may provide sufficient diagnostic information.\n\nSome of the observed variations across the subgroups occurred according to what was expected based on the clinical characteristics, but in others surprising trends were observed. For example, practitioners may try to minimize the use of ionizing radiation in pregnant patients, hence a greater proportion of PE diagnoses based on symptoms along with confirmed DVT. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that even in pregnant subgroup, CTPA was the most common imaging modality. Among younger patients (age <18), who are similarly perceived to be radiosensitive, only 7.4% were diagnosed based on symptoms plus confirmed DVT, and the most frequent use of more than 1 chest imaging modality (ie, more than one of CTPA, V/Q scan, and angiography) was observed among the younger patients (11.1%), compared with the overall cohort (4.0%), or even other clinical subgroups. Similarly, contrast-induced nephropathy could lead into end-stage renal disease in patients with severe renal insufficiency, hence the use of imaging modalities other than CTPA, such as V/Q scanning. Nevertheless, despite greater proportional use of V/Q scanning in patients with severe renal insufficiency, CTPA was still the most common imaging modality used in those patients. These results require further exploration to understand the reasons behind the decisions for the choice of the tests and the variations.\n\nAmong 1263 patients who were diagnosed without chest imaging but with an imaging-confirmed proximal DVT and symptoms for PE, the revised Geneva score was 10 (interquartile range: 6–13), implying high suspicion for lower extremity DVT, and coexisting PE. In contrast, the use of imaging modalities among postoperative patients, those with systolic hypotension, and the elderly were not markedly different from the majority of other patients with PE. Further, contrary to our initial concern about patients weighing >150 kg, we noted that the majority (68.2%) were diagnosed with CTPA. Inability to fit morbidly obese patients in conventional CT scanners or exceeding the CT scan weight limit are known limitations.20 Frequent confirmation of PE with CTPA in patients weighing >150 kg in our study might be explained by high weight but balanced body mass index, or use of scanners supporting heavier weights (up to 200 kg), or greater gantry aperture diameter (50–85 cm).\n\nMany factors might affect the choice of imaging modality, including the clinical judgment and providers’ preference, the inherent accuracy of the modality for the diagnosis of PE, the pretest probability of PE, the safety profile of the diagnostic test (including risks of diagnostic procedures, such as angiography, radiation, and use of contrast agent), ability to assess other possible diagnoses, resource availability, as well as local or regional expertise to use the modality (Table 4). Some broad recommendations have been provided in expert guidelines with respect to the use of imaging modalities to confirm PE.21,22 However, until recently, the recommendations have not been detailed or specific and do not provide clear guidance about specific patient subgroups, as assessed in the current study.23,24 We must clarify that the variations, or lack thereof, observed in this study are not necessarily representative of appropriate or inappropriate care in individual-specific patients, nor do the data estimate the utilization of imaging in patients with suspected PE. However, in aggregate, they represent practice patterns that warrant further investigation for safety, efficacy, treatment delays, downstream testing, and costs.\n\nAmong the downstream tests, we explored the utilization of transthoracic echocardiography within 72 hours of PE diagnosis across the spectrum of patients diagnosed with each imaging modality. Echocardiography could provide clinically relevant information, such as chamber enlargement, right ventricular dysfunction, and also right heart thrombi. Such information may influence the treatment decisions for patients with PE.25 The downstream variation in the use of echocardiography based on the imaging modality used for PE diagnosis (especially those modalities that do not provide further details on right and left ventricular structure and function) may have clinical consequences and should be assessed in further details in separate investigations matched for patient clinical severity of illness.\n\nSome prior studies had assessed the utility of clinical prediction rules for the use of imaging tests and confirmation of PE.26,27 More recently, algorithms have been developed to minimize the use of ionizing radiation for PE diagnosis.28 Further, imaging modalities without the risk of radiation, including magnetic resonance imaging, are gaining attention for assessment of PE, especially in radiosensitive subgroups, such as pregnant women.29 During the study period, however, RIETE did not collect information about the use of magnetic resonance imaging as an imaging modality or the use of clinical prediction rules, such as the YEARS criteria. With respect to high utilization rates of CTPA as the confirmatory test, our findings are consistent with recent results from the Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field—Venous Thromboembolism registry.30 Unlike our study, however, in Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field—Venous Thromboembolism, almost all PE diagnoses were made either by CTPA or V/Q scanning. Despite the declining use over time, variations were observed in the use of V/Q scanning for patients with PE across the countries. For example, V/Q scanning was the modality of diagnosis for over a third of patients enrolled from Canada, consistent with other recent studies.31\n\nThe main strength of this study is the large size of the RIETE registry, which enabled us to explore the variations across multiple settings, including across geographic regions and types of hospitals as well as across patient-level factors and clinical subgroups. We also noticed the surprising result that CTPA was the dominant modality of PE diagnosis among patients with severe renal insufficiency. Further, we identified 141 pregnant patients with PE, larger than 2 large recent dedicated studies.16,28 We recognized that CTPA was the most common imaging modality in these pregnant patients with confirmed PE. We demonstrated downstream distinctions in subsequent testing, including early use of echocardiography, based on the initial modality of PE diagnosis. RIETE is the largest existing and ongoing prospective registry of patients with PE. As such, the data related to temporal, institutional, and particularly patient-level variations and diagnostic choices per clinical subgroups provide real-world evidence about contemporary practice and could be helpful for practice management, policy making, and designing future research studies.\n\nThe limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, this study was only able to assess patients with objectively confirmed PE. However, data were not available on the choice of imaging modality for patients with suspected (rather than confirmed) PE. Prior reports on patients with suspected PE have shown that CTPA was the most commonly used imaging modality, including in pregnant patients.11,16,28,32–34 However, variations in use of imaging technology were not the focus of either of those prior studies. Second, we did not evaluate the provider-related factors leading to variation in use of imaging modalities. Third, details about the reason to use more than 1 chest imaging or the temporality of these tests were not available to explore. We can hypothesize that in some patients, dual-modality scanners, such as V/Q-CT scanners have been used,35 while in others, poor quality of the first imaging modality, discordance between the test results and clinical index of suspicion, or artifact (such as motion artifact, beam hardening artifact) might have led to subsequent confirmatory testing. Fourth, some countries had fewer participating centers or enrolled only a few patients. As such, although findings from this multicenter, multinational study demonstrate regional variations in diagnostic practices, accurate comparisons for point estimates are not feasible for some countries. This is the first of a series of studies to explore the use of imaging modalities in patients with PE and their potential consequences. The focus of the current study was on the assessment and description of potential variations in the choice of imaging modalities for acute PE. Future studies are required to explore the reasons behind the variations, the accuracy of each approach, and to assess the impact of these variations on PE-related and non-PE-related outcomes in adjusted analyses.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, in a large multicenter, multinational registry of patients with confirmed PE, we observed noticeable variations in the modality of diagnosis according to the underlying patient factors and institutional factors. Nevertheless, CTPA was the dominant modality of diagnosis, including in radiosensitive and contrast-sensitive subgroups. The comparative effects of these modalities on downstream costs, testing, radiation, and contrast related safety issues, and PE-related and non-PE related outcomes warrant further investigation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe express our gratitude to Sanofi Spain for supporting this Registry with an unrestricted educational grant.
