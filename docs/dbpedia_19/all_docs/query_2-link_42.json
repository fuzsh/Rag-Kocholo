This session was particularly remarkable for its dynamic activity, during which each entrepreneur had the opportunity to pitch, emphasizing the importance of presenting ourselves as our startup's most valuable asset. 🔔 Key Highlights: 🔖 The Power of Self-Pitching: Leticia emphasized that we entrepreneurs are the most important asset of our startups. Learning to pitch ourselves effectively, highlighting our unique skill sets and motivations, is crucial for turning our initiatives into reality. 🔖 The Secret Sauce: Showcasing our \"why\" and motivation is the secret sauce of a successful pitch. Leticia stressed the importance of conveying our passion and vision to captivate our audience. 🔖 Pitch Deck vs. Investor Deck: We delved into the differences between pitch and investor decks. Leticia clarified that pitching is a comprehensive tool that helps us communicate our ideas, initiatives, startups, and businesses to diverse stakeholders, including partners, colleagues, and clients. Leticia is passionate about promoting innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems that address societal needs. With over 15 years of international experience across the Americas and Europe, she serves on the Board of Advisors for the Asociación Internacional de Startups and is a keynote speaker at global events. She has mentored various European Innovative Programs, and we are thrilled to have her expertise in our training. We are also excited to announce that Leticia will be our host during The #RuralExperience, our DemoDay, where we will celebrate innovation in rural areas. 💫 A heartfelt thank you to Leticia for her invaluable insights and guidance during this session. Our entrepreneurs are now better equipped to pitch their businesses effectively and confidently.
