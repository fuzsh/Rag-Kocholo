The Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV) launched the CUDERMA Project to define quality indicators for the certification of specialized units in dermatology; the first 2 areas selected were psoriasis and dermato-oncology. The aim of this study was to achieve consensus on what should be evaluated by these indicators using a structured process comprising a literature review and selection of an initial list of indicators to be evaluated in a Delphi consensus study following review by a multidisciplinary group of experts. The selected indicators were evaluated by a panel of 28 dermatologists and classified as either “essential” or “of excellence”. The panel agreed on 84 indicators, which will be standardized and used to develop the certification standard for dermato-oncology units.\n\nKeywords:\n\nQuality of care\n\nDelphi technique\n\nQuality indicator\n\nDermato-oncology\n\nDermatology unit\n\nResumen\n\nLos indicadores de calidad son una herramienta clave como garantía de calidad y homogenización de la asistencia sanitaria. En este contexto, la Academia Española de Dermatología y Venereología ha diseñado el proyecto Certificación de unidades de dermatología (CUDERMA), una iniciativa que busca definir indicadores de calidad para certificar unidades de dermatología en distintos ámbitos, entre los que se seleccionaron psoriasis y dermato-oncología de forma inicial. Este estudio tuvo por objetivo consensuar los aspectos a evaluar por los indicadores, siguiendo un proceso estructurado para la revisión bibliográfica y elaboración de un set preliminar de indicadores, revisado por un grupo multidisciplinar de expertos, para su evaluación mediante un Consenso Delphi. Un panel de 28 dermatólogos evaluó los indicadores y los clasificó como «básicos» o «de excelencia», generando un conjunto de 84 indicadores consensuados que serán estandarizados para diseñar la norma para certificar las unidades de dermato-oncología.\n\nPalabras clave:\n\nCalidad asistencial\n\nConsenso Delphi\n\nIndicador de calidad\n\nDermato-oncología\n\nUnidad de dermatología\n\nTexto completo\n\nIntroduction\n\nSkin cancer incidence has risen significantly in recent decades.1,2 The latest estimates place global figures at 3.6 cases per 100000 inhabitants a year for cutaneous melanoma and 79.1 cases per 100000 inhabitants a year for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).3 The annual incidence in Spain ranges between 3.6 and 14 cases per 100000 inhabitants for melanoma1,4 and 79.7 and 88.7 cases per 100000 inhabitants for NMSC.1\n\nApart from its high incidence, skin cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality,2,3 particularly certain uncommon NMSCs, such as Merkel cell cancer, dermatofibrosarcoma, and cutaneous lymphoma. Related deaths and morbidity can result in significant years of potential life loss5,6 and notable economic losses linked not just to direct mortality costs but also to indirect morbidity costs associated with significant absenteeism.5 Skin cancer is the second leading cause of years lost to disability in the field of dermatology,7 with both melanoma and NMSC ranking among the top 25 causes of cancer-related disability-adjusted life years.3\n\nSpecialized dermato-oncology units have a key role in skin cancer management.8 Current practice in these units, however, varies across Spain,9 highlighting the need for measurable targets that define essential aspects of health care practice and delivery and can be used to improve the overall quality and performance of these units.\n\nQuality indicators are used to define the extent to which a unit's facilities, resources, and performance meet a minimum set of quality standards. They are a particularly useful tool for evaluating the activity of specific departments and units and identifying areas for improvement; they can also be used to certify functional units.10,11\n\nThe CUDERMA (Certification of Dermatology Care Units) project is an initiative of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV) designed to develop indicators for certifying functional dermatology units and ultimately improving quality in care. The project is divided into 3 phases: 1) identification of aspects that need to be evaluated via quality indicators; 2) harmonization and standardization of previously agreed-on aspects and establishment of names, definitions, standards, objective levels of compliance, and evidence of compliance; and 3) certification of units using the newly created standard. The aim of this study was to achieve consensus on aspects that should be covered by quality indicators for the certification of dermato-oncology units.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nWe designed a structured process using the Delphi consensus method to identify and screen potential quality indicators and subsequently achieve consensus on core aspects to assess during the certification of dermato-oncology units (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFlow chart showing CUDERMA Delphi consensus process and number of indicators considered in each phase.\n\n(0,16MB).\n\nThe Delphi method seeks to achieve consensus among a group of participants on a Delphi panel via individual questionnaires. In successive rounds of the process, panelists are asked to rate potential items on a Likert-type scale and to add any pertinent comments. First-round responses are then used to design individualized questionnaires for the next round. These questionnaires are then analyzed to determine the level of consensus for each item evaluated.12–14\n\nThis study was divided into 3 stages: 1) identification of potential indicators, 2) review by a multidisciplinary group of experts, and 3) Delphi consensus process.\n\nWorking Group\n\nThe CUDERMA project was led by a working group formed by 4 members of the overall coordinating group and a scientific committee comprising 7 dermatologists with experience in dermato-oncology (supplementary material, Table A.1). All 11 participants were members of the AEDV Spanish Dermato-Oncology and Surgery Group and received support from 3 methodology experts.\n\nPhase 1: Identification of Potential Quality Indicators\n\nPotential quality indicators were identified by conducting a structured literature search following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (supplementary material, Table A.2).\n\nThe search targeted publications containing information on relevant aspects to evaluate during the certification of dermato-oncology units. This information was used to identify potential indicators. The working group was responsible for screening these indicators and proposing others.\n\nThe indicators were classified into 3 categories: structural indicators (to measure essential characteristics of dermato-oncology units), process indicators (to measure unit activities), and outcome indicators (to measure the results of these activities).10 The resulting list constituted the preliminary set of potential quality indicators.\n\nPhase 2: Multidisciplinary Group Review\n\nThe potential indicators identified in the literature search were analyzed by a multidisciplinary group composed of 11 experts (supplementary material, Table A.1) specialized in nuclear medicine (n=2), medical oncology (n=2), radiation oncology (n=2), pathology (n=3), and diagnostic imaging (n=2).\n\nThe experts completed a questionnaire in which they rated the relevance of each indicator, and, where appropriate, added comments, suggested modifications, and proposed new indicators.\n\nThe working group analyzed the responses and drew up a preliminary list of indicators to use during the certification of dermato-oncology units.\n\nPhase 3: Delphi Consensus Process\n\nThe preliminary list of indicators was analyzed by a Delphi panel formed by dermatologists specializing in dermato-oncology (supplementary material, TableA.1). The panelists participated in 2 Delphi consensus rounds before consensus was reached on which aspects should be evaluated during the dermato-oncology unit certification process.\n\nIn the first round, the panelists completed a questionnaire including the name and definition of each indicator. They were asked to score each indicator on a scale of 1–9, where 1 indicated not relevant and 9 extremely relevant. They also had to classify the indicators as either “essential” (crucial to the functioning of a dermato-oncology unit) or “of excellence” (aspects that added value to the functioning of the unit, achievement of health outcomes, and continuous improvement). In this round, each panelist could add comments or suggest changes for each indicator and propose new indicators.\n\nThe aim of the first round was to check whether the indicators conveyed the intended meaning and to identify possible new indicators for inclusion in the second round. For this second round, the working group designed individualized questionnaires for each panelist based on the first-round responses. The second set of questionnaires included the scores and classifications given to each indicator in the first round, the mean scores for the group as a whole, and the percentage of panelists who classified a given indicator as “essential”. No new proposals for indicators were accepted in this round.\n\nThe RAND/UCLA Delphi panel method, which applies statistical methods to provide a summary of consensus, was used to calculate the level of consensus on second-round ratings.15 Median scores for each item were categorized into 1 of 3 regions: 1–3, 4–6, or 7–9. Mean (SD) scores were also calculated to characterize questionnaire responses.\n\nThe first step was to calculate the level of agreement obtained for each indicator. Panelists were considered to agree on items scored within the median region by at least two-thirds of the panelists. In turn, they were considered to disagree when at least one-third of panelists scored the item within the 1–3 region and another third or more scored it within the 7–9 region. All other indications were rated as “indeterminate” (neither agreement nor disagreement).\n\nFor indicators with an agreed-on or indeterminate indication, it was determined whether the panelists were for or against their inclusion. Inclusion was considered “appropriate” when the median score was located in the region of 7–9 and “inappropriate” when it was located in the region of 1–3. Indications for items with a score in the range of 4–6 were considered “uncertain”.\n\nThe above methodology was adapted to identify “essential” indicators and indicators “of excellence”. Consensus was considered to have been achieved when more than two-thirds of the panelists assigned the same classification to a given indicator. In all other cases, the indications were classified as indeterminate. In a final meeting, the working group reviewed all indicators classified as uncertain, indeterminate, or with disagreement and decided whether to include or exclude them and whether they should be rated as essential or indicative of excellence.\n\nResultsIdentification of Potential Quality Indicators\n\nThe literature search yielded 121 publications (supplementary material, Fig. A.1), of which 94 were ruled out during initial screening. Detailed reading of the 27 remaining articles identified a potential list of 118 indicators.16–42\n\nThe working group examined these indicators and narrowed the list down to 90: 36 structural indicators, 52 process indicators, and 2 outcome indicators.\n\nPhase 2: Multidisciplinary group review\n\nThe multidisciplinary group examined the potential indicators and where appropriate reformulated definitions and classifications. They also removed 11 indicators, leaving a total of 79 indicators (24 structural indicators, 51 process indicators, and 4 outcome indicators).\n\nPhase 3: Delphi Consensus Process\n\nThe preliminary set of 79 indicators (Table 1) approved by the multidisciplinary group was analyzed by the Delphi panel (31 dermatologists) in the first round of the consensus process.\n\nTable 1.\n\nQuality Indicators Evaluated by Delphi Panel.\n\nIndicator Definition Source (no. of references) Structural indicatorsUnit staff 1.

Sixty-eight were classified as being essential and 16 as indicative of excellence.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe CUDERMA project was designed to establish the minimum standards a functional dermatology unit must meet in order to guarantee quality and consistency in health care. This study describes the first phase of the project, designed to achieve consensus on core indicators for measuring a unit's ability to deliver proper treatment and follow-up care to dermato-oncology patients.\n\nSome of the characteristics classified as essential by the Delphi panelists were a) presence of a multidisciplinary committee to manage patients, b) access to hospitalization and emergency services within the dermatology department or hospital, c) access to procedures and treatments considered essential for the treatment of skin cancer, d) production of full pathology reports on different types of tumors, e) processes that guarantee surgical safety, and f) adherence to predefined procedure times.\n\nCharacteristics indicative of excellence included a) recording of patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and treatment satisfaction, b) staff training in communication skills, and c) research.\n\nAlthough the CUDERMA project has produced the first set of indicators for the certification of dermato-oncology units, other indicators have been developed in this field. The first Spanish initiative in this area was the 2012 Andalusian Society for Health Care Quality (SADECA) project in which a multidisciplinary committee of 14 experts used the nominal group technique to evaluate appropriate indicators from the literature to assess quality of care in melanoma.38 The CUDERMA project takes a broader approach as it seeks to cover all types of skin cancer. It also used a different consensus methodology: the Delphi technique. Another difference is that the SADECA initiative was exclusively designed to assess health care quality. The resulting set of indicators has been used by several projects to assess quality of care in cutaneous melanoma.39,43\n\nAnother Spanish study, conducted in 2015, evaluated adherence to structural indicators in dermato-oncology units using an online questionnaire in which the heads of dermatology departments answered questions on a range of aspects, such as availability of different techniques and treatments, access to tests and facilities, recording and reporting practices, and patient pathways.34\n\nAll the indicators described in the above studies were contemplated during the first phase of the CUDERMA project and included in the set of selected indicators. The main strength of the CUDERMA project compared with previous initiatives is its use of the Delphi consensus method, which provided a rigorous means for identifying potential indicators and allowed the participation of a large number of experts.\n\nAnother differentiating strength of the CUDERMA project is its classification of items as “essential” or “of excellence”. This distinction makes it possible to ensure consistency across units by establishing minimum certification standards, while also encouraging units with greater experience and resources to aspire to excellence.\n\nInvolvement of a multidisciplinary group also confers robustness to the first phase of the CUDERMA project. Input from other specialists involved in the management of skin cancer gave a broader perspective to the indicators selected. Although this multidisciplinary approach is a strength of this study, it should be noted that specialists from other fields participated in the preliminary evaluation phase, not on the Delphi panel. In view of this potential limitation, efforts were made to preserve their original contributions.\n\nFinally, the CUDERMA project was designed to obtain consensus on measurable indicators and to define these indicators (name, definition, standard, objective level of compliance, and evidence of compliance) in 2 separate stages. The selected indicators will therefore be standardized for subsequent certification of units, demonstrating their relevance for guaranteeing quality of care in dermato-oncology.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis first phase of the CUDERMA project generated consensus on aspects that should be covered by quality indicators used in the certification of dermato-oncology units. Examples of aspects that the dermatologists agreed were essential to the functioning of these units were involvement of a multidisciplinary committee in case management, access to a wide range of services, procedures, and treatments, production of full histology reports, implementation of processes to guarantee surgical safety, and adherence to predefined procedures times. Examples of excellence in practice were reporting of patient-reported outcomes and promotion of scientific research.\n\nFunding\n\nThe CUDERMA project is an initiative of the AEDV and is funded by an unrestricted grant from .\n\nResearch conducted at the Melanoma Unit of Hospital Clínic de Barcelona is partially funded by grants PI15/00716, PI15/00956, PI18/00959, PI22/01457, and PI18/00419 from the , the , cofunded by , A way to make Europe; AGAUR 2017 SGR 1134 and the ; the under the (965221), and (875171); and the (CA83115).
