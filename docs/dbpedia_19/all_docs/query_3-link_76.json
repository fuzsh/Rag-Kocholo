He leads the N.L. in home runs (by eight) and RBIs (by eight) and trailed Florida’s Hanley Ramirez in average by 11 points.\n\nNo player has pulled off a Triple-Crown season since Boston’s Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. The N.L.’s Triple Crown drought is 72 years old. St. Louis’ Joe Medwick last accomplished the feat in 1937.\n\nSo why has it taken so long for baseball to witness the 17th Triple Crown season in history? There were six Triple Crown winners between 1937 and 1947, but zero since 1967.\n\n“With all the players in the league nowadays, to win the batting title, to win the home run title and runs driven in, it’s a very difficult thing to do,” Manuel said. “Believe me, that’s a very special year… anytime you won a home run crown or an RBI crown, that’s special in its own way. But to win the Triple Crown…”\n\nManuel’s voice trailed off as he thought about the possibility. He believes Pujols has a chance, but the St. Louis slugger may run into trouble late in the year if opponents begin walking him more.\n\nManuel makes a good point. One of the many changes baseball has seen in the last quarter century is the willingness to pitch around an opponent’s top player.\n\no\n\nWhen you’re getting people to talk about a Triple Crown, you’re an easy midseason National League MVP choice. Full disclosure: My preseason pick was Dodgers outfielder Manny Ramirez, whose stats have obviously taken a hit thanks to a 50-game drug suspension).\n\nWith Pujols penciled in as my midseason N.L. MVP, here’s how I’ll fill out the rest of my awards ballot at baseball’s midsummer break.\n\nAL MVP: Since Boston’s Jason Bay (the Red Sox’s Manny replacement) batted only .230 in June, the pick here is Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer.\n\nLike Pujols, Mauer is flirting with history. He entered Saturday hitting .388. His run at .400 is more impressive because he plays the most demanding defensive position on the field as a catcher.\n\nIn addition to hitting for average, Mauer has kept the Twins in the A.L. Central race with a power surge. With 15 home runs, he has already eclipsed his previous career high (13 in 2006).\n\nDelco Times preseason pick: Mark Teixeira, who entered Saturday hitting .280 with 21 home runs and 63 RBIs.\n\nN.L. Cy Young: If their numbers continue at this rate, N.L. West right-handers Danny Haren of the Diamondbacks and Tim Lincecum of the Giants are going to make it difficult for voters to hand out just one award.\n\nThe nod here, however, goes to Haren. Despite pitching for a poorer team (the Giants are the wild-card leader and the D-backs are 13 games under .500), Haren surely isn’t to blame for Arizona’s struggles.\n\nAfter throwing a four-hit, complete game shutout at the Marlins Friday night, while striking out 10 and walking one, Haren entered the break 9-5 with a 2.01 ERA and a 0.81 WHIP (walks and hits per innings pitched).\n\nAlthough Lincecum flirted with a no-hitter and had a 29-inning scoreless streak snapped this week, his overall numbers, besides strikeouts, don’t match Haren. Lincecum enters the break 10-2 with a 2.33 ERA and a 1.05 WHIP.\n\nHitters are batting .189 against Haren and .215 against Lincecum.\n\nPreseason pick: Cole Hamels.\n\nA.L. Cy Young: In another two-horse race, Kansas City’s Zach Greinke gets the edge over Toronto’s Roy Halladay.\n\nThis is an easy one. If you pitch for the Kansas City Royals and you’re on pace for 20 wins, you’re the leader in the clubhouse.\n\nGreinke’s ERA didn’t climb above 1.00 until his 11th start of the season May 31. He’s 10-5 with a league-best 2.12 ERA and a league-best five complete games.\n\nPreseason pick: Halladay.\n\nN.L. Rookie of the Year: Colby Rasmus has been tabbed the top prospect in the Cardinals system for the better half of the last decade. He’s putting that hype into play this summer.\n\nRasmus is hitting .281 and leads N.L. rookies in home runs (11) and RBIs (34).\n\nPreseason pick: Florida’s Cameron Maybin, who was hitting .202 when he was demoted in May.\n\nA.L. Rookie of the Year: Andrew Bailey, Oakland. The big right-hander went under the radar for most of the first half of the season, when the attention was on the rebuilt, young Oakland rotation.\n\nBut Bailey, who hadn’t pitched above Double-A when he made the A’s team out of spring training, emerged as the team’s closer and hasn’t looked back. Bailey, a South Jersey native, leads A.L. rookies in saves (nine), ERA (2.03) and opponents’ batting average (.173).\n\nBailey also leads A.L. relievers, and ranks second among major league relievers, with 57 strikeouts.\n\nPreseason pick: Tampa Bay’s David Price.\n\no\n\nTrivial pursuit: Keeping with the Triple Crown theme, there are 13 Triple Crown “losers” in big league history.\n\nWhat’s a Triple Crown loser? It’s a batter who qualifies for the batting title and finishes last in his league in all three Triple Crown categories. Name the last Triple Crown loser in each league.\n\no\n\nFuture Phils file: There is a growing debate that if the Phils make an attempt to trade for Toronto ace Roy Halladay, they should not part with left-hander J.A. Happ.\n\nWhile it’s easy to understand that logic — Happ is pitching as well as anyone in the rotation at the moment — you have to give up something to get something and filling Happ’s spot in the rotation may not be as difficult as one would think.\n\nIf the Phils lost Happ in a deal for Halladay, one could argue they’d be a better rotation with Halladay, Cole Hamels, Joe Blanton, Jamie Moyer and Andrew Carpenter than they are with their current starting staff. Remember Andrew Carpenter?\n\nThe 24-year-old right-hander, who won 19 games at Single-A Clearwater two years ago, is pitching with a purpose at Triple-A Lehigh Valley. Carpenter is 7-2 with a 1.89 ERA in 10 starts since being sent back down to the IronPigs following a spot start for the Phillies in Washington May 16.\n\nDuring that span, Carpenter’s strikeout-to-walks ratio is better than 3-to-1. He’s collected 53 strikeouts while walking 15 in 662/3 innings.\n\nThe belief here is if the Phils needed to part with Happ to get Halladay, some combination of the youngsters they might not have to trade — Carpenter, Carlos Carrasco, Antonio Bastardo, etc. — could hold down the fifth spot. That gamble is worth having Hamels and Halladay at the top of the rotation.\n\no\n\nMinor-league Hit King: When it was over, Seattle Mariners outfield prospect James McOwen came 24 games away from tying a 90-year-old record.\n\nFriday night, McOwen went 0-for-3 with a walk in Class-A High Desert’s 2-0 loss at Modesto, snapping a 45-game hitting streak, the eighth-longest run in minor league history.\n\nMcOwen’s streak was the longest in the minor leagues since Waco’s Roman Mejias hit in 55 straight games in 1954. Wichita’s Joe Wilhoit set the minor league mark with a 69-game streak in 1919.\n\no\n\nTrivial answer: The drought for a Triple Crown loser isn’t nearly as long as it is for a Triple Crown winner.\n\nIn 2003, Ramon Santiago of Detroit pulled off the infamous feat, finishing last in the American League in home runs (two), RBIs (29) and batting average (.225). Santiago did, however, lead the A.L. with 18 sacrifice hits that season.\n\nThe last N.L. Triple Crown loser? Ivan DeJesus of the Chicago Cubs, who hit .194 with zero home runs and 13 RBIs in 1981.\n\nLess than four months after his forgettable 1981 season ended, DeJesus came to the Phillies in one of the most lopsided trades in club history. He was traded to Philadelphia for five-time All-Star Larry Bowa and future Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg.\n\nE-mail Ryan Lawrence at ryanlawrence21@gmail.com\n\nOriginally Published: July 12, 2009 at 4:45 a.m."
