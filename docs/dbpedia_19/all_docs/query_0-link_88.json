        "text": "Hi! I'm Lorena, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Spain.\n\nI'm doing a volunteering in a farm near lake Balaton. Before coming I was looking for a project where I could experience self-sustainable life, in a community and away from the city to get to know what it's like to live in total contact with nature.\n\nThe farm turned out to be just what I was looking for and the people in the community are super great.\n\nAlso, being in a different country, with a different culture and an unknown language is really challenging and it pushes you to develop your self a lot. I would never change the decision of coming to Hideghegy :)\n\nHello! My name's Salvo, I'm 22 years old and I'm a volunteer in a farm in the north of the Balaton Lake. I choose to come here because I always want to push myself out of my comfort zone and this experience was the perfect one.\n\nIndeed in this project I have been learning so much about myself and others, I'm feeling more connected and in harmony with myself. I love being in contact with the nature, meditating, reading, listening music and so on. I'm just happy and grateful to be in this place with these people around me.\n\nHi! I'm Cili, 23 years old. I am currently studying food engineering at the Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences. I enjoy dancing, playing tennis, listening to music, cooking, spending time with my loved ones, paying attention to others, myself or nature. After 8 months of working for a multinational company, it is good to try a sustainable life that works well with our environment. During the program I would like to gain as much knowledge as possible about permaculture farming, community building, and myself.\n\nHi! My name is Mikl√≥s, I'm 27 years old. I studied physical education and I was a part of the Hungarian wrestling team. Since I retired from competition I have worked in various fields, and gained some experience in building and farming as well. I learned about regenerative farming which I found very inspiring and I am determined to explore that path.\n\nA very important part of this holistic approach is community and working with others which I would like to experience in depth trough out this program. I also would like to learn about natural building and managing landscape in practice."
