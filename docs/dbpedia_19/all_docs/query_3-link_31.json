        "text": "Here is the latest Mid-America sports news from The Associated Press\n\nJUPITER, Fla. (AP) — Albert Pujols has returned to the St. Louis Cardinals, finding a home in the place where he became one of baseball's most powerful sluggers. The 42-year-old Pujols says this is his final season. Pujols emerged from beyond the right field wall at the Cardinals' spring training complex between the first and second innings of an exhibition game against Houston on Monday. Pujols drew a standing ovation from the crowd and was greeted with hugs in the St. Louis dugout. Pujols was a three-time MVP and helped the Cardinals win two World Series titles. He split last season with the Los Angeles Angels and Dodgers. Pujols reached a one-year deal with the Cardinals over the weekend and gives them an option at designated hitter.\n\nWICHITA, Kan. (AP) — Hailey Van Lith scored 22 points, Olivia Cochran made a series of crucial baskets in the final minutes, and Louisville held off Michigan 62-50 to return to the Final Four for the fourth time in program history. Chelsie Hall added 15 points and Emily Engstler balanced out a poor shooting night with 16 rebounds and some big plays on defense, helping the top-seeded Cardinals advance to face South Carolina next weekend in Minneapolis. Naz Hillmon finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Wolverines, who couldn't overcome 22 turnovers despite a huge disparity at the foul line in their first regional final.\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) — Vladimir Tarasenko had two goals and an assist, leading the St. Louis Blues to a 4-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. Tarasenko has 23 goals this season, and the three-point game gave him 500 points in his NHL career. David Perron and Marco Scandella also scored for the Blues, who had lost of three of four. Ville Husso rebounded after allowing five goals Saturday and recorded 35 saves. He is 8-3-3 in his last 14 starts. Robert Thomas had two assists. Brad Hunt scored for Vancouver.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs were supposed to be quiet during free agency, with so many of their big names tied to contracts and very little salary cap space. Well, some creative accounting coupled with a blockbuster trade of Tyreek Hill has turned a quiet offseason for the AFC West champs into a major retooling of their roster. JuJu Smith-Schuster and Marquez-Valdes Scantling are in the fold at wide receiver, Ronald Jones has been signed to play running back and Justin Reid has taken over for Tyrann Mathieu at safety. And the Chiefs might not be done, either.\n\nUNDATED (AP) — Duke and North Carolina are likely to get the most attention going into the men's Final Four this weekend. Yet the most dominant team so far in the NCAA Tournament just might be Kansas. The Jayhawks have dominated two of their four games, including a regional final win over Miami. They are also the only No. 1 seed left in the tournament. Kansas will play Villanova on Saturday. The winner advances to next Monday night's title game.\n\nUpdate on the latest sports\n\nNBA-SCHEDULE\n\nSiakam drops 40 as Raptors edge Celtics in OT\n\nUNDATED (AP) — Pascal Siakam (see-AHK'-uhm) had a season-high 40 points and 13 rebounds before fouling out, and the Toronto Raptors beat the short-handed Boston Celtics 115-112 in overtime.

The loss dropped the Hornets to ninth place in the Eastern Conference, a half-game behind the idle Brooklyn Nets.\n\n—Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 29 points to lead the Atlanta Hawks past the Indiana Pacers 132-123. Clint Capela and Kevin Huerter each contributed 22 points and Capela added 15 rebounds for the Hawks, who are 10th in the Eastern Conference.

The 6-foot Alvarado appeared in just eight of New Orleans' first 35 games this season, but has seen a surge in playing time lately.\n\n— Cavaliers forward Dean Wade will miss the rest of the season following knee surgery. It's the latest medical setback for a Cleveland. All-Star center Jarrett Allen has missed Cleveland's past 10 days with a broken finger.\n\n—Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will sit out the rest of the season after an ankle injury.
