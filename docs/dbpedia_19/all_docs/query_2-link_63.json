        "text": "Results\n\nThe features of the patients in the cohorts used for this study were previously reported in detail.\n\n4\n\nBerenguer J\n\nRyan P\n\nRodríguez-Baño J\n\net al.\n\nCharacteristics and predictors of death among 4035 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Spain.\n\n,\n\n5\n\nBorobia AM\n\nCarcas AJ\n\nArnalich F\n\net al.\n\nA cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a major teaching hospital in Europe.\n\nA two-step cluster analysis of variables collected at hospital admission identified three clinical phenotypes in the derivation cohort: phenotype A (516 [19%] of 2667 patients), phenotype B (1955 [73%] of 2667 patients), and phenotype C (196 [7%] of 2667 patients). The silhouette score was 0·6, indicating good quality of clustering. Exclusion of variables with a high proportion of missing data did not cause any evident changes (data not shown).\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the derivation and internal validation cohorts are present in the appendix (pp 7–12). Overall, patients with phenotype A were younger (mean age 55·2 years [SD 18·4] vs 68·7 years [15·9] and 77·2 years [10·9] in phenotypes B and C, respectively), were less frequently male (55% vs 63% and 69%), presented more frequently with headache (19% vs 9% and 7%), myalgia (29% vs 26% and 13%), and chest pain (15% vs 11% and 11%), had higher lymphocyte count (mean 1439 cells/μL [SD 1761] vs 1094 cells/μL [1424] and 1096 cells/μL [1170]), and had lower levels of inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, ferritin, or lactic acid dehydrogenase (appendix pp 7–9). Patients with phenotype B more frequently reported fever (83% vs 80% and 69% in phenotypes A and C, respectively) and cough (74% vs 68% and 63%), more frequently lacked pulmonary infiltrates in chest radiography (20% vs 46% and 25%), more frequently had interstitial infiltrates (45% vs 25% and 41%), and had higher levels of ferritin (mean 809·5 ng/mL [SD 588·4] vs 616·4 ng/mL [219·7] and 752·8 ng/mL [320·4]) and creatine phosphokinase (mean 164·3 U/L [SD 464·0] vs 150·8 U/L [368·2] and 141·4 U/L [199·0]; appendix pp 7–9). Patients with phenotype C more frequently had chronic heart disease (56% vs 13% and 23% in phenotypes A and B, respectively), hypertension (86% vs 31% and 53%), chronic lung disease (31% vs 8% and 19%), stage 4 chronic kidney disease (34% vs 3% and 3%), obesity (body-mass index >30 kg/m2; 23% vs 8% and 14%), diabetes (48% vs 10% and 22%), and acute altered mental status (18% vs 5% and 12%); had higher levels of neutrophils (mean 8539 cells/μL [SD 6656] vs 4112 cells/μL [2511] and 4892 cells/μL [2844]), D-dimer (mean 1343·1 μg/L [SD 2419·7] vs 715·8 μg/L [986·5] and 986·3 μg/L [3290·5]), procalcitonin (mean 0·70 ng/mL [SD 0·96] vs 0·17 ng/mL [0·26] and 0·27 ng/mL [0·51]), C-reactive protein (mean 127·1 mg/L [SD 119·8] vs 47·4 mg/L [68·3] and 88·8 mg/L [84·2]), creatinine (mean 2·76 mg/dL [SD 2·11] vs 0·96 mg/dL [0·56] and 0·99 mg/dL [0·36]), and potassium (mean 4·5 mEq/L [SD 0·7] vs 4·0 mEq/L [0·5] and 4·0 mEq/L [0·5]); and had poorer oxygenation parameters (appendix pp 7–9, Figure 1, Figure 2).\n\nWe repeated the two-step cluster analysis in the internal validation cohort. This analysis also selected three clusters with a very similar distribution of patients to the derivation cohort: phenotype A (233 [17%] of 1368 patients), phenotype B (1019 [74%] of 1368 patients), and phenotype C (116 [8%] of 1368 patients). The silhouette score was also 0·6, and the distribution of variables in the phenotypes was as in the derivation cohort, except for the proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis and active solid malignancies (which were not significantly different in the derivation cohort but were more frequent in phenotype C than in phenotype A or phenotype B in the internal validation cohort), haematological malignancy (no difference in the derivation cohort but less frequent in phenotype A than in phenotypes B and C in the internal validation cohort), and ferritin and creatine phosphokinase concentrations (which were higher in phenotype B than in phenotypes A and C in the derivation cohort and in phenotype C than in phenotypes A and B in the internal validation cohort; appendix pp 10–12).\n\nTo develop a simple way to assign patients to a phenotype, we developed and validated a parsimonious probabilistic model for belonging to phenotypes. We first did a bivariate analysis of the association of the different variables with phenotype A versus phenotype C and phenotype B versus phenotype C in the derivation cohort. We found a significant crude association with phenotype for many variables (table 1). After a variable selection process, we developed a final multinomial logistic regression model with 16 variables, including age, sex, chronic lung disease, obesity, diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation (room air), white blood cell count, neutrophils, haematocrit, coagulation international normalised ratio, C-reactive protein, glucose, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and type of lung infiltrate on chest radiograph (table 2). Therefore, we derived a simplified probabilistic model for patient assignment to phenotypes. The AUROC of the model for the observed data in the derivation cohort showed very good predictive ability for the three phenotypes (0·86, 95% CI 0·85–0·88 for phenotype A, 0·88, 0·86–0·89 for phenotype B, and 0·99, 0·99–0·99 for phenotype C). The predictive ability was similar in smaller, randomly selected subcohorts (appendix p 13).\n\nTable 2Multinomial logistic regression model for the prediction of phenotypes in the derivation cohort\n\nPhenotype A vs phenotype CPhenotype B vs phenotype COR (95% CI)p valueOR (95% CI)p valueAge (per year)0·93 (0·90–0·96)<0·00010·96 (0·93–0·99)0·0051Female sex0·68 (0·33–1·41)0·300·44 (0·22–0·89)0·021Chronic lung disease0·55 (0·26–1·16)0·100·79 (0·42–1·54)0·48Obesity (body-mass index >30 kg/m2)0·49 (0·20–1·23)0·120·71 (0·31–1·64)0·42White blood cells (per 103 cells/μL)0·80 (0·73–0·87)<0·00010·73 (0·68–0·79)<0·0011Neutrophils (per 103 cells/μL)0·89 (0·80–0·99)0·0320·99 (0·90–1·08)0·86C-reactive protein (per 102 mg/L)0·95 (0·91–1·00)0·0550·94 (0·90–0·99)0·011Diastolic blood pressure (per 1 mmHg)1·03 (1·01–1·05)0·0111·02 (1·01–1·04)0·013Oxygen saturation, room air, pulse oximetry (per 1%)1·56 (1·46–1·66)<0·00011·11 (1·07–1·16)<0·0001Lung infiltrate on chest radiographyNo infiltrate4·07 (1·83–9·02)0·000551·17 (0·55–2·49)0·69Unilateral3·50 (1·51–8·06)0·00322·05 (0·93–4·51)0·071Bilateral1 (ref)..1 (ref)..Creatinine (per 1 mg/dL)0·09 (0·05–0·15)<0·00010·06 (0·04–0·10)<0·0001Sodium (per 1 mEq/L)1·09 (1·02–1·17)0·0101·04 (0·98–1·11)0·14Potassium (per 1 mEq/L)0·37 (0·21–0·67)0·000930·26 (0·15–0·45)<0·0001Haematocrit (per 1%)1·29 (1·21–1·38)<0·00011·27 (1·19–1·35)<0·0001International normalised ratio (per unit)0·12 (0·07–0·22)<0·00010·12 (0·08–0·18)<0·0001Blood glucose (per 1 mg/dL)0·99 (0·98–0·99)<0·00010·99 (0·98–0·99)<0·0001\n\nThe variance inflation factor value was less than 2 in all cases. OR=odds ratio.\n\nThe capacity of the model to correctly assign patients to phenotypes was validated in the internal validation cohort for the phenotypes directly derived from that cohort. The ability of the model to predict the observed phenotypes in the internal validation cohort was also high (AUROC 0·86, 95% CI 0·84–0·89 for phenotype A; 0·86, 0·84–0·88 for phenotype B; and 0·95, 0·93–0·98 for phenotype C; appendix p 22).\n\nThe probabilistic model was then applied to the internal and external validation cohorts to obtain the individual probability of being assigned a specific phenotype. The number of patients in the internal validation cohort assigned to phenotypes A, B, and C according to their highest probability were 263 (19%), 1021 (75%), and 84 (6%), respectively (appendix pp 14–15). The corresponding figures for the external validation cohort were 323 (15%), 1757 (80%), and 105 (5%; appendix p 16). In the internal validation cohort, the distribution of all variables in the three predicted phenotypes was similar to that in the derivation cohort (appendix pp 14–15). For the external validation cohort, not all variables collected in the derivation cohort were available. Therefore, we checked the distribution of the variables included in the model, which was similar to that in the derivation cohort (appendix p 16).\n\nIn the derivation cohort, 30-day mortality rates were 2·5% (95% CI 1·4–4·3) for patients with phenotype A, 30·5% (28·5–32·6) for patients with phenotype B, and 60·7% (53·7–67·2) for patients with phenotype C (figure 3; appendix p 17). In the internal validation cohort, the mortality in the reproduced phenotypes was 2·6% (95% CI 1·0–5·6) for phenotype A, 31·0% (28·2–33·9) for phenotype B, and 53·4% (44·4–62·2) for phenotype C (appendix p 17). Regarding the phenotypes assigned on the basis of the probabilistic model, the mortality rates in the internal validation cohort were 5·3% (95% CI 3·4–8·1) for phenotype A, 31·3% (28·5–34·2) for phenotype B, and 59·5% (48·8–69·3) for phenotype C (figure 3; appendix p 17) and in the external validation cohort were 3·7% (2·0–6·4) for phenotype A, 23·7% (21·8–25·7) for phenotype B, and 51·4% (41·9–60·7) for phenotype C (the external validation cohort only had in-hospital mortality and not 30-day mortality data; figure 3; appendix p 17). All mortality data are summarised in the appendix (p 17).\n\nThe proportion of patients in the derivation cohort who needed intensive care unit care or had transfusion-requiring anaemia, pleural effusion, acute kidney failure, heart failure, bacterial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or cardiorespiratory arrest during admission was significantly increased in phenotype C compared with phenotypes A and B and significantly decreased in phenotype A compared with phenotypes B and C; differences were not significant for stroke, ischaemic coronary event, liver failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (appendix pp 7–9). Results were similar in the internal validation cohort, with the exception that liver failure was more frequent in phenotype B (appendix p 15).\n\nTo check whether the association of the phenotypes with mortality was maintained after considering different distributions of strong mortality predictors across the phenotypes, such as age and oxygen saturation, we did a stratified analysis per strata of these variables in the derivation cohort. In all strata, phenotypes were significantly associated with mortality (appendix p 18).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe identified three phenotypes based on demographics, underlying conditions, clinical and laboratory data, and radiological features at presentation among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The phenotypes, despite not intended to be used for predicting mortality, had clinical implications, as we observed associations with patient prognosis. We also developed a simplified probabilistic model that is potentially applicable to other cohorts.\n\nClinical presentation of COVID-19 is polymorphic. Clinical phenotypes have been described for patients with severe acute respiratory distress with potential implications for respiratory support therapy.\n\n9\n\nGattinoni L\n\nChiumello D\n\nCaironi P\n\net al.\n\nCOVID-19 pneumonia: different respiratory treatments for different phenotypes?.\n\nPhenotypes based only on self-declaration of symptoms by non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 using an app have been reported.\n\n10\n\nSudre CH\n\nLee KA\n\nLochlainn MN\n\net al.\n\nSymptom clusters in Covid19: a potential clinical prediction tool from the COVID Symptom study app.\n\nClinical phenotypes have been identified in patients with sepsis,\n\n11\n\nSeymour CW\n\nKennedy JN\n\nWang S\n\net al.\n\nDerivation, validation, and potential treatment implications of novel clinical phenotypes for sepsis.\n\nand a so-called hyperinflammatory phenotype has been proposed in patients with COVID-19.\n\n12\n\nSinha P\n\nCalfee CS\n\nCherian S\n\net al.\n\nPrevalence of phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a prospective observational study.\n\n,\n\n13\n\nManson JJ\n\nCrooks C\n\nNaja M\n\net al.\n\nCOVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and escalation of patient care: a retrospective longitudinal cohort study.\n\nHowever, to our knowledge, only one other study\n\n14\n\nAzoulay E\n\nZafrani L\n\nMirouse A\n\nLengliné E\n\nDarmon M\n\nChevret S\n\nClinical phenotypes of critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\nhas specifically investigated the existence of diverse clinical phenotypes for patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission; three phenotypes were also identified in that study\n\n14\n\nAzoulay E\n\nZafrani L\n\nMirouse A\n\nLengliné E\n\nDarmon M\n\nChevret S\n\nClinical phenotypes of critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\non the basis of clinical and laboratory features, using hierarchical clustering in 85 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, with a small number of variables.\n\nIn our study, the phenotypes we identified were associated with patient prognosis. By contrast with studies that generate outcome prediction scores or identify outcome predictors, in which the independent predictive association of each variable with the outcome is assessed, phenotypes provide information about how the population can be classified according to clustering of variables and how such clusters are associated with the outcome. As age and oxygen saturation are strong independent predictors of mortality,\n\n4\n\nBerenguer J\n\nRyan P\n\nRodríguez-Baño J\n\net al.\n\nCharacteristics and predictors of death among 4035 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Spain.\n\nwe did a stratified analysis of these variables. The results of this analysis suggest that the association of phenotypes with mortality is not only due to the different distribution of these variables in the phenotypes, but that the phenotypes are consistently associated with different mortality risks. However, the phenotypes are not expected to provide accurate prediction of prognosis, as done by predictive modelling, as the outcome rates in the phenotypes depend on the exact distribution of the strongest outcome predictors in each population to which the phenotypes are applied. In this sense, phenotypes are complementary to predictive scores. Beyond that, the phenotypes might reflect different profiles of pathogen and host interactions, as a consequence of different infecting viral load, natural or acquired humoral and cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2, or cell–receptor features and expression, alongside host genetic background.\n\n6\n\nMagleby R\n\nWestblade LF\n\nTrzebucki A\n\net al.\n\nImpact of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on risk of intubation and mortality among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019.\n\n,\n\n7\n\nMateus J\n\nGrifoni A\n\nTarke A\n\net al.\n\nSelective and cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in unexposed humans.\n\n,\n\n8\n\nEllinghaus D\n\nDegenhardt F\n\nBujanda L\n\net al.\n\nGenomewide association study of severe Covid-19 with respiratory failure.\n\nSince the databases used in this study only included phenotypic profiles and manifestations, we cannot provide information about underlying immunological or virological mechanisms. Future studies could reproduce the phenotypes and investigate their correlations with virological, immunological, and genetic data.\n\nWe did not analyse the duration of disease at hospital admission because the start of symptoms can be difficult to assess in many patients and can be confused with manifestations related to chronic conditions; in our experience, this is particularly frequent in older patients with comorbidities. The duration of symptoms could be relevant to differentiate between the viral and inflammatory phases of the disease,\n\n13\n\nManson JJ\n\nCrooks C\n\nNaja M\n\net al.\n\nCOVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and escalation of patient care: a retrospective longitudinal cohort study.\n\nbut a clear cutoff in the number of days to differentiate between the phases cannot currently be defined.\n\nClassification of patients into phenotypes might be useful to design treatment strategies. Very low-risk patients (eg, those with phenotype A who are younger than 60 years or with oxygen saturation >95%), who would need lower degrees of watchfulness and care, might be identified and discharged for ambulatory follow-up. Patients without initial criteria for being admitted to the intensive care unit but with phenotype B or phenotype C could be closely monitored during admission. As some aspects of the pathophysiology of the infection in patients with different phenotypes might be different, the therapeutic approach might need to be tailored on a patient-by-patient basis.\n\n15\n\nCao W\n\nLi T\n\nCOVID-19: towards understanding of pathogenesis.\n\nSince phenotype C comprises patients with laboratory parameters suggestive of a hyperinflammatory state, such patients might be selected to investigate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs. This strategy would allow more specific and efficient design of randomised trials. However, whether these phenotypes are useful for clinical purposes requires further investigation of the underlying mechanisms and more specific studies.\n\nSince the phenotypes were identified using a high number of variables, it would be difficult to apply them clinically in the absence of automated big data management. Therefore, we developed and validated a simplified probabilistic prediction model for phenotype assignment. A publicly available calculator and app have been developed to facilitate the classification of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 into phenotypes, using the probabilistic model for phenotype assignment.\n\nLimitations of our study are the high proportion of patients classified into phenotype B, reflecting the profile of the patients admitted during the first weeks of the epidemic in saturated hospitals, the exclusive participation of Spanish hospitals, and the high proportion of missing data for several variables. Hospital admission criteria might be different in other countries or at different times during the pandemic; however, the cohorts we used included patients with varying severity of disease. Some symptoms might not have been reported by the most severely ill patients. Finally, the phenotypes were derived and validated at hospital admission and would be useful for decisions at that time; whether changes in evolution due to the natural history of the disease or the influence of treatments modify the phenotype assignment needs further study. Strengths of our study include the use of well characterised cohorts, the inclusion of a high number of variables from different domains, and the validation.\n\nIn conclusion, patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can be classified into phenotypes that have prognostic implications. We developed a simplified tool for the probabilistic classification of patients into phenotypes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms leading to a particular phenotype."
