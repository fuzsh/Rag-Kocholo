CAVA\n\nType: Brut Nature\n\nGrape Varietals: Xarel.lo, Macabeo and Parellada\n\nAging: More than 20 months\n\n“We control the grapes from the vineyard in order to guarantee the highest quality.”\n\nAll generations of the Cavas Blancher family have adhered to this philosophy, adopted by our founder, ANTONIO CAPDEVILA PUJOL.\n\nWe consider controlling the vineyards essential - it allows us to certify the quality and production of the grapes.\n\nFor this reason, we control the entire vineyard process, from planting through production. We vinify in separate parcels (terroirs), so that our products are fully traceable. For many years, more than 90% of our harvests come from the same vineyards, so we can guarantee the quality of our products and ensure a consistent taste. All the grapes used to produce our wines and cavas have been pressed and fermented in our winery in the center of Sant Sadurni d'Anoia."
