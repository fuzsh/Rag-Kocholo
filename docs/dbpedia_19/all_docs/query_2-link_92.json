        "text": "This doctoral programme aims to train professionals and researchers with a global, interdisciplinary and critical perspective to address and work on problems arising in the fields of law, criminology, economics and political science. The Doctoral School and its doctoral programme in Law, Politics and Economics are part of the UOC's strategic objectives aimed at training global citizens and professionals, promoting transdisciplinarity and open knowledge with and for all, and creating environments that foster the co-creation of knowledge with other agents in society in order to increase its impact. The programme's teaching staff also share the transformation goals that are expressed in the sustainable development strategy.\n\nThe doctoral programme in Law, Politics and Economics is aimed at students with a university degree in any of the disciplines included in the programme, and who wish to study these fields of knowledge in depth and to make new and relevant contributions based on a rigorous approach to study. Candidates must meet the access requirements and admission criteria set out in section 3.2 of this document.\n\nAn objective of the UOC Doctoral School, and of the doctoral programme in Law, Politics and Economics in particular, is for doctoral students to benefit from interaction with the University's research groups and projects. Working in contact with a research group provides an overview of the various fields related to the subject of the doctoral research, and collaboration with research staff in the collection and analysing of data and the dissemination of results helps develop the know-how required for professional research.\n\nAdvanced training in the fields of law, political science and economics, and in related fields such as criminology, is of obvious general interest both for training teaching staff with strong skills in research and analysis of their specialist fields and for training highly qualified professionals in each of those fields.\n\nOur increasingly urgent social, political and economic challenges require new ways to tackle problems in both the legal-economic and political science fields. There are many challenges which take many different forms, ranging from the relentless digital transformation and the expansion of disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, to the emergence of an unexpected pandemic with its consequences for labour relations, the slowdown of growth, and the reshaping of social welfare and participation systems. These are just some specific examples that highlight the need for people with advanced training and research skills who can contribute to a thorough understanding of these phenomena, to formulating proposals and searching for solutions, and to their practical application. Catalan industry is not indifferent to this need, and the UOC aims to contribute by providing people who are highly qualified in their respective professional spheres Â¿ not only in the academic field, but also among legal, political and economic specialists.\n\nCompetencies:\n\nThe doctoral programme develops the following basic competencies (as per Spain's Royal Decrees RD 99/2011 and RD 576/2023):\n\nC1. Systematic understanding of a field of study and mastery of the research skills and methods related to this field.\n\nC2. Conceiving, designing or creating, putting into practice and adopting a substantial research or creation process.\n\nC3. Contributing to expanding the frontiers of knowledge through original research.\n\nC4. Developing a critical analysis and assessment and synthesizing new and complex ideas.\n\nC5. Communicating with the academic and scientific community and with society in general regarding the student's areas of knowledge, employing the formats and languages habitually used in their international scientific community.\n\nC6. Fostering scientific, technological, social, artistic or cultural progress in a knowledge-based society, in academic and professional settings.\n\nC7. Fostering open science and citizen science (in accordance with Article 12 of Spain's Organic Law 2/2023, of 22 March) so as to contribute to the status of scientific knowledge as a common good, with assessment of the doctoral student's performance of interdisciplinary activities relating to the different aspects of open science and citizen science, and the development of skills in both disciplines through microcredentials or similar.\n\nAdmission profiles:\n\nThe PhD programme in Law, Politics and Economics is for students who have a university degree in any of the programme's disciplines and are seeking a deeper understanding of these fields of knowledge and to make innovative and significant contributions to them through a rigorous approach to their object of study.\n\nCareer opportunities:\n\nDoctoral studies in law, criminology, political science, and economics are clearly useful both for training teaching staff with strong competencies for research into and analysis of their fields of specialization and for training highly qualified professionals in each of these areas.\n\nAdmission documents\n\nIf you are applying for access to a UOC doctoral programme, you must submit the following documents:\n\nA photocopy of your national identity document (e.g. ID card or passport).\n\nA letter of motivation/introduction, in which you provide a brief presentation of your career, and which must also include the specific motivations behind your candidacy, a description of your research interests, and your association with the research group.\n\nA letter of recommendation form faculty and/or research staff stating the full name, affiliation, postal address and email address of the person providing the reference.\n\nA letter of endorsement from a UOC professor or researcher who is a doctor in which he/she explains his/her interest in the project and eventually directing the student's doctoral thesis, which must be identified by name and surename.\n\nA CV with details of the master's degree and postgraduate programmes...\n\nIf you are applying for access to a UOC doctoral programme, you must submit the following documents:\n\nA photocopy of your national identity document (e.g. ID card or passport).\n\nA letter of motivation/introduction, in which you provide a brief presentation of your career, and which must also include the specific motivations behind your candidacy, a description of your research interests, and your association with the research group.\n\nA letter of recommendation form faculty and/or research staff stating the full name, affiliation, postal address and email address of the person providing the reference.\n\nA letter of endorsement from a UOC professor or researcher who is a doctor in which he/she explains his/her interest in the project and eventually directing the student's doctoral thesis, which must be identified by name and surename.\n\nA CV with details of the master's degree and postgraduate programmes and courses you have studied that are linked to the research interests mentioned in your letter of motivation and, where applicable, any previous scientific output.\n\nA sample of your recent academic work (in Catalan, English or Spanish).\n\nAcademic certificates of any studies prior to the doctoral course, showing the courses taken and the mark given, the exam sitting, the type of course, the number of credits and the average grade in the academic record (if these have not already been submitted to meet the access requirements).\n\nDocumentation certifying compliance with access requirements. You will find more information in the relevant section in the secretary's office section of the Campus.\n\nIf you have university qualifications from outside the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), you will need to legalize your certificate through diplomatic channels (or with the Hague Apostille where applicable). If your academic certificates are not in English or one of the official languages of Spain, you will need to provide a sworn translation in Catalan, English or Spanish. You may not be admitted to the doctoral programme if you do not provide these documents, or if any of the details they contain are not consistent with those entered in your application.\n\nAfter we have reviewed the access documents and accepted your applications, you will be admitted to the doctoral programme on the condition that you submit the official documents."
