        "text": "Argentina’s Miguel Pujol secured his maiden PSA Tour title at the Head Open this weekend, in what was his first event as a professional player, coming through the draw despite being unseeded.\n\nThe Challenger 3 level tournament was the first event to take place on Brazilian soil since the Paineiras Open Brasil on the Tour de las Americas in May 2018.\n\nPujol, who only joined the Tour earlier this month, came into the event unseeded, and he started his campaign with a convincing victory over No.6 seed Vitor Vieira, dropping just nine points in the match.\n\nHe then beat wildcard Gabriel Pederiva in the quarter finals, before coming up against No.2 seed Francesco Marcantonio in the last four. Pujol required less than half an hour to take the victory against the Paraguayan.\n\nIn the final, the unseeded Argentinian came up against Brazil’s Diego Gobbi, the tournament’s top seed, and once again, it was no bother for Pujol. He won out in 36 minutes to claim victory in his first event on Tour, doing so without dropping a single game in the event.\n\nResults: Head Open\n\nFinal\n\nMiguel Pujol (ARG) bt [1] Diego Gobbi (BRA) 3-0: 11-5, 11-9, 11-9 (36m)\n\nSemi-Finals\n\n[1] Diego Gobbi (BRA) bt [5] Yuri Pollak (BRA) 3-0: 11-5, 11-6, 11-6 (36m)\n\nMiguel Pujol (ARG) bt [2] Francesco Marcantonio (PAR) 3-0: 11-2, 11-5, 11-3 (28m)\n\nQuarter Finals\n\n[1] Diego Gobbi (BRA) bt [8] Lisandro Ortiz (ARG) 3-0: 11-6, 11-5, 11-8 (32m)\n\n[5] Yuri Pollak (BRA) bt [3] Pedro Mometto (BRA) 3-0: 1-0 rtd\n\nMiguel Pujol (ARG) bt [WC] Gabriel Pederiva (BRA) 3-0: 11-3, 11-7, 11-2 (35m)\n\n[2] Francesco Marcantonio (PAR) bt [WC] Murilo Fernandes (BRA) 3-2: 3-11, 11-5, 7-11, 11-6, 11-6"
