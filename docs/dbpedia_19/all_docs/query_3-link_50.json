        "text": "CC Sabathia—2000s (124.1 points, fourth), 2010s (79.3 points, 27th).\n\nOf those nine, three are batters—Pujols, Beltre and Cabrera—the other six are starting pitchers.\n\nThere are five players who ranked among the top 50 batters in Box-Toppers points in both decades. (See the top 50 batters in Box-Toppers points in both decades at the bottom of this page.) They are:\n\nPujols—2000s (121.9 points, first), 2010s (79.9 points, first).\n\nBeltre—2000s (55.2 points, 44th), 2010s (57.1 points, 16th).\n\nCabrera—2000s (72.1 points, 20th), 2010s (78.8 points, second).\n\nMatt Holliday—2000s (53.6 points, 47th), 2010s (47.2 points, 31st).\n\nDavid Ortiz—2000s (93.8 points, seventh), 2010s (49.4 points, 23rd).\n\n•\n\nBatters earned precipitously fewer Box-Toppers points in the 2010s than they did in the 2000s. The formula for determining Box-Toppers Player of the Game honors (the system by which Box-Toppers points are awarded) has remained unchanged since we began tracking in 1995. To win Player of the Game honors, a player must be determined to be the key player in a team’s win based on a formula derived from standard box scores.\n\nPrior to 2010, batters consistently earned half or more of all Box-Toppers points awarded but since 2010, batters’ share of points earned has consistently fallen to 45 percent or below—and as low as below 40 percent in two seasons.\n\nAs a result, the balance of power has shifted decidedly to pitchers; batters overall are earning far fewer points.\n\nFor example, Pujols led all batters in both decades, but the 79.9 points he had in the 2010s is only two-thirds of the 121.9 point total he had to lead batters in the 2000s. His 79.9 points from the 2010s would rank 16th among batters in the 2000s.\n\nAmong the top 50 players in the 2000s, the average Box-Toppers point total was 73.1. The average point total among the top 50 for the 2010s is 52.7, only 72 percent of the 2000s average total for top 50 batters.\n\nAnd with the decline in Box-Toppers points earned by batters, far fewer batters earned 15.0 or more Box-Toppers points in a single season in the 2010s compared to the 2000s. In the 2000s, there were 35 times in which a batter reached 15.0 Box-Toppers points in a single season, but in the 2010s, there were only seven times. (See the charts elsewhere on this page: Batters with 15.0+ BTPs in the 2000s and Batters with 15.0+ BTPs in the 2010s.)\n\nThere was only one time in the 2010s in which a batter finished among the season’s top 10 overall players. That was 2013, when Miguel Cabrera finished eighth overall with 16.9 points, the highest single-season point total for a batter during the decade. In the 2000s, batters finished among the top 10 overall players in Box-Toppers points 23 times and there was only one season in the 2000s (2005) in which a batter did not finish among the overall top 10.\n\nOf the top 100 overall players in the 2000s, 48 are batters and 52 are pitchers. But in the 2010s, only 21 of the top 100 overall players are batters—the other 79 are pitchers.\n\nOverall, in the 2000s, batters earned 51.71 percent of all Box-Toppers points awarded but that fell to 42.38 percent in the 2010s. That is a decline of 9.33 percent. But in essence, batters were earning only about 82 percent of the points they were previously earning. (Here’s a post from September 2018 showing charts and graphs and specific numbers to that date showing batters’ share of Box-Toppers points declining.)\n\nThe percentage of points in the 2000s represents a decline from the 1990s, though there is not data for the entire decade from 1990-1999. Box-Toppers tracking began in 1995, so we have five years of data. But during that span from 1995-1999, batters earned 54.13 percent of all points. That means batters were earning 1.28 times as many points in the 1990s as they did in the 2010s.\n\nBatters clearly earned a far lower share of Box-Toppers points in the 2010s than the 2000s. There was a notable shift at the turn of the last decade. From 1995 to 2009, batters earned half or more of all Box-Toppers points awarded each season except one—in 2002, batters earned 49.71 percent of all points, practically roundable to 50 percent. However, in 2010 and after, batters have earned fewer than half of all points in each of the decade’s 10 seasons—and twice they have slipped below 40 percent (39.14 percent in 2014 and 39.35 percent in 2018).\n\nBatters’ share of Box-Toppers points earned didn’t just gradually decline over time. The shares were very steady in the 2000s ranging from 56.91 percent in 2000 to 49.71 percent in 2002. The shares have also been very steady in the 2010s, ranging from 45.76 percent in 2010 to 39.41 percent in 2014. The weird and startling thing is that the whole scale just dropped 10 percent and it oddly coincided with the start of the 2010s. Consider this: The 2000s season with the lowest percentage share of points earned by batters (49.71 in 2002) is considerably higher than the 2010s season with the highest percentage share of points earned by batters (45.76 in 2010). The numbers from the 2000s do not overlap in any way with the numbers from the 2010s, as you might expect, especially since they are measuring players game-by-game using the exact same method.\n\nSomething not only changed but seems to have been greatly altered, mutated or transmogrified into something else entirely.\n\n•\n\nThere is a temptation to somehow change the Box-Toppers formula to backwards engineer it so it restores the balance between batters and pitchers. But to change the way Box-Toppers is measured would destroy the consistency we have built over the past 25 years. It would be more difficult (impossible even) to objectively compare past and present players if we changed the way Box-Toppers is formulated simply to restore balance to batters.\n\nThis problem with batters’ shares of Box-Toppers points declining is not a problem of Box-Toppers making, but perhaps a problem that Box-Toppers helps make more apparent. And rather than being a problem of statistics, it seems to be a problem of the game. It seems to be a problem that belongs to batters.\n\nFor whatever reason, batters’ performances in baseball, relative to pitchers’, has declined and declined precipitously. There are a variety of possible reasons—the eradication of steroids, the increasing use of the defensive shift, the increasing velocity of pitchers, the differing use of relief pitchers, the move by batters to focus on “launch angle,” which results in more home runs but many, many more strikeouts.\n\nPart of the problem here is that while people acknowledge these changes, they do not seem to acknowledge that batters are playing a far lesser role in the game than they did in 2009 and before. People still refer to batters and pitchers in almost equal terms, often conflating batters to be the stars of the game.\n\nIt may have been true before 2010, but since then, pitchers are eating batters’ lunches. Pitchers have always had a slight advantage in Box-Toppers points—no batter has ever led all players in Box-Toppers points in any of the 25 seasons of tracking, but there were three times when batters finished second overall—1996, Albert Belle of the Indians had 20.4 points; 2006, Lance Berkman of the Astros had 20.8 points; and 2007, Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees had 18.9 points. But while pitchers always had an advantage, batters still earned half or more of all Box-Toppers points up to 2009. In other words, batters were the player most responsible for helping his team win the game in more than 50 percent of all games for the 15 seasons from 1995 to 2009.\n\nBut in 2010 and after, pitchers have earned at least 54 percent of all points awarded each season. In two seasons, pitchers earned more than 60 percent of all points awarded. The tables have turned and pitchers are dominating.\n\nYet, we still talk about batters as if they are still as relevant as they were in the 2000s.\n\nReluctantly, I will use Mike Trout as an example. He is often referred to as the greatest player of his generation or one of the great all-time players. Trout does rank first among American League batters over the past six seasons, with 54.7 Box-Toppers points from 2014-19. He’s averaged 8.7 points per season over the past eight seasons. In other words, Trout is a very good player, among the best and most consistent batters of the past half decade.\n\nBut Box-Toppers doesn’t see Trout as anywhere near the top overall player of the decade of the 2010s. He does rank fourth among all batters of the decade (70.7 points), but that is merely 38th among all players, behind 34 pitchers and three other batters.\n\nFurther, if Trout had that same 70.7 points in the 2000s, he would rank 25th among that decade’s batters and 10th among all outfielders.\n\nFurther still, let’s compare Trout’s first nine seasons to another all-time great player, Trout’s teammate, Albert Pujols. Trout has 70.7 points over his first nine seasons, Pujols had 121.9 over his first nine (2001-2009). In other words, Pujols had 1.72 times as many points as Trout.\n\nSome things to consider: Pujols was playing on a Cardinals team that was consistently winning (Pujols was with the Cardinals through 2011 before signing with the Angels in 2012), while Trout played on an Angels team that did not win as much. Pujols was playing in a different era in which batters had more advantages and earned a larger share of Box-Toppers points. And Trout was kept in check by higher pitching velocity, frequent pitching changes, defensive shifts and a game in which the balance of power had swung to pitchers.\n\nBut consider one more thing. Let’s look at Pujols’s last nine seasons and compare them to Trout’s first nine. Trout has 70.7 points compared to Pujols’s 64.5. Trout is better—but not by a lot. It seems to me that that greatest player of his generation and possibly one of the greatest players of all time should far and away be his team’s and his era’s most dominant batter, especially when compared to an often injured, aging star who is an entire decade older.\n\nTrout’s Box-Toppers point total is a pale shade of Pujols’s Box-Toppers point total in his prime. You can argue the game has changed and that steroids have been removed from the game. But Pujols has never been suspected of steroid use. At its simplest level, he more often contributed to his team’s victories than Trout.\n\nSo when people say Mike Trout is the unquestioned greatest player of his generation and possibly the greatest of all time, I will simply say that’s not true—because I am questioning.\n\nIt is hard to say a batter is the greatest player in the game when all batters—even those who are better than average, even those who are the best of their era—are far less often the key contributor to their teams’ wins.\n\nAbout Box-Toppers—Box-Toppers tracks who most helps their team win the most games. Using standard box score statistics, Box-Toppers uses a simple formula to determine a Player of the Game for each Major League Baseball game played. That player is the person who contributed most to his team’s win. In regular season games, players earn 1.0 Box-Toppers point for being named Player of the Game and can earn bonus points for being Player of the Day or top player or batter in their league for the day."
