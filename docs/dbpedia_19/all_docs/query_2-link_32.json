EADs include highly prevalent mucosal diseases, such as eosinophilic asthma and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, but also less common eosinophilic vasculitis and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes.\n\nIn EADs, the increased presence of circulating eosinophils, known as eosinophilia, serves as a valuable diagnostic marker and is used for treatment allocation.

Recent studies concur in showing that myelopoiesis proceeds along 2 distinct arms; one consisting of lineages expressing the GATA1 (GATA-binding factor 1) transcription factor, which give rise to eosinophils, basophils, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes, and a separate arm that leads to the development of neutrophils and monocytes.\n\n13\n\nTusi B.K.\n\nWolock S.L.\n\nWeinreb C.\n\nHwang Y.\n\nHidalgo D.\n\nZilionis R.\n\nWaisman A.\n\nHuh J.R.\n\nKlein A.M.\n\nSocolovsky M.\n\nPopulation snapshots predict early haematopoietic and erythroid hierarchies.\n\n,\n\n14\n\nWeinreb C.\n\nRodriguez-Fraticelli A.\n\nCamargo F.D.\n\nKlein A.M.\n\nLineage tracing on transcriptional landscapes links state to fate during differentiation.\n\n,\n\n15\n\nJacobsen S.E.W.\n\nNerlov C.\n\nHaematopoiesis in the era of advanced single-cell technologies.\n\n,\n\n16\n\nDrissen R.\n\nBuza-Vidas N.\n\nWoll P.\n\nThongjuea S.\n\nGambardella A.\n\nGiustacchini A.\n\nMancini E.\n\nZriwil A.\n\nLutteropp M.\n\nGrover A.\n\net al.\n\nDistinct myeloid progenitor-differentiation pathways identified through single-cell RNA sequencing.\n\n,\n\n17\n\nDrissen R.\n\nThongjuea S.\n\nTheilgaard-Mönch K.\n\nNerlov C.\n\nIdentification of two distinct pathways of human myelopoiesis.\n\nTherefore, previous assumptions on eosinophilopoiesis built within the framework of the GMP and CMP concepts need revision.\n\nDue to the currently limited resolution of the eosinophil lineage, the mechanisms leading to increased eosinophil production from hematopoietic progenitors are also not well understood.\n\n18\n\nMack E.A.\n\nPear W.S.\n\nTranscription factor and cytokine regulation of eosinophil lineage commitment.\n\nIt is known that the cytokine interleukin (IL)-5\n\n19\n\nDougan M.\n\nDranoff G.\n\nDougan S.K.\n\nGM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 Family of Cytokines: Regulators of Inflammation.\n\nis essential to eosinophilia, as was established first in Il5-deficient mice.\n\n20\n\nFoster P.S.\n\nHogan S.P.\n\nRamsay A.J.\n\nMatthaei K.I.\n\nYoung I.G.\n\nInterleukin 5 deficiency abolishes eosinophilia, airways hyperreactivity, and lung damage in a mouse asthma model.\n\n,\n\n21\n\nKopf M.\n\nBrombacher F.\n\nHodgkin P.D.\n\nRamsay A.J.\n\nMilbourne E.A.\n\nDai W.J.\n\nOvington K.S.\n\nBehm C.A.\n\nKöhler G.\n\nYoung I.G.\n\net al.\n\nIL-5-Deficient Mice Have a Developmental Defect in CD5+ B-1 Cells and Lack Eosinophilia but Have Normal Antibody and Cytotoxic T Cell Responses.\n\nAlarmin cytokines such as IL-33 can also trigger eosinophilia but appear to do so indirectly by stimulating type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and helper T (Th2) cells, thereby increasing IL-5 production.\n\n22\n\nJarick K.J.\n\nTopczewska P.M.\n\nJakob M.O.\n\nYano H.\n\nArifuzzaman M.\n\nGao X.\n\nBoulekou S.\n\nStokic-Trtica V.\n\nLeclère P.S.\n\nPreußer A.\n\net al.\n\nNon-redundant functions of group 2 innate lymphoid cells.\n\nThe dependence of eosinophilia on IL-5 led to the development of neutralizing anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of EADs.\n\n23\n\nRoufosse F.\n\nTargeting the Interleukin-5 Pathway for Treatment of Eosinophilic Conditions Other than Asthma.\n\n,\n\n24\n\nPavord I.D.\n\nMenzies-Gow A.\n\nBuhl R.\n\nChanez P.\n\nDransfield M.\n\nLugogo N.\n\nKeene O.N.\n\nBradford E.S.\n\nYancey S.W.\n\nClinical Development of Mepolizumab for the Treatment of Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: On the Path to Personalized Medicine.\n\nThese precision therapies alleviate blood eosinophilia and are used in the treatment of severe forms of EADs including severe eosinophilic asthma.\n\n25\n\nHowell I.\n\nHowell A.\n\nPavord I.D.\n\nType 2 inflammation and biological therapies in asthma: Targeted medicine taking flight.\n\nCytotoxic antibodies to interleukin-5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) were also developed, which deplete virtually all tissue and circulating eosinophils.\n\n26\n\nFitzGerald J.M.\n\nBleecker E.R.\n\nNair P.\n\nKorn S.\n\nOhta K.\n\nLommatzsch M.\n\nFerguson G.T.\n\nBusse W.W.\n\nBarker P.\n\nSproule S.\n\net al.\n\nBenralizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody, as add-on treatment for patients with severe, uncontrolled, eosinophilic asthma (CALIMA): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.\n\nOther precision therapies for the treatment of EADs impact on blood eosinophil counts as well.

With the current shift toward precision therapies for EADs comes the need for a refined understanding of eosinophil development and lineage expansion.\n\nHere, we aimed to better resolve eosinophil development in humans and mice. We obtained single-cell resolution of eosinophilopoiesis by combining single-cell proteomic screening by flow cytometry, generating a transgenic IL-5Rα reporter mouse strain and (single-cell) transcriptomic analyses. Our comparative analyses highlighted the evolutionarily conserved ontogeny of eosinophils along a continuum of immunophenotypic stages of maturation in humans and mice. We illustrate how these transcriptomic and immunophenotypic resources may be leveraged to investigate the molecular requirements and cellular dynamics of eosinophil progenitor maturation and expansion in eosinophilia and to elucidate how IL-5 depletion impacts eosinophil development.\n\nResults\n\nDroplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing captures the first stages of eosinophilopoiesis\n\nWe first aimed to resolve the development of eosinophils, starting from their first identifiable progenitors in the BM of mice, with the aim of finding tractable cell surface markers for further identification. We resorted to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of lineage-negative c-Kit+ IL-7Rα− progenitors sorted from the BM of steady-state mice using a 10X droplet-based approach to generate a “snapshot” of the ontogenic relationships of early eosinophil progenitors.\n\n13\n\nTusi B.K.\n\nWolock S.L.\n\nWeinreb C.\n\nHwang Y.\n\nHidalgo D.\n\nZilionis R.\n\nWaisman A.\n\nHuh J.R.\n\nKlein A.M.\n\nSocolovsky M.\n\nPopulation snapshots predict early haematopoietic and erythroid hierarchies.\n\n,\n\n30\n\nLaurenti E.\n\nGöttgens B.\n\nFrom haematopoietic stem cells to complex differentiation landscapes.\n\nUniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP\n\n31\n\nBecht E.\n\nMcInnes L.\n\nHealy J.\n\nDutertre C.-A.\n\nKwok I.W.H.\n\nNg L.G.\n\nGinhoux F.\n\nNewell E.W.\n\nDimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP.\n\n) displayed the 2 major branches of myelopoiesis (Figure 1A), with one arm giving rise to monocytes and neutrophils and another arm of Gata1-expressing progenitors leading to the erythroid, megakaryocyte, basophil, and eosinophil lineages (Figure 1B). Early eosinophil-committed progenitors were identified based on their expression of eosinophil marker genes (Epx, Prg3, etc.) and displayed quality of data comparable with that of other progenitors (Figures 1C and S1A; Table S1).\n\nTo zoom in on eosinophil ontogeny, we sub-selected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) clusters containing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), marked by the expression of the hepatic leukemia factor (Hlf) transcription factor\n\n32\n\nGiladi A.\n\nPaul F.\n\nHerzog Y.\n\nLubling Y.\n\nWeiner A.\n\nYofe I.\n\nJaitin D.\n\nCabezas-Wallscheid N.\n\nDress R.\n\nGinhoux F.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell characterization of haematopoietic progenitors and their trajectories in homeostasis and perturbed haematopoiesis.\n\n, and those belonging to the Gata1-expressing sub-branch leading to the basophil/mast cell and eosinophil lineages (Figures 1B and 1C). UMAP of this sub-selection and Slingshot trajectory inference displayed a continuum from HSPCs toward eosinophil/basophil/mast cell (EBM) progenitors, which in turn separated into basophil-committed and eosinophil-committed progenitors identifiable by lineage marker genes such as Cd200r3 and Epx, respectively (Figures 1D–1F). We did not detect progenitors with specific mast cell markers different from markers also shared with basophils, possibly owing to the rarity of mast cells in normal murine BM. Previous scRNA-seq analyses on larger number of progenitors identified putative mast cell progenitors in murine BM, which were proposed to share a common progenitor pool with basophils.\n\n33\n\nDahlin J.S.\n\nHamey F.K.\n\nPijuan-Sala B.\n\nShepherd M.\n\nLau W.W.Y.\n\nNestorowa S.\n\nWeinreb C.\n\nWolock S.\n\nHannah R.\n\nDiamanti E.\n\net al.\n\nA single-cell hematopoietic landscape resolves 8 lineage trajectories and defects in Kit mutant mice.\n\nBased on this current hypothesis, we postulate that EBM clusters identified here likely encompassed progenitors of both basophils and BM-derived mast cells, but we will not refer to mast cells in subsequent analyses of our scRNA-seq dataset.\n\nWe then used single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC)\n\n34\n\nAibar S.\n\nGonzález-Blas C.B.\n\nMoerman T.\n\nHuynh-Thu V.A.\n\nImrichova H.\n\nHulselmans G.\n\nRambow F.\n\nMarine J.-C.\n\nGeurts P.\n\nAerts J.\n\net al.\n\nSCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering.\n\nto position the activity of key transcription factors involved in eosinophilopoiesis in this actualized developmental path. We observed 4 major patterns among regulons. The first cluster consisted of regulons of transcription factors associated with HSCs, such as HLF (Figure S1B). A second cluster displayed upregulated activity of transcription factors in EBM progenitors, which included GATA1 and GATA2, consistent with their belonging to the GATA1 arm of myelopoiesis. EBM progenitors also upregulated the activity of transcription factors involved in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, including X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which is particularly important for eosinophil maturation.\n\n35\n\nBettigole S.E.\n\nLis R.\n\nAdoro S.\n\nLee A.-H.\n\nSpencer L.A.\n\nWeller P.F.\n\nGlimcher L.H.\n\nThe transcription factor XBP1 is selectively required for eosinophil differentiation.\n\nA third cluster of transcription factors involved in terminal myeloid cell maturation and function was upregulated in basophil progenitors.

Noticeably, Il5ra gene expression was detectable in the first identifiable eosinophil progenitors, but not earlier (Figure S1C). Aside from Il5ra, we did not identify detectable or discriminating expression of other cell surface markers, including Siglecf, Adgre1 (encoding F4/80), or Ccr3 (Table S1; Figure S1C). The earliest identifiable eosinophil progenitors in mice hence might be best defined by exclusion of other lineages.\n\nscRNA-seq is limited for resolving eosinophil maturation\n\nWe next evaluated whether different automated methods of scRNA-seq could be implemented to identify cell surface markers resolving eosinophil maturation downstream of lineage commitment. We reanalyzed a recently published dataset of well-based scRNA-seq on Siglec-F+ BM cells from highly eosinophilic IL-5 transgenic mice.\n\n8\n\nGurtner A.\n\nBorrelli C.\n\nGonzalez-Perez I.\n\nBach K.\n\nAcar I.E.\n\nNúñez N.G.\n\nCrepaz D.\n\nHandler K.\n\nVu V.P.\n\nLafzi A.\n\net al.\n\nActive eosinophils regulate host defence and immune responses in colitis.\n\nUsing a recommended resolution in Seurat returned 4 clusters of eosinophil-lineage cells in the BM of these mice, which differed by their expression of genes associated with eosinophil function (Epx, Ccr3, etc.) and the cell cycle (Mki67, Top2a, etc.) (Figure S2A). Complicating the analysis, no differential expression of cell surface marker genes could be detected that discriminated the different clusters of eosinophils from each other, except for a putatively more mature Ccr3-expressing subset (Table S2). We likewise performed a 10X droplet-based analysis on Siglec-F+ BM cells from mice rendered highly eosinophilic by repeated injections of IL-33. This method recovered analyzable eosinophils too, this time in 3 predicted clusters, differing again by their expression of genes associated with eosinophil function (Epx, Ccr3, Prg3, etc.) and the cell cycle (Pcna, etc.) (Figure S2B). Yet again, only the presumably more mature eosinophil subset differentially expressed cell surface marker genes such as Ccr3 (Table S2). Finally, we tested whether fixing cells in droplet-based 10X Flex scRNA-seq could provide more RNA data in eosinophils among CD55+ dump (Ly6G, B220, NK1.1, and CD90.2)−cells of GATA1-expressing lineages from steady-state wild-type mice. Additionally, cells were labeled with oligo-tagged antibodies to improve lineage identification and the recovery of cells with low RNA content. Combining RNA and protein information allowed the identification of the major GATA1 lineages and captured a continuum of eosinophil maturation from c-Kit+ CCR3− to c-Kit− CCR3hi eosinophils along 4 putative clusters (Figures S2C–S2E). Nonetheless, the cellular RNA information dropped along eosinophil maturation, leading to a resolution that relied mostly on protein data. Altogether, while different platforms were able to capture eosinophils, depth of analysis and cell recovery in scRNA-seq were suboptimal, especially for mature eosinophils. Reasons for this issue remain to be fully resolved but are often assumed to relate to high amounts of inhibitor-resistant RNases in eosinophils.\n\n39\n\nWilkerson E.M.\n\nJohansson M.W.\n\nHebert A.S.\n\nWestphall M.S.\n\nMathur S.K.\n\nJarjour N.N.\n\nSchwantes E.A.\n\nMosher D.F.\n\nCoon J.J.\n\nThe Peripheral Blood Eosinophil Proteome.\n\nSingle-cell proteomic screening in flow cytometry resolves the maturation of murine eosinophils\n\nDue to limitations of scRNA-seq in resolving eosinophil maturation, we turned to single-cell surface proteome screening by flow cytometry, which has been previously used to resolve neutropoiesis.\n\n40\n\nKwok I.\n\nBecht E.\n\nXia Y.\n\nNg M.\n\nTeh Y.C.\n\nTan L.\n\nEvrard M.\n\nLi J.L.Y.\n\nTran H.T.N.\n\nTan Y.\n\net al.\n\nCombinatorial Single-Cell Analyses of Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor Heterogeneity Reveals an Early Uni-potent Neutrophil Progenitor.\n\nWe used our scRNA-seq analyses to inform an initial backbone marker panel aimed at capturing the continuum between the earliest identifiable eosinophil progenitors among c-Kit+ CD55+ GATA1 progenitors and mature eosinophils known to express CCR3 and Siglec-F, while excluding other lineages (Figure S3A).

Major cell populations were classified using lineage markers based on prior knowledge (Figure S3C; Table S3). UMAP of the Infinity Flow output provided a consistent snapshot of the ontogenic relationships of eosinophils (Figures 1H and 1I). The eosinophil lineage emerged from a pool of CD55+ c-Kit+ Sca-1+ HSPCs, from which also diverged the erythroid, megakaryocytic, mast cell, and basophil lineages, while monocytes and neutrophils were excluded from this branch of myelopoiesis (Figures 1H and 1J). Downstream of the early divergence of CD55+ GATA1 lineages, eosinophils arose together with basophils and mast cells from a pool of CD45+ CD55+ CD115− CCR3− dump− CD200R3− CD11b− c-Kitint Sca-1− CD150− progenitors (Figures 1H and 1K).\n\nWe next inspected the 132 antibodies that labeled cells of the eosinophil lineage and improved the resolution of eosinophil maturation (Table S4). UMAP of the Infinity Flow output identified a continuum of eosinophil maturation comprising 4 main immunophenotypes appearing as distinguishable density nodes. To facilitate the further characterization of eosinophil progenitors at different stages of their maturation process, we chose to partition the continuum of eosinophil maturation based on these 4 immunophenotypes, which we refer to here as stages I–IV (Figure 2A). Among the 21 antibodies delivering a strong signal (background-corrected median fluorescence intensity [MFI] > 103) at any stage of eosinophil maturation were markers previously associated with murine eosinophil progenitors such as CD34, which became downregulated along eosinophil maturation, as well as markers of mature eosinophils and granulocytes such as CCR3/CD193 and CD11b, which were progressively upregulated (Figure 2A). We optimized our initial panel by incorporating 3 additional markers: paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PIR)-A/B, a marker highly upregulated along eosinophil maturation (Figures 2A–2D), as well as F4/80 and CD29 (also known as integrin-β1, ITGB1) as discriminating markers that help exclude contaminant cells (Figures 2B–2D and S3D). The resulting 9-color conventional flow cytometric panel allowed us to identify and sort 4 stages of murine eosinophil maturation (Figures 2C–2E). Progenitors in stages I and II displayed eosinophilic granules and large, often contorted, nuclei, with central hollowing of the nucleus visible in a majority of stage II cells (Figure 2E). Cells in stage III were distinctively smaller than in stages I–II and exhibited ring-shaped nuclei, while stage IV cells displayed the classical morphology of mature murine eosinophils.\n\nNext, we aimed to characterize the relationship between these 4 stages of eosinophil development using bulk RNA sequencing. Principal component analysis (PCA) positioned the 4 stages on a continuum along the first principal component (PC1) that captured 76% of the variance (Figure 2F). This analysis highlighted a major transcriptional transition happening between stages II and III, even though pairwise comparisons returned hundreds of differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) at transitions between stages I–II and III–IV (Figure 2F). We used hierarchical clustering to identify prominent patterns of gene regulation (>100 genes/pattern) in a likelihood ratio test (LRT) identifying well-expressed genes (baseMean > 100) that were differentially expressed along eosinophilopoiesis (FDR < 1.10−4) and tested their enrichment in gene ontology (GO) biological pathways. Stage I progenitors displayed on average the highest expression of genes associated with protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, while eosinophil granule protein-coding genes and genes associated with the cell cycle were highly expressed in both stages I and II (Figures 2G–2I; Table S5). Expression of these genes decreased in stages III and IV. Stage III cells displayed higher expression of a small set of genes associated with innate immunity, including eosinophil-associated RNases. Finally, genes associated with mature myeloid cell function were progressively upregulated along eosinophil maturation, reaching their peak expression in stage IV eosinophils. The downregulation of eosinophil granule- and cell-cycle-associated genes in the transition between stages II and III, and the upregulation of myeloid-function-associated genes, were the most prominent transcriptomic changes along steady-state eosinophilopoiesis. The above data were consistent with cells in stages I–II being myelocytes primarily involved in eosinophil granule production and lineage expansion in the steady state, before transitioning toward non-proliferating stage III metamyelocytes and stage IV mature eosinophils.\n\nSingle-cell proteomic screening in flow cytometry shows conservation of human and murine eosinophilopoiesis\n\nWe performed a similar surface proteome screening in healthy human BM (Figures 3A and S4A). We used UMAP visualization of the Infinity Flow output and annotated major cell populations using lineage markers (Figures 3B, 3C, S4B, and S4C; Table S3). Confirming the robustness of the approach, a sub-analysis of neutrophil lineage cells captured 4 previously proposed stages of neutrophil maturation\n\n40\n\nKwok I.\n\nBecht E.\n\nXia Y.\n\nNg M.\n\nTeh Y.C.\n\nTan L.\n\nEvrard M.\n\nLi J.L.Y.\n\nTran H.T.N.\n\nTan Y.\n\net al.\n\nCombinatorial Single-Cell Analyses of Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor Heterogeneity Reveals an Early Uni-potent Neutrophil Progenitor.\n\n(Figure S4D). As in mice, human eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells shared a common pool of progenitors (Figures 3B and 2D). Of note, surface expression of IL-5Rα (also known as CD125) was upregulated in committed eosinophil progenitors compared with cells engaging toward the basophil and mast cell lineages (Figure 3D).\n\nWe then focused on eosinophil maturation and observed that the continuum of maturation of human eosinophils encompassed 4 main immunophenotypes in our analysis, similar to mice (Figure 4A). Hence, we opted to partition the continuum of human eosinophil maturation into 4 stages as well (I–IV). To generate a conventional flow cytometric antibody panel for human eosinophil maturation, we inspected the 153 screening antibodies that stained eosinophil-lineage cells (Table S6) and focused on the 43 antibodies generating strong signal (background-corrected MFI > 2.103) in at least one of the 4 stages of eosinophil maturation (Figure 4B). This selection contained known surface markers of human eosinophils in addition to markers not previously reported on human eosinophils, such as TNF receptor superfamily member 12A (TNFRSF12A, also known as CD266) (Figure 4B). Because of its dynamic regulation along human eosinophilopoiesis, we included CD84 into an optimized 10-color flow cytometric panel. We used this panel to isolate and study consecutive immunophenotypic stages of human eosinophil maturation (Figures 4C–4E). Based on their distinctive eosinophilic granule content and nuclear shape, cells in stage I–II were eosinophilic myelocytes, whereas stage III cells were metamyelocytes and stage IV cells were mature eosinophils (Figure 4E).\n\nNext, we sorted the above 4 stages of human eosinophil maturation from 3 healthy donors and compared their transcriptome by RNA-seq. A PCA positioned these 4 stages on a continuum along PC1 that captured 71% of the variance (Figure 4F, upper). As in mice, the most prominent transcriptomic changes happened between stages II and III, even though transitions between stages I–II and III–IV involved changes in the expression of hundreds of genes (Figure 4F, lower). Three main patterns of changes of gene expression were observed along human eosinophilopoiesis (Figure 4G; Table S7). Like in mice, progenitors in stage I displayed the highest expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, while cells in stages I and II displayed the highest expression of eosinophil granule- and cell-cycle-associated genes (Figures 4G–4I). The transition to stage III metamyelocytes was accompanied by a downregulation of these genes, while the expression of myeloid-function-associated genes steadily increased from stages I to IV. These analyses highlight a conserved developmental program of eosinophilopoiesis in both humans and mice, providing a basis for translational studies as well as opportunities to study shared mechanisms of eosinophil development.\n\nEosinophil progenitor expansion is driven by increased transit amplification\n\nHaving resolved a conserved developmental trajectory of eosinophilopoiesis, we aimed to uncover the mechanisms underlying eosinophil progenitor expansion using models of eosinophilic disease in mice. We first used a very robust model of eosinophilia with features of eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis,\n\n42\n\nKotas M.E.\n\nDion J.\n\nVan Dyken S.\n\nRicardo-Gonzalez R.R.\n\nDanel C.J.\n\nTaillé C.\n\nMouthon L.\n\nLocksley R.M.\n\nTerrier B.\n\nA role for IL-33–activated ILC2s in eosinophilic vasculitis.\n\nconsisting of daily intraperitoneal injections of IL-33, and followed changes in the maturation stages of eosinophils through time by flow cytometry (Figures 5A–5D). Importantly, the immunophenotyping panel established for steady-state eosinophilopoiesis continued to resolve 4 main immunophenotypic stages of eosinophil maturation in eosinophilic conditions (Figure S5A). Abundance of cells in maturation stages I, II, and III increased over time, reaching a peak fold amplification at the end of the 7 days of IL-33 treatment (Figures 5B and 5C). Discontinuation of IL-33 stimulation led to a drop in the abundance of stage III progenitors, paralleled by a further increase of mature stage IV eosinophils in the BM and blood. Abundance of stage I–III progenitors returned close to baseline values within 5 days, while blood and BM mature eosinophils started to decrease.\n\nA similar dynamic expansion of the eosinophil lineage was observed in response to subcutaneous infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis larvae. Eosinophil progenitors were expanded on day 8, the time around which the parasite is cleared in mice\n\n43\n\nBouchery T.\n\nVolpe B.\n\nShah K.\n\nLebon L.\n\nFilbey K.\n\nLeGros G.\n\nHarris N.\n\nThe Study of Host Immune Responses Elicited by the Model Murine Hookworms Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus.\n\n,\n\n44\n\nRolot M.\n\nDougall A.M.\n\nChetty A.\n\nJavaux J.\n\nChen T.\n\nXiao X.\n\nMachiels B.\n\nSelkirk M.E.\n\nMaizels R.M.\n\nHokke C.\n\net al.\n\nHelminth-induced IL-4 expands bystander memory CD8+ T cells for early control of viral infection.\n\n(Figure 5E). Progenitor abundance returned toward a steady-state profile by day 15 post infection, even though blood and BM mature eosinophils remained increased (Figure 5E). In a model of repeated intranasal administration of extracts of the allergenic mold Alternaria alternata, abundance of eosinophil-lineage cells increased after 8 days of continued stimulation and returned to baseline values within 7 days of cessation of exposure, even though this model induced milder progenitor expansion and BM and blood eosinophilia than the other models (Figure 5F). In all 3 models, there was a noticeable correlation between the abundance of stage IV eosinophils in the BM and circulating blood eosinophils, which shared a similar CCR3+ Siglec-F+ phenotype (Figures 5B–5F).\n\nTo identify the most prominent changes occurring in eosinophil-lineage cells in response to eosinophilia-promoting stimuli, we compared the transcriptomes of stage I–IV eosinophils from IL-33-treated mice with steady-state counterparts. In a PCA, stage I–III progenitors of IL-33-treated mice were shifted leftward in PC1, which captured 67% of the variance (Figure 6A). Genes with negative loadings in PC1 were enriched in cell-cycle-related genes, whereas genes with positive loadings were enriched in genes associated with myeloid cell function (Figure 6B). Two major patterns of transcriptomic changes were noticeable in eosinophilia (Figures 6C–6E; Table S8); first, 2 clusters enriched in genes related to leukocyte responses and maturation, such as Ccr3, displayed delayed upregulation along eosinophilopoiesis. Second, another large cluster of genes containing eosinophil granule-, cell-cycle-, and translation-associated genes retained elevated expression in stage III progenitors of IL-33-treated mice. In addition, bulk SCENIC analysis identified 2 major clusters of regulons differing between steady state and eosinophilia that were congruent with the above mRNA expression patterns (Figure 6F); one cluster comprised transcription factors associated with immune responses such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), whose upregulation was delayed in eosinophilia, and another cluster contained E2Fs and MYC, which remained upregulated in stage III. SCENIC also identified a third cluster comprising GATA2 that was upregulated at all stages of maturation and a fourth cluster featuring IRF8 that was downregulated throughout eosinophilopoiesis in IL-33-treated mice. Gene expression of the aforementioned transcription factors followed the same pattern as their regulons (Figure S5B).\n\nThe above transcriptomic observations suggested that eosinophil progenitors from IL-33-treated mice acquired a fully mature phenotype more slowly while retaining cell cycling activity for longer. In vivo 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) nucleotide incorporation assays using a short 1-h pulse confirmed this assumption. Not only was the percentage of EdU+ stage I–II progenitors increased in the BM of IL-33-treated mice (Figures 6G and S5C), the percentage of EdU+ stage III eosinophils also increased up to ∼20% compared with ∼2% in steady-state mice. Eosinophil progenitors developing during IL-33-promoted eosinophilia hence displayed increased cell cycling activity and retained the ability to divide for longer. We obtained similar results in models of N. brasiliensis infection as well as in the milder model of exposure to A. alternata (Figures 6H and 6I). Altogether, the above findings support the notion that eosinophil progenitor expansion in eosinophilia was sustained by a dynamic increase in transit amplification relying on the slower acquisition of a fully mature phenotype and increased and prolonged proliferation capacity.\n\nIRF8 is not intrinsically essential to eosinophil maturation and expansion\n\nTo illustrate the tractability of our data in clarifying the molecular determinants of eosinophil development and expansion, we investigated the yet uncertain role of IRF8 in eosinophilopoiesis (Figures S5D–S5I). The pattern of mRNA expression of IRF8 and its predicted activity in eosinophilia were inconsistent with an essential, intrinsic role in eosinophil lineage development or expansion. Still, in the steady state, the BM of IRF8-deficient mice was highly eosinopenic (Figure S5F), as described previously.\n\n38\n\nMilanovic M.\n\nTerszowski G.\n\nStruck D.\n\nLiesenfeld O.\n\nCarstanjen D.\n\nIFN Consensus Sequence Binding Protein (Icsbp) Is Critical for Eosinophil Development1.\n\nNevertheless, all stages of maturation of eosinophils were present in IRF8-deficient mice and their relative abundance was comparable to that of wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, in response to IL-33, stage I–III eosinophil progenitors of IRF8-deficient mice expanded and incorporated EdU with a magnitude comparable to wild-type controls (Figures S5D–S5G, compare with Figure 6G). BM eosinopenia in IRF8-deficient mice was, on the other hand, accompanied by a general depression of GATA1-expressing lineage cells up to the HSPC pool, reflecting the profound perturbations of hematopoiesis in these mice (Figures S5G–S5I). Hence, eosinopenia in IRF8-deficient mice was not primarily caused by an intrinsic defect of the eosinophil lineage, but mainly by perturbations of HSPCs upstream of eosinophil lineage commitment.\n\nDepletion of IL-5 impairs expansion of eosinophil progenitors in steady state and eosinophilia\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the reduction in blood eosinophilia following neutralization of IL-5, ranging from reduced commitment and expansion to maturational arrest of eosinophil progenitors.\n\n45\n\nFulkerson P.C.\n\nSchollaert K.L.\n\nBouffi C.\n\nRothenberg M.E.\n\nIL-5 Triggers a Cooperative Cytokine Network That Promotes Eosinophil Precursor Maturation.\n\n,\n\n46\n\nMenzies-Gow A.\n\nFlood-Page P.\n\nSehmi R.\n\nBurman J.\n\nHamid Q.\n\nRobinson D.S.\n\nKay A.B.\n\nDenburg J.\n\nAnti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) therapy induces bone marrow eosinophil maturational arrest and decreases eosinophil progenitors in the bronchial mucosa of atopic asthmatics.\n\nTo help better characterize the activities of IL-5 in vivo, we generated IL-5Rα reporter (IL5RAporter) mice, allowing straightforward identification of cells expressing Il5ra. IL5RAporter mice harbor an inactivating knockin eGFP-T2A-Cre transgene in frame with the start codon of the native Il5ra locus (Figure 7A). The IL5RAporter allele labeled stages I–IV of the eosinophil lineage as well as a small subset of B cells (Figures 7B and S6A), in line with previous studies that reported on IL5RA gene expression in eosinophils and in a subset of B cells.\n\n47\n\nYoshida T.\n\nIkuta K.\n\nSugaya H.\n\nMaki K.\n\nTakagi M.\n\nKanazawa H.\n\nSunaga S.\n\nKinashi T.\n\nYoshimura K.\n\nMiyazaki J.\n\net al.\n\nDefective B-1 Cell Development and Impaired Immunity against Angiostrongylus cantonensis in IL-5Rα-Deficient Mice.\n\n,\n\n48\n\nWang W.\n\nXu Y.\n\nWang L.\n\nZhu Z.\n\nAodeng S.\n\nChen H.\n\nCai M.\n\nHuang Z.\n\nHan J.\n\nWang L.\n\net al.\n\nSingle-cell profiling identifies mechanisms of inflammatory heterogeneity in chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\nIL5RAporter mice may also be used to induce Cre recombination in the eosinophil lineage of floxed mice (Figure 7B). Of note, neutrophils have been reported to display high surface staining with T21 and REA343 anti-IL-5Rα antibodies in mice\n\n5\n\nMesnil C.\n\nRaulier S.\n\nPaulissen G.\n\nXiao X.\n\nBirrell M.A.\n\nPirottin D.\n\nJanss T.\n\nStarkl P.\n\nRamery E.\n\nHenket M.\n\net al.\n\nLung-resident eosinophils represent a distinct regulatory eosinophil subset.\n\n,\n\n49\n\nGrisaru-Tal S.\n\nDulberg S.\n\nBeck L.\n\nZhang C.\n\nItan M.\n\nHediyeh-Zadeh S.\n\nCaldwell J.\n\nRozenberg P.\n\nDolitzky A.\n\nAvlas S.\n\net al.\n\nMetastasis-Entrained Eosinophils Enhance Lymphocyte-Mediated Antitumor Immunity.\n\n(Figure S6B). Yet, neutrophils did not express the IL5RAporter transgene (Figure S6C) and neutrophils of Il5ra-deficient IL5RAporterKI/KI mice stained similarly to neutrophils from wild-type control mice with these anti-CD125 clones (Figure S6B), indicating that they cross-react with an unidentified neutrophil antigen. A third clone, DIH37, did not display this unspecific staining of neutrophils, but generated only mildly higher MFI in control compared with IL-5Rα-deficient eosinophils (Figure S6B). IL5RAporter mice were, therefore, superior to currently available alternatives in identifying cell types expressing IL-5Rα in mice.\n\nWe used IL5RAporterKI/+ mice to identify the earliest IL-5Rα-expressing hematopoietic progenitors in the murine BM by conventional flow cytometry. Consistent with our scRNA-seq analysis, the IL5RAporter allele became expressed after the divergence point of the basophil/mast cell and eosinophil lineages, only in cells committed to the eosinophil fate (Figures 7C, 7D, and S6D). These results establish that IL-5 can only be expected to directly influence eosinophilopoiesis after lineage commitment in mice.\n\nFinally, we assessed the impact of the depletion of IL-5 on eosinophilopoiesis in the steady state and in eosinophilia. We first inspected the consequences of genetic deletion of IL-5 using Il5−/− mice. All stages of eosinophil maturation were still present in Il5−/− mice (Figure 7E). The abundance of stage I progenitors in IL-5-deficient mice was comparable to that of reference control values (Figure 7F), but lineage expansion along stages II and III was reduced, resulting in lower mature BM eosinophil abundance. In addition, stimulation by repeated administration of IL-33 for 7 days failed to expand stage I–III progenitors in Il5−/− mice (Figure 7F). We also assessed the consequences of depleting IL-5 on established eosinophilia using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Treatment with anti-IL5 antibodies of wild-type mice rendered eosinophilic by injections of IL-33 accelerated the contraction of stage I–III eosinophil progenitors toward steady-state reference values (Figure 7G). Anti-IL-5 treatment led to earlier upregulation of genes associated with mature myelocyte function alongside earlier downregulation of genes associated with cell cycling and translation (Figures 7H and 7I), consistent with a decrease in transit amplification. Altogether, these data indicate that IL-5 was an essential promoter of the post-commitment expansion of eosinophil progenitors through transit amplification in both the steady state and in response to eosinophilia-promoting signals but was not required for their maturation."
