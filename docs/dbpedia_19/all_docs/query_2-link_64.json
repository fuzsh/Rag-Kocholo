        "text": "❖ In a prospective, multicenter study of nearly 2,500 patients, seven factors provided a sensitive and specific prediction of risk for postoperative pulmonary complications.\n\n❖ Application of these data can stratify patients for risks in both research and clinical practice.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE pulmonary complications (PPCs) account for a substantial proportion of risk related to surgery and anesthesia and are a major cause of postoperative morbidity, mortality, and longer hospital stays.1,2In one systematic review of studies of noncardiac surgery, the incidence of PPCs was found to vary from 2 to 19%.3Identifying patients at risk is an important first step toward improving surgical care, yet research on PPCs to date has been subject to sampling bias. For example, two important studies of risk that analyzed data from the National Veterans Affairs Quality Improvement Program in order to derive indices for predicting risk of pneumonia4and respiratory failure5after noncardiac surgery included mostly male veterans. Systematic review has detected many studies with such bias-introducing limitations as small sample size; narrow selection of patients, comorbidities, and operations; and retrospective or nonblinded outcome assessment. In addition, PPC definitions have differed.2Nonetheless, despite the limitations of such studies, groups still seek to establish risk-mitigating guidelines; the most ambitious attempt to date to marshal current knowledge on this clinical problem is the American College of Physicians guidelines for preventing PPCs in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.2In this context, it is clear that it would be very useful to be able to predict the likelihood of PPCs from a reduced perioperative set of variables. Furthermore, an index would be most useful if applicable across a wide range of surgical settings.\n\nWe sought to reduce sampling bias by basing our analysis of risk factors on prospectively gathered data from a large population undergoing a broad range of surgical procedures. The population-based sample used was broadly representative of patients from a southern European territory that includes several large cities as well as rural areas. The participating hospitals were also representative of all levels of care. Our goals were to assess the incidence and characteristics of PPCs in this population and to build a scoring system with a reduced number of significant variables that would identify PPC risk in most clinical settings.\n\nFrom the set of questionnaire variables (see table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, https://links.lww.com/ALN/A646), we selected potential PPC predictors, according to the investigators' consensus on measurable preoperative variables or the results of previous studies.2,4,5,10Independent continuous variables (age, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo2], and duration of surgery) were previously grouped into categories based on the investigators' clinical understanding. The unadjusted association of all these variables was evaluated for categorical (chi-square test and Fisher exact test) variables. Bivariate odds ratios and 95% CI values were also estimated. To assess collinearity between categorical variables, the relationships between them was tested by the Cramer V test (between nominal variables) and Kendall tau (τ) β coefficient (between ordinal variables).\n\nBefore constructing the predictive logistic regression model, we randomly divided the sample into two parts: a development and a validation subsample. The development subsample (66.6% of patients) was used to construct the model and the validation subsample (33.3%) to confirm the model's discriminatory capability.\n\nThe logistic regression model was constructed using a backward stepwise selection procedure in which the presence of a PPC was the dependent variable. Independent predictors were entered into the model on the basis of the bivariate analysis (P < 0.05) and correlation coefficients between variables lower than 0.4. Potential predictors were sequentially removed if this exclusion did not result in a significant change in the log-likelihood ratio test. The cutoff for variable removal was set at a significance level of 0.05. We then calculated the adjusted odds ratios and the corresponding 95% CI values. The calibration of the logistic regression model was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. To avoid overfitting the data for the development sample, a bootstrap method was used to find the best subset of factors. One thousand computer-generated samples, each including 1,623 individuals (i.e. , study subsample less one patient), were derived from the development subsample by random selection with replacement. Within each bootstrap sample, the β coefficient was calculated using all selected independent variables. The reliability of predictor variables in the final regression model was estimated by the 80% CI of the β coefficient in the bootstrap samples. Reliable predictors were expected to be retained if the 80% CI of bootstrap samples indicated statistical significance (P < 0.05). The model's discriminative performance was assessed by the c-statistic.\n\nA simplified predictive risk score was then calculated by multiplying each logistic coefficient of regression (β) by 10 and rounding off its value. The simplified scores for development subsample cases were added together to produce an overall PPC risk score for each patient. To evaluate the ability of the model to predict increasing rates of PPC, we used that score and the minimum description length principle16to divide the subsample into three ranges reflecting low, medium, and high risk for PPC, each containing a similar number of patients with a PPC. Finally, to assess the discriminative performance of this risk score in both the development and validation subsamples, we used the c-statistic, which was also displayed graphically as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare postoperative LOS between patients with and without a PPC. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare postoperative LOS between groups according to the number of PPCs (0, 1, 2–3, or 4 or more). The Mantel-Haenszel test was used to analyze trend in mortality rates between groups formed according to the number of PPCs. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software package (IBM SPSS Statistics 18, Chicago, IL); this version includes algorithms for performing bootstrapping procedures.\n\nA total of 242 PPCs were recorded in 123 patients (5.0% of the 2,464 studied patients). Postoperative respiratory failure developed in 63 patients (2.6%), bronchospasm in 44 (1.8%), pleural effusion in 43 (1.7%), respiratory infection in 40 (1.6%), atelectasis in 35 (1.4%), aspiration pneumonitis in 9 (0.4%), and pneumothorax in 8 (0.3%).\n\nThe median postoperative LOS was longer in patients with at least one PPC (12 days; 10–90th percentile, 4–36.8 days) than in those without a PPC (3 days; 10–90th percentile, 1–11 days). Thirty-five patients died within 30 days; 24 of these patients had at least one PPC (19.5% of the 123 patients with a PPC; 95% CI, 12.5–26.5%) and 11 had no PPC (0.5% of the 2,341 with no PPC; 95% CI, 0.2–0.8%). At 90 days, mortality was 24.4% (95% CI, 16.8–32.0%) of the 123 patients with at least one PPC and 1.2% (95% CI, 0.8–1.6%) of the 2,341 without a PPC (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).\n\nThe highest PPC rate was after cardiac surgery (39.6%), followed by thoracic (31.4%), abdominal (7.2%), and vascular procedures (5.8%). In absolute terms, the largest contribution came from abdominal surgery. Table 3shows detailed information on the characteristics of PPCs, mortality, and postoperative ventilation management by specialties. Six of 1,336 patients who received general anesthesia required postoperative reintubation. Table 4shows postoperative LOS and mortality by number of PPCs. Both of these outcomes increased significantly as the number of PPCs increased.\n\nThe results for independent variables that were entered into the logistic regression model are shown in table 5, along with significant variables that were rejected because of high collinearity with other independent variables (smoking status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Alcohol intake, snoring, sleepiness, obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression, intraoperative fluid therapy, and postoperative pain were unrelated (P ≥ 0.05) to the presence of a PPC.\n\nMultivariable logistic regression selected nine independent predictors of PPC: age, male sex, low preoperative Spo2, acute respiratory infection during the month before surgery, preoperative anemia (hemoglobin concentration lower than 10 g/dl), positive cough test, upper abdominal or intrathoracic surgery, duration of procedure, and emergency surgery. Bootstrap validation (1,000 subsamples of 1,623 cases) indicated that 7 of those 9 independent predictors were present in more than 80% of bootstrap samples and thus were retained in the final model. The raw and adjusted odds ratios for the seven variables are shown in table 6, which also shows the simplified risk score derived from the β coefficient for each variable. This seven-variable regression model had good discrimination (c-statistic, 0.90) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.45) values. The ROC curves and the c-statistics for both the development and validation subsamples are presented in figure 2(for the model using β coefficients) and figure 3(for the model using the simplified risk score).\n\nTable 7shows the incidence of PPCs by risk score. The most relevant cut point was a simplified risk score of 26 (sensitivity 87.3% [95% CI, 77.7–94.0%], specificity 79.1% [95% CI, 77.0–81.1%]), which indicated moderate risk; a score greater than 45 indicated high risk (sensitivity 61.9% [95% CI, 49.7–73.2%], specificity 96.5% [95% CI: 95.5–97.4%]).\n\nPreoperative Spo2breathing room air in supine position was the strongest patient-related PPC risk factor. We consider this to be a highly useful finding because Spo2is an easily recorded objective measure. To our knowledge, this is the first time that preoperative Spo2has been tested as a predictor. We found a strong association between PPCs and respiratory disease (respiratory symptoms), smoking (lifetime exposure), and heart failure (table 5), consistent with previous studies.2However, these factors were not selected as independent predictors on multivariable analysis, probably because Spo2is a reflection of both respiratory and cardiovascular functional status.\n\nA history of respiratory infection in the month before surgery, with fever and antibiotic treatment, encompasses both upper and lower airway infections. Each may have a different effect on morbidity.18–20Recent respiratory infections can cause local changes in airway reactivity, pulmonary function, and residual impairment of immunity induced by the infection itself or by antibiotic use. An increased risk of intraoperative respiratory events after an upper respiratory tract infection can persist for 4–6 weeks in children, especially if the trachea is intubated.18,19The ease with which such a history can be obtained from the patient and its high clinical value in predicting risk according to our findings suggest that it should be included in preoperative assessment. It might even be cause for postponing nonemergency surgery in some cases.\n\nAge is a consistently reported predictor of PPCs,10,20and our findings confirm this. Furthermore, we found a clear deflection point (80 yr) at which the PPC rate increased markedly (odds ratio of 5.6 after this age). This observation is particularly relevant in Western countries where the population is aging and where surgery is being extended to patients who had formerly been excluded.\n\nPreoperative anemia (hemoglobin concentration lower than 10 g/dl) raised the risk for PPCs almost 3-fold, in agreement with recent studies identifying anemia as a predictor of poor outcome in critical and postoperative patients. Even minimal degrees of anemia are associated with a significant increase in the risk of 30-day postoperative mortality and cardiac events,22although so far, there is no clear evidence that preoperative transfusion would reduce risk.\n\nWe confirmed that surgery-related risk factors are highly relevant.2,5Those identified as independent predictors—namely anatomical site (upper abdomen or intrathoracic incisions), duration of surgery longer than 2 h, and emergency surgery—are factors that, to some extent, can be controlled by surgeons in patients at high risk.\n\nMany studies identify smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as risk factors for PPC.2However, in our study, both showed a high level of collinearity with other factors. Current smokers had the lowest PPC rate in our study, whereas former smokers had the highest (see table 5). The reason for this finding might be that current smokers were on average 17 yr younger than former smokers. Lifetime exposure to smoking was chosen to enter the analysis because exposure in excess of 40 pack-years was associated with higher risk in the bivariate analysis; nonetheless, the independence of this factor was not confirmed, so it was removed. With regard to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it is important to take into account that when this disease is mentioned in a patient's chart, it is often based on clinical criteria rather than a confirmed spirometric diagnosis.23For this reason, we considered that respiratory symptoms, which are easily recorded during the preanesthetic consultation by means of the Medical Research Council questionnaire,24would perhaps provide a better candidate for inclusion in the regression analysis. Furthermore, there is some suggestion in the literature that the larger the number of abnormal clinical findings present, the more severe the obstructive lung disease will probably be.25,26However, respiratory symptoms also failed to emerge as an independent factor on multivariable analysis.\n\nA strength of the current study was its prospective, population-based, multicenter design. We collected data for a representative random sample of surgical patients undergoing routine anesthetic procedures for each type of surgery during the course of a year and throughout an extensive geographic area that included rural, semirural, and urban populations with wide-ranging health and social status. We decided to include patients undergoing cardiac surgery because they make up a substantial part of the surgical caseload and have both procedure-related and other risk factors common to all surgical patients (see table 3). A recent study of a large general surgical population reported a mortality rate for cardiac surgery that was lower than the average for all surgical procedures,27suggesting that it need not be singled out as a special higher-risk setting a priori . We did exclude patients undergoing procedures of very low complexity, performed on an outpatient basis, or involving only peripheral or local anesthesia. We consider that by applying these inclusion and exclusion criteria, we accomplished our goal of taking an approach that would be relevant to the real world of anesthetics and surgery in which PPCs are a serious threat.\n\nA limitation of our study was that the sample size was not large enough to develop adequately a multivariable regression model in which 33 predictors were entered. For this reason, after performing the multivariable analysis, we resampled the development subsample using a bootstrapping technique. The purpose was to avoid overfitting and to estimate the stability of the dataset. As a result, seven of nine variables initially identified by multivariable regression were retained in the model. Only those seven variables were then used to build up the predictive index. Alternatively, based on the performance of the model in the validation subsample, it would also be possible to propose a parsimonious model with only three factors because such a reduced model would preserve much of the predictive power of the seven-factor model. In fact, the three most powerful variables (i.e. , Spo2, surgical incision, and duration of surgery) give an area under the ROC curve of more than 0.87. However, various other combinations of three risk factors would likewise give high c-statistics such that the clinical utility of one three-factor model would not be clearly greater than the utility of another one. We, therefore, chose to emphasize the clinical interest of the full range of seven relevant variables identified in the development subsample, given the ease with which information on all these factors can be obtained in most settings and because some of them can be preoperatively managed. The use of this seven-variable model also allowed us to stratify PPC risk on three levels (table 7).\n\nAnother possible limitation is our definition of PPC. A more stringent definition would probably have increased the impact of PPC on mortality and postoperative LOS. However, we chose to follow the approach of most PPC studies to date in which risk is established for a composite outcome,2one that can occur in the presence of any of several or all of a list of complications. We observed that removing individual PPCs from the composite did not have an appreciable effect on the prediction capacity. For example, if we were to remove bronchospasm from the composite outcome, the area under the ROC curve would change only slightly, from 0.90 to 0.89 in the development subsample. Furthermore, it is worth noting that even the appearance of a single PPC among those that comprise the composite was independently associated with increased LOS and mortality (table 4).\n\nA third potential limitation of the study was the participation of more than 200 recorders of data in 59 hospitals. However, we took measures to avoid inconsistencies and designed a questionnaire that addressed major medical conditions. We also conducted training sessions for the investigators and checked for and ruled out an effect of center. A fourth potential limitation was that in some centers, the observers were also the anesthesiologists in charge of patient care. We, therefore, included a quality assurance step in which medical records were checked by independent auditors to assure compliance with instructions. A fifth limitation was that the characteristics of nonresponders suggest that the PPC incidence may have been underestimated in patients who were older, who were smokers, or who underwent emergency surgery. The high response rate, however, means that the effect of this unavoidable methodological problem would be minimal.\n\nFinally, we must also be concerned about possible imprecision in the definition of some preexisting conditions, given that diagnoses were established from the medical records or patient interviews. We felt that, for the purpose of this study, the recorded clinical data would suffice in the interest of convenience. In relation to this limitation, there is a possible concern that we deliberately excluded laboratory or spirometric tests, although certain abnormalities have been associated with PPCs.2We did so because such tests (notably spirometry) would be difficult to undertake systematically in all clinical settings. In the example of spirometry, most of the patients this test would identify as high risk can be found preoperatively equally well by clinical evaluation of symptoms,23which are readily evaluated with the Medical Research Council respiratory questionnaire24we used.\n\nWe sought a clinically convenient, as well as statistically defensible, scoring system. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification is a patient-related factor that is consistently reported to be associated with PPCs.2We decided a priori to exclude it from the model so as not to mask other factors; furthermore, great variability in an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status assessment has been reported,28and we considered it preferable to include objective factors that might be more easily and confidently assessed by clinicians. In this regard, three of the variables included in the risk index we propose (Spo2, age, and hemoglobin concentration) are easily quantifiable and verifiable, and the three surgical risk factors can be anticipated. In some cases, the risk index may guide strategies to avoid or allay possible PPCs and to prompt the consideration of nonsurgical alternatives or the advisability of postponing surgery for some time. In selected high-risk patients, the preoperative quantification of surgical risk may be of help in explaining risk objectively to patients before scheduling and in encouraging adherence to measures to reduce risk for PPCs, such as preoperative respiratory physiotherapy, among others.29\n\nGiven the conspicuous importance of the duration of surgery and the location of the surgical incision in the development of PPCs, special attention should be given to modifying procedures, whenever possible, to shorten them and take tissue-sparing approaches.\n\nIn summary, our study identified seven straightforward, objective, and easily assessed factors associated with the appearance of PPCs. A simple risk score based on these factors predicted the development of PPCs in a broad and diverse surgical population sample and allowed us to stratify that sample by level of risk. To test the clinical value of the risk index, we propose to validate it in other geographic areas. Research could also consider the predictive power of preoperative Spo2and the advisability of postponing surgery if a recent respiratory infection is reported, as well as test the effect of treating preoperative anemia.\n\nThe authors thank Joan Garcia, M.Inf.
