        "text": "Nowadays, cyber attacks are becoming an extremely serious issue, which is particularly important to prevent in a smart city context. Among cyber attacks, spoofing is an action that is increasingly common in many areas, such as emails, geolocation services or social networks. Identity spoofing is defined as the action by which a person impersonates a third party to carry out a series of illegal activities such as committing fraud, cyberbullying, sextorsion, etc. In this work, a face recognition system is proposed, with an application to the spoofing prevention. The method is based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor. Since different face regions do not have the same information for the recognition process, introducing entropy would quantify the importance of each face region in the descriptor. Therefore, entropy is added to increase the robustness of the algorithm. Regarding face recognition, our approach has been tested on three well-known databases (ORL, FERET and LFW) and the experiments show that adding entropy information improves the recognition rate significantly, with an increase over 40% in some of the considered databases. Spoofing tests has been implemented on CASIA FASD and MIFS databases, having obtained again better results than similar texture descriptors approaches.\n\nFace detection is the first step of any automated face recognition system. One of the most popular approaches to detect faces in color images is using a skin color segmentation scheme, which in many cases needs a proper representation of color spaces to interpret image information. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy system for detecting skin in color images, so that each color tone is assumed to be a fuzzy set. RGB, HSV and YCbCr color systems are used for the development of our fuzzy design. Thus, a fuzzy 3-partition entropy approach is used to calculate all the parameters needed for the fuzzy systems and, then, a face detection method is also developed to validate the segmentation results. The results of the experiments show a correct skin detection rate between 94--96% for our fuzzy segmentation methods, with a false positive rate about 0.5% in all cases. Furthermore, the average correct face detection rate is above 93%, and even when working with heterogeneous backgrounds and different light conditions, it achieves almost 88% correct detections. Thus, our method leads to accurate face detection results with low false positive and false negative rates.\n\nNowadays, swarm robotics research is having a great increase due to the benefits derived from its use, such as robustness, parallelism, and flexibility. Unlike distributed robotic systems, swarm robotics emphasizes a large number of robots, and promotes scalability. Among the multiple applications of such systems we could find are exploring unstructured environments, resource monitoring, or distributed sensing. Two of these applications, monitoring, and perimeter/area detection of a given resource, have several ecological uses. One of them is the detection and monitoring of pollutants to delimit their perimeter and area accurately. Maritime activity has been increasing gradually in recent years. Many ships carry products such as oil that can adversely affect the environment. Such products can produce high levels of pollution in case of being spilled into sea. In this paper we will present a distributed system which monitors, covers, and surrounds a resource by using a swarm of homogeneous low cost drones. These drones only use their local sensory information and do not require any direct communication between them. Taking into account the properties of this kind of oil spills we will present a microscopic model for a swarm of drones, capable of monitoring these spills properly. Furthermore, we will analyse the proper macroscopic operation of the swarm. The analytical and experimental results presented here show the proper evolution of our system.\n\nPurpose In this paper the authors aim to show the advantages of using the decomposition method introduced by Adomian to solve Emden's equation, a classical non‐linear equation that appears in the study of the thermal behaviour of a spherical cloud and of the gravitational potential of a polytropic fluid at hydrostatic equilibrium. Design/methodology/approach In their work, the authors first review Emden's equation and its possible solutions using the Frobenius and power series methods; then, Adomian polynomials are introduced. Afterwards, Emden's equation is solved using Adomian's decomposition method and, finally, they conclude with a comparison of the solution given by Adomian's method with the solution obtained by the other methods, for certain cases where the exact solution is known. Findings Solving Emden's equation for n in the interval [0, 5] is very interesting for several scientific applications, such as astronomy. However, the exact solution is known only for n=0, n=1 and n=5. The experiments show that Adomian's method achieves an approximate solution which overlaps with the exact solution when n=0, and that coincides with the Taylor expansion of the exact solutions for n=1 and n=5. As a result, the authors obtained quite satisfactory results from their proposal. Originality/value The main classical methods for obtaining approximate solutions of Emden's equation have serious computational drawbacks. The authors make a new, efficient numerical implementation for solving this equation, constructing iteratively the Adomian polynomials, which leads to a solution of Emden's equation that extends the range of variation of parameter n compared to the solutions given by both the Frobenius and the power series methods.\n\nSegmentation of images represents the first step in many of the tasks that pattern recognition or computer vision has to deal with. Therefore, the main goal of our paper is to describe a new method for image segmentation, taking into account some Mathematical Morphology operations and an adaptively updated threshold, what we call Morphological Gradient Threshold, to obtain the optimal segmentation. The key factor in our work is the calculation of the distance between the segmented image and the ideal segmentation. Experimental results show that the optimal threshold is obtained when the Morphological Gradient Threshold is around the 70% of the maximum value of the gradient. This threshold could be computed, for any new image captured by the vision system, using a properly designed binary metrics.\n\nSegmentation is an essential part of practically anyautomated image recognition system, since it is necessary for further processing such as feature extraction or object recognition. There exist a variety of techniques for threshold selection, as it is a fast and robust method. Threshold value will have considerable effects on the boundary position and overall size of the extracted objects. In this work, we propose an automated thresholding selection, which considers the local properties of a pixel. To do this, the algorithm calculates the morphological gradient and Laplacian and, afterwards, chooses a suitable threshold after estimating the lowest distance between the ideal segmentation and the morphological gradient thresholding segmentation. As an application of this segmentation process, we have implemented a path planning algorithm for a vision-based system. The experiments show that our path planning algorithm is able to find good solution paths after a training process.\n\nSegmentation is an essential part of practically any automated image recognition system, since it is necessary for further processing such as feature extraction or object recognition.
