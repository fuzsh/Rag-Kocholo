The United States embassy in Jakarta has strongly denied that its ambassador, Robert Gelbard, tried to influence the selection of the chief of the Indonesian army.

Recent reports in the media had quoted the Indonesian defence minister, Mahfud MD, as saying that Mr Gelbard had pressed Jakarta to pick Lieutenant General Agus Wirahadikusumah as the new army chief.

A statement issued by the American embassy said it was deeply concerned by such false statements emananting from the defence ministry and elsewhere.

It called them astonishing and irresponsible. President Abdurrahman Wahid appointed Endriartono Sutartoa as the new army chief last week.
