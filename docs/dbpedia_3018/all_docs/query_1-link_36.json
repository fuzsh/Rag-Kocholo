Can anyone win?\n\nBy WARREN CARAGATA Jakarta\n\nALSO:\n\n 'I Have to Continue': As president, says Wahid, to prevent chaos\n\nBy most standards of civilized behavior, the East Timor militias, now ensconced in neighboring Indonesian West Timor after their violent rampage a year ago, would be considered thugs, bandits and murderers. So it was not surprising, after being ordered by the Indonesian government to turn in their weapons, that these thugs, bandits and murderers wanted them back. In a ceremony on Sunday, Sept. 24, in the West Timor town of Atambua attended by Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri and senior military officials, handmade weapons, along with some assault rifles and grenades, were dutifully surrendered. But when Megawati and the official party left, the militia members returned. In full view of Indonesian security, they started to re-take their weapons, in the process threatening U.N. observers from East Timor, who were forced to flee under armed escort back across the border. Adding insult to injury was that this latest disturbance took place in the very same town where three U.N. humanitarian workers were slaughtered a few weeks earlier by militiamen. Said Sergio Vieira de Mello, head of the U.N. administration in East Timor: \"What happened [Sunday] was pretty pathetic.\"\n\nIndonesia has come under severe international pressure to disarm the militias and break the long-established link between them and its military. The international community has warned Indonesia that failure to act quickly could affect much-needed financial support. But Jakarta's difficulty in enforcing its will in West Timor illustrates a wider dilemma for President Abdurrahman Wahid. Can his year-old administration establish firm civilian control over the armed forces? Wahid says it can  eventually. But the president admitted in an Asiaweek interview, he is not yet in full control (see page 31). \"Many military generals, colonels and lieutenant-colonels do their own thing,\" he says.\n\nRogue elements of the military and of the intelligence services are being blamed not just for a laissez-faire attitude toward the militias but for recent bombings in Jakarta, including the August blast at the Jakarta Stock Exchange tower which killed 15 people. The stock exchange device as well as an earlier explosion that injured the Philippine ambassador and a bomb at the attorney-general's office all used similar military-grade explosives. The conclusion is clear, according to many observers, Indonesian and foreign. Says Richard Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador to the U.N.: \"We must face facts. Elements within the Indonesian military are directly or indirectly responsible for these outrages.\" The military is also being tagged for provoking violence in Aceh and participating in bloody communal strife in the Malukus. It's quite a list, but where are the orders coming from, if not from its commanders, as the military insists? Wahid says the answer is clear: \"After a period of more than 30 years under Mr. Suharto, it is understandable that he tries to, or his followers try to, derail the current government.\"\n\nThe government has not been able to prove that ex-president Suharto or his people are responsible for the bombings or other violence. Wahid says he fired his national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, for failing to obey his order to arrest Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, whom he had accused of being the mastermind of the stock exchange attack. But the new police chief, Gen. Suryo Bimantoro, has also not been able to move against Tommy, who earlier voluntarily presented himself for questioning and was then released for what the police said was a lack of evidence. (On Sept. 26, however, Tommy was sentenced to 18 months' jail on corruption charges.)\n\nYet recent arrests for the West Timor U.N. murders and for the stock exchange explosion certainly do suggest at least some military role. Police have hauled in members of local army units for the Atambua killings, and Jakarta authorities have detained 30 people for the bombing, including members of the military's special forces and strategic reserve. But no one, not even Wahid, is suggesting that the military as an institution is behind any attempt to unseat the government. University of Indonesia political scientist Salim Said says the armed forces have become so demoralized post-Suharto that they could not operate as a unified organization even if they wanted to. \"They are devastated, almost paralysed,\" he says. But Salim acknowledges that the chain of command is not working, which means officers and soldiers can go off and act on their own.\n\nThe pace of military reform, moreover, has slackened. One indicator is the agreement by political parties to maintain military representation in the People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest policy-making body, until 2009, backing away from earlier commitments to abolish reserved seats for the military by 2004. Another sign is the fate of reformer Lt.-Gen. Agus Wirahadikusumah. Under pressure from old-guard generals, Agus was dumped from his powerful position as head of the strategic command even though the appointment was made by Wahid himself. While the government has replaced many military officials, most second-echelon commanders and those in charge of the intelligence services, used by Suharto as secret police, retain loyalties to their old boss and to his onetime adjutant, former armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto.\n\nSince the military is deeply factionalized, Wahid does have some room to maneuver. \"The obvious schism is between the Wiranto clan and Agus and his followers,\" says military expert M.T. Arifin. Last week Wahid abolished the post of deputy commander, dismissing Gen. Fachrul Razi, a Wiranto loyalist. The military took the change in stride but Wahid was diplomatic in stressing that he was eliminating just a position, and not a particular general. A reshuffle of senior ranks rumoured for October could give a clearer picture of whether Wahid will eventually succeed in taming and reforming the military.\n\nMeantime, the military's relationship with the Timor militias is becoming a touchstone of whether the government is capable of enforcing its will on the armed forces. Under international pressure, both the government and the military say the process of disarmament in West Timor will continue. If the militias do not hand in all their weapons. they will be taken by force, the government says. But the message that the military must break its ties to the militias is obviously not getting through loud enough. A senior commander has been quoted as saying that the army is now recruiting ex-militia fighters. \"This process should be seen as a normal procedure that has taken place in the past,\" says Lt.-Gen. Agus Widjojo, chief of territorial affairs. That's precisely the problem. Wahid's tug-of-war with the military will end, and Indonesia's international reputation will be restored, only when what used to be normal for Jakarta's soldiers moves beyond the pale.\n\nWith additional reporting by Dewi Loveard/Jakarta\n\nBack to the top\n\nWrite to Asiaweek at mail@web.asiaweek.com\n\nThis edition's table of contents | Asiaweek.com Home\n\nQuick Scroll: More stories from Asiaweek, TIME and CNN\n\nLATEST HEADLINES:\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nU.S. secretary of state says China should be 'tolerant'\n\nMANILA\n\nPhilippine government denies Estrada's claim to presidency\n\nALLAHABAD\n\nFaith, madness, magic mix at sacred Hindu festival\n\nCOLOMBO\n\nLand mine explosion kills 11 Sri Lankan soldiers\n\nTOKYO\n\nJapan claims StarLink found in U.S. corn sample\n\nBANGKOK\n\nThai party announces first coalition partner\n\nTIME:\n\nCOVER: President Joseph Estrada gives in to the chanting crowds on the streets of Manila and agrees to make room for his Vice President\n\nTHAILAND: Twin teenage warriors turn themselves in to Bangkok officials\n\nCHINA: Despite official vilification, hip Chinese dig Lamaist culture\n\nPHOTO ESSAY: Estrada Calls Snap Election\n\nWEB-ONLY INTERVIEW: Jimmy Lai on feeling lucky -- and why he's committed to the island state\n\nASIAWEEK:\n\nCOVER: The DoCoMo generation - Japan's leading mobile phone company goes global\n\nBandwidth Boom: Racing to wire - how underseas cable systems may yet fall short\n\nTAIWAN: Party intrigues add to Chen Shui-bian's woes\n\nJAPAN: Japan's ruling party crushes a rebel ì at a cost\n\nSINGAPORE: Singaporeans need to have more babies.
