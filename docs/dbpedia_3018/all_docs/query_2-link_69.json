The highest award was given as a form of appreciation for Astra Agro’s contribution to the field of education, research, and technology development in the Agribusiness sector.\n\n“Astra Agro continuously encourages young researchers to play an active role in creating innovations because we strongly believe that they are valuable assets in achieving our mission of Prospering Together with the Nation,” said Astra Agro’s Commercial Director, Djap Tet Fa when receiving the award during the Open Session of the 104th Anniversary of Indonesian Technical Higher Education (PTTI) at the West Hall, ITB Ganesha Campus, Wednesday (3/7/2024).\n\nDjap Tet Fa further revealed that this award is a motivation for companies that have consistently developed research and sustainable governance to make a positive contribution to the progress of the nation. Astra Agro has established a track record with the School of Life Sciences and Technology (SITH) ITB for more than 30 years, through cooperation in research and community service in ecology, genetics, plant physiology/development, and integrated pest control.\n\nTogether with academic fellows such as Dr. Adi Pancoro, Prof. Agus Dana Permana, Dr. Ramadhani Eka Putra, and Prof. Pingkan Aditiawati, Astra Agro encourages scientific publications and innovations that not only increase palm oil production but also contribute to the development of related science. Through Astra Agro’s infrastructure, SITH can develop sustainable bioindustry from upstream to downstream. In addition, the two institutions have also pioneered new cooperation in the field of bioengineering development and supporting research from laboratory scale to semi-industrial scale.\n\nResearch and development is one of Astra Agro’s consistent efforts in realising its mission to contribute to the development and welfare of the nation by integrating sustainability aspects in the company’s strategy through Astra Agro Sustainability Aspirations, which consists of the Triple-P Roadmap Strategy namely Portfolio, People, and Public Contribution which includes four pillars namely health, environment, education and economy.\n\nIn addition to the 104th Anniversary of PTTI, there are five award categories namely Ganesa Prajamanggala Bakti Adiutama, Ganesa Widya Jasa Adiutama, Ganesa Widya Jasa Utama, Ganesa Wirya Jasa Utama and Ganesa Widya Jasa. In the remarks of the Rector of ITB, Professor Reini Wirahadikusuma revealed that 12 awards were given to academics and stakeholders involved in research and development of science that provides benefits in responding to global, national and local problems in fields such as energy transition, climate change adaptation, digital transformation, green economy, food security, water security, health, and economic recovery after COVID-19.\n\n“I firmly believe that technical higher education institutions will play an increasingly important role, both in realizing the vision of a Golden Indonesia, as well as in responding to increasingly dynamic global problems. For this, the togetherness and contribution of various parties, ranging from government institutions, actors in the economic sector, and society in general,” said Reini.\n\nSource: Mercusuar.web"
