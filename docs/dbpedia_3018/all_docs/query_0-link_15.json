        "text": "Military authorities in Indonesia have announced the third reshuffle of top posts in the past few months, including the replacement of the man who commands an elite army corps, Lieutenant General Agus Wirahadikusumah.\n\nHe's considered a reformer and supporter of the President, Abdurrahman Wahid, and had been heading the unit , Kostrad, since March.\n\nThe official news agency Antara said the general believes he was replaced because he had uncovered corruption in the unit. His replacement is Major General Ryamizard Ryacudu, who currently heads Jakarta's military command. The reshuffle included several generals and was announced by an armed forces spokesman , Major General Graito Usodo, who says the changes will help meet organisational needs."
