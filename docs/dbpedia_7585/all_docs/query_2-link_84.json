        "text": "In general climate of Switzerland may be considered as temperate. Yet weather conditions of different parts of country vary due to variety of relief. Relatively flat north-western and central regions are under influence of Atlantics. East have alpine climate and habitats of southern parts are enjoying mild subtropical weather.\n\nSignificant portion of Swiss lands is covered with mountains. Naturally altitude affects weather. Average humidity levels are growing while temperature drops depending on altitude. Vast areas of Alpine Tundra are outlined with thin subarctic zones and dotted by rare ice-caps.\n\nSo Swiss winter appears to be pretty cold and snowy while summer is warm and rainy. Given that choosing most suitable season completely depends on type of planned activities such as skiing, sightseeing, eco-tourism and so on.\n\nSeasons\n\nContents:\n\nSpring\n\nSummer\n\nAutumn\n\nWinter\n\nSpring in Switzerland\n\nOn plains of Switzerland spring starts with growing of average daily temperature up to 9°C (48°F).

Average temperature of northern plains is between -1 and -4°C (30-25°F), central – about 0°C (32°F) and in warmest southern regions about 4°C (39°F).\n\nAlmost all country is covered with snow. Of course highlands are snowier than plains. Amount of precipitations much higher as much as a risk of avalanches.

So its better to choose higher resorts to have sunny days on vacation.\n\nClimate of the Winter Months\n\nDecember\n\nMax average t°: +4 °C (39 °F)\n\nMin average t°: -2 °C (29 °F)\n\nSundial in the day: 5 hours\n\nSnowy days: 5 days\n\nPrecipitation: 70 mm (2.8\")\n\nJanuary\n\nMax average t°: +3 °C (37 °F)\n\nMin average t°: -3 °C (27 °F)\n\nSundial in the day: 5 hours\n\nSnowy days: 6 days\n\nPrecipitation: 68 mm (2.7\")\n\nFebruary\n\nMax average t°:+5 °C (40 °F)\n\nMin average t°: -2 °C (29 °F)\n\nSundial in the day: 6 hours\n\nSnowy days: 4 days\n\nPrecipitation: 46 mm (1.8\")\n\n(Berne)\n\nWinter Holidays\n\n6 December – St. Nicholas’s Day.\n\n8 December - Immaculate Conception.\n\n12 December – National Flag’s Day.\n\n25 December – Catholic Christmas.\n\n26 December - St Stephen's Day.\n\n1 January – New Year.\n\n2 January - St. Berchtold’s Day.\n\n12 January –St. Moritz Gourmet Festival"
