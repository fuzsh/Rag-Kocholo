        "text": "Taking The Train For A Short Stop In Zurich Switzerland\n\nOn our trip through Central Europe, we headed for a short stop in Zurich after Austria.\n\nOur time in Salzburg Austria just flew by. While we were there for 3 nights, we really only had 2 days since we boarded an early train to Zurich.\n\nAt almost 6 hours, it was our longest train ride as we hopped from our stay in Budapest to Austria to Switzerland and then to to our final stop in Milan Italy. We packed the night before and had an early breakfast. It was a short cab ride to the train station. So we had time to relax in the business lounge before our train arrived.\n\nIt was grey and rainy for the whole trip to Zurich. But we went through some idyllic mountain scenery. When we went through Innsbruck we saw the Olympic facilities on the hills.\n\nMountains towered over the tracks. Long tunnels cut through the mountains. And the train moved fast (at almost 200kph at one point). It was great eye candy even without bright sun.\n\nWhen the tracks flattened out and a large lake appeared beside the train, we knew we were close.\n\nWalking In Old Town Zurich\n\nOne day we explored the city on our short stop in Zurich. We hoped for a sunny day but the weather turned. Skies were grey and almost every day it rained. Most days there were late day thunderstorms. We talked to a guy at lunch one day and wondered about visiting in the winter when the sky was winter crisp. He quickly stated that Zurich in the winter was often grey as well. We guessed that was the issue in low ground in a country filled with mountains.\n\nWe took the tram into the downtown area and walked around. The Opera House was a beautiful building on the river. We found the first of many statues as we wandered the pedestrian streets in this area.\n\nOur next stop was the Grossmunster Church with its twin towers and interesting door. We saw these twin towers everywhere when we walked in the Old Town area. In the courtyard in front of the church there was a model of the church.\n\nEverywhere we looked we saw interesting buildings and clock towers. We were in Switzerland after all! We even found interesting clocks as building decorations.\n\nThere was much to see as we walked on a short stop in Zurich.\n\nHeading Along The Water\n\nThe Limmat River ran from Lake Zurich through the city. Several different bridges crossed the river. Ferry boats ran to different stops on the water.\n\nWe crossed into the Old Town and wandered the streets. We headed uphill to the Lindenhof viewpoint. This spot housed a Roman fort and then a large walled in palace in the time of Charlemagne. We found a large tranquil park with great panoramic views along the river banks.\n\nWe were glad we headed along the water when we made a short stop in Zurich. The Lindenhof park was the perfect spot for reflection and great views.\n\nTasty Stops On A Short Stop In Zurich\n\nWe looked for lunch but were distracted by shops that sold sweet treats. The Honold Tea Room drew us to its window with its colourful and delicious looking treats. We pinned this spot for a return visit.\n\nOf course we found the Laderach Chocolate shop. This was the shop that had been recommended to us for the best Swiss chocolate. There was certainly a wide selection of chocolate. Most of the Swiss chocolate was milk chocolate so we found ourselves a little less tempted than we might be. But that didn’t stop us from adding yet more chocolate to our bags.\n\nEven on a short stop in Zurich you will be tempted by chocolate and sweets!\n\nVisit The Small Town Of Schaffhausen\n\nDuring our stay in Zurich, we watched the weather forecast. When it looked like we would have a sunny day, we planned a trip out of town. It was an easy train trip to the small town of Schaffhausen. As we walked the town streets, we found so many delightful and colourful buildings.\n\nThe Munot Fortress stood high above the town. We couldn’t resist walking up the 350 or more stairs for the best views around!\n\nOn a short stay in Zurich, we were delighted we planned a day trip and visited Schaffhausen.\n\nDon’t Miss the Rhine Falls\n\nOn our day trip to Schaffhausen, we made one more stop. The Rhine Falls were the biggest falls in Europe. We got our first view of the falls from above.\n\nWhen we headed down to the water level, we walked around and got various different views of the waterfall cascading down. A walk up the stairs beside the falls gave us another perspective.\n\nWe made sure and planned a trip to see the Rhine Falls on our short stop in Zurich.\n\nPlan A Short Stop In Zurich\n\nThe weather was not our friend on our short stop in Zurich. Our visit to Switzerland was in the last 2 weeks of a 6 week trip to Central Europe. The weather had been perfect for our first 4 weeks. So we were less inclined to head out into the rain at this point on our trip.\n\nBut as soon as the weather broke for a few hours, we headed out and saw the Old Town of Zurich. There were many sights to see in the city. And on a sunny day, we headed for the country and saw the charming town of Schaffhausen and the Rhine Falls.\n\nWe had other day trip options for our short visit in Zurich. On the train trip from our stay in Salzburg, we passed through the tiny country of Liechtenstein. We wanted to go back for a day trip and get our passports stamped. It reminded us very much of the time that we visited the small country of San Marino in the middle of Italy! We also wanted to do a day trip to Lucerne.\n\nBut the weather beat us on this trip. Switzerland was a pretty small country and easily accessible by train. We hoped to visit Lucerne from our next stop in Bern.\n\nHave you done a short stop in Zurich? What did you see in the city? What day trips did you take?\n\nSave For Later – PIN to Pinterest:"
