So, let's dig into it.\n\nWhere Should I go: Zurich or Saint John's?\n\nZurich\n\nZurich has the biggest connection for trains in Switzerland. It also has the country's biggest and busiest airport. Because of its importance as a transportation center, it is likely to be the first place you visit in Switzerland.

It has many international companies, and is home to the country's stock exchange.\n\nSaint John's\n\nIf you've been to St. John's, Antigua, you were likely on a cruise - which means you likely did not have enough time to truly experience the magic of this tiny island getaway.\n\nSt. Johns is the capital of the tiny islands of Antigua and Barbuda. Located on Antigua, this tropical city lives up to its status as a tropical paradise. With 365 beaches on the island, you can enjoy the luxury of lounging in the sand every day of the year.\n\nFor some great organized tour ideas, see The Best Sightseeing Tours in Switzerland, and The Best Romantic Tours for Couples in Switzerland.\n\nWhich place is cheaper, Saint John's or Zurich?\n\nThese are the overall average travel costs for the two destinations.\n\nAverage Daily Cost Per person, per day\n\nZurich $283\n\nSaint John's $222\n\nThe average daily cost (per person) in Zurich is $283, while the average daily cost in Saint John's is $222.
