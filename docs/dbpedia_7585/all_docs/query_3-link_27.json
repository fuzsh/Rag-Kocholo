        "text": "Built along the Limmat River, Z√ºrich is the biggest city in Switzerland, even bigger than Geneva and Bern, the capital! If you are looking for the best things to do in Zurich, keep reading and I‚Äôll tell you everything you need to know!\n\nIn this Z√ºrich travel guide, I am going to explain all the best spots to check out inside and outside of the city! Zurich is such an amazing place where you can find great things to do and amazing places to visit such as churches, gorgeous medieval streets and the cutest caf√©s.\n\nWithout further ado, let‚Äôs learn about all the Z√ºrich top attractions! And by the way, there‚Äôs a whole section dedicated to museums!\n\nNOTE: At the moment this post is being written, the exchange rate between CHF and USD is CHF 1 for USD 1.01, and between CHF and EUR is CHF 1 for EUR 0.9, which is why I haven‚Äôt changed the prices and quantities shown in this post as they are pretty much the same as American dollars and very similar to the Euro! üòâ\n\nLet‚Äôs get right into this Z√ºrich guide! On-y va!\n\n1. Discover the Old Town (Altstadt)\n\nZ√ºrich Old Town (Altstadt) is located on both banks of the Limmat River and it‚Äôs what is now considered District 1. The Old Town is home to the majority of the most beautiful sights in the city such as the town hall, different universities, beautiful little alleyways and cozy restaurants and caf√©s!\n\nEven though it‚Äôs quite a small area, the best way to explore it and to never miss a detail would be by booking a tour. Just like in every city that is worth traveling to, Z√ºrich has a fair share of tours that run through its loveliest streets.\n\nHere are my recommendations:\n\nThere is a free 1.5-hour walking tour of the old town. It leaves every day at 11 a.m. to the greatest spots in Altstadt. You can take a free tour in English, Spanish or German, and don‚Äôt forget to leave a tip at the end if you liked the guide and the quality of the tour! I took this particular tour and, even though I would not say I learned a lot about the history of the city, I was definitely entertained by the guide who told us some stories about the lives of the locals!\n\nIf 2 hours seem like too little time, you can opt for this 4-hour extended city tour that will even take you on an aerial cable car ride up to Felsenegg to check out the city and the Alps views.\n\nAlternatively, if you want a private tour, I can recommend this Zurich 101 tour ‚Äì you‚Äôll have the guide all to yourself and you‚Äôll have the chance to ask all the questions you want!\n\nPRICE: US $60 for an extended city tour\n\n2. Climb the towers of Grossm√ºnster\n\nThis Romanesque Protestant church is part of the Evangelical Reformed Church and it was built at the beginning of the 12th century.\n\nDid you know there are lots of legends that surround this church? For instance,\n\nOne legend says that when Felix and Ragula (the two patron saints of Z√ºrich) were beheaded here, they picked up their heads and started walking 40 steps uphill until they fell to their deaths.\n\nThey were buried in that exact spot. Some centuries later, the Roman Emperor Charlemagne‚Äôs horse fell to its knees at the same spot where they were buried and he decided to build Grossmunster there.\n\nThe twin towers are one of the most recognizable Z√ºrich attractions and I definitely recommend going up them; you‚Äôll get an amazing view of Z√ºrich from up there!\n\nFUN FACT: The towers are the reason this church is known as ‚ÄúSalt & Pepper‚Äù, because their shape looks like two salt and pepper shakers!\n\nPRICE: CHF 5 to go up the towers\n\n3. Walk along Bahnhofstrasse\n\nYou can‚Äôt leave Switzerland without doing some window shopping along Bahnhofstrasse, one of the most expensive streets in the world!\n\nIt‚Äôs funny how, just 150 years ago, this street used to be the city moat and now you can find most designer brand shops, watch stores and even the Swiss Banking Center there!\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about watchmaking, I recommend you check out Beyer Clock and Watch Museum (entrance is CHF 10). Right after that, you can enjoy a hot chocolate at Caf√© Spr√ºngli, an iconic coffee house and confiserie in the city!\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n4. Try some delicious cheese fondue\n\nIf you have never eaten fondue before, you NEED to try it while you‚Äôre in Z√ºrich!\n\nI‚Äôm somehow jealous of you because you will get to try fondue for the first time, and in the country where it was created! (though, most French people will argue with that!)\n\nFondue consists of a pot full of melted cheese that you can dip bread, any type of veggies and even apples into! I know how hard it is sometimes to find traditional vegetarian meals in central Europe, but this is one of them!\n\nHowever fondues in Z√ºrich are not only about the dish itself but also about the experience! You get to share it with your friends, which makes it extra romantic and fun! But remember, double dipping is not allowed! üòâ\n\nThere are plenty of places in Z√ºrich where you can try fondue for an average of CHF 30, but if you want to make the most of your experience, I recommend you book this Fondue and wine Tuk Tuk tour where you‚Äôll get to explore the most beautiful Z√ºrich landmarks in a tuk tuk with a stop for fondue and wine. So fun!\n\nPRICE: US $132 (2 person minimum to book it)\n\n5. Stroll around Viadukt\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to visit the new Z√ºrich you have to head to West Z√ºrich, and specifically to Viadukt. This is a hipster area of the city where you‚Äôll find alternative designer shops and a market hall. It‚Äôs one of the favorite places among locals and tourists alike, such a unique and creative space!\n\nLocated under the old railway viaduct (hence the name), Viadukt is perfect for those looking for unique fashion pieces or even to buy groceries!\n\nI want there by bicycle and it was a lovely 15-minute ride along the river (hint ‚Äì continue reading for a lifehack on how to rent a bicycle for free in Zurich!).\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n6. Take a cruise on a Limmatschifffahrt boat\n\nTo see Z√ºrich from another perspective, you can hop on a Limmat River cruise, which is commonly known as (unfortunately for us non-German speakers) Limmatschifffahrt! This boat ride is really quite affordable and a great way to explore the city from the water!\n\nDon‚Äôt let the name deter you from having some fun while trying to make yourself understood by the locals! I recommend you head on this tour that takes you near the best and most beautiful landmarks in Z√ºrich such as Grossmunster or Fraumunster, with a final stop on Lake Z√ºrich.\n\nNOTE: Only available from April to October and you can check out the boat timetable here\n\nPRICE: CHF 4.40\n\nPRO TIP: It can get crowded at the Landesmuseum station, the spot where the boat begins its one-hour round trip. I recommend you check this website in advance for departure times. Make sure to arrive a bit early as well!\n\n7. Check out Fraum√ºnster Church\n\nTogether with Grossmunster, Fraumunster Church is one of the most important churches in the city of Z√ºrich!\n\nJust on the other side of the river from Grossmunster, this church was built on the remains of a former women‚Äôs abbey, hence the name, which translates to ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Minister‚Äù. It is definitely a must-see during your Z√ºrich trip!\n\nMake sure you admire the inside frescoes, the organ or even the stained glass windows (created by Marc Chagall!); they all give the church a very special and unique atmosphere.\n\nPRICE: Entry to the church is CHF 5 (free audio guide included)\n\nPRO TIP: Your Fraum√ºnster ticket gives you a discount of CHF 5 on your ticket to Kunsthaus (full of works by Marc Chagall). More info about this museum in the special section below.\n\n8. Chill at Flussbad Oberer Letten\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt packed yet and you are going to Z√ºrich during the summer months, make sure to bring a swimsuit with you as well!\n\nNo, I haven‚Äôt gone mad! Flussbad Oberer Letten is an awesome place located by the Limmat River where you can chill, sunbathe and even swim! The facility is so well prepared for this that they even have changing rooms!\n\nIt is not the only place in Zurich to swim (I talk about the others in ‚ÄúBonus 4: Things to do in Zurich with kids‚Äù, down below!).\n\nI visited in late September and the weather was absolutely lovely; the whole city seemed to have been out there swimming, getting a tan, playing beach volleyball, sipping on a drink and just chilling!\n\nThe atmosphere was FANTASTIC, I instantly wanted to move there!\n\nBut I guess I first should come again to visit in, say, November, to see if the vibe is the same. üôÇ\n\nAt any rate, I don‚Äôt know many big cities that have a river that‚Äôs clean enough for you to swim in, but Zurich does! And the best part? The swimming area is right by the main train station, so central that you can chill in the morning and do some touring around the city in the afternoon. How cool is that?\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n9. Explore Niederdorf neighborhood\n\nOne of the coolest Z√ºrich neighborhoods (along with Z√ºrich West) is Niederdorf! Located in District 1 (Old Town) and known as D√∂rfli by the locals, this is an almost entirely car-free neighborhood! Oh, and by the way, this artsy and trendy neighborhood is also one of the most affordable ones!\n\nDuring the day, Niederdorf is a great place to relax and enjoy a book in a coffee shop while enjoying the slow pace of the city. But at night it becomes a lively area to hang out with your friends, and best of all, it‚Äôs suitable for all budgets and types of travelers!\n\nPRO TIP: Dorflifascht is a festival held in Niederdorf at the end of August where you can enjoy street food, shopping stalls, live music and shows! You can check out the future dates here.\n\n10. Take a cable car to Felsenegg Lookout to see the view of the city\n\nIf you want to see Zurich from above like never before, Felsenegg is the place to be! It‚Äôs located at an altitude of over 800 meters over the city, so it makes for the best lookout to admire the view of Z√ºrich, the landscape surrounding it and the faraway mountains.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE: To get to Felsenegg, you need to take the train from the Z√ºrich main station to Adliswil (15 minutes). Once there, you get off and walk for 10 minutes following the signs towards the cable car. The cable car runs every 15 minutes and the ride takes just 5 minutes.\n\nPRICE: Cable car ticket is CHF 4.40\n\nNOTE: Once at the top, there‚Äôs a hiking trail to Uetliberg that takes less than 2 hours. I will be talking about it in detail right below!\n\n11. Admire St. Peter‚Äôs Church\n\nLast but not least of my church recommendations in the city: St Peter‚Äôs Church, the oldest parish church in Z√ºrich, built around the 10th century!\n\nThe church was used as a fire watch post up until the early 1900‚Äôs and it has Europe‚Äôs biggest clock with a diameter of 8.7 meters! It also has five bells dating from 1880 in the tower. Can you guess how much the largest of them weighs? Over six tons without its clapper!\n\nApart from being a beautiful landmark, it is quite useful as you won‚Äôt even need to take out your own watch/phone to check the time because it is visible from many spots in the city!\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n12. Explore Lindenhof District\n\nLindenhof District is an area located within Altstadt (the Old Town) where you will find a hill and a public square. It used to be a Roman settlement; now, it‚Äôs a place where people gather to play a gigantic chess game, do some people watching or just relax. It is really a place not to miss in Z√ºrich, so central that you really have no excuse not to go!\n\nGet your camera, don‚Äôt let the 187 steps bring you down and get up to the top of the hill so you can enjoy the wonderful view!\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n13. Promenade along Lake Z√ºrich\n\nThere is no way someone goes to Z√ºrich without visiting the gorgeous Lake Z√ºrich!\n\nOne of my favorite spots in the city, this place is perfect for a morning run or a romantic evening stroll.\n\nYou can, of course, go there by yourself and enjoy some relaxation, but if you only have a short time in the city and you‚Äôd like to roam around the lake, I have a solution!\n\nI found this 4-hour Zurich city tour that includes a cruise on Lake Z√ºrich and even the cable car up to Felsenegg. Great combo!\n\n14. Hike Uetliberg for a pretty view\n\nIf you are into hiking, you also need to explore Uetliberg!\n\nZ√ºrich‚Äôs main mountain is only a train ride away and during your hike you will be able to admire the views of Z√ºrich, the lake and, on a clear day, the Alps as well!\n\nThis is quite an easy hike, so beginners can easily do it. I think it‚Äôs a great idea after a day filled with cheese fondues and Swiss sausages!\n\nHOW TO DO IT BY YOURSELF: You can get there by train from the main station in Z√ºrich; the train ride will only take 20 minutes.\n\nMy advice is to do the 2-hour panoramic hike from Uetliberg to Felsenegg and admire the gorgeous views. On your way back from Felsenegg to the city, you can take the cable car down to Adliswil and the train back to the city.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to go there with an organized tour, have a look at this 6-hour hiking and sightseeing tour that will show you the main landmarks of Zurich after which you‚Äôll hike up to Uetliberg for the city views.\n\nFeeling even more adventurous? Then check out this 2-hour paragliding adventure that takes you flying above the area and has stops at Mount Titlis, Lake Lucerne, Lake Z√ºrich and finally, Uetliberg mountain!\n\nPRICE: Free. CHF 140 for the hiking and sightseeing tour\n\nBONUS 1 ‚Äì How to rent a bike for free in Z√ºrich\n\nI get you, walking around the city doing some sightseeing is sometimes exhausting! I have usually found myself walking to a place just to realize halfway there that I am really too tired to keep walking. However, this won‚Äôt happen to you in Z√ºrich as they have FREE rental bikes for you to use from a service called Z√ºri rollt.\n\nThe best part (except the fact they are free): they also work on Sunday! Until 9.30 pm! (which is unbelievable for Switzerland)\n\nThis place was not so easy to find and to be honest, we went in circles around the train station for 10-15 minutes looking for it. But do not worry, here are exact GPS coordinates on Google maps and a picture of what the entrance looks like (you need to go downstairs in a big parking lot-it is pretty hard to spot from the ground):\n\nThe only thing that you need to do is present your ID and a CHF 20 deposit at the bike station at the main train station (from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.) and there you go, a free bike for you to roam around this lovely European city!\n\nPRO TIP: Between May and October, you can also pick them up and drop them off at Pestalozziwiese (Bahnhofstrasse / Globus City) and Bellevue (Utoquai).\n\nNOTE: You have to return the bike to the same station where you picked it up at the end of the day and then you will get your deposit back. Reservations are needed if you‚Äôre going to take more than 5 bikes. If so, contact [email protected].\n\nBONUS 2 ‚Äì Museums worth checking out in Zurich\n\nWhen thinking about and researching the museums I wanted to recommend to you, I found myself with a HUGE number of museums for all different tastes.

That‚Äôs why I have created this section of some amazing, fun things to see in Z√ºrich if you have more time in the city.\n\nHere we go:\n\n1. Enjoy a performance at Z√ºrich Opera House\n\nI somehow always find myself recommending the opera houses of the cities I visit, did you notice that? The buildings are always so magnificent and the shows so unique, that it ends up being one of the best evening plans in European cities!\n\nThis is the case with the Z√ºrich Opera House as well, built in 1891.

Check out a Thermal Spa\n\nThere is literally nothing better that going for a thermal bath on a chilly day in Z√ºrich. Actually, even if it‚Äôs not chilly, too!\n\nI recommend you check out ThermalBad, a thermal bath that used to be an old brewery where you can choose between a basic thermal bath or a Roman-Irish spa ritual, for example. And while you‚Äôre at it, check out the rooftop pool that gives the best views of this charming city!\n\nPRICE: CHF 36 for the thermal bath and CHF 60 for the Roman-Irish spa ritual.

Go on a gourmet tour of the city\n\nOne of the best things to do in Z√ºrich (or any new city, if you ask me) is to take a food tour. And if I can do it as early on during my trip, I will! This way you get to taste the local cuisine and check out the best places to try the dishes.\n\nI recommend this Saturday sightseeing tour during which you‚Äôll get to explore the city and then you‚Äôll visit the Lindt Chocolate Shop and eat a 4-course cheese fondue meal in the forest!\n\nAlternatively, for a breath of fresh air, head to the countryside on this full day gourmet tour to try the best Swiss cheese and chocolates while you admire the Alpine view. Yum!\n\nPRICE: US $134 for the city gourmet tour\n\n6. Take a chocolate tour\n\nIf you go to Z√ºrich and you don‚Äôt taste some amazing Swiss chocolate, have you truly been there?\n\nThere are plenty of famous Swiss chocolate brands that you can try such as Lindt, Toblerone and even Milka!

Get lost in the Chinese Garden\n\nOne of Z√ºrich‚Äôs best kept secrets is the Chinese Garden, did you know that?\n\nThis is also one of the best Chinese temple gardens outside of China, with ponds, a palace and even a small island. I really think it‚Äôs the perfect place to chill and have a walk!\n\nAlso, the whole area where the Garden is located ‚Äì Z√ºrichhorn ‚Äì is absolutely lovely! We spent a charming afternoon having lunch in one of those riverside restaurants!\n\nPRICE: Entrance is CHF 4\n\n8. Take a Polybahn train from the city center\n\nThe Polybanh is a cute historical funicular railway that will take you from Z√ºrich‚Äôs main train station to the panorama terrace of ETH University.\n\nIt‚Äôs been in operation since 1889 and it helps students and teachers get from the city to their campus on top of the hill. It‚Äôs connected to the public network system so it‚Äôs just like riding the bus, but WAY cooler!\n\nPRICE: CHF 1.20, which you can buy at the ticket counter\n\n9. Watch the sunset from ETH University\n\nOnce you arrive at ETH University on the Polybahn, you should waste no time and start exploring this historical university and its surroundings right away!\n\nEstablished in 1855, it has since been a benchmark for Universities all over the world. Nowadays, it‚Äôs the 6th best university in the world, and the 2nd best in Europe right after Oxford. While you‚Äôre there, you can roam around, get a cheap beer from the university bar and admire the sunset views from the Polyterasse, a viewing terrace that is just in front of the main building of the ETH.\n\nFUN FACT: Did you know Einstein used to live in Z√ºrich? A great way to discover the city through the eyes of this world-famous scientist is to book this Einstein Exploration Game in which you solve clues and questions while you explore the city. Fun!\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n10. Have some fun at the Street Parade\n\nOf all the festival buzz, I think this is THE BEST event for you in Z√ºrich! It‚Äôs a must thing to do in Z√ºrich for young adults.\n\nThe Street Parade is an electronic music fear in Z√ºrich in August (by the way, the next one is on 08.08.2020). However, during the Street Parade there are different events and parades happening the whole weekend throughout Z√ºrich!\n\nThis festival has been held for almost 30 years and it has become a very important event in the electronic music world. Make sure to check it out!\n\nPRICE: Free\n\nBONUS 3: 4 Day trips from Z√ºrich\n\nWhether you have done all of the Z√ºrich activities I recommended above or you just want to get away from the city life for a little bit, I‚Äôve got you covered!\n\nYou can check out my favorite day trips from Z√ºrich below and enjoy the stunning Swiss nature surrounding the city:\n\n1. Mount Titlis\n\nFor those not afraid of heights, Mount Titlis is your go-to day trip from Z√ºrich! At 3,238m, it is the highest peak of the northern part of the Alps. A great ski destination, Mount Titlis is also an amazing place to admire the Alpine view!\n\nHOW TO GET THERE ON YOUR OWN: It‚Äôs definitely doable to get there on your own as well! You just need to take the train from Z√ºrich Main Station to Engelberg. Once there, you can walk to the cable car station that will take you to the top to the Mount Titlis summit. All this should cost CHF 52 one-way. Easy peasy!\n\nAlternatively, if you‚Äôd like for it all to be arranged for you, I recommend you check out this full day tour of Mount Titlis from Z√ºrich. You‚Äôll get to explore the summit in a cable car, check out the panoramic view and walk along Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge. At the end of the tour, you‚Äôll visit the charming Swiss town of Lucerne as well.\n\nPRICE: US $160 for the tour\n\n2. Rigi\n\nAs an alternative to Mount Titlis you can go discover Rigi. This mountain massif is located in the central part of the Swiss Alps and is surrounded by Lake Lucerne, Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz, so you‚Äôre bound for an amazing treat!\n\nWhether you are a hiking fanatic, an extreme sports fan or even if you‚Äôd just like to enjoy some spa treatments, you can find all of these at Rigi!\n\nHOW TO GET THERE ON YOUR OWN: To get there from Z√ºrich on your own is a bit tricky but doable nonetheless. You can take a train to Lucerne; once there, get a boat to Vitznau and when you get off this boat, a train from Vitznau to Rigi Kulm. Alternatively, for quicker but less scenic ride, you can get a train from Z√ºrich to Arth-Goldau, and then a train up to Rigi Kulm, for around CHF 45. Check out the train schedule here; there is no need for you to book it in advance.\n\nIf it sounds like too much of a hassle, there are plenty of tours that take you exploring the area and travelers love them. For instance, you can check out this full day winter tour where you will be taken to this amazing natural winter wonderland and you‚Äôll also visit the town of Lucerne on your way back to Z√ºrich.\n\nPRICE: US $123 for the tour\n\n3. Rhine Falls\n\nIf you have always dreamed of going to Niagara Falls or Iguazu Falls, you should visit Rhine Falls, the most powerful falls on the European continent!\n\nIt is definitely a place that is worth visiting because of its incredible natural beauty.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE ON YOUR OWN: You can easily do it in a half day trip from Z√ºrich by taking a train from the main station to Scafhausen (1 hour) and then a bus to Rhine Falls for around CHF 15. OR you can take a train to Schloss for about CHF 12 and check out the view of the falls from a stunning castle.\n\nOtherwise, I recommend you book this 3.5-hour tour that‚Äôs definitely more time-efficient than doing it on your own. You‚Äôll get to explore Laufen Castle, go on a panoramic trail and feel the vibration of the viewing platform from above the waterfalls!\n\nPRICE: US $51 for the tour\n\n4. Lucerne\n\nLucerne is a Swiss city located in the central (and German-speaking) part of the country. It‚Äôs quite famous among travelers as it is a popular spot for day trips from any of the other main cities!\n\nThis lovely medieval town is one of the most picturesque places in Switzerland!\n\nHOW TO GET THERE ON YOUR OWN: There are 40 trains travelling between Z√ºrich and Lucerne per day, for just CHF 12.50. It makes for an easy journey of 45 minutes with no transfers so it‚Äôs quite reachable and definitely recommended!\n\nAlternatively, and to save yourself some energy, you can hop on a day tour of Lucerne from Z√ºrich. You‚Äôll get to see the main landmarks of this cozy little town such as the Lion Monument, a monastery and the mountain village of Engelberg!\n\nPRICE: US $75 for the tour\n\nBONUS 4: 6 Awesome Things to do in Zurich with kids\n\nTraveling to Z√ºrich with your kids or with the whole family? Do not stress about it, Z√ºrich is one of the most kid-friendly cities in Europe! Plenty of the activities already described above are super doable with kids, but I know of a few more that you and your whole family will love!\n\nKeep reading to learn about traveling to Zurich as a family:\n\n1. Learn at Zoo in Z√ºrich\n\nZurich Zoo is considered to be one of the best Zoos in Europe and I am sure the little ones will love it there!\n\nOne of the oldest Zoos out there, it has over 300 species housed in near-natural habitats.\n\nIt is located a little outside of the tourist center but it is super easy to get there by public transportation, bike or taxi!\n\n2. Get lost at the Botanical Garden Z√ºrich\n\nI love visiting botanical gardens in every place that I go ‚Äì and the Botanical Gardens of Z√ºrich are no exception! They have 7,000 different plants covering an area of 53,000 square metres!\n\nThese botanical gardens are actually super family-friendly where your kids can run around with total freedom, learn about local and foreign flora and admire the wildlife and diversity of species.\n\nPRO TIP: Make sure you check out the pond; it‚Äôs full of singing frogs!\n\nPRICE: Free\n\n3. Discover the city‚Äôs river pools\n\nAnother excuse to bring your swimsuit is the city‚Äôs river pools! These are designated swimming areas built in the river, which are called badi.

Staying in a comfortable and clean accommodation and having a delicious, local dish for dinner are a must for any of my trips, so I can feel like I‚Äôve had a great experience.\n\nBy the way, during my Z√ºrich visit I discovered some fun facts about Switzerland that you probably didn‚Äôt know:\n\nWhen the Romans first conquered the area in 222 BC, they called the city Turikum.\n\nThey‚Äôre a pretty peaceful country. Before Napole√≥n arrived in 1778, they hadn‚Äôt had a war for over 200 years and since he left in 1814 they have remained neutral in every war.\n\nBern is actually the capital of Switzerland, because the national parliament is there but they don‚Äôt have a prime minister. Their official language? German, French and Italian and they speak all 3 of them in the parliament-it‚Äôs a funny conversation!\n\nIt has the largest number of Nobel prize winners in the world!\n\nWith a similar system to Israel, all Swiss citizens have to participate in military service for 21 weeks (women don‚Äôt have to, but they‚Äôre allowed!).\n\nIt‚Äôs ranked the third country worldwide, in terms of gun ownership per capita, right after the USA and Yemen.\n\nIt‚Äôs the country with the biggest chocolate consumption in the world! (AND the Swiss invented milk chocolate!)\n\nSo, now that you know all these fun facts, keep reading below if you‚Äôd like to learn all the practical tips regarding your Z√ºrich adventure:\n\nHow to get from the airport to the city\n\nOne of the first things that comes to mind when travelling by plane to any country is how to get from the airport to the city. This is quite an important thing to plan beforehand, as you might be tired after the flight and maybe won‚Äôt want to think too much nor spend too much money on transportation to the city.\n\nLuckily for you, Z√ºrich Airport (ZRH) is connected to the city through one of the best transportation networks in Europe! Here are your options:\n\nBy Taxi/Uber\n\nTaxis are always a reliable method of transportation between the city and the airport.\n\nIn Z√ºrich, there are many different private taxi companies you can choose from. The ride takes around 15 minutes, unless it‚Äôs the weekend or rush hour, in which case you should expect some brief traffic delays. The price for the ride from the airport to the city center can range from CHF 45 to 65.\n\nAlternatively, you can always get an Uber, they‚Äôre just as trustworthy and the price is very competitive compared to that of the taxi! Bear in mind that they will only be able to pick you up from the arrivals gate, so once you arrive make sure you take the elevator and follow the signs to ‚ÄúArrivals‚Äù. An Uber ride would cost from CHF 25 to 35.\n\nBy train\n\nThe most popular (and my favorite) method of transportation between the city and the airport is the train. The rides take around 10 minutes and it is quite affordable for such an expensive city! That is how I arrived to the city, too (from France).\n\nTrains run often, usually every 5 minutes between 5 a.m. and 00.45 a.m. The ride costs CHF 6.8 for adults.\n\nPRO TIP: You might want to consider getting a day pass if you are arriving very early in the day and you are planning on doing more things! Day passes are valid for 24 hours and they cost CHF 13.6 for adults.\n\nBy tram\n\nFinally, you can also get to the Z√ºrich city center by tram (I think the locals also call it a ‚Äúcobra‚Äù?). This is quite a unique thing that I haven‚Äôt seen in many places and it‚Äôs supposed to be quite the experience. The trams run from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and the ride lasts for 35 minutes. The price is CHF 6.8 for adults.\n\nTransportation inside Z√ºrich\n\nEven though Z√ºrich is a small city, knowing your way around public transportation can be super useful when navigating it. Moreover, many of the Z√ºrich day tours are reachable by public transport, so make sure you have a thorough read of this section of the post!\n\nFirst of all, all the public transportation tickets work for every means of transportation, so you can use the same one for the train, tram and bus. You buy a ticket for a certain zone that you are traveling within and it will be valid for a certain amount of time.\n\nPRICE: CHF 8.6 for a day pass. CHF 4.3 for a single ticket (1 hour)\n\nBy Taxi/Uber\n\nTaxis are great in Z√ºrich. There are several private companies running them (such as Zuerich Taxi 24 or Taxi 444) all of them super trustworthy (although a bit pricey compared to the cost of public transportation).\n\nAs I mentioned above, Uber is a great and affordable alternative to taxis. They‚Äôre reliable and have a very competitive price! For example, taxis charge CHF 7 as a starting fare and then CHF 4 per km. Uber ends up being around half the price for the same route.\n\nBy train\n\nTrains in Switzerland are awesome. They‚Äôre not only super comfortable and safe, but also the most punctual! Whether you are travelling within the city or actually going to other places in Switzerland, trains are your best bet.\n\nTrains usually run between 5 a.m. and 00:45 a.m., you can check out the train schedule here.\n\nBy tram\n\nThe tram in Zurich is a symbol of the city and it is always one of my favorite ways to travel in this beautiful city-it‚Äôs so romantic! It works just like the other public methods of transportation, same price and you can also check the schedule here.\n\nPRO TIP: Trams always have the right of way, so watch out for them!\n\nBy bus\n\nPublic buses are also a great option when travelling within or outside of the city. Buses are the only public method of transport available at night on Friday and Saturday, as they have many night buses for the weekend. You can check out the bus timetable here.\n\nBy rack railway/cable car\n\nCable cars in Zurich are awesome because they are part of the public transport system so you are able to get a ride on one of them and get amazing views for the price of a public transport ticket, what a win!\n\nWhere to stay in Z√ºrich\n\nOne thing I believe that often gets overlooked when it comes to Switzerland is the incredible hospitality you will find all over the country! If you want to experience the best of it, it‚Äôs important that you choose the right place to stay during your visit.\n\nI have written a whole article with the best options on Zurich accommodations here, but below you will find some of my favorites, arranged from luxury to budget!\n\nLuxury (US $300 and up):\n\nPark Hyatt Zurich offers a stunning design and perfect location. In a modern avant-garde building, the in-house restaurant features floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides! Otherwise, Hotel Schweizerhof Zurich offers sound-proofed rooms, adjustable beds, two award-winning, in-house restaurants and a classy whiskey bar so this hotel is hard to beat!\n\nMiddle-priced (between US $130 and US $300):\n\nSeegarten Swiss Quality Hotel boasts a mediterranean theme and some beautiful al fresco street-side dining. To top it all off some rooms have stunning lake views! Alternatively, Motel One Zurich is a remarkable art-nouveau building that will keep you satisfied inside and out of the hotel! The rooms themselves match the exterior and the design is truly unique!\n\nBudget (up to US $130):\n\nPension f√ºrDich has classy yet modern, tasteful and spacious rooms. There is a lovely in-house restaurant and bar which makes for some lovely summertime alfresco dining! On the other hand, Kalkbreite Pension & Guesthouse is a great choice for families, as the hotel has a cool playground! In addition, it also has its own in-house cinema to unwind after a long day of shopping on the nearby Bahnhofstra√üe!\n\nCity cards in Z√ºrich\n\nThe great thing about Switzerland is how well prepared and organized it is. For instance, you have a wide array of city or travel cards that you can purchase before your trip that will make it way more cost-effective.\n\nMany of the museums, activities and even means of transportation that I mentioned above are included in these cards. Depending on the type of traveller you are or the kind of trip that you‚Äôll be taking, you might want to choose one or the other.\n\nCheck out the main city cards below:\n\nZURICH CITY CARD ‚Äì Ideal for those that will stick to Z√ºrich and its surroundings. Gives you free transport (ferry, tram, bus, train and cable car) in Z√ºrich and the surrounding areas and gives you free or discounted access to 40 different Z√ºrich museums. You can get a card valid for one or three full days, depending on the length of your trip.\n\nMy calculations showed it will be worth your money if you travel around Z√ºrich and visit at least 2 museums a day. For instance, if you go to Rietberg Museum and Pavillon Le Corbusier, you would be spending just CHF 26 on entrance tickets, plus whatever you spend on public transport, which will be already worth it!\n\nPRICE: CHF 27 for 24h, CHF 55 for 72h\n\nSWISS TRAVEL PASS ‚Äì Perfect if you‚Äôre planning on traveling throughout Switzerland a bit and your trip is a little longer, it is available for 3 to 15 days and gives you free access to the whole Swiss transport network and to more than 500 museums in Switzerland with several excursions included, too.\n\nIt will be worth your money if you are planning on traveling throughout Switzerland a lot, visiting museums and at least 3 towns. For instance, train tickets between 4 Swiss towns can add up to CHF 300, then if we add up public transportation and the freedom of going to any museum, this can easily be worth it!\n\nNOTE: If you are going to travel around Europe by train, I recommend you to take a look at my post about the Interrail/Eurail pass and my calculations on if it is worth it.\n\nPRICE: CHF 418 for an 8 day pass in second class, (CHF 663 for first class). By the way, the difference between the first class and second class in Swiss trains is not that big, just a bit more leg space and fewer seats in each carriage.\n\nMust-try food in Z√ºrich\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this section! On the one hand, I love reminiscing about the best traditional meals to try in different places; on the other, I realize some of the dishes I missed out on while on my trip! üôÇ\n\nAnyhow, I quite enjoy talking about the flavors that I loved the most and while I know that it‚Äôs hard to try them all, my goal is to make you try as many as you can.
