        "text": "3.1. N2O emission, plant performance and incomplete nitrification\n\nDuring our N2O monitoring campaign at Uster WWTP, the biological treatment went through two extended periods of severe nitrification and settling failure leading to high NO2− concentrations and turbidity in the effluent. A detailed overview of the performance and operation of the biological treatment during both periods is shown in . Starting in March 2018 and April 2019, increased N2O emissions, very low nitratation performance (NO2− in effluent), bad settleability of the activated sludge (SVI) and a turbid effluent (low transparency value) were the most important process failure characteristics observed over a period of two to three months ( ). After an extended transition phase of roughly one month, the reactors reverted to a satisfying treatment performance (as before the process failure period) and emitted very low amounts of N2O during both campaigns. Interestingly, the transition between phases was not synchronized between the different reactors. This asynchrony of the recovery is highlighted by the high standard deviations for the N2O emissions, estimated NOB and AOB activity in mid-April 2018 to mid-May 2018 and May 2019 ( a; for individual reactor data see SI Figs. S1–3).\n\nDuring both campaigns, NO2− concentrations in the mixed effluent of all reactors reached very high values of up to 9.3 mgNO2−-N/l during campaign 1 and 4.9 mgNO2−-N/l during campaign 2, as shown in b. While NO2− concentrations increased within a month from satisfying to peak concentrations, the return to normal concentrations took two to three months. Although the rapid sand filtration for effluent polishing could reduce some of the produced NO2−, the effluent concentrations were still dramatically higher than the target value of 0.3 mgNO2−-N/l of the Swiss water protection law. The NO2− concentrations correlated negatively with the observed average NOB activity (r = −0.61, p < 0.001, n = 81). While the NOB activity dropped by up to 100% to levels around 20 mgN/l/d, AOB activity decreased only slightly (campaign 2) or remained stable and increased later (campaign 1, cluster E). Therefore, NH4+ effluent concentrations increased slightly but remained clearly below the discharge limits of 2 mgNH4+-N/L after the filter. The transparency of the effluent dropped parallel to the decreasing NOB activity ( b, Fig. S4, Figs. S5 and S6, SI). The sludge settling characteristics changed dramatically leading to high SVI values and low sludge settling velocities ( , Figures S5 and S6, SI). Both properties showed a medium negative correlation (r = −0.51, p < 0.001, n = 332) and were heavily affected during both process failure phases. The WWTP emitted significant amounts of N2O during both campaigns. During peak days, up to 30% of the influent nitrogen load was emitted as N2O, resulting in a massive impact on the greenhouse gas balance of the WWTP. N2O emissions showed a close and highly significant positive correlation with NO2− concentrations in the effluent of the biological treatment (r = 0.81, p < 0.001, n = 60). Generally, the emission pattern was highly variable. Under wet weather conditions e.g., at the beginning of April 2018, N2O emissions dropped to very low levels and then peaked only a few days later when the influent wastewater amount returned to dry weather conditions.\n\nEffluent NO2− concentrations and transparency values from the biological treatment indicate that similar events of incomplete nitrification were observed in the spring seasons of preceding years (Fig. S3). Despite the evident periodicity of the nitrification failure episodes, the two campaigns indicate a different progression of process performance in different years. In campaign 1, NO2− rose and peaked rapidly, and the estimated NOB activity dropped accordingly to levels close to zero at the beginning of March. The effluent transparency mirrored the pattern of the NO2− concentrations. In campaign 2, the decline of NOB activity and the increase of NO2− effluent concentration happened more gradually with a peak in March while the effluent transparency value reached its minimum one month before the NO2− concentrations. Interestingly, the process failure phenomenology was overall less dramatic in campaign 2 compared to campaign 1 ( , , Fig. S9)."
