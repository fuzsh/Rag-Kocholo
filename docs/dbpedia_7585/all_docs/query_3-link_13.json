Indoor Pools in Zürich\n\nZurich has many indoor swimming pools that are fun on any cold weather day year round. Most of these indoor pools have a lap pool and shallow “non-swimmer” pool for play time.\n\nSome have fun extras like waterslides, splash pads for small children, heated outdoor pools with massage jets, and saunas.\n\nOur favorite in Zurich city is the Alstetten pool, which has diving platforms, a water slide, heated pools with massage jets and bubble loungers, and bouncy pads at designated play times.\n\nWebsite: www.bad-altstetten.ch\n\nLocation: Dachslernstrasse 35, Zürich ZH\n\nOpen: Mon,Wed,Fri 6:00 – 21:00 / Tue, Thu 8:00 – 21:00 / Sat,Sun 8:00 – 18:00\n\nCost: Adult CHF 8 / Youth (15-19) CHF 6 / Child (6-15) CHF 4 / under 6 free\n\nSee all our favorite indoor pools near Zurich.\n\n14.

Hürlimannbad & Spa\n\nThis thermal bath and spa is right in Zürich city, a convenient option if you want to relax and warm up on a cold day.

With kids, we suggest Thermalbad Zurzach, about a 45 mins drive north of Zürich. It has a rowdy lazy river that kids will love, a regular pool and splash pool for little kids.\n\nWe also like Solo Uno thermal baths near Basel, which has cool features like a lazy river, scented steam baths, warm rain room, cold waterfalls, etc. See also thermal baths with kids.\n\nLocation: in Zürich center – Brandschenkestrasse 150, 8002 Zürich\n\nCost: Adult day pass CHF 39 / Roman-Irish Spa Ritual CHF 65 (ages 16+)\n\nOpen: daily 9:00 – 22:00\n\nWebsite: www.aqua-spa-resorts.ch\n\nSporty\n\n17.

Each gym has dozens of routes of varying difficulty as well as self-belay routes and bouldering walls. The Greifensee location also has a indoor ropes parcours course attached to the ceiling.\n\nThey offer drop-in use, abos and classes and rent equipment onsite.

Indoor Playgrounds\n\nIndoor indoor play halls are a great place for kids to run off extra energy on bad weather days. These places typically have trampolines, climbing equipment, bouncy castles, slides, and ball pits among other amusements.\n\nNear Zürich, our favorite for little kids in Springding and for older kids Trampolino or Monkey Town.\n\nSee our list of indoor playgrounds near Zürich\n\n23. Indoor Racquet Sports\n\nZurich has several indoor tennis courts that are open to the public. You can reserve them online at GotCourts.\n\nThere are several indoor sports complexes (not private clubs) around Switzerland that have indoor sport courts, like badminton, tennis, squash, etc. Near Zürich, we like Sihlsports in Langnau.\n\nAmusements\n\n24. Adventure Arena\n\nAdventure Arena has 20 rooms, each with a short mental and/or physical challenge that your team tries to complete in the allotted time (usually about 3 mins).\n\nYou bounce from room to room, trying different games until you complete them. In two hours, we were able to solve eight rooms and enjoy every minute of it. Best for adults, teens and kids 8+.\n\nWebsite: www.adventure-arena.ch\n\nLocation: Stettbachstrasse 2, 8600 Dübendorf\n\nCost: 2 hr ticket – Adult CHF 35 / Child (under 16) CHF 25 / more on weekends\n\nOpen: Wed – Sun – times vary by day, check current opening times\n\n25. Escape the room\n\nEscape the room games are a classic and there are lots to choose from in the Zürich area. Most recently we did the Submarine room at The Escape near the Zürich main station and really enjoyed it. All instructions there are in both English and German. We’ve done a few at ActionWorld west of Zurich, including the Tomb, which a group of six teens liked.\n\nThe cost usually ranges from CHF 35-50/person for a 1 hour game. Most games are best done with 2-4 people. Some Escape Rooms offer team challenges where large groups (like for a birthday party) can split into multiple teams and work in different rooms trying to beat the other teams.\n\nHere a few escape rooms in the Zürich area:\n\nThe Escape\n\nActionWorld\n\nROOM Escape Room\n\nAdventure Rooms\n\n26. Bowling\n\nBowling can be a fun diversion when we have a long streak of bad weather. In the Zürich area, we like Fun Bowl Stockmatt in Affoltern am Albis, about a 20 min drive from Zurich. It’s clean, friendly, and festively lit, a comfortable place for families. They have bumpers to help small kids can enjoy the fun.\n\nWebsite: www.funbowl.ch\n\nLocation: Zurichstrasse 183, Affoltern am Albis\n\nCost: starting at CHF 6 per round\n\nOpen: every day 14:00 – 24:00\n\n27. Laser Tag\n\nWe usually save Laser Tag for birthday parties. But it’s also fun for small groups for an impromptu activity any day of the week.\n\nIn Zürich city, we like Laser Arena, which is located in the Enge neighborhood near Sihlcity. If you go with a big group, you can request that you are on the same team or split so you compete against each other.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, they have a special for kids – 3 games for CHF 25.\n\nWebsite: laser-arena.ch\n\nLocation: Brandschenkestrasse 178, 8002 Zürich\n\nCost: Starting at CHF 15/game / discounts for groups and parties\n\nOpen: Wed to Sun / times vary by day – see opening times\n\n28. Go Karts\n\nGo-Karts are a special treat, driving loops around a curvy track up to 55km. We’ve hosted and attended a few birthday parties Kartbahn Spreitenbach, just north of Zürich city.\n\nIt’s an exciting track and the modern electric carts are really fun to drive. Kids over 130cm tall can drive the go-karts.\n\nWebsite: kart.ch\n\nLocation: Industriestrasse 166, 8957 Spreitenbach\n\nCost: CHF 19-26 per person per race / Discounts on Monday and your birthday\n\nOpen: Mon to Sat / times vary by day – see opening times\n\nFood\n\n29. Hot chocolate at Sprüngli café\n\nIt’s always a treat on a cold day to sit in a beautiful café and enjoy Swiss hot chocolate and pastries in a cozy setting. Zürich has many fun cafes but if you want an old world feel, the Sprüngli café is a good choice.\n\nWe suggest their grand cru hot chocolate with chocolate foam. They have lots of beautiful pastries, but we typically get their chocolate truffle brioche, which chocolate baked inside. For groups larger than four or weekend brunch, best to reserve a table a few days in advance.\n\nWebsite: spruengli.ch\n\nLocation: Paradeplatz, Bahnhofstrasse 21, 8001 Zürich\n\nCost: hot chocolate starting at CHF 7.90\n\nOpen: Mon-Fri 8:30 – 18:30 / Sat 9:00 – 18:30 / Sun 9:00 – 17:00\n\nSee our list of Best Hot Chocolate in Zürich.\n\n30.

We loved the photo rooms, where you can capture animated GIFs of you inside weird environments, like the one here.\n\nPeople of all ages, from young children to teens to adults, will have fun here.
