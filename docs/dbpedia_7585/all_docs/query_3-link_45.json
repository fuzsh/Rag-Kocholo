        "text": "Hi friends, welcome back to the finale of my Switzerland series! Jon and I enjoyed every last second of the mountain views with our morning coffee before we packed up and headed to the train station. The logistics for the day included three different trains as we made our way from Wengen to Zurich. The first of which was the train down to Lauterbrunnen. The views from the train never got old! I sure miss starting my day with a beautiful train or gondola ride.\n\nFrom Lauterbrunnen we boarded a train to Interlaken, and then a final train from Interlaken to Zurich. The train to Zurich was the one leg we needed to prebook tickets for because it was only covered by our half pass. The commute was pretty uneventful and we arrived in the city center right on schedule. From the train station it was a short walk to our hotel for the night. We stayed at Hotel Wellenberg and it was just ok. The bathroom really needed a remodel but the location was great, bed was comfy, it was clean, and had a fan! We just needed a comfy bed for one night so it worked, but I probably wouldn’t stay there again.\n\nThe heatwave in Switzerland was still going strong, it was about 93 degrees in Zurich, so I’m pretty impressed Jon and I lasted as long as we did exploring. I especially do not do well in the heat or sun, but we had an enjoyable afternoon roaming the beautiful streets of the city.\n\nI loved the charming and colorful buildings and couldn’t believe how clean the streets were!\n\nJon and I couldn’t visit Zurich without stopping into a chocolate shop and the delectable truffles from Teuscher caught our eye. We ate them quickly because they were melting, but they were easily some of the best chocolates we’ve had.\n\nWe then made our way to Lake Zurich and found an unoccupied bench to enjoy the breeze and shade.\n\nI stuck my toes in the water and it felt relatively warm but so refreshing!\n\nFor dinner we stopped into Sternen Grill for a final meal of some currywurst and bratwurst with some bread rolls. It was delicious and the hearty meal I’d been hoping for in Switzerland.\n\nHeading back to our hotel we admired the views on the other side of the Limmat River. The most notable buildings include Fraumünster Church with the green spires and St. Peters with the big clock. I’d love to return to Switzerland so hopefully we can spend more than a half day in Zurich!\n\nThe following morning we went for a quick walk around town and then it was time to hop back on the train to the airport. I don’t have any pictures so it must’ve been a pretty uneventful journey home.\n\nI’m a numbers gal and was curious, so I calculated all our transportation costs. By purchasing our passes, we saved approximately 700 CHF. I think that was worth the headache!"
