Temperatures were quite widely higher than the average for March! There was sometimes too little precipitation in the north, but clearly too much in the south.

Viewed over the whole of Switzerland, it ended with a surplus of around 4.7 degrees in terms of temperatures, a deficit of around 2% in terms of precipitation and around 18% in terms of sunshine duration.\n\nFig. 1: Temperature deviation in February compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFig. 2: Precipitation deviation in February compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFig. 3: Deviation in sunshine duration in February compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nSeveral temperature records broken\n\nFebruary was spring-like and broke several temperature records:\n\nWith a deviation of around 4.7 degrees, it was by far the mildest February over the whole of Switzerland since measurements began in 1864, significantly beating the previous record from 1990 with a deviation of around 4.1 degrees. Most of the individual measuring stations also recorded by far the mildest February since measurements began. In many places, the February average was even higher than the long-term March average!\n\nTogether with June 2003, last February had the largest positive temperature deviation of any single month since measurements began.\n\nThe mildest February night since measurements began was recorded at individual measurement locations (e.g. Bad Ragaz Minima 12.6 degrees on the night of February 8 to 9, mildest February night to date 10.9 degrees on the night of February 6 to 7, 2001).\n\nThere were individual measuring stations in the swiss plateau in the north and south where there were never any negative temperatures and thus frost in February (no frost days, e.g. in Basel, Neuchâtel, Lausanne, St. Gallen and Lugano), which has never happened before (see Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4: Number of frost days last February; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFinally, an overview of the deviations in temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration for some stations last February compared to the long-term average from 1991 to 2020.\n\nThe weather in February 2024\n\nplace Temperaturabweichung Niederschlagsabweichung Abweichung der Sonnenscheindauer °C % % Buchs-Aarau 4.9 19.0 -1.0 Bern 5.1 -29.0 -4.0 Basel-Binningen 5.0 -32.0 -34.0 Chur 5.2 7.0 -30.0 Geneva 3.9 -21.0 -2.0 La Chaux-de-Fonds 4.8 -10.0 -26.0 Lugano 3.0 201.0 -22.0 Lucerne 4.6 -38.0 -6.0 Säntis 3.9 -6.0 -25.0 Sion 4.4 -4.0 -9.0 Sankt Gallen 5.7 6.0 -9.0 Samedan 5.6 140.0 -26.0 Vaduz 5.6 -14.0 -18.0 Zurich Airport 5.4 2.0 -12.0\n\nClimatic mean from 1991 to 2020, source: MeteoSwiss Temperature precipitation sunshine duration February 2024 Mittel Abweichung February 2024 Mittel Abweichung February 2024 Mittel Abweichung [°C] [°C] [°C] [mm] [mm] [%] [h] [h] [%] Buchs-Aarau 6.8 1.9 4.9 62.4 52.6 19.0 73.2 74.2 -1.0 Bern 6.2 1.1 5.1 39.5 55.5 -29.0 90.2 94.4 -4.0 Basel-Binningen 8.2 3.2 5.0 30.7 45.2 -32.0 56.1 85.3 -34.0 Chur 7.3 2.1 5.2 43.1 40.2 7.0 78.7 111.7 -30.0 Geneva 6.8 2.9 3.9 44.3 55.9 -21.0 94.1 95.9 -2.0 La Chaux-de-Fonds 4.1 -0.7 4.8 84.1 93.0 -10.0 78.4 106.2 -26.0 Lugano 8.0 5.0 3.0 184.6 61.3 201.0 111.0 142.3 -22.0 Lucerne 6.5 1.9 4.6 38.0 61.3 -38.0 75.5 79.9 -6.0 Säntis -3.6 -7.5 3.9 207.5 221.9 -6.0 99.3 132.3 -25.0 Sion 6.7 2.3 4.4 38.6 40.4 -4.0 118.7 130.8 -9.0 Sankt Gallen 6.5 0.8 5.7 68.3 64.2 6.0 72.5 79.4 -9.0 Samedan -1.5 -7.1 5.6 45.6 19.0 140.0 89.7 121.3 -26.0 Vaduz 8.3 2.7 5.6 29.0 33.8 -14.0 75.1 91.6 -18.0 Zurich Airport 7.0 1.6 5.4 56.6 55.5 2.0 71.8 81.6 -12.0\n\nMildest February since measurements began in 1864!\n\nThis past February will go down in the weather books as clearly the mildest February since records began in 1864, with a current excess of 4.9 degrees across the whole of Switzerland (see Fig. 1), the previous record being 4.1 degrees in February 1990.\n\nFig. 1: Temperature deviation up to February 26 compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nThe deviation is somewhat greater in the east than in the west and especially in the south, with temperatures locally exceeding 6 degrees, but even here the temperature surplus is nowhere below 3 degrees. Broken down to the individual measuring stations, February was the mildest since measurements began in many places, but not everywhere (e.g. not in Geneva, where February 2020 was slightly milder, or on the Säntis, where February 1998 in particular was milder).\n\nEven if the surplus will fall slightly by the end of the month despite temperatures remaining slightly above average, February will clearly be the mildest February in Switzerland since measurements began in 1864.\n\nMilder than average in March in many places!\n\nThis year's February was anything but wintry in terms of temperatures, but rather spring-like, and was even milder than the long-term average temperatures from 1991 to 2020 in March (see table below).\n\nStation February average to date Long-term March average Long-term April average Aarau 6.6 degrees 5.9 degrees 9.9 degrees Berne 6.2 degrees 5.2 degrees 9.0 degrees Basel-Binningen 8.2 degrees 7.0 degrees 10.7 degrees Chur 7.3 degrees 6.3 degrees 10.2 degrees Geneva 6.6 degrees 6.7 degrees 10.5 degrees La Chaux-de-Fonds 4.2 degrees 2.6 degrees 6.1 degrees Lugano 8.0 degrees 8.9 degrees 12.3 degrees Lucerne 6.5 degrees 6.0 degrees 9.9 degrees Säntis -3.7 degrees -5.6 degrees -3.0 degrees Sion 6.5 degrees 7.2 degrees 11.3 degrees St. Gallen 6.8 degrees 4.4 degrees 8.1 degrees Samedan -1.7 degrees -2.4 degrees 1.9 degrees Zurich Airport 7.0 degrees 5.6 degrees 9.6 degrees\n\nTab. 1: February average to date compared to the long-term March and April averages (underlined stations with higher February average to date than March average)\n\nOn the Säntis, the February average to date is clearly closer to the April average than the March average!\n\nPossibly the month with the largest temperature surplus since measurements began\n\nThe month with the largest positive temperature deviation in Switzerland since measurements began in 1864 was June 2003 with a deviation of around 4.65 degrees. We could top this value in February, in any case it will be close!\n\nEven greater temperature surplus in Austria\n\nThe temperature deviation in February was already extreme for us, but it is even greater in Austria, where there is currently a surplus of no less than 6 degrees across the whole country and even over 8 degrees locally (see Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2: Temperature deviation up to February 26 in Austria compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: UBIMET\n\nExtremely advanced vegetation development\n\nVegetation has responded to the record-high temperatures and is therefore much more advanced than usual at this time of year. For example, the first peach and apricot trees are already flowering, around two to three weeks earlier than usual (see Fig. 3). In the event of frost in March, which occurs frequently and is very likely, there is a great risk that the blossoms will freeze.\n\nFig. 3: Apricot tree currently in bloom in Sarganserland; Source: Bild: Roger Perret\n\nToo wet in the south\n\nAs a result of two very pronounced accumulations, it has been far too wet in the south and in southern Grisons so far in February. The weather was also slightly too wet in many places in the far east and partly in the west, otherwise there was mostly too little precipitation. Across Switzerland as a whole, precipitation is pretty much in line with the norm (see Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4: Precipitation deviation up to February 26 compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nSlightly too little sun\n\nIn terms of sunshine duration, there has been a small deficit of around 13% across the whole of Switzerland so far in February (see Fig. 5). On the Central Plateau, the sun shone about normally in many places, otherwise it was mostly too cloudy, especially in the Jura, in the south and in Graubünden.\n\nFig. 5: Deviation in sunshine duration up to February 26 compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nAbove-average temperatures between around 3 and 7 degrees\n\nFebruary, known as a cold winter month, has been really spring-like so far, with temperatures in the first half of the month 5.3 degrees above the 1991-2020 norm across the whole of Switzerland. In some places, the deviation was over 6 degrees, in La Brévine it was even 6.9 degrees and in St. Gallen 6.8 degrees (see Fig. 1). Both the average minimum and maximum temperatures were responsible for the excess to roughly the same extent (minimum 5.5 degrees and maximum 5.4 degrees above the norm throughout Switzerland).\n\nFig. 1: Previous temperature deviation in February compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nTemperatures as usual on average in April\n\nSo far, February has been milder than the normal average for March. In St. Gallen, for example, the average temperature in February this year is 7.2 degrees, but the long-term average temperature in March is only 4.4 degrees. This means that we are not too far off the average April average of 8.3 degrees. The same picture emerges at altitude, with the average temperature in February on the Säntis at -2.9 degrees, while the March average is significantly lower at -5.6 degrees. Here, even the April average is slightly lower at -3.0 degrees! As you can see, the first half of February is more reminiscent of April in terms of temperatures. No wonder, vegetation development is also much further advanced than normal (see Fig. 2) and the load of hazel and alder pollen has been high for some time.\n\nFig. 2: Blooming crocus with bees in mid-February in Sarganserland; Source: Roger Perret\n\nThe reason for the exceptionally mild weather was the brisk low-pressure activity over northern Europe, which resulted in a mild westerly current with incoming Atlantic air. The water temperatures in the North Atlantic are currently record warm for the time of year, meaning that the air masses that reached us from the west were a touch milder than usual. Climate change is therefore also playing a major role here.\n\nOn the way to one of the mildest February since measurements began\n\nThe mildest February to date was February 1990, with a deviation of 4.1 degrees compared to the long-term average from 1991 to 2020. So far, the deviation in this year's February is well above this value, according to the information above. It will remain mildly above average at least until the end of next week, even if temperatures in the north will be slightly lower than the current very high level from tomorrow Saturday (see here). It can already be said that February 2024 will certainly be too mild and will probably even be one of the mildest since measurements began. The last week of February in particular will be decisive for the surplus, as it looks set to be quite cool.\n\nClearly too dry in the north, clearly too wet in the south\n\nFebruary has been far too dry in the north so far, with hardly any precipitation in Valais in particular. The situation is quite different in the south, where the heavy precipitation event on February 9 and 10 resulted in a significant surplus in some areas (see Fig. 3, more than three times as much precipitation as normal in Stabio so far). Across Switzerland as a whole, there is currently a precipitation deficit of around 35%.\n\nFig. 3: Precipitation deviation to date in February compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nToo sunny in the swiss plateau, too cloudy elsewhere in many places\n\nSo far in February, there has been a surplus of sunshine on the swiss plateau, but a deficit in many other places. Across Switzerland, there is a small deficit of just under 5%. The surplus of sunshine on the swiss plateau is probably a result of the rare fog and high fog days so far this February.\n\nFig. 4: Previous deviation of sunshine duration in February compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET"
