        "text": "Introduction\n\nHumankind lives at the bottom of the sea of air, and climate change is perceived by us mainly as a change in the overall conditions of this sea's lower layers. The atmosphere lies at the heart of decade-to-century climate change: It filters the sun's rays as they reach the surface of the earth and as they are reflected again into outer space, and it is the principal medium of exchange of heat, water, trace-gases, and momentum between the other components of the climate system—oceans, land surface, snow, ice masses, and the biosphere. The atmosphere and ocean are intimately coupled within the climate system, and are governed by similar physical laws. But the atmosphere has been explored in greater detail—in terms of available observations and of existing models—than any other component of the climate system. Thus it is natural to review the results of this exploration first, as we begin our examination of climate variability.\n\nUnderstanding of natural phenomena proceeds through a sequence of observations, experiments, and models. Given the complexity of the climate system, laboratory experiments can reproduce only very incompletely the system's major aspects, and have not been included in the present volume. Atmospheric observations have led, in past centuries, to very simple, purely descriptive models of atmospheric motions. In the second half of this century, advanced computer models of the atmosphere have simultaneously benefited from an increase in the number and quality of observations, and stimulated vast field programs designed to verify model results and yield the new details necessary for improving the models. The separate treatment of observations and models in this chapter and the next is, therefore, only a matter of expository convenience.\n\nThe oldest instrumental records of atmospheric temperature—and, to some extent, precipitation—extend about 300 years into the past. The coverage and density of these measurements have grown more or less continuously, with a dramatic increase occurring in the 1940s and 1950s. This permits us to make a fairly informed assessment of past interannual variability, but we have considerably less confidence about interdecadal changes and only little or indirect information on the century-to-century time scale.\n\nThe Atmospheric Observations section below starts with a paper by H.F. Diaz and R.S. Bradley that addresses head-on the question of how different the climate of this century has been from those of previous ones. Proceeding from temperatures (which tend to be more uniform in space and time) to precipitation (which is considerably less so), S.E. Nicholson looks at the socioeconomically critical issue of African rainfall variability on interannual and decadal time scales. J. Shukla provides complementary insight on the initiation and persistence of drought in the Sahel.\n\nThe role of snow cover in the radiation balance at the surface makes it an important player in climate variability; this role is discussed by J.E. Walsh. Variability and trends of both liquid and solid precipitation over North America are reviewed by P.Ya. Groisman and D.R. Easterling. Returning to temperature, a careful study of the difference between trends in daily temperature maxima and minima is presented by T.R. Karl and his colleagues. C.D. Keeling and T.P. Whorf then analyze the decadal oscillations in global temperatures and in atmospheric carbon dioxide. These oscillations are at the heart of understanding natural variability on this time scale; they are also covered later in this section in the essay introducing atmospheric modeling.\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere has less instrumental coverage, in space and time, than the Northern Hemisphere. While many of the earlier papers in the section concentrate on the latter, D.J. Karoly describes the observed variability in the atmospheric circulation south of the equator.\n\nAtmosphere-ocean interaction is involved in the last two papers of this section. C. Deser and M.L. Blackmon review atmospheric climate variations at the surface of the North Atlantic, while D.R. Cayan and his associates study a general-circulation model simulation of the Pacific Ocean, driven by observed surface fluxes.\n\nAtmospheric models have a relatively long tradition in the climate community, going back to the 1950s. They span a spectrum, from simple radiative-convective models in one vertical dimension, through energy-balance models in one and two horizontal dimensions, to fully three-dimensional general-circulation models. These models are of interest in their own right as important tools for investigating climate change, either by themselves or coupled to models of other climate subsystems. They also provide an instructive example of the creation of a full suite of models for intercomparison and validation; their development is only now being followed, more or less closely, by the modeling enterprise in oceanography, hydrology, and other disciplines contributing to the climate-change enterprise.\n\nModeling and observations are closely linked by the reciprocal problems of simulating the observed variability and validating the existing models. The Atmospheric Modeling section is thus appropriately begun by T.M.L. Wigley's and S.C.B. Raper's paper on modeling and interpreting paleoclimate data, with an emphasis on the greenhouse effect. G.R. North and K.-Y. Kim apply classic time-series analysis techniques to climate-signal detection. R.S. Lindzen then considers a few themes in these two papers from complementary viewpoints.\n\nA number of causes for climate variability on time scales of decades to millennia are reviewed by D. Rind and J.T. Overpeck. They emphasize the modeling approach to a study of these causes, while J.M. Wallace addresses similar issues by analyzing the climate record.\n\nThe two sections of this chapter are introduced by essays, one by T.R. Karl and the other by M. Ghil. They provide an overview of the current state of the fields of atmospheric observations and atmospheric modeling, reviewing those topics not covered by the workshop and offering a perspective on the papers included. Following each paper, a commentary by the discussion leader and a condensation of the spirited discussion that took place at the workshop shed additional light on our current knowledge in both areas.\n\nThe ocean is examined in Chapter 3, and atmosphere-ocean interaction is explored further in Chapter 4. Also of interest are the proxy records of climate variability, such as tree rings and coral reefs, which are covered in Chapter 5. The sponsoring committee's conclusions, which draw on the material in this chapter and in the other three, appear in Chapter 6.\n\nAtmospheric Observations\n\nTHOMAS R. KARL\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the 1970s, the 1980s, and into the 1990s atmospheric scientists have accelerated research aimed toward identifying and explaining the presence of decade-to-century scale climate fluctuations. The motivation for special consideration of atmospheric climate fluctuations on these longer scales has its roots in the numerous major climate events whose occurrence is so well documented in the instrumental record. Probably the best-known of these fluctuations occurred about 1970, when rainfall suddenly decreased over the Sahel; the causes of this jump are discussed in this section by Nicholson (1995) and Shukla (1995). Other examples include the Dust Bowl years in North America during the 1930s, the diminished intensity of tropical storms affecting the East Coast of the United States during the 1960s, 1970s, and much of the 1980s, and the wet weather of the 1970s and 1980s over much of the United States.\n\nAs access to climate records has broadened during the past few decades, researchers such as Hurst (1957), Mandelbrot and Wallis (1969), Mitchell (1976), Douglas (1982), and Lorenz (1986) have presented evidence suggesting that the notion of a static climate is no longer tenable, even on less-than-geological time scales. We have come to realize that 30 years of data, the length of time that has been used to compute temperature and precipitation \"normals\" (Court, 1968), is inadequate to define climate. It does not provide us with sufficient information either to minimize adverse climate impacts within such sectors as energy, water supply, transportation, environmental quality, construction, agriculture, etc., or to maximize the availability of the climate-governed resources, such as water and energy, on which both natural and man-made systems depend.\n\nSeveral climate fluctuations that have affected the United States serve to illustrate this point. Beginning about 1975, the interannual variability of mean winter temperatures and total precipitation averaged across the contiguous United States substantially increased (Figures 1a and 1b); this increase persisted at least through 1985. In contrast, the interannual variability had been very low during the previous 20 years. The mean temperature increased dramatically over the United States during the 1930s, coincident with a large decrease in summer precipitation (Figures 1c and 1d), before returning to more typical conditions. The wetness of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, which is clearly evident in Figure 1e, resulted in record-setting high lake levels and caused considerable economic damage and human suffering (Changnon, 1987; Kay and Diaz, 1985). Over the past decade another climate fluctuation has been evident over the United States; as Figure 1f shows, temperatures increased in a jump-like fashion during the early 1980s. Interestingly, the temperature discontinuity that is apparent between January and June is not reflected by the temperatures during the second half of the year.\n\nDue to the limited span of the instrumental climate record, evidence for climate fluctuations on decade-to-century time scales is biased toward higher frequencies. (The situation is much worse in the oceans; as Wunsch (1992) points out, the absence of comprehensive oceanographic data has led many oceanographers to focus on identi-\n\nthe observations used to study climate fluctuations are derived from observing programs that were developed not for this purpose, but rather to support day-to-day weather forecasting. Since the day-to-day variability of the atmospheric system in much of the world is far larger than the decadal climate variability, identification of multi-decadal climate fluctuations is often hampered by the poor quality and lack of homogeneity of the observations. For example, Groisman and Easterling (1995), in their study of the variability and trends of precipitation over North America, painstakingly document the many discontinuities and false jumps in the climate record that arise from changes in observing practices. These changes, if ignored, can and do overwhelm important long-term precipitation fluctuations.\n\nOther atmospheric quantities besides precipitation are also affected by problems in measurement. In this section, Robinson (1995) points out the large disparity in snow-cover extent between a NASA data set using microwave measurements and a NOAA data set using visible imagery. Karl et al. (1995) devote considerable discussion to jumps and trends introduced into the surface temperature record by such factors as urban heat islands, changes in irrigation practices, differences in instrumentation, and station relocations. Cayan et al. (1995) use surface marine observations to calculate the latent and sensible heat fluxes that are used as forcing agents of the sea surface temperature field in the North Pacific. Their analysis includes the basin-wide climate jump that began about 1976-1977. To account for known systematic biases related to trends in the wind field and the sea surface and marine air-temperature and moisture lapse rates (Ward, 1992; Cardone et al., 1990; Wright, 1988; Ramage, 1987), the global trend of each of these quantities is removed. As mentioned in Zebiak's commentary on Cayan's paper, it is unfortunate that such adjustments to the data are necessary.\n\nOften the corrections and adjustments that must be applied to a climate record are of such magnitude that it is difficult to be confident that the resulting time series adequately reflects the climate fluctuations. For example, Figure 2 illustrates the significant adjustments required to calculate global temperature fluctuations since the nineteenth century. Through the use of other data bases (e.g., changes in snow cover, alpine glaciers, or sea level) and the isolation of various components of the surface temperature record (e.g., marine air temperature, sea surface temperature, and land temperature), it is possible to gain more confidence in the adjustments applied. Each of the data sets has distinctly different problems related to long-term homogeneity and data quality that require independent adjustment procedures. When these independent data sets provide a physically consistent picture of decade-to-century climate fluctuations, their agreement can be very compelling. In fact, the analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations of surface winds, pressure, and ocean and marine air temperatures\n\nby Deser and Blackmon (1995) relies entirely on physical consistency among independent variables.\n\nIn order to improve our ability to discern climate fluctuations on decade-to-century time scales within the existing climate record, some federal agencies such as NSF, DOE, and NOAA are supporting data archeology efforts. Data archeology is the process of seeking out, restoring, correcting, and interpreting data sets. Such efforts are critical to identifying and understanding longer-scale climate fluctuations, since they often turn up information that reveals a pattern not otherwise obvious.\n\nThe Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), which is just one of several major data-archeology efforts, provides a good example of the type of benefits that can be expected from such efforts. Now, several years after the project's inception (Woodruff et al., 1987), scientists are identifying decadal-scale variations and changes in many climate elements previously thought to be too uncertain to document with any confidence (London et al., 1991; Flohn et al., 1990; Parungo et al., 1994).\n\nInterestingly, up to the present, satellite data have not figured prominently in the analysis of multi-decadal climate variability. Their short observing history and a lack of temporal homogeneity have hampered efforts to use them. Certainly, there are notable exceptions, such as NOAA's snow and sea-ice products and the Spencer and Christy (1990) microwave sounding-unit data. However, major temporal inhomogeneities in data sets, like those identified in the International Satellite Cloud Cover Project (ISCCP; see Klein and Hartmann, 1993), threaten the usefulness of much of the multi-decadal satellite data. The two major challenges over the next few decades for the United States will to be to ensure that global-change satellite-research projects such as EOS provide homogeneous data over their planned life-\n\ntimes, and to lay the foundation for converting them into a long-term operational observing systems.\n\nFuture observations will require more attention to data quality, homogeneity, and continuity if we are to understand the nature of decade-to-century-scale climate variability. Currently under consideration is a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)1 that includes observations of terrestrial, atmospheric, and oceanic aspects of climate. Since GCOS would be built around existing observing networks and environmental problems, it is essential that scientists effectively convey long-term climate-monitoring needs to the agencies sponsoring space-based and conventional observing systems. Among the climate-monitoring issues that should be addressed in the near future are stability of network sites, intercomparability of instruments, and increased sampling in data-sparse regions. Two concerns for both present and future observations are the better collection and documentation of metadata on observing instruments and practices as well as processing algorithms, and improved data-archiving practices and data-management systems. All these will increase the value of climate monitoring for decade-to-century-scale research; most essential, of course, is assurance of a long-term commitment to observational objectives.\n\nTHE FORCING AGENTS OF CLIMATE FLUCTUATIONS\n\nThe climate record provides the key to developing, refining, and verifying our hypotheses regarding the forcing agents responsible for climate fluctuations, be they anthropogenic or natural, internal or external to the climate system, global or regional, or persisting one or many decades. Diaz and Bradley (1995) suggest that the many decade-to-century climate fluctuations evident in both observations and proxy records may indeed have natural origins, since similar fluctuations seem to occur in the climate record both before and after humans became capable of modifying climate.\n\nOften physically based models are the best means of testing our hypotheses about the cause of the fluctuations, as described in the modeling sections of this volume, but in addition they can be effectively used to help discern the physical consistency of apparent climate fluctuations and change. Cayan et al. (1995) demonstrate this approach; they use an ocean general-circulation model to help explain the climate jump over the North Pacific, as documented by Trenberth (1990; Trenberth and Hurrell, 1995, in this volume). Cayan et al. show how the atmosphere and ocean can act together to maintain decadal-scale climate fluctuations on a large spatial scale.\n\nPotentially important factors in explaining climate fluctuations on decade-to-century time scales are land-surface and atmospheric feedback effects. Walsh (1995) provides ample evidence that snow cover has important feedback effects on the climate system on short (daily and interannual) and long (thousands of years) time scales, but on the time scales of interest to us the impact of snow is still not well understood. However, Nicholson (1995) and Shukla (1995) present evidence that the feedback between land-surface characteristics and the atmosphere has led to the prolonged drought in the Sahel. Karl et al. (1995) document an asymmetric increase of the mean maximum and minimum temperatures over many portions of the global land mass. Although they cite a number of potential causes of this multi-decadal trend, such as increases of anthropogenic atmospheric sulfate aerosols (Charlson et al., 1992) and greenhouse gases, empirical evidence suggests that, at least in some regions, observed increases in cloud cover play an important role in modulating the surface temperature. The forcing responsible for the increase in cloud cover remains unknown.\n\nThere are many important aspects of climate forcings and associated responses that cannot be covered here. Of particular relevance are the known changes in solar irradiance associated with the sunspot cycle. Recently Friis-Christensen and Lassen (1991) have used the length of the sunspot cycle to explain the decadal fluctuations and trends of land temperatures. Although a linear response of the surface temperature to the sunspot cycle length implies some unlikely responses of the temperature record in the early part of the time series (Kelly and Wigley, 1992), it is clear that changes in solar irradiance must continue to be monitored as a potential source of global climate fluctuations or change.\n\nRecently, Elliott et al. (1991) have found evidence for an increase of tropospheric water vapor since 1973, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect. However, the many types of observing and data-processing inhomogeneities in the upper-air moisture record make it immensely difficult to separate spurious trends and discontinuities from the true climate signal, even when the signal may be as large as a 10 percent increase in specific humidity.\n\nA critical atmospheric quantity affecting surface temperature is the variability of cloud cover—its type, height, and spatial distribution. Using the ISCCP data base, Hartmann et al. (1992) showed the net forcing of various cloud types as a function of season and latitude. A recent study by Rossow (1995), however, reveals that this data set has serious biases that make it inappropriate for decadal-scale climate assessments. Meanwhile, conventional in situ data, analyzed on a national basis by a number of researchers, show a widespread general increase in total cloud cover\n\nover the past several decades (Dutton et al., 1991; Henderson-Sellers, 1990; Karl and Steurer, 1990; London et al., 1991; McGuffie and Henderson-Sellers, 1989; Parungo et al., 1994). Clearly, a much more focused effort is required to better understand decadal and multi-decadal fluctuations of cloud cover, since they often have very important feedback effects on other climate quantities. For instance, cloud feedbacks work differently during the day from the way they do at night. They therefore differ at high and low latitudes, making generalizations speculative.\n\nAlso, there is no discussion in this volume of the world's glaciers, in spite of their known tendency to fluctuate markedly on decade-to-century time scales. Long-term trends of climate change are integrated by mountain glaciers, and during the past century mountain glaciers all over the world have been declining (IPCC, 1990). The World Glacier Monitoring Service (1993) summarized these changes over the past several decades, and the USGS Satellite Image Atlas of the World discusses observed variations of hundreds of glaciers over the past several centuries.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIdentification and explanation of the forcings and feedbacks responsible for decade-to-century-scale climate fluctuations are essential to distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic impacts on the climate system, as well as to developing any predictive skill with respect to these phenomena. Further progress in understanding this gray area of climate change will depend upon our ability to address three topics. First, we must be able to document climate fluctuations without spurious discontinuities and trends. Second, we must ensure that we are adequately monitoring potential forcings and feedbacks internal and external to the climate system, so that we will have the data necessary for testing hypotheses about their operation. Last, data analysts must work closely with modelers (and vice versa) to test the hypotheses we formulate on a variety of climate models, ranging from simple one-dimensional climate models to complex coupled ocean-atmosphere general-circulation models. The re-analysis modeling projects of the United States (Kalnay and Jenne, 1991) and the European community are likely to enhance our confidence in both how and why climate has varied on decade-to-century time scales. (It must be emphasized, however, that the value of any re-analysis effort can be jeopardized by the use of data that are biased or, most troublesome, inhomogeneous in time.) Only by advancing in all three of these areas will we be able to overcome our ignorance about multi-decadal climate fluctuations and make predictions with any degree of assurance.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nConsiderable effort has been expended over the last 25 years to improve our knowledge and understanding of climate processes and mechanisms associated with changes in climate (Saltzman, 1983; Trenberth, 1992). A major impetus for much of the recent climate research has been the global and regional climate projections made with physical climate models (the so-called general-circulation models, or GCMs) for a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nMost assessments of the climatic impact of increases in the ''greenhouse\" gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons) have concluded, more or less consistently, that global temperatures should rise (under a doubling of the most abundant of these greenhouse gases, CO2) from 1.5°C to 4.5°C (NRC, 1982; Bolin et al., 1986; IPCC, 1990; Schlesinger, 1984, 1991). Such changes, should they occur, will be superimposed on the natural variability of the climate, which is quite large at all time scales (Karl et al., 1989). Depending on a number of assumptions, the amount of global warming that should have been realized by now appears to be more consistent with the lower end of the above estimates (Bloomfield, 1992).\n\nKarl et al. (1991b) performed a variety of tests using output from three different GCMs to ascertain, given their different climate sensitivities, when a statistically significant greenhouse signal might be detected in the central United States. They concluded that it was likely that a greenhouse signal had been masked, to date, by natural climate variability, and that it would likely take another two to four decades before the greenhouse signal in temperature and precipitation might be unambiguously detected in this region.\n\nWe should note the possibility that other human-induced factors may be acting to counteract the radiative effects of increased greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Recent work has indicated that sulfate aerosols, which act to increase the planetary albedo (Charlson et al., 1992; Hansen and Lacis, 1990; Wigley, 1989, 1991) may have counteracted to some degree the enhanced infrared warming (see Michaels and Stooksbury, 1992). These and other factors, whether anthropogenic in origin or not (e.g., changes in vulcanism), will undoubtedly \"muddy\" the climate picture and may make it more difficult to identify unequivocally a contemporary greenhouse signal.\n\nIn this paper, we consider two aspects of climate-change detection that we feel bear strongly on the issue of natural versus anthropogenic climate variability. One aspect of the problem is, in effect, at what point one rejects the null hypothesis (no climate change) and accepts the premise that the climate of the last few decades belongs to a different sample population. The difficulty there arises because we are evaluating a relatively short observational record with the knowledge that the climate has fluctuated in the past few centuries by an amount that may be of the same magnitude as the fluctuations observed in the recent record (see Bradley and Jones, 1992).\n\nA second aspect of the problem of climate change versus natural variability, which we consider here, is temporal changes in that variability, i.e., in the variance. Changes in climatic variability are important, since they are likely to have a greater effect on a society's ability to mitigate and adapt to climatic changes than a slow alteration in the mean climate patterns. We have examined a variety of observational records of various lengths (typically 100 to 150 years), which are representative of different spatial scales (from hemispheric to regional basins). We will focus on decadal time scales, since one could argue that climatic changes will be better gauged at time scales that to some extent average out the high-frequency climatic \"noise\" associated with seasonal variability and other air-sea processes operating on annual time scales (e.g., the El Niño/ Southern Oscillation system). We compare these instrumental series with a suite of high-resolution climate proxy records—namely, tree rings and oxygen isotopes extracted from ice cores—spanning the last 300 to 800 years. Our aim is to give the reader some feeling for the range of this intermediate-frequency (decade-to-century-scale) climatic variability, as well as some appreciation of the uncertainties inherent in the existing records (instrumental, historical, and paleoenvironmental).\n\nWe note that the \"fingerprint\" climate-change-detection technique (Barnett, 1986; Barnett and Schlesinger, 1987; Barnett et al., 1991) provides a very useful methodology for testing a hypothesis (the GCM climate-change projections) against observations. We will attempt here to highlight some aspects of climatic variability at decadal and longer time scales and will re-emphasize the conclusion of Barnett et al. (1991), who noted that the existence of a high degree of \"unexplained\" interdecadal climatic variability (see also Ghil and Vautard, 1991, and Karl et al., 1991b) will greatly complicate the detection of a greenhouse climate-change signal.\n\nTHE MODERN (INSTRUMENTAL) RECORD\n\nCharacteristics of Decadal-Scale Changes of Area-Mean Temperature Indices\n\nThe available data suggest that during the past century decadal-scale changes in global-scale mean annual temperature are on the order of 0.1°C to 0.3°C (see Folland et al., 1990). Figure 1 illustrates the annual and seasonal temperature changes for the Northern Hemisphere land areas. The plotted data, from Jones et al. (1986a) with subsequent updates, are consecutive 10-year area-weighted averages from 1891-1900 through 1981-1990 of gridded temperature anomalies referenced to the 1951-1970 period. On this \"dec-\n\nadal\" time scale, the warming of the 1980s relative to the 1970s (0.32°C for the hemisphere) is comparable to the warming that occurred in the 1920s relative to temperatures in the 1910s (0.26°C). Some seasonal differences can be noted, with northern summer and fall showing the least warming trend and winter and spring showing the greatest warming trend over the last 100 years.\n\nThe twentieth century contains many examples of decadal-scale climatic variations of sufficient magnitude to have significantly affected societies. The two-decade-long drought in the African Sahel is perhaps the best-known example. The words \"climate change\" have become overused, and climatic variations from seasonal to multi-year are often lumped together. Until the mid-1970s, \"climate change\" was used to refer to climatic changes on time scales of 104 to 106 years (essentially, Milankovitch time-scales). Variations of less than 10 years were generally considered to be part of the natural climate noise associated with interannual variations of the various components of the climate system and their nonlinear interactions, whereas variations on time scales of 10 to 103 years are now thought to be strongly driven by ocean-atmosphere heat exchanges resulting from changes in the ocean's thermohaline circulation.\n\nBecause of the changes in the earth's radiative balance imposed by human activities during the past century, climatologists have been trying to detect climatic-change signals that hitherto have typically been associated with time scales of millennia. The climate record available for such studies, even with the aid of high-resolution paleoenvironmental records, is sufficient to define only continental to hemispheric changes on decadal time scales, and perhaps regional (less than about 105 km2) changes on century time scales.\n\nIn the United States, perhaps the singular climatic event of this century was the severe, widespread, and persistent drought of the 1930s. This event has been widely chronicled in both scientific (e.g., Skaggs, 1975) and popular literature. Other climatic events that persisted for more than one year and affected relatively large areas of the United States were the drought of the 1950s in south central areas of the United States (Chang and Wallace, 1987), and the drought of the 1960s in the Northeast (Namias, 1966). Periodic drought of variable duration has affected all areas of the contiguous United States to varying degrees (Diaz, 1983). Indeed, multiyear climate anomalies are a characteristic feature of the climate of the United States and of other parts of the world (Karl, 1988; Folland et al., 1990).\n\nIn Figure 2, decadal-mean seasonal (December-February for winter, March-May for spring, etc.) and annual temperature anomalies for various areas of the Northern Hemisphere are examined. Although Eurasia and North America (Figure 2a) have broadly similar seasonal trends over this period, differences can be noted in all seasons as well as in the annual averages. Figure 2b illustrates decadal temperature changes for the contiguous United States for the last century. The data used are from the adjusted divisional values (solid curve) described in Karl et al. (1984b). For comparison, the equivalent Jones et al. (1986a) gridded values are given as the dashed curve in Figure 2b. The decadal averages for the lower 48 states exhibit much smaller long-term trends than those noted for the continental-scale regions. Figures 2c and 2d illustrate the decadal temperature changes recorded in subregions of the United States, namely, the eastern and western halves of the United States (divided roughly along the 100th meridian), the state of Colorado, and a single state climatic division in Colorado where the city of Boulder is located. Again we note regional differences that can depart substantially from the temporal behavior of the larger spatial averages.\n\nWe have tabulated the mean temperature change from one calendar decade to the next over the 100-year period 1891 to 1990 for each of the above regions. No particular pattern emerges, except that at the largest space scales, the greatest decade-to-decade warming occurs mostly from the 1970s to the 1980s, whereas the time of the largest such\n\nchanges varies for the smaller regional averages, with most areas of the contiguous United States experiencing their greatest decadal changes during the first half of this century.\n\nRecent studies have documented some rather pronounced and relatively rapid shifts in the climate system that occurred on decadal time scales. In particular, the atmospheric circulation in the extratropical North Pacific underwent a major shift in the mid-1970s that lasted over 10 years (Trenberth, 1990; Ebbesmeyer et al., 1991). This change was accompanied by a tendency for climate patterns in the tropical Pacific to exhibit conditions reminiscent of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm-event conditions—weaker trades, warmer equatorial sea surface temperature (SST), anomalous rainfall patterns, etc.—relatively more frequently than during previous decades. Gordon et al. (1992) have also reviewed some of the relatively abrupt changes in water properties and surface climate in the Atlantic Ocean that have occurred in the past several decades, including sudden changes in SST anomalies in the South Atlantic compared to those of the North Atlantic, and the so-called \"great salinity anomaly\" in the North Atlantic from about the late 1960s to the early 1980s (Dickson et al., 1988). Certainly the sudden decrease of rainfall in the Sahel of Africa, a feature that has lasted for two decades, is a good example of how the climate can undergo significant, sudden, and prolonged change over relatively large spatial scales.\n\nClearly, increased knowledge of the behavior of climatic variability, from the interannual through decadal and century time scales, is needed to improve our assessments of any future changes in climate from regional to global scales. Indeed, as was noted by Ghil and Vautard (1991), the ability to distinguish a warming trend from natural variability is critical for separating out the greenhouse-gas-induced signal.\n\nAs we noted at the outset, an important element of climate that is too often overlooked is the variance or the characteristic variability of climatic means. In determining climate impacts, the importance to society of short- to medium-term climatic instability (i.e., climate fluctuations occurring on interannual to interdecadal time scales) is perhaps equal to or greater than that of slow changes in the background mean. Below we have analyzed some aspects of low-frequency changes in the temperature variance of different regional means.\n\nChanges in Temperature Variability\n\nWe have examined contemporaneous variation of two measures of temperature variability, the standard deviation in running 15-year segments, and decadal means of the root-mean-square differences between successive yearly values of seasonal and annual regional temperature anomalies. The latter index is defined as\n\nSince the xi are deviations from a reference mean and have approximately zero mean,\n\nwhere s2 is the series variance, and r1 is the autocorrelation of the time series with a lag of I year. We will use this measure, rather than the standard deviation, as the key index of interannual variability. Note that this index, Ind V, amplifies changes in the high-frequency part of the variance spectrum.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 illustrate the changes in the interannual variability of the regional groupings discussed earlier. The curves differ from one season to another and from one region to another. For the largest continental-sized regions, there appears to be an increase in interannual variability in the last couple of decades. At smaller spatial scales, there does not seem to be a consistent trend; instead, the interan-\n\nnual variability wanes and waxes over the last 100 years. The corresponding curves for the standard deviation (not shown) reveal similar patterns, with increases in variance at the largest spatial scales with time but no consistent trends in the standard deviation of the smaller regions. As one would expect, there is a well-defined log-linear relationship between the magnitude of the interannual variability and the size of the area comprised by the various indices (see Figure 5). The inherently higher variability at smaller regional scales should be kept in mind when interpreting the paleoclimate record, which is based on limited regional samples.\n\nThe question of whether a warming climate will exhibit increased short-term variability is still open. Previous studies have been generally inconclusive on this subject (van Loon and Williams, 1978; Diaz and Quayle, 1980). Certainly, there is no consistent relationship between interdecadal changes in average temperatures and interdecadal changes in variability. Climatic variability may increase, decrease, or stay the same, in response to an arbitrary change in decadal mean temperatures. On the basis of the above results, we can say that, considering surface temperature variations during the last century, there has been a recent increase in variability at large spatial scales (continental to hemispheric-scale averages). This increase in variability is also concurrent with relatively large temperature increases over those areas. However, this is not the case for earlier warming episodes.\n\nTHE PRE-INSTRUMENTAL PERIOD\n\nPrior to the late 1800s, reliable quantitative data on climate variations are sparse, and conclusions about the magnitude of these changes on large spatial scales necessarily contain significant degrees of uncertainty. There is ample evidence that multi-decadal temperature changes occurring over regions the size of Europe and China have been at least of order 1°C (Bradley and Jones, 1992). This suggests that it is quite plausible, if not likely, that temperatures as warm as those prevailing since the end of the Second World War may have been experienced at regional spatial scales of about 105 to 106 km2 for periods of one to several decades during some portions of the past thousand years under what amounts to natural (i.e., with negligible human influences) conditions.\n\nBelow we present some examples of long-term variability in a set of climate-sensitive paleotemperature records. The climate indices used here are discussed in several chapters of Bradley and Jones (1992). A listing of them, together with the source references and periods of record, appears in Table 1; each of them has been assigned a number for use in later tables comparing their data. Because of its very long record, the instrumental temperature series for central England (Manley, 1974) is considered in this section for comparison with other paleoclimate indices.\n\nTree-Ring Indicators\n\nThere is an extensive body of work relating climate variations to growth changes in particularly climate-sensitive trees (e.g., Fritts, 1976; Fritts et al., 1979; Hughes et al., 1982; Cook and Kairiukstis, 1990). We have selected a suite of climate-sensitive tree-ring records to study possible changes in climatic variability. Two main considerations were applied in the selection of these indices. First, we chose\n\nand Kariukstis). Verification is usually done against an independent set of predictors. The reader is urged to review the reference sources listed in Table 1 for specific details regarding each paleotemperature reconstruction.\n\nAnother feature of long-term reconstructions from tree rings that should be borne in mind is that the composition of tree-ring samples that make up each yearly value is variable. In general, an index value for a given site is composed of a number of tree samples from several individual trees. These may vary in age, and in some cases may come from both dead as well as living trees. The number of samples making a particular ensemble average will vary with time, although this is more generally the case near the beginning and end of a particular chronology. These extraneous factors can introduce \"noise\" and spurious fluctuations into the reconstructions. Nevertheless, the tree-ring indices considered here, while suffering to varying degree from the above-named shortcomings, comprise a high-quality set of proxy temperature records that are of value to compare.\n\nFigures 6 through 8 show decadal-mean values of various tree-ring reconstructions, generally representing summer (or growing-season) mean temperature. For the most part, these tree-ring reconstructions do not sample the 1980s; nevertheless, it is clear from the degree of interdecadal variability that it would be hard to point to any particular recent period as being unique or exceptional. The November-to-April\n\ntemperature reconstruction for Tasmania (Cook et al., 1992) does indicate that the last two decades of that record (1970s and 1980s) exhibit significantly greater tree growth (Figure 8) and hence higher reconstructed mean growing-season temperatures than previously, but it would seem premature to conclude that a \"climatic change\" has taken place in this region of southern Australia. We also note that, unlike the North American and Scandinavian reconstructions, this one is based on tree samples from only one location.\n\nSome unique features are evident for a few of the temperature indices. For example, the curve of D'Arrigo and Jacoby (1992) is a reconstruction of annual mean temperature based on several sites along the northern North America treeline, stretching from Alaska to the Northwest Territories, plus a site located in northern Quebec Province. This reconstruction exhibits a pronounced warming from a very cold period during the mid-1800s to a maximum around 1940. By comparison, the two other high-northern-latitude sites discussed here—the indices from northern Scandinavia and from the northern Urals (Figure 7)—do not exhibit quite the same type of variations. The reader should note, however, that a much longer time period is sampled by these other two reconstructions, and that a seasonal (April to August for the Tornetrask index, and June to July for the\n\nnorthern Urals set) interval rather than annual periods is considered.\n\nThe two summer temperature reconstructions for South America (Figure 8) are of widely different lengths. A comparison of the overlap period indicates that the Boninsegna series (see Table 1) exhibits a warming trend over the period of record. By contrast, the longer Villalba series exhibits some low-frequency variations but little if any trend over both the full data period and that of the Boninsegna period, beginning about the mid-fifteenth century.\n\nBecause of the longer record available, a variability index (described in the section on instrumental data above) was computed using the decadal averages, instead of the annual values. Our purpose here is to examine interdecadal temperature variability, with records spanning several centuries, noting that climate-sensitive tree-ring records are particularly useful for studying decadal-scale climatic fluctuations (Fritts, 1991). The changes in reconstructed climatic vari-\n\nability have been summarized on a century-by-century basis in Table 2. For comparison, we also show in Table 3 the mean values of interannual and interdecadal variability for the full-length record. The variability index was calculated by applying equation (1) to both the annual and decadal-average reconstructed series. We fail to see any consistent trends in interdecadal variability associated with these tree-ring temperature reconstructions (see indices 5-9, 12-13, and 16-18 in Table 2). Interdecadal variability is typically about half the interannual values. This implies that substantial low-frequency variance is present in the paleotemperature record, so that recent high values of reconstructed decadal-mean summer temperature may yet represent an oscillation within the range of natural variability.\n\nOxygen Isotopes\n\nThe oxygen-isotope record has not been directly calibrated against temperature, as has been done for the tree-ring record. However, it is well established that the oxygen-isotope ratio (d18O) is dependent primarily on the temperature of formation of the precipitation, with increasingly negative d18O ratios associated with decreasing temperature. The problems lie in the interpretation of a local ice-core record, not only with respect to local temperature variations, but even in terms of the larger-scale temperature patterns. Several factors control the oxygen-isotope composition of the snow that falls on a given ice body, and temperature is only one of them. The sensitivity of these records to annual temperature variations has been discussed in a number of papers, including the source articles referred to in Table 1. Whether or not these oxygen-isotope records accurately represent a \"local\" temperature record, we consider them to be sensitive indicators of prevailing climatic conditions within a suitably broad source region. Since our stated purpose is to compare recent changes in a suite of climate-sensitive paleoindicators, we have included them in our comparisons.\n\nFigures 9 and 10 illustrate the changes in decadal averages of the oxygen-isotope ratio of glacier ice cores for different locations in northern Canada and Greenland, and for two low-latitude, high-elevation glaciers (the Quelccaya ice cap in the Peruvian Andes and the Dunde ice cap in the Tibetan Plateau region of China (see Table 1 for sources)). The polar ice d18O record, which ends before 1970, shows relatively less warming (trend toward smaller negative values of d18O) than do the tropical ice cores. Furthermore, the warmest decades in the tropical record occur in the most recent time. The relation of this tropical d18O signal to air-temperature changes in the general location of these records may be partially evaluated with independent observations. It is known that significant melting took place at the Quelccaya site during the 1980s (Thompson, personal communication). Increases in tropospheric\n\ntemperatures and water vapor obtained with tropical radiosondes for the past couple of decades have been documented by Flohn et al. (1992), although the drift toward less negative d18O ratios appears to have begun earlier in the ice-core record than in the instrumental climate record.\n\nChanges in interdecadal variability are summarized in Table 2 (see indices 1-4 and 14-15). There is a suggestion that decade-to-decade changes in d18O ratios have increased in amplitude at most of these sites. In particular, the calculated interdecadal d18O variability at Quelccaya has increased sharply in the last 100 years. This increase is evident even though the greater number of samples in the upper part of the record permitted better averages to be created for the recent decades than for earlier periods. A similar signal is apparent on the Dunde ice cap as well. These changes, however, may reflect a more localized temperature signal, changes in moisture sources for snowfall on the ice caps, or some other unknown cause unrelated to climate. It should also be noted that these two sites are located at very high elevations, and thus differ from most of the other\n\npaleoclimate indices, which are derived from locations at much lower elevations.\n\nCentral England Temperature\n\nDecadal means of winter (December-to-January) and summer (June-to-August) mean temperature for central England (Manley, 1974, and subsequent updates) from 1700 to present are shown in Figure 11. The recent decades do not appear to be exceptional in comparison with the total record. The variability curves (not shown) indicate little overall change, with a tendency for the summer and winter seasons to have opposite changes in interdecadal variability (when one increases, the other tends to decrease). Jones and Bradley (1992, their Figure 13.1) have compared the central England temperature record with 12 other long-period station records in Eurasia and North America. Although there are obvious differences among the various climatic series, the twentieth century does not stand out as being a period of higher decadal-scale temperature variability. Most records (although not all) do exhibit the general warming trend of the past two centuries that is associated with the rebound from the Little Ice Age (see Bradley and Jones, 1992).\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the climate in recent decades was ''changing,\" both with regard\n\nto its mean value as well as with respect to changes in the variance on different time scales. Our findings are mostly mixed, in that the answer depends on the spatial scales selected for analysis.\n\nFor the period encompassing the last 100 years, changes in surface air temperature have been greatest and most positive in the period 1970 to 1990. Interannual variability at the largest spatial scales has also increased, although with seasonal differences. By and large, however, increases in variability at these spatial scales are not unique. When one considers smaller regions (in particular different portions of the contiguous United States) the picture changes, so that the 1980s do not necessarily show up as being a unique period in the instrumental climate history of the country.\n\nIn order to have a longer perspective on climatic variations, we utilized data from several paleoclimatic reconstructions of growing-season temperature based on tree-ring records and on d18O ratios extracted from different ice-core records. Data from the latter were also taken as a measure of the prevailing air temperature. Annual values were averaged by calendar decades in order to focus on lower-frequency climatic variability. With the exception of the tropical ice cores, the recent decades were not generally unique, in terms of either the average values or increased variability. We note that tropical sea surface temperatures have been generally above the long-term mean since the mid-1970s. It seems plausible that this recent warmth would be reflected in low (less depleted) d18O ratios on the Quelccaya and Dunde ice caps, although more positive d18O ratios were already evident by the 1950s. It should be emphasized again that the exact relationship between actual past climate and these two high-elevation tropical indices is not fully known. Certainly, the period encompassed by the Little Ice Age is reflected in relatively low d18O values, particularly in the Quelccaya record.

Thompson and colleagues should help in the interpretation of the nature of the climate signals present in these records (e.g., Thompson et al., 1995).\n\nDo we have an answer to the question posed by the title of this study, namely, whether the climate of the twentieth century is different from that of previous centuries? Obviously, the response is not an unequivocal \"yes\" or \"no.\" As in most instances when one deals with climatic time series, the answer is \"It depends.\" There appear to be differences in regional responses, and they are evident in both the proxy and the instrumental climate records. Insofar as the United States is concerned, the most unusual decade of the last 100 years may have been the 1930s, although the recent period is probably a close second. We can only say that, for most areas of the coterminous United States, the climate of the most recent decades cannot be considered unique, even in the context of the last century.\n\nCommentary on the Paper of Diaz and Bradley\n\nEUGENE M. RASMUSSON\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\nWhen Drs. Diaz and Bradley present a paper, it always provides an enormous amount of information. The central question, in terms of a synthesis of the wealth of information provided in this paper, is the question posed by the title: \"How different is the climate of the twentieth century\"—more specifically the past few decades—\"from that of earlier centuries?\" In addressing this question the authors examined temperature, decade-to-decade temperature changes, and changes in interannual and interdecadal variability on various spatial scales.\n\nThe problem in any analysis of this type, of course, is that of inadequate data distribution in time and space. Thus, the analysis was largely limited to the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, where both instrumental and proxy data are most plentiful.\n\nIt may be well to note that changes in the spatial distribution of observations from decade to decade may affect both the computed area average and the variability. Figure 10 in my paper, which appears later, illustrates the effects of using different data distributions in synthesizing global averages of SST, where the problem is probably more severe than it is over the land areas.\n\nFigure 1 in this commentary also shows estimates of the variability in SST obtained from two different analysis schemes. Two estimates of variability are obtained. One is from the optimal averaging (OA) analysis technique of Vinnikov et al., and I think Dr. Groisman will tell us about that one. Another is derived from the simple box average that has been used—for example, by the U.K. Meteorological Office—in deriving SST area averages. The curves in Figure 10 of my paper show the low-frequency variations, i.e., periods longer than 30 years. There are some differences, but they are not too great, about 0.15 degrees around 1910 and 1920, with the OA staying a little bit closer to the mean for the entire period. Now, if we remove the low-frequency variations so that only the variations on time scales less than 30 years remain (Figure 1 in this commentary), and look at that difference between the two analysis schemes, we see that the level of higher-frequency variability may also depend on the first guess used. The box method and the OA with the previous month as the first guess are similar, but the OA with climatology as a first guess shows less variability during the earlier decades of the series. Thus, relative to the box method, the OA shows an increasing variability with time. This comparison illustrates that one\n\nmust be a bit careful in deriving conclusions about changes in variability from area averages. The estimates of variability may be sensitive to changes in data distribution and the particular analysis scheme used.\n\nData limitations become extremely severe when one attempts to quantify natural variability on decade-to-century time scales from proxy records. What information can we really derive regarding the patterns of large-scale variability from widely scattered proxy measurements? I think that further effort is required in two areas to maximize and better quantify the information content of the entire climate data base, both instrumental and proxy. First, we need more studies along the lines of data system tests. More specifically, using the more dense data distribution of recent decades, we should determine the loss of information as the distribution of observations is decreased. This will help establish confidence limits for estimates of large-scale averages based on the sparse distribution of observations and proxy series obtained during earlier decades and centuries.\n\nSecond, we need to place more emphasis on integration of information from various proxy sources, with the goal of obtaining a better picture of the pattern of global variability during earlier centuries. This is admittedly a formidable task when one is dealing with decade-to-century time scales. I do not believe that the concept of an overall integration of information in decade-to-century variations has yet to take root in the proxy community, but I think it should be strongly encouraged as a long-term goal.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGROISMAN: Two quick comments, one for Gene and one for Henry. Gene, I just wanted to note that the SST variability does not reflect conditions over the Arctic. There is about a 25 percent difference in amplitude between SST and marine air temperature over the open ocean, the latter being higher, so there may be other reasons for the difference you cite. Henry, the problem with tree rings is that there are very few 1000-year-old trees, so in a time series you can't resolve the same mean variance.\n\nDIAZ: I used only air temperature over land, no SSTs. Also, I started in 1891, when we had fairly good coverage. The changes in data distribution don't have much influence on the large-scale averages. As for the tree rings, we did try to compensate by looking at decadal means and interdecadal variability, and I don't think the middle section has much of a problem.\n\nKEELING: I have a figure that is based on the Jones-Wigley temperature record, with a slightly different smoothing. Some of the early variability and the apparent biennial signal are probably the result of sparse data; beginning in 1951 the record is fairly homogeneous. You can see the 1958, 1961, 1963, 1982 El Niños. I'd like to know whether there is some difference in the quantity of data, or in its processing now that satellite data and ground data are being mixed, that has changed data variability in the last decade.\n\nTRENBERTH: Perhaps when you fit the spline you are taking out more of the variance at the end.\n\nGHIL: Henry, I was puzzled by the apparently much higher interdecadal variability in the second of your first two tree-ring figures.\n\nJONES: It's partly due to the indexing procedure that there is more low-frequency variance in the top curve than the bottom one, though some of it could be real. KARL: It's important to remember that there are many different ways to classify variability. I suspect that I could show more or less of it just by defining it differently. On this particular figure, I think we need to be aware that one is for a longer season than the other, and the shorter period of a time series will give you higher variability.\n\nDIAZ: Another point is that getting longer time series from proxy records may not improve our understanding of climate change mechanisms.\n\nGROOTES: I want to comment on the Quelccaya ice-core records you used. As you go down from the surface, the seasonal cycle disappears. It reappears about 1880 and continues significant to about 1480. Apparently when there are low values the record is smoothed so little that the seasonal cycle is preserved. As temperature changes it becomes more difficult to calibrate the isotope changes; you may be looking at post-depositional changes rather than the signal itself. Tree rings and ice cores both require particular attention to understanding exactly what you're recording, especially if you are talking about temperature.\n\nMYSAK: For anyone who's interested, I'd like to mention that Brian Luckman at the University of Western Ontario has tree-ring records from the Canadian Rockies for about the last thousand years. He's showing a nice cycle of 150 years or so.\n\nMCGOWAN: Are you comparing tree rings taken from similar altitudes at those different locations? Also, how does the variance of instrumentally measured mountain temperatures compare with that of lowland temperatures?\n\nDIAZ: Most of the data sets are from moderate elevations. As for the high/low elevation temperature variances, the trends are reduced with respect to surface, but they're still comparable.\n\nVariability of African Rainfall on Interannual and Decadal Time Scales\n\nSHARON E. NICHOLSON1\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper examines the rainfall fluctuations that have occurred over the continent of Africa during the past century. Major characteristics include anomaly patterns that are continental in scale, with marked teleconnections between particular sectors of the continent, and quasi-periodic fluctuations with dominant time scales of approximately 2.3, 3.5, and 5 to 6 years. In the Sahelian regions these higher-frequency fluctuations are not apparent; instead, most of the variance is found on time scales of 7 years or longer. Both dry and wet episodes tend to persist for one or two decades at a time; decadal means change by a factor of 2. These characteristics are also apparent in the Sahelian climate record for earlier centuries. Elsewhere on the continent, synchronous changes of rainfall occur, but the \"wet\" or \"dry\" decades are not as uniformly wet or dry as in the Sahel. Examples are the 1950s, in which above-average rainfall prevailed over most of the continent, and the 1980s, during which most of the continent was abnormally dry. It is likely that the factors producing higher-frequency interannual variability differ from those producing the decadal-scale fluctuations. Both sea surface temperature and land-surface feedback have been suggested as causes of the unusual persistence in the Sahel, but the latter cannot explain the change of decadal means.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe continent of Africa is primarily tropical or subtropical, so the climatic changes that have taken place have been manifested principally in the rainfall regime. The rainfall fluctuations that occur are extreme; those in the semi-arid regions are probably unmatched anywhere in their magnitude and spatial extent. In the Sahel, for example, decadal averages change by a factor of 2 or more. Most major periods of anomalous rainfall, either individual years or decadal-scale episodes, affect most of the continent.\n\nThis paper examines the rainfall fluctuations that have occurred during the twentieth century and compares them with historical episodes. The time scales of the fluctuations are summarized, and the decadal-scale fluctuations described in greater detail. The intra-continental teleconnections, and teleconnections to tropical or global rainfall anomalies, are also considered. Finally, a brief review of causal mechanisms is provided.\n\nUndoubtedly, changes in the thermal regime over Africa have occurred, especially along the continent's poleward\n\nextremes and at higher elevations. These are minor compared to rainfall fluctuations; moreover, they have not been systematically studied. Therefore, this paper will be limited to variability of rainfall.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nMost of the description of rainfall variability in this paper derives from previous studies made by the author. Analyses are based on a network (Figure 1) of approximately 1400 stations, the statistics of which are fully described in Nicholson et al. (1988). From these, a spatially averaged data set has been derived, utilizing 90 geographical regions (Figure 1) that are homogeneous with respect to the interannual variability of rainfall.\n\nRegional averages are generally expressed as a standardized annual departure from the long-term mean (i.e., the mean over the entire length of record). In select analyses, the rainfall anomalies are also presented as a percentage departure from the long-term mean. About 75 percent of the station records commence before 1925 and continue to 1984 or later. Hence, the length of record is generally at least 60 years.\n\nRegionally averaged rainfall Rj is calculated as\n\nwhere Rj is the regional rainfall departure in the year j, and Ij is the number of stations available in year j. In the above, xij is a standardized rainfall departure at station i in\n\nyear j. It is calculated as\n\nwhere rij is the annual total at the station in the year j, is the station's long-term annual mean, and si is the variance of annual rainfall at the station.\n\nThese regional means are utilized to examine the temporal and spatial structure of rainfall variability over the continent. They also illustrate the magnitude of decadal anomalies. In some analyses 1°-grid averages are utilized instead of the regional averages.\n\nCONTINENTAL-SCALE PATTERNS OF RAINFALL VARIABILITY\n\nPrevious studies (e.g., Nicholson, 1986) have utilized a map-classification technique of Lund (1963) to describe the preferred spatial configurations of rainfall anomalies over Africa. This technique is based on linear correlation of map patterns. Most of the rainfall variability over the continent is described by the six \"anomaly types\" illustrated in Figure 2. Unlike eigenvector techniques, the patterns produced by the Lund method are not orthogonal; hence, these six anomaly types really describe only four basic configurations of anomalies. These include a tendency for above(or below-) average rainfall over most of the continent (Types 2 and 4) and two patterns (Types 1, 3, 5, and 6) illustrating an opposition between equatorial and subtropical latitudes. Approximately 21 of the 90 years between 1901 and 1990 are represented by a pattern of above-average rainfall in the equatorial regions but below-average rainfall in subtropical latitudes, and 12 by the opposite pattern, which is illustrated by Type 3 in Figure 2. Fourteen of the 70 years are best represented by the Type 2 anomaly pattern, with below-average rainfall throughout most of the continent, and 15 by Type 4, with above-average rainfall in most areas.\n\nThese patterns are introduced here for two reasons. First, as will later be seen, they are typical of decadal-scale rainfall fluctuations over Africa. Second, they demonstrate that much of the rainfall variability over the continent can be described using a small number of regional time series. The representative regions, shown in Figure 3, include five latitudinal zones running from the southern margin of the Sahara to the Guinea Coast of the Atlantic, eastern equatorial Africa, and two sectors of southern Africa loosely termed the northern and southern Kalahari.\n\nDECADAL-SCALE FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFluctuations During Recent Decades\n\nTwo major, decadal-scale rainfall anomalies have affected the African continent within the current century:\n\nrelatively wet conditions in the 1950s and relatively arid conditions in the 1980s. The periods of anomalous conditions have not been precisely 10 years in length, nor have they commenced at the onset of each numeric decade (e.g., 1950 or 1960). Nevertheless, these periods and the transition between them are well illustrated from decadal maps and tabulations (Figure 4 and Table 1).\n\nFluctuations have been particularly large in Sahelian West Africa, where rainfall was about twice as great during the 1950s as during recent years (Table 1). The 1950s (Figure 4a) were also wetter than average over most of the rest of the continent, but abnormally dry in the equatorial regions. The wet episode ended abruptly in the Sahel toward 1960, after which time a change occurred in many other regions.\n\nIn the early 1960s, phenomenally wet years occurred in equatorial regions, especially in eastern Africa, while droughts affected much of southern Africa. As an example, Wajir, in northern Kenya with mean annual rainfall of 285 mm, received 612 mm in November 1961; at many Kenyan stations, rainfall that month was five to ten times the long-term mean. The levels of Lake Victoria and other Rift Valley lakes suddenly rose several meters commencing in 1961, abruptly attaining levels unmatched since the end of the nineteenth century. The 1960s as a whole (Figure 4b) was a period of relatively wet conditions throughout the equatorial latitudes and abnormally dry conditions throughout most of the subtropics of both hemispheres. The dry anomaly was particularly strong in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe early 1970s were a period of drought over much of Africa (Nicholson, 1986), but later in the decade a series of tremendously wet years occurred in southern Africa, so that for the decade as a whole, a strong opposition is apparent between the two hemispheres (Figure 4c). This is not a common configuration of anomalies, and had previously occurred in only a few isolated years. A plausible explanation is presented below.\n\nThe 1980s (Figure 4d), in strong contrast to the 1950s and unlike other decades, was a period of abnormally dry conditions over most of the continent, including most equatorial regions. The decadal anomalies are largest in the Sahel, on the order of + 25 percent in the 1950s and -30 percent in the 1980s (or nearly one standard deviation). In most other areas the departures for the 1950s (Nicholson, 1989) and 1980s (Table 2) are less than 10 percent of the mean.\n\nThe continental scale of these anomalies and the abrupt change around 1971 are evident in Figure 5, which shows the linear correlation of the rainfall anomaly pattern of each year since 1901 with anomaly Type 2 in Figure 2. This anomaly type is one of negative departures throughout the continent. Most years from 1950 to 1970 are negatively correlated with it; correlations for 1950-1957, 1961, and 1962 are significant at the 99 percent level. In contrast, nearly every year since 1970 is positively and, in most cases, significantly correlated with the Type 2 pattern.\n\nTeleconnections and Other Characteristics of Rainfall Variability: Comparison of Modern and Historical Periods\n\nThe previous section identified several characteristics of African rainfall variability on decadal-scales. One is the tendency of anomalous conditions to persist for roughly a decade. Another is the large magnitude of anomalies in the Sahel. A third is the teleconnections within Africa on decadal-scales, as illustrated by the anomaly types of Figure 2 and the decadal patterns for the 1950s and 1980s (Figures\n\nTABLE 2 Mean Annual Rainfall (mm) at Select Sahelian Stations for Two Recent Periods\n\n1950-59\n\n1970-84\n\nBilma\n\n20\n\n9\n\nAtbara\n\n92\n\n54\n\nNouakchott\n\n172\n\n51\n\nKhartoum\n\n178\n\n116\n\nAgadez\n\n210\n\n97\n\nTimbuktu\n\n241\n\n147\n\nNema\n\n381\n\n210\n\nDakar\n\n609\n\n308\n\nBanjul\n\n1409\n\n791\n\n4a and 4d). Overall, the decadal rainfall fluctuations tend to occur quasi-synchronously over the continent. There is a strong tendency for the fluctuations in the subtropical latitudes of both hemispheres to be roughly in phase, as well as a tendency for the fluctuations in the equatorial and subtropical latitudes to be opposed to each other. These same characteristics are evident in the historical past.\n\nFigures 4a and 4d clearly demonstrate that major periods of anomalous rainfall in the Sahel correspond to continental-scale anomalies as well. This is likewise true for historical fluctuations of Sahel rainfall, such as the droughts of the 1820s and 1830s and the 1910s (Figure 6). Both of these periods were times of frequent drought throughout much of the continent. A period of sufficient rainfall from about 1870 to 1895 was part of a continental pattern mirrored by the 1950s pattern (Figure 4a). In the 1950s, lake levels rose dramatically from Chad in the north to Ngami in the south, and the floods of rivers like the Niger and Nile were consistently high. Near Timbuktu, in the Niger Delta where annual rainfall is now 195 mm, wheat production thrived to such an extent that grain was exported to neighboring regions. In the semi-arid regions of North Africa rainfall probably averaged about 25 to 30 percent above the twentieth-century mean during the period 1870-1895 (Nicholson, 1978).\n\nInterestingly, the historical patterns depicted in Figure 6 were constructed prior to the derivation of the rainfall anomaly types in Figure 2; they were based on proxy data and qualitative indicators. While this origin might render the reconstructions questionable, their reliability is supported by the clear correspondence to the major anomaly types apparent in the modern quantitative rainfall record. They also demonstrate other major characteristics of African rainfall variability established with modern records: the decadal-scale persistence of anomalies in the Sahel, and their continental scale.\n\nIn certain cases, global teleconnections to decadal-scale African rainfall fluctuations have also been demonstrated. One example is the change from \"wetter\" to \"drier\" conditions around the turn of the century. This change was seen throughout the tropics, with a major shift occurring around 1895 (see, e.g., Kraus, 1955a,b). The anomalously dry 1830s was also a period of globally anomalous climate, often considered to mark the end of the Little Ice Age. The anomalous conditions of the 1950s are also noted in other tropical and subtropical regions such as Central America, India, and Australia. These decadal teleconnections have not, however, been studied systematically.\n\nFluctuations on Time Scales of Centuries\n\nThe climatic fluctuations that have affected Africa on time scales of centuries are difficult to establish because\n\nthere are few long-term climate data sets or even proxy records from which past climatic conditions can be reconstructed. Two notable exceptions are Lake Chad, the fluctuations of which have been well documented through both historical and geological methodologies (Maley, 1976), and the Nile, for which quasi-continuous written records extend back to the seventh century (Toussoun, 1923; Riehl et al., 1979). However, neither record lends itself to completely unambiguous interpretation.\n\nThe Lake Chad record suggests two long periods of comparatively wet conditions in the West African Sahel, one in the ninth through fourteenth centuries and another from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. The first was synchronous with the Medieval Warm epoch and the second occurred more or less during the Little Ice Age of Europe. The more humid climates in the present-day Sahel, which the Lake Chad record implies, are further supported by numerous historical and geological indicators throughout West Africa. Information for other regions of Africa is more scarce, but the Nile record and those of other East African lakes suggest that the first humid period affected much of eastern equatorial Africa as well. The second appears to have affected that region and much of southern Africa (Nicholson, 1979a, 1981). The decline of the recent wetter conditions took place toward 1800, at a time when the Northern Hemisphere was experiencing the end of the Little Ice Age.\n\nINTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF RAINFALL\n\nBecause of the limited availability of meteorological data for time scales of 10 to 100 years, it may be necessary to evaluate mechanisms of variability on these time scales at least partially through analogy with individual years. For this reason, a description of the interannual variability of African rainfall is relevant here. This section examines the temporal characteristics of rainfall variability in various regions in the domains of both time and frequency. Several of the features exhibited will have to be adequately accounted for by any mechanism that is proposed as explaining variability on 10- to 100-year time scales.\n\nFigures 7 and 8 show the standardized rainfall departure series for select regions of Africa. The most striking feature in any of the series is the extreme persistence of rainfall anomalies in Sahelian West Africa (Figure 7). This persistence was first identified by Bunting et al. (1976), then later by Walker and Rowntree (1977), Nicholson (1979b, 1983), and Lamb (1982). In the Sahel as a whole (a combined series of northern, southern, and central Sahel in Figure 7), regionally averaged rainfall exceeded the long-term mean in every year from 1950 to 1967; it has been below the mean in every year since 1970. Rainfall also tended to be above average throughout most of the period 1927 through 1936 and below average in the 1910s and 1940s. To some\n\ndegree, this persistence is also apparent in the Soudano-Guinean and Guinean regions further south.\n\nSuch long-term persistence is not evident in any of the other regional time series. For example, the longest run of ''dry\" years is 5 years in the northern Kalahari, 6 years in the southern Kalahari, and only 3 years in eastern Africa (Figure 8). The longest run of \"wet\" years is 5 years in all three regions. However, longer periods of predominantly wet or dry years have prevailed. These include, for example, the \"dry\" 1950s in East Africa and the drier periods of 1926 to 1935, the 1960s, and the 1980s in the southern Kalahari.\n\nThe contrast between the Sahelo-Saharan region and elsewhere in Africa is underscored by Figure 9. It shows the results of low-pass filtering the rainfall series for the regions in Figure 1 and isolating the percentages of variance of annual rainfall on time scales longer than 7 years. This variance represents a combination of decadal-scale or longer fluctuations and year-to-year persistence of rainfall anomalies. Low-frequency variance is by far the greatest in the Sahelian regions, accounting for as much as 45 to 60 percent of the variance. Elsewhere it is generally between 20 and 35 percent.\n\nSpectral analysis shows that the dominant time scales of rainfall variability throughout the continent are on the order of 2.2 to 2.4, 3.3 to 3.8, and 5 to 6 years (Rodhe and Virji, 1976; Ogallo, 1979; Nicholson and Entekhabi, 1986). These are not the only periodicities that have been detected, but they are the only ones apparent throughout large expanses of the continent and the only ones corresponding to time scales of distinct causal mechanisms such as SST fluctuations or ENSO. The works of Tyson (e.g., 1980), Fleer (1981), and others provide more detail on select regions.\n\nThe occurrence of these quasi-periodicities in the regions depicted in Figure 1 were evaluated by Nicholson and Entekhabi (1986). The results are shown in Figure 10. The 5- to 6-year time scale is dominant in equatorial regions; the 3.5-year time scale is dominant in much of southern Africa and in parts of equatorial Africa; the 2.3-year time scale is dominant in the eastern half of equatorial and south-\n\nern Africa. Interestingly, these relatively high-frequency fluctuations (Figure 10) are nearly absent throughout the Sahelo-Saharan region of West Africa, where the spectra are dominated by low-frequency fluctuations (Figure 9). Relatively low-frequency fluctuations have been noted also in parts of South Africa (Tyson, 1980), with time scales of 18 to 22 years being common.\n\nAn examination of wet and dry years throughout the continent (e.g., Nicholson et al., 1988) shows other characteristics of interannual variability that must be explained. One is that in many regions interannual variability is associated not with a change in the intensity of the rainy season but by a change in the length of the season or by anomalous rainfall in comparatively dry months. This can be demonstrated for East Africa as well. Throughout most of the region, the main rainy season is April to May, but interannual variability is best correlated with anomalies of the \"short rains\" of October-November (Figures 11 and 12). The importance of transition-season fluctuations also helps to explain the rainfall's continental-scale coherence over regions (such as the African Northern and Southern Hemispheres) where the rainy seasons are six months out of phase.\n\nRainfall in East Africa illustrates another interesting characteristic: The factors that produce the climatological-mean\n\npatterns are not necessarily those that explain interannual variability. Within this region, mean annual rainfall and its seasonality are highly heterogeneous (Figure 13), being associated with several features of the general atmospheric circulation as well as with regional-scale orographic and lacustrine effects. Nevertheless, the patterns of interannual variability are markedly similar throughout the region (Figure 14), so that there is a remarkable resemblance between the time series for the region as a whole, and for those four climatologically homogeneous subregions. The first eigenvector of annual rainfall shows loadings of the same sign throughout the region; the pattern explains 36 percent of the variability of annual rainfall and 52 percent of the variability during the \"short rains\" (Nyenzi, 1988).\n\nIn summary, there are several notable characteristics of rainfall variability that must be explained by mechanisms for producing this variability. These include, first of all, the continental-scale coherence and the seemingly contradictory contrast between the dominant low-frequency fluctuations in Sahelo-Saharan regions and the high-frequency fluctuations elsewhere, in regions that show strong teleconnections to the Sahel on time scales of 1, 10, and 100 years. The characteristic time scales of 2.3, 3.5, and 5 to 6 years must likewise be explained, as must be the seasonality of the changes and the coherent patterns of interannual variability in climatically heterogeneous regions.\n\nMECHANISMS OF RAINFALL VARIABILITY\n\nMost studies of African rainfall have focused on interannual variability. Numerous authors have demonstrated relationships between SSTs and rainfall in various parts of Africa (e.g., Lamb, 1978; Lough, 1986; Semazzi et al., 1988; Wolter, 1989; Folland et al., 1991; Nicholson and Entekhabi, 1987). For parts of eastern and southern Africa linkages to ENSO have also been clearly established (by, e.g., Farmer, 1988; Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Ogallo, 1987; Harrison, 1983; Lindesay et al., 1986; Nicholson and Entekhabi, 1986, 1987). For Sahel rainfall, a number of other factors, such as changes in the upper-level winds and in the Hadley and Walker circulations, have also been implicated (Kanamitsu and Krishnamurti, 1978; Newell and Kidson, 1984).\n\nVery little attention has been paid to the causes of the lower-frequency variability. The exception is the work by Folland and collaborators (e.g., Folland et al., 1991), which is limited to the Sahel. Virtually no studies have been carried out on the causes of the continental rainfall fluctuations on decadal time scales.\n\nRowell et al. (1992, 1995) suggest that the twentieth-century trends in Sahel rainfall can be attributed to interhemispheric differences in sea surface temperature. The interhemispheric contrast increased in mid-century and decreased sharply as the droughts began in the 1970s and 1980s. This mechanism does not, however, account for the extreme persistence of anomalies in the Sahel, or their lack of persistence in regions such as southern Africa, which otherwise appear to have teleconnections to the Sahel in individual years and on decadal-scales.\n\nLand-Surface Feedback in the Sahel\n\nAs an example of how this might work, consider a year during which anomalous large-scale circulation triggers drought in the Sahel and in other African regions showing strong teleconnections to the Sahel. When the large-scale forcing returns to normal, so do rainfall conditions in most areas. However, in the Sahel the drought conditions might be reinforced by local, land-surface feedback. In that case they will persist until a year in which a large-scale circula-\n\nand late rainy-season months. High-frequency forcing is also stronger in June-July than in August-September. This observation is relevant because one hypothesized factor in the feedback, the African Easterly Jet (see below), is operative mainly in the latter period.\n\nThe potential feedback mechanisms involve the effect of such factors as soil moisture and dust generation on surface fluxes and atmospheric heating. The dynamic link to the Sahel could be the mid-level African Easterly Jet. The African Easterly Jet is a consequence of the meridional temperature gradient in the region, which in turn is produced by the strong thermal contrast between the dry Sahel-Saharan region and the forests and Atlantic Ocean to the south. It is analogous to the mid-latitude westerly jet stream, in that it provides the instability and energy for the development and maintenance of rain-bearing systems in the Sahel. It has a maximum around 650 or 700 mb, a level where the temperature structure is strongly affected by surface-generated dust. The intensity of the dust, in turn, is highly inversely correlated with rainfall in the Sahel.\n\nThe contrast in surface fluxes between wet and dry years (Lare and Nicholson, 1993) is sufficiently large to produce the observed changes of jet intensity between wet and dry years (Newell and Kidson, 1984). These in turn are sufficiently large to influence the jet's dynamics, and are thus capable of altering such variables as the number, size, and intensity of disturbances in the region.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nNumerous studies have firmly established that:\n\ndecadal-scale rainfall fluctuations have been quite marked in Sahelian Africa;\n\nthese fluctuations tend to have a continental spatial scale (although less extreme and persistent than in the Sahel) with distinct teleconnection patterns;\n\nthe characteristics of modern decadal anomalies are also apparent in earlier centuries; and\n\nthe 1950s and, to a lesser extent, 1960s were continentally \"wet,\" while the 1980s and, to a lesser extent, 1970s have been continentally \"dry.\"\n\nAmong the major areas in which research is needed are the causes of the decadal-scale fluctuations of African rainfall, particularly the continentally coherent patterns; the role land-surface feedback may play in the decadal-scale anomalies in the Sahel; and the teleconnections between African rainfall anomalies on the decadal-scale and global climate anomalies.\n\nOur understanding of decadal-scale fluctuations could be greatly enhanced by comparative analysis of the 1950s and more recent decades. Unfortunately, many of the necessary data are routinely available only for about the last 20 years. However, a great many data, especially upper-air data, do exist for the 1950s and 1960s, but in obscure archives where they are not readily available. Effort should be devoted to creating usable data sets for earlier periods, especially the 1950s.\n\nOur knowledge of African climate fluctuations on the scale of centuries is considerably more vague. In order to establish these regional fluctuations' causal mechanisms and their relationships to global climate fluctuations, they must be more precisely delineated in time and space. This will require the preparation of better proxy data sets. Few attempts have been made to use, for example, tree-ring or varve chronologies. Also, the innovative paleoclimatic techniques that have been developed recently might be appropriate here as well. Creation of these proxy data sets for Africa should be a high priority.\n\nanswers to these questions. We will attempt to address them by interpreting past observational data and the results of controlled sensitivity experiments made with general-circulation models (GCMs).\n\nONSET OF THE SAHEL DROUGHT\n\nFigure 1 shows the 10-year running-mean seasonal rainfall anomalies over Sahel, India, and China. The Chinese rainfall data are available for only a 30-year period (19511980); therefore, the Indian and the Sahel rainfall data have also been shown for that period.\n\nWe interpret these data to suggest that the occurrence of above-normal rainfall during the decade of the 1950s and the early 1960s, and below-normal rainfall during the late 1960s and the 1970s, is a feature common to the vast areas of African-Asian monsoon, not one confined to the Sahel region. We do not know why rainfall over such a large geographic region, covering two continents, was above normal during the 1950s. We also do not know why the transition from above-normal to below-normal rainfall that\n\ntook place during the late 1960s occurred over the entire African-Asian monsoon region. However, on the basis of comprehensive GCM sensitivity studies (Folland et al., 1986; Rowell et al., 1992; Xue and Shukla, 1993), it is now generally accepted that the rainfall anomalies, especially over the Sahel, are consistent with, and can be simulated using, the global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during these periods.\n\nOn the basis of the GCM sensitivity experiments andobservations shown in Figure 1, we conjecture that the onset of the Sahel's rainfall deficit in the late 1960s, along with the above-normal rainfall in the 1950s, should be explained as a regional manifestation of the planetary-scale variability of the global coupled ocean-land-atmosphere climate system. Considering the large spatial and temporal extent of these rainfall anomalies, we cannot conceive of any possible mechanism by which local human-induced changes could initiate such major droughts over two continents. We therefore reject the notion, often mentioned in popular literature, that the Sahel drought was initiated by human activities.\n\nWe believe that the pertinent question about the Sahel drought is not what initiated the drought (we conjecture it was natural variability) but why the drought has persisted for 25 years.\n\nPERSISTENCE OF THE SAHEL DROUGHT\n\nWe further propose that strong interaction between atmospheric and land-surface processes is one of the primary causes of the drought's persistence: A reduction in rainfall (due to natural variability of the climate system) would change the land surface characteristics (increase in albedo and decrease in vegetation), which in turn would cause further reduction in rainfall. The basic mechanisms of atmosphere-land coupling have the potential to perpetuate an initial drought (or an initial excessive-rainfall) regime until they are reversed by an opposite forcing, which could be produced by natural variability.\n\nThe extent to which changes in the land-surface properties can influence the local climate depends on the spatial scale of the changes in the land-surface characteristics and the geographic location of the region. We submit that the Sahel region is particularly sensitive to atmosphere-land coupling processes. The Sahel region is geographically unique in that it is adjacent to the largest desert on the earth's surface, and it represents the largest contiguous land surface without extensive mountain terrains. The absence of large-scale topographic forcing in the region is perhaps one of the main reasons for the lack of zonal asymmetry in the rainfall pattern there. As Charney (1975) pointed out in his seminal paper on the dynamics of Sahel drought, climate in the subtropical margins of the deserts is particularly vulnerable to changes in the land-surface properties.\n\nDuring the past 20 years there have been a large number of GCM sensitivity studies (Mintz, 1984; Dirmeyer and Shukla, 1993) that show that increases in albedo and decreases in vegetation cover and soil moisture tend to further reduce rainfall over the Sahel. We do not know of any GCM sensitivity study challenging this basic result. We present here the results of a recent GCM sensitivity study (Xue and Shukla, 1993 and an unpublished manuscript) in which the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions (COLA) model was integrated with two sets of land-surface conditions over the region south of the Sahara desert. In one set of integrations, referred to as the \"desertification\" experiment, it was assumed that the area approximately between 10° and 20°N and 15° and 40°E was covered by shrubs above bare soil. In the other set of integrations, referred to as the \"reforestation\" experiment, the area approximately between 15° and 40°E was covered by broadleaf trees above ground cover. The first set of surface conditions (desertification) was considered to represent the exaggerated state of current conditions. The second set of surface conditions (reforestation) represented a hypothetical situation in which vegetation was maintained in the margins of the Sahara Desert. It was an exaggeration of the conditions during the 1950s, when rainfall over the Sahel was above normal, and the latitude of the 200 mm isoline of seasonal rainfall in the western Sahel was at about 18°N. The model was integrated with identical global SST patterns for each change in the land-surface conditions.\n\nFigure 2a shows the difference between the observed rainfall averaged for 1950 plus 1958 and 1983 plus 1984. Figure 2b shows the difference between the desertification and reforestation experiments for seasonal mean rainfall. The similarity between Figures 2a and 2b is remarkable. Both show negative rainfall departures between 10° and 20°N and a positive rainfall departure to the south of the negative departures. The dipole nature of both the observed and the model rainfall anomalies suggests a southward displacement of the mean rainfall pattern.\n\nSince the only changes in these integrations were those in land-surface conditions, it is reasonable to conjecture that if the natural variability of the global climate system were to produce an initial drought, the strong atmosphere-land interaction over the Sahel region could contribute toward the persistence of that drought.\n\nWe further propose that since natural changes in the Sahel rainfall have led to large-scale changes in human activities in the region, it is quite likely that the degradation of the land surface was exacerbated by human activities (overgrazing, deforestation, soil desiccation, etc.), thereby producing further reduction in the Sahel rainfall. The exacerbating effects of human activities could have been especially large during the past 30 years because the population density has been much higher than at the beginning of the century.\n\nThe various conjectures put forward in this paper so far have been synthesized in a schematic diagram shown in Figure 3. It is seen that the atmosphere-land interaction has a positive feedback mechanism, so that initial drought caused by the natural variability of the climate system is perpetuated by increases in albedo and decreases in vegetation, soil moisture, and surface roughness. In addition, the human-induced effects also produce an increase in albedo and a decrease in vegetation, soil moisture, and surface roughness. Thus, both the planetary-scale effects and the human-induced effects are mutually reinforcing the dry conditions, which has led to an unprecedentedly long and severe drought over the Sahel.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nIf we accept the premise presented in the beginning of this paper, that the Sahel drought was initiated by natural\n\nvariability of the global climate system, it is reasonable to assume that at some unpredictable future time the natural variability (global SST patterns, for example) is likely to produce excessive rainfall over the Sahel and thus reverse the current drought. However, it is unclear whether the changes in the land-surface characteristics can also be reversed. Therefore, even if the global circulation shifts in such a way as to be favorable for reversing the current drought, the global natural changes will have to be stronger than before, and more favorable, to overcome the opposing effects of local atmosphere-land interactions. In fact, it is entirely possible that the Sahel drought will continue indefinitely, because the natural variability effects may never be large enough to counteract the persistent effects of the local land-surface changes.\n\nIn a hypothetical GCM sensitivity experiment, Xue and Shukla (unpublished manuscript) have shown that rainfall over the Sahel can be increased by replacing the broadleaf shrubs over ground cover and the shrubs over bare soil by broadleaf trees over ground cover over a large region that includes the Sahel. This suggests that although human effects were not responsible for the initiation of the Sahel drought, a suitable combination of large-scale natural variability and human intervention might contribute toward reversing the current drought. Modification of surface albedo, evapotranspiration, or surface roughness would all be of assistance, though of course it would be extremely difficult to sustain vegetation on a scale sufficiently large to halt the spread of the desert.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDESER: Do you think local forcing applies to the string of wet years in the 1950s and 1960s too?\n\nNICHOLSON: Absolutely. What I feel is the critical factor involved in the forcing is the fluxes to the atmosphere, including dust. The land surface forcing should be reversible, or symmetric, for the wet and dry periods.\n\nRIND: How successful have people been in quantifying the albedo change between the wet and dry periods, as far as the land surface is concerned?\n\nNICHOLSON: One study made 10 or 15 years ago took the available satellite data and reconstructed the albedo over about 8 years. The small changes found were not consistent with rainfall fluctuations, and I think basically showed that albedo is not one of the major forcing factors. More recently, Vivian Gornitz searched historical archives for material on land-surface changes, and constructed a beautiful map of West Africa showing changes due to human activities. Again, in terms of absolute values of albedo, it's a very small change, and sometimes in the wrong direction for the Charney mechanism. So I think that not albedo but something coupled to soil moisture, vegetation, and dust will be the major factor.\n\nDIAZ: To what degree do you think that time differences in the frequency of the westward-propagating tropical disturbances affect the variability you're seeing?\n\nNICHOLSON: I think they're key to understanding the region. This may be the one place on the globe where the land-surface forcing per se has a major impact on the overall large-scale dynamics. The jet stream at the mid-levels here, which is critical in disturbance development, is due to nothing other than the temperature gradient across the land surface down to the ocean.\n\nSome of the models done years ago, during the GATE days, showed that if you change the relationship between baroclinic and barotropic instability you can change the characteristics of the disturbances. The difference between the wet 1950s and the dry 1970s can be explained by one or two disturbances a month that produce, say, 150 mm of precipitation a day, where the dry periods have nothing over 50. I think the large-scale circulation is clearly coupled to the land surface there. Incidentally, the dust in that region is right at the level of the African easterly jet, about 650700 mb, which is another reason I think it is so important.\n\nCANE: I can see that the land-surface processes can affect what's happening, but I'd like to hear what you see as the feedback\n\nmechanism for very-long-period changes. How would you cycle in and out, and what would the trigger be?\n\nNICHOLSON: Well, if you assume some large-scale trigger in the general atmospheric circulation, maybe a major change in SST, you could get a continental-scale pattern like the wet 1950s all over Africa. But in other areas the rainfall goes back to normal, whereas in the Sahel the anomalies persist for 10 or even 20 years. There has to be some other smaller-scale forcing that reinforces the existing conditions until it's overridden by some larger trigger in the atmosphere-ocean circulation.\n\nCOLE: Ropelewski and Halpert's analysis of global rainfall suggests that the ENSO teleconnection with African rainfall is strongest in the east.
