        "text": "Are you ready to plan your holiday but are wondering when is the best time to visit Switzerland? We think any time is a good time to visit Switzerland, but this guide will dive deep into the factors to consider so you can choose the month that is best for you!\n\nRead on for the pros and cons to visiting Switzerland in the different seasons. We’ll tell you what you can – and can’t – experience during those months, so you can make an informed decision on the best time to travel to Switzerland – for you.\n\n[This post may contain compensated links. Please see my disclosure policy for more information.]\n\nHow to Determine the Best Time of Year to Visit Switzerland\n\nOf course there is no actual “best time” to go to Switzerland – what’s best for one person may not work for the another. Here are some questions to ask yourself when planning your Switzerland vacation:\n\nDo you need the cheapest flights?\n\nWhen can you get time off work?\n\nIs there a particular event you want to participate in?\n\nDo you want to hike? Ski?\n\nAre certain attractions important to you that may be closed?\n\nA couple of the Swiss panoramic trains (Glacier Express and Gotthard Panorama Express, for example) and some of the mountain cableways and funiculars cease running for certain periods so if you’re desperate to enjoy one of these rides, this should be a consideration.\n\nCheck Switzerland’s cable car and funicular closure dates for the upcoming winter. You can check the operating dates of the panoramic trains we mentioned in our guide to the Glacier Express and our article about the Gotthard Panorama Express.\n\nBefore we dive in and discuss the different times of year to visit Switzerland, let me clarify that the seasons in Switzerland – as in the rest of Europe – are determined by the Summer and Winter Solstices.\n\nTherefore, Summer starts on 21 June, the Summer Solstice – or longest day of the year – and finishes on 20 September.\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, I’ve used full months to discuss the pros and cons of visiting in each season, rather than the specific dates of each season.\n\nSpring in Switzerland\n\nOfficial dates: 21 March to 20 June\n\nMonths: March, April, May\n\nSpring is an exciting time to visit Switzerland.\n\nBecause it’s the country’s true off-season, you can likely score good deals on flights and accommodation (which, considering the price of everything in Switzerland, could make or break your trip).\n\nYou also won’t end up fighting the crowds, which introverts might find particularly refreshing.\n\nThat said, Switzerland weather in March can still feel quite wintery, with highs around 6 degrees Celsius and lots of rainfall. It could easily dip into freezing territory at night.\n\nBecause of the cooler temperatures, but longer daylight hours (daylight savings starts on the last Sunday in March), this is actually a great month to get your skiing in.\n\nThe Alps are still snow-covered but there are fewer tourists.\n\nStill, if you visit right after Easter (which can fall at the end of March some years), you’ll find many cable cars are shut down until hiking season begins at the end of May.\n\nSo if you have your heart set on the trails or scenic mountain top views, keep that in mind.\n\nSwitzerland in April, on the other hand, starts to warm up. It’s too warm to ski in most of the country, but like I mentioned above, some of the summer tourist attractions and hiking trails will be closed for another month.\n\nFlower lovers are in for a real treat in April as the Morges Tulip Festival takes place on Lake Geneva throughout the month.\n\nWhat is the cheapest month to visit Switzerland? If you’re travelling on a budget you will find the best deals during April.\n\nJust be sure to check attraction websites carefully and see what’s open when you’ll be there. And dress in layers!\n\nFor slightly warmer and more predictable weather, the average Switzerland temperature in May hovers between 15 and 19 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe temperature is warm enough to melt the snow and for you to get a glimpse of the under-appreciated narcissus blooms.\n\nAnd if you love cheese as much as I do, you can visit Gruyeres on the first Sunday of May for their annual Cheese Festival.\n\nSummer in Switzerland\n\nOfficial dates: 21 June to 20 September\n\nMonths: June, July, August\n\nThe months of June through August are one of the two peak seasons in Switzerland. The weather is balmy, the hiking trails are open, and the lakes are ready for boaters and swimmers.\n\nAs such, the prices for accommodation are high and all the popular locations will be packed with fellow tourists.\n\nSummer is high season for coach tours as well as independent travelers, so attractions like Jungfraujoch and Mt. Titlis will be heaving with visitors.\n\nIf you’d like to travel during the Swiss summer but would prefer to avoid huge crowds at the major sites, you’d be wise to visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon.\n\nAnother option is to choose sites and attractions that are a bit more under the radar – think Mt. Niesen or Mt. Stockhorn, for example.\n\nWeekends also tend to be particularly busy during summer as the Swiss head to the mountains to go hiking. June is when the peak hiking season begins, and all those cable cars that shut down after Easter are re-opened.\n\nThe trails shouldn’t be too muddy, and since the Switzerland temperature in June is generally warm, it should be a pleasant time to get views of the valleys.\n\nOne of the major events that takes place in Switzerland during summer is the Montreux Jazz Festival which runs from late June to mid-July.\n\nSwitzerland weather in July on average gets up to 24 or 25 degrees during the daytime, making it perfect for swimming.\n\nThere are plenty of places to take a dip, but try Lake Sils or the Aare River if you need a recommendation.\n\nWhat is the warmest month in Switzerland? July and August will have the warmest weather. It’s not uncommon for temperatures in the lower lying areas to reach 30 degrees or more.\n\nIt’s definitely worth booking a hotel or apartment with air-conditioning if you are visiting Switzerland in summer. Even a day or two with temperatures above 30 degrees can make things very uncomfortable.\n\nYou can still enjoy a dip in Lake Lucerne, but one of the best reasons to visit Switzerland in August is Swiss National Day on 1 August, where you’ll find festivities all over the country complete with bonfires and fireworks.\n\nOther fun summer activities include biking around Lake Lucerne or going down the snow-less bobsled near Basel called SolarBob.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, you can’t go wrong visiting Switzerland in the summer, although you should be prepared to share your journey with thousands of other eager tourists.\n\nAutumn / Fall in Switzerland\n\nOfficial dates: 21 September to 20 December\n\nMonths: September, October, November\n\nAnother excellent month to visit Switzerland to get the best deals, fewer fellow tourists, and most comfortable weather is September.\n\nIt’s the start of the shoulder season meaning prices get more reasonable and you won’t have to share attractions with as many people.\n\nThe weather is still reasonably warm, so you can still enjoy most summer activities (except swimming, perhaps).\n\nAnd while the days are getting shorter, they’re still long enough to feel like you can make the most of the precious time you get to spend in Switzerland!\n\nDuring September, the Alpine villages across Switzerland welcome the cows home as they descend from the mountains back to the valleys in what is known as Almabfahrt or Almabtrieb.\n\nVillagers celebrate as the cows, wearing flower crowns, are welcomed home with fanfare and yodelling. This is one festival everyone should experience once in their lifetime.\n\nIn October you’ll get the benefit of seeing the leaves begin to change. While higher trails may get snow-covered (and you get fewer daylight hours), you’ll enjoy colourful fall foliage views which are hard to beat.\n\nJust keep in mind that cable cars and funiculars may begin to shut down in the later part of the month due to snow or for their annual maintenance (check closure dates here).\n\nWeather in Switzerland in October becomes chilly, but not overly wet. You’ll need a jacket and won’t want to take a swim, but it’s not time to pull out the waterproof gear just yet.\n\nFor those who enjoy wine, October is the best time of year to go to Switzerland. The Basel Wine Fair falls at the end of the month each year, but the whole month is grape-harvesting season.\n\nDaylight saving in Switzerland ends on the last Sunday in October.\n\nSwitzerland in November should probably be your last choice. Unfortunately, this is not a great month in Switzerland weather- and activity-wise.\n\nThe weather in Switzerland in November gets chilly and wet. This makes the summer activities unpleasant, but there’s not much skiing to do yet and it doesn’t quite feel like winter.\n\nThat said, if you’re someone who travels for museums or other indoor historical sites, November might be the cheapest time to fly to Switzerland, and you will get great deals on accommodation.\n\nAnd with entry to more than 500 museums included in the Swiss Travel Pass, you will definitely get great value if you’re using the pass to travel around.\n\n🇨🇭 Read: Essential Information for Planning Your Trip to Switzerland in the Fall\n\nWinter in Switzerland\n\nOfficial dates: 21 December to 20 March\n\nMonths: December, January, February\n\nDecember through February are the official winter months in Switzerland when the snow starts falling and it’s prime time for skiing.\n\nPrices in the mountains begin to skyrocket, and the lodges fill up fast, but if you want to visit Switzerland for winter sports, there’s no other time to go.\n\nPersonally, I think the best place to spend a winter holiday in Switzerland is the Jungfrau Region.\n\nSwitzerland weather in December is officially cold, cloudy and wet, so plan to spend your time either on the slopes or indoors by a fire enjoying hearty food and warm drinks.\n\nBelieve it or not, you can’t expect a white Christmas all over Switzerland. If you really want snow, make sure you’re high up in the Alps when booking your accommodation – and book well ahead.\n\nThe best time to visit Switzerland for snow is January or February.\n\nThat said, the Christmas markets in Switzerland are amazing and well worth a December visit, snow or not.\n\nSee this year’s Switzerland Christmas market dates!\n\nWhy not ring in the New Year in Switzerland? Like anywhere, there are loads of celebrations to enjoy with the added benefit of going skiing.\n\nBut the cool thing about Switzerland is they don’t just celebrate the new year once – on 13 January the Swiss bring out the party once again and celebrate the beginning of the year according to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nChristmas markets aren’t the only events taking place in Switzerland during the winter months.\n\nThere are numerous major events held around the country including the Snow Polo World Cup at St. Moritz, the Lauberhorn Ski World Cup in Wengen and the International Hot Air Balloon Festival in Château-d’Oex.\n\nDoes it snow in Switzerland? Yes! The Switzerland snow season formally begins in January, where the weather hovers around 0 all month, rarely getting above 2 degrees.\n\nThat lasts through February, where it may get up to 2 degrees during the day, and you’ll get a little more sunshine, but still reliable skiing weather.\n\nIf you’re not fussed about skiing and would like to enjoy warmer temperatures consider visiting the canton of Ticino or the Swiss Riviera (alongside Lake Geneva) as both enjoy milder climates than other parts of the country during winter.\n\nAnother thing to consider before you decide to travel to Switzerland in winter is how you will get around.\n\nIf you are planning on joining an organised coach tour, there are less itineraries and departure dates to choose from during the winter months.\n\nRail services continue to operate as normal, though, and for those who prefer to drive, roads are regularly cleared of snow.\n\nVisiting during Switzerland’s winter months also means less daylight hours to see the sights as well as the necessity of bringing sufficient warm and waterproof clothing which can be bulky, so keep these things in mind, too.\n\n🇨🇭 Read more: Essential Information for Visiting Switzerland in Winter\n\nAverage Temperatures in Switzerland\n\nFinal Thoughts about the Best Time to Visit Switzerland\n\nRegardless of the season you plan to visit Switzerland, you will find plenty of things to see and do.\n\nFor longer daylight hours and warmer temperatures, summer is a great time to visit. Just be aware that you won’t be alone – this is the busiest tourist season in Switzerland.\n\nIf you’d like to enjoy harvest and Alpine festivals and more moderate weather, it’s best to visit Switzerland in autumn, but for snow enthusiasts and those who’d like to experience a Swiss Christmas market, winter is the perfect time for your Swiss vacation.\n\nTravelling in spring (particularly late spring) sees temperatures rising again and flowers blooming as the snow melts. This is a good time to visit if you want to avoid the summer crowds but do keep in mind that some mountain railways may not open until mid to late May.\n\nArmed with all this information, I hope you’ve determined the best time to visit Switzerland for you.\n\nPIN FOR LATER\n\nSWITZERLAND TRAVEL ESSENTIALS"
