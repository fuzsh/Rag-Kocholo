        "text": "Definitive May balance sheet\n\nCompared to the provisional monthly balance of May 28 (see below), the precipitation surplus has increased significantly from around 25% to 44% due to the heavy precipitation in some areas over the last few days. Only a few regions still have a slight precipitation deficit, in particular the Surselva and parts of the canton of Fribourg (see Fig. 1). The tide has turned in terms of temperatures, with May ending with a deficit of 0.1 degrees after the rather cool last few days (see Fig. 2). This made May 2024 the first month after April 2023 with a temperature deficit. While it was slightly too mild in the east, temperatures were slightly below average in Ticino, southern Grisons and Valais in particular. In terms of sunshine duration, the deficit increased from around 25% to 28% in the last few days with the often cloudy weather (see Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 1: Precipitation deviation in May 2024 compared to the norm (1991-2020); Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFig. 2: Temperature deviation in May 2024 compared to the norm (1991-2020); Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFig. 3: Sunshine duration in May 2024 compared with the norm (1991-2020); Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFinally, an overview of the deviations in temperature, precipitation and sun shine duration for some stations last May compared to the long-term average from 1991 to 2020.\n\nThe weather in May 2024\n\nplace Temperaturabweichung Niederschlagsabweichung Abweichung der Sonnenscheindauer °C % % Buchs-Aarau 0.0 83.0 -23.0 Bern 0.2 5.0 -23.0 Basel-Binningen 0.3 40.0 -18.0 Chur 0.5 42.0 -24.0 Geneva -0.3 40.0 -26.0 La Chaux-de-Fonds -0.1 46.0 -29.0 Lugano -0.8 78.0 -33.0 Lucerne 0.0 48.0 -27.0 Säntis 0.0 26.0 -22.0 Sion -0.5 44.0 -24.0 Sankt Gallen 0.4 74.0 -14.0 Samedan 0.2 58.0 -35.0 Vaduz 0.3 65.0 -21.0 Zurich Airport 0.4 57.0 -27.0\n\nClimatic mean from 1991 to 2020, source: MeteoSwiss Temperature precipitation sunshine duration May 2024 Mittel Abweichung May 2024 Mittel Abweichung May 2024 Mittel Abweichung [°C] [°C] [°C] [mm] [mm] [%] [h] [h] [%] Buchs-Aarau 14.0 14.0 0.0 179.9 98.5 83.0 138.2 180.6 -23.0 Bern 13.4 13.2 0.2 117.6 112.4 5.0 151.0 197.1 -23.0 Basel-Binningen 14.9 14.6 0.3 136.6 97.6 40.0 153.1 185.6 -18.0 Chur 14.9 14.4 0.5 99.9 70.2 42.0 132.1 174.1 -24.0 Geneva 14.2 14.5 -0.3 109.9 78.5 40.0 156.4 212.0 -26.0 La Chaux-de-Fonds 10.1 10.2 -0.1 191.7 130.9 46.0 121.5 170.6 -29.0 Lugano 15.5 16.3 -0.8 316.6 177.6 78.0 134.8 199.9 -33.0 Lucerne 14.1 14.1 0.0 220.7 148.7 48.0 126.1 172.7 -27.0 Säntis 1.0 1.0 0.0 282.7 224.0 26.0 127.7 162.7 -22.0 Sion 14.8 15.3 -0.5 74.8 52.0 44.0 175.2 229.2 -24.0 Sankt Gallen 12.6 12.2 0.4 271.9 156.5 74.0 159.2 185.5 -14.0 Samedan 6.9 6.7 0.2 105.9 67.0 58.0 107.2 164.4 -35.0 Vaduz 15.0 14.7 0.3 148.5 90.2 65.0 132.5 168.2 -21.0 Zurich Airport 14.2 13.8 0.4 172.1 109.9 57.0 142.8 195.2 -27.0\n\nProvisional weather balance for May\n\nMay has rarely been a merry month this year, with significantly more rain than usual, especially in the south. In addition, the temperature in May has been average across the whole of Switzerland, although there have been major regional differences. It has also been far too cloudy. More details on the individual parameters below.\n\nSpot on with the temperatures\n\nAfter a temperature surplus of just under 1 degree across Switzerland up to the middle of the month (see below), the temperature surplus has fallen to 0.2 degrees today (see Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1: Previous temperature deviation in May compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nHowever, there are major regional differences: While it was around 0.5 to 1 degree too warm in the east, temperatures in the south are around 0.5 to 1 degree below the norm. In the west, the balance is more or less even. The maximum temperatures have so far been 0.7 degrees higher than the long-term average, while the minimum temperatures have been just 0.1 degrees above average.\n\nBy the end of the month, the temperature deviation will continue to decrease with the mostly slightly below-average weather, and there may even be a very slight deficit by the end of the month. This would then be the first below-average month compared to the 1991-2020 norm since April 2023.\n\nMuch too wet in the south and far west\n\nIn terms of precipitation, there has so far been a surplus of around 25% across Switzerland as a whole (see Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2: Previous precipitation deviation in May compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nHowever, there are also major regional differences in precipitation. It was clearly too wet in the south, in southern Valais and in the far west. In contrast, too little precipitation has so far fallen in the central and eastern foothills of the Alps and in northern and central Grisons. This reflects the recurring southerly conditions associated with the high lows to the west of Switzerland with accumulated precipitation south of the Alps, which also brought heavier rain in the western Lake Geneva region. The eastern Alps in particular were somewhat protected from the humid air masses flowing from the south, meaning that precipitation totals here have been below average so far. However, this will change by the end of the month, when there will be higher precipitation totals, especially in the east and along the Alps, resulting in a precipitation surplus everywhere.\n\nExceptionally many days with precipitation\n\nMay was also characterized by an exceptionally high number of days with precipitation, with only relatively few dry days. Around 20 days of precipitation have been recorded in Ticino so far, compared to between 13 and 19 days in the north. No wonder the farmers had trouble finding a window of opportunity to make hay... Precipitation is now expected every day until the end of the month, which means that the number of days with precipitation will continue to increase.\n\nFig. 3: Number of days with precipitation in May to date; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFar too little sun\n\nMay so far has not only been too wet, but also clearly too cloudy. The sunshine deficit across the whole of Switzerland is currently around 25%. The deviation is greatest in the south, where it is up to over 50% in some places, but lowest in the far east at around 10%. This means that so far in May, Ticino cannot exactly be described as the sunshine capital of Switzerland...\n\nFig. 4: Deviation in sunshine duration in May so far compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nSlight excess temperature\n\nAfter the first half of May, it is slightly too mild across the whole of Switzerland compared to the long-term average, with a nationwide temperature surplus of 0.9 degrees. However, there is a clear contrast between the east and the west and south! In the east, temperatures are between 1.3 and 1.7 degrees above the norm, with the occasional foehn wind in the Alps playing its part. Between Seeland, Lake Geneva and Valais, on the other hand, temperatures have so far been within the normal range, and in some cases slightly below. This picture can also be seen in Ticino, where most stations are a little too cool so far. The biggest negative deviation is at the Locarno-Monti station with -0.9 degrees.\n\nFig. 1: Previous temperature deviation in May 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nToo wet in the west and south\n\nThe picture of the temperature distribution is also reflected in the precipitation. In Ticino and Valais, May has been far too wet so far, with Stabio and Zermatt already receiving more than twice the usual amount for May. A large part of this came together here in the last two days(May 15 and 16). It is also too wet in the west. In contrast, it has been too dry in central Switzerland and parts of north-eastern Switzerland as well as in northern and central Grisons.\n\nFig. 2: Previous deviation of precipitation amounts in May 2024 compared to the long-term average; source: MeteoNews, Ubimet; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nToo little sun\n\nIn most parts of the country, the amount of sunshine has so far been below average, with around 1/4 of the sunshine hours missing across the whole of Switzerland. Only in the east and north-east are we within the norm in this respect so far.\n\nFig. 3: Previous deviation of sunshine duration in May 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet"
