        "text": "Switzerland has two distinct high seasons for tourism. There is winter (December-February) and summer (June-September). They are separated by shoulder seasons where the weather is changing often and many alpine destinations use this downtime for maintenance or a break, so the offering for activities and sights may be limited.\n\nSwitzerland has a moderate climate and is not enormously hot, cold, humid or dry. During the summer holiday months temperature are somewhere around 20-30°C (daytime), in the deep winter in January and February temperatures range from 0-10°C, sometimes even below zero. These temperatures are at low altitudes. Because Switzerland is not always the same altitude, temperatures may vary. In general one can assume that the temperature may decrease 1°C per 100m altitude gained. This means while on a hot summer day in Zurich with 30°C, at the top of Jungfrau, you will be met with temperatures 0°C and snow.\n\nMay in Switzerland\n\nMay sees a significant warm-up, with temperatures climbing from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F), making it a lovely time to explore the colorful and lively cities and countryside. The cities and lowlands are beautiful and green, with flowers in full bloom and temperatures that are comfortably warm but not hot. It’s a great time for hiking in the lower elevations, as the trails are clear and the views are spectacular.\n\nIn the Alps, the snow has mostly melted at lower elevations, but many high-altitude attractions and trails may still be closed or preparing to open. May is perfect for a relaxed city trip or exploring the scenic lakes and countryside. It’s also an ideal time for cultural visits, as museums and historic sites are less crowded than during peak tourist months.\n\nSpring in the Jungfrau Region | Travel Guide\n\nJuly in Switzerland\n\nJuly is peak summer in Switzerland, with long, sunny days and temperatures averaging between 20°C and 30°C (68°F and 86°F). This is the best time for outdoor activities. You can swim in the crystal-clear lakes, hike through in the Swiss Alps, and enjoy the vibrant outdoor festivals that pop up across the country.\n\nThe cities are lively with events, and the whole country takes on a festive atmosphere. In the mountains, you’ll find ideal conditions for hiking, with all the trails open and plenty of alpine flowers in full bloom. It’s also a great time for mountain biking, paragliding, and other adventurous activities. Do keep in mind that this is a busy month, so popular spots can be crowded, and accommodation prices may be higher.\n\nThe Best Cogwheel Train Rides in Switzerland\n\nSeptember in Switzerland\n\nSeptember is a fantastic time to visit Switzerland, often considered the sweet spot for travel.

It’s also the beginning of the grape harvest in regions like the Lavaux vineyards, offering a great opportunity to enjoy wine tours and tastings. September is a wonderful month for hiking, with clear trails and mild weather, making it ideal for both beginners and seasoned hikers.\n\nBavona Valley: What to See and Things to Do\n\nDecember in Switzerland\n\nDecember brings a magical atmosphere to Switzerland as the country gears up for the holiday season.
