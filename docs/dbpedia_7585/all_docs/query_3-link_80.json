        "text": "As the largest city in Switzerland, there is so much to see in Zurich. This city will leave you fascinated by its architecture, atmosphere, luxury and the nature that surrounds it. With breathtaking views of the Alps, a visit to Zurich is not to be missed. Read on to find out what to do on your trip to Zurich Switzerland!\n\nYou’ll be able to wander through its iconic old town, as well as its landmarks and colourful streets. Located at the confluence of Lake Zurich and the Limmat River, in this city you can enjoy spectacular nature while being in the cultural and financial heart of the country. Don’t let the prices scare you off, come and discover the wonders of Switzerland!\n\nWhat to do in Zurich\n\nGrossmünster Church\n\nThe Grossmünster Church is considered one of the most iconic religious buildings in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. It dates back to the 1100s and 1220s, and it exudes a beauty and elegance typical of the Romanesque style.\n\nAs well as being of great architectural importance, this church also has great history, as it was the site where the Protestant Reformation began in Switzerland in 1519. We recommend taking a walk around the cathedral to admire its architectural beauty, as well as going inside and appreciating the impressive stained glass windows, the bronze doors, the Romanesque crypt and other characteristic features. And if that wasn’t enough, you can climb one of its towers and enjoy incredible views over the river and the city.\n\nHow much does it cost to enter Grossmünster Church? The entrance fee to the church is 2 Swiss francs, equivalent to €1.3.\n\nWhat are the opening hours of the church? The opening hours from November to February are Monday to Saturday from 10:00 to 16:00. The opening hours from March to October are Monday to Saturday from 9:00 to 16:00.\n\nZurich Old Town\n\nAnother place that should be at the top of your list of things to see in Zurich is, without a doubt, its spectacular old town. It is made up of four distinct neighbourhoods, which are surrounded by the ruins of the medieval city wall.\n\nAs you stroll through these four neighbourhoods, you can discover their lively streets, some of the most significant monuments and buildings, and other places of interest. It is also an area that is very busy due to its restaurants and small shops, as well as its large pedestrian areas. We recommend strolling around here at sunset and then enjoying a pleasant dinner in the area. You’ll love it!\n\nBahnhofstrasse\n\nBahnhofstrasse is one of the most famous streets in Zurich Switzerland, being especially known for being the station street. Here you can not only enjoy a pleasant stroll, but you can also go shopping in some of the world’s most famous shops.\n\nEnjoy its one and a half kilometres, gazing at the luxurious shop windows, as well as many cafés and restaurants, art galleries and other places of interest. This street has previously been compared to Barcelona’s Paseo de Gracia or New York’s Fifth Avenue. If you love shopping and luxury, or if you simply like to walk around every corner of the city, don’t hesitate to visit Bahnhofstrasse.\n\nBotanical Gardens\n\nThe Zurich Botanical Garden can be the perfect place to spend a Sunday afternoon, as well as being a must-see in the city. It’s only a 30-minute walk from the city centre, and admission is completely free.\n\nDuring your visit, you can enjoy an extensive natural open-air space, and learn about more than 7,000 species of plants as you walk through the three greenhouses. As well as learning a lot about trees, plants and flowers, you can enjoy incredible tranquillity and sit on one of the benches to enjoy the peace and quiet.\n\nWhat are the opening hours of the Botanical Garden? The Botanical Garden is open from March to September, Monday to Friday from 7:00 to 19:00, and Saturdays and Sundays from 8:00 to 18:00. The opening hours from October to February are Monday to Friday from 8:00 to 18:00, and Saturdays and Sundays from 8:00 to 17:00.\n\nThe Opera House\n\nThe Opera House is an impressive neoclassical building, dating back to 1891. Today it is one of the most iconic sights of Zurich, as well as being in a square that acts as a meeting place for locals.\n\nIt can hold up to 1,100 people and has seen many star performers in the world of opera and ballet. You can book a guided tour to discover all its rooms and admire its beautiful interior decoration.\n\nHow much does a ticket to the Opera cost? A guided tour costs around €9.\n\nWhat are the opening hours of the Opera House? The Opera is open every day from 11:00 to 18:00, except Sundays.\n\nLake Zurich\n\nLake Zurich is one of the most visited and appreciated spots by travellers and locals alike. Located southeast of Zurich, the lake provides a pleasant place to walk and spectacular scenery, surrounded by valleys and mountains.\n\nThe lake is more than 40 kilometres long and has an intriguing banana shape. There are many ways to explore it or simply stroll along its shores, either on foot or by bike. The brave sometimes dare to go for a swim in summer! Enjoy a lovely picnic on one of its beaches, take a boat trip or even visit some of its most luxurious villas. You will be fascinated.\n\nÜetliberg Lookout Tower\n\nThe Üetliberg Lookout offers one of the most spectacular views over the city of Zurich and the surrounding area, and is 870 metres above sea level. From up there you can get incredible pictures not only of the city, but also of the mountains and the Alps. Just make sure you go on a clear day!\n\nYou can reach the viewpoint by train or tram. Before reaching the top, you can go on numerous excursions along the trails in the area, as well as stopping for a rest in one of the restaurants. We recommend arriving at the viewpoint while the sun is setting to enjoy this unique experience – you won’t regret it!\n\nHow to get to the lookout tower? To get to the viewpoint, you can take tram line 13, which will take you to Albisguiti. From there you can walk for about 45 minutes along a path. Another option is to take the train from the central station, which takes 20 minutes.\n\nLindenhof\n\nLindenhof is one of the most famous and iconic districts in Zurich. It is the oldest part of the city and located between the famous Bahnhofstrasse and the Limmat River.\n\nThe most noteable aspect of this neighbourhood is its medieval character. You can stroll through many steep cobbled streets, where you will feel as though you have travelled back in time. You will come across some historic buildings of great cultural importance, as well as Roman ruins. It is also the ideal place to visit small artisan shops or stop for a drink in one of its cafés. Don’t hesitate to go up to the hill, from where you can see the city from a different perspective.\n\nWhat to do around Zurich?\n\nRhine Falls\n\nThe Rhine Falls are made uo of more than 15,000 individual fallls, having formed during the last ice age. It is the largest waterfall in Europe, up to 150 metres wide and 23 metres high – and just 50 kilometres from Zurich!\n\nOnce you’ve finished admiring the falls, we recommend a visit to the famous Laufen Castle, which is more than 1,000 years old and located in the middle of a cliff at the top of the falls. It has been converted into a hotel and hostel, so staying there can be an excellent option to enjoy the idyllic natural surroundings. Don’t miss out!\n\nHow to get to the Rhine Falls? A convenient way to visit the Rhine Falls is to take a train from Zurich station to Schaffhausen. Once there, take bus number 1, right in front of the station. You’ll be there in 10 minutes, getting off at the Zentrum stop in Stein an Rhein.\n\nSchaffhausen\n\nThe next place to visit around Zurich, especially if you are coming from the Rhine Falls, is the beautiful village of Schaffhausen, just 4 kilometres away from the falls and only 45 minutes from Zurich.\n\nThis small Swiss village is characterised by its medieval architecture and its great historical importance. In the past, due to its location, it was a very important transfer and storage point for commercial sales in order to avoid the disasters caused by the waterfalls. We recommend spending at least a whole morning or afternoon in this small town and see all its symbolic spots. You will love it!\n\nHow to get to Schaffhausen? The most convenient way to get to Schaffhausen is to take a train from Zurich Central Station. The journey takes about an hour, with beautiful views from the train.\n\nWhat to do in Zurich in 1 day?\n\nZurich Old Town\n\nGrossmünster Church\n\nZurich Botanical Garden\n\nBahnhofstrasse\n\nLake Zurich\n\nWhat to do in Zurich in 2 days?\n\nZurich Opera House\n\nÜetliberg Lookout Tower\n\nLidenhof\n\nGetaway to Schaffhausen\n\nVisit the Rhine Falls\n\nWhere to eat in Zurich?\n\nIt is well known that prices in Zurich are not particularly cheap, and this applies across the board.
