        "text": "To see all pics from Tuesday, you might also want to check out my other topics:\n\nAir Force 1 landing in the early morning + Business Jets\n\nAir Force 1 Ramp Tour\n\nWelcome back!\n\nIt’s been a while, wasn’…oh wait it was earlier today. As promised, here’s part two of three featuring my shots from our crazy trip to Zurich, this time it’s all about airliners. Since I’m sure you are all already hyped for the apron tour pics I won’t talk to much and get right into the topic.\n\nLet’s start with the newest plane at Zurich, helvetic’s brand new Embraer E190-E2.\n\nBut it can also be much bigger. Swiss’ beautiful Boeing 777 inbound for runway 14…\n\n…and also causing quite some vortices on landing seconds after. A heavy edit for a change ;)\n\nZurich isn’t only hub for Swiss and helvetic, but also for Swiss’ low cost subsidiary edelweiss which is also operating touristic long haul flights.\n\nWhat’s cooler than two long haul planes with two engines? Correct, a long haul plane with four (underpowered) engines. Sadly the fleet of Swiss A340s is shrinking and is down to 5 now, so I was happy to finally get a nice shot of it.\n\nApparently, people are not the only ones interested in aviation. At some point this beautiful bird joined us watching the arriving KLM 737.\n\nAnother Swiss aircraft, but not operated by Swiss - Swiss Air Ambulance inbound from Lugano with their tiny jet.\n\nFinnair brought their A319 on the morning rotation…\n\n…and airBaltic operated their flight with the first plane to wear their updated livery - Lufthansa Style\n\nNot only updated but entirely new is chair - the airline formerly known as Germania Switzerland. After the bankruptcy of their German mother they came up with this beautiful livery, yet weird company name…\n\nRight after that shot we started our apron tour. Stay tuned for the amazing pics in the next topic!\n\nYou can follow me on twitter and Instagram to get more shots on a daily basis. Also, keep your eyes open on Flightradar24 where you might see some of my recent shots.\n\nTwitter\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mba_muc\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mba_muc/\n\nMy spotting topics on the IFC (sorted by years since this is slowly getting endless)\n\n2018\n\nSpring Spotting 1\n\nSpring Spotting 2 with Lorenzo\n\nSpring Spotting 3 (feat.
