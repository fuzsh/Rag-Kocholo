        "text": "Zurich is considered as one of the most beautiful destinations of Switzerland. It has a different charm in all four seasons of the year. If you are deciding as to when is the best time to visit Zurich, you need to learn about its climate chart first. So, let’s take a look into it first:\n\nSpring (March to May): This is an off-season for Zurich. Though the initial stage of the season experiences low temperature. By the beginning of April, the temperature starts rising up. As this is a shoulder season, there is a high chance to find some lower hotel rates. Festivals like ZuriCarnival (March) and Zurich Marathon (April) are some of the festivals celebrated in this season.\n\nSummer (June to August): This is the peak season for Zurich. With lots of opportunities for outdoor activities and festive celebrations, this season has become the prime time to visit this city. Hence, streets remain crowded with tourists. And at the same time, both the flights and hotel deals shoot up. Festivals that take place in this season are: Street Parade Zurich (August) and Zurich Price (June).\n\nAutumn/fall (September to November): Like spring, this is another shoulder season in Zurich. Though the climate becomes pretty cool as compare to summer, still in this season the city does see many tourists coming here to enjoy the beauty of the fall season. One of the added advantages of this season is, you might chance upon some discounted hotel rates.\n\nWinter (December to February): Winter is considered as the low season for Zurich. However, with snow covering the peaks of the Swiss Alps, the mountain becomes a haven for winter sports lover to enjoy activities like skiing and snowboarding. On the other hand, the hotel price doesn’t go down. This is because of the Christmas festival that is done in a grand way in Zurich.\n\nHence, spring and autumn turns out to be the best time to visit Zurich. But travelers who are not bothered about tourist crowds, they can choose summer as it is the peak season for the city."
