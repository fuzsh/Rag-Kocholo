However, for understanding past extreme weather events and for relating them to impacts, for example through crop yield simulations or hydrological modelling, reconstructions on a weather timescale are needed. Here, we present a data set of 258 years of daily temperature and precipitation fields for Switzerland from 1763 to 2020. The data set was reconstructed with the analogue resampling method, which resamples meteorological fields for a historical period based on the most similar day in a reference period. These fields are subsequently improved with data assimilation for temperature and bias correction for precipitation. Even for an early period prior to 1800 with scarce data availability, we found good validation results for the temperature reconstruction especially in the Swiss Plateau. For the precipitation reconstruction, skills are considerably lower, which can be related to the few precipitation measurements available and the heterogeneous nature of precipitation. By means of a case study of the wet and cold years from 1769 to 1772, which triggered widespread famine across Europe, we show that this data set allows more detailed analyses than hitherto possible.",

        "text": "2.1âHistorical instrumental data\n\nSystematic measurements of meteorological data in Switzerland only started in the 1860s with the establishment of the national weather service (Hupfer,Â 2019; Begert etÂ al.,Â 2005). To reconstruct weather in the late 18th and early 19th century, we, therefore, relied on data that have been rescued by various initiatives (Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2020b; Pfister etÂ al.,Â 2019; Camuffo and Jones,Â 2002; KleinÂ Tank etÂ al.,Â 2002; FÃ¼llemann etÂ al.,Â 2011; Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2022). Such early instrumental data are challenging to work with because common measurement standards had not yet been developed when the observations were recorded. Difficulties with early instrumental data arise for example from the construction of the ancient measurement devices, unknown measurement devices and liquids, inappropriate location of the devices, exposure to radiation, and missing or ambiguous observation times (Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2020b). For early temperature measurements, for example, unstable glass contracting with age, differences in the expansion rate of the liquids in the glass, and exposure to radiation or precipitation can create errors in the measurements (Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2020b; Winkler,Â 2006; BÃ¶hm etÂ al.,Â 2010). It was already recognized in the 18th century that a thermometer needs to be sheltered from solar radiation (Pfister,Â 1988). However, even thermometers placed on north-facing walls, as was common after 1760, were still influenced by radiation (BÃ¶hm etÂ al.,Â 2010) and often showed warm biases. Sources of errors for pressure measurements include device-related issues (Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2020a) but also the required temperature corrections due to the thermal expansion of the liquid in the barometers. Temperature corrections can introduce errors in pressure measurements when no attached thermometer is available, when temperature measurements are not representative of the barometer, or when the corrections applied are unclear. The manual measurements in our network were taken between two and eight times per day. Calculating an arithmetic daily mean for temperature and pressure based on only a few measurements a day or on varying measurement times introduces biases in daily means. Also, observation times of early instrumental data can be ambiguous, for example when the time is denoted as âmorningâ or âeveningâ, and it is therefore not straightforward to include these in a daily mean estimation. These above-described examples affect the quality of the measurements used for the reconstruction, and corrections are often difficult. The quality of early instrumental data thus has to be kept in mind when working with the reconstruction.\n\nFor the reconstruction from 1763 to 1863, we selected time series that showed sufficient data quality (BrÃ¶nnimann,Â 2020) and that cover at least 7 continuous years to keep the reconstruction as spatially and temporally consistent as possible. However, the network changes considerably throughout time (Fig.Â 1), and coverage is much sparser compared to the network after 1864, which has been used for the reconstruction from 1864 to 2020 in Pfister etÂ al. (2020) (Fig.Â 1d and e). At the start of the reconstruction period in 1763, around 11 to 12 series are available (Fig. 1a), which then increases to around 30 series (Fig.Â 1c). To increase the number of observations for this early period we also used time series from nearby locations in Italy and Germany. In total, the reconstruction is based on 17 pressure series, 18 temperature series, and 6 precipitation and precipitation occurrence series. Because only very few precipitation measurements were available, we also include precipitation occurrence as a variable that has been derived from weather notes. FigureÂ 1f shows the evolution of monthly data availability, and TableÂ 1 lists all time series used for the reconstruction period of 1763 to 1863.\n\nMost of the instrumental data for the reconstruction were already available in modern units, and their quality was checked on a subdaily basis (for details, seeÂ Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2020b). The data preparation necessary thus included the calculation of daily mean values, pressure reduction where not available, additional quality control on daily means and the homogenization of the time series.\n\nTo adjust the daily mean value based on only a few subdaily measurements, we subtracted a correction according to the historical measurement times. These corrections were calculated for every month of the year separately based on the anomalies of the 10âmin monthly means from automatic weather stations for the period of 1981 to 2010. If no weather stations were available in the surrounding area, the corrections were calculated from the hourly 2âm temperature of the closest grid point from ERA5-Land (MuÃ±oz-Sabater etÂ al.,Â 2021) for 1981 to 2010. The anomalies were calculated by subtracting the daily mean of each month from the 10âmin measurements. The final correction value was obtained by taking the mean of the anomalies according to the closest measurement times. For pressure, the daily mean correction was applied for all time series using the closest grid point from hourly ERA5-Land surface pressure data for 1981 to 2010. If no observation times were available, we tried to estimate the observation times by comparing the subdaily values to the daily cycle derived from present-day measurements, which, however, can introduce additional errors. For three time series, a temperature reduction in pressure was not conducted because no attached temperature measurements have been found. Therefore, we reduced the pressure to 0ââC based on the climatology of daily mean temperature data for the period of 1850 to 1900 from the reanalysis 20CRv3 (Slivinski etÂ al.,Â 2019; Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2020b). For subdaily weather notes, every day containing at least one precipitation event was transformed into a precipitation day. We did not convert descriptions such as dew and rime to precipitation because they were not available for all stations.\n\nFurther, we performed a standard quality control on the daily means of each time series as implemented in Brugnara etÂ al. (2019) and a spatial quality control using linear regression between the nearby five stations (EstÃ©vez etÂ al.,Â 2018). Together with the standard quality control, we flagged between 0â% to 1.16â% of the values (with a mean of 0.12â%) depending on the time series. For precipitation occurrence, we calculated the monthly wet-day frequency for the series and excluded series that substantially deviated from other series or that showed substantial visual breaks.\n\nWe homogenized the quality-controlled series using surface temperature and pressure from the closest grid point of the EKF400v2 reanalysis (Valler etÂ al.,Â 2022) as a reference series (see Sect.Â 2.4). Break point detection was performed with the penalized maximal t test (Wang etÂ al.,Â 2007) and the penalized maximal F test (Wang,Â 2008), which are implemented in Wang and Feng (2013). Only break points that were significant without metadata were considered since only very few metadata are available. For Bern, Zurich, Basel, and Geneva homogenized series were used which are based on various short series (Brugnara etÂ al.,Â 2022; Brugnara,Â 2022).\n\nAs an independent evaluation of our reconstruction, we used seven temperature time series and one time series of precipitation occurrence during 1763 and 1863 (see asterisks in Fig.Â 1a and TableÂ 2). The temperature time series were prepared following the same approach as for the series used in the reconstruction itself, but no homogenization was performed.\n\nBrÃ¶nnimann and Brugnara (2020a)BrÃ¶nnimann and Brugnara (2021)Brugnara etÂ al.

All periods show a spatial pattern with the highest correlations in the Swiss Plateau, lower values in the Alpine region, and the lowest values in the Canton of Ticino. The winter months (December to February) show the lowest correlation values, especially in the Alpine region, followed by autumn (SON) and spring (MAM). These spatial and seasonal differences are also present in the RMSE and MSESS evaluation (Fig.Â 3f to o). RMSEs range between 0.45 and 3.82ââC, with an average of 1.04 to 1.59ââC for all time aggregations. In winter, the errors are largest in the very south and east of Switzerland and in the Jura. MSESS values range between 0.34 and 0.98. The lowest values are found in the valleys of the Ticino, especially around Lago Maggiore in winter and autumn. Mean biases range between â0.34 and +0.08ââC (Fig.Â 3p to t). In winter, pronounced cold biases are present in the Alpine region, southern Switzerland, and the Jura. This is also the case for autumn, but biases are smaller. In spring, the largest cold biases are mainly found in the Alps but not in the Ticino, whereas in summer, biases range only between â0.06 and +0.08ââC.\n\nDownload\n\nDownload\n\nSpatial correlations do not show large differences in their performance with respect to the different deciles of the area mean for summer and winter and both altitude groups (Fig.Â 4a and b). In winter, RMSEs are larger for the coldest and the warmest days, while days in the middle of the distribution show lower errors. At altitudes above 1000âmâa.s.l.Â in particular, the warmest days show larger RMSEs. In summer, cold days have low RMSEs, and the RMSEs increase with increasing temperatures. This effect is more pronounced for the higher-altitude group. The mean bias in the low-altitude group (below 1000âmâa.s.l.) does not show differences in the deciles. However, for the higher-altitude group, the very cold days are too warm in the reconstruction and the very warm days are too cold. In summer, such an effect is not visible, but the spread of the mean bias distribution is generally larger for warm days than cold days.\n\nCross-validation results of the different networks, however, vary considerably. The network with only 11 measurements (Fig.Â 1a) has the lowest correlations, with values ranging between 0.58 and 0.99 for winter and 0.64 and 0.99 for summer (Fig.Â 5a and b). In the winter months in particular, this network performed worse with respect to correlation, RMSE, and MSESS. In summer, differences between networks are much smaller (Fig.Â 5b). The increase in observations in 1864 showed much better performance for all metrics; however, the change in the network from 41 observations to 108 did not lead to substantial improvements in the reconstructions. The spatial analyses of all five networks are shown in Fig.Â A1 in AppendixÂ A for the annual evaluation.\n\nDownload\n\nFurther, the persistence of day-to-day temperature variability is slightly underestimated in the reconstructions compared to the original grid (Appendix, Fig.Â A3) with differences in the autocorrelations reaching up to 0.15 for the sparse networks. In the alpine areas in particular, autocorrelation at lags of up to 10âd is lower than in the original grid. This can be related to the network density and set-up. The sparser networks have lower autocorrelation values in the areas with very few observations.\n\nThese spatial and seasonal differences may be related to the sparse and unevenly distributed station network and the seasonal meteorological situations typical of Switzerland. In the winter half year (October to March) during calm flow situations, radiation fog and lifted fog (i.e. low stratus clouds) are a frequent phenomenon in the Swiss Plateau (Scherrer and Appenzeller,Â 2014). Such situations block direct radiation, leading to significantly lower temperatures below the cloud layer. Because temperature data were mainly available in the Swiss Plateau below this inversion layer, a day that is too cold for the Alpine area may be selected as an analogue day and the temperature assimilation may be too cold because the Alpine inversion layer is not well captured. An evaluation of fog days showed these large biases for the Alpine area (not shown). This is confirmed by the biases seen in Fig.Â 3kâo and would also lead to lower correlations and MSESS and larger RMSE. The overall better performance in summer compared to winter for all networks (Fig.Â 5a and b) can also be related to such badly captured inversion layers, which are not present in summer months. For a reconstruction of monthly temperature, Isotta etÂ al. (2019) found that the magnitude of the warm anomalies in the areas above the inversion is not reproduced if only a few stations are available in the Alpine regions. For the network with only 11 stations (Fig.Â 1a), the temperature bias in winter is actually smaller compared to the network with 21 and 32 measurements (Fig.Â 1b and c). NetworksÂ 2 and 3 already contain the German station in HohenpeiÃenberg at an altitude of 995âmâa.s.l., and they also have more stations in the Swiss Plateau. An inversion layer captured wrongly because of the station distribution may also cause a larger bias.\n\nThe cross-validation of the precipitation reconstruction shows a lower performance compared to de-seasonalized temperature (Figs.Â 5 and 6). Spearman correlations range between 0.39 and almost 1 for all seasons and the annual evaluation considering the network with 32 measurements (Fig.Â 5c). The Alpine region does not stand out in as pronounced a way as for the temperature validation. However, southern Switzerland, the Ticino, and the southern Grison valleys do have correlation values of only 0.35. In contrast with temperature, correlations are generally higher for winter than for summer months. RMSE ranges between 3.09 and 26.89 and is highest during the summer months in the Ticino. The Brier score is close to 0 around the locations where precipitation occurrence is registered and decreases with distance. As for the other metrics, especially in the summer months, the southern Ticino and southern Grison have very low values. The mean bias in all seasons is close to 0 because we conducted quantile mapping taking into account the annual cycle of precipitation differences between the reconstruction and the original data set (Fig.Â 5p to t).\n\nWith respect to the intensity of events in winter, days with more precipitation on an area-wide basis show higher correlations than days with less precipitation (Fig.Â 4c). In summer, spatial correlations do not vary in the median with respect to the area average intensity; however, the spread of the correlation increases for days with higher total precipitation. As is to be expected, the RMSE increases with increasing intensity of a rainy day. In summer in particular the RMSE can reach very high values for the strongest events. For higher altitudes, the values are even larger. These high values come from an underestimation of the strong precipitation events in both winter and summer, which is shown in Fig.Â 4c andÂ d. Despite the bias correction, extreme precipitation is underestimated in the reconstruction by a median of up to 10âmm.\n\nDifferences between the networks are substantial for summer and winter (Fig.Â 5c and d), but the performance is generally better in winter than in summer. The sparsest network has a median correlation of 0.68, which increases considerably when stations are added. For the two networks after 1864, however, no more substantial changes occur. RMSEs are between 3.09 and 29.45âmm for the three networks of the early period and between 1.72 and 12.74âmm afterwards in winter. For the summer season, they are almost twice as large. For the annual evaluation of precipitation, the spatial analyses of all networks are shown in Fig.Â A2 in AppendixÂ A.\n\nAlso, the persistence of dry and wet spells is underestimated in the reconstructions, although only slightly and with regional differences (AppendixÂ Fig.Â A4). The fraction of dry (wet) days followed by dry (wet) days is up to 0.14 smaller in the reconstruction compared to the original data. The underestimation of the wet-day persistence is largest in the Ticino and for the sparse networks, indicating that wet spells are less well captured. For the dry-day persistence, no spatial pattern is visible. A lower persistence for both wet and dry days in the reconstruction can be expected since the analogue resampling does not consider temporal information.\n\nThe lower performance of the precipitation reconstruction can be expected, since precipitation is a much more heterogeneous variable than temperature on a daily timescale, impeding daily reconstruction, especially when only very few precipitation data are available. The performance differences in the reconstruction between winter and summer can be related to the type of precipitation occurring in these seasons. In summer, precipitation can be convective and very local, while in winter, precipitation is often stratiform, covering larger areas. This stratiform precipitation is easier to reconstruct. The Brier score decreases faster around the stations in summer than in winter. The poor performance with large RMSEs in the Ticino and the south-eastern Grison valley may come from convective or orographic precipitation not being captured at all in the precipitation data covering only northern Switzerland. But intense precipitation events are also difficult to capture in northern Switzerland (Fig.Â 4c and d). In contrast with Pfister etÂ al. (2020), the mean bias of the uppermost percentile (Fig.Â 4c and d, lowest row) is on average negative; i.e. the reconstructed values are too low compared to the original. This may be because very few precipitation measurements enter the reconstruction, and thus days with high precipitation are not selected from the analogue pool.\n\nThe cross-validation results give us an impression of the performance of our reconstruction. However, they have some limitations. The cross-validation was performed based on station data in the reference period. These measurement data have a much higher quality than what we know from early instrumental data (see Sect.Â 2.1). Further, our analogue pool covers the same period as our reconstruction period. Therefore, it covers the same longer-scale variabilities but not necessarily in the same way as they occur in the early period between 1763 and 1863. With respect to temperature, we calculated an offset in order to account for the climatic change between the 18th century and the late 20th and early 21th centuries. This offset is based on a state-of-the-art data set but may not be accurate for the small and topographically heterogeneous area of Switzerland, thus adding an additional source of errors to the reconstruction.\n\n4.2âEvaluation with independent data\n\nA comparison with independent observations allowed us to assess the performance of the reconstruction in the reconstructed period itself, but the quality of the observations has to be considered. Temperature observations with removed seasonality in Aarau, Fribourg, Herisau, and Tegerfelden show Pearson correlations mostly above 0.85 (Fig.Â 7a to d). Nufenen, Bellinzona, and Lucerne show considerably lower values. The same pattern is also seen for the MSESS. RMSEs range between 1 and 4ââC. Again, Aarau, Fribourg, Herisau, and Tegerfelden have the smallest errors. The mean bias based on absolute values is mostly between â2 and 2ââC for Fribourg, Herisau, and Tegerfelden. For Bellinzona, Lucerne, and Nufenen, the reconstruction shows colder values than the observations in all seasons.\n\nDownload\n\nFribourg, Herisau, Tegerfelden, and Aarau are all located in areas with a high station density (see Fig.Â 1). This contributes to the better performance of the reconstruction in these areas, but their good agreement confirms that for the Swiss Plateau our reconstruction provides useful results. Nufenen and Bellinzona show the lowest correlation values and the largest biases. For Bellinzona, BrÃ¶nnimann and Brugnara (2022) showed that the subdaily measurements in July are considerably warmer than what is expected from the daily cycle representative of this area, most likely because of radiative biases. This would explain the fact that the reconstruction is colder than the observations, which is especially pronounced in summer (Fig.Â 7e). Furthermore, Bellinzona lies in an area with no nearby observations used in the reconstruction. Due to this, we would expect cold mean biases for winter as seen in the cross-validation but not for summer (Fig.Â 3). For Nufenen, the closest grid cell in the reconstruction corresponds to an altitude of 1866âmâa.s.l., whereas the village Nufenen, where the measurements were taken, is at 1580âmâa.s.l. An altitudinal difference of 300âm can explain the large negative biases found between observation and reconstruction.\n\nFor precipitation, a comparison with independent observations is only possible for a series of precipitation occurrence in Bern between 1807 and 1818. Based on the cross-validation, we can expect a Brier score of between 0.15 and 0.2 (i.e. up to 20â% of the days are wrongly assigned to a wet or dry day) for this location and the respective network. The Brier score between the closest grid cell in Bern and the precipitation occurrence series from weather notes yields 0.24 and is thus higher than the cross-validation results. However, we compare a station measurement with a grid cell (of 1Ã1âkm) covering a slightly different scale. Also, precipitation occurrence may have a problem with accounting for nighttime precipitation correctly for the exact day of the weather notes. The gridded data are a daily sum between 06:00 in the morning and 06:00 the next day, while this may not be entirely clear for the weather notes. FigureÂ 7f shows precipitation occurrence for a dry (1811) and a very wet year (1816). Long-lasting dry spells such as in March and AprilÂ 1811 are captured by the reconstruction, as well as the overall wet summer of 1816, but for individual days, reconstructions deviate from observations. This is also seen in the comparison of the monthly wet-day frequency from the reconstruction and observation (Fig.Â 7g), which agree well overall (Pearson correlation of 0.84)."
