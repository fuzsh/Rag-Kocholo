        "text": "Zurich is a vibrant cosmopolitan city steeped in culture and history dating back 5000 years. A beautiful river and a stunning lake surrounded by lush green hills add to the charm of this city.\n\nI’ve lived in Zurich for a couple of years and can already understand why it ranks so highly on the list of cities with the world’s best quality of life. Head on to Zurich to discover for yourself and be prepared to be amazed at the plentiful opportunities (and mostly free ones!) for leisure, enjoyment and relaxation and the beautiful cultural and gastronomic diversity.\n\nPlanning a trip to Switzerland? Click here for a detailed travel guide to Switzerland – including the best time to visit, itinerary options (for 3, 5, 7 or 10 days), visa, transportation in Switzerland (including Swiss Pass), and more!\n\nHere are more ideas for your trip to Switzerland: 25 best places to visit in Switzerland!\n\nNote: This post contains some affiliate links. This means if you make a purchase through these, I may earn a small commission, at absolutely no extra cost to you. Thank you for your support!\n\nThings to do in Zurich – All year round\n\nStroll along the Bahnhofstrasse\n\nThe famous shopping boulevard of Zurich, Bahnhofstrasse is where you should start your day exploring the city. The Bahnhofstrasse connects the lake to the main train station and is ~1.5 km long. Start from the main train station and head into the street – just follow the crowds and you won’t miss it!\n\nBahnhofstrasse is a tram-only street, lined with shops, cafes and restaurants. While there are multiple high-end stores, there are several department stores also located here where you can shop. Switzerland is expensive so don’t expect to find cheap bargains! January and July though are great times to visit since most stores have products on sale.\n\nHave limited time in Switzerland? Here’s a 5-day Switzerland itinerary to take in the best of the country!\n\nVisit Lindenhof\n\nTake a turn from Bahnhofstrasse into Rennweg (another charming shopping street) and head towards the historic spot of Lindenhof. Located on a hill, you can look out over the river, the old town and the mountains from this spot. Lindenhof is steeped in history – it has been an important meeting point since the 4th century when a Roman fort was built here.\n\nTransport yourself back in time at the Zurich Old Town\n\nFrom Lindenhof, walk towards Niederdorf, the charming old town district. Car-free, cobbled stone streets lined with boutiques and small shops – this area combines the best of history, architecture & shopping! Stroll along the Limmat river taking in the beautiful old town and the romantic streets.\n\nAlso located here is the landmark of Zurich – the Grossmünster church. The twin spires of the church are as recognizable as the glamorous Bahnhofstrasse. Beautiful bronze doors and stained glass windows add to the delight of visiting this church.\n\nCross the bridge across the Limmat and you’ll find yourself at the Fraumünster church, another of Zurich’s highlights. More than 1000 years old, this church is known for its stained-glass windows by Chagall.\n\nRelax at Sechseläutenplatz\n\nAs you walk from the old town towards the lake you’ll come to one of the largest squares in Switzerland – Sechseläutenplatz. Located between the Zurich Opera House and Bellvue, this square has several cafes and restaurants around it making it the perfect spot for a lunch break. This square is also the site for the spring festival of Sechseläuten.\n\nCatch a show at the Zurich Opera House if you have the time – it offers a very diverse array of performances and is one of the most renowned in Europe.\n\nEnjoy Lake Zurich\n\nOne of Switzerland’s largest lakes, Lake Zurich is a sight to behold.\n\nTake a stroll along the lake promenade which is right next to the Sechseläutenplatz. There are plenty of places to sit and enjoy the views and maybe get ice cream too!\n\nAnother fun way to explore the lake is to take a cruise. Head to one of the nearby towns such as Rapperswil or Thalwil or just enjoy the scenery on a round trip cruise! Head to the ticket and information centre located near Bürkliplatz (a short walk along the lake from Sechseläutenplatz) to get your tickets.\n\nDelight in the panoramic views at Uetliberg\n\nZurich’s own mountain, Uetliberg is the perfect place to get panoramic views across the lake and the city. You can take the train up to the mountain and walk 10-15 minutes to reach the summit. There are several hiking routes on this mountain where you can enjoy hiking in the summer and sledding in the winter.\n\nI can see this mountain from my balcony and I love watching the weather change over it – a fresh coating of snow in April or bright green trees in June, it’s a beautiful sight.\n\nDiscover art at Zurich’s prominent museums\n\nSeveral art museums showcase beautiful art collections for art lovers in Zurich. The most renowned of these, the Kunsthaus Zürich houses not only a collection of Classical Modernism but also Swiss paintings and sculptures.\n\nEnjoy Zurich’s nightlife\n\nHead to Langstrasse to sample Zurich’s diverse bars and clubs or join a pub crawl tour to discover more! If live music is what you are looking for, head here to find the best live music venues in Zurich.\n\nMore things to do in Zurich – In the summer/ spring\n\nGo hiking\n\nZurich offers the best of both worlds – a beautiful city steeped in history & culture and numerous outdoor activities within an hour/ ninety minutes! Some of the most spectacular hikes, with sweeping panoramic views and some of my favourites, can be found at the mountains of Rigi, Uetliberg and Stoos. All these are easily reachable by public transportation.\n\nHere’s my complete guide on visiting Mt. Rigi\n\nTake a dip\n\nFancy a swim with a view of the Swiss Alps? Head to Seebad Enge or the historic Seebad Utoquai for a dip in Lake Zurich.\n\nFloat down the Limmat in a boat and jump out for a swim. Or join the fun summer event of The Limmat Swim where you float (or swim) down the river taking in the sights of the city. This swim starts at Seebad Utoquai and ends at Flussbad Oberer Lettern, Lettensteg. Purchase your tickets here.\n\nMore things to do in Zurich – In the winter\n\nEnjoy the Holiday Season\n\nChristmas is one of the best times to visit Zurich – it transforms the already beautiful city into nothing short of spectacular! Twinkling lights, huge Christmas trees (including a live singing one!), bustling markets, and scores of events, all add to the magic of Zurich.\n\nVisit the Christmas Markets\n\nStart at the main station and visit the largest covered market in the continent. This market boasts 100+ stalls and a huge Christmas tree decorated with thousands of Swarovski crystals as its centrepiece.\n\nWalk towards the old town under the twinkling lights through the magnificently decorated Bahnhofstrasse. The Christmas market in the old town is Zurich’s oldest and will captivate you with its romantic atmosphere. Sample some mulled wine and fondue to get into the spirit of the holiday!\n\nHead to Sechseläutenplatz for one of the largest Christmas markets in Zurich. The Opera House in the background of this market and the lake next to it add to the charm of this market.\n\nCheck out some of the Christmas events\n\nLichterschwimmen floating candle event is one of the most popular events in Zurich where hundreds of candles are placed in the Limmat river and it is a delight to watch them float down the river.\n\nThe Singing Christmas Tree is one of Zurich’s highlights during Christmas. Walk down the Bahnhofstrasse and you’ll find the choirs spread cheer from podiums set up in the form of a giant Christmas tree.\n\nHave you ever thought what hundreds of Sants’s swimming across a freezing river would like? Well, now that I have put that thought into your head, come on over to Zurich for the Samichlausschwimmen tradition.

The spring festival of Sechseläuten is celebrated in April – it translates to 6 o’clock ringing of bells. The tradition began more than 500 years ago when the church bells were used to signal the beginning of spring and the new working hours (accounting for daylight savings the workday would end at 6 pm instead of the wintertime of 5 pm). The celebrations for Sechseläuten include parades in elaborate costumes, horse-drawn floats and music ensembles. The main event is held at Sechseläutenplatz and involves a huge bonfire with the Böögg on top. The Böögg is a snowman packed with firecrackers symbolizing the end of winter. Traditionally, the faster the fire reaches the Böögg, the finer the summer will be!\n\nSpring is also the time when you can start exploring some of the amazing hiking options around Zurich.
