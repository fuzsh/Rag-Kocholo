We got you an expert guide with accommodation, packing, and sightseeing tips so that you are covered for the bucket list things to do in Zurich in winter!\n\nRich, luxurious, and picturesque are all words used to describe Switzerland’s banking capital, Zurich.

With crisper, snowy weather, Christmas charms, and the most delicious food, this city is a marvelous winter destination.\n\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links. If you click one of them, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.\n\nWhy visit Zurich in winter?\n\nThere are so many reasons to visit Zurich in winter, I mean there is moderate snow and the temperatures are not super cold (ask this Canadian, weather in Zurich is amazing – a light jacket and a little layering is all you NEED!), pretty Christmas markets, tons of shopping opportunities, delicious cheese and food, and outdoor activities to choose from.\n\nHere are some fantastic reasons to visit Zurich in winter\n\nChristmas Markets: There are beautiful Christmas markets sprinkled all across the Canton of Zurich. Start with the ones near the main train station, and you can venture out to Rapperswil, and nearby areas. It definitely feels super festive and stunning with all the decorations.\n\nSpecial Festive Events: From Advent for Children to light festivals, and seasonal menus, Christmas in Zurich is delightful! These events take place in December in Zurich.\n\nNew Year Festival in Zurich: The biggest New Year’s Eve Party called Silvesterzauber (New Year’s magic), takes place near Zurich’s lakeshore. This is an amazing outdoor event with food, and music, sort of like an open-air party. The event ends with fireworks display at night.\n\nShopping galore: Switzerland is expensive, but for those who love to spoil themselves or their loved ones, you can’t go wrong with shopping here. You can find all the luxurious brands, collections, and pretty festive souvenirs to take back home. Winters in Zurich bring in great retail deals and seasonal items, which are worth buying (I am a shopper, you can tell I can spend an entire day at the Bahnhofstrasse!)\n\nOff-season with fewer crowds, more relaxation: When we visited Zurich in winter, the city was very calm and quiet. There were not a lot of crowds, it was very easy to find a table at a restaurant or public transportation. With various parks across the city, this is a great time to sit and relax in Zurich.\n\nTemperature: Depending on what you are looking for, the weather and temperature in Zurich could be a pro or a con for you. We are used to wearing 4 layers of clothing and bundled up with all the winter accessories that we can find. So Zurich was delightful in the sense it is not very cold, temperatures range from 4 degrees celsius (high) to a low of -1 degree celsius! The snow is mild, so you can walk the old town in winter. If it’s rainy or windy, ensure you are bundled well, because sometimes it’s the wind that might dampen your spirit!\n\nWinter Activities: Although not super cold, you can enjoy winter sports (skating, skiing, tobogganing, etc.) in Zurich or take a trip to ski resorts nearby – Switzerland in winter has you covered!\n\nZurich winter weather & temperature\n\nZurich winter months are from December to February. Winter months also experience at least 10 days of rain, and we found that it is windy too especially when you head to Lake Zurich promenade or Lindenhof Hill.\n\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year and is also the cheapest to fly to Switzerland.\n\nZurich winter temperature\n\nWhat is the weather like in the winter in Zurich?\n\nDoes it snow in Zurich? In Zürich, it doesn’t snow a lot. Statistically speaking there is snowfall for 20 to 21 days. So if you are in Zurich for a white winter wonderland getaway, you may not be happy. But from Zurich, you can head to resorts and mountains to experience the same.\n\nHow cold does it get in Zurich? Although there is not a lot of snow, it gets cold in Zurich. So it’s important to dress appropriately. Evenings and early mornings will be chillier, and the wind is common. Remember it also rains for at least 10 days in a month in winter, so wear waterproof outerwear to be safe!\n\nWhat to pack for Zurich in winter?\n\nHere is a packing list for Zurich Switzerland in winter, you can grab a printable copy here\n\nWarm Boots – 1 or 2.

Visit a Christmas Market\n\nEuropean winter is almost synonymous with Christmas markets. And there is arguably no better place to experience your ideal festive fair than in Zurich. Mulled wine, the smell of cinnamon, and bright, cheerful lights transform the already beautiful city into a truly marvelous scene.\n\nThe city is host to a number of markets, each one offering a unique take on traditional festivities. Head to the market at the city’s main station where you’ll find a massive Christmas tree covered in Swarovski crystals. Or enjoy a cozy walk through one of the Old Town markets.\n\nThese markets usually start popping up in late November and close a couple of days before Christmas. So you have plenty of time to fit one or all of them into your winter travels. Each one has its own opening dates and hours, but you can check the schedules out here.\n\nZurich Christmas Markets: More information\n\nThere are 4 popular spots where Zurich hosts Christmas markets. They are\n\nAt the Old Town – Niederdorf Christmas Market (Dates: Nov 23 to Dec 23, 2023)\n\nZurich Train Station – Christkindlimarkt (Dates: Nov 24 to Dec 24, 2023)\n\nUrban Christmas Village – Wienachtsdorf Market (Dates: Nov 25 to Dec 23, 2023)\n\nWerdmuhleplatz Christmas Market (Dates: Nov 23 to Dec 23, 2023)\n\nYou will be spending a lot of time in the Old Town of Zurich, and this is where you can explore the oldest Christmas market in the city – Niederdorf Christmas Market. In and around the market, you will find the iconic Fraumunster Church and its stained glass windows casting a festive glow.\n\nZurich Train Station also hosts a Christmas Market, and it is also centrally located. And the best part is that it is an indoor market set up on the main concourse of the train station.\n\n‘Wienachtsdorf’ or the urban Christmas Village is the largest Christmas Market in Zurich. It is located near the Lake Zurich shoreline, and you can also skate in this village.\n\nWeihnachtsmart (and Singing Christmas Tree) is located near the main shopping street of Bahnhofstrasse.\n\nYou will be welcomed by sparkling lights glowing all along the street. As you head close to the Singing Christmas tree, there will be thousands more lights creating a lovely starry-studded landscape that glows in the dark!\n\n2. Browse the Many Museums and Art Galleries\n\nIf you’re looking to escape the cold for a few hours, Zurich’s museums provide a warm retreat as well as fascinating findings.\n\nWith 50 museums and over 100 art galleries, there’s something for almost every interest. Not only will these provide a warm place on especially cold and stormy days, but they’ll offer a deeper insight into Zurich’s culture and history.\n\nHere are just a handful to add to your Zurich itinerary:\n\nSwiss National Museum Zurich\n\nMuseum Riteberg\n\nFifa Museum\n\nMoney Museum\n\nMuseum of Digital Art\n\nZoological Museum\n\nZurich Tram Museum\n\nBoth the Swiss National Museum and the Zurich Tram Museum are our favorites.\n\nDon’t miss the churches too!\n\n3. Visit the many churches and cathedrals in Zurich\n\nMany people are often unaware of the number of churches and cathedrals Zurich actually has. With a city that dates back to Roman times, you can find some stunning buildings throughout its landscape.\n\nThe two main ones to visit in winter include Grossmünster and Fraumünster Churches.\n\nGrossmünster’s two towers stand proudly overlooking the Limmat River. The church was founded by Charlemagne in the 12th century and is one of Zurich’s most important religious sites.\n\nFraumünster was founded in 853 by King Louis the German and contains a stunning Chagall stained-glass window installed in 1970. Both churches contain multiple works of art, making them interesting places to explore.\n\n4. Feast On Hearty Food\n\nIf there’s one thing Switzerland has no shortage of, it’s good food. Zurich has plenty of cheese and chocolate havens, from fondues to food tours, you’ll never go hungry in this city.\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth and visit one of the chocolatiers for a tasting and some treats to take home. There’s also some tantalizing hot chocolate to be found, which not only tastes amazing but will warm you up too.\n\nIf you’re a cheese fan, Zurich will not disappoint. You can savor many different types of cheese, in a list of different forms. Cheese fondue is the most popular in Zurich and can be found at many cafes and restaurants. You can even learn to make your own cheese.\n\nAnd of course, there are amazing restaurants and cafes found all over the city for you to enjoy breakfast, lunch, and dinner in between the chocolate and cheese delights.\n\n5. Also, visit – Lindt Home of Chocolate\n\nThis recently opened chocolatey heaven is the perfect place for Lindt lovers. There are interactive exhibits, a chocolateria, and its main feature – the 9-meter-tall chocolate fountain. This is also the home of the world’s largest chocolate shop.\n\n✅ You may like this Zurich City Tour that combines a visit to Lindt Chocolate Factory\n\n6. Go On a Walking Tour\n\nIt might be a little frosty outside, but a walking tour is still the best way to see the city. One of the best areas for a tour on foot is the Old Town. Take a guided walk through this neighborhood to learn all about its fascinating history and view the many historical landmarks.\n\nYou’ll also find plenty of themed walking tours throughout the city. Walk through the streets to discover the street art, or marvel at Zurich’s architecture from years gone by.\n\nThere are also food tours, photography walks, and social groups you can join to view the city at a comfortable pace while meeting locals and other travelers. Be sure to bundle up before heading out to enjoy the crisp winter air.\n\n✅ Prefer to stay covered, and not walk? Here is a 2 hour Zurich city sightseeing bus tour\n\n7. Visit the Sukkulenten Sammlung\n\nAnother ideal place to warm up is this indoor botanical garden. It’s a large succulent collection, showing off a range of succulent plants from around the world.\n\nIf you’re missing the sun despite the pretty winter landscape, these cacti are sure to transport your mind to brighter skies and sunnier regions. The collection has free entrance and is sure to be fun for all ages.\n\nFrom the botanical library to the child-friendly experiment stations, you’ll likely find yourself enjoying a full day here, especially if it’s stormy outside.\n\n8. Enjoy a City Ice Rink\n\nIce skating is a winter activity loved by so many, and one that shouldn’t be missed in Zurich. There’s a long list of ice skating rinks, both indoors and open-air ones scattered around the city.\n\nThe most impressive rink, however, would be the Dolder open-air ice rink. It’s one of the largest of its kind in the whole of Europe and sees many locals and visitors each year. You can visit Monday – Sunday (opening hours differ on specific days) and your entrance fee include skate hire.\n\nAnother magical experience would be to find one of the many pop-up ice rinks that are placed in between the Christmas markets.\n\n9. Hit the Slopes\n\nIt’s quite safe to say that anyone interested in skiing has dreamt of enjoying the snowy slopes of Switzerland. There are several ski villages within a short drive from Zurich, some with direct train transfers as well.\n\nIf you’re staying in Zurich for a few days, set at least one aside and head to one of these slopes. Whether you’re just a beginner or a real pro, Zurich skiing will make for a memorable journey.\n\n10. Hike Up Uetliberg\n\nTowering 871 meters above sea level, Uetliberg Mountain is a brilliant winter activity. The short hike to the summit rewards you with breathtaking views of the city and its surrounding beauty. There are restaurants and cafes at the top where you can soak in the scenes with a cup of coffee to warm you up.\n\nIf you’re not feeling up to the hike, you can also take the train to the top. If it’s been snowing, it’s wiser to hike in the morning. Before the sun turns the magic white powder into squishy melted ice. With enough snow, you may even see some of the hiking trails being used for sledding.\n\n11. Marvel at Lake Zurich’s Beauty\n\nAlso known as Zürichsee, this is a spectacular place to spend a day outdoors. On the shores of the lake, you’ll find a promenade and public gardens on the eastern end. This is ideal for those wanting to enjoy winter picnics, long strolls, or simply sit on a bench and look out over the water.\n\nAnother brilliant way to enjoy the lake and the city is a boat trip. You can float along the water and see the many attractions and landmarks in Zurich – all from a new perspective.\n\n12. See a Show at The Zurich Opera House\n\nNot only is this theatre home to some of the most iconic ballets, plays, and operas, but the building itself is quite impressive as well. The theatre also sees children’s shows and renowned singers on its stage, so there’s a show for nearly every taste.\n\nAnd of course, this is winter in Zurich, so why not time your visit to coincide with the Christmas market that is held outside the Opera House each year? Find your preferred show on the Opera House website before you start your trip to the city.\n\n13. Go Shopping\n\nAs the banking and financial capital of Switzerland, Zurich is known for its luxurious, rich culture. This can often mean more expensive costs, but it also means plenty of shopping opportunities.\n\nBahnhofstrasse is the main shopping street in downtown Zurich city. It’s known for its extravagant stores and expensive products but is a great place to experience. Even if you only end up doing a bit of window shopping.\n\n14. Soak in the snow dusted Old Town views from Lindenhof Hill\n\nOne of the loveliest places to take in winter views of Zurich is Lindenhof Hill. This small park is tucked away in the heart of the city and its cobblestone pathways are bound to transport you back in time.\n\nAnd since it’s on top of a hill, its snow-dusted views will not disappoint.\n\nThough the park isn’t particularly large, it has plenty of benches to sit and take in Zurich’s winter magic. It also contains a Roman fort dating back to the 4th century, making it an interesting spot to explore on your trip.\n\n16. Enjoy a stroll along the Limmat River banks\n\nThe Limmat River winds its way through the city and is a great spot for winter strolling. The river banks are lined with outdoor cafes, restaurants, and pubs – perfect for grabbing a bite to eat or having coffee.\n\nYou’ll also find plenty of benches along the promenade where you can take in views of the clear blue waters surrounded by snow.\n\nOn a cold winter day, the best thing to do is bundle up in a warm coat and gloves and take a leisurely walk along the river’s banks. As you make your way through the city, keep an eye out for street art installations as well as hidden gems like boutiques, galleries, and small museums.\n\n17. Explore the Kunsthaus Zurich\n\nThe Kunsthaus Zurich is a modern art museum that showcases some of the world’s most iconic works from masters like Picasso, Cezanne, and Monet.\n\nInside you’ll also find contemporary pieces from Swiss and other European artists, architecture sculptures, and photographs.\n\nOn top of its great art collections, the museum also has a shop, a café and hosts various events throughout the year. It’s well worth visiting on your trip to Zurich and is perfect for those cold winter days when you don’t feel like venturing outside.\n\n18.
