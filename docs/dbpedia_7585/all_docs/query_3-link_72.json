        "text": "Expats can expect a well-balanced and fun lifestyle in Zurich, despite the stereotype that it's a sedate banking capital. The city has great shopping, excellent nightlife and some superb restaurants. Its lakeside location and surrounding countryside provide expats with a number of exciting opportunities for outdoor activities.\n\nShopping in Zurich\n\nZurich’s shopping scene mostly consists of boutiques and speciality stores. Bahnhofstrasse is the main shopping street, and it houses department stores and jewellery shops such as Bucherer and Beyer. The street is known as one of the most elite and expensive shopping areas in the world.\n\nFor a glimpse into the city's sweeter side, expats should visit famed chocolate confectioners such as Confiserie Sprüngli or Teuscher. Well-crafted Swiss hallmarks, like Swiss Army knives, cuckoo clocks, watches and embroidery, can be found at the Schweizer Heimatwerk cooperative.\n\nThe Helvetiaplatz flea market is a worthy Saturday morning excursion, and the Hauptbahnhof station also features ShopVille, which has numerous stores. The Niederdorf district and the narrow streets of the Old Town have eclectic offerings for expats who prefer trendy boutiques and speciality stores. Artwork is sold in Schipfe Street.\n\nNightlife in Zurich\n\nZurich’s nightlife is better than many expats expect. The eclectic Niederdorf area becomes a bustling hangout at night, with many alternative joints. Clubs and bars are clustered in the Zurich-West area, while the area around Paradeplatz has a good selection of upmarket lounges and hotel bars. The former red-light district of Langstrasse retains an edgy appeal and is worth checking out for something different.\n\nOutdoor activities in Zurich\n\nActive expats can hit the slopes for a spot of skiing, enjoy hiking in the Swiss Alps or simply relax watching the day go by while enjoying a coffee by the lake. Some of the best outdoor attractions that Zurich has to offer centre around the city's surrounding natural beauty.\n\nSee and do in Zurich\n\nThere’s plenty to see and do in Zurich, and some of its best sights and activities are free. Expats planning on doing a lot of sightseeing should consider buying a Zurich Card, which gives the bearer free use of local transport, admission to museums, and free drinks at several bars for up to 72 hours.\n\nBelow are some of the most popular attractions in Zurich.\n\nFraumünster Church\n\nThe distinctive blue spire of Fraumünster is one of Zurich’s most emblematic sights. Founded in 853 AD, it stands sentinel over the old Münsterhof square. Look out for the Romanesque choir and its Chagall-designed stained-glass windows.\n\nKunsthaus Zurich\n\nFamed for its Munch, Chagall, Picasso, Monet, Rothko and Expressionist collections, the Kunsthaus holds many treasures within its attractive premises and is the perfect outing for a rainy day.\n\nNiederdorf\n\nThe traditional heart of Zurich is home to intimate cafés, old bars and street performers. Some of the buildings date back to the 15th century and host fashion stores, bookshops, boutique stores and antique dealers.\n\nRhine Falls\n\nTake a day trip to the little town of Schaffhausen, home to the spectacular Rhine Falls – Europe's largest waterfall. This natural spectacle is at its most impressive after the snow melts in late spring. On the hill above it is the medieval Schloss Laufen, and it’s one of the best places to watch the fireworks on Swiss National Day.\n\nSwiss National Museum\n\nThe Swiss National Museum provides an illuminating study of Swiss life over the centuries. The building itself is impressive and, once inside, visitors will find Stone Age tools, medieval treasures and gilded weaponry.\n\nZurich Zoo\n\nThis eco-friendly centre is dedicated to nature conservation and protecting endangered species. The zoo houses hundreds of species and several thousand animals within authentically recreated ecosystems, such as the exotic Madagascan Rainforest and Ethiopian Highlands.\n\nWhat's on in Zurich\n\nThe calendar of events in Zurich is surprisingly diverse, and expats are sure to find a few exciting events to their taste. Visiting international performers and other events are anchored by annual classics. Here are a few of the best annual events in Zurich.\n\nArt on Ice (February/March)\n\nA sell-out ice show which is held at the Hallenstadion Arena brings together the best international skaters to perform spectacular routines accompanied by world-renowned musicians.
