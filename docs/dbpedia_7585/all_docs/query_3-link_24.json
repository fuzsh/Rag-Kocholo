These include excursions on vintage trains or city trams; while taking a river cruise or soaking in a hot tub.\n\nThe Moléson Fondue Train – La Gruyère\n\nThe Moléson Fondue Train is an excursion through the beautiful landscape of the La Gruyère region onboard a nostalgic train. This is a round trip, departing from Bulle towards Montbovon. The complete journey takes around 2 1/2 hours (evening) to 3 hours (midday).\n\nThis trip includes a traditional fondue called moitié-moitié and the regional meringue dessert with double cream which is a much-loved tradition.\n\nThe vintage train has coaches from the 1920s and 1930s. The salon coach “Molejon” is from 1926.\n\nAppenzell Historic Train – Aperitif & Fondue\n\nThe Appenzell fondue experience includes a round trip from Gossau in the Buffet wagon of a beautifully restored Appenzeller historical train (Historische Appenzeller Bahnen).\n\nThis excursion starts with an aperitif of fine Appenzell delicacies during the journey in the buffet car through the Appenzellerland. When arriving in Appenzell, you have the opportunity to experience a factory tour with a tasting at Appenzeller Alpenbitter AG. The cheese fondue with various side dishes is then served in the stationary buffet trolley with a sweet dessert served on the journey back.\n\nExcursion Includes:\n\nRound trip in the buffet car from Gossau to Appenzell\n\nAperitif with various Appenzell specialties\n\nFactory tour and tasting of Appenzeller Alpenbitter AG\n\nCheese fondue with bread and fruit\n\nDessert plate\n\nEvening trips –\n\nGossau to Appenzell with Aperitifs, (40 mins).\n\nStay in Appenzell with tour, tasting and dinner in buffet wagon; then return to Gossau (40 mins).\n\nMidday trips –\n\nwith similar time frames.\n\nFor more information on the area see my page on canton Appenzell:\n\nFondue in a Hotpot surrounded by mountains – Brienz\n\nLakes Brienz and Thun and the surrounding mountains of the Bernese Oberland remind me of my holidays as a child in New Zealand. We would travel down to Queenstown and the long turquoise-coloured Lake Wakatipu with the mountain range called the Remarkables rising up in the background. When I travel to the Bernese Oberland, I always feel like I’m in familiar territory with its stunning mountains and turquoise lakes.\n\nOne other similarity is the adventure sports and holiday vibe that both places have. In Queenstown you can paraglide, go jetboating, bungy jumping and ski. The Bernese Oberland offers the same kind of adventurous leisure activities – with loads more skiing.\n\nOf course, there are a lot of differences – the mountains are immense in Switzerland and go on forever and the chalets here are obviously a lot older – they are the original designs that New Zealand’s holiday resorts have copied. In Switzerland, they are dotted all over the landscape – whereas New Zealand has large swathes of rugged mountains with not a house in sight.\n\nThis jacuzzi fondue idea is not an adventurous activity, instead, it is unique and relaxing. I am sure Queenstown will also have a small restaurant with fondue hot tubs added to their lakeside resort at some point.\n\nHot Pot Brienz\n\nis a winter activity that lasts from the end of November until February. During this time the cosy chalet fondue restaurant along with several wooden hot tubs are set up on their own little corner of the lakeside. Each hot tub is covered and has a large table in the centre, ready for the fondue and/or drinks – it really looks like fun!\n\nWhat is Available\n\nThey offer 2, 4, 6 or 8 person hot tubs with the possibility of enjoying fondue and drinks before, during or after soaking in the tubs – in other words, using the restaurant to eat and the tub to soak or combine the two.\n\nFor more information on the area see my page on canton Bern:\n\nBasel – Rhein Culinary Cruise\n\nWinter Cruises\n\nCulinary Cruises with Fondue\n\nThe special Winterschiff (Winter Ship), with a large indoor space, offers a special winter menu that includes brunch and dinner using local produce.
