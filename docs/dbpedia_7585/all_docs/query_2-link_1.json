The lowest chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 55% on February 29.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is February 29, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 45% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on November 23, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 62%, while on July 23, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In ZÃ¼rich, the chance of a wet day over the course of February is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 31% and ending it at 27%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 48% on June 11, and its lowest chance is 27% on February 29.\n\nOver the course of February in ZÃ¼rich, the chance of a day with only rain remains an essentially constant 23% throughout, the chance of a day with mixed snow and rain remains an essentially constant 4% throughout, and the chance of a day with only snow remains an essentially constant 2% throughout.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during February in ZÃ¼rich is essentially constant, remaining about 2.1 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 4.4 inches or falling below 0.5 inches.\n\nThe lowest average 31-day accumulation is 2.1 inches on February 20.\n\nSnowfall\n\nAs with rainfall, we consider the snowfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day snowfall during February in ZÃ¼rich is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 1.9 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.8 inches or falls below -0.0 inches, and ending the month at 1.6 inches, when it rarely exceeds 3.9 inches or falls below -0.0 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of February in ZÃ¼rich, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 28 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 10 seconds, and weekly increase of 22 minutes, 7 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is February 1, with 9 hours, 34 minutes of daylight and the longest day is February 29, with 11 hours, 3 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in ZÃ¼rich is 7:52 AM on February 1 and the earliest sunrise is 45 minutes earlier at 7:07 AM on February 29.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 5:26 PM on February 1 and the latest sunset is 43 minutes later at 6:09 PM on February 29.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in ZÃ¼rich during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during February, so the entire month is in daylight saving time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:28 AM and sets 15 hours, 57 minutes later, at 9:26 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:10 AM and sets 8 hours, 28 minutes later, at 4:37 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in February in ZÃ¼rich\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in February in ZÃ¼richFeb1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292912 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJanMar0010102030001010202040\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for February 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in February in ZÃ¼rich\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in February in ZÃ¼richFeb1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292912 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMJanMarJan 1112:58 PMJan 1112:58 PMJan 256:55 PMJan 256:55 PMFeb 1012:00 AMFeb 1012:00 AMFeb 241:31 PMFeb 241:31 PMMar 1010:01 AMMar 1010:01 AMMar 258:01 AMMar 258:01 AM8:41 AM8:41 AM4:35 PM4:35 PM4:43 PM4:43 PM8:51 AM8:51 AM7:52 AM7:52 AM4:54 PM4:54 PM5:59 PM5:59 PM7:52 AM7:52 AM7:03 AM7:03 AM6:43 PM6:43 PM6:01 PM6:01 PM6:27 AM6:27 AM\n\nFeb 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 67%-10:26 AMWSW-4:57 AMS249,592 mi 2 58%12:33 AMESE10:43 AMWSW-5:38 AMS247,295 mi 3 50%1:43 AMESE11:03 AMWSW-6:24 AMS244,295 mi 4 37%2:57 AMSE11:30 AMSW-7:14 AMS240,710 mi 5 27%4:12 AMSE12:07 PMSW-8:09 AMS236,741 mi 6 17%5:23 AMSE12:57 PMSW-9:10 AMS232,675 mi 7 9%6:26 AMSE2:04 PMSW-10:15 AMS228,869 mi 8 3%7:15 AMSE3:26 PMSW-11:20 AMS225,707 mi 9 0%7:52 AMESE4:54 PMWSW-12:23 PMS223,526 mi 10 0%8:20 AMESE6:24 PMWSW-1:21 PMS222,549 mi 11 4%8:42 AMESE7:51 PMW-2:15 PMS222,846 mi 12 10%9:01 AME9:16 PMW-3:06 PMS224,326 mi 13 19%9:19 AME10:39 PMWNW-3:55 PMS226,772 mi 14 29%9:38 AMENE--4:44 PMS229,888 mi 15 40%-12:00 AMWNW9:58 AMENE5:33 PMS233,355 mi 16 50%-1:21 AMWNW10:23 AMENE6:25 PMS236,887 mi 17 62%-2:40 AMNW10:54 AMNE7:18 PMS240,251 mi 18 72%-3:52 AMNW11:34 AMNE8:13 PMS243,288 mi 19 81%-4:56 AMNW12:25 PMNE9:07 PMS245,906 mi 20 88%-5:47 AMNW1:25 PMNE10:00 PMS248,068 mi 21 94%-6:26 AMNW2:32 PMNE10:49 PMS249,779 mi 22 98%-6:55 AMNW3:42 PMENE11:36 PMS251,058 mi 23 99%-7:18 AMWNW4:51 PMENE-- 24 100%-7:36 AMWNW5:59 PMENE12:19 AMS251,926 mi 25 100%-7:52 AMWNW7:05 PME12:59 AMS252,390 mi 26 98%-8:05 AMW8:10 PME1:38 AMS252,436 mi 27 94%-8:19 AMW9:16 PME2:17 AMS252,027 mi 28 89%-8:33 AMWSW10:22 PMESE2:56 AMS251,115 mi 29 82%-8:48 AMWSW11:31 PMESE3:36 AMS249,645 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in ZÃ¼rich is essentially constant during February, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 7, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 2% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in February in ZÃ¼rich\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in ZÃ¼rich is essentially constant during February, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 6.7 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on February 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.9 miles per hour, while on August 9, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.0 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during February is 6.9 miles per hour on February 6.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in ZÃ¼rich throughout February is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 40% on February 17.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in ZÃ¼rich typically lasts for 6.5 months (199 days), from around April 15 to around October 31, rarely starting before March 26 or after May 4, and rarely ending before October 12 or after November 23.\n\nThe month of February in ZÃ¼rich is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in February in ZÃ¼rich\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in ZÃ¼rich are essentially constant during February, remaining within 2Â°F of 4Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in ZÃ¼rich is increasing during February, rising by 1.1 kWh, from 1.8 kWh to 2.9 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in February in ZÃ¼rich\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in February in ZÃ¼richFeb112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829290.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWh5.5 kWh5.5 kWh6.0 kWh6.0 kWhJanMarFeb 11.8 kWhFeb 11.8 kWhFeb 292.9 kWhFeb 292.9 kWhFeb 112.2 kWhFeb 112.2 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of ZÃ¼rich are 47.367 deg latitude, 8.550 deg longitude, and 1,407 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of ZÃ¼rich contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,010 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,552 feet. Within 10 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,781 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (11,056 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of ZÃ¼rich is covered by artificial surfaces (68%), water (15%), and trees (15%), within 10 miles by cropland (38%) and artificial surfaces (31%), and within 50 miles by trees (35%) and cropland (27%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in ZÃ¼rich, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in ZÃ¼rich.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and ZÃ¼rich according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at ZÃ¼rich is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between ZÃ¼rich and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDÃ¼bendorf Air Base (LSMD, 56%, 5 mi, northeast, 62 ft elevation change)\n\nZurich Airport (LSZH, 38%, 7 mi, north, 7 ft elevation change)\n\nEmmen Air Base (LSME, 6%, 22 mi, southwest, -10 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of ZÃ¼rich and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
