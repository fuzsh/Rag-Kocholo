I thought there was no place for scrappy tourists like us but I was so wrong. There is plenty to see and do in Zürich. If you have 2 days in Zürich then this is a great itinerary. (Oh, and if you only have one day in Zürich then just follow day one)!\n\nThis post may contain sponsored content or affiliate links that help support the blog. All opinions are our own.\n\nFlying Fluskey in Zürich\n\nOn our journey from London to the Maldives we had an eight hour stopover in Switzerland. At first, I anticipated a long day in a cold airport but with a little more research, we saw how quick and easy it would be to get to the city (one quick train). We spend a very happy five hours exploring Zürich and vowed to return. Six years on and we returned to explore further.\n\nThe Zürich Card\n\nThe Zürich Card provides free public transport for the length of the card, whether that be 24, or 72 hours. It also includes free entry to lots of museums around town as well as discounts at many others. You will also be entitled to a free mini cruise on the lake and some other exciting offers which we will mention along the way. It is best to order your Zürich Card in advance so you can use public transport straight away. It includes trains to and from the airport and it is around £10 each way so this makes the card great value! Remember to validate your Zürich Card when you want to start using them, you will have 23 or 72 hours of use. You can validate these in the machines at the Zürich HB if you are picking them up from the tourist office.\n\nFor a great day trip from Zürich, check out our tour to the Rhine Falls\n\nDAY ONE\n\nTake a Walking Tour\n\nIt’s always a great idea to discover a new city with a walking tour, especially if you only have 2 days in Zürich. You will take in some of the best outdoor sights in good time, without getting lost and learning a bit of history along the way.\n\nThe Official Tour – Zürich Old Town Walking Tour\n\nThe Old town walking tour begins at the Zürich HB, outside the tourist office. From here, you will head down to the old town, along the Limmat River through some of the prettiest streets in the city. Along the way, the professional guides will share tons of info and some fun stories. As a bonus, you get to try some syrup which is a concentrated fruit drink mixed with Zurich fountain water which all feels rather wholesome.\n\nTours are 50% off with the Zürich Card\n\nFree Walking Tours\n\nFor a slightly less formal, walking tour, search for freebies like Free WalkingTour Switzerland. Of course, these guides work for tips and so you should definitely bring along some cash before the end of the tour so technically it’s not free but they tend to be a little quirky with guides focusing on the areas that they find most interesting and are most passionate about.\n\nAlternatively, if you enjoy doing your own thing, the tourist office has free walking tour sheets with a route to follow that will guide you through most of the big sights between Zürich HB and the lake. This is what we did on our first stopover visit and it was a great way to see the city at our own pace. (It was great to rediscover it with some more info on our proper tour though).\n\nDuck Into These Churches\n\nYou can’t spend 2 Days in Zürich without popping into a church or two. The city has many, but here are 2 of our favourites;\n\nGrossmunster\n\nThe two main towers of Grossmunster are recognisable from across the city, so it is one of the city’s icons. Built in 1220, the present building was built upon the foundations of an even older church. It used to be a monastery and was founded by Charlemagne. Legend has it, the horse of Charlemagne fell to its knees at the spot the saints of the church were buried.\n\nThe Zürich Card gives visitors access to the right-hand tower so head to the Ticket Desk. They will let you through. The stairs are quite steep, but there are a couple of spots for a breather as you climb one of which has some interesting street art from a famous graffiti artist. at the top, if the weather is bad, you won’t be able to go right out onto the balcony, but the views are still good enough if you are tall enough. On nicer days, you can head right out to the stone balustrade and take in the sweeping views of the lakes and the surrounding city.\n\nGrossmunster is free with the Zürich Card.\n\nFraumunster\n\nAcross the river, is Fraumunster. This was established by Charlemagne’s grandson and was a convent (a fierce rival of Grossmunster across the bridge). The stained glass behind the altar is beautiful, and they know it. In the welcome leaflet, it states that reproducing, photographing or posting pictures of the stained glass on social media is all copyright infringement. The windows were created in the 1970s by artist Marc Chagall and they are seriously stunning. I might not be allowed to post them but here is a link to the google photos results so you can see them…but also, go and see them in real life!\n\nFraumunster is free with the Zürich Card.\n\nRelax on Lake Zürich\n\nYour Zürich Card entitles you to a free mini cruise of Lake Zürich and this is a great way to rest and recuperate whilst taking in some pretty scenery. The mini cruise takes around an hour and is a must do if you have 2 days in Zürich. The boat has indoor and outdoor seating so you can enjoy it whatever the weather. The boat leaves every hour from 09:45 – 16:45. There are some seats at the front of the boat where you get the best view and some at the back, which is another nice spot to relax if the weather is nice. Alternatively, there are plenty of seats inside on cushioned benches with tables, making this a nice spot for a picnic or to huddle from the cold. The boat travels about halfway along the lake, past the suburbs of Zürich and the green hills beyond before returning.\n\nThe mini cruise is free with the Zürich Card.\n\nGet Cheesy at Swiss Chuchi\n\nThere are a fair few spots offering fondue in Switzerland but our favourite is Swiss Chuchi. The atmosphere is cosy and jovial while outside is lovely in the summer sun. There is plenty on the menu to satisfy but it’s all about the cheese!\n\nRaclette\n\nThere are two kinds of raclette, the kind that is melted and scraped off a huge cheese wheel and the kind you’ll find here. Diners are given a little platter of veggies, potatoes and other bits and a plate full of cheese.\n\nThe idea is to load up your mini skillet and melt the cheese onto your chosen receptacle before scoffing the lot. It’s fun…but not as fun as fondue! Maybe we should call it FUNdue?\n\nFondue\n\nSwiss Chuchi has a whole page of its menu dedicated to this boozy, cheesy pot of deliciousness. We favour their unique fondue (Fondue Adler mit gereifteren Käsesorten) with lashings of wine and cherry liquor as you can try the regular stuff elsewhere. Every fondue comes with bread as standard for dipping but you can also order pickled veggies (cornichons, pickled onions and corn), potatoes or meat to dip on as well. Dip, dig in and don’t give up until it’s all gone!\n\nIf you still have room, they have a yummy selection of desserts including seasonal offerings like this meringue, strawberry and deliciously thick Swiss cream concoction, (it is an Eton neat).\n\nYou will receive a culinary surprise at Swiss Chuchi if you show your Zürich Card.\n\nDAY TWO\n\nPlay Charlie at Lindt Home of Chocolate\n\nIf you have always dreamt of getting one of Willy Wonka’s golden tickets then you are going to love the Lindt museum. It’s an essential taste tour if you have 2 Days in Zürich. Now, unlike a few chocolate tastings you may have been to, the first few rooms are fun, informative and very interactive. Everyone has an audio guide but there’s also plenty to read and play with. Even if you don’t have a ticket, you can visit the shop and lobby and see the huge chocolate whisk fountain that has actual chocolate cascading down the central column….but it is a long way to visit a chocolate shop and the museum really is great.\n\nThen, once you have a head full of knowledge about the joys and history of chocolate it’s time to taste some and again, this is next level.\n\nEating Lindt\n\nThe Fountains – if the idea of chocolate fountains fills you with equal parts joy of chocolate and horror of germs then you’ll love the Lindt fountains. Instead of sticky hands under the chocolate falls, guests pump squirts of the melted confection into small spoons. There are three types, dark, milk, and white. If you’re feeling fancy, you could try and get all three on one spoon. Don’t fill up entirely though, as very quickly you’ll be at tasting station number 2.\n\nThe Flavour Test – Here will find a cluster of machines all chopping chocolate. The idea is to put your hand out and catch a chunk. These are all dark chocolate blended with different flavours. Guess the addition and there’s a little flap with the answer so you can check how good your palate is.\n\nLindor Heaven – The first thing you see when you enter Lindor Heaven are two giant versions of the iconic truffle. These are photo booths and if you’re on a tasting mission then you can skip these. Instead, join the queue to pass the see-through capsules full of every flavour of Lindor ball that they produce. You take one of each (unless staff aren’t paying attention, when you could grab more…but we didn’t tell you that).\n\nThe Lindt Home of Chocolate Museum is 10% off with the Zürich Card.\n\nCulture Time at Zürich’s Museums\n\nZürich has plenty of museums to include in your 2 Days in Zürich. Some are free with the Zürich card and some you will receive a discount. Here are some of our favourites:\n\nBeyer Clock and Watch Museum\n\nAt first glance, this tiny museum seems like five minutes’ work, but you can easily lose an hour here (and they’ll be plenty of clocks to tell you so). There is a large collection of timepieces, some beautiful, some you recognise from your grandparent’s mantelpiece, and some that are downright weird. A particular feature is the section for clocks with unusual mechanisms. No matter how many times you see the movie o’clock ago, he will still be drawn to it every time you hear it roll.\n\nThe Clock Museum is free with the Zürich Card.\n\nFIFA Museum\n\nThe FIFA World Football Museum is all about the beautiful game. There are cool exhibits here that go back to the very first world cup in 1930. Even if you don’t love football, the interactive elements are a lot of fun. You can test out your football skills; don’t worry if you are rubbish, that is often a lot more fun!\n\nThe FIFA Museum is 30% cheaper with the Zürich Card.\n\nLandesmuseum – National Museum of Swizerland\n\nThe Landesmuseum is stuffed full of Swiss culture. It includes archaeological artefacts (displayed with amazing interactive screens full of interesting information) and interiors from across the ages. There is so much to see. Pass through stunning wooden rooms and beautiful ballrooms, and marvel at the ancient art. There is a wonderful exhibition that traces Switzerland’s history and it is packed with incredible pieces. This includes the Guild map (in the photo below), right up to the modern age. Even the museum building itself is attractive, designed with French city chateaus in mind in the 1890s.\n\nThe Landesmuseum is free with the Zürich Card.\n\nMoney Museum\n\nZürich is known as a banking hub (and all those mysterious Swiss bank accounts) so it is only right that there is a museum all about money here. The museum traces the history of currency and its role in society. It showcases a huge range of banknotes and coins from around the world, with some rather good-looking gold bars.\n\nThe Money Museum is free to enter, which is super but it is only open on Thursday and Friday.\n\nKunsthaus\n\nThe Zürich Kunsthaus is Switzerland’s biggest art museum and is spread across a few buildings in the city. Here where you will find fine and modern art from Switzerland and across Europe, some dating back to the 1200s. A particular highlight is the new David Chipperfield extension where you will find gorgeous pieces from Picasso and Monet.\n\nYou will receive 20% off with the Zürich Card. The main collections are free on Wednesday so if your 2 days fall midweek then you are onto a winner!\n\nDinner – Too Good to Go\n\nIf your budget is stretched by 2 Days in Zürich, then make sure you have downloaded the Too Good to Go app. This super money saver means you get end of the day food from restaurants, canteens and supermarkets for a steal. We had full bakery bags for less than 6 CHF, hot food from a Migros canteen for 6.50 CHF and random grocery items from Coop for 6 CHF. Its a bargain and a gamble! But, when a pizza can be 25CHF and a Big Mac meal with McFlurry is 17CHF, it’s worth the risk.\n\nFinal Thoughts for Your 2 Days in Zürich\n\nThere is something about Zürich that is surprising and delightful in a way that you wouldn’t expect. The old town has some serious charm and there is something about being surrounded by wealth that is eternally interesting. You could be walking any backstreet in Zürich and the four cars that drive past, will all be rather lovely. We have been in the sunshine and in the rain and enjoyed both trips greatly. If you are travelling to Switzerland, make sure that spending 2 days in Zürich is part of your itinerary.\n\nRosie xx"
