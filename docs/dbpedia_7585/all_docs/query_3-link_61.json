It’s a popular destination for couples and adventurers, and also an excellent country to explore with the entire family. Switzerland with kids can be great fun both in summer and in winter. There are many enjoyable things to do in Switzerland with kids from outdoor fun to city activities.\n\nFrom hiking in Interlaken to wild swimming in Zurich and indulging in chocolate, here are the best family-friendly things to do in Switzerland.\n\nDisclaimer: This helpful post contains some affiliate links. This means that if you click on any of the links in this post (AND make a purchase) I may receive a small commission at absolutely no cost to you. As such I thank you in advance should you decide to click & buy.\n\nThings to do in Switzerland with kids: City Activities\n\nYou really can never go wrong with a trip to Switzerland. Despite its relatively small size as a country, experiences here are very diverse and always memorable. Family trips can sometimes be stressful, but there will always be something in Switzerland that will make every member of the family happy.\n\nIf you plan on travelling extensively around Switzerland and visiting multiple cities, then consider the Swiss Travel Pass. It can save you a lot of money and give you a more flexible travel experience, especially if you are travelling as a family with small children, as children under 6 travel for free. The Swiss Travel Pass allows you to travel on most forms of public transportation throughout Switzerland with added benefits, such as free entry into over 500 museums.\n\nSwitzerland is renowned for its breathtaking landscapes and family-friendly attractions, making it the perfect destination for a memorable vacation with children. From exploring the picturesque Swiss Alps to indulging in delicious Swiss chocolate, there are countless activities to enjoy in Switzerland with a toddler. Here are a few things things to do in Switzerland with kids in and around cities.\n\n1. Explore Jungfraujoch\n\nA quintessentially Swiss experience, the Jungfraujoch shows the best that the country has to offer. It’s fairly accessible from any city in Switzerland. The train ride itself is a must-do experience on its own and one of the top family fun activities in Switzerland with kids. From Lauterbrunnen, the train does a quick stop at Klein Scheidegg for amazing views just below the Eiger mountain.\n\nFrom here, a cog train brings passengers to a height of 3,454 meters, the highest station in all of Europe, earning Jungfraujoch its nickname “Top of Europe”.\n\nObviously, the views at Jungfraujoch are spectacular. There are several lookout points for visitors to see a panoramic view of the Jungfrau, Eiger, and Monch peaks all in one sweep. Visitors can also spend time at several exhibits, including the Ice Palace, with walls of ice carved into works of art, and the Alpine Sensation, a memorial for all the workers that opened up the Jungfraujoch railway. There are shops and restaurants to sit in, and many walking trails to explore.\n\nEvery member of the family, from kids to grandparents, will have a grand time at Jungfraujoch. And Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland is worth spending more time in.\n\nYou can travel independently, just book the train tickets online.\n\nOr you can book a private tour from Zurich and enjoy a guided tour around ‘Top of Europe’.\n\n2. Indulge in Chocolate\n\nSwitzerland is known for many things, and especially its chocolate. Some of the world’s best chocolate makers come from this country. Bringing home chocolate is already a given, but there are more ways to enjoy this heavenly confectionery.\n\nAt the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne is the Swiss Chocolate Adventure, a multimedia attraction in partnership with the Lindt Chocolate Competence Foundation. It shows the journey of a humble cocoa bean to one of the best chocolates in the world. Families can also hop aboard The Chocolate Train that runs between Montreux and the Cailler-Nestlé chocolate factory at Broc. Chocolates and croissants are served onboard, followed by a trip to Maison Cailler to discover the process of making Swiss chocolates. I recommend this if you are visitinig Switzerland with kids.\n\nSeveral chocolate factories also open up tours for visitors. Take a look around Läderach Chocolate Adventures, Alprose chocolate’s Schokoland in Caslano, and, of course, Maison Cailler in Broc.\n\nSee some of the chocolate indulging tours in Switzerland:\n\n3. City-Nature Tour in Lucerne\n\nLucerne is a beautiful city that has perfected the right mix of city, history, and nature. Seated at the heart of the Alps, mountain peaks tower everywhere, giving many opportunities for outdoor excursions.\n\nFor a more relaxed trip, a leisurely walk around Lucerne’s Old Town is a full day’s worth of historical immersion that reveals how this German-speaking city’s culture was formed.\n\nThe Chapel Bridge in Lucerne, one of Switzerland’s most iconic landmarks, is also the country’s most impressive historic bridge. The inside panels have been turned into a gallery, displaying 17th-century paintings.\n\nOf course, there’s Lake Lucerne that provides an endless list of activities. Families can take ferry tours across the lake, ride a bike or stroll along the shore, or sit at one of the many parks surrounding the lake. In the summer, swimming and water activities are also great ways to spend the day with the kids.\n\nBook your 1-hour panoramic cruise in Lucerne.\n\n4. Animal Encounters\n\nWhat kid doesn’t like animals? There are around 25 zoos all over Switzerland, and there’s one bound to be near where you’re staying. One of the things to do in Switzerland with kids.\n\nThe largest zoo can be found in Zurich, with Zoo Zurich housing over 360 animal species. Both local and foreign species make up the impressive roster of Zoo Zurich, including tigers, snow leopards, gorillas, and penguins. Within the zoo are various exhibits, too. There’s the Masoala Rainforest where visitors follow walkways on treetops, and the Kaeng Krachan Elephant Park to see these majestic beasts roaming freely around their habitat.\n\n5. Museum-Hopping\n\nSome of Switzerland’s most famous museums might not be too interesting for kids, but there are many interactive museums and experiences designed especially for kids and kids-at-heart.\n\nWith the many types of exhibits to choose from, dinosaur museums are some of the popular ones to visit. The Aathal Dinosaur Museum, found in Aathal near Zurich, has one of the largest collections of dinosaur fossils in Switzerland. They also have life-sized dinosaur models and a gift shop with educational books and toys. The Jurassica Museum in Porrentruy is situated in a beautiful structure built within lush gardens. Its exhibits also feature different creatures and species during the Jurassic era.\n\nAnother family hit is Science museums, which Switzerland has absolutely no lack of. CERN in Geneva is a must-visit for future scientists as the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. Winterthur has the Swiss Science Center Technorama, combining physics, chemistry, and biology to create a highly interactive and engaging experience.\n\nFor the ultimate Swiss museum experience, head to the Swiss Open-Air Museum in Ballenberg. This museum displays traditional buildings and architecture from all over the country. It’s a great way to see all of Switzerland’s iconic chalets in one go.\n\n6. Historical Trip to Bern\n\nIf you’re visiting Switzerland, you might as well visit the capital. Bern is a relatively small city with a lot of character. Unlike many capital cities in the world, Bern boasts of calm energy hanging over well-preserved medieval buildings.\n\nThe city is very endearing, making it a fascinating place for families to visit and be transported back in time.\n\nBern’s Old Town is unique as it’s flanked on both sides by the River Aare. It’s a very small-town feel that only amplifies the magnificence of its beautiful medieval structures and arcades. There are also several water fountains around the city where kids love to play.\n\nBern has several parks for families to stroll around in and have a picnic as well. The Rose Garden is beautiful with over 200 kinds of roses. The city also has a bear park, in honor of its symbol, where live bears roam around.\n\nThings to do in Switzerland with kids: Outdoor Fun\n\nIn Switzerland with a 4-year-old kid, families can embark on a memorable adventure filled with breathtaking mountain views, enchanting Swiss villages, and thrilling outdoor activities.\n\n7. Hit the slopes\n\nSwitzerland has numerous family-friendly ski regions, offering something for adults and kids of all ages. While the grown-ups relax and unwind, the little ones can hit the slopes. In addition, Switzerland offers plenty of luxury ski chalets for families, ideal for those wanting a skiing break.\n\nWith over 300 ski resorts and vast kilometres of slopes, Switzerland is a haven for winter sports. Aside from the traditional ski runs, the Swiss Alps has plenty of cross-country ski trails and sledging runs.\n\nSkiing is a popular activity in Switzerland, but having the famous Matterhorn in the background makes the experience all the more special. Zermatt is a small town in the Swiss Alps at the base of the Matterhorn. The city itself is beautiful, but most travelers take a trip up to the Matterhorn for a lot of fun in the snow. It’s popular for skiers and snowboarders, but also a great place for kids and beginners.\n\nWhile there are many experienced skiers here, the atmosphere is not competitive or intense, making it a great place for families to simply have fun in the snow. Skiing in Zermatt is perfect for families, offering an incredible blend of modern ski lifts, charming Alpine villages, and various ski trails to introduce kids and beginners to skiing.\n\nGrindelwald is another famous destination for a family-friendly ski holiday in Switzerland. The picturesque glacier village is surrounded by snow-capped peaks, offering an incredible skiing experience. Grindelwald is also home to family-friendly attractions like the First Flyer zip-line, which adventurous teens will love to try.\n\nGrindelwald attractions are fun in summer months as well. See these fun activities at Grindelwald:\n\n8. Go Hiking\n\nSwitzerland makes hiking easy for families, including those with little kids. You can hike up the mountain for breathtaking views or venture into picturesque lakeside villages. The country offers many theme trails, offering fun activities to delight and motivate kids to keep walking. Many are marked, which makes planning your hiking adventure so easy.\n\nIf you’ve got older kids with hiking experience, conquer the Oeschinensee Panoramic Trail, about 40 minutes from Interlaken. It’s a scenic trail with a panorama loop circling the stunning Lake Oeschinen along the Berner Oberland. You can take a shuttle or cable car to get to the trailhead. With some effort, older kids who love nature will be delighted by the stunning views. Take a break at a lake for a refreshing dip, especially during warm summer days. Pack some snacks and drinks, and have a picnic by the lake.\n\nWhile you’ll find incredibly scenic hiking paths around Switzerland, Interlaken offers some of the best spots for hiking. Many of these trails are easy and are perfect for most families. For instance, the Rugen trail is a 40-minute hike to the top, suitable for all hiker levels. Take your time and stop often to enjoy the views, including a 360-degree view of Interlaken.\n\n9. Join Summer Camps\n\nSummer camp offers kids many growth opportunities while learning some essential life skills. You will find fantastic places to camp around Europe, with many great options in Switzerland. In fact, Switzerland is a renowned summer camp destination, home to some of the world’s best camps featuring high-quality facilities and well-trained staff.\n\nOne of the reasons your children will enjoy an alpine summer camp in Switzerland is because many of these camps are located in iconic locations with spectacular views. If your kids are nature lovers, they will appreciate spending time at a summer camp in Switzerland. They will sleep surrounded by majestic mountains and lakes and spend the day enjoying outdoor activities, such as hiking. It’s a fantastic opportunity to explore Switzerland’s breathtaking natural beauty.\n\nSwitzerland is famous for its excellent educational standards. You can expect the same in Swiss summer camps. They provide academic and enrichment activities to help kids develop new skills.\n\n10. Wild Swimming in the Lakes\n\nSwitzerland has numerous rivers and lakes, perfect for wild swimming. Many lakes are worth a day trip, with amenities for a safer and more enjoyable adventure. Aside from changing rooms and a lifeguard, many have play areas, perfect for your little ones.\n\nLake Zurich is a safe spot for wild swimming, attracting local families to its tranquil shores. Whether cooling down on a hot day or looking to get away from the crowds and spend some time in nature, swimming in Lake Zurich offers a fun adventure for the family. As one of Switzerland’s largest lakes, Lake Zurich attracts hundreds of visitors to its shores. Its lakeshore has many beaches and bathing spots for wild swimming, though it can get crowded during the peak of summer. The water is clean and safe for everyone.\n\nHead to Strandbad Mythenquai, one of the best beaches along the lake. The beautiful sandy beach is in the western section of the town and has a vast grassy area offering plenty of spots for sunbathing. Aside from swimming, your kids will have a great time jumping from the diving boards and platforms towards the clear waters.\n\nStrandbad Mythenquai is ideal for families with little kids. Its gradual entrance into the lake makes it safe for smaller kids since there are plenty of areas where the water is shallow enough for your kids to swim and paddle.\n\n11. Try Ice Skating\n\nAnother enjoyable pastime for families travelling to Switzerland is ice skating. Ice skating is one of the many wintertime pastimes popular among locals in the Swiss Alps. Many outdoor natural ice rinks around Switzerland offer incredible ice-skating experiences, especially in the Swiss Alps. Others are even attached to Christmas markets, offering a more enjoyable experience!\n\nAs Switzerland’s most populous city, Zurich is the hub of ice-skating rinks in the country. It’s home to some of the best outdoor and indoor ice rinks in Switzerland, with plenty of places suitable for families. At 6,000 square metres, Dolder eisbahn is one of Europe’s largest ice rinks. Sitting next to the Dolder Grand Hotel, the iconic place is a local favourite and dates back to the 1930s.\n\nSwitzerland is a relatively small country, so it’s easy to hit several spots in one trip. Traveling with kids can be stressful at times, but the fresh Swiss air and awe-inspiring views are enough to keep even the most restless toddler wonderfully distracted. At the same time, families traveling with older kids have endless parks and attractions to explore without too much of a physical strain.\n\nFamilies visiting Switzerland can enjoy a wide variety of activities and attractions. From exploring the beautiful Swiss Alps to visiting interactive museums, there are plenty of things to do in Switzerland with kids.\n\nNot to mention, Switzerland is probably one of the safest cities in the world. Switzerland also makes for a fairytale winter holiday amongst all Europe winter destinations.\n\nPin it for later!\n\nThis is a guest post by Mike Jensen.
