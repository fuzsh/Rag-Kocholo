        "text": "By Emma Marshall (updated January 2023)\n\nAs the largest city in Switzerland, Zurich offers visitors a generous sprinkling of attractions: a chocolate box old town to wander around, a crystal-clear river that runs through the historic centre and a glacial lake surrounded by mountain peaks.\n\nBut if you’re thinking it’s mainly a summer destination, then you will be pleasantly surprised. It is true that Zurich is a fabulous place to visit at that time of the year, but there is equally a plethora of activities geared towards the colder, winter months.\n\nIt really is a perfect city to visit all year round.\n\nThis guide outlines the top things to do in Zurich in winter. And in it I answer all your questions!\n\nThis article contains affiliate links.\n\nWhere is Zurich?\n\nZurich is Switzerland’s main commercial hub, located in the canton of Zurich in the north of the country. It is just over 120 km from the capital, Bern, around 75 km from Basel and around 275 km from Geneva.\n\nZurich is also well located for anyone who is interested in hopping over the border to visit some of Switzerland’s neighbouring countries. It is only 24 km from the German border, and around 80 km from Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein.\n\nTop facts about Zurich\n\nZurich is the largest Swiss city, by population, with over 400,000 inhabitants.\n\nAlthough Zurich is the capital of the canton of Zurich and is Switzerland’s largest city, it’s not the capital of Switzerland. The capital is the smaller Bern, located towards the central part of the country.\n\nAlthough there are four official languages in Switzerland, German is the official language for Zurich.\n\nIt’s a multi-cultural city. According to Stadt Zurich, at the end of 2018, the people living in Zurich came from over 170 different countries. This means that around a third of people living in Zurich are not Swiss nationals.\n\nThe city has the largest church clock face in Europe, measuring 8.7 metres in diameter.\n\nIn August, around 4,500 people swim the length of the city’s river, the Limmat.\n\nAt Christmas, Zurich has a tree that is adorned with 7,000 Swarovski crystals.\n\nZurich is less than an hour away from Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Rhine (Rhein) Falls. If you visit in winter, its flow is around 250,000 litres a second.\n\nIt’s not cheap to live here! A Forbes survey in 2020 rated Zurich as the second most expensive city in the world to live in, reflecting Switzerland’s overall position on this list (the country’s four main cities were listed in the survey’s top five places).\n\nWhy visit Zurich in winter?\n\nZurich is a perfect city to visit all year round; there is no shortage of things to see and do.\n\nSome activities obviously won’t be major draws in the winter season (swimming in the lake being one of them!). But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have other attractions to entice visitors in the colder months.\n\nWith its charming old town lit up on the dark, wintry nights, its wonderful cosy cafes and restaurants, relaxing spas and first-class museums to visit, there’s an excellent choice of things to keep you busy.\n\nIts location near the mountains also means it is a perfect base for those of you who wish to partake in some winter activities or sports.\n\nAnd if you’re there in the run up to the festive season, and are thinking of the things to do in Zurich in December, there are some magical Christmas markets that you can visit.\n\nShould I visit Zurich or Geneva?\n\nFor me, this isn’t really an either/or question: both cities are fascinating and definitely worth exploring.\n\nThey each have fascinating old towns to explore, amazing food, top notch museums and glacial lakes that you can walk beside for a pleasurable stroll.\n\nThey are notably different, however.\n\nBeing in the French part of Switzerland, Geneva, has more of a leaning to French food, whilst Zurich is more Germanic (both cities incidentally have a superb selection of international cuisines to satisfy those tourists looking for a wider choice).\n\nGeneva is also home to some notable landmarks that you should visit. For example, there’s the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum and the Palais des Nations, the site of the UN.\n\nYou can also see the Jet d’Eau, a 140 metre plume of water that periodically spurts up into the air.\n\nIf you only have time to visit one of them, your decision may be influenced by other towns or cities that are close by and that you fancy adding to your trip. For instance, Geneva is very close to the French border and so it would also be possible to combine your trip with a short visit to Annecy and/or Lyon.\n\nZurich, on the other hand, is closer to Germany and Liechtenstein, and so, for example, if you fancy exploring the world’s 6th smallest country, then Zurich is the perfect getaway.\n\nIf you’re still trying to decide, check out my post on Geneva vs Zurich which compares the two cities on a range of different features.\n\nHow cold does it get in Zurich in winter?\n\nZurich can get chilly in the winter months. However, the temperature generally hovers above zero, with just a few periods when it dips into minus figures.\n\nHaving said this, if you visit between December and February, average temperatures are usually low, so it’s best to plan for cold days and pack accordingly. January is apparently the coldest month.\n\nDespite the chilly temperatures at this time of year, you can be blessed with clear and sunny days. We once visited in December and were treated to crisp and bright winter days, perfect for walks and sightseeing.\n\nHow to get to Zurich\n\nYou can fly to Zurich from many countries, both within and outside Europe. The main airline carriers service the city.\n\nSwiss trains are also renowned for their efficiency, so getting around this mountainous and extremely scenic country, as well as connecting to neighbouring countries, is incredibly easy.\n\nSee below for my ideas for day trips from Zurich.\n\nConnections from Zurich airport are quick and easy: you can literally reach the centre of Zurich in under 10 minutes. The speed and efficiency of connections when you arrive is one (of many!) reasons why Zurich is among my favourite travel on a time budget destinations.\n\nAlternatively, if you’d prefer to book a private transfer from the airport, click here.\n\nHow to get around Zurich\n\nZurich has an efficient public transport system consisting of trains, trams, buses and boats.\n\nThe Zurich Transport Network (ZVV) covers all transportation and its website has maps and timetables that you can download. The Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) covers the more regional and international train connections.\n\nTickets can be purchased for varying durations and they allow you to hop on and off of different transportation, including the ferry boats that skirt across the lake.\n\nYou can also buy a Zurich Card that gives you unlimited travel for specified periods as well as extra discounts for sightseeing.\n\nWhat is the Zurich Card?\n\nThe Zurich Card is designed to help tourists get around the city and sightsee in an efficient and cost-effective way.\n\nYou can buy a Zurich Card for either 24 or 72 hours. As well as giving you unlimited second-class travel on public transportation around the region, it entitles you to other benefits, including some boat trips/cruises and discounts on entry to museums.\n\nA Zurich Card is 27 CHF for 24 hours and 53 CHF for 72 hours. If you think you will be hopping on and off transport all day, and may also visit museums, it might save you money to purchase one.\n\nYou can buy a card here.\n\nWhat are the top things to do in Zurich in winter?\n\nZurich is a city that is bursting with attractions whatever the season or weather. But if you’re visiting during the winter months, there are lots of things that you can add to your to do list.\n\nRead on for the best things to do in Zurich in winter.\n\nYou will also find Zurich itineraries at the end of this guide.\n\nExplore the old town and Bahnhofstrasse\n\nZurich’s historic old town is like something from a fairytale. Essentially, it covers the narrow streets in the two districts that straddle both sides of the River Limmat that flows through the heart of the city.\n\nBelow are the highlights that I’d recommend seeing while exploring the historic centre. Alternatively, you can book organised tours that will cover the main sights or this two-hour bus tour which will take you around these.\n\nNiederdorf and Limmatquai\n\nOn one side of the river you have Niederdorf, a long pedestrianised street which runs parallel to Limmatquai along the waterfront.\n\nLined with bars, restaurants and shops, and with small cobbled streets branching off, you can wander all the way up to Bellevueplatz and the start of the lake. It’s a lively and bustling area full of nightlife.\n\nIn the colder months, the narrowness of the streets, lit up in the dark, makes it feel really festive and wintery (and a little bit romantic for anyone looking for a short break later in February for Valentine’s Day). During the Christmas holiday season there are Christmas decorations, twinkly festive lights and Christmas markets to wander around.\n\nOn Limmatquai, there is Zurich’s 17th century renaissance rathaus (town hall). There are also steps down to the river. In summer we have a tradition of dipping our toes in the water here.\n\nThe Grossmunster Church\n\nAt the junction with Kirchgasse is the 16th century protestant Grossmunster church, with its distinctive twin spires.\n\nWhen you visit, make sure you stand outside the front and look down. You get an impressive view from here of the nearby Fraumunster church on the opposite side of the river.\n\nFor those with a good head for heights, you can also pay to go up to the viewing deck outside one of the spires.\n\nI recently did this. And despite feeling a little out of breath by the time I reached the top (unfortunately there is no lift), I thought it was worth the effort.\n\nThe Fraumunster Church\n\nAcross the river is the Fraumunster, another landmark in Zurich’s skyline. With its tall thin green spire, you can’t fail to miss this beautiful church.\n\nSo named because of the women who lived in the church (frau meaning married woman in German), it is definitely worth a visit. According to the Zuerich.com website, you shouldn’t miss its beautiful stained glass windows. It is open for visitors every day.\n\nSt. Peter’s Church\n\nA stone’s throw from the Fraumunster is St. Peter’s Church.\n\nThis is Zurich’s oldest parish church and is famed for having Europe’s largest church clock face.\n\nThe Lindenhof\n\nSt. Peter’s Church is a short walk from the Lindenhof, a small and compact outdoor open space (once the site of a Roman fort).\n\nWhen we visited in December, it was a clear, bright winter’s day and we got a fantastic view back over to the Grossmunster from this vantage point. It’s a lovely place to look out over part of the Limmat river.\n\nYou can also get more great views over the city from the rooftop bar in the Storchen Hotel (note this has a minimum charge per person to go in).\n\nBahnhofstrasse\n\nA short walk down from the Lindenhof and connected to the old town by a network of pretty historic streets and squares is Bahnhofstrasse. This is a major thoroughfare that connects the lakeshore to the main station.\n\nBahnhofstrasse is an important shopping street and as well as sporting your standard shops, it’s also where you can marvel at luxury and boutique outlets (think Prada, Louis Vuitton, Rolex etc).\n\nIt’s also where you’ll find Paradeplatz and many of the city’s financial institutions. The concentration of banks and insurance companies is a reminder that Zurich is a major player in the world’s banking industry.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the history of banking in the city, there is a tour that you can book.\n\nGo on a cruise around Lake Zurich\n\nSeeing Lake Zurich, stretching out towards the mountains at the end of Zurich’s old town, is an absolute must. You can walk alongside the lake and even swim in the crystal clear waters, but in winter, you might prefer to take a boat tour instead.\n\nThe docking area is a stone’s throw from the old town so it’s really easy to book a cruise.\n\nHowever, if this is something you really want to do, I’d suggest arranging a cruise in advance. Ideally, you should plan it into your itinerary as the frequency of cruises reduces during the winter months.\n\nYou can, however, take a round trip from Zurich Burkliplatz (near to the old town) and back, via Thalwil and Erlenbach. Click here to access the timetable.\n\nYou can also book special cruises (e.g. ones where you can taste Swiss fondue or cook your own food on a hot stone) up until mid-December. Click here for more details.\n\nHave a brisk winter walk around Zurichhorn Park and visit the Chinese Garden\n\nNot far from the old town is Zurichhorn Park, a popular green space that runs beside the lake.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully relaxing spot whatever the weather.\n\nYou can stroll through the leafy surroundings in the fresh air, soak up the sights, including the intriguing sculptures dotted throughout, and grab a coffee. As its name suggests, Lakeside offers magnificent lake views whilst also enabling you to put your feet up and/or escape from the cold.\n\nYou can also find the Chinese Garden in Zurichhorn Park. It may be small, but it is beautiful and definitely one of the top attractions to add to your list, especially if you’d like some peace and tranquillity.\n\nThere’s a small lake in the middle and several colourful temples.\n\nStadt Zurich states that the garden is highly regarded and “considered to be one of the highest-ranking gardens outside of China”. Go here and you’ll soon forget you’re sightseeing in a major European city. It is open every day from 11am until 5pm and entrance is free.\n\nIf you fancy a trip out to Zurichhorn, then there are several options: catch the boat to the Zurichhorn stop; get 912 or 916 bus to the Chinagarten stop; or take the number 2 or number 4 tram to Hoschgasse or Frohlichstrasse. Walking will take 20-30 minutes.\n\nEscape the cold and visit a top museum\n\nAs you would expect in such a major city, there are some fantastic museums that you can visit. Below are some suggestions.\n\nThe Swiss National Museum (the Landesmueum Zurich): this houses many historical and cultural art works and artifacts spanning different centuries.\n\nThe museum has a few permanent exhibitions.\n\nThis includes one that covers Switzerland’s history and another where children can have different experiences – for example, exploring an Arabian palace, an old railway carriage and a sailing ship. There is also an online collection that you can access through its website.\n\nThe museum can found next to Zurich’s main railway station. It is open every day except Monday from 10.00 to 17.00 (with a later closing time of 19.00 on a Thursday evening).\n\nThe Fifa World Cup Museum: dedicated to the history of football, this top attraction is kitted out with a wealth of fascinating footballing facts.\n\nIt covers all the World Cup tournaments, and features exhibits that showcase football kits, equipment and trophies. It also sports interactive sections which are particularly good for children.\n\nThe museum is open every day except Mondays from 10am to 6pm. To get here, travel to Bahnhof Enge and walk a short distance.\n\nThe Rietberg Museum: an important art museum, the Rietberg displays works from Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. Its website tells us that it has “23,000 objects and 37,000 ethnographic photographs in its collection”.\n\nSituated on Gablerstrasse 15, near to Enge station, it is open every day except Monday from 10.00 to 5.00 (on Wednesdays it closes at 8pm).\n\nThe Kunsthaus Zurich: Another art museum, the Kunsthaus Zürich contains one of the largest collections in the country with an estimated 4,000 works of arts and sculpture dating back to the 13th century. Many of these are on permanent display, with a variety of temporary exhibitions.\n\nThe Zurich Tram Museum: Zurich’s tram network is extensive so it’s quite fitting that there is a museum dedicated to this as a mode of transport.\n\nThe museum offers an immersive experience. In its own words, “Visitors are invited not just to look, but to touch and feel the trams, hear the vehicles and let their emotions run free; a memory of a wonderful meeting at a tram stop, a charming tram driver or an adventurous trip on the bus!”.\n\nYou can visit on four days of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday) from 1pm until 6pm. Entry is free for Zurich Card holders.\n\nThe museum is located on Forchstrasse 260, in District 8. This is near to Zurichhorn Park so you could combine a museum visit with the Chinese Garden.\n\nThe Wow Museum: Billing itself as the “room for illusions”, the Wow Museum “combines fun with learning, culture and virtuality”.\n\nWhen you visit, you can experience rooms with different designs, lighting and artefacts within them – all quite bizarre and striking, and all providing some unique photo opportunities. It also has a magic show on a Friday night.\n\nThe Wow Museum is situated right by the main railway station and is open every day except Tuesday, including in the evenings.\n\nChill out (and warm up!) in a thermal spa bath\n\nFor me, there’s nothing better on a cold winter day than the opportunity to immerse yourself in warm and relaxing thermal baths.\n\nOne of the best places to do this is at the Thermaldbad and Spa, situated on the renovated site of Zurich’s old Hürlimann brewery. This city landmark produced the wonderfully named Santa Claus or Samichlaus beer.\n\nAs well as a fabulous rooftop thermal pool with panoramic views of the city, the spa offers a breadth of experiences, not least an unmissable opportunity to bathe outside on a cold winter day.\n\nThe Irish-Roman circuit takes you through a series of pools and wellness rooms.\n\nThe cheaper and quicker dip in the indoor beer vat, followed by the outdoor pool, is also a great experience. See my earlier post for more details.\n\nThe spa is a short distance from the main sights, and is therefore a great place for a short visit. You can easily reach it by public transport. From Enge station it’s only a five-minute walk.\n\nSample the mouthwateringly delicious Swiss food\n\nSwitzerland offers a smorgasbord of delicious dishes to explore. Many are perfect in the winter, perhaps reflecting the country’s mountainous geography (note, however, that they are not good for the waistline!).\n\nPopular dishes include:\n\nRosti: a large fritter type dish consisting of grated potato that is either baked or fried. It can be served a side dish or as a main, complete with various different toppings.\n\nAs a carb lover, I absolutely love rosti and make sure I order it every time I visit. It’s particularly appropriate when it’s wintery and is my food heaven.\n\nFondue: a pot of hot melted cheese that you dip bread into, this is the ultimate winter warmer!\n\nThere are variations (e.g. hot oil to dip meat into or sweet chocolate fondues), but it’s the cheese one that is the traditional Swiss dish. See later for where you can eat this.\n\nAlternatively, click here for a sightseeing and fondue tour.\n\nRaclette: this is a dish named after the cheese that comprises its main ingredient. The cheese is melted at the table and then served with a selection of accompaniments.\n\nSausages: I personally think that you can’t have a list of the top things to eat in Zurich without including sausages on it.\n\nIn the bierkeller we visit, there’s an extensive choice and it takes time to decide which to order. They also have a “Sausage of the Month”!\n\nThese dishes are often served with sauerkraut, potatoes (or potato salad) and a gravy.\n\nSpaetzle: this is a noodle/pasta type of dish that will appeal to vegetarians as it often comes meat-free and served with cheese or onions (although there also plenty of recipes that do include meat). Another hearty dish for the colder days.\n\nZurich geschnetzeltes: a dish from Zurich itself, this is veal covered in a white wine cream sauce and served with mushrooms. Rosti often comes with it.\n\nClearly this is not one for the vegetarians, although Haus Hiltl does its own non-meat version. See my previous post for more details.\n\nChocolate: last but by no means least, there’s the world-famous Swiss chocolate. I don’t think much more needs to be said about this!\n\nBut if you do want to try some of the more exclusive brands, Bahnofstrasse offers some of the best outlets to buy them. This includes the Sprungli, Laderach and Tuescher confiseries. You can buy chocolates or stop off for chocolate cake.\n\nYou can also book organised tours where you learn more about the history of chocolate in Zurich and – most importantly! – get to eat it.\n\nIf you don’t have time to stop off during your time here, you can always buy online at a later stage.\n\nSnuggle up in one of the cosy tearooms and cafes\n\nYou won’t be spoilt for choice when it comes to cosy cafes to snuggle up in. Below are some suggestions.\n\nSprungli: Sprungli is not just a chocolate shop, it also has a café and restaurant on its site.\n\nThe Paradeplatz outlet was opened in the 19th century and so you’re also getting to see a bit of Zurich’s history when you visit. There is a small seating area downstairs but a larger space upstairs.\n\nThe cake is to die for (see below). I’ve been several times and will be back again…\n\nCafe Odeon: another highlight with a colourful history, Café Odeon is definitely worth a visit, especially in the winter. Relatively small and compact in size, you will quickly warm up in the snug environment.\n\nThe café opened in 1911 and has been frequented by all sorts of famous people, from Mussolini and Lenin to Albert Einstein and James Joyce. The website is worth visiting to discover more about its illustrious past.\n\nYou can find it on Limmatquai 2, near the start of the lake and not far from the Zurich Opera House.\n\nCafé Felix: this is situated in the Confierie Teuscher mentioned above – so another opportunity to combine afternoon tea or coffee with chocolate shopping!\n\nIt’s a grand cafe, with high ceilings, elegant bright lights, and a huge staircase in the middle. Situated in Bellevueplatz, at the end of the old town, it’s a perfect stop if you’re sightseeing in this area.\n\nStorchen Zurich: Located right on the river on one side of the old town, this is a gorgeous place to stop for refreshments. It has a ferry docking station right outside (complete with the old-fashioned striped ferry poles flanking it).\n\nInside you’ll find comfy sofas and chairs, but I prefer to sit along the outside terrace.\n\nHere you can look out across the river to the Grossmunster church. They provide blankets to wrap up in when it gets cold. It also now has a swanky rooftop bar (note that you have to queue to go in here and there is a minimum charge per person).\n\nHotel Dolder Grand: Going for tea here takes a bit more effort, but if you have the time (and the money – it’s on the pricier side, even for Zurich), it’s definitely worth it.\n\nA hotel that looks straight out of a fairy tale and situated at the summit of one of the hills overlooking Zurich, you can pop in for a drink even if you aren’t staying here as a guest.\n\nHead for the lobby where you can spend a relaxing afternoon seated in an elegant and relaxing lounge bar (when we visited there was even a harpist playing in the background).\n\nYou can order a drink or even a full afternoon tea, and if you visit on a clear day you’ll be treated to spectacular views across the city, lake and mountains. If you’re visiting between October and March, you can skate on the dolder open-air ice rink nearby.\n\nIf you’re coming on public transport from the centre of Zurich, you will need to head to Romerhof and take the small funicular (the Dolderbahn) up the hillside. The number 3 or 8 tram will take you to Romerhof.\n\nHead out for some winter sports\n\nIndulging in one of the many winter sports activities on offer in Zurich will be high on the list for some people.\n\nThe mountains and a number of ski resorts are nearby(Zuerich.com lists 10 areas within 90 minutes of the city where you can go ski-ing). There are also places where you can go tobogganing.\n\nThe city is home to quite a few ice rinks during the winter months. From October to March you can also go ice skating by the Dolder Grand Hotel. There is also both an indoor and outdoor rink at the Heuried sports centre at Wasserschöpfi 71.\n\nThere are other rinks along Lake Zurich, but outside of Zurich city itself (e.g. in Rapperswil).\n\nVisit a Christmas market\n\nThere are several Christmas markets that you can visit on a winter break to Zurich. These should definitely be on your list of things to do in Zurich if you visit over the Christmas season.\n\nThere is a market in the old town where you can combine some sightseeing with browsing among the stalls. If it’s really chilly, try some hot chocolate or local gluwein.\n\nAnother market sets up on the concourse in the main train station – the Christkindlimarkt.\n\nHere you can look up at a huge Christmas tree decorated with 7,000 Swarovski crystals – something that I imagine that is unique to Zurich. Nearby is the City Christmas market.\n\nThere is also Werdmühleplatz Christmas market, with its unique “singing Christmas tree”.\n\nThis isn’t a actually tree, but a stage in the shape of a tree where choirs stand and entertain the locals with festive hymns. This market is also not far from the train station.\n\nAll of these markets run from mid to late November until around Christmas Eve.\n\nGo further afield – day trips from Zurich\n\nZurich’s location means it’s really easy to combine it a day trip or overnight stay in other destinations – for example:\n\nSchaffhausen and the Rhine Falls: Schaffhausen is a lovely place to day trip to from Zurich. It is around 40 minutes to an hour by train.\n\nThere is gorgeous old town, a 16th century fortress, and the Rhine River where you can take boat rides.\n\nIt is also a stone’s throw from the Rhine Falls, Europe’s biggest waterfall.\n\nRapperswil: Rapperswil is on the north side of Lake Zurich. Famous locally for its rose gardens, Rapperswil is ideal for a short excursion.\n\nIt has an old town and a castle with scenic views across the lake. A mere 40-minute train ride from Zurich’s central train station, it’s definitely worth the excursion.\n\nLucerne: this enchanting city on the shores of Lake Lucerne deserves seeing if you have time. It’s around an hour by train away and also has an historic centre and castle to explore.\n\nHowever, the most famous site here is undoubtedly the 14th century wooden Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge) which you can walk over across the Reuss river. If you’re in Zurich during the winter months, check out my post on the 13 best things to do in Lucerne in winter.\n\nVaduz: If you fancy visiting another country, then you can literally pop over to Liechtenstein. Trains from Zurich take between 40 and 60 minutes, after which there is a 30-minute bus ride into Vaduz from Sargans.\n\nVaduz is very small for a capital city so you’ll only need a few hours: walk to the 12th century castle on the hill, explore the centre and the pretty Rotes Haus (Red House) and admire the street art throughout.\n\nThe Rhine Falls: Zurich is less than an hour away from Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Rhine (Rhein) Falls. If you visit in winter its flow is around 250,000 litres a second.\n\nYou can get a good look at the falls from a platform or take a boat ride on the river. For the more adventurous, you can also take a rope ride across the river and view the falls from up high.\n\nTrains take around 50 minutes to Schaffhausen before changing for a 5 minute journey to Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall. Tickets for the falls are 5 CHF for the Southern Bank.\n\nOr you could alternatively take a tour directly to the falls.\n\nSee some spectacular alpine scenery and ride the “world’s first revolving cable car”\n\nZurich is close to some stunning mountain scenery that is worth the effort to see.\n\nMount Pilatus: Mount Pilatus is close to Lucerne (less than 10 kilometres away) so you could combine a trip to Lucerne with seeing some spectacular views in the Swiss Alps.\n\nIt is regarded as one of the most beautiful places in this part of Switzerland. The mountain also hosts Europe’s highest Christmas market.\n\nAnd it is said that if you visit on a clear day, you can look out on over 70 mountain peaks.\n\nMount Titlus: Lucerne is also the gateway to Mount Titlis. This is the highest summit in central Switzerland.\n\nFrom Engelberg, there is a cable car type aerial cableway that you can hop on that takes you up the mountains. The ride is about half an hour, during which you ascend over 3,000 metres.\n\nEn route, you swap to the Titlis Rotair, “the world’s first revolving cable car”. This ensures you can’t fail to miss all the spectacular views from this height as the car rotates 360 degrees, and you get to see the mountain scenery from all different angles.\n\nAfter experiencing breathtaking views during your ride, several activities keep you occupied at the top.\n\nThere is a glacier cave, where you can walk to 10 metres underneath a glacier, as well as a 100-metre long suspension bridge that hangs 500 metres above the ground. It is apparently Europe’s highest suspension bridge. There is also the ‘Ice Flyer’, a chair lift that transports you across the slopes.\n\nYou can book a day trip from Zurich to Mount Titlis here.\n\nMount Rigi: Other places with incredible views include Mount Rigi (or ‘Queen of the Mountains’).\n\nThere is a spa here, restaurants to eat in, and a number of hiking trails to explore. You can also partake in the usual winter sports on Mt. Rigi, including skiing and sledding.\n\nIf you do plan to visit the surrounding areas and mountains, my travel tip would be to consider purchasing the Swiss Travel Pass. This gives you access to all forms of public transport across its network.\n\nYou can use it to hop on the mountain trains on Rigi. It also gives access to a large number of museums in the country.\n\nWhere to eat in Zurich in winter\n\nZurich has plenty foodie spots to choose from.\n\nThere are far too many decent eateries to list here, so I have recommended a few notable eateries below where I have either dined myself or have looked up the menus.\n\nYou are literally spoilt for choice; there are restaurants and cafes to suit all budgets and tastes. The Zurich tourist site provides a wealth of information on eating out.\n\nWalliskeller: Located in the old town, Walliskeller offers a wide selection of different Swiss classics. This includes sausages, fish from the Swiss mountains, and fondue (both cheese and meat).\n\nIt also has “fondue gondolas” outside the restaurant – small two-person gondolas for a romantic evening of fondue. This is definitely one of the things I’d like to do in Zurich in winter.\n\nZeughauskeller: this is a cheery beer keller in the city centre. It serves our favourite Swiss food and has a generous selection of sausage dishes to choose from. It’s also a slightly cheaper restaurant to eat in a city where dining out is not cheap. We’ve been several times.\n\nKosmos bistro: you can combine eating with seeing a film, drinking cocktails in a bar or visiting a book café in this large venue at Kosmos.\n\nThe restaurant menu is eclectic to suit all tastes, and includes salad dishes, chicken wings, chicken tagine, Wiener schnitzel and fish and chips.\n\nIt can be found at Lagerstrasse 104, near the Swiss National Museum.\n\nHaus Hiltl: The world’s oldest vegetarian restaurant, this eatery does a fantastic Sunday buffet brunch (see my previous post for more details).\n\nThe choice on offer is extensive: an impressive and eclectic mix of traditional Swiss dishes and more modern gastronomic inventions, as well as local and international cuisine.\n\nIf you visit Zurich, I’d recommend this restaurant, which is located about a 10-minute walk from the city’s main train station and off the main thoroughfare.\n\nYou can buy their wonderful cookbook here.\n\nRaclette Factory: If you fancy trying out raclette, but are not sure about about it, then the Raclette Factory might be for you.\n\nYou can build your own dish here by selecting your cheese, a side and a topping. Alternatively, there are more standard raclette dishes.\n\nIt is located in the old town near to the rathaus.\n\nLakeside: If you’re in the Zurichhorn area, then you could stay for a meal at Lakeside and enjoy stunning views of the lake. It serves vegetarian, meat and fish dishes. It also has a brunch buffet on Sundays from 11.00-2.30pm.\n\nWhere to stay in Zurich in winter\n\nWe’ve stayed in several hotels on our countless visits to Zurich. Below are some personal recommendations. However, there is an enormous choice, depending on your budget and preferred location.\n\nRead on for my personal suggestions.\n\nHotel Montana is a mid-range hotel that offers a decent breakfast as part of your room price. It’s ideal for short breaks as it’s located just a few minutes’ walk from the main train station. We’ve stayed twice.\n\nMercure Stoller: This is another mid-range hotel. It’s a little out of the old town at Badenerstrasse 357, but only a short tram ride away and the tram stop (Albisriederplatz) is right across the road from the hotel.\n\nWe didn’t get breakfast included in our room rate, but there was a pleasant little diner a couple of doors away.\n\nMotel One: This hotel is also a recommendation of ours. It’s another well located hotel, around a 20-25 minute walk from the train station. It has a great bar located on the ground floor.\n\nWe stayed during Christmas and New Year last year and it had a wonderful festive feel to it.\n\nNovotel Zurich City West: a really nice hotel with a gym and indoor pool, it is located about 10 minutes by tram from the city centre. The tram stop is right by the hotel however, as well as a train station which connects to the airport.\n\nHotel Dolder Grand: for those of you with cash to splash, you’ll no doubt love the Hotel Dolder Grand. Set at the top of a hill and with spectacular views over Zurich, the lake and the mountains, complete with ice rink in winter, it’s definitely somewhere you indulge in the finer things in life.\n\nStorchen Zurich: Another hotel for those who want something more luxurious, I’ve added this on because I love the location and because it consistently gets top star ratings in reviews.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it has a terrace along the river where you can sit and look across the river.\n\nItineraries for short breaks in Zurich in winter\n\nIf you’re travelling on a time budget, you’ll want to see the main sights in a short period of time. I have therefore set out a one- and two-day itinerary below.\n\nNote that these do not include the time needed for any winter sports. To do this, you would either need more time in Zurich or sacrifice some of the city centre sights.\n\nI hope this has convinced you that there are plenty of things to do in Zurich in winter.
