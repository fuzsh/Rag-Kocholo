ZÃ¼rich â See the Historic Sites Comfortably\n\nZÃ¼rich is the largest city and the natural starting point to explore the rest of the region. ZÃ¼rich International Airport is the largest in the country, and the railway hub station is conveniently underneath. Though it is cold, using the public transportation allows you to see the sights comfortably.\n\nThe average daily highs are 5ËC (41ËF), and the nightly lows are -1ËC (30ËF). There are 9 days of rain or snow, so snow usually is not on the ground. The city has an extensive network of trains, trams, and buses that makes tourism and sightseeing easier and convenient.\n\nThe train and tram conveniently run from the airport to ZÃ¼rich Main Station in the city center. From there, you could walk a minute or two to the Swiss National Museum. The station conveniently borders the Old Town with pedestrian streets and historic buildings such as the FraumÃ¼nster Church.\n\nWinter festival: A highlight of Lent is the ZÃ¼riCarneval that is on different dates each year depending on the dates for Lent. In 2024, it will be held February 16-18. It is a city festival spanning 3 days that includes cultural events, concerts, parades, bands, a river show, an air show, and more.\n\n2. Zermatt â Experience Europe's Top Ski Resorts for Winter Sports in Ideal Weather\n\nFor skiing and snowboarding, the high elevation slopes around Zermatt are among the best in Switzerland. The longest ski run is rated red (advanced intermediate) and variously rated the first or second longest in the world covering 20 km (13 miles).\n\nZermatt has about the most adventurous skiing in Switzerland including lofty heli-skiing on good snow. The ski slopes extend up to 3,899 meters (12,795 feet) on the Matterhorn. The skiing is better than earlier in winter because there are 4 hours of sunshine and 10Â½ hours of daylight.\n\nZermatt's elevation is 1,620 meters (5,310 feet). There is pristine air, and the average daily high temperature is about -5Â°C (23Â°F). The nightly lows are about -13Â°C (9Â°F).\n\nA ban on cars keeps the sky pristine and makes it better for walking and enjoyment of the sharp snowy peaks. The are a variety of luxury hotels, and prices per day are about the highest in Switzerland. ZÃ¼rich Airport is about a 3Â½-hour drive away.\n\n3. St. Moritz â Get More Sunshine, Geothermal Warmth, and Italian Gourmet Cuisine\n\nSt. Moritz is in the southeast of Switzerland near Italy, and since it is on the south side of the high Alps, it gets the benefit of about 4 hours of sunshine and warmer Mediterranean breezes. The sun, hot springs, and a beautiful Alpine lake are natural highlights.\n\nThe daily highs are an average of about -5Â°C (23Â°F). It gets very cold at night dropping to -15Â°C (5Â°F). There are about 18 days with low snowfall. The elevation is 1,782 meters (5,846 feet). It is the most luxurious of the Swiss resort towns.\n\nItalian cuisine is one of the cultural highlights with gourmet Italian restaurants. The thermal spas are places to heal and relax. There are plenty of other gourmet restaurants and luxury shops. Nearby towns such as St. Moritz Bad and Celerina have their own attractions and culture.\n\nWhite Turf: There is a winter carnival in February on the frozen lake with horse racing, music, and gourmet catering as the highlights.\n\n4. Bernese Oberland â Explore High Mountain Towns and Villages and Do Winter Sports\n\nSt. Moritz and Zermatt are luxury ski resort areas, but Bernese Oberland is a middle-budget area renowned by backpackers for great natural beauty and also known for good winter sports. These are mountains and valleys above Bern, about 45 minutes away.\n\nThe towns, villages, scenic areas, and resorts of the Bernese Oberland are well connected by trams and trains. People generally do not drive in this area. They take the public transportation. Interlaken is the gateway town to the valleys and peaks. Take the train to Interlaken first, then there are many options in February.\n\nInterlaken has daily highs averaging about 5Â°C (41Â°F) and lows of -3Â°C (27Â°F) with about 7 days of low rainfall/snowfall. From there, you could go to the scenic towns of Lauterbrunnen or Grindelwald and then continue into the mountains to the ski resorts.\n\nTravel by train: The Bernese Oberland is nicely centrally located. ZÃ¼rich and Zermatt are 2Â½ hours away from Interlaken. Lucerne is almost two hours away. Geneva is almost three hours away.\n\nFor more about Interlaken, see: visiting Switzerland in January.\n\nCrowds and Costs for Traveling in February\n\nWhile in southern Europe it is low season, high in the Swiss Alps, it is a peak tourism season for visitors from around the world who flock to the ski fields and resorts. Conditions at higher altitudes are mostly snowy and frozen. Prices peak at the Alpine resort areas such as Bernese Oberland.\n\nConversely, there is moderate or even low tourism at low elevations. The cities that have the travel hubs have the high tourism. Statistics are confusing, but February is the highest priced month of the year for a vacation.\n\nHowever, the price of international airline tickets are lower compared to the summer high tourism season. The reason for the disparity might be because most travelers arrive from European countries by land.\n\nSince it takes time to acclimate comfortably for the high elevations, consider staying at low altitude tourist base towns and cities such as Interlaken, Bern, and ZÃ¼rich.\n\nThere are no national public holidays in February.\n\nFasnacht: The various cities have a winter or spring carnival that depends on the date of Easter. In ZÃ¼rich, it is the ZÃ¼riCarneval (see above). The dates for the carnival are different for the various cities.\n\nWhat to Wear in February\n\nTake a thick coat and rain/snow gear. Along with your coat, for convenient touring and stepping in and out of buildings, dress in layers for comfort. Wear heavier winter clothes for the mountains.\n\nHere is a winter packing list for a few essentials in Switzerland:\n\nWarm hat\n\nWarm boots with good traction (you might wear them in-flight to travel light)\n\nComfortable shoes with good traction\n\nCardigans, thermals, or long underwear\n\nWater resistant gloves\n\nUniversal adapter\n\nPolarized glasses to reduce the snow glare\n\nMonthly Weather and Travel Information for Switzerland\n\nPrevious month: Switzerland in January"
