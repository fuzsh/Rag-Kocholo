Here's a snapshot of Zurich weather and the best time to visit Zurich\n\nWhen you think of Switzerland, you think of the snow and cold. But that's not the weather in Zurich all year round. There are summer months where you will get some warmth from the sun and enjoy lush green landscapes. For tourists, the ideal time to visit Zurich would be between April to October when the weather is not so freezing and you can enjoy a lot of outdoor activities. But of course, the city is beautiful no matter the season and is a spectacular place to visit any time of the year.\n\nSpring (March to May)\n\nPhotograph by www.flytographer.com\n\nSpring is a time when flowers bloom and the overall white and dullness of the winter, starts to fade away. The freshness of spring brings with it new vigour and the weather starts to get warm enough for tourists to enjoy outdoor activities. The average temperature in March is 10°C but by May this goes up to 18°C with chilly nights at around 10° to 12°C. Rain, however, can be a mood dampener as it can rain for up to 10-12 days in a month during this season.\n\nSechseläuten is a traditional spring festival usually held on the 3rd Monday in April every year.\n\nSummer (June to August)\n\nPhotograph by www.forbes.com\n\nSummers are a popular time to visit Zurich but it is also a time when tourists flock here the most. So while places may get crowded and hotels may be a tad more expensive than other seasons, you are sure to get perfect weather for you to enjoy a perfect holiday. The average temperature is 25°C. The summer months also receive the highest amount of rainfall, so don't forget to carry an umbrella. The warmth of the sun, make up for any rain you may need to put up with.\n\nA Street Parade is a popular event that happens every August near the Lake basin. Swiss National Day is celebrated on the 1st of August. Apart from these, the Zurich Summer Festival takes place throughout the summer months with many street performances, art and events taking place.\n\nAutumn (September to November)\n\nPhotograph by https://zuerichfotos.ch\n\nAutumn has a charm of its own. While September is almost like a summer month (weather-wise), by November temperatures drop to an average of 8°C. The fall months, however, are the slowest moving season for tourists, so you may be able to strike up some great bargains. The average rainfall is around 10 days per month.\n\nThe Zurich Film Festival usually takes place between September and October each year and Wine sampling is best experienced in October.\n\nWinter (December to February)\n\nPhotograph by http://albumarium.com\n\nWinter is a beautiful time to visit Zurich if you are someone who loves the snow and are keen to pack on some winter sports. The hills nearby offer a lot of winter activities which is just a drive away from Zurich. Within the city, the temperatures average a low of 0°C and a high of 4°C. Rain and snow are expected for around 10 days of the month.\n\nCome December and the city is lit up in Christmas spirit. There are many Christmas markets that pop up. Also, the fairytale tram “Märlitram” is a beautiful ride for kids during Christmas."
