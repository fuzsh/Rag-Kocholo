During the winter months, temperatures may occasionally dip below freezing.\n\nDuring January, Zurich is in the midst of winter, characterized by cold weather and occasional occurrences of snow and ice. The average temperature hovers around 0°C (32°F).\n\nFebruary maintains its winter grip, with average temperatures not significantly warmer than those in January. Occasionally, as the month progresses, Zurich may see the first glimpses of sunny days with slightly milder temperatures. However, to make sure you pack accordingly, check the forecast prior to your trip.\n\nWhile March marks the official start of spring, Zurich can still be quite chilly and may even see snowfall. However, with some luck, the first sunny days can bring temperatures ranging from 10 to 15°C (50 to 60°F).\n\nHistorically, the initial snowfall in Zurich has frequently occurred towards the conclusion of November. Otherwise, the month is marked by cool temperatures and fog.\n\nIn Zurich, winter commences in December, bringing cold weather and the potential for snowfall. The sun rarely breaks through the elevated fog in this period\n\nWhat to Pack For Your Zurich Winter Vacation\n\nThough Switzerland in December is not as bad as many think, it is still important to dress warmly. Or better, to dress in layers.\n\n✔️ A warm, waterproof jacket should be one of the first items you think to pack. Avoid choosing a bulky jacket that takes up a lot of space. This can make you feel uncomfortable when you have layers underneath. Instead, opt for a lightweight trench raincoat that will keep you warm, dry, and comfortable.\n\n✔️ A knitted beanie is a perfect solution for keeping the warmth in while you venture out. A hat will keep you toasty warm wherever you are.\n\n✔️ A pair of gloves can do wonders for your mobility and comfort. When selecting your options, it’s worth investing in a pair that can dry quickly and are touch-screen compatible.\n\n✔️ A warm scarf and/or turtleneck sweater are key items for keeping your neck covered. A turtleneck sweater is perfect as a garment to wear underneath your jacket, while the scarf can be removed easily.\n\n✔️ Leggings are an essential item to pack as you can dress them up or down. You can even wear them underneath your denim as an extra layer of warmth.\n\n✔️ When it comes to packing socks for your Zurich winter trip – the thicker, the better. The chances are that you’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors in the snow, and you’ll want your feet to be warm and cozy.\n\n✔️ My favorite winter clothes are thermals. A quality set of thermals is your key to enjoying the winter weather. You have to wear them on a cold day to believe what a wonderful invention it is!\n\n✔️ Make sure you have a trusty pair of waterproof snowshoes. You’ll want your shoes to be as versatile as possible. Snowshoes allow you to enjoy a variety of activities while keeping your feet warm and dry.\n\nTHINGS TO DO IN ZURICH IN THE WINTER MONTHS\n\nNo matter when you visit, whether it’s in December, January, or February, there’s always something to do in this awesome city! So, bundle up and get ready to experience the magic of winter in Zurich!\n\nVisit Christmas Markets\n\nIf you’re planning a winter trip to Zurich in late November or December, you don’t want to miss out on the epic Swiss Christmas markets with the beautiful Christmas decorations that take place from late November until Christmas.\n\nThese markets are some of the best in all of Switzerland and offer everything from mulled wine and delicious food to unique handcrafted gifts and festive decorations.\n\nSo, if you want to get into the holiday spirit and experience some true Swiss magic, make sure to plan your visit during the Christmas market season.\n\nI know some of you might not be the biggest fans of Christmas markets (neither am I, generally speaking), but hear me out! Zurich’s markets are a whole different ball game. These markets are next-level and have something for everyone! Whether you’re on the hunt for the perfect gift or just want to take a stroll through the beautifully decorated markets, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the food and drinks, people! It’s like a foodie’s paradise! You can munch on everything from savory snacks to sweet treats and wash it all down with some delicious mulled wine.\n\nIf you’re looking to explore some of the best Christmas markets in Zurich, make sure to check out the oldest market in the Old Town or the urban “Weinachtsdorf” Christmas village near Bellevue.\n\nAnd don’t forget to swing by the train station, where you’ll find a massive 15-meter Christmas tree at the Christkindlimarkt.\n\nFun fact: this indoor market is one of the largest in Europe, with around 150 stalls! So, get ready to indulge in some festive cheer and yummy treats at Zurich’s epic Christmas markets!\n\nDate: The Christmas Markets take place from the 24. November – 23. December in 2023, so Zurich in December is a good time for the festive atmosphere. Please check the exact times before your visit, as they might slightly differ each year.\n\nZurich’s Christmas markets are a must-see place.\n\nHop on a Jelmoli Märlitram\n\nWho’s up for some Christmas storytelling while taking a tram ride through Zurich? Well, unfortunately, I’ve got some bad news for all you big kids out there. The Jelmoli Märlitram, which offers just that, is only for the little ones between the ages of 4 and 10.\n\nBut if you’ve got some kiddos with you, this is an absolute must-do activity during the holiday season! They’ll get to snuggle up in the cozy tram and listen to magical Christmas stories while taking in the twinkling lights of the city.\n\nBook your tickets for the Jelmoli Märlitram and treat your kids to a magical experience they’ll never forget! While on board, angels will read enchanting Christmas stories, all while the tram is decked out in its festive best.\n\nThe 20-minute journey starts and ends at Bellevue station, giving you a chance to relax and enjoy some downtime while your kids are safe and entertained. So, if you want to make some unforgettable memories with your family this winter, don’t miss out on the Jelmoli Märlitram!\n\nThe tram rides through Zurich from 23. November to 24.December 2023.\n\nTickets can be bought up to a week in advance but also might sell out quickly – at Jelmoli Kids World (a department store at Bahnhofstrasse) on the 2nd floor from November 17, 2023. The prices are about 8 CHF.\n\nGet up Uetliberg\n\nAs a fellow lover of stunning mountain views, I highly recommend a visit to Uetliberg, Zurich’s very own mountain. Now, it may not be the highest peak in Switzerland, but trust me, the views from the top are still absolutely breathtaking.\n\nSo, whether you’re looking to hike to the summit or take the train up, make sure to add Uetliberg to your Zurich itinerary.\n\nThis majestic peak is part of the Albis chain and rises to a towering 870 meters (2,850 feet) above sea level, giving you unparalleled views of the city from about 450 meters above it.\n\nWhether you’re looking to play in the snow or simply take in the stunning winter scenery, Uetliberg is the perfect winter day trip destination. Getting there is a breeze, just hop on a train from Zurich and make your way to the Uetliberg train station. From there, it’s just a short uphill walk to the top.\n\nOnce you reach the summit, you’ll be greeted by a restaurant and a tower. And while there are a few extra stairs to climb to get to the very top of the tower, I promise you, the views are absolutely worth it! Just be prepared to pay CHF 2 to access the platform (though the first few steps are free).\n\nThe train up is free with your Zurich Card or Swiss Travel Pass.\n\nGo Tobogganing\n\nWinter in Switzerland is synonymous with winter sports, but while Zurich may not be the ultimate destination for skiing or snowboarding, there are still plenty of fun activities to be had. One of the most popular winter pastimes, regardless of age, is tobogganing!\n\nNow, since snow in Zurich can be a bit of a hit or miss, your best bet for some epic tobogganing fun is to head outside of the city. Luckily, I’ve got just the spot for you – Uetliberg!\n\nYou might remember me mentioning it earlier as an amazing place to visit in the winter, and now you can add tobogganing to your list of must-do activities there.\n\nIf you’re willing to venture a bit further out, there are plenty of other places to go tobogganing, like Mount Rigi, Mount Pilatus, and Mount Titlis, all of which are located near the beautiful city of Lucerne and are guaranteed to have plenty of snow.\n\nEnjoy Ice Skating\n\nIf you’re visiting Zurich during the winter months, you simply have to try your hand at ice skating! This beloved activity is a staple in Zurich’s winter scene, and with so many options to choose from, you’ll have no shortage of places to get your skate on.\n\nWhether you prefer skating on natural ice rinks or indoor rinks, there’s something for everyone. And if you happen to be in Zurich during December, you’re in for a real treat. Picture this – gliding around an ice rink in the middle of a Christmas market, surrounded by twinkling lights and festive cheer. Sounds magical, right?\n\nBut, if you’re looking for a more long-term ice skating solution, make sure to check out the Dolder open-air ice rink. This massive rink is one of the biggest of its kind and stays open from October all the way until March.\n\nPlus, it’s conveniently located near the luxurious Dolder Grand Hotel, making it the perfect spot for a post-skate hot cocoa or cocktail.\n\nHead up Lindenhof Hill\n\nNo matter what time of year you find yourself in Zurich, I highly recommend making the trek up to Lindenhof Hill. This small hilltop park, located just a few minutes walk from the Old Town, offers some of the most breathtaking views of the city.\n\nThe Lindenhof is a popular spot for locals to bring their lunch and enjoy a quick break from the hustle and bustle of the city. And while it may be too chilly to sit on the benches for too long during the winter months, the stunning views are still worth the trip.\n\nSo, bundle up and take a stroll up to the Lindenhof, where you can take in the picturesque scenery and get a unique perspective of Zurich.\n\nDiscover the Old Town\n\nIf you’re looking for a truly picturesque spot in Zurich, you simply must visit the Old Town. This charming area is especially enchanting during late November and December when the festive spirit is in full swing.\n\nStroll down the narrow streets and alleyways and discover a plethora of unique boutiques, stores, and charming cafes and restaurants. But it’s not just the shopping and dining that make the Old Town so special – it’s also the stunning old buildings that transport you back in time.\n\nWhether you’re exploring during the day or taking in the ambiance during the afternoon and evening, the Old Town is a must-visit spot in Zurich that’s sure to capture your heart. So, grab a cup of coffee and take a leisurely stroll through this magical part of the city.\n\nOne popular way to discover the old town is via a guided tour. You can check out tours here.\n\nGo to Fraumünster\n\nIf you’re looking for a bit of culture and architecture during your visit to Zurich, make sure to add some of the city’s beautiful churches to your itinerary. Not only are they a great place to warm up during the winter months, but they also offer stunning and simple interiors that are sure to impress.\n\nOne church that you absolutely can’t miss is the Fraumünster, one of Zurich’s most important religious sites. With its iconic golden clock face and distinctive greenish roof, it’s easy to spot from afar. And if you’re visiting during the holiday season, you’re in for a real treat! The church exudes a special festive atmosphere that’s sure to leave you feeling full of cheer.\n\nSo, don’t miss your chance to admire the beautiful architecture and soak in the history and culture at Fraumünster church during your visit to Zurich.\n\nIn the winter months, it is open from 10 am to 5 pm, except for Sundays and holidays when it is only open after services.\n\nTourists have to pay an entrance fee of CHF 5 (and then visit the crypt museum), while non-tourists can enter for free and join services.\n\nStroll Limmatquai Riverfront\n\nIf you’re looking for a romantic winter stroll in Zurich, I highly recommend taking a walk along both banks of the Limmat River. The scenery is lovely, and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to cozy up at one of the many restaurants along the way.\n\nThe Limmat River is the perfect backdrop for a romantic evening or a casual catch-up with friends. So, bundle up and take a relaxing stroll along the river, where you can indulge in good food and drink while taking in the beauty of Zurich.\n\nNot only will you enjoy stunning views of the water, but you’ll also have the chance to admire some of the city’s most beautiful buildings.\n\nFrom elegant historic landmarks to modern and innovative designs, the buildings along the river are sure to impress. Stroll along the riverbank – a delightful activity that’s sure to make your winter getaway all the more memorable.\n\nVisit the Illuminarium\n\nFor a truly magical experience in Zurich, make sure to check out the Illuminarium. From November to December, the inner courtyard of the National Museum is transformed into a stunning winter wonderland of light, music, and culinary delights.\n\nAs you wander through the free section of the courtyard, you’ll find a cozy bar, a fondue chalet, and various food stalls to indulge in. But the real magic happens in the paid section, where visitors can witness two breathtakingly elaborate light shows that are sure to leave you in awe.\n\nSo, bundle up and head to the National Museum for an unforgettable winter experience that’s sure to dazzle your senses. With stunning illuminations, delicious food, and a festive ambiance, the Illuminarium is the perfect place to get into the holiday spirit and create lasting memories.\n\nDates: 10th November – 30th December\n\nGo to Grossmünster\n\nIf you’re looking for a cozy indoor spot to visit during your winter stay in Zurich, I highly recommend checking out Grossmünster church. With its iconic two Romanesque towers and a prime location near Limmatplatz, this church is easy to spot and is a must-see for history and architecture buffs.\n\nStep inside and marvel at the stunning interiors, which feature intricate details and breathtaking design. Whether you’re seeking a peaceful escape from the winter chill or are simply interested in exploring one of Zurich’s most iconic landmarks, Grossmünster is the perfect spot to visit on your winter getaway.\n\nIf you’re up for a bit of a climb, I highly recommend visiting the towers at Grossmünster church for some truly breathtaking views of Zurich. However, be warned that you’ll have to climb 187 narrow steps to reach the top!\n\nThere is an entrance fee to visit the towers, but I assure you that it’s a small price to pay for such a unique and memorable experience. So, channel your inner adventurer and climb to the top of Grossmünster’s towers for a view of Zurich that you won’t soon forget!\n\nThe church itself is free to visit.\n\nThere is a 5 CHF fee for getting up the towers\n\nIn the winter months, it is open from 10 am to 5 pm – and on Sundays, it opens after the service.\n\nLake Zurich\n\nWhile Lake Zurich might not look its best on a gray and gloomy day, I still highly recommend taking a stroll along its picturesque shores. It’s a must-visit spot during the winter months, and you never know when the sun might decide to peek out and transform the scenery into something truly stunning.\n\nOn sunny or snowy days, Lake Zurich is a breathtaking sight to behold. The sparkling water and snow-capped mountains in the distance create a winter wonderland that’s sure to take your breath away.\n\nSo, don’t let a little bit of gray weather deter you from visiting this iconic spot in Zurich. With its stunning views and tranquil atmosphere, Lake Zurich is the perfect winter destination for those looking to relax and take in the beauty of nature.\n\nStarting from Buerkliplatz, you can choose to walk along the left or right shores of the lake. While both sides offer stunning views, I personally find that the right side tends to be quieter and less crowded.\n\nWhile I prefer visiting Lake Zurich during the summer months, there’s still plenty to enjoy during the winter season. Take in the tranquil beauty of the lake, snap some photos of the snow-capped mountains in the distance, and enjoy a peaceful winter walk along the shores.\n\nWith its serene beauty and peaceful atmosphere, it’s the perfect winter destination for those looking to connect with nature and relax.\n\nZurich Thermal Bath\n\nCheck out prices for a thermal bath in Zurich – including fantastic views over Zurich – here.\n\nBahnhofstrasse\n\nShopaholics, if you’re looking to do some Christmas shopping in Zurich, then look no further than Bahnhofstrasse – one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world! While it can get quite busy in December, the festive atmosphere and stunning illuminations (after sunset) make it all worth visiting Zurich´s main street.\n\nIf you prefer a more relaxed shopping experience, then consider visiting at the beginning of the year when the crowds have dissipated. However, keep in mind that many of the snack stalls and illuminations may be gone by then.\n\nWhile Bahnhofstrasse may be known for its luxury stores and high-end boutiques, there are also plenty of more affordable options to choose from. So, don’t let your budget hold you back from exploring this iconic shopping destination.\n\nWhether you’re searching for the perfect Christmas gift or just want to indulge in some retail therapy, Bahnhofstrasse is the perfect place to do it.\n\nNational Museum\n\nLooking for something to do on a rainy and gray day in Zurich? Look no further than the National Museum! While this activity can be enjoyed any time of the year, it’s the perfect way to spend a dreary winter day indoors.\n\nLocated just behind the main train station, the National Museum is a must-visit if you’re interested in learning more about Switzerland’s rich cultural history. With exhibits covering everything from art and architecture to customs and traditions, there’s something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nSo, if you’re looking to escape the cold and rain, head on over to the National Museum and immerse yourself in the fascinating history and culture of Switzerland.\n\nIt is open daily (except Mondays).\n\nWith the Zurich Card or a Swiss Travel Pass, you will have free entrance.\n\nNew Year´s Eve\n\nNew Year’s Eve in Zurich, Switzerland is an occasion of celebration and joy. Every December 31st, locals and tourists alike come together to witness the spectacular fireworks display that lights up the night sky above Lake Zurich.\n\nThe show begins with a grand parade that takes place along the Bahnhofstrasse, one of Zurich’s most famous streets. This parade features marching bands, floats, and performers from around the world who come together to entertain the crowds.\n\nAfter the parade, a stunning fireworks show is held in front of Zurich’s Old Town Hall. For those wishing to experience an even more grand celebration, there are plenty of private parties and events taking place throughout the city.\n\nKeep in mind that the 1st of January is a public holiday in Switzerland.\n\nLindt – Home of Chocolate\n\nAs a chocolate expert, I can guarantee you one thing: Swiss chocolate is the best! This is how chocolate has to taste! And you will find several chocolate museums in the country. One of the most prominent chocolate brands in Lindt.\n\nYou can visit the interactive Lindt Home of Chocolate Museum, which is next to the Lindt & Sprüngli factory. Find out about the long journey that cocoa takes from bean to bar on an audio-guided tour and learn about the production process through multimedia exhibitions.\n\nOr check out the 9-meter tall chocolate fountain or stroll the biggest chocolate shop, spread over more than 500 m2.. But what would a chocolate museum be if you could not do some chocolate tasting? Savoring a variety of chocolate delicacies is probably one of the highlights (or is it just me?). The Lindt Museum is one of a kind – and perfect for people of any age!\n\nIt is located near Zurich.\n\nWhen you book your ticket, you can choose the time of your visit.\n\nCheck out tickets for the Lindt Museum here.\n\nMount Rigi\n\nIf you are looking for a breathtaking winter experience, then look no further than Mount Rigi!
