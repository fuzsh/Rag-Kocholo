        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to Zurich this summer, don’t worry what to pack because I’ve got your packing list covered! As usual, you don’t want to over-pack and carry around a heavy suitcase, so bring mix and match pieces and a few key accessories you love to go with your outfits and you’ll be all set. Here’s my packing list for a summer trip to Zurich.\n\nUnlike other big European cities (Milan, Paris etc), Zurich is pretty casual as far as fashion goes! They key here is nice, but comfortable, clothes. Bring a few pairs of pants or shorts that you can mix and match with some casual tops. Keep an eye on the weather before your trip because it likes to change quite a bit, even in the summer. (Last week it was in the 80s, this week it’s in the 50s/60s!) Of course, bring your favorite dress for going out to dinner!\n\nDon’t forget to pack a jacket and hiking shoes. If you plan on doing any hiking or going up in the nearby mountains for a view (try Pilatus!) you will definitely want a light jacket, as it can get very cold in the mountains, even in the summer. Bring comfortable and sturdy hiking shoes, as hiking is the “national sport” of Switzerland and something you’ll definitely want to do!\n\nSomething you might not think of bringing on your Zurich trip is a bathing suit, but you should! Zurich is not just a city, but also a very large lake (Zurich See) with plenty of swimming areas around! The swimming areas are called Badis and in the summer you will find them packed with people enjoying the sun! Badis are not only for swimming in the lake, but also have pools, snack bars and many have special kids areas with paddling pools. So pack you bathing suit and do summer like the locals!\n\nTip: you can bring your own food and drinks into the badi as well (yes, even alcohol) so save money by grabbing some sandwiches at Coop before you go in!\n\nHave you been to Zurich? What would you add to this packing list? What other Zurich travel tips would you like to see on my blog?"
