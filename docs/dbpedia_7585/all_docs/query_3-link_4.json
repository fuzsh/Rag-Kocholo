        "text": "A vacation in Switzerland isn’t complete without a stop in Zurich, the country’s largest city. In just a couple days, you can explore the depths of the city, checking out the charm of old town, the beauty of a stroll along Lake Zurich, and everything in between. Here’s my guide on what to see in Zurich in two days.\n\nQuick note: this page contains affiliate links, which means I may earn a small commission if you click on the URL and make a purchase (at no cost to you!). As an affiliate, I only recommend services and products from trusted partners I have thoroughly vetted and can genuinely recommend. Thank you!\n\nIs Two Days Enough for Zurich?\n\nIt’s a relatively small city, so I’d say two days or a weekend in Zurich is a good amount of time. I felt that two full days allowed for enough time to see all the sights I wanted to see without feeling rushed!\n\nOf course, if you have some extra time in your schedule, it doesn’t hurt to add another day or two in the city to your itinerary. Towards the end of this guide, we’ll talk about some additional things to do in Zurich if you have extra time.\n\nTwo Days in Zurich: The Perfect Itinerary\n\nReady to explore Switzerland’s largest city? Here’s a breakdown of the best things to do in Zurich in two days.\n\nNote: Be sure to check opening days and hours of all destinations before finalizing your itinerary. Many of the museums (including the Swiss National Museum, Le Corbusier House, and Kunsthaus) are closed on Mondays. If you’ll be visiting on a Monday, you may need to adjust your schedule.\n\nDay 1: Swiss National Museum, Le Corbusier House, and Walking Along the Limmat\n\nOn day one of your Zurich travel itinerary, you’ll have a chance to check out two of the city’s most iconic museums. You’ll also get to take a river cruise and walk along the picturesque Lake Zurich – and enjoy plenty of good food and drink along the way.\n\nGrab Breakfast at Babu’s\n\nBefore starting your first day in Zurich, grab breakfast and coffee and Babu’s Bakery and Coffeehouse (the Löwenstrasse location). This was one of my favorite spots for both breakfast and coffee – so much so that I visited twice in my short stay! Babu’s has delicious, top-quality coffee drinks, as well as great pastries and a full breakfast menu (with pancakes, an acai bowl, avocado toast, bagels, hash brown plates, and more). The space is also super cozy and welcoming.\n\nExplore the Swiss National Museum\n\nThe Swiss National Museum (Landesmuseum Zürich) is worth visiting for the ornate, castle-like architecture alone – but any history buff will appreciate the exhibits, as well. The museum covers everything you’d want to know about Swiss culture and history, and has artifacts, art collections, installations, and more from fourth century B.C. up to modern day. It’s a large space, so expect to spend at least two to three hours exploring. Adult tickets are currently 10 CHF, and you can buy them in advance online or at the museum.\n\nGet Lunch\n\nBefore heading on your next adventure, grab a quick lunch near the Swiss National Museum. Here are a few options in the area:\n\nRoots: A fully vegan restaurant with sandwiches, lunch bowls, acai bowls, smoothies, and more.\n\nHoly Cow!: A gourmet burger joint with beef, chicken, and veggie burgers, as well as salads.\n\nSpitz: Spitz is a bistro just outside of the main museum entrance. The lunch menu includes sandwiches, salads, soups, and baked goods.\n\nDo a River Cruise Down the Limmat\n\nAfter lunch, head over to the Zürich Landesmuseum boat station to catch a boat down to the Zürichhorn station. This ride (which is about 25 minutes long) is an activity in itself. You’ll leisurely make your way down the scenic Limmat River and into Lake Zurich, taking in the beautiful views of the city and the surrounding area.\n\nBoats depart from the Zürich Landesmuseum station every half hour. This one-way ride costs 3.10 CHF, but check the website for the most up-to-date info. You can buy tickets in advance online if desired, but you can also just purchase once on the boat.\n\nNote that the boats run April through October. If you’re visiting Zurich outside of this timeframe, an alternative option is to take tram 4 from the Bahnhofquai/HB transit stop down to the Höschgasse transit stop (this will take about 10 minutes). This stop is a 5-minute walk from Le Corbusier House.\n\nHelpful Tip: If you want to see routes, check timetables, and buy tickets for public transportation throughout the city, you can use the ZVV (the Zurich Transport Association) timetable tool online! It’s easy to use, and is a great resource for making sense of the transportation options.\n\nCheck Out Le Corbusier House\n\nThe picturesque Pavillon Le Corbusier (also known as Le Corbusier House) was completed in 1967, and was the very last design of Swiss architect Le Corbusier – and his only building to be made of steel and glass. It is now a museum dedicated to his work. As you stroll through the building, you’ll not only admire the architecture itself, but will also have the chance to see drawings, paintings, writings, and other pieces by Le Corbusier, as well as photos of some of his other designs. Adult tickets are currently 12 CHF (but check the website for current information), and can be bought in person. Admission is free for those under 16, as well as for those with a Swiss Travel Pass.\n\nLimmat River Cruise (left) and Le Corbusier House (right)\n\nWalk Along Lake Zurich and Grab Coffee\n\nOnce you finish up at Le Corbusier House, it’s time to make your way back towards Old Town (or Altstadt) Zurich, which is the heart of the city. I highly recommend walking along the lake for at least part of the journey (or the whole journey if you’re up for it – it’s about a mile and a half walk from Le Corbusier to the next stop). There’s a great walking path right along the water that is clean and picturesque, and that passes by plenty of beautifully landscaped park areas.\n\nYou can also stop for coffee along the way if you’d like. Maison 33 Cafe & Bistro is a cozy coffee shop right by Pavillon Le Corbusier, and is a great place for a drink and a pastry. You can also grab coffee and a snack at MAME, a modern coffee shop a bit further up the road.\n\nIf you’ve had enough walking for the day (or the weather isn’t in your favor), you can also head back to the Höschgasse transit stop and take tram 4 back to the city (the Rathaus stop is a good central spot). There are a handful of other transit stops north of Höschgasse along Seefeldstrasse as well, so you can walk part way along the lake and then catch a tram for the rest of the journey. Alternatively, you can take the boat from the Zürichhorn boat station up to the Zürich Storchen station. Whether you take the tram or the boat, you can use the ZVV tool linked above to help you plan your trip.\n\nGrab Drinks at Widder Bar\n\nNext, it’s time for some pre-dinner drinks at Widder Bar, located on the west side of Altstadt in the Widder Hotel. While hotel bars don’t always have the best rap, this cozy bar – which has a huge selection of whiskeys and other spirits – is well worth the visit. If you’re a whiskey lover, you’ll enjoy one of the many whiskey flights, each of which includes three to four different whiskeys. Widder Bar also offers plenty of delicious whiskey cocktails, as well as wine and drinks made with other spirits for those that aren’t whiskey fans.\n\nEnjoy Dinner in the City\n\nAfter drinks, it’s time to end the night with a delicious dinner. Here are a few options in the area I recommend:\n\nHaus Hiltl: For a spot with a really cool history (and equally as amazing food), check out Haus Hiltl – the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the world. This spot (which has been in operation since 1898) can be enjoyed by vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike. I had a delicious vegan bratwurst with rösti (one of my favorite dishes of my trip), but the extensive menu has dishes from all over the world. They do have a buffet option, but I recommend making a reservation for the a la carte restaurant.\n\nVeltlinerkeller: If you want to enjoy a classic Swiss fine dining experience, head to Veltlinerkeller, which has a history that dates back to 1325. The cozy, wood paneled restaurant specializes in Swiss cuisine, making it the perfect option for anyone looking for a traditional meal.\n\nHaus Hiltl (left) and Widder Bar (right)\n\nDay 2: Churches, Kunsthaus, and Lindenhof\n\nOn the second day of your Zurich itinerary, you’ll see some of the iconic Zurich churches, and will also continue to explore the beautiful Old Town area.\n\nNote: If you’re doing your Zurich 2 day itinerary over a weekend, I recommend switching the days and doing this itinerary on the first day, and the day 1 itinerary on your second day. Grossmünster doesn’t open until the afternoon on Sundays, and as we’ll discuss below, it’s best to start the day there to avoid crowds.\n\nGrab Breakfast at Cafe Henrici\n\nI absolutely loved Cafe Henrici, and think it’s the perfect spot to grab breakfast before exploring the city. It’s located on a cobblestone street in the heart of Altstadt, and has a picturesque patio with lovely views of a small square, complete with a fountain and statue. If you’re a coffee drinker, I highly recommend getting their diablo espresso macchiato, which is made with chili, cacao, vanilla, and cinnamon. The spot also serves bagels, acai bowls, overnight oats, pastries, vegan options, and more. They also have a more extensive brunch menu on weekends.\n\nStart the Day at Grossmünster\n\nThe first activity is a stop at Grossmünster – one of Zurich’s most iconic sights. The Romanesque-style church (which was completed around 1220) is perhaps known for the twin towers, which were built around the late 1400s.\n\nBeyond exploring the interior of the church – which includes beautiful stained glass and a crypt with murals from the 14th and 15th centuries – you can also go up Karlsturm, which is one of the towers. After climbing up 187 steps, you’ll get incredible views of the river and the city. Note that part of the stairway is quite narrow, and isn’t ideal for anyone uncomfortable in tighter spaces.\n\nGeneral admission to Grossmünster is free, but it costs 5 CHF per adult and 2 CHF per child to go up the tower. It is cash only, so be sure to have money on hand.\n\nAs you can imagine, Grossmünster is a very popular spot, so I suggest getting there right when it opens to beat the crowds – especially if you want to climb up the tower. You can check the current opening hours online, but as of now, the church opens at 10am every day, with the exception of Sundays, when it opens at 12:30pm after the church service.\n\nIf you do choose to make the climb up the tower, I recommend doing that first, and then exploring church when you come back down. This will help you experience the views before the crowds get to the top.\n\nExplore Kunsthaus Art Museum\n\nAfter checking out Grossmünster, you’ll take a short walk (less than 10 minutes) over to Kunsthaus, one of the biggest art museums in Switzerland. The museum’s vast collection – which includes art from the middle ages to today – features pieces by Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet (including some from his water lilies series), Édouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, and many more. The museum also regularly hosts temporary exhibitions. Expect to spend about one to two hours here.\n\nGet Lunch (and Maybe Some Hot Chocolate!)\n\nAfter getting your museum fix, I recommend stopping by Cafe & Conditorei 1842 for lunch (and hot chocolate if the mood strikes!). It’s just about a 5-minute walk from Kunsthaus. The food and drink alone is great, but what really makes this spot standout is the design. The Baroque-style cafe (which has been in operation since 1842, and is located in a historic building) has a variety of different impeccably designed spaces, including an outdoor terrace and a cozy salon complete with plush, red velvet seating.\n\nCafe & Conditorei 1842 is best known for its baked goods, sweets, and specialty hot chocolates (including some spiked options), but also offers a great lunch menu. It features sandwiches, salads, tarts, and more, and has plenty of vegetarian and vegan-friendly options.\n\nExplore Fraumünster and St. Peter\n\nA Zurich itinerary isn’t complete without a stop by two more of the most famous churches: Fraumünster and St. Peter. Walk over Münsterbrücke (a pedestrian and road bridge) and start at Fraumünster (admission is 5 CHF). This church was originally founded in the 9th century, but has gone through numerous changes since. One of the most iconic sights in the church is the Marc Chagall stained glass, which was installed in 1970. Five vibrant panels depict different biblical stories.\n\nFrom there, make the quick walk up the street to St. Peter, which was originally built in the 9th century. The most recognizable sight is the tower, which features the largest church clock in Europe. Compared to Fraumünster and Grossmünster, the interior of the church is fairly simple (although still beautiful). That said, admission is free, so it’s still worth a peek inside.\n\nCafe & Conditorei 1842 (left image) and Fraumünster (right three images)\n\nStroll Down Bahnhofstrasse\n\nBahnhofstrasse is Zurich’s central shopping street, and also happens to be one of the most expensive shopping centers in the world. You’ll find an abundance of luxury stores like Gucci, Cartier, Chanel, and Dior, as well as more affordable options, such as H&M and Zara. Paradeplatz – a square where Switzerland’s two largest banks are headquartered – is also located on Bahnhofstrasse.\n\nEven if shopping isn’t your thing, the clean, tree-lined street is nice to walk down, and features plenty of beautiful architecture to admire. Shopaholics and non-shoppers alike will also appreciate a stop by Vanini Swiss Chocolate (located right off Bahnhofstrasse on Kuttelgasse) for a sweet treat.\n\nTake in the View from Lindenhof\n\nLindenhof is a park in the heart of Zurich located on top of a small hill, which gives visitors an amazing look of the city and beyond. You’ll get picture perfect views of the Limmat River, Grossmünster, Old Town, and the rest of the cityscape. Fun fact: this park also used to be the site of a 4th century Roman fort.\n\nGrab One Final Dinner in Zurich\n\nEnd your two days in Zurich with a delicious dinner. If you’d like to stay in the heart of the city, you could check out whichever of the day one dinner restaurant recommendations from above you didn’t visit. Alternatively, if you’re willing to explore a bit beyond the center of Zurich, I highly recommend making your way up to Dapur in Oerlikon – a neighborhood in the northern section of the city that is less than a 10-minute train ride from the main Zurich HB transit station.\n\nDapur is a plant-based Indonesian restaurant that everyone (vegan or not!) can enjoy. It was one of my favorite meals while visiting Switzerland! The star for me was the rendang nangka, a complex jackfruit dish made with 21 ingredients. The lumpia (Indonesian spring rolls) was also a perfect starter.\n\nTo get to the restaurant, you’ll want to take a train from Zurich HB to Zurich Oerlikon (there are a few different train options – you can use the ZVV tool to help you plan your trip). Dapur is located right by the station.\n\nAdditional Things to Do in Zurich\n\nWhile you can see a lot in Zurich in two days, there of course are still plenty of other activities if you have additional time. Here’s what I recommend adding to your extended itinerary.\n\nVisit the Lindt Home of Chocolate\n\nThe well-loved Lindt museum is a bit out of the way (it’s located south of the city, but is easy to get to by train), which is why I ultimately decided not to include it in my two day itinerary. However, if you’re a chocolate lover, it’s definitely a spot you’ll want to check out. Lindt Home of Chocolate offers a variety of different self-guided and docent led tours, as well as classes. And yes – you’ll get to enjoy plenty of tastings. Note: the museum does recommend that you book your tickets in advance due to high demand.\n\nExplore the University of Zurich Botanical Garden\n\nIf you want to get your nature fix while visiting Zurich, check out the University of Zurich Botanical Garden. The garden has beautiful grounds with around 7,000 plant species to admire, as well as three tropical greenhouses. Since these are covered, the garden is a particularly great spot to check out during rainy weather. Best of all, admission is free, making it an excellent activity for anyone looking for free things to do in Zurich.\n\nCheck Out ​​Predigerkirche\n\nAnyone particularly interested in historic churches should also stop by ​​Predigerkirche – one of the four main churches in Zurich (along with the three included in the itinerary above). The Romanesque-style church was built in 1231, and admission is free.\n\nVisit the Beyer Clock and Watch Museum\n\nIn the basement of the Beyer Watches & Jewels shop on Bahnhofstrasse is the store’s museum, which is dedicated to the history of clocks and watches. You’ll see rare antiques (some that even still operate), and learn about timekeeping from as far back as 1400 BC to modern day. Adult tickets are currently 10 CHF, and you can buy them in advance online.\n\nWhere to Stay in Zurich\n\nThere are plenty of great hotels in Zurich, including the following:\n\nHotel City Zürich: I stayed at Hotel City Zürich during my most recent visit, and have nothing but good things to say! The boutique 3-star hotel is clean and modern, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. More importantly, it’s very conveniently located in Old Town, within walking distance of Bahnhofstrasse.\n\nAmbassador Hotel Zürich: Those looking for a luxury option can’t go wrong with this 4-star hotel. The Ambassador Hotel has an incredible location – it’s just a block from Lake Zurich, and a quick walk from Old Town.\n\nHotel Motel One Zürich: This well-rated 3-star hotel is modern and comfortable, and is a great option for those looking for a slightly more budget-friendly hotel (or as budget-friendly as you can get in the area!) that is centrally located.\n\nIs Zurich a Walkable City?\n\nZurich is a super walkable city, with plenty of safe pedestrian walking paths. Walking really is the best way to explore the scenic city, so I’d recommend bringing comfortable shoes that are good for walking.\n\nThere are a variety of public transportation options within the city if needed, and I’ll cover some options below when it seems fit. I will note that, when I visited, the only time I used public transportation was to take the boat down the Limmat to get to Le Corbusier House – but that was really an activity in itself!\n\nWhen is the Best Time to Visit Zurich?\n\nIn general, the spring and early summer (April through June) and early fall (September through October) are considered great times to visit Zurich. You’ll likely get pleasant, mild weather during these times (which is ideal, since you’ll be doing plenty of walking). That said, Zurich does get its fair share of rain in the spring and summer, so be prepared and be sure to keep an eye on the weather before you head out each day. You also won’t experience the biggest influx of tourists during these times. July and August can still be great times to visit – just be ready to battle more crowds!\n\nDuring my visit, I was there in late June. The weather was around the high 60s and low 70s, and it was pretty much completely sunny and clear (besides a quick rain storm that came through towards the end of my visit). While there were some crowds, it didn’t feel uncomfortably cramped at all.\n\nDo They Speak English in Zurich?\n\nEnglish is widely spoken in Zurich, so you shouldn’t run into too many issues (if any at all!) while exploring the city. During my Switzerland visit (which included stops in Lauterbrunnen and Murren, as well as Lucerne), I never had any trouble communicating with others. Of course, it’s still a good idea to learn a few Swiss German phrases!\n\nZurich Packing List\n\nBeyond the basics, here are a few key things you’ll want to bring for your Zurich visit:\n\nGood Walking Shoes: As I’ve mentioned, getting around Zurich by foot is one of the best ways to see the city. This means you’ll want to bring along supportive shoes that will keep your feet comfortable as you explore.\n\nRain Jacket and Umbrella: Even if rain isn’t in the forecast when you’re packing, it’s a good idea to at the very least bring along a lightweight rain jacket. Zurich gets plenty of rain, and the forecast may change! If you need a new rain jacket, I recommend the Eddie Bauer Women’s Cloud Cap Rain Jacket and the Eddie Bauer Men’s Cloud Cap Rain Jacket.\n\nSunscreen: You’ll be spending lots of time outside as you’re adventuring through the city and walking from activity to activity, which means you’ll need plenty of sunscreen. Two of my favorite face sunscreens are the EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 and the Sun Bum Original SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Lotion (which is more affordable than the EltaMD product). For the body, I love the Supergoop Play SPF 50.\n\nPlanning the ultimate Switzerland vacation?
