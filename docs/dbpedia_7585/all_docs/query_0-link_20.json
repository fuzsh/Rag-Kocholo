        "text": "A complex picture of past climate trends\n\nFrom 1980 to 2018, 2 m air temperature from the bias-corrected WRF data shows a basin-averaged increase of 0.016 °C year−1 in the Rio Santa and 0.018 °C year−1 in the Vilcanota-Urubamba (Fig. 1b), with statistical significance over most areas. These values are in-line with recent trends over Peru10. The high-resolution WRF data, however, allows us to determine spatial trends in new detail, and we find that over the higher elevation areas of the Rio Santa, the temperature rise has been smaller than in the lower areas, and is not statistically significant (Fig. 1b). In the Vilcanota-Urubamba, there is ubiquitous and statistically significant warming (Fig. 1b). From September to February, the Urubamba region in the north has warmed at a faster rate than the Vilcanota region in the south-east (Supplementary discussion section 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). This is likely to have contributed to the increased glacier decline in the Urubamba region compared to the Vilcanota in recent decades31.\n\nPrecipitation increased over the Rio Santa by an average of 3.1 mm year−1 between 1980 and 2018 according to the bias-corrected WRF data, but the increases are only statistically significant over the south-west of the region (Fig. 1b). In the Vilcanota-Urubamba, precipitation has increased in the north of the basin, around the Cordillera Urubamba, and decreased in the south, but with no statistically significant trends when considered annually (Fig. 1b). In September-October-November (SON) there is statistically significant drying over some glacierised regions of both the Rio Santa and the Cordillera Urubamba, as well as in the south of the Vilcanota-Urubamba Basin (Supplementary discussion section 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The combination of a particularly large increase in temperature and a reduction in precipitation in September-October-November, which is the end of the dry season (Supplementary discussion section 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), is likely to have been particularly damaging to the glaciers, which have the lowest snow cover and therefore lower albedos at this time. A drying trend during the start of the wet season may also lead to agricultural changes, as September rainfall is important for crop sowing32.\n\nThere is good confidence in the past changes presented, as the correlation coefficients between the WRF data and the observations are high. They average 0.83 for the stations around the Rio Santa and 0.85 for the Vilcanota-Urubamba for monthly precipitation, and 0.78 (0.69) for the Rio Santa and 0.92 (0.74) for the Vilcanota-Urubamba for minimum (maximum) daily temperature, averaged monthly. The bias-correction substantially reduces the average root mean square error between the WRF data and the observations. This comparison, and a comparison with other gridded temperature and precipitation products, is shown in Supplementary methods section 2.1.1 and Supplementary Fig. 3.\n\nA warmer, wetter future with increasing glacier melt\n\nBoth the Rio Santa and the Vilcanota-Urubamba regions will experience substantial warming until 2100 under both the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 emissions scenarios based on the output from the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models, but with a clear divergence in trajectories between scenarios (Fig. 1c). By the late 21st century (2062-2100), maximum daily temperature increases of 3.6 °C and 4.1 °C in the Rio Santa and Vilcanota-Urubamba are projected under RCP8.5, compared to the recent past control period (1980–2018) (increases are of 1.9 °C and 2.2 °C under RCP4.5 (Table 1)). The rises in the minimum daily temperature are similar to those in the maximum daily temperature. The maximum and minimum daily temperature increases are statistically significant across all statistically downscaled CIMP5 models in both time periods and RCP scenarios (Table 1).\n\nAnnual precipitation will increase by 12.1% (123 mm year−1) in the Rio Santa and 12.2% (118 mm year−1) in the Vilcanota-Urubamba by the late 21st century under RCP8.5, and 5.8% (59 mm year−1) in the Rio Santa and 5.3% (52 mm year−1) in the Vilcanota-Urubamba by the late 21st century under RCP4.5 (Table 1, Fig. 1c). There is variation between the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models, with a standard deviation of 11% in the Rio Santa and 9.3% in the Vilcanota-Urubamba, under RCP8.5 by the late 21st century.\n\nImportantly, the increasing precipitation shown here for the Vilcanota-Urubamba is in contrast to ref. 24, who suggested that increasing westerly winds at 200 hPa are likely to cause a reduction in precipitation over the Central Andes (including the Vilcanota-Urubamba region). While the correlation between high-altitude westerly winds and precipitation is well established for the present24,33,34, regional climate models over South America suggest mixed trends over the Peruvian Andes in the future, with a rise in precipitation over most of the country35, but with insufficient spatial resolution to determine trends for these two regions. Here we show that almost all the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models project an increase in precipitation in both regions by the late 21st century, with over half showing a statistically significant increase (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 8, 9).\n\nThe projected changes in temperature and precipitation will have important consequences for glaciers and water resources. Using the future precipitation and temperature changes from the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models, we determine the potential effect on the glacier mass balance at the five on-glacier weather station sites (located in the Rio Santa and Vilcanota-Urubamba) studied in36. Under RCP8.5 by the late 21st century, the rate of mass loss more than doubles at all five sites, with the current accumulation found at the summit of Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Vilcanota-Urubamba, the highest site, changing to substantial mass loss (from +0.925 m we year−1 (metres water equivalent per year) to −1.875 m we year−1) (Fig. 2). Under RCP4.5, the increase in mass loss is smaller at all glaciers, but in no future time period or RCP scenario are the increases in precipitation sufficient to prevent an increase in the rate of glacier mass loss (Supplementary discussion section 1.2, Supplementary Fig. 2 and ref. 36 for details). Increased glacier shrinkage can heighten the risk of GLOFs (glacier lake outburst floods), and will reduce runoff in the dry season, exacerbating current water scarcity8,17.\n\nThe greatest uncertainty in the future projections is in the different trends from the CMIP5 models themselves, and arises from a combination of model uncertainty, emissions scenario uncertainty and internal variability37. However, the robustness in the sign of the change from the large ensemble of model projections used here indicates the consistency of these results. The statistical downscaling method used here, quantile delta mapping, is designed to preserve the original trends in the CMIP5 models at all quantiles29, but correct the magnitude of temperature and precipitation, and the number of wet days, based on the bias-corrected WRF data. The choice of control period influences the magnitude of the future changes, but the increasing temperature and precipitation trends are consistent across all control periods tested (starting from 1950), see Supplementary methods section 2.2.1.\n\nAmplified heavy precipitation and warm spells\n\nA key finding of this work is that heavy precipitation will increase at a much higher rate than total precipitation (Fig. 3a–c). Average precipitation on wet days (calculated using the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII, see methods) and spatially averaged over the domains) shows a statistically significant increase in 23 of the 30 statistically downscaled CMIP5 models by the late 21st century under RCP8.5, with the median year in each period (averaged over all the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models) increasing from 6.3 mm day−1 in the control period to 7.1 mm day−1 between 2062 and 2100 in the Rio Santa annually, an increase of 12.7% (Fig. 3a). In the Vilcanota-Urubamba, 27 of the 30 statistically downscaled CMIP5 models show a statistically significant increase from 6.2 mm day−1 to 7.0 mm day−1, an increase of 13.0% (Fig. 3a). No models show a statistically significant decrease in simple precipitation index in either region. Importantly, however, total precipitation falling on heavy precipitation days (95th percentile from the control period, (R95pTOT, see methods)) is projected to increase substantially more than average precipitation (Fig. 3c). These increases are largest under RCP8.5 in both regions, with precipitation under this scenario from very wet days in the median year by the late 21st century (276.0 and 262.7 mm in the Rio Santa and Vilcanota-Urubamba, respectively) about 75% higher than the median year amounts for the control period (158.4 and 149.0 mm). Under RCP4.5, these increases are about 30% by the late 21st century. The number of dry days in the year (and seasonally) does not show any substantial change in either region or scenario, with a maximum of 4 out of 30 models showing a statistically significant increase (Fig. 3b), indicating that these changes are due to increasing precipitation on wet days, rather than an increase in the number of wet days. All the precipitation indices show substantial interannual variability, with overlap between the two scenarios.\n\nThe monthly maximum temperatures (TXx) will rise substantially, slightly over the average temperature increases (Table 1), from a median of 15.3 °C in the control period to 19.1 °C under RCP8.5 by the late 21st century in the Rio Santa, and from 15.6 °C to 19.8 °C in the Vilcanota-Urubamba (Fig. 3d). Rising temperatures lead to a large increase in warm days (calculated using the warm spell duration index (WSDI, see methods)), and a decrease in the number of frost days per year (Fig. 3e, f). The number of days per year within warm spells increases from 10.9 (5.7) in the Rio Santa (Vilcanota-Urubamba) in the control period to 171.0 (172.8) by the late 21st century under RCP4.5, and 287.8 (306.8) under RCP8.5, meaning that almost every day of the year is projected to be in the top 10% of 1980–2018 days, with consistency in sign across models. The median number of frost days per year (FD) is projected to reduce by around half, from 115.7 and 131.0 days (1980–2018) to 73.5 and 88.7 (64.0 and 79.4) days, under RCP4.5 (8.5) by mid-century (2022–2060), in the Rio Santa and Vilcanota-Urubamba, respectively (Fig. 3f). By the late 21st century, under RCP8.5, there will only be a handful of frost days per year, with a statistically significant decrease in all statistically downscaled CMIP5 models.\n\nThe increase in extreme precipitation is likely due to a shift in the distribution of precipitation intensity, such that a greater proportion of days are above the 95th quantile of the control period. In addition, although the Clausius-Clapeyron equation suggests an increase of approximately 7% in atmospheric water vapour for every 1 K of warming, precipitation has been shown to increase at a much smaller rate38. This is consistent with our results, which show precipitation increases of 12% for around 4 K of warming. However, extreme precipitation events, which are typically short-lived, are able to follow Clausius-Clapeyron scaling to its maximum extent. This implies, as is shown in these results, increases in heavy precipitation many times larger than the average precipitation increases.\n\nExtreme rainfall is the most frequent cause of climatic natural hazards such as floods and landslides39,40,41. Andean farming communities also report an agricultural risk from heavy rains, which can wash away soil and destroy crops32. In addition to the effects of heavy precipitation, the decrease in frost days and increase in warm spells found in this study are likely to influence agricultural practices in these regions in the future. While the decrease in frost days may be beneficial to some crops grown in the Andes, others will either have to be sown at a different time of year, or replaced with different varieties32,42,43,44.\n\nFuture droughts projected to increase due to evapotranspiration\n\nMeteorological droughts in the two study regions are expected to increase in the future based on the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, see methods), i.e., when potential evapotranspiration is accounted for45. SPEI is projected to decrease (indicating a long-term drying trend) over both regions and both RCP scenarios (Fig. 4c, d). The rising future temperatures discussed above (Fig. 1, Table 1) are reflected in a considerable increase in the number of drought months, by over 50% from 110.2 out of 457 months in the control period 1980–2018 to 172.3 out of 457 months by the late 21st century 2062-2100, in the Vilcanota-Urubamba under RCP4.5. In the Rio Santa, the increase is just under 50%, from 96.1 to 134.6 months (Table 2). Under RCP8.5, the average number of drought months will almost double in both regions, to 174.0 in the Rio Santa and 211.3 in the Vilcanota-Urubamba by the late 21st century. These changes are seen across most of the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models, with around two-thirds or more of the models projecting increases in drought months under both RCP scenarios in both regions by the late 21st century (Table 2).\n\nImportantly, this increase in droughts is not apparent when analysing droughts from precipitation only using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI, see methods)46, which shows increases in both regions and for both RCPs (Fig. 4a, b), i.e. reduced meteorological drought events, reflecting the increasing trends in average precipitation (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the spatially-averaged number of drought months calculated using SPI is predicted to decrease considerably in both regions, with most statistically downscaled CMIP5 models showing a decrease in both regions by the late 21st century under RCP8.5 (Table 2). While using potential evapotranspiration can lead to an overestimation of future drought compared to actual evapotranspiration47,48, these contrasting results highlight that evapotranspiration plays a particularly important role in this part of the Andes and is essential in projections of future drought.\n\nMeteorological drought is considered the leading cause of drought26, and water scarcity is already reported by local populations in both the Rio Santa and Vilcanota-Urubamba basins49. There is an increase in the inter-annual variability of precipitation in 22 of the statistically downscaled CMIP5 models for the Rio Santa and 25 statistically downscaled CMIP5 models for the Vilcanota-Urubamba, by the late 21st century under RCP8.5 (Supplementary tables 8 and 9). The greater variation in precipitation, along with intensifying evapotranspiration, is likely to increase both very wet and very dry months, and may be caused by increases in El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability50.\n\nIt should be noted that here potential evapotranspiration is estimated using a relatively simple formula, and that estimated potential evapotranspiration can be greater than actual evapotranspiration during periods of low precipitation. A full hydrological model would be needed to project future hydrological droughts.\n\nWhich future for the Andes?\n\nHere we find a complex picture of past and future changes in the Andes of Peru, with the projected joint occurrence of both increased droughts and extreme precipitation. Further work is now needed for hydrological and societal modelling to determine the impact of meteorological droughts on hydrological changes, livelihoods, agriculture and hydroelectric power, and to provide scenarios of changes in the combined physical and socio-economic systems that are able to account for the very high variability in climatic changes identified in this study.\n\nGiven the likely glacier mass loss driven by these climate changes, the importance of glacier melt for dry season runoff3 and our predicted increase in drought conditions, these two Andean regions are likely to see enhanced dry season water stress in the future. This would have impacts on agriculture, including the irrigated export agriculture schemes on the Pacific coast fed by runoff from the Rio Santa2 and the farmers in the Andean highlands44,51, as well as ecological impacts (e.g. on wetland habitats52). Increased extreme precipitation may partly replenish groundwater supplies, which are crucial for maintaining river discharge in the dry season, but it would likely also lead to an increase in flooding, with associated economic and human consequences53."
