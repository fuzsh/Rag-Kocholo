        "text": "I have to say, my favorite part of these Tales from the Borderlands episodes are the freeze-frame opening credits, usually showing up after a cold open that lets them pause an action scene or a montage of still images as they move around the space with the various credits superimposed. Kinda like how that Deadpool movie opens, just without Juice Newton's \"Angel of the Morning\". It makes me wish I was better at introducing my own material. Here goes: I played more of this episodic adventure game about the Borderlands and the people in the Borderlands opening a vault. In the Borderlands.\n\nThe game's action-sequences have this odd combination of interactivity and pre-planned choreography, the issue that QTEs were invented to normalize in a video game context all the way back with Dragon's Lair, where you were only ever presented with the Hobson's choice of getting the buttons right or failing in a humorously morbid \"dead end\" (literally, in most cases) and being forced to try again from a few moments back. I think at their best QTEs are meant to provide the illusion that the player is in charge of the movie playing out, and there are definitely times where I find myself drawn in by the artifice. When an indicator appears that demands you tap a button quickly to win a tug of war or crawl through a closing door, it's hard not to get swept up in the moment and start hammering the poor controller. On the other hand, this illusion gets more and more strained the more it gets invoked. I realize Telltale's oeuvre has failure states that go beyond your protagonist getting themselves killed and forcing a restart, which is to say consequences that will stick around for the rest of the game, and yet it's hard to take each batch of the same context-based QTEs seriously. It eventually begins to feel like certain actions are conceived based on the QTE prompt that will pop up to resolve them, rather than the ideal vice versa.\n\nIn TftB's case in particular, however, its meta sense of humor continues to mitigate a lot of this annoyance over contrivances. After spending the whole game hitting left and right to avoid danger in time, one instance near the end of the third episode has an antagonist aiming a gun at you and a prompt appears for you to reflexively roll to one side. He then berates you for expecting to out-roll a bullet, especially as he simply needs to adjust his aim slightly to the side in order to hit you. Of course, there is a sequence just a few moments later where you do exactly that once again with another protagonist/antagonist combo, so whether there were two people writing this script or the game trying to have its Vault and open it too is a contradiction I'm unable to explain away.\n\nThe technical issues, too, are starting to make themselves a little more pronounced. I heard this was one of the major issues people have with Telltale games as a whole, as they continue to tax their extant engine as their stories and action sequences continue to make outlandish demands from it. There's a keen sense that the writing in these games - which is usually pretty excellent - is stifled by the format, in much the same way it might be a traditional adventure game that requires the game pause its narrative flow to give players a puzzle to solve in order to progress (figuratively, in an old point and click graphic adventure; literally, in the case of Professor Layton). I've seen how relying on the same engine game after game can be a problem in other long-running series, most notably Assassin's Creed, where the company's money people erroneously feel that the cheap option of a recycled engine is perfectly capable of handling every new instance or idea the writers and designers can throw at it. What often happens instead is that the engine buckles under the weight of feature creep, and we see lots of bugs and systems that aren't working like they're meant to.\n\nI can give you one instance of this type of bug early on in the third chapter of Tales from the Borderlands. There's a sequence where you're moving down a hall with Rhys and Fiona while a turret vacillates on its automatic path, the idea being to move ahead when the turret's momentarily paused at the terminus of its horizontal sweep and is facing away from you. Rhys is in front of Fiona, so every time you say to \"go!\" as the latter, he moves one space ahead and Fiona occupies the space he was just in. He reaches the room at the end first and gets jumped by a goon, and suddenly there's a time limit for Fiona to get past the turret and charge in there to save him. Apparently, there was another sudden prompt as she moves into the room to complete the rescue, and I missed it: however, instead of seeing a failure scene, I was unceremoniously booted back to the beginning of the hallway sequence, only now Rhys was already going mano-a-mano with his bandit attacker in the next chamber. Every time I told him to \"go\", he'd suddenly switch back to moving from behind a crate, before warping ahead to the next room to get back to his struggle. Took a moment to figure out what was even happening. That was a major \"uh-oh\", but the game is filled with so many minor animation and scene transition bugs that, while it doesn't really hurt the gameplay too much, often serves to break the immersion. Considering how much stock the game puts in railroading you forward through carefully choreographed action scenes, immersion's one of the few strengths a cinematic approach like that has.\n\nBut you know what? I'm still enjoying this game. For as much as Telltale's particular format tends to irk me, it's one of several delivery methods modern adventure games are figuring out how to tell stories, and I figure the more of those we have the better. Narrative-focused games are starting to open up in a lot of interesting ways, with varying degrees of interactivity, and it's been curious to watch how storytellers approach the video game medium with as much or as little traditional gameplay elements as they feel are necessary. Scott Benson, co-creator of Night in the Woods, tweeted something obvious about narrative-focused video games that didn't occur to me until that moment, in that video game storytellers don't actually choose video games as the medium for a story they have in mind, but instead conceive stories for the medium they know best; a small but important distinction. It's telling that we don't really have a whole lot in the way of a \"video game screenwriter\" role, because in order to effectively tell a story in a video game you need the expertise to know how video games are conceived and directed. A movie or TV screenwriter prospers more when they have a keen sense of cinematography and on-screen aspects like mise en scène that would benefit a tale told in that predominantly visual medium, and with video games all of those visual standards apply and more besides. I don't mean to get off on a tangent here - we're getting a lot of hot takes based on a certain video game critic's latest article on the purpose of stories within video games, and I don't mean to add to that maelstrom when I've clarified my own position in many previous pieces I've written on off-beat adventure games like this. I do think we're on the cusp of finally figuring it out, however, or at least closer to the epiphany that there's a surprisingly varied amount of ways to effectively tell a story within an interactive format.\n\nSo yes, I will continue to cover this game for one more of these \"Indie Game of the Week\" articles at least. I have an idea about how I might supplement the rundown for the last episode, since it's only going to be half as long otherwise. For now, four episodes in, I can continue to recommend this game as a decent realization of this universe and its madcap gallows humor sensibility without necessarily having it revolve entirely around loot RPG gunplay and obnoxious memes.\n\n(We're once again spoiler-blocking these individual episode recaps for the sake of those who have yet to complete them. Oh, and you can catch up with my thoughts/choices on the previous episodes over here.)\n\nEpisode 3: Catch a Ride\n\nFortunately, it hasn't been so long that I've forgotten what was happening, and the episode conveniently begins with a catch up anyway (though, curiously, one that only covers the second episode - normally a TV show would plumb the entire series thus far for relevant expository clips). With his friends in peril and the enigmatic \"Gortys\" Vault-seeking sphere in his hands, Rhys has just risked it all on Fiona's plan of tossing a flashbang grenade up in the air and improvising, and it works well enough. In the process of escaping the Atlas facility the previous episode saw us infiltrate, there's a lot of sneaking around turrets and surreptitiously taking out August's and Vasquez's hired goons (though really, as we'll find out in a moment, they belong to the \"Queenpin of Crime\" Vallory).\n\nSpeaking of whom, we quickly meet two new characters after emerging from the facility relatively unscathed: Gortys, who is actually an overly chipper robot, and Vallory, the hesitantly spoken-about crime lord who has been pulling the strings of several of our foes. Due to a split decision on who to blame for our troubles so far - either Felix, August or Vasquez depending on who've you been most slighted by - Vallory abruptly murders them in a show of strength that felt less like a statement of \"whoa, check out how dangerous this person is\" than a passing of the reins from whoever you perceived to be your biggest adversary in order to place herself firmly in that role. Maybe unnecessary, given her actions to follow, but introductions are important enough to establish a character. In fact, you get to make an impression the first time you meet her in a decision I'll get around to later with the usual \"this many people did this\" post-episode results splash screen rundown.\n\nAfter this, the scary mercenary Athena rushes in to save you and patiently explains she was also trying to save you from Vallory and her goons - Finch and Kroger, making a return in this scene - back in Hollow Point and was hired by Felix to look after the con artist pair until they uncover the vault. Given how much we trust Felix at this point, this could either be an adoptive father looking out for his girls in absentia, or a means to have an agent in place to swoop in and snatch the loot when they finally do find it. The opening credits then ensue, as we follow Gortys' directions to find the next part of her robotic body. We'll need the whole thing if Gortys is going to help us find the vault, and that's as good an excuse as any to go on a scavenger hunt.\n\nThe next and most significant part of the episode, at least in terms of how much of its runtime is spent here, takes place in an Atlas biodome, which is where we can find Gortys' \"energy chassis\". We meet a reclusive scientist, who cures poor Vaughn from the paralysis he incurred back in the opening action scenes. The game's clearly still figuring out what to do with Vaughn, since he doesn't serve much of a role beyond tech geek (he's comic relief too, but then so is everyone) and I was worried he'd get sidelined for the whole episode. We're not entirely copacetic with this mysterious stranger just yet, but for now we have bigger fish to fry: the part we need is kept under heavy security, and the security tower will need Rhys and his eye scanner doodad to operate, so the group splits up into three teams: Fiona and Athena head towards the Gortys part, Rhys and Sasha make their way to the security tower, and Vaughn and the robots stay back in the biodome's living quarters to recuperate and collect information.\n\nThis chapter feels like a \"getting to know you\" episode, expanding on the interpersonal relationships of its characters. Rhys and Sasha's feels vaguely romantic at this juncture; something that was sparked by their uneasy friendship under the bandit base back in episode one and moving ahead here, as the duo marvel at the jungle-like atmosphere beneath the dome and a tense-but-humorously-not-really scene with a collapsing bridge. They get into some trouble with some floating jellyfish animals, and are able to shut down the automatic turrets in time before getting chased out by the creatures. Fiona and Athena's segment, however, provides something of a burgeoning teacher/student relationship as Athena instructs Fiona on how best to survive as a Vault Hunter. We're introduced to Fiona as a fast-talking conwoman who relies on her charm and wiles, but most of what she's been forced to do so far is shoot people with her tiny elemental Derringer while leaping around acrobatically. A forced fracas with an elemental carnivorous plant is sufficient to give Fiona the confidence she needs to become a true Vault Hunter (it didn't occur to me until this episode, which regularly refrences Athena as a former Vault Hunter, that she was a playable character in a former game - in particular, the Pre-Sequel, which I've not played. I take offense at its stupid name, for one, since it clearly indicates none of the writers know what a prequel is).\n\nInevitably, after the part is collected, a few new troubles emerge. The first is the result of finding out that the stranger is an Atlas scientist, and Athena's still sworn to hunt down and kill every Atlas employee due to her tragic backstory which I'm sure got more play back in the specific Borderlands game she hails from. I talk her out of it, but immediately after that we get attacked by Vallory's forces. She was smart enough to bring a couple of Vault Hunters to neutralize Athena, who is the only person in our party who really knows what she's doing in a combat situation (or any situation, really), and we get a few more action sequences before the episode ends with both our heroes captured, Vaughn missing, an unconscious Athena getting dragged away by Vallory's Vault Hunter ringers - BL1's Mordecai and Brick, who I'd have been happier to see in more auspicious circumstances - Loader Bot with even more damage, and everything very much in the air for the next episode. Let's talk about those decisions!\n\nFiona: The Athena/Cassius choice was probably contentious because it relied on whether you had played the Pre-Sequel or not. I'm sure if you had, Athena's fury would've been more justified and you'd let her go through with it. I'm more the conciliatory sort, which is why I also let Vallory help Fiona up. We weren't sure where she was at with us specifically, and for a while it looked like we could smooth things over. It appears, however, that the game has other plans: she is presently our main antagonist, and we are currently at her mercy. Maybe it wasn't a bad idea to piss her off after all.\n\nRhys: The Jack decision, I feel, might have been the same sort of situation as the Athena one where playing the game that he has a greater role within helps us determine whether or not he can trusted. Since I have played Borderlands 2, I can say \"absolutely not\". That so many did is interesting - I wonder if there's something they know that I don't, since it seems likelier now that Jack's going to keep working on taking over Rhys without his support. The Sasha flower thing means she gets sprayed with the pollen that riles up the jellyfish instead of you, however it's impossible to know that she would eventually pick the flower ahead of time: all you get is the prompt to do it yourself, possibly to give it to Sasha to continue this romantic thread between the two. I missed the prompt entirely because of a distraction, leading to the minority decision here. Last, the decision to not let go of Sasha as you both hang precariously off a walkway was a joke: your character refuses to look down because of his vertigo, so when Sasha intimates that she's going to let Rhys's leg go so that he can hold onto the bridge, the player can make a dramatic refusal to let her drop. Fact is, she's about three feet off the ground, and so are you. I wonder how many more times the game is going to do this. I hope at least once more. (Oh right, I also got Vasquez killed when Vallory asked us who was responsible for the botch job. It's a shame we won't get more Patrick Warburton, one assumes at least, but he was easily the biggest pain in my ass.)\n\nWe'll be back with the Episode 4 rundown... right now.\n\nEpisode 4: Escape Plan Bravo\n\nWell, we're still captured and without an indomitable Vault Hunter to protect us, so we pretty much have to work for Vallory from this point on. Vaughn's disappearance is cleared up by the fact he and Doc Cassius split when the fighting started - another case of the writers having no idea where to slot him in, so he's getting shelved until some big heroic moment that will probably fizzle out midway through. To get to Helios, our next Gortys-related destination, means having to get into space somehow. That means another visit to Scooter - kind of weird he didn't appear at all in the third episode, given his catchphrase is the title - and to Athena's girlfriend Springs, who isn't too happy we allowed her squeeze to get captured. We smoothed things over with a lie or two, and now we're well on the way to Helios with Scooter on board.\n\nMeanwhile, Rhys and Vallory's goons Rocksteady and Bebop (wait... Finch and Kruger) go to Old Haven to pick up Vasquez's body so we can imitate him via the costume changing machine. This has me intensely curious about what might happen if we had let him live - presumably he'd be escorting us to Helios directly and the plan would be a whole lot simpler. Instead, we have chinstrap the mercenary as our untrustworthy back-up, and I doubt he'd be useful up on Hyperion's HQ unless a gun fight were to suddenly break out. Probably will, knowing our luck. If we weren't feeling bad about this decision before, the repeated indignities that happen to Vasquez's body really ramps it up. For one, his face was taken by a psycho, which we then have to peel off the psycho's mask without rousing him from his slumber in what is perhaps the most messed up variant of Don't Wake Daddy I've ever played. After that, we get chased by the psycho we unsuccessfully did not wake up, and the goons shoot him just as he gets close to Vasquez's body, blowing it and the psycho into interchangeable gibs. Guys, I'm not sure Vasquez is coming back.\n\nWell, all right, he's coming back in spirit. Rhys will be incognito as Vasquez for the majority of our heist up on Helios, and Fiona and Sasha will be joining him as Hyperion corporate drones. We'll also be carrying Finch, Kruger and August up with us, as well as Scooter, so I'm not sure why only half of us are bothering with disguises. The rocket ride up is uneventful, but for one casualty: Scooter, who gets his hand caught in a faulty engine and jettisoned into space. I sort of suspect that, even though the engine did explode in the upper atmosphere, it'll take more than that to take down Scooter. Or the next Borderlands will just have a different vehicles person, like they have done for every game so far. Farewell to the third least funny stereotype on Pandora. (Yeah, we switched hats. Fiona finds another one in her style eventually though, as the in media res framing device is quick to demonstrate. Oh yeah, that's still happening, and we still don't know who the masked kidnapper is either.)\n\nHonestly, the Helios stuff was fairly weak. Rhys!Vasquez just about manages to bullshit his way past security, past a duplicitous Yvette who had been scheming against us with Vasquez this whole time, past the firewall on the Hyperion servers and past a giant finger gun fight with the accountancy division in a really dumb Spaced homage. Fiona, equally adroitly, gets the tour guide pass she needs to reach Handsome Jack's office where the next Gortys piece is being displayed, though her improvisation skills could use some work. Complications means we have to go up through Jack's Mr. Burns style office trapdoor (no sight of Lenny on the way up) to reach the interior, where we finally snag the piece. Yet, tragedy strikes as Yvette captures the two sisters and Handsome Jack finally enacts his plan to get himself downloaded out of Rhys head and into the Hyperion mainframe. He's not too happy we called him a jerk all those times, I suspect. The episode ends on another cliffhanger. Decisions time!\n\nFiona: I suppose \"sticking to the plan\" meant not tossing Scooter's satellite into space despite being from a rival company from Hyperion's. It'd have been a neat way to honor Scooter, by having his advertising satellite get destroyed and us shot by the bad guys for jeopardizing the mission. I also really don't like Scooter much due to being the source of the sheer volume of low-effort hick jokes from Borderlands 1 so, hey, win-win in my book. I didn't let the Handsome Jack fans vaporize themselves on the forcefield blocking Jack's office because I didn't think they'd be stupid enough to keep running in after the first got zorched. Instead, by warning them of the danger she could alleviate any hard feelings between those that survived and herself. Maybe I'm thinking with too much \"real world logic\" than \"Borderlands logic\" though which, you know, fair cop. Looks like the majority also tore down the painting instead of smashing Jack's stupid diamond pony - I had my chance to destroy one of the worst running jokes in Borderlands 2 and didn't take it, so I'll admit to making a mistake here (honestly? I figured Fiona would break her hand on that thing).\n\nRhys: An inconsequential decision to not tell the sisters about Jack in Rhys's head meant that I invented something about a database instead. Given the conclusion of this episode, I probably should've clued them in that something nefarious was going on, but I didn't expect them to believe Rhys. It's not like Vaughn, who knew enough about Hyperion tech and could imagine a scenario where Rhys would have the ghostly ex-CEO of Hyperion constantly hovering around with advice like The Great Gazoo. (Also, and it's weird I just noticed this, 2015's Batman Arkham Knight also had the psychotic comic relief villain pestering the protagonist with mean-spirited jokes the entire run of that game too, huh? Maybe psychological hauntings were just catching.) Talking Yvette down was presumably the alternative to simply zapping her with Rhys's stun rod, and while I'm not happy she turned on us I was interested to find out what her plans were. That's why I wanted to string her along as Vasquez as much as possible. The split on the Hyperion thing was a curious one: post-game, it's clear that the choice would've been made for you either way, but this does tie into what we know about Rhys from the offset. He wanted this; the middle-management position that Vasquez stole from him was merely one step towards this ultimate goal. Yet, wouldn't his time on Pandora with people he trusts have changed him at all? Wouldn't he have realized by now that Handsome Jack was a complete tool? I'd like to think so, so I gave Rhys a backbone for Jack to then abruptly snap. (You could argue that a reformed Rhys would've used Hyperion's resources for good as its new leader, but I think that's just deluding yourself.)\n\nI'm still curious to see how this all ends, and how it ties into where the duo are at in the present with the masked stranger. Escape Plan Bravo was probably the weakest episode so far though, so I'm slightly concerned that Telltale won't stick the landing. I feel like this game relies way too much on the worst narrative elements of BL2, so there's that worry that Handsome Jack - the Jar Jar Binks of this franchise, given the amount of screen time he inexplicably gets and the far greater amount of affection his creator has towards him compared to his popularity with the audience - will completely overshadow the finale as the new chief antagonist. I suppose I'll find out soon enough.\n\nThat'll do it for this week. I'll be back soon to polish off Tales from the Borderlands's fifth and final episode in another IGotW update sometime in May. Be sure to mark your own spoilers in the comments if you have something to add or want to talk about the decisions you made. I'm clearly drifting further and further away from the vox populi, so I'd like to see some rationales from others.\n\n< Back to 16: Severed> Forward to 18: Song of the Deep\n\nWelcome to The Top Shelf, a weekly feature wherein I sort through my extensive PS2 collection for the diamonds in the rough. My goal here is to narrow down a library of 185 games to a svelte 44: the number of spaces on my bookshelf set aside for my PS2 collection. That means a whole lot of vetting and a whole lot of science that needs to be done, ten games at a time. Be sure to check out the Case File Repository for more details and a full list of games/links!\n\nCase File 116: Nautilus's Shadow Hearts: Covenant\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 19/02/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nThere's no denying that the PS2 was a JRPG powerhouse. For its generation, it was the port of call if you had been ensorcelled by the likes of Final Fantasy and wanted to continue exploring rich veins of storytelling predicated upon teenagers saving the world with ridiculous anime hair. That is to say, they would use swords and spells and the like, but do so while also maintaining ridiculous anime hair, not that the hair itself would be saving the... this is all immaterial. My point is, it takes a really special JRPG to get noticed in the crowd, and Shadow Hearts Covenant is one of those rare elites in a saturated market. The sequel to Sacnoth's Shadow Hearts (Sacnoth and Nautilus are the same company, far as I can tell), the sequel expands on the Judgment Ring-enhanced combat and adds more characters and settings and greatly fleshes out all of them to the extent that it feels like it has two whole games' worth of geography and plot to enjoy. I mean, it literally had two DVD-ROMs in the case, so you don't have to take my word for it. More than simply giving the players a double dose of the old Shadow Hearts, however, Covenant is one of those special sequels that was keenly aware of the strengths and the shortcomings of its predecessor and manages to expand on the former while smoothing over the latter. Character models look way better, the soundtrack could be industrially sinister and intense as balls but each track also expertly injects personality into each region and boss they pertain to, the game really gets fun with its 1910s historical cameos (Rasputin! Lawrence of Arabia! The Great Gama!), and you actually get to spend more time with characters that aren't Yuri or the female deuteragonist, where even comic relief side characters like the dog Blanca or Joachim Valentine the frozen-tuna-wielding pro-wrestling vampire (you heard me) get their own massive side-quest chains that lets them have the limelight for a few hours. We begrudge longer games for demanding more of our time unnecessarily, but that's usually because they're ridiculously padded out with recycled or proc-gen content: Shadow Hearts Covenant's 80+ hours of game time are all carefully considered thriller and no filler, packed with so much story and varied incidental content that you wonder if the developers found any time to sleep between the release of this Shadow Hearts and the previous. Also? The last game ended with a battle against an unknowable metaphysical deity from the depths of space, and yet this game gets even weirder. I love it to pieces.\n\nIt's probably too early to put together a list, but Shadow Hearts Covenant is easily within my top five favorite games for the system. It remains one of the most impressively layered and perfectly presented linear JRPGs I've ever played and there's no way it's not an instant top shelf qualifier. Approved.\n\nCase File 117: Atari Melbourne's Transformers\n\nOriginal Release (EU): 25/02/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nTransformers is one of those ubiquitous toy licenses that gets invoked every now and again and this game, which came out long after the initial fandom peak in the 80s but several years too early for the Michael Bay movies, seems to exist only to promote the short-lived Transformers: Armada reboot, which also saw its own animated series and toyline. Tellingly, the intro begins just like the 1986 animated movie with Megatron's all-out assault on the Autobot HQ, only instead of you-know-who taking a fatal shot to the solar plexiglass the game-specific plot suddenly kicks in and both the Decepticons and Autobots suddenly drop everything to go looking for \"Mini-Cons\" on Earth. The game makes these little guys sound like the key to tipping this endless war of robot attrition, and they were a major aspect of the toyline also, but I have to wonder if the two sides wouldn't be better off trying to recruit one of those city-sized Transformers instead of a bunch of small fry. (Incidentally, there is a level in this game based on - and upon - one of those colossal Transformers, and it's pretty sweet.) The game's a fairly standard third-person shooter with some vehicle sections; pretty much what you'd expect from the license, especially if you've played High Moon's Transformers: War for Cybertron or Platinum's Transformers: Devastation. Regardless of how you might feel about Armada's particular handling of the license, it was pretty cool to run around shooting Decepticreeps as Optimus Prime, Hot Rod or Red Alert (who?) in a modern 3D game. In fact, it's the first Transformers game I can think of that wasn't a steaming pile of Junkion.\n\nBut, you know, an OK Transformers game isn't exactly the crème de la crème of what the PlayStation 2 had to offer. Maybe if you were a crazy big Transformers fan, but I can't say I ever was. These days, you'd be better off with either of the examples above if you wanted to get your classic Transformers fandom on with as much distance from pointy Michael Bay's pointy mechstrosities as possible. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 118: Capcom's Onimusha 3: Demon Siege\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 26/02/2004\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (ported to PC)\n\nThis is probably going to sound familiar, but I've not played Onimusha 3. All right, I'm lying a little bit: I rented 3 before ever buying a single Onimusha game and got thoroughly lost. The game not only builds on two games worth of plot (one assumes, though the first two games feature different protagonists) but a whole bunch of elaborate mechanics and systems that were gradually introduced to the series during its lifespan. I barely recall a thing about it, other than it has Jean Reno playing a modern day French detective who is magically connected to a samurai in medieval Japan because apparently Capcom lost their minds at some point. Remember when they created wonderfully crazy material instead of half-finished fighters and remakes of remakes?\n\nObviously this is going on the homework pile along with the second game. I'm thankful I can't remember much, because starting here almost feels like what would happen if Furious 7 was your first movie of that series: it'd still be entertaining as heck, but it would lose something significant without witnessing how the series built up to it. Considered.\n\nCase File 119: Argonaut Games's Malice\n\nOriginal Release (EU): 08/04/2004\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (also out on Xbox)\n\nMalice is the sort of game that badly needs a documentary to figure out what went wrong where. At several points during its troubled development, it was meant to be an Xbox exclusive launch game, a game that featured the vocal talents of the ska (ska-esque?) band No Doubt and Gwen Stefani in particular as the eponymous protagonist, a game that would let you play certain sections as a cat, and a game that threatened to change the face of 3D platformers forever. To that last point, it wouldn't be the first time UK developers Argonaut Games pulled something like that off: they wowed audiences in their home continent with the wireframe 3D space shooter Starglider for Atari ST and Amiga, and then went on to global fame with Nintendo's Star Fox and the Super FX chip for SNES. Dudes were clearly very talented when it came to tech, but the game's pop-punk posturing about a feisty grrl power goddess retaking her world from the vaguely defined \"Dog God\" was... well, the instantly dated early 2000s material that it sounds like. Didn't help that a bunch of delays and publisher switcheroos dropped the game unceremoniously in 2004 after everyone had quietly moved on.\n\nIt is, therefore, another mediocre 3D platformer that I only bought because I really like 3D platformers, you guys. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 120: Gust's Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 27/05/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nI, like many monolingual English-speaking JRPG fans, got my start on Gust's enormous \"alchemies & animes\" Atelier series with the action-RPG Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana. The game introduces a lot of the recurring pillars of the Atelier franchise, which now includes the likes of Atelier Sophie, Atelier Rorona, Atelier Ayesha and Atelier Moxie CrimeFighter, such as its distinctive isometric view (which the games left behind after going fully 3D) and how central the alchemy/crafting is to keeping your party in good stead as far as consumables and equipment goes. Later games would emphasize the alchemy aspect, with gameplay often revolving around farming reagents and collecting recipes for new creations to fulfil the many requests your heroine is given. What seems to get less notice is how incredible the soundtracks to these games are, with beautiful orchestral arrangements for its stages and some rockin' boss tunes. Famous Japanese VGM remixer Saitama Saisyu Heiki, a contemporary to the likes of Jake \"virt\" Kaufman, frequently takes to the Atelier series for inspiration and was commissioned for a couple of arrangement albums. The three Iris games acted as an ideal gateway between the combat- and plot-heavy JRPGs we're accustomed to and the more recent Atelier games, which downplays the conflict and focuses instead on the slice of life adventures of impossibly cute anime girls crowding around cauldrons.\n\nAnyway, I have my favorite Atelier Iris game and it's not the first one. The first is fine, I should clarify, but doesn't quite push the envelope the way its sequel does. Play us out, Deceitful Wings. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 121: Monolith Soft's Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 24/06/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nIn retrospect, expecting to find one's way into this series' Byzantine plot about mechs, gynoids, clones and humanity's place in the universe by starting on the second chapter wasn't the wisest decision. Oh, you thought I was talking about a choice I made? No, try the brilliant decision-makers over at Bandai Namco itself, who elected to release the second episode of the Xenosaga trilogy in Europe but not the first. Instead, us lucky Euros got a bonus DVD with all the previous game's cutscenes, which don't make a whole bunch of sense taken out of context. (I don't actually recall if my copy had that DVD, actually. It may have been pre-owned.) At any rate, even if I could follow what was going on the second chapter is still paced abysmally, something I hear was a problem for Episode II specifically. Expository cutscenes regularly take over for long stretches, and what little game time we have is spent between constantly changing parties and their mechs in a manner that made it feel like I wasn't making any kind of progress, except for helping the overbearing sci-fi plot lurch along.\n\nI'm probably making a mountain out of a molehill here. The pacing and characterization problems might be series-wide, or it could just be an inherent flaw of the second game, or the result of not being familiar enough with the characters and world. Presently, with no easy way to play the first Xenosaga and little motivation to do so regardless, I'm letting this one go. And yes, before you ask, we didn't get Episode III either. Just this one. Boy, I'm sure glad I couldn't get invested in the story. (Don't worry, Xeno fans: the Xenoblade games have completely redeemed this series in my view, and these days Monolith Soft is probably my favorite currently-active Japanese developer. I suspect they're a large part of why Breath of the Wild turned out so well.) Eliminated.\n\nCase File 122: Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 15/07/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that I was so put off by SMT: Nocturne's extreme difficulty that I bought this game and quietly put it away for the end times, when I might finally be prepared for more MegaTen. The two Digital Devil Saga spin-offs have their own rich backstories that essentially combines Shin Megami Tensei's wild and lawless post-apocalyptic hellscape with the virtual worlds of Tron or The Matrix, pitting the player's Cabal cabal against any number of rivals. It gets grisly pretty quick too, as a demonic virus forces everyone to start devouring each other (in a machine code kind of way, one assumes, though there's no telling how that's represented visually within this world) in an effort to be the final surviving gang and reach \"nirvana\". Another major departure is in how the player puts together their party. In standard Shin Megami Tensei games, the player character must supplement their party with recruited demons which they can fuse into more powerful forms, while in Persona your party consists of a group of human characters with demonic alter ego \"personae\" that determine what spells and abilities they have. DDS is a bit more like the latter, as you have a group of NPCs that can each change into their own demonic form, and the player is able to pick and choose new abilities for them via a grid-like character progression screen. I'm not too familiar with how it all works myself but it strikes me that the game was aiming for a slightly more traditional JRPG route, perhaps offsetting Nocturne's complexity a bit. Or it might be twice as complex and I'm unwisely underestimating a Shin Megami Tensei game again.\n\nMy plans for Digital Devil Saga haven't changed - the intent was always to start playing it once Nocturne was done and dusted. Since I'll be revisiting Nocturne fairly soon, a playthrough of this game shouldn't be too far behind. Unfortunately, at this point my odds of finding the sequel at a reasonable price aren't high, so I hope it doesn't end on too big a cliffhanger. Considered.\n\nCase File 123: Capcom's Mega Man X: Command Mission\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 29/07/2004\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (also out on GameCube)\n\nYeah, I guess Capcom did make a Mega Man X RPG. And yeah, I guess this is the only Mega Man X-related video game I opted to buy. I might even go so far to say that both of those choices were mistakes. Command Mission attempted to find a new RPG format for the Blue Bomber after Mega Man Legends crashed and burned because... I guess Capcom didn't want to keep making them? Instead, they put together this perfectly banal turn-based JRPG set deep within the X timeline somewhere. (I can do the smallest amount of due diligence here and tell you that Command Mission was developed between X7 and X8, but I've no idea how it is related to those games, or follows/sets up their events. I wasn't even aware the X series went that high numerically.) I think it's perfectly rational to want to buy a Mega Man RPG because the Legends games were great, and also because it's a PS2 JRPG that was released in Europe which is its own rare and special thing, but I can't say I have any particularly strong feelings about this one.\n\nI'm going to have the invoke the second rule of The Top Shelf, which is that if one genre's getting far too much attention there's little chance the also-rans and so-sos of that same genre are going to rise above the stone cold classics, even I were to revisit them for a refresher. If half my collection of 185 PS2 games are JRPGs, and I'm not saying that isn't likely, then there's no point prolonging the inevitable for serviceable but average games like Command Mission. Time for your everlasting peace, Mega Man. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 124: Konami Tokyo's Suikoden IV\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 19/08/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nAll right, let's talk about Suikoden IV. The black sheep of the Suikoden family, IV wanted to try something a bit different and went for this whole maritime angle that meant they could explore a whole new archipelago region of Suikoden's persistent world and also have all its tactical battles revolve around ships and naval warfare. I'm into the Mediterranean atmosphere of the game, and the decision to set it about hundred years before the other games was a bold one, as it meant it couldn't rely on the cameos and guests (besides the omnipresent Jeane and Viki, of course) and historical references that the previous games would lean on occasionally. Yet, I dunno, it didn't quite all come together in a satisfying way. The world felt smaller, and not just because of the minimal amount of land mass, and with a few exceptions the individual characters within the 108 Stars of Destiny didn't really stand out like they've done in the past. When you consider the way the war slowly shifted to your favor in the tense Suikoden or the labyrinthine plot of political maneuvering and betrayed friendships in Suikoden II (or that fateful final encounter with Luca Blight, for that matter), there's no one arc or moment of Suikoden IV that compares. The game also goes for this sort of slightly washed out look that turned what ought to have been a vibrant Greek/Sardinian aesthetic into something muted and dull. Recalling specific issues I had with the game is challenging a decade plus after the fact, but there was a mild sense of dissatisfaction throughout that I remember very well. I'd also complain that the hero Lazlo was this quiet androgynous weenie, but that goes for pretty much every Suikoden protagonist. God only knows how each of them manages to inspire the loyalty of over a hundred followers. (Lazlo redeems himself a little with a cameo in a certain Suikoden offshoot coming soon to this feature.)\n\nFor various reasons, the third-best PS2 Suikoden will not be making it to the second round. However, I will say this for Suikoden IV: it's got a great opening theme track. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 125: Sega Wow's Blood Will Tell\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 09/09/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nOften, designers struggle to fit a game around a licensed property, especially in the short time frames they're frequently given so that the game's release can coincide with a new TV show or movie. What happens less frequently is when game developers come up with a great idea for a dormant license and bring it back to life. Dororo, an Osamu Tezuka manga that had somehow managed to avoid any video game adaptations despite being 35 years old at that point, was selected for the licensed game treatment for little reason I can find, besides perhaps someone having an epiphany about how they might adapt its grim tale of a Sengoku-era clockwork samurai cutting a swath through a series of manipulative demons with the help of a plucky boy thief. It absolutely works, too. In the manga, the hero Hyakkimaru was magically carved up into pieces as a baby by the supernatural coalition named the Forty-Eight Fiends, who in exchange provided his feudal lord father with all the power he needed to unite Japan. The pitiable deformed infant that remained was sent down-river to perish, only to be found and raised by a compassionate inventor and doctor who built the disfigured child a new mechanical body. In both the game and the book, the child grows into a young warrior packed with mechanical weaponry ready to take down the fiends and reacquire his lost organs and limbs, which is reflected in-game as a steady increase in stats and new abilities after each recovery. The game gets pretty clever with it too: the prologue chapter is entirely in black and white until Hyakkimaru slays the tutorial boss and recovers his left eye, giving him the ability to see the world for the first time. The game has an episodic structure, with the opportunity to come back to any completed chapter once the player has learned a few new traversal-enabling abilities that might lead the way to any number of hidden bosses remaining there. And boy howdy, does the game go the full mile with all the demons Hyakkimaru must destroy: almost every one of the Forty-Eight Fiends involves its own distinct boss fight, though there are a few tougher palette swap repeats. There's also an instance per level where you control Hyakkimaru's young thief companion Dororo instead, which comes with its own challenges.\n\nSince playing the first Onimusha, it's become a little clearer to me where exactly this game came from. The exploratory aspect, the third-person sword combat and prohibitively finite amount of ranged weaponry, the way you'll occasionally backtrack to previous areas for now-accessible paths, and even the sequences where you control the weaker but faster sidekick character. The similarities between the two properties are more than just skin-deep, but Blood Will Tell goes that extra mile with its affecting story that condenses many years of a major manga, its wonderfully strange yet video game compatible premise, and the way it builds itself around multiple clever and tense boss encounters. Man, what a special game. It deserves to be known by more people. Approved.\n\nResults\n\nThe Top Shelf is heating up this week (it's closer to the sun, y'see) with a couple new star players added to the bench. Naught follows in their wake but desolation however, as the hammer comes down on seven unlucky also-rans. Figuratively speaking, at least. We're well deep into 2004 also; these later years are going to start moving quickly as we get closer to the advent of the Xbox 360 and the next generation. I'm going to have to figure out what combination of El Gato equipment and better PC hardware will allow me to LP Blood Will Tell for everyone, as it deserves more recognition. Shadow Hearts Covenant too, for that matter, though that LP might take half a year. I'll say this for this week's The Top Shelf: I had some incredible VGM to enjoy while I was writing this entry up.\n\nWell, as we always say around here: \"Cut the chats, let's bring on the stats!\" (I know, I'm sorry, I'm trying to remove it.) With only two games passing to the next round this week, we're looking at 48 out of 125 games for consideration. However, we're now up to eleven confirmed shelf buddies, which means a full quarter of the shelf is now accounted for! Even so, with only six more of these first round blogs remaining it seems likely there'll be plenty of space left to fight over. Next week is actually a little more platformer heavy, to make up for the JRPG japes of this week, and happens to include my favorite non-Mario platformer of all time. We'll also be singing about beer, hanging out with Eazy-E, and making DreamWorks faces. See you then.\n\n< Back to the Case File Repository\n\nNow this was a pleasant surprise. DrinkBox Studios's Severed shares a lot of similarities with their previous game, Guacamelee!; in particular, both have a very distinct vector-based visual direction inspired by the iconography and vivid colors of Mexican/Central American art, and both involve exploration, puzzle-solving and a combat system that focuses on exploiting weaknesses and managing multiple foes. While Guacamelee delved into the absurd dramas of Lucha Libre in a 2D platforming SpaceWhipper environment, however, Severed is a more somber tale about a young woman's possibly doomed journey to rescue her family from a nightmarish mirror dimension in the style of Orpheus and Eurydice, where every desperate battle in this primal and violent land threatens to rob her of her humanity.\n\nIt's a strange coincidence, given that this game's been out for a year on the Vita (I played the more recent Wii U version, for the record), that I started playing Severed around the time I began watching the excellent new season of Genndy Tartakovsky's Samurai Jack. The powerful, compassionate warrior lost in a realm of nightmares and constant struggle are a close match, sure, but it's more in how both DrinkBox and Tartakovsky create these worlds of harsh angles and brightly colorful backgrounds that are somehow simultaneously simple in form and breathtaking to behold. It's a wonderful use of shape and color that I can't quite elaborate on with my lack of an artistic background, but stripping the silliness and memes of Guacamelee! has really helped that visual style stand out all the more in Severed, as does I suppose putting the game entirely in first-person. Vector graphics haven't won me over in the past - I tend to think they make everything look like a Flash game - but there are a few intermittent examples like Severed that make a strong case for the format.\n\nPlaying Severed, it almost feels like a reimagining of the classic real-time dungeon crawler in the vein of Dungeon Master or, to name a more recent example, the Legend of Grimrock games. You find switches and keys, must figure out how to open doors, occasionally press secret panels on walls to open new exits, and avoid or disable the occasional trap. While movement is four-directional and the dungeons work in a discrete grid-like manner, you have a full panoramic view of every \"square\" in the game, which is needed for both scanning the environment for secrets and items as well as the combat, which often pits you against multiple enemies in every direction. Also, like Guacamelee, an effort has been made to mitigate the amount of searching and backtracking involved: every space on the map is annotated for color-coded doors, secret passages that require an ability you'll find later, and green question marks for secrets which is just vague enough a clue to maintain a level of mystery without the need to scour every wall on every dungeon's floor for hidden switches. The most common rewards for secret passages and those you can only open in a later revisit are health and mana upgrades, so it's worth trekking back to see what's now accessible if you have a boss coming up. The game is happy enough to reserve its difficulty for the battles themselves, and therefore de-emphasizes the \"challenge\" of finding secrets to compensate by clearly marking them all on the map - depending on the type of player you are, especially for this type of game, it may be a decision to be applauded or derided.\n\nSevered's meat and potatoes is its combat. The game is entirely touch-based for these sequences, with the player's finger or stylus representing their sword slashes. Every enemy in the game is susceptible to getting slashed repeatedly with the protagonist's Soul Edge-looking blade, though most require that you finagle their weak points out of hiding first. Some enemies start blocking certain angles from which the slashes might rain down, others require that you eliminate non-crucial targets for the real ones to appear, while others still are simply a matter of timing and waiting for an opportunity. To Severed's credit, they came up with a lot of monster types, and while most get recycled into harder versions they usually have an extra twist to the tale. For instance, about halfway through the game you learn the ability to hold the stylus down to charge attacks, and this becomes necessary to destroy these orange, rocky barriers in the dungeons. Enemies start adopting these rocky barriers also, giving you an extra step to overcome before you can damage them.\n\nThe icing on the cake is how the player harvests organic crafting items, however: each enemy also has a certain amount of limbs and viscera that can be severed from them and collected, but in order to do this you have to build a \"focus\" gauge which climbs higher with successive hits. Spamming enemies isn't enough: the chain is broken if you miss or get blocked, so in order to fill the gauge quickly you must seize upon short moments of vulnerability to get in as many hits as possible. However, going for maximum damage will kill your enemy before the gauge is filled, wasting what pieces you could've harvested from them. Early on in a fight, you learn to use short, less damaging strikes in quick succession to build your focus bar, before switching to longer strikes that cause more damage to eliminate enemies quickly. It's important to defeat enemies fast because you're very rarely attacked by just one: many fights become an act of spinning plates, as you're often pivoting around quickly to deflect enemy attacks from every angle. By removing specific enemies quickly by focusing on them first, you mitigate the amount of damage you might receive, but that also makes it difficult to build the focus gauge in time to harvest them. It's a really smart risk vs. reward dynamic that can be overcome if you're exceptionally fast, but will often involve killing the monster with the least necessary parts first just for the extra breathing room. The parts you acquire can then be spent on upgrading your character, enhancing the damage they do or adding bonuses like siphoning life or causing critical hits. Eventually, the protagonist also learns to blind enemies (temporarily putting them out of service) and consuming their buffs (which removes their buffs and gives them to you) - both of these also have their own skill trees, which means you're always in need of more parts. Mercifully, the game also lets you collect \"giblets\" from breaking vases in the environment which can be transmuted into any type of crafting item, which is a huge godsend when you're a few arms or horns short of the next big upgrade and aren't sure when you'll next fight a monster that drops either. In addition, there are no random encounters in the game and every monster disappears forever once fought; the sole exception is a trap room at the very end which generates a random encounter with each pull of a switch an apparently endless number of times, in case you're still missing some upgrades.\n\nI didn't hear as much effusive press surrounding Severed as I did with Guacamelee, possibly because it was a Vita exclusive for a long while, which is a shame because I consider it a far better game overall. The art is put to better use in a first-person view where it's far more striking and vivid, its serious yet simple story of revenge and losing oneself to one's rage serves the whole Mexican/Central American folklore aesthetic well, the enemies and bosses - while still challenging, especially the end boss - are far more balanced and fair than Guacamelee's with a much better thought out difficulty curve, and deep down the game is still a SpaceWhipper with its emphasis on exploration and backtracking, but also offers something a little more uncommon with its dungeon-crawling first-person format. It's perhaps a game ideal for a portable format, but I enjoyed my time with the Wii U version immensely and I'm psyched to see what Drinkbox will do next if they can maintain this trajectory.\n\nRating: 5 out of 5.\n\n< Back to 15: Tales from the Borderlands E1 & E2> Forward to 17: Tales from the Borderland E3 & E4\n\nWelcome to The Top Shelf, a weekly feature wherein I sort through my extensive PS2 collection for the diamonds in the rough. My goal here is to narrow down a library of 185 games to a svelte 44: the number of spaces on my bookshelf set aside for my PS2 collection. That means a whole lot of vetting and a whole lot of science that needs to be done, ten games at a time. Be sure to check out the Case File Repository for more details and a full list of games/links!\n\nCase File 106: Frontier Developments's Dog's Life\n\nOriginal Release (EU): 10/31/2003\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nFrom the developers of Elite: Dangerous and Planet Coaster comes the most serious, in-depth simulation game of them all: Dog's Life, a game about the life of a dog. I shouldn't need to describe this one in lurid detail, right? It was on a very memorable episode of UPF. In fact, seeing the game in that video is what convinced me to buy Dog's Life and try it out. No, not for the whole pooping and then carrying the poop around in your mouth aspect, but how the game had a collectathon sensibility with its various color-coded odors and bone collectibles. While you don't do much in the way of platforming, it still had the kind of exploratory vibe to it that the older style N64 platformers (and recent revival Yooka-Laylee) exhibited. It's not quite the dog's dinner that it looks: despite some iffy controls and a very unflattering graphical style, there's a wide range of goals for your dog protagonist to pursue. I'm not going to claim this is some hidden gem of the PS2 era, but beyond the scatological dog turd goofs and its weird pointless plot about a woman making cat food out of dog meat, there's some degree of imagination here. They didn't just make a dog-human anthropomorph with a perpetual Dreamworks face and call it a day like so many other mascot platformers would do; the challenges are all built around the idea of the player being a regular-ass dog with the powers of a dog, and that goes a long way towards making the game feel distinct.\n\nDistinct, if not perhaps top shelf worthy. Eliminated. (And yes, I did screw up the date on this one. Hence why it comes after last week's November-themed list.)\n\nCase File 107: Tecmo's Project Zero 2: Crimson Butterfly\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 27/11/2003\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (was released on Xbox and remastered for Wii)\n\nHorror games have never been my forte. Honestly, that goes horror media in general. The idea of eliciting fear as a form of entertainment has always seemed foreign to me, when I've always preferred to be amused or excited or elucidated by the fiction I consume. With games, though, horror media has found its optimal format: there's a lot to be said for a scary movie you can only watch through closed fingers or a terrifying book you can't bring yourself to finish reading, but a video game is instinctual and present in a way other media cannot be. You're not just passively watching some doomed ingénue cautiously stroll towards her demise, you're actively forced to make it happen to continue the game's plot. A locked door, an ominous presence in the distance, a grimoire coursing with eldritch energy: they all wait for you to take that fatal step forward, to do what must be done for the narrative to resume. It makes it much easier to put yourself in that situation, thus magnifying the fear several-fold; to the extent that many of us are apprehensive about the idea of embarking on a VR horror experience, which makes the separation between reality and fiction even less overt. The only issue is that a lot of horror games haven't found a way to properly capitalize on their advantage. I would argue that the second Project Zero game (\"Fatal Frame\" to those in North America, and simply \"Zero\" to the Japanese) is able to come closest to horror game nirvana by not entirely depriving the player of a means of defending themselves, but one that still puts them in constant terrifying peril. The sequel makes a lot of important enhancements to the otherwise fine original, adding a more personal tale of a pair of twins trapped in a cursed village that once performed frequent rituals that forced a twin to murder their sibling and use that uniquely potent level of suffering and despair to keep a yawning pit to the netherworld sated for another decade. The most effectual scares come from the game's dual antagonists: Sae, a twin who botched her own ritual causing the Malice of the underworld to engulf the town and turn her an into an incredibly powerful and irrevocably insane angel of death, and the Kusabi - an outsider tortured nearly to death that was offered to the abyss as an anguished aperitif, who was instead warped by the Malice into a vicious spirit that is almost unrecognizable as a former human. Both are completely indestructible for most of the game, allowing Project Zero 2 to have its normal exorcizable ghost enemies and unstoppable Nemesis-style foes both.\n\nProject Zero 2 was and still is my favorite horror game, despite strong competition from the likes of Frictional Games's Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Soma or the heady metaphysical chills of Konami's Silent Hill. It finds a middle ground for the \"run and hide\" and \"stand and fight\" schism of horror game enemies, has an affecting story that engenders revulsion and compassion alike, looks incredible for the PS2 with its eerie dilapidated traditional Japanese buildings and ghostly special effects, and that central core gameplay conceit of snapping spooks the moment they lunge for an attack is still a brilliantly cruel idea for a combat engine. It might not have the Exclusivity Tilt (if you can find the Wii version, it sounds like that's the one to go for) but there's no way it avoids the shelf, even if it ends up being the only representative of the survival horror genre up there. Approved.\n\nCase File 108: Remedy's Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne\n\nOriginal Release (NA): 02/12/2003\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (originally a PC game)\n\nI don't know what it is, but I didn't enjoy the second Max Payne as much as the first. Maybe it was that the novelty of bullet-time had worn off a little. Maybe it was because I played it almost a decade later and that particular market of cinematic third-person shooters had moved on (though not as much as you might hope). Quite possibly it was because of the game's surreptitious self-adjusting difficulty curve, which like Left 4 Dead subtly made the game harder or easier depending on how well the player was performing, the net result of which simply created a lot of difficulty speed bumps that made you feel inadequate when you'd come back to a tough encounter that previously killed you only to discover that it had been \"softened\" for your sake. Max Payne 2 continues in the noirish direction of the original, adding a requisite femme fatale in the returning (and previously dead) contract assassin Mona Sax and a whole conspiracy thriller plot that is thankfully less fixated on Max's crumbling psyche and hallucinations about crying infants, and for the most part is as competent and entertaining as the original. It just felt a little less fresh overall, though. Well, besides for that difficulty thing, but I suspect the game would've been better off without that.\n\nLike the first Max Payne, my reason for dropping this game is not so much that I'm generally lukewarm towards it but the fact that the PC version seems like the clearly better choice. The bullet-time relies on having an opportunity to line up shots and take out multiple foes in a desperate maneuver, and the keyboard and mouse is better suited for that sort of split-second precision shooting. As the native platform and one already known for its versatility, I might argue that the game is better optimized on PC also. For those reasons and more, it's time for Max Payne to fall from this feature. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 109: Sega Wow's Nightshade\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 04/12/2003\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nThe early 00s were a time of resurgence for the noble ninja, with the triple threat that was the PS2 Shinobi reboot in 2002 (which I rented, but don't remember well enough for one of those post-script shout outs), its spin-off/sequel Nightshade in 2003 and Tecmo's own Ninja Gaiden reboot in 2004. My enduring memories of all three are of the harsh difficulty: in fact, I bounced off all of them at various points long before I could complete them. Of those three Nightshade is the one I remember the least and, ironically, is the only one I own. I remember that it felt a little like one of those bullet-hell shoot 'em ups or a game like Contra, because of the way it combined dizzying speed with evading a lot of attacks in quick succession. Exciting and kinetic, sure, but not the kind of game I had the concentration or dedication to conquer. I also didn't realize until recently that it was developed by Sega Wow (which at various times was also known as Overworks and Wow Entertainment), which is also responsible for one of my favorite JRPGs (Skies of Arcadia, and its GameCube remake) and a beloved lesser-known PS2 game that we'll be seeing... well, next week, in fact.\n\nIt's been a few years since I last booted up the game and while my gaming skills haven't improved in that time - sadly, I fear it's the opposite - I might be curious enough to see if I can't figure it out with a more patient approach. Nightshade's fairly well-regarded among fans of harder, invariably ninja-focused, action games and it probably deserves another chance for recognition/redemption more than the dreck I've been advancing forward lately. Considered.\n\nCase File 110: Sonic Team's Sonic Heroes\n\nOriginal Release (EU): 05/12/2003\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (also out on Xbox, GameCube and PC)\n\nOh boy, this piece of shit. Let me tell you a little story I've titled \"Don't Trust Sonic Fans\". Back when I was pursuing my college degree of, well, let's call it Applied Pointlessness in Game Design, I was compelled to purchase Sonic Heroes by the hype generated for the brand new Sonic game by my small circle of acquaintances within the course. I had fond enough memories of playing through the 2nd and 3rd games for the Sega Mega Drive, as I'm sure did many folk who continue to get suckered by each new Sonic promotional push that promises a return to the golden era of the occasionally golden hedgehog, but had dropped off the series since it went 3D. Fact is, I've never really been a big Sega follower, and only bought a Dreamcast and Saturn long after the fact so I could take advantage of the thrifty pre-owned market of the city I inhabited to pick and choose the console exclusives I wanted to catch up on. The hype for Sonic Heroes turned out to be... misplaced. I don't blame those coursemates - while they probably thought Sonic Adventure was a completely acceptable video game, an illusion propelled by nostalgia that the more recent rereleases have finally helped to lift, no-one could've anticipated that Sonic Heroes was a buggy, poorly conceived mess that attempted to take the idea Adventure introduced of making each character's campaigns play very differently, which in actuality rendered half of them as borderline torturous mini-games on a par with Big the Cat's notorious \"fishing for Froggy\". It's no Sonic the Hedgehog 2006, I'll hasten to clarify, but at that point we're arguing over which garbage dump would be the more pleasant vacation spot.\n\nSo... yeah, farewell Sonic Heroes. I'll always have your earworm of a theme if I need something to remember you by. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 111: Black Isle's Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II\n\nOriginal Release (NA): 20/01/2004\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (also out on Xbox)\n\nIn a surreal bit of timing, the sequel to Snowblind's Dark Alliance offshoot of BioWare's Baldur's Gate series - which attempted to \"console-ify\" the critical darling CRPG by streamlining a lot of the more leisurely-paced (gait-like, you might say) aspects common to the genre for a more action-oriented hack-and-slash loot RPG approach - came about a couple of weeks before Snowblind's next project: a functionally similar loot RPG adaptation of 989 Studios's venerable and @marino-approved MMORPG EverQuest, dubbed Champions of Norrath. In another curious twist to the tale, Dark Alliance 2 was handled by Black Isle Studios - an RPG-focused division of Interplay that developed Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment and were the ones to publish the original Baldur's Gate. They studied this new Dark Alliance engine format and produced a sequel of a similar caliber, much like they had done with the Infinity Engine games that followed BioWare's trailblazing CRPG. From what I've read, Snowblind weren't too pleased about either the appropriation of their engine or the competition to their upcoming game which also utilized it.\n\nWhen I wrote about the original Dark Alliance for this feature I eliminated it due to my \"superior sequel\" clause, since I wanted the shelf to be more representative of my love of the PS2 than simply stacking it with sequels from the best franchises. That elimination decision might've been made too hastily: there's a lot of debate around whether Snowblind's original vision or Black Isle's attempt to improve on the established model created the superior product, similar to the arguments around Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. It's been so long since I played the first that I perhaps can't trust my own take as much as I'd like. What I think I'll do instead is eliminate both the Dark Alliance games - I always preferred the original CRPGs, if I'm being frank - and instead let the Snowblind loot game find its champion in... Champions. Either of the Champions. Eliminated.\n\nCase File 112: Nippon Ichi Software's Phantom Brave\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 22/01/2004\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (later ported to Wii, PSP and Steam)\n\nIt's our third NIS SRPG for this feature, and probably the most subversive of that particular clan. For one, the game eschews grids and allows units to move in any direction, creating circular areas of movement for each unit that offers more freedom. The second is that you only have one living character on your team at any time: Marona, the heroine. Her unique power is to summon Phantoms to fight for her, including her spectral guardian Ash (that guy with the scarf) who is always around in cutscenes. The player does that by \"possessing\" objects in the vicinity, such as trees, rocks, bushes and other small or medium-sized naturally-occurring or manmade fixtures - each of these objects has a certain effect on the stats of the summoned Phantom also, so for example if the spirit possesses a rock then they'd see greater defensive values but perhaps slower movement speed. It's a very strange ruleset to get used to, but that just helps it stand out all the more. So too does its bummer of a story, which sees the cheerful young Marona ostracized for her spooky powers and struggle to make friends, to the extent that you spend the first few hours thoroughly disheartened by everyone you meet recoiling in horror at Marona's presence and sending her hate mail. Doesn't help that her only friend and protector is a ghost himself, who worked alongside her parents before all three were killed by a colossal demonic presence named Sulphur. The story turns around eventually as various smarter and more compassionate NPCs begin appreciating Marona more for stepping in whenever there's trouble, but it's hard going for those first few chapters.\n\nI really like Phantom Brave, but I'm not going to pretend that you aren't better off with any of its enhanced \"We Meet Again\" ports, all of which include a brand new story mode and various other tweaks and additions. However, that is also the case for my other favorite NIS game, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, so I'm thinking of having the two duel for my affection in the second round. Because NIS SRPGs had been such a major presence back when I was playing PS2 games regularly, I'd like to have at least one of them on the shelf. Hey, I might still consider having both up there, since these aren't really sequels. Considered.\n\nCase File 113: tri-Ace's Star Ocean: Till the End of Time\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 22/01/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nI really wanted to like Till the End of Time, the third in the Star Ocean series of sci-fi RPGs. I'd enjoyed what little I played of Star Ocean 2 and have been surprisingly patient with tri-Ace in general over the years, enjoying the likes of Infinite Undiscovery for 360 and Valkyrie Profile, the sequel of which should coming up in this feature in due time. Till the End of Time is a difficult game to enjoy, however, or perhaps one that can be more diplomatically described as an acquired taste. As Fayt, a youth on board a massive vacation starship who conveniently whiles away his downtime in a virtual reality combat simulation game, giving him all the melee and survival skills he might need if he hypothetically crash lands on a planet stuck in a medieval era of technological development. After an attack on his ship from the Vendeemi, an advanced and previously peaceful alien race, which eventually leads to exactly what I described above, he is first pressed to survive his current predicament before figuring out a way to get back to his parents and friend Sophia, or at least determine what happened to them after they got split up. The game drifts between traditional fantasy milieus and outer space venues, hopping between a few planets with a number of recurring party members as the story continues to build around Fayt, his mysterious heretofore untapped powers (ain't that always the way?) and an unstoppable and mysterious interstellar force that has both humanity and Vendeemi on the run. The game has a few progression and mini-game innovations and a real-time combat engine that rewards quick and decisive action, but is overall something of an overambitious mess. I have vague memories of a system that rewards map completion, requiring the player hug the walls of every new area to get that elusive 100%, an invention system that lets you create new items from found objects but only earns you money if you beat other AI inventors to the idea first, and Battle Trophies which reward bonus options to the player's menus for accomplishing increasingly unlikely battle conditions.\n\nThe game is extremely challenging, through what I imagine was an unintentional quirk of how the player acquires new healing items. It's easy to get to the point where you have no more money for healing items and cannot survive the difficult battles to earn more which show up midway through your first planet exploration, when the Vendeemi come back and harder enemies start spawning everywhere. With no means to make money to keep myself alive, I got kind of stuck and gave up. I'm not done with Star Ocean entirely - I bought the sequel The Last Hope for 360 and never played it - but I wonder how long I'd last if I restarted the game. It could just be that its ambition overshadowed its quality - the original version of the game, first released in 2003, was so buggy that it necessitated a Director's Cut the following year to address the many issues, which is the version we saw in North America and Europe. But big, imaginative and overblown JRPGs are also sort of my whole aesthetic, so maybe it deserves another chance with a bit more of a measured approach. Could be that I ragequit without taking the time to figure out its quirks. Or it just sucks. Let's find out, shall we? Considered.\n\nCase File 114: Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call\n\nOriginal Release (JP): 29/01/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nThis song, which plays during certain high-stakes boss battles, conveniently highlights in a microcosm what Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call (a.k.a. Nocturne a.k.a. SMT III) is all about. The track initially resembles one of the faster-paced battle tunes from Final Fantasy 7 or 8, ramping up the tempo with its organ synth before abruptly giving way to grimy metal guitars and drums and a heavily distorted throaty voice barking about rejecting gods like a (more) demonic Tom Waits. Shin Megami Tensei isn't Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy might as well be a baby's passing daydream about butterfly farts compared to the underworld of hurt the core SMT series drags its victims into. This game is mean. What began as a dungeon crawler about nerds summoning demons from their computer box and having to get bailed out by Stephen Hawking matured into one of the most gritty, uncompromising and metaphysically dense RPG series out there, and is deliberately designed to eat newcomers for breakfast unless they acclimate themselves darn quick to the in-depth demon-fusing and weakness-covering that these games involve. I regret to say that I bounced off Nocturne pretty hard initially, unprepared for its difficulty as I was, but have come to respect what the game demands of the player through the slightly more approachable MegaTen gateway that is the Persona spin-off franchise.\n\nThis game is not only one of the best PS2 RPGs from a consensus standpoint, but assuredly a major rite of passage for any JRPG aficionado also. For those reasons and more, I'm determined to give it another shot to see if I can't rise above all the Matadors and Mots waiting to hand the Demi-fiend his demispherical ass. Considered.\n\nCase File 115: Snowblind's Champions of Norrath\n\nOriginal Release (NA): 10/02/2004\n\nPS2 Exclusive!\n\nAs I said, there was very little time separating Dark Alliance 2 and this, Snowblind's successor to their D&D licensed loot RPG which switches licenses and a few gameplay mechanics but largely keeps the hack and slash core intact. I think the reasons I prefer Champions of Norrath (and its sequel) to Dark Alliance are: A) a purity of purpose with a more streamlined and less quest-driven loot RPG, B) that Snowblind had the extra experience to improve their craft, and C) the fact that I hold zero affection for the original EverQuest and for MMORPG gameplay in general that might've otherwise elicited some disappointment in a less-sophisticated console reimagining of that game's world, which was the case for Dark Alliance. Champions is still steeped in EverQuest lore for the most part - Firiona \"box art lady\" Vie shows up at one point, and the game gets knee-deep in a plot about orcs, vampires and the villainous God of Hatred - but it's more about building a blank slate character and sending them out into the world for fortune and glory, which is perhaps truer to the MMO experience it is nominally based on.\n\nThe one issue here will be choosing between Champions of Norrath and its sequel Champions: Return to Arms. Given that you can import your character across games, it might just be prudent to play through them both at some point in the future to determine which is better. Considered.\n\nResults\n\nWelcome to 2004! Again! A bit more of a Japan focus with this week's rundown. It's a little unusual how we seem to alternate, but in this case I think that's mostly due to how the American holiday rush starts a little earlier than the Japanese one. Some real \"pile of shame\" entries this week also, as I never did complete the much-loved Nightshade, the expansive and surreal Star Ocean: Till the End of Time or the dark horse of the JRPG world that is Shin Megami Tensei and its third core entry Nocturne/Lucifer's Call (I always did feel like the European title was a little on the nose - of course Lucifer is calling you out, that's what he does).\n\nThis week sees five new games to be considered for the second round, bringing us to 47 out of 115 games to revisit. We've also added a new game to the shelf (congrats to Project Zero 2!) which makes it nine games strong as of writing. They're not quite high enough to be on cloud nine, but close enough for our purposes. If this week was Japan-centric then next week promises to be even more so with nine of its ten featured games hailing from the land of the rising sun. That also means a lot of great (and not so great) JRPGs to wax lyrical about, so I can't wait.\n\n< Back to the Case File Repository\n\nI'm in a gaming situation right now which is normal for most but fairly unusual for me, and I'm wondering why it bothers me to the extent that I generally try to avoid it. I'm speaking about having multiple video game playthoughs happening simultaneously. Along with No Man's Sky, an open-ended game which I'd normally be happy to abandon but for the fact I'm very close to a Platinum trophy (a few more dogfights and system warps are all that's standing in the way), I've still got the space-themed final world of Yooka-Laylee to knock out, I'm two episodes deep in the excellent Tales from the Borderlands (more on both of those later), and have been dipping into Picross 3D: Round 2 whenever I'm away from my laptop.\n\nIt might be that because I play a lot of narrative-focused games - RPGs and adventure games in particular - that I tend to approach them single-file in order to not lose their narrative threads too easily. Games like those aren't easy to return to after spending some time away on a new and more exciting acquisition, and so it's often the case that I finish my plate before asking for the next course. Given that I literally do that as far as food as concerned, it could just be a neurotic trait of mine: that I can't enjoy something new without that feeling that I've left something half-finished distracting me throughout.\n\nAnyway, to the above games' credit, they're all built to be played for intermittent stretches of time in varying ways. With No Man's Sky, there's zero narrative to be concerned with and the game seems ideal for short play sessions where you warp to a new system, explore the planets, pick up some new blueprints, gain some cash from mining, foraging or lifeform analysis, get prepared to move onto the next system and simply leave it there for days or weeks before repeating the process. With Yooka-Laylee, I can consume each of its enormous worlds at a pace of my choosing, and is once again another game where the story isn't exactly difficult to come back to after a hiatus. With Tales from the Borderlands, the episodic nature of its fractured tale means there's plenty of recaps and reminders for those who bought each chapter as they were released, often months apart. And Picross 3D is just Picross. It's the perennial puzzle game that's meant to last you. I've almost 100 puzzles completed with no end in sight.\n\nThere are definitely games that I have to hone in on with a laser focus until they're done. Most of the games on my 2017 \"List of Games Beaten\" so far have fit that mold, as do most of the games still remaining on my backlog. The ones I have going right now, however, just happen to have something of a more easygoing nature to them. The only worry is that I completely forget about them during the weeks of newly embarked playthroughs to come, especially as we edge closer to a very busy (for me) May. Speaking of weeks and embarking on things, here's the latest rundown of blogging content:\n\nThe Top Shelf endures with another ten PS2 games receiving judgement. This week's theme was another all-Western releases edition, with Ubisoft in particular taking center stage with three major releases in the November of 2003. Next week will offer a more varied bunch, as well as our introduction to 2004, so I can't wait to tuck in.\n\nThe Indie Game of the Week was, as previously stated, the first two episodes of Telltale's Tales from the Borderlands, set in Gearbox's shooter-RPG world of Mad Maxes, Mad Moxxis and memes. I've been enjoying the story so far, and the game's level of humor feels several tiers higher than those of the regular Borderlands games. There's very little interactivity, though, beyond a few QTE action sequences and the requisite Telltale dialogue choices and big decisions. Not that it's a bad thing at all - visual novels and quote-unquote walking simulators are proving to be extremely popular which suggests that, to many, story takes priority over inventory puzzles (and I can kinda see where they're coming from) - but each new Telltale series I play feels more like an interactive episode of TV with few opportunities to explore a space and take in the various hotspots for a few witty lines of dialogue. It feels more like something that could work better as a DVD game.\n\nThis week also sees a irregular blog of mine make its second appearance this year: the Wiki Project series. In this case, I finally completed the Super '96 project which I began at the start of the year. With every one of the SNES's 1996 unique game debuts accounted for, we're just a few dozen away from a complete inventory of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It's been a long road, as the saying goes, but I'm excited to finally put a cap on my favorite video game console after so many years. Like filling the final few spaces on a 5000-piece jigsaw and using that table space for something entirely new. (As for what I'm working on next for the wiki: I've got some NES clean-up that I've been meaning to get around to, followed by checking up on the Master System. After that is the final stretch for the SNES!)\n\nYooka-Laylee\n\nFor the most part, I'm enjoying Yooka-Laylee and I think it was worth the investment I made as a backer of its Kickstarter. I realize it is poor review form to put the bit that normally goes at the end at the start instead, but that's because I've spent the week trying to sort out my feelings on the game, and I'm concerned that thinking too much about it as I write up my impressions will cause me to change my mind in the eleventh hour. In the here and now, gut reaction, I think the game is a success in what it's attempting to do and (I hope) what it's attempting to bring back. I just don't think it's perfect. In many ways, I doubt it could've ever been.\n\nWhen I think of games that saw a lot of crowdfunding buzz, I think of those that rely largely on nostalgia to draw an audience of backers who would be interested in seeing a game of that specific format return. The most famous example, and still one of the most successful, is Double Fine's promise of a point and click adventure game befitting of the LucasFilm golden era of attractive, usually high-concept and often very funny graphic adventure games in the mold of Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle or Full Throttle. Enough people have enough fond memories of those games to want to see another like it, made in the modern era with enough modern improvements to buoy that old-school approach. Shenmue 3, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, Torment: Tides of Numenera, Pillars of Eternity, Mighty No 9 and Shadowrun Returns all aimed (or will aim) to resurrect a specific video game paradigm that has fallen out of favor with major publishers and thus cannot be funded without a lot of grassroots support. The Kickstarter for Yooka-Laylee, proposed by ex-Rare employees in a newly formed studio named Playtonic, was definitely borne of the same idea: that to make an N64 collectathon 3D platformer in that same Rare style in this day and age would require a legion of nostalgic fans putting their money where their mouths are.\n\nHowever, with a lot of modern reboots of antiquated game formats there's often a schism between attempting to marry modern game design to that older model, like sticking a new engine inside a classic chassis, or to stay as true to the original model as closely as possible, outmoded warts and all. I wasn't quite able to ascertain where Yooka-Laylee's own philosophy lies: it has problems persistent to this format, like a hyperactive, easily trapped camera and various sequence-breaking type glitches, that I'm not sure modern advances could easily fix. There are also cases where it's evident that there have been meetings on minimizing the amount of bullshit that was in the original Banjo-Kazooie, like losing collectibles upon death or having to deal with \"lives\" at all (Yooka-Laylee fixes both, for the record). But for the most part, the game is as wilfully obtuse and difficult to navigate as the bird & bear games ever were, and I sort of suspect that it was the designers' imperative. There's no hints as to how and where each world's 25 \"Pagie\" progression-dependent collectibles can be earned, here taking the place of the B-K \"Jiggies\" (B-K Jiggies being the name of my ska band in high school), and given how big each world is and how many caves and tunnels and other areas there are to uncover, you can find yourself wandering around for ages hunting for where the last few collectibles are hiding. In the first world, as an example, there's a cloud that talks about badly wanting to rain - true to the sense of humor seen in games like Conker's Bad Fur Day, the game treats all this like a giant \"wanting to pee\" goof - and doing so by acquiring a nearby water-shooting power-up lets you help them out and earn a Pagie for your trouble. However, you can also feed the same cloud an ice-based power-up which causes him to freeze a part of the level instead. This lets you take part in a race with another cloud NPC, who had already given you a Pagie for a different race, in order to earn another one from them. Took forever to work that one out, and I'm not sure if I hate or appreciate the game's obtuse ingenuity.\n\nThe game's not just withholding in the sense of where to go next, either. I suspect someone on Playtonic's staff really doesn't care for games that have extended tutorials, or hold your hand by pointing out every nearby item of interest via icons on a map or some big indicator on the player's radar. This also extends to power-ups, as we saw on Giant Bomb's unfortunate but understandable Quick Look for the game. The player only gets a surface-level introduction to each of the game's many acquired abilities. For Yooka's roll move, which is the first move the player earns, the player can be forgiven for assuming that the rolling mode only has one speed: full tilt forward. Indeed, the first time you use the power-up for something other than climbing slippery slopes is to race that aforementioned cloud. Thus, you're conditioned into thinking the power-up is only there to help you move fast. Against the first world's boss, though, there's no other way than to roll slowly enough to navigate past the rolling logs separating the boss at the top of the slope from you at the bottom. To work your way past or over those logs, you need to gently tilt the analog sticks to carefully move Yooka while in ball form. Without knowing this, you're likely to hit your head against that boss for an hour or more - since he's literally a wall, that analogy works a little too well not to be deliberate on the part of the developers. Keep in mind also that it's the first boss of the game and the rest get much more difficult. There's very little leniency or guidance in Yooka-Laylee, which you might say is a core component of the era it hails from that the game is deliberately invoking, or a failure on the part of the game developers to not adjust to the times by redoubling on user-friendliness. Personally, I'm not sure where I stand - I've been thwarted enough times with instances like the above to get a little frustrated that some power-ups have heretofore unexplained aspects, but I also respect the hustle. Maybe games have gotten too signposted and straightforward, and we need to readjust to appreciating games with a bit of mystery and experimentation involved. Or maybe they just screwed up. I cannot say with any certainty.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the game is uncannily like Banjo-Kazooie right down to the fine details. The dynamic of the two characters is identical - the large, male biped is the polite straight man, while the female flying creature on top is a more sarcastic barb-trader who is the secret VIP as far as traversal goes. The font's the same, the set of grunts and squawks that accompany dialogue is the same, the game looks like that 360 HD remaster of the Banjo-Kazooie games with a lot of plain and basic textures propped up by some high-definition effects and character models, there's an NPC that turns you into different creatures (sometimes vehicles), there's a set of five color-coded creatures that appear as collectibles within each world, there's one collectible set for buying new levels and another set for buying new abilities, and so on and so forth. The game is \"Banjo-Threeie\" in all but name, and even if the stages are meted out differently - there's five worlds instead of B-K's nine - each one can be expanded to include twice as much content. The game is therefore about as large as Banjo-Kazooie, but not quite as varied, which I imagine is due to limitations in the budget for new art assets. The knock-on effect of that decision is that the levels feel huge and much harder to navigate in part because it all looks the same - each world has its own theme and is entirely distinct from one another, but internally each world features the same recycled props and textures making it can be hard to figure out where you are and where you want to go. In each of these worlds, there's 200 of the \"quill\" currency (needed for upgrades) and 25 Pagies, as well as the five color-coded ghosts, a health extender and a power gauge extender (the power gauge, incidentally, was created to limit how much the player could use their abilities in one go without the need for a dozen different types of ammo, which made Rare's platformer levels a mess to look at), a token for each stage's arcade machine, a \"molly cool\" for the creature polymorph machine, AND a top secret pirate treasure that is so elusive that the game doesn't even track them anywhere. It's not quite Donkey Kong 64 levels of collecting lunacy, but it can be tricky to find that one collectible left over with such huge levels to comb. Very much like the proverbial needle in a haystack. I half wonder if the devs wouldn't have been better off pulling a Super Mario 64 and doubling up on certain themed worlds, like two snow levels or two swamp levels. Cheap, sure, but making the levels more compact would've helped immeasurably with mentally mapping them out.\n\nI can't leave without discussing the game's absolute nadir: the mini-games. Each level features exactly one arcade machine and one minecart challenge. With the former, you're playing reimagined versions of classic Rare games and other sort of small games-within-games, like an endless runner, RC Pro-Am, or an odd take on Joust. These games are individually so basic and undercooked that they add little to the experience, and there's two Pagies hidden within each one: the first for successfully reaching the \"end\" of the game, and the second for doing so with the highest score. You cannot earn the high score Pagie at the same time as the completion Pagie; they must be done consecutively. It's a really unfortunate twist to an already miserable inclusion. The minecart levels are even worse, however: the goal is to navigate an auto-scrolling course of tracks while collecting diamonds. You also have to avoid enemies, as collisions reduce the number of diamonds you have. If you fail to complete the course with the required amount of diamonds, you have to start over. Not only are these sections incredibly challenging on their own but are exacerbated by the abysmal cart controls. You can hit forward on the analog stick for a burst of speed or back for a short brake, but it's very difficult to gauge when you need to use either and you can barrel through a whole bunch of obstacles and lose half the diamonds in your reserve with one mis-timed use of the acceleration/brake. If you happen to fall down a gap the mini-game is instantly over and you have to restart (or ragequit in disgust, that's an option too). The required diamond total, as well as the length of the course, increase with each level to the point where they now require such a prohibitively high level of skill over something inherently uncontrollable that I'm tempted to leave this game at 99% completion, despite the conniptions that would normally cause me.\n\nAs I said, the game's not perfect, but it does what it sets out to do and I've no trouble believing that a subsequent game with a better budget couldn't knock it out of the park. Why? Well, I figure that Yooka-Laylee probably knocked a few cobwebs loose and stirred a few familiar veins during its development, and that the divisive feedback will give the designers a much better idea of what a modern audience wants out of a throwback 3D platformer like this. I'm not sure if the \"Rare-vival\" is here to stay without seeing the revenue numbers, but even if we don't see another game with the lizard and bat there'll be plenty of other nostalgia-traders waiting in the Indie wings to help ensure this sub-genre makes an overdue return. Who knows? Maybe the cute visuals and not-always-sexual humor of Yooka-Laylee begets a new generation of young fans who appreciate a game that doesn't talk down to and coddle them. It's not like they don't take easily to games without a whole lot of direction - just see the numbers on games like Rust or Minecraft for proof.\n\nWelcome to The Top Shelf, a weekly feature wherein I sort through my extensive PS2 collection for the diamonds in the rough. My goal here is to narrow down a library of 185 games to a svelte 44: the number of spaces on my bookshelf set aside for my PS2 collection. That means a whole lot of vetting and a whole lot of science that needs to be done, ten games at a time. Be sure to check out the Case File Repository for more details and a full list of games/links!\n\nCase File 096: Rebellion's Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death\n\nOriginal Release (EU): 17/10/2003\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (also out on Xbox, PC and GameCube)\n\nThe holiday period is a hell of a thing for game releases, and 2003 was no exception. The ten games today were all released across a span of thirty-two days near the end of the year and, with one exception, were all multi-platform. Despite the mainstream flavor this week, we still have some remarkable games to get through here, starting with an unexpected Judge Dredd licensed game. The justice-obsessed supercop was \"between movies\" when this game came out, so the inspiration instead came from the long-running British comic anthology he hailed from, 2000AD. (Rebellion would also adapt another 2000AD staple, Rogue Trooper, a few years later.) In particular it covers the Dark Judges, extradimensional beings (that dimension strongly hinted as being Hell) that occasionally find a way to cross over and amuse themselves by \"judging\" the fleshy weaklings of our universe. Oddly enough, the verdict is always \"death\". The game throws in a few comic book fan favorites, such as the blonde psychic Judge Anderson, and while the plot largely concerns monsters like vampires and demons, it still adheres to a law system that rewards bonus points for choosing to arrest criminals that surrender and ensuring civilian casualties are kept to a minimum.\n\nAs much as I like the idea of a fully-fledged Judge Dredd game that isn't locked into the asinine plot of the Sly Stallone movie, Dredd vs. Death is only a so-so third-person shooter at the end of the day. One that also, while fairly innovative, still hasn't aged particularly well. As always, I have to be - if you pardon the expression - judicious with what games I decide to pass into the second round. The sentence is: Eliminated.\n\nCase File 097: LucasArts's Gladius\n\nOriginal Release (NA): 28/10/2003\n\nNot PS2 Exclusive (also out on Xbox and GameCube)\n\nI wish I'd spent more time with Gladius. A gladiator training sim, Gladius is fairly open-ended early on as you move around the various arenas and take on rival teams of warriors for prizes and glory. It's loosely inspired by the likes of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics with its rock-paper-scissor unit system and potential for upgrading units that manage to survive long enough, and the premise of rising through the gladiatorial ranks to become a team of Before Common Era rock stars who are celebrated wherever they go is a compelling one. As is, if I'm being honest, a variety of units that move from standard berserkers and archers to era-specific secutors and peltasts to friggin' war bears, cyclopses and giant scorpions. That's not to say that the story stuff doesn't kick in eventually, but that can all wait until you're truly unbeatable. Posse up with your best and brawniest and start earning those denarii"
