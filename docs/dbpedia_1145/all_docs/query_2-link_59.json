        "text": "Spells [for cooking]\n\nAssassin's Banquet : This spell allows the mage to cast either Poison Food, Lethal Food, or Delayed Food Poisoning, or Delayed Lethal Food as an area spell. The caster may refrain from poisoning certain meals within the area of effect.\n\nBottle Regular: This spell automatically takes food from a common pot, portions it out into glass or tin containers (mage's choice of shape and type), sterilizes the containers, and seals them allowing the mage to quickly preserve food for later use.If necessary, this spell will create the appropriate sort of containers, however, the mage must expend more energy to create them.\n\nBottomless Cup Regular : When this spell is cast on a cup full of drink or a plate of food, more food or drink of that same type appears when the container is almost empty until the subject has eaten or drunk his fill. The food or drink created is no better than what was originally there, but it is available in seemingly endless amounts. However, in order for the spell to work, there must be some food or drink in the container when the spell is cast.\n\nButcher Regular, resisted by Sapients: This spell automatically slaughter a living or freshly dead creature and magically renders it into cuts of meat and neatly stacked piles of byproducts (such as offal, fur, feathers, horns or hide) ready for further processing. Living creatures get a resistance probability. Otherwise they take damage and are automatically dead and dismembered within 1 minute.\n\nChange Drink Regular: This spell changes one sort of drink into any other sort of drink the mage can imagine. The limitations are that the basic quality of the ingredients cannot be improved and the alcoholic content of the beverage cannot be improved above its original level. For example, rusty-flavored tap water can be turned into low-quality soda pop, but not fine wine. Spring water could be turned into fine (non-alcoholic) grape juice (or something of lesser quality) suitable for fermentation, but it couldn't be turned directly into wine using this spell.\n\nChange Food Regular: This spell changes one sort of food into food of any other sort the mage can imagine. Bulk remains the same, but all other qualities can be altered. Though nutritional value can be changed, basic quality and flavor of the food cannot be improved. For example, tough, stale meat could be turned into vegetables, but they would still be tough and stale.\n\nCheese Regular: This spell turns milk or cream into cheese, yogurt or similar food.\n\nChoking Regular, resisted by Health: Any food or drink affected by this spell becomes \"sticky\", and will stick in the victim's mouth and throat. Anyone who eats the food must resist or start to gag. They can do nothing but cough. Victims can resist every 10 seconds to clear their throats. If the initial resistance roll \\ failed, the food lodges in the victim's windpipe and he begins to choke. While he is choking he cannot speak or do any other physical action except to resist in order to clear his trachea.\n\nComplete Digestion Regular: This peculiar spell can either be cast on a willing subject or on food or drink. In both cases it allows the subject to completely digest food or drink, eliminating the need to urinate or defecate. More importantly, the subject derives twice as much nutritional benefit from such food. However, if the food is poisoned, he is at disadvantage to all resistance attempts since his body absorbs the poison more easily!\n\nConcentrate Food Regular: This spell turns any food into a concentrated substance with equivalent nutrition and a taste vaguely reminiscent of the subject. This can be anything from a compact paste to a dry stick, as the caster desires. Weight and volume of the food can be reduced to as low as 1/5th the original. If taken all the way to this level, the food will also be nonperishable.\n\nCreate Beverage Regular\n\nThis spell is like the Create Food spell but it creates beverages.\n\nThis is also an Elemental Water spell.\n\nCreate Ingredient Regular\n\nThis spell allows real food of a single type to be created. The cost of the spell depends on the rarity and value of the ingredients.\n\nDelicious Scent Regular, resisted by Will\n\nThis spell amplifies the savory aromas given off by food, making food smell absolutely irresistible.\n\nAny creature with a nose who can smell the aroma of good food (generally, anyone within 5 hexes) must make a Will roll to resist investigating the source of the aroma. Characters with the Gluttony disadvantage must roll at -4. This spell also gives +1 to Cooking skill rolls. The food might not taste any better, but it sure smells good!\n\nThis is also an Air spell.\n\nDiscern Vintage Information, resisted by IQ\n\nThis spell allows the mage to trace the entire history of a morsel of food or a sip of drink.\n\nDetails include the year the item was made, its ingredients, any unorthodox materials or techniques used to make it, who made it, etc. All the stereotypical wine snob stories apply (For example: \"Chateaux Pretense Montrachet '09, made from grapes grown on a southwestern facing hill approximately 20 yards from a granite boulder. The grapes were trampled by a middle-aged man named Pierre with a wooden leg made from ash wood. The juice was bottled in an 3 year old oak keg with one new stave in it.\").\n\nFor purposes of showing off one's \"knowledge\" of food and drink this spell gives Savoir Faire (Connoisseur) 25, though it might be useful to figure out who actually prepared a poisoned dish, etc.\n\nThis is a also a Knowledge spell.\n\nDiet Regular\n\nReduces the number of calories in a meal by 50%. Nutritional value is unaffected.\n\nDishes Regular\n\nThis spell creates any sort of dish or cooking utensil the mage can imagine. At the mage's option these containers or tools can be made edible!\n\nDrink of Drought Regular, resisted by Special\n\nThis spell (sometimes also called Thirsty Water) makes a potable liquid cause thirst, rather than relieving it.\n\nAny character who drinks the liquid will become more and more thirsty. For every sip he takes, he loses a pint of water. Each sip after the first causes 1d points of dehydration damage and does 2 point of Fatigue. Should the victim fall unconscious from damage, he will die within 1d hours, his body quickly turning into a brown mummy.\n\nNote that in hot weather this spell is even more dangerous. Each lost quart (2 pints) of fluids from the body gives -1 to HT to resist the effects of extreme heat or hot weather and costs the character an additional 1 point of Fatigue damage (5 points instead of 4).\n\nThe loss of a gallon of fluids means that the subject is extremely thirsty. The loss of two gallons of fluids means that the subject is absolutely parched and is verging on delirium.\n\nCharacters who drink this \"anti-liquid\" must make an IQ roll to realize the true nature of the beverage they're drinking, at +1 to IQ for every pint of beverage they've imbibed.\n\nVictims must also roll vs. Will or become obsessed with getting something to drink. If no other source of fluid can be found, the victim must roll vs. Will (at a bonus equal to the bonus to his IQ roll to figure out what he was drinking) to avoid returning to the Drink of Drought!\n\nCharacters who drink \"anti-liquid\" must make up the lost fluids by drinking enough real beverages to cancel the effects of this spell or by having a spell that restores fluids cast on them.\n\nThis is also a Water spell.\n\nDrunkard's Cup Resisted by HT-3\n\nThis spell makes anything poured into a drinking vessel become intoxicating. The subject must roll vs. HT-3 every time he takes a sip from the vessel or begin to suffer the effects of drunkenness.\n\nThe first sip leaves him cheerful and elated. IQ, DX and Will are reduced by 3. The second makes him wild and messy, reducing attributes by an additional two points (-5 total). The next failed roll leaves him sullen and depressed, with a total -7 to IQ, DX and Will. A final missed roll will leave him unconscious for 1d+6 hours.\n\nOn a critical failure, he must roll vs. HT or go into an alcoholic coma. In a coma he must roll vs. HT every hour. If the roll fails, he loses 1 HP. On any critical success he recovers; on any critical failure, his heart stops and he goes into Cardiac Arrest. If a physician is present, the Physician's skill can be substituted for the victim's HT. In any case, a successful Physician roll gives +2 to HT rolls, or +4 if full TL6+ emergency room facilities are available.\n\nIf the contents of the vessel are already alcoholic, the victim must make two HT rolls each time he drinks.\n\nEach time the subject drinks, he gets and IQ roll to realize what is happening. Until he makes his IQ roll, the victim will always accept a refill if one is offered or readily available. Other properties of the liquid remain unchanged (i.e., poison is still poison).\n\nNote that this spell won't work against creatures which are naturally immune to drunkenness. However, Alcohol Resistance does not help, though Poison resistance gives bonuses to HT to avoid coma or damage while in a coma.\n\nExplosive Indigestion Regular, resisted by HT\n\nThe mage must cast this spell on normal food or drink. When it is consumed, the victim begins to explosively pass gas and shoot fire from all his orifices.\n\nThe victim must immediately roll vs. HT to resist the spell. If he fails, he must roll vs. IQ or be mentally stunned for 1d seconds while explosive gasses build within his body. Every turn he will shoot a jet of foul smelling flaming gas in a random direction. On a critical failure, the victim attempts to hold the gas in, with disastrous effects.The jets of flame have the same effects as the Flame Breath spell, but they can't be aimed and reach only 1 hex out from the subject. Anyone standing next to the victim when he \"erupts\" will be hit by a Flame Jet on roll of 9 or less. If the victim tries to block the jet, he takes flame damage to the body part or object that he used to block the blast. If the victim tries to hold in the gas, he takes triple flame damage to his vitals as the flaming gas explodes inside him!\n\nIn any case, the escaping gas also has the same effect as the Stench spell and will affect everyone within 3 hexes of the victim and the scent will cling to the victim for 2d hours after the other effects of the spell have worn off. Everyone will react to the subject at -4. In polite (or even not so polite) society, the victim will probably suffer social ostracism for weeks and could get a permanent Bad Reputation!\n\nFamine's Feast Area\n\nThis spell affects all foodstuffs in the area with the Food of Famine spell. In other respects, it is identical to that spell. This spell can also be cast on edible crops.\n\nThis is also a Plant spell.\n\nFast Regular; resisted by Will\n\nThis spell makes the subject forget his hunger and thirst for the duration of the spell. If the subject has to eat, he must make a Will roll to do more than peck at his food. Note that this spell only makes the subject immune to the psychological effects of hunger and thirst. The subject will still lose attributes (except for IQ) due to hunger and thirst, and will still take damage, but he can ignore his needs for the duration of the spell.\n\nThis is also a Mind Control spell.\n\nFatten Regular\n\nFood affected by this spell on it is 50% calorific than normal. Nutritional content is unaffected.\n\nThis spell is most commonly used by livestock farmers, but it is useful for men doing strenuous work in extremely cold conditions or as a way of driving dieters crazy.\n\nFeast of Emotions Regular, resisted by Will\n\nThis spell allows the mage to season his food or drink with emotions! Anyone who eats the enchanted food (or drinks an enchanted beverage) must roll vs. Will or be overcome by the emotion the mage has implanted.\n\nThese effects are not strong enough to compel action, but are very strong -- role-play them! If the emotion plays on a character's disadvantages (like aphrodisiacs placed in the food of a Lecherous character) they must roll to resist their disadvantages at -2 to Will.\n\nCommon emotions placed in food are nostalgia, contentment and sexual arousal. Anger, jealousy, and discontent can be used to start fights.\n\nThis is also a Mind Control spell.\n\nFlavorless Regular; resisted by IQ\n\nThis spell removes all flavor from a single container of food. This is the antithesis of the Season spell. Targeted food held by another creature resists with that creature's IQ.\n\nFood Color Regular\n\nThis spell allows food to be colored without affecting its taste or texture.\n\nFood Fight Area, resisted by Special\n\nCauses all edible (and/or theoretically or once edible, includes garbage, offal, waste, scraps, etc.) materials in the area to randomly fly about the area at tremendous speeds. Light or disposable containers (like milk cartons or light pie pans) will also begin flying if they have a significant amount of food in or on them. Larger containers will not move, but their contents will spill or fly.\n\nThe flying material does 1 point of damage per turn if they are solid or hot (hard fruit, frozen chickens, pots of hot coffee etc.), unless subjects in the area of effect make a DX roll. If they fail, they not only take the damage, but also must make a HT roll to avoid being blinded as for the Pie spell. Soft foods which are not hot do no damage but can still blind.\n\nAfter 5 seconds, the ground in the area of effect will be slippery with goo and junk. All hexes in the area of effect are affected as if by a Grease (p. G79) spell. After the spell ends, the area will still be cluttered, but not preternaturally so.\n\nNeedless to say that any food affected by this spell is likely to be ruined and anything in the area will be covered with food.\n\nThis spell assumes that there is a significant amount of food in the area (like what you would find at a cafeteria or a banquet). If there isn't much food in the area or the food is contained in boxes, bags or barrels so it can't fly about, then the GM can reduce the effects of the spell or just rule that it fails.\n\nFood of Famine Regular, resisted by Special\n\nWhen cast on food or drink, this spell turns it into \"anti-food\" meaning that it subtracts calories when eaten, and leaves the subject hungrier than he was before! Each \"meal\" of \"anti-food\" negates the effects of one previously eaten meal. If too much food is eaten, it will actually cause starvation!\n\nThe food and drink appears normal in all respects, the only difference is that the more the victim eats and drinks, the hungrier he gets.\n\nCharacters who eat this food must make an IQ roll to figure out what is going on, at +1 to IQ for every pound of food (meal) they've eaten. They also get +4 to IQ if they've encountered Food of Famine before. Gluttonous characters or characters who are extremely hungry roll at -2 to IQ. Note that characters who have eaten at least 3 meals of \"anti-food\" are extremely hungry.\n\nCharacters who eat the \"anti-food\" must make up the lost calories either by weight loss from fat or by eating enough real food to cancel the effects of this spell. Every 3 meals of anti-food consumed counts as a day of Starvation with attendant losses to Fatigue and attributes.\n\nFat characters can use this spell to lose a lot of weight fast, with the attendant health risks of a literally \"starvation diet.\" Unwilling characters may roll vs. HT to resist the starvation effects of each meal.\n\nFreshen Food Regular\n\nThis spell will freshen stale, old, or wilted food. It will not improve the quality of the food, nor will it make bad food palatable.\n\nGentle Wine Regular\n\nThis spell creates an alcoholic beverage which has its usual effects until the drinker wishes them to disappear. Then the alcohol in the subject's body magically vanishes, leaving him sober and free of any hang-over effects.\n\nAlternately, the subject can reduce his level of intoxication, rather than completely eliminating the alcohol from his blood. If the character reduces his intoxication level, any remaining alcohol in his system must be eliminated by natural means, or via another spell such as Cure Poison.\n\nGlutton's Delight Regular, resisted by HT\n\nThis spell is identical to the Trencherman spell, except that food and drink ingested don't have any more calories than one meal. Alcohol, drugs or poisons in the food still affect the character normally.\n\nUnwilling characters resist with HT.\n\nThis is also a Body Control spell.\n\nGlutton's Mint Enchantment\n\nThis spell allows the mage to create a Glutton's Mint, as described on p. 41 of GURPS Magic Items I. It's wafer thin!\n\nGood Digestion Regular\n\nAllows a person to consume food or drink without it causing indigestion, food allergies, or other \"normal\" problems. Poisoned or tainted food still affects the character, and he can still get sick from overeating or overindulgence in alcohol.\n\nGood Food Regular\n\nWhen cast on food or drink, this spell gives them the effects of the Good Digestion spell. The food and drink can be consumed in any quantity without causing indigestion, food allergies, or any other health effect associated with \"normal\" food.\n\nIn other respects this spell is like the Good Digestion spell.\n\nGreater Create Food Regular\n\nThis spell will create food from thin-air! However, the food created by this spell is sort of a proto-food: bland, tasteless, and doughy -- but very nourishing. Half a pound of Greater Food has enough nutritional value to support a man for 1 day, and provides the same caloric value as a full meal. Casting Create Food upon Greater Created Food will give a real taste treat.\n\nGuns to Butter Regular, resisted by IQ\n\nAt lower tech levels this spell can be used on melee weapons. The effects are the same, however.\n\nIf this spell is cast on a weapon that is held or carried by another person, they may roll vs. IQ to resist the effects of this spell.\n\nHealth Food Regular\n\nThis spell removes the unhealthy qualities of food while improving its nutritional value, boosting the foods beneficial effects on the body, and undoing the ill effects of other foods.\n\nIn addition, this spell gives the same effects as the Good Food spell.\n\nOne meal of Health Food per day gives a character his complete nutritional needs for the day (but not his total caloric needs). A character who eats nothing but Health Food for the day gets +1 to HT rolls to resist the effects of disease and ingested poisons and to recover from wounds or injuries.\n\nA character who eats nothing but Health Food for at least a year gets the benefits of the Longevity advantage for that year only. Characters who live on Health Food for most (or all) of their lives, effectively have the Longevity advantage.\n\nNote that this spell is typically cast on \"natural\" foods such as macrobiotic bean sprouts, organic tofu, raw honey, or live-culture yogurt, though it doesn't have to be.\n\nThis is also a Healing spell.\n\nImprove Food Regular\n\nThis spell makes existing food or drink become fresher, tastier, and more nutritious, by altering the structure of the foodstuff to improve its quality. Fruits and vegetables become riper and fresher, canned foods could be made to be just as wholesome and flavorful as fresh-cooked foods, or rot-gut wine could be turned into a superior vintage.\n\nThis spell also allows cooking mistakes to be eliminated. For example, a fallen soufflé or a burnt stew could be set to rights.\n\nWhile this effect cannot make bad food palatable and it can't add any ingredient is not there, it can make existing foods more desirable. It gives +2 to Cooking (or the Cook spell) skill roll since the cook has the finest ingredients to work with and can correct his mistakes.\n\nThis spell counters the Flavorless spell. Poisoned food remains poisoned (unless it spoiled due to natural bacterial action).\n\nImproved Create Food Regular\n\nThis spell allows the mage to create food out of thin air, as long as he has a tiny amount of at least one of the ingredients of the recipe or a bit of food of roughly the same type.\n\nThe food created can be of any recipe that the mage is familiar with which could be made from a sufficient quantity of at least one of the ingredients present. For example, a few grains of rice and a bit of dry leather thrown into a pot would turn into a tasty beef stew over rice or a beef and rice soup!\n\nFood created with this spell is wholesome and ordinary in every way, but the quality of the food is limited by the mage's skill with the Cook spell or his Cooking skill.\n\nDuration: Permanent\n\nJunk Food Regular, resisted by IQ\n\nWhen this spell is cast, a food or drink loses all its nutritional value, while retaining its flavor and scent, and mass.\n\nBecause the food still has bulk, anyone who eats Junk Food gets the impression that he has had a full meal. However, his body is not fooled, no Fatigue is regained by eating a meal of Junk Food.\n\nDepending on the situation, this can be good or bad. Bacteria won't grow in food treated with this spell (since they get no nutrition from it) and dieters don't have to worry about gaining weight, but a person who eats a diet of junk food will starve to death or die of a nutritional deficiency.\n\nIf this spell is cast on food held, carried or about to be eaten by another person, they may roll vs. IQ to resist this spell.\n\nLethal Food (VH) Regular, resisted by HT-2\n\nThis spell is identical to the Poison Food spell, except that the poison is more virulent.\n\nAnyone who eats the food must roll vs. HT-2 to Resist immediately after they ingest the food and for 1d additional days. On a failed roll, the victim takes 1d points of damage.\n\nThe progress of the poison can only be stopped with the Neutralize Poison spell. Conventional medical skills (such as Poisons or First Aid) will not help, and Diagnosis or Pathology skill will reveal nothing about the nature of the poison.\n\nA character with the Physician skill can roll vs. his skill to assist the stricken character. For every two points by which the attending physician makes his skill roll, the period of poisoning is reduced by 1 day.\n\nIf a Slow Poison spell is cast on the victim, the victim takes 1d-3 points of damage per day over 2d days.\n\nMagic Ale (VH) Regular\n\nBy using magic to defy the laws of physics, this spell allows th mage to distill an alcoholic beverage that exceeds 200 proof (100% alcohol). Such beverages are incredibly tasty and incredibly potent. They can also be dangerous - a shot glass of 210% proof ale would be the equivalent of 7 pints of beer! If the Intoxication rules from GURPS Compendium II are being used, divide the Magic Ale's proof by 10 to get the beverage's Alcohol Factor. For example, a shot of 210 proof ale would have an Alcohol Factor of 21!\n\nThis spell requires that the mage have a quantity of distilled alcohol. The first casting of this spell brings any distilled beverage up to 200 proof, subsequent castings improve proof by 10%. Volume is not reduced.\n\nMagical Feast (VH) Regular\n\nThe caster can create real, tasty, wholesome, nutritious food and drink sufficient to feed one or more people for one meal. The food created is simple fare unless the caster wishes to pay extra to create something fancier. The food is magically created and no \"raw materials\" are needed.\n\nMonk's Fast Regular\n\nThis spell allows a subject to go without food and drink for a long period of time with no ill effects. In order to work, this spell must be cast in advance of the fast. It will not heal Fatigue or damage caused be meals missed before the spell was cast.\n\nMultiply Food Regular\n\nAs long as the mage has a bit of one or more types of food or drink, he can magically \"multiply\" those foods so that they will feed more people.\n\nEach \"level\" of this spell doubles the amount of food, so one food item becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight and so forth.\n\nThe basic quality or wholesomeness of the multiplied material is not changed, only the quantity is increased.\n\nNear Beer Regular, resisted by IQ\n\nThis spell removes all alcohol from beverages, but makes them taste the same. Other poisonous or mind-altering chemicals are not removed from the drink.\n\nIf this spell is cast on beverages held or carried by another character, the owner may roll vs. IQ to resist.\n\nNutrition Regular\n\nAllows a single meal to supply all the daily nutritional requirements for a creature without adding calories.\n\nNote that if a character is to avoid the effects of Starvation, he must eat the same number of calories. All this spell does is make the food more nutritionally valuable.\n\nPie Missile, Resisted by Special\n\nThis spell creates a pie in the caster's hand that he can then throw at the target's face.\n\nTo target the spell, the mage uses the Spell Throwing (Pie) skill. Due to the nature of the missile, the mage gets +3 to his effective skill, which offsets the penalty to hit the face. The pie has SS 13, Acc +1, 1/2D 25, MAX 50.\n\nIf the pie hits its target, it does 1 point of damage unless the victim can make a HT roll. Additionally, the target must make a DX roll or be blinded for 1 second, then be partially blinded (-3 DX) for 1d seconds. If the target critically fails, he will be blinded for 1d seconds. On successful DX roll, the pie mostly misses the victim's eyes, and he is only partially blinded (-3 DX) for 1 second. On a critical success, the target is unaffected by the pie and takes no damage.\n\nIf the victim has a piece of rigid material, like a sheet of cardboard or a plate, he may add +1 to his DX roll. If he has a shield, he may add the shield's PD to his DX roll. If the subject has the Shield skill or a weapon, he may Block or Parry the pie rather than rolling vs. DX.\n\nIf the subject has any sort of face protection (like a scarf, hood, or veil) he is immune to damage, but still must roll vs. DX to avoid blindness.\n\nThe pie will have no effect (other than making the subject messy) if thrown at any other part of the target's body.\n\nNote that the mage can eat the pie rather than throwing it. It is a permanent, edible, tasty item of food. The mage can specify any type of pie with which he is personally familiar when the spell is cast (crème pie is traditional, however).\n\nRumors persist of variants of this spell that either do a more damage (like Acid Pies or Flaming Pies) or have special effects (like Sleep Pies or Curse Pies). Variants like these would certainly have appropriate extra prerequisites.\n\nPotent Wine Regular, resisted by IQ\n\nThis spell makes an alcoholic beverage more or less potent without changing its taste.\n\nCharacters who drink the altered beverage may roll vs. IQ to detect the change in potency. Unwilling characters resist with IQ.\n\nPrepare Food Regular\n\nAllows ingredients to be prepared for cooking or inclusion in a recipe. For example, this spell allows grain to be malted for brewing, cherries to be pitted, shrimp to be shelled, vegetables to be peeled, or cream to be whipped into whipped cream.\n\nNote that the quality of the final product depends on the mage's skill (e.g., Cooking for preparing vegetables or whipped cream, or Brewing for malting grain for beer).\n\nPurgative Regular, resisted by HT\n\nWhen this spell is cast, any food or drink previously consumed by the subject magically vanishes from his system. This spell won't cure damage already done to the subject's body by food-based poisons, but it immediately halts any further damage if the poison isn't completely absorbed by the subject's body.\n\nWhen this spell is cast, anything the subject consumed up to 12 hours before the spell is cast magically vanishes from his body. Since the subject's digestive tract is emptied, he becomes hungry, and loses 1 point of Fatigue, since he loses the benefit of meals consumed within the last 12 hours.\n\nThis spell is used to relieve poisoning. It will also relieve the effects of overindulgence.\n\nUnwilling subjects resist with HT.\n\nThis is also a Healing spell.\n\nRain of Wine Area\n\nThis spell acts as the Rain spell but it produces a rain of wine (or any other beverage with which the mage is personally familiar) instead of water.\n\nThis spell is mostly used as a special effect, but adventurers might discover more practical uses, such as fertilizing soil, destroying electronics, or making an area slippery, sticky or dirty.\n\nApproximately one pint of liquid is produced per hex affected.\n\nThis is also an Elemental Water spell.\n\nReverse Fermentation Regular, resisted by IQ\n\nWhen the mage casts this spell he can reverse bacterial action on food, making fermented or curdled food revert back to its raw ingredients.\n\nFor example, wine or vinegar would become grape juice, cheese or yogurt would revert to milk, and so forth.\n\nSpoiled food remains spoiled, this spell doesn't remove mold, poison or harmful bacteria.\n\nIf this spell is cast on foodstuffs carried or held by another character, the owner may roll vs. IQ to resist the spell.\n\nRoast's Revenge Regular\n\nThis spell reanimates a cooked animal up to the size of a stag, sheep, or wild boar. The cooked carcass may be partially dismembered or carved, but as long as it is at least 50% intact, this spell will take effect.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the cooked animal begins to regrow any missing parts (but not any missing skin or plumage) taking 2d seconds to do so. In addition, it grows sharp teeth (or beak) and claws. When the regeneration is completed, the beast will attack any target the caster desires.\n\nThe beast has the same characteristics it had in life, except that it has sharp teeth and claws which do cutting damage, its ST and Move is increased by 25% (to a minimum of 5), it's HT is increased by 2 and its HP are increased by 50%. In addition, it also has one level of Toughness (or +1 DR) and the High Pain Threshold, Damage Immunity (Doesn't Bleed, No Brain, No Vitals) and Doesn't Breathe advantages.\n\nThis is also a Necromantic spell.\n\nShape Food Regular\n\nAllows the creation of food-sculptures, wine fountains, or wedding cakes that defy the usual laws of physics. Through use of this spell, food could theoretically be shaped into some form of shield or wall; GMs please note that only rarely would food have more than DR 1 or 2.\n\nShape Food Regular\n\nAuthor: Elizabeth McCoy and Walter Milliken (From Student's Guide to New Magical Opportunities at Illuminati University, Pyramid 32)\n\nSecond Stomach Regular\n\nThis spell allows the subject to eat or drink a normal amount of food but not digest it or absorb it in any way until the spell ends. The subject can also voluntarily and easily regurgitate the at any time before the spell ends. This allows the mage to eat or drink poison, hold it for a time, and then quietly purge it with no ill effects.\n\nSecond Stomach overrides the Complete Digestion spell until the subject wills that spell to take effect. Poisoned Food (including the Lethal Food spell) does not affect a person with the Second Stomach spell until the Second Stomach spell ends or the subject wills the food to be digested.\n\nThis is also a Body Control spell.\n\nSpeed Preparation Regular\n\nThis spell greatly speeds the chemical and biological processes involved in food preparation, allowing foods which normally take a long time to prepare to be readied in minutes.\n\nThis spell accelerates normal reactions by a factor of 100. For example, bread dough that would normally rise in 2 hours (120 minutes) would rise in 1.2 minutes. Pickled foods that take 3 months (90 days) to finish, could be readied in about a day, and dry beans that take a day to soften in water will be readied in about 15 minutes.\n\nThis spell can also be used to speed the production alcoholic beverages or cheese, but the Fermentation or Cheese spells are much more reliable. This spell only accelerates the action of existing biological or chemical reactions. The quality of the final product is limited by the mage's skill (either Cooking, Brewing or Distilling as the case may be). If this spell is cast on food that has harmful chemicals or bacteria in it, the food will rapidly spoil.\n\nThis spell may also be used as a prerequisite for the Decay Food spell.\n\nSpice Jet Regular\n\nAuthor: Elizabeth McCoy and Walter Milliken (From Student's Guide to New Magical Opportunities at Illuminati University, Pyramid 32)\n\nSustenance Regular\n\nThis spell automatically creates food or drink of an identical type in certain place at the same time each day. For example, the mage could use this spell to have a pot of fresh coffee in his coffee pot each morning, or to fill a bowl with food or water for an animal.\n\nIf the food created the day before is not consumed, it will magically disappear when the new food appears or when the spell ends, leaving the container clean. If the container in which the food or drink is to appear is moved from the general location specified when the spell is cast, or if it is destroyed, the spell fails until a suitable replacement is found or the spell ends.\n\nThe mage specifies what sort of food and drink he wishes to create, as well as its time and location of appearance.\n\nFood and drink created by this spell can never be changed once the spell is cast. In addition, food or drink created by this spell will vanish if not consumed before the next meal appears or if the food or drink is removed more than 5 hexes from the location to which the food was summoned.\n\nThis spell was designed to allow a solitary mage to feed and water the livestock on his estate and the experimental animals in his lab when he was away.\n\nSummon Food Regular\n\nThis spell summons food to the mage's location from the nearest source within 1 mile. If the mage specifies, he can exclude certain known sources or types of food.\n\nIf no edible food is in the immediate area the spell brings the nearest thing to a suitable meal that it can find - leaves, carrion, bark or a live animal still on the hoof! Roll one die. On a roll of 1 the spell brings a live animal or similar object that needs a lot of preparation before it can be turned into food. On a roll of 6 it brings something inedible and foul. Otherwise the amount that the skill roll was made by determines the quality of the food.\n\nThe mage can exclude known sources of food if he specifies them before he casts this spell. In an urban area, larcenous mages use this spell whenever they wish to order \"take-out\" food.\n\nSweet Lotus Special, resisted by IQ-2 or Will-2\n\nThis spell imbues the target food with the essence of the legendary lotus. Any being (save the caster) who sees the ensorcelled food feels a strong urge to eat it unless they can make a Resistance roll vs. IQ-2 or Will-2 (whichever is worse) to resist.\n\nThe GM should roll vs. the subject's resistance in secret, and then give the unlucky victim very strong hints that he should try the food (i.e., \"The food looks delicious, and you are suddenly reminded that you are very hungry.\") rather than just forcing the character to eat the food.\n\nIf the subject eats the food, it will taste utterly delicious. However, he must then make another resistance roll, as above. If he fails, he will suffer from the effects of the Ecstasy and Loyalty spells, as if the mage had cast successfully cast those spells on him.\n\nThe duration of the Ecstasy spell is normal, but the Loyalty spell will last 6 hours.\n\nTaint Food Regular, resisted by HT\n\nSimilar to the Poison Food spell, this spell causes harmful bacteria to grow in food and drink, making anyone who eats the food very ill.\n\nApproximately one hour after ingesting the tainted food or drink, the subject must roll vs. HT or suffer from intestinal distress.\n\nVictims who fail their HT roll, suffer from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps. Treat this as Seasickness or Space Sickness, depending on the situation.\n\nIn addition, sick characters take 1 point of damage and are at -2 to ST, DX and IQ, and skills based on those attributes.\n\nOn a critical failure, the character takes 2 points of damage and fouls himself. Until he can bathe and change his clothes, everyone reacts him at -2.\n\nThe illness passes 3d hours after it starts.\n\nThis spell can also be used as a prerequisite for the Decay Food spell.\n\nTasty Regular, resisted by Will\n\nThis spell makes food and drink look incredibly tasty. Anyone who tastes even a morsel of the food must roll vs. Will or eat until they are sated. Characters with Gluttony are at -4 to resist.\n\nThis spell can't make foods which the subject wouldn't normally eat appear tasty to him, for example, hay couldn't be made to appear tasty to a human, but it would look delicious to a horse. Likewise, the subject gets +4 to Will to avoid foods which he knows will adversely affect him in some way (by aggravating a food allergy or making him break a Vow, for example).\n\nNo bonus to Will is allowed if the dangers of eating don't seem serious or immediately obvious. For example, a character wouldn't get a bonus just because he was trying to lose weight or because he suspected that someone might be trying to poison him.\n\nThis is also a Mind Control spell.\n\nTrencherman Regular\n\nThis spell will allow the subject to eat and drink as much as he wishes and not suffer any ill effects from overeating. However, the food and drink will have their normal effects in all other ways. Food still has calories, alcohol still makes the character drunk and poisoned food still harms the character.\n\nIf the subject uses this spell to drink to excess he could very well kill himself with alcohol poisoning!\n\nThis is also a Body Control spell.\n\nTrue Cornucopia Enchantment\n\nAllows any container to continually produce food of any type or variety with which the mage is familiar.\n\nThe enchanter sets the amount, type and assortment of food to be created when he enchants a True Cornucopia. The food produced is real and permanent (i.e., it will not disappear after one minute like ammunition created with the Cornucopia spell), but it will disappear if it is left in the container for long enough that it begins to spoil.\n\nNormally, the cornucopia will produce just enough food to fill itself, and someone must touch it and concentrate for a moment to produce more food (up to the maximum amount which can be created per day). If a large quantity of food is produced, it will magically \"flow\" out of the container into the surrounding hexes in such a way that the food remains wholesome and good.\n\nOnly food items may be created with this spell.\n\nEnergy Cost: 10 per 1 lb. of food created per day.\n\nWater to Alcohol Regular\n\nThis spell turns water to beer, sake, mead or any other alcoholic beverage the mage is personally familiar with up to 5% alcohol content (10 proof, or Alcohol Rating 1). Wine (up to 15% alcohol, 30 proof or Alcohol Rating 3), and distilled liquor (up to 70% alcohol, 140 proof or Alcohol Rating 14) can also be produced, but in smaller quantities.\n\nThe beverage produced is only as good as the water used to make it. Ditch water produces inferior brew, pure spring water produces excellent drink.\n\nThe quality of the final product is determined by the mage's Brewing or Distilling skill.\n\nWagh Nakh\n\nOf the Jungle\n\nWhile on an expedition in Amazon scientist Dolph Steyr and his sister were killed by Illegal Loggers, leaving their baby son isolated. He survived as a feral child by learning to surviveand talk to beasts. An unusually intelligent race of beasts raised the boy, who eventually discovered he had the bestial ability to transform.\n\nYears later, Bishop Juan, a local cleric, found a wounded Wagh and took him in, educating him in the ways of survival and the world through non-spoken language. After Bishop Juan's death, Wagh became a Jungle Adventurer, aiding nature.\n\nPowers\n\nWagh possesses superhuman strength and is a “Class 75” brick. He continues training to lift even greater weights, and the uppermost limit of his potential remains unknown.By and large, Wagh is impervious to injury, pain and disease (that he has met so far); his skin is capable of withstanding extremes of temperature, as well as tremendous stresses and impacts without puncture wounds or lacerations.\n\nWagh possessed the ability to move at superhuman speed and superhuman metabolic vitality. He can run in excess of the speed of sound, and thanks to his beastly stamina can maintain this pace almost indefinitely.\n\nWagh possesses a superhuman healing factor derived from that of the mutant ********* that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his cellular structure at a rate far greater than that of an ordinary human. As such, he can regrow severed limbs or vital organs. The speed at which this healing factor works varies in direct proportion to the severity of the damage Wagh Nakh suffers. This healing factor also affords Wagh Nakh a virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced resistance to diseases and an extended life span. Unlike ********* s natural healing factor, Wagh Nakh’s is mentally driven to a partial extent.\n\nNight vision, leaping ability, and bestial cunning. Which he developed his power independently. He had an empathic relationship with the beasts that raised him, and could communicate with them.\n\nHis animalistic mind seems possessed of a natural protection against telepathic probing or assault. Due to the specific activity in the brain Wagh, he has a high resistance to attack by telepaths.\n\nSynaesthesia combined with low level empathic and precognitive abilities. Specifically he gets psychic impression in the form of sounds, tastes smells etc. from objects, both inanimate and living. In other words, he can \"hear\" colors and \"see\" sounds and so forth. His distinctive interaction with the world makes him a uniquely perceptive investigator.\n\nSeeing the colors allows him to predict the movements of people and their intent, knowing exactly when to strike to maximum efficiency. This allows him to dodge bullets and excel in hand-to-hand combat. When something blocks one of his senses, as they are linked, Wagh can 'shift' them to compensate.

Men clad in iron joints patrol the area, food is scarce. Working as a child laborer he wished for the day that he would get back at his baseline oppressors, this was at a time where can only move dust bunnies with tremendous exertion of effort. His mother was stationed in the labor camp brothels, he would often see firsthand the savagery of the baseline apes. Not surprisingly mother went insane shortly after, so being the boy that he is he had to take care of her. Food, shelter, and mental support. That means near 24 hour care of his mother, from getting her dressed, to feeding her, to putting her through grueling physical therapy. This happens every day, like clockwork, in the home shared by Fla and his mother. There have been sacrifices needed because of this.\n\nBread scraps and ground puddles are his nourishment, his only companion are strings taken from the dead slaves. He trains everyday to move it, sometimes he watches them 'dance'. Life was less than stellar when he is given a number from birth, #132829 but because he is illiterate he just calls himself Avo. It was the time before he develops a form beyond the baseline monkeys, this was the time where he would often get exploited for stupidity and used as a recreational toy by the guards and the slavers alike. His fate was an inheritance from his own race, but the pain reminds him of his goal.\n\nMother died shortly after and life became empty, with that void Avo focused all the time to himself.\n\n“Like the pain of a bad wound, the effect of a deep shock takes some while to be felt. When a child is told, for the first time in his life, that a person he has known is dead, although he does not disbelieve it, he may well fail to comprehend it and later ask--perhaps more than once--where the dead person is and when he is coming back.”\n\n― Watership Down\n\nTraining on free time and 'learning' from other slaves whom are mutants from different walks in life. Some are native to the island while others may come from abroad, sometimes the guards are chatty and in-between their slurs there are shards of insight that can be assembled into a large pool of knowledge. He can now 'reinforce' the string and 'connect' them with other strands of thread. His first glow of creativity was to garrote one of the guards to prevent the molestation of a fellow slave younger than he was, Avo was surprised at how well the string went through the neck. The experience brings him more time to try more things in the extermination camp, being useful to avoid suspicion and keeping out an eye for innovation.\\\n\nAppearance\n\nTBA\n\nPersonality\n\nTBA\n\nPower [for mid-tier metas and above]\n\n“He fought because he actually felt safer fighting than running.”\n\n― Watership Down\n\nFlavio's mental powers include psi blasts, telepathy, mental illusions, strong telekinesis (omega level), mind control, mental force fields, and the ability to drain others' life forces. The full extent of his powers are not truly known. He has used his telepathy to read conscious thoughts as if they were spoken and cast images into the mind. His mental illusions made others almost believe that he was Charlie Chaplin. His telekinesis has been used to choke animals, throw several objects as weapons, disassemble a snowmobile, and even create a small blizzard with fallen snow. Flavio has used his mind control to freeze others in place and even make policemen turn their own weapons against themselves. Flavio's force fields have shielded him on both a full body and molecular level. Finally, he has drained the life force from his own teacher and the bishop who \"adopted\" him. Weaver can do this by ensnaring his victims within his wires. The more life force he drains, the more he increases his natural strength, endurance, reflexes, and recuperative abilities, while enabling him to disrupt nerve centers to cause pain and paralysis, and sear into the flesh of his victims.\n\nthe abilities, tasks, or traits these thought forms are subject to the thoughts of the creator.\n\nHis other specialization is Thought-forms/Tulpas. A thought-form is a clump of psychic energy that is programmed by its creator to perform a specific act or carry specific information which can then act upon the psychic field of others. They go by various names, such as psiballs or constructs but they are all basically the same thing. These thought-forms can affect others mentally or physically, but they are quite resistant to force directed against them. His thought-forms has the ability to turn their body into an strong psicrystal substance (much like that of diamonds). In this form, they are almost impossible to harm. When psicrystallized, they can also absorb energy without harm and increase its intensity, or deflect hostile energy blasts. Weaver could read the minds of Tulpas and control them, and could for a limited duration transform two species into a singular mutant with the greatest strengths of the two species it came from. In any case, the substance can be made as flexible or as rigid as he so desires. The substance is presumably as durable as the strongest man-made metals in existence. In combative situations, Weaver will fashion his Thought-forms into swords, shields and/or a protective suit of armour that fully encases his body. When fashioned into armour, the Tulpa retains its durability despite the fact that it doesn’t constrict or hamper his movement at all. The armour in itself has astounding properties, the least of which is that it acts as a second skin, with a senses of touch similar to Weaver' own flesh. He can also do partial transformations, such as covering his entire body in the psicrystal chainsaw chains.\n\nBilocation, the ability of an individual to be present in two different places at the same time. He can be present in more than two places at a given time. Multilocation is used to describe this feat of endurance. Bilocation is a physical, rather than spiritual, phenomenon, and a person experiencing it is supposedly able to interact with their surroundings as normal, including being able to experience sensations and to manipulate physical objects exactly as if they had arrived through natural means\n\nDemo-optical perception (\"bio-introscopy\"), the paranormal ability to see with the skin, often demonstrated by reading print or perceiving pictorial images or colors with the tips of the fingers shielded from vision, with their noses, or even with their feet.\n\nHe has also used his powers to create a \"cutting\" effect by refining the force of the wind. Compressing the air enough to slice through objects like rock or metal, also being able to create a vacuum suction that draws nearby objects ( attracts). Generate a vortex of wind, on par the power of a gravitational vortex.\n\nPsicrystal variations [for strong humanoids]\n\nPsicrystal is a type of crystal made by Flavio, both as a building material and as a form of computer system. The Psicrystals are activated upon exposure to psionics, whereby they begin growing, sometimes forming structures. They may also take on the properties of other stones near them at the time they begin growing. It is self-replicating and architecturally programmable.\n\nAmethyst: The purple psicrystal can help anyone who wants to open up their psychic powers as it activates psychic ability, enhances intuition and opens up spiritual awareness. Amethyst also contains powerful, protective properties and can help to protect a person from psychic attack.\n\nClear quartz: This psicrystal is known for its powerful healing properties, and its ability to amplify thoughts and energy. For this reason, it can help to enhance both your psychic and healing abilities.\n\nFlourite: Flourite has a reputation for opening up psychic abilities rapidly, it needs to be used with respect and caution. This psicrystal can help to cleanse and strengthen the aura and neutralize negative energy.\n\nObsidian: This powerful black psicrystal is strongly protective and able to provide a shield to deflect negativity and psychic attack. It helps to open the mind to new possibilities and encourages the development of strength and compassion.\n\nHe employs a number of hovering Psicrystal-drones to keep his face from being photographed and to ward off enemies. The drones can link together into larger objects, fire laser blasts, and respond to his mental commands. They were capable of independent action as long as Weavers powers was active, and had built-in image inducers. Flavio can possess up to ten drones.\n\nPsicrystal Servitor [for abominations]\n\nHeight\n\n76 meters\n\nWeight\n\n41,000 tons\n\nBesides an array of swift physical attacks, some of his special abilities include shooting telekinetic beams from his 'third eye' and breathing ice and wind. He can fire Psicrystal shards from his tail, has incredible agility, and attacks with incredible ferocity. He fires a powerful Prism Beam from his mouth, but his most devastating attack is the ability to overload his heart and cause a huge shock-wave that blasts everything around him, dealing incredible damage.\n\nAgile, an incredible jumper/leaper\n\nCan run extremely fast on all four legs\n\nFires the Cracker Stream, a barrage of exploding psicrystals, from mouth\n\nShoots Energy Spheres from tail\n\nHas an adverse effect on the fabric of reality and the energy flow of his surroundings\n\nRygar also has Tactile Telekinesis which is the ability to use telekinesis to enhance strength, speed, durability, agility, reflexes, stamina and combat skills simulate Superman-level evels. This can also be used to manipulate objects that are on the same surface as the user (such as the ground) or to fly by pushing their own body through the air (this usually requires effort though). The tactile TK field also lets Rygar break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away. Other creative uses include rendering an opponent immobile by extending the TK field as long as they are both standing on the same ground.\n\nHeight\n\n98 meters\n\nWeight\n\n78,000 tons\n\nTBA\n\nHas an adverse effect on the fabric of reality and the energy flow of his surroundings\n\nPsicrystal Pyramid [team oriented stuff]\n\nPersonal experience reveals several unique and beneficial qualities that may be derived from Pyramid Meditation. Flavio Forteana relate profound results in his quest for expanded awareness. He felt that psychic powers are stimulated or heighten by the use of pyramids. Psychics who use pyramids in that fashion have achieved an altered state of consciousness more rapidly than the more rapidly than they would have otherwise. Many users claim increased memory recall, visions of past incarnations, telepathic communication and an expansion of awareness.\n\nA pyramid is a natural psychic amplifier. Any mental energy put into it will be amplified and sent out. That is why this fact makes the pyramid an excellent device for projection. Its projection is very simple. It can be used to to project an effect onto someone or something. Pyramid energy is so powerful and strong that it alters the hydrogen bond in water. For sharpening razor blades and cutlery, the Pyramid Generator is being used for thirty years. Worldwide research and reports reveal that after a few hours exposure, the pyramid also preserves and enhances the quality of foods. It neutralizes bitter tastes.\n\nThe flavor of stale orange juice and other liquids is refreshed. It increases the natural healing potential of the body. Moreover, enhances the ability of subconscious mind to heal the body. Place a glass of wine inside a pyramid and another glass in a separate room. Wait 40 to 70 minutes and see. You can taste a difference in the two. It has been proved that it re-stimulate the fermentation process. In this way, you can turn cheaper wine to more expensive tasting wine.\n\nPhlogizein: Bane of Gods [for cosmics]\n\nUnit type: mecha\n\nArmament: ???\n\nPilot: Flavio Forteana\n\nThe Phlogizein is made up entirely of Psicrystals, nanite-like particles that can reproduce, repair themselves, generate energy and even gain sentience in large quantities. Because of this, the mecha constantly generates its own power without any fuel requirements. Its Quantum Pulse Engine simply harnesses the waves of energy that the crystals constantly radiate. The Phlogizein can also repair itself when damaged, due to the crystals' reproductive nature, but despite this property, the unit itself cannot be mass-produced. A restraint device on the Psicrystal prevents the Phlogizein from reproducing itself more than four times.\n\nThe mech appears to need a direct connection to the mind of the operator as when Weaver starts it up, two rods are drilled into his head, removing themselves when the mech is not in use. The pilot can \"feel\" what the mech is doing. It is said that the suit can be operated in full darkness, by a skilled driver, by \"feel\" alone. Its main armament are two 203mm autocannons attached to its arms.\n\nis infinitely-programmable and configurable, allowing it to modify itself into whatever shape and size (of course limited by the quantity of \"Psi-energy\" present) the user desires, as well as integrating foreign substances and materials into its infrastructure (such as \"Warpstone\"). It can also self-repair itself: constantly regenerating lost portions of its \"Psicrystal\" exterior at frightening speeds, and replacing it with consistently more durable versions. Its durability was sufficient to force a\"Space God\" to use a full-power blast of macrocosm burner to destroy a major portion of the mech.\n\nIndependent Operation - The mecha is capable of operating without a pilot, generally due to a built-in AI.\n\nRepair - The mech is equipped with the supplies to perform quick and dirty repairs to other units in battle.\n\nRefuel - The mech is equipped with the supplies and equipment to quickly resupply another unit's ammunition and batteries.\n\nCombine - This mecha may combine with another mecha to form another, generally dramatically superior unit.\n\nSeparate - The natural opposite to Combine; the mecha that has Separate is comprised of several different smaller mecha, and it is possible for the combined unit to split up into these smaller units at will.\n\nWill Field - The mecha possesses a special Will-fueled, often reality-warping barrier and attack-modification system, such as the Arbalest's Lambda Driver or Gurren-Lagann's Spiral shield.\n\nBeam Coat - The mecha is coated in a substance which nullifies some of the force of Beam-type attacks.\n\nImpact Coat - The mecha is coated in some form of reactive armor or substance, which drains energy in return for reducing the amount of damage suffered from ordinary physical attacks and impacts.\n\nGravity Barrier - The mecha is equipped with a barrier field generated by the warping of gravitational forces, making it especially powerful in resisting gravity-based attacks.\n\nPilot-Powered Field - The mecha is equipped with a barrier field system which is generated by some power inherent to the pilot him or herself. Only a pilot with a certain trait is able to fuel the systems which generate this field, and more powerful pilots are able to generate more powerful fields.\n\nBarrier - The mecha is equipped with a barrier field generator system. This particular barrier type has no bias to it; it stops damage no matter the type or source. However, because it is unspecialized, it consumes far more energy than other types of barrier.\n\nAbsolute Defense Barrier - The mech is equipped with a special, all-or-nothing type of barrier system.\n\nDouble Image - This mech possesses some means of fooling enemy sensors or pilots into aiming poorly. Perhaps the unit is so fast it leaves behind misleading illusions, or perhaps it possesses an advanced optical camouflage system, or possibly the pilot is simply a ninja.\n\nHP Recovery - The mech possesses some means of regenerating damage done to it constantly over the course of a battle - such as Dark Gundam Cells or Machine Cells.\n\nEN Recovery - The mech's internal energy batteries are constantly regenerating significant amounts of power, far in excess of the usual, trivial recharge that every mech is capable of over time.\n\nThe Phlogizein's most incredible feature is its ability to change its shape, depending on the nature of its opponents. It can take on a relatively small form, in order to challenge the human sized antagonists. This shapeshifting process, however, takes a lot of time to complete and cannot be done at will.\n\nIts secondary form of offense is a barrage of huge crystal missiles, sufficient to wipe out entire cities within moments of the bombardment, a laser-guided warhead, a stun device,an automatic rifle, a grenade launcher, as well as an optional flamethrower. From there, the Phlogizein relies on a particularly dangerous attribute of \"Psicrystal\": its ability to manipulate matter in the surronding environment, genetically altering the \"foreign\" material on an atomic scale and converting it into further \"Psicrystal\" constructs, usually in the form of either a field of crystalline stalagmites or that of ground vehicles and/or \"mecha\". It uses its Psicrystals to absorb its victims, using their mass to increase its own. These additional units are controlled by a command-broadcast device, which takes the form of a \"small but dense knot of circuitry near the mech's hub\". The whole vessel is manipulated by the \"pilot\" in the hub (a small, open space in the center of the ship), with the \"pilot\" connected to the Phlogizein through \"Psicrystal implants\" around the body, and seemingly operates through their thought-process.\n\nHas an adverse effect on the fabric of reality and the energy flow of his surroundings\n\nPhlogizein is unique to the multiverse. While Phlogizein is highly powered to guard Weaver, he cannot directly affect it in any way.\n\nAbility [for everyone]\n\nFlavio's weapon of choice is his thin neutronium monofilament wires, which he keeps hidden on a spool within his fingertips. It's almost invisible to the naked eye, and he uses it to tie people up, strangle them, hang them, grab weapons, knock weapons away from people, etc. He uses the wires to create a parameter, which can be used to detect enemies who cross through them. They can also be formed into melee weapons and constructs which Weaver can use, such as a spear that can be used to impale enemies. The wires can also be wrapped around his body as armor.\n\nHis wire can also form as the medium for the thought-forms to take shape, but it's still the actual thought-form. He can create psionic thought-forms using wires. He can elongate, shape and harden it at will into objects such as wings or a battering ram, and is also capable of rendering it transparent.\n\nThe Weaver's mind is like a top-notch organic computer, able to recall virtually anything he's seen, read or heard, perform complex mathematics unaided and accurately calculate how certain events will turn out. His predictions are often foiled by human unpredictability, or \"the x-factor\"\n\nWeapon [for mid-tier metas and above]\n\nCut a piece of thread about 10 inches long. Tie a wide object to it, like a needle, a toothpick, or a short piece of a wooden rod. Hang the string so that you can sit comfortably in front of the hanging object. Sit far enough away from the string so that you know you aren't making the object spin with your breathing. Let the object come to a complete stop, not turning at all in midair.\n\nA superstrong 'optical' fibre made of neutronium, neutronium is a type of matter found in neutron stars. It is incredibly dense (hundreds of millions of metric tons per cubic centimeter) and consists of neutrons sitting right next to each other. Neutronium could withstand massive forces and temperatures, making it suitable for starship armor on vessels that where able to fly though the outer portions of the stars themselves.\n\nThe wire is used to strangle one's opponent or cut (capable of slicing between atoms) into the flesh (never loses its sharp edge, even if it is used to cut through diamonds all day long for a thousand years), slicing through the arteries. Because it is easily concealable, silent, and deadly, it is often used for assassinations in situations when a gun is a not suitable option.\n\nFlavio's monofilament wires are capable of cutting \"between the photons of light,\" meaning that others can feel some attacks while desolid (phased). He can also emulate the effects of a Sherman Crab. The wires are also used to produce an instantaneous thought-form with psionics that attacks the enemy while having the ability to transform itself into numerous shapes.\n\nIt is also an ultrasonic/sonic driller/corer (USDC) able for acquiring samples from various planets or small bodies (e.g., asteroid and comets). The tip (drill bit) not does require sharpening, it can be made to operate at cryogenic and high temperatures, non-round cross section cores can be created and it can be used to probe the ground as well as deliver in-situ sensing down the borehole.\n\nUltrasonic and sonic vibrations are responsible for the drilling action. Piezoelectric stack actuator in the upper section excites ultrasonic vibrations that are transformed into sonic hammering action. The drill bit is forced to go up and down but it does not rotate. The impact of the bit into the rock performs the drilling.\n\nQuarkonium (Quark Matter) wires - TBA\n\nWeaver's wire is a psionic weapon capable of transforming into a wide variety of different weapons.\n\nMental Commands: The wire obeys the mental commands of the Weaver. When inactive it will link to itself in a spool so that it can be retracted to Weaver's finger compartment. When the Weaver wills it to do so it separates to form a multipurpose weapon.\n\nVariable Length: The wire is capable of psionically extending to greater lengths, it's upper limits are unknown.\n\nFlail: The wire's basic use is in the form of a flail whereby the monofilament edge is whipped around to strike targets at variable range.\n\nLasso: With the wire held at one end, the other can be used to ensnare a target in a manner similar to a lasso.\n\nFletcher: The wire is capable of separating into its component parts, which then each morph into needle-like blades. These then reform back into the normal strand and merge back into the chain.\n\nStaff: The parts in the wire can be stiffened, so that it in effect becomes a staff.\n\nSaw: Weaver can spin the wire at incredible speeds, essentially creating a saw capable of cutting through virtually any material.\n\nNet: It launches a web of his wire powerful enough to propel a target to the floor/wall and pin them there, viciously cutting through the flesh.\n\nIf the target tries to struggle the damage increases, and this keeps up until the subject is released or is killed.\n\nEquipment [for mid-tier metas and above]\n\nHis powers are further enhanced by his cyber trans-suit. The suit helps o focus his power and enhance it ten times it’s normal levels. He also carries wires which he can use to focus his Psychokinesis into deadly force threads. By focusing his power through the armor he also gains superhuman strength. He also employs his powers to make protective shields.\n\nThe fingertip forms the control-weight end of this monofilament whip, while the spool of monofilament is stored just behind and inside the fingertip. The fingertip weight also provides a handy piece to hold on to, and the cybercontrolled spool can release a vast length of monofilament for far-range cutting work. Simply loop the length of monofilament around the object to be sliced and pull.\n\nWeaver wears a suit of flexible armor which he can reshape according to his needs, even disguising it as normal clothing. The armor also emits a force field, and can release electric shocks from its gloves. Armor uses an x ray system to view through solid materials. It can detect infrared signatures within a half mile range. This armor can tie into government tracking systems to follow a target with seemingly unlimited range, or it can simply work alone, spotting significant airborne targets within a fifty mile range.The armor can identify a specific target by appearance alone, as long as it is within line of sight, even if the pilot has not yet identified him / her / it. This also has a one half mile range. The armor can track a target by his voice print, with an approximate ten mile range (it has tracked a single target through the city of Victoria).\n\nIt is a skintight bodysuit controlled by micro-circuitry and cybernetically responsive to the wearers thought waves. The psi-powered turbo jets on the wrists and ankles which provide most of the suit's abilities can either be smoothly retracted into the cuffs of the spinnerets (boots and gloves) or extend into their active circular fan modes. When wearing the armor, Weaver gets a boost of Class 200 strength, has superhuman reflexes, and can fly over mach 5000. Channeling the power of the suit through his spinneret can amplify the amount of force he delivers with a blow, creating \"hyperstrikes\" equivalent to Class 100+ strength. Focusing the power through his leg turbines allows him to stamp the ground hard enough to trigger shockwaves in his immediate radius. The turbines in his wrists can also be directed to fire compressed streams of air outwards, exceeding mach 100.\n\nWeaver is equipped with a belt that enables him to generate energy for various uses; primarily superhuman strength (punches) and flight.\n\nTK used to emulate gravitics to stabilize the wires.\n\nTrivia\n\nHobbies include making string figures and wire figures\n\nHis favorite warmup involves the jump ropes\n\nCold-spots appear in his presence\n\nuses captive bolt pistols for mercy killing sapes\n\n---\n\nKnights of Gastronomy - WIP\n\nKnight of Gastronomy/Knight de Cuisine\n\nExotic gourmands, these Knights of Gastronomy wage battle in the kitchen, striving for victory of the palate. Gourmands always experimenting with new foods and ingredients. Usually outlandish.\n\nA Knight's duty is not always found on a proper battlefield, fought by those noble members of a freehold who seek to bring the finest, rarest meals to the table. They must always top themselves, and each other. What else is there to do, after eating the finest meal you've ever had, but to make a better one?\n\nAnd so, these chefs and cooks and restaurateurs go deep, deep into the cosmos to the find the most exquisite ingredients, the most rare of fruits, and the most challenging of master chefs.\n\nPurpose: Be ultimate cooks using ingredients of the Cosmos.\n\nPrivilege: Tracking Those Tenuous Tastes (bonus to finding cosmic ingredients for a dish)\n\nJoining: Near anyone can attempt to join, but only those that have shown more than the basic competency are allowed to continue. Simple challenges, such as \"make your best potato dish\", begin the training- but then, more exotic dishes require more and more exotic recipes and ingredients.\n\nMien: The changeling's tongue changes, to become a unique symbol of her order and personal style. Further, there is an aroma of food; this qualities of this aroma, however, is psychoactive. Those that like the Knight smell a pleasant dish, and those that dislike the Knight smell a foul, mean concoction. As a symbol of their order, all Knights de Cuisine have white chef jackets. The times to be used and other qualities of these jackets are up to the individual, however.\n\nBackgrounds: Anyone can cook. But Knights of the Knowledge of the Tongue typically have a taste that was somehow refined, either in their mortal life or during their durance.\n\nOrganization: The Knights of Gastronomy do not give themselves over to a great deal of formalized organization. Each chef works as both competitor and cooperator with one another, forming intense rivalries and alliances.\n\nThe biggest way they separate themselves is by preferred school of cooking; many changelings possess different gifts for cooking depending on their natures, their skills, or their durances. A super-genius might be a gifted saucier, using intense molecular gastronomy to create chemically enhanced sauces. A super-strength with fists like ham hocks might pound his own flour (with those aforementioned fists), making for a hulking pâtissier. A Chirurgeon works as a cleaver-wielding butcher, while a Brewer whips up the strangest cocktails known to man and fae. A Muse works as a sommelier, a Draconic is renowned for his knife skills in the act of charcuterie (sausage-making), and a Fireheart rules the fiery barbecue pit like the king of Hell.\n\nAbove them all is the Most Eminent Chef, determined by which of the Knights of Gastronomy is most in tune with the weave and weft of fate . The Knights never speak the Most Eminent Chef's name, only calling him \"Chef\" or, in some freeholds, \"Sir.\" The Most Eminent helps distribute the talents of those within his order. After all, what good is a noble order of cooks if they aren't cooking for an audience? The Most Eminent goes among the Courts and offers the services of his people to the rulers for various celebrations and ceremonies. He also throws various celebrations himself, including, a vast experimental food and wine festival open to all changelings. It's a wonderland of flavors both miraculous and vile, and the lords over it. Depending on his personality, he might act the fickle gourmand or the glutton with spit-flecked lips.\n\nRome walks in on a kitchen in ruins, with blood and body parts strewn about, and automatically assume the kitchen staff have met a grim fate. So the classmates can still be fed, Alice, a novice cook, takes up food duties and immediately is overwhelmed by the amount of ingredients he finds and has no idea how to work with (this is depicted in a great scene where Rome looks around mouth agape in confusion as names of spices swirl around his head). He grabs a cookbook, gets to work on the cafetaria's dinner, and ends up making food so good that the College of Arcanobiology decides to give a recommendation letter to the Knights of Gastronomy, settling on giving a classmate the best last meal ever at an upcoming yearly death rite ritual exam.\n\nPerks\n\nA Knight of Gastronomy gains an instuitive knowledge of how to find ingredients in the cosmos, whether it deals with Hobgoblins, fruits, or any other element within the hedge. This sense is weakened slightly is the Knight does not know exactly what he is looking for. (He is a magic knight in this aspect)\n\nFood Manipulation: He controls meat, and likely other types of food.\n\nFood Summoning: he offers to his prize specimens cookies and cakes, those desserts seem to appear out of nowhere, also he summoned a giant chicken wing to fight against the undead, in the riot.\n\nCalzone Golem: A six foot tall creature that seems to be made entirely out of pastry. A few reddish smears mar its well baked crust. It looks like a doughy humanoid and smells of cheese and tomatoes. The calzone golem is a strange construct created through a delicate process that mixes alchemy and bakery in ways never before imagined by mortal beings. A calzone golem’s body is created from a mixture of fine ingredients, including approximately 100 pounds of flour, 50 pounds of cheese, four gallons of tomato sauce, and large quantities of salt, yeast, and sugar. Mushrooms, olives, or other ingredients may be added to the tomato sauce as desired. Season with oregano and black pepper to taste. All ingredients must be fresh and of the highest quality.\n\nCooking - For any recipe that the mage knows of, no matter how fancy, can be created as long as he has the proper ingredients.\n\nCreate Food - Cost is 1 per meal if the material was previously edible or was closely associated with something edible (e.g. bones, wheat straw, spoiled food). For 5 points per meal metallic items can be made edible, but they taste horrible. Unwholesome material (including poison) can be made safe to eat using this spell but it tastes terrible. An object which is turned into food doesn't change its properties in any way except that a person can chew and digest it - clubs still work as clubs, rocks still hurt if you throw them.\n\nDecay (Food) - Food destroyed by means of this spell is thoroughly ruined. It will smell and look terrible and will cause anyone who tastes it to suffer as if Retch spell had been cast on them unless they have the Cast Iron Stomach advantage.\n\nDistill - This spell can be used on hydrocarbons to create petroleum and similar products. This spell can be used to remove water from any food leaving behind a more potent residue, cane syrup can be turned into syrup, maple sap can be turned into maple syrup, soft-cheese can be turned into hard cheese, fruit can be dried and so forth. The quality of the resulting brew depends on the cooking or Distilling skill of the mage and the quality of the original liquor. This spell is also a Water spell. It is the weaker version of the Destroy Water spell.\n\nFerment - This spell can also be used on milk to make yogurt, cheese, koumiss and the like. Honey can be turned into mead. Pure, high-quality fruit juice becomes fruit wine. Diluted fruit juice becomes \"coolers\" or slightly fizzy fruit-juice with mild alcoholic kick. Grains become beer or ale. Sugar-water becomes a sticky sweet \"wine\" which can be distilled into pure alcohol. Other foods which rely on long-term chemical or bacterial action such as vinegar, gefilte fish, kimchee, or Tabasco sauce can be created using this spell. Distilled liquor or wine can be \"aged\" for about 3 months per application of this spell. In all cases, the quality of the beverage depends on the Cooking or Brewing skill of the mage and the quality of the ingredients he has on hand. You can't get good booze if you don't have good ingredients and a decent recipe.\n\nPoison Food - Purify Food will cancel this spell without destroying the poisoned portions.\n\nPurify Food - decayed portions of spoiled food are not removed but are instead returned to a wholesome state.\n\nSeek Food - The mage can specify what sort of food he is looking for.\n\nWater to Wine - If cast on low-quality wine or unfermented beverages this spell turns them into high quality wine.\n\nHe is obsessed with force-feeding his delicious food to subjects to fatten them up, believing that a log that is too fat to move can't get into trouble.\n\nFood is also a very important part of the lives of the Knights. They haven't gained their famous bellies by merely singing and dancing all day, after all! Cooking and meal-times have become an extremely important part of the culture, such to the point that most Knights learn to cook before they even learn their letters. It is said that the best cooks are Knights, but also that Knights are the best eaters. They commonly eat at least five meals a day.\n\nKnights will eat just about any edible thing that will grow around them. They are especially fond of vegetables, such as carrots and peas, which they will grow happily in their gardens. They also love giga shrooms and gold apples, and are overall very fond of things that grow from the hollow earth. Gardening is a very common Knight pasttime and, sometimes, occupation. Hobbits do eat meat as well, such as that of cattle and ram that they have grazing in their pastures, as well as dodos that cluck about in their front yards. However, fresh fruits and vegetables are commonly their favorite.\n\nKnights also have a taste for beer, and will happily drink down glasses of it, which they often do at parties and celebrations. Many Knights take great care in making beer, being sure to brew it so that it comes out just right, with the best flavor. Indeed, every bar and tavern is not always judged on how good the food is, how cute the waitresses are, or how quick the service is, but rather, how good the beer is that they serve.\n\nGreat chefs also make great poisoners. Poorly prepare the glands of the blackjack toad, and what do you get? A throat so swollen that it closes and kills. What happens if you \"accidentally\" leave in one of the teensy-tiny seeds found in those tongue-numbing pilfer fruits you can only seem to find at goblin market stalls? First a coma, and then when you wake up, boom, amnesia. The whispers say that the Knights de Cuisine started out as poisoners working for some king or queen, truly functioning as secret knights: destroying enemies instead of pleasing the papates of friends. Do the current Knights know this? Probably not. But some poisoners may still linger withing their brigade of obsessed chefs.\n\nOne of the group's secret goals is to find what they refer to as the Perfect Recipe. This is not an ambiguous list of ingredients, but supposedly an actual recipe that occasionally pops up in freeholds, a set of instructions that is said to have existed for hundreds of years. Some say it originated in France, others Tangiers, others still claim in Szechuan Province. Of course, nobody knows just what the recipe is. A mind-boggling dessert? A one-bite amuse bouche? Further rumors persist, suggesting that one bite from a meal prepared perfectly from the recipe is supernaturally sublime: Some say one's Wyrd might increase upon consumption, while other less pleasant stories claim that it's a quick way for a changeling to become one of the dreaded Keepers...\n\nWithin the noble order exists a kind of...sub-entitlement, a secret cabal of chefs who thrill at truly grotesque feats of culinary hedonism: hunting down lycanthropes to chill and eat their brains, drinking cocktails made from the blood of captured kings, making deals with Keepers to procure ingredients that are truly rara avis. Some say these lustful gluttons belong to a group called the \"Abbey,\" and it may have ensorcelled those who belong to its ranks.\n\nSpells [for cooking]\n\nCollege of Arcanobiology (A step above poisoner)\n\nCollege of Arcanobiological Studies\n\nArcanology - study and search of magical data, and artifacts, both lost and hidden.\n\nThe College of Arcanobiological Studies' main goal is the study of monsters (zoology), all the scientific community was running around the arcane squeeing, studying sorcery, vivisecting the arcane, and building the field of arcanobiology, and driving their best and brightest mad from it. Essentially a band of monster-hunters/xenobiologists. The demand of mythical bestiary organs forces the College to plunder from the healthy supply of workers at Hollow Earth. Arcanobiology is the detailed study of magical creatures and their role both within the world of the arcane and within nature itself. Also the study of living things with variant reality-state (r-state) components, or which rely upon sorcerous or other non-mundane elements in their biology. It is necessary to explain the transformation of a Deep One hybrid, to track and extrapolate the effects of Outsider Taint in genetics, and is used as a prerequisite skill for quite a few sorcererous procedures. The study is broad, unlike more narrow scopes such as dragonology, demonology, or diabolism.\n\nCollege of Arcanobiological Studies has a narrow focus: the study of the monsters that inhabit the world's vast wildernesses. Whether they work from the confines of their laboratories or the expanse of unmapped territories, Arcanobiologists are determined to learn all they can about the strangest creatures the world has to offer.\n\nArea of Study: Though this college considers any nonhumanoid monster worthy of study, each member tends to focus on either one kind of creature (such as nagas or sphinxes) or one aspect of monsters in general (such as internal anatomy or lair selection). Some Arcanobiologists spend their time in laboratories, dissecting specimens and breeding creatures in captivity.Others go out into the field to track and observe creatures in their natural habitats.\n\nOrganization: The College of Arcanobiological Studies consists of many schools, each devoted to a particular specialty, but there's no rhyme or reason to these divisions.\n\nSome schools focus on all aspects of a certain creature type, while others study behaviors common to many creatures. Thus, two different researchers-one from the school of chimeras and one from the school of reproduction-might both have reason to observe a mother chimera's lair.\n\nActivities: Unlike many of the other colleges, the College of Arcanobiological Studies actively solicits work from nobles and rulers who want to know more about the creatures within their lands.\n\nFor example, a noble might want to know how to drive off wyverns in the nearby forest without arousing their ire, or why the cattle in the Southern Dale keep disappearing. The regents field such requests, negotiate payment, then assign Arcanobiologists ofthe appropriate specialties to do the work. Most Arcanobiologists get at least one project a year this way.\n\nDistinctions: The college's motto is \"To know them is to know ourselves,\" although most members of the college would be hard-pressed to remember it.\n\nAn Arcanobiologist is likely to wear a brass armband festooned with a few scales, a feather, or a patch of fur from the creature he or she studies.\n\nAdmission: To be accepted into the college, a candidate must pass a written exam that covers the field broadly but does not delve into specifics. A new Arcanobiologist may work under a mentor for the first two years if desired.\n\nMembership Benefits: As with many of the other colleges, the primary asset this one has is its collected knowledge. Collegians are generally forthcoming about their discoveries, but they're sticklers for proper attribution. If a scholar first observed how dragons sharpen their claws, it's considered a breach of protocol not to mention him by name when discussing the topic.\n\nAs for his usual routine, he is a cook (use knives, wears gloves, wears white, good with hands) and a flesh pirate at the Talos Mill. He is the Flesh Pirate. He is a master of the bladed weapon and the knife-fighting trainer for the College. He can make a blade to seemingly appear out of thin air. He is a fit man and quick on his feet. He moves his blade even more quickly, even blocking bullets with them. He does his training in a meat locker where the carcass of dead animals act as targets. He is merciless and will kill anyone that crosses the College. He's covered with thick, ropey scars and pretty much every bone in his body has been crushed at least once.\n\nRule 1: \"you pledge allegiance to the College as your primary guild\"\n\nRule 2: \"Defeating metabeings. Any. For all reasons. Natural born or otherwise\"\n\nThe creatures studied include:\n\nDragons (Such as the great desert dragon or the dread dragons)\n\nGiants (such as trolls or titans)\n\nUndead (Such as strigoi, ghouls, spectres, poltergeist)\n\nPlants (Mandragoras, sheep trees)\n\nFey (Fairies, Roanne, Siabries, Undines)\n\nAnathemas ( Creatures made through sick experimentation)\n\nThe Extraplanar (Devils, Demons, Angels, et cetera)\n\netc, some creatures detailed will be a little hard to place in any category.\n\nReference books include:\n\nDraconimicon\n\nNecronomicon\n\nCodex Anathema\n\nLovestruck: A study of fey\n\nArcanobiology can identify the viviparous, omnivourous human-kin species in front of them.\n\nThey can experiment with genetic alterations, cybernetics and various other forms of body-alterations. It is located in it's own pocket dimension and it is not known if it was created by who, or if they somehow acquired it herself. The college does rule supreme in their domain however and it seems no higher entities control the events here.\n\nCubed World (CVnU Location)\n\nGeology\n\n\"The space-time around Qoobus appears to be distorted just as general relativity predicts,\"\n\nType: Planet\n\nOfficial Name: Qoobus\n\nLocation: On the center of the Castor Galaxy\n\nPopulation: Unrevealed\n\nCapital City: Unrevealed\n\nGovernment: Unspecified\n\nLanguages: Unrevealed\n\nNational Defense: Unrevealed\n\nPlaces of Interest: None identified\n\nDomestic Super Humans: None identified\n\nProminent Citizens: None identified\n\nSuperhuman Residents: None identified\n\nThe planet of Qoobus, Quadros in earthian English is cubical in shape It is sixty-third in a system of 96 planets and- has a population of approximately 258,264,789,000,000,000 inhabitants. It is a mysterious and mythical gigantic planet located at the exact center of the Castor galaxy. Unlike other known planets, Qoobus does not move around a sun. Instead there are several suns which orbit around it. In addition, Qoobus does not revolve itself; instead, the whole galaxy is driven around it. It is covered in greatly diverse enviroments and inhabited by many strange creatures\n\nA cube world with feature six square faces and only up/down gravity toward the centers of these regions. In moving closer and closer to the edge, it would feel like walking up an incline and it would be difficult to stand up straight because the gravitational pull would draw towards the center of the massive cube, which wouldn't lie directly beneath the feet. Standing on the “edge” of this cube world would feel like standing atop a mountain range. The only easily inhabitable places on Qoobus world would be the centers of the faces – one would have to walk uphill in every direction from the centers on an every-increasing slope, slowly passing out of whatever atmosphere existed.\n\nA star in the shape of a cube, orbited by a planet also shaped like a cube.\n\nSola is a super-intelligent stellar body that could analyze any attack and create defenses for it. Sola generates nova heat in plasma bursts capable of devastating planets. Sola could also generate microwaves and radiation, and distort gravity. It could also prevent others from traveling between dimensions.\n\nThe six faces would be completely cut off from each other. Six independent ecosystems on a single planet. A planet somehow altered into a cube that would have separate civilizations on each face, none of whom knew of the other’s existence, since it would be so difficult to ascend to the edges of the world that none of them had ever accomplished the feat. Six entirely separate ecosystems, evolving independently, with completely different inhabitants (different intelligent life forms). Besides being different physically, each intelligent civilization have totally different religions, and would have different social structures etc. One could explore six alternate ways of being.\n\nWhile such a planet couldn't form naturally, it is a practical choice for a novice world builder like the Hazard who wanted to experiment with ecosystems on a massive scale as sort of an experiment in evolution. 'Qoobus' started out spherical like any other planet but Hazard transformed it into a cube for the benefit of its inhabitants. The planet was already inhabited at the time he cubified it. He had to reshape the entire sphere without disturbing the fragile ecosystem on the crust. Terra-forming in a literal sense, physically altering the shape of a planet in order to terraform it. Yet Qoobus has very thick hazardous atmospheres as it is a sentient, tentacled planet that scours other worlds prior to cubing.\n\nWoe to anyone who lives close to the edge of a cube.\n\nAll six faces of the plant aces would boast temperate weather, centralized bodies of water and none of them would feature polar or equatorial weather. What’s more, the pointy edges of the cube would actually poke through the planet’s atmosphere like titanic mountains. The atmosphere goes up 1000 km above the Earth (when it is a sphere), and so is a sphere itself of radius 6400km+1000km=7400km. A cube with the same volume as the spherical Earth would have a side 10,000 km (6,400 miles) long so the corners are 8700 km from the center! They would definitely stick out above the atmosphere. So if you went on the tallest mountain on one side, you could see the world — you can see vast distances. You can sight down one edge of the cube to a far corner, a distance of some 6,400 miles. Even more strikingly, you see all the atmosphere and water has been concentrated by gravity into a blob in the middle of each face, with the corners and edges poking out into space.\n\nOn spherical earth the horizon on average is a little over three miles away. On cubical earth you can, see to the edge of the planet, potentially a distance of thousands of miles. Up the slope you’re standing on, impossibly far off, you can make out a gigantic mountain peak — one of the corners, you realize, of your cubical world. The path literally becomes steeper with every step — you’ll have the impression of climbing up the inside of a round bowl.\n\nThe tallest known mountain in the solar system is Olympus Mons on Mars, 14 miles high from base to peak. In contrast, the vertical rise from low point to high point on cubical earth is about 2,300 miles — the atmosphere gets progressively thinner until there’s none at all and you’re in the blackness of space. One consolation is that your weight steadily decreases. If you weigh 200 pounds at sea level back on spherical earth, you’ll discover when you finally reach the peak that you weigh just 103. The peak looks like the tip of a three-sided pyramid. The three sides fall away steeply — if you lose your footing you’ll have a wicked drop.\n\nThe planet isn’t one world but six, each face’s segment of the biosphere isolated from the others by the hopeless climb. The only comfort zones would be along the edges, all of which are connected for easy travel, and wildlife will rarely cross the cube planet's border.\n\nErno Core\n\nThere is is a body-centered cubic crystal structure in the core of Qoobus which forms a cube with atoms in each corner and a further atom in the middle of this cube, making it look like a Rubik's cube. It is oriented in such a way that its great diagonal is directed along the Qoobus's axis of rotation, which makes it possible for the iron to evince sound propagations with the velocities in seismic observations. In seismic observations, they found that elastic waves pass more rapidly through this core in directions that are parallel to the earth's axis of rotation than in directions parallel to the equator.\n\nThe thermic balance is dependent on the amount of heat that is stored in Qoobus’s core. This heat is dependent on the crystal structure of the iron in the inner core. This structure forms a cube with atoms in each corner and a further atom in the middle of this cube. It’s orientation is such that allows its great diagonal to be directed along the earth’s axis of rotation, which makes it possible for the iron to evince sound propagations with the velocities observed.\n\nSentience\n\n\"The planet seems to have strange biological defense functions.\"\n\nQoobus is the strangest planet in the sector. It's a world where the surface is covered by a single gigantic organism. Hazard slowly killed the creature as he terraforms the planet. He has converged it on a single dig site.\n\nQoobus, which is a living entity has the ability to shape the terrain of the planet with but a thought, and even the ability to mentally create \"anti-bodies\" to repel invaders (or to become invaders). Antibodies, in their nebula forms, possesses great power, including manipulation of matter and energy on a planetary scales, instantaneous travel across space, and the ability to hold a breathable atmosphere in their form. They can also shrink or expand her form as needed. They possessed the ability to take on humanoid form and memory. In humanoid form, she/he could turn into a living cloud with the power to fire lightning and mild telepathy. It can cause peaks of rock to emerge rapidly from the earth, large and swift enough to bring down an spaceship. I can also form immense holes in the surface of Qoobus. It can create a humanoid form for himself. In space, It can fly at great speeds and direct large swarms of meteors. It is covered with vegetation, which it could control and physically manipulate. With a command of sorcery and wizardry. It could project powerful bolts of magical force, confront others on the Astral Plane, and mesmerize others. It could absorb the life force of victims which it had entranced. Its tentacles can plunder other worlds.\n\nQoobus is an 'infant' planet and is still undergoing development, as it continues absorbing and assimilating debris, gradually growing larger and larger. Hazard's computers calculate that in given time it will eventually be many times larger than earth's sun. Soon it will be nearly 11 times larger than Earth’s.\n\nSchema\n\nIn the process of sending the 'creature' back into the dig site Hazard had to create them in the first place, Upon arrival in the planet Hazard was awe-struck at the surface which was overrun by a massive fleshy infestation of an aggregate being which consumed everything in its path. The deluge of meat that extinguishes individuality by the virtue of bio-fusion, It was an angry flood of tremendous proportions. Wiping out several lifeforms, sending many others into hiding behind their powers. Even a single glancing touch would prove fatal, in a way that will drown the specimen in an orgy of agony. An abstract spasm that covered nearly the entire planet, in 'scabs' it was a weapon which attacked the planet as it was deep in slumber.\n\nHazard had came on the 36th day after the initial outburst, in truth he did not cared for the odd planet. Yet this endless stream would provide him with tremendous training potential. Within three whole days Hazard worked relentlessly to expunge the bio-armageddon that had previously eroded life. He limits himself to only his vision capabilities, with even more restriction that is placed specifically on thermal vision. Focusing the fury of solar heat to shave off the infestation, Each day resulted in surgical precision as the infestation had also retreated into the bowels of Quadros. Yet he did not falter, and burning rays cut through several layers of planetary crust.\n\nWhat was once an infinite expanse to the horizon retracted into several hundreds of thousand of miles, which eventually shrank into a hole that can be seen from space. Indentations made by punches, so far there are a total of 21 indents located across the sides. They became markers in which he can safely monitor each area. The consciousness of the planet awoke from the sudden loss of life, and it met the super cyborg.Hazard then proceeds to create paradise on Qoobus and guides the survivors towards the next level of evolution as part of an interstellar community. Hazard family takes over the Qoobus in order to bring order at the “molecular” level and the does just that.\n\n(If you want to make a location in this thread go ahead, pm first)\n\nUnderhive\n\nHazard dug very deep pits to create livable environments due to the increased air pressure at the bottom and the greater heat to perform his own genetic experiments. He has mastered the art of changing the structure of living things to his suit his whims. He has also mastered engineering, which he uses to create his tools of mutation. This is where Hazard tinkers with the available lifeforms or create 'monsters' to entertain himself, so far he is in the process of creating new races.\n\nCircuitry throughout its quadrants allowed it monitor every part of his being. This circuitry fed into a central data processor that operated as Underhive' brain. It is armed with gravity disruptors that could rupture a planet’s core\n\nDr Rubix\n\nDr. Rubik was a scientist who experimented with genetic manipulation in unborn children. He apparently possessed no superhuman abilities, but is a genius in the fields of biochemistry, genetics, and cloning. He's an expert in social erosion techniques, martial arts as applied to whole societies.\n\nHe has 5+ years experience in the military, law enforcement or security work. Excels in hand-to-hand combat. Proficienct in all of the following: mixed martial arts, karate, kung fu, judo, jujitsu, kickboxing. Adept at handling both tasers and scalpels\n\nDr. Rubik is chosen from Hazard's personal collection to oversee the evolutionary developments that take place on Qoobus.\n\nI-Life\n\nMicroscopic artificial life forms. Inhabit a small, synthetic planet Qoobus. 1.21. \"A nano-species. A prototype miniature slave race with wide applications in microsurgery and genetic design. Bee-like in their simplicity; nothing much beyond a simple brain relay and a camera.\" Invented by Doctor Rubix. Take control of humans, which they turn into \"bio-ships\". Part of the character's transformation into a \"mindless living machine\". Takes the old concept of a cyborg and in essence links it to the a wireless network.\n\nMeditating Room\n\nWithin the consciousness of Hazard, the cyborg is is in meditation. No Incident. Enlightenment will continue without mishap. "
