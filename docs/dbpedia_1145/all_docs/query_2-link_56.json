        "text": "Friday the 19th of April, 2024, 8.05 pm. I’d just left Arcade Club, Blackpool – four hours before it was due to close. There were no problems – no crises.\n\nI’d enjoyed my soiree. I was fed, watered, arcaded and impressed. I certainly wasn’t tired. So why did I leave?\n\nI had a schedule to follow, of course. It was time for the second leg of my Arcade Overload tour. Destination: Arcade Club, Bury!!!\n\nTen minutes later, I’d selected my destination on Google Maps, slapped my phone into its car bracket, and eased down the slipway onto the M55. With the evening being so mild and clear, I was surprised to find the road so quiet. Pleasantly surprised. What wasn’t quite so pleasant was realising that most of the other drivers were weaving along at 120mph without bothering to indicate! Mirror, signal, manoeuver, people!\n\nThere’s no denying it. Compared to the M74, Lancashire’s roards are a bit on the ‘lively’ side. As the clock ticked towards 9 pm, and it became properly dark, the M61 was suddenly nose to tail… at 70 mph! I’ve rarely been more pleased to get off the motorway.\n\nWithin half an hour of pulling into my hotel, I’d dropped my luggage (not a euphamism), hit the pavement, and powered-walked the final mile to Cork Street, and Ela Mill.\n\nAs the clock struck ten, I was in and arcading again. And not just for the next two hours. The whole long Saturday shift was stretching out in front of me. Was it worth it? Well, let’s find out!\n\nIn today’s blogpost, we’ll take a look at what – for me – is the epicentre of the retro gaming world – Europe’s largest video arcade – at Arcade Club, Bury. We’ll cover all the bases – how to get there, where to stay, the other local retro-gaming ‘attractions’, and – most important of all – how to prepare yourself to make the most of your visit to ‘The Club’.\n\nGetting there\n\nWelcome to Bury, Lancashire – famous for its black pudding, its bus station and its Bobbies. Bury was the birthplace of Sir Robert Peel, the British prime minister who introduced the modern police force – explaining why, even today, police officers are sometimes known as ‘Bobbies’!\n\nGetting to Bury by public transport is easy enough if you live nearby. Lancashire, generally, is well-served by local busses, with greater Manchester – of which Bury is part – also enjoying an excellent tram network.\n\nHowever, if you hail from further afirth – like what I do – your options are a bit more limited.\n\nIf you’re travelling from Scotland, you’d be forgiven for thinking that a train to Manchester was the obvious best choice. Now, I’m a big fan of longer train journeys. I love the way they almost force you to relax – giving you the confinement, but also the space you need to read, listen to some music, stare out the window, or just snooze. I’ve made that journey a few times in the past. But in 2024, it simply doesn’t add up.\n\nFor one thing, over the past 5 years or so, the trains from Edinburgh (or Glasgow) to Manchester have pretty much doubled in price. These days, you’ll be lucky to get change out of £100 for a return ticket. And that’s not the only catch. You want to be travelling south. But once you get off the train at Manchester, you then need to find your way to the right tram stop, buy another ticket and head back north to Bury. It’s a nice enough journey, but it’ll add time and expense to your trip.\n\nAs much as we might want to do our bit for the environment, there’s no escaping the fact that the easiest, quickest and cheapest way to get to Bury from the frozen north – even if you’re travelling on your own – is to drive.\n\nIf that’s not possible, or you’re determined to use public transport, you’ll have to invest some serious time in planning the logistics. Your best bet is to get an advance return on the train to Preston, then use local buses to get to Bury via Bolton. At the moment, local buses in England cost no more than £2, which could add up to quite a saving. Of course, the big drawback to that way of doing things is time. You might spend longer hingin’ aboot bus stations waiting for connections than travelling. But at least it’ll take you back to being a teenager!\n\nIf you’re coming from the south… commiserations!\n\nDon’t worry, though, getting to The Club won’t be quite so awkward.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThere is no shortage of places to stay in and around Bury. Digs can be found to cater for all tastes – and wallets – especially if you don’t mind a bit of a commute.\n\nMost of the budget hotel chains have locations in or near the town itself. If you’re driving, and not planning on drinking, there’s a Travelodge at the retail park 10 minutes to the south. Last time I checked, it didn’t do food. But there is a massive supermarket within walking distance.\n\nIf, like me, you don’t want to be getting back in the car again before your 5-hour odyssey home, you’ll want something a bit more central. Something walkable. One of my favourites is the Premier Inn on Knowsley Street, just over 20-minutes’ walk away from The Club. If you avoid the major holiday weekends, and book in advance, you can usually get a family room for around £40 a night – give or take a tenner! They do an excellent buffet breakfast – for an extra charge – which is the ideal way to stock up on the nutrients and energy you’ll need to see you through a hard day’s retro-gaming! One thing to watch out for, though, is the parking. The closest secure parking is right next to the hotel, but it’s independently-owned. And the overnight fees have recently gone up to £12.50. Swings and roundabouts 😦\n\nRetro-gaming shops\n\nBury might be an old market town. But unlike a lot of similar places, it seems to be thriving. Despite the ever-ailing economy, there are very few boarded up shop-fronts, or ‘To(i)Let’ signs, and an acceptablly low proportion of vape-stores to other outlets. While there is – of course – a High Street, most of the usual chain-stores can be found in the adjacent Mill Gate shopping centre. If it’s ‘swag threads’ you’re after, the lion share of designer outlets are in the swanky new retail precinct known as ‘The Rock’, which strikes me as a strange name for such a swish location – it’s no Alcatraz! There’s also the world-famous Bury Market between the Bus Station (sory, ‘Interchange’!) and Mill Gate, to cater for all your other shopping needs, if those happen to include bags, leather goods, or assorted meat products (including black pudding).\n\nIf it’s retro games that tickle your fancy, you can avail yourself of the usual suspects. There’s a CEX between the Mill Gate and the Market, and a Cash Generator on the High Street, where you might sometimes find a distressed SNES or Megadrive cart (wet wipes are your friends here, high-street retro outlets). There’s also the ubiquitous Game in The Rock, where you’ll no doubt be able to source the latest Evercade cart, or mini-console of choice. A more interesting option – if you have the time – is Victor Wright Electronics. And you’ll certainly need time. While the selection of ancient electronics includes gadgets, gizmos, remote controls, video games – and much more besides – is huge, the filing system is, lets just say – eccentric. Goodness knows what’s at the bottom of those heaps. But you could luck out.\n\nArcade Club, Ela Mill, Cork Street, Bury BL9 7BW\n\nOK folks, I’m going to cut to the chase here. Come rain, wind, sleet, snow or sun, Arcade Club, Bury is hands down, without a doubt, by far the biggest and the best of the arcades of its type in Europe. I imagine you probably knew that already. For my money, it even beats Funspot NH, in the US and A – for reasons I’ll come back to later. In fact, if it wasn’t for a certain establishment in Brookfield, Illinois, I doubt there’s much to rival it in the entire world! According to the Arcade Club website, there are more than 400 classic and modern arcade machines, pinball tables, and games consoles on the floor!\n\nThe price of entry to this Aladdin’s Cave of electronic entertainment? A mere £18 of your earth pounds per adult per session. That means Thursdays 4 to 11pm, Fridays 6pm to midnight (adults only) Saturdays 11 am to 11 pm and Sundays from 11am to 8pm. Opening hours are extended during the local school holidays, with discounts for kids, families, and season tickets. I bought a month ticket for my epic trip round Blackpool, Bury and Leeds, which worked out as a nice saving over the cost of four single entires. Given what’s on offer, I’d say it was a bargain.\n\nI could easily spill a few thousands words describing the games in all their pixellated glory. But the truth is, the collection is just so big, so varied, and so constantly evolving, it’d be an almost unending task – the retro-games equivalent of painting the Forth Road Bridge! Besides, there’s such a huge and growing number of video walkrounds plastered all over the internet, that there’s not really much point. If you were being extra sensible when planning your trip, you’d check if your favourite games were goingt o be out on the floor by browsing the online games catalogue, and e-mailing to ask which venue they’re currently in. You never know, if your favourite JAMMA pcb isn’t in Bury, and you give them enough notice, they might be able to shuffle things about for your visit.\n\nTo avoid re-inventing the wheel, what I thought I’d do instead is focus on the layout and the feel of the place – and offer a few tips on how best to enjoy it.\n\nThere are currently four floors to the Arcade Club experience at Bury – a number which has doubled since its grand opening at Halloween 2015. From sharing its section of Ela Mill with several other businesses, the Club has gradually expanded to the point of sole occupancy and saturation of the building. You could say that Arcade Club, Bury, is now a giant ‘family entertainment centre’. But I would argue that the singularity of that description doesn’t do the place justice. The Club, you see, is not simply one arcade. In 2024, it’s at least five different arcades – each with its own distinct flavour.\n\nCompared to entertainment ‘compound’ at Funspot, NH, it may have a smaller footprint. But as I’ve discussed in a previous post, only one small part of Funspot is given over to Golden-Age video games. The rest of its expansive acreage (!) is packed full of ticket-redemption machines and other distractions. The American Classic Arcade Museum certainly has its charms, and is well-worth a visit in its own right. Compared to The Club, however, it just doesn’t have the numbers or the variety.\n\nThe most recent addition to Arcade ‘complex’ at Bury is on the ground floor. As you approach the reception to get your hand-stamped, you come face to face an all-new mini-arcade. I say ‘mini’, but by UK standards, the number of machines on the floor mean it’s actually quite ‘large’. In a way, it works as a showcase, giving a hint of the delights on offer further on and higher up in the venue. It hosts a small, but carefully curated seclection of classics, a few more-recent video games, a pool table, some rhythm games, and even a basket-ball machine – something for everyone.\n\nMoving up to the first floor, it’s clear that the selection has been tailored towards the younger demographics, i.e. Arcade Club: The Next Generation. This is where you’ll find the latest crowd-pleasers. From the absolutely-mahoosive Mission Impossible Super Deluxe, to Dark Escape 4D, Luigi’s Mansion, Centipede Chaos and various other big-cab behemoths. Throw in some air hockey, basket-ball machines, and a tonne of interlinked Egg Boxes (snigger) and PS5s, and there’s everything you need to keep the yoof happy.\n\nOnwards and upwards to the second floor is where you’ll find the majority of The Club’s rhythm and dance games, a large selection of the best new and classic pinball tables, as well as a few choice candy cabs and woodies hosting a range of old favourites like Defender and Robotron. As the second floor is where Arcade Club hosts it’s annual Defender Players Unite meets, there are, naturally, multiple examples of both. But that’s not all. The main hall on floor two boasts an ecclectic range of machines from the 80s, 90s and naughties. Nestled beside it, on the corridor leading to the stairs is a whole nother arcade! And it’s nothing short of candy-cab central. This is by far the largest collection of Japanese sit-down cabinets I’ve ever seen in a British arcade. OK, so they were never that common over here back in the day, but even in more recent times, this collection has never to my knowledge been surpassed in terms of the size or range of games on offer. The cabinets are set-up for both vertical and horizontal play, and house so many ‘bullet hell’ shooters of the CAVE variety, that I dread to think what the insurance premiums must be.\n\nThese first three floors are great. Between them, they cater for all tastes – from the smallest of kiddles, through the assembled ranks of casual gamers, to the most dedicated of arcade ‘enthusiasts’. But if your penchant is for classic arcade games from the 70s, 80s and 90s, you’re going to want to head straight for the third floor. Here, at the beating heart or Arcade Club, is where you’ll find its phenomenal collection of 200+ Golden-Age arcade games – covering all the classics in both dedicated cabinets and the obligatory phallanx of Electrocoin Goliath JAMMA cabs.\n\nAs at Blackpool, the machines are in excellent condition. None have been retro-fitted with horrifically anachronistic LCDs. Better yet, the CRTs and controls are regularly checked, and tuned for the optimal gaming experience. Even the cabinet art is finessed, where appropriate, to really bring the machines back to life, with new but authentic control panel overalys adorning most of the Electrocoin machines.\n\nFor me, this is what makes Arcade Club, Bury the mothership. It is the embodyment of what Alan Meades – author of Arcade Britannia – calls the ‘Mythic Arcade’ – except, The Club is… real? Well, that’s what I was going to say, but the more I think about it, the more it goes beyond what we’ve learned to expect from reality.\n\nIf we compare Arcade Club to our memories of the arcades of yesteryear, it’s actually ‘hyper-realistic’. It takes everything that was good and fun about those places, and doesn’t just expand upon them, but blows them up to truly incredible proportions. Not one of us ever saw a collection as impressive as this back-in-the-day. They simply didn’t exist. Yes, you would often see clusters of Goliath cabinets in a seaside arcade, sometimes even a couple of dozen in the one place, but you would never even hope to see 50 of them in one long row!\n\nNeither did we see the same range of games in any one place at any one time. For the operators in the fast-moving world of video-arcades in the past, it was almost always out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new. At Arcade Club, you get to enjoy the best of all eras, and recreate you own personal journey through the classics as you remember it. In theory, that’s great. But therein lies a problem.\n\nTop Tips\n\nFrom its origins as a small-scale business experiment (which you can read about towards the end of this post), Arcade Club has grown into a large and successful operation. The Bury venue attracts many thousands of vistors a month – sometimes a week. That means it can get busy. That’s particularly true on Saturdays during the day – when The Club has become a popular spot for families with smaller kids and childrens’ parties. From what I’ve see, it can get pretty frantic in the early afternoon on all three floors – but especially – on floor one and the ground-floor arcade. So maybe save them for later on in your visit!\n\nHaving said that, evening sessions can also be packed, but not usually equally across all floors. In my experence, floors one and two – which are more squarely aimed at the younger gamers – seem to be the busiest. So, once again, maybe save your exploration of those parts of the building until later on in the evening when the crowds start to thin out. Don’t get me wrong, the busy-ness brings a sense of life and vitality to the place, which really helps to build the ambience – but if you’re chasing hi-scores, it doesn’t always create the best conditions.\n\nWhat about floor three?\n\nIf your main reason for visiting Arcade Club is to indulge in the games of the Golden Age, the best time to go is Friday evening. It’s an adults only session, but tends to be quieter than the other floors anyway. Why is that? Perhaps it’s an altitude thing? Maybe the younger revellers get filtered out as they move up through the higher levels? Or maybe it’s got more to do with the types of game on offer. It doesn’t really matter. But there’s something else that does…\n\nIf you haven’t been before, or don’t go very often, the temptation will be to rush round looking for all the games you remember. Because they’re all on free-play, you won’t give a second thought to crediting up, or moving on if something else grabs you by the peripheral vision. Take it from me, even the most ‘enthusiastic’ of games is going to be overwhelmed by the variety of choice on offer!\n\nOK, if it’s your introduction to the place, and you know you’re coming back soon, that not necessarily a bad thing – but it’s possibly not the best way to make the most of the experience. What I’d suggest is you make out a list of, say, 8-10 games and plan to have a few goes on each. Set yourself a hi-score challenge, or join in one of the online competitions like 10 Pence Arcade Podcast V2.0 and do it that way instead. And for goodness sake, do yourself a favour and install the amazing Arcade Sidekick App on your phone so you can record it properly. That way, you can ease yourself back into the nostalgia sphere, and enjoy the games at the same time. You know it makes sense.\n\nFinally – and bear with me here, because it might sound a bit weird – if you’re an aging gamer, and planning on an arcade marathon, you might want to take some training gloves to support your wrists. Alright, OK, settle down. I’m sure your wrists are used to a workout. What you might not realise until it’s too late, however, is that underneath their shiney new overlays, Electrocoin Goliath’s have mild steel control panels. And even when it’s reasonably warm in the arcades, those steel control panels can stay cool or even cold – which inevitably transfers to your wrists. You don’t want to be risking carpal tunnel or sprained joints at your age, do you!\n\nI forgot to take mine last time, which is when it struck me how ossum it would be if The Club sold them in its shop. What they need to do are some weight-lifting gloves with the AC logo emblazoned on the front. I’d buy them as a souvenier every time. Merch FTW, baby.\n\nFood and drink\n\nArcade Club is an industry in itself. In addition to its five arcades, there are three bars and a shop, selling bar food, snacks and drinks – of a soft, and boozaholic nature – almost as fast as the staff can fetch them off the shelves. Like Blackpool, eveything on offer is of a good quality and reasonably priced. Unlike the other, smaller venues, as Arcade Club, Bury covers four floors, there’s also a lot more sit-down space to enjoy it. Take note, though: the large dining area on the third floor can get pretty rammed around lunchtime, so plan your eats accordingly!\n\nIf I had two very minor critiques, they would be this: Most people who visit The Club are there an afternoon out, or a party. And when you’re doing that, party food is very much part of the expected package. With its burgers, hot-dogs, pizzas, and nachos, the Arcade Club Kitchen does this very well. I get that not many folks are there for extended stays, but when you are, with The Club being a fair schlepp from the town centre, it’d be good if there were a few healthy alternatives on offer. Even just a selection of fruit. The same goes for the drinks. Both the range and the prices are great. Bottles of water are also available. But if you’re there for a long day or a couple of days, you’re gonna want to stay hydrated. Now, if The Club were to install some ‘water stations’ (extra taps) and maybe start selling branded water bottles, that’d be a win-win situation.\n\nEpilogue\n\nWhen you’ve been enjoying video arcade games for as long as I have – when you’ve lived through their heyday, lamented their demise, and spent decades seeking out the last living specimins in the wild – simply knowing that a place like this exists, is a source of comfort.\n\nI’ve already written about the almost spiritual importance of the CRT for the generation that grew up in the ’70s and ’80s. With its almost encyclopedic collection of historically important games, we’d have no problems considering Bury to be a leading museum of video-arcade heritage. But this is no silent and still temple to the quiet contemplation of times past. Neither can it be seen as a ‘necropolis’, where old junk has been dumped to rot or get flogged to death. The machines are so well-looked after, and the place so buzzing with life and vitality, nothing could be further from the truth. I don’t think it would be unreasonable to suggest that the place has religious significance. To really understand what I mean by that, you’d have to visit. Visit for yourself, so you can enjoy it and reconnect with your arcadey roots. But visit to make sure it stays open, and the experience stays available to the wider gaming community as it powers its way into the future.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Arcade Club, Bury? What are your favourite games? Please feel free to leave a note in the comments below.\n\nNext up: Arcade Club, Leeds!\n\nI’ve been ‘down Blackpool’ a fair few times over the years. When I think about it, my trips to the Lancashire Riviera have skimmed across the decades like a stone across a pond. To begin with, they were few and far between. More recently, they’ve come thick and fast. Or perhaps it just seems that way because of how old I’m getting?\n\nMy first visit to Blackpool was in 1977 on an ill-fated family holiday. I had not long turned 5. My parents, my younger brother, and me had taken the train down from Glasgow to stay in a guest house. It wasn’t like the BBC’s fictional Seaview with its high-larious haul of 7 Space Invaders machines (S01E03). Nor was it run by a young Yvette Fielding. The reality was a small, top-floor flat owned and managed by a grumpy old man. Am I being mean? Well, I wouldn’t like to suggest his fizzog turned the milk, but not long after arriving, we were all stricken by such explosive food poisoning, that we had to be rescued by a relative. Being the ’70s, there were no problems squeezing 5 passengers into a car designed for 4. Seatbelts were an optional inconvenience in those days. Fortunately, we survived both the lurgy, and the trip home, even if we didn’t see much of Blackpool that wasn’t toilet-shaped 😦\n\nBut that’s not how this story ends.\n\nBefore the decade was out, young Odysseus had returned to ‘see the lights’, experience the assault on the senses that was the Golden Mile, and visit the legendary Pleasure Beach. Were arcade video games a part of that picture? You’d better believe they were!\n\nSadly – as we all know – the shape of Blackpool’s arcade landscape – or arcadscape (c) if you will – has changed a lot since those halcyon days. And not for the better. In fact, if it wasn’t for the triumphant return of the CRT to the former Casino at 74 Bloomfield Road, its phosphor glow would already have flickered out. That’s right, folks. As you’ve probably already guessed, the final destination of today’s blogpost will be the latest addition to the Palmers’ Arcade-Club Empire – which will also serve as a starting point for my reviews of all three venues!!!\n\nBefore we hit ‘The Club’, however, we’ll get ourselves warmed up with a look around Blackpool and environs as they are now, checking out it’s other video-gaming delights in the process. It’d be rude not to. We’ll also nod a wink to the arcades of summers past with a comparison of my photos and arcade experiences from the last 10 years with some nostalgia-soaked shots from the archives. What more could you want?!\n\nStoppin’ at ‘Services for Photos\n\nToday’s story begins at 70 mph on the M74.\n\nI’ve been up an down that road many times since 1977.\n\nFor the first decade or two it was always as a passenger. Growing up in central Scotland, my family’s pursuit of the summer sun usually involved long road trips to the south. Unless the destination was somewhere down the East Coast of England, they would usually also include a long stretch on the M6.\n\nOf course, the roads themselves have changed over the years. After what feels like decades of ‘improvements’, the section passing Carlisle is a lot less prone to traffic jams than it was. That’s not to say it isn’t busy. In fact, once you pass the border, the traffic seems to spawn as if from some kind of arcade monster generator.\n\nThe M74 is still much quieter. But where once were views of serene emptiness is now an industrial landscape of mostrous wind turbines, whose massive concrete footings have permenantly scarred the bens and braes. Thank goodness that floating turbines are now a reality that can be kept out of sight, and easily removed if and when we come up with a better way to generate electrickery.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nOnce I’d finished tilting at windmills, it struck me that I was sitting at the helm of a red Vauxhall Zafira. Some folks, including my own son, don’t have much time for that brand of vehicle. I’ve heard it likened to a skip in lipstick. That always makes me laugh. In my mind, it’s easily closer to Magnum’s Testosteronza.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, I actually like the colour. I always have done. I thought that was for aesthetic reasons. But perhaps it was sub-conscious nostalgia for those ancient summer journeys that drove me to choose it.\n\nYou see, from about 1980, the carriage de jour in our family was a red Ford Cortina! What a car! It was both spacious and well-equipped. The stunning analogue sound system (an AM radio) worked during the day and at night. The sophisticated air-con facilities (roll-down windows) provided a choice of hot or deafeningly windy. Oh the fun we had, after hours in a sticky traffic jam, peeling our sweaty backs off the seats.\n\nOr maybe not.\n\nNaturally, my parents were keen to avoid that kind of thing on our summer road trips – and the inevitable squabbling it caused in the back seat.\n\nBy the mid-80s, they had perfected their solution. By the afternoon of the last day of the school in late June, our wee caravan – an Eccles Topaz no less – would be prepped, packed and ready to roll. But we weren’t quick to leave. Nossir, we’d wait until after tea to skip rush hour and beat the traffic. That was a sensible move 40 years ago. If they were heading into the chaos I’ve seen on the M62 recently, they might not have left the drive at all!\n\nOf course, even in the 1980s it wasn’t all plain-sailing.\n\nLet’s face it, driving through the night is never much fun when its part of a holiday. But when you were a kid in the back seat, there were some perks. Staying up late listening to the radio was one of them. Simpler times, eh? The other was when my parents pulled in at a service station for a break, or even a snooze. Because then my brother and me could buy ourselves a ‘grab-bag’ sized packet of Hula-Hoops, and hit the arcade!\n\nThere were no Motos or Welcome Breaks in those days. No Greggs, McDonalds or Costas either. The big names included (Top) Rank, part of the J Arthur Rank Foundation famous for its films, Granada, which also turned its hand to TV production, and Trusthouse Forte, who were perhaps better known for their hotel chain. Further down the A1, you might have enjoyed a break at a Blue Boar location. For a wealth of info and photos on this stuff, check out https://motorwayservices.uk\n\nOur first stop would usually be Granada’s services at Southwaite in Cumbria, or – if the going was good – Rank’s Forton facilities in Lancashire. Both were much of a muchness in my recollection, with well-stocked newsagents on both carriageways and – more importantly – arcades all round. I’m not talking about a couple of battered chip-shop cabinets here either. It’s easy to forget just how vibrant the arcade scene was in these places back in the 80s. Collections of 10 or 12 cabs or more weren’t unusual. There were always at least a couple of the most up-to-date games. And they were always busy too – whether it was 2 in the afternoon or 2 in the morning! Happy days!\n\nSouthwaite was where I first encountered the mighty Gauntlet on the way back home in 1986. On the way south, in 1987, it was where I first saw Karnov and Alien Syndrome. So what, you might ask? Karnov isn’t particularly well-known, and doesn’t exactly have the best of reputations. The thing is, though, while we were waiting to set off that day, I’d spent the afternoon reading the latest edition of Computer and Video Games magazine. And, obviously, in anticipation of the pixelated escapades that lay in front of me, I’d fixated on the ‘Arcade Action’ section. As you can see from the images below, those were the two headline games that month. Somehow I’d felt sure they’d be at the services, and lo, it came to pass. Wow! Maybe I’d ‘actualised’ the experience? You know? Like what that Jim Carey talks about on the YouTubes?\n\nMy memories of Forton are a bit hazier. Looking back, that makes perfect sense. In the early 80s, the place was filled with cigarette smoke. But when the smog lifted, it’s where I first saw classics like Centipede and Gorf. It’s also where – in 1981 – my Granny, who was holidaying with us that year, bought us a copy of the wonderful Trigan Empire compendium. The story is basically ‘Romans in outer space’, but the artwork, by Don Lawrence, is really something else – like a 1950s swords and sandals movie, but rendered in paint. It’s stunning, and well-worth a butchers.\n\nFast-forward to April 2024, and my Arcade Overload ‘tour’ (!). With the first stop being Blackpool, it made sense for me to drop in to Forton – for old times’ sake – of course, but also to top up on caffeine, ‘jettison excess weight’, and dial in the sat-nav for the final approach down the M55.\n\nTo be honest, the experience was not a happy one. Don’t get me wrong. As far as service stations go, these days, it’s got everything most people need. But it didn’t help much with my time-travelling mood-building. The Pennine Tower restaurant is now boarded up and inaccessible. It has been for a few years. There’s still a newsagent, ‘Whi-smth’, which still sells over-priced sweeties and comics, but there were no magazines I wanted to buy. Not even a Retro Gamer anthology. And the amusements area? Well, the less said about that the better. Slot machines were never really my thing.\n\nTo console myself, I grabbed a couple of sausage rolls from Greggs and continued on my way.\n\nBlackpool\n\nWhile my plan for the weekend was tighly-packed, I’d deliberately left a few hours free on the Friday afternoon before Arcade Club opened. Most of it was earmarked for a recce down the prom, and a whistle-stop inspection of its ‘arcadage’.\n\nObviously, I couldn’t possibly do that without sampling the local ice cream, chips and other ‘delicacies’. There are lots of opportunities for that in Blackpool, especially if Mr Whippy tickles your fancy. Be prepared, though – a lot of the vendors are ‘cash only’. When I’m off on my arcade travels, I also like to keep my eyes open for retro-gaming souveniers. With niche tastes, pretty much limited to cartridge-based ports of Golden-Age arcade games, I don’t usually have much luck. Out of my visits to retro-gaming shops, I’d be surprised if many more than 1 in 20 leads to a purchase. But that doesn’t stop me looking.\n\nBlackpool has many hidden gems. When it comes to retro gaming, one of them is nestled in the leafy suburbs to east of the town centre. Behold Eclipse Home Entertainment at 6 Beech Avenue, FY3 9BD!\n\nEclipse’s claim to be a games console specialist is clearly well-founded. Established in 1994, and stocking a wide range of hardware and software for mostly – but not exclusively – CD-based systems, those guys certainly know their onions (and their consoles!). They also hold a reasonable stock of Master System and SNES carts – loose and boxed – at what seemed to be reasonable prices. This time round there was nothing to tickle my peculiar fancy. Just to be clear, though, compared to the CEX at 20-22 Adelaide Street, Eclipse is an absolute Aladdin’s Cave of retro-gaming goodness.\n\nThe Golden Mile\n\nIt goes without saying, really, but for that one guy at the back who doesn’t know, Blackpool has been a popular tourist destination for – well – almost as long as there have been tourists. Even if you’ve never been there, you’re bound to have heard of Blackpool rock, Blackpool’s Pleasure Beach, or Blackpool Tower. I imagine most of you have even seen its balls – or at least the room in which they are held – through exposure (probably co-erced? Ammarite?) to ‘Strictly Come Dancing’?\n\nCentral Blackpool is usually fairly busy. It’s not hard to see why. The beach is lovely, the sea air, bracing, and both can be enjoyed from a tasefully rennovated prom, which is a genuine pleasure to stroll along. In fact, as you move away from the town centre and towards the Starr Gate (seriously) tram station, the installations of public art and sculpture help keep it interesting all the way to the end.\n\nThe town itself is not short of attractions. If you have some cash to spare, you can (kindof) meet the celebs at Madame Tussauds’ waxworks, or witness an appropriately tailiored demise in the Blackpool Tower Dungeon. You could visit the Sealife Centre, the Sand Castle Waterpark, the Houndshill shopping centre, or even ascend the Tower itself for a birds-eye view of the whole shebang. I’d recommend that. It’s not cheap, but if you’ve never done it before, I’d say it’s worth the money.\n\nIf we’re honest, Blackpool’s biggest draws have always been its livelier forms of entertainment. The towns three piers, and numerous variety halls have hosted the UK’s ‘top’ comedians and ‘family entertainers’ for generations. They still do. Their various sayings and catchphrases have been immortalised in Gordon Young’s stunning Comedy Carpet on the prom opposite the Tower – Blackpool’s answer to the Hollywood ‘Walk of Fame’.\n\nThe lure of the music halls (OK, and the pubs) has always been complimented by that of the family entertainment centres, whose heritage can be traced back through the penny arcades to the beach fairs of the 19th century. You can read more about that in Alan Meades’ 2022 opus, Arcade Britannia.\n\nThose arcades were money-spinners and then some – but only because the owners stayed on trend and worked the market for all it was worth. Inevitably, by the 1980s, Blackpool was home to one of the tightest concentrations of arcade video game cabinets in the British isles.\n\nI was lucky enough to enjoy Blackpool in its arcade heydey, from family trips in the late ’70s to work ‘incentive’ days in the early ’90s. Most of these these gravitated towards the Pleasure Beach. I don’t remember much from my first visit – other than the creepy Gold Mine, and the all-wooden rollercoaster. They were great. By the 1990s, however, the park had upped the ante with its Pepsi Max ‘Big One’ rollercoaster, which for that brief moment in time was the tallest in the world.\n\nThe Big One is still there today. But there’s one big change to the experience. In the early ’90s, the Pleasure Beach was free to enter. You only had to pay for the rides – pressumably in the hope that you would spend the rest of your wod on the arcade machines. Nowadays you have to pay (a lot) to get in. I haven’t been back. Just as well, I’m way too old for rollercoasters. But what abou the arcades, I hear you sigh?\n\nDo not despair fellow arcade enthusiasts!\n\nIf your interest is in arcade video games, you had – and still have – no need to go anywhere near the Pleasure Beach.\n\nSea-front Arcades\n\nAmusement arcades are to the Blackpool sea front what lettering is to a stick of Blackpool rock. Take a section out of it at any given point, and you’ll have sliced into an arcade, with more or less the same stuff it as any other part of the strip.\n\nTake the town’s three piers – (not) known locally as Brosnan, Morgan, and d’Ears.\n\nIn terms of arcades, the most central, and best stocked of these is, well, the imaginatively-named Central Pier. As you can see from the photos below, it’s changed very little since 1981. You enter through a big arcade, and if you can successfully navigate the fun fair behind it, you’ll find another one at the end before it drops into the sea. Like the other two piers, it is positively dripping with memories, excuding the aura of holidays past. The arcade experience? There are still pushers, grabbers, and slot machines a-plenty. Very few video-games though, beyond a few on-rails shooters and drivers. There’s also the obligatory Space Invaders Frenzy – which I rather like – but nary a CRT to be seen. Sad times 😦\n\nBut what about the prom – the sea-front strip so tightly-packed with amusement arcades and slot-machines, it is popularly known as the Golden Mile?\n\nAs has been pointed out by the inimitable Shaw Nolley on his arcade-focussed YouTube channel, the chances of finding an old-school, CRT-flavoured arcade machine in central Blackpool are slim. Basically, they’re about as rare as white rocking horse poo. That’s not to say its not worth a visit. But us oldsters need to temper our expectations (or is that expect our tempers?), and take them for what they are.\n\nBlackpool Amusements\n\nThe newest kid on the block, is ‘Blackpool Amusements’, which recently teleported in to a chunk of the old Lewis’s department store building, more recently occupied by Woolworths and then Poundland. The place is light, airy, and pleasant – a nice place for families looking to distract smaller kids with bright lights and the lure of prizes. Its two floors of amusements include a cafe and convenience facilities. There are a few of the bigger modern racers, and shooters, but little that will appeal to a classic gamer.\n\nFurther down the prom is the unmistakable, pirate-themed, Coral Amusements. Check out the transformation between 1981 and c. 1996.\n\n#NGL, this place is still pretty cool. The pirate-themed Buccaneer’s Bar, indoor amusement rides, and sprawling high-ceilinged entertainment floor are a sight to behold. If you’re looking for arcade games you can take your pick of modern shooters, drivers and ticket redeption machines. But that’s about it.\n\nGolden Mile Amusements\n\nJust over the road from Coral Island, is the even more storied Golden Mile Amusements. In years gone by, the same venue was known as Mr T’s, and before that Mr B’s. When it first opened, in 1968, it was Blackpool’s first custom-built amusement arcade! By the 1980s, it was an absolute gold-mine of video-game-shaped nuggets. That was then. These days, there’s no denying it’s starting to look a bit shabby. There’s good and bad news on that front. Golden Mile Amusements was part of the £40 million bundle of leisure attractions acquired by the council for redevelopment in the £300 million Blackpool Central Development plan. While that looks set to involve new indoor entertainment venues, it’s not clear whether that will include old sea-front site. The previous owners are now responsible for the shiney new Blackpool Amusements a bit further up the road – so the competition will be stiff from the outset.\n\nThe naughties saw a rebranding into Mr T’s.\n\nAround a decade later, the site was reborn into its final incarnation as Golden Mile Amusements.\n\nFunland\n\nNot much further along the prom is Funland. The boxy exterior houses two floors of amusements, including bowling and cafe facilities. While it’s not exactly modern, the classic arcade carpet adds some welcome retro-charm. Space Invaders Frenzy again, but nothing else I wanted to put any money in 😦\n\nOther Arcades\n\nOf course, there are still quite a few other arcades on or very near the prom – many of which appear to be in a state of flux. Just how much longer they can all stay in business remains to be seen. Happy Dazy was shut when I was there in April this year. Carousel Amusements seems to be open, albeit with some major (and ominous?) changes to the frontage. Let’s face it, while some of these places have benefitted from a fair bit of investment in relatively recent years, a lot of them are clearly on their uppers – with too many vendors competing for shares of an ever-diminishing pie.\n\nTo an extent, that’s a mirror for Blackpool itself. Parts of the town are very well-healed, particularly the suburns to the NE and S. As we’ve already established, the prom itself, and many of the central shopping areas are lovely. The area immediately surrounding them, however, is sadly crumbling away. It’s a sorry story, familiar from many other places in this sceptered (septic?) isle. Blackpool’s fortunes have waned, and waned again since the 1960s, when the advent of cheap package-holidays overseas tempted many regular visitors to spend their hard-earned cash elsewhere. The curent cost-of-living crisis isn’t helping either. We can only hope the council’s modernisation plans yield the results they’re looking for – and save at least a representative slice of their living arcade heritage.\n\nSt Annes\n\nAs you may have gathered, this wasn’t my first paper-round. And by 4.30, I felt like I’d done Blackpool.\n\nAs I still had some time to kill before the Club opened at 6 pm, I decided to head down to St Anne’s for a kick along the beach.\n\nI like St Annes. It’s a lot smaller and less busy than Blackpool, with a more genteel air to it. Suits you, sir! For me, as a visitor, the main negative aspect is the physical disconnect between the town centre and the sea front. To be honest, the parking wasn’t great either. It was either ridiculously expensive and/or dominated by those parking app systems, which I really don’t want on my phone (for reasons, m’kay?).\n\nMy plan was to see if the Amusement[s] on the pier still had the CRT-based games I saw there a few years back. IIRC they also had a few pinball tables, including Mars Attacks, and Elvis. For some reason, however, despite it being early evening on a Friday, the pier was closed. Never mind. When the tide goes out, the beach at St Annes is absolutely enormous. Nice sand too – great for building sand castles, as I first discovered on holiday in 1978! So I dawdled along to the newer entertainment complex a a bit further off to the south.\n\nHome to Island Cinema, a bowling alley, and a cafe, it looks like a great place. I only had time for quick visit to the Surfside Family Amusements Centre round the back. The downstairs part that I was in was relatively small, and packed with families, so I didn’t take any pics. Not that there was anything approaching a classic arcade machine. Having said that, the ratio of video games to redemption machines was very high, with half a dozen Raw Thrills-type efforts taking up the lion share of the floor space. I’d be happy enough with that after a day on the beach with the kids… if there wasn’t something several orders of magnitude better 15 minutes up the road.\n\nArcade Club, Blackpool (74 Bloomfield Road, FY1 6JL)\n\nI enjoyed my afternoon in Blackpool, and my micro-visit to St Annes, but the real reason for my trip was to do homage at the latest shrine to classic video-arcade gaming.\n\nArcade Club (Blackpool) (hallowed by thy name) is the third and most recent venue to bear that name. We’ll come back to the others – in Bury, and Leeds – in future blogposts. Suffice to say, that all three have grown from the same passion, and the same project, which began with the private collection of long-time video-games enthusiast Andy Palmer.\n\nLike most of us, Andy fell in love with the video games of the Golden Age when they were new, enjoying the arcades with his brother as a youngster. He began collecting arcade PCBs in the 1990s, when he realised they could be bought for the same price a a Mega Drive cart, and played at home using a supergun adaptor. Later, having built up a successful chain of computer repair shops in the Rossendale valley area, Andy’s growing collection of arcade cabinets began to spill over into their store rooms and cellars. A downturn in business in the early 2010s prompted him to move around 30 of his cabs and pinball tables into the back of his Haslingden shop for customers to play at the bargain price of £10 for four hours – as an experiment to see if people were still interested in the old games. This proved to be instantly popular. So much so, in fact, that within months he’d acquired a 3000 square foot unit on the other side of town, pooled his trove with fellow collector James ‘RGP’ Brindle, and opened the New Frontier arcade.\n\nFollowing a spotlight on the BBC’s ‘Collectaholics’ series, the New Frontier went viral. There was only one way forward – onward and upwards. By Halloween 2015, the first Arcade Club proper had opened at Ella Mill on Cork Street in Bury. The rest – as they say – is history. You can read a bit more about that journey, and Andy’s unrelenting work-ethic here on Eurogamer.net.\n\nThe New Frontier Arcade, Haslingden, Lancashire, August 2014\n\nArcade Club, Blackpool, opened on in June 2022 on the site of the former Sam Thai Casino on Bloomfield Road, beside the Blackpool F.C. football stadium. Parking is ample and free. Visitors are greeted by friendly and helpful staff, who’ll tag you with a wrist-band allowing you to come and go as you please during the session.\n\nThe Club is open to the public four days a week. Friday nights (6 pm -12 am) are adults only. Kids are allowed with adult supervision on Thursday evenings (6-11 pm), Saturdays (11 am – 11 pm) and Sundays (11 am – 8 pm). Admission is £16 per session per adult, with discounted prices for kids, families, and monthly (or longer) passes. If you’re there to play games, I reckon that represents really good value for money.\n\nEntrance is via the basement level. The small selection of classic pin-tables by the door make it clear you’re coming in to an arcade. What they don’t prepare you for, is the elegance of the place. As far as amusement arcades go, this one is classy! Immaculate decor, aligned with the building’s poker-chip origins, is complimented by numerous installations of video-games-themed art!\n\nTo reach the machines, you have to ascend to the first floor. As you reach the top of the stairs, you come face to face with the bar and cafeteria, with a fantastic selection of soft and boozaholic drinks, and a good range of high quality but reasonably priced eats. I can personally recommend the pepperoni pizza. Nom to the nom!\n\nThe bar area is kept child-, but not arcade-game-free, sporting the thematically appropriate Ice Cold Beer, and Tapper, as well as Pong, and a nook of Japanese candy cabs playing a variety of ‘bullet hell’ shmups.\n\nAdjacent to the bar, is where you’ll find the video wall (cool), and the Club’s current selection of modern video games. There’s always a representative collection of large-scale crowd-pleasers, like Luigi’s Mansion, some drivers, and all manner of intriguing Japanese rhythym games (not a euphamism). On a previous visit, I was blown away by the absolutely stunning VR Agent – a virtual reality shooter with such intuitive controls, and so convincing a 3-D effect, that it was difficult to stop playing! Word of warning, though: the bigger games like this do seem to get swapped out every now and again. If there’s anything in particular you’re keen on playing, you should check on the Arcade Club web-pages if it’s still on the floor, and more to the point, which Club it’s currently in.\n\nAt every Arcade Club, there’s something for everyone, no matter their taste in gaming. For the kids who can’t live without their hourly dose of Minecraft or Fortnite, there’s a dedicated room for networked console gaming. It’s not for me, but it’d be a great place to park the bairns if you’d brought them along.\n\nIf there’s something I’ve come to appreciate about the Arcade Club project over the past 10 years, it’s that no Arcade Club venue would be a genuine Arcade Club if it didn’t have a massive row of Electrocoin cabs – all lined up like the JAMMA soldiers of old. I mean would you just look at those Goliaths. Phwoar! I’ve got two at home, and can hardly keep my eyes off them. It was touch and go whether I could walk round that corner without fainting!\n\nI feel it’s really important to stress that these aren’t the battered old beasts you sometimes see being flogged on eBay. They’ve all been refreshed to within an inch of their Hantarex-framed lives! The monitors have all been trimmed, tuned and serviced to give sharp, vibrant pictures. The control panel overlays have all been replaced, and the joysticks and buttons swapped out, where necessary, to really polish that uniform look.\n\nI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. My enduring memory of the holiday arcades, is hopping in with my brother as soon as they opened – when the cleaning ladies were still doing the rounds with their dusting cloths and cans of Mr Sheen. They were in good condition then, but now – almost 40 years down the line, Arcade Club goes above and beyond the call of duty in keeping them shiney. Well done. Well done, indeed Mr Palmer!\n\nFinally, we have what I’m going to call the ‘Hall of Classics’ – a corner of the Club reserved for a carefully considered, and tatefully curated selection of dedicated cabintes from the Golden Age of video arcade games. As with the Electrocoin JAMMA cabs, these machines are fully refreshed, with screens, controls and cabinet art to die for. I think I’ll let the pictures speak for themselves.\n\nEpilogue\n\nI was really impressed with Arcade Club Blackpool. Having been to Blackpool umpteen times in recent years, and seen all it has to offer, I’d go as far as to suggest that if you’re a classic arcade fan, Blackpool – possibly – lets Arcade Club down. Or let me put it another way, if you’re into classic arcade games, and you do find yourself in Blackpool, you’ll have wasted your trip if you don’t visit Arcade Club! It’s that good.\n\nBut how does it compare to the Club’s other venues? We’ll need to wait until the next blogpost to find out!\n\nIn the meantime, if you have any arcade memories from Blackpool, or any thoughts on The Club that you’d like to share, please do leave a note in the comments below!\n\nNext up: Arcade Club, Bury…\n\nGreetings fellow travellers!\n\nIf you’re reading this blog, you probably like old video games. I know I do! Especially those of the arcade variety. They’ve been an important part of my life for nigh on half-a-century (Yeah, I’m that old!). I’ve enjoyed them at the shows, at the seaside, in town-centres, in take-aways, at motorway service stations, up mountains, on boats, and more recently, at home. If you saw my previous post you’ll know all about my (very) modest home arcade. If you’ve yet to meet ‘The Twins’, why not grab yourself a butchers via this link.\n\nLet’s face it, ‘though, a mere two JAMMA cabs was never going to cover all my gaming bases. They were never going to scratch that pixellated itch.\n\nYou know the score.\n\nTo reconnect with the ‘Golden Age’ of arcade or home gaming, you really need the ‘equitment’.\n\nInevitably, my stash of vintage gaming equipment has grown to include a selection of old computers, consoles, and TVs. Not so many that I’m in danger of getting showcased – in Retro Gamer magazine – or one of those ‘hoarding’ documentaries! But I do seem to have acquired a modest collection of stuff.\n\nAs a naturally tidy person, I kept most of it stored away in the loft, rotating things out every now and again as time permitted. Starting about 2016, however, I was also bitten by the console-revival-bug that started with the NES, C64, and SNES minis. Being living-room-friendly, it was a lot easier to leave them out, under the TV, and left on for the kids to play at parties and gatherings. Perhaps not surprisingly, they proved to be rather popular.\n\nFast-forward to the Christmas holidays in 2018, and a dinner with friends – and the topic of video-games events came up.\n\nWhy?\n\nOur local library had been dumped by the coonsil, only to be saved at the last minute by a community group. Events were needed to encourage folks, especially kids, to keep coming into the building on a regular basis – hopefully to borrow and read some books! But keeping the venue open wasn’t cheap, so fundraising was important too.\n\nVarious suggestions were on the table, mostly on the kind of book-related themes you might expect. But as the bleeps and bloops in the background began to escalate, it seemed that we had another potential solution staring us right in the ears. What about a Retro Games Club? The idea appeared to have wings. A few weeks of discussion, photoshopping and printing later and I had a plan.\n\nIn today’s post, I want to share my experience of running a Retro Games Club. I’ll cover what we did, how we did it, and how long it all took. That way, if you ever take the notion of running a club of your own, you can side-step the logistical problems, and start with the dial wanged all the way round to 11!\n\nGathering the troops\n\nIf you’ve got enough stuff, enough time and enough energy, it’s perfectly possible to set up and run a retro games club on your own. If you can remember back to the glory days of the JAMMA+ forum, you’ll probably know about the legendary efforts of Mr RGP (Retro Games Party), which have since blossomed into a bona fide business model.\n\nFor my humble project, however, the idea was to get the local community involved – to spread the joy, but also the load. Being of a certain age (old) was pretty useful here. With a few of my friends also harbouring retro-gaming urges, there would be a range of hands on deck. As we were all dads, we also had a ready made constituency of mini-gamers to help get the party started.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBetween us, we had a pile of retro kit – but that didn’t mean we could just plug it all in and get started. The venue was now run as a charity, and the terms of its insurance meant that electronics equipment had to be P.A.T. tested. With some of this stuff being 40 years old, and some of it accumulating 1000s of Volts, it was important that we didn’t expose the public, or the building, to any unnecessary risks. Even more so when kids would be involved. For an extra layer of saftey – and convenience – we also decided to run most of the stuff via fused extension cables. That meant absolutely tonnes of stuff had to get tested. If we’d had it done privately, it would have cost a bomb. Fortunately, a member of the Committee was a registered electrician, who gave up an evening to do it for free. If you need to get this done yourself, it’s worth checking if any local sparkies will do a special rate for charities. I’ve heard of some that will do it for a pound a test – although even at that rate you could be looking at £50 or more for a half-decent selection of gear!\n\nPlanning the event\n\nWith the equitment gathered, tested, and ready to go, the next big step was to advertise the first event. Before we could do that, however, we had to figure out what the format would be.\n\nThe main thing – obviously – was being able to offer a wide range of systems and games. But we also wanted to avoid the ‘tyranny of choice’, where the limitless selections of multi-carts can isolate gamers from each other, and quickly lead to boredom. The more sessions we ran, the more obvious it became that optimum levels of fun were generated by paring back the selection of games as much as possible – essentially running every system as a dedicated arcade cabinet.\n\nRather than simply turning on the machines and leaving the visitors to it, we decided to have a couple of systems fitted with multi-carts, but for most to be running a single competition game – with high scores getting listed on a white board, and prizes awarded to the winners.\n\nIn terms of competition games, we had to think pretty carefully about the selection on offer.\n\nLots of folks have very fond memories of obscure old games – and while we were keen to accommodate those nostalgia trips where possible, we were also conscious that they wouldn’t always make the best games for quick plays or competitions.\n\nThe winning formula turned out to be pretty straightforward. Games should be simple, easy to learn, have a clear scoring mechanism, and not last very long – allowing the maximum number of people to have a go, and to encourage a bit of competition. Games like Frogger, Galaxian, and Chuckie Egg fit the bill rather nicely.\n\nNowadays, there are also a bunch of amazing home-brew games for the C64, including the awesome Canabalt, and the 4K phenomena Winky Blinky and Dog that make for really great competitions. If you haven’t seen them, be sure to check ’em out!\n\nI already had a whiteboard and pens we could use for high scores. A few shifts on GIMP later, and we had some information boards for the machines, some labels highlighting the prize games, and some certificates for the winners. Kids love that kind of thing!\n\nGiven that the club was going to involve a long stretch on Saturday afternoons, we reckoned that there should also be snacks. First thoughts were the kind of comfort snacks we remembered from our own youth – donuts, crisps, and coca cola. All the good stuff! But as responsible, community-minded adults, we also had to be sensible. Healthy snacks (apples!) would also be available, as would gluten and sugar-free alternatives. There would also be some water, coffee and – of course – biscuits for the grown-ups. All of this would come at a cost, which would have to be covered by the ticket price. While the ultimate goal was to raise some money for the library on top of this, we didn’t want to price anyone out.\n\nCompromises had to be reached.\n\nLuckily, the best donuts on the market (street), could be had for 11p each in packs of 5. Crisps weren’t much more. And at the time, cans of coke (full-fat and sugar free) were south of 30p a tin (if bought in mahoosive boxes). Figure in some packets of gummi-type sweets for prizes, the fruit, and the gluten and sugar-free snack alternatives, and we found that we could cater for about 80p a head. That was assuming that this wouldn’t be a one-off event, and that the remainder of any bulk-buys could be held over to the next event. Setting the ticket price at £2 including snacks seemed like good value, and would still generate some cash for the library. I imagine you’d have to raise that to £3 or more nowadays to achieve the same kind of results.\n\nLetting the world know\n\nThe plan was to let people pay on the door. But to encourage folks to buy into the event in advance, I also rustled up some souvenir tickets. If you’re going to do this kind of thing yourself, you’re going to need a paper guillotine. Cutting them out with scissors is a pain in the proverbials.\n\nThe final hurdle was letting the world know. To do that, we needed some posters.\n\nThe design of the posters was deliberately cluttered (honest!) – partly for ironic reasons, but mostly to give the intended audience something to explore, and hopefully to find something specific to identify with. Something to hook them in. We posted them on relevant and specifically-targetted web-platforms and ‘socials’. For extra-added old-skool charm, they were also printed out, laminated, and pinned up on notice boards around the village!\n\nAfter the first few, I decided to beef up the retro-chic-quotient by adding some 80s icons.\n\nEventually, the temptation to riff off (rip off?!) the kids’ favourite TV show was just too hard to resist.\n\nAnd once you go down that road, the challenge of matching branding, fonts and styling sets you sliding down the slippery road towards addiction.\n\nIn the end, things started getting a bit out of hand!\n\nLet battle commence!\n\nAs you can see from the posters, the Club had its premier on the 20th of April 2019. That’s five whole years ago! Happy Birthday ‘Retro Games Club’!\n\nGetting everything ready that first Saturday morning took ages.\n\nMoving my own stuff from its various hidee-holes at home into the boot of the car took about an hour. This was on top of the hour it had already taken to go to the shops to buy the scran, and make up some flasks of coffee for the grown ups.\n\nFrom parking the car outside the venue to being fully green-lit and ready to go took another 45 minutes – and that was with several other people helping to get the boxes in, unpack the stuff, and set it all up. Getting everything dimantled, back into the boot, and finally stowed away at the end of the day took another 90 minutes. So, basically, with a 1 pm start in mind, the shenanigans had to get underway by about 10 am. The 5 pm finish meant that tea could not be eaten, nor hostelries visited before about 6.30 pm. That’s quite a shift for the old day off!\n\nAfter a few sessions, it was clear that a later start time would be needed to let us get things ready at a less frantic pace. It also meant we had time for some lunch before the guests arrived. Noice.\n\nRetro-games clubbing!\n\nRunning the Club was definitely not a one-man job.\n\nIn fact, you’ll want a sensible number of adults for the size of the intended audience. A ratio of about 1 to 10 is usually a good idea. But you’ll need to make sure that at any given time, the whole area can be looked over by adults who’ve gone through the appropriate background checks. In Scotland, that means a DBS (Disclosure Scotland) check. The easiest thing to do here is to get someone involved who already works with kids (eg. as a school teacher, teaching assistant, nursery teacher etc.), or who is involved with a childrens’ group, like the Scouts or the Boys’ Brigade. Teachers will already have one, paid for by their employer – as will most folks who are regular contributors to kids’ groups. Depending on the size of the venue, one might be enough. The best thing to do is check the rules and requirements with the venue itself. They may well have a list of certified volunteers who can come along for the day and help out. Fortunately, we had all those bases covered between us.\n\nWe needed someone at the front desk to meet, greet, explain what was happening, and make sure that high scores were recorded accurately. We also needed bods in circulation to keep an eye on the kids, and the machines (!), and to check that everything stayed on and working. It’s amazing how easily kids can crash RPi set-ups – even when they’ve been certified bomb-proof by adults.\n\nWith the snacks, rather than leaving everything out on a table and having folks help themselves, we decided to have a dedicated snack-time about half-way through. Two adults minimum were needed to hand out the goods, and make sure that the inevitable debris was quickly and suitably recycled. Those kids went at the donuts and crisps like a shoal of piranhas! Cloths, kitchen roll, disinfectant spray, and binbags were on hand in case of catastrophe. We also decided to give guests a time-warning at 4.30, and to use the last 10 minutes for anouncing the competition-winners and awarding the prizes.\n\nHow did it all work out?\n\nIn short, it was BRILLIANT!\n\nThat first day – which we ran as a test – had about 20 paying guests. More would have been better. But in retrospect the limited nmbers were a good thing. It gave us the space we needed to iron out the creases and nail down the routine. After that, word spread, with the number of paying guests doubling to around 40 for the next event, and passing 50 by the end of November.\n\nThe growing numbers inspired an adults-only event between Christmas and New Year, with beer and cake, as well as coke and donuts. I have to say, it looked pretty good fun, even if I was lumped with responsible person status!\n\nGame Over?\n\nBy late February 2020, we’d got into a bit of a rhythm. The Retro-Games Club was taking off as a local event. The vibe was good, the kids had fun, and we’d raised several hundred pounds for the library.\n\nPlans for a follow-up event at the end of March were well underway when…\n\nWell, we all know what happened in March 2020.\n\nIt was late 2022 before we were in a position to think about a revival.\n\nBy that point, the pooled retro-collections, Rpi-creations, and TV stock-pile had grown. I’d managed to bag a few extra CRTs through a local advertising campaign (!), and was keen to get them fired up and running clasic video games.\n\nUnfortunately, in the years that had passed since our last event, the library’s buildings insurance had been changed to one that seemed to require full PAT-testing for every single piece of electrical equipment being used. While that seems sensible for high-voltage kit, like CRT TVs, I’m not so sure it’s necessary for very low-power gear like RPis. I also ‘hae ma doots’ that blasting aging PC Engines or Vectrexes (Vectrices?) with a test jolt is the best thing for their electronic health. To my mind, the regulations would allow for (partial) exceptions for this kind of equipment, especially if other layers of saftey precaution were put in place. But that doesn’t mean the insurance company needs to agree!\n\nEpilogue\n\nIf I can find a way to spare my geriatric electronics the indignity of shock-testing, I’d be up for reviving the Retro Games Club. An alternative might be to restrict the event to less valuable and less-cherished relics, like RPi-based systems and LCD screens. Would that cut the mustard? Maybe some of the dads would still come along. But in the life of the kids who used to visit the Club, 5 years is a very long time. The ones who still play video games have moved on to more modern things. Some of them have left home and moved away. Would an even younger crowd be interested in our Stone Age appliances? Watch this space. We’ll have to wait and see…\n\nHave you organised a Retro Games Club? Do you have any tips to share? Do you plan to, and have questions to ask? If so, please join the conversation in the comments section below.\n\nWhat news is there in the city? Have the proud woo-ers by this time come home from their ambush, or are they still watching for me where they were, to take me on my homeward way?\n\nHomer (The Odyssey, Book 16)\n\nGreetings fellow arcade enthusiasts, and welcome back to my humble blog. Prepare to go ‘Woo’, for I bring news…\n\nAccording to WordPress.com, Arcade Odysseus has been troubling the blogosphere for 520,960 minutes. That’s a whole lot of minutes. But what it means #IRL is that this site has now been up and running for a whole year!!!\n\n‘Woo!’ and dare I say, ‘Hoo!’\n\nSo, many happy returns to Arcade Odysseus, but – more importantly – many thanks to all you lovely, lovely, wonderful readers for keeping me company on my journey.\n\nWe’ve covered quite a distance, haven’t we?\n\nI’m not just talking about the 8,000 miles from the Glens of Pictavia to Funspot, NH, and back. There are also the strange aeons of time we’ve crossed in our joint quest to return to the Golden Age of video arcade games.\n\nTo celebrate, I thought I should introduce you to my twins. OK, so they’re not human, and they entered my world two years apart. But there are two of them!\n\nI’ve already covered their protracted gestation, here, in a tale that’s bound to strike a chord with more than a few of you VACers. To cut a long story short, my attempts to get hold of a real-life, old-school, video-arcade cabinet for my own home began in 2007. For various reasons, it was late 2010 before I could put any serious effort into the project, and 2012 before it came to fruition.\n\nTwin number one arrived in April of that year. As you can see, his name is Rob O’Tron. And what a fine, strapping example of an Electrocoin Goliath Mark 3 he is. Twin number two joined us almost 2 years later, in May 2014. His name is Donnie K. Conn.\n\nCompared to many collectors, my shrine to the gods of arcades past is meagre.\n\nIn an ideal world, and an ideal games room, I’d want hunners (= ‘a lot’) of the things. I reckon I’d ‘need’ a few of my favourite dedicated cabs, some pinball tables, and enough generic JAMMA cabs to cover all the control variations, from joystick, steering wheel and spinner to flight yoke, flight stick, and light gun.\n\nWhat I have is a compromise. It fills the space available – in terms of room, and spousal tolerance (!). From my perspective, it also serves as a striking and emotive art installation that recalls an important moment in time, culture, and my own life journey. Goliaths FTW!\n\nBeyond that, it lets me play horizontal and vertical games without any hassle whatsoever 😉\n\nThe Beauty Parlour\n\nI may only have two cabs, but as I’m sure you’ll all appreciate, the scope to tinker, tweak, and tamper is not only limitless but very difficult to resist.\n\nFirst up is the ‘ritual cleansing’.\n\nSomething that never ceases to amaze me, is the number of folk selling L@@K!!R@RE!!!! arcade kit, who don’t seem to know about cloths or soapy water. You see, I like to look after my stuff. And I don’t want huge hulking great objects d’art in my house covered in grime. But that’s fine, I find the cleaning aspect of the hobby therapeutic. For me, the process was similar to those guys cleaning carpets on YouTube. Don’t get me wrong, the machines were clean to the touch when they came in. But decades of accumulated dust, dirt and cigarette smoke were laminated onto the surface – especially on the inside. That had to go.\n\nAfter several gallons of warm soapy water, and a thorough airing, the scrapes, gouges and bumps on the outside were filled and touched-in.\n\nI used acryllic model paint. While easy to blend and apply, it has faded over the years. I’ll need to redo the dings at some point, and maybe, when I do, I’ll spray over the top-coat with some UV-resistant anti-fade spray. It seems to work well enough on ink-jet photos, so it should do the job on the cabs. While I was doing this, I also used a black sharpie to touch in the cracks and creases on the black monitor shrouds. Hidden behind the glass bezel, the now look as good as new.\n\nNext up, the metalwork was in need of a refresh. While there isn’t very much of it, getting the top coat dry without an effing insect landing on it, leading to a rub-down and respray was… challenging.\n\nThe coin doors, while OK, weren’t set up to let me use the big 10 pence pieces I enjoyed in my youth. So out they came, to be replaced with twin-slot doors, cut to accommodate low-maintenance S10 coin mechanisms.\n\nWhile doing this, I sanded the black paint-work back to the metal, which reminded me of the doors on old Williams’ cabs like Defender. So I polished them up and left ’em like that. After fitting some new bulbs to the coin return buttons, I replaced all the barrel locks with new, keyed-alike mechs – which are far more convenient for a ome setup.\n\nIn those days, when it was easier and often cheaper getting spare parts from the States, I sourced a some replacement coin slot bezels from a stateside seller. A bit of scanning and photoshop later, and Y100 became 10p. At the same time, I bagged me a pile of old 10 pees off eBay – enough to generate the familiar ‘chink’ that followed the dropping of a coin through the slot.\n\nButtons were removed, cleaned, bleached, and then polished! Leaf-switches were refurbished and fine-tuned, and the monitors recapped, with burnt-in tubes eventually switched out for shinier, cleaner versions. Getting hold of those tubes, however, was nowhere near as easy or as quick as I would have liked. In fact, one of them still isn’t perfect (if anyone has a burn and scratch free 19″ screen compatible with Hantarex boards, that they no longer need, please drop me a line!).\n\nOf course, the maquees had to be swapped out too. This presented me with a quandry. Which artwork should I use? Tonnes of the acade games I like have eye-catching marquees. Loads of them are reproduced in glorious, touched-up technicolour by Tim Nicholls in his excellent 2015 compendium, Artcade: The Book of Classic Arcade Art. However, to my mind, not all of these were suitable for their designated space, or the curatorial dimension of my ‘installation’. So I went for marquees with recognisably classic vibes. My thinking was tha they should have clean lines and bright colours, and come from games that I liked. My initial choices were Robotron and Defender.\n\nAt the time, the easiest – and cheapest – way to do this was to source high resolution scans off the internet, tidy them up in an art package, and print them out on heavy duty photo paper on the A0 plotter at work. Years later, when forum celebrity Muddy Music had set up his Arcade Art Shop, I grabbed myself some perspex replacements. This time round, however, I swapped Defender for Donkey Kong on my vertical cab. Classic game! Shame I’m still no good at it…\n\nLike the marquees themselves, marquee lights don’t last forever. These days, a lot of collectors are swapping them out for LEDs. I’ve stayed with CFL for now, but have had to replace tubes and starters – which are all still available online.\n\nThat brings us on to the joysticks – which are a crucial part of the arcade experience. None of this ‘gamepad’ nonsense for me. Not even on my 1980s consoles! That’s right. I’ll always rock an arcade stick in preference to a gamepad. Pah!!!\n\nMy first cab came with ‘asymmetic’ sticks – as captured by my kids in an early piece of visual art! That would never do. They had to be replaced asap.\n\nFirst up were a pair of Happ ‘bat-top’ sticks from the States. At the time, that was cheaper than buying them in the UK. They were fine for most things, but not what I needed for Robotron. Luckily, not long afterwards, I was able to bag 3 leaf-switched Wico sticks on the now defunct JAMMA+ forum.\n\nThe shafts were pretty rusty, but nothing a quick whizz in a drill couldn’t cure, when Brasso and wire wool were applied. A similar process sorted out the dings and scratches on the plastic knobs, with the help of Novus 123, and some fine-grade wet’n’dry sandpaper. To complete the revitalised look, I visited ArcadeShop.de for some NOS grommets and dust washers.\n\nLater, when cab number two was having it’s beauty treatment, I was able to find a Cyprus-based seller on eBay with a pile of NOS Wico sticks. The price delivered was $112. In those days, that was about £75 in total, for two sticks and postage!!!\n\nA quick note on Wicos. Many keyboards have been hammered to dust by ‘forumites’ evangelising the importance of a 4″ shaft when playing Robotron (oo err missus!). As a result, they’ve been rare and difficult to get hold of for a decade. I reckon at least part of that stick schtick was to shill the market.\n\nBut here’s the thing: if you have a dedicated Williams’ Robotron cab, where the control panel is packed with 1/2 inch ply (into which a shallow rebate for the joysticks is routed), the shafts protrude around 3 1/2 ” from the outer surface. If, however, you have an Electrocoin JAMMA cab, where the joysticks are bolted directly under the 2 mm mild-steel control panel, the far more common 3 1/2″ shafts also stick about 3 1/2″ above the outer surface. You heard it here first kids. For authentic Robotron gameplay, you don’t necessarily need 4″ sticks. Check your control panel before dropping a fortune on eBay treasures!\n\nThe more I started getting back into my arcade favourites, the more I realised that when it came to vertical games, Golden Age titles just can’t be enjoyed the way they were intended without a 4-way restrictor gate. Technically, Wicos can be switched between 4-way and 8-way, but TBH, it’s a bit of a bollâche, as the French (don’t) say. The solution for easy 4-8-way switching? A pair of Ultimarc Mag Stick Plus joysticks – with ball-top handles. If you have a Goliath, you’ll need an adaptor plate to mount them (the interweb is your friend here). But once they’re in, it’s just lift, twist, and away you go. It makes quite a difference.\n\nMy final tweak – so far (!) – was to refurbish the control panels. I’d already picked up a pair of Wico LS-30 rotary sticks, so I could enjoy Rambo-inspired shooters like Ikari Warriors. Rather than mucking about with swapping joysticks in and out, I decided to find a spare control panel and keep them permenantly fitted. While I was at it, I also took the opportunity to replace the CPO (control panel overlay). Like the marquees, this came from the Arcade Art Shop.\n\nWhen I have a spare day (or two!), the other two control panels will be getting the same treatment. I know a lot of you arcadists are keen on showcasing your cabs’ battle scars. I’m coming round to the idea that a storied appearance can look good on a dedicated cab. For Electrocoins, however, I want mine to look the way I remember them from bitd – minty fresh and polished to within an inch of their electronic lives! In the meantime, I’ve swapped out the rusty old coach bolts securing the joysticks for some shiney, shiney stainless-steel replacements. NB: when fitting these, you need to press down had on the top of the bolt with something rubbery when tightening the nut, otherwise, it’ll rotate and ruck up your CPO. That’s not a good look!\n\nTo finish up, here are some shots of the cabs just after they came in:\n\nHere they are again after their refurbs, almost 10 years ago:\n\nAnd here they are again yesterday!\n\nGames\n\n‘[G]od soon gave us game to satisfy our hearts’\n\nHomer (The Odyssey, Book 9)\n\nCompared to most collectors, I don’t have a lot of PCBs. Just a few favourites, including the best game of all time… Rygar. Obviously. I also have a few multi boards, including the outstanding JROK Williams FPGA board, for authentic Robotron action. Other boards have come and gone over the years, because, basically, I don’t have any sensible places to keep them. What I have done is invest in a couple of inline Volt-meters, to be sure that my PCBs can be tuned to run under optimum conditions.\n\nFor reasons of convenience, most of my gaming has been done on MAME via PCs and Ultimarc J-PAC adaptors. For the first few years, I used (really!) old office PCs running Windows XP, MAME and the MALA frontend. That was fine… to an extent. MALA is uncluttered, simple, and easy to use. To shut down safely, however, you needed an extra, dedicated button, which is a bit of a pain. But I was able to fit one – discretely – to the top of the cab.\n\nFrustratingly, the first few PCs failed after a year or so. Good job they were free! That could be because they were ancient and at the end of their natural lives anyway. But I was suspiscious that steam from the kitchen may have been intefering with their innards. As a precaution, I started keeping a couple of disposable moisture traps in the electronics section of the cabs. It could be a coincidence, but since then – maybe 8 or 9 years ago – nothing has failed.\n\nNot long after that, I invested in one of 2Huwman’s Linux-based Mini Kab systems. It was great while it lasted. Fast-booting, reliable, and straightforward. Once I’d ugraded my switching PSU to 4A on the 12V line, it could run without a separate PSU. Sadly, in early 2020, it perished in a freak cat-tralated accident and had to be replaced. These days I run older, USFF PCs running Groovymame, on builds compiled by the initimitable Mr JonnyG. That guy is a hero!\n\nEpilogue\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed the story of my little home arcade. I’ve certainly enjoyed the machines. They’ve been a regular fixture at gatherings and parties, and especially popular with the kids. My own kids have grown up with them. They may have moved on to more modern things, but at least they know their gaming history. And they’re under strict instructions. When their old dad finally pops his clogs, they can keep one of the machine if they like. But the other one is to have the gubbins removed, and used as a vessel for my final journey – to the great Amusement Arcade in the sky…\n\nWhat else should I do to my Goliaths? How else could I tweak them for the ultimate arcade experience? Please leave you thoughts, recommendations and tips in the comments section below!\n\nWeren’t arcade games brilliant?\n\nI mean, they weren’t just games. They were a full-on sensory workout! You got retina-searing colours, synapse-tingling jingles, and the chance to spray your digital territory with crudely miss-spelt memos in instalments of 3 letters: XYZ IZA D*K anyone? Remember that? Amazing!\n\nNow, remember when we discovered we could play video games at home, in our own house?\n\nI’m not talking about table-top games or handhelds here. Sure, those things filled a niche – as we’ll see in Matt Precious’ hotly anticipated retrospective, From Coin-Ops to Table-Tops: The Essential Electronic Games. And yeah, the kids who were lucky enough to have one of them VFD-endowed beauties – and were allowed to take it in for the bring-a toy-to-school-day – could dine-out on their shot-giving largesse for-pretty-much-ever (OK, the rest of the week). But let’s face it, those things were never more than also-rans.\n\nWe can also skip over the old, Pong-type TV games here. Can anyone honestly say that those things held their attention for more than a couple of weeks – even in the bleakest winter evenings of the early 1980s?\n\nWhere I want to go with this is home computers, people. Because they….. were GLORIOUS!\n\nMy original plan for this post was to begin chronicling my journey through the world of personal computers, starting with the ZX Spectrum. But there’s already so much copy out there – so many websites, blogposts, Youtube videos, and podcasts that do such a brilliant job of showcasing the systems and the games, that it all seemed a bit redundant.\n\nWhile I might come back to some of my favourite games in the future, what I thought I’d do instead is focus on the times and places that were central to my own 8-bit era. I thought it would be nice to take you back with me on a journey through the sights, the scenery, and the shenanigans of a typical 1980s shopping mall – to help you reconnect with the Golden Age in all its beige, brown and orange splendour. Yes, what I’m offering is some essential therapy to help you better remember what made it all so great. Coincidentally, that’s also a lot easier for me to structure. You see, for me, the 8-bit era started, and ended in the same place – Cumbernauld…\n\nNB: This post was updated on the 11th of August 2024 with some extra photos.\n\nThe 8-Bit Era\n\nAs a child of the the 1970s, I was prepped and ready for the home computer revolution. Yessir, I knew all about computers. I’d seen them on Star Trek, Blake’s Seven, and Tomorrow’s World. I’d even read about them in comics and newspapers. I felt like I really understood computers – you know what I mean? I’d never actually had my hands on one, of course, but all of that changed at the tail end of 1982.\n\nIt turned out that a friend of mine’s dad was a home computer enthusiast. He’d dropped a fortune on a BBC model B, a Microvitec Cub monitor, a double disk-drive, and some other shizz. I’m assuming it was somehow work-related. Grossed up for inflation, we’d be looking at north of 4 grand nowadays. Maybe even 5! That clearly made it ‘precious’, and not something destined for ‘open access’.\n\nBut here’s the thing. With us finishing school at half past three, and the parents in question not getting home from work until about half past five, there was a window of opportunity to explore its digital delights and clear out before anyone knew – which is exactly what we proceeded to do.\n\nSomewhat suspiciously, the software collection wasn’t limited to spreadsheets – not that I’d even heard that word back then. Over the next year or so, I was introduced to a cornucopia of ‘black-label’ 5 and 1/4″ floppies, filled with titles like Rocket Raid, Hopper, and the mighty Planetoid.\n\nYes, this was very naughty – an early example of what came to be known as ‘Piracy’! In terms of morality, however, I’d suggest there was an element of karma at work here. I could be wrong, but I doubt Acornsoft had negotiated a distribution license with the creators of Scramble, Frogger, or Defender. Arrrrrr!\n\nThose games were great. Arguably, amongst the best of the early arcade conversions on any system, and unsurpassed until Richard Broadhurst’s retro re-imaginings of the twenty tens. But truth be told, I was also captivated by the prospect of programming in Basic. Yes, that’s right. Writing computer programmes was called ‘programming‘ in those days. None of this new-fangled ‘coding’ malarky. So, I started borrowing books about computer programming from the library.\n\nWhile I didn’t have a computer to practice on, I used to rehearse the routines on the back of my jotters in the clock-watching slots at school. My teacher thought I was doing sums (teeheehee!). The irony! If she’d clocked on to what I was up to, I’d have copped one for sure – even although my subversive scribblings had far more career value than the tedious sums I’d already finished.\n\nBefore long, I was totally hooked. There was never any chance of me getting a BBC micro. But it was so out of reach, that it never really bothered me. What did get me excited was an old copy of Computer & Videos Games I’d been given in the spring. A BBC was never going to happen, but there was this new computer that everyone was talking about – it was even in the magazine, for flip’s sake! You could get it for less than £200, and you didn’t even need a monitor or a disc-drive to use it. You could just plug it into the TV and play games off ordinary cassettes!!! Its name? The Zed Ex Spectrum.\n\nA relative noticed what I was up to and passed on a pile of pre-loved computer mags. Some of them were pretty recent. In amongst the articles and adverts, was some encouraging news. Basic-ally (!), with early production-line issues under control, Sinclair Research Ltd. had taken the decision to slash the price of the Spectrum. The £175 originally asked for the 48K model had been cut to less than £130. Even better news, the 16K model had been pushed down below the psychologically-important £100 barrier. It may not have had the same (games-playing) potential, but you could solve that problem later by saving up for a 32K RAM expansion! I could hardly believe it!\n\nNow, these days, £100 is not a lot of money. It doesn’t touch the sides of our weekly food shop – and that’s at Lidls. But in 1983, the pounds and pennies in your pocket went a lot further. Bearing in mind that a Spectrum – on its own – was no good, and needed a £20-30 cassette recorder to load and save the software, we’re talking about a likely minimum spend of £130. Plug that into the Bank of England inflation calculator and we’re pretty firmly in PS5 territory. In fact, at the time I’m writing this, it’s almost exactly what it’d cost you to buy yourself a PS5 ‘Slim’ from Argos. Whodathunkit?! A 16K ZX Spectrum set-up had the equivalent value of an all-singing, all-dancing, ultra-modern Playstation 5 ?!?!\n\nWith a birthday coming up soon, I started dropping hints at home, asking everyone for cash instead of presents. My pitch was for the 16K model, with my marketing strategy foregrounding the ‘educational’ potential of the machine. I mostly wanted it for the games, of course, but the potential sponsors needed to know there were some traditionally acceptable outcomes too!\n\nWhen the dust cleared after the big day, it turned out that I’d been a very lucky boy. With the help of my granny, there was enough for a ZX spectrum, a basic tape recorder, and a game! To say I was excited would be an understatement. There was only one minor setback. My birthday was on a Saturday, and I wasn’t going to see everyone until Sunday or maybe Monday. Ultimately, that meant that the purchase would have to wait.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, my Dad took me up to Cumbernauld to get a few bits we needed for my birthday tea. We got some strawberries for the victoria sponge my mum was making. I even got a ‘big’ bar of Dairy Milk (by 1983 standards) – an unexpected bonus, ticking off a longstanding ambition of mine! Even better than that, we nipped into John Menzies to check that they actually sold ZX Spectrums at the price we expected them to be, and that they had some in stock. The plan was to come back the following Friday after school and buy it then.\n\nThe 6 days that followed were the longest of my life so far. But the time passed, as it always does, and come Friday evening, I was the proud owner of a Spectrum, a tape recorder, and the Planet of Death text adventure. Sadly, the game didn’t work, and we were eventually able to swap it for Psion’s Hungry Horace. But that evening, there was more than enough to keep me busy in the introductory Horizons tape. Who can forget the keyboard trainer, the evolution of foxes and rabbits, or the Breakout clone, Thro’ the Wall?\n\nThe next day was a Saturday, and a sunny one at that. Naturally, I spent the morning inside with the curtains drawn, glued to the screen. I remember hearing my wee brother and pals out in the garden. Eventually, and inevitably, I gave up on keyboard trainer and went out to join them.\n\nNot my Spectrum, sadly. The only bit of my set-up that survives is a random flap from the box it came in. This holy relic was preserved like a fly in amber, or rather a bookmark jammed between the pages of a Fighting Fantasy volume. Those are my Ultimate tapes, though. Sweet, eh?\n\nOver the next few years, I put together a small collection of original tapes. Like most folks, however, the bulk of my gamage revolved around, ahem, ‘back-up’ copies on C15, C45 or even C90 tapes. With the originals being few and far between, and the local ‘back-up’ scene taking a year or two to fully develop, I had to get my gaming fix in other ways. Like loads of other kids in those days, I turned to the type-in programmes published in magazines. Sometimes, those programmes promised an approximation of a popular arcade game, or at least part of it.\n\nOne rainy Saturday morning in November 1983 (yes, that’s before the date on the magazine below, that’s how those things worked!), a trip to John Menzies in Glasgow revealed what promised to be a decent version of the arcade classic Hunchback. It was showcased on the contents page of the classy, Your Computer magazine. With a cover price of 80p instead of the more usual 75p, it was bound to be good.\n\nI bought the mag in the hope – and expectation – of great things. In the end, I must have spent more than 3 hours typing that fecker in, only for it to not work and for my tape recording to fail. I don’t know if that was down to me (likely), typsetting issues with the print out in the magazine (also likely), or if the programme never actually worked in the first place (something I’ve since read was not unkown!). Whatever. That was the last time I typed anything in from a magazine longer than a POKE.\n\nCome Christmas, Santa was kind enough to bring me a 32K Rampack, swelling the machine’s memory to 48K, and opening up the entire spectrum of gaming possibilities. At the same time, a couple of the neighbouring families had bought Spectrums for Christmas, helping to kickstart the local home computer scene.\n\nWhat’s it Called?\n\nI got my Spectrum from the John Menzies in Cumbernauld Town Centre. Did you ever go there? I appreciate that you probably didn’t. But if you grew up just about anywhere in the ‘UK’ in the 1970s or ’80s, aspects of it would have been very familiar – especially the names and types of shops. We’re not just talking John Menzies here, but Currys, Tandy, Klicks, Granada, Rumbelows, Thomas Cook, Mothercare, Barretts, Saxone and more besides – brands that we haven’t seen on the streets for years, and in some cases decades.\n\nWhen you look at the ‘then and ‘now’ shots in the photos below, you’ll no doubt also associate with the washed out, soporific, and sterile experience of the modern era. While that’s a bit sad, I think it also helps to emphasise how full of life and colour those places were back in the day. And yes, I realise how odd that sounds when most of the photos are artfully rendered in black-and-white. But I’d argue that it actually gives them a dream-like quality. Or something.\n\nCumbernauld Town Centre, as I remember it, went One Step Beyond the other malls of the era. OK, so the exterior was a horrific, brutalist mess. But by the time Phase IV of the shopping complex had been completed in 1981, the designers had clearly made some real efforts to up their game. The decor and branding embraced the full, extended colour palette of the late 1970s, with its interlocking triangles of brown, beige and orange. They even commissioned the artist – Michael Snowden, RSA – to elevate the place with sculptures and other cultural experiments.\n\nThe outside, may have looked like a nightmare, but the inside was a dream – filled with optimism and choice retail outlets!\n\nJohn Menzies\n\nThere it is, John Menzies, c. 1987. The retail mother of my ZX Spectrum! The home computer section was upstairs to the rear and right of the shop. I don’t remember this branch lasting long into the 1990s, when at least part of the unit was taken over by Superdrug. The image below was taken in the Murraygate branch of Menzies in Dundee in 1986. As far as I can remember, the set-up of the ‘computer department’ in Cumbernauld was almost the same.\n\nIn fact, it was fairly similar to the computer section of most other high-street chains at the time. The photo below is from Rumbelow’s on Teviot Walk in Cumbernauld Town Centre. What made Menzies different was the range of games, which was usually a lot better, and the selection of computer magazines on sale downstairs.\n\nLooking back, I didn’t go up to Cumbernauld that often. I much preferred the combined shopping and arcading opportunities of Falkirk, Stirling and Glasgow. By the time I was at secondary school in the mid-1980s, however, Cumbernauld Town Centre was a computer-games-buying destination for lots of local kids. In fact, when I did go there, I’d be surprised if I didn’t see some familiar faces, perusing, and sometimes even buying the wares.\n\nI remember seeing a friend’s older brother testing and then buying Ocean’s Gift from the Gods for the Spectrum. It looked OK, but if I remember correctly, the reviews weren’t stellar – which was an absolute pre-requisite for spending long-saved pocket money on such a big-ticket item! A couple of weeks later, he approached me in the playground and asked if I wanted to buy it off him. I politely declined.\n\nBut let’s take another look at that photo of Menzies. Consider the ambience in the mall in the 1980s. And then look at it now. Where’s the colour? Where’s the life? Sigh…\n\nMenzies was in the large atrium at the very end of the Phase IV strip, which seems to have become known as ‘The Escalator Hall’. Why? Because that’s where the escalators are, of course. Check this out:\n\nThis photo was taken around 1986. Look at the place! Look at the decor! Look at the people! There’s olde worlde streetlamps, hanging gardens – and not a shell suit in sight! Finding it on the internet was a bit of a shock. Believe it or not, I was actually there on the day it was taken. When I first saw it, I even thought I was in it! You see that wee guy standing at the edge of the balcony at the top-centre? That could well have been me. That’s exactly where I used to stand when I was waiting for my parents to emerge from the shops. It even looks a bit like I did. But if you zoom right in, it seems like he’s wearing glasses, which I didn’t have back then. Oh well.\n\nOn meditating, I distinctly remember walking past a camera on a tripod on my way upstairs that day – quite an unusual sight. And seeing my favourite spot gazzumped, shuffled off to the other shops behind. I suspect I might have been off to Toymaster to see if they still had any Citadel miniatures in stock. Spoiler, they very rarely did.\n\nHere’s the same spot now. A sterile, soulless nothing. The Kopper Kettle cafe survived at least into the 2010s, but even that’s gone now. Sad times.\n\nAll of these photos were taken on Saturdays. But look at the difference. In 1986, it was packed. In 2024, not so much. The black-and-white image below is a bit later, c. 1991, but there’s still a throng.\n\nAs far as I know, Toymaster has been gone for decades. And truth be told, I can’t remember exactly where it was. But I do know it was somewhere upstairs – because, when you went in, there were stairs down to a lower level. That’s where they kept the good stuff: the models, the Milliput, and – when they had them – the lead-based mini-figs! My memory is fuzzy, but I suspect it wasn’t too far away from here:\n\nWhich I believe is captured in the shot, below. The Gym at the end has partitioned off the old corridor.\n\nTeviot Walk\n\nIf you were driving, the main way into ‘Phase IV’ of the Town Centre (no-one actually called it that #IRL) was from the carpark at the eastern end – to the left of the roundabout in the picture below. Nowadays, it’s been ‘augmented’ with a huge feature entrance.\n\nTo begin with, the area to the left of the entrance was a supermarket – initially, the Scottish retailer, William Low. My parents rarely went there. But I do remember one ocassion on a Friday evening after school in the autumn of 1983. As a reward for helping out (or was it as a bribe to stop me pestering them?), I was allowed one of the new 500 ml cans of Coca Cola!!! Remember them? If that wasn’t memorable enough, I enjoyed it in my brother and my bedroom a bit later on while watching the must-see new TV show on our tiny black-and-white TV – The A-Team!!! It wasn’t until 1984, that the show moved to its more familiar Saturday tea-time slot.\n\nA few years later, when the shop was taken over by Tesco, there was a bit of a teenage gold rush. The new shopping trolleys were coin-operated, you see. You had to feed a 20 pence piece into the handlebars to release them from their trolley prison. Until the customers cottoned on to what was happening, there was a gang of helpful young men offering to take empty trolleys back to the cage, then trousering the 20p. Unsurprisingly, it didn’t last.\n\nWalking in past the supermarket on the way to Menzies took you along Teviot Walk, and past all manner of top-tier retail outlets. Jewellery, underwear, sausages, you name it. Between them, they had it all. Or at least, they had the limited selection of ‘all’ that their tiny footprints gave them space to keep in stock.\n\nA bit further in and you’d pass Michael Snowden’s beautiful sculptures. They brought a level of sophistication to Cumbernauld Town Centre in the 1980s and 1990s, which I haven’t seen in the years since. That makes it all the more depressing that in 2024, the self-same sculptures have been dumped in the smokers’ garden outside ‘Spoons – (dis)tastefully suqeezed between the carpark and the dual-carriageway. Michael’s still with us – and in his 90s. I hope nobody’s told him.\n\nWhen I went to visit the Town Centre in late January 2024, there had just been two major storms. They’d caused some major damage to the roof – some of which had collapsed down in to the mall! With the affected area covering most of Teviot Walk, it was closed off with substantial barriers at both ends – making it difficult to get convincing modern-day photos from the same angles. I did my best, but I might have to go back at some point before they knock it all down and try again!\n\nEDIT: 11th August 2024: I had the chance to revisit yesterday. Very little of the damage caused by the storms seems to have been properly fixed. There are still drip troughs and water stains everywhere, and parts of the mall are still cordonned off. I was able to get some up-to-date comparisons for "
