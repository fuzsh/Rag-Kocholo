Sports\n\nAcademy of Champions: Soccer Nintendo Wii\n\nRating: R0\n\nDate Added: Sep 23, 2022\n\nSummary: Academy of Champions: Soccer is a soccer game which focuses on arcade action. The player takes the role of a new initiate at the Brightfield Academy which teaches soccer. Depending on the chosen gender of the playing character, the mentor is either PelÃ¨ or Mia Hamm which are both retired soccer athletes. Here the player advances the career by participating in training mini games and matches, talking to other people, choosing teammates, buying stat-boosting equipment or using earned experience points to improve four ability scores. This mode is the heart of the game and otherwise there are only the options to play mini games or a quick match.\n\nThe arcade approach is most obvious on the field itself: each team consists of only five athletes and each player has a special talent which is a over-the-top super move. It can only be activated when the associated bar is filled with successful actions. However, it is also drained by performing small moves like dodging or sprinting. During matches there are also frequent mini games (mostly hammering buttons) to decide duels between two athletes. The whole game is presented in a comic look and there are cameos of characters from other Ubisoft franchises. The controls are either simplified (only Remote) or standard (Remote and Nunchuk); the MotionPlus and Balance Board support is only for specific mini games.\n\n3002 Active Life: Extreme Challenge Nintendo Wii Namco Bandai R0 Aug 2009 Kids & Family 3003 Active Life: Magical Carnival Nintendo Wii Namco Bandai R0 Oct 2011 Ganbarion Co., Ltd.

It was the first in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. The game is a detective murder-mystery; it begins with nine people, including Patrick Narracott, the playable character, who meet and journey to the fictional Shipwreck Island. There, two additional onscreen characters are introduced, and the story then follows the events that unfold. And Then There Were None retains most of the basic plot elements of Agatha Christie's novel of the same name; the major differences are the inclusion of the playable character, Patrick Narracott, and the creation of a range of possible endings. To further the connection between the game and its source material, Christie's novel was included in the North American PC release of the game. Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None was followed by two more games, Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express and Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun. Since they were based on their respective novels, their plots were unrelated to this first game. Reactions to the game were mixed, with many reviewers polarized in their opinions: some calling it a good adaptation of the novel; others, an extremely poor adventure game. Several reviews harshly criticized the game's character design and graphics as being archaic and outdated, whereas others praised aspects such as character dialogue and a captivating story.\n\n3005 Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun Nintendo Wii The Adventure Company R0 Dec 2008 Adventure\n\nAgatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun Nintendo Wii\n\nUPC: 0625904543943\n\nRating: R0\n\nRegion: 1\n\nASIN: B001E2EAMW\n\nDate Added: Jul 11, 2011\n\nSummary: How does a millionaire wind up with a phony diamond?

Machineguns Nintendo Wii\n\nRating: R0\n\nDate Added: Apr 30, 2015\n\nSummary: Arcade Hits Pack: Gunblade NY and L.A. Machineguns is a collection of two Sega light-gun rail shooter arcade games, Gunblade NY: Special Air Assault Force and L.A. Machineguns: Rage of the Machines, which ran on Sega's Model 2 and Model 3 arcade hardware respectively. Both titles share a similar premise: android terrorists attack a peaceful state of America (New York and California respectively) in the near future, and it's up to a counter-terrorist squadron force to neutralize the hostiles and free the state(s) by air via a gunship.\n\nGunblade NY and L.A. Machineguns also share similar gameplay: both games are on-rails shooters which have you fly around specific loci of the areas you traverse in, gunning down enemy androids with infinite ammo. Enemy A.I. can also be completely aggressive and evasive depending on the difficulty setting the games are set to. However, what differentiates L.A. Machineguns from Gunblade NY in terms of gameplay is it's addition of complex features such as a new chain combo system, civilians (which you must avoid shooting at), and a significantly more linear pace than Gunblade NY's.\n\nThis port includes additional features such as new unlockable weapons and online leaderboards. Also supports the Wii Zapper.\n\n3020 Arcade Shooting Gallery Nintendo Wii Zoo Games R0 Nov 2009 Kids & Family 3021 Arcade Zone Nintendo Wii Activision R0 Sep 2009 Arcade, Various 3022 Arctic Tale Nintendo Wii DSI Games R0 Dec 2007 Adventure 3023 Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Back to School Nintendo Wii THQ R0 Nov 2010 ImaginEngine Kids & Family\n\nAre You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Back to School Nintendo Wii\n\nRating: R0\n\nDate Added: Sep 23, 2022\n\nSummary:\n\n3024 Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Game Time Nintendo Wii THQ R0 Oct 2009 ImaginEngine Kids & Family\n\nAre You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Game Time Nintendo Wii\n\nRating: R0\n\nDate Added: Sep 23, 2022\n\nSummary: Game Time is the follow-up to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?: Make the Grade and it is based on the concept of the TV show where contestants try to prove they are smarter than fifth graders.

Your job is to roll into color-filled machines, which fill you with that color, and then touch buildings, walls, billboards, trees and Graydiants to restore their color. You can mix colors by rolling into two different primary colors (for example, blue and yellow gives you green). Some buildings are secured and cannot be colored simply by touching them - instead, de Blob jumps inside them and the player must shake the Wii Remote to fill them with color.\n\nEach area has gates that are sealed up - these can be opened by earning enough points. Points can be earned for all sorts of things - painting blocks of buildings, freeing Graydiants, completing challenges, and more. Once the player has earned enough points, they'll open up the exit to the level and can leave whenever they wish.\n\nThere are also hazards for de Blob - water will wash off your color, and you'll steadily lose your supply of paint if you remain in it. There are also ink pools and I.N.K.T. agents which stain you black if you let them. When black, any of your colored objects that you touch lose their color, and your supply of paint drains much faster than normal.\n\n3109 de Blob 2 Nintendo Wii THQ R0 Feb 2011 Halfbrick Studios, Blue Tongue Entertainment Puzzle\n\nde Blob 2 Nintendo Wii\n\nRating: R0\n\nDate Added: Apr 30, 2016\n\nGameplay: Single-player video game, Multiplayer video game\n\nSummary: de Blob 2, previously known as de Blob: The Underground, is a sequel to the Wii exclusive 2008 platformer, de Blob.

The game was published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane. It is the first game in the series to be developed by Neversoft after Activision's acquisition of RedOctane and MTV Games' purchase of Harmonix, the previous development studio for the series. The game was released worldwide for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 in October 2007, with Budcat Creations assisting Neversoft on developing the PlayStation 2 port and Vicarious Visions solely developing on the Wii port respectively. Aspyr Media published the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X versions of the game, releasing them later in 2007.Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock retains the basic gameplay from previous games in the Guitar Hero series, where the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of lead, bass, and rhythm guitar parts in rock songs by playing in time to scrolling notes on-screen. The game, in addition to existing single-player Career modes, includes a new Co-Op Career mode and competitive challenges that pit the player against in-game characters and other players. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the first game in the series to include an online multiplayer feature, which is enabled in the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 versions. Initially the game offers over 70 songs, most of which are master tracks. Another aspect in the game was DLC (downloadable content) which allowed players to purchase songs, tracks, and characters. One of the most popular DLC packs was the Dr. pack. It included three characters. Dillan The Tatortot, Andrew the certificate ripper, and Julio Caesar. Another popular DLC pack was the song pack called Perales. It included the hit song Dr.Lopez by Perales. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature the ability to download additional songs. The musicians Tom Morello (of the bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave) and Slash (of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver) make appearances both as guitar battle opponents and playable characters in the game. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions also include Bret Michaels (of Poison) as a non-playable character.Critics were generally favorable towards the game, but reviewers noted a difference in the game's style compared to previous installments, associating it with it being Neversoft's first development attempt with the series. The game is often cited to be too difficult, creating \"walls of notes\" that are difficult to complete, and led to alterations in note placement for future games in the series. According to Activision, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the best-selling video game of 2007, both in terms of units sold and revenue earned, and that it is the first single retail video game to exceed one billion dollars in sales. The company also claimed that it is the second-best selling video game title since 1995, following Wii Play, and is one of the best-selling third-party games available for the Wii.\n\n3197 Gummy Bears Minigolf Nintendo Wii Storm City Games R0 Nov 2010 Beyond Reality Games Ltd.

The game takes place in prehistory - you play as Scrat, the hapless (but not totally helpless!) proto-squirrel, helping your friends escape the coming of a huge flood.\n\nThe WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions. Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice), and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you \"shoot\" at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.\n\n3218 Igor: The Game Nintendo Wii SouthPeak Games R0 Sep 2008 Mistic Software Inc.
