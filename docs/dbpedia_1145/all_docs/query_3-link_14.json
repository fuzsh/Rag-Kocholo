        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nFefnirIRL\n\n20%PlayStation 2\n\n3h 17m Played\n\nRygar initially drew me in because I'm a huge mythology nerd and that's not a super popular setting to put a video game in, (minus the God of War series, which Rygar precedes). Unfortunately, a cool setting wasn't anywhere near enough to salvage this mess of a game.\n\nPlaying as Rygar should make you feel like an actual Greek hero, someone who is unfallible and could only be bested by the mightiest of foes. This is not the case however, as Rygar is extremely susceptible to any attack and will flinch at the slightest provacation, even if he is in the middle of flailing around the unwieldy Diskarmor. Not only do the smallest of attacks make you flinch and reset your combo, but you'll also find yourself frequently knocked onto the ground or juggled through the air. I really didn't have the impression that Rygar was a powerful hero of any sorts while I played.\n\nAnother thing that didn't help was the fixed camera angles. I understand this was commonplace at the time, so I don't fault the game for using them necessarily, but some of the placements were just absurd and the controls did me no favors here, either. Half of the time, I would enter a new area and be presented with a different angle, at which point Rygar would immediately turn around and go back to the previous area because god forbid I hold the analog stick in the same direction. It was doubly annoying in certain arenas, as some enemies have significant knockback and each attack would dump me into the next screen and I'd have to reorient myself in order to re-challenge them.\n\nThe story is about as basic as it gets. Rygar is a hero, everyone's happy as the princess rewards him, but oh no! Bad guys show up and take the princess. Go get her. Also here's the Diskarmor, a legendary weapon which can only be wielded by... checks notes Someone who truly knows battle. What a riveting backstory for such a legendary artifact such as this.\n\nThe Legendary Adventure also features an upgrade system where you can dump points into one of your three Diskarmors, each with a unique(ish) moveset and summon ability. This felt largely unnecessary as it hardly increased your combat capabilities and you were very restricted in the resources you got; upgrading from level 1 to 2 on a certain Diskarmor would cost you 1000 points, and from 2 to 3, a mere 3000. By the end of the game, though I had not been stingy in breaking objects and fighting mobs for these \"Build Up\" points, I was only able to fully upgrade one Diskarmor and had to leave the other two by the wayside.\n\nThe ending section is really what sealed Rygar's fate for me. From Icarus on, you're faced with back-to-back poorly designed boss battles that are filled with undamageable bosses, sweeping AOEs that were undodgeable if you wanted to follow up with an attack of your own at all, tiny hitboxes with only a few frames you could actually hit it, and so on. I could go on about each boss battle during the ending sequence, but the point is that they were all infuriating and skillless spam fests.\n\nUltimately, I can praise the game for maybe the intended vision at best, as the actual finished product is something I would not recommend wasting time on. I know there was a Wii port/remake that came later that I'm interested in trying, just to see if any improvements were made or if it's by and large the same game, but the PS2 entry is more than welcome to remain as nothing more than a memory.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nCivilwarfare101\n\n70%Emulated\n\n5h Played\n\nWhile it has it's bad parts, mainly with the giant sized boss fights, I think the game is pretty enjoyable, it feels like weird and jankier precursor to God of War which I know is a comparison that has been said to death but it's hard not to see it even if it is ultimately Tecmo Koei trying to get a piece of the Onimusha pie that Capcom had with the whole monster killing mythological fantasy action game.\n\nIt is impressive what was done here, the world suprisingly feels interconnected despite it named like worlds in a platformer. You will be running around and backtracking a lot and learning new abilites to open new pathways or solve some seal puzzle, it also had a grappling hook before God of War 2 did all though GOW2 did it a lot better. There is also combat and platforming basically everything before GOW before GOW would do it even though GOW is tighter and more polished, but this game's execution of these ideas are decent enough in own right since this generally combines so many elements like action, adventuring and platforming and rarely do they overstay their welcome. Rygar also has the follow cam before GOW as well.\n\nThe Onimusha inspirations can be seen in how there are weapons that can all be upgraded to level 3 with enemies you kill giving currency.\n\nNow this is all the good and honestly the only big issues with the game is that giant size enemies are a pain in the ass in that they are hard to hit, the lack of an actual dodge command can be a pain and the worst part is that bosses can hit you and then hit you again while you are getting up after the invinciblity frames wear off, a quick button tap to get up would greatly help. And that extended platforming section\n\nin Aracdia is also really bad due to how easy it is to miss jumps due to the fixed camera, this isn't as bad Devil May Cry 4. The voice acting is also pretty bad but you can view it in a so bad it's entertaining kind of way.\n\nOverall, for a game that was a weird indirect precursor to God of War, it's solid especially with no development hindsight to go off of."
