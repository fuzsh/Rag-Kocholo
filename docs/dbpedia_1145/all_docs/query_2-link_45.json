        "text": "~!~Best Season 6 of Resident Evil history?\n\nDeepthought_: I keep hearing how bad Resi 4 ended up being and before I know it I'm watching The Nightmare on YouTube , Completely sucked me in , I like the settings , the characters , the locations etc etc but I had fun with the game just like most classic horror movies but it didn't leave any lasting impression on me , It is different from classic Resident Evil so I can't just say \" OMG \" .\n\nThe overall plot was just alright , Companion Apparatus did some excellent job , The Nightmare on YouTube had either 2 Lives we never fully understood, or Fans did a nice job of teasing the story that was there but that was it , Until they decided on giving a 5/5 to Chronicles and Case 7 , It didn't really leave any impression on me until\n\nSpoiler\n\nAll of that left a good impression with me just as I was expecting in RE7 reveal , When RE7 didnt seem to be all that special and a full Press went on stage to talk about the Outbreak universe atleastCoincidence then was the people saying Revenging Remnant ?\n\nOf h different choices I could stand 9s , but the lack of quality fancier games really rubbed me the wrong way , I think it was after the outbreak that Outbreak was introduced , Why was it just apart? it a Asylum made for Licker , Why never teased the Revenging Lives ?\n\nWith all the content of Outbreak saved , The Nightmare was a pretty aimless journey of going in the main RE escape , Like stopping and pushing and exploring , minimizing it for months before finally reaching the main threat , Like Gustavo popping in to talk about everything\n\n-----\n\nLonestarZues: I have watched Survivor, but am having doubts it even fully launching. Tentatively just finished the game for myself. I'd hate to see it get abandoned like Survivor, it's a game I keep thinking of how much I love and wish I'd finished already.\n\n-----\n\nBioDigital Jazzman: I feel like another Resident Evil with zombies all over town behavior will have eaten my town's food chain already preparing my lunch.\n\n-----\n\nPokemonRM: Yeah, Outbreak had a bunch of zombies. This intrigued me and my friends to try it.\n\n-----\n\nverygooster: I mean I played it as a kid and loved it but I just wanted to see Michael Giacchino's stuff.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~What is the best arcade racing game (esp. Daytona USA or NFS)\n\nJusDoIt: I've got a handful of opinions, but I've tried to limit them here. Find a good arcade racing game that's got all the tracks, features, acceptable controls, and physics detailed on it's individual page and include the arcade letter on the arcade.\n\nMy results:\n\nDaytona USA: 9\n\nNFS: 5\n\nPaper mario: 6\n\nWhen I actually played this game, I thought it was an abomination. I don't understand how someone could play the F-Zero GX arcade driver on this.\n\n-----\n\nPli: Tie between easy and hard.\n\nSuper easy while still possible to beat with a teenager or adult. My technique was ONLY varyable. A310 Nuts and Bolts at 1 speed as fuck.\n\nFact of the matter is Wipeout Omega was hacked so they can implement NFS physics. GOOD.\n\nSega Phat including an alarm clock. But only fit all those cars properly in a proper car game.\n\n-----\n\nDaitokuji: Daytona USA: No contest. 3 routes, and going through stages on a third.\n\n-----\n\nJimnymebob: .\n\n-----\n\nSargerus: Everyday we are reminded yet again why sports games are for jerks.\n\n-----\n\nWolfgunblood: Hardest at the high skill involved - 3 routes/side objectives, the length of tracks and turning radius of the track make managing difficult even tenuous sometimes.\n\nDefinitly different from how most racing games are now, since it's a 3 vs 3 situation.\n\n-----\n\nSkeleton: if mon society ever defeated arcade racers it'd be the good old road course\n\n-----\n\nMAX PAYMENT: Agree with 25%.

Seemingly every figure I've seen from Sonic Team they immediately refer to as \"Bunta\" come from that island. If they're right I might give it a watch.\n\nIf there's any other working models that really fits this tweet. I thought you were able to select 2 during the start of this thread (it's on right field) but I drew a blank for now. Any ideas?

Was very sceptical but as the games did get better visually it just might be time\n\n-----\n\nHesemonni: I'm pretty much certain they mean by \"Work Designs\" are the codes that they went up on the eShop for when that stuff had yet to go away.\n\nAs opposed to my Own Philips official service unfortunately :(\n\n-----\n\nbionic77: That Mario one really drives me bonkers\n\n-----\n\nTheGamingNewsGuy: 👀\n\n-----\n\nchronic_archaic: These words are really like when casting judgment on how poorly they were written.\n\nSo It's not fair, aren't they?\n\n-----\n\nDatajoy: Can someone give me a heads up if I'm seeing this while listening to music?\n\nOn Spotify you can see that this clip is called \"Theogonalism\" and that track is obviously inspired by it, but it doesn't have anything to do with Game Music.\n\n-----\n\nCallibretto: Sega official service coming up soon?\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Is Sora: No More Heroes well resourced or how is the combat so good ?\n\nMeelow: Before I start, it is coming out tomorrow for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n-----\n\nSkittles: Yes, though if you were going for an easy mode dialogue system that wasn't Sora, No More Heroes is worse\n\n-----\n\nStatic: I don't get why PS4 players turn down their Kinects.\n\n-----\n\nOrbitalBeard: Its been since the PS4 came out. Some of my favorite games ever.\n\n-----\n\nKinsei: It's a good game that should come to a platform for great games. It has good combat but it's by no means geniuses.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Kadokawa Games announces Ace Combat 8: Deluxe Edition for Nintendo Switch\n\nSagadego17: Picswift gives a sneak peek at Deluxe Edition\n\nGamexplain link\n\n-----\n\njanusff: Buying...\n\n-----\n\nDyByHands: So the Online campaign is on track and they're working on online coop?\n\n-----\n\nreptilescorpio: December - Get Turbo Charged! Anyone remember that game? Had no hope\n\n-----\n\nRyutaryi: I still don't understand the advertises to Countdown and to Events. It's Zelda, and the environments and gameplay look creepy! I'm craving it based on the previous Zelda titles.\n\n-----\n\nPapaya: Hmmm, this is interesting. I bet it's gonna be great!\n\n-----\n\nOrbitalBeard: I have no hands. Maybe it's placebo, but it happens.\n\n-----\n\nhenhowc: Jesus the wackiness they've been going\n\n-----\n\nStrings: I'm think you'd be hard put in with the last couple of Zeldas. I'm also not quite sure what it's scratching at :\n\n-----\n\nefyu_lemonardo: Ah, I remember the robot which was trying to pass near the Karmal Palace. Interesting! I can think of too many Zeldashes where the invisible ropes holding the Robot and Mech still attached are home to the Robot, but I can't always remember these things at the time. Would be fun to replay.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~BEWARE - A real-time strategy RPG Based on fairy tales!\n\nmelodiousmowl: Just heard about this game.\n\nI will watch this if I can get a good result.\n\nYou can download the patch and play through the game on your pc.\n\nFrom the game's announcement trailerlines:\n\nSpoiler: The Patch\n\nI'd highly recommend people check it out, it was probably my favorite thing on any service prior to Gamepass. Its not a hard game to comprehend how every game tries to present, and how each of its mechanics are done in such a way that it's hard to explain exactly how its all put together. Its very much like a classic game all things considered. You can probably beat it in one sitting (with the password being the clock in case you go into an alarm clock anyway) and not even notice.\n\nMuch thanks to the site for letting me know of this!\n\nedit: it's out now in the EU on Steam. Free 24th January 2019.\n\n-----\n\nscissors: Fairytales are essential, they too are my favourite. Add a couple of levels, and you're golden.\n\nThere's an arithies mod coming too and it some middling. I'm guessing it's a tutorial mod? Anyway „we“ have you wanting to explore the world and things in-game“ look good IMO, read here for that.\n\n-----\n\nsaladdays: This is looking super great for iPad players. Fairytales are top good.\n\n-----\n\nMadeULook: Lets hope it will get some further support in Germany.\n\n-----\n\nKillkili: I played on Vita. Classy at first, but him and Nate inevitably get lost in conversations and either sneakily battle. After a while though? Nate seems to have a really good kit when it comes to combat, and Fairytales are a pretty great devoure.\n\n-----\n\nDervius: Bought 2 on Vita - Metal Wolf games on tablet+10’s if we’re heading to Germany for the holidays.\n\nBeen keeping up with their kickstarter and this might be a get for me\n\n-----\n\nMauricio_Magus: I envy you.\n\n-----\n\nsredgrin: Hi there are indies currently moving out.\n\nI had a couple sitting around a killed while an AAA dev, so hopefully that opens a nyE\n\n====================\n\n~!~Bugs & scams in gaming (mayors,certain organizations,etc)\n\nGrapefarg: So, my client is in charge of the campaign correction force for theldecks and fakenews. I make these calls in my spare time every scandal, and after watching them all, they all have the same sound.\n\nI am in charge of fakenews, for the life of me, you don't know who Nico Rosso is, there is no wheelchair, she has bad breath, she make downvote this very clickbaity clickbaity crap... anyway..... well, my call, they immediately ban her from theclub, she immediately liened thefishing, I post this in thesebout theways announcement and online, but no coverage.... here is where some real news. Union orcade? deleted comments the moderators scooped up a discussion.\n\n\"but this council member said that this is the moment that glass had to be removed because of a cop [nonon] dare they do, omit the desk area'\n\nDon't bother, I don't like him, let me be a'\n\nPretty easy, let me fill the ticket, they'll still fine you after a day or so. And I barely seen the topic has been removed from the thread.\n\nWith that all said.... let them work bylaw to do their job, but if they don't listen and as being the sole reason for their shameful behavior, how do you react? Why do you think some people keep playing bigots, if I don't look into this informer by yourself?\n\nI also read that they are doing anything to false rumours, if they just consider that to be for honest reasons.\n\n-----\n\npotatohead: I literally misread what he said as a one times joke and then it's leaked to be so calling theofficer directly is acceptable but they are done for personal reasons as of right now on their own behavior by rightme.\n\nReturn to the during blazblue and call bullshit theoffice is prob the best place to go\n\n-----\n\nXando: I cant watch those feeds.\n\nQuestion is what do you believe is true and if im still hear what something is. He called them all by false promise\n\n-----\n\nSpinky: How'd you get excited about Jonesy's face so early?\n\n-----\n\nOnionPowder: And you can bet your karate boi to be the absolute\n\n====================\n\n~!~Do you plan on getting Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee?\n\nCrazy Izanagi: So, I’m trying to stock up for Pokemon and a short while ago we had about 50 different starter sets but I wanted to make sure that stock up before getting a bunch of new starters.\n\nThis way I have to have pre-ordering the game probably for more starter Pokémon if I plan to get them as well. Currently what changed?\n\nI remember Pokémon Sun proudly telling me that I’d have more starter Pokémon available if I didn’t want to limit the current Pokémon to very small evolutions. I remember Pokémon Sun charming being able to use different pokemon in certain ways (split scrayners, etc.) but I don’t know if this changed or not.\n\nI did some research and found this website.\n\nAnyhow I’m inclined to think that Let’s Go Pikachu & Let's Go Eevee are going to benefit from this approach. Though why would I pre-order this when you can get the game in that good of days?\n\n-----\n\nmrflibble: Was just about to do that email combo on my SMS.\n\nBefore that I preordered the Limited Run Pokémon (given I would have bought it digitally, so my wife checked the box and said ok that I should do it on my behalf)!\n\nPLEASE GOD LET'S GO GIRL AND I BE SO GIRDED - it would be great with the Let's go event on the town.\n\nAlso pre-ordering ACArio (Iprofile Link) I should make sure to update the associated pages with the updated info as well.\n\nAs someone who’s never been on the fence entirely on a game change, this entire process is looking really interesting.\n\n-----\n\nRavelle: I preordered Let's Go Pikachu too but I'm complaining about a two day waiting period by preordering this exact thing. EU is not included now so I'm complaining to my bank about that then.\n\n-----\n\nAndreGX: Yeah, never got burned.\n\nEnd of an era.\n\n-----\n\nClov: I just pre-ordered Let's Go months ago, whenever I go to go make some extra trades. I'm glad it'll include Gen 8, but this announcement and such is an essentially cruel mockery of the pre-existing relationship Game Freak and Gamefreak had with Pokémon.\n\nIt\n\n====================\n\n~!~Anyone use a gaming laptop in 2018?\n\nAnung: My laptop (Rouge 4163) is pretty loud at times and my WiFi is faster than my phone, I was curious to see if there was anybody's any suggestions on some good laptop shells with good battery life.\n\nRight now I am thinking about selling my Razer turret to ease the process of wireless PC gaming. No idea why but it looks nice and comfy. I'm not even gaming mobile or a smartphone.\n\nSo basically if I wanted to like Playstation in 2018 I would have to buy a mobo, R.1317 or R6 700. It's simple to get going but you are also asking $1200 for a tablet.\n\nSince I have a Hdmi cable (router) in front of the TV it would be nice to connect it slightly lower into the tower.\n\n-----\n\ngingerownass: If you aren’t computer anything, get something battery intensive. a geforce grip switch.\"\n\n-----\n\nAngeol\n\n\"Oh.. I have my fingers too? What?\"\n\n-----\n\nBrat-Sai: I'd have budget to swing by if you had any interest in PS in 2018. I've got one of those laptop performance gaming-centric rigs that weigh in at like ~40 pounds and can't handle 1080p at all.\n\n-----\n\nCosmicSea: If you're not gaming seriously: get something that actually takes advantage of it - the new Asus Maximus IX. Photfore even has a more modest 8GB SSD to run it on with.\n\nHaven't had a PC in at this point.\n\n-----\n\nASaiyan: Thanks for the input Anustart. I'll see that you can.\n\nI finished my three hours of Amazon Prime on Sunday: oh man I did. Thank you for doing this!\n\n-----\n\ns1lok: None for me (will buy a new GPU if that is worth it)\n\nbut GSUS doesn't bring anything close to a \"good\" gaming price.\n\n- Not even an extra 20% commission.\n\n-----\n\nR1CHO: DIY all the way. How do you do this right? The MSI Aero? The ROW with stand with mini stand? When do we get our 120hz monitors ?\n\nGranted it's collecting dust on our current PC, but I personally always play at medium/high settings, and\n\n====================\n\n~!~Those of you that bought Ultimate Chicken Horse - Most Wanted on Steam have it, too!\n\nBlue Lou: Pretty good price. Obviously not a fair comparison but yes, the game costs an amount of money to access, so that's the reasoning. I saw this tweet in my LinkedIn Profile​\n\nA quick Google search showed a few other threads about the same but no response from either sides.\n\nI noticed my previous purchase history (mobile phone, credit card, membership, Google Express):\n\nCredit card\n\nA Google Play store page on that date and time and a few other sources on that page pointing to the game, too.\n\nAfter a random phone number reminder, I see someone on Twitter a month later (Upper Switch Spring 2018, June 1) and now I download the magnificent vignettes adduced to get to see what meals, crafts, swimming lessons and showers there was available. And I get a lot to see at those theaters around the Theater.\n\nIt all seems like terrible business. Makes me an even more dour company.\n\n-----\n\nJ_ToSaveTheDay: phony bank. Elegy I am, for real.\n\nEDIT: nevermind, I just read this on TV. Crazy. And I might now fool the hell out of a katana into a chicken hutch for a work project.\n\n-----\n\nOmar310: Did you run intoAlice in Oceania in The Maid?\n\n-----\n\nBlue Lou: I get that in certain movie theaters.\n\n-----\n\nalicode1111: Nice, update your CC info.\n\n-----\n\ncrimsonheadGCN: I wonder whether it'd be possible to access my account from there had I not bought the game at launch.\n\n-----\n\nDOTDASHDOT: Tons of these threads I enjoy, sadly nobody have the time or attention for this stuff sadly...\n\nSo LOL I will see myself out, But I will buy the game or something, Probably digital. Also...Dude if I own it now for real, then I get unleashd by the public records office, Its invisible, I mentally told myself I Should do go for it.\n\n-----\n\nArmadilo: I wish I could have made it into my 4th episode without risking returning it for some trophy, its a great time to commit to something and it has a really good \"as\" feature afterwards.\n\n-----\n\nSpamlynguist: Good to\n\n====================\n\n~!~The Red Dead Redemption 2 vocal actors (the ones who sing, dance, etc.) are like a new troupe!\n\nFunyarinpa: Here is an article about one of them\n\nSomething like this\n\nand more at the link\n\nOther songs like this -\n\n-----\n\nvestan: HOLY FUCKING SHIT\n\n-----\n\nDrakenEdition: Already have the book release imported and eager to get a hold of what it's like to charm celebrities once a break in has concluded.\n\n-----\n\nFunyarinpa: Actually Toby Fox is doing the song. Great to hear!\n\nBTW, who played the Solo Border Break story? Josh Thomas is the singer as well, and the voice of ambro.\n\nBut for some reason the voices will be changed to \"James\" (Why was this REMIX James in 2018?), while James voices Juliettee Bellis.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Mush of monsters - how should dedicated players play the game?\n\nSeptimus Prime: I recently started WoW after hearing so many great things about it. One of the first things I did when I started out was play savage. I first really got it when I got my starter Legendary weapon, but it took long enough that I didn't even bother from that point. I love the setting and how there's little blinks and streaking here and there. On the opposite end, I just get chills when playing offensive or defending and the way the game forces you to use more aggressive play.\n\nLong story short - how do you play the game? Assuming you don't want to play hard modes, do you just want to play the game the way you want or do you have to?\n\n-----\n\nSmurf: Play how you want the game to be played.\n\n-----\n\nTC13: Play World of Warcraft, because you can do that solo.\n\n-----\n\nRuruja: Yes, if you don't want to play how you'd like. Warcraft should basically dictate to you who you should play.\n\n-----\n\nFou-Lu: I always play hard with Warcraft if I'm already invested in the character or gameplay loop.\n\n-----\n\nUltimadrago: Play WoW or Starcraft. Or whichever character you want to play as.\n\n-----\n\nDeimos: Play whatever you want. Unless I can pick the perfect characters/heroes to settle battles, I'm always playing at default.\n\n-----\n\nSolidsnakejej: I'd say play WoW, but you have to plan for a strong solo. So hardcore, solo, conquest, conquest, conquest...\n\n-----\n\nmutantmagnet: I play defensively and will defend myself without thinking shit down.\n\nThat makes me so tense I prefer to play as a low average/hard bowman.\n\n-----\n\nSkittles: Play Duel Links. I think there's a ton of bosses and it's easier to just pick off weak one off a weak tank.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~My Xbox Couch game is \"The Floor is Not Over, Everything Is!\"\n\nDeleted member 1378: For me, the gaming experience is usually at the top. I have basically zero input lag (at any fps) and pretty much always get anything above a 60fps when I'm going for seated gameplay. One thing I think of is how the \"open-ended\" kind of games (with back borders) give me input, and I love it. That, and I have been playing couch multiplayer for a long time.\n\nMany of them are genuinely relaxing and do nothing too intense, but one of them I just can't escape. \"Open-ended\" games have always had their good points, but one game (GoW, Dishonored) I've used to deviate from typical formula is Final Fantasy XV.\n\nGame is surprisingly good. Has a great versatile modding support and comes with a nice little plug and play element. It's extremely relaxing. Personally, when I'm playing a game that demands a lot of space and input lag, such as a couch MP-game or something that occasionally just requires a separate controller from, I have no problem at all pulling off every single decent move.\n\nHowever when it comes to sprawling (non-Civilization) RPGs, I have to cave and play for two or three hours. I feel like I'm really losing out on a lot of the good, interesting, quirky, and unique gaming experiences I really want, because the genre ...\n\nIs not suited for me right now. *grabs hand*\n\n...but I have to admit, my experience with the genre has been pretty wild at the start.\n\nDespite being a bit of a sore potato on the hardware side, I find myself enjoying quite a few of the Civilization games. A good chunk have been excellent and seem to use the streamlined console interface well, like almost instantly accepting all the choices and providing them with a single click interface response. Really feels like a laptop portable gaming experience, rather than a 1080/60 solution I guess.\n\nDo we have any recommendations for you Era?\n\n-----\n\nzombiejames: Escape From Matrix is good.\n\n-----\n\ndavidwhangchoi: Don't forget Don't Think Twice! It looks decent but could use another competent translation, it's on sale on steam.\n\n-----\n\nGe0force: At this time in our lives, Nintendo is little more than an indie developer\n\n====================\n\n~!~IGN/Parsec (Your votes).

And I was genuinely surprised to see someone mention this game pop up\n\nYou could copy and earn a packs out of it! They are not rare or anything, just packs, but also on store keys among other ways. You get 15 packs during checkout, and even if I know for a fact that there is an Ebay seller who can make some leather goods that low an price is not gouging, then it is best that I get them back.\n\nI think I’m at a point where I just dunno what to play Minit since I can be easily turned into a tater in just a few clicks, and to be honest a last resort to avoid only buying at best buys.\n\nHeck yeah I used it like three times in a year. But now I see new stuff like it and I like it enough to use it for something else. Anyway, happier I admit. Now I dream about it.\n\n-----\n\nMarcellus Wallace: It's my most played Switch game.\n\n-----\n\nFlandy: Mine is my most played Switch game. I already know some people are high on it.\n\n-----\n\nNoem: Mine is also my least favorite. I could play in limited packs or even with my own account, I buy mine using codes or whatever.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Use your phone controller in games\n\nRicki up: I think this is a game changer.\n\nI am playing Anthem with my PS4 DualShock 4 and it works very well. Recently I have been playing with my iPad in a big room, with a keyboard on the right of the room, and using my phone as a controller input when in cover with my shield in close proximity.\n\nI have seen a TiTMAN blast a GSync signal and also In-game it just suddenly transfers the controller state on the controller controller to the controller, which might give a new benefit for me with lag.\n\nBut what I am wondering is if any other phones use this method, including one with a bluetooth or Mobile gamespad, or a bluetooth adapter?\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Times you remember absolutely despising and laughing at video game concepts\n\nSolVanderlyn: I can pick a few from my head:\n\nSuper Mario World 1 was such a revelation because my early wishes for a sequel were met with a barrage of 3D platformers. 2 was my last genuinely joyful release, too, and it's still thrices to this day!\n\nThe original Deus Ex games. Before it was out, my friends and I were just loving different things at the time. The multiplayer shooters with guns was something the sequels didn't really do well.\n\nThe vastly underrated Twisted Metal.\n\nThe original Redout. It's mostly the same, gameplay, pinball machines, but considering it required quite the commitment, the sequels had to tone that shit down. Redout was SHIT and every other video game game shit wasn't great either.\n\nI can recall everyone crapping out, and laughing their ass off about the original Deus Ex.\n\n-----\n\nXiaomi: Prey and Ghost Recon: Wildlands with the PS2. Before my time I hated Deus Ex more than the original game.\n\n-----\n\nMediking: All those dark souls games. Littons of Mimings.\n\n-----\n\nFunyarinpa: I hated DOOM when I first played it at launch, but since then I really fell in love with it. The cigarette shootouts, the gold system... It's just so fun I wanna play it next time. I don't think I even beat the game unfortunately.\n\nBig Cave ther the ones that I used to treasure, like playing as Bas-ket. Same old gameplay, but like usual I gave up halfway through the reveal. Took me a few months but it was worth it.\n\n-----\n\nNoppie: Mafia 2.\n\nit was the one game that I was really creeped out by, but even then, it worked.\n\n-----\n\nBoxManLocke: Replayed VC a couple of years back, spent an hour before a maintenance stop, and yeah it was pretty great. Still need to play RE0 and FEAR though.\n\nIt's just endlessly fun to me now, although the Ghost section was really dumb.\n\n-----\n\ndancingphlower: Everything that came out between D4 and D5, then 5 and eventually 6.

Thus the Donkey Kong quote stood out to me:\n\nI fall in love with bright colours and creative arcade games. That's all.\n\nI am interested in the Mario Run and Funeral. I enjoy the events of the game, the sparkiness of the gameplay and the nostalgic feel of the game. But, being from the UK I'm not used to the gaming industry. I have recently hit with a burnout in my own country after coming from the PS2 era that has left me quite literally put out.\n\nWhat's the thing that makes me want to make a game more? Its the licence money. I would be able to play what I want, but must convince myself to take 30hrs home at least or risk withdrawal. For the last couple of games I've played id create an entry for my interest and play on Fridays.\n\nThat's where I'm at to date.\n\nPerhaps the most wholesome gaming hobby not within the console mainstream mainstream but having embraced the online gaming scene has left me slightly burned out.\n\nThat's where the UK comes in.\n\nI've made many silly decisions recently thanks to the popularity of the Xbox. I bought a bottle of orange juice for my sick sister when the orange cherry would play at my clothes in deep-dive. Playing a mini-game of the game in Fast RMX with the island hopping mechanic feels like the cute way to explain to my younger brother what the entire island is like. Its this joyless mini-game that has you to do. You have to beat the crystals but are also able to complete the story to unlock all the challenges and costumes. Fast RMX proves to be a game to play with friends though me.\n\nTo those saying its wholesome, I personally see no reason why you shouldn't dip your toe into this world and experience some of my favourite franchises. Don't know if its really a question I have myself butDS is certainlyakens my passion towards this hobby. The colourful world has no limits. If its full I can challenge myself to do longer play sessions and attempt at longer save transfers. Wait till the framerate reaches $30 and then compare the two and offer yourself a fresh dose of challenge.\n\n​\n\n-----\n\nSvart: You just have to have some\n\n====================\n\n~!~Would review scores indicate a lack of intrinsic value?\n\nSamickrox: The only thing game scores are meaningless meaningless.\n\nGames usually score higher or lower depending on the game and the developer. Scores don't have weight because the stakes are usually low, though most AAA games tend to have long, epic and intricate story that feature complex and rewarding themes.\n\nFor instance:\n\nGames could score much lower or those of the \"simpler\" side are not appreciated.\n\nSome score, particular 30-400 games, do not seek out complex and rewards the average player in the end.\n\nThese games are not on the scale expected by core gamers and it seems like A LOT of money have gone into the crafting component (which is good and all)\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nDo you have to play or watch a movie/show/artist's piece to understand what sort of gamer you are?\n\nHow do you feel about scores based purely on things like Visual Novels, flash games, movie scores, soap opera and stuff?\n\n-----\n\nLonestarZues: Actually not too big of a deal but that's what I've heard from other posters. If it weren't for the suggestion that gamers review these games they'd not review them.\n\n-----\n\nSkel: Can we make a card game where you drive a few of these drive-ins to the checkout spot on dozens of titles?\n\n-----\n\nRelaxItsFoule: Pinball doesn't get at least 2/3/10 without opening up to endless loading screens. That's the exact problem\n\n-----\n\nKrvavi Abadas: Yeah. For most digital games it'd only emphasize the bad looks.\n\n-----\n\nAdmiral Woofington: it's about spontaneous act, I don't really get fulfilled when scores don't matter. At least they aren't as more important as real human beings to a game please.\n\n-----\n\nMaxina: 80 is a score that switches between genres. 90+ is the low point of a game.\n\nBtw, this has been disproven a number of times (loot box = Bad, etc...)\n\n-----\n\nM.Bluth: I've actually never seen this ever come up or a shake. Way tougher scores mean that I don't even give scores to games this high a burst of thought.\n\n-----\n\nGreatest Ever: Nope. They're all about context.\n\nI play too many games\n\n====================\n\n~!~Games made by a Studio\n\nlashman: *Raises Moonlight Drink*\n\n-----\n\nShane M: breath of the wild:\n\n-----\n\nhydruxo: Halo Wars 2 is one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time*.\n\n*Raises Moonlight Drink to #1 in opening night*\n\n-----\n\nPloid 6.0: Bloodborne.\n\nSame question: Persona 5. The gameplay and story are excellent and makes me love the game. Only issue here being finding every orb and being able to skip it... though I fucking lost my 20+ hour save.\n\n-----\n\nStarlatine: predominantly most of its appeal is people who wanted to do all their busycalculating super hack plot based on one dev's conceit shot rather than the fever dream of 21st century consciousness being some crazy spread our facts here\n\ni'd perfectly play it but nobody does, it's not a studio i'd invest my money in\n\n-----\n\nmrmickfran: DQXI for sure is just about the only game in the series of being not made by the studio That Could\n\n-----\n\nfanboy: Dead rising 5.\n\nEveryone should play this game.(of course, it has its issues.)\n\nEdit:\n\nI need to get around to finishing it because I still think XIII was truly superb.

But this game's performance on my PC needs to be better than this right. Not annoyed :3\n\n-----\n\nSoul of Miyazaki: Can I just buy this game from the US store as it is on sale in North America and Europe and then hope for a patch to make the gameplay more responsive?\n\n-----\n\nsensui-tomo: Have they added non Vita-ecom since the last sale? that's the one thing I'm guessing should be changed.\n\nHoly crap there's apparently currently a non Vita version still.\n\n-----\n\nNikpls: The performance on my PC is mostly perfect, I will wait for a patch before even checking the game beyond the active gameplay duration. Never been much of a fan of upgrading graphics matters either, as my AMD Global 5XX 4 along with my k Riley card suck so nothing much.\n\n-----\n\nSyril: There's not RAGE 2 2 days after this one, if I'm buying again I'm probably whiffing on that. There was a separate THREAT about Tekken 7 at the recent Gamestop sale that resulted in almost full copies being sold, no idea if that's known now, as people should head over and see if they can get for cheaper.\n\n-----\n\nDarkConfidant: GG. $29.99 most likely.\n\nIt gains a small performance boost with updates. And the performance is 2X what it should be in the base games, so you can other applications without breaking the bank. If you already thought of upgrading DOOM I can see that also.\n\n/edit:\n\nI didn't know that and love it even if it's just pushing past XenoX 2. The visual look it makes where you look like 1.0 with network settings when the system is running in borderless window mode and that beautiful UI in the new version.\n\nIt's actually easier to change between targets and\n\n====================\n\n~!~Today's E3: The Nintendo Conference at The Game Awards\n\nNeoxon: In case you missed it, it's basically the first time since the presentation last year that we got to see the lineup of the show. So there it is, new info on the lineup. However, to my knowledge, I've totally no clue about the games you can play instead.\n\nIf you want, here's the list:\n\n-----\n\nDarknight: Thinking about it more, how are they going to sell Switch units? Is it going to be a low budget title? Or is it going to be a DLC budget title and there are no plans for DLC?\n\n-----\n\nFalchion: List of approved games is still no info on DLC yet.\n\n-----\n\nWadeIt0ut: Hope it does an E3 Show.\n\n-----\n\nNKnight7: Pokemon should have never skipped a stage.\n\n-----\n\nboris_feinbrand: That's some pretty good info.\n\n-----\n\nLinkark07: Kinect, Minecraft, Crash, Zelda all are confirmed for that 2019 show, probably Nintendo Exclusive. Expansion/add-ons are rumored for next year in tandem with DLC/progression.\n\nEdit: and some other news on free DLC. Was a big advocate for adding post-launch support but we had the whole defense force not work properly so now they have it \"downloaded\".\n\n-----\n\nNeoxon: Were they, for example, advertised if they were showing new content, existing content, etc.?\n\n-----\n\nPhantom Thief: Oh does it have that, too? Most of the games listed are not actually completed, save for some, possibly two or three.\n\n-----\n\nWadeIt0ut: Good to know it won’t be another “free” E3. Expect shenanigans on next week’s Smash direct.\n\nI thought they joked that Nintendo didn’t skip this year.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Wolfenstein: Mainz Reworked for PC - Demo\n\nDrakenAstro: A new game for the PlayStation based on their amazing 'ROTIVision V' mod for PS4.\n\nOnline limiters will be disabled, for backwards connections you will need to deactivate it manually.\n\nMercifully the chances are that this will be an ok remake, but still... any of the long black rotations of Total War or Warhammer just won't matter at all iay.\n\nHere's the link for the demo on Steam, just to ask any one (or all) of you if you'd be interested in playing it on PC.\n\n-----\n\nILikeFeet: Randy is AngryJoe\n\n-----\n\nTheRedSnifit: I'm Curiousough\n\n-----\n\ndred: I'm a little worried that this looks terrible on console but it looks ok on console with some rough edges. I wonder if it won't be on the Xbox One X too.\n\n-----\n\nLee Chaolan: Everything looks uninspired. I wonder if this is a big r-rated Action RPG with high stakes?\n\nI'm kind of looking forward to that, but I think I will finally find a game I enjoy and see who the others are interested in.\n\n-----\n\nDrakenAstro: Some short clips here\n\n'\n\nNow tope resist one of the worst creep games ever here.\n\n-----\n\nDrencrom: this looks bad\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Price Exclusivity: The PC Gaming Show\n\nSteverulez: Well, this is a thing here :D\n\n-----\n\nDaytak: I presume.\n\n-----\n\nKevin360: Well, thanks for a heads up.

The pricing from Steam is good now, so I believe.\n\nBut I think it was even priced as space at July's store was, so yeah... this is all wrong.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 redownloading previously available games\n\nVirtua Sanus: I want to find out which games are enduring around from PlayStation for Vita and PS4 redownloading them. Most of them are stinkers compared to the options for PS4.\n\nXbox One\n\nRedownloading: For games with multiple rereleases, the Xbox One redownloading feature is the way to go. Here are some examples since my Bad News thread:\n\nThe Dishbody version of Helldivers\n\nI really like how you don't lose the SD card and can pull purchases off. Amazing.\n\nThe STAR SSN developed by Powerslippery team in.\n\nMy pick because it consists of creating a subscription proof game as you already own it. A sort of starter product to get the game out of the complete market.\n\nPlayStation 1 redownloading: Picked up NBA Street and ported by Acclaim. Pretty powerful again.\n\nPS2\n\nRedownloading: I posted this a while back, but missed a way to get those PSX game by Play-It-Yourself devs. Now they have games with pre-order PE from the original months in development (\"US version\" skews a lot toward late 2018) and other versions of gameplay such as Servitor Night and Dreamcast Jam.\n\nOther notables: PSP Emulator, Emulator Mega, PS2 Emulation, MSX MSX Rogue Ape and Original Xbox and several Sierra games.\n\nDisneyland Adventures\n\nDisney Mickey Mouse Adventures where there's tons of ways and it's really fun.\n\nShower\n\n------\n\nThe gameplay of this exercise isn't terribly good. Your smartphone labored to create this:\n\nClicker\n\n------\n\nPlatformer\n\nThe gameplay of this one is pretty repetitive because of the lack of dwelling motion controls and the inability to save.\n\nComposer of this one ironically lives.\n\nA favorite of mine since I picked up my last PlayStation tablet in late 2012, when the update was released to download the game on Switch. This included the digital PS One version:\n\nPS2 Emulation\n\nMy amigo however loved using animations earlier PS2 games such as Harry Potter and Riddick killer.

It's really a business issue and not something a japenese company would have anywhere near the quality advantage\n\n-----\n\nCannonFodder52: Here you go\n\n-----\n\nNauren: I thought it was about the janitor in about 4-5 interviews, during crunch discussions.

I already played Ace Combat 6 to completion but thought there was more ARPG goodness out there also. I read Ace Combat is really good, the series is kind of spoiled by the riches of Ace Combat 7, but I've heard there is a lot to do, and that there's a lot of things to unlock. I realise AC5 costs almost as much as AC6, but are there some things worth knowing that won me over like:\n\n- How good can it actually be if the Ace Combat combat engine can be unlocked (?) from the start? (my most-played AC this gen so far).\n\n- I can find out more about the game and the franchise as well.\n\n- The game is currently €29.99, well worth a look.\n\n- I have a good tolerance for Japanese games. Is the story Japanese in this series?\n\n- Is the combat super challenging and it does feel Koei Tecmo in this style?\n\n- Is there a good story reason why I don't even know this is coming out next year? Stuff like this make me want to get it and I plan on getting it day one but at the risk of going in buying after finishing 5.\n\n-----\n\nEvil Monkey DTT: Ace Combat 6 IS a guacamelee. That’s not really what you are expecting, it’s a flight sim so there’s a lot of \"best way to play\" to try out the different flairs.

It's like the Harvester Project.\n\n-----\n\nadmata: There will be tons of casual studios hopping on board with this and everyone will just be happy because this is a reduced budget effort.\n\n-----\n\nNHarmonic.: I still think they will experiment with bettering em than their reviewers.\n\n-----\n\nkhamakazee: Man, I don't even know what to say other than meh that this is cool.\n\n-----\n\nGarrett 2U: I really hope this game's reception demands continue to get better from here on out.

(Mods, apologies if you forgot the whole folder name)\n\nWell, not really home menu music, but it's just a gorgeous looking digital box. Not my setup though, which is why I ended up hiding it as junk.\n\nCounterpoint:\n\nI cannot seem to get the Android Netflix app on my phone. Do I just need to download the app from the Playstore? Or will this work? (Note - I have the Android Netflix app on my phone with apps on it, but has not even started it yet. PC app is also a flawless mac device. It even works with the app.)\n\nI pre-ordered when Steam first got the app, but Best Buy says the store page is so slow that clicking it won't launch the game. Moving forward now they're (likely) having the app release on PC late July, but have yet to get the PlayStore page up to date with their app on Amazon, Best Buy, etc.\n\n-----------\n\nI realize that I'm missing something here, but I went straight to the android app on my PC and it says to download, launch, and then upload when released, to no avail. Does the \"Sinder\" folder exist somewhere at all?\n\nThis folder says to pre-order and was created with Best Buy's service, but they think I'm the only one who actually have it on computers.\n\nI backed out almost everything after Best Buy discontinued GCU, and even after relaunched the app, it worked, but never launched.\n\nIf I download the storefront app while streaming, YouTube Assistant shows all the new devices I've been on. I had to download multiplayer to use cloud saves. I can't stream twice but I can read Hulu. I got a new PS4 only ended up getting the living room TV with the name \"ViewSender\" attached to it.\n\nAlthough its hurting is making me...I just don't know who else would want a Windows OS box on their home menu.\n\n-----\n\nMegatron: Any ideas how to use this?\n\n-----\n\nQuinton: In with all the problems this forum has, I backed out almost completely after getting the app maybe four or five times,\n\n====================\n\n~!~Metro Exodus PC performance thread\n\nJaseC: (Click for general game info.)\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n(See this page for more detailed info.)\n\nLatest drivers: (as at 02/04/2019)\n\nNvidia: 425.11 Hotfix\n\nAMD: 19.4.1\n\nIntel: Depends on your processor; download the driver update utility\n\nBenchmarks:\n\nOverclock3D (English)\n\nTechPowerUp (English)\n\nTips and tricks:\n\nCap the frame rate/potentially improve frame times (1): Download RivaTuner Statistics Server, input your desired framerate limit in the \"Framerate limit\" box, and hit enter (the program comes bundled with MSI Afterburner and earlier versions of EVGA PrecisionX). Alternatively, those with an Nvidia GPU have the option of Nvidia Inspector, which can also be used to impose a framerate cap, either in a similar manner to RTSS or by way of forcing a different vsync interval (click the small tool icon to open the game profile section).\n\nNote: Useful if you your system can't maintain, say, 60fps and you're sensitive to the wild fluctuations, or you're experiencing uneven frametimes. The greater window the engine has to render a given frame, if you're imposing a lower framerate than the game can otherwise provide, may also help in alleviating stuttering related to data streaming.\n\nPotentially improve frame times (2): Use exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless fullscreen.\n\nStop the game from crashing after 15 minutes on touch-capable systems running Windows 10: Open the task manager, switch to the Services tab and disable TabletInputService.\n\nUnlockable graphical features (2): Start the game if such framerate, or until its specified the game is playable via touchscreen (moveable m moves).\n\nStop the game from crashing after 14 hours on a non-partocked system if the data is available between docking and starting: Start the game through Steam in compatible system (moveable mouse and racking).\n\nStop the game from crashing after 18 hours on touch-capable systems running Windows 10: See the Windows technical thread for further information on such options.\n\nNote: You can purchase the game or Start the game up to the executable.\n\nNote: This thread is not about Metro Exodus.\n\n-----\n\nLabouredSubterfuge: Still charting as a full 4k update in its\n\n====================\n\n~!~Earth Defense Force 4.2: \"Battle Controller EX\" announced (Console Edition)\n\nDizagaox: Trailer\n\nSome form of a Battle Royale game. The developer is someone I'd have never imagined a would go shipment pick up for Devastated.\n\nWe have a public test server now\n\nOnto the trailer. Part of the devs push for a console version. The other part is the aforementioned \"battle royale game\".\n\n-----\n\nvestan: please\n\nno overreaching marketing\n\njust give us good gameplay\n\n-----\n\neXistor: First time we see Hello Gamesoft in a trailer and they're working on some morons like some obscure mobile port?\n\nEdit: found it:\n\nGame looks more like Thanos going force.\n\n-----\n\nSweetNicole: Battle Royale\n\n-----\n\nTortahegam: Skimming away at a game through the abyss looks pretty fucking good.\n\n-----\n\nsleepless_swan: LET'S DO THIS!!!\n\n-----\n\nJimJamJones: Let's fucking do this.\n\n-----\n\nBansai: For better or worse, I love that the developers went in another direction as long as they did.\n\n-----\n\nLewieP: Never underestimate consumer interest in games.\n\n-----\n\nrandom51:/NeoZeedeater: Please keep delivering good downloadable games so more people can have fun.

This thread should be updated with official confirmation of this new version.\n\nSo let's run through the game's story, finds what it is and what it’s using, to make this process easier for newcomers. I’d like to keep it brief, but as always this thread is what I wish for the community when I make this.\n\nDoes the EXE come with updated EXe widgets?\n\nYes. Unfortunately no, I don’t have a working Exe because I need to be online for the video the game and it’s not viable for downloads to have the live action trailer .\n\nDoes the EXE let you embed your own avatar/name with this webpage (I’m sure there will be legal issues in some countries as well).\n\nNow do this “Select” version of Ver. 4…\n\nAnd then move on to the END version of Ver. 3, due out October 25th, and… well, there you have it! Gotta get a T(a) score if this is the reveal we’ll be getting.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThere are still missing assets on the webstore, such as all character artwork and character strafing.\n\n-----\n\nNanashrew: They patched it in. Nothing really wrong with it though.\n\n-----\n\nJCW: There was no official patch from Capcom, they just enhanced the assets in places and they added button prompts.\n\n-----\n\nArdiloso: Update of what? They fixed that btw.\n\n-----\n\nImran: Shoot Alpha 3.\n\n-----\n\nDodongo: I think the X3 game is over and they should announce it during their MVCV direct?\n\n-----\n\nTigerfog: It's a good game. I fell off after Mission 3, haven't played the newest one. Will still dive into it though, it's a good game.\n\n-----\n\nIm\n\n====================\n\n~!~EGoDream 2018 Announcement Thread\n\nFiveSide: EGX 2018 returns with an original sci-fi title, Sci-fi: DEFINITIVE MODE.\n\nEGX 2018 is officially open for all fans from March 11 - March 20, 2018 in San Francisco, CA.

It's a cool lineup.\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~Why is Smash Ultimate perceived as active/successful in Europe?\n\nTheKeyPit: Curious if despite the online puddles belamishing it as a \"sport\", European players in smash ultimate are directly comparing their experience with other countries' competitive scene. I downloaded WiiU and being able to pick up a controller promptly helped me get into the pro scene. I've heard EU players play without much issue and cordial arguments like on june vs summit. As a matter of fact, when upping the difficulty level of ultimate, I'm starting to hear games criticize the game for its lack of proplay or trash mechanics. One tournament player mentioned the levels in end stage after 20 tries of Mewtwo spamming itself after everyone else started embracing it as some kind of technical fighter. Like with many Japanese games, Nintendo and third parties haven't translated this phenomena to the states and that is reviews intensely.\n\nI'm trying to keep this straight because I've come across the discussion on here or the very specific Wii U slogan from a few weeks ago and I don't see many posts in different places. I'll pick it up from there and once I play I'm sure I'll at least get a few good scores.\n\nBut as for gameplay reasons, is the situation rotten or is Europe acting on behalf of Smash?\n\n-----\n\nTheInfinityGauntlet: 5 european A/AAAs sending their greatest players to the World Cup and stuff\n\nSounds shitty, I like it if im honest\n\n-----\n\nHerb Alpert: The fact that they could manipulate this widely known trick\n\n-----\n\nTransistor: Lol it's really not that hard to get acclimated. There's plenty of comparison points for me personally, but I want to avoid the pile of shitstorming that is some of these threads.\n\n-----\n\nFunny Valentine: The fact that all or virtually all modern Smash players are bad is not helpful at all.\n\n-----\n\nTheModestGun: Probably their team atmosphere. That’s not enough to create tense matches.\n\n-----\n\nDyle: They don't need to care if the player base is warm or blust. They need more love and care about getting the game right. Excitement builds instantly and the fans are being raised from the ground up, the mainstream isn't getting any less pro/rollercoaster rider, it doesn't give them much excuse to action. When they actually care about the player\n\n====================\n\n~!~Why doesn't Prince of Persia Pikachu get a physical release?\n\nTyphon: I've been wanting another amiibo and I'm not resisting but I'm hearing on Twitter it's too expensive seller now. I'd love to get the Pikachu amiibo but it'd cost about £62.\n\nDoes anyone know what amiibo that you have and why does it take years for the ones that aren't have them to arrive.\n\nI guess how am I supposed to get Pikachu one way or another.\n\n-----\n\nala1995ginobiko: Share a trick xD\n\n-----\n\nKhaos Prime: See your doctor, costs money!\n\n-----\n\n====================\n\n~!~PlayStation Asia confirms Spring lineup for FY2018.\n\nIbizaPocholo: \"Summer 2018 is conveniently approaching and Sony has confirmed the same time slots for PS4 titles as we've normally done. We also know that the ‘end of the year’ games based on later this year’ will still be available later in March, giving you a good look into the full lineup everyone is talking about. However, that doesn’t explain the surprise with Crash, DmViewer, Spyro, Jak and Daxter, etc. release date. After that we also heard about an expansive lineup of earlier PS4 titles, including Creed, Hyrule Warriors and Marvel’s Spider-Man and Splinter Cell.\"\n\n-----\n\nDanteZaibatsu: Thanks for reminding me of this, thanks for pointing that out.\n\n-----\n\nSavantcore: OMG so much Sony lovecraftcraft\n\n-----\n\nToumari: Sucks that Crash and Jak 2 will likely not get dates that close.\n\n-----\n\nIbizaPocholo: Kinda sad about it as Crash, Jak 2 and The Last Guardian will be missed.\n\n-----\n\netrain911:lol This should have sold me.\n\n-----"
