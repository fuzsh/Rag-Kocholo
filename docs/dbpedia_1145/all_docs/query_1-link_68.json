The movement is really fluid and if you play this for the second time you can go really quick through the stages. The difficulty is average since it has easy boss patterns.

There is a troll maze stage that is a real pain but with a little luck you can beat it. The real difficulty starts when you reach the last boss, if you die there is taking you back to the previous level and that one is not that easy to beat. Luckily i noticed a certain enemy who gave me the necessary health to be able to fight against the last boss and beat him.

About the game: puzzles in almost every room but thankfully you have some potions and you can manage your way through all the rooms to rescue your lovely princess. The credit/continue system is good but sometimes it trolls you taking away pieces of your staff and keys.

I am really happy for the achievement. The game itself is not too hard but since is an RPG you need to solve puzzles and talk to people in towns to know where to go and that takes time. Also finding out what every item does is time consuming as well. When you think you already beat the game, guess what? There is always something else to be done. The Game is a 10/10, the menu system is amazing, the music, gameplay, story, graphics all are at top level for NES in fact this doesn't feel like an NES game.

The music is epic but what is really annoying is that the levels are so long and boring, there is no changes in the levels, all of them is the same \"Bomberman Idea\". From time to time you have boss fights which makes all the journey more enjoyable but the difficulty of the bosses is easy, at least the developer thought that it will be so annoying having to bomb all the way back to make it again to the boss. Definitely not recommended for a first playthrough.RobowarriorFALSCHYYY\n\n2:36:02 to 2:36:28 IGT resume wrong timer, (playthrouigh not affected)\n\n7:20:23 to 7:20:43 IGT skipped frames on TMR end\n\n7:49:36 to 7:49:58 IGT skipped frames on TMR end\n\n34\n\n32Castle of DragondigitalpaletteDefeat Darklarza (stage 8)n/a6June 23, 20143:39:43YesYes7.574.57\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/5Gl1p_fuuGk\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/48697075\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/mlwgogaWcK4\n\nThis game reminds me Dragons Lair, where you get lag and not a good response on the controllers, but despite of those cons the pros are that the music is OK, the level design is not bad, but the enemies logic is really poor. The game is fairly easy to get to the last boss (excluding deadly jumps in two levels). One thing certainly annoying is when you die, you have to go all the way from the beginning again, definitely this game will test your patience.

It follows probably all the baseball rules, it is hard and challenging to play but thankfully has a password system so you can resume exactly where you were. The menu is really friendly as you can access it any time you want to replace your players, change pitcher, etc. also you can manage the way you want the inner garden and the outside garden to behave. Very complete the game but lack of a good music tune, the one in the game isn't as bad but could've been better. At the point when you do a \"homerun\" you can say you've mastered the game. P.S.

Well, I think it was a lucky rage attack guess. This game music is OK, but the rooms in the game are not, and the main problem is switching between the actions inside the rooms, it takes so long. You have to spend a lot of time, punching, hammering, using glasses, and many more actions in every single room to be able to get some items (if any). A compass with the item location would have been great for the game, but still is a playable game.The Goonies IIFALSCHYYY\n\n41\n\n39City Connectionberndlauert8Beat course 6 \"Tokio\" (loops after)n/a5June 30, 20141:07:28NoNo633.510\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/4Ln4h1A8Hmk\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/48572227\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/R3P3sK5Zw-w\n\nAll you need is a car to drive out from the Police, is this GTA?

The game is really difficult to understand but thanks to the \"Manuel\" I knew what was going on. Nothing more punishing than being a foreigner and not knowing the words in English for the items because during the puzzles if you fail guessing your item gets destroyed and you need to travel in time one more time to recover it. There is one thing that i completely loved in the game that was the Arcade mini games to get the items, they were nice and challenging. But in general the game was unforgiving, long, with bad music, lots of no mames and lack of a map (they put a radar with coordinates, but isn't the same).\n\nBack to the Future Part II & III\n\nFALSCHYYY\n\n43\n\n41Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!nickownsyouBeat Mike Tyson (No Tyson password)n/a10July 3, 20149:10:12NoYes1010710\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/umNz_5OUcBs\n\nPart 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/48438779\n\nPart 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/48438831\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/hR8Uj2aZmKE\n\nI personally don't like box but this game makes it so fun an amazing, I love the after punch animations and also the secret technics of the boxers.

The game kept me thinking of which actions do I do in every single dialogue. Trying to be worthy of Avatarhood in every virtue was a good challenge. The first 10 hours were really hard and i loose my soul but after that I started to understand what was going on in the game. Near the end I was missing one item and I wasn't able to continue but with a small hint a got the push I needed to become the true Avatar of Britania Kingdom.

Anyway let's talk about the game: \"CANADIAN FATTIES\" the crowd was yelling, six teams were selected to play against each other but at the end only one team conquered the other 5 you already know which one \"Canadian Fatties\". The game has a really good music, good player change system, good controllers and good speed. Definitely i believe this is the best Hockey game on the NES (still haven't play them all). The fat characters are very OP, but i believe that for experience players a more balanced team should be better than my \"Canadians Fatties\".

I believe they could have done a little bit more RPG quests to get the game more interesting in the RPG area, but even without that is a enjoyable game with awesome music.\n\nGargoyle's Quest II\n\nFALSCHYYY\n\n61\n\n59Final FantasyAmmidDefeat Chaos (Temple of Fiends)8.99.5July 31, 201421:21:30NoNo10889\n\nYouTube Part 1: https://youtu.be/kAhKElQ3YKw\n\nYouTube Part 2: https://youtu.be/DG39x4wPkfo\n\nPart 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47871480\n\nPart 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47871243\n\nReplay Part 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/120417278\n\nReplay Part 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/120476247\n\nReplay Part 3: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/120674197\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/B11k8goz7eM\n\nYouTube Replay Part 1: https://youtu.be/dMfCpJvPq0g\n\nYouTube Replay Part 2: https://youtu.be/IHxb6epYU5g\n\nThe House of MamesWho will tought that making a Final Fantasy will be the beginning of many others. This is the first game of one of the biggest successful game franchises ever made, talking about Final Fantasy is like talking about Super Mario Bros. at least in RPG world. But let's get into the game, the music is probably one of the best NES game music in history, Nabuo Uematsu (Music composser) is a genious. The story is great and in every little quest you complete gets deeper into the adventure of reviving the power of the Orbs. The battle system used in the game isn't as good as the one in Ultima series but isn't that bad either. There is only one big problem in the game, and that is the lack of being able to buy multiple items of the same kind in the shops. But despite of that this game is great, you can even see the overworld map that you can open at will while outside of towns/caves/Palaces and if that is not good enough you even have a secret mini-game inside the ship.Final FantasyFALSCHYYY\n\n4:25:48 to 4:55:50 IGT\n\n4:59:57 to 5:00:02 IGT\n\n62\n\n60The Adventures of Rad GravitySacharunDefeat Kakosn/a7August 2, 201410:20:13YesNo2478\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/GuD8g0yO2Es\n\nPart 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47908361\n\nPart 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47870959\n\nPart 3: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47870887\n\nPart 4: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47870659\n\nPart 5: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47870775\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/tpSQWQYFEeg\n\nI have to say that I am really impressed with the game, it has too many good things and the dificulty is one of those, I love it. Another one is the variety of weapons you are able to use. The third one are the puzzles you need to solve in order to keep going in the game. There is only one really awefull problem with this game and that is not the momentum physics or the hit boxes (Note: they really suck). The main problem with the game is the MUSIC. What a shameful piece of crap. This game would have been a lot more enjoyable just with that simple detail, BETTER MUSIC. I know now is 2014 but I still feel sorry for those who had to listen this game music back in the days when the game was realised.

Also it is very educational and extremely good at the same time.

A lot of people wanted me to play the famous \"Makaimura\" which is the japanesse version of this game, and the main difference is that Makaimura doesn't let you continue so the game becomes nearly unbeatable. Back to the game, I don't like at all the two sound tracks that the game has, they become really annoying. The game concept it is cool but the character control is bad and what to say about the troll \"pseudo ending\"?

The Noid is an advertising character for Domino's Pizza created in the 1980s, meaning a physical manifestation of all the challenges (becoming annoyed—\"a noid\") inherent in getting a pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less. So this game was created as an advertising for Domino's Pizza, but fortunately unlike (Alien 3) this game was a complete success from my point of view. The music is great, the weapons you can get are cool, every stage is so different with new positions for the Noid, there are warp mini-games and more.

It also took me longer to beat than I expected for a sports game. Some of the features suggest this to be a kind of RPG Sport Game, RPG or not I had some fun playing it, but I have to say Tecmo knows better than anyone how to troll you. I tought I had beaten the game and right when I got some tears of joy a whole new tournament started right in front of my eyes breaking my heart. The music is good specially when you have hard matches. The real bad thing is the 32 characters pasword system which includes Symbols, Numbers, Letters (Uppercase/Lowercase) and Arrows.

There is almost nothing I can say in favor of this game ohh yeah i forgot you have passwords that is the only good thing about the game.Deadly TowersFALSCHYYY7:13:27 to 7:14:54 IGT Dropped Frames\n\n90\n\n87Double Dragon III: The Sacred StonesFrenziedpotatoDefeat Princess Noiram (Mission 5: Egypt)10August 27, 20140:27:55NoYes10102.59\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/_NLiPXFiWRk\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/42574038\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/CfbIj4Z6_mA\n\nI loved so much this game when i was a kid but unfortunately never beated it. I was so impresed of how quickly i beat the game despite of loosing Chin and Ranso early in the last stage. The game is great and a classic of NES so fun in two players and gives you the option to play A or B mode which means you can hit each other or not. The last boss is really hard if you don't know the strat but because i play the game recently with my brother we find out that awesome strat that i use to kill the queen. The music is like a symphony that I could listen over and over again.\n\nDouble Dragon III: The Sacred Stones\n\nFALSCHYYY\n\n91\n\n88Cobra TriangleLegopowaFinish Stage 257August 28, 201411:35:55YesYes541010\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/f0zvudZ1_pg\n\nPart 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/42574438\n\nPart 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/42574032\n\nPart 3: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/42574095\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/ud8eceayJxk\n\nEpic Shark Fights (5 Episodes)Well this game was a tough one to beat, RARE definitely knew how to make good-difficult-beatable games more than any other company. I like this game a lot because it has good level designs, increasing the difficulty step by step,but the last boss is really tough, I was loosing my hopes of beating the game but at the end i did it. You only have 2 continues and many times you need to try different stuff to be able to proceed certain sections, including using death strats.Cobra TriangleFALSCHYYY6:12:XX to 6:41:14 on Twitch Vod doesn't load/work\n\n--------------\n\nDoesn't affect final video\n\n92\n\n89Back to the FutureBirubotoGet back to the Future (Stage 20)2August 28, 20141:27:08YesNo13.53.55\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/EN84C_7aQvA\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/42573593\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/9X7zrlanYtk\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/42573593This game gave me a lesson why is important to consult Manuel (Manual), the is that i didn't have a clue I could use the skateboard and what is even worse I couldn't figure out that the things i was hitting they were skateboards. Despite of that i did manage to get the top speed in the delorian car and beated the game. The game is bad in terms of music which is nearly always the same. Also the levels design is awful. Changing to what is good in the game I have to say that I was really impressed with Marty guitar mini-game the make a difference between the \"b\" and the \"#\" like in music. Also the other mini-games are fun to play them.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nFALSCHYYY\n\n93\n\n90ExcitebikeNeustriaBeat each track in Grand Prix (Selection B)4August 28, 20141:55:11NoYes534.510\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/abVQDml2D8w\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/42573539\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/MSw3UoO353c\n\nI never expected to beat this game in 1:55:11, the reason is because i never played through all the tracks before and I had no clue that track 4 and 5 in game B are tough to get at least 3rd place. So since the game doesn't have a real ending I normally play the game until it starts to loop. I really like the starting music of the game and the only one it has, the controllers are good, you can press left in the ramps to go highher and right to go lower, also you need to watch out how you land because you can gain some speed. Until you don't master the controllers there is no way you can beat track 5 even if you are the luckiest person in the world.ExcitebikeFALSCHYYY\n\n94\n\n91StarTropicsXNESticleDefeat Zoda (Chapter 8)10August 30, 20146:04:14YesNo9.5969\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/FD3J38WVep0\n\nPart 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47865950\n\nPart 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47865885\n\nPart 3: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47865409\n\nPart 4: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/47865590\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/qh_hrBIPHB4\n\nFirst i was really esceptic of how good could this game be? the story didn't look promising but later on started to be interesting and all the quest I had to do to rescue the dolphin, give the medicine, getting out of the whale made that i got so into the game. The controlls in the caves and dungeons are weird but the overall game experience made up for that bad controlls design, the main problem is that when you jump it doesn't jump forward unless there is a gap or edge then it jumps forward otherwise jumps in place and that is really annoying. The music is very good and the ending .... well I don't want to spoil it but it is worth playing this game.StarTropicsFALSCHYYY4:49:53 to 4:50:20 Stream Dropped frames, same level but little skipped\n\n4:55:22 to 4:56:26 Stream Dropped frames, same level but little skipped\n\n95\n\n92JawsSiemrngDefeat Jaws4August 31, 20142:12:57YesYes35.54.510\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/hrN7DqrPQwI\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/43396764\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/yDxiv6a6pGM\n\nIf I only knew that is possible to kill a shark just with one lucky stab this game will have been a lot faster, but instead we see the whole game how it supposed to be. Get the radar, level up, buy some strobes and then get Jaws life to zero and stab him. That is the resume of the game, pretty short but hard if you don't know how to kill Jaws. Not bad graphics for being an LJN game and even has an ending screen with good music.JawsFALSCHYYY\n\n96\n\n93Gun.SmokeNiklariousDefeat Wingate (Stage 6)8August 31, 20141:08:58YesYes66310\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/DSTeQy9ze_Q\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/43396961\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/uFc6Q6sewrU\n\nGreat and fun game. The hero even has a pony, i mean a horse. The only concept that didn't fit on the time the story was reffering (18XX's) was the \"Ninjas\" what do a Ninja has to do in the Wild Wild West? Anyway, I like the bullet hell you have to dodge in the last stage because it makes you look in every direction of the screen, thankfully the controllers are user friendly. With some good reflexes you can dodge properly.Gun.SmokeFALSCHYYY\n\n97\n\n94Golgo 13: Top Secret EpisodeSyvarDefeat Smirk (Act 13)5September 1, 20145:58:38YesYes5669\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/iSEhRgwBVDY\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/43396620\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/sTZxSZ4bcH8\n\nI never read the anime, so I really don't have a clue what is the story behind I can only speak for this game. The music is good but later on gets monotonous, the story is quite good but i really didn't like the game that much. It makes me feel like they borrowed some ideas of James Bond movies (Specially the Hotel nights with the ladies). The maze levels are really annoying but thankfully the game Manual has maps, but they still annoying to get through them. Finally the last boss is a troll at the beginning but with a little effort you can beat it.\n\nGolgo 13: Top Secret Episode\n\nFALSCHYYY\n\n98\n\n95Lethal WeaponKillaman100Defeat Giant Guy (Level 3-3)7September 1, 20141:51:08YesYes7.57.53.58\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/Sxnj_BUK81Y\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/43396646\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/oE_foIg7Yeg\n\nThe game doesn't state who made the music but i believe it was Tim Follin. It feels so like him which is always a sinonim of greatness. This is another movies based game and this one is pretty enyoable, the enemies are always the same but with more health in the later levels. The game can be pretty tough to beat since you only have one continue but if you take advantage of Rig's kick attack hit box you can beat the game easily.Lethal WeaponFALSCHYYY\n\n99\n\n96AthenaFenrir_1986Defeat Dante (World of Worlds)3September 3, 201417:08:52YesNo55106\n\nYouTube Part 1: https://youtu.be/QmaKdK20Xoo\n\nYouTube Part 2: https://youtu.be/WD2Oo_CNoiM\n\nPart 1: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/43370421\n\nPart 2: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/43370634\n\nYouTube Part 1: https://youtu.be/DyM-7-zQftU\n\nYouTube Part 2: https://youtu.be/JIa20vJDUvA\n\nThe game is lack of text and boss life meters, with those two things explaining why you cannot hit the enemies and also being able to see how good damage or not this game would have been beatable for first time player and more enjoyable. The mechanics aren't bad neither the graphics but I still feel upset of playing over and over again without knowing how to make damage to the bosses and everything because of a bad game design. That is my opinion of how a game that could be better was destroyed thanks to the programmers (game designers).AthenaFALSCHYYY"
