        "text": "Space Raft (Nintendo Switch Review)\n\nAugust 29, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nSpace Raft\n\nPlatform: Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nReleased August 15, 2024\n\nDesigned by Jordan Davis\n\nPublished by Nami Tentou\n\nPoint of Sale: Nintendo Switch, NES\n\n$9.99 wore a Space Life Preserver in the making of this review.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I’m friends with Safe Raft designer Jordan Davis and programmer Dale Coop. That doesn’t really help either of us in Space Raft’s case. A game that promises, quote, “recognizable people and places from the Milwaukee independent music scene, including DMR alumni!” I know of Milwaukee, but I honestly have no clue how big its music scene is, and so I have no idea how much inside baseball is being played here. I’m sure there’s a lot of gags that are destined to sail over my head and probably the heads of 99% of the world’s population. But, this isn’t a music game. It probably should be. I know I just said that about the Blues Brothers and in retrospect I should have said it when I reviewed the coin-op based on the band Journey. But, for what it’s worth, this is the best “should have been a music game but isn’t” title I’ve done at IGC. Space Raft is part auto-scrolling shooter (in the form of scenes with the band’s SUV) and part maze chase played without fixed movement. And apparently all the chip tunes are by the band. They’re decent enough.\n\nI should point out that if you buy the Nintendo Switch version, you’re getting two very different versions of the game in one. There’s a special arcade cabinet that was created specifically for a legendary arcade, the very famous X-Ray Arcade. I got a giggle because they’re located in a place called Cudahy, Wisconsin. There’s only one other Cudahy in the United States and it’s right here in California as part of the Greater Los Angeles area. The two cities are named after different brothers, too. Small world! Anyway, you get that game too in this package. The games play out quite a bit different, as well. In the NES version, now called “Space Raft Deluxe”, you must collect every chicken sandwich in each stage, and then the game switches genres entirely with a more open-world type of search for missing car keys and roulette tables. The arcade game is only single-screen-at-a-time collecting sessions where you can skip straight to the exit without collecting everything. The catch there is your health is based on the chicken sandwiches you collect and not normal hit points. The NES version has fixed hit points and scrolling through screens. Both games have levels that start with driving segments too, but they’re functionally side-scrolling shmups with the occasional ramp to go off. The bosses of these parts are fine, but overall these go a little too long for my taste and are a bit samey. They’re always scrolling right, too. It’d been neat if each of the driving segments had a different direction you were going. Something to break up the repetitiveness.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe collecting parts are the highlight of the arcade game, sorta. Sigh, this is where it gets frustrating to review a game like this. I think that a lot of the segments are supposed to be wink-wink nods to famous Wisconsin area hangouts and local celebrities, so it’s okay if the gameplay isn’t the greatest. Well, if you’re from Milwaukee, which I’m not, and there’s no references to Giannis Antetokounmpo or the Bronze Fonz, which means this game excludes everything I know about that city. Oh, and Red Letter Media, but they don’t show up either. What is here is a fairly basic arcade scoop-em-up where you have to collect all the items on the target items on the screen. There’s usually one antagonist on the screen who spits fireballs at you as you do this, along with what I think are birds. You can switch between any of the four band members on the fly, and here’s where things do get unique: each of the four members has unique movement speed and a unique weapon. But, I only found two useful. The red one can throw bowling balls the full length of the screen, while the blue one only throws a close-range punch, but his attacks are instakills and he has the most accurate play control. Everyone else moves too loosely for my taste, including the bowling ball guy. The other two guys drop bombs and spit fire that I found ineffective, at least at first.\n\nThe movement can be so touchy that there were multiple times where I walked into the stage exit when I didn’t intend to. The arcade game is short and fine for what it is. It’s not amazing. It’s okay. It’s rough, though. None of the movement is “fixed” and it’s inevitable you’ll get hung-up when attempting to turn corners or walk through gaps that are a single character length. Even the computer AI seems to have problems with it for the enemies. None of the baddies had anything resembling patterns that I could make out. This feels a lot like a prototype that has placeholder algorithms for most NPC movement. I couldn’t decide if my #1 “want” for this game was more elegant enemy attack patterns or better movement parameters, which is probably not the best sign, since those two things are really important to games like this. I’ll settle on “I wish movement was better.” Actually, I kind of wish this moved more like something like, say, The Adventures of Lolo where you move a half-space at a time. But, for all of its faults, I had fun with this. If we’re splitting the two games included apart, I’d give the coin-op a very mild YES! because it’s not boring and I feel there’s just enough intense chase moments to make this worth a play.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nInitially, I liked the coin-op more. I even quit the NES game a little too early to skip over to it, and I’m happy I did. If you end up picking up Space Raft, play the arcade game first, then play the main Space Raft Deluxe game (technically they’re both NES games, but that’s neither here nor there). When I returned to the Deluxe, something I didn’t expect happened: I liked it a lot more now. All the problems of the coin-op are here. The movement sucks, and the enemies can be kind of nonsensical in their behavior. It’s also still “inside baseball” but at least in Space Raft Deluxe, Bernie Sanders and the Green Bay Packers show up, so I’m not completely staring at the screen blankly thinking “I have no idea what’s happening.” But, it’s also clearly the better game. I think the only area where the arcade game is superior is in the driving parts, which are my least favorite sections anyway. Deluxe lives up to the name. The level design is better. The bosses are better. It also does a lot more to change-up the formula. Some rooms might not have you collecting anything at all and instead just clearing a path to the next screen. Hell, the genre itself changes in the third world for two levels and feels more like Legend of Zelda dungeons. Best of all, this more expanded Space Raft made me nostalgic for the type of smaller, more heartfelt personal game that is weird and means more to the developer than it ever could to the player.\n\nSpace Raft isn’t a fantastic game by any stretch. The movement is frustrating and the enemies feel like they just sort of wander aimlessly. Plus, all the inside jokes were overwhelming for me. Have you ever been to a party where there’s a group of people listening to someone tell a story, and they’re clearly hanging on the person’s every word, but you missed most of it. Then, when everyone laughs at the resolution, you feel awkward but laugh anyway? Yea, that’s where I’m at with Space Raft. I feel like these jokes and references might kill with the right crowd, while I’m just nodding along and feigning a smile. But hell, I used to play games like this ALL THE TIME in my first few years of Indie Gamer Chick. This is exactly the type of personal experience I want to see translated more to games. It’s a quirky game created for the amusement of a small group of people that the developer had the guts to put out for the masses, even if they won’t understand most of the bits. I just wish I felt more invited into this world. Maybe this is the best you can do with 8-bits. A lot of the gags in the game feel like they’d make for a better sitcom than a video game. Something for these guys to think about.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAs a trip down memory lane from the developer’s point of view, I’m not sure it hit the right notes to leave me charmed. All I have is the gameplay stuff, and it’s fine. I can’t say it makes for a convincing NES game because it has swearing and battles against sentient dog sh*t. I always prefer when developers follow the restrictions studios had in the 80s and 90s and see how close they can come to crossing the line without actually crossing it. But the level design is decent enough and there’s an effort to change up the set pieces and create a sense of adventure. The emulation package is decent, too. No rewind, but it’s not exactly the world’s hardest game. Save states are here, along with concept art and the original NES instruction book and box art. Nice.\n\nIf I have one last gripe, it’s that they didn’t quite stick the landing on ending the game, as the worst driving sequence in Space Raft is actually the grand finale. They should have recognized the Zelda-like sequences were their bread & butter and finished on one of those. There’s a LOT of room for improvement, but as a 2019/2020 first game from the guys involved, guys who are getting a LOT better at making games, I’ve played a lot worse. Most importantly, what’s here is a little more fun than it is frustrating, and fun is all I’ve ever cared about. But, realistically, this should be a game that’s made as a limited-quantity physical release that’s sold in Wisconsin gift shops. I don’t even mean that as a negative, either. I think it’s wonderful that an indie game can celebrate local culture. Seriously, if *I* were to make a game, I’d probably be something like this, only it’d be about Emperor Norton and you’d only be able to find it in mom & pop shops in the Bay Area. Put that game on the eShop and people would be like “who the f*ck is Emperor Norton and what the f*ck is Original Joe’s?” It’s inside baseball.\n\nVerdict: YES!\n\nThe Blues Brothers (NES Review)\n\nAugust 27, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nThe Blues Brothers\n\nPlatform: Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nReleased September, 1992\n\nDeveloped by Titus\n\nNEVER BEEN RE-RELEASED\n\nI go through extended periods of melancholy. If my rate of game reviews slows down, that’s probably a sign that I’m currently having an extended case of the blues. I try to avoid reviewing games when that’s happening because it’s just plain not fair to the games. The bitch of it is, it’s never clear when it’s over. It’s the most quiet recovery phase imaginable, and it’s so frustrating. You can imagine how tough it is to play a bad game when this is happening because it’s never clear if it’s ME or the game. Thankfully, Blues Brothers on the NES is so bad that I don’t have to guess. I used my emulator to select a random game and it gave me Blues Brothers, making me believe the universe really is a simulator and the person playing the Cathy game is trolling me in the same way I did when I fenced in people while playing the Sims. It took about a minute of playtime with Blues Brothers before I said “even my emulator hates me.” Blues Brothers is absolutely abysmal. A series of cheap shots, GOTCHAs, unavoidable damage moments, last pixel jumps, and terrible level design.\n\nThe problem is Blues Brothers wants to have sprawling, labyrinthine level design, but it doesn’t quite understand how to go about doing that. There’s so many sloppily-executed jumping puzzles that make no sense, with no semblance of elegance to their design. There’s far too many moments where it’s not even clear what direction you’re supposed to be going. In place of cleverness, Blues Brothers keeps going to the same handful of unimaginative tricks. There’s too many blind jumps, which is probably my least favorite type of bad design. Blues Brothers relies so heavily on blind jumps that eventually I don’t think you could consider the jumps blind anymore. I was able to anticipate when they were coming. Not so much with the other trope: last pixel jumps. It’s not unusual for both types of crap jumping segments to be combined: last pixel blind jumps. Oh, and don’t forget that they often end those necessary blind jumps with enemies placed at the end that you can’t see coming and that you can’t really avoid. Often, it’s possible those blind jumps, when missed, could result in you falling back to the beginning of the level and having to start all over. Thank god for save states and rewind. I’d never had the patience to finish this otherwise.\n\nAnd it’s kind of glitchy, too. There’s a few animals you can “ride” but they don’t really do anything when it happens and just as often just immediately die and fall off screen. Sometimes the enemies seem like they get caught on a pixel and wiggle back and forth in place. None of the enemies feel specifically themed to the IP, though. The levels I think try to be as there’s a jailbreak scene, but they look so drab and plain. It’s not exactly an ugly game, but it often feels like this could have been anything. Oh, and moving platforms aren’t synced right, but this does contribute to the one semi-clever bit in the entire game. There’s a moment in the final level where there’s multiple moving platforms that all intersect with each-other, and you have to figure out which is the right one. Okay, that was cool, but the moment passes quickly and then it’s back to the same blind jumps and last pixel jumps. You have to use B-run/B-jumping, but you move too fast and the controls are too loose for a game that demands this much accuracy. Having the game end with moving platforms surrounded by spikes before the non-ending ending was the final slap in the face. This is one of the worst games I’ve ever reviewed.\n\nI don’t have much more to say about Blues Brothers as a game. They weren’t even trying to be fun. They were being sadistic just for sadism’s sake. Five terrible levels of lifeless, boring blind/last pixel jumps, with pretty much nothing else. You can’t defeat enemies. There’s no trinkets to find. Just find the unmarked exit to the level and that’s it. It’s really lazy, actually. There’s no bosses, either. Levels and the game itself just end anticlimactically. I have nothing positive to say here. It doesn’t even really work as a Blues Brothers game. It feels like a completely generic template that an out of touch producer got the license for. “Guys, you won’t believe this, but we finally outbid Konami, Capcom, Nintendo, Sega, everyone, for a hot ticket license that kids will love!” “What is it? Disney? Nickelodeon? Disnelodeon?” “Blues Brothers!” “As in.. Blues Brothers? The Saturday Night Live sketch starring a guy who died before most NES owners were even born?” “Did I say kids will love it? Sorry, my dentures got caught in my throat. I mean their parents will recognize it as a thing they enjoyed when they were stoned on Saturday nights in college and buy it for their kids, because kids always love the outdated pop culture their parents enjoyed in their youth.” See also 20th Century Fox’s Atari 2600 output. That mentality lived well into the NES era.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMy question is why would you get this license only to do a lazy platform game? If you’re going to make a game based on a comedy music act, shouldn’t that game be, you know, musical and funny? Why would you just make sprites based on the characters? Besides music notes restoring your health, there’s no music theme to this, nor are there any sight or sound gags. None at all. Maybe the bad design was meant to be ironically funny. Nah, that’s far too clever for this. I’m not going to say “this license deserved better” because I don’t know it all too well. I only recently saw the 1980 film for the first time, and I’ve never been able to make myself watch Saturday Night Live from before I was born. I feel like most of the sketches are “you had to be there” in nature. My experience was limited entirely to the sequel, which I saw once, when I was 8 years old. I was bored with Blues Brothers then. I was bored with it now. But, if you’re going to make a Blues Brothers game, I would think the first two steps were “be musical” and “be funny.” This is just generic template 385-B, with sprites made to look like John Belushi, who I imagine is spinning in his grave, though that could be residual from the speedball that killed him. So much for being out of my melancholy phase, but with a game this bad, how the hell can I tell?\n\nVerdict: NO!\n\nStreets of Rage 1 & 2 – Sometimes It’s Just Hard to Review Video Games\n\nAugust 15, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nI intended for this to be a Definitive Review on the Streets of Rage series, but I pulled the plug after playing six games when I intended to review nine total (with Comix Zone and a Streets of Rage mod thrown in). I’m just here to have fun and find neat things about games to talk about. But, I also accept that not every game is worth reviewing because I might not have anything particularly interesting to say about it. This can apply to good games and bad games. Perhaps it was an ominous sign that the original Streets of Rage wasn’t included in any global version of Sega Genesis mini or its sequel mini-console, but that’s not a sign I got. After I played it on my computer, I dusted-off my mini-console and grabbed my nephew to play co-op with me. And then I was stunned and confused when it wasn’t on the Genesis Mini. Wait, there’s no way they left Streets of Rage off the lineup.. right? Yep, they did. The first one at least. Streets of Rage 2 is in the first Mini while Streets of Rage 3 is the Genesis Mini 2. The first game, which launched what is one of the most recognizable classic Sega franchises, didn’t make the cut. Now granted, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 isn’t in either mini, and Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker didn’t make it in for licensing reasons. But, really? No Streets of Rage 1? And then I played it, and I was just very, very bored. Including only Streets of Rage 2 in the first mini was probably a wise choice. It is the good one.\n\nI don’t have a lot to say about the first Streets of Rage. There’s just not a lot to it, you know? There’s three characters, each with a limited move set, traversing mostly bare-bones levels while mostly fighting the same handful of enemies in unmemorable settings. During levels, I counted a total of three extracurricular elements in the entire game: a brief series of gaps that you can throw or knock enemies into, a half-elevator that you can maybe throw your enemies off of but it’s hard to do without them simply hitting the rail, and a stage with hydraulic presses. All the stages are straight lines, too, unless an elevator is involved, and that’s functionally just a static room, right? I’d say the best part is that you can grab enemies from the front, flip over them, and suplex them, but all the characters have that move. This might have been better when it first came out, but today, in 2024, Streets of Rage feels like little more than a proof of concept for Streets of Rage 2. Solid violence, but done in the most boring and basic of ways. Really, that’s my review in its entirety. It’s just a nothing game. And one that I wasn’t done with yet, because I had two mediocre 8-bit ports of an already mediocre game to go, not to mention two sequels and the two 8-bit ports of the first sequel.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOf the six games I played, ONE was pretty dang good: Streets of Rage 2 for the Sega Genesis. Universally held-up as an all-timer, and it deserves it. Four characters instead of three, with a much larger variety of moves, and the ridiculous bomb is replaced by two health-draining special moves (one done while standing still and the other done by moving). By the way, Streets of Rage’s bomb is the most flow-killing bomb I’ve seen in a game. When you activate it, you summon a cop who drives a police car a distance behind you, who then steps out of the car and fires a rocket launcher from a distance to blow up the screen. Funny the first time because it’s just so corny, but less funny with each subsequent usage because it just stops an already sloggy game dead in its tracks. The smartest thing Sega did with the sequel was kick it to the curb, and with all the additional characters and moves (plus the fact that I could play it co-op on the TV with my nephew), I had fun with Streets of Rage 2.\n\nBut, the second Streets of Rage still suffers from being really generic. Don’t take it personally, Sega fans. I feel the same way about Violent Storm and Final Fight. All these games are kind of samey with enemies and set pieces that feel interchangeable. Streets of Rage is more famous for its soundtrack than its gameplay, and yea, the soundtrack is good. But, I don’t find the characters particularly memorable. I think if you gave a controller to someone who couldn’t see the title screens and had them play the Streets of Rage games, the Final Fight games, and Violent Storm, they could very well believe they’re all from the same series. My brain is already mixing them up, and I literally just played through six variations of two Streets of Rage games. I don’t think I could name every boss fight. Hell, the one character in the whole Streets of Rage series that stood out the most was a boss that literally looks exactly like the famous professional wrestler the Ultimate Warrior, face paint, tights, and all. I almost said “that’s really random and unexpected” but then I remembered that Final Fight had an Andre the Giant lookalike and Violent Storm had characters with face paint and spiked shoulder pads that looked exactly like the Road Warriors (aka The Legion of Doom). It feels almost like a running gag, except for the fact that none of these games are produced by the same company, and it ultimately just further serves to make all these games kind of blend together. The cities look the same. The bosses behave similarly. The destructible objects, weapons, and health refills are similar, if not the same.\n\nNow, I like brawlers. When you absolutely NEED a cathartic game, nothing tops a side-scrolling beat-em-up, and they’re normally the easiest games to review, too. Is the violence good? Is there a decent variety of moves and/or weapons? Are the set pieces fun? Does the AI cheap shot you too much? The problem with Streets of Rage 2 is that it feels too close to other games, without any truly memorable characters or set pieces to make-up for it. That goes for both the first games in the series. Much like with the bosses, I can’t recall half the levels and I just played SIX of these games. I found settings to be really dull and forgettable. The only one that stood out was one from Streets of Rage 2 that had the strangest parallax scrolling I’ve seen, to the point that it made my sister and at least one reader of mine get a tiny bit of motion sickness. For what it’s worth, I’m not penalizing these games for being similar to Final Fight or Violent Storm. It’s the nature of the genre, and hey, I’m giving a very easy YES! to Streets of Rage 2 on the Genesis. I don’t think a game needs to be memorable to be recommendable. But, it does need stand-out moments to make for a compelling retro game review.\n\nI tried to make this review work with funny anecdotes, like how I died more times from timing out in the Master System version of Streets of Rage than I did all other deaths I suffered from the Game Gear and Genesis versions combined. But after a few days of trying to write a normal review, I threw in the towel. Partially because myself and my entire family are really sick right now (as bad as I feel, I’m heartbroken for the kids, since this ruined their last two weeks of summer vacation) and I just want to sleep until I feel better, but mostly because I attempted to write multiple reviews and it became like a broken record. The four 8-bit Streets of Rage games all suffer from the same problem most bad Master System/Game Gear games have: trying to copy the 16-bit Genesis gameplay on 8-bit platforms. That mindset will always result in a lesser game, and I can’t stretch that critique into four different reviews. Back in my XBLIG days, for every game I reviewed, there were five more than I bought, played through to the end, and never wrote-up a review. I’m even worse with retro games. It’s why I have half-finished reviews for games like the Asterix coin-op, Virtual Boy’s Galactic Pinball, and Flintstones on the Sega Genesis. Sometimes a game being good or bad doesn’t matter at all because the words simply do not come to me. I shrug and move on.\n\nI’d promised Streets of Rage for the Genesis’ 35th birthday, when I really should have just shrugged and moved on. Maybe someday Streets of Rage 3 will provide me with plenty to talk about (I might eventually do every Genesis Mini game), but after six games, only one of which I had fun with, I’m too burned out on Streets of Rage to play another. Even Streets of Rage 2 isn’t so interesting that I could do a typical review. Don’t mistake that for me saying it’s bad or overrated, because Streets of Rage 2 is actually really good, with my only major complaint being “the flying guy isn’t fun to fight. He’s just very annoying because he’s hard to line-up with.” At least I still had fun with it, because it’s one of the most polished and enjoyable 90s brawlers. Well, at least until the final boss fight with Mr. X on account of being a repeat of the first game. Hey, wasn’t Mr. X also the name of the final boss in Kung-Fu Master? GODDAMMIT, see what I mean? They’re all the same*.\n\nYES! to Streets or Rage 2 for the Sega Genesis\n\nNO! to Streets of Rage on Genesis\n\nNO! to Streets of Rage on the Sega Master System\n\nNO! to Streets of Rage on the Game Gear\n\nNO! to Streets of Rage 2 on the Game Gear\n\nNO! to Streets of Rage 2 on the Sega Master System\n\n*They’re not.\n\nThe Ninja (Sega Master System Review)\n\nAugust 9, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nThe Ninja\n\nPlatform: Sega Master System\n\nReleased November 8, 1986\n\nDeveloped by Sega\n\nNEVER BEEN RE-RELEASED\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Ninja is one of the most generic titles a game could possibly have. It didn’t have to be that way. Based on the coin-op Sega Ninja, which was known in Japan as Ninja Princess, this port swaps a female protagonist for a male one, presumably because in the 80s, game consoles were primarily sold in toy stores and toy stores had distinct sections for boys and girls products. Even though video games should have logically been as gender-neutral as board games, manufacturers had no choice but to choose whether they wanted whatever it was you were selling to be mostly seen by boys or girls. Even when games got their own aisles, the marketing was always based around appealing to boys. In my own experience, I know that when I went to a place like Toys ‘R Us, the video games were always on one far end of the store, directly across from the board games, with action figures and “boys’ toys” on the next aisle, then there would usually be multiple aisles of buffer before you got to “girls’ toys” like Barbies or dolls. It is what it is, but in the case of The Ninja, retaining the female character sprite might have been the type of thing to stand out in an otherwise crowded field of ninja-based games. Mind you, this is before the TMNT craze.\n\nThe Ninja is one of those games in the mold of Commando or Ikari Warriors, and in fact, the coin-op came out before either of those games. Just replace bullets with unlimited throwing knives and the lone power-up, unlimited shurikens and you’ll get the idea. It’s a very basic game for the most part. Just waves of enemies that act as cannon fodder. You have a relatively big character sprite for a relatively cramped playfield, making dodging enemy projectiles somewhat tricky. Thankfully, unlike Commando or Ikari Warrior, you have a very effective dodge move. By pressing buttons 1 & 2 at the same time, you vanish in a puff of smoke for a second or two. The offensive game is as savvy as the defensive one. Non twin-stick shooters struggle with aiming because you have to walk in the direction you’re facing, but The Ninja gives you a second option: button 2 always shoots upwards. That was smart, especially since most of the stages are strictly vertical scrolling. Since enemies don’t respawn, there’s no time limit, and you can scroll backwards, the logical strategy is to retreat downward while firing upward until you have a clear path to move on. This even works on bosses, none of whom are spongy. So, all is well and good, right? I got to the final level, beat the final boss, and had a decent if unspectacular time.\n\nOh.\n\nYea, The Ninja is one of those games that gates you from the true finale unless you collect all the hidden macguffins. In the case of The Ninja, it’s five green scrolls hidden in semi-abstract locations among the first nine levels of the game. In my first playthrough, I only found one, which is the first. It’s all but automatic, at least assuming you kill every enemy, and what’s the point of playing this style of game if you don’t want to kill all the enemies? The others are a little more tricky, but after I looked up how to find the second, I did manage to find the other three without the use of a guide. Once I got into the mindset of the logic of where the scrolls would be hidden, it wasn’t THAT hard to logic it out. Only the final scroll was a little bit more tricky and I wasn’t even entirely sure how I activated it until I looked it up in the guide and realized I didn’t really do anything except move into the right spot, which was the case with a couple other scrolls. The fifth scroll uniquely ends the stage immediately, without having to defeat the boss. The five scrolls provide you with the more complex instructions for how to locate and activate the passage to the true final stage of the game, instructions that would have otherwise been so specific that nobody could possibly do it by accident. All credit to Sega for this one. Usually, I hate it when games hide stuff arbitrarily (see my review of Vs. The Goonies) but it works here because it’s never THAT complicated and it actually was satisfying to find them.\n\nThe Ninja isn’t spectacular or anything, but the combat is decent enough. I wish there was a bigger variety of weapons or power-ups. The only upgrades are one-at-a-time blue scrolls that speed you up and the red scroll, which turns your throwing knives into shurikens, which cut through all enemies instead of stopping at just the one you hit. All enemies AND YOU are one-hit kills, except for bosses, so a well-thrown shuriken is damn satisfying. There’s only two types of bosses (though their attack might change), but the strategy is the same: scratch-out a distance, then turn and shoot. While the game’s lack of fun stage themes is quite disappointing, with graphics and landscapes that are as bland as tofu, The Ninja is actually a decent overall game.\n\nIt even utilizes three auto-scrolling set-pieces that work well. One has you dodging boulders, the next horses, and finally there’s one that’s basically Frogger with ninjas. Even with the changes of pace, and even though I was forced to replay and find the hidden scrolls, The Ninja is a short game. If you know the locations of the scrolls, it should take you a half-hour to finish, if that. But as someone who has never cared much for Commando or Ikari Warriors, yea, this is pretty dang okay. It’s okay for a game to be just “okay.” If not for the okay games, being great would be meaningless, right? Besides, after three straight NO!s for Sega Master System August, a game finally getting a YES! put a smile on my face. My only question is “if they had kept the Ninja Princess name, would this game be remembered more than it is now, which is barely at all?” I don’t know the answer to that. I know they needed to come up with something better than “THE NINJA.” It’s so uninspired. A generic name for a generic game, but hey, sometimes the generic items are better than the name brand.\n\nVerdict: YES!\n\nBill, you will be missed. RIP my friend.\n\nNinja Gaiden (Sega Master System Review)\n\nAugust 7, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nNinja Gaiden\n\nPlatform: Sega Master System\n\nReleased July, 1992\n\nDirected by Kouji Inokuchi and Kanako Koyama\n\nDeveloped by SIMS\n\nPublished by Sega\n\nOnly Released in Europe\n\nNEVER BEEN RE-RELEASED\n\nOkay, so my plans for a Sega Master System themed month sort of blew up in my face. SMS fans, like nearly every classic gaming community, are f’n awesome and I wanted to reward them with a month dedicated to their platform since, for whatever reason, Sega ignores the SMS outside of endless Sonic collections. The problem is my choices of games have not been on point. After I gave the first two games, Asterix and Master of Darkness, a NO!, I was determined to find a YES! game. Ninja Gaiden on the Master System is one of the most critically acclaimed games on the platform, so I ignored the little voice in my head that said “yea? Didn’t critics say that Chariots of Fire was a better movie than Raiders of the Lost Ark?” and fired it up. It doesn’t really play all that much like the NES game that I recently reviewed a ROM hack of, Deadpool. It controls much better, for one thing, and it has a proper wall jump. A pretty good wall jump, too. One of the better 8-bit versions of that maneuver. The sword is slightly better. There’s also an absurd glitch that allows you to have unlimited sub-weapon points. Once you reach the max 999 sub-weapon points, it never again takes a point from you. It makes it much easier to fight the pregnant skeletons. Yes, you read that right: pregnant skeletons. This game is weird, yo.\n\nThere’s no doubt about it: Ninja Gaiden on the Master System is superior to the NES game. And it’s still not good, because by the halfway point of the game, its designers gave up on creating fun levels and thrilling platforming sequences and instead lowered themselves to the level of the world’s most unimaginative 12 year old playing Mario Maker. The first three or four levels are really good, and while they’re not devoid of cheap moments, there’s plenty of solid action and well-placed enemies. Then Ninja Gaiden completely changes its tone and instead becomes one GOTCHA after another designed to use the knock-back to one shot the player. Any idiot can design their platform game as a series of digital mousetraps. It takes no talent at all because all you have to do is create one specific path the player MUST traverse, then put the lethal element along that path in a way that nobody can possibly anticipate or react to fast enough the first go around. Something you have to already know is there and be in the process of defending against as you make your move towards the part of the screen that has it. Literal trial and error based around memorizing the timing on each element. When you think about it, doesn’t that type of design make your game, regardless of the genre or theme, nothing more than a fancy version of Simon?\n\nWhat started as a fun game becomes pretty terrible by the end. Very limited creativity. No finesse. Just one gotcha after another. Like, it does the rising/lowering lava trope, which became a clichéd gaming staple for a reason: it always works. Well, unless you lull players into thinking the timing is consistent, and then GOTCHA, THE TIMING JUST CHANGED! Ninja Gaiden pulls that trick a few times in its lava section. There’s even a point where I’m pretty sure it’s not even a true rising/lowering timing challenge and instead it’s a last-pixel jump, because the lava will always rise and knock you back into a pit unless you leap off the edge of one platform and land on another. The one annoying platforming trope Ninja Gaiden hadn’t used up to this point was last-pixel jumps. On one hand, hey, at least it’s an original GOTCHA that plays on player’s expectations, but it’s still a GOTCHA and I’ve never enjoyed that type of game design, even with perks like rewinding and save states to ease the pain.\n\nI should also note that the combat was no longer fun by this point, either. My immersion was already broken by having birds be significantly more threatening than the ninjas themselves, but it gets worse. There’s these sentient fireballs that chase you, and their attack pattern is simply to heat-seek you and stay on top of your sprite. Sure, they can be killed, but they always come in threes, and eventually in fours from multiple directions. When one inevitably gets through, it will knock you back, and while you’re blinking it’s already back on top of you and ready to hit you a second time. These enemies are always by pits, too. They’re not designed or placed to drain your health. They’re there to kill you via a knock-back into a pit. Okay, so kill them before they get to you, right? Yea, did I mention they take two hits to kill and enemies get almost as much blinking as you do? There’s no way you can kill all three or four because they move fast and have too much invulnerability after the first hit. To put it in perspective: I had a sub-weapon that shot four heat-seeking bullets out at once, and even with this AND anticipating they would appear, at least one, and usually multiple, will have enough time to reach me.\n\nFor whatever reason, Tecmo was especially bad about difficulty scaling during this era. I like Solomon’s Key, or at least the core gameplay concept, but it becomes ridiculous by the end. Rygar on the NES seems like a great adventure game, but it heavily relies on cheap shots too. No studio from this era that made more fun engines and concepts only to then wreck the overall experience by upping the difficulty to ruinous levels as much as Tecmo. I can’t help but wonder if they fell prey to the same thing that plagues a lot of indie developers. There’s this phenomenon where devs play-testing their games forget that they’re the best player in the entire world at their own game because, you know, nobody else has played it. So they keep upping the difficulty because they know what to do, forgetting that they’re creating a product for people who don’t know and haven’t invested their entire lives into its creation and thus know every tiny idiosyncrasy. I don’t know for sure that’s what happened at Tecmo, but clearly something was wrong with their play testing because, outside of their sports games, I don’t think I’ve played an 8-bit Tecmo game scaled right. They always end up more maddening than fun.\n\nGoing back to the Simon comparison, some people like Simon. I’m guessing the people who enjoy it are the people who like games where the words “trial and error” dominate the discussion as much as they do. I don’t like Simon at all. I think it’s boring, and I think games that devolve into pure trial and error are boring. Where it’s very unlikely you can reasonably be expected to overcome challenges on your first attempt. That’s just not fun to me. It stops being frustrating after a while and just becomes busy work. I could see how someone in 1991 who is starved for content on the Master System could shower Ninja Gaiden with praise. It’s one of the most celebrated European-exclusives on the console, and for the first few levels, it lives up to that. But it doesn’t last. Had it stayed the course with a game that was focused on platforming acrobatics and using enemies as something you think about and react to rather than just booby traps, I think Ninja Gaiden had a chance at being one of the best retro platforms I’ve reviewed. Instead, it’s just another game where I read the contemporary reviews and ask “did they even play past the first stage?”\n\nVerdict: NO!\n\nAstérix (Sega Master System Review)\n\nAugust 1, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nAstérix\n\nPlatform: Sega Master System\n\nReleased in 1991\n\nDirected by Tomozō Endō\n\nDeveloped by Sega\n\nNever Released in United States\n\nNEVER BEEN RE-RELEASED\n\nI wanted to kick off a month focused on the Sega Master System with a game I thought had a pretty good chance of getting a YES! and Astérix seemed like a good choice. It came largely from the team that did the 8-bit version of Castle of Illusion. It even seems to have a similar engine. Well, it would seem my aim was a little off, because Astérix is all kinds of sloppy. Now, I’m not all that familiar with the Astérix media franchise, except that I know it’s been around for over six decades and it’s the second most-sold comic series after One Piece. Actually, the category it’s #2 in is “collected volumes” as it would drop to #4 if you factored-in “periodical single-issue floppy sales” which is what we call “comic books” in the US, with Superman and Batman moving ahead of it. But hey, that’s still a little ahead of Spider-Man! Of course, if you count comic magazines like Weekly Shōnen Jump, Astérix doesn’t even crack the top 15. My point is, it’s a very big deal. Naturally, there’s several video games based on Astérix, one of which I already reviewed in Atari 50: The Games They Couldn’t Include – Part Two. Most of them never saw a US release. This is one of them, and I imagine this would have been a solid game at the time of its release. It’s not so solid anymore.\n\nAstérix features twenty stages spread unevenly over eight game worlds, the first level of which you have to play once with each character. After level 1-1, you can choose between playing as the smaller Asterix or the lumbering Obélix in each stage, which factors into that stage’s pathway to the goal. Astérix can’t break blocks just by punching them, headbutting them or butt-stomping them. Obélix can do all the above, but he’s bigger, slower, and some of the platforming is more dangerous for him. Astérix needs to use explosive potions to take out blocks. You can both drop them on what you’re standing on by pressing down and the button, or you can toss them by holding up. You can even do a running toss for extra distance. The problem is the potions don’t offer much of a splash, and that can be a problem when you build the whole game around this mechanic. At about the halfway point, the game requires you throw the bombs on moving platforms that collapse into bottomless pits the moment YOU step on them. It repeats this shtick for the rest of the game, and the lack of splash just hurts this concept so much. Since I never really came close to timing-out, it just felt like busy work. When this is incorporated into auto-scrolling stages, which Astérix utilizes a few times too many, well, it’s kind of a disaster.\n\nThe bombs are almost useless as offensive tools against enemies too, which isn’t so big a deal most of the time. You can punch enemies and Astérix’s downward thrusting punch has a DuckTales-like pogo stick spring to it, at least when you hit an enemy. Meanwhile, Obélix’s downward thrust, a butt-stomp, crashes through every block. But again, auto-scrolling rears its ugly head. For whatever reason, they also thought it would be great to include moving platforms with the auto-scrolling, without any synchronization. Are you kidding me? It forces players to hug the right wall, because you often only get one brief chance at making the right moves, and it differs between Astérix and Obélix. In the case of Obélix, his butt-stomp breaks ALL blocks under him. So, the auto-scrolling gives you a moving platform and a stack of blocks. If you don’t break the blocks before the moving platform hits them, it’ll change directions and you’ll die via lethal scrolling. Sounds like a fine, fair challenge, except the collision is really fickle.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nNot that it matters much. Extra lives are plentiful, and the enemies don’t pose much of a threat. I never once was killed from running out of health. It was always death by auto-scrolling or falling into a bottomless pit. Games like that need fun exploration and peppy platforming, but Astérix is really slow. You get bottles of what I assume is mud at some point, which creates platforms in the lava. Hey, that sounds awesome. But the way they did it is the least fun, least exciting way of doing it. You throw the bottle and it makes the BANG and splashes. THEN, you watch the chemicals rise to the surface, THEN FINALLY you have a platform you can stand on for a couple seconds before it blinks away. Presumably this was done to give the game a more cartoonish, comical vibe. In practice, it just turns the item and its usage into a slog. There’s water-based platforming that’s the same way, only you throw a rock, which causes a water spout that you can briefly stand on. I’m totally fine with slowing down the pace of a platformer if it stays exciting. Land of Illusion isn’t exactly fast-paced, but it sure is a fantastic game. Astérix is really just very boring.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAnd then the sloppiness kicks-in. There is something mechanically wrong with how they mapped the scrolling with Obélix. When you reach the end of a screen and have to exit vertically, you only have a fraction of a fraction of second before the game decides you’re going back down and changes back to the previous screen. It’s TERRIBLE. The worst switch-over to the next screen I’ve ever seen in platforming. Like in this screen:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI could not get out of the water because the game instantly decided I was trying to go back down and kept swapping me back to the previous screen immediately. Even mashing the button didn’t work. I actually had to use autofire to be able to get out of the water. Absolutely terrible, and it’s so much worse because Obélix is a LOT more fun to play as than the weaker, more generic-feeling Astérix. Obélix at least feels like a fresh take on platforming. It’s rare to use bigger, oafish type heroes in this genre, and in the case of Obélix, it doesn’t feel like a facade. He does feel like a different kind of platforming hero, in a good way. But, the problem with the scrolling happens with or without swimming every time you have to move immediately after the transition, and it kind of ruins the whole experience. The game has this great idea where you can punch a spring to move it over. Not only is this underutilized, but when you use Obélix, the screen swaps back to the previous screen before you even begin to fall downward. Did anyone play test this at all?\n\nWhat little set pieces the game attempts are just not fun enough to make up for the really bad mechanics and mediocre level design. The object of the game is to find the keys that open the door in each stage. But they didn’t even bother with hiding the key in 80% of the levels. The pot that has the key that unlocks the door is usually just right next to the door. It took so long for the game to actually put the key away from the pathway you would take that I wondered why they even included this idea to begin with. There’s really only one level that I had to go looking for the key. One out of twenty. The game also stopped bothering to feature bosses after a while. The first couple levels have them, then the concept just vanishes. Apparently they took the fun with them.\n\nI really did want to start Sega Master System August with a bang, and based on the pedigree, I thought this would be the best bet for that. Even though I know very little about Astérix as a property, I get the impression that the team that made this game weren’t fans themselves. There’s only tiny hints of comical violence and fisticuffs. When you punch an enemy hiding in a tree stump, everything flies off the enemy in layers, like a cartoon. That’s nice, I guess, but that’s as far as the humorous attitude gets. In the comic, they drink the potions, right? You don’t drink them in this. You throw an unlimited supply of them. Why even have them be potions at all? Just make them bombs, for god’s sake. They’re poorly implemented either way, with usually only one type of potion found in a level. There’s also a fire one that does the “light the dark room” trope, but once again, all it manages to do is slow down an already slow game. Astérix isn’t even a BAD game in all-caps. Instead, it feels like it had everything it needed to to be up there with the 8-bit Mickey Mouse games, and it just never really got going. You know how cars sound sad when their engine won’t start no matter how many times you turn the key? Astérix is the embodiment of that noise. It looks great, but it never gets out of the driveway.\n\nVerdict: NO!\n\nNintendo World Championships: NES Edition (Switch Review)\n\nJuly 31, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nNintendo World Championships: NES Edition\n\nPlatform: Nintendo Switch\n\nReleased July 18, 2024\n\nDirected by Hirotaka Watanabe\n\nDeveloped by Nintendo EPD and indiezero\n\nPoint of Sale: Nintendo Switch\n\nMy brain can’t process that it’s been nearly a decade since I reviewed NES Remix. It feels much longer than ten years ago. Back in those days, I didn’t really review retro stuff a whole lot, and I still don’t review many modern AAA games. In the case of NES Remix, I didn’t grow up with any of the games in it, and I had a very anti-retro streak to me at the time. And yet, the WarioWare-like breakdown of them into micro games, for whatever reason, captured my imagination like few Wii U games did. NES Remix was legitimately one of my favorite games in a year that saw such releases as Grand Theft Auto V and The Last of Us. It just worked for me, even though I didn’t care at all about high scores back then and I’ve never been into speed running. I was totally stoked when NES Remix 2 was announced, but my excitement quickly vanished. It didn’t even do anything wrong, except maybe have a few games that didn’t lend themselves to the concept (Wario Woods, for example). But really, it just wasn’t fresh anymore. I don’t even remember playing Ultimate NES Remix and was actually completely shocked that I have it. But, enough time has passed and I’m old enough now to look back fondly on NES Remix as that big surprise 2013 game that just totally owned me for about a week or two. That’s why I was excited for Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition. Now that I’ve finished all the main game tasks, my final reaction is somewhere between my reactions to NES Remix 1 and 2.\n\nSome people are saying Nintendo World Championships is only for speed runners, but I’m not into that scene at all and I enjoyed NWC enough that I wasn’t bored at all. It sure gave me a better appreciation for what world champion speed runners have to accomplish. I tried to imagine maintaining the tiny fractions of perfection NWC asks of players over the course of a whole game and I gave myself a headache. Nope, I could never do it. There’s a big difference between setting a pinball high score and setting a world record in speed running, where players regularly redefine what a “perfect game” is. I was reminded of that when I took a gander at the previous week of NWC’s online tournament. The big selling point of Nintendo World Championships is weekly competitions in five different micro-contests. I thought I put up some pretty good times. Hey, I got an “S” rating in all five! Then I saw that the winner in the Donkey Kong contest did it by glitching out the game and climbing ladders that weren’t there.\n\nThis wouldn’t bother me, except Nintendo World Championships put the screws to MY attempts to circumvent certain aspects of the game. For example, the big challenge in Super Mario Bros 3 is “finish world 1.” What the game doesn’t tell you is you have to do it the way they want you to. Now, I can understand if the challenge is laid out as “finish level 1 – 1” in Super Mario 1 and taking the pipe to skip the entire middle of the level isn’t allowed. Which, by the way, that’s one of the games. But, “finish World 1” is one of those things where players should be able to come up with their own strategies, something I’m a BIG fan of. I put so much stock in a game’s strategic flexibility that it’s often THE difference between a YES! and a NO! in many of my reviews of high score-driven coin-ops, and I highly prize flexibility in pinball as well. A challenge like “finish World 1” feels pretty open, doesn’t it? I figured “use both warp whistles to skip to level 8, thus TECHNICALLY finishing world 1” would probably have not been allowed. But you don’t have to play any of the optional levels that aren’t on the straightest path to the castle. That’s why, when I reached the dungeon, I decided to skip the fight with Boom Boom by grabbing the warp whistle. “Not so fast!” said the game, literally rewinding it because that was against the rules. Oh NOW you care about the integrity of the game and the spirit of the rules, huh? That’s rich, especially given how people are winning the online tournaments.\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out what my ultimate verdict for NWC would be, because it’s such a bare-bones concept. There’s no leaderboards, so besides finding out how YOU placed (including alternate standings based on your year of birth) and videos of the winning performances for each week’s games, you can’t learn how to do any of the tricks the pros are using. That sucks, since most of the winners involve the type of glitches that aren’t allowed in many speed running communities. Usually, for dedicated competitors in this field, there’s two categories: glitch and non-glitch. Nintendo could have used that kind of consideration, because it was really demoralizing for me to find out that not only were the scores I posted no good, but I wasn’t even close. Or hell, if you’re allowing the glitching, how about instructions on how to do it? Maybe it’d be fun to learn! Except, there are none.\n\nAdvanced tips or instructions for each game would have been helpful, or hell, just more specific guidelines. Rules like “no pipes” or “no warp whistle” are not stated. The level 1-1 example in Super Mario I mentioned above? The rules in their entirety simply say “Grab the Goal Pole.” THAT IS IT, even though there are more rules that punish you for violating them, specifically “no using a pipe.” You’re telling me that they couldn’t have included the words “no using pipes?” Really? The game will automatically rewind any illegal move, but the scoreboard’s timer is still running. That’s not a big deal if the challenge only takes 30 seconds to beat, but in the case of Super Mario 3’s challenge, yea, it sucks to play for a few minutes only to discover that you just broke one of the literally unwritten rules, costing you valuable time.\n\nSometimes, NWC isn’t consistent with its rules, especially when it comes to going off the intended pathway. Challenges like “beat Cerberus in Kid Icarus’s first dungeon” and “beat Mario 1” allow players to sometimes go the wrong directions without being rewound. For example, level Mario’s 8-4’s maze will not rewind you for taking the wrong pipe. That’s probably how it should be, right? Except that’s rarely the case. Challenges like getting to Level 1 in Zelda as fast as you can will literally stop you from going in any direction but the shortest route. For the most part, players are not allowed to explore and discover the best routes for themselves and have to follow the exact path taken by the sample video. Wait, really? Wouldn’t that, you know, DEFEAT THE WHOLE POINT OF A CHALLENGE LIKE THAT? I wish they had both ways. Have specific tactical instructions for those who want it, while also leaving it open for people who want to find out on their own. With how they have it, they’ve basically turned the exploration games into digital cross country running trials. While I’m on the subject, the sample videos would be helpful, but those videos show deliberately poor gameplay. So clearly they DO want players to figure some stuff out, but not big picture stuff. Besides the videos and a bluntly-stated goal, there ARE no instructions or even tips for 143 of the 156 challenges. Only the “big challenges” offer tips, though some others LITERALLY OVERLAY ARROWS on top of the gameplay telling you which way to go or for some other happening, like “a warp zone is near!”\n\nI’m not even a little mad that people know how to cheese these games with glitches. That can be fun! Hell, I liked to get a rise out of family and friends by betting them I could beat Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past in under an hour or two, then doing it in under five minutes. But, it’s just a parlor trick, right? Even if NWC taught players the glitches the winners are using, I don’t think I’d want an entire game based around learning video game parlor tricks. Now, assuming you’re deeply into that type of speed running, I still think you’ll probably be frustrated with how little competitive value you get with NWC. Out of a pool of 156 challenges, only five are played competitively every week, and then three of those five challenges are used for the two tiers of pseudo-online survival challenges. That’s it. That’s the entire extent of the online play. There’s no leaderboards for individual challenges or viewable ghosts of the record holders. There’s no challenging your friends or seeing ghosts of their games. No-brainer features are just not here.\n\nThere’s also no variety of challenge types in Nintendo World Championships. NES Remix had tasks like “don’t lose a life” or “stay alive for X amount of time.” Those are gone completely. Every challenge is a time attack. All 156 of them. It’s so limiting and uninspired. I imagine at some point a bigger pool of games will be added, but I wouldn’t bet on Nintendo getting creative beyond that. And while I’m on the subject, the game is called Nintendo World Championships, right? So, why is this NOTHING like the original Nintendo World Championships? That contest sandwiched three games together, requiring players to get 50 coins in Super Mario 1, complete a lap in Rad Racer, then with all the time remaining, score as much as you can in Tetris. There is NOTHING like that in the modern Nintendo World Championships! The only thing they have in common is the logo itself! The closest Switch’s NWC comes to that is when you complete all 156 timed challenges with a score of at least A or higher, you unlock “legendary trial.” It’s just a lazy thirteen round marathon of all the final challenges. Mind you, each final challenge is the longest one of that game. I’d be interested in playing shorter versions of such a marathon, but nothing like that is included. In fact, there’s no other mix-and-matching at all outside of survival mode. Oh, I forgot: when I said “five challenges a week” I mean five SEPARATE challenges. Do one or all five, but you only get ranked on each individual challenge and not the group as a whole. So weak.\n\nFor the purposes of this review, I’ll say that Speedrun Mode is the “main mode.” It’s a series of 156 timed challenges unevenly split between thirteen games. The challenge breakdown is as follows:\n\n14 for Super Mario Bros.\n\n15 for Legend of Zelda\n\n13 for Metroid\n\n8 for Donkey Kong\n\n9 for Kid Icarus\n\n12 for Super Mario Bros. 2\n\n6 for Excitebike\n\n6 for Ice Climber\n\n7 for Balloon Fight\n\n24 for Super Mario Bros. 3\n\n15 for Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\n\n8 for The Lost Levels, aka Super Mario Bros. 2\n\n20 for Kirby’s Adventure\n\nGetting an “A” in every challenge isn’t too hard. Out of 156 games, less than 10 saw me get one of the B rankings on my first successful attempt. Now, getting an “S” is an entirely different story. Sometimes I literally couldn’t believe I got an “S” ranking as I played sloppily and made mistakes, and other times my jaw literally dropped when I didn’t get the perfect rating. I knocked out an “S” in every Zelda 1 challenge in three tries or less, except one where you had to kill three bats. That one took me probably 50 or so attempts. Meanwhile, I couldn’t get A++/S rankings in most Kirby tasks even if I tried, and I did! If the challenges were all short enough that they could be finished in 10 seconds, I’d probably keep playing until my scorecard was nothing but S rankings. But, some take a lot longer, and all the final challenges are the “big ones” of that game. Mario 1’s final challenge is just “beat the game from level 1-1, with warping.” Sure, it can be done in around 4 minutes if you know what to do. I don’t, and it sounds like a big time investment to learn how to get that good. NWC doesn’t tell you the target times for each grade. What’s an A+? Apparently under 8 minutes and 2 seconds, because that was my best time. What’s an S? You’ll know when you get it. A+ is actually the third highest grade, by the way. There’s A++, and I never saw less than a “B+” at any point. This is like one of those “teachers can’t use red ink to grade students anymore” things, isn’t it?\n\nSince the games are emulated, all the problems that come with the originals are here. Kirby’s Adventure has TONS of slowdown, only the clock keeping your time doesn’t slow down at all. Donkey Kong is missing the factory stage. Ice Climber is just the worst, and Nintendo’s continued insistence in celebrating it would be like having an incredible artist regularly hang out in your home, only they keep leaving upper-deckers in your toilet for no apparent reason. I only got all S-rankings for Zelda 1, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, and Ice Climber, but except for Zelda, that had more to do with how few challenges were involved. Mario 3 has the most challenges, and each of the seven Koopa Kids gets their own challenge. The only boss missing is Bowser. Come to think of it, the only “last boss” challenges are Mario 1’s “beat the game” finale and Metroid’s “escape the bomb” sequence, and even that is lacking the Mother Brain fight. It’s like Nintendo deliberately avoided spoilers for these literally three-to-four decade-old games. Boss fights work great in NWC, but there’s only three Legend of Zelda bosses, three Zelda II bosses, and three Kirby’s Adventure bosses. Super Mario 2 gets only Birdo and Mouser, and Kid Icarus only gets its first boss. Since boss fights were easily my favorite type of challenge, it sucks that Nintendo excluded so many that would have lent themselves perfectly to this game. I would love for nothing more than this review to be rendered outdated with updates that add more challenges, increase the variety of challenge-types and add more online features. Especially friend-based features (seriously how did THAT get left out?) or leaderboards.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSigh. I sort of have to give Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition a YES! because I had enough fun playing it. The worst gameplay aspect is an exceptionally bad automatic-rewind that happens when you die or do one of the FORBIDDEN moves. In theory it resets you to just before whatever you just died from. In practice, in games like Mario 1 or Kid Icarus, I died more from the rewind dropping me off in the middle of a jump than I did from the original deaths. I’m not even exaggerating, it is THAT bad. The rest is, eh, you know, fine. Nintendo World Championships certainly doesn’t rise to the level of “very good.” The online component means absolutely nothing to me because it’s too limited and not very fun. Five challenges a week is not enough for a game focused on online play. I can’t even see myself booting this up every week to play the next five contests. As for local multiplayer, unless every person you get is in roughly the same skill range, you’re not going to have any fun, at least as a group. It only takes one player who is fairly better than the rest to wreck the entire session. I was dis-invited from playing with my nephew and his friends because I was that player, though I probably should note that they were equally matched, more or less, and seemed to have a lot of fun once they booted me. But, be warned: playing eight-player mode means using JoyCons turned on their side, which I personally think is the worst game controller configuration of my entire lifetime.\n\nAll I had left to base this review on was the 156 challenges. I started them on Sunday. I finished all of them with at least an “A” or better after just a few hours on Monday, with no intent of sticking around long enough to unlock everything. I spent most of Tuesday writing this review and bumping the “easy” ones that I “should” have gotten to an S, while also verifying that some of the challenges are just really boring. Besides the boss fights, my favorites were all 10-seconds-or-less games. That’s when NWC becomes gaming crack. Beating whole levels? Eh, it’s fine, but I really don’t think any of them quite reached that “just one more try” sweet spot, and some of the challenges I enjoyed so little that I don’t think I’ll ever play them again, regardless of how bad my scores might be. In fact, I’m not even sure my NWC cart will ever go back inside my Switch. (UPDATE – August 10, 2024: In the interest of fairness, I did return to Nintendo World Championships even when I thought I wouldn’t. Initially to check my previous week’s results, but I ended up spending time on the week’s five new competitive challenges. This is a game that’s deceptively addictive, but I did have a good time.) Okay, maybe when the inevitable add-ons hit, I’ll reload it to at least play each new challenge enough to get an A ranking on them too. That has to happen, right? Like, I can’t believe Donkey Kong Jr., Wrecking Crew, StarTropics, Punch-Out!!, or none of those early sports games are represented here. No third party games, either, and Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels is the only (former) Japanese exclusive. Ten years after NES Remix, and what could be considered the fourth game in the series feels, well, kind of thin. It IS possible to have fun and still be let-down. Just ask anyone who has ever slept with me.\n\nVerdict: YES! but if you’re on the fence, waiting for a sale wouldn’t be a bad idea.\n\n$59.99 ($29.99 for the standard) was soundly defeated by Jimmy Woods in the making of this review.\n\nWolverine (NES Review)\n\nJuly 27, 2024 by Indie Gamer Chick\n\nWolverine\n\nPlatform: Nintendo Entertainment System\n\nReleased October, 1991\n\nDesigned by Craig Houston and Kevin Edwards\n\nDeveloped by Software Creations\n\nPublished by Acclaim as LJN\n\nNEVER BEEN RE-RELEASED\n\nWell, I did Deadpool so I might as well throw-in a review for Wolverine. Unlike Deadpool, this is an authentic 1991 NES game that’s authentically horrible. I literally have nothing nice to say about it. A truly pathetic effort that doesn’t feel like a Wolverine game, an X-Men game, or even a superhero game. Wolverine is an utterly generic platformer with some of the worst gameplay decisions I’ve seen. The biggest one is you don’t blink when you take damage. I mean, you change colors to gray, but there’s no invincibility afterwards. No grace period to recover at all. So, naturally your attacks are some of the most low range, low impact punches and kicks ever. I mean seriously, the kick you do after throwing a couple punches looks like someone gingerly kicking a tire to see if it’s flat or not. You have to get right on top of enemies to brawl, and as you do, your life slowly trickles away. But, that’s fine because Wolverine heals from injuries. Except, they left that part out. You need to pick up.. I swear to God I’m not making this up.. burgers or soft drinks to heal you. This NES game has more menu items from McDonald’s than the NES McDonald’s games.\n\nFor a moment, I’ll ignore the absurdly tiny graphics, laughable enemy design, and ridiculous damage system. The one thing that you absolutely NEED in a Wolverine game is for the violence to be intense and impactful. Whatever is the polar opposite of intense and impact is how the combat feels here. It’s no impact, so naturally, you want to at least use your claws. That way, you can imagine that you’re slicing baddies so cleanly that it doesn’t even make them flinch. You activate the claws with SELECT for double the damage and.. they drain your health. Of course they do. They don’t even really add all that much range either, and even if you swing and miss, you still take damage. It’s a quarter-of-a-tick of a life bar for every use of the claws, in a game where you absolutely do not blink or knock-back or anything from damage. Any contact on anything lethal and your health begins to quickly drain. Since there’s no grace period, you never know how much damage something causes, or really how much you’re taking in general. You have to constantly glance down at the health bar.\n\nThis is a Wolverine game that doesn’t feel even a teeny tiny bit like Wolverine. It honestly feels like it’s outright antagonistic towards the character. There’s no way the creators of this could have been fans of the source material, because there’s nothing about controlling the Wolverine sprite that a fan would need to feel immersed, as if you really were Wolverine. That’s the whole point in doing a game based on a character, right? With this steamer, I suspect this wasn’t even meant to be Wolverine and they just took Generic Action Game Template 71189-C and added claws to it. There’s also this absurd “berzerker” meter you get for killing bad guys that gives you invincibility when it fills up. Oh, and the invincibility killed me more times than anything else in the game. Yep. You see, you can’t run and attack. This is important to note, because when you begin to BERZERK, you automatically do strikes almost continuously, making it very hard to move forward and especially build up your jumps. So, when I went to do a long jump over a pit, I didn’t get the lift I wanted because the hero was automatically swinging at NOTHING! Literally shadow boxing! What an epically stupid idea!\n\nWolverine has incredibly unimaginative level design, uninspired enemy attack patterns, and only two bosses in the entire experience that you fight back to back. The boss fights suck too. I lost a life fighting Magneto because I wasn’t sure how to hit him. I tried to kill these boulders this device was shooting at me and eventually died. I came back to life in the boss arena (the one positive thing I can say is respawn points were fine), and then the rematch ended in under 10 seconds when I stabbed the little laser barrier blocking me from Magneto, then punched him a few times until he ran away. Wow. Then the final battle with Sabretooth played out the same way. I lost a life, then I realized HE gets to be invincible. It turns out, you win by punching him off a cliff. Since it’s easy to catch him in a punching pattern, I won about fifteen seconds later, and I’ve never been happier to be done with a game.\n\nWhat an unlikable, lazy effort. Lots and lots and lots of last-pixel jumps. Lots and lots and lots of instakill elements like fire or spikes. Oh, and you drown in water too, but at one point in the swimming stage, you get a “device” that changes that. You’re told it. You don’t see it. It’s like the developers realized the rest of the stage had too much water and not enough places to come up for air, but instead of changing the whole layout, they just added a door in an arbitrary location where you get the “device” from Jubilee. It’s like players have to apply their own quality of life patch in real time. I don’t know what else to say about Wolverine. I made two full runs in under ninety minutes, with the second run taking probably a little under half an hour because I just ignored as many bad guys as I could and even accepted damage if I knew I was near the finish line for a stage. Wolverine does literally nothing right and isn’t even charming in failure. Fix any one problem and this would still be in the conversation for the worst NES platform game I’ve reviewed so far. Fix all the gameplay problems and it’d still be a NO! because the combat would be boring and the level design just very bland. Unlike Wolverine, there’s no healing this one. It’s just a bad game.\n\nVerdict: NO!"
