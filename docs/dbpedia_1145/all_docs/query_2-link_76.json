        "text": "R-Type and Assault of the Familiars.\n\nAs promised, the R-9 steps up and by hook or by crook, there was an R-Type in every shmup.\n\nWe'll play this by ear but with a lot of cheer.\n\nTo increase the tension, I'll detail regular enemy and boss names (aliases excepted) that feature in R-Type and R-Type II.\n\nWhen possible, monikers will also be assigned to others.\n\nUnless stated, all images are captured from the arcade.\n\nFirst off, the meat of C64 controversy king Denaris is happy to get this party started.\n\nSonar (left)\n\nZoid (left)\n\nBold (left)\n\nAn unsubtle background steal.\n\nCytron (left)\n\nFinally, X-Out is mine, all mine. (C64 version shown).\n\nNow let's see what Aicom's Pulstar on Neo Geo is made of.\n\nGouger (left)\n\nDop (left) gives chase and becomes an uninspiring boss.\n\nIt looks pretty innocent but the insect things move around the screen in a similar fashion and strategy is needed to progress.\n\nHarsh (left) from R-Type II\n\nForget Denaris, Blood Money on the Amiga took the piss.\n\nWorm (left)\n\nThis floor also rings a bell...\n\nParodius Da!, Konami 1990\n\nBoss 'tributes' from Pulstar.\n\nCyst (left) and Iveprowfent\n\nThat very curious name has given me a headache so I took ibuprofen, rather than paracetamol.\n\nIt's not done yet as the 'penis' is cut and pasted from another boss in R-Type II.\n\nBarakus\n\nAwesome, right? Fucking hey it is.\n\nTo finish up, please note the waterfall and POW Armour.\n\nThe snake thing emerging from the openings provided by giant maggot boss Ohme in Capcom's Ghouls 'n Ghosts behaves in a similar manner to the worm that go in and out the tubes of Cyst.\n\nAicom's masterpiece creates a tinkered design.\n\nSubatomic (left) from R-Type II and Natsumi\n\nPlanet destroying weapon Subatomic was built from the corpse of Dobkeratops.\n\nAndro Dunos was a very shitty 1992 Neo Geo effort by Visco.\n\nHere's an equally shitty attempt to disguise 'inspiration'.\n\nRios (left) from R-Type II\n\nI mean, come on...\n\nIn BlaZeon, you begin as a spaceship but a special zap later from your tranquilander on certain enemy robots allows you to assume the role of a Bio-Cyborg and with it, their powers and abilities.\n\nA scene from the intro to demonstrate the 'blue' front of your craft.\n\nRight Atlus, you're busted big time.\n\nCompiler\n\nThree individual parts that clamp together to become one?\n\nHa ha!\n\nThis boss from Denaris moves around unpredictably and doesn't split, but smacks of relevance.\n\nWhile Metal Gear has Solid Snake, this variety is infinitely more famous.\n\nShell\n\nIts durable outer casing is to blame for the misleading name.\n\nHere's how others interpreted such an iconic creation.\n\nSlayer (left) and IO (right), both on C64.\n\nProject X (left) and Katakis (right), both on Amiga\n\nPulstar has its own brilliant boss monster.\n\nKuuka\n\nMothership or Battleship?

Romero’s Dawn of the Dead, Zack Snyder is a director with ambition.\n\nThe comic book adaptation of Watchmen was incredibly drab, Man of Steel visually impressed but struggled with similar tedium and Sucker Punch was a video game missing a joypad.\n\nSo, a mixed assortment from a limited bag but 300 was undoubtedly his breakthrough.\n\nThis smash may have been the result of Frank Miller’s novel but decades before, 1962 film The 300 Spartans was basically the inspiration behind his etchings.\n\nRichard Egan, Anna Synodinou and David Farrar played King Leonidas, Queen Gorgo and Xerxes respectively.\n\nAnyway, now relegated to part producer; Noam Muno wears the sandals.\n\nBased on Miller’s graphic novel Xerxes, this serves as both a prequel and sequel.\n\nSNK’s flawed Samurai Shodown III was subbed Blades of Blood. Expect a similar substance to drip from more traditional pointy sticks...\n\nPlot details and/or spoilers will be brought in the heat of battle.\n\nCausing much death and destruction on the Aegean Seainclude:\n\nSullivan Stapleton – Themistocles\n\nEva Green – Artemisia\n\nLena Heady – Queen Gorgo\n\nRodrigo Santoro – King Xerxes\n\nOur Queen Gorgo tells a good story as during the Battle of Marathon, the good King Darius is the subject of a very good Robin Hood impression by Athenian General Themistocles.\n\nThe legendary Ralph Richardson was first to portray the titular char.\n\nXerxes mourns his father’s death and Naval Commander Artemisia hands the challenge of him taking a leisurely walk in the desert where he stumbles upon a hermits’ cave.\n\nAfter bathing in a golden liquid, he emerges invigorated as the so-called God-King and declares war on Greece.\n\nThemistocles uses political persuasion to arrange a fleet of ships so he can attack the Persians at sea.\n\nWe learn that Artemisia had an unhappy childhood and the reason behind her ruthlessness.\n\nAlthough born Greek, she effectively became Persian when witnessing the rape and murder of her family by hoplites as a child. She was subsequently used as a discardable sex object and left for dead on the streets of Persia.\n\nPitied and trained by Persia’s finest warriors, she later rose to prominence by murdering the many enemies of King Darius.\n\nThe battle for Greece begins at sea and using ships as a makeshift battering ram on opposing vessels proves to be most effective and Persian casualties effortlessly rise.\n\nExcited by Themistocles’ impressive combat strategy, he accepts Artemisia’s invitation and is escorted by masked guards.\n\nUnsheathing his sword, he takes her ‘roughly’ from behind and satisfies insatiable lust.\n\nDespite this very personal embrace, he snubs a merger and she swears vengeance.\n\nHumph! That’s gratitude for you.\n\nThe tsunami of battle continues and when tar is spilled, the situation becomes explosive when suicide bombers are introduced.\n\nBy now or at some point, Leonidas and his loyal 300 have been killed by Xerxes.\n\nThe traitorous Ephialtes (who remains one hell of a catch), is spared by Themistocles so he can alert Xerxes of his forces congregating at Salamis.\n\nAmidst the mayhem of Greek and Persian bloodshed, Themistocles and Artemisia face off.\n\n“You fight harder than you fuck.”\n\nShe scoffs at the opportunity to surrender and pays the ultimate penalty...\n\nAlong with the help of Gorgo and her allied associates, they and Themistocles charge to presumably defeat the remainder of Artemisia’s army.\n\nThis was particularly entertaining and a worthy follow-up to the much lauded original.\n\nBattles fall short of exuding genuine excitement but are spectacularly shot, with CGI looking entirely convincing.\n\nViolence is still stylishly gratuitous and remains almost cartoon-like, comparable to video game MadWorld and appropriately; the hugely successful God of War.\n\nSlow motion predictably drags its heels, but not to the point of watching sloths racing through quicksand.\n\nAlthough the script is competent, ‘for tonight, we dine in hell’; is not replaced by a suitable equivalent.\n\nWhen sex shakes the canvas, Artemisia’s guards look at one another with comical jealously.\n\nFor a blink and you'll miss it moment, this is better than anything brought by dreary spoof Meet the Spartans.\n\nStapleton's shoulders handle the pressures of primary interest reasonably well but Butler’s screen presence was undeniably more powerful.\n\nJack O’Connell does what he can with a minor role that offers little scope.\n\nProviding historical inaccuracies are given a fantastical wide berth, there are worse reasons for a six pack to be displayed.\n\n↧\n\nStarred Up - The scoop and digest\n\nWe’ve all been sent to jail, or at the very least; visited such an establishment.\n\nTo those who doubt, I assume you've never played Monopoly...\n\nClassic Australian soap Prisoner, more affectionately known as Prisoner: Cell Block H was my first stint down the block.\n\nIt was admirably reimagined as Wentworth Prison and I’m already looking forward to Season Two.\n\nThe only thing more famous on television tasted of Porridge.\n\nAmerica did time with the hard-hitting series Oz.\n\nIgnoring remakes, Burt Reynolds and his eventual Mean Machine effortlessly combined action, comedy and a rousing American Football finale.\n\nAll brawn and very little brain scream Van Damme and Stallone vehicles Death Warrant and Lock Up.\n\nStill, both are entertaining.\n\nCheating slightly, the highlight of Tango & Cash is when framed super cops Kurt Russell and again, Stallone are sent to experience life on the inside.\n\nWarrior Tom Hardy starred as Britain’s most violent prisoner in stylised biopic Bronson.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption and Escape from Alcatraz are instant classics for very different reasons.\n\nA Prophet and Cell 211 are excellent contributions brought by France and Spain respectively.\n\nYou don’t have to be an inmate to know terminology such as ‘screw’, ‘the hole’ and ‘clink’, but ‘starred up’ may have passed you by.\n\nIt’s slang for when a young offender is transferred to an adult prison.\n\nPlot details and/or spoilers will be subject to lockdown.\n\nThe horses not leaving the stable include:\n\nJack O’Connell – Eric\n\nBen Mendelsohn – Neville\n\nRupert Friend – Oliver\n\nPeter Ferdinando – Spencer\n\nSam Spruell – Deputy Governor Hayes\n\nAfter being escorted to his cell, Eric Love transforms essential teeth cleaning aid to makeshift weapon by attaching a razor blade.\n\nHe does this by burning bristles, rather than bridges.\n\nCausing ripples in a pond that was relatively quiet, amongst the carnage is father Neville.\n\nEric isn’t the kind of pussy to drink sour milk.\n\nPut it this way, an officer is grateful for therapist Oliver’s timely intervention as Eric decides against removing a testicle.\n\nA volatile relationship ensues as progress and a connection is made.\n\nWe also learn that Neville is gay, Spencer is the prison crime boss and Eric makes push ups on your knuckles easier than it looks.\n\nOliver asks session regulars to look after Eric and when he’s attacked by balaclavas, they duly oblige...\n\nVisits from dad fall flatter than a punctured pancake and when Nev reacts to a guy looking at him funny during a meeting, emotions run high.\n\nWhen taking a shower, Eric is apparently strangled but playing dead fools the aggressor who is subsequently subdued.\n\nBubbling with rage, he gives a guy the most unwelcome shave.\n\nWhile queuing up for prison slop, Eric chastises Nev for embarrassing him during a session.\n\nAs the kettle finally boils, fists do the talking in a cell.\n\nEric accuses Nev of letting him win and the reward of temporary hatred is solitary confinement for both.\n\nNow or thereabouts, Oliver goes for Hayes when Eric is labelled a waste of oxygen and subsequently leaves quietly.\n\nFalling for Nev’s claims of discomfort, Officer Self unlocks his cuffs but this gesture of goodwill isn’t reciprocated.\n\nThe climatic scenes run concurrently.\n\nNev visits Spencer and when Self is found wrapped like a baby, they beat the shit out of Eric and fashion a noose from a sheet.\n\nSpencer is killed and when Nev clears the danger, he orders Hayes to cut Eric down.\n\nEric survives and the bent Hayes radios in the incident as an attempted suicide.\n\nBefore Nev is bundled in a truck for an imminent transfer, compassion is shown for Eric to say his goodbyes.\n\nAs pleasantries are exchanged, “I’m proud to be your father.”\n\nDavid Mackenzie’s film is nothing short of excellent and paints a brutal picture of everyday prison survival.\n\nO’Connell’s performance is so electrifying, it could power the National Grid.\n\nApart from boasting oodles of charisma, his mercurial temperament demands sympathy and orchestrates every situation.\n\nBen Mendelsohn and Rupert Friend score silver and bronze respectively and produce more venom than a cobra.\n\nThe atmosphere and tension between father and son has never been so palpable.\n\nDrawing from his own experience as a therapist in HMP Wandworth, Jonathan Asser’s script is superbly blue.\n\nViolence is never ridiculous and almost flawless in its unflinching approach to every confrontation.\n\nThis will never be a blockbuster, but is a blockbusting film.\n\nDespite all the superlatives, does this do enough to finally dethrone Alan Clarke's Scum; the undisputed daddy of the genre?\n\nNot quite and nothing ever will, but the prospect of Carlin squaring up against Eric Love would make for a mouth-watering match up.\n\n↧\n\nVideo game sleeve art comparison - Final Strike\n\nWhat was the fantastic four becomes the famous five.\n\nYou know how this Royce rolls...\n\nFirst off, we'll start with Pacific Rim in a different universe.\n\nIn the end, there can only be one...

Ha Ha.\n\nYes, this captures a more appropriate look.\n\nAlthough I've never really liked this, it's what most know and grew up with.\n\nH.R. Giger's Alien is engulfed in some kind of intergalactic smog.\n\nThe R-9 returns but with the inclusion of an excellent looking Dobkeratops.\n\nHe's drab, he's brown and deserves a right royal frown.\n\nRemember isometric action?\n\nNope, neither do I. Not even Dimensions enjoyed this perspective.\n\nSimilarly, details of destroying a demented viper with disastrous lip surgery also remains sketchy...\n\nThe weak point of Subatomic - up close and personal.\n\nThe writing has changed and this isn't R-Type II...\n\nWithout skating around the issue or beating around the bush, THIS IS BULLSHIT.\n\nEveryone was filled with excitement at the prospect of space travel.\n\nEr yeah. My head's in a shed.\n\nNo effort in the background department causes attribute clash.\n\nIsn't it strange that most, but not all; attempted to add spice by using completely the wrong style of writing.\n\nFor instance, Super R-Type (Japanese) is correct but R-Type on MSX (also Japanese), decided against such authenticity.\n\nHey ho.\n\nBorn in the era of Hang On, Outrun and Afterburner, Space Harrier was a cabinet moving, blood pumping, adrenaline-fuelled classic. For a small charge in the wonderful world of Shenmue, video arcades allowed you to insert virtual coin and experience the good old days...\n\nGreat job, as this accurately recreates action and enemy.\n\nOops a fucking daisy.\n\nDisjointed enemy and corny explosions are matched only by our hero's constipation.\n\nThe shit dial is cranked up a notch as only a fool would consider this cool.\n\nHappy go lucky fire-breathing dragons aside, our man has adopted a curious mullet with dysfunctional pins.\n\nThe contents of my handkerchief after ejecting a naval monsoon admittedly isn't pleasant, but in comparison, paints a picture paradise.\n\nIt's apparently therapeutic to have your body inconveniently blown apart as the dragon in red is delirious at such a sensation.\n\nThe opportunity to clamber from the plague pit of pestilence was declined...\n\nLet's see if nausea persists with how Jordan Mechner's famous creation was interpreted.\n\nThe stare of hypnotic perversion is unnecessarily eerie.\n\nHmmm, which implement would inflict more pain on the guy grinning appalling arousal?\n\nClaw hammer or chisel?\n\nAh, decisions decisions.\n\nThe chisel provided the perfect substitute to persuade the withdrawal of happiness...\n\nIt looks like the force wasn't with Luke Skywalker.\n\nA splendid effort counters tumultuous tedium.\n\nIf this is a glorious day to jump, you can all kiss my delicious rump.\n\nThe Persian darkness encompasses the disdain of painful strokes.\n\nWith eccentric boss design and decent action, Toki is held in high regard.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThis turns heads, rather than stomachs.\n\nI sense a volcanic rage will imminently erupt.\n\nConsidering the quality usually associated with the Japanese, this is rather lame.\n\nDespair sinks lower than a lizard's belly as we are given the fuck you finger.\n\nForcing the artist to inhale anal exhaust would begin to ease the pain of visual torture.\n\nThe original Shadow of the Beast (commonly known as Beast) is famed for bitplanes, an insane level of parallax scrolling, extensive copper colour reloading and a superb assortment of themes from David Whittaker.\n\nThe evils behind the visual and aural gloss is undoubtedly appalling gameplay, insane difficulty and general frustration.\n\nLet's enjoy the work of fantasy supremo Roger Dean.\n\nThere is of course a but when it moved to console...\n\nIf any animal, vegetable or mineral confidently claims the protagonist was a demented wolfman, clouting the fucker with a baseball bat will bring immediate satisfaction.\n\nWhile axes couldn't be swung, they at least could be thrown but in any case, your primary weapon was a ball and chain.\n\nDespite picking the right tool for the job, this is of little consolation to protect ourselves from unnecessary flatulence.\n\nBeast III was an Amiga exclusive so we can't be tortured further.\n\nFor me, Resident Evil has always been a pleasure in game and a 'guilty' pleasure in film.\n\nResident Evil 5 set the trend for a sad decline.\n\nLet's have a look at the indescribably brilliant 2002 Gamecube remake and 4 Resident Evil.\n\nI'm sorry, I can never get over such a ludicrous decision.\n\nEven a tacky biohazard symbol would brighten up this steaming pile of horse doodoo.\n\nWhen an actual screen scene is depicted for cover, fatal contagion detected.\n\nSticking a flesh guzzler with a dagger might be less stiff than cardboard.\n\nYears later, The Bunnyman Massacre ripped this off...\n\nCapcom's PS2 rehash was along the same lines but lacked the subtlety that made the original so great.\n\nHow bloody awful.\n\nI agree that monochrome is more abstract but choosing not to use and palette swap the Gamecube art was a bad decision.\n\nIt's not perfect but this 60 fps renovation is the definitive version.\n\nNine years later, who actually cares?\n\nIn terms of cover quality, this runs the Gamecube mighty close.\n\nI'll finish with the fear of blood tends to create fear for the flesh.\n\nI wish there were positives, but I see only negatives.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what this is, let alone how it's supposed to represent Silent Hill.\n\nContrary to popular belief, this is Alessa and not Cheryl.\n\nWhatever, it gets my vote.\n\nDecisions throughout the course of your journey dictate whether you'll face Mary

individual skill, nobody sets out to purposely die in a video game.\n\nAfter all, what's the point in playing if you have no interest in at least trying to force success?\n\nWhile it counts for nothing today, back in the 80s and 90s, arcades, home computers and consoles rewarded failure with static imagery often more legendary than the game itself.\n\nUnless stated, all screens are from the arcade.\n\nI've chosen specific pixels as I know some exist on multiple formats.\n\nThe following are basically continue screens as they simply become game over when the counter reaches zero.\n\nAs

Rising underworld star Bejo promptly orders his death via a shotgun blast to the head.\n\nFlashing back to events just after the original, police big cheese Bunawar informs Rama that in order to bring down the corrupt Reza, he must go undercover.\n\nCommitting a minor crime is traditional to feast on lumpy porridge and while in the clink, he's given the identity of Yuda - Uwais's char in Merantau.\n\nWait a mo, he's an 'undercover cop'?\n\nIf you make this dangerous act of surveillance plural, you'll have an absolute classic 1992 scrolling brawler from Irem.\n\nOnce inside, a punch-up with multiple inmates inside a toilet cubicle is just a drop in the ocean...\n\nBangun's son Uco is impressed with Rama's takedown of 15 baddies and offers allegiance, which is rejected.\n\nA set-to in mud escalates into a riot and Rama is eventually knocked out by screws.\n\nTwo years later...\n\nNow free as a bird, Rama is taken to meet Bangun who is grateful for protecting his son while inside.\n\nBangun's guy Eka escorts Rama to spacious digs where he takes the opportunity to call his wife and requests to hear the voice of his child.\n\nAt a porn den, the man in charge orders a 'bitch' wearing a strap-on to fuck a willing participant in the asshole.\n\nYes, you can't expect somebody in this line of work to ask nicely.\n\nWhen Uco informs what he receives in bribery money is no longer sufficient, things go nuts.\n\nAt some point, we meet Koso who turns out to be an assassin working for Bangun in order to provide for his family.\n\nOn the receiving end of a karambit knife, Koso later opens up to The Assassin, one of Bejo's top henchmen.\n\nWe also say hello to Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl. Incidentally, the latter is deaf and relies on her brother's instruction.\n\nThey embark on a kill crazy rampage across town as members of rival gangs fall by the wayside. Oh, Rama can't help but get stuck in and as police attack, he's at the centre of corruption.\n\nUco is 'disciplined' by his father but when Bejo and his cohorts invite themselves in, Uco blows Bangun away.\n\nRama is subsequently overpowered by The Assassin and taken away in a taxi to be presumably buried in the same sugar cane field as his brother.\n\nAlong with the help of the injured Eka, they escape but his saviour dies when taking five in a wasteland.\n\nRight boys and girls, you wouldn't like Rama when he's angry.\n\nForcing entrance to Bejo's warehouse isn't exactly subtle or scientific, but nevertheless, effective.\n\nBaseball Bat and Hammer Girl team up against Rama and once both are deprived from our company, The Assassin is eager to take care of unfinished business in the kitchen.\n\nRama dispatches the ultimate challenge and finally reaches Bejo.\n\nBang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Oh, and a few more bangs later...\n\nUco kills Reza and Bejo, but is gutted like a fish by karambit.\n\nAs the victorious and exhausted Rama staggers downstairs, Keiichi and his gang arrive. Dialogue is silently exchanged with Rama eventually stating \"No... I'm done.\"\n\nErr, what was this like? (Deep breath). How about....FUCKING INCREDIBLE.\n\nSeriously. It's that good.\n\nFisticuffs in the original were unforgettably insane but are somehow even more rip-roaring.\n\nHave trust, you've never seen anything like it.\n\nWeapons are used to terrific effect and the result is nothing short of spellbinding.\n\nFor fights turned up to 11, choreography has to be served with aplomb and I'm happy to say, this is remarkably spot on.\n\nSuch innovation is testament to Evans, who also designed and edited.\n\nThe sound of impact is suitably meaty and delicious bloodshed is effortlessly displayed without the slightest element of prudish disguise.\n\nAs the BBFC passed this uncut, they must have been having a good day.\n\nYou'd be forgiven for expecting a perfunctory story with acting slightly diffusing an otherwise colossal situation but on both counts, they're pulled from the highest of drawers.\n\nVillains are arguably straight from a comic book but who gives a flying fuck?\n\nIn case you didn't notice, Baseball Bat Man, Hammer Girl and The Assassin each have their own weapons turned against them.\n\nThis is one greedy bastard of a film as a high speed pursuit demands absolute admiration.\n\nEvery extreme battle oozes originality and Rama's showdown with The Assassin might be worth watching...\n\nThere's a nod towards Enter the Dragon in this meticulously staged event as they begin by 'touching fingers'.\n\nThe cream of orchestrating action should be associated with Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg and of course, John 'the legend' Woo but for such a fledgling director, Gareth Evans is already right up there.\n\nFor once, believing the hype machine is almost right.\n\nIt's a ludicrously entertaining, smile out loud, adrenaline pumping affair.\n\nIn regards to prolonged description, I've been purposely bashfulbecause you must simply admire the most thrilling piece of celluloid that 2014 is likely to offer for yourself.\n\nYeah, I know it's only April.\n\nOpening a fierce debate and discounting individual film, who's your personal favourite from this high-kicking list?\n\nVan Damme, Donnie Yen, Chuck Norris, Sammo Hung, Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa or Jet Li?\n\nDespite their essential significance, the end boss takes a back seat but psychotic man mountain Bolo is the obvious exception to the rule.\n\nAs for the female contingent, Maggie Cheung, Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock qualify as being actual stars.\n\nIko Uwais is the new geezer in town and like Jet Li, it's only a matter of time before America secures his services.\n\nHe is the prince of punches, king of kicks and master of melee.\n\nOf course, it would be sacrilege if Evans wasn't invited; along with his legion of bad-ass Silhat supremos.\n\nPut it this way, the 'great man' would be impressed.\n\nIf you don't know who I'm referring to, oh dear...\n\n↧\n\nHow could they allow such cover art miscellany? - Take 7\n\nShit pops up to say hello before it gets flushed back down below.\n\nBattle born and embarrassingly drawn.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to wipe my ass with some real toilet paper.\n\n(Yummy yummy, I'm hungry for bitch to enter my tummy).\n\nHang on love, let's chat shit before you commit murderous rage.\n\nWell I'd like to but I'm a bit pushed, yer' know how it is. I hope you won't take it personally.\n\nI vent furious anger towards his demented physique and disassociate an explosion of fake tan as a turgid excuse. The setting of an island paradise couldn't be more inappropriate.\n\nThink you've had a really bad day in the kitchen?\n\nWell think again as in comparison, such turmoil is luxurious.\n\nFor the white and yoke, this is surely some kind of sick fucking joke.\n\nHand over that AK-47 as one such as this with a bayonet is bound to go for an absolute mint at Gary's Guns.\n\nFalling meteorites = the end of the world.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThis is priceless.\n\nA fat incontinent fuck taking a dreamy dump accommodates a despicable occupation that only a true asshole would happily embrace.\n\nHis cap states job's worth. At least they got something right.\n\nThe big breasted beauty looks a tad overwhelmed by a horrible situation suited to an orgy of unspeakable debauchery.\n\nThe Deepest Game Ever...\n\nHa ha ha. You have to give them that one.\n\nDer der der, knife's gonna get yer, knife's gonna get yer.\n\nI wonder who or indeed what designed this wonderful portrayal of horrific insanity.\n\nI'm sure a pig possessing a snake like tongue is one of the greatest movie monsters ever conceived. How marvellous.\n\nBefore his wings are popped, I'd like to buy that dragon a drink, (providing I can piss in it first).\n\nSet. Hut Hut Hut or more appropriately, Fuck Fuck Fuck (this shit right up the ass).\n\nAs I impatiently wipe the sweat from my bored brow, agony is dismantled via diesel flavoured gin.\n\nThe nightmare of military combat brings on extreme constipation or absolute exhaustion.\n\nOn this occasion, you can't help but laugh at the misfortune of others.\n\nIt's one thing to lampoon the Prince of Darkness but it's another to completely disrespect.\n\nWhy in the holy mother of fuck would Captain Fangtastic be wearing a pair of shades?\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, howling whores needlessly shame a situation that can't sink any lower. Shit, it already has.\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"Did he fire ten shots or only two?\" Well, to tell a lie I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, and I've kinda lost wood myself. But being this is a piss poor pistol, the lamest excuse in the world, and would only cause a minor graze to your head, you've got to ask yourself one flinch: \"Do I feel generous? Well, do ya, fucker?\"\n\nAbsolutely old boy. In fact, when the chamber clicks; I'm going to take that worthless piece of metal and shove it right up your crack pipe. So I'll enjoy asking you one question: \"Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya skunk?\"\n\nHe is subsequently gunned down and back at the nick to commemorate his passing, colleagues threw a party to shame Project X (2012).\n\nMy name is Arena, I live till I cry. But that's not my problem, so come and see why. Hate me. You can't help but hate me. So come on see Arena and I can drain your life away.\n\nWill his grip on reality slip? We can only hope.\n\nThe LJN logo dominating proceedings just about sews this collateral damage up.\n\nWell eat a pie and shit a needle into my little eye.\n\nI like my cover art shaken, not stirred but this is taking the proverbial piss flaps.\n\nI don't think this tit would expect a squeeze, even if its life depended on it.\n\nOOF! Take that you horny bastard and while you're at it, give my regards to T. Rex asshole.\n\nThis zombie is in my head, it's giving me nightmares and no amount of hangover fuel is likely to remedy or help forget such a hideous malfunction of protracted paralysis.\n\nAnything deserves a chance but not when it's limper than a nervous dick disappointing a prom queen.\n\nWho ate all the seals? Who ate all the seals?\n\nYou fat bastard, you fat bastard. You ate all the seals.\n\nThere's little to like but much to hate. How about her on the left? (Head shake) The right? (Yuck) Oh come on, surely her in the middle could polish your truncheon? Okay, point taken.\n\nI present Ant and Dec - up close and personal.\n\nFuck a doodle do.\n\n58 seconds equates to how long it took for this awful piece of work to be shat into existence.\n\nEver heard of lazy beams? Of course you haven't, I've just invented them.\n\nI thank thee for such inspiration.\n\nThis is so sickly sweet, it contaminates a pint of pure orange filth.\n\nWrestling is theatrical nonsense, yet adored by millions.\n\nThe same sentiment can't be extended to this representation of cardboard torment.\n\nThe clumsiness that congregates the slums better watch the fuck out because there's a new vicious street vigilante in town, codename Elvis.\n\nI simply cannot contain my excitement as when the next pitch takes place, it's my turn to bat...\n\nI would ask our man to construct a meaningful hypothesis but I simply don't have the heart, as this poor bastard is probably one step away from suicide.\n\n↧\n\nHearing the same, seeing different - Crack 2\n\nAlligator and Alligata\n\nThe said album is also a 1980 film as a very convincing beast enjoys devouring several humans before going boom.\n\n8 bit developer and publisher.\n\nThe 13th Floor and The Thirteenth Floor\n\nVampire Knight and Vampire Night\n\nOriginally released for arcades in 2000.\n\nDeath Watch and Deathwatch\n\nGod Hand and Godhand\n\nSquare indulged with Final Fantasy VII fighting spin-off - Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring.\n\nIt was ported to PS1 in 1999.\n\nSchool Daze and Skool Daze\n\nThe 1984 sequel to this absolute classic was Back to Skool.\n\nTokyo and Tokio\n\nThe Tokyo Skytree in Japan's capital.\n\nA char from Sega's 1995 arcade Fighting Vipers.\n\nF.E.A.R. and Fear\n\nA decent enough thriller but probably consigned to Mark Wahlberg obscurity.\n\nKronos, Cronos and Chronos\n\nA solid 1987 shmup with Tim Follin at the musical helm.\n\nCronos in God of War III.\n\nZombie and Zombi\n\nThis famous survival horror of sorts was first released in 1986 and its futuristic remake (ZombiU) were inspired by a certain horror set in a shopping mall...\n\nCompare the above to poster artwork for a striking resemblance.\n\nDead Rising covered its undead back by using this disclaimer.\n\n\"This game was not developed, approved or licensed by the owners or creators of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead.\"\n\nThe famous tagline is made by Ken Foree, (repeated in the 2004 remake) and refers to something his voodoo priest grandaddy in Trinidad used to tell him.\n\nI've just had a thought. Was Tom Savini's biker char Sex Machine in cult vampire horror From Dusk Till Dawn a purposeful tribute by Robert Rodriguez?\n\nIt's certainly a possibility.\n\nCreatures and C.R.E.A.T.U.R.E.S\n\nIn 1996, 'artificial life' was born.\n\nIn comparison, it's a shame Torture Trouble sort of sucked ass.\n\nUnderworld and Underwurlde\n\nThe stunning Kate Beckinsale as Selene in the marmite tasting franchise.\n\nFlip-screen shenanigans from 1984.\n\nStryker and Striker\n\nMade his debut in Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nSNK took a gamble by introducing the 'striker' system in The King of Fighters '99.\n\nDanny Huston as Colonel William Stryker in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\n\nGopher and Gofer\n\nGofer was merely a small portion of Bacterion in Gradius II.\n\nKen-Go and Kengo series\n\nAlthough unconfirmed, I'd confidently suggest that this 1991 effort from Irem serves as a pseudo sequel to Ninja Spirit.\n\nTommy Gunn and Tommy Gun\n\nThe late Tommy Morrison appeared in Rocky V.\n\nThis Charming Man chose a sensible weapon to handle.\n\nKabal and Cabal\n\nAnother debutant from Mortal Kombat 3.\n\nAdapted for the screen as Nightbreed in 1990, the imagination of Midian deserved more recognition.\n\nHell-Hound and Hellhound\n\n'Select your machine' in Yumekobo's (formerly Aicom) 1998 sequel to Neo Geo smash Pulstar. Piloted again by Kaoru Y. original craft Dino 246 made a reappearance.\n\nAsayuki definitely got the bum deal with Peplos.\n\nThere was a spate of Mortal Kombat wannabes and Bloodstorm favoured sprite over digitised violence.\n\nTom and Jerry and Tom & Gerri\n\nThe third episode from Inside No. 9 explored mental illness.\n\nCashier No. 9 is also a band. Yeah, I can't help myself. Ha ha.\n\nSub-Zero and Subzero\n\nThe first stalker to bite the dust in entertaining Schwarzenegger popcorn The Running Man was Sub Zero (the late Professor Toru Tanaka).\n\nAppropriately, the incredible ice man is actually introduced by Phil Hilton as 'Professor' Sub Zero.\n\nBrake and Break\n\nFevre Dream and Fever Dream\n\nKnowing I'd eventually use it, I took a snap of this very, very odd coincidence in The Last of Us.\n\nMadder than a hatter, right?\n\nJack Krauser and Wolfgang Krauzer\n\nVillains usually assume a monstrous transformation in Umbrella land and Leon's nemesis Krauser is no exception to the rule in Resident Evil 4.\n\nKrauzer made his first appearance as the final challenge in Fatal Fury 2.\n\nAppreciate the proverbial tank in the superb Real Bout Fatal Fury Special.\n\nVasquez and Vazquez\n\nJenette Goldstein scored lesser roles but her claim to kick ass fame was Aliens.\n\nAlthough nothing to do with James Cameron, vampire vehicle Near Dark ironically reunited her with fellow xenomorphic stars Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton.\n\nA minor char from Assassin's Creed III: Liberation.\n\nLooper and Luper\n\nA flying mushroom thing from Sega's Space Harrier.\n\nCable and Kable\n\nGerard Butler portrayed the ultimate warrior in the unsuccessful pick up and play film Gamer.\n\nAs the name fitted...\n\nEdi.E and Eddy\n\nCaptain Commando also featured boss Dolg who could easily be a relative of Abigail from Street Fighter '89, sorry Final Fight.\n\n'Ere lads, on the ed will yer'?

Top ten\n\nRight ladies and gents, boys and girls - may I present my top ten 'rewards' for failing in pixels.\n\nAs it has to be, in descending order - here goes.\n\nCatherine, 2011 (PS3/360)\n\nWe go over Haunting Ground as the effect is virtually a carbon copy.\n\nAlthough Vincent's nightmarish exploits was fairly original, I was never a fan but remember, sex sells...\n\nUrban Strike, 1994 (Mega Drive)\n\nThe explosive reflection caps off a sorry situation.\n\nDeadstorm Pirates, 2010 (Arcade)\n\nNamco ought to be ashamed of this absolutely shameless steal of Sega's Let's Go Jungle.\n\nEternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, 2002 (Gamecube)\n\nFancy having your brain more scrambled than an egg?\n\nI give you a classic from Silicon Knights.\n\nNam-1975, 1990 (Neo Geo)\n\nWho knows what SNK were trying to suggest but if the unknown explanation isn't written on the card he's clutching, then I'll be a son of a good old-fashioned service revolver.\n\nOperation Wolf, 1987 (Arcade)\n\nLet me get this straight. The punishment for running out of ammo is imprisonment, even though your itchy trigger finger (barring a terrible aim), has already wiped out x amount of enemy soldiers and vehicles.\n\nOh my God, that decision is genuinely funny.\n\nHere's fun, what about immediate death by firing squad?\n\nCastlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, 2005 (DS)\n\nKonami have brought several goodies but this is definitely the best that Dracula's crypt has to offer.\n\nHexx: Heresy of the Wizard, 1994 (MS-DOS)\n\nThou art dead!\n\nAlthough primarily a rip-off of Dungeon Master, Bloodwych was extremely successful.\n\nWhat has that got to do with this? Well it's because this grisly skeleton fails to disguise a later effort, minimally altered from Psygnosis.\n\nYou have sustained a lethal injury. Sorry, but you are finished (pause) here.\n\nOp Wolf's proper death screen is fairly dramatic but come on, his cap hasn't even come off. Classic.\n\nCustomary drum roll please.\n\nYou knew what would reign supreme from the very off, didn't you?\n\nNo? Well I don't believe you. Ha ha.\n\nShadow of the Beast II, 1990 (Amiga)\n\nUnlike the first, David Whittaker stepped aside and Tim Wright brilliantly exploited the responsibility of composing terrific melancholy to separate incredible frustration.\n\nIt is the ultimate personification of humiliation.\n\nIt's apparently a good fucking laugh to plagiarise Agony, as keyboardist Stian Aarstad of Norwegian band Dimmu Borgir and Sorgens Kammer famously demonstrated. It was subsequently removed from the re-recording of album Stormblast.\n\nNot stopping there, two wrongs took the piss as Alt Lys Er Svunnet Hen offensively shoplifted the intro from British band Magnum's Sacred Hour, that featured on album Chase the Dragon.\n\nI don't like repeating myself but please search 'links' for many more cast iron examples in numerous forms.\n\nSo does anything (past or present), deserve to topple Beast II?\n\nWhether you agree or disagree, I'd welcome any comments and/or feedback.\n\n↧\n\nFinal Fantasy - North America, spin-offs, remakes and miscellany\n\nFew can argue that Final Fantasy is the most famous RPG series of all time.\n\nHowever, this claim only reeked of accuracy when Final Fantasy VII broke Europe and became a phenomenon in 1997.\n\nBy the time asses were leisurely revved to release the original hexalogy on a variety of popular platforms, we’d already worn out several pairs of 3D slippers.\n\nDue to the strong inclination of probable lunacy, in-depth analysis has been sensibly declined, so you might call this parsimonious indoctrination.\n\nCan you taste it? Well if not, I suggest you scroll on.\n\nNorth America\n\nFor reference, please observe their original Japanese release.\n\nFinal Fantasy (1987) *\n\nFinal Fantasy II (1988) *\n\nFinal Fantasy III (1990) *\n\nFinal Fantasy IV (1991) **\n\nFinal Fantasy V (1992) **\n\nFinal Fantasy VI (1994) **\n\n* - Famicom only\n\n** – Super Famicom only\n\nTo spoil things, the original was remade for the MSX2 in 1989 and was also the only entry to boast a North American NES release in 1990.\n\nApart from introducing the ATB system, Final Fantasy II gave the experience system its marching orders as weapons and abilities are beefed up on usage.\n\nAlthough the concept was revolutionary, random battles practically became a necessity.\n\nOriginally appearing in 1994, Legend of the Crystals served inconveniently as a sequel to Final Fantasy V but instead of pixels, was split into four episodes of OVA (original video animation).\n\nSimple pimples so far, right?\n\nWell yes, but I fear a fly is about to enter our Super Nintendo ointment.\n\nFinal Fantasy II was released in 1991 but to avoid confusing North America, we were playing Final Fantasy IV.\n\nSimilarly, Final Fantasy III appeared in the same territory in 1994 but was really Final Fantasy VI.\n\nThe reality is that the first, second, third and fifth game never appeared on the SNES, not in any shape, fashion or form.\n\nIf only they‘d showed balls and just called them Final Fantasy IV and VI, then at least nobody could accuse them of misleading the shit out of people.\n\nEqually, the whispers of ‘what the fuck happened to the others’ would be unavoidable so it’s one of those ‘lose lose’ situations.\n\nIgnoring updates and compilations, Darkstalkers (Vampire Savior in Japan) succeeded in annoying rather than confusing PS1 and more so, Saturn owners.\n\nDarkstalkers and Darkstalkers’ Revenge were released for PS1 and Saturn respectively but while Darkstalkers 3 enjoyed an international stab on PS1, it stayed in Japanfor Sega’s machine which (unlike the sequel), a 4MB RAM cart to assist with animation and load times wasn't a necessity.\n\nRAM carts weren't uncommon for high-end 2D sprite mayhem as Neo Geo ports of Metal Slug and King of Fighters demanded extra memory.\n\nWhatever they say, it suggests that Capcom knew the PS1 didn't possess enough tools and the third was ultimately a technically less impressive game.\n\nDespite a ton of animation missing, it held up well.\n\nSpin-offs\n\nThe Final Fantasy Legend on Game Boy in 1989 kicked off the successful SaGa brand.\n\nEven if you've never played it, Romancing SaGa on Super Famicom should at least ring the loudest of bells.\n\nCuriously, this wasn't even a Final Fantasy game so what the sprite?\n\nWhen released outside of Japan in 1990, it was translated and rebranded to cash in on Final Fantasy’s ongoing popularity.\n\nOn the silver screen, Lucio Fulci’s 1979 undead classic Zombie, aka Zombie Flesh Eaters, was also subject to identical tactics.\n\nWhen Romero’s Dawn of the Dead ate pasta and went shopping in Italy, it was known as Zombi so Fulci’s standalone film became Zombi 2 in the hope to reap similar success.\n\n32 bit boots were filled on PS1 but as the original SaGa Frontier selfishly wasn't our PAL, most and many jumped straight through sequel hoops.\n\nIn 1991, Final Fantasy Adventure (again unique to Game Boy), was the first actual spin-off and the Mana series was born.\n\nThe PAL version was called Mystic Quest so in retrospect, doesn't mean fucking anything to man or beast.\n\n3P simultaneous monster Secret of Mana was strictly sublime on SNES.\n\nA year later, we span out of control with an exclusive and direct spin-off on Nintendo’s 16 bits.\n\nIn other words, it wasn't responsible for the creation of another series.\n\nOn a global scale:\n\nFinal Fantasy: Mystic Quest (North America)\n\nFinal Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest (Japan)\n\nMystic Quest Legend (Europe)\n\nJapanand Europe didn't see the light of day until 1993.\n\nMarketed as a ‘beginners’ RPG, exploration, bosses and regular monsters were still trademark and for the truly lazy, you could even have the CPU control your ally.\n\nThe Japanese name makes relative sense but once again, why did they remove ‘Final Fantasy’ for the European contingent?\n\nArrrrggghhhhh!\n\nRemakes\n\nAlthough a right royal pain in the corpulent behind, it was possible to own the first six games on multiple formats but even then, importing was required for specific remakes.\n\nOn this occasion, mobile efforts will be included.\n\nSo let’s look at when and how each entry eventually made its way to whatever device or system.\n\nUnlike the SNES, this is a WYSIWIG situation.\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nAlthough the formula remained identical, Bandai’s Wonderswan Colour boasted new scenarios and cut scenes in year 2000.\n\nLike the Neo Geo Pocket, there was an earlier b/w system.\n\nWhat do Nokia’s N-Gage and Tiger’s Game.Com have in common?\n\nThey both flopped quicker than a Viagra shy pensioner.\n\nBandai itself combined a good few years ago with Namco to become, er, Bandai Namco.\n\nRightly or wrongly and because I’m old school, I still call them Namco.\n\nAm I alone? Probably not.\n\nMany years later, the PSP was host to an update in 2008 with redrawn graphics and improved sound. Almost inevitably, we could delve inside an art gallery, be treated with fabulous CGI and explore new dungeons.\n\nFinal Fantasy II\n\nFollowing on from the above, Bandai’s modestly colourful machine exploited matters in 2001 and the PSP equivalent came out shortly after the updated original.\n\nFinal Fantasy III\n\nThree is a magic number, yes it is. It’s a magic number.\n\nUsually yes, but seventeen years later is the duration for its whimsical DS wand to be weaved in Europe.\n\nNew side quests, touch screen interaction and a graphical overhaul complete enhancements not worth waiting for.\n\nJust to make things more ridiculous, the PSP became host in 2011/2012 but was only available on Japanese import.\n\nThe game itself looks to be based on the DS remake.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV\n\nThe final instalment on Wonderswan appeared in 2002.\n\nUp next was the Game Boy Advance in 2006 which had new side quests, overworld and underworld areas.\n\nThe 2008 DS version wasn't just a port, but a turbocharged remake as 3D graphics kicked more ass than the CGI contained. It also made the effort to include voiced cut scenes.\n\nThat’s the way to do it.\n\nCapcom may have magnificently reimagined Resident Evil on Gamecube but it remains a cardinal sin that the same courtesy wasn't extended to Resident Evil 2 and Dreamcast powerhouse Veronica.\n\nGetting straight ports of Nemesis and cut-scene extended Veronica X was a boring consolation, especially since the latter was already ancient on PS2.\n\nPicking up my dummy in frustration…\n\nFinal Fantasy V\n\nThe Game Boy Advance benefited in 2007 with Android achieving the same principle in 2013.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI\n\nThis was remade to a certain extent for PS1 in 1999 with exclusive CGI.\n\nTo prep PS2 owners for a potentially exciting 3D playing field, the demo disc of Final Fantasy X couldn't fail to disappoint.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance and Android created a similar experience in 2007 and 2014 respectively.\n\nCompilations\n\nFinal Fantasy Anthology (NTSC) made its way to PS1 in 1999.\n\nWhy not PAL? Hmmm.\n\nThis contained Final Fantasy V (previously never released in North America) and VI, boasting CGI, improved graphics and nicely, an exclusive music CD.\n\nNow, get ready to be baffled.\n\nFinal Fantasy Chronicles was unique for the NTSC PS1 market and made available in 2001.\n\nWe got Final Fantasy IV from the as yet unmentioned European Anthology and Chrono Trigger.\n\nYeah, that’s right - Chrono Trigger.\n\nDiscarding wholly unnecessary animated cut scenes, the core still accompanied wine better than cheese.\n\nIt’s crazier than a shithouse rat that such a sprinkling of genius from 1995 wasn't standalone until 2009 on DS and perversely, is probably what most have played.\n\nIt’s like Konami releasing Ultimate Contra that included Contra III and Tiny Toons Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!\n\nWhy are they fucking with our minds?\n\nBrought for PSN and Xbox Live in 2010, Final Fight Double Impact suggests a pick and choose double hit combo from those available.\n\nWe did get the original Final Fight but the decision to include Magic Sword dumbfounded.\n\nI ask you, of all the games to uncomfortably shove up our ass…\n\nHa ha fucking ha. It’s fabulous.\n\nIn 2002, Final Fantasy Anthology: European Edition came to PS1.\n\nThis banquet dished out IV and V so marked a milestone PAL debut for V.\n\nHoly shit. Was it really necessary to release two slightly different anthologies, for two different regions, on the SAME bastard system?\n\nLet me think. NO.\n\nComprising of I and II, Final Fantasy Origins entertained PS1 owners in 2003.\n\nWe got some nice art cards, with the expected new coat of graphic and CGI paint.\n\nAppearing on Game Boy Advance in 2004, Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls did exactly what is presumed on the tin.\n\nTo dangle a practically pointless carrot, II included an unlockable new storyline once the normal game was completed.\n\nWhy not for the first game? I guess they couldn't be bothered.\n\nAfter a considerable hiatus and to coincide with the 20thanniversary, Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection exploded onto UMD for PSP in 2011.\n\nWhat and why?\n\nChars and storylines from IV and its sequel, The After Years are fused together for the first time and acting as a connection, all-new scenario Interlude bridges the gap between the two.\n\nEnhanced visuals is a given but Gallery brought sumptuous CG sequences and a variety of stylish illustrations.\n\nForget Interlude as when the fuck did The After Years come about?\n\nWell it was a 2008 Japanese only mobile game.\n\nSure it’s eccentric to release a sequel for something 17 years young, but at least cancels out the suggestion of any interquel or prequel bullshit.\n\nLike the futuristic mobile effort Dimensions from 2010, the adventure took an episodic route as completing a tale paved the way for another and so on.\n\nIn turn, new chars become known and a total of ten chapters await the brave.\n\nAppropriately, the same side-on battle approach of IV is taken.\n\nBuilding upon seventh heaven\n\nThe PSP took the plunge with prequel Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII in 2009.\n\nSet seven years before, the emergence of and how Shinra Corporation came to power is the integral part of its overall flavour.\n\nThings don’t go so swimmingly for Soldier Unit member Zack, who is deployed by Shinra to investigate the chaos involving missing associates.\n\nWhat makes this sauce taste slightly different is opting for mission-based mayhem instead of standard RPG fare.\n\nApart from meeting Sephiroth and other chars we know so well, the gimmick of D.M.W (Digital Mind Wave) goes some way to improve the intense hum of real-time battle.\n\nDirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII was another spin-off and starred Vincent Valentine.\n\nThis PS2 exclusive was staged after VII and second 2006 CG film Advent Children.\n\nOwners of non-interactive animation will know Advent Children had a cool featurette that recapped the Final Fantasy story so far.\n\nThe first CG laden effort, The Spirits Within was completely standalone in terms of story and chars.\n\nDo yer’ know what? Spin-offs can kiss my ripe ass…\n\nFirst appearing for arcades in 1998, Ehrgeiz: God Bless the Ring boldly reverted to the poisoned chalice of one on one 3D fighting, as Cloud and Sephiroth et al settled up old scores.\n\nThe PS1 was the only system to profit from consumers in 1999.\n\nThankfully, it was far better than Star Wars: Masters of Teras Kasi - a brilliant descent into putrescence.\n\nLet’s face it, how the fuck could it not?\n\nHow the other half live\n\nAlso for PS1, Chocobo Racing was one of the many Mario Kart clones.\n\nFlapping its wings further, Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales on DS saw our feathered friend leave the ranch and set about rescuing his chums who have been sealed in pages of a picture book by Darkmaster Bebuzzu.\n\nParticipating in so-called pop-up duels, card battles and Wario Ware style micro games, it made for something worth touching up.\n\nBefore moving to DS and Wii, Crystal Chronicles began on Gamecube and allowed up to four players to take part.\n\nUsing a GBA link cable, player data could be managed with consummate ease.\n\nTo get the most out of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, the need to purchase four GBA systems and four link cables was practically forced upon the consumer.\n\nFor whatever reason, Nintendo had a huge problem with us using actual controllers.\n\nThe Game Boy version of SNES classic A Link to the Past included an interpretation of Four Swords as a multiplayer bonus but a cart per player was needed.\n\nDid many really go through with financial bankruptcy in order to play Four Swords ‘properly’?\n\nI remain sceptical.\n\nCome on, Nintendo did us up like several angry kippers.\n\nAmalgamating 3D fighting, EX gauge and elements of RPG, Dissidia Final Fantasy and prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy were released on PSP in 2002 and 2011 respectively.\n\nMany chars (past and the then present) were selectable to be involved in a right old palaver.\n\nThe prequel’s main addition was a new scenario based story mode.\n\nTaking place a year after the original XII, DS entry Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings made for a succulent touch-screen romp.\n\nMuch like The Spirits Within, 2010 DS entry Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light was related to nothing apart from name.\n\nInstead of CG heavy sequences and/or polygonal overkill, picture book visuals injected freshness into a franchise well past its sell by date.\n\nMenu, information and main game screen are separated without suffocation that serve up several slices of juicy entertainment.\n\nMusic can enthral or appal but in the case of Square’s omnipotent franchise, it generally provides an onslaught of unearthly charm and wonderment.\n\nDistant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy and its ‘sequel’, Distant Worlds II: More Music from Final Fantasy should interest as the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra unleashes a plethora of aural excitement with their own audacious interpretations of Nobuo Uematsu’s incredible compositions.\n\nThe influence of pixels largely pollutes the big screen but in regards to capturing environment and atmosphere, I've always said Silent Hill is probably the best example.\n\nResident Evil is a guilty pleasure, DOA and Street Fighter were humorously awful but what about Uwe Boll’s Alone in the Dark?\n\nErr, yeah.\n\nHowever, that was genius compared to…The House of the Dead.\n\nPlease read the words that I write, wasting 90 minutes or so on that FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT will ruin your life.\n\nIt’s quite amazing that both atrocities excreted sequels.\n\nWhat will become of The Last of Us?\n\nA budget of millions will be powerless to prevent an absolute trainwreck.\n\nMy gut feeling is Gerard Butler (Joel) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Ellie) will fight the mutated strain of Cordyceps.\n\nMy final game to chew over, or more appropriately, tap over is 3DS effort Theatrhythm: Final Fantasy.\n\nIn the style of Rhythm Heaven, Elite Beat Agents or even PS2 obscurity Gitaroo Man, it’s basically a musical celebration to commemorate 25 years of levelling up, random battles, chatting shit, quirky chars and aimless wandering.\n\nThe sound of success is seamlessly integrated with nostalgic bleeps or fantastic cheeps.\n\nAs per usual, your focus gradually shifts from background to solely concentrate on the bombardment of directional symbol.\n\nMagic can be used and chars do level up so the RPG element is virtually but not completely binned.\n\nVery briefly, three modes of play exist.\n\nField Music Sequence (FMS) – critical hits and a faultless chain.\n\nBattle Music Sequence (BMS) – a party of up to four chibi types must rhythmically fight numerous monsters and hit points come into play.\n\nEvent Music Sequence (EMS) – a solitary situation set against CG cinema from a specific game.\n\nFirst impressions smelled rotten but persevering escalates beyond a cheap gimmick and generates the aura of satisfying addiction.\n\nSummoning up\n\nI could delve deeper with Tactics and ‘subscription required’ but the buck stops here.\n\nPersonally, I fell out of love with the series ever since it made the transition to HD.\n\nFinal Fantasy was great in its heyday but after VII climbed the highest peak, personality disappeared like water down a plughole.\n\nLightning Returns and A Realm Reborn may have run their PS3 relay, but the upcoming XV ensures the baton has already been passed to PS4/Xbox One.\n\nThe only way this cow will ever have its udders milked dry is for Gil to be withdrawn as legal tender.\n\nYeah, highly unlikely.\n\n↧\n\nArtistic beauty in music\n\nThe second chunk of three comes from the world of musical magnificence.\n\nAlthough iconic imagery will inevitably feature, I never intended this to escalate into a compilation of great album covers, as I'm sure many would struggle to qualify.\n\nHaving said that, they are no less significant.\n\nWhile I'll always mention artist, its title may be on sick leave...\n\nYou'd think that Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jacques or even Bernard Bresslaw would get the nod but 'oh hello', Charles Hawtrey beat off all competition.\n\nGeorge Best + appeared later as an enhanced cash cow.\n\nThe Manchester United and Northern Ireland legend featured in satirical track So This is Great Britain? by The Holloways.\n\n\"The prince of pleasure lost his crown by getting high and getting down\"\n\nHe is also referenced in Danny Boyle's Trainspotting when Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), reminds Renton (Ewan McGregor) of his unifying theory of life.\n\n\"Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone forever. All walks of life: George Best, for example. Had it, lost it.\"\n\nYeah. And?\n\nWell as you don't 'watch' the back of a TV, the reverse reveals all.\n\nChannel 1 (if you like) features Ian 'Beefy' Botham but switching over to Channel 3 displays surely one of the most instantly recognisable images in sport as shortly afterdefeating Ray Reardon 18-15 to be crowned World Snooker Champion in 1982, a tearful Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins beckons his wife and baby to come and share the moment.\n\nHis last great hurrah was coming back from 7 zip down to beat Steve Davis 16-15 in the 1983 UK Championship.\n\nHowever, the infamous exclamation of \"I'm fucking back\" didn't go down at all well with the WPSBA.\n\nHe had the chance to become the Master in 1987 but blew a big lead against Dennis Taylor.\n\nRegardless of his countless misdemeanors, his flamboyant and unpredictable style made snooker what it is today.\n\nOn 15 November 1957 at Madison Square Garden, Neal Rivers connects with an absolute pearler of a punch on Gene Fuller.\n\nFuller eventually won by majority decision at the end of the tenth.\n\nHead of Jym - Frank Auerbach\n\nEliran Kantor\n\nBreakthrough Dreaming - Jennifer Hathaway\n\nMila Furstova\n\nColdplay - Ghost Stories\n\nIsonicotinic Acid Ethyl Ester - Damien Hirst\n\nLike I've previously said, this also appears in the original Kick-Ass.\n\nDavid Harouni\n\nTida Bradshaw claims a visual reference of the personal nature of the album itself.\n\nEast India Youth - Total Strife Forever\n\nPaul Normansell demonstrates what can be achieved by using gloss on aluminium.\n\nA dreamy and idyllic effort by John Craig.\n\nPaul Ryan\n\nMy Great Heart - Peter Howson\n\nPilot 2 - Michael Kagan\n\nUsually associated with Yes, Asia and Shadow of the Beast, Blue Desert is one of the many sublime pieces by Roger Dean.\n\nJust don't mention Avatar, it may piss him right off...\n\nSajime Sorayama created many Sexy Robots to oil many crotches.\n\nAerosmith fancied this shiny example.\n\nUntitled - Gregory Euclide\n\nThis wonderful landscape complements Bon Iver's eponymously titled follow up to debut For Emma Forever Ago.\n\nWinston Chmielinski\n\nHannah Hooper\n\nThe Beatles had John Lennon, T-Rex had Marc Bolan, Nirvana had Kurt Cobain and The Doors had Jim Morrison.\n\nAs for Freddie, God save the Queen.\n\nAnyway, before mysteriously disappearing and officially pronounced dead in 2008, the Manics boasted Richey 'James' Edwards.\n\nUnder UK law, if the missing person has not been known to be alive for a period of at least 7 years, an application can be made to declare or presume death.\n\nCheerful stuff.\n\nI hope for their sake that new album Futurology will be better than the utter shite Rewind the Film.\n\n(Sorry lads).\n\nAnyway, Jenny Saville serves two slices of warm apple pie.\n\nStare\n\nStrategy (South Face / Front Face / North Face)\n\nMusic written by James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore.\n\nLyrics written by Nicky Wire and Richey James.\n\nAll songs in Everything Must Go were recorded between Autumn 95 and Winter 96.\n\nLong-term lyrical partner Nicky Wire assisted with Elvis Impersonator Blackpool Pier and The Girl Who Wanted To Be God but Kevin Carter, Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky and Removables were composed entirely by Edwards.\n\nIn cult 90s BBC flat-sharing comedy Game On, the fantastic From Despair to Where from Gold Against the Soul is used in episode Matthew - a Suitable Case for Treatment.\n\nAfter Chaplin buggered off to Hollywood, Neil Stuke assumed the role of self-confessed, agoraphobic macho man.\n\nUsing what he left behind, Journal for Plague Lovers illustrates posthumous and poetic genius.\n\nWe all know about Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band but Peter Blake also designed sleeves for Paul 'Modfather' Weller and Oasis's Greatest Hits album Stop the Clocks.\n\nReggie Pedro\n\nBye Bye Badman (Detail) - John Squire\n\nIt's good that he freely admits to ripping off Jackson Pollock.\n\nKing Crimson used the talent of P.J. Crook on several occasions.\n\nHowever, this painting by Barry Godber is beyond striking.\n\nKing Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King\n\nThe album title may have been a purposeful variation of Edvard Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King.\n\nBurzum's upcoming album cover is taken from Merlin and Vivien, courtesy of an engraving by French artist Gustave Doré for Alfred Tennyson's poem Idylls of the King.\n\nAfter Queen contacted Frank Kelly Freas, he repainted the cover to include the bloody demise of band members.\n\nIt's used as a running gag in Family Guy episode Killer Queen.\n\nThe bloodlust continues inside the booklet, as widespread panic understandably ensues among the human contingent.\n\nNumerous works from the late and great fantasy artist Frank Frazetta were appreciated by the likes of Molly Hatchet, Nazereth, Dust and Wolfmother.\n\nBerserker\n\nBrain\n\nDark Kingdom\n\nSnow Giants\n\nThe Sea Witch\n\nDeath Dealer 1\n\nBrought in 1973, a further five variations followed with a certain evil brick shithouse from Golden Axe looking suspiciously similar.\n\nAx Battler's mother, Tyris Flare's father and mother, together with Gilius Thunderhead's brother were all killed by Death Adder.\n\nWhat a complete and utter asshole.\n\nFor the exclusive 1991 Mega Drive sequel, Sega used a piece by Boris Vallejo, who is largely compared to Frazetta.\n\nZdzislaw Beksinski tweaks the strings of my referencing violin.\n\nNobody knows when this or any other macabre piece came about because he refused to assign year or title to anything, but I would guesstimate sometime in the late 60s to early 70s.\n\nOf course it's different to the above Death Dealing bad-ass but the principle lingers.\n\nSticking fast with Beksinski.\n\nThat has a feel of this, right?\n\nThe Face of War - Salvador Dali\n\nSurreal.\n\nLet's get back to making beautiful music because it's the turn of Philip Lawvere.\n\nIf death metal sleeves displayed fluffy clouds, bashful bunnies or playful pussy cats, they'd be definitely unsuitable for children.\n\nWes Benscoter artwork activated. Selection follows.\n\nInstead of cattle, humans are herded for imminent slaughter.\n\nThat is indeed grim but when compared to my bud Zdzislaw, Benscoter's subject matter is brighter than a rainbow.\n\nThe corpse swilling monster reminds me of Ralph Fiennes transformed as Lord Voldemort.\n\nStop me if I'm wrong...\n\nA 'doodle' from Courtney Barnett\n\nThis is either fantastic coincidence or a barefaced rip-off of...\n\n...Great Wave off Kanagawa - Katsushika Hokusai\n\nOkay, I don't know if she 'defends' herself in the sleeve notes but I'm betting against it.\n\nThe Crimson Projekct sought official permission.\n\nBe my guest to have a bite of Swiss roll H.R. Giger.\n\nSkewering the stunning Debbie Harry like a kebab may offend the meek.\n\nEmerson Lake Palmer - Brain Salad Surgery\n\nMordor VII\n\nVlad Tepes\n\nSatan I\n\nAs things are looking Hunky Dory, Andy Warhol looks a scream, hang him on your wall.\n\nOn this occasion, The Velvet Underground & Nico advise against trying to unzip and eating the white bits.\n\nAnd now for something rather strange.\n\nTime - Gediminas Pranckevicius (2009)\n\nNew Age Manhattan - Jacek Yerka (1993)\n\nNow don't those exceptionally detailed structures look largely alike?\n\nYou can't even say that Pranckevicius took inspiration, and/or simply followed in Yerka's Polish footsteps because he's Lithuanian.\n\nTaken directly from the album notes:\n\nCover image - 'Lebe, Das Leben' from the collection of Susan Nicholson\n\nWhile that doesn't particularly help, it seems The Dali Skull legacy unofficially continues...\n\nElizabeth Peyton\n\nHer contemporary style immediately shouts of Edvard Munch's most celebrated work.\n\nThe Scream\n\nThere's a reason why Dan Porter's artwork stands out.\n\nI know it, and now, the world knows it.\n\nRoy Lichtenstein 1964 pop art\n\nBusted. Big time.\n\nEven discount store Home Bargains had the lips to rape The Kiss. Yeah, I noticed.\n\nOMC - How Bizarre.\n\nThis unrelated and earlier example had the same but different idea.\n\nChromatics - Night Drive\n\nMark Kostabi was responsible for something unbelievable.\n\nUse your Illusion II became very blue.\n\nI sai Raphael, what do you think?\n\nAbout what?\n\nYer' know, Guns n' Roses, the illusion of innovation and all that jazz?\n\nWhat the FUCK are you talking about?\n\nOh never mind. No wonder you can't bed April with an attitude like that.\n\nHe indiscriminately 'borrowed' the excerpt from The School of Athens.\n\nPersonally, I think it's wrong for albums to doctor or reenact timeless masterpieces.\n\nDid they care? Obviously not.\n\nBacchus and Ariadne - Titian\n\nRaft of the Medusa - Theodore Gericault\n\nLuncheon on the Grass - Claude Monet\n\nBal du moulin de la galette - Renoir\n\nThe Death of Marat - Jacques-Louis David\n\nWelcome, Bonny Boat! - James Clarke Hook\n\nSaint Etienne - Tiger Bay\n\nNighthawks - Edward Hopper\n\nThe Last Supper - Leonardo Da Vinci\n\nThis was perversely subject to desecration.\n\nNapoleon Crossing the Alps - Jacques-Louis David\n\nThe finishing line looms large but before it does...\n\nApart from including artist and album title (or sometimes not), the following are left perfectly preserved.\n\nIf only they'd do the same with films...\n\nLiberty Leading the People - Eugene Delacroix\n\nColdplay - Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights: Hell (detail from the right wing) - Hieronymus Bosch\n\nDeep Purple - 3\n\nNetherlandish Proverbs - Pieter Bruegel the Elder\n\nFleet Foxes - Fleet Foxes\n\nBasket of Roses - Henri Fantin-Latour\n\nNew Order - Power, Corruption and Lies\n\nThe Ghost of a Flea - William Blake\n\nSoft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War) - Salvador Dali\n\nThought Industry - Songs for Insects\n\nAnother magical journey ends, but as video games will eventually be installed, that's cause for premature celebration.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBurglary of video game sleeve art\n\nIt's not only DVD, posters and music sleeve designers that do what they shouldn't.\n\nThe weird and wonderful, the past and present - they're all dying to meet you.\n\nRegion code (and year) has been taken into account.\n\nLet the stench of similarity begin.\n\nXybots vs Gryzor\n\nGradius vs Elite\n\nMidnight Resistance (Japanese) vs Operation Wolf (NES - Japanese)\n\nResistance: Fall of Man vs Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas vs Beyond Good & Evil\n\nFinal Fight 2 (North America) vs Streets of Rage\n\nIt's fairly amusing that the exclusive SNES sequel ripped off one of the many blatant clones of Capcom's arcade classic.\n\nI suppose it's a case of what goes around...\n\nNow it gets rather ooky and even downright kooky.\n\nRygar vs Kentilla\n\nDie Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas vs Times of Lore\n\n'Nam 1965-1975 vs Joe Blade\n\nSleeping Dogs vs Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike vs Shenmue\n\nWhile they who 'surround' remain relevant, do not avert your gaze from he looking at nothing in particular.\n\nIt seems that Wei and Ryu owe Ryo a pint, but hold the pump bartender, is there a sting in the scorpion's tail?\n\nYou betcha, because Robert and Art of Fighting 3 deserve a top shelf shit mixture.\n\nIt's bad manners to point, but not according to these guys.\n\nPart 1: Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure vs Gauntlet (NES)\n\nPart 2: Deadliest Catch: Sea of Chaos vs Call of Duty 2 vs Line of Fire\n\nPart 3: Rampart (Master System) vs Cabal\n\nFor originality personified, look no further than mischief on NES, which of course came out after those existing on disc or cassette.\n\nLet's face it, all you need is 8 bits.\n\nBefore I disappear like a fart in the wind...\n\nBully: Scholarship Edition vs Street Fighter Alpha 2\n\nAwesome, right?\n\nClass dismissed.\n\n↧\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past - The scoop and digest\n\nWith its colourful array of complicated heroes and malevolent baddies, the Marvel universe continues to fascinate beyond obsession.\n\nDC? What's that?\n\nBryan Singer takes the usual suspects back on board as we indulge with a sequel to First Class, featuring references/inferences to The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\n\nMindless action outing Wolverine’s Rage hogged Game Boy Colour d-pads in 2001.\n\nX-Men 2: Wolverine’s Revenge on PS2 was released to coincide, but wasn't canonical to X2 as hacking and third-person slashing through the titular char’s mysterious past of 1968 smelled of distinct mediocrity.\n\nI could go on and on about related comic book pixels, but…\n\nPlot details and/or spoilers are sent from the future to repair the past.\n\nCausing ripples in the river of time include:\n\nHugh Jackman – Wolverine/Logan\n\nJames McAvoy – Charles\n\nMichael Fassbender – Erik\n\nJennifer Lawrence – Mystique/Raven\n\nPatrick Stewart – Professor Xavier\n\nIan McKellan – Magneto\n\nHalleBerry– Storm\n\nEllen Page – Kitty\n\nPeter Dinklage – Dr. Trask\n\nNicholas Hoult – Beast/Hank\n\nIn 2023, Sentinels bear no mechanical scruples when obliterating human and/or mutant ass. Those pinned down in Moscow do their utmost to resist but sensing their aggressors’ oppression will imminently overwhelm, Kitty’s ability to project a person’s consciousness back in time saves the longest of days.\n\nThe sagacious ramblings of Professor X and Magneto suggest for Kitty to send the sub-conscious of Wolverine to enjoy 1973 and avert the major disaster of Mystique dispatching Sentinel creator Dr. Trask, as exploiting her DNA will create the might of a robotic army - 50 years hence.\n\nThe future’s bleak, the future’s Sentinels.\n\nBefore waking to seek the help of Charles and Erik’s youthful selves, we take an unofficial time out to remember Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, The Who’s rock opera Quadrophenia (loosely adapted for the screen in 1979) and Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells.\n\nFilms of particular importance include The Exorcist, Mean Streets, Enter the Dragon, Don’t Look Now and The Wicker Man.\n\nAnyway, Logan locates Charles and Beast at the empty X-Mansion and busting Erik out of an apparently impregnable prison beneath The Pentagon sounds like a plan.\n\nIn order for this impossible feat to become a reality, they secure the lightning speed of Peter/Quicksilver.\n\nIf you haven’t already, I’d definitely recommend American Horror Story…\n\nPong is given a blast in his retro den which isn’t a clanger because Atari’s arcade was released in 1972.\n\nA superbly staged and occasionally comical prison break follows, with slowdown so juicy, even Super R-Type would blush.\n\nThe foxy Mystique is mischief-making in Saigon and prevents Stryker from rounding up a bunch of mutants for Trask’s research.\n\nOur asses inhale the atmosphere of France’s romantic capital and assuming the guise of an army suit, Mystique’s murderous intent is thwarted by the arrival of Logan, Beast and co.\n\nA large mural of Eugene Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People spans the entrance doors.\n\nErik believes the future will paint a very picture if Mystique is erased, but his lousily directed shot succeeds in only wounding her.\n\nAfter Tricky Dicky approves the Sentinel programme, Mystique’s blood is recovered which might give the pint-sized Trask an idea…\n\nErik intercepts a train and ensures the prototypes are ready for action by adding a little iron to their diet.\n\nIn order to regain his telepathic powers, Charles packs in the habit of intravenously injecting serum and becomes wheelchair-bound.\n\nAs Nixon unveils a clutch of robot baddies at the White House, Erik uses the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium as a makeshift barricade.\n\nThe Sentinels open fire and the good guys fail in their attempts to subdue Erik. Logan is impaled by iron procured from nearby rubble and thrown into the distant drink, seemingly condemned to a watery grave.\n\nMeanwhile, the DNA-enhanced Sentinels of the future eventually overpower mutant resistance.\n\nReverting back to the past, Erik prepares to kill Nixon but proves to be a naïve blunder, as the 37th president is in fact Mystique.\n\nCharles persuades the girl in blue not to kill the bad doctor and because of this, the future is rewritten.\n\nTrask is subsequently arrested for making a fast buck on military secrets.\n\nThe Logan of the future awakes and explores the Professor’s school who after bumping into old friends, asks the wily old dog to jog his memory from say, 1973.\n\nImpersonating Stryker, Logan is rescued by Mystique in the past.\n\nProviding your bum is willing to be numb for a little longer, a post-credits scene shows Apocalypse constructing a pyramid via telekinesis as four horsemen look on.\n\nIs Mister Sinister already among us? We’ll see...\n\nThis matches or even topples X2.\n\nEffects naturally sparkle and action twinkles in the moonlight.\n\nThe concept of going back and forth mustn’t drink from the chalice of stupidity and happily, plausibility is guzzled by the gallon.\n\nMystique altered the future, so the franchise is effectively rebooted because the previously deceased (including Scott and Jean), are all ship-shape and Bristol fashion.\n\nAlthough most pieces to this puzzle fit, a few stones are left unturned.\n\nWolverine has bone claws in the past but adamantium in the future.\n\nThis is because Stryker hasn't yet reinforced his skeleton, but in The Wolverine, the Silver Samurai (Yashida) slices off his claws that swiftly regenerate as bone. So it remains to be seen when indestructible steel was crafted (again).\n\nAlso, Kitty's ability to send people back in time doesn't make sense as she could only pass through matter in The Last Stand.\n\nVisiting Moscow left me seething with anger because Blink and you’ll miss portals.\n\nHoly fucking shit.\n\nI almost expected ‘Chell’ to overcome a series of increasingly difficult tests, introduced by darkly sarcastic artificial intelligence and eventually promised the feast of deliciously moist cake.\n\nHer namesake is also an essential supernatural ability needed to progress in Dishonored, which allows Corvo to ahem, teleport short distances.\n\nSince meeting up in the year 2000, Mystique outrageously stole the memorable sound of Robert ‘T-1000’ Patrick imitating those unfortunate enough to be sampled by physical contact.\n\nRemember, the mimetic poly-alloy cannot form complex machines. Guns and explosives selfishly have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn’t work that way, but forming solid metal shapes, such as knives and stabbing weapons, aren’t so hampered (dipshit).\n\nIt should be taken with a pinch of pepper sauce, but anything faintly resembling Stargate in X-Men: Apocalypse would cause more destruction than an unstable neutron bomb.\n\n↧\n\nEdge of Tomorrow - The scoop and digest\n\nBased on the novel All You Need is Kill penned by Horishi Sakurazaka, Director Doug Liman takes a sci-fi risk with an interesting premise fraught with danger.\n\nPlot details and/or spoilers are set to repeat.\n\nAssembling troops to go loop the loop include:\n\nTom Cruise – Major Cage\n\nEmily Blunt – Rita\n\nBill Paxton – Master Sergeant Farell\n\nBrendan Gleeson – General Brigham\n\nExtra-terrestrial types (known as Mimics), address everyday boredom by launching an invasion on Earth.\n\nBattle armour is developed to prepare for Operation Downfall as full metal bitch Rita Vrataski becomes a symbol of war for various victories at Verdun.\n\nEnter com"
