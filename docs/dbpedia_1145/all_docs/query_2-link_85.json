Following the Great Implosion of ’83, as the Age of Atari crumbled, game console and software sales tanked and American industry and retail alike closed the cofﬁn lid on the video game as a viable entertainment format and shoveled on the dirt. In their heart of hearts, after all, most American retailers and even many executives within the industry itself had always viewed the video game boom as a fad. Throughout the entire mid–’80s, the only place most Americans played electronic games was on computers or at the arcades. And the only games the computers offered were coin-op derivatives or text (and later illustrated and even animated) RPGs and adventure games. For most Americans, video games were now perceived as the carrot-on-thestick gateway to the computer-in-every-household world that many people thought would take place 20 years before it actually occurred. But the Japanese never lost faith. Japanese coin-op manufacturers had, in many ways, helped create the second generation American video game boom (i.e., the Age of Atari) with games like Space Invaders and Pac-Man and they saw no diminution of interest among Japanese gamers.\n\nSimultaneously, a phrase was beginning to permeate the world of seven-disk computer games, intolerable delays in loading new content, the incredible range of power among even the same company’s microcomputers as well as a labyrinth of audio and video augmentation boards that made system/software compatibility an issue in every purchase (“I can buy this really cool-looking game, but it’s going to play like crap on my computer. If it plays at all.”). Then there was the question of whether software publishers should be making “games” at all, when they could concentrate their efforts on the more academic-sounding “simulations.” And all of it took that phrase from a murmur to a command. That phrase was plug ’n’ play. The old joys of ripping a plastic-encased game board directly out of the box, putting it into your game system and seeing it on the TV suddenly acquired a nostalgic appeal. Moreover, computer gaming was, and remains, a socially isolated experience. Online play has long allowed computer gamers to test their skills against gamers in remote locations, but the key word there was “remote.” People began to remember how much fun it had been to play against their brother, sister, parents, and friends head-to-head in the most comfortable room in the house on a TV screen that was almost certainly larger than your computer monitor.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nF OREWORD\n\nBY\n\nAll of these things converged when Nintendo brought its Nintendo Entertainment System (complete with a dorky robot that was eliminated from the system with appropriate swiftness) and Sega introduced its Sega Master System to America. Video games were once again embraced as part of a lifestyle, as ﬁxed a member of the pop cultural pantheon as pop music, movies, and comic books. There will be good years and bad years, we realized, but the idea of the video game itself as a staple of popular entertainment was here to stay. The Nintendo/Sega (and later Sony) era revolutionized the concept of what you could do with video games. Elaborate, action-driven adventures joined the video game landscape and the platform and scrolling shooter genres became the dominant categories. After all, the Nintendo/Sega era redeﬁned the nature of gaming by transitioning gamers from a joystick-driven, one or two action button para-\n\nB ILL K UNKEL digm to the “joypad,” an interface that all but demanded an endless diet of platformers. For the ﬁrst time, the idea of multiple action buttons (direction was now controlled with the left hand via the directional joypad) and the timing required in pushing them became the driving force behind most games of this period. Movement was largely conﬁned to North-EastSouth-West commands and the trick was in perfectly timing a jump over a ravine or onto a mushroom. The Nintendo/Sega (and later Sony) era taught us to once again love video games and, to this day, Nintendo and Sony remain the world’s most successful producers of video game hardware. So take a stroll back through the mid and late ’80s, when a new voice and a new culture took back the right to enjoy video games. Take it away, Brett...\n\nBill Kunkel (AKA The Game Doctor) and his partner Arnie Katz “invented” video game journalism in Video magazine in 1978 and then, with Katz and Joyce Worley, created Electronic Games in 1981. Kunkel has designed games, consulted, written numerous game strategy books, and served as an expert witness in much of the industry’s seminal litigation. His memoirs, Confessions of the Game Doctor, were published in 2006, and he’s a regular columnist at J2Games.com.\n\nP REFACE The year 1984 was a bad one for the U.S. home video game industry. No new consoles were released in 1984 (or in 1983, for that matter), and the Atari 5200 and ColecoVision, which had seemed so fresh and innovative in 1982, were (or already had been) abandoned by their manufacturers, not to mention most of their owners. The ubiquitous Atari 2600 was still being produced, but it was increasingly obvious that the antiquated system was a primitive relic of another time. Atari was losing money by the bucketful, prompting Warner Communications to sell the company. INTV rescued the aging Intellivision from oblivion in 1984, keeping it aﬂoat until 1991, but sales of INTV games barely registered a blip on the consumer radar. What had once been a thriving industry, boasting gross sales of $3.2 billion in 1982, was on the verge of extinction. As fate would have it, a Japanese outﬁt called Nintendo (which began in 1889 as a playing card manufacturer) was more than eager to save the proverbial day. In 1985, the company test-marketed their Nintendo Entertainment System (called the Famicom in Japan) in select locations in New York City and released it nationwide in early 1986, giving birth to the next generation of home video game consoles. Bolstered by the legendary launch title Super Mario Bros., which fascinated consumers with its expansive gameplay, delightful audio/visuals, and plethora of secrets and surprises, the Nintendo NES captured the collec-\n\ntive consciousness of a nation and quickly supplanted the Atari 2600 as the system that the general public most frequently associated with video games. Nintendo put the U.S. home video game market back on the map, and the industry has been going strong ever since (despite such intermittent misﬁres as the Panasonic 3DO and the Philips CD-i). I got my very own NES, along with its killer app (Super Mario Bros., of course), in August of 1987 as a birthday present from my older brother. Before the year was up, I added such quality titles as Castlevania, Contra, Ikari Warriors, Ghosts ’n Goblins, Double Dribble, and The Legend of Zelda to my NES library. I was thrilled with the NES, but still kept my favorite system —the ColecoVision—hooked up to my 19-inch television set, which sat on a desk in my bedroom. Despite the advances made by Nintendo, I still enjoyed the simple pleasures of munching dots, climbing ladders, and shooting descending armadas of alien invaders that the ColecoVision, Atari 2600, and other older systems offered. (The NES was home to a number of retro arcade ports, such as BurgerTime, Galaga, and Ms. Pac-Man, but the emphasis was deﬁnitely on the newer, more elaborate games.) As biased toward the ColecoVision (and other outdated systems) as I was, I had to admit that the NES games were vastly superior in many ways, especially in terms of graphics, controls (the NES D-pad was a huge improve-\n\n3\n\n4\n\nP REFACE\n\nment over previous joysticks and control discs), and the epic nature of the games. Playing such adventure titles as Metroid and The Legend of Zelda was a liberating experience when compared to the relatively conﬁning nature of most games for previous consoles. I found myself powering up Nintendo’s gray box with increasing frequency, spending hours upon hours hopping on monsters, jumping across treacherous chasms, beating up bad guys, battling bosses, completing objectivespeciﬁc levels, playing relatively realistic basketball and hockey, and undertaking comparatively complex missions, many of which revolved around rescuing the proverbial damsel in distress (usually a princess). The NES revitalized my interest in home video games in general, spurring me to purchase the inevitable consoles that followed, such as the Sega Master System (1986), the Sega Genesis (1989), and the Super Nintendo (1991). Games like Shinobi (Master System), Sonic the Hedgehog (Genesis), and Super Mario World (Super NES) offered new worlds to explore, new challenges to conquer, and new shelves to build (for my increasingly large library of games). Unlike many gamers, simply buying a new game, playing it to death, and then getting rid of it wasn’t enough for me. I wanted to keep each cartridge (along with its accompanying box and manual), especially the games that I thoroughly enjoyed. To me, building a good library of video games is akin to having a nice collection of books or movies. You never know when the urge might hit to revisit (or share with a friend) an old favorite, be it Orwell’s 1984, Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or Shigeru Miyamoto’s Super Mario Bros. (The fact that Miyamoto is not a household name underscores the relative infancy of and the lack of respect accorded to the video game industry when compared to books and movies.) Over the years, I have amassed countless video game cartridges and more than 40 game consoles, and I’ve always wanted to do something with that collection beyond simply playing the games. I enjoy reading about video games, but there aren’t a whole lot of books on\n\nthe subject (compared to various other commercially viable pop culture art forms), especially in terms of literate, comprehensive, thoroughly researched reference guides. To help ﬁll that gap, I wrote a book called Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide (McFarland, 2007), which chronicled every video game console released during that time, plus all the cartridges for those systems, regardless of the release dates of those cartridges. That book covered what I (and certain other historians) call the golden age of home video games, which includes such consoles as the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and ColecoVision. The book you hold in your hands picks up where the ﬁrst volume left off. Classic Home Video Games, 1985–1988 covers the three systems released during that proliﬁc era, plus all the games produced for those systems regardless of the release date. Included is every U.S.–released game for the Nintendo NES, the Sega Master System, and the Atari 7800. Those of you who read the ﬁrst volume of Classic Home Video Games know I included the 7800 in that book (since it was a throwback to earlier systems, and since it completed the “trilogy” of classic Atari consoles), but I have updated it for the present work, expanding most of the entries and adding newly relevant information, such as comparisons to similar NES and Master System titles. As with the ﬁrst volume, this book is designed to be a video game version of a classic American movie guide, directing readers to the games they may enjoy. Each entry describes the gameplay in detail and includes pertinent data for that title, and most entries contain critical analysis. The review elements reﬂect my opinions, of course, but I tried to remain as objective as possible when considering the merits (or lack thereof ) of each game. When possible (and when relevant), I compared the games to their arcade, computer, and other-console counterparts. In addition to exhaustive entries for each game, the book includes a foreword by the legendary Bill “The Game Doctor” Kunkel, who co-founded Electronic Games Magazine, which basically invented the concept of video game\n\nP REFACE journalism, along with many of its mediumspeciﬁc terms and phrases. As a teenager, I read each and every issue of Electronic Games from cover to cover, marveling over the publication’s high-gloss photos, colorful screen shots, and entertaining, informative articles. If someone would have told me when I was 15 that someday Bill Kunkel would be writing the introduction to a book I had written, you could have knocked me over with a cathode ray. In preparing Classic Home Video Games, 1985–1988, I played (and replayed) hundreds of games, usually at night. And the next morning (oftentimes as early as three), fueled by a strong, hot cup of Earl Grey (which I started drinking and quickly became addicted to after watching Captain Picard order it time and again from the food replicator on Star Trek: The Next Generation), I would write about the games I had played the night before. I researched each title extensively, using a variety of resources, most notably my own collection. Since most game cartridges for older systems found “in the wild” and even at game stores lack instruction manuals (despite the already extensive nature of my collection, I had to purchase and borrow lots of games during the writing of the book), I consulted websites (primarily Atari Age and Nintendo Age) that contain scans of said manuals. In addition, certain websites offer game downloads, which were especially helpful when it came to cartridges that I couldn’t get my hands on. Skeptical modernists may wonder why in the world someone would want to play (or read about, for that matter) games from the increasingly ancient 1980s (and early ’90s), when today’s consoles, such as the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii, offer vastly superior graphics and sounds. There’s the nostalgia factor, of course, but one of the most important reasons lies in dimensions. With the exception of certain handheld titles (such as New Super Mario Bros.), puzzlers (such as the countless Tetris iterations), and download-only games (such as the decidedly retro Mega Man 9), twodimensional gaming has largely become a lost art, alienating many of us who grew up in a 2D virtual world. Entire genres, such as the sidescrolling shooter and the side-scrolling plat-\n\n5\n\nformer, have all but disappeared, prompting fans of those types of games to look to consoles of the past. Many modern titles beneﬁt tremendously from 3D graphics (playing Halo or Resident Evil in 2D would be unthinkable, for example), but old-school 2D games are generally more demanding, especially in terms of timing and precision of movement. Players are forced to make difﬁcult jumps (or other maneuvers) and face hordes of hard-to-avoid enemies with alarming frequency. One-hit deaths are commonplace, and it is often necessary to battle the same boss or retry the same level many, many times before ﬁguring out the correct pattern or developing the proper skill set required to defeat that boss or level. In short, older games are frequently more challenging and more intense than newer ones, at least in terms of quick reﬂexes and pure eyehand coordination. Certain modern titles are terribly difﬁcult (Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox, anyone?), but they are the exception to the rule. Classic games are generally more simplistic in design as well, meaning there are fewer button combinations to hassle with and fewer hoops to jump through in learning how to play the games. Another appeal of classic gaming is the assortment of titles that reﬂect the zeitgeist and are likely to never be remade or ported to a current console, such as Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker, Pete Rose Baseball, and Bill & Ted’s Excellent Video Game Adventure. More important, many of the older games are still a heck of a lot of fun. Thanks to eBay auctions, video game conventions (such as the Classic Gaming Expo and the Oklahoma Video Game Exhibition), and console emulators (such as the Nintendo Wii’s Virtual Console, which lets players download games for the NES, Master System, and other antiquated systems), gamers of all ages are hopping aboard the classic video game bandwagon with increasing frequency, discovering the thrills and inevitable spills two-dimensional gaming has to offer. In addition, countless classic systems are still hooked up to television sets across the country, letting veteran gamers hang on to an important part of their youths. Instead of simply remembering the “good old days,”\n\n6\n\nP REFACE\n\nvideo gamers have the advantage of reliving them again and again. Classic Home Video Games, 1985–1988: A Complete Reference Guide pays tribute to those classic games by cataloging and describing each\n\nand every one of them in detail, mainstream hits and obscure oddities alike. Hopefully, the book makes for entertaining reading as well, for both casual fans and hardcore gamers.\n\nA TARI 7800 The Atari 7800 ProSystem was a solid upgrade over the 2600 and the 5200, both of which were great consoles, but had a number of increasingly obvious shortcomings. By 1986, when the 7800 hit store shelves, the 2600 was drastically outdated (blocky graphics just wouldn’t cut it anymore), and the aging 5200, which had fragile, non-centering joysticks that were the subject of much derision, had ceased production in 1984. When the 7800 hit the scene, gaming traditionalists were thrilled with the system’s trio of launch titles, which included Joust, Ms. Pac-Man, and Asteroids, the latter of which offered a new wrinkle on the old rock-shooting formula: two-player simultaneous action. Pole Position II, a less impressive port, was the pack-in game with the system. Unfortunately for Atari apologists, the wildly popular Nintendo NES had launched in the U.S. the year before, ushering in the next generation of home gaming. The dynastic NES boasted the vaunted Super Mario Bros., one of the best, most inﬂuential games in the history of the industry, and the console would soon become the home of such groundbreaking titles as Metroid and The Legend of Zelda. The 7800, though blessed with nice retro arcade ports and a number of other interesting titles (such as Midnight Mutants), simply couldn’t compete with the Nintendo juggernaut. The NES saw vastly superior marketing and third-party support, and its cartridge library contained a plethora of games that were expansive in na-\n\nture and advanced in terms of both gameplay and graphics. The 7800 also had to compete with Sega’s Master System. Theoretically, the Atari 7800 could have launched in 1984, since it had been designed and tested by that time. However, former Commodore executive Jack Tramiel had bought the video game and computer divisions of Atari from Warner Bros. in 1984, and, for a variety of reasons, shelved the 7800 until 1986, after the NES had already staked an enormous claim on the market. It’s been reported that Tramiel preferred computers over consoles, that he was skeptical until he saw the money Nintendo was bringing in, and that he had some licensing issues to work out. Whatever the case, the 7800 made it into stores a couple of years too late. In addition, the system was hindered by Atari’s continued support of the 2600, and by the confusing introduction of the Atari XE console, which played cartridges designed for Atari’s line of home computers. The Atari 7800 is a powerful, graphically capable system that can handle lots of moving objects at once with little to no slowdown or ﬂickering. Also, it is backwards-compatible with the Atari 2600, meaning it can play most of the games in the 2600 library. On a less positive note, its sound capabilities are comparable to 2600 audio, and many gamers complain about the system’s controllers, which are sturdy (compared to Atari 5200 joysticks), but tiring on the hands. The side buttons are thumb-\n\n7\n\n8\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nAtari 7800 console with two joystick controllers. Though home to some nice ports of classic arcade games, such as Asteroids and Centipede, the 7800 couldn’t compete with the NES, which boasted such cutting edge titles as Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda.\n\nkillers when lots of continual pressing is required. The system is compatible with any Atari 2600 joystick, but only for one-button games. Production of the Atari 7800 came to a halt in 1991, and the system left with the reputation of an underachiever. Given an earlier release date, more marketing support, and more console-deﬁning games, the 7800 could have challenged Nintendo on a more even playﬁeld. Unfortunately, that just wasn’t meant to be.\n\nAtari 7800 Games Ace of Aces PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Flight Combat Simulator, 1 player. 1988.\n\nThis ﬁrst-person game puts players in the World War II–era Royal Air Force, piloting a RAF Mosquito through the not-so-friendly skies, shooting or bombing U-boats, JU88\n\nbombers, ME 109 ﬁghters, and V1 rockets. Players view the action through ﬁve different screens, including from directly below the plane. The relatively complicated gameplay includes: loading up the plane with missiles, bullets, and fuel canisters; operating a variety of plane controls (thrust, engine speed, altitude, ﬂaps, boost, and the like); putting out engine ﬁres; navigating through or around storms; consulting intelligence reports; and more. The cockpit controls look great, and there are plenty of things to do for the patient gamer. The controls are sluggish (the computer versions of the game beneﬁt from keyboard control), and the action moves slowly, but Ace of Aces is superior to Tomcat F-14, F-18 Hornet, and Super Huey (similar games for the 7800).\n\nAlien Brigade PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Light Gun Shooter, 1 player. 1990.\n\nAlthough Alien Brigade is light gun compatible, it can also be played using a standard\n\nA TARI 7800 Atari 7800 controller. Players point the gun at (or guide a cursor around) the screen, shooting such targets as aliens, brainwashed soldiers, helicopters, tanks, and spaceships while trying not to harm mermaids, panthers, civilians, and other innocents. Gamers begin with a singleshot, semi-automatic pistol, a ﬁve-burst automatic machine gun, 100 48-round clips of ammunition, and eight grenades. However, each scenario offers more weapons (some of which are hidden), including rockets, a ﬂamethrower, a laser riﬂe, and a dart gun. Levels to blast through include: Deep Jungle Camp, South American River Resort, Underwater, Alien Cave Base, and Main Alien Cave Base. There are lots of things to shoot, but the action sometimes experiences slowdown when the screen gets too busy. The rapid-ﬁre gameplay is fastpaced, and the detailed graphics feature some nice animations, such as aliens dissolving after being shot. Alien Brigade is the sequel to Planet Smashers.\n\nAsteroids PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Non-Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1986.\n\nAsteroids for the Atari 7800 is a brilliant port/upgrade of Atari’s 1979 arcade smash. The game controls about like the 2600 version (push joystick left and right to rotate ship, push forward to thrust), but includes a number of features that make it stand out, such as textured, colorful, spinning asteroids that evoke the space rocks found in Blasteroids (arcade, 1987). More importantly, the game has a couple of awesome two-player modes: Competition Asteroids and Team Asteroids, the latter of which lets friendly ﬁre pass harmlessly through the players’ ships. Arcade purists may scoff at the raster visuals (the coin-op classic had blackand-white vector graphics) and the joystick controls (the original beneﬁted from a ﬁve-button layout), but open minded shooter buffs will absolutely love this game. Asteroids for the 7800 lacks the Asteroids Deluxe–like shields feature found in the Atari 2600 version, but the twoplayer action more than makes up for this relatively minor absence. Asteroids was also ported\n\n9\n\nto the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Followed by two enhanced remakes: Asteroids (PlayStation) and Asteroids Hyper 64 (Nintendo 64).\n\nBallblazer PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Sports/Futuristic, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1987.\n\nBallblazer for the Atari 7800 improves upon the 5200 version by providing sharper graphics (the ships and ball have smoother edges) and better controls. For the uninitiated, the game is essentially futuristic, one-on-one soccer, but with hovercrafts (called Rotofoils) instead of players and moving goalbeams instead of standard goals. The ﬁrst-person, pseudo–3D action is set in 3097 on the luminous surface of an artiﬁcial asteroid, which is a green, 1155-square grid surrounded by an electroboundary. The split-screen perspective (featuring a panoramic viewpoint), dazzling sounds, and excellent two-player action have truly stood the test of time. Followed by: Ballblazer Champions (PlayStation).\n\nBarnyard Blaster PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Light Gun Shooter, 1 player. 1988.\n\nThis mediocre light gun shooter has nice graphics and a fun setting, but little else going for it. Players take aim and ﬁre at bottles, cans, gophers, watermelons, pumpkins, rabbits, ducks, chickens, owls, and other targets across four levels of play: The Barnyard, The Cornﬁeld, The Barn, and Gramps’ Bonus Screen, the latter of which features an old man redundantly throwing bottles into the air. Some gamers may get a mischievous kick out of shooting Gramps himself. Moving targets, which appear onscreen just one at a time, only travel in straight lines and are easy to hit, making Barnyard Blaster a rather dull shooter. One thing that does help is that smaller, faster targets are worth more points. Also, hitting targets quickly scores more points. At the end of the game, players are ranked (with names like Total Dud, Red Neck, Sniper, and Terminator) according to how many screens they completed.\n\n10\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nBasketBrawl PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Sports/Basketball, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1990.\n\nThis rowdy game of two-on-two basketball lets players shoot hoops and ﬁght on three different courts: Street, Junkyard, and Rooftop, each of which features the typical elevated side-view perspective. The referee, Scott “The Blade” Savage, is outﬁtted with a knife (that he throws at players) instead of a whistle, emphasizing the no-rules gameplay. Players can punch and even throw the ball at one another, and this irreverent take on the sport is as fun as it sounds. There are six different players from which to choose and three power-ups to grab for enhanced strength, speed, and power. Gamers can team up against the computer or play competitively. Injured players are not replaced, forcing some highly entertaining twoon-one situations. The working title for BasketBrawl was “Hoop Wars.” Also released for the Atari Lynx.\n\nCentipede PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Non-Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating, simultaneous). 1987.\n\nNow this is the way to adapt a coin-op classic to a home system. Like the oft-ported arcade game (Atari, 1980), Centipede for the 7800 provides fun-ﬁlled shooting action for gamers of all persuasions (Centipede was one of the only shooters of the era with a large female following). The mushroom ﬁeld looks great (despite being surrounded by an unnecessary border), the controls are smooth (despite the lack of trackball control), and all the original creatures and other elements are in place (nitpickers will notice that the spider has just four legs). Plus, 7800 fans are treated to a system-exclusive two-player simultaneous mode, which lets gamers cooperate or compete. The cooperative mode displays individual scores, plus a cumulative total that gives players a real sense of teamwork. The competitive mode, in which players shoot at each other (in addition to the creatures and mushrooms), adds a whole new strategy to the formula. Mil-\n\nlipede, which was the sequel to Centipede, was ported to the NES and Atari 2600, but not the 7800. Centipede spawned an enhanced remake for the PlayStation and Dreamcast.\n\nChoplifter! PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Ibid. SideScrolling Shooter, 1 player. 1987.\n\nUnlike the Atari 5200 version of Choplifter!, which was a port of Dan Gorlin’s Apple II computer game (1982), the 7800 rendition appears to be a translation of Sega’s 1985 arcade classic. Unfortunately, it is missing the surfaceto-air missiles of the coin-op game (something the superior Master System version retains), as well as the fuel factor and digitized voice effects. Worse, the game simply ends after 64 POWs have been rescued or killed. Despite these insufﬁciencies (and despite Atari 2600– like graphics and sounds), the game remains enjoyable to some degree, thanks largely to Gorlin’s original formula, which has players piloting a chopper back and forth across the screen, ﬁring a machine gun at and dropping bombs on tanks, jet ﬁghters, and drone air mines, making sure to rescue and transport the aforementioned POWs whenever they appear along the ground. Followed by: Choplifter II (Game Boy) and Choplifter III (Game Boy, Game Gear, SNES).\n\nCommando PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Sculptured Software. Vertical Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1989.\n\nA ﬁne port of the Data East arcade game (1985), Commando for the 7800 has players guiding a Rambo-like character through hostile territory, shooting bullets and ﬁring grenades at enemies and their jeeps, dynamite trucks, motorcycles, and pillboxes. There are POWs to rescue as well. The screen is frequently busy with enemies and obstacles (trees, rivers, ponds, bunkers, and the like), so the action stays hot and heavy most of the time. Thanks to the inefﬁciently designed 7800 controller, this can cause the player’s hands to get tired and cramped, but the fun gameplay is worth the fatigue. The graphics have taken a\n\nA TARI 7800 slight hit, and the characters are smaller than their coin-op counterparts, but these small gripes (so to speak) shouldn’t keep anyone away from playing this great game. Four difﬁculty levels are included. Fans of Front Line and Ikari Warriors will feel right at home with Commando. Also released for the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and NES.\n\nCrack’ed PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. First-Person Shooter, 1 player. 1988.\n\nCrack’ed is a potentially interesting game with a fatal ﬂaw. Players guide a cursor around the screen, ﬁring a slingshot at bluebirds, owls, ﬁsh, ghosts, snakes, aliens, and other creatures that are raiding the nests of rare South American hornbills. If a creature does pick up an egg, that creature can be shot, and the egg can be caught and carried back to the nest. There are ﬁve nesting sites: Tree, Sewer, Sea, Dungeon, and Moon. There are also Rooster Ranch stages, in which players throw eggs at roosters that pop up from behind nests. The game sports a fun concept and nice visuals (the variety of creatures and settings is especially impressive), but it lacks light gun support. As a result, the cursor moves jerkily around the screen, making it hard to aim. When compared to the Atari 2600 version (which was released by CGE Services at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo), Crack’ed for the Atari 7800 has more levels (six instead of two) and more types of enemies (15 instead of six).\n\n11\n\nand Castle Hall are missing from the Atari 2600 version, which is not light gun compatible). Plus, there’s a confrontation with the dreaded Evil Master. The objective is to keep a group of friends safe as they walk (from left to right) through the aforementioned areas by basically acting as a sniper. Naturally, the high resolution graphics found in the arcade game have been toned down a bit (the color palette is smaller, for example), but the visuals still look fantastic.\n\nDark Chambers PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Maze Shooter/Adventure, 1 or 2 Players (simultaneous). 1988.\n\nA slower, less enjoyable take on the formula established by the arcade classic Gauntlet (Atari, 1985), Dark Chambers has players exploring 26 scrolling, maze-like dungeons, gathering treasure while using guns, daggers, and bombs to destroy surprisingly non-aggressive wraiths, skeletons, wizards, grim reapers, and spawners, the latter of which hatch new ghouls. Traps and poisons should be avoided, but potions (for increasing strength), keys (for entering secret rooms), hearts (which can revive the player’s dead partner), and shields should be picked up as needed. To exit a dungeon, players should ﬁnd and enter that level’s escape hole. Dark Chambers was also released for the Atari 2600, but the 7800 version has better graphics and more detailed mazes.\n\nDesert Falcon Crossbow PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Light Gun Shooter, 1 player. 1988.\n\nPUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Side-Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 Players (alternating). 1987.\n\nOne of the most impressive arcade ports in the Atari 7800 library, Crossbow is based on the 1983 Exidy coin-op semi-classic, which is imbued with a faux crossbow controller for taking aim at the ghosts, witches, frogs, dragons, alligators, slime monsters, archers, pterodactyls, and other enemies. The 7800 version uses light gun support to nice effect and includes eight colorful, richly detailed levels: Desert, Caverns, Volcano, Jungle, Village, River, Drawbridge, and Castle Hall (Village\n\nSometimes referred to as “Zaxxon in the sand,” Desert Falcon has a number of things in common with Sega’s arcade classic, primarily its isometric viewpoint and faux 3D graphics. The shooting action is similar as well, but Desert Falcon is enhanced by a spiffy power-up system involving combinations of three hieroglyphs that give players invincibility, air bombs, decoy powers, and more. Unfortunately, grabbing the power-ups requires walking, which interrupts the action. Another ﬂaw is that it’s\n\n12\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\ndifﬁcult to tell where the player’s arrow-shooting falcon is in altitudinal relationship to the enemies, making for some unnecessary deaths. On a more positive note, players must confront a very nicely rendered Sphinx at the end of each level. Other enemies include vultures, warrior phleas, scarabs, ﬂying ﬁsh, and phantom gliders. Killing ﬂying enemies increases the base value of treasures. Desert Falcon was also released for the Atari 2600, but the 7800 version has better graphics and less sluggish gameplay.\n\nDig Dug PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Maze, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1987.\n\nThis port of the Atari/Namco coin-op classic (1982) isn’t perfect, but it comes about\n\nas close as could be expected on a system of the era. The graphics are slightly blocky, the title screen has been altered, and the ﬂowers and scoreboard don’t look quite right, but the characters are a nice, colorful upgrade from those found in the Atari 5200 version of the game. More importantly, the game plays extremely well, and all the details (such as the bonus vegetables) are included. Players guide the title character as he strategically digs underground tunnels, blowing up (with a pump) or dropping rocks on two types of strange looking enemies: Pookas and Fygars, the latter of which breathe ﬁre. Bottom line: Dig Dug for the Atari 7800 is a very nice translation of one of the greatest arcade games of all time. Also released for the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and Game Boy. The sequel, Dig Dug II (arcade, 1985), was ported to the NES. Followed by: Dig Dug: Digging Strike (Nintendo DS).\n\nDonkey Kong PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: ITDC. Climbing, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1988.\n\nDark Chambers and Desert Falcon were also released for the Atari 2600, but the 7800 versions have superior graphics and sounds.\n\nJust like the NES version of the game, Donkey Kong for the Atari 7800 is missing the Conveyor Belt screen and the animated intermissions. Coin-op faithfuls will notice some relatively minor deﬁciencies in the graphics as well, such as only two barrels (as opposed to four) standing by Donkey Kong in the ﬁrst screen. Where the game really drops the ball is in the sound effects and music, which are terribly grating. Instead of squeaking, Mario’s patented shoes make an obnoxious, Atari 2600–like sound, and the memorable theme song is entirely absent. Also, the designers put the levels out of order. Coleco did Donkey Kong (which is based on Nintendo’s 1981 arcade classic) about as well six years earlier for their ColecoVision system.\n\nA TARI 7800 Also released for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision. Remade for the Game Boy.\n\nDonkey Kong Junior PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: ITDC. Climbing, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1988.\n\nAs in Donkey Kong for the 7800, Donkey Kong Junior has off key music, good graphics that could have been a little better, and sound effects that incorporate way too many bleeps, bloops, and buzzes. Also, the screens are out of order. However, unlike Donkey Kong, this game includes all four original levels and even a little animation sequence after the ﬁnal screen. Both Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Junior are solidly playable arcade ports, but their ﬂaws are noteworthy. For a better port of DKJ, try the NES version, which has tighter controls, superior sounds, and smoother, more polished graphics. Based on Nintendo’s 1982 coinop classic. Also released for the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and ColecoVision. Followed by: Donkey Kong 3 (arcade, NES), Donkey Kong Country (SNES, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance), Donkey Kong 64 (Nintendo 64), and numerous other sequels and offshoots.\n\n13\n\nrocks, oil drums, and crates. The enemies are very aggressive in this version, making for a tough game to beat. Unlike the superior (in most ways) NES rendition, the 7800 game, like the Master System port, does incorporate the arcade classic’s standard two-player simultaneous mode (the NES game compensates for this in some small fashion with a one-on-one ﬁghting mode). Double Dragon, which was ported to various other systems, such as the Atari 2600, Atari Lynx, and Neo Geo, spawned a number of sequels, including Double Dragon II: The Revenge (arcade, NES).\n\nF-18 Hornet PUBLISHER: Absolute Entertainment. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Flight Combat Simulator, 1 player. 1988.\n\nDouble Dragon PUBLISHER: Activision. DEVELOPER: Imagineering. SideScrolling Combat, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1989.\n\nBased on Taito’s 1987 arcade hit, Double Dragon for the 7800 has four levels of play, just like in the original. Gamers control Billy or Jimmy Lee as they walk, jump, punch, and kick their way through City Slums, Industrial Areas, Outskirts of the City, and The Enemy Base of the Shadow Boss. Unfortunately, the graphics are fairly blocky, the various moves are hard to pull off, and certain weapons are missing, including dynamite,\n\nAtari 7800 renditions of two Nintendo coin-op classics, Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Junior, each pictured with box, instruction manual, and cartridge.\n\n14\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nF-18 Hornet puts players in the U.S. Navy, piloting a ground attack ﬁghter jet. Four missions take gamers over the China Lake Naval Weapons Range in the Mojave Desert, through the middle of a Warsaw Pac invasion of Europe, and to Central America and the Indian Ocean. Objectives include dropping supplies to resistance forces, bombing enemy headquarters, ﬁring missiles at planes, tanks, and helicopters, and more. The controls are relatively simple, and the plane lacks machine gun ﬁre. The cockpit control panel depicts an air speed indicator, an engine thrust gauge, an altimeter, a fuel gauge, and other relevant instruments. Despite nice graphics (especially the landscaping and cockpit), F-18 Hornet doesn’t do a very good job of making the player feel like he or she is actually ﬂying a plane. Similar to: Ace of Aces, Tomcat F-14, and Super Huey.\n\ngives players 12 humorously rendered (and named) boxers from which to chose, each of whom has his own strengths and weaknesses. Fighting moves are limited to jabs, body blows, fakes (useless), and guarding maneuvers (mostly useless), making the game a simple button-masher. Disappointingly, even though the boxers have special moves, only the computer-controlled boxers can pull them off. The ﬁghters look pretty good, but poor animation, a lack of backgrounds, spotty collision detection, and shoddy sound effects ruin the experience. Fight Night is the only 7800 boxing game, so it’s too bad it’s not a better representation of the sweet science. Armchair pugilists with affection for this era of gaming should stick with Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! for the NES.\n\nFood Fight Fatal Run PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Sculptured Software. Demolition/Combat Racing, 1 player. 1990.\n\nPUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Action, 1 or 2 Players (alternating). 1987.\n\nFatal Run is sort of like Pole Position (or Pole Position II, for that matter), but with a post holocaust theme and the ability for players to destroy the cars they are trying to pass. Powerups and weapons include machine guns, dynamite, shields (for temporary protection), death crystals (which allow players to crash into cars unscathed), rockets, oil, smoke, and nitro (for increasing acceleration and gas mileage). Players can also effect repairs and purchase car parts. The game takes place over 32 levels and, thankfully, a password feature lets players save their progress (a rarity for a 7800 game). Interestingly (not to mention disturbingly and amusingly), at the end of each level, several onlookers explode, the number of which depends on how fast the player has completed the course.\n\nA very nice port of Atari’s highly entertaining arcade game (1983), Food Fight for the 7800 has players guiding gluttonous Charlie Chuck (who starts off on the right side of the screen) around a non-scrolling playﬁeld, avoiding manholes, angry chefs, and ﬂying food items. The goal is to make it to an ice cream cone (which is positioned on the left side of the screen) before it melts. Luckily, Charlie can throw spinach, salads, tomatoes, pies, watermelons, and other food items at the chefs (named Angelo, Zorba, Oscar, and Jacques), who remain in constant pursuit. The graphics and concept in general are simplistic (in a good way), the action is fast and fun, and the theme lends itself well to humor (just watch Charlie as he opens wide to gulp down his ice cream). Food Fight was only ported to the 7800, giving owners of the system some much-needed bragging rights.\n\nFight Night\n\nGalaga\n\nPUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Imagineering. Sports/Boxing, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1988.\n\nPUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Slide-and-Shoot, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1986.\n\nA slow, clunky port of the Commodore 64 game (1986), Fight Night for the Atari 7800\n\nA semi-satisfactory port of Namco’s awesome arcade shooter (1981), Galaga for the\n\nA TARI 7800 Atari 7800 features solid shooting action, respectable sound effects, enemies that behave like their coin-op counterparts, and, thankfully, challenge stages and dual-ship action (the two deﬁning aspects of the original game). On a less positive note, the player’s ship is too small, the graphics have lost some of their crispness and color, the stage indicator badges have been replaced by simple numbers, and the action has been slowed down a little. Despite these weaknesses, Galaga is a nice addition to the 7800 library, especially since the game never made it to the 2600 or the 5200. For a more accurate port, fans should pick up Galaga: Demons of Death for the NES. Galaga spawned numerous sequels and offshoots, including Gaplus (arcade), Galaga 3 (arcade), Galaga ’90 (Turbografx-16), and Galaga: Destination Earth (PlayStation).\n\n15\n\nTradewest arcade game. One or two players trudge through the jungle (which includes rivers, the sea, and bombed-out buildings), shooting or throwing grenades at soldiers, bunkers, helicopters, tanks, and gates. Powerups, fuel, and extra ammo can be picked up along the way. As in Front Line (arcade, ColecoVision) players can occasionally commandeer tanks. The ultimate goal is to rescue the colonel at the end of the last level. The coinop version of Ikari Warriors boasts rotary controls for aiming in all directions, but the 7800 joysticks do a respectable job in this regard. In addition, the arcade game has forced scrolling, which is gone from this version. When compared to the better looking NES rendition, the 7800 game has better controls, a distinct lack of glitches, and faster, fairer gameplay. Also released for the Atari 2600. Similar to: Commando.\n\nHat Trick PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Ibid. Sports/Hockey, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1987.\n\nThis simple hockey title is a faithful port of the Bally Sente arcade game from 1984. Viewed from an overhead perspective, the twoon-two action pits one goalie and a skater against another goalie and a skater. The goalies, which are basically human Pong paddles, move in sync with their skaters, and the skaters, which can steal the puck, simply shoot in the direction the joystick is pushed. After each twominute game, a Zamboni machine cleans up the mess. The controls in Hat Trick seem to have a bit of a delayed reaction, but the programmers may have purposely included this perceived ﬂaw to emulate skating on ice. Hockey hounds and fans of the sport in general will want to stick with Blades of Steel for the NES. Pong purists will want to check out Video Olympics for the Atari 2600.\n\nIkari Warriors PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Imagineering. Vertical Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 Players (simultaneous). 1989.\n\nDespite uneven visuals, Ikari Warriors for the Atari 7800 is an excellent port of the 1986\n\nImpossible Mission PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Man Development Corp. Adventure/Non-Scrolling Platform, 1 player. 1987.\n\nImpossible Mission for the 7800 would’ve been a good adaptation of the puzzling computer game if it weren’t for one fatal ﬂaw. The objective is to search a bunch of rooms to ﬁnd 36 card key pieces for use in making nine card keys that can unlock Professor Elvin Atombender’s secret lair. Riding elevators, jumping over obstacles, avoiding robots, and solving puzzles are all part of the action. Unfortunately, some of the pieces are hidden under computer terminals that cannot be searched, literally making the already tough game an impossible mission. The ﬂaw was corrected for the PAL format foreign release, but that didn’t do much for American gamers who had wasted their time trying to ﬁnd unreachable items. Consoles gamers wanting a similar experience without such a ﬂaw should pick up Impossible Mission II for the NES.\n\nJinks PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Softgold. Balland-Paddle, 1 player. 1989.\n\nJinks is a disappointing game that tried to\n\n16\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nimprove upon the brick-busting formula pioneered by Breakout by introducing hyperspace, chomping teeth, a space age theme, a screenshake feature for freeing the ball from repetitive patterns (which is not a bad idea, actually), four horizontally scrolling playﬁelds, and a triangular paddle that moves freely and can be inverted. Regrettably, sluggish gameplay, a distinct lack of challenge, and primitive audio/ visuals (voice effects notwithstanding) ruin the experience. The storyline, which is purely superﬂuous, involves a renowned Star Fleet pilot getting attacked while researching (and then trying to escape from) a “lush, resource-rich world.” For a better Breakout-inﬂuenced game, players should try Arkanoid (arcade, NES).\n\nJoust PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Non-Scrolling Platform, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1986.\n\nJoust for the Atari 7800 is an admirable port of the 1982 Williams arcade classic, in which players ﬂy a mounted ostrich around the screen, destroying buzzard riders by bumping into them from above (even slightly above gets the job done). The 7800 game features several details that the 5200 version left out, including the engine-like roar of enemies at the beginning of each level and the buzzards that ﬂy in to pick up the riders that hatch from eggs (in the 5200 game, eggs simply hatch into riders that that are already mounted atop buzzards). There is one setback regarding the 7800 controller, however, since pushing the side button again and again to keep the mounted ostrich aﬂoat can get tiresome. To remedy this, players can simply plug in a 2600 joystick. Or play the NES version, which has better controls and more detailed characters. Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari Lynx. Followed by: Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest (arcade). Similar to: Balloon Fight (NES).\n\nKarateka PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Ibid. Side-Scrolling Combat, 1 player. 1988.\n\nJoust and Dig Dug typify the Atari 7800 library: nice arcade ports of retro favorites.\n\nOriginally a computer game, Karateka for the 7800 lost something in translation. Players guide a karate expert through six levels of one-on-one ﬁghts against palace guards, punching and kicking (high and low) their way to victory. There are two stances: one for running and one for ﬁghting. Unfortunately, victory is hard to achieve, thanks to a one-life setup and horrible, unresponsive, counterintuitive controls. The computer versions beneﬁt from keyboard input, but there’s no excuse for how poorly the 7800 rendition handles. Also, the graphics seem adequate at ﬁrst glance, but then the characters start moving, thus revealing the game’s choppy animation. The mission, for those unfortunate souls who chose to ac-\n\nA TARI 7800 cept it, is to save Princess Mariko from the clutches of an evil warlord named Akuma.\n\nKlax PUBLISHER: ResQsoft Productions. DEVELOPER: Atari. Action Puzzle, 1 player. 2002.\n\nKlax for the Atari 7800 was programmed during the mid–1980s, but was never ofﬁcially released until the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. The cartridge was produced in limited quantities and includes a box, instructions (reprinted from the Atari 2600 manual), and a bonus pamphlet containing an interview with the game’s programmer. Gameplay is highly faithful to Atari’s 1989 coin-op classic, with players lining up descending (on a conveyor belt) tiles in rows, columns, and diagonals, trying to line up three or more tiles of the same color to remove them from the screen (combos are worth extra points). Players catch each tile on a paddle and can drop it into position below, hold onto it (temporarily), or hoist it back up to the conveyor belt. Letting too many tiles get past the paddle ends the game. Missing are the voice effects (the sounds in general are poor in this version) and the two-player split screen mode (which did make the cut in the NES rendition), but crisp controls and graphics make the game a worthwhile port. Also released for the Atari Lynx, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Gear.\n\nKung-Fu Master PUBLISHER: Absolute Entertainment. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Side-Scrolling Combat, 1 or 2 Players (alternating). 1989.\n\nBased on the 1984 Data East arcade classic, which was one of the earliest beat-’em-up games, Kung-Fu Master has players walking, jumping, punching, and kicking their way through ﬁve levels of henchmen, knife throwers, midgets, dragons, snakes, killer moths, and other enemies. At the end of each level, a boss, such as Stick Fighter or Boomerang Thrower, lies in wait. The game takes place in the Evil Wizard’s temple, where players must rescue Princess Victoria. The mummy ninjas from the ﬁfth level of the arcade game are missing, as is the introductory story sequence. Predictably,\n\n17\n\nthe graphics and sounds have also taken a downturn. However, the real problem with the game is clunky controls as speciﬁc moves are hard to pull off with the stiff 7800 joysticks. At least the 7800 version doesn’t eliminate jump kicks like the Atari 2600 rendition. Released for the NES as Kung Fu.\n\nMario Bros. PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: ITDC. NonScrolling Platform, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1988.\n\nIn Mario Bros., players guide the titular Nintendo mascot as he walks over and under water pipe platforms, bumping with his head the ﬂoors beneath creeping, crawling shellcreepers (turtles) and sidesteppers (crabs) in order to knock them over. Then, Mario must jump up to that level to kick the fallen creature(s) off the screen. There are also hopping ﬁghterﬂies, roaming ﬁreballs, and sliding slipice to contend with, the latter of which can freeze ﬂoors, making them slippery. Although not as faithfully reproduced as the near-perfect NES version, Mario. Bros. for the 7800 does feature all the elements that made Nintendo’s 1983 coin-op classic great, including the essential two-player simultaneous mode (in which the second gamer controls Mario’s brother, Luigi). It even has some of the details that the Atari 5200 rendition missed, such as the screen after the bonus round in which the coins collected are shown on display. Nitpickers will notice that the 7800 version does play a bit fast. Also released for the Atari 2600.\n\nMat Mania Challenge PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Sports/Wrestling, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1990.\n\nInspired by Taito’s Mat Mania (1985) and Mania Challenge (1986), Mat Mania Challenge boasts lots of moves typical of the genre, including ﬂying kicks, hammer throws, pile drivers, overhead slams, punches, kicks, atomic drops, and more. Fancier moves reward players with higher scores, but simple buttonmashing works pretty well. The game looks okay, but lacks the outrageous personality and\n\n18\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nraucous nature of “real” pro wrestling (though the wrestlers can climb posts). Also, gameplay feels like ﬁghting the same guy again and again, unlike in the aforementioned arcade games, which feature such distinctive wrestlers as Insane Warrior, Hurricane Joe, and Golden Hulk. The elevated view of the ring is from the side, with a crowd looking on. Similar to: Pro Wrestling (NES).\n\nMean 18 Ultimate Golf PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Sports/Golf, 1 or 2 Players (alternating). 1989.\n\nThis hard-to-ﬁnd golf game gives players a solid (if unspectacular) video rendition of the popular sport. To hit the ball, players follow\n\nthe standard three-tap system, which controls the power of the shot and determines whether the ball hooks, slices, or goes straight. Trees, sand traps, water, and other obstacles dot the 18-hole Pebble Beach course, which features a nice variety of layouts. When putting, the game switches from a behind-the-golfer perspective to an overhead view, and players must take into account which way the greens break. Mean 18 Ultimate Golf is based on Accolade’s Mean 18 computer game (1986), which boasts multiple courses and a course editor (elements lacking in the 7800 version).\n\nMeltdown PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Light Gun Shooter, 1 player. 1990.\n\nIn Meltdown, players must protect the reactor cores of 20 different nuclear power plants that have been sabotaged by terrorists. This is done by aiming the light gun at the screen and shooting ﬁve different types of “sparkx” that bounce off walls and off a reactor core that is positioned in the middle of the playﬁeld. There are also power crystals to shoot, which can repair control rods, double the size of the shots, give the gun continual ﬁre, and more. Meltdown has some nice features (including a password system) and inventive ideas (missed shots create temporary barriers), but the screen annoyingly blinks with every shot ﬁred, and the gun isn’t very accurate. Players willing to overlook these shortcomings will ﬁnd something to enjoy, as will fans of Reactor (a somewhat similar Atari 2600 game).\n\nMidnight Mutants Although the Atari 7800 didn’t have a light gun of its very own, Meltdown and Barnyard Blaster were compatible with the XG1 light gun, which was packaged with the Atari XE game system. The XG-1 was sold separately for the beneﬁt of 7800 owners.\n\nPUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Radioactive Software. Adventure, 1 player. 1990.\n\nThe closest thing the Atari 7800 has to a Legend of Zelda–\n\nA TARI 7800 type of adventure game, Midnight Mutants consists of 10 atmospheric, highly detailed areas to explore, including a mansion, a church, a graveyard, and a pumpkin patch. Each area is teeming with zombies, vampires, bats, mutant bosses (including Dr. Evil), and other killable monsters. The goal is to save Grampa Munster (yep, the one from The Munsters television show), who is being held at Plasmic Prison. Fortunately, Jimmy, the character players control, can pick up a number of helpful items, including a knife, a cross, an axe, a blaster, a key (for entering the crypt), diamonds (to increase Jimmy’s health), and more. Regrettably, there is no password feature for saving progress, and control is a bit awkward, thanks to the isometric perspective and Jimmy’s inability to walk diagonally. However, awesome graphics and sounds, nonlinear gameplay, and a fairly unusual concept make the game a worthwhile entry in the 7800 library.\n\n19\n\nformation found in the instruction manual: “To save wear and tear on your thumb, strap a rubber band around the joystick button that controls acceleration for long play sessions.”\n\nMs. Pac-Man PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Maze, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1986.\n\nThe lipstick on Ms. Pac-Man’s famous mug is about all that’s missing in this stellar port of Midway’s 1981 arcade classic (which improved upon its predecessor, Pac-Man, by featuring four mazes, faster gameplay, moving fruit, and smarter enemy A.I.). The title character’s round edges are a little jagged (making the NES versions look more polished), and the\n\nMotorPsycho PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Motorcycle Racing, 1 player. 1990.\n\nMotorPsycho has been called a motorcycle version of Pole Position II, and that’s a pretty good description of the game. There are four different tracks comprised of winding roads, vehicles to pass, and roadside signs to avoid crashing into. Also, the vehicle has two speeds (high and low), and the objective is to get through each course as fast as possible. Sound familiar? One thing that separates MotorPsycho from Pole Position II is the fact that the player’s vehicle can score extra points by jumping over enemy bikes, arrow signs, cones, and ramps. Also, the roadways in MotorPsycho are hilly at times. The game’s title is misleading, however, as there is nothing really psychotic about the game, other than the following bit of in-\n\nTwo excellent Atari 7800 ports of arcade classics: Ms. Pac-Man, the world-famous maze game, and Xevious, the highly inﬂuential vertical scrolling shooter.\n\n20\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nplayﬁeld is square (as opposed to rectangular) to accommodate the shape of most television screens, but these are small complaints. Unlike the coin-op classic (or the NES versions), this rendition lets players select the starting level, meaning anyone can jump straight to the banana screen. In addition, the pre-game animation introducing the ghosts by name is intact (a feature missing in the NES versions). Also released for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Genesis, and numerous other systems. Followed by: Pac-Man Collection (Game Boy Advance), PacMan Fever (PS2, GameCube), Pac-Man World 3 (various), and numerous other sequels and offshoots.\n\nNinja Golf PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Sports/Golf/Side-Scrolling Combat/ First-Person Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1990.\n\nA highly original creation, Ninja Golf combines three different genres to come up with one very good game. The golﬁng aspect is simplistic, since all players really do is aim, judge the distance, and hit the ball. The ﬁghting action\n\nis basic as well, consisting primarily of running, jumping, and kicking. After the ball is hit, the ninja runs to the ball, encountering gophers, frogs, ninja guards, water hazards (which include sharks), sand traps (which include snakes), and other enemies and obstacles along the way. Helpful items to pick up include throwing stars, magic shields, warps, and more. When the ball gets to the green, there is no putting. Rather, players hurl ninja stars at a dragon. This graphically impressive, ﬁrst-person scene is reminiscent of the shurikenthrowing bonus rounds in Shinobi.\n\nOne-on-One Basketball PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Man Development. Sports/Basketball, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1987.\n\nThis is a complete, ﬁnely programmed port of the popular computer game (which was simply called One-on-One) starring NBA superstars Dr. J. and Larry Bird. The controls take a little getting used to thanks to the stiff 7800 joysticks, but the game has smooth animation, a nicely rendered hardwood ﬂoor, and some entertaining one-on-one hoops action. Players can steal, rebound, shoot threepointers (Bird is the better outside shooter, naturally), charge, travel, get fatigued, dunk the ball (Dr. J is the superior dunker, of course), and more. On a particularly vicious dunk, the backboard will shatter, prompting an angry ref to come out and sweep up the broken glass. Excellent sound effects accompany this amusing scene. Also released for the ColecoVision (as One-on-One). Followed by: Jordan vs. Bird: One on One (NES, Game Boy) and Jordan vs. Bird (Genesis).\n\nPete Rose Baseball\n\nThree Atari 7800 sports games: Hat Trick, One-on-One Basketball, and RealSports Baseball, each pictured with box, instruction manual, and cartridge.\n\nPUBLISHER: Absolute Entertainment. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Sports/Baseball, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1989.\n\nDespite slightly sharper graphics and a better color scheme,\n\nA TARI 7800 Pete Rose Baseball for the Atari 7800 is disappointingly similar to the Atari 2600 version of the game, and one should expect more from a next-generation system. Also, though it plays a good game of America’s favorite pastime, and it’s superior to the 7800 version of RealSports Baseball, the inﬁeld defense in Pete Rose Baseball could use some ﬁne tuning. Sometimes the player closest to the ball can’t reach it, forcing gamers to switch to another inﬁelder who must come all the way over to help. Like its 2600 counterpart, the game features an onscreen umpire and catcher, cheering fans, the ability to move around in the batter’s box, a warning track, a fence the ball can bounce off of, and six camera angles (including a behind-thepitcher perspective).\n\nPlanet Smashers PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Vertical Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1990.\n\nThe prequel to Alien Brigade, Planet Smashers has players defending Earth from alien invaders. Despite the familiar concept, the game does have a couple of original aspects: the need to shoot colored-coded warp capsules in order to progress to the next level; and an Earth shield that gets a little weaker with every enemy that gets by the player’s starship. Once the shield is gone, the game ends, even if there are starships in reserve. Basic gameplay involves moving a ship around the bottom third of the playﬁeld, shooting ﬁghters, bombers, rammers, and alien cargo vessels while catching cargo (weapon power-ups, a cloaking device, and shield restoratives) as it falls from destroyed alien ships. The bosses are impressive in appearance, but the rest of the game looks pretty ordinary. The sound effects are limited, and the shooting action is tiresome on the thumb, thanks to the 7800’s side-button joysticks. The end of the game is basically an advertisement for Alien Brigade.\n\nPole Position II PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Formula-1/Indy Racing, 1 player. 1986.\n\n21\n\nPole Position II, in which players speed down twisting, turning streets (from a behindthe-car perspective), passing other cars while avoiding crashing, is one of the weaker arcade ports in the Atari 7800 library, which is unfortunate since it was the pack-in game with the system. It’s not as fast or as exciting as Atari’s 1983 arcade classic, the explosions aren’t as intense, the cars don’t look as cool or as colorfully detailed, and the action isn’t as smooth. It’s far too easy to accidentally down shift (the programmers should have utilized the second ﬁre button as the gear shift instead of the joystick), and the steering wheel from the coin-op classic is greatly missed. On a more positive note, the game does include nicely detailed mountain ranges and all four original racetracks: Test, Fuji, Seaside, and Suzuka. Interestingly, the billboards have been changed to Atari symbols, and the “Qualify for Start” ﬂag that ﬂies across the screen at the beginning of the game has been altered to “Prepare to Qualify,” which was the wording in the original Pole Position.\n\nRampage PUBLISHER: Activision. DEVELOPER: Spectral Dimensions. Action, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1989.\n\nRampage for the Atari 7800 has fewer colors and is less sharp visually than the overrated Bally Midway coin-op classic (1986), but it does include all the enemies and items. In addition, it keeps the essential two-player mode intact (though the three-player mode is missing), and it plays about the same (with the one drawback being the poorly designed 7800 controllers). Players guide giant monsters George the Ape, Lizzie the Lizard, or Ralph the Wolf (who is missing from the NES version of the game) as they climb buildings, smash buildings, eat people (and other items), grab money, and punch helicopters, trolleys, boats, police cars, and tanks. In all there are 132 cities to destroy (the NES version has 128 cities while the SMS game has 50 levels spread over 10 cities). The view is from the side, and the action moves at a slow pace. Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari Lynx. Followed by: Rampage World Tour (various), Rampage Through Time (Play-\n\n22\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nStation), Rampage Puzzle Attack (Gameboy Advance), and other sequels and offshoots.\n\nRealSports Baseball PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Sports/ Baseball, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1988.\n\nAn improvement (but not a signiﬁcant leap) graphically over the 2600 and 5200 versions, RealSports Baseball for the Atari 7800 is a decent looking, nicely animated game with solid controls. It features bunting, eight pitching variations (including fast balls, curves, change-ups, and sliders), and high, low, and normal swings of the bat. However, it does contain a few ﬂaws that put it in league with the 2600 rendition, namely poor ﬁelding, uneven base-running, and lousy sound effects. Also, playing the computer is brutal, especially since there are very few areas of the ﬁeld to safely hit the ball. Gamers should stick with the superior 5200 version. On a historical note, the RealSports line of games was originally introduced to compete with Mattel’s Intellivision sports games, which were generally much more sophisticated than their Atari 2600 counterparts. The RealSports moniker stuck when it was time to create sports titles for the 5200 and 7800.\n\nRobotron: 2084 PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: General Computer Corp. Non-Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1987.\n\nRobotron: 2084 for the 7800 would be an acceptable port of the 1982 Williams arcade classic if it weren’t for a couple of key setbacks. Unlike the superior Atari 5200 version of the game, which was packaged with a special dual controller holder, the 7800 rendition expects players to somehow hold both controllers at once (or perhaps ﬁt the controllers together with tape, rubber bands, or by some other method). The game is playable with one controller, but this hardly evokes the coin-op experience, as gamers must shoot the way they are moving. Also, it is impossible to shoot while standing still. On a less important note, the graphics aren’t quite as colorful, and the sound effects aren’t quite as busy. Gamers who\n\nhave never played the coin-op classic will get some enjoyment out of the inherently intense action, in which a man runs around the screen, shooting hordes of evil robots and rescuing innocents. However, arcade rats need not apply. Also released for the Atari Lynx. Followed by: Robotron X (PlayStation) and Robotron 64 (Nintendo 64).\n\nScrapyard Dog PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Side-Scrolling Platform, 1 player. 1990.\n\nThe closest thing the Atari 7800 has to Super Mario Bros., Scrapyard Dog is the type of side-scrolling platform game that was extremely popular during the late ’80s and early ’90s. Players guide an ugly, big-nosed guy named Louie through six rounds (17 levels in all) of junkyards, cities, and sewers, jumping on or throwing cans or bombs at gangsters, rats, birds, and other enemies. There are some tricky jumps and lots of obstacles, meaning the shields players can acquire (and store up) do come in handy. Bonus rooms throughout the levels contain mini-games, and there are shops for purchasing super cans, extra lives, and other helpful items. Scrapyard Dog is a must-have for 7800 devotees since it’s the only game of its type for the system, but the lead character lacks the charisma to be considered a console mascot. Mario, Sonic, Bonk, and Alex Kidd have it all over Louie.\n\nSentinel PUBLISHER: ResQsoft Productions. DEVELOPER: Imagineering. Light Gun Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 2002.\n\nIn Sentinel, players must protect a large orb as it glides across the surface of four different alien planets, each of which contains such backgrounds as buildings and mountains. This is done by shooting the various enemies (rings, tubes, stars, cubes, satellites, hover crafts, and the like) that attack the titular orb. Players can also ﬁnd power-ups, including super shots (smart bombs that explode when the orb is shot), energy pods (which circle the orb), and movement (which increases the orb’s vertical speed). When an enemy is killed, the orb absorbs\n\nA TARI 7800 the resultant energy and grows larger. The protection-oriented gameplay of Sentinel evokes Crossbow, but it’s not as good or as well known as that arcade classic. Originally available only in PAL format (Europe and elsewhere), Sentinel was released in NTSC format (U.S. and Canada) by ResQsoft, the company responsible for rescuing the Atari 7800 version of Klax from prototype-only status.\n\nSummer Games PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Epyx. Sports/ Olympics, 1–8 players (alternating, 2-player simultaneous). 1987.\n\nA good looking, nicely playing port of the popular computer game, Summer Games for the Atari 7800 lets players compete in six different Olympic events: Diving, 4 × 400-Meter Relay, 100-Meter Dash, Gymnastics, Freestyle Relay, and 100-Meter Freestyle. Some events require precise timing while others demand that players jiggle the joystick back and forth as fast as possible for increased velocity. All are fun, especially when competing head-to-head against another player (up to eight players representing any of 18 different countries can enter, but only two appear onscreen at once). Unlike the 2600 version, the 7800 rendition does not include Rowing or Skeet Shooting. However, a variety of graphical upgrades, including enhanced opening ceremonies, make these omissions fairly easy to overlook. The sequel, Summer Games II, was only released for computers.\n\n23\n\nin the computer simulation to land, change altitude, control pitch, load and arm missiles, and other such maneuvers. The joystick and ﬁre buttons work ﬁne, however, in Arcade Mode, which has players simply guiding a cursor around the screen, shooting enemy helicopters. Reality Mode is a combination of Arcade Mode and Flight School, the latter of which is more trouble than it’s worth for all but the most patient and most dedicated of ﬂight sim fans. The instrument panel in this complicated game depicts ammo supply, radar screen, fuel gauge, rpm readout, compass heading, oil pressure, and more. Fans of Tomcat: The F-14 Flight Simulator may want to give Super Huey a whirl. The sequels, Super Huey II and Super Huey III, were only released for computers.\n\nSuper Huey PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Flight Combat Simulator/First-Person Shooter, 1 player. 1988.\n\nThis port of the Cosmi computer game suffers from the lack of keyboard control, which is used\n\nSummer Games and Winter Games for the Atari 7800, each pictured with box, instruction manual, and cartridge. Both titles include various Olympic-style sporting events.\n\n24\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nSuper Skateboardin’ PUBLISHER: Absolute Entertainment. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Sports/Skateboarding/Side-Scrolling Platform, 1 player. 1988.\n\nUnlike 720°, Skate or Die, and most other skateboarding titles, this cartridge doesn’t feature any actual skating moves, such as aerials, rail slides, or hand plants. What Super Skateboardin’ does have are coffee makers, projectors, radios, TVs, computers, and light bulbs to turn off, the latter of which require jumping in order to reach. The building players skate through is a maze of rooms connected by doorways, elevators, escalators, and air ducts, and it’s easy to get turned around. Gamers with a good sense of direction can memorize the routes and item locations after repeated play, but the action doesn’t offer enough long-term fun to warrant that kind of attention. The graphics are colorful, and the sound effects are varied, but the there’s nothing particularly “rad” about the game, other than its use of the now outdated term on the box. Designed by David Crane of Activision fame.\n\nTank Command PUBLISHER: Froggo. DEVELOPER: Froggo. Vertical Scrolling Tank Shooter, 1 player. 1988.\n\nPlayers commandeer an XT-87 attack vehicle in Tank Command, one of the harder to ﬁnd games in the 7800 library. The objective is to capture the enemy ﬂag, which is a mere three levels away. The game is short, but the difﬁculty level amps up in a hurry, making for an uneven gaming experience. Piloting the tank is a dangerous job since the terrain is covered with pillboxes, heavy artillery, camouﬂaged traps, anti-tank weapons, and other obstacles. Players can blow up missile silos, ammo and fuel dumps, buildings, huts, and other items for extra points, and it’s important to refuel when necessary. The pink color scheme is off-putting, but the game has sufﬁcient graphical detail. Tank Command is marginally enjoyable, but fans of vertical scrolling war games should stick with Commando or Ikari Warriors.\n\nTitle Match Pro Wrestling PUBLISHER: Absolute Entertainment. DEVEL-\n\nOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Sports/Wrestling, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1989.\n\nA graphical upgrade over the 2600 version of the game, Title Match Pro Wrestling for the 7800 nevertheless suffers from the same horrible, needlessly convoluted control technique in which players alternate between “joystick mode” and “button mode.” Simple punches and kicks are the easiest, most effective moves since airplane spins, power lifts, rope dives, back drops, bear hugs, and other fancy maneuvers are a chore to pull off and deplete the wrestler of energy. When the wrestler gets pinned or bear hugged, the player can jiggle the joystick quickly to try and escape. Modes of play include One on One and Tag Team Match, the latter of which is more enjoyable (though that’s not saying much). The side-view perspective shows a ring, an audience, a camera man, and an overhead scoreboard. Fans of the sport should stick with Pro Wrestling for the NES.\n\nTomcat: The F-14 Flight Simulator PUBLISHER: Absolute Entertainment. DEVELOPER: Absolute Entertainment. Flight Combat Simulator, 1 player. 1989.\n\nDesigned by Dan Kitchen (of Activision fame), Tomcat: The F-14 Flight Simulator is a complex game in which players must launch (from the ﬂight deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise) and land the titular craft, engage in combat missions (using a computer defense system, machine guns, and three types of missiles), and monitor a variety of instruments (including fuel, altitude, wing angle, and speed). During night ﬂights, players must rely even more on the elaborate instrumentation, especially in combat situations. This cartridge is an updated, more graphically detailed (especially in terms of the cockpit control panels) version of the Atari 2600 game of the same name, but with enemy bogeys that are harder to engage, making for a less enjoyable experience. Similar to: Ace of Aces, Super Huey, and F-18 Hornet.\n\nTouchdown Football PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Imagineering. Sports/Football, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1988.\n\nA TARI 7800 The only gridiron game available for the 7800, Touchdown Football is ﬂawed almost to the point of being unplayable. The six-on-six action offers plenty of plays to select from (nine formations and three blocking schemes), and the ﬁeld and players look pretty good. However, ﬁeld goals are all but impossible to make, the animation is choppy, the action moves much too slowly, and rushing is limited to the quarterback running the ball. The player on defense always controls the free safety. Interestingly, there’s only one cheerleader on the sideline, and she looks as though she may have had one too many shots of testosterone. The view of the action is from an elevated side perspective, with the screen scrolling left and right (only 25 or so yards of the ﬁeld are visible at any given time).\n\n25\n\npulling a water skier through three mediocre looking levels (Obstacle Slalom Run, Shark & Alligator Main Course, and High-speed Death Run) of rocks, piers, tree stumps, enemy boaters, and other obstacles, some of which, annoyingly enough, are hidden. There are ramps to jump, and the faster the player makes it through the course, the higher their score. The game ends after the third level, but it’s very difﬁcult to get there, thanks in part to frustrating controls that take lots of time getting used\n\nTower Toppler PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Climbing, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1988.\n\nDerived from the computer semi-classic Nebulus, Tower Toppler is a good looking, highly unusual game in which players guide a frog up stairs, up elevators, across platforms, and over gaps in order to reach the top of eight different smoothly rotating towers. The frog is equipped with snowballs for destroying bouncing cannonballs and ﬂashing blocks, but the rest of the enemies and obstacles, which include evil robots, mutant molecules, ﬂying eyes, and rolling cannonballs, are indestructible. Certain jumps must be timed perfectly, and some ﬂoors will vanish, making for a frequently frustrating experience. However, the game has a certain quality that virtually forces players to stick with it until they have at least reached the top of two or three towers. Between each level there’s a side-scrolling bonus round in which the frog hops in his sub and stuns and catches ﬁsh. The NES version, which is called Castelian, is similar, but with different bonus rounds in which the frog hops on clouds and gathers gems.\n\nWater Ski PUBLISHER: Froggo. DEVELOPER: Froggo. Sports/Water Skiing, 1 player. 1988.\n\nThis vertical scrolling game has players maneuvering a boat up the Pharonna River,\n\nTower Toppler for the Atari 7800, complete with box, instruction manual, and cartridge. The version that was produced for the Game Boy and NES is called Castelian.\n\n26\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nto. The ﬁre buttons move the skier right and left while the joystick operates the boat, which is a setup that is hardly intuitive. Water Ski is one of the harder to ﬁnd (not to mention harder to play) games for the Atari 7800.\n\nWinter Games PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Epyx. Sports/Olympics, 1–8 Players (alternating, 2player simultaneous). 1987.\n\nThis nicely realized port of the popular computer game lets players compete in four Olympic events: Speed Skating (side-view twoman race); Ski Jump (points earned for distance and style); Bobsled (viewed from behind); and Biathlon (cross-country skiing and riﬂe shooting). The game plays very well and is loaded down with graphical detail, but it’s missing the Luge, Slalom, and Hot Dog events found in the 2600 version, as well as Figure Skating from the Commodore 64 game. The lavishly produced opening ceremonies do a great job of getting players in the spirit of things, but it’s too bad there are no closing ceremonies. It would’ve been nice to watch the contestants accepting their medals.\n\nXenophobe PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: BlueSky Software. Platform Shooter, 1 or 2 players (simultaneous). 1989.\n\nDespite the lack of a three-player mode and the fact that gamers can only control Mr. M. Brace (as opposed to one of nine different characters), Xenophobe for the Atari 7800 is a nice port of the 1987 Bally Midway arcade game (which was undoubtedly inspired by the Alien ﬁlms). Players walk, crawl, crouch, and jump their way through nine different space stations,\n\nhitting and shooting (with a phaser) critters, pods, tentacles (the ﬂoor-based tentacles from the arcade game are missing), rollerbabies, and snotterpillars. There are weapons (laser pistol, electric riﬂe, poofer gun, grenades) and bonus point items (such as skulls and screwdrivers) to pick up and elevators to ride. Some may ﬁnd the going a bit slow, but the two-player split screen mode (which actually lets gamers play at the same time, unlike the Atari 2600 version) will please most anyone looking to mindlessly kill some aliens. Also released for the Atari Lynx and the NES, the latter version of which is disappointingly bland.\n\nXevious PUBLISHER: Atari. DEVELOPER: Atari. Vertical Scrolling Shooter, 1 or 2 players (alternating). 1987.\n\nXevious is an extremely accurate port of the 1982 Atari arcade game. The playﬁeld has been shortened (the score and number of ships remaining appear at the top of the screen), and the blaster targeting sight is closer to the ship, meaning players have to get dangerously close to ground-based targets before they can shoot them. However, the sound effects are about 90 percent accurate, the graphics are nicely emulated, and the much-maligned 7800 joysticks are perfectly designed for the action. Also, scrolling is smooth, and the game handles lots of onscreen activity with seeming ease. There are more than 20 different types of enemies to shoot, and players can select from four difﬁculty levels. Nitpickers will notice that the ground-based targets don’t blink like they do in the coin-op classic and in the NES version. Xevious spawned two sequels: Super Xevious (arcade) and Xevious 3D/G+ (PlayStation).\n\nN INTENDO NES In 1984, the Japanese company Nintendo, which had achieved tremendous success in the arcades with Donkey Kong (1981), approached Atari about distributing the American version of their popular Famicom system in the United States. For a variety of reasons (which Steven L. Kent details in his indispensable The Ultimate History of Video Games), the prospective deal with Atari failed, and Nintendo took it upon itself to test market their Americanized Famicom (dubbed the Nintendo Entertainment System) in New York City in 1985, leading to a nationwide release in 1986. Initially, due to the fabled Great Video Game Crash of 1983/1984, U.S. retailers were wary of carrying a new video game system. Wisely, Nintendo marketed their brainchild as more than just a simple game console, packaging the deluxe version of the NES with a mechanical Robot Operating Buddy (R.O.B. for short) and a Zapper light gun (for use with Duck Hunt and other target games). They called their video game console an “entertainment system” and referred to its cartridges as “game paks.” The aforementioned marketing ploy was useful in getting the Nintendo NES on to store shelves, but the true success of the system, at least initially, can be attributed to a little sidescrolling platformer called Super Mario Bros., which astonished grizzled gamers and video virgins alike with its rich colors and sounds, cartoonish graphics, lengthy levels, freedom of\n\nmovement, and hidden secrets and surprises. Those who grew up on comparatively primitive previous consoles, such as the Atari 2600 and the ColecoVision, were truly mesmerized by Super Mario Bros.’ epic nature and expansive game play. Scores of other landmark Nintendo-brand NES games followed in the wake of Super Mario Bros., including Metroid and The Legend of Zelda, and the company began publishing the long-running Nintendo Power magazine in 1988. The NES hit its zenith in 1990 with the introduction of Super Mario Bros. 3. Released in conjunction with the feature ﬁlm The Wizard (1989), which was more or less an extended commercial for the game, Super Mario Bros. 3 sold more than 18 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling video game cartridge of all time. The Wizard also showcased the technically advanced Power Glove controller, a black and gray gauntlet that looked really cool and created a lot of buzz, but was extremely inefﬁcient and lacking in precision of movement when it came to actually playing games. Numerous third-party companies, such as Capcom, Jaleco, and Data East, got in on the NES act as well. In fact, Konami’s Contra and Castlevania are two of the most fondly remembered games ever released for the system. In a marginally successful attempt to keep thirdparties from cranking out lousy and/or unlicensed games, Nintendo had built a lockout chip into the console and forced third-party\n\n27\n\n28\n\nC LASSIC H OME V IDEO G AMES , 1985–1988\n\nA boxed Nintendo NES Control Deck, which Nintendo dubbed, “The Most Challenging Video Game System Ever Developed.”\n\ncompanies to pay substantial licensing fees in order to produce games for the console. In addition, third-party companies could only produce ﬁve games per year, a rule that certain companies circumvented by forming sister companies. Other companies, like Tengen and Sachen, bypassed Nintendo altogether by producing unlicensed games. Authorized game cartridges have an ofﬁcial Nintendo seal of approval (or seal of quality) on the packaging, but that doesn’t necessarily guarantee a great game (as owners of the dreadful Hydlide will attest). During its lifespan, the two-tone gray, boxy looking NES was a staple in homes across America, selling tens of millions of units before its ofﬁcial demise in 1995 (the last Nintendo-brand NES game, Wario’s Woods, was released in 1994). One of the best, most enduring things about the system is its sturdy, userfriendly controllers, which are rectangular in shape and feature an eight-way directional pad on the left, a select and a start button in the middle, and a pair of action buttons on the right. This design, which was patterned after Nintendo’s Game & Watch series of handheld\n\ngames, is vastly superior to controllers for previous systems, all of which have at least one overriding ﬂaw. Also cool are the two multiplayer adapters released for the console: the NES Satellite and the NES Four Score. No game system is perfect, and the Nintendo NES does have one notable setback: The console lacks durability. Dusty or heavily used cartridges can render the system unreliable by gumming up or otherwise making the intake port less than reliable in loading games. In addition, frequent usage can loosen the connector pins in the intake port, resulting in the loss of connectivity between the cartridge and the console. Finding a used system that works perfectly can be difﬁcult. Nintendo remedied this design ﬂaw in 1993 with the release of a toploading version of the console, but it was produced in small quantities and is therefore very hard to ﬁnd, often commanding $100 or more in today’s collector’s market. Along with the Atari 2600 and Sony’s original PlayStation, the Nintendo NES is one of the most important, most inﬂuential video game systems ever released. It is home to an as-\n\nN INTENDO NES\n\n29\n\nNintendo NES console with two controllers and Zapper light gun. Along with the Atari 2600, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2, the NES was one of the most popular video game systems of all time.\n\ntonishing number of revolutionary, genredeﬁning titles, and it popularized and expanded upon such concepts as beating levels, saving progress (via passwords or battery backup), and exploring vast, lavishly illustrated worlds. Most importantly, it revived (make that resurrected) the American home video game industry. Today, the NES remains a popular system among hardcore collectors and casual fans alike. For those who don’t want to bother with getting an original NES system and a bunch of cartridges, select NES titles are available for download via the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console, which is a phenomenon that has helped introduce a new generation of gamers to the distinct pleasures of retro gaming.\n\nNintendo NES Games Abadox: The Deadly Inner War PUBLISHER: Milton Bradley. DEVELOPER: Natsume. Side-Scrolling Shooter/Vertical Scrolling Shooter, 1 player. 1990.\n\nA challenging shooter that fans of Life Force and R-Type will enjoy, Abadox has players using a space ship to battle a giant creature named Parasitis, who feeds on life forms and planets. Players must survive the surface of the\n\ncreature, then blast their way down its throat and through its body, using lasers, guided missiles, and orbiting shields to destroy eyeballs, worms, skeleton ﬁsh, bacteria, anti-bodies, bosses, and other monsters. Power-ups to grab include super speed, an orbiting barrier shield, twin missiles, a laser gun, multi-directional beams, and more. When the action scrolls vertically, the ship travels downward, which is an unusual trait for the genre. Even more unusual (for the era) are the game’s gruesome, graphically rich visuals.\n\nAction 52 PUBLISHER: Active Enterprises. DEVELOPER: Active Enterprises.

SideScrolling Platform, 1 player. 1992.\n\nBased on the 1991 feature ﬁlm (which, in turn, was based on the 1960s television series and on the Charles Addams cartoon panels), The Addams Family for the NES stars many of the characters familiar to fans of the popular franchise, including Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Lurch (who plays music), and Thing (who acts as a shield). Gomez must rescue members of his family from various rooms of his house and the surrounding grounds, avoiding skulls, ghosts, spikes, and other creatures and obstacles (many of which fall very quickly) along the way. There are no weapons, but Gomez can jump on enemies, swim in a pond, paddle down a secret river, and collect\n\nmoney. The game has lots of atmospheric, richly illustrated areas to explore, plenty of tricky puzzles to solve (such as ﬁnding keys to open doors and using a potion to shrink Pugsley), and a nice musical score.\n\nThe Addams Family: Pugsley’s Scavenger Hunt PUBLISHER: Ocean. DEVELOPER: Ocean. SideScrolling Platform, 1 player. 1992.\n\nBased on the Addams Family cartoon series (Hanna Barbera, 1992–1995), The Addams Family: Pugsley’s Scavenger Hunt ﬁnds the chubby son of Morticia and Gomez Addams searching for members of his family (Gomez, Granny, Wednesday, and Uncle Fester), who have been kidnapped and hidden as prisoners in their own home. Each family member holds a piece of music that Lurch must play to unlock the secret passage leading to Morticia, and Thing is on hand to provide clues. Pugsley has no weapons, but he can jump on the various creatures that impede his progress. Pugsley can also crouch, climb, swim, and ﬂy (with the help of beanie caps). Pugsley’s Scavenger Hunt is much different than its SNES counterpart, in which Pugsley searches for items Wednesday\n\nN INTENDO NES has hidden around the Addams mansion. Interestingly, it plays more like The Addams Family (NES, SNES), but with Pugsley taking over for Gomez.\n\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons: DragonStrike PUBLISHER: FCI. DEVELOPER: Westwood Associates. Overhead View Free-Roaming Shooter, 1 player. 1992.\n\nDragonStrike for the NES eschews the ﬁrst-person elements of the computer version of the game, opting instead for free-roaming shooter action. Players guide one of three different dragons (bronze, silver, and gold) through 14 missions, ﬁring lightning bolts, ice balls, ﬁreballs, and other weapons at archers, battleships, carpet mages, giant dragonﬂies, swamp monsters, bosses, and other enemies. The dragon can ﬂy high to avoid certain obstacles, but must ﬂy low at times to complete various mission objectives. RPG elements are conspicuously absent, but there are power-ups to grab, and the game looks decent and is plenty challenging. Includes battery backup.\n\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance PUBLISHER: FCI. DEVELOPER: U.S. Gold/Strategic Simulations. Third-Person Action RolePlaying Game, 1 player. 1991.\n\nSporting real-time battles and a side-view perspective, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance for the NES is based on three things: the computer game of the same name (1988); the ﬁrst Dragonlance campaign module (Dragons of Despair); and the Dragonlance novel, Dragons of Autumn’s Twilight. Players, controlling one character at a time, guide a band of eight warriors and magic users of varying attributes and skills on a decidedly brief adventure quest. Enemies to battle include giant spiders, Gully Dwarves, ferocious dragons, monstrous Draconians, and more. Rightly dubbed one of the “10 Worst Games of All Time” in the September, 1997 issue of Nintendo Power, Heroes of the Lance suffers from lousy controls, sluggish game play, and a ﬂawed combat system. Includes battery backup.\n\n31\n\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons: Hillsfar PUBLISHER: FCI. DEVELOPER: Pony Canyon. Third-Person Action Role-Playing Game, 1 player. 1993.\n\nThis oddly segmented, narrative-deprived RPG lets gamers explore areas in and around Hillsfar, using a character created by the player. Characters are ranked according to strength, intelligence, dexterity, and other attributes that can be built up as the game progresses. Four character classes are available: ﬁghter, mage, thief, and cleric. Activities include searching secret rooms, stunning guards, ﬁnding exits, looting gold chests, avoiding traps, blasting obstacles with a rod, competing in Archery contests, using a horse to jump over obstacles, ﬁghting in an arena, gathering information in taverns, and more. Based on the computer game of the same name (1989), Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Hillsfar for the NES includes battery backup.\n\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance PUBLISHER: FCI. DEVELOPER: Pony Canyon. First-Person Role-Playing Game, 1 player. 1992.\n\nBased on the oft-ported computer simulation (1988), Pools of Radiance for the NES, like its personal computer counterpart, does an excellent job of maintaining the spirit and gameplay of the popular pen-and-paper game, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The text-heavy cartridge lets players create a party of up to six characters of differing races and classes. The characters are modeled after those found in actual D&D rules sets, and the battles, which display an isometric viewpoint, evoke those found in the AD&D edition of the Dungeon Master’s Guide book. In addition, the areas to explore are lifted from the Forgotten Realms campaign world. Includes battery backup.\n\nAdventure Island PUBLISHER: Hudson Soft. DEVELOPER: Hudson Soft.
