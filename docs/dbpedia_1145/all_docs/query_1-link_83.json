        "text": "SlasherMcGirk's 52 Games 2024\n\nGame 2 A Plague Tale: Requiem\n\nRelease Data: Year 2022\n\nPlatforms: PS5, Xbox Series, Switch and PC\n\nReview Score:\n\n5/10\n\nIt had been so long since I played the original title A Plague Tale: Innocence, so I watched a breif summary of the first game. My memory of it was that it was a pretty impressive title for an indie game and looked quite nice and while I liked the characters the game and story itself left a little bit to be desired. Requiem to me also fits that ball well despite the fact I just finished it. I can already tell I will feel the same way in a few years and a slight rememberance of disapointment.\n\nFor starters the game looks really great on the PS5. Much better than I thought it would even considering the past title. Enviroments really pop and the flora really stands out as being well done. Character models for the main cast look great and it runs pretty consistent but there are notable spikes and lag in stuff from afar. I can imagine it was not like this at launch though.\n\nThe gameplay of Requiem is very similar to the first. It doesn't really have \"combat\" per se. Well I guess technically you could argure it does but fighting enemies is not what the game wants you to do. In fact it's rather hard to kill all or any enemies in any given area. Instead I feel it's more like a stealth puzzle game that disguises it's self as having combat. It's more about resource gathering and mix alchemic potions to trick or lure enemies into areas so you can get around them. It's much much easier to play stealthy in this game as opposed to most games where using combat attacks and bum rushing it using raw skill. It's a decent pace breaker at the very least although I don't think the game does an exceptional job at it none the less. The majority of your time in Requiem is speant in slow walking sections as characters talk and comment about the situation they are in. Really no lie, this is the vast majority of what the game comprises of. There are other sections of the game where instead of avoiding enemies you have to figure out how to traverse a set peices while avoiding herds of rats that will instant kill you if they touch you. So then it becomes a puzzle of sort to try to light fires to give you space to move or even extinguish others to lure them in while you navigate a space. Sometimes it can be annoying when you are low on resourses and you are missing the one item pot that you need to make a break for it. The game is really paced like this. Forced walking section > rat maze > second rat maze > forced walking section > breif exploration > forced walking section > sneak section > sneak section again > forced walking section > cutscene and end chapter.\n\nWhen it comes to the story it is a continuation from the first game but honestly it is pretty easy to follow if you haven't played it outside of one or two details. This is kinda a journey game so there really isn't much twists or turns. Every story beat is easily expected and guessed. The only thing that really feels like any originality is really the ending. I will not spoil it but I really was not a fan of it. I don't think it was earned and it honestly hampered my mild enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe one thing I really did like was the performance of the voice actors and the characters in this game. The actress that did Amecia was really well done and Hugo was not nearly annoying at all despite him being a whiny child character. There were some great moments that really brought the voice work forward and made it stand out. Punished murderous Amecia is best Amecia The music was also really well done and really heighted some of the scenes. It's almost like the presentation of the game was really well done and every other ascpect of the game from gameplay, story and pacing was just an absolute slog. My second playthrough to cap off the last couple of trophies I didn't have was just the most boring second run of a game I think I can even remember. It was slow the first time around but the second time was agonizing.\n\nI don't know if the team is planning another one of these games but they would have to take it in quite an interesting direction to get me excited for it and overhaul the game play a bit. It was worth one go around to experiance it but it kinda feels like junk food gaming. Enjoyed it enough while having it but immeaditly got paines and remorse thinking back on it.\n\nPlatinum #201\n\nSlasherMcGirk's 52 Games 2024\n\nGame 3 Chronicles of 2 Heroes: Amatersu's Wrath\n\nRelease 2023 Platforms PS4, PS5, Xbox Series, Switch and PC\n\nReview Score5/10\n\nChronicles of 2 Heroes: Amaterasu's Wrath is an action platformer. It's almost a blend of shinobi with Ninja Gaiden. It's a pretty linear path from start to finish however there are some branching paths here and there that are locked by some abilities and or gold and you can warp back and forth to area's you have been. I wouldn't say it's open or a metroidvania as it still has a set level pattern and path.\n\n2 Heroes at it's core is all about it's two character swapping mechanic. You can switch characters instantly at the tap of a button at anytime, even in the middle of an action. You have one character you specializes in attack and defense, the samurai and one character that excells at mobility and ranged attacks, the ninja. Both have several weakness's and strenghts that you constantly have to be switching back and forth to progress. Like for example the samurai character can not jump at all but the Ninja can double jump. The samurai has a fast dash attack and is a boss killer. The ninja will be your main character for moving around. You have to solve rather complex platforming puzzles by combining the two quite often. Like for example jumping as the ninja only to swap to the samurai in mid air to dash across the screen to make a jump.\n\n2 Heroes's biggest strength is how well done the platforming puzzle utilize the character swapping mechanic. They do a lot with a minimal basic moveset and really make you think and switch on your feet. Do you know how long it took me to not get frustrated as the samurai to not be able to jump in a platform game? The other thing that really sticks out about 2 Heroes is the games difficulty. The game is tough. Real tough. Like one of the hardest platformers i've played in some time. We are talking like 9/10 on the difficulty scale. However the developers did grant us mercy. As a standard there are unlimited continues and check points are spaced out evenly enough. That and there is a built in \"assist\" mechanic. At anytime during the game you can hold a button and a little animal assisant will follow your character and grant you some buffs to your character to help while they are activated. For example the samurai is a little beefier, the ninja has an unlimited double jump and your health regenerates several health points every 30 secs. Trust me when I say this that if you are a casual platformer fan you are gonna wanna have these on. You are not punished by any means by using these and let me tell you unlimited jumps is a god send in this game.\n\nThere are some other things of note. This game is quite beefy. It's length plus the difficulty you could easily rack up some hours here. A perfect playthrough with assists on might take you 3-4 hours but a normal regular playthrough could take about 10-12 hours i'd imagine. Which is quite a lot for platformer. Wether this is a good thing or bad thing is up to you. For me it was more of a negative thing because it is coupled with the next thing I wanna talk about.\n\n2 Heroes is very repititve game. It has a lot of smart platforming and tricky puzzles with quick reflexes but my god do you see the same brainless enemies and puzzle scenario's over and over again. Enemies are nothing more than walking obsticles that really don't pose much threat but more to block your path or add to the complexity of the room. Nearly the entire game is a set of rooms where the goal is to hit several lantern \"markers\" to open the locked door in the room. Or kill every enemy in the room to unlock the door. Or do the above 4 times to open a path a few rooms back and so forth. It really overstayed it's welcome fast. That and coupled with a really lackluster artstyle and dull music combo didn't really light my world on fire. Levels just seem to go on forever and lose their limited appeal quick. Bosses are few and far between and range from brainless to quite tough. Especially the last few.\n\nThe whole time playing 2 Heroes I kept thinking in my head that this is a perfect example of a game with an excellent gameplay idea with above average execution when it comes to the raw gameplay puzzles but every other thing in the game boggs it down to being rather bland and tedius. So when someone asks you \"If a game has good fundemental gameplay does it need anything else?\" While I would usually so most of the time no and one could argue if it becomes so repitive and tedius did it really have good gameplay to begin with? In a vaccum I wanna say it does but at the same time I just can't bring myself to want to try to 100% this game or give it the multiple plathroughs it wants me do on new game plus. Honestly after going back and forth with it I'm giving a 5/10 because the scales just didn't tip it in an any direction more me but I could easily see other thinking much higher of the gameplay.\n\nIts a Capcom weekend! Im feeling energised to continue my complete run through of every Capcom release/port ever, and so I'll be playing quite a few of the same game (Final Fight etc.) across multiple platforms. Rather than count each port as its own game completed, I'll just count them once, and then add the rest to my list as un numbered bonus games (unless the ports deviate fairly far from the original releases - like Bionic Commando NES Vs Arcade ports).\n\n15. Bionic Commando (ZX Spectrum & Amstrad CPC) - Ok, counting these as one as honestly the only difference is the Amstrad one runs slower and somehow looks worse (no idea how that happened, Im suspecting a quick and dirty port of the Spectrum version). But anyway, this is a port of the arcade BC and NOT the amazing NES reimagining that I vastly prefer. That said, I still love the arcade original. Honestly, Im torn on the Spectrum port especially... its actually fairly faithful to the arcade version - looks accurate, controls fairly close to the arcade version and runs at a nice fast pace... but unfortunately it kept the arcade level of difficulty as well, so with a small number of limited lives, its bastard hard.\n\nEnemies constantly spawn, hide off screen (above and to the sides) and stuff like helicopters just... dont leave you alone. It makes ascending and traversing the levels incredibly challenging, as you only take one hit to lose a life, which leads to many an instance where you can walk forward a few steps, have the screen scroll and suddenly a mech leaps at you leaving you (almost) no time to react.\n\nOtherwise the game is great. Its faithful level wise to the original, and really doesnt feel like there's that much cut compared to other ports. Its just a shame that the difficulty probably puts plenty of people off from ever seeing those later levels! (yay for emulation!)\n\n16. Spider-Man 2 (NGAGE) - Based on the second Raimi movie, this game is somewhat similar in structure to the GBA Spidey games of the time, but is actually a completely original game in terms of levels and boss fights (well, bar one).\n\nThe game still follows the design of the GBA games - huge levels which usually ask you to find or destroy X of Y. Meanwhile, you need to swing, wallcrawl and brawl your way through the levels to said objectives.\n\nGraphically most of the game mimics the GBA games, save for maybe slightly higher quality animation. It also feels like some of the characters have somewhat of a pre rendered look, which honestly looks worse (especially these days) compared to the GBA sprites.\n\nWhat does look better though are the webswinging sections that break up chapters in this game. Like the GBA version of 2 you have 3D sections in this game, but unlike the GBA version which uses sprites and trickery to make it seem 3D, this one uses proper polygons to give you these checkpoint based webswinging sections - which run faaaaaaaaaaaaar smoother/faster as well. These are linear mind you, but still a cool way of giving you some 3D action between 2D sections (bonus points for them aging well!)\n\nThe combat is still disappointing though - same combos as the GBA version and same problems with some of your hits missing, basically leaning far into \"button bashing\" to the point where evading enemies is smarter.\n\nOne point where this game really suffers is screen real estate. I used an NGAGE emulator (again, own the game, not an NGAGE) and the screen is narrow. Real bad design from the handheld here... Means it makes certain instant KO obstacles real hard to see...\n\nVillain wise it plays real safe with it again using Doc Ock, Mysterio, Shocker and Rhino from Spidey 2 (all games seem like they use these dudes) but like the GBA port we also get Lizard (though Puma is absent from this port...)\n\nThe fights with these characters range from laughable to WTF. Mysterio and Rhino are hilariously easy, Lizard is... so-so, Doc Ock takes some understanding as he has a healing gimmick which I dislike, but still not a bad final boss, but Shocker is bizarrely not the jobber you'd expect. Weirdly also, this one pulls the most from the GBA port... of Spider-Man 1! he basically acts identical - basically has a shield round him so you cant just hit him, you gotta wait until he laughs so you can get a hit in... this fight takes forever, but if you time it right eventually when he starts shooting the ceiling causing it to crumble, you just position it proper so it crushes him (again, JUST like the GBA fight in Spidey 1). A note on Shocker - his stage feels entirely ripped from the first movie game on the GBA. No one elses content is, no idea why the heck they did this...\n\nOverall the game is fine. Its certainly not a bad Spidey game (I reserve that tier to shite like GBC Spidey 1, Spider-Man 3 for the GB, Spidey Vs Sinister 6 for the Master System etc.) but its not an all timer either. The small screen and huge levels can often leave you wondering where to go for stretches of time, the combat sucks and boss fights arent too great. They also skip so much of the movie confrontations with Ock (the bank and the train) which is weird because those are iconic moments perfect for a game (I mean, other ports even use them!), so in the end it'll be yet another licensed release shoved out in time to cash in on the movie.\n\n17. Black Tiger (Amstrad CPC & ZX Spectrum) - Another double helping of US Gold flavoured shite, this one borders on their shitacular Final Fight port in terms of \"take beloved Capcom arcade classic and make it borderline unplayable).\n\nBlack Tiger in the arcades was an excellent platform/action hybrid that was fast paced, full of traps, and had some fun boss encounters. You'd be getting tons of cash to buy better gear (which you'd need in some of the later encounters) and the whole thing was just a really good time. It sorta gets lost in the shuffle when remembering Capcom's platformer output sometimes - Mega Man and Disney had cornered the NES home ports while Ghouls n Ghosts was the superior arcade platformer from Capcom. But none the less I really love this game.\n\nSo its super frustrating to yet again see another crappy port from the kings of crappy ports - US Gold and Tiertex... The game actually looks the part - big sprites (arguably too big) and the action is technically accurate to the arcade original - you have a morning star like weapon AND you shoot knives as well for longer range. You head through levels, climb pillars, jump pits, and... well Id say fight enemies but here's one of the problems - the collision detection is so abysmal that if your too close, you dont hit enemies. And enemies basically stick to you not dissimilar to Final Fight's problems. So despite the fact you are shown \"hitting\" the enemies, it doesnt register. And it basically makes the entire game unplayable.\n\nSecondly, the game (especially on the Amstrad port) is insanely slow. So you plod along with enemies who may or may not be defeated as I ponder my gaming goals for the year!\n\nNot helped any is the jumping controls and the zoomed in nature of the platforming - there's tons of bottomless pits that you wont see until your in them, and the controls are very janky when it comes to grabbing pillars, even a pixel off and you miss and lose a life... So when your not struggling with combat, your in a pit of spikes...\n\nThe last boss is hilariously bad as well. Its one of the dragons (which originally is an amazing fight), but here it just sorta... sticks to you, I spent a good several minutes unsure I was even hurting it, until the game threw up a \"well done you win\" screen and that's it.\n\nAll in all, its better than Final Fight, but only just. This is around a 2-3/10 compared to Final Fight barely being a 1/10. Tons of levels are cut and honestly I dont care. Unlike Bionic Commando or Strider which at least managed to accurately replicate the game AND be playable, this is yet another huge miss... I really wonder between LED Storm and Last Duel (my next 8 bit computer ports) which will be less awful! Will one of them accurate meet the oh so low barrier of \"playable\"? Probably not, but we'll see!\n\n*edit* Because of just how bad this game was, I just had to load up the arcade version thanks to Capcom Arcade Stadium 2 and its infinitely better. Ignoring the obvious improvements due to hardware, the controls, collision detection and general encounter design is so much better its not even funny. Yet another example of Tiertex porting a game badly (that really should have been their motto....)\n\nBonus. Final Fight (X68000) - The Sharp X68000 was an amazing computer released only? in Japan during the late 80s to 90s. Its rather famous in gaming circles for having amazing ports of arcade games - while I was either trying to be content with Amiga 500 Street Fighter 2 (until getting the SNES version), Japanese gamers had this computer as an option, which legit has some almost arcade perfect ports of stuff like Street Fighter 2, Final Fight etc. Ive owned all the Capcom X68000 games for years, never had the hardware to play them, so with the power of my Steam Deck, I finally got the emulator working, and I am not disappointed.\n\nThe last FF port I played was the Amstrad port - an 8bit UK computer which, to be honest, almost didnt run the game at all (see above). Playing this port right after it is night and day. The port is essentially arcade perfect, graphically it looks the part with huge sprites perfectly animated, control and most importantly collision detection wise is PERFECT, it feels just like the arcade port, and even the music is faithful to the arcade (though some audio sounds muffled).\n\nEasy difficulty limits the number of enemies on screen to just 3 - I wondered if this was like the SNES port which could not do any more than 3, but cranking up the difficulty increases enemy count on screen with no notable slowdown from what I can tell.\n\nThere's really not much else to say... I did a complete run through to the end, only really struggling, as per usual, on stage 6. There's no question that Id have LOVED to own this computer growing up. Ive quickly tried the other ports and they all seem pretty much arcade perfect as well, so Im looking forward to digging into the rest of them. Kinda wish we'd have gotten more ports though... Id have thrown big money down for a Cadillacs and Dinosaurs port.\n\nBonus. Street Fighter II' (X68000) - SFII was always going to be a difficult computer port back in the day because most computers over here decided to only give you one fire button... maybe 2 if your lucky. For a 6 button fighter. Yeah, it was shit.\n\nThankfully over in Japan someone had the bright idea to let you get a 6 button pad and use that instead. Which surprisingly enough made it play better! Alongside the excellent sprite work that looks almost identical to the arcade and seemingly perfect collision detection and controls, this felt like I was playing the arcade version. From what I understand the original computer version has way longer load times, but Im kinda cheating here and am using a file version that fixes that, so its really just a second or two from Vs screen to the fight. Not quite instant, but close.\n\nGameplay wise Im just play Vs CPU, and AI wise again its just like the original arcade version, down to Ken spamming dragon punches!\n\nAgain, not much else to really say about this one, as its practically arcade perfect. This one is impressive even compared to the console ports of the time, which had the gameplay down but compromise mainly on the sprite work (way smaller sprites, not quite as detailed), but this version looks almost spot on.\n\nBonus. Super Bat Puncher Demo (Evercade) - Im going through the first Morphcat Evercade collection and thanks to the handy manual (remember those?), this was listed as their first game - a small proof of concept release that garnered a lot of attention. The game is pretty short (20 minutes or so) so Im not counting is as a full game on my list, but the game itself does indeed deserve praise. Its a cute little platformer that had some cool mechanics - the idea of using this spring powered boxing glove attack which when used on walls propels you forward far to the opposite side, or using it against a wall on the ground so you curl up like a bowling ball to brake through walls... its rather creative. If they'd created a full game based on these concepts (well, maybe they have, I dont know) Id certainly play it!\n\nDropped:\n\nFirehawk (Evercade) - When controls ruin a game... I never really had issues with tank controls in Resident Evil. Its a slow paced game and zombies are slow, so for the most part I could weave between enemies just fine, until I had plenty of ammo to go rambo. But what happens when you apply a similar control scheme to a shoot em up? It fucking sucks, that's what. Firehawk's biggest (but far from only) problem is that you have these enemies and shots zipping around you, and turning to avoid anything would take far too long, meaning most of the time your gonna take that hit. Couple that with strict limited ammo, tons of enemies, and even limited fuel and you have a game that basically hates you... a very 80s British concept to be honest...\n\nAmmo and health can be collected by destroying buildings and such but with so many random shots popping up out of nowhere, you can really struggle to survive, let alone make a shred of progress. The early levels ease you into things, and honestly it feels pretty fun, as it feels more balanced at that point, but after around 3 levels, the game goes full on hateful... even with save states, your gonna hate your time with this.\n\nThe other main problem comes with the actual requirements in the stages - namely saving downed hostages with your helicopter. You hover overhead to begin a mini game which requires you to time your left and right shots perfectly to hit enemies that move to one side quickly, and if you miss even once, you take damage. Each mini game has upwards of a dozen or more enemies, so yeah it can be a pain. And to make it worse, the geniuses over at Codemasters thought it'd be funny to have your craft move left to right randomly, and the AI of the survivor is so braindead he might not even run toward said copter immediately - meaning the mini game goes on for an undetermined amount of time while you hope the dipshit survivor runs toward your copter.\n\nIts a hatefully, ill conceived idea that doesnt work, and is just so bloody bad to play, you'll want to give up after just a couple of levels, and well... its on my \"dropped\" list for a reason lol.\n\nThe game just keeps on going, I made it to stage 6 before the game screwed me over and I gave up, having no interest in playing any further. Pity, the game was promising but control and design decisions absolutely ruin the game. If you want a decent shoot em up for the NES with planes and shit, go play 1943 instead, that's one heck of an excellent shmup.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\n52 Games. 1 Year. 2024.

Treasure Island Dizzy (Evercade) 5. Wonderland Dizzy (Evercade) 6. Mystery World Dizzy (Evercade) 7.

By now Ive managed to visit most of the locations, and am ticking off the collectibles as I travel. Its not a masterpiece, but its strangely relaxing and very fun. Hoping I have this mostly complete by the time Yakuza releases.\n\nMicro Mages (Evercade) - A really fun 2D indie game harkening back to old NES games. Cleared the first 4 levels, now doing the second loop with harder levels and loving it.\n\nAmerican Arcadia (PC) - Sadly neglected as I work on The Crew, I really must get back to this as the story has just turned a page and its getting really good. I need to carve out some time this week to finish this one off.\n\nHi everyone, this is my first ever post on Resetera. I've enjoyed reading this thread in years past for ideas on games to check out and this year I finally got the inspiration to sign up for an account and do the challenge. Never been close to 52, due to my penchant for long RPGs, but hoping to expand the genres I play this year and see how many I get through.\n\n1. Armored Core 6 - Fires of Rubicon (PS5): January 7. 25 hours. Rating: 9/10\n\nThe first mech game I've ever played, and my second favorite game of 2023 (after ToTK). Excellent controls and customization options, which made it fun to try out different builds when I got stuck. The story was also surprisingly captivating. I only did one ending, because I knew I would feel compelled to spend another 25+ hours getting 100% if I did another run - probably will someday!\n\n2. Dragon Quest XI S Echoes of an Elusive Age (Switch): January 15. 75 hours. Rating: 9/10\n\nMy first Dragon Quest game and I had a great time. I love that there are still big-budget AAA JRPGs like this being made. The battle system was simple, yet fun to try out different configurations. I love all of the more modern QOL features they've sewn onto these old-school RPG mechanics (ultra-fast speed in battle, sprinting in the field, re-spec'ing skill points), and the world-building and characters really drew me in, even if the main plot was a little too bogged down by well-worn RPG tropes for my liking (the main character being both silent and the destined legendary savior of the world reincarnated...). I completed all three acts and all of the trials at the end, and had a great time in particular figuring out how to use different pep powers in a complementary way. I did the exp grind cheese to max my levels quickly at the beginning of Act 3, which made the whole last act a breezy romp. Excellent game that I wish they made more of these days; probably my 3rd favorite modern JRPG (only slightly behind Ni No Kuni 2 and Yakuza 7). The main issue I had was the awful music; even the orchestral versions are grating on my ears and it was shocking to me that the number of tracks is so low. It made no sense that the city theme was repeated in towns with vastly different climates and cultures and the field and dungeon music was also frequently repeated. I know the composer was quite old when he composed this OST, but it just feels so out of place as part of a package that is so lush with incredible art and world-building otherwise. Hopefully with a new lead composer this will improve in future titles.\n\n3. Steamworld Dig (Switch): January 18. 8 hours. Rating: 8/10\n\nShort and sweet. I love the movement in this game and the gameplay loop is very satisfying. Not particularly difficult nor is there a lot to this game, but the focused scope works well and has me excited for the sequel.\n\n4. Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope (Switch): January 20. 11 hours. Rating: 8/10\n\nI'm not the biggest 2D platformer fan (I'm the only person I know who bounced off Mario Wonder) but I thoroughly enjoyed Shovel Knight. Beautiful presentation and responsive controls. I'm not the best at precision platforming, so I love how forgiving its checkpoint system is, making it less tedious to retry areas that were giving me trouble. I will probably play the other campaigns at some point, though I can only take so much platforming at once before I get frustrated with the genre, lol.\n\n5. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5): February 2. 52 hours. Rating: 10/10\n\nThis game made me feel like a giddy school child again. It grabbed me so hard for the first ~10 or so chapters, I didn't sleep much the weekend it came out. The characters, substories, and side content are excellent as always (seriously, who consistently writes more likeable and unique characters than RGG?), but the battle system in particular felt greatly improved with the addition of positional attacks and duo/chain attacks. I completed Dondoko island the first time the game took me there (8 hours straight) and they took their ridiculous meter to another level with Sujimon (which is the true Pokemon clone of 2024); the extent to which they reference Pokemon and parody it while making all the Sujimon and their trainers look ridiculous made it the most charming side activity they've ever made, which is quite an accomplishment. This is also the first time I felt an RGG game was out-of-this-world beautiful too and they nailed the aesthetic they were going for both visually and aurally in Hawaii. The main story was engaging the first 3/4 of the game, but trailed off for me toward the end as I really didn't care for the main motivations of the villains nor did I find them very compelling. The references to prior games/characters were powerful and hugely satisfying for fans who've played all the mainline games. Biggest complaint I have is the boring dungeons which are just hallways filled with enemies again; I would love them to do something interesting with them, maybe some more interactable or puzzle elements.\n\n(As an aside, I played the Japanese dub and was very distracted by the ridiculous English voice direction of this version. I get why RGG studios always has ridiculous, over-enunciated, unnatural English in their Japanese dubs (to make it easier for Japanese players to understand), but I thought that now of all times they would try to make the English more natural since this is the first game taking place in the English-speaking world. I also wish they came up with some device (literary or literal) explaining why all these non-Japanese people speak fluent Japanese, like Kasuga getting an app on his phone with an earpiece that automatically translates for him or something. Bryce in particular was especially jarring since he's a white guy that speaks fluent Japanese and they just used his Japanese voice actor to read his English lines, which sounded ridiculous coming out of his mouth. The writers could've done some really cool things playing on the language barrier too. I also would've loved to hear Kuroda speak full English sentences lol. This really didn't have a big effect on my enjoyment of the game, though, just something that came up often.)\n\nThis game will be very tough to beat for my GOTY this year. In 2020, Yakuza 7 barely edged out FFVII Remake for me, and I think it will be a similar race this year.\n\n6. Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intermission (PS5): February 10. 9 hours. Rating: 8/10\n\nPlayed for the first time in the lead-up to Rebirth, since it's been almost four years since I played Remake and wanted to brush up on the story/characters/world. The combat here remains excellent and I enjoyed how different Yuffie felt and her shinjuku attacks added a whole other dimension to combat that makes her unique as it allows you to attack multiple characters at once even if they're not in the same AoE. The story and Yuffie's characterization of Yuffie were fine and pretty much what I expected going into it, but I was particularly impressed with the end when Sonon sacrifices himself for her and she feels both the loss of a friend/fellow Wutaian but also the frustration of being treated as though she needs protecting like a child. I'm sure this will lead to some significant character development in Rebirth when she finds her spot in the team. Also, I read some fan speculation that Sonon may turn into Azul from Dirge of Cerberus, and OMG I would die if they went there lol. I love how the dev team is really taking the time to develop side characters that didn't get much attention in the original game.\n\n7. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion (Switch): February 11. 29 hours. Rating: 7/10\n\nThis is my first time playing, also in preparation for Rebirth. I was happy with it overall, though I got a little too invested in the side missions which became a total slog and resulted in me being way overpowered for the last ~40% of the game. You can tell this is a crusty old PSP game that they prettied up, but the combat, story, and character development kept me invested. I didn't like the dialogue at all for much of the game - it felt less refined/mature than what Square Enix has done lately (particularly in comparison to FF XVI), but it got better later into the game (especially with Zack's character growth). The DMW system was just fine, but I did get mildly addicted to the materia fusion mechanic and thought that's an interesting way to utilize all of the low-level loot you accumulate throughout the story and side missions. The game also played well enough on Switch and I got used to the 30 fps and lower quality textures/resolution.\n\n8. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5): Mar 10 (normal mode story playthrough), Mar 31 (Platinum trophy). 179 hours. Rating: 10/10\n\nWhat a masterpiece. This is one of the best games I've ever played - probably in my personal top 5. The world and characters in the FF7 universe are so captivating and the team fleshed it out amazingly in this game. I feel confident that this is my favorite soundtrack of all time, and the story and presentation are incredible. The combat is my favorite in any action RPG and for the first time, I truly understand why fighting game fans will devote hundreds-to-thousands of hours to mastering their favorite characters. When I went through the brutal/legendary VR challenges and the later chapter boss fights on hard mode, it pushes you HARD and my thumbs are both strained, but I devoted myself to it because I just love this combat system so much. And I really just want to hang out in this game as long as possible; I'll probably go back and get the rest of the manuscripts and max out the bonds with each character because I just don't want to stop. It's not perfect (no game is) with some of the mini games and open-world activities being underwhelming, but they were easy to overlook since I was loving this world and 95% of the gameplay so much. I have a very difficult time seeing how they match this with the third game.\n\nI didn't grow up with the original FF7 (didn't play it until 2021 (after beating Remake in 2020), and even then I haven't beaten it :P) but the Remake/Rebirth series has made me a huge fan.\n\n9. Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster (Switch): April 7. 30 hours. Rating: 8/10\n\nMy first time playing this game. I've been aware of its reputation for a long time and I can definitely tell why this is considered a masterpiece. If I had played this ~15-20 years ago, it'd be one of my all-time favorites. It's bursting with optional content and playstyles that allow you to customize your party of 14 playable characters. This game is massive, made quite frictionless and pleasant by the QOL features of the remaster, which I took advantage of to avoid grinding and to turn off random encounters much of the time. I would've probably gotten more out of my engagement with the RPG systems if I hadn't used them, but I also worry that I would've grown tired of the game and not finished because these days I don't feel the motivation to pour >40 hours into an RPG that is so old and has been iterated upon and outdone (IMO) in the past 30 years. As a landmark in game design though, there's no denying the massive impact this game had and I'm so glad I experienced it. Still a great game to play in its own right today, not just a historical relic to study in a class on the history of RPGs.\n\n10. Portal (Switch): April 8. 3 hours. Rating: 8/10\n\nMy first time playing this game. Puzzles are super clever and the characters and story twist were great. I was getting a little tired of the gameplay mechanics and loop by the end so I'm taking a break before trying Portal 2, which I understand people seem to hold in higher regard.\n\n11. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D (Citra): May 1. 30 hours. Rating 10/10\n\nHoly hell what a masterpiece. I played through much of the game back in 2001 and 2011, but stopped both times around the Great Bay Temple, so this is my first time experiencing the whole game, including all the side quests and masks. I played this time with the Project Restoration and 4K texture pack mods and they completely bring this game up to modern standards in terms of technical quality and QoL features. I can't imagine how Nintendo could make a better version of this game than what these mods do to the 3DS version. The game itself is just magical. The world, characters, main plot, side quests, ATMOSPHERE, time loop mechanic, character progression, pacing, coherence between story and gameplay mechanics - all top notch. This is such a masterful game - and the fact it was made in 1 year is hard to believe. Hang this one up in the video game Louvre.\n\n12. Metal Gear Solid (PS5): May 4. 10 hours. Rating: 7/10\n\nMy first time playing this game. Story, characters, atmosphere, and especially the pacing are top-notch and hold up well. The gameplay is very dated though and I found myself getting frustrated with it frequently. I'm excited to go through the rest of the sequels as the game design becomes more modern, though.\n\n13. Super Mario Bros Wonder (Switch): May 5. 15 hours. Rating: 7/10\n\nVery clever, super polished 2D platformer. Unfortunately, this is a genre I struggle to get into so it took me several months of chipping away at this game to get through it since I couldn't play more than an hour or so at a time. I'm really happy they decided to get weird and inventive with this one after the NSMB games and I completely understand why people love this game, it's just not for me.\n\n14. Castlevania: Circle of the Moon (Switch): May 11. 12 hours. Rating 7/10\n\nMy first Castlevania game. I really enjoyed the map, progression, and pacing, though the controls are clunky and the game did feel repetitive after a while. Thank god for the rewind feature; I would've gotten fed up with some of the cheap bosses and platforming in this game without it.\n\n15. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (Switch): May 13. 13 hours. Rating: 8/10\n\nDefinite improvement over Circle of the Moon. The soul mechanic works well and I enjoyed the weapon variety, which made the combat much more enjoyable. The music and sprite work/art direction are fantastic too.\n\nTotal: 15/52\n\n18. Mini Mages (Evercade) - Cleared both the first and second loops. Another of Morph Cat's games, this one aping NES era games in more than just the looks! The goal is to climb each tower (stage) and reach the exit. You've got a range of enemies to evade or destroyed, each well designed as they are not only dangerous, but work well within the towers they are placed in - for example the snakes will run at you when you reach their level, these jumpy things will always leap vertically when shot at, demons and goats have arc'ed attacks that require specific positioning, skeletons that throw bones that bounce off walls several times etc. Nothing feels cheap, so it doesnt feel unfair but rather the good kind of challenging - the tough yet fair kind.\n\nWhile you dont have much in the way of attacks in terms of quantity, you are far from weak. Your basic attack can take out most enemies quick, and the charge shot is even more powerful, making short work of bigger enemies. The charge shot also acts as a double jump as if you shoot it downward while jumping, you get a boost in height - this is INVALUABLE when it comes to more expert platforming - you can evade enemies and cut bits of levels out just by mastering this excellent atack.\n\nAt the end of each 3rd stage you have a boss fight. These are honestly fairly easy. If it werent for you only taking a couple of hits, there'd be a pushover.\n\nOnce you take out the fourth and final boss (which shows up in stage 4-4), you are thrust back into a more difficult second loop - yup its taking its cues from arcade games like Ghosts n Goblins.\n\nThe challenge here is again - fair. Its not insanely tough, but its definitely a challenge. You have a few blocks this time that are spikes so you need to dodge those obviously, and you have bosses who get new attacks/phases. These are definitely harder no doubt, but again they honestly dont feel cheap. The 3rd set of stages feel the toughest due to the lava, Id argue the last level is actually easier by comparison.\n\nOverall its an incredibly tightly designed platformer that challenged me, and was darn fun for its duration. The later levels on the second loop definitely took me a few tries, but the more I played the better I got so Im not bothered. There's a expanded/DLC quest included on the Evercade cart that I need to get to, Im anticipating something even tougher! Something akin to Mario 2 (Japan) increase in difficulty compared to Mario 1!\n\n19. LED Storm (ZX Spectrum) - Here's another port that actually got close to being good. But the fact that you need either a photographic memory, or the ability to see the future, to properly enjoy it sorta hurts the port. Its a top down racer (think Micro Machines) which has really sharp turns, and if you hit the wall your probably stuck (both figuratively and literally) and you end up blowing up, losing time/fuel and it makes the entire thing more difficult than it should...\n\nI also have... doubts that the course design is accurate to the arcade version, which I do need to double check, but it seems that they mainly just copy/paste one course and make it slightly different each time, but keeping the silly sharp turns which are so hard to react to unless you already know they are coming.\n\nIts a shame, the rest is fairly accurate to the arcade version. Its pretty fast, it handles well and it represents the basic design of the game accurately. But I just dont recall the game being this damn punishing... On my good days, I can pretty much 1CC the arcade game (both the beta and full release), but here there are courses that were basically impossible without save scumming and luck (since one life = game over).\n\n*fake edit*\n\nCapcom Arcade Stadium 2 to the rescue again! I booted up that version of LED Storm and yeah the port was botched, here's how:\n\nGame is too fast. I praised the speed of the game above but turns out that's what's shooting me in the foot. The arcade version runs a tad slower, with what feels like wider roads too, which makes those sharper turns, less sharp. And easier to navigate. Also, jumps have arrows and barriers denoting where they are and where to go... this sort of stuff works phenomenally well to sign post where you need to go and makes the game so much easier by comparison.\n\nAlso not sure if health drain is faster in the computer port? Either way I cleared almost 6 stages (of 10) on one credit for the arcade version.\n\nLastly, the control is better in the arcades - the wall issues I mentioned dont really occur here because you can easily get away from walls on hit, while they just suck you in on the Spectrum port. So yeah... bad port of a good game. Shame.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\n52 Games. 1 Year. 2024. [BacklogBeat]\n\nReserving post. May Yakuza 8 not harm my ability to finish too many games lol. 1. The King's Bird (PS4) 2. River City Rampage (Evercade) 3. Double Dragon 2 (Evercade) 4. Treasure Island Dizzy (Evercade) 5. Wonderland Dizzy (Evercade) 6. Mystery World Dizzy (Evercade) 7. Dizzy the Adventurer...\n\nNext: likely Shovel Knight, Steamworld Dig, or Pikmin 4. I want some shorter games the rest of the month before the back-to-back behemoths of LAD: Infinite Wealth and FF7: Rebirth take all my gaming time in February/March.\n\nTotal: 2/52\n\nAll excellent choices, though depending on your level of completion, Pikmin 4 can go on for quite a while - its got a ton of content (said content is excellent) so Id recommend one of the other two instead since both are fairly short. Dig is the shorter of the two, but Shovel Knight is an absolutely amazing game that I cannot recommend highly enough!\n\nLikewise, I know the feeling of mixing the shorter stuff with the RPGs, I reckon Im getting around 200+ hours from Yakuza 8 alone, but that's not counting FFVII and Persona 3, not to mention Ronin and Dragons Dogma 2... that's why it helps that Im playing lots of VR and retro stuff!\n\n20. Last Duel (ZX Spectrum & Amstrad CPC) - Another day, another US Gold port of a Capcom game. This time though... this is one Im not really all too familiar with or a big fan of. The most fun parts (even in these ports) are the bike sections, but LED Storm do those better (assuming you play the arcade version lol).\n\nThe game itself is a shoot em up - going from bike sections, to ship sections. The ship sections are straight ahead vertical scrolling shmups while the bike sections also add lite platforming and racing to them (because you have limited fuel). I'll focus on the Spectrum version to discuss why this game is sorta a mess on both stages:\n\nFirst off, the game is pretty snappy speed wise. Good right? Well... no. Like LED Storm before, this game is too fast to see what's going on in the bike sections. Clearing parts without losing likes (one hit KO mind you) feels like luck, not skill. It gets worse when the jump needs to be used, as try as I might, I never figured out how to do it legit every time... save states sure helped my ass, but still trying to legit get good at the game felt like an unreachable barrier.\n\nWhat makes this game worse is Spectrums limited colour palette used. Coupled with the speed, its almost impossible to see what's going on sometimes, honestly the game needed less detail in tracks and backgrounds, as stage 4 (a ship level) has enemies almost entirely blend into the background, its so hard just to see anything, again lending more luck than skill getting through these.\n\nJump ahead to the final stage (thankfully, its only 6 stages) - you have these ships that will spawn behind you and basically home in on you. They are technically possible to dodge, but the window is so small due to their speed, your huge hitbox, and their huge size - that actually evading them is a task unto itself. Thankfully Id saved my lives for the finale and I managed to basically cheese my way through those bits (but it still took several attempts.\n\nThe final boss was thankfully a complete joke.\n\nOverall? I see potential, and Id imagine the arcade version plays at least half decent.... the game mainly falls over due to the Spectrum port being badly designed (which is par of the course for US Gold sadly).\n\nNow the Amstrad version... I only got to the end of stage 4 here, because I had so many weird issues with the versions I tried that the first one got only to the stage 2 boss before it disappears, and then the other version I tried did the same at stage 4. So I cant judge 2 of the levels, but can comment on the game overall.\n\nIt still suffers the same control (jump) issues in bike mode, but aside from that it does show some promise. Graphically they have more colour, so issues with stuff melting into the background doesnt happen, which makes things easier in that regard.\n\nSadly the game runs terribly slowly. It does confirm that a slower pace DOES make it easier to play, but this runs so slow that levels feel so incredibly long you'd be forgiven for falling asleep during one lol.\n\n21. Pixel Ripped 1978 (PSVR2) - Finally got off to a start with finishing my sizeable VR backlog. First up is this cool little nostalgia rush! Your trying to save the game world from an evil goblin, while using old Atari games, time travel is involved... its a headache to explain, but trust me its cool.\n\nThe main halves of the game are like this: As \"Bug\" you work at Atari, while the game character is trying to stop said evil goblin from rewriting time. When in the game world you explore things in 3D, fight baddies, engage in puzzles etc. and eventually you'll hit a roadblock and cant traverse any further. You can then go back to Bug who can play the games these worlds are based on, as old 2600 Atari cartridge games. When playing these games you can unlock new paths for your game self, rince and repeat.\n\nIts a super cool way of not only handling puzzles, but having two very different gameplay styles which blend together perfectly. As someone who loves retro games (I mean, my completion list so far should make that very clear), the old Atari sections are brilliant. As you look around your work area you see posters and arcade cabs from various games of the time, and these 2D gameplay sections also are used for the boss fights, which have a sorta \"Augmented Reality\" feel to them, where you see your room/work area, and have the game world sorta overlayed on top of it in a really cool way (VR helps loads to sell this side of things - the sense of depth couldnt be achieved playing this on a normal TV).\n\nAs you go through the game you'll also help a friend bug test famous Atari releases, these set pieces again are cool nostalgia bait and serve to give you new powers - like a joystick with two buttons (sounds harmless, but remember the standard Atari stick only had one!), and even a button to flip in game gravity - this last one feels a little janky as your taking one hand off the stick and its easy to trigger it by accident sometimes...\n\nThe 3D game world stuff is great but honestly feels a bit more generic (save the last area, which is terrific), not helped by enemies taking way too much damage to defeat - Id have actually been happier with this side of things being puzzles only as the combat gets pretty monotonous pretty fast). The exploration and puzzles are good though so it'd have been nice if we had more of that, and less of the three types of enemies showing up to drag things out.\n\nOverall, I loved it. Its only around 4 hours long (unless you look for all collectibles, I only got 75% of them), and aside the combat in certain parts it doesnt outstay its welcome. There's two other games in the series and I really wanna check both out!\n\n22. Spider-Man 2 (Nintendo DS) - Another game based on the second Raimi movie, and this one is a real mixed bag. But I'll give it a bonus point for remembering what the movie was even about in the first place...\n\nSo its a new generation of handhelds! But this doesnt mean better gameplay, in fact Im gonna argue its actually taken a step back compared to the NGAGE and GBA version of the game. See - those two games had these things called \"check points\" and \"level design\". Two things that this one is sorta devoid of. Combat is somehow even more mashy and worse as well, and I legit thought that was impossible.\n\nSo seriously, the level design in this game is basic as fuck. A good 60% (AT LEAST) of the stages is the same New York map - which you traverse in a horizontal, two dimensional manor - going left to right or right to left. You'll get different missions sure - defeat all enemies, disarm all bombs, destroy all robots, save all people... but its the same map and the same basic missions since your hitting people and moving from same area to same area. And there's no compass... so get ready, yet again, to spend several minutes finding that one last thing you need... Most of my times on these missions, aside the timed ones, take a good 10+ minutes, and considering how one dimensional this game tends to be, that's... not good lol. The game does have a couple of different areas for some pivotal plot points - like Ock's lab, or the museum attack with Mysterio, but these are few and far between, and compared to the NGAGE version, its so lacking in level variety and content... And when we do get different areas to explore... its just saving people for two of the maps, and turning off terminals for the docks...\n\nOh, and just to throw the NGAGE one more positive bone - it did 3D better than the DS game did! If you recall, both GBA and NGAGE had moments where you could explore a 3D environment. Its basic and acts as just bits between the main 2D stages, but they were visually impressive (taking into account the hardware) and added variety. Here the game does render characters and environments in 3D, and you even have the camera panning when swinging through New York to show this off, but its still fully played from a 2D viewpoint. And Id argue that the graphics have aged worse - because Im always gonna stan sprites over primitive 3D character models.\n\nAnd with regards to difficulty... there's no checkpoints. If you lose all your health in these long maze like/needle in haystack levels, back to the start for you... It gets really annoying in the final level (Docks) because there's a number of points where you'll be thrown into the water. You cant swim, you dont respawn and take damage, its just instant game over. Other versions of the game checkpoint, so the stuff you've done up to that point are saved. I suspect its done to yet again pad the game out.\n\nWhat the DS does offer that the other versions dont, are touch screen mini games. And let me tell you, as someone who hadnt played a DS game in a long time, a launch one especially, Ive really forgotten how much I hate this shit! Its either operation style \"move the thing without touching the sides\" or \"tap the screen to hit stuff\". Its annoying and takes you out of the fights (when used in bosses), and really adds nothing beyond maybe younger me going \"ooooooooo touch screen\" around about when the game launched (should note I wasnt young when it launched, just very easily impressed).\n\nAnother mark against the game is the villain roster... outside of Ock there's only Vulture, Mysterio and... that's it? (I legit feel like Im forgetting someone but its not coming to me). Compare that to the half dozen other versions get, and remember - most of this game takes place in just that one level, and you can see that the game is really hurting for content. As mentioned above though, this game DOES remember that Doc Ock is the main villain of the movie and you do fight him more than once (unlike other handheld versions which ignore him until the finale) but it yet again ignores key set pieces just begging to be used as levels.\n\nOverall I remember buying into the hype of this game... I still have my launch copy of the game and I seem to recall enjoying it (well, at least I think I did). But revisiting it and I reckon this'll be my least favourite version. There's just so little content here, the level design sucks, combat sucks, villain roster is barely there at all, touch screen stuff sucks... And despite all that... Id still say its an average to above average Spidey game. Why? Because I remember the really bad ones and this aint that. Controls wise its still fine, performance wise its a solid 60FPS, the game isnt that hard aside some silliness with a couple of mini games and the final level... so its perfectly fine to complete and didnt annoy me. Not like Revenge of the Sinister Six for the Master System. But I do hope the next Spidey game is an improvement... it doesnt need to be drastically better, just gimme better levels and villains lol.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\n52 Games. 1 Year. 2024. [BacklogBeat]\n\n23. Spider-Man 2 (PSP) - Yes, its still various releases centering around the second Raimi movie, and this one I actually really enjoyed, despite its flaws.\n\nFirst off - this is a proper 3D Spidey adventure. Not like the DS which was a worse 2D game compared to NGAGE and GBA. Its not fully open world like the Xbox etc. console version, but rather more like the first movie game (and previous Acti releases on the PS1) in that its a linear 3D level based adventure.\n\nSo first thing I have to get out the way, the camera sucks in this game. Its a problem with tons of PSP games sadly, because it lacks that second stick. You can move the camera with the DPAD but that's not easily reachable when playing.\n\nCombat wise Id expected the game to play just like the 3D games that came before it, but nope, the combat is actually refined to the point where it actually works way better - moves dont miss enemies, you wont have enemies punching through you when attacking, you have a good moves list, air combos, and your actually pretty damn powerful to the point where goons really dont feel like a threat. Web moves are at a minimum sadly, its something the other 3D games did better, but thankfully they dont ask you to do any stupid gimmick stuff on bosses like Spidey 2 (Enter Electro) did.\n\nBoss/Villain wise... its fairly straight forward and similar to the console game - Shocker, Rhino, Mysterio, Vulture and of course, Doc Ock show up. The plot is straight forward with most just working for Ock, aside Mysterio whose mad at Hollywood (fair enough lol). Boss fights are actually surprisingly good in this one. I was expecting them to feel messy, like the first console movie game (or again, worse like EE was) but here they are tightly designed, and feel like the characters they are based on. A shocking (sorry) favorite is how Shocker & Rhino are handled - ending up as a fight against both together, where you basically have to evade attacks to begin with so that the two basically attack each other. It works surprisingly well, and the fights feel good and well thought out. Mysterio is pretty darn good as well with a mix of decoys and his size changing abilities. Ock sadly is the weakest due to the fight feeling a bit janky, but its still solid and the best of his fights so far in these handheld ports.\n\nLevel wise its a mix of web swinging and action (fighting) stages while usually accomplishing a second goal (bomb defusing and hostage saving are still present and correct!). Interestingly, despite being a sequel, I did spy a number of repeat design choices from the first movie console game - for example when chasing Doc Ock just before the iconic Train sequence, you have a mission at the train station - this is clearly taken from Shocker's encounter in the first game. And for Vulture, his fight is basically identical for the most part to his fight in the first movie game, though his last phase is actually all new.\n\nA couple of levels also have you crawl around - the bank for example has a big focus on dodging the laser grid, sorta like Oscorp in the first game only way more forgiving and much more well designed/fun.\n\nThe levels do suffer from being fairly short. I feel this was done because its a PSP game, and those games were often made smaller as they focus on portable play. Does it hurt the game? Not really, just means it doesnt outstay its welcome.\n\nHonestly, while the game isnt exactly the most amazing Spidey game around, I still had a great time with it. Camera aside the experience felt fair and polished, villains were fun to fight, music was strangely good, and there's really not one part I can point out as being badly designed. Still a 7/10 game, but one Id absolutely replay many more times!\n\nGonna take a Spidey break for a little while since the only Spidey 2 version left is the console version, and Ive got Yakuza showing up in less than a week! Time to get back to the handheld TMNT playthroughs!\n\nBonus. Bobl (Evercade) - This one was shorter than I expected, short enough that it feels more like Morph Cat's demo game, than something like Mini Mages which was more fully fleshed out. Regardless though, its an excellent game that I do wish was longer.\n\nThe game itself is a Metroidvania, but... you play as a bubble. You cant survive out of water, and can pop against walls, so you have to very carefully navigate the game's map, searching for powerups to reach new areas (as in traditional Metroidvania fashion). The power ups you can get are: the ability to descend deeper underwater to reach new areas, a double jump (of course!) and a move that turns your bubble into an iron ball to destroy weak blocks and also serve as one (and ONLY one) extra bounce on land - so basically you can jump out of water, bounce once on land, and then back into another water source.\n\nThe power ups all come together swimmingly and exploring this small map is a blast.\n\nIn fact, that's the only disappointment with the game - its short. You'll probably get between 30-60 minutes (depending on if you get lost/have difficulties) and before you know it, you've reach the end. When I reached said end area I thought Id finally made it out of the starter area and was moving into the next area, only for the game to end!\n\nBonus. Spacegulls (Evercade) - Another very short indie title from Morph Cat, so another bonus \"number\" (though lazy me isnt keeping count lol). This is a flick screen platformer where you play as a seagull in space. You can fly and... well that's it actually. You can Mario bounce on enemies, but other than that, nothing else! No extra power ups like Bobl here, you just need to successfully navigate each room - avoiding spikes, taking out enemies, finding keys and the like. Again, you'll be done in no time and again it feels like the game is just getting started. The room structures are mainly either finding a key or taking out all enemies, and you quickly face off against plenty of different enemies, and the room designs do a great job of challenging you later on (spikes everywhere!) so you need to consider the best way on bouncing the enemies to avoid damage).\n\nThis one I enjoyed less than the other games on the Morph Cat Evercade cart. Its solid dont get me wrong - nice pixel art, perfect feeling controls, but with no power ups and very little variety in rooms, you'll get through this one quickly, probably without losing that many lives either (I think I lost 2?). I feel like this is the type of game that needed to be more like Super Meat Boy - keep the game design as is, just add in tons more levels that get more intricate as you go. I loved what I played, but again I was left wanting more.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\n52 Games. 1 Year. 2024. [BacklogBeat]\n\n1. Diablo 4 (Xbox): 8.5/10 Took a long time to close the deal here, but the Diablo formula is alive and well. Gorgeous and a lot of effort was clearly put into the campaign. Looking forward to expansions in the future!\n\n2. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (Xbox): 8/10 This should be higher because the gameplay is fantastic, but the number of bugs is too many to ignore. That said, Ubisoft nailed the movement and exploration in this game. Bosses were an excellent challenge. They probably could have doubled the fast travel points.\n\n3. Final Fantasy VII Intergrade (PS5): 7/10 An okay DLC that is only okay because if Yuffie. The combat system is still tremendous.\n\n1. Grounded (Xbox) 9 I might be underrating this.

A ton of fun and I'll buy the DLC just to vary the experience.\n\n3. The Forgotten City (Xbox) 7 My first game like this. Enjoyable, and I'd recommend it to anyone who just wants to enjoy a good mystery.\n\n4. Horizon: Zero Dawn (PS5) 8 Great combat, great story, nice length. Took a while to actually hook me, but really solid once it does.\n\n5. God of War (PS5) 7.5 Honestly, I don't think this lives up to they hype. Kratos is a lot of fun, but it was pretty easy and straightforward. After 20 hours on completion, I didn't have much pull to come back and finish more of the world.\n\n6.

Guardians of the Galaxy (Xbox) 7 The combat got tired pretty quickly, and the exploration was solidly just okay, but a fun story propels this one.\n\n9. Pokémon Legends: Arceus (Switch) 7.5 A fun experience for my first Pokémon game. Nothing earth shattering, but an addictive good time.\n\n10. Horizon: Forbidden West (PS5) 8 At this point it's all about a fun story. The combat is good, in the end this game really felt A LOT like Zero Dawn. Maybe I did a few too many side quests, but felt like about 10 hours could have been chopped off. Still, I'll be there for the third one.\n\n11. Triangle Strategy (Switch): 9.5 see below\n\n12. Far: Changing Tide (Xbox): 7 I know people like the first, but this was just ok for me. Didn't really hit.\n\n13. Triangle Strategy (Switch) New Game + Golden Route: 10/10 An all time classic for me. A masterpiece to sit next to FFT. No, it's not perfect, but anything I might complain about pales in comparison to how much it does riot. Story, music, variety of jobs, combat.. all top shelf. Please keep making games like this!\n\n14. Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion (Xbox): 6 Funny writing, but pretty basic game that's spiced up by the art.\n\n15. Wild at Heart (Xbox): 7.5 Neat atmosphere, but kind of ran out of steam.\n\n16. Yoku's Island Express (Xbox): 8 Surprisingly great game. Never thought pinball Metroidvania would be fun, but here we are.\n\n17. Ori and the Blind Forest (Xbox): 8 Love this game and series. Coming back to the first, the sequel is better.\n\n18. Tunic (Xbox) 7 Combat is just bad, and there's a lot of it. Puzzles are great, and sometimes the game is too esoteric, but that part of the game overall is excellent. But there's just a lot of(bad) combat that weighs this down\n\n19. Trek to Yomi (Xbox): 6 Beautiful, kind of boring beat ''em up.\n\n20. Unpacked (Xbox): 7.5 Breezy game when you have nothing better to do.\n\n21. Tomb Raider (Xbox): 7 Pretty simple game. Not sure if I'll continue this series.\n\n22. Hollow Knight (Xbox): 9 see next\n\n23. Hollow Knight- (Radiance Completion) (Xbox): 9.5 This took a long time to really love. I liked it when I beat it on Switch years ago, but for some reason this really clicked with me this run. Incredible game.\n\n24. Cuphead (Xbox): 8.5 Decided randomly to master Cuphead, and it was way more fun this time around.\n\n25. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course (Xbox): 8.5 Really nice cherry on top to the base game.\n\n26. Power Wash Simulator (Xbox) 7 My love and vice. Incredibly addictive, but not sure I'd recommend it because of that!\n\n27. Klonoa (Switch) 6 I had great memories of this, but honestly it's pretty aged at this point.\n\n28. Tinykin (Xbox) 8 Lovely game that was a great relaxing companion to Returnal\n\n29. Returnal (PS5) 9 The best \"Sony\" game I've played in years.\n\n30. Portal 2 (Xbox) 8 Super interesting and clever, but happy to be done. Great writing.\n\n31. Theatrhythm (3DS) 7 Nothing really special about this except the music, which is amazing. We'll worth it for that.\n\n32. Picross S8 (Switch): 7 Same game, still love it.\n\n33. Doom 2016 (Xbox Cloud): 8 Coming back after Eternal, it's more shallow than I remember, but still a blast. First game I beat via Cloud Gaming! There were a few hiccups, but considering the game I was amazed at how well this ran on the Series S Cloud.\n\n34. Kirby Canvas Curse (3DS)\n\n35. Vampire Survivors (Xbox)\n\n36. Picross 3D (3DS)\n\n37. Sonic Frontiets (Xbox)\n\n38. Aliens: Fireteam Elite (Xbox)\n\n39. Firewatch (Xbox)\n\n1. New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe 8/10: It's a bit tired formula, but I still had a blast beating this with my 8 year old son.\n\n2. Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order 9/10: This caught me by surprise by how well done this was. I'll be there for any Respawn sequel\n\n3. Donut County 6.5/10: A fun, simple concept that's unfortunately pretty thin. Funny writing, and very brief.\n\n4. Pikmin 3 Deluxe 8/10: I love Pikmin, and playing through this with my kid was a lot of fun. I wish it were longer, but I haven't played the side stories. Maybe I'll go back.\n\n5. Diablo 3: 9/10: I spent most of my Winter playing this again with friends online. Great way to spend the pandemic in a cold winter.\n\n6. Witcher 3: Wild Hunt 9.5/10: I finally played this after years of hearing about it. It deserves all the accolades - a truly landmark game even in 2021. Unforgettable characters and story. While I appreciated walking through a living city like Novigrad, the heart of the game is outside of city walls for me. I need a break, but will definitely return for the DLC this year.\n\n7. Pikmin 8/10: I 100%'ed this one in about 36 hours. It's a classic, and deserves to still be played. Great way to spend a weekend.\n\n8. Metal Gear Solid 8/10:All time great game for its time. But man this hasn't aged well. The story is still wonderful\n\n9. Metal Gear Solid 2 8.5/10: another all timer, but this also feels old. Better controls, better looks, and the story is still batshit insane.\n\n10. Hades 9.5/10: a pretty close to perfect game. I might burn out on this quickly, but this deserves all its accolades. A completely FUN game - story, gameplay, art, music. It's the whole package. My hands hurt from playing it so much!\n\n11. Cyber Shadow 7.5/10: it's a good game, but it's difficulty means I could only play in small doses. Took about 2 months for the motivation to beat it, and it was a challenge all the way to the end. Hardest game I've beaten in years.\n\n12. Carrion 7/10: Fun game where the novelty wears off about halfway through. Controls get really messy when you're the extra large monster, and having a map would have been nice. Still, good fun.\n\n13. Sea of Thieves 8.5/10: one of the mainstays of the pandemic, and finally finished the Tall Tales. Playing with buds is fantastic - just hanging out and sailing around. Wonderful game loop and I'll be continuing on with the Pirates expansion.\n\n14. Picross S6 7/10: More fun Picross not much new, but I'll be here for 7.\n\n15. Metroid: Zero Mission 8/10: I've owner this forever and never played it. A lot of fun, and this must have been incredible to play handheld in 2001. Still holds up, if for only a few annoying backtracks. Hoping to beat one Metroid a month in the lead up to Dread.\n\n16. Metroid: Samus Returns 7.5/10: I bought this back in 2017 but abandoned it after a few hours, and I understand why now. It's just a bit too long for my taste, which means you spend a lot of time as \"weak\" Samus before powering up. I ended up 100%ing this, but it took some patience to really love it.\n\n17. Super Metroid 7.5/10: I'm shocked to say this really did not hold up as well as I expected. I figured this was still an easy 9/10. Maybe coming off the other two, the missing QOL was more noticeable. Still an incredible achievement for 1994, but I'm looking forward to the more \"modern\" Fusion to finish this off.\n\n18. Mario Golf: Super Rush 5.5/10: A completely competent if uninspiring golf game. I'll probably play this online with friends and if updates come, but really nothing special.\n\n19. Celeste 9.5/10: This is my second playthrough, as I beat it at launch on the Switch. Revisiting this on GamePass is a blessing. An absolute, stone-cold classic. Gameplay , story, challenge, music. It's the full package. I'm probably going for the B sides this time around, and might cheat and count that as a separate game completed if it do.\n\n20. Death's Door: 8/10: Really beautiful and wonderful sounding game that plays well. The levels can be a bit of a maze, but the combat is satisfying. They've built a really nice world, so I'd love a sequel.\n\n21. Halo (MCC) 6.5/10: My first ever Halo, and it's pretty aged at this point. I played it on easy with my son, and we had good fun running through the campaign. It definitely suffers from rooms looking the same and not much enemy variety. The warthog run at the end was just terrible. Still, it's fun playing a game like this coop, so we'll probably move on the 2.\n\n22. Picross S Master System and Genesis 7.5/10: another one, but a bit more fun with the Sega theme. I'll continue to buy everyone of these without shame.\n\n23. Axiom Verge 2 7.5/10: I still don't love this series, but this entry is much more enjoyable than the first. A fun metroidvania with a drone added, but the incredibly convoluted story just tests your patience. That said, I'm sure I'll buy 3 if and when it comes.\n\n24. Doom Eternal 8.5/10: Boy, this is tough to grade. It was so challenging that I took a 6 month break in the middle of the game, and frankly it's surprising I came back to finish it. The change from Doom 2016 to a much more methodical path to success takes serious adjustment. However, once it clicks, it's amazing.\n\n25. Psychonauts 2 9/10 Everything in this game is outstanding aside from the combat. The story and art direction are so good my kids liked watching the game like they like watching cartoons. It handled so many difficult, mature themes so well that it's shocking it's able to carry this high standard the whole way through the game. Love love love this game.\n\n26. Pictooie 4/10 I love Picross, but the load times and ease kill this one. It's just odd having 10-15 second load times entering and exiting each puzzle.\n\n27. Warioware: Get It Together! 5/10: I may raise this score in the future once I play more multiplayer, but as of now, color me unimpressed. Fun concepts that don't really gel together into anything meaningful. The \"story\" is so thin it probably could just be dropped. There's fun to be had, but it feels very half-baked.\n\n28. Murder By Numbers 6/10\n\n29. Metroid Dread 9/10\n\n30. Hades 9.5/10 Replay for Xbox, still amazing\n\n31. Zelda: Breath of the Wild 10\\10 Finally finished Master Mode, still the greatest ever.\n\n32. It Takes Two 8.5/10: Took about 6 months to play through with my wife, and it's excellent. A surprisingly long game, and while there were some jaunts in the middle that felt like the game was running out of steam, it REALLY finishes strong. I don't think I've ever played anything like this where two-player gameplay is so well thought out. Hopefully we'll find another game to play through together.. Though I will say, these people probably shouldn't stay together!\n\n33. Doki Doki Literature Club 6.5/10\n\n34. The Last Campfire 6/10\n\n35. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night 8/10\n\n36.

AEW: Fight Forever ★★\n\nat least the game delivers a better explosion than reality did\n\nFor a wrestling federation that could be seen as priding itself on its impressive ability to air multiple 20 plus minute bouts of technical prowess on a weekly basis compared to the stop/start weekly WWE matches, it's ironic to find that the AEW game is more akin to the usual treatment of their women's division (and WWe's women's tag division while I'm at it), matches over all too quickly and leaving a ton of promise on the potentially flaming table.\n\nWhich is to say that Xbox throwing this title up for a free weekend was all the time I needed to plumb the shallow pool of content that makes up this lacklustre package. Admittedly me pinning my hopes on this game to deliver the first at least good enough wrestling game since like, I dunno, 2010 being generous, had been softened when it turned out that WWE giving 2K a year off was all they needed to make something decent as WWE2K22 finally ended that drought, and a good thing I got that fix I suppose because Fight Forever falls very much short of its lofty goal of being the modern day WWF No Mercy, a game that even those who rightfully balk at this carny business could enjoy.\n\nIt's easy to point out the lacking content and barebones customisation options here in Fight Forever, no one should expect this title to come at the sheer content suite of its closest and far more financed WWE counterpart mind you, yet even so, the create a wrestler offers less than your standard action game character creation tool. The game's single player campaign of sorts is four chapters of esoteric and narrative nonsense with no sense of flow or continuity between them.\n\nI started off immediately winning the women's championship in match 1 with no build up, dropped the belt, got embroiled with the dark order and won the men's midcard belt which I never defended as I instead found myself selecting Luchasaurus as my budding partner to tag with before an inevitable betrayal, and finally ended the journey overcoming a bullying angle as a peak anticlimax, the entire time I'm wondering \"so am I still TNT champion or what?\".\n\nSeemingly each of the four chapters has around three other possible plotlines but I wasn't sticking around to experience them, the writing of this mode is pretty dismal with a completely non serious tone that loses any sense of storyline engagement, opting for cheap pops and smarky dialogue, so like my WWE create a story mode plotlines from the aforementioned 2010 wrasslin' game then, except in an official product, this is not a good thing!\n\nReally though that wasn't the draw of this game, the gameplay foundation was always the big hook for Fight Forever, bringing back Yukes into the wrestling game fold who despite a rough decade have certainly delivered titles a rung barely below the vaunted No Mercy with Day of Reckoning and Smackdown Here Comes the Pain (anyone completely out the wrestling loop reading all this, especially the numerous game name drops must be more confused then an unfortunately common concussed wrestler). There were a lot of people who immediately expressed doubts with Yukes involvement, though you can check the threads to see I gave them the benefit of the doubt, that perhaps a fresh start and longer dev time would let them shine again.\n\nAlas while I really wanted to say \"Yukes still got it!\", this starting point doesn't even rise above their more mediocre work. I felt like a number of the pieces were in the right place gameplay wise, it has the basics of a good wrestling system, except the counter system is rough both in feedback and even presenting the bespoke reversals animations that push the action to the next level of authenticity.\n\nThe balance of match flow and general pacing goes back to the way I opened this mini review with, it's not gonna deliver you even a 10 minute long back and forth, matches fly by so fast that it's over in 2, there's no real drama, not much reason to explore the numerous options, it's arcadey to a fault without the sauce to really qualify as arcadey.\n\nHonestly I'm not even sure why it's so soft arcade like in execution considering its main inspiration in No Mercy, AEW Fight Forever is actually surprisingly close to the cartoony WWE All Stars game (right down to the lack of content, limited roster, naff create a wrestler...huh), which was at least very deliberate exaggerated fighting game that leant into its gimmick 100%.\n\nFunnily enough, the more cartoony and exaggerated elements of Fight Forever are probably its best points, drawing on existing AEW wrestler gimmicks gives you the ability to ride around on a skateboard , put your hands in your pockets and wrestle with indifference. AEW's penchant for hardcore style matches is well represented with a host of varied weaponry including the lovable visual of slamming your foes into thumbtacks that will absolutely stick into them, or being blown up in an exploding barbed wire deathmatch, no sparklers and smoke here.\n\nMoments like these show me that Yukes could have something going here in the future, it's gonna need a lot of work though between rebalancing the gameplay, massively increasing the content, the depth and visual quality and I just can't shake that this starting point might need at least two revisions to get close to being at least Day of Reckoning worthy.\n\nAs far as chants go, \"Fight Forever\"? more like,\" you can't wrestle!\"\n\n*cheap heat, crowd OOOOOOOOs*\n\n4. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown ★★★★\n\nI can now brag that I was on the right side of history regarding this game's mixed response reveal last year, really it makes a lot of sense to take the PoP franchise in the direction of a metroidvania, almost marrying the two existing styles of the series prior, while slotting into a genre that's more in vogue these days.\n\nSaying that, metroidvania games are now a dime a dozen, i've noticed that its increasingly tough for these games to hold my attention as they all draw from the same inspirations and start regurgitating the same upgrades, gimmicks and even combat styles these days.\n\nThe funny thing here is, that PoP is in ways, quite heavily derivative of many of the genre's greats, playing through the game feels like an amalgamation of all the big hitters in a PoP package, you've heard of Soulsbornekiroring, now get ready for Guacaoritroidvania Knight!\n\nDespite this, PoP still stands on its own two feet very well, it melds together pre existing concepts with the franchises own blend of platforming trap chambers, puzzle rooms and sword based combat.\n\nSaid combat might be one of the game's secret weapons, you could describe it as being like a simplified character action game on a 2D plane, which works shockingly well it turns out, where most current metroidvanias lean a bit too much on souls like combat for my liking, PoP is out here letting you pop fools up with air combos, keeping them up by chasing them down with air dashes and arrow shots.\n\nThe bosses especially are a highlight, already I'm thinking that these bosses will be candidates for the best of 2024, certainly some of the best in the genre. Reminding me somewhat of the oft maligned Castlevania Mirror of Fate by Mecury Steam in their cinematic phase by phase execution and parry heavy cinematic moves, except you know, just a heck of a lot better.\n\nPlatforming has a strong focus here as well, not just a means to an end for exploration, there are many pockets of pure platforming challenges and optional collectables, leaning heavily on air dashes and wall jumps through tight spiky passages, why I could make another nod to a notable (though non metroidvania) title in Celeste here, except a lot more manageable, though I suspect some of the later segments might put those who don't eat 2D platformers on the regular through their sweaty palmed paces. As a bonus, there's even a few moments that mirrored the dev teams previous work on Rayman Origins and Legends, neat!\n\nPoP is also a very smooth and flowing kinda game, my play sessions tended to last longer than I planned as the urge to just check one more area constantly pushed me on, movement is fast, control is tight.\n\nThe game's vast (and I mean VAST) map well balances its central story progression alongside leaving just enough areas open to reward exploration without you getting too far removed from the critical path, which is something that's actually getting rarer even among the big names in the genre. At times the game can feel a bit too big, fast travel points are oddly placed leaving some dead zones in the map, the various platforming chambers started feeling a bit rote in the late game, even with the new abilities there's only so many ways you can air dash around spikes even with a few extra wrinkles.\n\nPresentation is the game's most mixed element, visually speaking it's nice enough with a ton of unique rooms, fully rendered backdrops that add a sense of scale and place, a good batch of biomes and one particularly striking late game area frozen in time. If you're wondering where the \"mixed\" part comes in, it's simply the overall quality of said visuals, perhaps Prince of Persia is the perfect AAA dev example of that one sonic meme image of \"i want shorter games with worse graphics\" because it does leave a bit to be desired for a £40-£50 release, the forest area in particular can look a bit ho-hum, it's not a big deal mind you as the art style does a lot of heavy lifting, it's just that this genre now boasts so many gorgeous games at half the price.\n\nThere's also what I unfortunately consider something of a ubisoft hallmark, a lack of extra polish. While I managed to get through the game mostly glitch free, the OT alone shows many a bug or audiovisual glitch that drags things down a bit. And in something that seems to be more a stylistic choice, the game's otherwise well animated cutscenes and super moves that can go gloriously anime as heck, can lack the oomph required by audio to land as effectively as they really should, alongside the way some scenes play out like they suddenly move at 1.5 speed, which in another reference to ubisoft reminds me of the intro to the Assassin's Creed movie which hurt to look at.\n\nOn the whole though, the game is just really good, incredibly well rounded, it hits high marks in so many areas that it genuinely has me a bit puzzled as to why I don't absolutely love it and simply like it a lot. Perhaps the world and characters don't quite do the final step of drawing me in on the level of say Ori (though compared to some reviews that pooped on the plot and character designs, I thought both were pretty good even if not spectacular), the music feels like it's on Dread logic of \"set a mood but don't you dare give them something to hum!\" because I KNOW Coker can cook here (see again: Ori).\n\nIn any case, after such a long gap in releases for the series, as well as the Sands of Time remake falling into development heck, it's great to say that Prince of Persia is back, and with an arguable contender for the best game in the series at that.\n\nedit: oh and because I didn't squeeze this in elsewhere, a couple of the upgrades are REALLY COOL and open the door to some clever puzzles and traversal options, and to my knowledge pretty unique so that's another plus\n\n1. Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name (PS5) - 8/10 | 1.22.24\n\nA short(-ish) take on the Yakuza formula, Like a Dragon Gaiden is an appetizer before the main course that is Infinite Wealth. I actually enjoyed the story more than I thought I would, even if the player is expected to know what happens in most of the plot beats throughout the game. I thought I wouldn't want to see Kiryu taking the main stage again after Yakuza 6, but I think RGG did a really good job of getting me invested in his character direction and current arc. I'm really excited to see where his story goes next, even if his new hairstyle is really, really goofy.​\n\n2. Super Mario Bros. Wonder (NSW) - 9/10 | 1.24.24\n\nThere are few games that I can confidently say I've enjoyed every second of, but Super Mario Bros. Wonder achieves this rare feat in style. The new power-ups are a ton of fun, the new badge system is a fantastic way to dynamically adjust the game's difficulty, and the Wonder Flowers add an unexpected touch to each stage that I found myself looking forward to for each and every level. My only minor gripe is that using Bowser Jr. as the only major boss aside from Bowser himself was disappointing, continuing Nintendo's trend of paring down Bowser's villainous ensemble to himself, Kamek, and Bowser Jr. That may be to Super Mario Bros.'s benefit, though, allowing the game to fully focus on the highlights of its gameplay.​\n\n3. Super Mario RPG (NSW) - 7.5/10 | 1.28.24\n\nAn adorable, relaxing turn-based JRPG that's short, sweet, and to the point. While I don't think the writing hits the highs of the Paper Mario or Mario & Luigi games, it's a lively adventure with a solid cast of lovable characters, including my favorite version of Bowser (even if he's not exactly the most useful party member). Super Mario RPG is an excellent introduction to the genre for kids and full of nostalgia for fans of the classic Final Fantasy games.​\n\n4. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5) - 9/10 | 2.11.24\n\nThis is a game that I'm going to be thinking about for a long, long while. While nominally a sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, in many ways it feels like a direct response to Yakuza 6, a transparent criticism of Kiryu's first, admittedly less believable send-off. Infinite Wealth smartly uses the new turn-based party mechanics to get to the core of Kiryu's character, which somehow feels underexplored even after six entire mainline games and multiple spin-offs. Ichiban's storyline in some ways feels secondary to Kiryu's, and acts as a foil that helps the player understand why Kiryu has to believe in Ichiban's future above all else, entrusting him with the legacy of the yakuza.​\n\nI still don't know what the title's referring to, though, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.​\n\nI've thought a little more about the title and how it relates to the themes of the game since writing my impressions of it almost a month ago. There are a lot of interpretations about what the \"infinite wealth\" in the game is, and given that it obviously isn't about cold hard cash, I think that most of them are getting at the same thing. To me, infinite wealth represents the idea that life itself provides opportunities to those willing to grasp them, but that only the living can take them. No matter how difficult it is to confront your past or to own up to your own mistakes, those who do so will be rewarded in a way that cannot be measured. To atone for your mistakes, you absolutely must live.​\n\nAlso, I've come to realize that I kinda like Kiryu's new hairstyle...​\n\n5. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (NSW) - 7.5/10 | 2.19.24\n\nCastlevania is a series I've had a passing interest in for some time, but every time that I've tried booting one up, I've found myself hitting a wall pretty early on and dropping them before they really begin. I'd heard that Aria of Sorrow was one of the easiest Castlevania games, so I decided to give it a shot, and I really enjoyed it! I've played other Metroidvanias, but more on the \"Metroid\" side with guns and fewer RPG elements. That being said, Aria of Sorrow was actually pretty tough at times, especially in the boss fight against Death. I ended up abusing the rewind feature more than I'd care to admit. I get the feeling that this series will be an uphill battle for me...​\n\n6. Final Fantasy VI (PC) - 8/10 | 3.1.24\n\nThe final game in Final Fantasy's SNES trilogy is a monument to their progress as developers and creators, pushing the boundaries of the technology and the genre as a whole. The storytelling is unique, and the game's ability to cohesively juggle the storylines of fourteen separate party members is impressive. However, I do have some misgivings about how the pacing of the game slows to a crawl in the World of Ruin, and found the lack of meaningful party interactions owing to its open-ended nature to be detrimental to the story as a whole. Final Fantasy VI is too briskly paced in the first half to allow characters time to breath and interact, but has far less to work with in the second half.The gameplay, a slightly awkward mix of FFIV and FFV's systems, is a little bit too easy to break, heavily favoring magic with the caveat that nearly every character can become a competent mage. If I didn't want to use Quick + Ultima, I obviously didn't have to, but I was shocked at how weak other options feel in comparison. That being said, I did give most of the characters in the game a shot aside from Umaro and Gau, and I appreciate how their character-specific systems interacted, even if most of them are largely ignored by the endgame.\n\nKefka is clearly the most interesting villain among the first six games, a character that was fun to hate from beginning to end. A party of heroes finding their resolve to fight against nihilism and determinism may seem a bit cliche nowadays, but it's a longstanding tradition that started with games like Final Fantasy VI.\n\nAs a side note, after looking at my prior Final Fantasy reviews, I think I was a bit harsh on some of them. I would definitely put FFIV above FFVI (if only by a bit), but I definitely wouldn't give FFVI less than a 7.5. Obviously these kinds of reviews are completely arbitrary, but I think I've become a lot more forgiving to video games in general. The original Final Fantasy really did suck, though.​\n\n7. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (PS5) - 9/10 | 3.18.24\n\nIt took me a few months to get back around to it, but I finally finished Armored Core VI! I was honestly shocked at how attached I'd become to the characters, which made the finale all the more gut-wrenching. Walter, Ayre, Rusty, Carla, and even Chatty were like comrades-in-arms, but in typical mecha fashion, their ideals forced the player to make difficult choices about their allegiances. I ultimately sided with Ayre, leading to a climactic and emotional ending that pulled no punches. I appreciate that the ending, and what your choices mean for the world, were a little less vague than most FromSoft games.\n\nAdmittedly, I only played a little bit of Armored Core back on the PS3 before this, so it's tough for me to compare directly to other games (in spite of how much I love mecha anime), but I really had a blast playing AC6. The speed and fluidity of combat made for high-octane fights with spectacular visual effects and explosions galore. There were definitely some difficult fights, but very few of those fights felt entirely unfair or overly punishing. Just a great time all-around. I'm excited to get my ass kicked by the other final bosses.​\n\n8. Final Fantasy VII (NSW) - 9.5/10 | 3.23.24\n\nFinal Fantasy VII is a crowning achievement of video games that deserves every bit of praise that it receives. Every single aspect of this game is astoundingly good, and without having to make qualifications like \"for its time\" or \"with their resources.\" It's hard to decide where to begin; the story, characters, music, and gameplay are all phenomenal. FFVII's cast is one of my favorites in gaming, and each character has a powerful arc ingrained deeply into the story and narrative. Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, and Barrett form a powerful core cast whose legacies betray how complex, intriguing, and downright funny they are. Which isn't to say that the rest of the main cast—even Vincent and Yuffie, who clearly get the short end of the stick—don't get their own moments to shine. The villains, too, are incredibly varied, and I like all of them in their own ways. The Shinra bigwigs are despicable, but in a \"love to hate them\" kind of way, the Turks are endlessly amusing and have their own sense of pride and responsibility, while Sephiroth and Jenova are villains that represent an evil that lurks just beyond comprehension.\n\nThere are a couple rough spots here and there, of course, but they're largely outweighed by everything that I love about the game. Fort Condor is underbaked at best, for example, and many of the prerendered backgrounds are downright confusing to navigate. Some of the aesthetics are lost in the translation from CRT screens to modern LCDs, and if I play it again, I'd probably want to try out mods that upscale the backgrounds so I can at least read some of the text better. I also think the beginning of the game is undertuned and can largely be brute forced with the attack command, while endgame challenges like the Ruby and Emerald Weapons are lacking in a \"middle ground\" that ramps up to their difficulty. The game throws so much materia at the player that it can be difficult to understand what they all do, much less how to sort through them effectively when wanting to switch things up for each character. However, the materia system overall is a huge improvement over magicite, and the addition of limit breaks really balances out the characters and makes them feel different from each other without being too reliant on magic.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely excited to see what the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy brings to the table. I don't think the original is untouchable, and I'm happy to see them exploring ideas further, but there's an enormous legacy to live up to.​\n\n9. Gearbits (PC) - 6.5/10 | 3.31.24\n\nGearbits is a cross between early Armored Core and Earth Defense Force that's well-worth the cost for 5-6 hours in its main campaign and an endless wave mode, along with plenty of unlockable weapons and mechs. The gameplay is solid, and all the weapons feel like they should; Gearbits is great at encouraging experimentation in a way that AC6 is sometimes lacking, though I would love it if Gearbits included the option to change your loadout between checkpoints. The main campaign has a surprisingly solid story and decent characters, marred by way, way too many grammatical errors for what seems to be an English-original game. The comma splices, spelling errors, incorrect conjunctions, and inconsistent capitalization could all have been improved by most modern spellcheckers, or at the very least a second eye on the script. That aside, I really appreciate how varied the mission types are and the campaign does a good job of making sure the player has to adapt to difficult situations. Some of the later missions against the bug enemies were decently tough! Too many of them on-screen (especially after blowing dozens of them to smithereens at once) does cause some notable frame drops, but they're usually pretty brief and mostly expected for the genre. I'd love to see what the developer does next and hope they can improve on that foundation.​\n\n10. Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood (PC) - "
