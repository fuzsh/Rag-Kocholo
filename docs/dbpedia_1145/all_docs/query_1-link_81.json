        "text": "One consistently interesting thing about covering classic games has been getting to experience “black sheep” entries in otherwise celebrated franchises. Often, I come away having discovered an excellent work that’s been tragically misunderstood. There are still other occasions, sadly, when I’m forced to conclude that the naysayers have the right of it. Which brings me to 1996’s Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble!, the third and final installment in Rare’s landmark primate platforming trilogy for Super Nintendo.\n\nThe first Donkey Kong Country became a phenomenon in 1994 on the strength of its eye-catching CGI render-based graphics, smooth, approachable action, and inspired use of one of the hobby’s most beloved characters. It went on to become the third best-selling SNES game and the single best-selling one not made in-house by Nintendo themselves. Its 1995 follow-up, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest was almost as big a hit at retail and fared even better with reviewers, who cited it as an all-around grander and more polished take on its predecessor’s formula.\n\nIt would be easy to dispute DKC3’s spotty reputation if it was based on sales figures alone. After all, it hit shelves mere weeks before the Super Nintendo’s much-hyped successor, the Nintendo 64. One of the in-game characters, Wrinkly Kong, is even shown playing her N64! Despite that inauspicious timing, it still moved around 3.5 million units, leaving it at a respectable eleventh place overall. Better than the likes of Final Fantasy VI, Super Metroid, or Chrono Trigger, if you can believe that. Critics were generally kind to it as well, with the most common complaint being that it didn’t represent a significant improvement over the excellent DKC2.\n\nNo, strange as it is, I’ve come to the conclusion that DKC3’s reputation as a series low point among certain die-hard fans is down almost entirely to arbitrary aesthetic preferences. Specifically, the generally lighter color palette and tone of the adventure, the design of new player character Kiddy Kong, and the shift in soundtrack style brought on by David Wise ceding lead composer duty to Eveline Novakovic (née Fischer).\n\nAfter Donkey Kong and his sidekick Diddy vanish while exploring a remote new land known as the Northern Kremisphere, Dixie heads off to track them down. She’s soon joined by her baby cousin, Kiddy Kong, and the pair discover that the region is overrun with their old foes, the crocodile-like Kremlings. This time under the leadership of a mysterious new overlord known only as KAOS.\n\nFor the most part, the flow of the quest itself will be familiar enough to veterans of the first two outings. There’s a total of forty platforming stages divided up into eight themed worlds, with each world having its own boss to battle at the end. As in DKC2, accessing the last world necessitates gathering the many bonus coins squirreled away in secret mini-game rooms throughout the journey. Furthermore, viewing the true ending scene requires you to complete not one, but two additional sets of collectables: DK coins and banana birds. You can really see Rare’s obsession with endless scavenger hunts blossoming here, although it wouldn’t reach its full decadent bloom until Donkey Kong 64 three years later. As much as I tend to despise this practice as a general thing, viewing it as egregious padding meant to drive sales of strategy guides, it doesn’t come close to ruining either DKC2 or DKC3. Would I prefer to simply play through all the levels in order without the backtracking rigamarole? Sure. I went ahead and played through them anyway, though, and certainly don’t regret it.\n\nVisually, DKC3 places majority emphasis on the rugged beauty of the Northern Kremisphere setting itself, resulting in fewer of the spooky and industrial type environments seen in DKC2. It’s not that these darker area themes are wholly absent, rather that the idyllic rivers, forests, cliffs, and waterfalls are what primarily comes to mind when I think of a DKC3 stage. At any given moment, you’re more likely to be running, jumping, and climbing your way through a lush pastel nature scene than anything else. I don’t mind this at all, seeing as how it helps give the game its own identity. And regardless of the approach you favor, DKC3’s locations are spectacularly rendered by any measure. As are their inhabitants. The sprite animations in particular are superb. Check out new playable animal buddy Ellie the Elephant’s run cycle if you need any convincing on that front.\n\nAs far as music goes, I’m afraid I’m going to have to be a bit less charitable. These tracks, with the notable exception of the eerie, mesmerizing “Water World” utterly failed to register with me. I’m no musicologist and can’t make any sort of cogent case against them on a technical level. I just know that I seem to forget what they sound like the instant I’m no longer listening to them. That said, they in no way distract me in the moment. As that’s faint praise indeed in the context of a series famous for its music, I’ll go ahead and concede this point to the detractors.\n\nWhen it comes to the maligned Kiddy Kong, I was pleasantly surprised by how little the brat bothered me. Based on his concept and look alone, the odds were stacked against him. Why would I want to control an overgrown baby as the big, strong half of my simian squad when it could be old DK himself? The series is named after him, right? So why only have him playable in one of the first three titles? Once my playthrough was actually underway, however, Kiddy got the job done. True, he was just sort of there and I can’t imagine anyone claiming him as their favorite of the extended Kong family, but he never grated on my nerves.\n\nFinal verdict: With the exception of a lackluster score, I found Donkey Kong Country 3 to be in way inferior to what came before. It delivers one slick, inventive platforming challenge after another all the way through to the end. Well, almost, anyway. The last boss is unfortunately the weakest of a very strong lot. One minute you’re running away from a giant saw as it slices its way up the giant tree you’re climbing, the next you’re dodging red hot volleys from bazooka-toting owls, escorting a ravenous fish that you need to keep fed at all costs, racing against a swarm of killer bees, or guiding your speeding rocket barrel up a mountainside. This wall-to-wall creativity combined with a stellar presentation and the inherent charm of the Kong cast makes for another must-play platformer. Is it better in any meaningful sense than DKC2? Nah. Thankfully, it doesn’t need to be.\n\nCastlevania’s 16-bit period gave rise to some of the saga’s highest-regarded entries. Action-platforming epics like Super Castlevania IV and Rondo of Blood don’t need much in the way of introduction. I’ve covered both previously, as well as the Super Nintendo’s divisive Dracula X. What I’ve yet to do is give the ever-formidable Genesis its due. Well, I’m delighted to finally declare that I’ve been saving the best for last! Sega’s machine was graced with its lone installment, Castlevania: Bloodlines, in 1994 and developer Konami knocked it clear out of the park with this one. Bloodlines weds the typical lush Gothic atmosphere and stunning music the series is famous for with innovative settings, an electrifying set piece approach to level design, and faster, smoother action than ever before.\n\nOn its surface, Bloodlines (also known as Vampire Killer in Japan and Castlevania: The New Generation in Europe) appears to be another stock tale of two vampire hunters, John Morris and Eric Lecarde, fighting through six stages of creepy mayhem on the way to slay Count Dracula. That it is, though it earns bonus points from me for being the only Castlevania game to directly reference Bram Stoker’s 1897 Dracula novel. Bloodlines is set in 1917, twenty years after the events of the book, with John Morris described as the son of Stoker’s Quincy Morris, who the instruction manual goes so far as to claim as a distant descendant of the legendary Belmont family. I could nitpick here, as Quincy was a bachelor with no hint of offspring, but I’d much rather give Konami credit for going there at all.\n\nIn a deliberate inversion of the typical formula, John and Eric start out at Dracula’s castle in Transylvania before going on to pursue his vampire niece, Elizabeth Bartley, west across Europe, hoping to stop her before she’s able to revive her uncle. Thus, we’re treated to levels based (very loosely, of course) on flooded Greek ruins, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a German wartime munitions factory, and the Palace of Versailles. This international angle gave the development team carte blanche to present concepts outside the Castlevania norm. They leaned into it big time, and I’m not just talking about Pisa. While a mere six stages may not sound like much compared to SCIV’s eleven, each location in Bloodlines is massive and composed of many distinct sections with their own unique enemies and environmental hazards. Germany, for example, begins with an approach to the factory where you’re bombarded by skeletons in army helmets popping out of metal drums and chucking bones over a fence in the background. Once inside, you battle regenerating skeletons across a sequence of moving conveyor belts. Next, you must ascend a tight vertical shaft without getting crushed by the giant pistons along its length. After that, a classic clockwork area with giant spinning gears and the staple flying medusa heads awaits. All this, and you’re still not halfway there! Plenty of fresh platforming gimmicks and a mid-boss still stand between you and the next stop on your road trip. It rivals Contra III in terms of sheer “What next!?” factor.\n\nAll this variety is only enhanced by the presence of two playable characters. John wields the fabled Vampire Killer whip passed down by the Belmont clan and therefore plays the most like previous Castlevania protagonists. He has the special ability to whip diagonally upward while jumping, which has applications outside of combat, since it allows him to latch onto ceilings and perform an invincible swing maneuver necessary to cross certain gaps and reach the occasional out-of-the-way item. Eric fights with a magic spear gifted to him by none other than fan favorite dhampir Alucard. The spear offers longer reach than the whip in exchange for dealing slightly less damage. Unlike John, Eric can’t attack upward in the air, He can, however, do so while standing on solid ground. The spear also enables a pole vault jump that’s similar to the whip swing in that its primary function is to enable Eric to access a few alternate routes John can’t. The idea of branching paths is a fine one, even if the game only includes two instances of it. On top of their individual movesets, the pair can find and employ three limited-use sub-weapons: An axe, a boomerang, and holy water. In a flourish lifted from Rondo, a stronger “item crash” variant of each sub-weapon’s default attack is available in exchange for more of the gems that stand in for the usual hearts as ammunition here. Although I tend to find Eric’s reach more generally useful than John’s damage output, both feel powerful, distinct, and relatively balanced. That last bit in particular is something earlier multi-character Castlevania outings Dracula’s Curse and Rondo really struggled with.\n\nIn spite of its world-class levels and thoughtfully balanced heroes, the flow of the action in Bloodlines might be what truly won my heart. Konami resisted the urge to showboat with the sort of massive player sprites that led so many 16-bit action-platformers to feature slower movement and more cramped screen layouts than their 8-bit ancestors. Rather, John and Eric were given NES-like proportions that, in tandem with the Genesis’ famously zippy processor, resulted in the quickest-paced Castlevania yet. It’s hardly Sonic the Hedgehog, mind you, but try booting up Bloodlines immediately after any of the games that inspired it and I guarantee you’ll spot the difference. It all amounts to a substantial, fair challenge that’s a joy to take on.\n\nBloodlines’ brilliant mechanics are bolstered by a remarkable soundtrack courtesy of composer Michiru Yamane in her Castlevania debut. Her “Reincarnated Soul,” “Iron Blue Intention,” and “Calling from Heaven,” all fit in right alongside slick Genesis FM arrangements of such touchstones as “Vampire Killer” and “Bloody Tears.” It’s so good, I had to own it on vinyl. The graphics do their musical accompaniment full justice, with impressive sprite work (that’s also impressively gory unless you’re stuck playing the censored European version for some reason) and a bevy of striking background effects that include reflective water in Greece and a dizzying swaying tower in Pisa.\n\nKonami was close, so achingly close, to realizing a perfect old school Castlevania experience in Bloodlines. What tripped them up mere inches short of the finish line was, of all things, the continue system. Yes, flying in the face of all tradition and good sense, Bloodlines is the sole console entry in the franchise to saddle the player with limited continues. An unwritten rule dating all the way back to 1986 was that no matter how daunting the task of hunting down Dracula grew, you’d never be confronted with a true game over. As long as you refused to give up during that long night, dawn always beckoned. Here, run out of lives three times and it’s back to the title screen with you. It’s a decision so contrary to the Castlevania ethos that it may well have torpedoed the whole production. Thankfully, there is a workaround in the form of the password system. It’s an imperfect one, owing to the fact that passwords record your current life and continue count as well as your progress. Still, it does at least mean that you can treat a password obtained after a clean run through a stage as a de facto save point. It turns a potential deal-breaker into a manageable low grade annoyance, albeit one that was wholly unnecessary in the first place.\n\nPound-for-pound, Bloodlines is my pick for the best overall Castlevania release of its generation. In fact, it sits near the top of my personal series tier list, right below the first and third NES titles. Despite being historically underappreciated relative to its contemporaries, I maintain that it looks and sounds just as superb as Super Castlevania IV and Rondo of Blood while handily outstripping them both in terms of level design, difficulty balancing, and general gameplay feel. Hardly a popular opinion, I admit, but a sincere one based on extensive experience with all the games in question.\n\nSpeaking of sincere, happy Halloween to you all, and congratulations on surviving another October’s worth of spine-chilling game reviews! I hope you’ll join me next week as we resume our regularly scheduled programming.\n\nLast week, I told you about an obscure early survival horror game inspired by the Alien film franchise and released onto a platform not typically associated with the genre. So I figured I may as well switch things up this time and tell you about an obscure early survival horror game inspired by the Alien film franchise and released onto a platform not typically associated with the genre. In space, no one can hear you repeat yourself.\n\nThat’s not to say that Silent Debuggers for TurboGrafx-16 plays anything at all like Alien 3 for Game Boy. It’s a first-person corridor shooter, for goodness’ sake, meaning that it was attempting to blaze multiple trails at once back in 1991. Figures it was developed by Data East, who seemingly never hesitated to get weird with a project. Bless them for that.\n\nThe game’s background is fed to you via an opening cutscene that both sets the mood with its slick old school anime presentation and calibrates your quality expectations for the English localization, which is a rocky one for sure. Stilted phrasing and bizarre grammatical errors abound in this tale of two hot shot space mercenaries (known as “debuggers”) who find more than they bargained for when they board a derelict space station in search of loot. Their job title comes to ironic fruition as they’re sealed in and forced to clear the sprawling structure of the insectoid monstrosities infesting it in order to escape. Worse, they need to do it before the hundred minute self-destruct timer ticks down. All in a day’s work for an ace debugger, right?\n\nOf course, it’s up to you as the unseen and unnamed member of the duo to do all the actual combat. Your self-proclaimed “buddy” Leon spends the whole game parked in a comfy chair in the station’s central computer room, dispensing iffy advice and nuggets of background info relating to the mystery of where all these creepy monsters came from in the first place. He does do a couple useful things for you, though. First, speaking to him allows you to change your current weapon loadout. You can equip one each of the three primary and three secondary weapons to carry alongside your worthless starting pistol. Very rarely, he’ll offer you a new utility item, such as the vitally important jump unit that teleports you across long distances instantly in exchange for a hefty chunk of battery power. It’s worth checking in every now and then when you’re in the area just on the off chance he has some fresh tech for you.\n\nYour general goal across all six stages is to destroy every monster present so you can move on. It sounds easy enough and would be if the developers hadn’t taken pains to saddle you with complications large and small. The most obvious is the time limit itself. A hundred minutes, no more. Likely less, in fact, since every death results in a five minute penalty and a nasty scolding from Leon. If you want to stay alive, you’ll need to make regular runs back to the station’s lone charging room to top off the battery power that doubles as your health and as ammunition for some of the stronger weapons. Other weapons use conventional bullets instead, but don’t expect that to cut down on your legwork, since you can still only reload them by retreating back to the armory. At least you have a reliable map at your disposal.\n\nAs soon as you’ve grown comfortable with managing your time, energy, and ammo, Silent Debuggers introduces yet another complicating factor in the form of a new monster type that launches dedicated attacks on the station’s far-flung facilities. If a single sector takes too much damage before you can get there and eliminate the bug assaulting it, it’ll shut down and remain inaccessible for the remainder of your playthrough. Yes, that includes the aforementioned charging room and armory, not to mention the power plant (forcing you to navigate the twisty halls in the dark) and the sensor array (which causes your handy portable monster detector to periodically crap out on you). I did mention that these resources never come back, right? And just when you’re starting to grow accustomed to this high stakes base defense component, there’s another hitch thrown your way. It’s relentless.\n\nSilent Debuggers has a mixed reputation online, mainly due to how the relatively low number of distinct enemy types contributes to repetitive battles. That, and for how it implements Wizardry-style gridded maze movement instead of the smooth scrolling seen in later efforts like id’s Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. It’s barely a blip on the majority of TurboGrafx-16 ranking lists and although I certainly can’t argue that it’s a brilliant example of a first-person shooter, I did find it to be quite the solid survival horror romp. Its pattern of springing constant insidious surprises on the player continues all the way through to the sixth and final area, making for one masterful white knuckle ride. Losing your lights or sensors over an hour in is utterly brutal. Even if Leon’s gadgets can alleviate the pain a bit, they still take up precious inventory space and thus leave you at a disadvantage.\n\nOn top of being tense, immersive, and sporting respectable graphics and music for the format, Silent Debuggers is also more influential than I might have expected. The way your sensors utilize directional stereo sound to assist you in pinpointing hostile aliens was adopted and refined for Kenji Eno’s 1996 Saturn cult classic Enemy Zero. It’s a shame that this freaky little Data East experiment came and went with all the silence its name implies. I highly recommend it if you’re in the mood for something damn near diametrically opposed to the straightforward, arcadey fare the TG-16 is famous for.\n\nWe all have our holiday traditions. Whether we inherited them from generations past or made them up ourselves yesterday doesn’t matter. What matters is that they’re our very own feel-good seasonal rituals. For the past four years now, my Christmas has doubled as Compilemas: The day I give myself the gift of a new-to-me game by my favorite old school shoot-’em-up developer, Compile.\n\nMy present this year is Sylphia, a 1993 PC Engine Super-CD release with the bittersweet distinction of being the last shooter Compile would work on until Zanac X Zanac in 2001. Sylphia shares similarities with my last year’s selection, Seirei Senshi Spriggan. Both have a fantasy theme and a weapon system based around wielding the four classical elements of earth, air, water, and fire. In Sylphia’s case, however, the fantasy is Ancient Greek flavored and the elemental weapons somewhat less spectacular.\n\nHades, god of the underworld, is ravaging Greece with an army of monsters. The warrior Silphia does her best to defend the populace, but is mortally wounded in the process. The other gods take note of Silphia’s bravery as she lays dying in the temple and she’s reborn in a flash of divine light as a winged fairy with power over the elements. A sylph. Get it?\n\nMythological settings aren’t common to the genre, though neither are they completely unknown. Capcom’s Legendary Wings and Namco’s Phelios went there back in the late ’80s. In any case, it was new territory for Compile and they made the most of it. Silphia’s foes include all the usual suspects: The minotaur, harpy, chimera, sirens, Medusa, Scylla, Cerberus, et al. There are also a few new creations, such as the bizarre dancing puppets of stage two and the human spider abominations shambling through Hades’ lair. The strong enemy design is probably my favorite aspect of Sylphia. Some of these guys look genuinely creepy and intimidating. Plus, nothing drives home the fact that this was a Japanese exclusive like the harpy’s massive bare chest.\n\nGameplay-wise, Sylphia resembles a stripped-down take on Compile’s flagship Aleste series. The four elemental attacks can be leveled up a total of two times by either picking up multiple copies of the same weapon or grabbing enough of the power orbs (better known as power chips in Aleste) that periodically rain down on the battlefield. Silphia also has an invincible super attack that serves as this game’s version of a bomb. You start out with just one of these and can gain more by collecting the jewels dropped by enemies. The only other items to be aware of are the hearts that replenish Silphia’s three-hit health meter.\n\nThe four elemental attacks are all reasonably distinctive and useful. Earth lobs stones that arc up toward the top of the screen before plummeting back down, air creates spiraling energy waves above and below Silphia, fire has homing properties, and water can be shot in any of eight directions as needed. You’ll probably settle on a favorite relatively quickly. Nothing beats the flexibility of water for me. Unfortunately, Sylphia lacks the intriguing mix-and-match element combinations of Spriggan. You can’t create your own custom weapon with the properties of, say, earth and fire. It’s strictly one or the other.\n\nLike predecessors Blazing Lazers and Space Megaforce, Sylphia is notably long for a game of its kind. A perfect playthrough will come in just under an hour. This is a divisive feature of many Compile titles, believe it or not, with some arguing that the pacing suffers at this length. Not me. I’m firmly in the “more is more” camp when it comes to action this compelling. It helps that Sylphia’s eight levels are varied in appearance and often include a change in background after the mid-boss fight. You can expect to see new threats crop up all the time, too, as this isn’t one of those cases where you’re blasting the exact same cannon fodder baddies in every stage.\n\nAnother potential source of criticism is the relaxed approach to challenge that characterizes much of Compile’s work from this period. Sylphia is extraordinarily easy by genre standards. Coming in totally blind, I was able to clear the default difficulty setting on my initial attempt without using a single continue. That’s not because I’m an elite super player or anything. Rather, it’s because the mechanics are weighted in the protagonist’s favor. Weapons are highly effective and power-up quickly. Scoring results in a steady stream of extra lives. Silphia herself is resilient, thanks to the health bar, heart pickups, in-place respawns, and the fact that only running out of health completely will result in any loss of offensive capability. If all else fails, you can fall back on the unlimited continues. The continue screen here is an awesome one, I might add, as it includes the choice malapropism “Silphia has no life.” Burn! Anyway, I think less demanding games have their place. That said, experienced players might want to go for the hard or special hard modes right off the bat.\n\nGraphics and sound are a true mixed bag. Sylphia may be the least visually impressive of all Compile’s 16-bit shooters. Odd, given that it was the last one produced and had the expanded memory of the Super-CD format to draw on. As stated, many of the enemy designs are exceptional. It’s the backgrounds that don’t fare so well. They tend to be flat, plain, and lacking in the animation and fancy scrolling effects that made MUSHA, Spriggan, and Space Megaforce’s scenery so appealing. Sound effects are solid, yet the music is…strange. I’m talking soft synthesized flute, strings, and piano layered over ultra-cheesy early ’90s techno and house beats. I kind of hated it at first. Then I didn’t. Then I starting actually enjoying a few songs. I’m still not entirely sure how I feel about this soundtrack as a whole, but it’s certainly different. That’s got to count for something, eh?\n\nSylphia has a tarnished reputation online. It’s thought to be emblematic of a general decline in Compile’s fortunes around the time of its debut. Several key staff members responsible for great shooting games past had left for greener pastures by 1993, leaving what amounted to a skeleton crew behind. There aren’t any new ideas on display here beyond the mythology angle, the mechanics are bare bones, and I think most would agree that the presentation is a step down from the company’s previous Aleste (and Aleste-inspired) efforts on contemporary hardware. While I can understand this dim view, I consider it a prime example of the perfect as the enemy of the good. Despite living in the shadow of its illustrious peers, Sylphia has earned itself a spot in my rotation. It absolutely nails the timeless Compile overhead shooting formula. It’s fast, furious, and fun without being overwhelming or frustrating. There’s constantly something to shoot, something to dodge, and something to grab, making it a simple matter to kick back and immerse myself in that familiar flow. That’s all I really need for a merry Compilemas.\n\nOn that note, it’s been another fascinating and rewarding year for this passion project of mine, with a grand total of 58 games added the books. I intend to continue my exploration of the hobby’s golden age for as long as my thumbs hold out, so I hope you’ll join me again in 2022. Happy holidays to you all.\n\nI’ve long been fascinated by so-called “black sheep” installments in successful gaming franchises. These are the entries that are almost always spoken of disparagingly. When they’re spoken of at all, that is. Forming my own firsthand opinions of these digital punching bags has proven to be one of the most rewarding aspects of this little writing exercise of mine. I either end up unearthing an unjustly maligned gem (Castlevania: Dracula X) or I arrive at a fuller understanding of the countless ways in which tampering with a winning formula can result in a real dud (Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest). Either way, it’s enlightening.\n\nTo say that Rockman & Forte (better known outside Japan as Mega Man & Bass) is unpopular with Mega Man fans would be a comic understatement. People despise this one! Some of that may be due to first experiencing it via its botched 2002 Game Boy Advance port, which suffers from severe screen crunch that renders the already challenging combat and platforming of the Super Famicom version outright broken. Beyond that, it’s been called out for the supposed lack of balance between its two playable heroes, its wholesale recycling of graphics and enemies from Mega Man 8, and more. Yikes! I can’t wait to dive in!\n\nIf you’re wondering why Rockman & Forte never saw release on the Super Nintendo, it’s almost certainly down to its absurdly late debut in 1998. That’s smack dab in the middle of the PlayStation and N64 era, long past the point where the potential international sales might have justified the expense of localization. In any case, the very idea of a Super Famicom game inheriting art assets from a PlayStation one just blows my mind.\n\nAs the name implies, Rockman and Forte’s main gimmick is having Rock (Mega Man) team up with his villainous rival Forte (Bass) to battle a new robot enemy named King, who’s attempting to unite robots against humanity. Mega Man wants to prevent this for altruistic reasons, of course, while Bass is dispatched by his creator, the evil Dr. Wily, to retake the headquarters King stole from Wily.\n\nThe choice of Mega Man or Bass is an exclusive one and must be made at the start of a new playthrough. The pair present markedly different ways to approach the same set of stages. Mega Man starts out with his iconic slide maneuver and Mega Buster charge shot. Bass’ controls are reminiscent of the newer Mega Man X games, in that he can dash and double jump. Bass also makes up for his lack of a charge shot by being able to aim his rapid-fire Buster in seven directions. In practice, Mega Man’s more damaging Buster gives him an advantage against certain bosses, but Bass’ supreme platforming ability and multi-directional shooting make him the stronger character overall. I’d highly recommend newcomers learn the levels as Bass before attempting a Mega Man run.\n\nPer usual, eight robot masters stand between your chosen hero and the finale. Much to my dismay, Rockman & Forte apes Mega Man 7’s unfortunate tendency to limit your options in terms of the order you can take these guys on in. You’re given a initial slate of three masters to pick from, each of which will grant access to some of the others when defeated. Beating Cold Man, for example, opens the path to Burner Man and Pirate Man’s levels. As stated in my Mega Man 7 review, I don’t understand what taking a defining feature of the series, picking your own path, and arbitrarily limiting it like this is supposed to accomplish other than decreasing the replay value. It’s baffling. Additionally, two masters, Astro Man and Tengu Man, previously appeared in Mega Man 8. They do at least have new attack patterns here, though, so I find this a lot easier to forgive.\n\nRegardless of what order you tackle these stages in, you’re in for a struggle. Rockman & Forte has a well-earned reputation as one of the toughest Mega Man outings. Enemies can dish out a ton of damage and have a tendency to be placed in the most sadistic, borderline unfair spots possible. There’s likely more genuine “gotcha, sucker” enemy placement going on here than in the rest of the classic series combined. Compounding this is the absence of energy tanks, making Rockman & Forte the first Mega Man since the 1987 original to lack these helpful healing items. Your best best is to visit the shop frequently, where you can exchange your bolt currency for much-needed upgrades to your defense and offense. The endgame will prove nearly impossible without smart use of these enhancements.\n\nRockman & Forte can be maddeningly difficult, often for the wrong reasons. The needlessly limited progression irks me, and it shoehorns in a silly CD collection side quest that isn’t worth the effort for the meager reward (a Mega Man trivia gallery). Even so, I’m of a mind that it still has more good points than bad and is ultimately underrated. The Mega Man fan community can be rather solipsistic, in that it tends to consider these games strictly in relation to one another. Would I rank this one particularly high by that standard? No. In the broader context of 2-D action platformers, however, most any Mega Man title is above the curve. This is anything but a bad game in the conventional sense. It controls well, looks stunning (as you’d expect from repurposed next gen graphics), and has an amazing selection of robot master weapons to acquire. Above all, the two character angle pays off well enough to justify a second playthrough. Blasting through the world of classic Mega Man as a bad guy for a change is quite the pleasing novelty. I can’t in good conscience recommend Rockman & Forte to inexperienced players, but veterans who know it only by its dismal rep may be surprised at how much it has to offer.\n\nHey! You forgot the Power Glove!\n\nI had such a memorable time (for better and worse) taking down the NES incarnation of Jason Voorhees last month that I see no reason to let my killer killing streak end there. Next up in my crosshairs is everyone’s favorite extra crispy child murderer, Freddy Krueger!\n\nThis is typically the part of the review where I’d question the wisdom of adapting an R-rated horror franchise to a gaming platform pitched squarely at minors. The Springwood Slasher was well into the high camp Max Headroom phase of his career by 1990, however, and not even us kids were taking him all that seriously anymore. It’s tough to inspire real life nightmares after you’ve guest hosted MTV and covered “Wooly Bully” on your novelty record, you know? That said, this relatively tame action-platformer still had the potential to be much more controversial than it was. Early builds of the game saw the player controlling Freddy himself as he bumped off hapless teenagers. It’s easy to understand why developer Rare and publisher LJN ultimately changed course and reversed these roles.\n\nSimilar to LJN’s Jaws and Friday the 13th, Nightmare presents as a more-or-less genericized version of the basic scenario that defines the movie series. Ghostly psycho Freddy is butchering the children of Elm Street in their dreams as revenge against their parents for burning him to death years back. There are no specific supporting characters depicted who would tie this game to any of the five films released prior, although several key locations and concepts appear to have been lifted from the fan favorite third installment, Dream Warriors. The player assumes control of an unnamed teen who’s looking to end this reign of terror by gathering up Freddy’s bones, which are scattered all over the neighborhood for some unknown reason, and burning them in the furnace situated in the basement of the local high school. While I tackled it alone, Nightmare actually allows up to four players simultaneously via the Four Score and Satellite multitap accessories. If there’s any other platforming game from the period that attempted such a thing, I can’t name it. Four people trying to do pinpoint platforming all at once on the same low resolution screen? Sounds like a recipe for sheer chaos to me. I’d love to try it out someday.\n\nIf you’re one of the many who despised Friday the 13th for its arcane and often poorly-documented strategy gameplay, I have good news for you: A Nightmare on Elm Street is much closer to the conventional idea of what an NES game should be. It doesn’t get much simpler than seven linear stages of increasingly difficult pit jumping and enemy bashing. The only potentially confusing element is Elm Street itself, which acts as a hub area. Fortunately, there isn’t much to it. Finish one stage and you’ll need to trek down the road to the next one and press up to enter its front door. Since only one door is ever active at a time, there’s a minor trial and error element as you try out different buildings.\n\nLevels are broken up into multiple side-scrolling segments, each of which tasks you with collecting a requisite number of bones in order to unseal the exit. You’ll eventually reach the boss room and face off with Freddy, who assumes a variety of strange and occasionally goofy guises to combat you. Beating him earns you access to the next level. It also grants you an extra life. Make the most of these, as this is the only way you can add to your initial stock of twenty. Run out and it’s back to the title screen.\n\nIn a nod to the cinematic Krueger’s oneiric onslaughts, Nightmare includes a sleep mechanic. The red “Zzz” meter at the top of the screen represents your hero’s wakefulness. It slowly decreases with time and allowing it to deplete fully shifts the action to the dream world. The artwork takes on a darker tone here and enemy health is doubled. Level layouts and monster spawn points don’t change, it just becomes harder to kill things.\n\nYou can avoid transitioning to the dream world by picking up the coffee cups present in most stages. You may want to pass on the caffeine, though. Counterintuitive as it seems, the benefits of being trapped in Freddy’s domain arguably outweigh the dangers. Only when sleeping is your rather pathetic default character able to utilize the three powered-up dream warrior forms. There’s an athlete, a ninja, and a wizard. They all offer superior jumping ability and projectiles to replace the puny punch that normally serves as your sole means of attack. Dream world baddies take more hits to kill, sure, but you no longer need to be within arm’s reach of them to deal your damage. The advantage is yours.\n\nThe designers must have realized this, so they threw in one final hazard unique to the dream world: Periodic mini-boss engagements with Freddy. These are always preceded by a chiptune interpretation of the spooky “One, two, Freddy’s coming for you…” song from the movies. They should function as potent incentives to stay awake. In practice, the fights are far too easy and hardly fit for their intended purpose. No, it’s still smarter and more interesting to remain asleep, if you ask me.\n\nIf this all sounds pretty decent, that’s because it is. I was pleasantly surprised by this one, especially considering that it’s long been dogged by the usual “crappy licensed LJN game” reputation. It’s nothing mind-blowing and it absolutely has its shortcomings. The collision detection leaves a lot to be desired at times, with some of your shots passing straight through enemies harmlessly. It punks out big-time at the end by falling back on a boss rush in place of a unique final boss. Above all, it isn’t remotely scary. If you look past the fact that it includes a few Freddy sprites, the experience isn’t any more unsettling than the average Castlevania outing. Friday the 13th, for all its clunkiness, baked some real tension into your high stakes cat-and-mouse game with Jason.\n\nStill, this is a perfectly adequate second string contract work with a smooth difficulty curve, a fun gimmick in the dream warrior abilities, and a sublime soundtrack by David Wise of Donkey Kong Country and Battletoads fame that’s almost certainly too good for the material it supports. A Nightmare on Elm Street likely won’t set your world on fire, or even your boiler room, but it won’t put you to sleep, either. I hope….\n\nThe time has come to realize my destiny as a true innovator. Brace yourselves for this one, folks: I’m going to review the Friday the 13th NES game on Friday the 13th! Now I know how Neil Armstrong felt.\n\nOkay, so it’s not exactly original. I guess the Halloween lover in me just wanted an excuse to get a head start on next month’s annual spooky game roundup. This’ll do.\n\nThere’s a good chance you’re already familiar with this infamous Atlus-developed take on the classic slasher saga. LJN published it exclusively here in North America in February of 1989, between the seventh and eighth movies, and it’s been a magnet for negative buzz ever since. Ask anyone with a knowledge of the NES library beyond Mario and Zelda to rattle off some crappy licensed games and Friday the 13th will usually be at or near the top of the list. For three decades now, it’s been universally panned as confusing, frustrating, and a host of more profane things to boot.\n\nOr has is? Over the past few years, a sustained effort by admirers of the game to re-frame it as a misunderstood survival horror pioneer has gained considerable traction. This led to officially licensed toys modeled on arch-psycho Jason Voorhees’ garish NES color scheme and a hilarious callback to the same in IllFonic’s much better received 2017 Friday game. Could these fans have been right all along? Did critics and the general public alike dismiss Friday the 13th merely for being ahead of its time and refusing to conform to conventional action game stereotypes?\n\nThe debate surrounding this one may be complicated, but at least its plot isn’t. Hockey mask-clad murder machine Jason is running amok at Camp Crystal Lake. A team of six teenage camp counselors must band together to defend themselves and their fifteen young charges from Jason’s onslaught. If Jason does manage to slaughter either all six counselors or all fifteen kids, the game is over. In true slasher movie fashion, “killing” Jason once won’t be enough. He needs to be put down a total of three times over three consecutive days to end his rampage for good.\n\nFriday the 13th isn’t based on any specific entry in the film franchise. That said, savvy horror buffs will spot some obvious nods here and there. The opening animation with the knife penetrating the mask is clearly based on the poster for The Final Chapter and the gameplay itself incorporates several ideas from Part 2. One thing that stands out as odd is the choice of protecting children from Jason as a primary goal. Jason never killed kids on the big screen. The MPAA and other movie rating boards hated the series enough as it was. There’s no way the studios would have antagonized them that blatantly. Although all child death in the game takes place off-screen, it’s still arguably the bleakest concept ever broached on the NES. Kudos to Atlus and LJN for pushing that envelope, I guess.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, Friday the 13th is a sort of strategy/action hybrid. Controlling one counselor at at time and switching between them as needed, the player is tasked with scouring the camp for hidden items required to defeat Jason while also responding in a timely manner to the maniac’s unpredictable attacks on the other characters. Jason’s murder attempts on the kids and non-active counselors in their cabins are frequent, perhaps too frequent, and he can show up on the trails to interrupt your exploration in a more direct way, too. This makes time management the most crucial component of the game. You need to figure out how to the get the stuff you need and then make it happen fast. Unless you’re able to get your hands on more powerful weapons early, the best you can hope for is to drive Jason off temporarily, knowing full well he’ll always return and eventually whittle your beleaguered team down to nothing.\n\nGearing up for battle is no mean feat. As if Jason’s constant harassment wasn’t enough, the only real help the game provides is a hint to try lighting all the fireplaces in the larger cabins. If you can accomplish this with a single counselor, you will indeed be rewarded with a flashlight that reveals secret doors in the cave area. Beyond that one helpful tip, you’re on your own. Learning the ins and out of staying alive long enough to fight back is a protracted trial-and-error process. For example, you’ll soon catch on that not all camp counselors are created equal. Mark and Crissy are vastly better at running and jumping than the rest of the crew, so it’s best to not bother using anyone else for exploration and item gathering. The optimal plan is usually to focus on obtaining the best equipment for Mark and Crissy while stationing the other, more disposable teens as close to the kids as possible so they can act as cannon fodder to repel Jason attacks.\n\nI believe this strategic bent, sketchily-documented as it is, constitutes much of what Friday the 13th’s defenders are responding to when they feel compelled to stick up for it. I say that because it can’t possibly be what passes for action here, which is frankly terrible. Traversing Crystal Lake from a side-view perspective fending off an endless supply of birds, wolves, and out-of-place zombies is wholly unsatisfying in itself. I get why the designers wanted to include some non-Jason baddies. The big guy would rapidly lose his mystique if he had to serve as sole obstacle to your progress. This is a far cry from Mega Man or Ninja Gaiden caliber combat, though. It’s shallow, stiff, and more of a rote chore than anything else.\n\nFighting on the trail may be dull, but it’s a picnic compared to taking on Jason inside the cabins. These encounters utilize an over-the-shoulder third-person view reminiscent of Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! sans any degree of polish or charm. You dodge Jason’s swings and fire back as best you can until he flees or one of you dies. This is doable with a little practice on the first day, when Jason is relatively slow. All bets are off after that, as the masked marauder grows exponentially quicker over subsequent days, eventually becoming nearly impossible to evade. Suddenly, the game’s insistence that you go inside to protect the defenseless kids from Jason makes sense. If they weren’t a factor, venturing indoors at all after day one wouldn’t be worth the risk.\n\nSo, apart from those few cool strategy bits, Friday the 13th is cryptic, punishing, and hamstrung by some truly wretched combat. It would tough to recommend to anyone if it wasn’t for one thing: It’s damn effective survival horror! Yeah, I was surprised, too. Turns out the scramble to prepare for the final showdown with Jason while simultaneously enduring his relentless assaults is laden with genuine tension and an atmosphere of impending doom so thick you could cut it with a machete. As with any proper entry in the genre, you need to play cautiously and exercise good judgement when it comes to managing healing items and other limited resources.\n\nMost important of all for a game based on one of cinema’s premier monsters, Friday the 13th does its villain justice. Jason’s sprites are large and imposing by 1989 standards. He can show up just about anywhere at any time to ruin your day, accompanied by an appropriately startling musical sting. He can kill off one of your hapless counselors in just a few hits and is effectively invulnerable to anything less than the strongest weapons. In short, he lives up to the hype. This makes it immensely satisfying to finally turn the tables on him. As a devotee of the film series, I can’t deny that Friday the 13th is fundamentally faithful to the spirit of its source material. That’s more than I can say for most old licensed games.\n\nBy no means is Friday the 13th a world-class NES release. I’d wager few outside its hardcore following would even rank it among their top hundred games for the system. I maintain it’s miles above true LJN-published travesties like Uncanny X-Men and Bill & Ted’s Excellent Video Game Adventure, however, and worth a fresh look next time you’re in the mood for some 8-bit terror. You may end up hating it, but things could always be worse. You could be watching Jason Goes to Hell.\n\nI was braced for some serious punishment when I stepped through the gates of Milon’s Secret Castle. There’s certainly no shortage of commentators out there eager to denounce this 1986 side-scrolling action-adventure from Hudson Soft as one of the most agonizing times you can have with your NES short of cramming your unmentionables into the cartridge slot. Its bad reputation didn’t start with the Angry Video Game Nerd series this time, either. Early Internet semi-celebrity “Seanbaby” Reiley was dumping on Milon as far back as the late ’90s.\n\nNow that I’ve finished it, I find myself reflecting on what blessed lives these folks must lead if something like this is anywhere near the bottom of their digital shit lists. I’m reminded of the naifs who’ll tell you very matter-of-factly that Ed Wood’s Plan 9 from Outer Space is the worst movie ever made when it’s not even within spitting distance of being Wood’s worst, nevermind the worst. Have these sheltered souls even heard of Monster a Go-Go!? Psyched by the 4-D Witch? Things? I doubt it.\n\nThat’s not to say Milon’s Secret Castle (aka Meikyū Kumikyoku: Milon no Daibōken, “The Maze Suite: Milon’s Great Adventure”) is any sort of misunderstood masterpiece, only that it falls into the same class as stuff like Silver Surfer and Fester’s Quest. These are all indisputably flawed games, perhaps even clunky ones, that are still worth learning if you’re patient and relish a challenge. Are they underrated? Sure, but only in light of the absurd amount of abuse hurled at them. In a less hyperbolic climate, they’d be considered pretty okay-ish. I suppose there’s comparatively little entertainment value in an assessment like that, though.\n\nSo who’s Milon? He’s a young boy from the modestly-named land of Hudson. All of his countrymen rely on music to express themselves, but poor Milon is apparently tone deaf or something, since he alone lacks this ability. Despondent, he sets out on a journey to find others like himself. He soon comes across Castle Gardland, which has been invaded by the warlord Maharito. This fiend has stolen the people’s musical instruments and imprisoned Queen Eliza within the depths of her own castle. Milon volunteers to save her and is given an enchanted bubble blower by the castle’s magician to use as a weapon against Maharito’s demons.\n\nWith “secret” right there in the title, it should come as no surprise that the majority of Milon’s quest revolves around discovering the many hidden passageways and items tucked away throughout the castle. Doing this will gradually reveal the lairs of seven boss monsters. Defeating them and obtaining the crystals they leave behind will power-up Milon and, eventually, open the way to Maharito’s inner sanctum.\n\nVirtually everything in this game is presented as a secret, regardless of how illogical that can be at times. Whenever Milon enters one of the castle’s sprawling multi-screen rooms, for example, he won’t be allowed to leave until he discovers the hidden exit. You’d naturally expect him to be able to exit at any time via the same doorway he just entered through. Silly you with your common sense. The go-to method for revealing all these secrets is to shoot up as much of the scenery as possible with Milon’s bubbles. This will uncover hidden doors, money needed to acquire items in shops, honeycombs that expand Milon’s health bar, and more. The instruction manual tells you this much.\n\nWhat the instructions don’t see fit to mention is that Milon can also shove certain blocks aside in order to discover doors hidden behind them. In fact, you can’t progress past the very first section of the game without doing this. Worse yet, Milon has no dedicated pushing animation, so it’s possible a player may actually attempt this out of desperation only to give up after not holding the D-pad down quite long enough. It took me nearly an hour to get past this classic beginner’s trap, which is easily more time than I spent on any of the game’s later puzzles. This total failure on Hudson’s part to provide basic information on a key gameplay feature is what led to the infamous “Getting Started” feature in Nintendo Power’s Classified Information column, a space typically reserved for advanced strategies and esoteric codes.\n\nWhether you chalk it up to ignorance or malice, I believe this single egregious blunder is responsible for countless bad first impressions of the game over the years. Once I finally figured it out (and roundly cursed the team at Hudson’s mothers when I confirmed the problem wasn’t on my end), the rest of the journey was relatively smooth sailing. I quickly fell into a rhythm of scouring each new room for hidden stuff, finding items, and taking down bosses. I still died a ton, of course, as the enemies infesting this castle don’t mess around. They attack relentlessly and respawn almost instantly when destroyed. Milon also doesn’t enjoy any significant post-hit invincibility window, so baddies can quickly pile on loads of damage if they manage to make contact. You have unlimited continues, thankfully, although they don’t kick in until after you defeat the first boss for some odd reason. This keeps the game beatable in spite of its non-stop brutal combat. Alas, no save or password system is provided. You’ll need to tackle this one in a single sitting.\n\nSetting its cryptic structure and formidable difficulty aside for the moment, Secret Castle’s dismal reputation among NES enthusiasts is also likely due in part to the quirks of its release schedule. Its Famicom debut in late 1986 came a mere handful of months after The Legend of Zelda and Metroid put console action-adventure/RPG games on the map. It thus predates Tecmo’s Rygar, Konami’s Castlevania II, and most other third party efforts in that vein. Its release on the NES nearly two full years later effectively robbed it of its head start and left it looking somewhat primitive next to the competition at a time in gaming history when the state of the art was advancing at lightning speed. Call it the Hydlide Effect.\n\nI’m not about to tell you that Milon’s Secret Castle is as great as its first party predecessors or the majority of those more sophisticated post-1986 takes on the same concepts I just mentioned. The fierce challenge and need to constantly probe every square inch of the environment for secrets simply won’t appeal to everyone. Its lack of a save feature can also represent a daunting time commitment to newcomers, a gaffe that was remedied by the welcome addition of passwords to the 1993 Japanese Game Boy port. What it does have to offer is cute, colorful graphics in that timeless flat early NES style, a catchy (if limited) soundtrack, and a lovable protagonist with a whimsical and intriguing world to explore.\n\nI guess I can’t help but root for this plucky, bubble blasting kid. He’s an outsider and an underdog, both in his own native fantasy world and NES fandom at large, but he never lets it bring him down. It doesn’t matter if he’s getting dissed and dismissed for his musical incompetence or his supposedly crappy first game; that happy-go-lucky grin of his can weather any storm. Why hate when you can be like Milon?\n\nThe fools! They said I was mad! Mad! Well, I’ll show them! I’ll achieve both endings in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde! Two full playthroughs! And it will be the more difficult Famicom version with its extra levels and enemies! Then we’ll see who’s mad! Ahahahahaha!\n\nWhew! Sorry. I don’t know what came over me there. Just had to get that out of my system, I guess. I’m alright now. Really.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson’s 1886 work Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has an awful lot going on in and around it for a short novella. This tragic tale of an upstanding London physician who seeks to free himself from his base, “evil” impulses through means of an experimental chemical concoction has seemingly attracted as many interpretations over the years as it has readers. There’s the classic psychological take, of course, which posits that Jekyll’s stubborn insistence on denying and suppressing his shadow side rather than healthily integrating it into his greater personality was his ultimate undoing. Many also cite it as condemnation of rigid Victorian social mores, where an outward façade of performative respectability frequently masked the messy reality of the human condition. It’s also been approached as an addiction allegory, a commentary on the British class system, a symbolic representation of the relationship between England and Stevenson’s native Scotland, and more.\n\nIt’s enough to make you wish you could reach back through time and interrogate the author himself in order to determine what he really had in mind. In this same vein, I’d love to be able to ask the uncredited development staff at Advance Communication Company what they were thinking when they birthed their 8-bit adaptation of Stevenson’s opus onto the Famicom over a century later in 1988. In its own bizarre way, their Jekyll Hakase no Houma ga Toki (“Dr. Jekyll’s Hour of the Wandering Monstrosity”) is almost as difficult to pin down as its literary inspiration.\n\nHouma ga Toki (which I’ll refer to using its North American title from this point on for simplicity’s sake) is a truly a game unlike any other for the system. This isn’t just because it’s a case of a 20th century Japanese video game developer drawing on 19th century English language literature for inspiration, either. This happened more often than you might think. Two completely unrelated games based on The Adventures of Tom Sawyer hit the Famicom in 1989 and consulting detective Sherlock Holmes also made multiple appearances on the platform. No, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is special because it’s the earliest example I can cite of a developer attempting to use the medium of gameplay itself to depict a conflict taking place within a fictional character’s psyche. Despite its very real flaws and horrendous reputation online, the mere fact Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of all things pioneered techniques which would make critical darlings of titles like Silent Hill 2 and Celeste decades later is worthy of acknowledgement and, I dare say, respect.\n\nAs usual, though, I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. At first glance, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appears to be that most common of things: An 8-bit side-scrolling action-platformer. The plot focuses on Henry Jekyll’s attempt to make his way across town on foot from his laboratory to the church in order to attend his own wedding to his fiancée Millicent, an apparently mundane task which will still end up taxing the player’s skill and patience to a prodigious degree. Incidentally, this notion of Jekyll having a love interest named Millicent is a clear reference to the 1920 silent film version by Paramount Pictures. This is the only instance I spotted of a callback to any other specific prior adaptation of the tale.\n\nTo reach the church, Jekyll has only to walk from left to right across a total of six stages representing different parts of town. These include a village, parks, a graveyard, and several different street scenes. These stages themselves are the reason I recommend you skip the 1989 North American version of the game altogether and stick to the Famicom original. For unknown reasons, publisher Bandai opted to remove two entire levels from the NES release and fell back on lazy repeats of the village and cemetery areas to pad the final product out to an acceptable length. That’s a full third of the game gone! Most speculation I’ve see about this change centers on a specific lady character who appeared in the cut levels and would beckon Jekyll into her home to restore his lost health off-screen. It’s thought Bandai staff may have been concerned this would be perceived as an illicit sexual encounter and consequently run afoul of Nintendo of America’s strict family friendly content guidelines. Personally, I’m not entirely convinced. Why would this necessitate removing whole stages instead of just the offending character? Why would it be a problem at all when Nintendo had already famously included a virtually identical suggestive healing scenario in their own Zelda II: The Adventure of Link? We may never know for sure. In any case, avoid the butchered NES release at all costs.\n\nNo matter which version you’re playing, you’ll find Dr. Jekyll’s walk in the park to be, well, no walk in the park. There’s a veritable mob of relentless enemies standing between him and wedded bliss. In an amusing twist on the usual action game formula, the majority of them are not out to harm Jekyll per se. Instead, most of the threats he’ll encounter simply annoy the good doctor. He’ll be forced to confront obstacles like pushy pedestrians, bratty kids with slingshots, defecating birds, pesky insects, ill-tempered dogs and cats, a gravedigger carelessly tossing clots of dirt over his shoulder, and a terrible singer who fills the screen with hazardous musical notes. Most of these deal little to no damage to Jekyll’s health meter and instead fill up a second “stress” meter on contact. Maybe it’s because I use public transportation a lot in real life, but I find Jekyll’s struggling to keep his temper in the midst of his boorish neighbors to be extremely relatable. Play as Jekyll is completely defensive in nature, with the player striving to reach the end of the level while ducking or jumping over hazards and taking on as little stress as possible. There’s no fighting back, apart from the option to use the doctor’s cane to swat the occasional stinging bee out of the air. When the stress meter inevitably fills up completely, Jekyll will fall prone and assume the form of his alter-ego Hyde.\n\nThe Hyde half of the game bears much more resemblance to a conventional action title. That said, it remains deeply odd in its own way. The setting shifts from a sunny morning in jolly old England to a darkened wasteland of dilapidated ruins populated by vicious monsters. The instruction manual refers to this place as the World of Demons and careful observation reveals it has the exact same layout as the normal London of Jekyll, just redrawn in a more menacing style and scrolling in reverse from left to right. Think of it as a twisted mirror image, not unlike Edward Hyde himself. I can’t help but wondered if this World of Demons and its inhabitants is intended to be a real place or if these levels are simply a symbolic representation of Jekyll’s “inner demons.” I lean toward the latter interpretation, but it will likely remain a mystery indefinitely unless one of the game’s anonymous creators steps out of the shadows for an interview someday.\n\nThe screen scrolls automatically for Hyde, which is potentially quite dangerous. If he should ever reach the spot in the World of Demons corresponding to where Jekyll transformed, he’ll be killed instantly by a bolt from heaven, as this apparently represents evil triumphing over good. Before this can happen, he’ll want to kill as many demons as possible. Each one destroyed will lower the stress meter and emptying it completely will trigger the return to Jekyll form and the world of daylight. Playing as Hyde is therefore all about killing as much as possible as quickly as possible. Hyde has two attacks at his disposal: A basic short range punch and a boomeranging fireball attack called the Psycho Wave which can be tricky to aim at times, but is a much stronger option overall. You’ll also need to make sure you minimize contact with the enemy while you’re blasting away, since all damage in the World of Demons is deducted from the health meter and if it runs dry, the game is over.\n\nThis regular cycling between passive avoidance and furious aggression is what constitutes the core of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde experience. You persevere the best you can as poor put-upon Jekyll, getting pestered, bullied, and literally shit on (in the case of those birds) at every turn until you just can’t take it anymore and unleash your raging id in the form of Hyde to rampage all the pent-up stress away. Just make sure Hyde never gains the upper hand for too long or you’ll regret it. All bets are off in the sixth and final stage, however. Here, the rule prohibiting Hyde from outpacing Jekyll is suspended and it becomes an all-out race to the finish. Whichever persona reaches the church in their version of reality first is the victor and the player then receives one of two different endings.\n\nIf you’ve never actually played the game before and don’t recognize it from its appearances on countless “worst of the NES” lists, you may well come away from my introduction and summary thinking it sounds pretty fantastic. Unique and varied gameplay? Intriguing themes? Wicked sense of humor? Formidable challenge? These are all present, to be sure. Jekyll and Hyde even looks and sounds the part thanks to some nicely detailed graphics and an atmospheric score by Michiharu Hasuya (the only individual confirmed to have contributed to the game) that lend both the light and dark versions of London considerable presence. It’s only when you sit down with controller in hand and attempt to actually enjoy all of this that cracks start to show as the game gradually unveils its own hidden evil streak.\n\nFirst, we have glaring control issues which leave each character hobbled in his own blatantly unnecessary way. Dr. Jekyll is undoubtedly one of the slowest characters in gaming history and far too much of the challenge stems from the fact that he can never manage more than a stiff waddle regardless of how much mayhem there is to dodge in his immediate vicinity. Now, I do feel I understand and appreciate the intent of the Jekyll gameplay. The developers are deliberately baiting you, trying to make you feel just as harried and irritated as your defenseless avatar. You “win” these sections by not taking the bait and remaining cool and calm as you patiently navigate the maze of enemies and hazards in your path. To excel as Jekyll, you have to think like Jekyll and retain your composure in the face of every setback. I get it, but it’s still no excuse. I’m confident this idea could have still been effectively realized even if Jekyll were able to move around at an acceptable pace. His agonizing slowness smacks of padding and not an essential design element.\n\nOn the other hand, Hyde’s weakness is not his speed, but the clunky way the game restricts him to moving about within a limited area. There’s a sort of invisible wall running down the center of the screen which confines Hyde to the right side at all times. This is not only arbitrarily constricting, it also leads to bad outcomes in the few areas where it’s necessary for Hyde to leap over holes in the ground. If he should bump into the unseen barrier while in the air, it can funnel him straight down into the gap.\n\nTerrible enemy placement is another constant problem. The Jekyll sections are guilty of overusing one specific baddie to the point of absurdity: The Bomb Maniacs. These jerks appear in droves in every single stage to plant bombs right in the doctor’s path. The bombs themselves deal by far the most health and stress damage of anything in the game and their blasts must be evaded at all costs. To do this, Jekyll will usually need to turn around immediately and trudge back the way he came. The result of all this is an already ludicrously slow protagonist being bogged down even more. It’s sometimes possible for minutes to go by with the screen not advancing so much as an inch as a fresh Bomb Maniac continually appears the instant the previous one’s bomb finishes exploding. Adding insult to injury, the explosions themselves are as deceptive as they are devastating due to having hit boxes massively larger than their on-screen graphics. Jekyll can be standing inches away from the blast and still receive damage. Again, the Hyde levels have their share of sloppiness, too. Fast moving flying enemies can sometimes spawn in right behind Hyde when he’s near the top of the screen, leaving him effectively no time to dodge them.\n\nThis all obviously comes off as highly inconsiderate and amateurish design, but the restrictive movement and nasty enemy placement aren’t even the game’s biggest flaws for me. No, what hurts it more than anything else is simply that’s it’s terrible at communicating its own rules. Similar to Atari’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, this a game that’s impossible to pick up and enjoy without a thorough understanding of its many unorthodox mechanics. This, along with the bandwagon effect, are the primary reasons for its exaggerated infamy. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde isn’t a Super Mario Bros. style experience where you can just shove the cartridge in, power on, and start having fun. No, you need to read the instructions first. It wouldn’t be so bad if the ones provided were competently done. Unfortunately, even the official manual omits key information.\n\nTake Jekyll’s cane, for example, which is often dismissed as being useless except for swatting bees. The cane’s other function goes completely unremarked upon in the manual. To wit, you can whack pedestrians with it in order to increase Jekyll’s stress level. Why would you ever want to do this? Because there are times when it can actually be beneficial or even necessary to transform into Hyde, as successfully completing a Hyde section of the game refills the health meter and clears away all enemies and obstacles which were on the same screen as Jekyll when he initially transformed.\n\nSimilar confusion surrounds Hyde’s punch. It seems at first like it’s simply a weak attack that’s completely superfluous in light of the Psycho Wave. What the manual doesn’t tell you is that the punch is primarily a defensive tool. It can deflect many enemy projectiles if timed properly. This application is so obscure and non-intuitive that I didn’t even stumble across it until after I’d already completed the entire game twice! Perhaps most negligent of all, there’s no indication anywhere in the North American instructions that the standard rule about Hyde not being able to progress further than Jekyll no longer applies in the final stage. There’s no logical reason the player should expect this to be the case, so you would think it to be at be least be worth mentioning. Nope. Without knowing this, it’s unlikely most players would ever encounter the final boss as Hyde and receive the better of the game’s two endings. Just awful. To its credit, the manual for the Famicom version does at least hint at how to achieve the Hyde ending, although it does an equally poor job of explaining the cane and punch.\n\nWant to know the strangest fact of all regarding this case? I quite enjoyed Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde! Enough to recommend it to any patient, open-minded gamer up for a challenge. Despite what you may have heard, the more complete Famicom version is a long way from being from the worst option available for the system. Sure, it’s needlessly opaque and it burdens its players with some profound balance and control issues. If you somehow manage to make peace with all this, though, you may just find yourself won over by its creepy mood, quirky humor, and groundbreaking take on the psychological themes of its source material. Imperfect as it is, somebody behind the scenes was working from a vision and it shows. After all, only Jekyll can reach the final stage of the game, yet he must ultimately accept the duality of his existence and enlist the help of Hyde in order to achieve the best ending. Carl Jung would be proud. If anything, I’d classify this one as an acquired taste and place it in the same “weird, maddening fun” box as Fester’s Quest and Silver Surfer. It probably won’t be your cup of tea, but you’d be doing yourself a disservice by not at least trying a sip.\n\nYes, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is equal parts trick and treat, so on that note: Happy Halloween to one and all! It’s going to be a long next 364 days….\n\nI feel you, kid. Even in castle full of vampires, having to watch your sibling make out is the real horror.\n\nOctober is finally here and let me tell you: After one of the most brutal, forest fire plagued summers in Northwest history, it is so welcome. It’s high time for some chill winds, falling leaves, and spooky media. Out with the old and in with the boo, baby! Over the course of the month, I’ll be showcasing a total of six horror-themed games for six different platforms. Some will be good and some bad. Some famous and some virtually unknown. Stir in a few misfits too weird to pigeonhole and it makes for a potent witch’s brew indeed. Enjoy.\n\nFirst up on my dance card is 1995’s Castlevania: Dracula X for the Super Nintendo, also called Vampire’s Kiss in Europe. As fans of this long-running Konami series know, the Castlevania family tree can be considered to have split early on into two main branches. These would be the straightforward action-platformers patterned on the 1986 original and the action RPG entries that got their start in 1987 with Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest. Until recently, I was mostly acquainted with the RPG side of the franchise. This changed last year when I played through the first game, Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse, Super Castlevania IV, and Castlevania: Bloodlines over the span of ten days in a sort of Actionvania mini-marathon. I came away with a whole new appreciation for their distinctive blend of weighty high stakes platforming and treacherous enemy placement. Sound judgement and expert timing are mandatory if you’re to have any chance of surviving the long night and putting Dracula down for the count. I can now say these entries in the series may well collectively comprise my single favorite classic gaming experience.\n\nGiven that Dracula X is cast from this very same action mold, I was naturally excited to dive in. At the same time, I was also somewhat leery, owing to its black sheep reputation. Dracula X is a game doomed by circumstance to disappoint critics and fans alike at the time of its debut. Series obsessives who were following the news of overseas releases were expecting a more or less faithful port of the Japanese PC Engine CD-ROM title Akumajou Dracula X: Chi no Rondo (better known in the West as Rondo of Blood). The casual player base expected it to play like the previous Super Nintendo entry, Super Castlevania IV, with its eight-way whip attacks and more forgiving platforming mechanics. Few seem to have been primed to be satisfied with what Dracula X actually is at heart: A prettied up rendition of the simpler, tougher NES Castlevanias.\n\nKonami themselves surely bear some responsibility for the misunderstanding. Dracula X shares a basic storyline and many art assets with Rondo of Blood, which made it nearly impossible for gamers in 1995 to draw a meaningful distinction between the two based on plot summaries and screenshots alone. Make no mistake, though: The differences are legion. Without the comparatively massive storage space afforded by the CD-ROM format, the voiced cut scenes and Red Book audio of Rondo were a technical impossibility. Dracula X’s nine stages are also completely different from the eleven included in Rondo and players are limited to controlling a single character, Richter Belmont, with Rondo’s Maria Renard being demoted to NPC status. While the core gameplay in both entries remains quite similar, Dracula X represents a clear downgrade in terms of overall scope when held up alongside its inspiration and to this day there’s no shortage of commentators eager to remind anyone within earshot of this fact.\n\nWith over a quarter century of hindsight at my disposal, however, I’d like to make a case for Dracula X as not merely a tragic mangling of Rondo, but a perfectly enjoyable and worthy Castlevania adventure unto itself. Granted, it’s also possible I’m either a softhearted fool or a hardheaded contrarian. I’ll lay out my case and let you be the judge.\n\nFor starters, Dracula X’s plot is quintessential Castlevania: Dracula has risen from his grave! This time, it’s in 1792, a century after his previous defeat by the legendary vampire hunter Simon Belmont. Drac still seems to be holding a grudge, because he promptly orders an attack on the home town of Simon’s descendant Richter. The city is destroyed and Richter’s girlfriend Annette and her sister Maria are hauled off and imprisoned deep within the evil Count’s lair. Undaunted, Richter sets off for Demon Castle Dracula with only his holy Vampire Killer whip in tow to rescue his loved ones and fulfill his destiny as a Belmont. Standard stuff, but it’s interesting to note that Maria has been recast as Annette’s sister in this entry rather than a distant relative of Richter as in Rondo of Blood. Why, I have no clue. Surely good guy Richter would be equally inclined to rescue her from Dracula in either case?\n\nThe march to Dracula’s throne room takes place over seven side-scrolling levels. This makes Dracula X slightly longer than the NES original or Bloodlines on the Sega Genesis, but significantly shorter than Dracula’s Curse, Super Castlevania IV, or Rondo of Blood. A bit of extra replay value is furnished in the form of two hidden alternate stages Richter can progress through in lieu of their regular counterparts, provided you can find them. A minimum of three playthroughs are therefore required if you want to see every level in the game and all three endings. Three endings? That’s right. The one you receive depends on whether you manage to rescue one, both, or neither of the kidnapped girls. It’s still not as much content as in those beefier entries mentioned above, but neither is it notably lacking by series standards.\n\nRichter controls almost exactly as he did in Rondo of Blood, with a no-frills horizontal whip attack and short, stiff jump arc reminiscent of his granddaddy Simon’s. He can also find and wield the same classic set of sub-weapons. Per usual, the dagger, axe, holy water, cross boomerang, and magic stopwatch all require you to expend some of the limited supply of hearts you collect by whipping the candles and lanterns dotting each stage. While not capable of the elaborate whip stunts seen in Super Castlevania IV, Richter does bring some new tricks to the party. He can perform a quick back flip dodge by double-tapping the jump button (just make sure you’re not facing away from a bottomless pit first…), jump onto and off of staircases, and utilize the mighty item crash. This last ability is particularly important, being a sort of “super move” with varying effects based on the sub-weapon Richter is currently carrying. It requires anywhere from 10-20 hearts per activation, but usually deals heavy enough damage to be worth the price. For this reason, it’s often in your best interest to save any many hearts as possible for the end stage boss fights. The item crash also doubles as an emergency evasion technique, as Richter is rendered invulnerable for a brief period at the start of one.\n\nDracula X really steps out of its inspiration’s shadow and starts making a name for itself with its cunning level design and drop-dead stunning presentation. As mentioned above, every stage layout is unique to this release and each is significantly more challenging on average than its closest equivalent in Rondo of Blood. The platforming is trickier, requiring more pixel-perfect jumps, and it’s complicated by some of the most devious enemy placement in the entire series. Wherever it is you need to be at a given moment, there always seems to be one of Dracula’s ghoulish minions already occupying that exact portion of the screen, ready to knock you back into the nearest bottomless pit if the timing of your movements and attacks is so much as a split-second off. Like Dracula’s Curse, this one was clearly designed with Castlevania veterans in mind. If you’re a newcomer looking to ease into the series, Dracula X is far from your best bet. Try Super Castlevania IV instead. If you do happen to be a battle scarred veteran vampire killer like myself, however, this almost ROM hack-like level of difficulty may be just the sort of thing you thrive on and constitute a major selling point.\n\nNext, consider the superlative graphics. For my money, Dracula X is among the best looking of all the 16-bit Castlevania titles. Most of the character sprites are lifted directly from Rondo, but the new backgrounds are another story. They’re rendered using a bright watercolor style that’s oddly well-suited to making the Gothic horror subject matter really pop. The result of this unlikely combination is a lush, painterly game world that represented a high point for the series at the time.\n\nThe soundtrack is also no slouch. The compositions themselves are essentially the same ones from Rondo re-imagined for the Super Nintendo sound chip. The transition from CD-ROM to low-fi chiptunes certainly seems like a losing proposition. Fortunately, this is the freakin’ Super Nintendo we’re talking about here and the majority of the tracks actually come across better than their PC-Engine counterparts! Any hardcore Rondo partisans still reading at this point are probably gnashing their teeth, but you guys just listen to that insanely funky bass line in the Dracula X version of “Opposing Bloodlines” and then tell me it’s not the sickest thing. Go ahead, try it. I dare you.\n\nPlease don’t misunderstand me here. I’m not saying this is secretly the best game in the series. I’m not even saying it’s better than Rondo of Blood, although I do sometimes prefer it for the added challenge. What I am saying is that the humble Dracula X is no botched port or black mark on the saga, but a damn fine 16-bit action-platformer by any reasonable standard. While it’s relatively short and far from newbie friendly, it should please any established fan of the tough-as-coffin-nails old school incarnation of Castlevania. Prices for original cartridges are topping $160 as of this writing, however, so do take care lest this creature of the night suck your wallet dry."
