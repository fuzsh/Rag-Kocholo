        "text": "I also had a cleaning kit! The contacts would have a build up, from the contacts becoming oxided I think, and would have black stuff on them. Once the cartridges and the loading mechanism were cleaned I wouldn't have to blow on a cartridge for a month or so.\n\nYeah, I had something like this too:\n\nPretty much just an empty cartridge with an alcohol-soaked cloth on it. Those systems definitely did build up a lot of grime because the cleaning carts always came out dirty, but I still don't think dirt/dust buildup was usually what was actually causing the problems... though it obviously didn't help. (And of course, if your house was anything like mine, there was always plenty of cigarette smoke around and we had a wood stove on top of it, plus plenty of rental cartridges... I guess it's no wonder the things picked up so much gunk.)\n\nUnless you mean a \"reasonable price\" for the arcade version, the NES version of part one shouldn't be all that pricey (though part 2 might cost a bit more since it came out fairly late in the system's life).\n\nMy parents never ever offered me rewards - ie; shovel the snow and I'll give you $5, or I'll give you $20 for every passing grade. I was just expected to do chores and to do well in school.\n\nSome friends got NES for xmas in 85 and I was blown away. I had to have one of my own. I harassed my mother relentlessly. So she told me that if I got \"all Es\" on my report card (E was the highest score you could get when I was in Grade 3), that she would buy me one.\n\nI couldn't wait for the last day of school in June. They handed out the report cards, and I indeed got all Es. I raced home and off we went to the nearby Zellers. We grabbed the basic system with Super Mario, plus Rad Racer, Hoops and T&C Surf Designs Wood and Water Rage.\n\nMy mom also told me she would never ever offer me a reward again, and she kept her word. I hated this as a kid, because all my friends were always offered bribes/rewards... but in the long run, it made me a much better person.\n\nAs somone else already mentioned, I fondly remember playing NES in our cool basement when it was too hot in the summer.\n\nMy fav games were Super Mario, Mario 3, Punchout, RBI Baseball, Tecmo Bowl/Super Tecmo Bowl, 1942/43, Legendary Wings, Contra, Bubble Bobble, Adventures of Bayou Billy, Adventure Island, RC Pro-Am/Super RC Pro-AM, Double Dragon, and Castlevania.\n\nI'm also the only person I know who owned Chubby Cherub, considered one of the worst NES games ever.\n\nI still have my NES, and it works, but most of my good games were cherry picked by my younger cousins in the mid-90s when I moved onto Sega Genesis.\n\nSMB, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out and certainly Tecmo Bowl were fond memories. In our Tecmo league play with the Raiders and Chiefs were banned lest Bo Jackson or Christian Okoye would run away to certain victory. I still have a couple of units (standard and top loader) and have picked up games used over the years when I see them for cheap and probably have close to 500 NES games now. If you get the special triangle bit to open up the game cartridges then cleaning the contacts to avoid the flashing lights is easy and effective. Simply open the cartridge and using a pencil eraser to clean the contacts followed up by a quick Q-tip cleaning using rubbing alcohol and reassembling the cartridge will work almost all of the time.\n\nI was selling for JC Penney at that time, in the Electronics department, while also working part-time in my first radio gig.\n\nWe sold a crapload of cartridges back then, and replacement joysticks. Best part, Penney's was aggressively pursuing moms & dads,\n\nso we had a big NES display right up front (right next to the RCA Selectavision...which seldom worked... ), and whenever the\n\nbig-name cartridges came out, we were always the first in the Mall to have 'em. And get to play them (\"'cause, I gotta be able\n\nto demonstrate 'em to Mom, boss...!\").\n\nThe week we did our big Pac-Man release, I went into the radio production studio, and taught myself how to remove vocals\n\nfrom a record, to make my own re-sing of \"Pac Man Fever\", loaded with Penney's references. That thing played full-bore all\n\nthrough the store for days afterwards!\n\nNow playing on Ariel Stream: Weekend Players w/Rachel Foster - I'll Be There"
