Originators: No amount of thanks warrants the help John Harper and Sean Nittner provided. We are infinitely grateful for your time, patience, mentoring, championing, and help. Layout: I wouldn’t have had the courage to even try learning layout without the 4am conversations with Brennen Reece at Metatopia. He taught me that sometimes you have to change words for layout. Also heartfelt thanks to John Harper, who kept correcting my sheets. And Sean Nittner, who suggested books late one night, and was always willing to lend eyeballs for all my attempts. Special Thanks: Mel and Jeff “Nunch” Johnston­­—without whom “Blasters in the Dark” would not have existed to grow up and become this game, and who encouraged us to give the pitch even when I was unsure. The Original Playtesters: Jeff, Heather, Phil, and Ed—who jumped into games without hesitation, and who remain the best folks to playtest with. Without them I wouldn’t have been nearly as involved in Blades. The Best Tuesday Night Crew: Mike, Nick, Dante, Dylan, Alice, Lou, and Christian—who put up with nonsense every Tuesday. The Tablenauts: Ali Acampora, Andi Claire, Andrew Lee Swan, Art Martinez-Tebbel, Jack De Quidt, Janine Hawkins, Keith J Carberry, and the amazing Austin Walker—thanks for showing everyone how to boldly go and really make this game their own. Many Thanks for the Additional Proofing: Ammar Ijaz, Aske Lindved, Ben Liepis, Blaine Flowers, Brock McCord, Bryan Lotz, Chris Whetstone, Council Caller, Dave Weinstein, David Barrena, Declan Feeney, Heavenly Evan, Matt Hill, Neil Smith, Roe Portal, Scott Wheelock\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Appendix N: We list media inspirations on page 4.

1\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nTHE GAME\n\nScum and Villainy is a game powered by Blades in the Dark about the crew of a spaceship, trying to keep flying and make ends meet while under the iron-fisted rule of the Galactic Hegemony. There are heists, chases, escapes, unwise deals, blaster fights, deceptions, betrayals, victories, and high adventure among the stars.\n\nWe play to find out if our spaceship crew can thrive amidst the teeming threats of powerful criminal syndicates, warring noble families, dangerous aliens, strange mystics, ruins of lost civilizations, and each crew member’s own foibles and vices.\n\nTHE SETTING The year is 1261 since the founding of the Galactic Hegemonic Alliance. The Hegemony united the warring factions of the galaxy out of the Dark Age that preceded it. Near the center of the galaxy lies the seat of the Hegemon, who rules with the Grand Council—a consortium of powerful families, greedy merchant Guilds that control entire categories of technology, and the heads of powerful state-sanctioned Cults. The Procyon sector, however, is too many jumps away from the Core to matter to those important players. There are a few wellmapped Hyperspace lanes, four systems, and jumpgates to more and less fortunate parts of known space. This far out, there is less of a Hegemonic presence, and local powers include pirate queens, criminal syndicates, and legitimate corporate interests.\n\n1\n\nThe worlds here are peppered with ruins of the Ur—an ancient civilization officially referred to as the Precursors—and mystics claim the flow of the Galactic Way lines are strong in the sector. Humans and aliens live and work side by side in common interest against both Hegemonic rule and the organized criminals that prey on the weak.\n\nTHE PLAYERS Each player portrays a daring, conflicted space-opera adventurer who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means. The players work together to bring life to their ship and their crew, and—with the oversight of the game master (GM)—decide as a group on the tone and style of the game, from swashbuckling space adventures to gritty crime. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM and make judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nTHE CHARACTERS Your crew will attempt to develop their enterprise from a ragtag group barely flying in the black to a serious and reputed ship that has built a name for itself, leaving their own unique mark on the sector in the process. You do this by taking risky jobs (both legal and illegal), planning your own escapades, forging alliances, outsmarting your enemies, and trying to stay one step ahead of the Hegemony. You’ll upgrade your ship, gain the respect of the factions you help, and suffer the ire of the factions you get in the way of. There are several character types to choose from: XXmechanics are gearheads\n\nXXscoundrels are scrappy and\n\nXXmuscles are dangerous and\n\nXXspeakers are respectable\n\nXXmystics are galactic wanderers\n\nXXstitches are spacefaring\n\nand hackers.\n\nintimidating fighters.\n\nin touch with the Way.\n\nlucky survivors.\n\npeople on the take.\n\nhealers and scientists.\n\nXXpilots are ship-handling\n\nwizards and danger addicts.\n\nYou can have a mix of character types in your crew, or play a crew that is all of one type. It’s up to you.\n\n2\n\nTHE SHIP In addition to creating characters, you’ll also pick which ship they fly in. The ship gets its own sheet, just like a character. Your ship type determines the jobs that you’ll focus on, as well as a selection of special abilities that support that kind of action. There are three different ships to choose from: XXstardancer: Illicit merchants, smugglers, and blockade runners. XXcerberus: Bounty hunters and extraction specialists. XXfiredrake: Labeled as criminals, these rebels fight the Hegemony.\n\nTHE GAME MASTER The GM establishes a dynamic world around the characters, especially the law-abiding civilian world and the shadowy criminal underworld. They play all the non-player characters (NPCs) in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action. The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story and doesn’t have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of actions and consequences wherever they lead.\n\nOVERVIEW // 1\n\nThis isn’t meant to be restrictive—the Stardancer might sometimes engage in bounty hunting (like the Cerberus) or antagonize the Hegemony (like the Firedrake)—but the core activity of the ship type is the most frequent way that crew earns cred and xp for advancement.\n\nPLAYING A SESSION\n\nA session of Scum and Villainy is like an episode of a TV show. There are one or two main events, plus some side-story elements, which all fit into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the group. During a session, the crew chooses a job to accomplish and makes dice rolls to jump into the action of the job. The player characters (PCs) take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the operation (succeed or fail). Then the crew has downtime to recover, pursue side projects, and indulge their vices. The players then look for new opportunities or create their own, and play to find out what happens next.\n\n3\n\nA single session might be one job and the following downtime, plus some free play. As you become more familiar with the game, you might pack more into a single session, doing several jobs in an extended evening of play. A campaign may be the culmination of a dozen sessions or so, as your crew aligns with a faction and throws your weight behind their agenda, prompting a long-term shift in the sector. You might take a break at that point and before starting up a new campaign and a new chapter in the story, possibly with an entirely different set of characters and new starting situation.\n\nTOUCHSTONES Here are some media touchstones you can use when pitching the game, which players might be familiar with. movies: Guardians of the Galaxy by James Gunn. Serenity by Joss Whedon. Star Wars by George Lucas.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\ntv: Cowboy Bebop by Keiko Mogumoto. Firefly by Joss Whedon.\n\nKilljoys by Michelle Lovretta. Lost Universe by Hajime Kanzaka. Blake’s 7 by Terry Nation. Outlaw Star by Takehito Iho.\n\ntheme song: Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked by Cage the Elephant.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY XXTwo to four players and one game master. XXA handful of six-sided dice (at least six). XXPrinted\n\ncharacter and ship sheets, reference sheets, and planet sheets. (http://offguardgames.com/scumandvillainy)\n\nXXThis book, for reference. XXBlank paper, index cards, and other materials for note-taking.\n\n4\n\nIT’S YOUR GAME This game is about exciting space adventures with scoundrels in a science-fiction world with fantastical elements. Before you get too far into actually playing the game, you should have a talk with your table about what sort of themes you’d like to see in play. Not every game is for every group of players, and you need your potential crew to buy into the conceit of the game.\n\nThere will be questions that come up in your story for which this text has no answer. Where did the Ur go? How does the Way function? These are questions you should answer through play. For your world, the answer may be different than someone else’s, and that’s okay. The things not expressly stated in this book are yours to create, and we look forward to hearing the answers your group comes up with.\n\nOVERVIEW // 1\n\nSome of this is indirectly decided by what sorts of characters you make and what type of ship you select. For example, if you want themes of rebellion, maybe pick up the Firedrake. But you should be talking through your decisions so that everyone is on the same page about what you’re trying to do. If someone is uncomfortable with a direction, negotiate with each other to ensure everyone has fun.\n\n5\n\nTHE CORE SYSTEM\n\nTHIS IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME\n\nPlaying Scum and Villainy is a collaborative discussion between the GM and the players in which narrative uncertainty is resolved with dice. The GM presents the world to the players, and the players determine their character’s actions within that context. Everyone works together to make sure the game is played fairly and correctly. The outcomes of the dice rolls dictate changes to the story, which leads to new situations, actions, and eventually more dice rolls. Importantly, this isn’t a story with an outcome that we know about in advance. Maybe our heroes will succeed or maybe they won’t. The mechanics will tell us what happens and we will decide what to do next. In this way, the direction of the story will take unpredictable turns and reach exciting conclusions that we could have never predicted.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nJUDGMENT CALLS Each kind of decision has a particular set of people in charge of resolving it. When you play, you’ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each: XXWhich\n\nactions are a reasonable solution to a problem? Must we\n\nscramble across the tarmac past the Legion or could we quietly skulk our way around the crates here? The players as a whole\n\nhave final say. XXHow dangerous is a given action in this circumstance, and also how\n\neffective will it be? How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot? The GM has final say. XXWhat consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given\n\ncircumstance? Do you break your leg falling from the hovercar? Do the House Malklaith guards merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped? The GM has final say. this situation call for a dice roll—if so, which one? Is your character in a position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative? The GM has final say.\n\nXXDoes\n\nXXWhich\n\nevents in the story match up with the xp triggers for character and crew advancement? Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? The players have final say.\n\n6\n\nThe decisions you make can set the tone of your game between realistic and fantastical, and between action and drama. These choices say what Scum and Villainy is for you and your group. There aren’t wrong answers here! Make the world one you want to play in!\n\nROLLING THE DICE Scum and Villainy uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the single highest result. the highest die is a 6, it’s a full success—things go well. If you roll more than one 6, it’s a critical success—you gain some additional advantage.\n\nXXIf\n\nXXIf the highest die is a 4/5, that’s a partial success—you do what\n\nyou were trying to do, but there are consequences—trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc. XXIf the highest die is 1-3, it’s a bad outcome. Things go poorly. You\n\nIf you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a critical when you have zero dice. All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you’re first learning the game, you can always “collapse” back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. This will let you keep the game moving; you can look up the exact rule later when you have time.\n\nOVERVIEW // 1\n\nlikely don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.\n\nEven with sizable dice pools, the most common result will be 4/5— partial success. You’ll tend to succeed, but at a cost. Life out in the fringe of space is rough and tumble, and the die mechanic will continue to push towards complications. Don’t shy away from these! While it can be tempting to try at all costs to avoid partial successes, it will make for a much more enjoyable story if you embrace the middle road. To create a dice pool for a roll, you’ll use a trait (like your scramble or your prowess, your ship’s crew quality, or the wealth of the system you’re in) and take dice equal to its rating. You’ll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good—a 50% chance of some sort of success. The most common traits you’ll use are your action ratings. A player might roll dice for their scrap action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.\n\n7\n\nThere are five types of rolls that you’ll use most often in the game: XXaction roll.\n\nWhen a PC attempts an action that’s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game. See page 18.\n\nXXdowntime roll. When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they\n\ncan perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done. See page 184.\n\nXXengagement roll. The engagement roll is made at the beginning\n\nof each job. It helps jump past the planning, and showcases what position the PCs are in when the twists and complications of the job hit them. See page 150.\n\nXXfortune roll. The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision\n\nmaking and leave something up to chance. How loyal is an NPC? How much does the bounty hunter find out? How valuable is the information on those Guild drives? See page 38.\n\nXXresistance roll. A player can\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nmake a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don’t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. When you resist that “Broken Leg” harm, you take some stress and now it’s only a “Sprained Ankle” instead. See page 35.\n\n8\n\nTHE GAME STRUCTURE Scum and Villainy has a play structure of three parts. By default, the game is in free play—characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed. When the group is ready, they choose a target for their next criminal operation, then choose a type of plan to employ. This triggers the engagement roll (which establishes the situation as the operation starts), and the game shifts into the job phase. See page 150 for more details.\n\nDuring downtime, the GM engages the systems for payoff, heat, and entanglements, to determine all the fallout from the job. Then the PCs each get their downtime activities, such as indulging their vice to remove stress or working on a long-term project (see page 184 for details on downtime). When all the downtime activities are complete, the game returns to free play and the cycle starts over again. Each phase works towards a different goal. Free play is, for example, very fluid. Time can move very quickly, with several weeks passing in a few moments of play. Characters often split up to do things on their own or work their own personal projects. But the job phase is more concrete and focused. Play becomes about finishing the job, and watching as the crew overcomes each successive obstacle and challenge. After they finish the job, play shifts into downtime and the focus of play moves to the consequences of the characters’ actions and resulting changes in the world.\n\nOVERVIEW // 1\n\nDuring the job, the PCs engage the target—they make rolls, overcome obstacles, call for flashbacks, and complete the operation (successfully or not). When the job is finished (or abandoned), the game shifts into the downtime phase.\n\nThe phases are a conceptual model to help you organize the game— they’re not meant to be rigid structures. Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in play. During a job, players can use flashbacks to situations that they had set up, effectively backtracking into free play, if need be. And almost any concrete action in free play might signal the start of a job. But remembering these phases can help keep play pointed at the right ideas.\n\n9\n\nACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES ACTION RATINGS\n\nThere are 12 actions in the game that PCs use to overcome obstacles (see list on page 64). Each action has a rating (from zero to 3) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don’t just represent skill or training— you’re free to describe how your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at command because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nYou choose which action to use to overcome an obstacle. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you’ll make an action roll to see how it turns out.\n\nattune command consort doctor hack helm rig scramble scrap skulk study sway\n\nACTION ROLL You make an action roll when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s position. There are three positions: controlled, risky, and desperate. If you’re in a controlled position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a desperate position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in-between, it’s risky—usually considered the “default” position for most actions.\n\nATTRIBUTE RATINGS There are three attributes in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: insight, prowess, and resolve. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 3) that tells you how many dice to roll when using that attribute.\n\ninsight prowess resolve\n\nIf there’s no danger or trouble at hand, don’t make an action roll. You might instead make a fortune roll (see page 38), a downtime roll (page 184), or the GM will simply say yes, and you accomplish your goal.\n\n10\n\nThe rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the first column under that attribute (see the examples below). The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.\n\nRESISTANCE ROLL Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get stabbed, for example, you resist physical harm with your prowess rating. Resistance rolls always succeed—you diminish or deflect the bad result—but the better your roll, the less stress it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.\n\nThe GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “preemptive” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous foes.\n\nEXAMPLE ACTION & ATTRIBUTE RATINGS INSIGHT\n\n   \n\n   \n\ndoctor hack rig study\n\nThis character has a doctor action rating of 2. Their insight attribute rating is 1 (The first column of dots).\n\nOVERVIEW // 1\n\nWhen the enemy has a big advantage, you’ll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. For example, when you fight the master assassin sent by the Ashen Knives, she disarms you before you can strike. You need to make a resistance roll to keep hold of your weapon if you want to attack her.\n\nPROWESS\n\n   \n\n   \n\nhelm scramble scrap skulk\n\nThey also have scramble 1 and scrap 2. Their prowess attribute is 2.\n\nresolve\n\n   \n\n   \n\nattune command consort sway\n\nFinally they have attune 1, consort 2 and sway 1. Their resolve attribute rating is 3.\n\n11\n\nSTRESS & TRAUMA STRESS Player characters in Scum and Villainy have a special reserve of fortitude and luck called stress. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the resistance roll (see page 35) determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome. During a shootout, Alice’s character, Hayley, gets shot in the chest. Alice rolls her prowess rating to resist, and gets a 2. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Alice marks off 4 stress and describes how Hayley survives. The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Hayley suffers level 2 harm “Chest Wound” instead of level 3 harm “Punctured Lung.”\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nPUSHING YOURSELF You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take 2 stress (each can be chosen once for a given action): XXAdd +1d to your roll. (See Action Roll, page 18.) XXAdd +1 level to your effect. (See Effect, page 26.)\n\naction when you’re incapacitated. (See Consequences & Harm, page 32.)\n\nXXTake\n\nBeing able to push yourself is one of the key techniques of the game. Since even a single die gives you a 50/50 chance of success, being able to push yourself means you almost always have a chance of pulling off whatever stunt you’re trying to pull. Characters in Scum and Villainy have a knack for pulling themselves out of the fire. It’s important to remember you have this option! It can be easy to dismiss the actions for which you have zero dots, on the basis that you’d have to take the worst of two dice. But if you have the stress available, you can boost your roll with an extra die and at least have even odds of succeeding.\n\nTRAUMA When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of trauma. When you take trauma, circle one of your trauma conditions like Cold, Reckless, Unstable, etc. They’re all described on the next page.\n\n12\n\nWhen you suffer trauma, you’re taken out of action. You’re left for dead or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, you have 0 stress and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime (see Vice, page 190). Trauma conditions are permanent. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. When you mark your fourth trauma condition, your character cannot continue as a starfaring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life. (See Stash & Retirement, page 49.)\n\nTRAUMA CONDITIONS XXcold: You’re not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.\n\nthings from your past or that others may not see.\n\nXXobsessed: You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, a\n\ngoal, an ideology.\n\nXXparanoid: You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others. XXreckless: You have little regard for your own safety, best interests,\n\nor well-being.\n\nXXsoft: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle. XXunstable: Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage,\n\nfall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.\n\nXXvicious:\n\nYou seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.\n\nStress & Trauma // 1\n\nXXhaunted: You’re often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing\n\nYou can play your trauma conditions as much or as little as you like. They can totally transform your character’s persona or have only a small impact—it’s up to you. If you do play them strongly, though, allowing a trauma condition to complicate your character’s life, you earn xp for it. (See Advancement, page 50.)\n\n13\n\nPROGRESS CLOCKS A progress clock is a circle divided into segments (see right). Draw a progress clock to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approaching trouble. Sneaking into a guarded hanger? Make a clock to track the patrolling dock police alert level. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments until the alarm is raised. Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the progress clock. A basic obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock. More difficult problems may have as high as 12 segments.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nThe effect level of an action should guide how segments on a clock are ticked (see Effect, page 26). Sometimes circumstances change to radically alter the fiction. Adjust clocks so that the progress measures the effect the PCs are having. Don’t create clocks with fewer than four segments. If a situation is simple enough for one action to complete, you don’t need a clock. Use the effect level and position to determine how the action resolves. When you create a clock, make it about the obstacle, not the method. Clocks for an infiltration should be “Exterior Patrols” and “Perimeter Door,” not “Sneak Past the Guards” or “Hack the Perimeter Door.” The patrols and the door are the obstacles—the PCs can overcome them in multiple ways. Complex threats can be broken into several “layers,” each with its own clock. For example, the Governor’s mansion might have “Perimeter Security,” “Automated Defenses,” and “Vault Security” clocks. The crew would have to cut through all three to breach the Governor’s personal safe and access the Ur artifact collection within. Remember, a clock tracks progress. A clock is like a hyperspace navreadout. It shows you where you are—it doesn’t get you there.\n\nSIMPLE OBSTACLES Not every obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex and you need to track something over time—otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll. Examples of progress clocks follow. These are some of many ways to use clocks, but feel free to come up with new ones!\n\n14\n\nDANGER CLOCKS The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like the growing suspicion during a seduction, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert of a system being hacked or guard patrols being bypassed. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition—the guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the killer drones, etc. (See Consequences & Harm, page 32.) Create two opposed clocks to represent a chase. The PCs might have a progress clock called “Escape” while the House Malklaith guards have a clock called “Cornered.” If the PCs finish their clock before the guards fill theirs, they get away. Otherwise, they’re cornered and can’t flee. If both clocks complete at the same time, the PCs get to their ship and are safely hidden on board, but the guards are outside and have control of the spaceport! You can also use racing clocks for environmental hazards. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the “Search” clock to find an ancient star map on a derelict ship before the GM fills the “Engine Overload” clock and the vessel explodes.\n\nLINKED CLOCKS You can make a clock that unlocks another clock once it’s filled. For example, the GM might make a linked clock called “Trapped” after an “Alert” clocks fills up. Once the guards are alerted and working to trap the PCs, any following actions would lead to them becoming trapped.\n\nProgress Clocks // 1\n\nRACING CLOCKS\n\nWhen you fight a veteran soldier, she might have a clock for her “Defense” and then a linked clock for “Vulnerable.” Once you overcome the “Defense” clock, you can attempt to overcome the “Vulnerable” clock and defeat her. You might affect the “Defense” clock with violence in a gunfight, or lower her defense with deception. As always, the method of action is up to the players and the details of the fiction at hand.\n\nMISSION CLOCKS The GM can make a clock for a time-sensitive mission, to represent the window of opportunity you have to complete it. If the countdown runs out, the mission is scrubbed or changes—the target escapes, the household wakes up for the day, etc. Such a clock can be ticked as a consequence, or if the PCs take actions that eat up too much time.\n\n15\n\nTUG-OF-WAR CLOCKS You can make a clock that can be filled and emptied by events, to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a “Revolution!” clock that indicates when the Cobalt Syndicate laborers riot over their poor treatment and working conditions on Aleph. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. If it empties completely, the workers are satisfied with their lot—at least for now. Once it fills, the revolution begins. A tug-of-war clock is also perfect for an ongoing turf war between two factions.\n\nLONG-TERM PROJECT\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nSome projects will take a long time. A basic long-term project (like jury-rigging up a new feature for a device) is eight segments. Truly long-term projects (like creating a new stardrive) can be two, three, or even four clocks, representing all the phases of development, testing, and manufacturing. Add or subtract clocks depending on the details of the situation and complexity of the project. Take a look at Crafting on page 282 for some ideas on this. Long-term projects are the default tool to deal with any unusual player goal, including things that change elements of the mechanics or the setting. For example, by default, trauma is permanent. But maybe a player wants to work on a project where they lock away traumatic memories and rehabilitate themselves by visiting a powerful psychic xeno mystic—reducing a character’s trauma but perhaps losing some cherished memories in the process. It will be a long and dangerous task to set up everything needed to begin and work on a project like this, but almost anything can be attempted as long as the group is interested and it seems feasible to everyone.\n\nFACTION CLOCKS Each faction has a long-term goal (see the faction write-ups, starting on page 320). When the PCs have downtime (page 184), the GM ticks forward the faction clocks that they’re interested in. In this way, the world around the PCs is dynamic and things happen that they’re not directly connected to, changing the overall situation in the Procyon sector and creating new opportunities and challenges. The PCs may also directly affect NPC faction clocks, based on the missions and jobs they pull off. Discuss known faction projects that they might aid or interfere with, and also consider how a PC operation might affect the NPC clocks, whether the players intended it or not. You can find more information on faction clocks and how the PCs may discover and affect them in Faction Clocks, page 260.\n\n16\n\nPROGRESS CLOCKS IN PLAY The crew are infiltrating Governor Malklaith’s mansion to erase records of their Ashen Knives employers. The GM makes a progress clock for the alert level of Malklaith’s staff. She makes an 8-clock because on a sprawling estate with alert many staff on retainer, a few suspicious events can easily be overlooked. During the operation, Ray rolls to skulk past some guards and rolls a 4/5. She gets past, but the complication is two ticks on the “Alert” clock. The fairly well-trained guards are not especially wary. Later, when Hayley rolls a 1-3 on a desperate action to rig the door into Malklaith’s bedroom, the GM fills three segments—the Governor’s bodyguards are Tier III professionals and are experts at spotting trouble. This proceeds until the job is complete or the clock ticks over— in the latter case, the estate alarms go off and guards come rushing down the corridors. Racing at Bright Wind The crew enter an illegal space race in the Brekk system, in an attempt to impress the Echo Wave Riders and earn their trust for an elite smuggling job requiring fancy flying.\n\npc crew\n\nyast jor\n\nThe GM decides the other front-runner is the famed Yast Jor of the Guild of Engineers. The GM makes one clock for the crew and another for Yast. As PCs take actions and suffer consequences, the GM ticks the clocks to show the progress of each side. When one side’s clock is filled, they’ve reached the finish line.\n\nPROGRESS CLOCKS // 1\n\nInfiltrating Malklaith’s Mansion\n\n17 17\n\nACTION ROLL When a player character does something challenging, we make an action roll to see how it turns out. An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to the PC’s goal that’s dangerous or troublesome in some way. We don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. If their action is something that we’d expect them to simply accomplish, then we don’t make an action roll. Each game group will have their own ideas about what “challenging” means. This is good! Coming to consensus about what difficulties look like establishes the tone and style of your Scum and Villainy series. To make an action roll, we go through six steps. In play, they flow together somewhat, but let’s break each one down here for clarity: 1. The player states their goal for the action. 2. The player chooses the action rating.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\n3. The GM sets the position for the roll. 4. The GM sets the effect level for the action. 5. Add bonus dice. 6. The player rolls the dice and we judge the result.\n\n1. THE PLAYER STATES THEIR GOAL Your goal is the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand. Usually the character’s goal is pretty obvious in context, but it’s the GM’s job to ask and clarify the goal when necessary. It never hurts to be clear and avoid any confusion. You’re punching him in the face, right? Okay, what do want to get out of this? Do you want to take him out, or just rough him up so he’ll do what you want?\n\n2. THE PLAYER CHOOSES THE ACTION RATING The player chooses which action rating to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your scrap action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your command action, then order someone around. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that particular action in the fiction.\n\n18\n\nSome actions overlap and the same end result can come via several methods. If you want to hurt someone, you might scrap with them or use doctor to poison them. If you want to scare an enemy, you might command them through terrifying presence or sway them with tough lies. Which action to perform is the player’s choice.\n\n3. THE GM SETS THE POSITION Once the player chooses their action, the GM sets the position for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: controlled, risky, and desperate. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.\n\nCONTROLLED\n\nYou’re set up for success. You’re exploiting a dominant advantage.\n\nRISKY\n\nYou go head-to-head. You’re acting under duress. You’re taking a chance.\n\nDESPERATE\n\nYou’re overreaching. You’re in real trouble. A very dangerous maneuver.\n\nBy default, an action roll is risky. You wouldn’t be rolling if there weren’t any risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.\n\nACTION ROLL // 1\n\npositions\n\nNegotiate with your GM over the position you find yourself in and what you might do to improve it. Sometimes the position is risky for reasons that aren’t clear until you ask questions. “It’s risky? It seems like this dockworker isn’t a real threat to me, given that I’m strapped and a dyed-in-the-wool pirate. Shouldn’t this be controlled?” “No, the danger isn’t the dockworker, but that you’re roughing this guy up in public. One of his buddies could step in or maybe someone will find a Cobalt Syndicate enforcer to deal with you. You could make it controlled if you wait until the guy is alone.” The GM gets final say over the position of the roll, but should explain and clarify so no one is caught by surprise. Talking about the position will help establish the fictional situation much more clearly and set the tone of the game.\n\n19\n\n4. THE GM SETS THE EFFECT LEVEL The GM assesses the likely effect level of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us how much this action can accomplish—will it have limited, standard, or great effect? Effect level is explained in detail in the next section, starting on page 26. The GM’s choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player’s choice of action rating. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by scrapping with someone, maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn’t be out of line to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like consorting would be a lot better for that. Players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn’t mean all actions are equally risky or potent.\n\n5. ADD BONUS DICE\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\n20\n\nYou can normally get three bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice). For one bonus die, you can get assistance from a teammate. They take 1 stress, say how they help you, and give you +1d. For another bonus die, you can either push yourself (take 2 stress) or you can accept a Devil’s Bargain (you can’t get dice for both, it’s one or the other). Note though that pushing gives you the option of taking +1 effect. You can push for effect and accept a Devil’s Bargain for an additional die on your roll. For a third bonus die, you can spend a gambit. A gambit is a limited resource shared by your whole crew, and earned by taking a few risks. For more about gambits, take a look at page 121.\n\nTHE DEVIL’S BARGAIN PCs in Scum and Villainy are heedless adventurers who often shoot first and ask questions later—they don’t always act in their own best interests. To reflect this, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus die to accept a Devil’s Bargain. Common bargains include: XXCollateral damage, unintended harm. XXSacrifice cred or an item. XXBetray a friend or loved one. XXOffend or anger a faction. XXStart and/or tick a troublesome clock. XXAdd heat to the crew from evidence or witnesses.\n\nThe bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You pay the price and get the bonus die. Don’t force it if there’s no interesting bargain in a situation. Sometimes there’s not one, and that’s okay. “These pirates aren’t the most trustworthy scum, so if we leave them alone with the cash, there’s a good chance they’ll bolt with it while we’re on the other ship. I’m gonna get all up in their faces and command them to keep their dirty hands off.” “Ooh, I have a Devil’s Bargain. You can take +1d but they don’t take well to the threats. I’ll start a new 4-clock called ‘Pirate Revenge’ and tick it three times. Push them around again and you’re going to have a second group to fight.”\n\nACTION ROLL // 1\n\nXXSuffer harm.\n\n“Nice. I like it! Maybe I’ll try to untick some of that clock in downtime…” Some players like to inject something new in the story with Devil’s Bargains, or use them to focus on a character’s backstory or nature. Someone here is a member of your old platoon—the one you left for dead. One of the mystics becomes obsessed with you. The crates you’re stealing have clear Guild markings. Your Guild friend is going to be miffed when she hears! A Devil’s Bargain is always a choice. If you don’t like one, reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead. If needed, the GM has final say over what Devil’s Bargains are valid.\n\n21\n\n6. ROLL THE DICE AND JUDGE THE RESULT Once the goal, action rating, position, and effect have been established, add any bonus dice and roll the dice pool to determine the outcome. (See possible outcomes, by position, on the next page.) The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well the character performs and how serious the consequences are. They might succeed at their action with no consequences (on a 6), or succeed but suffer consequences (4/5) or it might all go wrong (1-3). On a 1-3, it’s up to the GM to decide if the PC’s action has any effect or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but sometimes it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a 1-3 result.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nHayley rigs up a neural interface to mine a defunct AI core she found in the ruins of an Ur temple. The roll is a 1-3. The GM could say Hayley fails to tap the AI core and the backlash from the desperate failure manifests as level 3 mental harm. But it would be more interesting if the equipment worked and Hayley was confronted with a horrific intelligence, mind-tomind, right? Hayley touches the incomprehensible memories of that ancient entity and the long-dormant madness within overwhelms her. She suffers level 3 mental harm, sure, but also gets a new 6-clock, “Get Rid of These Corrupted Memories.” Each 4/5 and 1-3 outcome lists suggested consequences for the action. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. Consequences are explained in detail on page 32. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences by resisting them. See page 35 for details about resistance. When you narrate the action after the roll, the GM and player collaborate together to say what happens on-screen. How do you vault to the other ship? What do you say to the Legionnaire to convince her? When you face the Nightspeaker in single combat, what’s your fighting style like? The GM will tell you the results of your actions.\n\nDOUBLE-DUTY ROLLS Since NPCs don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double duty. It resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a 6, the PC wins and has their effect. On a 4/5, it’s a mix—both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a 1-3, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.\n\n22\n\naCTION ROLL\n\n+\n\n1d for each\n\naction rating dot +1d if you push yourself (you take 2 stress) — or — if you accept a\n\ndevil’s bargain +\n\n+\n\n+1d if you spend a gambit (can only spend 1 per roll) +1d if another crew member assisted you\n\ncontrolled\n\nYou act on your terms.

Make an action roll when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n3\n\n6\n\nThe player states the outcome they want to achieve when they overcome the obstacle in the fiction (it’s good to be clear). The player chooses the action rating to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nThe GM establishes the position of the roll (controlled, risky, or desperate). This governs the consequences of the roll.\n\n24\n\nThe GM sets the effect level of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action.\n\nAdd up to three bonus dice. 1) Assistance from a teammate. 2) Push yourself (take 2 stress) or accept a Devil’s Bargain. 3) Use a gambit from the crew.\n\nRoll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.\n\n25 action roll // 1\n\nEFFECT In Scum and Villainy, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a goal? That depends on the effect level of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand—limited, standard, or great? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a progress clock. effects\n\nticks\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nLIMITED\n\nYou achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished?\n\n1\n\nSTANDARD\n\nYou achieve what we would expect as “normal” with the action.\n\n2\n\nGREAT\n\nYou achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest?\n\n3\n\nASSESSING FACTORS To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: potency, scale, and quality. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.\n\nPOTENCY This factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk (page 28), or the influence of strange powers. A high-end Guild device may be a potent safe-cracker. An Ur artifact may be potent against a Nightspeaker’s charms. A thief will be more potent skulking in the dark.\n\nQUALITY / TIER Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by crew quality or faction Tier. Fine items count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier/crew quality. Hayley is picking the lock to a Malklaith warehouse. Her crew quality is I and she has fine lockpicks—she’s at Tier II. Malklaith is Tier III. Hayley is outclassed in quality, so her effect on the lock will be limited.\n\n26\n\nSCALE Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance. When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in zero effect—or increased beyond great, resulting in an extreme effect. If a PC special ability gives “+1 effect,” it comes into play after the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Pilot’s Exceed Specs ability would bump them up to limited effect.\n\nFor a master table of factor examples, see Magnitude on page 278. Every factor won’t always apply to every situation. You don’t have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call—don’t feel beholden to them.\n\nDOMINANT FACTORS If one effect factor overshadows the others, the side with that advantage dominates the situation. It doesn’t matter if you have a fine vibro-blade and extra effect if you try to fight 20 people at once. Their scale dominates the battle and you’re left with very limited effect, or no effect at all. The same principle applies to “impossible” actions.\n\nEFFECT // 1\n\nAlso, remember that a PC can push themselves (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action. (See Stress & Trauma, page 12.)\n\nAleera wants to shoot down a gunship harassing them with her fine blaster pistol, Krieger. She says, “I take Krieger and I scrap with the ship, shooting out the engines. Ha! I rolled a crit! Great effect!” Obviously, this isn’t possible. A person can’t shoot down a gunship with a blaster. We know it’s inherently silly, like jumping over the moon. But this is also codified in the effect factors. The ship is dominant in quality, scale, and potency. Unless those factors are countered somehow, Aleera’s effect level is zero before she starts. No matter what she rolls for her action, she’ll have no effect. This concept is useful when assessing other very tough (but achievable) situations.\n\n27\n\nBut this situation isn’t entirely hopeless. This is where effect factors can help make sense of the situation. If the ship is dominant in quality, scale, and potency, then the PCs can try to understand the factors and take actions to address them. Is there a weakness in the armor of the ship? They can use that to remove its potency (and seize that advantage for themselves). What scale is it? They need a bigger gun. And so on. Effect factors are a way to codify the situation into a few key factors so it’s easier to talk about what needs to change in order to have the desired effect.\n\nTRADING POSITION FOR EFFECT After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they’re going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nThis kind of trade-off isn’t included in the effect factors because it’s not an element the GM should assess when setting the effect level. Once the level is set, though, you can always offer the trade-off to the player if it makes sense in the situation. “I skulk across the hanger and vault over the cargo crates, hiding in the shadows by the Hegemony ship and the forklifts.” “I don’t think you can make it across in one quick dash. The scale of the hanger is a factor here, so your effect will be limited. Let’s say you can get halfway across with this action, then you’ll have to skulk through the other half of the space (and the rest of the guards there) to reach the other side.” “I didn’t realize it was that far. Hmmm. Okay, what if I just go as fast as I can. Can I get all the way across if I make a desperate roll?” “Yep, sounds good to me!”\n\nEFFECTS IN THE FICTION After the action roll, make sure to explain what the achieved effect looks like in the fiction. Leaving it as simply a number of clock segments will keep the story static, whereas explaining the new situation allows the players a way forward into new actions and subsequent rolls. Look at the questions for the effect level as a guide for the kinds of things to explain.\n\n28\n\nActions can be simple (resolved entirely in one roll) or complex (resolved by filling up a clock). If the player says, “I lie to the guard and tell him I’m there on official business,” that could be a simple action. It might be limited, standard, or great effect, resulting in a number of possible new situations. The guard may be skeptical but willing to hear you out (limited), wave you through without questioning (standard), or clear you through all the checkpoints in the area (great), depending on the factors in the story so far.\n\nThere’s no rule for what is a simple action and what is complex. As a guide, think about whether you’d want to see this taken up a few beats, or whether it’s just a tense moment. For the latter, use a simple obstacle, and for the former, use a complex one.\n\nWHY WE DO THIS The biggest reason for setting effect is to set expectations about the result of a roll and the situation at hand. You grapple the mercenary. Do you break his neck in a swift wrenching motion? Do you daze him in a single jab? What goes into the effect that you’re having? Can that be changed?\n\nEFFECT // 1\n\nIf the player says, “I’m fighting this exotic beast with the knife I have tucked in my boot,” that might be a complex obstacle. The GM creates a clock for the creature, then there are several action rolls to resolve the fight, each ticking the clock according to effect level (risking consequences from the outcome of each).\n\nEstablishing effect and describing how it looks in the story shows players what they’re accomplishing and what might go wrong. By understanding the effect of their actions, the group will have a sense of how many actions (and consequences) will achieve their goals. Sometimes a black eye is all you need to prove your point. Maybe nothing short of death will do. After each roll, the players have a clear picture of what has happened and can make decisions about what to do next.\n\nCONSEQUENCES PCs affect the world around them. When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it’s called a consequence. Consequences are the companion to effects. See page 32 for details on consequences and how they impact the player characters.\n\n29\n\nSETTING POSITION & EFFECT\n\nThe GM sets position and effect for an action roll after the player says what they’re doing and chooses an action. Usually, risky/ standard is the default, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and any applicable effect factors. When you first start learning the game, you might cautiously step through the process with some deliberation, but after a bit of practice, you’ll be able to set position and effect with a quick “gut feeling” that can then be tweaked if a PC has a particular ability, item, or some other element to consider as a special case. If anyone is unclear why something is set at a specific position/effect (“Wait why is this desperate?”), feel free to drop back to stepping through the process individually. Frequently there just happens to be a factor someone hasn’t anticipated or remembered (or they envisioned the scenario and threats differently).\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nThe ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances. For example, if a character is facing off alone against a small group, the situation might be: XXShe fights the group straight up, rushing into their midst, punching\n\nand hacking away in a wild scrap. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the group reduces her effect (Desperate / Limited).\n\nXXShe fights the\n\ngroup from a choke point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can’t overwhelm her at once. She’s not threatened by several foes all at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there are still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced (Risky / Limited).\n\nXXShe\n\ndoesn’t bother to fight the group directly, instead trying to\n\nscramble her way past them and escape. She’s still under threat\n\nfrom many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the group can’t easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn’t reduced (Desperate / Standard). XXIf she was trying to leave without focusing on a fight, and she had\n\nsome immediate means of getting away (like leaping onto a nearby hovercar), then while the enemy numbers still make her position worse, her effect might even be increased (Desperate / Great)!\n\n30\n\nXXThe group isn’t aware of her yet—she’s set up in a sniper position\n\nPOSITION & effect // 1\n\non a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren’t a factor, so her effect isn’t reduced, and she’s not in any immediate danger (Controlled / Great). Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole group, in which case their scale applies (Controlled / Limited). If the group is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous (Risky / Great). If the group is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover (Risky / Limited). If the group is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our scoundrel (Desperate / Limited). If she happens to have brought the heavy ammo her weapons dealer conatact sold her, we’d see the effect change again as such rounds easily penetrate the cover (Desperate / Standard).\n\n31\n\nCONSEQUENCES & HARM Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict consequences on a PC. There are five types (see list).\n\nA given circumstance might result in one or more consequences, depending on the situation. The GM determines the consequences, following from the fiction and the tone established by the group.\n\nreduced effect complication lost opportunity worse position harm\n\nREDUCED EFFECT\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nThis consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.\n\nCOMPLICATION This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action: the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the crew takes +1 heat from witnesses, you lose status with a faction, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, etc. The GM might tick a clock for the complication instead. Maybe there’s a clock for the alert level of the guards at the spaceport. Or maybe the GM creates a new clock for Legion suspicion at the checkpoint and ticks it. Fill one tick on a clock for a minor complication or two ticks for a standard complication. A serious complication is more severe: the room catches fire and falling ceiling beams block the door, your weapon is broken, the crew suffers +2 heat, your target escapes out of sight, reinforcements surround and trap you, etc. Fill three ticks on a clock for a serious complication. Don’t inflict a complication that negates a successful roll. If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a 4/5, don’t say that the enemy escapes. The player’s roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered, but maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position and during the scuffle the enemy grabs the PC’s gun.\n\n32\n\nLOST OPPORTUNITY This consequence represents shifting circumstances. You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slipped away. To try again, you need a new approach—usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe you tried to scrap with your bounty target to trap her on the balcony, but she evades your maneuver and leaps out of reach to another balcony. If you want to get to her now you’ll have to try another way—maybe by scrambling across the gap yourself. This consequence represents losing control of the situation—the action carries you into a more dangerous position. Perhaps you make the leap across to the next balcony, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position. This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from controlled, to risky, to desperate as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper in trouble.\n\nHARM This consequence represents a long-lasting debility (or death). When you suffer harm, record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer. If you suffer lesser harm, record it in the bottom row. If you suffer moderate harm, write it in the middle row. If you suffer severe harm, record it in the top row. See examples of harm and the harm tracker on the next page. Your character suffers the penalty indicated at the end of the row if any harm recorded in that row applies to the situation at hand. So, if you have “Tired” harm in the bottom row, you’ll suffer reduced effect when you try to run away from the Legion guards. When you’re impaired by harm in the top row (severe harm, level 3), your character is incapacitated and can’t do anything unless you have help from someone else or push yourself to perform the action.\n\nConsequences & Harm // 1\n\nWORSE POSITION\n\nIf you need to mark a harm level but the row is already filled, the harm moves up to the next available row. So, if you suffered moderate harm (level 2) but had no empty spaces in the second row, you’d have to record severe harm (level 3), instead. If you run out of spaces on the top row and need to mark harm there, your character suffers a catastrophic, permanent consequence (loss of a limb, sudden death, etc., depending on the circumstances).\n\n33\n\nNON-PHYSICAL HARM Harm doesn’t just have to be broken ribs and knife wounds. “Snubbed” harm can happen at a fancy Governor’s dinner party. If you attune poorly to an artifact, you might get level 2 harm “Screaming Voices in Your Mind.” It applies -1d (as per level 2 harm) whenever you’re taking an action that having screaming voices in your head might affect. Harm is removed through the recover downtime action (see page 187), but it can also fictionally vanish. When applying unusual harm to the crew, let them know how they can remove it. If you’re unsure, for example when dealing with those screaming voices, discuss with your table what sort of long-term project might remove it. This can be a way to showcase powerful opponents without killing the crew. A tough bounty hunter might punch you in the gut, leaving you with level 3 harm “Can’t Breathe.” The harm clears after 10 minutes of rest, but leaves you unable to do much for the rest of the scene.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nHARM EXAMPLE harm\n\n3\n\nShattered Right Leg\n\nneed help\n\n2 1\n\n-1d\n\nBurned\n\nGrazed\n\nless effect\n\nThis character has three harm: a “Shattered Right Leg” (level 3) plus “Burned” and “Grazed” (level 1). If they suffer another level 1 harm, it will become level 2 (since both level 1 slots are filled). If they suffer another level 3 harm, it will move up to level 4—Fatal.\n\nHARM EXAMPLES fatal (4): Spaced, Drowned, Shot through the Heart severe (3): Impaled, Broken Leg, Shot in Chest, Crushed Rib, Terrified moderate (2): Exhausted, Deep Cut, Concussion, Panicked, Seduced lesser (1): Bruised, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Sprained, Confused\n\nHarm like “Drained” or “Exhausted” can be a good fallback consequence if there’s nothing else threatening a PC (like when they spend all night going over those safe schematics, looking for any weaknesses before they raid a Counters Guild vault).\n\n34\n\nRESISTANCE & ARMOR\n\nWhen your PC suffers a consequence that you don’t like, you can choose to resist it. Just tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” Resistance is always automatically effective—the GM says if the consequence is reduced in severity or if you avoid it entirely. Make a resistance roll to see how much stress your character suffers as a result of their resistance.\n\nYou make the roll using one of your character’s attributes (insight, prowess, or resolve). The GM chooses the attribute, based on the nature of consequence: XXinsight: Consequences from deception or understanding. XXresolve: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.\n\nYour character suffers 6 stress when they resist, minus the highest die result from the resistance roll. So, if you rolled a 4, you’d suffer 2 stress. If you rolled a 6, you’d suffer 0 stress. If you get a critical result, you also clear 1 stress. Juan’s character Captain Aman is in a desperate shootout with several Cobalt Syndicate thugs when one of them lands a blaster shot. Since the position was desperate, the GM inflicts severe harm (modified by any other factors). She tells Juan to record level 3 harm “Sucking Chest Wound” on Aman’s sheet. Juan decides to resist the harm instead. The GM says he can reduce the harm by one level if he resists it. Juan rolls 3d for Aman’s prowess attribute and gets a 5. Aman takes 1 stress and the harm is reduced to level 2, “Scorched Ribs.” Usually, a resistance roll reduces severity of a consequence. If you’re going to suffer fatal harm, for example, a resistance roll would reduce the harm to severe, instead. Or if you got a complication when you were sneaking into the manor house, and the GM was going to mark three ticks on the “Alert” clock, she’d only mark two (or maybe one) if you resisted the complication.\n\nResistance & Armor // 1\n\nXXprowess: Consequences from physical strain or injury.\n\nEach consequence can only be resisted one time. The GM also has the option to rule that your character completely avoids the consequence. For instance, maybe you’re in a sword fight and the consequence is getting disarmed. When you resist, the GM says that you avoid that consequence completely: you keep hold of your weapon.\n\n35\n\nBy adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of your game. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance. As a general note, we suggest that you reduce consequences by two levels. Especially foolish or dangerous actions will still have daring consequences, but risky and controlled actions can often benefit characters at only a small stress cost. This seems to hit a daring space opera vibe, but may not be appropriate for grittier games. The GM may also threaten several consequences at once, then the player may choose which ones to resist (and make rolls for each). “She hits you with a stun baton and then leaps off the balcony. Level 2 harm and you lose the opportunity to catch her for the moment.” “I’ll resist losing the opportunity by grappling her as she attacks. She can shock me, but I don’t want to let her escape.”\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nOnce you decide to resist a consequence and roll, you suffer the stress indicated. You can’t roll first and see how much stress you’ll take, then decide whether or not to resist.\n\nRESISTANCE ROLL \n\n1d for each ATTRIBUTE rating.\n\nYou reduce or completely avoid the effects of the consequences (GM chooses). Suffer 6 minus the highest die result stress. critical: Clear 1 stress.\n\n36\n\nARMOR If you have a type of armor that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.\n\nWhen an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your load for the next job.\n\nDEATH There are a couple of ways for a PC to die: XXIf they suffer level 4\n\nfatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here.\n\nXXIf they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they\n\nsuffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).\n\nWhen your character dies, you can create a new scoundrel to play. Maybe you “promote” one of the NPC allies to a PC, or create a brand-new character who joins the crew.\n\nResistance & Armor // 1\n\nAman is taking level 2 harm “Scorched Ribs,” and the fight isn’t even over yet, so Juan decides to use Aman’s armor to reduce the harm. He marks the armor box and the harm becomes level 1, “Winged.” If Aman had an ability that gave him additional armor, such as the Cerberus’s crew ability Loaded For Bear, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero.\n\nScum and Villainy characters are fairly competent and viable from the get-go, but if you’re portraying an NPC you may want to take different starting actions or abilities to reflect their current state in the fiction. Discuss with your table what might be the best way to proceed.\n\n37\n\nFORTUNE ROLL\n\nThe fortune roll is a tool the GM can use to disclaim decision making. You use a fortune roll in two different ways: When you need to make a determination about a situation the PCs aren’t directly involved in and don’t want to simply decide the outcome. House Malklaith and the Starsmiths are fighting over control of a small planetoid near Vet rumored to contain Ur artifacts. How does that turn out? The GM makes a fortune roll for each. Malklaith gets a good result, but the Starsmiths get limited effect. The GM decides that Malklaith takes over the asteroid, and the Starsmiths have stopped supplying the Governor’s ships in protest. When an outcome is uncertain, but no other roll applies to the situation at hand.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nWhile Hayley Griffen is attempting to find some data she can sell in a Legion outpost, guards begin breaking down the door to the room. With limited time, Griffen starts pulling drives randomly, hoping she gets at least something of value for the trouble. How valuable? Is the drive corrupted in the process? Who knows? The GM makes a fortune roll to see how it turns out. When you make a fortune roll you may assess any trait rating to determine the dice pool of the roll. XXWhen a faction takes an action with uncertain outcome, you might\n\nuse their Tier rating to make a fortune roll.\n\nXXWhen\n\nsomething happens aboard the players’ ship, use the appropriate system quality rating for the roll.\n\nXXWhen\n\na Way power or artifact manifests with uncertain results, you might use its magnitude for a fortune roll. a PC gathers information, you might make a fortune roll using their action rating to determine the amount and quality of the info they get.\n\nXXWhen\n\nIf no trait applies, roll 1d for sheer luck or create a dice pool (from one to four) based on the situation at hand. If two parties are directly opposed, make a fortune roll for each side to see how they do, then assess the outcome of the situation by comparing their performance levels.\n\n38\n\nFORTUNE ROLL 1d for each TRAIT rating\n\ncritical: Exceptional result / Great, extreme\n\n+\n\n1d per MAJOR ADVANTAGE\n\n6: Good result / Standard, full effect.\n\n-\n\n1d per MAJOR DISADVANTAGE\n\n1-3: Bad result / Poor, little effect.\n\n\n\neffect.\n\n4/5: Mixed result / Limited, partial effect.\n\nThe fortune roll is also a good tool to help the GM manage all the moving parts of the world. Sometimes a quick roll is enough to answer a question or inspire an idea for what might happen next. Other examples of fortune rolls: PCs instigate a war between two factions. How does it turn out? Does either side dominate? Are both made vulnerable by the conflict? Make a few fortune rolls to find out.\n\nXXA strange sickness plagues the industrial world of Indri. How has\n\nthe outbreak affected the populace? The GM assigns a magnitude to the plague and makes a fortune roll to judge its spread.\n\nXXThe Muscle stakes out a good spot and makes a sniper shot against\n\na gang leader entering his office. The controlled scrap roll is a success, but is great effect enough to instantly kill a grizzled gang leader? Instead of making a progress clock for the target, the GM decides to make a fortune roll to see if he survives the attack. The roll is a 4/5: it’s a mortal wound. He has only hours to live unless his gang can get him to a doctor in time.\n\nFortune Roll // 1\n\nXXThe\n\nXXThe\n\nLegion have been tracking the PCs’ crew of smugglers for a while now. How quickly will they get enough evidence to result in a warrant? The crew’s wanted level in their current system counts as a major advantage for the Legion.\n\nXXThe\n\nPCs face off in a fight with a Nightspeaker captain and her crew. The battle goes in the PCs’ favor, and many crew members are killed. One player asks if the captain will surrender to spare the rest of her crew. The GM isn’t sure. How coldhearted is this Cultist? She’s seen things in the void that would still the heart of lesser women—is there anything human left inside her? The GM makes a 2d fortune roll for “human feelings” to see if a spark of compassion remains in her heart. If so, maybe one of the PCs can roll to consort, sway, or command her to stand down.\n\n39\n\nGATHERING INFORMATION\n\nThe flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say everything—it would take forever, and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate their world. When you want to know something specific about the world, your character can gather information. The GM will ask you how your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past). If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for—set the position based on the obstacle. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nEach attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question. Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect. The most common gather information actions are studying the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on, or hacking a system for secrets and intelligence. Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to scramble to a good rock outcropping first and then study the Janus Syndicate goons during the handoff.\n\nINVESTIGATION Some questions are too complex to answer immediately with a single gather information roll. For instance, you might want to discover the network of dark hyperlane smuggling routes in the system. In these cases, the GM will tell you to start a long-term project that you work on during downtime. You track the investigation project using a progress clock. Once the clock is filled, you have the evidence you need to ask several questions about the subject of your investigation as if you had great effect.\n\n40\n\nGATHER INFORMATION great : You get exceptional details. The\n\ninformation is complete and follow-up questions may expand into related areas or reveal more than you hoped for. standard: You get good details. Clarifying and\n\nfollow-up questions are possible.\n\nlimited : You get incomplete or partial\n\ninformation. More information gathering will be needed to get all the answers.\n\nEXAMPLES AND QUESTIONS XXYou might attune to see echoes of recent Way activity. Have any\n\npowerful mystics been here? How can I find the Ur artifact that speaks to me in my dreams? What should I be worried about?\n\nXXYou\n\nmight command a local Guilder to tell you about the secret meetings held in the factory at night. What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?\n\nXXYou\n\nmight consort with a well-connected friend to learn the secrets of an enemy or rival. What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives?\n\nXXYou\n\nmight skulk across the city, following a courier to discover who’s receiving prototypes from a high-level Guild engineer. Where does the package end up? Who signed for the delivery? might study an Ur artifact to discover a mystic secret. How can I power this device? Will anyone sense if it’s activated?\n\nXXYou\n\nGathering Information // 1\n\nAsk a question and make an action roll or a fortune roll. The GM answers honestly with a level of detail depending on the effect level.\n\nXXOr you might study a person to read their intentions and feelings.\n\nWhat are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?\n\nXXYou might examine a plague as a doctor. Where did this disease\n\ncome from? How can I cure it?\n\nXXOr you\n\nmight doctor a wounded pirate when you ally with their gang. Are they going to betray us? What do they really want?\n\nXXYou\n\nmight sway a powerful Noble at a party to divulge his plans. How can I convince him I might be a good partner in those plans?\n\nXXOr you\n\nmight sway his bodyguard to confide in you about recent events. Where has he been lately? Who’s he been meeting with?\n\n41\n\n42\n\nEXAMPLE OF PLAY\n\nPROFESSIONAL DISCOURTESY\n\nThe Cobalt Syndicate has been butting heads with the crew of the Faraday ever since that deal on Rin went south. A fair number of these struggles have been on Outpost SB-176, a fairly important shipping nexus and prime turf for finding smuggling jobs.\n\nCaptain Aman smiles and makes pleasantries. “T’kala! So good to see you. We aren’t prepared to make any donations just yet. I’m sure we can send something along at some point to your office. We’ve known each other long enough, so that should be sufficient, no?” Sounds like a sway roll, and Juan (Aman’s player) goes with this. The GM reveals that T’kala is being leaned on by her new bosses, and they’ve sent a watchful crew to ensure T’kala puts the screws to the PCs. She can’t just walk away with empty promises—this is a risky roll with limited effect. Juan gets 3d for Aman’s sway rating, plus 1d for an assist from Aleera Suhn, the crew’s Muscle and all-around intimidating presence. Suhn’s player Rachel describes walking up behind the aging dockmaster and looming over her shoulder while Aman is all smiles. Juan rolls 4d and gets 4/5—partial success.\n\nExample of Play // 1\n\nAfter returning from a job, the crew finds their friend T’kala nervously pacing at their berth. She greets the crew with an anxious smile and a welcoming hand, but the prominent Cobalt stripe, indicating membership in the Syndicate, can’t be missed. “Sorry to do this to you friends, but you may have heard about the recent dock acquisitions. There’s a matter of a new fee you’ll have to pay…” In the background, loitering in close distance, are several dockhands/gang members ready to respond.\n\nAman convinces T’kala that deferring the discussion to a more appropriate time is the best course of action. The GM describes T’kala’s reactions: “Nervously, she swallows and nods, backing away and going on about regulations and forms that need to be filed. The Cobalt dockhands look at each other in confusion and then anger.” It was a partial success, so Aman also suffers a consequence. Harm isn’t really appropriate (yet). A simple complication makes sense though, and the GM says that while T’kala is satisfied, the gang members sent here to ensure the crew paid their dues will not be. “The gang picks up rebar and pipes lying around the place and surrounds the crew,” the GM says.\n\n43\n\nSHOWDOWN AT THE DOCKS Juan wants to resist the consequence of the last roll. Being surrounded sounds like a bad idea. Since there’s no gunfire yet, Aman simply moves back to the catwalk before the gang can surround them. Juan rolls 2d for Aman’s prowess attribute and gets a 4. He takes 2 stress and avoids the complication. The Syndicate still outnumbers them, but the crew will have somewhere to go if this gets ugly. Juan and Rachel discuss some options for how to get the Cobalt Syndicate to back down. Perhaps brandishing some heavy weaponry would deter them from closing in. But Alice (playing Hayley Griffen, the Mechanic) is still onboard the ship. “I blare over the ship’s PA while angling the ship’s guns at them. ‘Not a chance, scumbags. Drop the weapons and get lost.’”\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nSo what action is this? Alice considers it and says, “Well, I’m trying to force them to leave. I’m technically using ship weapons, which would be helm, but I’m not going to miss at this distance, and I’d rather not even fire. I think this is command… which I have zero dice in. No time like the present!” Rachel volunteers to take a stress to give Alice a die from the assist—Suhn is quite imposing herself. Rachel asks for a Devil’s Bargain, and the GM has one—no matter how this turns out, T’kala is going to catch hell for this. “Never loved that woman anyway,” Rachel says as she picks up a second die. There’s also a gambit left in the crew’s pool, and Rachel opts to add that to her roll, for three dice. The GM says it’s a desperate roll because lighting up the dock with ship weapons would definitely cause the crew a ton of other problems, and the Syndicate knows that. Alice rolls and gets a 6! She smiles confidently and says, “Yeah! That’s what I thought!” But is this enough to make them back down? They’re certainly not going to press forward into the maw of particle cannons, but are they just going to leave? The GM says, “I think you’d get them to back off, but I don’t think they’d leave the dock entirely. The Cobalt Syndicate are looking for ways to get into it with your crew. They’ll probably move to a safe distance and wait you out, even setting up shifts if they have to. You’ll still have to figure out how to get that smuggled cargo of yours into the station proper.” “Yeah, that makes sense, but hold on,” Alice says. “I can push myself for extra effect, right? If Hayley takes 2 stress for +1 effect, to make it great effect, is that enough to clear us a path to our contact?”\n\n44\n\n“Oh, wow, yeah, that would do it. Normally you would push for effect before your roll, but since we didn’t really talk about what standard effect was up front, I’d be fine with you pushing now. Maybe you fire a few shots into some unimportant crates and they all scatter? No additional heat needed, just flavor. A few crates explode dramatically, Cobalt thugs go running, and that’s the end of things.”\n\nQUESTIONS TO CONSIDER XXCould T’kala’s relationship with the crew (as a crew contact) have\n\nmade the situation easier or more complicated than it already was? Would you have given Aman a controlled position? Or should the situation have been desperate because of the obvious leverage the Syndicate had over T’kala, and the crew owing her as a friend?\n\nXXWhat about Griffen’s effect level? Do you think she needed great\n\neffect for that result, or was standard enough already? How would you judge it at your table?\n\n45\n\nPC VS. PC\n\nIt’s common for two or more PCs to come into conflict. Mechanically, the rules for PC vs. PC action are the same for PC vs. NPC action. You still use action, resistance, fortune rolls, effects, and consequences. These resolve into new situations that may require more rolls. But though it’s mechanically straightforward, it’s not exactly the same. There are guidelines you should follow when PCs start to battle it out. XXHalt\n\nplay for a bit. When two PCs conflict, it’s like two writers arguing over the direction of the story they’re working on. You don’t need to rush to roll dice. Instead, pause what you’re doing and figure out how things should proceed. “Who acts first” is sometimes a sticking point for players, especially when blasters are drawn. Usually the answer is clear from the situation—one player is acting while the other is reacting. When it’s not, you can make fortune rolls to see who gets the drop on whom—have each player make an action roll and compare the results.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\nXXDecide how to resolve the conflict. Determine what’s at stake, what\n\nactions need to be rolled, and what outcomes might occur from those actions. If you want to go down a different road, speak up! This is why pausing play is important—it gives you the moment to really consider what’s going to happen. If you can’t agree on how to resolve the conflict, you’re at an impasse.\n\nXXAsk about the situation to establish how things will resolve. You\n\nmight ask, “Can your character be swayed into going along with my plan?” or “Are you all up in my character’s face or are we shouting from across the room?” or even “Is your character out for blood here, or is this about your appearance to the rest of the crew?”\n\nXXLive with the results. Once you decide on the resolution method,\n\nfollow through with that method and stick to the outcomes. Rather than argue with the process, use the outs the system already gives you—bad results can be resisted, armor is often an option, and the future remains open to new courses of action.\n\nThere are no specific player vs. player mechanics. When the PCs fight, the players are still collaborating and making judgments about what happens, like any other event. Conflicts between players are outside the scope of the game; no roll or mechanic can resolve a dispute between people. Talk with your friends and resolve any interpersonal conflicts that come up so PC vs. PC conflicts can just be about the story you’re telling.\n\n46\n\n47\n\nCRED & STASH CRED\n\nWe use cred as an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets. Most forms of currency these days are backed by Counters Guild technologies or by Guild interests. Numerous physical currencies exist but most exchange these denominations through the Counters Guild into standard Hegemonic credit. These creds are carried on devices provided by the Guild, colloquially called “sticks.” The few nominal credits or bills PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to toss a few creds around to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC’s lifestyle quality for a fortune roll (see stash on the next page).\n\nMONETARY VALUES 1 cred: A stick full of credits. A month’s wages.\n\n1 // THE BASICS\n\n2 cred: A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes. 3 cred: An exquisite jewel. A case full of hard currency. 4 cred: A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of rare metals and valuables. A rare artifact. 6 cred: Liquidating a significant asset—a hovercar, a small house. 8 cred: A treasure trove. 10 cred: A small personal ship. More than 4 cred is an impractical amount to keep unnoticed by the Guild. You must spend the excess or put it in your stash (see below). A crew can also store 4 cred in their ship, by default. Any cred beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next job) or be distributed among the crew members.\n\nCRED USE Spend 1 cred to get an additional activity during downtime (see page 184). Spend 1 cred to increase the result level of a downtime activity roll. Spend cred to avoid certain crew entanglements (see page 180). Put cred in your character’s stash (1-for-1) to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire (see the next page). Spend cred when you advance your crew quality (see page 51).\n\n48\n\nSTASH & RETIREMENT When you mark your character’s final Trauma and they retire, the amount of cred they’ve managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet. stash 0-10: Poor soul. You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery. stash 11-20: Meager. A tiny hovel that you can call your own. stash 21-39: Modest. A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a bar or small business. stash 40: Fine. A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.\n\nRay Aman, Captain of the Faraday, is dressed to impress his sometime-rival Rhin, a fellow smuggler. Aman flouts his newfound wealth from several successful jobs as he crows in the bar about how a smuggler like Rhin will never have as fine a coat as his. But Aman is just a criminal with a ship, so how impressive a coat is it, really? The GM can call for a fortune roll using Aman’s lifestyle as the dice pool to find out how elegant the coat really is.
