        "text": "bleak: Okay so Cobra Triangle is one of these old Rare games (I'm pretty sure it's Rare) where you pilot a boat in a NO HOLDS BARRED DEATH RACE TO THE FINISH. It's got a Gradius-like powerup system where you get little moving buoys to give you points across the bottom of the screen so you can upgrade your speed, weapons, get missiles, all sorts of fun shit. Now the best part about the game isn't the boats, or the weapon system, it's the fucking BALLS ASS HARD HUGE VARIETY OF LEVELS that the game runs you through. You have to get this game like fucking clockwork in order to beat it. You have the standard death race, which is easy. Immediately after each death race, you have to fight some sort of giant, impossible sea creature. I can't help but die at least once to each sea creature in the game, even now. Then you have the 'dispose of mines' levels, which are easy at first, but the boats get so fast you have to do some fancy footwork to evade them. THEN, you've got the rescue the hostages levels, which are just fuck you annoying. Little boats try and come and steal your dudes and you have to kill the boats before they get off screen. It's all well and good, pretty hard until the fucking ROBOT BUOYS WITH STUN MISSILES COME ON and say FUCK YOU, COBRA TRIANGLE BOAT! fuck that mission. Okay so anyway after that you have to do some sort of obstacle course thing, and that's usually where I die. not on the first or second obstacle course, but on the third, where you have to dodge giant, manic death icicles instead of logs leisurely floating downstream or jumping across 4 or 5 consecutive waterfalls. (that level is the one that consistently boggles my mind, on a physics level) I've yet to get past those fucking icicles. But I'll be goddamned if Cobra Triangle isn't a wonderful game."
