' :;7 \\ It’s easy to think that bad games are just plain bad for our videogaming world. Makes sense— how many millions of hours and dollars have been wasted on games that ultimately suck? Can you even imagine the tremendous effort that developers make to create and market a title — the impossibly long hours, the dozens of lost weekends— only to have their game garner a 2/10 in such venerable magazines as the one you are holding? All to which I say: Keep up the good work! Bad games are good for gaming. How else would we know what good games are? There'd be no easy measure of quality. There'd be nothing to poke fun at. And then there'd be the problem of every game either being \"good\" or \"great.\" Because the good games would be considered bad, when they're actually good. Hmm— do you see what I'm getting at? No? Well, then maybe you should read our picks of the best games of 2003 (page 48). Here you'll find the veritable cream of the crop from last year— and not a bad game in sight. Promise. P.S.: Please do us the honor of reading Milky's stellar feature on Astro Boy and find out what makes Tezuka's boy robot tick. Dom Byron_Editor-in-Chief S'f'A'R'RQ'Ug tom hyron as editor-in-chief dom hyron as editor-in-chief ? James mieCke as executive editor carrie shejjherd as managing editor gerry serrano as art director with carofine king as designer and introducing andrew jfister as reviews editor THE VOUNG RND THE RESTLESS xas-T MOiTfiT, otT §5ucr.... Change is in the air: With erstwhile news editor and eccentric billionaire balloonist Tom Price still lost somewhere over the Pacific, the staff of GMR found itself shorthanded for the crucial April issue: the one that would determine whether GMR would continue on as a videogame publication or be purchased by the nefarious MagazineCORP and transformed into a biweekly sock catalog. Pfister, consumed by the stress of his new position and believing he was responsible for Tom Price's disappearance, got drunk and drove his Porsche off the Golden Gate Bridge. While visiting the comatose editor in the hospital, James finally professed his love for Caroline. Meanwhile, Carrie learned that she was pregnant with quintuplets and wondered if it could have been a side effect from her recent demonic possession. Gerry, believing he was the father, took on a second job as a mariachi singer outside the local Taco Bell. Tom Byron won a decisive court battle against his identical twin and temporarily regained editorial control of the magazine. During the celebratory party, James sneaked away to feed his crippling FFXI habit, but Gerry saw him and confronted him. Meanwhile, down at the lake cottage, Carrie finally professed her love for Caroline. At the hospital, Dom attempted to suffocate Andrew with a pillow, but he miraculously awoke in time. Dom fled before security could arrive, but left behind a book: High-Altitude Balloon Sabotage, Import Brake Tampering, Raising Quintuplets, and Being In Love With Caroline For Dummies. But the name on the library check-out slip was not what Andrew expected....

RND IT'S NOT RBOUT BRERSTS! FRLL FROm GRACE I’ve been reading GMR since its first issue, which is the source of my question. In your first issue (February 2003), you made a list of what you thought would be the top 50 games of the year. This year (February 2004), you made a list of your picks for the best to come in 2004. Unfortunately, a lot of the top games on your 2003 list were delayed until 2004 (such as Halo 2, which placed first; Doom 3, which got second; and Fable, which got sixth). What strikes me as odd is that all of these games have gone down significantly in your new batch of predictions. Halo 2 fell from first place to third, Doom 3 fell from second to fifth, and Fable fell from sixth place all the way to 26th. So my question is, what changed between then and now to make you desire these games less? Delays are never popular, but they're usually done to ensure that the game is as good as it can be when it is finally released. P.S. Why did Kingdom Hearts 2 and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories share a spot? From what I can gather, they're two entirely different games. _terran8888 Unfortunately, the reality in videogame development is that delays often result in a lesser product, primarily because the technology a game starts with gets older and less impressive. There’s also the simple fact that other games— which weren’t there to compare against in 2003— have now risen to the forefront of anticipatory drool fodder. And yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2 and Chain of Memories are two different games— but they are both sequels to the first Square-Disney collaboration. Plus, putting both at No. 7 was a sneaky way for us to squeeze in 51 games. FRllOUT OF FALLOUT Well, please allow me to start off like everyone else by saying, \"I love your magazine!” Sorry, it’s tradition, I guess. Your previews and reviews have saved me from a lot of bad gaming decisions, although there were some that couldn't be helped. I still don't know what you guys have against Enter the Matrix, though. I guess I’m just too much of a Matrix freak. Anyway, could I request a big review of StarCraft: Ghost in the near future? I especially want to hear about any multiplayer info. I’m just itching to call a nuke on my brother and best friend in the same shot. Also, I found something confusing. In Issue #14, you did a review of Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. In it, you said, \"Wait For It: Fallout 3.\" However, Issue #13 mentioned that Black Isle Studios closed. What exactly is happening with Black Isle right now? I loved PlaneScape: Torment, as well as Fallout 1 and 2, and my best friend (the one I plan to nuke) is freaking out about this, as well as the fact that his copy of Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel is very, very late. _Loyal Reader (Now with 75 percent more free will!) As for StarCraft Ghost— you can request a review all you want, but we can’t do one until we get the game! We’ll do a preview, though, as soon as we get some new details. Black Isle’s parent company, Interplay, has long been under financial duress and decided to shutter the division in late December. Whether any company will pick up and continue with Black Isle's now-shelved Fallout series remains to be seen. Brotherhood of Steel, however, should safely be on store shelves. mESSAGE BOARD JUNKIES Want to help save the world? Then go to school. Want to waste countless hours talking about videogames? Then go to www.gmrmagazine.com and click on the word \" Boards . \" This month, we asked the natives what they thought of Nintendo's latest foray into weirdness, also known as the dual-screened Nintendo DS.... Well, it probably plays a killer game of Battleship with those dual screens. And it better have AT LEAST six face buttons, just in case they port fighting games to this thing. _Alt_Ctrl_Delete What really makes me curious is what this means for GBA. Will Nintendo really be able to support two different portable systems, especially after the PSP comes out. which will only help make GBA SP look archaic in comparison? Considering that most of Nintendo's business is derived from its GBA sales, possibly fracturing its customer base with two different portable systems doesn't sound like the smartest idea ever. _Krispy 14 POST -> Unbelievable though it may seem, some suckers will pay actual money for this on eBay. WRITE US: GmRfQZIFFDRUIS.com HVPOCRITES I'm really sick and tired of hearing people complain about violence in videogames. I will admit, it has gotten a little bit excessive, but it’s not as out of control as the movies and TV programs we see today. By comparison, videogames are actually quite tame. My theory is that since the majority of adults do not play videogames, they feel they can criticize games all they want because it won't affect them. If we were to ban certain movies or make everything on television into a PG program, we would certainly hear them complaining, too, but isn't violence violence no matter which media outlet it comes from? Everyone who complains, in short, is a hypocrite. _Gen Rossman And should be shot! SCOOP? I thought you only reviewed finished games. So imagine my surprise when I saw the Ninja Gaiden review in Issue #12. If Ninja Gaiden really was finished in November when you wrote your review, why was it delayed until late February? You have to admit it looks bad. One might draw the conclusion that you guys reviewed an incomplete game in order to get the scoop on your competitors. But then Tecmo screwed you over when it delayed the game. _Charles Davey When we reviewed Ninja Gaiden, we believed the code we had was the finished product, but after our review went to press, we learned that Tecmo decided to tweak the game. We will publish a new review in our next issue...assuming we get the finished game. Heh. Good point, Demetrius. And another thing, Ryan: You HAVE a girlfriend. So shut up. GIRL CRLL I was checking out your two most recent issues and noticed that there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of female response to this magazine. Maybe it's just not being shown? I'm not a crazy feminist gamer who demands to be noticed by a male- dominated industry. I'm just curious as to what you guys think about your female market. And just a heads up: No, I don't play cutesy Barbie and happy sunshine games. Give me an RPG or an action game over anything. _Shae \"Slack'' Sackman SITIRRT SHOPPER The other day, I was at a local record store and when I went to pay for the CDs I was buying, I saw that they had an old Panasonic 3D0 system sitting on the counter. When I inquired about it, they said someone had brought it in about a half hour before that. Their original price for the package was $40, but I talked them down to $24! And it wasn't just the system, it was the system with two controllers and the following games: 20th Century Video Almanac, Battle Chess, The Daedalus Encounter (which features Tia Carrere), D&D: Deathkeep, Demolition Man, Doom, Dragon's Lair, Guardian War, Take 2's Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller, Mad Dog II, John Madden Football (which looks just like my GBA version), Need for Speed, Night Trap, Plumbers Don't Wear Ties, Shanghai: Triple Threat, Twisted: The Game Show, and Way of the Warrior (which looks like Mortal Kombat with real people as fighters— think the Adema \"Immortal” music video in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance}. Better yet, I found out that I could sell all of this stuff on eBay for upward of $100! Talk about right place, right time, huh? And finally, please publish this so I can share my accomplishments with the world (or at least your reader base). Later. _Brandon Ratliff LIUE LRBEL Can you guys add a little note like (L) or (XBL) to identify an Xbox Live-capable game? That little tidbit of info would be a great help to us otherwise loner gamers in our search for good games to wait for. _Dan M. NY Good idea. We’ll be tweaking our design in the near future, so let us know what other changes you’d like to see. No promises, but we still want to hear your ideas. UUHIIMER In response to Ryan, who can't get his girlfriend to play Halo with him (Post, Issue #14): Dude, what the hell is wrong with you? You got your girlfriend to play Soul Calibur II and Animal Crossing with you, isn’t that enough? I still can’t play Soul Calibur around my girlfriend because every time I have to fight Ivy or Talim, she thinks I'm looking at their bodies. Stop complaining. _Demetrius If it still doesn't have a headphone jack, all hell will break loose.... _atomic_gerbil I think Virtual Boy grew up to be a Virtual Man, mated with an N-Gage, and had a retarded child. _LuigiSunshine This thing's success all depends on Nintendo’s ability to prove that there are practical applications for two screens (I see none). Show me some software that makes concentrating on two screens appealing, and I'll show you the contents of my wallet. _DQ Now, while nothing is written in stone, I just don't see how a second screen will really come into play. It almost seems like Nintendo's taking its GBA/GC connectivity deal, packaging it into ANOTHER handheld system, and selling it all over again. _GopherCakes POST WRITE US: GmR0ZIFFDnUIS.com Our circulation department inform us that our readership is 95 percent male. You, Slack, are a rare gem. SRUE SRMITV How does one get the message across to programmers regarding game saves? I am so tired of spending an hour or more on a particularly hard part of a game, only to have the phone ring, be called for a meal, or have to go to an appointment, causing all the good, hard work I have done to be lost because I am unable to save. How many times does one hear the argument \"I can’t do this or that chore because I will lose everything.” Come on, put in random saves. Not everyone can play a game in one hour or less, and families are being ripped apart. _Doreen Box We’ve heard plenty of complaints about the lack of save points in games, but the “families being ripped apart” thing is something we hadn’t considered. Write your congressperson! Maybe there should be a law! BRRINSTORITI I just had this unbelievable brainstorm: an FPS where you are a psychic! Instead of a gun, the game just shows your outstretched hand, which, when you equip a powerful move, may glow or tremble. You use only psychic powers in your quest. You may want to use this power to throw enemies on their backs or up against walls, pull objects off of walls or floors (fire extinguishers, paintings, tables), or even pull rugs out from under people’s feet. Near the end of the game, maybe you would have to fight entire armies— you could hurl cars at them or stop their bullets Neo style and push them back. When you switch psychic powers, you have a power gauge for each one that runs down as you use it, but it recharges gradually. Moves like throwing objects recharge almost instantaneously, whereas moves like making people explode recharge very slowly. Has a game this cool ever been conceived? This could be the coolest game ever. Can I get an “amen” from my friends at GMR ? _young-criminal Has a game this cool ever been conceived? Sort of. Your idea reminds us of Psychonauts, which is in development at Tim Schafer’s studio, Double Fine Productions. It’s not a first- person shooter, but your character must use paranormal powers, such as telekinesis, levitation, and pyrokinesis. The game has been delayed until late this year, though, so you still have time to beat it to the market. GEEZER SIGHTING I'm typing this because I saw the Game Geezer. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I am sure it was him. I was sitting in a roadside cafe in Redcliffe, Australia, and there was a hobo begging for money and playing his guitar. At first, I didn’t look twice. Later on, I went over and gave him a $5 bill (I was feeling generous— I'm a real sucker for that stuff). He swiped the money out of my hand and said, “Whach this? Oh, thanks kid, there just ain’t no love for little geezer no more, nope, there just ain’t no love.” When I got a look at his face, I was amazed to see that he looked— no, he was identical to— the Game Geezer. Maybe the Geezer's got himself a long-lost bro? Or an identical twin? _Xx_B rAsS_M o N k Ey_xX Or maybe it was him! UURRfn UUELCOmE What the sh*t were you guys thinking when you said that Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was number four of the five worst Star Wars games ever? That game is not as bad as Star Wars for Game Boy. Switch ’em, damn it! I am, however, ecstatic about your new editor-in- chief, Tom Byron. The more Star Wars fans, the better. May the Force be with you, Tom _A totally pissed-off fan (aka Imperial Lance Corporal Eafai Mecy) QUOTE OF THE mONTH: OK, I’m sorry, I’m just a little bummed by this thing. Well, it can totally make up for any weirdness if it’ll let me view porno on one screen while playing games on the other. That would be true innovation. firestar46 © Ziff Davis Media, Inc.

GMR NEWS NETWORK neuj games, gameplanner charts, pre-order, stuff X FRONT -> Illustration by Hoops We have no idea what the DS will look like, and Nintendo isn’t ready to reveal anything. That’s why we thought we’d have a little fun, and commissioned this artist’s design concept. The GMR DS features a sleek, modern, yet simple form, in line with recent Nintendo systems. Aside from the obvious dual screens, note the side panels that house the shoulder buttons and— gasp!— a headphone jack. We built our version with wireless connectivity in mind, opting for the radio- frequency (RF) approach. With stereo speakers, 3D screens, and a concave, ultracomfortable D-pad, we think Nintendo has a winner. Or GMR does. GBA GC NINTENDO BETS BIG ON ITS fTlVSTERIOUS NEW DUAL-SCREEN HANDHELD JAPAN Nintendo is full of surprises these days. Since last fall, the company has been touting a major new product for 2004. Nintendo calls it \"Ishitsu na shinshouhin,” which means \"heterogeneous new product” in English, although it makes little sense in either language. Now it has a code name: Nintendo DS. But Nintendo has plenty of secrets left to reveal. DS stands for \"dual screen.\" Nintendo's first surprise is that its next handheld will have two displays, a pair of identical 3-inch TFT LCD screens. Each screen will be powered by its own processor, with an ARM9 central processor for the main screen (the same CPU as Tapwave’s Zodiac handheld) and an ARM7 subprocessor for the secondary screen (the same CPU as the existing Game Boy Advance). The two screens can independently display different images— a sports game might show a wide view of the field and a close-up of a player, while a Metal Gear game might use that extra screen for the Codec display. And. ..is that it? Not quite. After the initial announcement, Nintendo dropped a few more hints: Like the GBA SP, the DS has a rechargeable battery, the screens are backlit for optimum low-light viewing, and Shigeru Miyamoto is leading the first-party game-development effort. Nintendo maintains that the dual- screen gimmick is still just part of the story. The DS has other capabilities — which won't be revealed until this May’s E3, the annual game industry trade show in Los Angeles. Speculation on those features has run rampant from newfangled 3D LCD-screen technology to wireless communications capability to a digital-camera input device similar to Sony's Eye Toy. According to Japan's Famitsu Weekly, the DS will deliver games via memory cards rather than the larger ROM cartridges traditionally used for handhelds. The question of backward compatibility with GBA games is still being discussed. Meanwhile, Nintendo is careful to stress that this isn't the next Game Boy. After the DS ships worldwide at the end of 2004— around the same time as Sony's PSP— Nintendo still plans to release direct successors to both GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Start saving your money now. 21 FRONT x □MR NEIA/5 NETWORK neuj games gameplanner. charts, preorder stuff NINTENDO SPERKS ON THE DS With all the speculation surrounding the DS, we thought we’d just ask Nintendo directly. Perrin Kaplan, vice president of marketing and corporate communications for Nintendo of America, kindly answered our questions.. .but keeps us speculating. GMR: Is the DS a move to counter Sony's handheld plans, or is it part of a bigger strategy? PK: Nintendo always has something new in the portable arena in development. [The DS] was a unique idea that came to the fore and Nintendo decided to pursue it. It's a different product than our current SP product. They complement each other well. No, this is not a counter to Sony's product. We haven't seen their XB product. The DS is part of a bigger strategy of continuing to maintain PC the 96 percent market share we currently enjoy. PS2 GMR: But the DS is a portable GBA system that plays videogames. With plans to continue the regular Game ^ Boy line, how will Nintendo avoid consumers' confusion? PK: When you see the product at E3, it will become clear. We will be able to support both products with separate campaigns. Portable play continues to be very hot, and consumers have an insatiable appetite for trying out new ways to enjoy games on the go. GMR: Do the projected DS user base and the existing Game Boy user base overlap, or do you expect different audiences? PK: Some same and some different. Many early adopters will want to own both. GMR: Considering what happened with the Virtual Boy, are you at all concerned about a nontraditional gaming machine not gaining acceptance or developer support? PK: Virtual Boy was in a category of its own since it was such a unique proposition. Portable play has been well established by Nintendo, and players want to experience more and more. This will help feed that appetite. GMR: What has Japanese and Western third-party reaction been like? PK: We are talking to third parties now, so you'll hear more soon! We think they’ll find it appealing. I# THERE'S STILL TlfTIE. NINTENDO If [the DS] had a video camera on the back with an output to one of the screens, then it would be like you were looking through the device. You could walk around playing a game on one screen while watching where you’re going on the other screen.

PILGRIM WWW.BAM4FUN.COM Your word of the day is “Gackt.” The Japanese rock idol who bears that unusual name— and who also claims to be five centuries old— will make his American videogame debut in Bujingai. Bam! Entertainment is publishing developer Red's [Gungrave] PS2 slash-em-up in the United States this May. I# [SCREEN] r ANIME REPORT CRPTRIN HERIOCK: SPRCE PIRRTE AVAILABLE NOW// PRICE: $29.98// RUNNING TIME: Aimed at a young and insecure jW audience, Japanese animation typically features heroes its audience can identify with. To varying degrees, certainly— not all shows descend to the fantasy-fulfilling depths of Oh! My Goddess or Love Hina — but as a rule, you can see something of the viewer in the protagonist. The idea is to create a sense of identification with the character, letting the viewer see the hero’s troubles and challenges as his own. And then there is Captain Herlock, the ultimate expression of human potential. In him, we're not meant to see what we are, but perhaps what we could one day be. Leiji Matsumoto inspires that sort of thought. He has never thought small, not even once, in his career. His stuff is epic— Yamato, Galaxy Express, Arcadia of My Youth— and he makes no apologies for its grand scope. This is the man who nearly got away with doing animated Wagner, after all. 100 MINUTES// RATING: 13 AND UP// Captain Herlock, the latest appearance of the legendary space pirate, doesn't aim quite as high as the overambitious Harlock Saga. Rather than a tale of gods and heroes, it’s just a bloody well-done Matsumoto story. After the success of Metropolis, Rin Taro directs this series, with screen writing from Sadayuki Murai [Millennium Actress) and fine production from Studio Madhouse. This is Rin Taro's return to the material after two decades— he worked with Matsumoto on the original Herlock TV series— and he hasn't lost the touch. Herlock wisely introduces a touch of audience identification in the form of a brash young recruit on board the Arcadia. But this is still Herlock’s show, and his legend is what gives it life. SPECIAL FEATURES: 5.1- channel surround sound livens up the English and Japanese voice tracks, and obsessive types can try to collect four different bonus pencil boards.

PSP ROUNDUP With PSP set for release in early December, it’s safe to assume that things are cranking on the development front. While Sony continues to be tight-lipped on just about every detail of the machine, some digging has revealed a number of projects on the go. Electronic Arts is said to be quite enamored of PSP, and I've heard that the system's launch will see a Madden game and an SSX game at the very least. Sony itself is obviously readying a whole slew of games, and hopefully we'll be spared of the PS2-launch junk and see some top-shelf franchises right out of the gate. There have been lots of reports of a portable Hot Shots Golf in the works, but I've also heard rumors of Twisted Metal and Gran Turismo. Namco is said to have a new Ridge Racer up and running, with a Tekken game also possibly on track for December, too. Sega is working on something, which could be Astro Boy, or less likely, Sonic. Koei is said to have a Dynasty Warriors game, and Konami is apparently tinkering with some kind of Metal Gear derivative. As previously reported, Square Enix has yet to commit to the system, but there are rumblings of a Final Fantasy game with a Crystal Chronicles- type subtitle. 1# _M’m Oavison is chief of the QffkM m.

CLONE WARS I hate PC gaming. No, I don’t. Not really. But every time I play a great console game brimming with creativity, I get frustrated at how it seems to be getting harder to find the same level of creativity in the PC arena. Case in point: Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando. Here's a PS2 game that offers something new and fun around every corner. There have been 8 billion platform games by my count since the late '80s, yet Ratchet & Clank's developers still found ways to make the genre seem fresh, relevant, and exciting. Compare this now to, say, the RTS genre on PC. Basically, every game that comes out is either a WarCraft III or an Age of Empires clone. And it's been this way for years. Blizzard and Ensemble innovate, sell millions, and then everyone else copies them to death. Did we really need Lords of EverQuest ? No, we didn't — we already had WarCraft III. Not every game has to, or should, reinvent the wheel every single time. But, you know, a few new spokes on the wheel wouldn't kill you either. PC developers need to spend a little less time trying to duplicate the success of others and more time finding ways to get us excited again. Give me a reason to stick this PS2 in the closet. Please.

If there’s one thing the folks at Capcom like to do, it’s booze and gamble. That explains the annual trips to Vegas to showcase their upcoming goods for the year, although they usually reserve a couple things for E3 in May. So, what did they bring to the party this January? A bunch of stuff. Among the titles we got to take a deeper look at were Monster Hunter, a PSO- style online multiplayer game that looks fantastic. The controls are a little unconventional, but we’ll reserve judgement until we get a playable version for ourselves. Other titles include its upcoming Halloween tricky treat, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and its soon-to-be-released star vehicle Onimusha 3. Keiji Inafune, the producer of the Onimusha series, also unveiled a surprise in the form of Shadows of Rome, a gladiatorial action game filled with mystery and intrigue (along with some awesome chariot races and arena battles) that's being developed by the Onimusha 2 team. Other highlights were Mega Man X: Command Mission, a cel-shaded RPG; Mega Man Battle Network 4; Red Sun (and Blue Moon); and two games that we’ll reveal to you in one month’s time. What are they? You’ll have to guess, but one of them features a guy with a gun, and the other features a character with major issues. We could tell you more, but then we’d have to kill you. 1# .More info at www.capcom.com SEDA SNAGS SAMURAI BUT UU HRT ELSE DOES IT HRUE COmiNGP ■■■■I U.S.A. Sega’s release schedule is looking sparse these days. Astro Boy’s summer arrival is great news, but the only other newly announced game on its list is Samurai Jack. The Xbox, PS2, and GameCube adaptation of the Cartoon Network hit — by Azurik developer Adrenium— arrives in March between Nightshade (February) and Blood Will Tell (later this spring). Sega may have a lot left to show, though. Amusement Vision’s Toshihiro Nagoshi claims to have three games perking, including SpikeOut Extreme, and recently raved about the great projects he’s seen around Sega. We’ll see him put his money where his mouth is at E3.

Based on the D&D setting of the same name, the yet-to-be-titled Forgotten Realms is being developed by Stormfront Studios, which was responsible for 2002’s stellar The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The new Forgotten Realms, much like its predecessor, is a straightforward action-adventure experience. The events unfold across 11 -plus expansive levels, encompassing plenty of familiar Realms territory, such as Mithril Hall and the Jungles of Chult. We've also been told to expect a few familiar faces, including everyone’s favorite goody- two-shoes dark elf, Drizzt Do’Urden. The game’s story, crafted by fan-favorite Forgotten Realms novelist R. A. Salvatore and Emmy award-winning Batman Beyond scriptwriter Bob Goodman, deals with the release of several imprisoned demons who are bent on world domination. Three heroes band together to combat this menace: a powerful fighter, a fireball-flinging sorcerer, and a crafty rogue who specializes in sneak attacks. What ensues is sure to be a fast and furious hackfest, filled to the brim with trademark D&D baddies. One of the biggest new gameplay features is the ability to switch characters on the fly. You can jump between the three heroes at your whim while the computer handles your inactive party members. Each of the three characters has specific strengths, weaknesses, and flashy combo maneuvers, so expect to jump back and forth a lot. Forgotten Realms promises a rich game environment with plenty of plot twists, dazzling visuals, and a fully orchestrated musical score. Hardcore D&D fans will also recognize some familiar rule mechanics from the popular d20 role-playing system, though most of the number crunching is thankfully swept under the rug. So put your dice bag away, grab a controller, and get ready for some fast-paced D&D action this fall, I# __Ryars Scott _More info at www.atari.com JGamegPesign Development DEGREE PROGRAM Real World Education school of ► Game Design & Development ► Computer Animation ► Digital Media 800 . 226.7625 fullsail.com YOU CAN GET THERE FROM > HERE 3300 University Boulevard Winter Park, FL 32792 Financial aid available to those who qualify Job placement assistance Accredited College, ACCSCT © 2003 Full Sail, inc.

We chat with him about the 1980s; the upcoming PS2 game, Neo Contra \\ and lonely gamers. GMR: After Contra: Shattered Soldier, what prompted the move to all-3D action? NN: Well, after Shattered Soldier, we had discussions about giving the player a lot more freedom to make it a much more strategic game with the enemy and the player, and what came out was a new 3D game. GMR: Will the spread shot still look similar to the old-fashioned Contra shot, with the red balls that fire out? Or will it just have the signature stylistic elements of the classic Contra ? NN: Yes, we do have signature effects like you mention, but we cannot have everything the way it used to be, like the tiny red balls. We made things very sophisticated to match the environments. GMR: The game seems to have a great sense of humor. Is this deliberate? Watching your characters running on spinning helicopter blades like gerbils (while shooting) is comedy gold. NN: We love that scene, too. Actually, it's true— we will keep the sense of humor. But as you know, Contra is a war game, and if you make it just like war, then it's really boring and it’s really miserable, don't you think? Contra is something that you can get into and [have fun with]. GMR: When Contra began, it was done during the Reagan era. Very '80s, very Rambo. We're in a different era now, despite the Republican reign. Is Contra an anachronistic relic? NN: Yes, we're trying to make Contra fit with what’s currently happening right now. True, we started off during the gun-crazy '80s. It's something in the back of your mind, and in the '80s, Rambo was pretty popular, and with that, violence was like a way to justify things. But then again, in the 21st century, what is justice? You cannot really identify, simply, what it is. There are so many factors that you have to deal with. So it's not that easy, like it was back in the '80s. GMR: You were saying that you're going to make the story more prominent. How are you going to tell the story— through voice acting? NN: Well, between the stages, there are demo scenes. We ll have cut- scenes with voiceovers. And. of course, during these scenes, when the playable characters meet some important characters and trigger key events, there will be real-time movies. GMR: Have you ever thought about adding an A.I. partner to the single- player game? The basic human two- player team is more worth it, because it's fun playing together. If an A.I. character helps you out with something, do you think it would still be fun? If it's done well, it's fun. Sometimes it's hard to get people over to play, so in some ways, it's kind of fun because it feels like you have company. NN: Well, within the confines of Contra, Neo Contra will require two players playing cooperatively. But in the future, we'd definitely like to think about it. GMR: Contra for lonely people. NN: You're not lonely. !€■ I [BLIPS] SNK goes Xbox Live Between its censored King of Fighters compilation and Sony’s refusal to approve Metal Slug 3, SNK’s PS2 debut fell a little flat. It may do better on Xbox, though. SVC Chaos is coming to Microsoft's console with Xbox Live support, and it’s bringing along a straight port of Slug 3. SVC Chaos is SNK's riposte in the cross-company 2D fighting wars, starring familiar standards and out-there cameos like Mega Man's Zero. Slug needs no introduction— after all, it's the finest side-scrolling shooter in years. Neither title has a firm date beyond 2004. /; KBOH KIMOUUIEDGE THEY KNOW STUFF SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO! IT LIVES! The word on the ^ street (or, rather, superhighway) is that Microsoft will introduce a significant update to Xbox Live this spring, tentatively titled— gasp!— Xbox Live 3.0. The update is rumored to bring a number of enhancements, the most substantial of which will focus on communication and team/clan support. Microsoft will introduce voice and text messaging, as well as voicemail, in any game that supports them. As for clan features, players reportedly will be able to join to create a single entity, motivating players to team up and play cooperatively. Statistics tracking will be updated as well to account for this; stats and records for teams created for online challenges can be carried through subsequent multiplayer bouts. Xbox Live 3.0 may come with \"offsite storage,\" allowing players to store up to 32K of personal data on Xbox Live servers. The big plus here is that players would be able to access this data from any Xbox connected to Xbox Live. In addition, a function that lets users transfer information across four \"family” feature- supporting titles— i.e., developing a player in a college football game and then using the same player/character in three other titles— will be introduced.

INTERNATIONAL FRONT x GMR NEW5 NETWORK neuj games, gameplanner. charts, pre-order, stuff Considering that it was the Japanese who took the notion of a hot rod and turned it into an underground tuning- car culture in Japan, it’s interesting to see things come full circle with a line of real-life specialty-market vinyls based on Electronic Arts’ Need for Speed Underground. We talk to Art Factory Graphics’ Hiroshi Sawada to discuss his company’s sticky new product. GMR: Why did you decide to make Need for Speed Underground- inspired vinyls? HS: The NFSU unique in-game vinyls inspired me to do this. Seeing Japanese-style graphics created from a North American point of view was cool and unique to me. GMR: In America, we have the impression that street racing is big in Japan, but supposedly it’s kind of small. Do you see the genre growing in the future? HS: Yes, because it is getting more popular. Of course, on the streets, it is not that easy. People do not bet money here, but friends gather and the racing begins. Japanese roads are narrow, so I think that is why we have developed strong drifting techniques. GMR: What kind of car do you drive personally? HS: I drive a Honda CRX Del Sol and a Toyota Supra. The Del Sol was not popular in Japan; it was too heavy for a compact car. Japanese people are too obsessed with driving fast (like with the GT-R). But I think if a car is cool enough it could even change your lifestyle— and that is a great thing. A Honda engine sound and a great audio system is cool enough for anyone! A bit of trivia about the car: In Japan the CRX had a unique transtop system. Did you know that? My Supra is a 2 replica, officially. It's the base model, not the turbo version, but it’s still pretty cool with a wide body and 20-inch OZ racing rims. Which are reasonable to buy here in Japan. GMR: If you could add one thing to Need for Speed Underground, what would it be? HS: How about online shopping in the game? You could buy licensed parts like racing heart wheels, etc., and even NFSU- original parts! I think people would really like this. If there are parts that you only could buy online in the game, I think it would be exciting! M? 71 Hiroshi Sawada [the blonde) is a rabid car enthusiast who seemingly has no problem creating ways for young Japanese street-racing fans to violate their vehicles. With Need for Speed Underground taking even EA by surprise with its massive success, we're happy to see its influence reach overseas, too. 32 GMR NEWS NETWORK neuj games, gameplanner charts, pre-order, stuff x FRONT Living in America rocks. We’ve got pizza, Mountain Dew Code Red, and the Super Bowl, but in the relative scheme of things, Japan rocks even harder. This month, we look at pictures of items we don’t own, partly to induce even greater inner sadness, and partly to remind U.S. publishers that we like cool sh*t, too. You know it! Imagine yourself— a child or a teen— growing up in Tokyo, completely immune to all the cool crap that comes out on a seemingly monthly basis there. Why immune? Because it never stops coming. Limited-edition versions of games that offer, at the very least, different cover art, or a soundtrack CD, or a cold-cast figure, or stickers, or a T-shirt, possibly an action figure, a special controller, or, well, you get the idea.

In case you're wondering what we're blabbing about, investigate with your eyes the pictures surrounding this lonely box. One premium item is Nintendo's Famicom- inspired GBA SP, which comes packaged with a buttload of old-school Nintendo classics in GBA form. Holla! Equally interesting is the limited run of laser-etched Sonic the Hedgehog cubes, released last year, as well as the more recent gold Gundam PS2 with customized mount, and the special Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes box set, which includes a platinum GameCube with Foxhound logo, matching controller, a copy of the game, and an emulated version of the original Metal Gear playable on the Cube.

First up is Astro Boy for PS2. Originally a United Game Artists (the team responsible for cult hits Space Channel 5 and Rez] project, Astro Boy was, along with UGA producer Mineko Okamura, brought into the Sonic Team stable once Sega started consolidating its various development resources. UGA was out, Sonic Team was in. uk* mk os* TSM KA* TO 566 WUAT MAK65 UIM TICK 5T0RY py :>AME5 MIELKE Scheduled to be released this summer, Astro Boy's PS2 debut is being timed to coincide with his recent resurgence as a popular figure. While it doesn't take a genius to realize that he's more prominent in his country of origin (Japan) than he is in the United States, both Sega and Sony are banking on his iconic design and broad appeal to bring him to the forefront of today's pop culture. Folks who grew up in the '60s and 70s will recognize him as a symbol of their youth, while a younger audience will be drawn to Astro (also known as Mighty Atom in Japan) for his distinctive design and assortment of exciting robot powers. The barrage doesn’t start with Sega's efforts, though. Sega held back the game's U.S. release to allow the Sony Pictures Kids/WB Kids Saturday-morning TV show to educate its audience in the ways of Astro’s world before unleashing Sonic Team’s piece de resistance on the game-buying public. Strategic savvy aside, Sega also wanted to avoid providing any spoilers, as Astro Boy the game encapsulates the majority of the TV show’s episodic plot. How significant is Astro’s return to prime time? A source no less credible than the Wail Street Journal says that \"Astro Boy is part of a growing taste for Japanese pop culture,” while the New York Daily News says that without Astro Boy, young viewers \"might not have enjoyed such current animated favorites as Pokemon and Dragon BallZ.\" The WB network was so sure it had a huge hit on its hands that it bought up 25 episodes of the show (the usual commitment is 13 episodes), with an eye on an additional 25 if the series is successful. Which brings us neatly back to Astro Boy by Sonic Team. An action game loosely based on the story line of Tezuka’s seminal work, gamers may find similarities, however unintentional, to Konami’s Zone of the Enders, Sony’s Ratchet & Clank, and most intriguingly, Sonic Team’s own NiGHTS Into Dreams. The ZOE comparisons are easy to see. When he’s not running around on the ground talking to civilians and other characters from the Tezuka universe (Tezuka comics employed an ensemble cast of characters that appeared in different books in 35 yOUR FIR5T LOOK AT ASTRO BOy ASTRO BOy different roles), Astro is almost certainly A zooming around the skies of Metro City, | propelled by the rockets in his feet. Like ZOEs Jehuty, Astro can fly around in any direction and dash sideways when necessary, although, it must be said, the show’s pace is kinder and less epilepsy-inducing than Konami’s effort. The Ratchet & Clank similarity extends only to the size of Astro’s futuristic Metro City, with the difference being that you can actually fly anywhere you want here. This city is, for lack of a more creative word, huuuuuge. The buildings in Metro City give new meshing to the word \"skyscraper,” and you can see alj. the way up and down. The game gives >the player such a vast perspective that one would be forgiven for experiencing virtual vertigo. Still, # you can see it, you can go there, meanirfg that not only can you fly up and out to that zeppelin-sized whale ship floating through the sky, yoq can actually land on it and walk around. The NiGHTS Into Dreams parallel corhes from , the absolute feeling of freedom you get from soaring through the uppermost reache/of Metro City (not to mention the ring-clearing/sky-bound time attack contests). At the touch of a button, Astro can rocket into the distance and grab cumulonimbus, or he can carve great sweeping circles into the sky with a flick of th e analog controller. But Astro Boy is not merely the calculated sum of other games distinguished parts. It is very much its own garde— and unlike anything you’ve ever seenr You can thank Osamu Tezuka for that. With a backstory as rich as you'll find in modern-day effort, Astro Boy is a mechanical makeover of Pinocchio. A father figure (in this case, tjie diabolical Dr. Tenma) (creates a boylike construct to take the place of a dead son. But the invention has a heart, and through his travels Astro Boy becomes mdre human, if not in body, then in spirit. Although he gains powers and abilities through his experiences (and after every boss battle), it's not Astro’s finger laser, his rocket boots, his X-ray v/sion, or his supersonic hearing that makes him so accessible— although those certainly don’t hurt. In terms of his arsenal, Astro couldn’t hold a candle to today's Mech Assault - tastic character designs. What makes him so easy to rally behind is his concern for others, his selfless nature— in essence, his humanity. h It is this very vulnerability and earnestness that leads; him toward the other characters in the game for support and guidance, characters like his adopted ; 'father,\" Dr. O'Shay (the director of the Ministry of Science); Epsilon; his sister, Zoran; Rock (also seen in Metropolis}-, arid Big X. One character you’ll meet, who actually had his own comic series, is Hosuke Sharaku, the three-eyed boy. Hosuke will introduce Astro to other characters, each with different mission objectives,, throughout the game. These side quests gradually increase in ^difficulty, requiring players to usye the additional powers that Astro gains in the game’s principal missions. But the characters Astro meets aren’t all necessarily helpful. Take Astro’s first major boss encounter. His foe is not even a character per se— it's Magnamite, Metro” City’s power plant!

IDOL CHATTER interuiecu with sonic team's yuji naka and mheko okamura PS2 With Sonic Heroes recently wrapped, all eyes turn toward Sonic Team s newest project, Astro Boy for PlayStation 2. We recently got together with Sonic Team impresario Yuji Naka and Astro Boy Producer Mineko Okamura over some hot wings and cheap suds to discuss what makes a boy robot tick, and the state of other Sonic Team franchises. They said things in Japanese, we pretended to understand. Here’s what we think they said. GMR: Most of the games Sonic Team because they were both developed to YN: I am not sure if we are the most story is pretty much origina has done have been for GameCube. Why the switch to PlayStation 2 as the platform of choice for Astro Boy! be fun experiences based on quick character actions in the gameptay. We, of course, are flattered to hear this! prolific, it might seem as such because we have so many titles in our development schedule that happen to GMR: Astro Boy began life as a United Game Artists I Space Channel 5, Rez) YN: Simply stated, it was because 1 thought that the Astro Boy universe was suitable to the PlayStation 2 platform and the market it represents. MO: The Sony Pictures group joined Tezuka to publish the Astro Boy TV anime project, so we thought that a co- promotion leveraging our relationship with Sony just made sense. Naturally, PlayStation 2 becomes the most suitable platform for the game 1 GMR: The way in which Astro Boy flies around, dashing to and fro, reminds us of NiGHTS. Are the similarities intentional, or purely coincidental? GMR: If Astro Boy is a success, will Sega continue to make more Astro Boy or Tezuka games? YN: Sega has developed a strong, long-standing relationship with Tezuka Productions, if the game meets our expectations, achieving a high level of success, I think there will be a good possibility that we will continue the franchise. have fallen in the same period. We would like to continue to produce a number of titles that will keep mm r gamers happy and entertained. GMR: Will we ever see a conventional sequel to Phantasy Star Onlinel What do you think of games like Final Fantasy XF! Can you foresee a future where PSO expands into a massively multiplayer online experience? YN: The similarities between the two games are purely coincidental. Astro flying about freely in 3D space is definitely one of the key attractions in this game. Once it was created, 1 certainly felt it had an atmosphere that was somewhat similar to that of NiGHTS. MO: It is totally coincidental. You might find similarities between the two titles GMR: Everyone loves a good puzzle game, and few games of this nature are as original and addictive as ChuChu Rocket. Where’s our sequel? YN: Yes, it is also a game I like very much, so I hope we will update ChuChu Rocket someday in the future! In the near future, you can expect Sonic Team to release another game based on the Puyo franchise in North America. So perhaps the puzzle addicts will be satisfied for this yea YN: MMORPGs like FFXI are also very interesting and have possibilities. However, my feeling is that there also exists a market for fun online RPG franchises such as PSO , where players can enjoy adventures in which they take actions in real time. title. How much has the original game design changed since UGA was 'Tl'H ilK i : r ■ ^ MO: Nothing much has changed since the studios have merged. However, you could say that we are concentrating more on game development. UGA was located in Shibuya, where there are lots of fun things to do, whereas Sonic Team is located at Otorii, near Haneda Airport, where there is only a McDonald’s— you know what I mean? [Smiles] Sonic Team's new environment was good for us. GMR: What is Sonic Team’s design focus with Astro Boy? GMR: Sonic Team seems to be the most prolific of all of Sega's development teams. What can we expect to see in the future from Sonic Team? GMR: How do you feel the gaming landscape has evolved in regard ti gamers’ tastes? As Western developers prove they can compete in the same genres once dominated by their Japanese counterparts, is it getting harder to find success? YN: The gaming industry has obviously evolved in favor of Western development. I believe that Japanese developers should work harder to compete in the changing environment GMR: Is Astro Bo/s story original for PS2, or does it adapt a classic piece of Astro Bo/s manga history? MO: Astro can fly freely with great strength like Superman and he is powerful like Hulk, but he is a child and very small. These gaps are what make him attractive, so we have focused on a boylike, often mischievous flying action. He can fly everywhere in big 3D maps, and he can pull up a lamppost or lift a big car and use those items to beat enemies. We also wanted the character to possess realistic actions that leverage the Havok physics technology. This way, Astro can play catch in his house and have a lot of fun just like a real boy. Please get into Astro Boy and use the Astro character to do everything as you would as a superhero kid! Sonic Team President Yuji Naka, Takashi \" Sonic Heroes\" lizuka, and Mineko Okamura MO: It inherits the concept of an ideal relationship between human and robots from the TV series and manga, but we redesigned the story and some of its scenarios to suit the platform. The latter half of the GMR: Growing up yourself, what sort of influence did Astro Boy have on your own life? MO: When I was a little girl, I read all of Tezuka s mangas, so my heroes were several of his characters. Of course, Astro was already a huge hero in Japan, so I am most excited to reintroduce his character to a new generation of children. I am so happy to be involved in Tezuka ’s world using a new medium— a 3D videogame. 40 m RECEIVE YOUR FREE DAWN OF THE DEAD POSTER Kfl AND SCREENING PASSES IN PARTICIPATING EB Games locations i POSTERS ARE AVAILABLE IN LIMITED QUANTITIES AT PARTICIPATING EB GAMES LOCATIONS.

Far from just having a lousy childhood, he’s actually screwed before he’s born. We all have issues with our parents, but few of us can say that our fathers sold 48 of our body parts to a legion of demons and left us to die as the next step up the evolutionary ladder from a tadpole. That’s the fate of Hyakkimaru, the warrior at the center of both the ’60s-vintage Dororo comic and Blood Will Tell, the stylish American title of i the PS2 game inspired by the comic. I After being born as something \\ almost, but not quite, completely \\ inhuman, Hyakkimaru was rescued I by a wise monk who managed to \\ outfit him with enough prosthetics \\ to function. He grew into a I wandering swordsman— in part 1 because society rejected his | deformity, but also because he I had a chance to get the rest of I his body back. The plot hook \\ driving both the comic and the game is that those 48 demons— one for each of his missing parts— are still out there, as is his father, now Japan's supreme warlord. Each demon Hyakkimaru kills gives him a piece of his anatomy back, and a reckoning with his father may not be far behind. So why isn’t the story called Hyakkimarul Well, any good hero needs a sidekick, and that's where the comic's title comes from. Dororo is a young pickpocket and a vagabond like Hyakkimaru, and she wanders along with the hero both in the story and the game. The warrior may be at the center of the action, but the kid provides the personality that Hyakkimaru might be a tittle short on (along with limbs, organs, and all the rest). Dororo was one of the later works of Tezuka’s heyday; Hyakkimaru debuted in the pages of Shonen Sunday in 1 967, a good 1 5 years after Astro Boy became a star. By modern standards, though, Dororo s style is just a little bit too cartoony for a serious supernatural action game, so a key step in Sega’s development of the game was finding a more modern style of design for both Hyakkimaru and the demons he fights. That style came from contemporary manga star Hiroaki Samura, famous in Japan and the United States for his violent, rough-edged samurai story Blade of the Immortal. The game is based on Tezuka’s source material— namely his story and character concepts— but Samura ’s artwork inspires the visual style, which trades the smooth, simple, Disney-esque lines of the original story for more realistic details and a harder edge. Samura ’s designs also draw on imagery from Japanese history and folklore, so the bad guys are echoes of mythological beasts such as the kappa, the tengu, and even lesser- known monsters. Blood Will Tell impressed players with its - V By Dave Smith 44 VOUR FIRST LOOK AT dlood will tell BLOOD WILL TELL DORORQ style right out of the gate, but that style was almost all it had when it debuted at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show. The demo version was visually together— Hyakkimaru's attack animations were impressive, blending flowing combinations with Shinobi- style tate scenes, and even the first level effectively mixed indoor and outdoor environments while keeping the camera direction together. But all the stylish violence and smooth water effects couldn’t hide the fact that it was a little low on gameplay depth to set it apart from a field full of hack-n-slash action games. That, Sega promises, was only a temporary condition. The finished version will draw its depth from the basis of the story— Hyakkimaru's search to get his body back. When the game begins, Hyakkimaru doesn’t have much more than his swords, a pair of blades sheathed inside his wooden prosthetic arms. As he fights through the demons and gets his bits back, he earns new weapons and abilities from both more advanced prosthetics and reacquired organs. Extras for his inorganic arsenal include explosives, a sheathed arm cannon, and a long-range sickle and chain, while new organs have a subtler effect. Getting his stomach back, for instance, improves his health regeneration. Although Blood Will Tell is an action game at heart, mixing up the slashfest with the weirdest possible twist on Metroid might be what it takes to pull it ahead of a crowded pack. Shinobi and Nightshade have their retro cool, Samurai Warriors has Koei’s stamp of historical inspiration, and Bujingai has enough flash for half a dozen games, but depth and progression are some qualities we’ve been missing from the past year's round of 3D action entries. And if this is a success, who knows what Tezuka classics we might see in the next couple of years? His 40 years of classic comics include some concepts even stranger than that in Blood Will Tell. I« The basic version of Hyakkimaru's arm. shown in the prerendered Blood Will Tell trailer (above), contains a sharp katana blade sheathed below the elbow. Later gameplay trailers show off some handy upgraded versions, though— for instance, he can toss one of the blade-equipped arms in favor of an explosive machine-gun arm. Exactly how Hyakkimaru gets hold of a bionic automatic weapon in Muromachi-era Japan is a question the development team has yet to answer, however. ^r» mmb JEST'S - mm ■ 0NMMI 45 VOUR FIRST LOOK AT astro boy : omega factor iTilME! 1 OMEGA FACTOR THE RSTRO RND THE OfTIEGR FRETOR i hrow high concept and pretense out b window.

True that. Every geeky 2D effect you could imagine is here, along with an innovative weapons system, stunning graphics, great music, razor-sharp controls, a cool character-collection system (which unlocks famous Tezuka creations in an encyclopedic character- dictionary mode), and the great nonstop action and furious boss battles Treasure is known for. That’s right, the very same Treasure responsible for classic action titles such as Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, and Silhouette Mirage, as well as recent hits such as Ikaruga and the upcoming Gradius V. But Treasure didn’t work alone— Omega Factor was produced and codeveloped by Hitmaker (the development wing of Sega known for its Crazy Taxi, Virtual-On, and Virtua Tennis games). Together, they are responsible for Astro Boy: Omega Factor, and to find out what makes this game tick, we talked with Tez Okano, director at Hitmaker. GMR: How was it creating a brand- new game based on a classic Tezuka license? Tez Okano: To the Japanese otaku (maniacs), it is truly a dreamlike opportunity. The agreement between Sega and Tezuka Productions is extremely special because it allows us to create stories using all the characters in Tezuka’s works, not just Astro Boy. The comparative sentiment in America would be something like a license to develop stories based on all heroes from the Marvel and DC comics worlds combined. You can see then why we are so excited. GMR: What was your working relationship with Treasure on this title like? What was Hitmaker responsible for, and what was Treasure’s role? The overall directions, like rough specs, stage structures, and story, were done by me. While we wanted to entrust the staff at Treasure with everything, our development schedule was tight, so we outlined the story on the Hitmaker side. Treasure responded well to this unorthodox approach, creating the refreshing and fascinating aspects of the actions that are the core of the game. § In other words) you ■ 1 1 be able -to unlock your -true potential and power up.
