        "text": "In this paper, we implement a combination of technical analysis and machine/deep learning-based analysis to build a trend classification model. The goal of the paper is to apprehend short-term market movement, and incorporate it to improve the underlying stochastic model. Also, the analysis presented in this paper can be implemented in a model-independent fashion. We execute a data-science-driven technique that makes shortterm forecasts dependent on the price trends of current stock market data. Based on the analysis, three different labels are generated for a data set: +1 (buy signal), 0 (hold signal), or −1 (sell signal). We propose a detailed analysis of four major stocksAmazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. We implement various technical indicators to label the data set according to the trend and train various models for trend estimation. Statistical analysis of the outputs and classification results are obtained.\n\nWe have applied a Long Short-Term Memory neural network to model S&P 500 volatility, incorporating Google domestic trends as indicators of the public mood and macroeconomic factors. In a held-out test set, our Long Short-Term Memory model gives a mean absolute percentage error of 24.2%, outperforming linear Ridge/Lasso and autoregressive GARCH benchmarks by at least 31%. This evaluation is based on an optimal observation and normalization scheme which maximizes the mutual information between domestic trends and daily volatility in the training set. Our preliminary investigation shows strong promise for better predicting stock behavior via deep learning and neural network models.\n\nAbstract: Most data sources used in economics, whether from the government or businesses, are typically available only after a substantial lag, at a high level of aggregation, and for variables that were specified and collected in advance. This hampers the effectiveness of real-time predictions. We demonstrate how data from search engines like Google provide a highly accurate but simple way to predict future business activities.\n\nThis study aims to determine the effect of the financial ratio and Google search volume (GSV) on stock returns of LQ-45 companies listed on the IDX for the 2015-2020 period. The study used purposive sampling and applied multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed that the Current Ratio (CR) and Return on Assets (ROA) insignificantly affect stock returns. Meanwhile, the Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER) hurts stock returns significantly. This finding implies that signals from search data volume can help build profitable trading strategies.\n\nThe level of daily stock returns is generally regarded as unpredictable. Instead of the level, we focus on the signs of these returns and generate forecasts using various statistical classification techniques, such as logistic regression, generalized additive models, or neural networks. The analysis is carried out using a data set consisting of all stocks that were part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1996. After selecting the relevant explanatory variables in the subsample from 1996 to 2003, forecast evaluations are conducted in an out-of-sample environment for the period from 2004 to 2017. Since the model selection and the forecasting period are strictly separated, the procedure mimics the situation a forecaster would face in real time. It is found that the sign of daily returns is predictable to an extent that is statistically significant. Moreover, trading strategies based on these forecasts generate positive alpha, even after accounting for transaction costs. This underl...\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the different influence of search engine data in different market periods on the improvement of the prediction of the financial time series volatility. We use the EGARCH and the EGARCH-SVI model. We analyze weekly data from the Dow Jones, FTSE 100 and Nikkei 225 market indices and the weekly search volume index (SVI) from google trends for market indices keywords. The main contribution of this paper is introducing limitations of the EGARCH-SVI model for forecasting the weekly volatility of the market index. Our results show that i) search engine dataÂ improve financial time series volatility predictions of the EGARCH-SVI model in market crisis periods with the bigger price volatility; and ii) search engine data is not improving the prediction of the financial time series volatility of the EGARCH-SVI model in a non-crisis periods with low price volatility in the market. This result also confirms the predictive power of the EGARCH-SVI model in crisis peri..."
