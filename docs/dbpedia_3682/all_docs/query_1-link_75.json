        "text": "<p> This question requires knowledge of ancient philosophies, especially regarding the concept of Monism, a view asserting that the universe originated from a single substance. Here, we discuss Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. He believed the primeval substance of the universe to be fire, and change to be the only reality, dictating how the world interacts and transitions. The concept has been associated with infamous slogans like \"Everybody with their logos are witnesses to me\", \"War is father of all\", etc.</p>"
