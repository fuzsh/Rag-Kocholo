        "text": "Timothy Olyphant is back as U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens in Justified: City Primeval on FX, joined by an all-new cast. This adventure takes Raylan on an unexpected road trip far from Miami and the Kentucky hollers we came to know so well in the original Justified series.\n\nStill, when he accepts a professional invitation to ‚Äúhang around and see how we do things in Detroit,‚Äù the last thing he expects is to find himself chasing down an unhinged violent criminal with an uncanny knack for evading local law enforcement.\n\nFrom the two-episode premiere on July 18 (yep, we caught that Yellowstone reference in episode 1 too) to the August 29th finale that had us glued to our seats (woah, that ending was a huge surprise), this limited series based on Elmore Leonard's novel has had fans (us included) hooked. So, where can you watch it and how many episodes are there? We‚Äôve got you covered in the Justified: City Primeval episode guide below.\n\nHow many episodes of Justified: City Primeval are there?\n\nThere are eight episodes in FX's limited series Justified: City Primeval. That's a bit shy of 13 episodes per season in the original series. But, hey, we've been waiting eight years for this reboot, so we'll take it. Or, as one fan commented on Instagram, \"I AM SO EXCITED! I need more Timothy Olyphant in my life!! OMG OMG OMG üòç.\"\n\nWhere to watch and stream the next episode of Justified: City Primeval\n\nFollowing the finale's live airing on FX on August 29, all eight episodes of Justified: City Primeval are now available to stream on . (If you subscribe to a live-streaming app-based TV service that includes FX, you can watch episodes on demand.)\n\nEpisode 1: \"City Primeval\" ‚Äî Fifteen years after Raylan Givens left the hollers of Kentucky, a chance encounter in the Florida swamps sends him to Detroit and places him on a collision course with a violent sociopath and a formidable defense attorney. Written by Dave Andron and Michael Dinner. Directed by Michael Dinner.\n\nEpisode 2: \"The Oklahoma Wildman\" ‚Äî Raylan hunts a killer. Carolyn takes on a former client. Willa makes a new friend. Written by Dave Andron and Michael Dinner. Directed by Michael Dinner.\n\nEpisode 3:\"Backstabbers\" ‚Äî Raylan and the Detroit Police round up some promising suspects, provoking Carolyn‚Äôs ire. Mansell and Sandy move on the Albanian mark. Things with Willa reach a breaking point. Written by Eisa Davis and Chris Provenzano. Directed by Jon Avnet.\n\nEpisode 4: \"Kokomo\" ‚Äî Raylan tangles with the Albanian mob. Mansell forms a new alliance. Carolyn lets her guard down. Written by Taylor Elmore. Directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton.\n\nEpisode 5: \"You Good?\" ‚Äî Carolyn‚Äôs past becomes Raylan‚Äôs present. Mansell puts a plan into action. Written by Eisa Davis and Chris Provenzano. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan.\n\nEpisode 6: \"Adios\" ‚Äî A botched kerfuffle sends Raylan‚Äôs pursuit of Mansell into chaos. Written by Taylor Elmore and V.J. Boyd. Directed by Sylvain White.\n\nEpisode 7: \"The Smoking Gun\" ‚Äî Raylan and Mansell show down. Written by Dave Andron and Michael Dinner. Directed by Katrelle Kindred.\n\nEpisode 8: \"The Question\" ‚Äî Raylan and Carolyn cross the line, as Raylan attempts to make it out of Detroit alive. Written by Dave Andron and Michael Dinner. Directed by Michael Dinner.\n\n.."
