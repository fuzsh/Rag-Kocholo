The following sorts of frequencies are included :\n\nâ¢ Brainwave Frequencies - These are frequencies associated with various mental states. Using brainwave entrainment, you can coax your brainwaves to a certain frequency, and in doing so, achieve the mental state associated with that frequency.\n\nâ¢ \"Healing\" Frequencies - These are frequencies that various parties claim could be used to heal illnesses of different kinds, or stimulate some region of the body (chakras). The medium used to do this varies - some of these parties used devices that generated EM fields which were applied to a precise part of the body, while others used vibration and sound. (I don't have any experience with using EM fields - most of my personal toying about with this stuff uses a sound medium.)\n\nâ¢ Natural Phenomena Frequencies - This includes natural frequencies that occur in nature [Schumann's Resonance, for instance], as well as sound tones calculated from the revolution/orbit of the various planets. The sources of these frequencies claimed that they could affect humans in a variety of ways.\n\nThe original page that I began building this compiled information from is\n\nmembers.aol.com/networktcp...ch/freq.htm\n\nThe information in green is from this original page. The information I've added is in violet. My personal comments are in light blue. Hyperlinked words have glossary definitions that you can access by clicking on them. To find the original source for any of this information [or where I got it, at least], check the letters in brackets at the end of the entry and refer to the bibliography. This is also where I'll give any indications about what medium the source for the information used (sound, light, EM fields, or vibrations). By default, assume it to be sound.\n\nIf you want to redistribute this, please include the Bibliography page as well -- the original sources deserve their reference. Also, please leave my introduction at the top as it is, along with my name, email, and URL.\n\nDisclaimer : I wouldn't take everything you read on this list for granted. Some of it is verifiable by science -- and, there's probably a lot of new-agey crap as well. Although the mere fact some of it sounds new-agey in itself doesn't mean there isn't some truth to it. (The powers that be might have just been too imaginative naming it.)\n\nDisclaimer #2 : Anything you do with the frequencies below is your personal risk - if you manage to burn out a couple of brain cells or harm yourself in some other way, I do not take any responsibility nor will I be held liable. (Just protecting my butt here.)\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Triggs\n\nlunarsight@verizon.net\n\nwww.lunarsight.com\n\nCYCLES PER SECOND (HERTZ), and Correspondences to MENTAL STATES, PHYSIOLOGY, COLORS, NOTES & PLANETS\n\nThese frequencies are of all types; light, sound, electrical, etc. The two- or three-character source codes after each frequency are defined in the bibliography.\n\n0.1-1 Organ/muscle resonances [SS]\n\n0.1-3 Delta range, according to [NEU+CRI] - deep sleep, lucid dreaming, increased immune functions, hypnosis [NEU]; Decreased awareness of the physical world. Access to unconscious information. Dominant brainwave in infants under one year old.

Deep dreamless sleep, trance, suspended animation [SS]; Anti-aging. Reduces amount of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress & aging. Increases the levels of DHEA (anti-aging) & melantonin (decreases aging process.) [BAR]; Associated with unconscious mind & sleep state - in conjunction with other frequencies in a waking state, \"Delta acts as a form of radar â seeking out information â reaching out to understand on the deepest unconscious level things that we can't understand through thought process.\" Provides intuition, empathetic attunement & instinctual insight. [AWI]; Conducive to miracle type healing, divine knowledge, inner being & personal growth, rebirth, trauma recovery, \"one with the universe\" experiences (samadhi), near death experience, characterized by \"unknowing\", merely a blissful \"being\" state such as deep sleep or coma. [PWM via DW]\n\nâ¢ The anti-aging info comes from a Brainwave Generator preset authored by TheMind2 - he uses binaurals at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 & 4.0 HZ. They all play simultaneously.\n\n0.9 Euphoria [SS]\n\n0.95 - 10 - Whiplash [AT]\n\n1-3 - Delta: deep, dreamless sleep, trance state, non-REM sleep [??]; profound relaxation, restorative sleep, feelings of tranquility&peace, if one can remain aware [VUG via DW]\n\nâ¢ There's disagreement over where the delta range begins & ends - [SS,PWM+AWI] list it as 0.5 to 4.0 HZ, [NEU] 0.1 to 3.0 HZ, & [RA] considers it 0.5 to 3.0 HZ.\n\n1.0 - Feeling of well-being, pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone; overall view of inter-relationships; harmony & balance [MB]\n\n1.05 Helps hair grow + get its color back [RA]; pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone (helps develop muscle, recover from injuries, rejuvenation effects) [HSW]\n\n1.2 - (used on) headaches [RS]\n\n1.45 - Tri-thalamic entrainment format. According to Ronald deStrulle, creates entrainment between hypothalamus, pituitary & pineal. May benefit dyslexics + people with Alzheimer's. [MP2]\n\n1.5 Abrahams Universal Healing Rate [SS]; Sleep [NEU]; Those individuals whose ailments have manifested into the fourth stage of Chronic Fatigue, where some form of disease is apparent, experienced a release from the negative sensation of their symptoms when moved into 1.5HZ. [NYT via NEU]\n\n1.8 Sinus Congestion seems to clear centering around 1.8 HZ [MPT] (tested with binaural beats, primarily)\n\n2.0 Nerve regeneration [NOR]\n\n2.06 Associated with coccyx (small triangular bone at end of the spinal column) [TOS]\n\n2.15 - 10 - Tendovaginatis [AT]\n\n2.30 Associated with genitals [TOS]\n\n2.5 - pain relief, relaxation [MB]; production of endogenous opiates. [EQ]; Use for sedative effect [ESP]; Sedative effect - reported use on bleeding, bruises, insomnia, and sinusitis. [RS] Sexual stimulation? [SX]\n\n2.57 Associated with bladder [TOS]\n\n2.67 Associated with intestines [TOS]\n\n3.0-5.5 - \"Theta1\" Range. [DW]\n\nâ¢ [DW] divides the Theta Range into Theta1 & Theta2.\n\n3.0 Increased Reaction Time [RT] [SS]; 3.0 HZ & below used to reduce muscle tension headaches, but worked less well on migraines & sinus headaches. ; used to treat allergies, in conjunction with 330 HZ [RS]\n\n3.07 Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) [TOS]\n\n3 - 4 Influences physical vision [SS]\n\n3 - 6 Childhood awareness/vivid memories [SS+RA]\n\n3 - 8 Theta Range according to [NEU]; deep relaxation, meditation, increased memory, focus, creativity, lucid dreaming, hypnagogic state [NEU]\n\n3.4 - Sound sleep\n\n3.5 - Feeling of unity with everything, accelerated language retention [Ã]; enhancement of receptivity [MB]; Earth Resonance (?) [SS]; (a remedy for) depression & anxiety [ESR]; Wholebeing regeneration, DNA stimulation [EI-d]\n\nâ¢ [MPT] I was under the impression the Earth Resonance is 7.83 HZ - unless [SS] is talking about a different earth resonance.\n\n3.5-7.5 - Theta Range [per CRI] - Creativity, intuition, daydreaming, fantasizing, recollection, imagery, dreamlike, switching thoughts, drowsiness; \"oneness\", \"knowing\", repository for memories, emotions, sensations. Can lead to trance-like states. Theta strong during internal focus, meditation, prayer + spiritual awareness. Reflects state between wakefulness+ sleep. Relates to subconscious. Observed in anxiety, behavioral activation+behavioral inhibition. Promotes learning+memory when functioning normally. (I think they mean it helps you process what you've learned - if you tried to actively learn while in the theta state, I doubt you'd have success - but sometimes the theta state can give your subconscious a chance to chew the proverbial fat that you've learned during the day, and digest it.) Abnormal in awake adults, but seen in children up to 13 years old. Suppression of theta can help concentration/focus of attention. [CRI]\n\n3.6 (a remedy for) anger & irritability [ESR]\n\n3.84 Associated with ovaries (Effects=vitality, life at every level) [TOS]\n\n3.9 (a remedy for) unsociable behavior [ESR]; Theta/Delta brainwave range - crystal clear meditation, lucid dreams, enhanced inner awareness, \"facilitates easy access to inner resources & creates space for inner peace + self-renewal\".

[PWB]; bursts of inspiration, twilight sleep learning, deep relaxation, reverie, high levels of awareness, vivid mental imagery. Hypnopompic & Hypnagogic states [NSS via DW]; Military remote viewers operate in this range [RVX]\n\nâ¢ Some disagreement over the theta range - [NEU] lists it as 3.0 to 8.0 HZ. [AWI] lists it as 4.0 to 8.0 HZ. [RA] & [PWB] both have it as 4.0 to 7.0. [DW] divides it into two ranges, Theta1 (3.0-5.5 hz) & Theta2 (5.5-8.0 hz).\n\n4.0 - 8.0 HZ Theta State according to [AWI]+[VUG via DW] - present in dreaming sleep, deep meditation, storehouse of creative inspiration, spiritual connection, subconscious mind [AWI]; creative insight, twilight (\"sleep\") learning, vivid mental imagery. Found in advanced meditators [VUG via DW]\n\n4-12 Skeletal muscle resonances [SS]\n\n4.0 - Enkephalins, Extrasensory perception [MB]; Astral Projection, Telepathy, \"Seduction mindset\" [EI-d]; Catecholamines, vital for memory & learning, respond at around 4 HZ. [PSI]; Subconscious Problem Solving/Full Memory Scanning (if one can manage to stay awake) [RA+CAV via DW]; Associated with object naming, an important aspect of memory [TDM via DW]; \"Those who suffer from Chronic Fatigue exhaust very easily.

Consists of trains (long runs) of rhythmic frontal activity centering at 6.5-Hz with amplitudes reaching the 50-100 uV (micro-volt) range. .. Is induced in some people by the performance of a mental task such as mental arithmetic, tracing a maze, counting the number of cubes piled in a three-dimensional representation, & imaging a scene. .. More common in extroverts with low traits of neurosis & anxiety. Because Theta2 is associated with mental tasks & its influence is seen in evoked potential latencies, Mizuki (1987) believes that the appearance of Theta2 closely relates to mechanisms of attention or arousal.

Some paint Alpha as a range of relaxed attentiveness, ideal for learning. Others associate it with \"daydreaming\" [which doesn't sound like it would be good for learning]. Unless they're not talking the \"attentive\" sort of learning [i.e. sitting in a classroom taking notes], but rather the \"trying to assemble it all together in our heads\" sort of learning, where our subconscious is doing most of the work in the background, and our conscious mind takes a backseat. I see the Alpha range as the fine line between daydreaming and alertness. It's like a baseball player on a base - he'll move away from the base, so that he can steal if the opportunity presents itself. But he always stays close enough to the base so he can get back in case the pitcher throws the ball to the baseman. Alpha Range is the same way - it's close enough to the \"attentive\" mental state for us to go to it as needed. But we can also quickly retreat into the realm of sleep if need be.

It leads to a state where being has no name, to a state where the all-one and the all encompassing are no longer separate entities but are reunited at their one common origin, the origin that is also you.\"\n\n132.0 Associated with kidneys (Effects=strength) (higher octave of 4.11 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with coccyx (small triangular bone at end of the spinal column) (higher octave of 2.06 HZ) [TOS]\n\n136.1 Sun: light, warmth, joy, animus [RV]; Resonates with the earth year (Note=C#) (Color=Turqouise Green) (Effects=calming, meditative, relaxing, centering) [PSI]; Period it takes earth to revolve around sun (Tempo=63.8*127.6) (Chakra=Anahate/Heart chakra)(Effects=relaxing, soothing, balancing, harmony with the cosmos, associated with the soul {\"frequency of the soul}) (Medicinal=Sedative) (Other=significant tone in Indian music {called it the \"sadja\" or \"father to others\" - it was a keynote} - corresponds to \"OM\" & the Christian \"AMEN\") [HC/Planetware website]\n\nâ¢ Note : [PSI] seems to disagree a bit with the original source on the list. [PSI] says this one calms/centers, while the original source seems to associate it with happiness. Also some disagreement between [RV] and [HC/Planetware], once associating this with the sun, and the other associating this with the frequency with the earth year. I suppose you could associate the earth year with the sun, since it's the time it takes the earth to go around the sun, but 126.22 HZ uses \"frequency of the sun\" in a little different context. See the comments with that frequency for more.\n\n140.25 Pluto: power, crisis & changes [??]; Frequency associated with the orbit of Pluto; (Note=C#) (Color=blue-green) (Tempo=65.7 * 131.4 BPM) (Effects = support the magic group dynamic principle and is said to be responsible for integration into certain structures of society) [HC/Planetware website]\n\n141.27 Mercury: intellectuality, mobility [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Mercury (Note=C# or D) (Color=blue-green or blue) (Tempo=66.2) (Chakra=Vishudda/Throat chakra) (Effects=Supports speech center and communicative-intellectual principle, associated with communication and cleverness) [HC/Planetware]\n\nâ¢ [HC/Planetware] says the frequencies of planets revolving around the sun are less important than those of the moon, sun, and Earth.\n\nâ¢ Again, I'm not sure how [HC/planetware] is associating these frequencies with these chakras. {shrugs}\n\nâ¢ A discrepancy in the note and color - they're both given twice - once as C# and blue-green, the second time as D and blue.\n\nâ¢ [HC/Planetware] and [BH] seem to associate different frequencies with the revolutions of each planet - these frequencies are determined by HC/Planetware by taking higher octaves of the actual period - octaves that are in the audible range. [BH] might use even higher octaves than [HC/Planetware] does, or some other method completely.\n\n144.0 (helps with) headaches (Medium=pad)[JB]\n\n144.72 Mars: activity, energy, freedom, humor [??] ; Frequency associated with the orbit of Mars (Note=D) (Color=blue) (Tempo=67.8 * 135.6 BPM) (Effect : Supports strength of will and focused energy, ability for achievement) [HC/Planetware]\n\n146.0 (used on) sinus infection/head cold [RS]\n\n147.0 Associated with the spleen/blood (Effects=Emotional Impulse) (higher octave of 4.6 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with genitals (higher octave of 2.30 HZ) [TOS]\n\n147.85 Saturn: separation, sorrow, death [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Saturn (Note=D) (Color=Blue) (Tempo=69.3 * 138.6 BPM) (Effects=enhances concentration and the process of becoming conscious + shows very clearly karmic connections, brings structure and order - is considered to be a cosmic controller) [HC/Planetware]\n\nâ¢ I'm not completely sure what the dual tempo means. I'll have to research that further.\n\n160.0 Appears to be involved in stimulating 5-hydroxytryptamine production, with 80 Hz. [EQ]; Use for rapid relief from headaches [ESR]; used on sinus infection/head cold [RS]\n\n164.3 Frequency associated with Gall Bladder [Note=E] [BH1][BH4]\n\n165.0 Associated with stomach (Effects=Emotional Acceptance) (higher octave of 5.14 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with bladder (higher octave of 2.57 HZ) [TOS];\n\n165.0-170.0 Spiritual fall/consciousness collapse [JM]\n\nâ¢ [JM] said to avoid between 165.0 HZ to 170 HZ, \"although the repercussions extend for a ways on either side of that.\" He's not completely clear why he feels this particular range should be avoided. (He had said he'd go into more detail when Awakening Mind II is released.)\n\n171.0 Associated with lungs (Effects=Oxygen, Heat) (higher octave of 5.35 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with intestines (higher octave of 2.67 HZ) [TOS]\n\n172.06 - Resonates with the Platonic year {about 26,000 years} (Note=F) (Color=purple-violet) (Effects=joyful, cheerful, spiritual effect) [PSI]; The Frequency Of The Platonic Year (Color=red-violet {purple}) (Tempo=80.6 BPM) (Chakra=Sahasrar/Crown chakra) (Effects=cheerfulness, clarity of spirit, cosmic unity on highest levels) (Medicinal=antidepressive) (Other=F is considered the tone of the spirit, and had a lot of significance to the Chinese) [HC/Planetware website]\n\nâ¢ Other sources [PM] disagree about the tone F being associated with the Crown chakra, which is how HC/Planetware connects this frequency to the crown chakra. [PM] considers the crown chakra to be associated with the B note, and not F.\n\n176.0 - Frequency associated with the colon. [Note=F or F#] [BH1][BH4]\n\n183.58 - Jupiter: growth, success, justice, spirituality [??] ; Frequency associated with the orbit of Jupiter (Note=F#) (Color=Red) (Tempo=86.05 * 172.1 BPM) (Effects : supports creative power and continuous construction) (Associated with Jupiter : Generosity, Continuity, Magnanimity, Joviality) [HC/planetware website]\n\n185.0 - (used on) sinus infection/head cold [RS]\n\n187.61 frequency of \"moon culmination\" ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n194.18 frequency of Synodic \"Earth\" Day {the \"day tone\"} (Note=G) (Color=Orange Red) (Tempo=91.0 BPM) (Chakra=Muladhar/Base chakra) (Effects = dynamic, vitalizing)(Medicinal=\"tonifies\") (Other=\"weather determining\" spheric frequency, influences proteins, brings one into harmony with nature\") [HC/planetware website]\n\nâ¢ Note : By \"weather determining\", [HC/planetware] seems to imply that somebody tuned into this frequency may be able to predict the weather in the short-term future. I'm just a little, little bit skeptical of this one, but if anybody has any luck with it, let me know.\n\nâ¢ I'm not sure how [HC/planetware] is associating these chakras to these frequencies. It doesn't seem to be based on the note, since G isn't the note typically associated with the base chakra [per PM]. The associations might tie in with something astrological instead. {shrugs}.\n\n194.71 - Earth: stability, grounding [??]; Key Of G resonates with frequency of earth day, the color orange-red, & has a dynamic, stimulating, and energizing effect on the body-mind. [PSI]\n\nâ¢ There seems to be some disagreement between [PSI] and the original source for this list. [PSI] associates this frequency with energizing, while the original source associates it with stability/grounding.\n\nâ¢ I think this one, and the one right below it [197.71 HZ] might be based on the same thing. One source might have done a typo, and then other sources based their information from that.\n\n197.0 Associated with heart (Effects=love,warmth) (higher octave of 6.15) [TOS]; Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) (higher octave of 3.07 HZ) [TOS]\n\n197.71 frequency of Sideric Day ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n207.36 - Uranus: spontaneity, independence, originality [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Uranus {insert one of dozens of bad jokes here} (Note=G#) (Color=Orange) (Tempo = 97.2 BMP) (Effects = supports the power of surprise and renewal, has primeval and erotic power) [HC/planetware website]\n\n210.42 frequency of Synodic Moon (Note=G#) (Color=orange) (Tempo=98.6 BPM) (Chakra=Svadisthan {2nd Chakra}) (Effects=stimulates sexual energy, supports erotic communication) (Medicinal=regulation of menstruation, disturbances in the gland and lymph system) [HC/planetware website]\n\n211.44 - Neptune: the unconscious, secrets, imagination, spiritual love [??]; frequency associated with orbit of Neptune (Note=G#) (Color=orange) (Tempo=99.1 BPM) (Effects = supports intuition, the unconsciousness, and enhances the dream experience) [HC/planetware website]\n\n220.0 Frequency associated with lungs. [Note = A] [BH1][BH4] Associated with collarbones (Effects=vitality, overall balance, stability) (higher octave of 6.88 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with ovaries (Effects=vitality, life at very level) (higher octave of 3.84 HZ) [TOS]\n\n221.23 - Venus: beauty, love, sexuality, sensuality, harmony [??]; Frequency associated with the orbit of Venus (Note=A) (Color=yellow-orange) (Tempo=103.7 BPM) (Chakra=Ajna/Third Eye) (Effects=supports higher love energy and aspiration for harmony) [HC/planetware website]\n\n227.43 frequency of Sideric Moon ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n229.22 frequency of Metonic Cycle [related to moon] ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n234.16 frequency of Moon knot ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n241.56 frequency of Saros periode ; [related to moon] ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n246.04 frequency of Apsidis rotation ; [related to moon] ; [HC/planetware website]\n\n250.0 Elevate and revitalize\n\n254.57 Frequency associated with orbit of Icarus (asteroid) [MPT]\n\n256.0 Root Chakra (1:1) (Note=C) [BH3] [MWH]\n\n263.0 Associated with mouth (Effects=speech, creativity) (higher octave of 8.22 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with kidneys (Effects=strength) (higher octave of 4.11 HZ) [TOS]\n\n264.0 Related to Personality somehow. (Note=C+) [BH4]\n\n272.0 33rd octave of Earth year [HC]; Frequency associated with Selenium (mineral nutrient) (Note=C#) [BH]\n\n272.2 Frequency associated with orbit of Earth (Note=C#) [BH2]\n\n273.0 Transpersonal Chakra (1:15) [Note=C#] (Earth Orbit 272) [BH3]\n\n280.5 Frequency associated with orbit of Pluto [Note=C#] [BH2]\n\n281.0 - Frequency associated with Intestines [Note=C#] [BH1]\n\n281.6 - Frequency associated with Small Intestine [Note=C#] [BH4]\n\n282.4 - Frequency associated with orbit of Mercury.

[Note=D] [BH2]\n\n293.0 - \"unknown\" Chakra (1:14) (Note=D+) (Saturn Orbit 296) [BH3]\n\nâ¢ I take it by D+, she means a note somewhere between D and D#. A quarter note, perhaps. [MPT]\n\n294.0 - Associated with the upper lip (Effects=emotions, conflict resolution) (higher octave of 9.19 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with the spleen/blood (Effects=Emotional Impulse) (higher octave of 4.6 HZ) [TOS]\n\n295.7 - Frequency associated with orbit of Saturn (Note=D#) [BH2]\n\n295.8 - Frequency associated with Fat Cells (Note=C#) [BH1][BH4]\n\n296.07 - Frequency associated with orbit of Toutatis (asteroid) [MPT]\n\n304.0 - Useful on headaches (medium=pad); sedation and pain relief (medium=tube) [JB+KFL] ; (useful for) blood pressure, (and with) stiff muscles (KFL); Frequency associated with Potassium (mineral nutrient) (Note=D#) [BH]\n\n310.7 - Frequency associated with spin of Neptune (Note=Eb) [BH2]\n\n315.0 - Diaphragm Chakra (10:1) (Note=Eb) [BH3]\n\n315.8 - Frequency associated with Brain (Note=Eb) [BH1]\n\n317.83 - Frequency associated with Liver (Note=Eb) [BH1][BH4]\n\n319.88 - Frequency associated with Kidney (Note=Eb) [BH1][BH4]\n\n320.0 - Solar Plexus Chakra (10:1) (Note=Eb) [BH3] [MWH]; Frequency associated with Calcium (mineral nutrient) (Note=E or Eb) [BH]\n\n321.9 - Frequency associated with blood. (Note=E or Eb) [BH1][BH4]\n\n324.0 - Frequency associated with muscles. (Note=E) [BH1][BH4]\n\n329.0 Associated With Nasal Passages (Effects=breathing, taste) (higher octave of 10.3 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with stomach (Effects=Emotional Acceptance) (higher octave of 5.14 HZ) [TOS]\n\n330.0 Used to treat allergies in conjunction with 3 HZ [RS]\n\n333.0 (used on) sinus infection/head cold [RS]\n\n332.8 - Frequency associated with orbit of Sun (Note=E) [BH2]\n\nâ¢ When [BH2] says the \"orbit of the sun\", I believe she means how long it would take an imaginary planet to orbit around the sun's outer boundary [circumfrence]. This is how [HC/planetware] made this calculation - the period is then lowered a few octaves to get it into the audible sound range. That's how [HC/planetware] does most of its calculations, and probably how [BH] does it as well. [HC/planetware], when lowering [or in the case of planets raising] the octave, seems to gun for lower tones than [BH] does. The [HC/planetware] tones would be a little \"bassier\". Which is probably why the frequencies of all these astronomical phenomena that [HC/planetware] gives doesn't line up with the frequencies that [BH] gives.\n\n336.0 - Frequency associated with Molybdenum (mineral nutrient) [BH]\n\n341.0 - Heart Chakra (1:12) (Note=F) [BH3] [MWH]\n\nâ¢ [MWH] had the Heart Chakra at 341.3, if you want to nitpick.\n\n342.0 - Associated with ears (Effects=hearing, formal concepts) (higher octave of 13.8 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with lungs (Effects=Oxygen, Heat) (higher octave of 5.35 HZ) [TOS]\n\n352.0 - Frequency associated with bladder. (Note=F) [BH1][BH4]; Thymus Chakra (11:1) (Note=F#) [BH3]\n\nâ¢ There seems to be a discrepancy here as to which note this frequency is. [BH] cites both F and F#.

One could justifiably call it Ab. It's probably closer to Ab than it is to A.\n\n430.8 - Frequency associated with spin of Uranus (Note=Ab) [BH2]\n\n**438 - Indigo [PL?] (!!!) - See Glossary entry \"COLOR\"\n\n439.0 - Crown Chakra (Note=A?
