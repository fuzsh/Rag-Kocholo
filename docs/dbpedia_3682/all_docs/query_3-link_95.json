        "text": "So, I’ve been working on this game for about 4 years. I know that sounds ridiculous, but this is my first coding work ever, meant to be a learning experience. I’ve also had 2 children in that time and am now in the midst (almost finished) with a 6 month renovation to my home (so it’s been on hold for 6 months). This started out as an idea between my two brothers and I to make a 2d side-scrolling Resident Evil 4 and learn game development with it. They never quite got the coding/art bug like me, so I have been working on it and learning myself throughout the process. This uses Libgdx and Spine, no other tools, which I wish i had done at this point (box2d, Tiled, etc.), but whatever. I just wanted to post it here, because I’ve come up with another idea, which I think would be a fun game and I really want to ditch this one, but thought it might give me some hope if people thought it wasn’t total crap.\n\nAnyway, the game when finished will basically be a 2d RE4, set within the Cthulhu mythologies. It will be a story based game, where you can backtrack to previous areas. There will be some NPCs scattered about to hand out small quests and bits of story. Exploration, platforming and combat/survival horror are the main aspects/genres, with a few puzzles. Weapons can be found, ammo, treasure and health items as well. Inventory will have a weight limit as well as an slot/space limit (ala Alone in the Dark). There will be a merchant in each area that will be able to buy/sell items, and upgrade weapons (accuracy, firerate, capacity, power, damage).\n\nKI7vky_fzyc\n\nI like the art style. You should put up a download link so we can play it\n\nYes, i’m working on that and hopefully will have one soon. Right now it’s pretty barebones.\n\nCthulhu mythos 2d sidescrolling resident evil style ?\n\nmine\n\nbtw about Cthulhu Mythos, do you plan to add some sort of “sanity check” on horrors and monster player encounters ?\n\nI was asked that one other time while talking to people about the project.\n\nMy brother and I were talking that over (he does help me on story items and level design) and we were somewhat in agreement that a lot of time that gets in the way of gameplay, kind of like the malaria pills in Far Cry 2.\n\nAnyway, there are 2 ways I think that you could do that. One being a bar that fills up and goes down, based on whether you’re in combat/proximity to an enemy (maybe make it where after a certain time the enemy fills up the bar much less, reduces their effect on your sanity). Another being a random chance based on the enemy’s creepiness/size/etc. I would think that the effect would be a freak out animation that lasted for a few secs and then movement would be slowed compared to standard and wouldn’t be able to use weapons.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nThis does not look bad at all. Especially considering the circumstances you describe. And self taught. Well done!\n\nSo you say that you want to ditch it, but then you say when it is finished etc. So are you ditching or finishing?\n\nI’m gonna stick with it I think, it may just have a little less polish than I was wanting originally. I wasn’t sure if my art was going to be a major turnoff to everyone that saw it.\n\nWhen I get done with my house addition/renovation I’ll get a demo up quickly. I’ve just got tiling, trim, painting and fixtures to complete and I’ll be done. :’(\n\nGood stuff! And good luck with the renovation.\n\nOOoh, we can’t have enough Cthulhu mythos games!\n\nIf you haven’t already, take a look at Yahtzee’s Consuming Shadow, it’s a somewhat similar game, although yours seems more combat-oriented while his is a procedural dungeon-crawler of sorts.\n\nI am liking the look of this, especially the decapitating kicks"
