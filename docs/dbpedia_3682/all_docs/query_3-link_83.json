Read blank areas as nodes, the outside being counted first, and enclosure relations as branches. The 0 is merely an orthographic variant for a final parenthesis, reading inward. If this is not old news to you, maybe you would enjoy taking it as a problem to uncover the motivation of this arrangement. If not the time, there is a brief explanation under the stapled section below. Jon Awbrey 404 Michigan Ave. East Lansing, Michigan 48823 This arrangement of trees I have dubbed \"the forest primeval\". It is developed by expressing each integer in its prime factorization, and then carrying this process to its extremes, factoring each exponent into powers of primes, and each of these powers in turn, quitting only when zero (or empty sets of) exponents are reached, and given the convention that unit exponents be expressed as 2⁰. This suggests a system of numerals with the primes in order as place values, the place-holders being exponents instead of multipliers, the held values being multiplied instead of added together, and with the same multitude of place-values implied in each place.\n\nExample {\\displaystyle {\\text{Example}}\\!} 24 = 2 3 ⋅ 3 1 = 2 2 0 ⋅ 3 2 0 ⋅ 3 2 0 = (()(()))(()) = {\\displaystyle 24~=~2^{3}\\cdot 3^{1}~=~2^{2^{0}\\cdot 3^{2^{0}}}\\cdot 3^{2^{0}}~=~{\\texttt {(()(()))(())}}~=~\\!}\n\no / o o o \\ / / o o \\ / @\n\nI have therefore sometimes thought of this as a notation in which numerals are wholly expressed by means of place-value, there being but one symbol, whose only office is to reserve a place; but I'm not sure how much this means, since as much might be said of simple tally marks, with alot less complexity taken for granted.\n\npage 2, hand written\n\nJon Awbrey to Martin Gardner • 78.08.04\n\npage 1, typewritten\n\nAugust 4, 1978 Martin Gardner Scientific American 415 Madison Avenue New York, New York Dear Sir: The attached short essay will update my letter of August 16, 1976 on the \"forest primeval\" or \"petrified trees\", which were just planted plane trees with the planter omitted. The natural correspondence of integers to trees came about as an accidental hybrid of Gödel numbers with Zermelo's integers. The problem of getting a one-to-one correspondence was suggested by the various binary encodings of trees in your column of June 1976, and was worked out later that year while reading Frazer's 'Golden Bough'. However, the time since then has brought forth no obvious use for this correspondence, i.e. no theorems of graph theory seem transferable to number theory (or vice versa) by virtue of it. As a note of possible interest connecting two of your recent columns, Charles Peirce used Bell numbers to count the different forms of n-place relations, giving a complicated expression and a triangular array for calculating them; but I don't know how original these may have been with him. See his 'Collected Papers': 3.229. As a last incidental, Peirce's logical graphs have received a modern echo in George Spencer-Brown's 'Laws of Form', which accents what Peirce called the entitative interpretation of the graphs. Spencer-Brown derives from the algebra of graphs its arithmetic of truth values; and just as Mandelbrot is led to fractional dimensions by a consideration of self-similar curves, Spencer-Brown finds imaginary truth-values useful in evaluating infinitely self-similar graphs. Yours Truly, Jon Awbrey 404 Michigan Ave. East Lansing, Michigan 48823\n\npage 2, typewritten\n\nThe forest primeval: a correspondence between natural numbers and planted plane trees. Consider the primes factorization of a number and represent it as the sequence of its exponents separated by parentheses, thus, N = (n_1) (n_2) (n_3) ... (n_m), ignoring for now the all-zero exponents after some point m. e.g.: 1 = 2^0 = (), 2 = 2^2^0 = (()), 3 = 2^0 3^2^0 = ()(()) Repeat this process with each exponent in the factorization and with each further exponent in 'its' factorization and so on, until zero exponents are reached along every path of development. A zero exponent, having no representation in primes, may simply be omitted on the next pass. For example: 360 = (3)(2)(1) = ((0)(1)) ((1)) ((0)) = (()((0))) (((0))) (()) = (()(())) ((())) (()) = 2^(2^0 3^2^0) 3^2^2^0 5^2^0 Thus, parentheses suffice to represent this \"involved factorization\" of a number. But they also represent planted plane trees, if we interpret the exterior space as the planter, parenthetical containments as further edges, and contained spaces as nodes, e.g.: o o | | o o o o \\| | | o o o \\ | / \\|/ o | 360 = @ In this way, every number may be assigned a unique minimal tree, but many trees will share the same number when the \"insignificant digits\" of a factorization are taken into account. E.g., trees of the following form, where an ellipsis represents an arbitrary number of terminal edges, all have the number 360: o … o … |/ |/ o o … o … o … \\|/ |/ |/ o o o \\ | / \\ | / \\|/ o---… | @ = 2^(2^0 3^(2^0 3^0 …) 5^0 …) 3^(2^(2^0 3^0 …) 3^0 …) 5^(2^0 …) 7^0 … The correspondence becomes one-to-one by the following transformation. To the rightmost \"offspring\", when not the only offspring, of any node of a given planted plane tree, assign an extra unit of significance: such that, if terminal, that node represents a unit exponent; if it is not terminal, the unit may be \"inherited\", but only by a singleton offspring of that node, with a like condition entailing any further inheritance, until a terminal node reached; otherwise, the significance is lost. E.g., 360 is now uniquely represented by the following tree, where primed nodes count for unit exponents under the above rule: o | o o' o \\| | o o o' \\ | / \\|/ o | 360 = @ e.g., we now have: o o o | \\ / o o o | | | @ = () = 1, @ = (()) = 2, @ = ()() = 3\n\npage 2, reformatted\n\nThe Forest Primeval • A Correspondence Between Natural Numbers And Planted Plane Trees\n\nConsider the primes factorization of a positive integer n {\\displaystyle n\\!} and represent it as the sequence of its exponents separated by parentheses, thus, n = ( n 1 ) ( n 2 ) ( n 3 ) … ( n m ) , {\\displaystyle n=(n_{1})(n_{2})(n_{3})\\ldots (n_{m}),\\!} ignoring for now the all-zero exponents after some point m . {\\displaystyle m.\\!}\n\nFor example:\n\n1 = 2 0 = ( ) , 2 = 2 2 0 = ( ( ) ) , 3 = 2 0 3 2 0 = ( ) ( ( ) ) . {\\displaystyle 1=2^{0}=(),\\quad 2=2^{2^{0}}=(()),\\quad 3=2^{0}3^{2^{0}}=()(()).\\!}\n\nRepeat this process with each exponent in the factorization and with each further exponent in its factorization and so on, until zero exponents are reached along every path of development.

Virginia 26506 Dear Sir: I thought you might be interested in this one-one correspondence between natural numbers and planted plane trees, which I worked out after reading Martin Gardner's June 1976 column on Catalan numbers. I have left its description in the somewhat whimsical form which his article originally induced. It seems that A.A. Mullin had suggested the idea of such continued factorizations of exponents as far back as 1954. He called the resulting expressions 'mosaics'. His several articles can be traced through Math Reviews. Recently, F. Göbel has given a 1-1 correspondence between natural numbers and rooted (free) trees, based on continued factorization of the ordinal indices of the primes in a factorization; see Discrete Math, Aug 1980. I have also enumerated (generating function and first few terms only) the expressions resulting from continued factorization of both exponents and indices. These 'riffs' have 1-1 correspondences with special subsets of forests of oriented rooted trees and rooted odd trees.\n\nE.g. {\\displaystyle {\\text{E.g.}}\\!} Number {\\displaystyle {\\text{Number}}\\!} : {\\displaystyle :\\!} 1 {\\displaystyle 1\\!} 2 {\\displaystyle 2\\!} 3 {\\displaystyle 3\\!} 4 {\\displaystyle 4\\!} 5 {\\displaystyle 5\\!} 6 {\\displaystyle 6\\!} 7 {\\displaystyle 7\\!} Riff {\\displaystyle {\\text{Riff}}\\!} : {\\displaystyle :\\!} blank {\\displaystyle {\\text{blank}}\\!} p 1 {\\displaystyle {\\text{p}}_{1}\\!} p p 1 {\\displaystyle {\\text{p}}_{{\\text{p}}_{1}}\\!} p 1 p 1 {\\displaystyle {\\text{p}}_{1}^{{\\text{p}}_{1}}\\!} p p p 1 {\\displaystyle {\\text{p}}_{{\\text{p}}_{{\\text{p}}_{1}}}\\!} p 1 p p 1 {\\displaystyle {\\text{p}}_{1}{\\text{p}}_{{\\text{p}}_{1}}\\!} p p 1 p 1 {\\displaystyle {\\text{p}}_{{\\text{p}}_{1}^{{\\text{p}}_{1}}}\\!} Rooted Index-Functional Forests {\\displaystyle {\\text{Rooted Index-Functional Forests}}\\!} : {\\displaystyle :\\!} blank {\\displaystyle {\\text{blank}}\\!} Rooted Odd Trees (with only) Exponent Symmetries {\\displaystyle {\\text{Rooted Odd Trees}}^{\\text{(with only)}}{\\text{Exponent Symmetries}}~\\!} : {\\displaystyle :\\!}\n\n# of Riffs (by # of p's) = # of Rotes (by # of Γ's) = 1, 1, 2, 6, 20, 73, 281, 1124, 4488[*] Yours truly, Jon Awbrey 521 Sunrise, E.

During the 80's my work shifted its focus from the enumerative to the computational. Yes, there was a distinction then, strange to say, and yet what I meant was more toward theorem-proving programs. All along I had been keeping an eye out for relations among arithmetic (number theory) and algebra (groups), geometry (graphs), and logic -- the \"lambda point\" as one of my professors (Davis) called it then, counting the first two as one. So the little bit of graph and group theory that I picked up was already ready to be converted into data-structures and algorithms able to take advantage of their symmetries, all in support of the new logical mission. But I had to let go of what I earnestly would have kept, all the joys of counting. From my present perspective, what all of these graphs and other sorts of structures have in common is their so-called \"reflective\" or \"self-documenting\" property. The archetype of these \"reflective or auto-documental\" data structures is, of course, the usual construction of natural numbers as sets -- {}, {{}}, {{}{{}}}, ... -- which builds its own distinctive character by keeping a record of its history as it goes. In a similar way, I recall that I first began to think of riffs and all their kin by asking myself a question about molecular tagging: What would be the limit of a tagging tactic? For now, I do not think that I can explain myself any better, but I hope the sense of it will clear in time. Enough flash-forward -- back to the story ... The earliest indication of this line of thinking, that I can find at present among my personal records, is contained in the following letter to Martin Gardner: | 1976-08-16 | | Mr. Martin Gardner | Scientific American | | Dear Sir: | | On the following sheet find the beginnings of a correspondence | between integers and petrified trees, those so rooted and embedded | in their strata as to have a fixed order of limbs at each node. | Read blank areas as nodes, the outside being counted first, and | enclosure relations as branches.

(Neé: Riffs & Rotes & A061396) Date: Fri, 06 Sep 2002 00:30:42 -0400 From: Jon Awbrey <jawbrey@oakland.edu> To: Antti Karttunen <karttu@megabaud.fi> SeqFan <seqfan@ext.jussieu.fr> i will see if i can find the references later, but i remember neil or maybe nordhaus telling me about some similar ideas that a.a. mullin (?) called 'mosaics', some of which got published in the nat.acad.sci., and i think that there were related constructions going back to a goodstein or goldstein in the 20's, also some connections to mirimanoff. all very fuzzy now. my initial interest in riffs and rotes came out of a search for \"auto-documenting data structures\" and \"self-tagging molecules\", plus links between additive and multiplicative number theory that i associated with the question: \"how much of the ordering of the integers is purely combinatorial\", whatever that means. so, yes, some flavor of generalized primes comes into play -- if you ask: is there a \"purely combinatorical\" reason that (p_2)^1 < (p_1)^2? viewed as rotes: o---o o---o | | o---o o---o | | @ <?< @ (p_2)^1 <?< (p_1)^2 fun & games ... links here to dana scott's d_infinity and similar constructions.

(Neé: Riffs & Rotes & A061396) Date: Tue, 10 Sep 2002 09:16:23 -0400 From: Jon Awbrey <jawbrey@oakland.edu> To: Antti Karttunen <karttu@megabaud.fi>, SeqFan <seqfan@ext.jussieu.fr> AK = Antti Karttunen JA = Jon Awbrey some incidental remarks on riffs & rotes, from the standpoint of ordered domains. suppose that we don't know anything at all about the number theory connection, but are simply given a species of trees defined by the following recursion: | @ is a rote. | | if f is a finite function from rotes to rotes, | say, f : index_j ~> exponent_j for j = 1 to k, | where the \"indices\" and \"exponents\" are rotes, | then the following tree is a rote: | | i_1 e_1 i_k e_k | o----o o----o | \\ ... / | \\ | / | \\ | / | \\|/ | @ | | where the rotes for the \"indices\" (source elements) i_j | and the \"exponents\" (target elemnts) e_j are attached | at the places indicated. so the question is, what is a natural way of partial ordering this species? then, can we specify enough information to make it a total linear ordering? JA: | Göbel, F., |\"On a 1-1-Correspondence between Rooted Trees and Natural Numbers\", |'Journal of Combinatorial Theory', B29 (1980), pages 141-143. JA: This correspondence is associated in one way or another with the following sequences in the EIS online database: A005517, A005518, A007097, A057452. JA: In 1980, we find the above paper published, giving a correspondence between rooted trees and natural numbers that is dual, in a sense, to the one that I gave between natural numbers and planted plane trees. In summary, we have: 1. Recur on Index : N <-> Rooted Trees 2. Recur on Power : N <- Planted Plane Trees 3. Recur on Both : N -> Riffs <-> Rotes JA: As given, the 2nd mapping is many-to-one and onto from planted plane trees to natural numbers, but there is a way to make the 2nd mapping injective, at least, I have an old note that claims this, but I will need to read it over again first, as I'm not as sure as I used to be about it. JA: I also notice that Göbel's paper is given as \"Received June 26, 1978\", so I begin to suspect that there must have been something in the air (or the water) that year. JA: Here is a cartoon synopsis of how Göbel's numbering goes: ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤ | | 1 blank blank | 2 p_1 () | 3 p_(p_1) (()) | 4 p_1^2 ()() | 5 p_(p_(p_1)) ((())) | 6 p_1 p_(p_1) ()(()) | 7 p_(p_1^2) (()()) | 8 p_1^3 ()()() | 9 p_(p_1)^2 (())(()) | 10 p_1 p_(p_(p_1)) ()((())) | | ... | ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤ | | o | | | o o o o o | | | | \\ / | o o o o o o o o o o o | | | \\ / | \\ / | \\|/ | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ | | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... | ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤ AK: Something in the air ten years earlier ? | D.W. Matula, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri. | A Natural Rooted Tree Enumeration by Prime Factorization. | SIAM Rev. 10 (1968), p. 273. | | A one-to-one correspondence between the space of rooted | trees and the positive integers is given by the following | recursive procedure. Let the positive integer n correspond | to the root node of a tree, the prime factors of n | (each occurring as often as its multiplicity) correspond | to the edges incident to the root node, and for each such | edge incident to the root which corresponds to the prime p | let the branch of the tree incident to that edge be the | rooted tree corresponding to the number pi(p) (the prime | number function pi). The terminal condition of this | recursion arises quite naturally as unity (which has no | prime factors) is thus associated with each pendent vertex. | On the other hand, the number associated with a given | rooted tree may be recursively determined as follows: | If the numbers associated with the branches of a rooted | tree T are n1, n2, ..., nm, then the unique number | associated with T is the product p(n1) x p(n2) x ... x p(nm), | where p(ni) is the ni:th prime. Certain interesting | relationships between the theories of primes and trees | will be developed utilizing this \"natural\" correspondence. AK: Compare with the beginning of Göbel's paper: | In the sequel, we suppose that p(1) = 2, p(2), p(3), ... | is the sequence of primes in ascending order. | Let T be a rooted tree, r its root. The connected components | of T - r are denoted by T1, ..., Tv, where v is the degree | of r. The graphs Tj (j = 1,...,v) obviously are trees, which | we transform into rooted trees by defining as the the root | of Tj the vertex of Tj which is adjacent to r in T. We now | assign a natural number phi(T) to the rooted tree T. | | Definition. If T has only one vertex, then phi(T) = 1. | If the number of vertices of T is greater than 1, then | | phi(T) = product_{i=1..v} p(phi(Ti)), | | where T1, ..., Tv are the rooted trees defined above. | | ... AK: There's at least one on-line document about Matula-numbers: | Ivan Gutman and Yeong-Nan Yeh, Deducing properties of trees from their Matula numbers, | Publications de L'institut Mathématique (Beograd), Vol. 53(67), pp. 17-22 (1993). | URL: http://www.emis.de/journals/PIMB/067/n067p017.pdf AK: It would be nice to compute the functions f1 - f10 (corresponding to the properties P1 - P10) defined in that paper. I don't know how much you can find connections from there to the classical elementary number theory, but as a simple example, the degree of the rooted tree with Matula/Göbel number n is bigomega(n), (A001222), and \"the primeth recurrence\" A007097 gives the trees with just one leaf. AK: Now, I started thinking why we must use specifically the ordinary primes. Why not use instead the binary encoding of irreducible Z2[x] polynomials, i.e. A014580 (2,3,7,11,13,19,25,31,...) instead of A000040 (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,...) as the function 'p' in the above definition given by Göbel? Of course then we should use the carryless Z2[x] multiplication instead of the ordinary one, to acquire a one-to-one map. AK: So, 5 = 101 in binary (corresponding to x^2 + 1 = x+1 * x+1 in Z2[X]) corresponds now to the tree: \\ / \\/ which in original Matula/Göbel scheme is associated with the number 9. (Deducing the properties of the trees using this scheme might be slightly easier than with the original one?) AK: Combining the mapping N <-> rooted trees, and rooted trees <-> Z2[x] polynomials we obtain a map between the multiplicative semigroup (or specifically: commutative monoid) of natural numbers and the multiplicative semigroup found in the ring of Z2[x] polynomials. Let's call it khi. Unless I'm completely zombie, it obeys khi(1) = 1 and khi(ab) = khi(a) X khi(b) AK: where X means multiplication of Z2[x] polynomials, so it is a homomorphism between these semigroups. AK: Using the standard binary encoding of Z2[x] polynomials we can represent it in OEIS as yet another permutation of natural numbers. Among other things, it maps A000040 and A014580 term-by-term to each other. AK: (How does it map the corresponding multiplication tables A004247 and A048720 to each other?) AK: Then we can get even wilder, because any domain with unique factorization can be used, so why not to use, say Gaussian integers, or some other \"double ring\"? I remember that Marc spoke some months ago about storing these ones to OEIS with the \"bits-interleaved\" method. JA: i will see if i can find the references later, but i remember neil or maybe nordhaus telling me about some similar ideas that a.a. mullin (?) called 'mosaics', some of which got published in the nat.acad.sci., and i think that there were related constructions going back to a goodstein or goldstein in the 20's, also some connections to mirimanoff. all very fuzzy now. JA: my initial interest in riffs and rotes came out of a search for \"auto-documenting data structures\" and \"self-tagging molecules\", plus links between additive and multiplicative number theory that i associated with the question: \"how much of the ordering of the integers is purely combinatorial\", whatever that means. so, yes, some flavor of generalized primes comes into play -- if you ask: JA: is there a \"purely combinatorical\" reason that (p_2)^1 < (p_1)^2? JA: viewed as rotes: | o---o o---o | | | | o---o o---o | | | | @ <?< @ | | (p_2)^1 <?< (p_1)^2 JA: fun & games ...

AK: was it that what you had in mind then? oh, strictly speaking, we should be calling these \"planted plane trees\", as otherwise you can rotate the branches around the root and transform, for example, 6 into 9. i found the two letters that i wrote to martin gardner in 76 & 78, and will try to extract the gist of them later, but here is a bit: | The forest primeval: a correspondence between natural numbers and planted plane trees. | | Consider the primes factorization of a number and represent it as the sequence of its | exponents separated by parentheses, thus, N = (n_1) (n_2) (n_3) ... (n_m), ignoring | for now the all-zero exponents after some point m. | | e.g.: 1 = 2^0 = (), 2 = 2^2^0 = (()), 3 = 2^0 3^2^0 = ()(()) | | Repeat this process with each exponent in the factorization and with each further | exponent in 'its' factorization and so on, until zero exponents are reached along | every path of development. A zero exponent, having no representation in primes, | may simply be omitted on the next pass. For example: | | 360 = (3)(2)(1) = ((0)(1)) ((1)) ((0)) = (()((0))) (((0))) (()) | | = (()(())) ((())) (()) | | = 2^(2^0 3^2^0) 3^2^2^0 5^2^0 | | Thus, parentheses suffice to represent this \"involved factorization\" of a number. | But they also represent planted plane trees, if we interpret the exterior space | as the planter, parenthetical containments as further edges, and contained | spaces as nodes, e.g.: | | o o | | | | o o o o | \\| | | | o o o | \\ | / | \\|/ | o | | | 360 = @ | | In this way, every number may be assigned a unique minimal tree, but | many trees will share the same number when the \"insignificant digits\" of | a factorization are taken into account.

AK: | The rooted plane trees encoded here are: | .....................o...............o.........o...o..o....... | .....................|...............|..........\\./...|....... | .......o....o...o....o....o.o.o..o...o.o.o.o.o...o....o...o... | .......|.....\\./.....|.....\\|/....\\./...\\|.|/....|.....\\./.... | @......@......@......@......@......@......@......@......@..... | 1......2......3......4......5......6......7......8......9..... JA: oh, strictly speaking, we should be calling these \"planted plane trees\" as otherwise you can rotate the branches around the root and transform, for example, 6 into 9. what i meant is that we have to add a planter to the above trees in order to get a correspondence with parenthetical expressions. AK: I'm following Stanley's usage in his \"Exercises on Catalan and Related Numbers\" http://www-math.mit.edu/~rstan/ec/catalan.pdf AK: that is, the above trees belong to his manifestation 19 (e) \"plane trees with n + 1 vertices\" while the next manifestation (f) is given as \"planted (i.e., root has degree one) trivalent plane trees with 2n + 2 vertices\" AK: so I have thought that the term \"planted\" means exactly that, that the tree (whether binary (= trivalent) or general), is \"planted\" on a top of the single \"stem\" | _not_ that it cannot be reflected as a whole, as you indicate. (Because being \"planar\", it is already forbidden). AK: And also, I assume the terms \"plane\", \"planar\", and \"oriented\" (cf. A000108) are synonyms, as well as their antonyms \"non-planar\" and \"non-oriented\" (cf. A000081). AK: Am I correct? AK: I guess we could create a \"tree matrix\", where we have all the combinations of labeled/unlabeled, rooted/non-rooted, planar/non-planar, binary/general trees, with each entry pointing to the corresponding enumerating EIS-sequence. (will do that, when I have spare time ...)\n\nNote 12\n\nSubj: The Forest Primeval Date: Thu, 19 Sep 2002 14:16:32 -0400 From: Jon Awbrey <jawbrey@oakland.edu> To: SeqFan <seqfan@ext.jussieu.fr> Here is what the initial mapping of numbers into parenthetical expressions looked like: 1 2^0 o () 2 2^2^0 (o) (()) 3 2^0 3^2^0 o(o) ()(()) 4 2^2^2^0 ((o)) ((())) 5 2^0 3^0 5^2^0 oo(o) ()()(()) 6 2^2^0 3^2^0 (o)(o) (())(()) 7 2^0 3^0 5^0 7^2^0 ooo(o) ()()()(()) 8 2^[2^0 3^2^0] (o(o)) (()(())) 9 2^0 3^2^2^0 o((o)) ()((())) 10 2^2^0 3^0 5^2^0 (o)o(o) (())()(()) 11 2^0 3^0 5^0 7^0 11^2^0 oooo(o) ()()()()(()) 12 2^2^2^0 3^2^0 ((o))(o) ((()))(()) 13 2^0 3^0 5^0 7^0 11^0 13^0 ooooo(o) ()()()()()(()) 14 2^2^0 3^0 5^0 7^2^0 (o)oo(o) (())()()(()) 15 2^0 3^2^0 5^2^0 o(o)(o) ()(())(()) 16 2^2^2^2^0 (((o))) (((()))) The \"o\" is just an easier to read variant for an empty pair of terminal parentheses. Here is the second half of that note I wrote, where I \"supposedly\" got a 1-1 correspondence: | The correspondence becomes one-to-one by the following transformation. | To the rightmost \"offspring\", when not the only offspring, of any node | of a given planted plane tree, assign an extra unit of significance: | such that, if terminal, that node represents a unit exponent; if it | is not terminal, the unit may be \"inherited\", but only by a singleton | offspring of that node, with a like condition entailing any further | inheritance, until a terminal node reached; otherwise, the significance | is lost. E.g., 360 is now uniquely represented by the following tree, | where primed nodes count for unit exponents under the above rule: | | o | | | o o' o | \\| | | o o o' | \\ | / | \\|/ | o | | | 360 = @ Subsequently, I wrote this marginal note: | e.g., now: | | o o o | | \\ / | o o o | | | | | @ = () = 1, @ = (()) = 2, @ = ()() = 3 Well, that is what I wrote, but to be honest it looks wrong somehow. Maybe I muffed up the initial conditions in my later note. Or maybe it can be fixed by deleting the \"when not the only offspring\" clause in the token-passing transformation. Let me give it another try ... What we are really interested in are sequences of exponents, that we turn into sequences of trees, and we use the gimmick of a graph-theoretical \"planter\" to convert the sequences of trees into planted plane trees. In the general setting, the planter look like this: ^ ^ ^ \\|/ o | @ But it's a quirky property of this set-up that the empty sequence and the singleton sequences require planters that appear to be excessively large: Empty sequence <>: o | @ Singleton sequence <k>: k | o | @ So maybe I should have written: | o' o o' | | \\ / | o o o | | | | | @ = _ = 1, @ = () = 2, @ = ()() = 3 So far this seems to suggest that the buck-passing rule should apply to every node but the root, but now I will have to rethink the whole thing. Maybe I'll just leave this one to the current inhabitants of Fair Catalania, and return to the Realm Of Rote Arithmetic.\n\nNote 13\n\nSubj: The Lambda Point Date: Thu, 19 Sep 2002 15:14:15 -0400 From: Jon Awbrey <jawbrey@oakland.edu> To: SeqFan <seqfan@ext.jussieu.fr> AK = Antti Karttunen AK: So far I haven't found/constructed any ranking scheme which would be practical to implement as a computer algorithm, in a sense that the sequence {max integer mapped to the size n tree} wouldn't grow too steeply. I reckon this is also the problem with Matula/Göbel encoding of rooted unoriented trees. Ok, there are lots and lots of mappings between any two countable sets, so I guess that the \"interesting\" ones are relative to one's interest, one's end-in-view, and most likely one's personal sense of aesthetics. I was initially interested in the correspondences that might serve as mathematical \"labor-saving devices\", allowing us to transfer theorems, what we know and can prove, among different domains, especially among algebra, geometry, and logic -- what one of my teachers used to call the \"lambda point\", after the critical triple point of transitions among gas, liquid, and solid phases. From this perspective, it's not a problem, may even be a feature, that some relatively big numbers have some interesting aspects of their structure captured by some relatively small graphs. I haven't said anything about the logical side of this yet, but remember that it was folks like Gödel, not to mention Peirce, who lobbed us into this particular briar patch.\n\nNote 14\n\nResidual Questions ... Here is how I last defined rotes: JA: | @ is a rote. | | If f is a finite function from rotes to rotes, | say, f : index_j ~> exponent_j for j = 1 to k, | where the \"indices\" and \"exponents\" are rotes, | then the following tree is a rote: | | i_1 e_1 i_k e_k | o----o o----o | \\ ... / | \\ | / | \\ | / | \\|/ | @ | | where the rotes for the \"indices\" (source elements) i_j | and the \"exponents\" (target elemnts) e_j are attached | at the places indicated. Strictly speaking, I probably should have stipulated that each f is a \"finite partial function\" from rotes to rotes, but since the set of rotes is infinite the partiality of f might be taken as implicit in the fact of its being finite. Let $N$ (\"Script N\") be the set of rotes. Let (X -> Y) be the set of functions from X to Y. Let [X -> Y] be the set of finite partial functions from X to Y. Then we have the isomorphism $N$ ~=~ [$N$ -> $N$], that is, every rote k : $N$ is uniquely analyzed as a finite partial function k : $N$ -> $N$, and every such function gets a unique gödel number in $N$. Notice the polymorphism of types. 1 = {} = the empty function 2 = (p_1)^1 = {<1, 1>} 3 = (p_2)^1 = {<2, 1>} 4 = (p_1)^2 = {<1, 2>} 5 = (p_3)^1 = {<3, 1>} 6 = (p_1)^1 (p_2)^1 = {<1, 1>, <2, 1>} As rooted trees, these look like this: o--o | o--o o--o o--o o-o | | | / o--o o--o o--o o--o o-o o-o | | | | \\ / @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Anyway, I think this is right, but I've learned not to trust stuff like this until several other people have a chance to go over it.\n\nNote 15\n\nMore Residual Questions ... JA: so the question is, what is a natural way of partial ordering this species? then, can we specify enough information to make it a total linear ordering? AK: I delve into this later in autumn, after I have read more about posets and lattices, and also when I have grokked your rotes & riffs (has to find the folder where I put all your mails I printed out then ...) AK: Anyways, I doubt in the following: JA: my initial interest in riffs and rotes came out of a search for \"auto-documenting data structures\" and \"self-tagging molecules\", plus links between additive and multiplicative number theory that I associated with the question: \"how much of the ordering of the integers is purely combinatorial\", whatever that means. so, yes, some flavor of generalized primes comes into play -- if you ask: is there a \"purely combinatorical\" reason that (p_2)^1 < (p_1)^2? AK: that you could find with such methods a total order that would correspond with our usual linear order 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < ... because it's based on the additive property of integers, and these N <-> various trees schemes are based on the multiplicative properties (more or even less). (And I'm afraid that the connection with primes and such is just a red herring ...)"
