I w ill state to the Senator that Mr. why I was here. I recollect that I heard through the papers Emery was an old resident of Washington, that he came from that seven ladies had fallen prostrated a t their desks in the my own State, and he w as mayor of the city of Washington at building down there, overheated or overworked or something. one time. He was a man of the highest personal and business I went down there and interviewed Governor Merriam, who was integrity, and. from the information 1 get, his property is being the superintendent, a most excellent gentleman in every re­ sold without any middlemen or without any rake off to anybody. spect. He was kind enough to go over the building with me, Beyond a doubt, it is very cheap property at the price a t which and I found that it w as a veritable hothouse. The superin­ tendent had very pleasant rooms and so had the important it is offered to the Government. Mr. NEWLANDS. Mr. President, I have no reason to doubt clerks; but the mass of the women, who labor in tabulating the good faith of the transaction or the reasonableness of the statements and making out cards and I do not know what else, labor there under difficulties that would prostrate a dray horse. price. It is not humane, it is not decent, to have the employees of Mr. BACON. W ith the permission of the Senator, I will say this Government at work in such a place. The men can take that I did not intend to be understood as casting any reflection on anybody. I asked in good faith, because I did not know; I care of themselves somehow, but these women can not. They desired to know, I w as entitled to know, and I am glad now are not at work for the Government for their health or for anything but the stress of hard circumstances that compel them that I do know. Mr. GALLINGER. I can assure the Senator from Georgia to work for the Government, and they are entitled to good pay that I had no thought he asked the question in any other spirit and they are entitled to good quarters. The health of those people ought to be considered. I do not care bow much delay than that of getting information. Mr. NEWLANDS. Mr. President, I wish to say that I have it takes or how much money it costs, we ought to suffer the no reason to doubt the good faith of the transaction so far as delay and undertake the expenditure in order to secure the the owners of the property are concerned, and I have no reason comfort and the health and the lives of these people. They do to doubt the reasonableness of the price, but I do question the not forfeit their right as citizens and human bemgs because suitableness of the location. I believe that the Government they become employees of the United States Government. I have been through other places in this city where other should at some time acquire the block in question as a part of the great project of improving the city and improving the employees were at work, because I wanted to see for myself grounds about the Capitol, but I do not believe that this prop­ what i had so often heard, and the conditions have been such that they would be incredible to one who had not undertaken to erty should be acquired for this purpose. I believe humanity demands that the Senate of the Unitedlook for himself. States should adhere to this amendment, reasonable as it is, As this is an opportunity to rectify what I consider an and permit the Government to exercise the judgment, which enormous wrong, I shall agree wTitli the Senator from Nevada necessarily we can not exercise here, to inquire into the facts to disagree to this report and let it go back m order that the and come to a speedy conclusion, whether that conclusion be Senate may insist upon its amendments. the acceptance of the present site or the construction of a I have nothing to say about the civil-service scheme and the proper building upon some other site to be selected by the Gov­ work in the civil service except to say that I think the civil ernment. For that reason I shall oppose the adoption of the service itself is the biggest fraud and sham and humbug in report. this whole country. I do not believe in it, because I know how Mr. McCUMBER. Mr. President, I wish to correct one error it works. I know that the greatest apostles and the greatest that seems to be quite prevalent here, and that is that the preachers of this new doctrine are those who violate it every amendment which I offered and which w as adopted by the day of their lives. The men who make the loudest professions Senate, and which the conferees agreed should go out, w as in conflict in any way with the provision in the census bill allow ­ are continually in the breach of the law. I also know that when I was informed in the last census that ing the director to select anyone who is qualified by previous work without this examination. It is not in conflict with it, as I could make twelve temporary appointments for six months one would think by the argument that w as made by the Senator I did not ask anybody to come from Mississippi. I would not ask anybody to come here for six months employment and spend from Texas. I want to speak with reference to another matter also, andthree months of it in coming here and going back home, and that is as to this being general legislation. The House sent risk the chances of the examination. So I appointed only three, here a bill in which they repealed a part of the general legisla­ whom I found here, who wanted the places. Most of the others tion relating to the civil service. The House is in no position, I never saw in my life beforeor since, but they were people, I therefore, if we adopt their clause which repeals a part of the believe, who belong here generally in the District. There are thousands of poor women in this D istrict to-day civil-service law for the benefit of this bill, to object if we should also ask to add to the civil-service law a provision which who live, God only knows how, who are trying to keep the may be called “ general legislation.” In other words, if they by w olf from the door, some of them with the responsibilities of a bill affect general legislation by an amendment, then they aged parents, some of them widows with children, who would can not object to our affecting general legislation also by an be very glad to get these crumbs that fall from the master’s amendment, the one adding to, the other taking away. That is table Occasionally. I do not see why they should not have it. Why should any Senator insist upon dragging people two or the only difference in the world. The Senator from Texas stated that it was an injury to any three thousand miles to come here to do six mouths’ service of these people to come from the States and go into this gov­ or a year’s service? I quite agree with the Senator from ernment employment. If it is an injury that he wants to pre­ Texas when he said, a while ago, that it w as a cruel kind­ vent, is it not equally an injury to those who are in the city ness to a young man to bring him from home and put him here who are put into government employment, and remain in public employment here. There he is an individual, and there the whole length of their lives, and have to be generally here he is a number. He loses his individuality, lie loses his supported by the Government or by some charitable institution initiative, and he loses his citizenship. It is almost impossible, I suppose, to get along altogether with women in these minor when they get through? Afl the Senators who have spoken upon this question have clerical positions, but in such service I would take every man agreed with me that the legislation is right and along proper out of government employment as far as it could be done. I hope that the Senate will disagree to the report and insist lines, while they may say that it ought to be amended in some little particular. That could be done in conference.

I have no doubt, ns stated by Senators on the floor, that the propo­ sition for the sale and purchase of this particular lot is one be­ yond cftticfsin, luit r confess my curiosity was excited by the fiiet Ilent the extraordinary position should be taken that that locality should he selected, and that alone, and that the slight opportunity for the Government to exercise any discretion was peremptorily denied. That is a strange thing to me. If the proposition were one which rejected that locality there might be some reason in the contention of those who oppose the Sen­ ate amendment • hut when the Senate amendment recognizes the ability ip the last resort to take that locality if it should lie found necessary and simply gives the opportunity to select some more desirable locality if it shall lie found to he practicable, I can not see upon .what condition such a. position is assumed. I do not desire to detain the Senate further than to say that, hi common with other Senators, dining the toil yeats since that building has been occupied it has frequently been my duty to visit it and I have never visited it but what I have been im­ presses by the fact that in the whole city of Washington there is not a locality more unfit for the purposes to which it is put, owing to the circumstance that there have to be congregated there several thousand people, subjected to all the iiiconveniences and, to more than inconveniences, the inhumanities which are necessarily found there In the heated season of (lie year, when they must be at work. I ha\\c personally known of instances such as that narrated by the Senator from Missis­ sippi [Mr. Money], where delicate women have succumbed un­ der the conditions, which are sufficient to overcome strong men.

The yeas and nays were ordered. Mr. BEVERIDGE. I should like to have the exact proposi­ tion upon which we are to vote reported to the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the report. Mr. BEVERIDGE I am aware of that perfectly; but what I want to know before I vote, and several other Senators also, is exactly the proposition in the legislative form in which it appears In the hilt before we vote. We can not vote upon what we may gather from a debate, more or less necessarily discur­ sive. At least 1 shall not vote without knowing upon what I am voting. Mr. IIALE. This is a case that comes up every day in the Senate. It is simply the question whether the report shall be accepted. Mr. BEVERIDGE. I am aware of that. Mr. HALE. The report has been made, it lias been read and printed, and the question is simply upon its adoption. Its read­ ing can not be called for again, because it has already had its reading. Mr. BEVERIDGE. I am perfectly aware that it Is the cus­ tomary question that comes before the Senate, as to whether a report shall bo agreed to or not. I am also aware that not in one case in a hundred, on the question of agreeing to a conforenee report, are the yeas and nays called for. There have been two propositions of some kind or other debated here at considerable length. Those two propositions are told in a few brief words in the bill. So far as I am concerned, before I vote 1 want to know exactly the legislative form in which they are put. I think that is a reasonable request to make before voting. Mr. IIALE.
