The computation includes the massive neutrinos, zero-mass weakly interacting particles, ordinary matter, and radiation. The distribution of massive neutrinos is computed as a function of the magnitude and direction of the momentum. Matter and radiation are treated as a single ideal fluid. The coherence length lambdaJ of the mass distribution prior to galaxy formation may be compared to the present clustering length of galaxies.
