You can stay on their campgrounds in a cabin, tent or RV. Go!\n\nBreathtaking!!! So happy we visited the Chasm. What breathtaking views. We are left with wonderful memories of the Adirondacks. We will make sure to visit here again the next time we are in the area. The views are not to be missed!!!\n\nHiking/ Sightseeing. This was my first time visiting Ausable Chasm and I was amazed. Whether you are a adventurer seeker or a sightseer there is something for everyone. I chose the hiking/ sightseeing but I heard from other friends the water rafting experience is awesome! I definitely know I will be returning soon. I strongly recommend visiting this place! Whether youâre with friends or family you will definitely enjoy yourself.\n\nThe chasm is absolutely amazing! We went on the adventure trail and rafting, both of which were tremendous fun. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a trip!\n\nOne of the best places Iâve ever been to! A great place for anyone to see a natural wonder and to walk through it, no matter what your fitness level.\n\nAwesome place. We did the adventure trail which was awesome. Totally worth it. I didn't know what to expect when we started but it was a thrill. The inner sanctum hike was scenic as well. If you have a chance don't miss the ADVENTURE TRAIL!!\n\nGreat day! We recently spent the day in the chasm during our camping trip. We had a great time! Trails are well maintained and we enjoyed both rafting and tubing. The tubes were great for fun on your own and the rafting provided a guide who gave facts and history. Would recommend if you are looking for a fun day that you can make as active or nonactive as you want."
