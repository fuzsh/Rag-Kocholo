computerized wagering game machines, and more specifically to a wagering game machine utilizing biofeedback in varying game play.\n\nComputerized wagering games have largely replaced traditional mechanical wagering game machines such as slot machines, and are rapidly being adopted to implement computerized versions of games that are traditionally played live such as poker and blackjack. These computerized games provide many benefits to the game owner and to the gambler, including greater reliability than can be achieved with a mechanical game or human dealer, more variety, sound, and animation in presentation of a game, and a lower overall cost of production and management.\n\nthe elements of computerized wagering game systems are in many ways the same as the elements in the mechanical and table game counterparts in that they must be fair, they must provide sufficient feedback to the game player to make the game fun to play, and they must meet a variety of gaming regulations to ensure that both the machine owner and gamer are honest and fairly treated in implementing the game. Further, they must provide a gaming experience that is at least as attractive as the older mechanical gaming machine experience to the gamer, to ensure success in a competitive gaming market.\n\nComputerized wagering games often do not rely on the dealer to facilitate game play and to provide an entertaining game playing environment, but rely upon the presentation of the game and environment generated by the wagering game machine itself. Incorporation of audio and video features into wagering games to present the wagering game, to provide help, and to enhance the environment presented are therefore important elements in the attractiveness and commercial success of a computerized wagering game system. Music and environmental effects are also played through speakers in some wagering game systems to enhance or complement a theme of the wagering game. These sounds typically accompany video presentation of the wagering game on a screen, which itself often includes animation, video, and three-dimensional graphics as part of presentation of the wagering game.\n\nthe presentation of a wagering game is therefore often a significant factor in attracting a wagering game player to one machine rather than another, and is a key element of the desirability and profitability of a particular wagering game design.\n\nHigh quality game design and engaging themes are priorities in new game development, and presentation of the wagering game is often tailored to ensure that a wagering game player is entertained throughout the gaming experience.\n\nOne example embodiment of the invention comprises a computerized wagering game system including a gaming module comprising gaming code which is operable when executed on to conduct a wagering game on which monetary value can be wagered, and a biofeedback module operable to track at least one biometric characteristic of a game player.\n\nthe wagering game is further operable to alter presentation of the wagering game based on changes in the at least one biometric characteristic.\n\na mood enhancement module is operable to provide energy to a wagering game player at a frequency designed to provide a mood enhancing effect.\n\nFIG. 1 shows a computerized wagering game machine, as may be used to practice some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 2 is a flowchart of a method of operating a computerized wagering game machine including altering presentation of the game via biometric tracking, consistent with some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 3 is a diagram of a wagering game system showing various biometric measurement devices, consistent with some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 4 is a block diagram of a computerized wagering game system employing biometric feedback or mood enhancement functionality, consistent with some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 5 is a flowchart showing an example method of operating a mood enhancement module in a wagering game system.\n\nFIG. 6 shows a wagering game system comprising a chair having audio and tactile transducers coupled to a mood enhancement module, consistent with an example embodiment of the present invention.\n\na computerized wagering game system includes a gaming module comprising gaming code which is operable when executed on to conduct a wagering game on which monetary value can be wagered, and a biofeedback module operable to track at least one biometric characteristic of a game player.\n\nthe wagering game is further operable to alter presentation of the wagering game based on changes in the at least one biometric characteristic.\n\nthe biofeedback module comprises a mood enhancement module that is operable to provide energy to a wagering game player at a frequency designed to provide a mood enhancing effect.\n\nthe energy is provided in various embodiments through various transducers or other devices, examples of such including an acoustic transducer, an electromagnetic antenna, a video display, and an air ionizer.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a computerized wagering game machine, as may be used to practice some embodiments of the present invention.\n\nthe computerized gaming system shown generally at 100 is a video wagering game system, which displays information for at least one wagering game upon which monetary value can be wagered on video display 101 .\n\nVideo display 101 is in various embodiments a CRT display, a plasma display, an LCD display, a surface conducting electron emitter display, or any other type of display suitable for displaying electronically provided display information.\n\nFurther embodiments include a top box display 102 , operable to display a second game, bonus game, or other video or graphics. Alternate embodiments of the invention will have other game indicators, such as mechanical reels instead of the video graphics reels shown at 103 that comprise a part of a video slot machine wagering game.\n\na wagering game is implemented using software within the wagering game system, such as through instructions stored on a machine-readable medium such as a hard disk drive or nonvolatile memory.\n\nsome or all of the software stored in the wagering game machine is encrypted or is verified using a hash algorithm or encryption algorithm to ensure its authenticity and to verify that it has not been altered.\n\nthe wagering game software is loaded from nonvolatile memory in a compact flash card, and a hash value is calculated or a digital signature is derived to confirm that the data stored on the compact flash card has not been altered.\n\nthe wagering game implemented via the loaded software takes various forms in different wagering game machines, including such well-known wagering games as reel slots, video poker, blackjack, craps, roulette, or hold 'em games.\n\nthe wagering game is played and controlled with inputs such as various buttons 104 or via a touchscreen overlay to video screen 101 .\n\ninputs such as various buttons 104 or via a touchscreen overlay to video screen 101 .\n\nother devices such as a pull arm are used to initiate reel spin in this reel slot machine example, and are employed to provide other input interfaces to the game player.\n\nMonetary value is typically wagered on the outcome of the games, such as with tokens, coins, bills, or cards that hold monetary value.\n\nthe wagered value is conveyed to the machine through a changer 106 or a secure user identification module interface 107 , and winnings are returned via the returned value card or through the coin tray 108 .\n\nSound is also provided through speakers 109 , typically including audio indicators of game play, such as reel spins, credit bang-ups, and environmental or other sound effects or music to provide entertainment consistent with a theme of the computerized wagering game.\n\nthe wagering game machine is coupled to a network, and is operable to use its network connection to receive wagering game data, track players and monetary value associated with a player, and to perform other such functions.\n\nthe video display 101 and the speakers 109 are used to present the wagering game to the game player, and in some embodiments are replaced or supplemented with other features such as mechanical reels in a mechanical reel slot machine to convey game information and entertain the game player.\n\nMany wagering game machines also have themes, such as a game centered around a fishing theme or an old west theme.\n\nVarious video, graphics, sounds, and animations are often presented consistent with the wagering game theme, and various objects such as static art on the machine or reel symbols are often related to the selected theme.\n\nthe pace of presentation of the game, the animations, the sound effects, and other elements of wagering game presentation are typically under the control of the wagering game system's software, and can be varied according to the software's instruction.\n\nvarious components of a wagering game presentation are varied dependent on biofeedback data collected from the wagering game player. This enables the wagering game to adapt to the excitement level, mood, or present disposition of the wagering game player, and to make the game presentation more enjoyable for the game player.\n\nFIG. 2 is a flowchart, illustrating an example method of operating a wagering game including changing presentation of the wagering game based on biometric feedback, consistent with an example embodiment of the invention.\n\na wagering game session of play is initiated at 201 , which in various embodiments includes depositing monetary value in the wagering game machine such as by depositing tokens, a stored value card, a player identification card, or another such item.\n\nthe game player then begins game play, and baseline biometric measurements are taken at 202 .\n\nthe baseline biometric measurements are used as a temporary estimation of ânormalâ or reference biometric indicators for the wagering game player in this example.\n\nbaseline biometric parameters will be stored, such as in a player identification card or in a server such that they can be referenced based on identification of a player at a networked wagering game machine. This enables a baseline to be established over time, and will likely provide more useful baseline biometric data than simply taking a new baseline measurement at the start of each gaming session.\n\nthe baseline in some such embodiments is a time-averaged biometric measurement, which in some further embodiments includes range information such as a time-averaged standard deviation indicating the normal degree of variability of a particular biometric measurement.\n\nthe system of this example therefore tracks biometric measurement changes over time at 203 , and uses the time-based average biometric measurement as a baseline. Changes in biometric measurements are therefore not only observable as changes from a previous biometric measurement, but are comparable against a time-weighted average or other baseline biometric measurement throughout a session of game play, and in some further embodiments are comparable in relative magnitude to typical variation from a baseline parameter through use of a standard deviation metric or other such metric.\n\nthe change from the biometric average is then used to adjust some parameter of game play at 204 , such as to change the pace of play, the pace or pitch of music, or the animations presented to the wagering game player.\n\nFIG. 3 shows a more detailed example of a wagering game system operable to track biometric measurements from a wagering game player, consistent with some embodiments of the invention.\n\nthe wagering game machine 301 has a touchscreen 302 , and various inputs such as a pullarm 303 and buttons 304 .\n\nthe system shown further includes a seat 305 , and one or more additional sensors 306 , such as a pupil scanner or infrared camera.\n\nBiometric sensors including body temperature monitors, blood pressure monitors, a pulse sensor, or a body movement sensor are incorporated into the player interface devices.\n\nbuttons 304 here incorporate various features such as infrared temperature sensors, pulse sensors, or blood pressure sensors for reading a game player's biometric information.\n\nthe seat 305 includes one or more pressure sensors, which in operation are used to monitor shifting around in the seat during game play.\n\nAdditional sensors such as the pupil scanner or infrared camera can be mounted as shown at 306 , and used to monitor the pupil diameter of the game player's eye or monitor the infrared profile of the game player's face. It is anticipated that changes in the game player's interest will be reflected in the biometric measurements taken, such as a higher pulse when the game player is excited or a lower pulse when the game player becomes bored. Similarly, body temperature and blood pressure are expected to be higher when a game player is excited, and lower when the game player is calm. Pupil diameter is known to increase when a person is content or happy, and contracts when the person is upset or nervous. Infrared imaging of a game player's face can reveal information regarding the body temperature and blood flow in the game player, where higher perceived body temperature or blood flow indicate dilated blood vessels and higher levels of excitement in the game player.\n\nbiometric measurements such as a player who has the flu or is drunk. Such players may have elevated body temperatures and dilated blood vessels, but have relatively low pulses and blood pressure. Some embodiments of the invention will therefore consider various combinations of biometric parameters, and in still further embodiments can be used to detect unusual or unsafe conditions such as illness or intoxication in game players.\n\nmonitoring or tracking such parameters related to potential medical or physical condition may be considered confidential or an intrusion into the privacy of the game player by some wagering game players, such information may be limited in the way it is used, such as by being provided only to security personnel for purposes of monitoring the game player while in the gaming facility to ensure the game player's health and safety or for notifying the wait staff that a player may be intoxicated and should not be served any further alcohol.\n\nbiometric measurements that can indicate identity, such as infrared face scans or pupil/retina scans, can be used to identify a particular game player.\n\nidentity such as infrared face scans or pupil/retina scans\n\nbiometric measurements can be used to identify a particular game player. This enables the wagering game system to perform a variety of functions based on establishing the identity of a player, from eliminating the need for tracking cards to enhancing security. For example, a player having a certain number of credits or dollars in his account can simply sit at a wagering game machine and have his identity confirmed through the biometric measurements, eliminating the need to carry or protect a player tracking or player value card.\n\nadditional information such as a pin number will be required as a second form of protection for the player's account, ensuring the security and accuracy of the biometric identification.\n\nIdentifying a game player using biometric identifiers can also be used to identify known cheats, such as those who have previously had their biometric baseline data measured and stored while playing, or who have simply been photographed or are otherwise recognizable to the wagering game machine, but who have since been banned or restricted from playing wagering games in a particular gaming establishment.\n\nThis functionality greatly enhances the gaming facility's ability to monitor the premises for known cheats, due to both the relatively low cost of incorporating such functionality into machines and the relatively high cost of paying additional security people who may be more easily fooled or distracted to monitor the gaming establishment.\n\nFIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a wagering game system having a variety of interfaces to a wagering game player, as may be used to practice some embodiments of the invention.\n\na processor 401 is coupled to a computer bus 402 , linking the processor to other components such as memory 403 and nonvolatile storage 404 .\n\nthe nonvolatile storage is shown here as a hard disk drive, but in other embodiments is nonvolatile or flash memory, or another suitable nonvolatile storage device.\n\na touchscreen video display 405 and a speaker 406 are coupled for presentation of video and sound to the wagering game player, and button 407 serves as an additional means of player input into the wagering game machine. Additional sensors such as a camera are also incorporated in various embodiments, as shown at 408 .\n\nthe processor 401 executes software instructions loaded into memory 403 from nonvolatile storage 404 , and controls the other peripheral devices such as the touchscreen display 405 and the speaker 406 at the direction of the software instructions.\n\nthe software is further operable to receive notice and react to user inputs, such as actuation of the touchscreen 405 or the buttons 407 .\n\nthe wagering game in various embodiments is also operable to receive biometric information from wagering game players, as detected by sensors such as a pulse sensor, a blood pressure sensor, a body temperature sensor, an infrared camera 408 , a pupil scanner 408 , or a body movement sensor. Many of these sensors can be built into user interface components such as the button 407 or incorporated as a separate information gathering device as shown at 408 , and can be used to measure and track various biometric characteristics of a wagering game player during sessions of game play.\n\nthe various biometric sensors in this example embodiment are also coupled to the bus 402 , enabling the processor and wagering game code to respond to detected biometric data based on the content of the biometric data and the program instructions.\n\nthe software is thereby able to make various changes in presentation of the wagering game, such as increasing or decreasing the pace or pitch of music, animation, or another aspect of the game presentation, or cutting off play for an obviously intoxicated player.\n\nReel symbols include fish, bobbers, boats, fishing rods, and other fishing-related items, and are displayed as graphic elements on reels rendered via a touchscreen display.\n\nBackground animation includes a fisher in a boat on a lake, along with frogs, rippling waves, jumping fish, and other animated objects. Background sounds accompany the frogs, jumping fish, waves, motorized movement of the boat, casting a fishing rod, and other such sounds.\n\nVarious events or animations such as the boat moving positions on the lake, or the fisher casting the line out again are presented between reel spins, along with other animations including accumulation of fish in qualification for a bonus event.\n\nany of these events can be varied in pace or in frequency, and the sounds accompanying them can be changed in pitch, volume, in complexity, or in other characteristics to either make presentation of the wagering game more exciting or less exciting.\n\nThese changes to the presentation of a wagering game are therefore based on biometric measurement readings in various embodiments of the invention so that the wagering game system is able to maintain player interest and excitement in playing the presented game.\n\nthe fishing environment may include more elements such as frogs, jumping fish, and seagull noises when the player's biometric characteristics suggest boredom or fatigue, and the same elements may be scaled back when the player is already excited.\n\nVariation of the frequency or energy presented to a wagering game player is used in a further example to enhance the wagering game player's mood or other physical response, through a mood enhancing module.\n\nthe mood enhancing module is in various embodiments designed to enhance the mood, physical well-being, psychological state, or other such mood-related state of the wagering game player.\n\nthe wagering game system records the player's voice, and analyzes its spectral content.\n\nthe mood enhancement module plays missing frequencies through a speaker 406 , using a bioacoustic feedback system which is employed to provide frequencies designed to supplement those of the wagering game player's voice.\n\nvoice-supplementing frequencies is believed in some applications to heighten awareness, to promote a feeling of relaxation, and to cause other feelings of well-being\n\nrecords of a particular wagering game player's voice are recorded or the spectral content is stored, so that the spectral content and relationship between spectral components in a wagering game player's voice can be stored and re-used.\n\nthe data in embodiments where a network is available is stored in some embodiments in a network server, so that a user identification card or other identifier can be used on a variety of wagering game machines within a single establishment or across networked establishments and still benefit from the stored voice data.\n\naudible or visible beats or oscillations are presented to the wagering game player, such as through the speaker 406 or the touchscreen video display 405 .\n\nthe frequencies are produced as beats when they are formed as the difference between two or more fundamental tones, although frequencies can be produced by sums, products, differences, or other mathematical functions of root tones in further embodiments.\n\na speaker such as speaker 406 that is unable to produce frequencies below 20 Hz as a pure tone due to its limited frequency response is able to produce higher frequencies that are a certain frequency apart such that the beats produced by their difference are under 20 Hz.\n\na 400 Hz tone and a 401 Hz tone for example, can be easily produced at loud volume by most full-range speakers, but the resulting 1 Hz difference tone cannot.\n\nfrequencies can have significant physiological effects when presented to a person, such as a wagering game player.\n\na variety of frequencies are listed in the table below, along with the areas in which they are believed to have a physiological or mood-altering effect.\n\nThese example frequencies include brainwave frequencies that are associated with various mental states, and which can be employed under the theory that brainwave entrainment can coax brainwaves to a certain frequency and achieve as a result the mental state associated with that frequency.\n\nhealing frequencies are employed to address illnesses or to stimulate regions or systems within the body.\n\nNatural phenomena frequencies are frequencies that occur in nature, such as various periods or resonances of biological, geological, and planetary cycles. The example frequencies listed below are but examples of these frequencies, as explained in the cited source listed in the bibliography that follows.\n\nAT Auriculotherapy device information from Bentek Corp.\n\nEarlobe type electrodes are specified for some conditions, TENS or ECG type electrodes for others.\n\nDevice has two channels, indicated for each ailment.\n\nthe HC entries may be used with sound or possibly vibrationâHC advocated using tuning forks on precise body parts.\n\nMPT This denotes the frequencies calculated for the revolutions of the various asteroids, risen to a high enough octave to be heard as a sound.\n\nthe frequencies of the asteroids were generated using the following method:\n\nPSI PsiliPharm â5,000 HZ Frequencies To Boost Growth Of Plantsâ, Cannibis.Com,\n\nRV Primordial Tones meditation on the Archetypal energies of Celestial Bodies, Joachim-Ernst Berendt, ReVision, Summer 1987 for planets.\n\nRVX Remote Viewing The Story Of The Real X-Files, Paranormal Management Systems, deadlink://www.fastnet.co.uk/pms/real_x.htm\n\nfrequencies believed through experience of various parties to have physiological or mood-enhancing effects when radiated as energy to a person. Many of these frequencies listed can be directly radiated as sound energy via a speaker, or as light energy such as via a video display by tailoring the refresh rate, change rate for a moving or cycling image. or other visible feature of the video image. Some frequencies are intended to be delivered as electromagnetic radiation, or as other energy directed toward the wagering game player.\n\nSome embodiments will combine various methods of energy radiation, or will combine a mode of energy radiation with another feature such as presentation of a certain color believed to have a mood influence complementing the targeted result of the radiated energy frequency.\n\nDirectly perceivable radiation such as sound or video in some embodiments will be superimposed or overlaid upon the normal multimedia presentation of the wagering game, and may not be directly noticed by the wagering game player. This serves to provide a mood-enhancing effect while not distracting the player from the wagering game at hand.\n\na tactile vibration device is attached in some embodiments to a radiating surface or to a stool or chair to reproduce certain portions of the frequency spectrum, including frequencies that are difficult, expensive, or distracting to radiate through the air via large speaker assemblies. Such assemblies also provide the benefit when attached to a chair or stool of efficiently and directly transferring vibration energy to the wagering game player rather than transmitting energy through the air in the general direction of a wagering game player.\n\nthe wagering game player may realize mental and physical relaxation, lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate, and lower breathing and metabolic rates. This results in a more enjoyable and less stressful gaming experience for the wagering game player, and can result in a wagering game player playing longer and enjoying the gaming experience to a greater degree.\n\nVariation of the frequencies or in the direction or location of energy transmission is employed in some wagering game systems to prevent fatigue, and to address multiple physical, emotional, or physiological areas contributing to the mood of the wagering game player.\n\na range of frequencies is swept through, with further embodiments skipping over certain frequencies believed not to have a beneficial effect.\n\nAnother way in which transmission of energy by the mood enhancement module can be employed to enhance the wagering game player's mood and wagering game experience is to transmit electromagnetic radiation in the vicinity of the wagering game player's head or other parts of the central nervous system, at frequencies believed to influence the neural processes within the wagering game player.\n\nfrequencies below 1 Hz are projected as sound and electromagnetic energy to the wagering game player, as discrete, complex, or modulated frequencies designed to address the mood of the wagering game player.\n\nthe magnetic field around the wagering game player's head, the wagering game player's speech, the wagering game player's skin conductance, or other biometric measurements are taken to employ biofeedback and to alter or control the presentation of energy to the wagering game systems.\n\nYet another method of transmitting energy under the control of a mood enhancement module to enhance the mood of a wagering game player comprises operation of an air ionizer to maintain a desired level of ions per unit of volume in the vicinity of the game player.\n\nthe air is monitored, and the ionization is controlled to produce a level of 2,000 to 4,000 ions per cubic centimeter in the vicinity of the wagering game player.\n\nThis charge level is typical of country air, an when the wagering game player breathes the air it results in enhancement of the wagering game player's mood as if the wagering game player were in the country breathing fresh country air.\n\nthe wagering game system of FIG. 4 is therefore able to improve the gaming experience for wagering game players by presentation of one or more mood enhancing energies via the various components of the mood enhancement module. Because people are capable of distinguishing large-scale and complex patterns, and remember feelings of well-being particularly well, such a system can enhance customer loyalty to those wagering games employing mood enhancement functionality and result in greater market share for the wagering game system manufacturer and a consistently more enjoyable gaming experience for the wagering game player.\n\nFIG. 5 is a flowchart, illustrating a method of practicing one example of the present invention.\n\nthe mood enhancement module detects the wagering game player's characteristics via biofeedback.\n\nBiofeedback includes in various embodiments detection of a variety of physiological characteristics, such as pulse, skin resistance, respiration rate, vocal characteristics, or other such characteristics.\n\nthe wagering game player's mood-affecting characteristics are input via other inputs to the wagering game, such as by selecting from a variety of options on the touchscreen indicating the wagering game player's present mood characteristics.\n\na central server can be employed to store historical data regarding a particular identified player's mood-related history.\n\nthe player's historical data can them be loaded at 502 , and is used to select the frequencies at which energy is provided to the wagering game player.\n\nEnergy is transmitted to the wagering game player in the form of electromagnetic radiation at 503 .\n\nthe energy is at a level below 1 Hz, and is directed toward the player's central nervous system such as toward the wagering game player's brain.\n\nthe low frequency energy provided via the electromagnetic transducer is supplemented by low frequency audio energy provided as beats or difference tones, or is supplemented by a tactile transducer.\n\nthe wagering game system provides energy at a selected frequency via a speaker or a tactile transducer to produce vibration energy.\n\nthe effective frequency of speakers is typically limited from the mid-double digit frequencies to about 20 kHz, frequencies lower than even the audible limit of about 20 Hz can be produced as beats when two or more fundamental tones within the speaker's range are produced.\n\na tactile transducer is employed in some embodiments to vibrate a seating surface such as a chair or stool. In alternate embodiments, the tactile transducer vibrates some other surface in contact with the wagering game player, or vibrates a panel of the wagering game machine to produce low frequency vibrations that are conducted through air to the wagering game player.\n\nlight energy is provided to the wagering game player such as via the display, or via another light source such as a game sign or a secondary or top-box display.\n\nthe frequency is provided in some embodiments by alteration of the refresh rate of the screen, by controlling the movement of an object on the screen, or by modulation of the backlight or other illumination power source for the display.\n\nthe energy is presented such that it is not directly observable by the wagering game player, and so does not distract the player from game play, but is masked by the other video elements such as game play elements.\n\nan air ionizer is employed to maintain air ionization at a desired level, such as that of an outdoor open space. This is estimated to be between 2000-4000 ions per cubic inch of space, or more generally 1000-5000 ions per cubic inch of space.\n\nBiofeedback is again employed at 507 , where the wagering game player's mood-affecting components are again evaluated to determine the wagering game player's physiological state. The process then returns to 503 , and the various frequencies of energy are adjusted based on the physiological or biometric measurements. In a further embodiment, the frequencies of energy presented are also cycled or changed periodically to avoid causing fatigue in the wagering game player.\n\nFIG. 6 shows a configuration of a wagering game system employing a mood enhancement module operable to control a tactile transducer mounted to a seat that is a part of the wagering game system.\n\nthe wagering game system 601 is mounted to a base that is coupled mechanically and via electrical connection to a seat 602 , positioned in front of the wagering game machine in position for a wagering game player to play the wagering game while seated in the seat 602 .\n\nthe seat further comprises one or more speakers 603 , that are operable to play sound at the direction of the wagering game, such as via electrical connection to the wagering game machine's audio system 406 of FIG. 4 .\n\nthe speakers are in one embodiment operable to play sound as part of a surround-sound speaker configuration, and in another embodiment are operable to play frequencies at the direction of the mood enhancement module to provide acoustic energy to the wagering game player seated in the seat 602 .\n\nspeakers are typically limited in low-frequency response to frequencies above 20-50 Hz, depending on the speaker size and configuration, use of multiple higher frequencies can produce beat tones in the sub-20 Hz frequency range.\n\nthe seat also comprises a tactile transducer 604 , coupled to a rigid frame element of the chair.\n\nthe tactile transducer vibrates in response to an electrical signal, and transmits the vibrations through the rigid frame of the chair to the chair and to a wagering game player seated in the chair.\n\nthe tactile transducer is able to directly produce vibration in the sub-20 Hz frequency range that the speakers 403 are often not able to directly produce, and so provide low frequency energy to the wagering game player more effectively than the speakers 603 alone. Because the vibration of the tactile transducer 604 is directly perceivable to the wagering game user's body when in contact with the seat 602 , the tactile transducer also provides a massage effect in some embodiments.\n\nthe example embodiments of a wagering game machine having a mood enhancement module as presented here serve to illustrate how mood enhancement functionality can be employed in a wagering game system to address various elements such as physiological, emotional, and biological states that affect the mood of the wagering game player. By addressing these elements by transmission of energy at selected frequencies to the wagering game player, these elements can be influenced, resulting in a more enjoyable wagering game experience for the wagering game player.\n\nOther biometric feedback methods are presented in other examples, illustrating how biofeedback can be used in a wagering game system to provide a wagering game presentation that a game player finds more interesting and entertaining over a longer period of time.\n\nLandscapes\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nAnimal Behavior & Ethology (AREA)\n\nMedical Informatics (AREA)\n\nSocial Psychology (AREA)\n\nPsychiatry (AREA)\n\nVeterinary Medicine (AREA)\n\nBiophysics (AREA)\n\nPathology (AREA)\n\nBiomedical Technology (AREA)\n\nHeart & Thoracic Surgery (AREA)\n\nPublic Health (AREA)\n\nMolecular Biology (AREA)\n\nSurgery (AREA)\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities (AREA)\n\nChild & Adolescent Psychology (AREA)\n\nPsychology (AREA)\n\nEducational Technology (AREA)\n\nBiodiversity & Conservation Biology (AREA)\n\nHospice & Palliative Care (AREA)\n\nMeasurement Of The Respiration, Hearing Ability, Form, And Blood Characteristics Of Living Organisms (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nA computerized wagering game system includes a gaming module comprising gaming code which is operable when executed on to conduct a wagering game on which monetary value can be wagered, and a biofeedback module operable to track at least one biometric characteristic of a game player.

No. 60/732,756 filed Nov. 2, 2005, which applications are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates generally to computerized wagering game machines, and more specifically to a wagering game machine utilizing biofeedback in varying game play.\n\nLIMITED COPYRIGHT WAIVER\n\nA portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material to which the claim of copyright protection is made. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any person of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office file or records, but reserves all other rights whatsoever. Copyright 2006, WMS Gaming, Inc.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nComputerized wagering games have largely replaced traditional mechanical wagering game machines such as slot machines, and are rapidly being adopted to implement computerized versions of games that are traditionally played live such as poker and blackjack. These computerized games provide many benefits to the game owner and to the gambler, including greater reliability than can be achieved with a mechanical game or human dealer, more variety, sound, and animation in presentation of a game, and a lower overall cost of production and management.\n\nThe elements of computerized wagering game systems are in many ways the same as the elements in the mechanical and table game counterparts in that they must be fair, they must provide sufficient feedback to the game player to make the game fun to play, and they must meet a variety of gaming regulations to ensure that both the machine owner and gamer are honest and fairly treated in implementing the game. Further, they must provide a gaming experience that is at least as attractive as the older mechanical gaming machine experience to the gamer, to ensure success in a competitive gaming market.\n\nComputerized wagering games often do not rely on the dealer to facilitate game play and to provide an entertaining game playing environment, but rely upon the presentation of the game and environment generated by the wagering game machine itself. Incorporation of audio and video features into wagering games to present the wagering game, to provide help, and to enhance the environment presented are therefore important elements in the attractiveness and commercial success of a computerized wagering game system. Music and environmental effects are also played through speakers in some wagering game systems to enhance or complement a theme of the wagering game. These sounds typically accompany video presentation of the wagering game on a screen, which itself often includes animation, video, and three-dimensional graphics as part of presentation of the wagering game.\n\nThe presentation of a wagering game is therefore often a significant factor in attracting a wagering game player to one machine rather than another, and is a key element of the desirability and profitability of a particular wagering game design. High quality game design and engaging themes are priorities in new game development, and presentation of the wagering game is often tailored to ensure that a wagering game player is entertained throughout the gaming experience.\n\nBut, many activities can become fatiguing or seem less interesting as time passes. Even wagering games designed to be engaging can seem less interesting over time, and is difficult to anticipate when a wagering game player will begin to feel bored or fatigued and benefit from a change in game presentation. Simple maintenance of a high level of excitement can hasten fatigue, so better methods of managing game presentation to provide a more enjoyable and engaging wagering game experience are therefore desired.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOne example embodiment of the invention comprises a computerized wagering game system including a gaming module comprising gaming code which is operable when executed on to conduct a wagering game on which monetary value can be wagered, and a biofeedback module operable to track at least one biometric characteristic of a game player. The wagering game is further operable to alter presentation of the wagering game based on changes in the at least one biometric characteristic. In another embodiment, a mood enhancement module is operable to provide energy to a wagering game player at a frequency designed to provide a mood enhancing effect.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\nFIG. 1 shows a computerized wagering game machine, as may be used to practice some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 2 is a flowchart of a method of operating a computerized wagering game machine including altering presentation of the game via biometric tracking, consistent with some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 3 is a diagram of a wagering game system showing various biometric measurement devices, consistent with some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 4 is a block diagram of a computerized wagering game system employing biometric feedback or mood enhancement functionality, consistent with some example embodiments of the invention.\n\nFIG. 5 is a flowchart showing an example method of operating a mood enhancement module in a wagering game system.\n\nFIG. 6 shows a wagering game system comprising a chair having audio and tactile transducers coupled to a mood enhancement module, consistent with an example embodiment of the present invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nIn the following detailed description of example embodiments of the invention, reference is made to specific examples by way of drawings and illustrations. These examples are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and serve to illustrate how the invention may be applied to various purposes or embodiments. Other embodiments of the invention exist and are within the scope of the invention, and logical, mechanical, electrical, and other changes may be made without departing from the subject or scope of the present invention. Features or limitations of various embodiments of the invention described herein, however essential to the example embodiments in which they are incorporated, do not limit the invention as a whole, and any reference to the invention, its elements, operation, and application do not limit the invention as a whole but serve only to define these example embodiments. The following detailed description does not, therefore, limit the scope of the invention, which is defined only by the appended claims.\n\nVarious embodiments of the invention seek to provide wagering game players with a more entertaining and personalized gaming experience by use of biofeedback measurements used to control an aspect of the wagering game presentation. In one example, a computerized wagering game system includes a gaming module comprising gaming code which is operable when executed on to conduct a wagering game on which monetary value can be wagered, and a biofeedback module operable to track at least one biometric characteristic of a game player. The wagering game is further operable to alter presentation of the wagering game based on changes in the at least one biometric characteristic.\n\nIn another example embodiment, the biofeedback module comprises a mood enhancement module that is operable to provide energy to a wagering game player at a frequency designed to provide a mood enhancing effect. The energy is provided in various embodiments through various transducers or other devices, examples of such including an acoustic transducer, an electromagnetic antenna, a video display, and an air ionizer.\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates a computerized wagering game machine, as may be used to practice some embodiments of the present invention. The computerized gaming system shown generally at 100 is a video wagering game system, which displays information for at least one wagering game upon which monetary value can be wagered on video display 101. Video display 101 is in various embodiments a CRT display, a plasma display, an LCD display, a surface conducting electron emitter display, or any other type of display suitable for displaying electronically provided display information. Further embodiments include a top box display 102, operable to display a second game, bonus game, or other video or graphics. Alternate embodiments of the invention will have other game indicators, such as mechanical reels instead of the video graphics reels shown at 103 that comprise a part of a video slot machine wagering game.\n\nA wagering game is implemented using software within the wagering game system, such as through instructions stored on a machine-readable medium such as a hard disk drive or nonvolatile memory. In some further example embodiments, some or all of the software stored in the wagering game machine is encrypted or is verified using a hash algorithm or encryption algorithm to ensure its authenticity and to verify that it has not been altered. For example, in one embodiment the wagering game software is loaded from nonvolatile memory in a compact flash card, and a hash value is calculated or a digital signature is derived to confirm that the data stored on the compact flash card has not been altered. The wagering game implemented via the loaded software takes various forms in different wagering game machines, including such well-known wagering games as reel slots, video poker, blackjack, craps, roulette, or hold 'em games. The wagering game is played and controlled with inputs such as various buttons 104 or via a touchscreen overlay to video screen 101. In some alternate examples, other devices such as a pull arm are used to initiate reel spin in this reel slot machine example, and are employed to provide other input interfaces to the game player.\n\nMonetary value is typically wagered on the outcome of the games, such as with tokens, coins, bills, or cards that hold monetary value. The wagered value is conveyed to the machine through a changer 106 or a secure user identification module interface 107, and winnings are returned via the returned value card or through the coin tray 108. Sound is also provided through speakers 109, typically including audio indicators of game play, such as reel spins, credit bang-ups, and environmental or other sound effects or music to provide entertainment consistent with a theme of the computerized wagering game. In some further embodiments, the wagering game machine is coupled to a network, and is operable to use its network connection to receive wagering game data, track players and monetary value associated with a player, and to perform other such functions.\n\nThe video display 101 and the speakers 109 are used to present the wagering game to the game player, and in some embodiments are replaced or supplemented with other features such as mechanical reels in a mechanical reel slot machine to convey game information and entertain the game player. Many wagering game machines also have themes, such as a game centered around a fishing theme or an old west theme. Various video, graphics, sounds, and animations are often presented consistent with the wagering game theme, and various objects such as static art on the machine or reel symbols are often related to the selected theme. The pace of presentation of the game, the animations, the sound effects, and other elements of wagering game presentation are typically under the control of the wagering game system's software, and can be varied according to the software's instruction.\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, various components of a wagering game presentation are varied dependent on biofeedback data collected from the wagering game player. This enables the wagering game to adapt to the excitement level, mood, or present disposition of the wagering game player, and to make the game presentation more enjoyable for the game player.\n\nFIG. 2 is a flowchart, illustrating an example method of operating a wagering game including changing presentation of the wagering game based on biometric feedback, consistent with an example embodiment of the invention. A wagering game session of play is initiated at 201, which in various embodiments includes depositing monetary value in the wagering game machine such as by depositing tokens, a stored value card, a player identification card, or another such item. The game player then begins game play, and baseline biometric measurements are taken at 202.\n\nThe baseline biometric measurements are used as a temporary estimation of ânormalâ or reference biometric indicators for the wagering game player in this example. In other embodiments, baseline biometric parameters will be stored, such as in a player identification card or in a server such that they can be referenced based on identification of a player at a networked wagering game machine. This enables a baseline to be established over time, and will likely provide more useful baseline biometric data than simply taking a new baseline measurement at the start of each gaming session. The baseline in some such embodiments is a time-averaged biometric measurement, which in some further embodiments includes range information such as a time-averaged standard deviation indicating the normal degree of variability of a particular biometric measurement.\n\nThe system of this example therefore tracks biometric measurement changes over time at 203, and uses the time-based average biometric measurement as a baseline. Changes in biometric measurements are therefore not only observable as changes from a previous biometric measurement, but are comparable against a time-weighted average or other baseline biometric measurement throughout a session of game play, and in some further embodiments are comparable in relative magnitude to typical variation from a baseline parameter through use of a standard deviation metric or other such metric. The change from the biometric average is then used to adjust some parameter of game play at 204, such as to change the pace of play, the pace or pitch of music, or the animations presented to the wagering game player.\n\nFIG. 3 shows a more detailed example of a wagering game system operable to track biometric measurements from a wagering game player, consistent with some embodiments of the invention. The wagering game machine 301 has a touchscreen 302, and various inputs such as a pullarm 303 and buttons 304. The system shown further includes a seat 305, and one or more additional sensors 306, such as a pupil scanner or infrared camera. Biometric sensors, including body temperature monitors, blood pressure monitors, a pulse sensor, or a body movement sensor are incorporated into the player interface devices. For example, a pulse sensor and blood pressure monitor are incorporated here into pullarm 303, such that when the wagering game player pulls the pullarm, biometric measurements are taken and used to adjust presentation of the wagering game. Further, buttons 304 here incorporate various features such as infrared temperature sensors, pulse sensors, or blood pressure sensors for reading a game player's biometric information. The seat 305 includes one or more pressure sensors, which in operation are used to monitor shifting around in the seat during game play.\n\nAdditional sensors such as the pupil scanner or infrared camera can be mounted as shown at 306, and used to monitor the pupil diameter of the game player's eye or monitor the infrared profile of the game player's face. It is anticipated that changes in the game player's interest will be reflected in the biometric measurements taken, such as a higher pulse when the game player is excited or a lower pulse when the game player becomes bored. Similarly, body temperature and blood pressure are expected to be higher when a game player is excited, and lower when the game player is calm. Pupil diameter is known to increase when a person is content or happy, and contracts when the person is upset or nervous. Infrared imaging of a game player's face can reveal information regarding the body temperature and blood flow in the game player, where higher perceived body temperature or blood flow indicate dilated blood vessels and higher levels of excitement in the game player.\n\nCertain other factors can influence some biometric measurements, such as a player who has the flu or is drunk. Such players may have elevated body temperatures and dilated blood vessels, but have relatively low pulses and blood pressure. Some embodiments of the invention will therefore consider various combinations of biometric parameters, and in still further embodiments can be used to detect unusual or unsafe conditions such as illness or intoxication in game players. Because monitoring or tracking such parameters related to potential medical or physical condition may be considered confidential or an intrusion into the privacy of the game player by some wagering game players, such information may be limited in the way it is used, such as by being provided only to security personnel for purposes of monitoring the game player while in the gaming facility to ensure the game player's health and safety or for notifying the wait staff that a player may be intoxicated and should not be served any further alcohol.\n\nIn a further embodiment, biometric measurements that can indicate identity, such as infrared face scans or pupil/retina scans, can be used to identify a particular game player. This enables the wagering game system to perform a variety of functions based on establishing the identity of a player, from eliminating the need for tracking cards to enhancing security. For example, a player having a certain number of credits or dollars in his account can simply sit at a wagering game machine and have his identity confirmed through the biometric measurements, eliminating the need to carry or protect a player tracking or player value card. In a further embodiment, additional information such as a pin number will be required as a second form of protection for the player's account, ensuring the security and accuracy of the biometric identification.\n\nIdentifying a game player using biometric identifiers can also be used to identify known cheats, such as those who have previously had their biometric baseline data measured and stored while playing, or who have simply been photographed or are otherwise recognizable to the wagering game machine, but who have since been banned or restricted from playing wagering games in a particular gaming establishment. This functionality greatly enhances the gaming facility's ability to monitor the premises for known cheats, due to both the relatively low cost of incorporating such functionality into machines and the relatively high cost of paying additional security people who may be more easily fooled or distracted to monitor the gaming establishment. Incorporation of this feature into a large percentage of wagering game systems in a gaming establishment therefore makes it significantly less likely that a known cheat will be able to play a wagering game machine undetected in a gaming establishment equipped with biometric sensing and tracking systems such as those described here.\n\nFIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a wagering game system having a variety of interfaces to a wagering game player, as may be used to practice some embodiments of the invention. A processor 401 is coupled to a computer bus 402, linking the processor to other components such as memory 403 and nonvolatile storage 404. The nonvolatile storage is shown here as a hard disk drive, but in other embodiments is nonvolatile or flash memory, or another suitable nonvolatile storage device. A touchscreen video display 405 and a speaker 406 are coupled for presentation of video and sound to the wagering game player, and button 407 serves as an additional means of player input into the wagering game machine. Additional sensors such as a camera are also incorporated in various embodiments, as shown at 408.\n\nIn operation, the processor 401 executes software instructions loaded into memory 403 from nonvolatile storage 404, and controls the other peripheral devices such as the touchscreen display 405 and the speaker 406 at the direction of the software instructions. The software is further operable to receive notice and react to user inputs, such as actuation of the touchscreen 405 or the buttons 407. The wagering game in various embodiments is also operable to receive biometric information from wagering game players, as detected by sensors such as a pulse sensor, a blood pressure sensor, a body temperature sensor, an infrared camera 408, a pupil scanner 408, or a body movement sensor. Many of these sensors can be built into user interface components such as the button 407 or incorporated as a separate information gathering device as shown at 408, and can be used to measure and track various biometric characteristics of a wagering game player during sessions of game play.\n\nThe various biometric sensors in this example embodiment are also coupled to the bus 402, enabling the processor and wagering game code to respond to detected biometric data based on the content of the biometric data and the program instructions. The software is thereby able to make various changes in presentation of the wagering game, such as increasing or decreasing the pace or pitch of music, animation, or another aspect of the game presentation, or cutting off play for an obviously intoxicated player.\n\nConsider as an example a theme-based wagering game using a fishing theme with a presentation that varies according to biometric feedback. Reel symbols include fish, bobbers, boats, fishing rods, and other fishing-related items, and are displayed as graphic elements on reels rendered via a touchscreen display. Background animation includes a fisher in a boat on a lake, along with frogs, rippling waves, jumping fish, and other animated objects. Background sounds accompany the frogs, jumping fish, waves, motorized movement of the boat, casting a fishing rod, and other such sounds. Various events or animations such as the boat moving positions on the lake, or the fisher casting the line out again are presented between reel spins, along with other animations including accumulation of fish in qualification for a bonus event.\n\nAny of these events can be varied in pace or in frequency, and the sounds accompanying them can be changed in pitch, volume, in complexity, or in other characteristics to either make presentation of the wagering game more exciting or less exciting. These changes to the presentation of a wagering game are therefore based on biometric measurement readings in various embodiments of the invention so that the wagering game system is able to maintain player interest and excitement in playing the presented game. In this example, the fishing environment may include more elements such as frogs, jumping fish, and seagull noises when the player's biometric characteristics suggest boredom or fatigue, and the same elements may be scaled back when the player is already excited.\n\nVariation of the frequency or energy presented to a wagering game player is used in a further example to enhance the wagering game player's mood or other physical response, through a mood enhancing module. The mood enhancing module is in various embodiments designed to enhance the mood, physical well-being, psychological state, or other such mood-related state of the wagering game player.\n\nIn one such embodiment, the wagering game system records the player's voice, and analyzes its spectral content. The mood enhancement module plays missing frequencies through a speaker 406, using a bioacoustic feedback system which is employed to provide frequencies designed to supplement those of the wagering game player's voice. The use of voice-supplementing frequencies is believed in some applications to heighten awareness, to promote a feeling of relaxation, and to cause other feelings of well-being\n\nIn some further embodiments, records of a particular wagering game player's voice are recorded or the spectral content is stored, so that the spectral content and relationship between spectral components in a wagering game player's voice can be stored and re-used. The data in embodiments where a network is available is stored in some embodiments in a network server, so that a user identification card or other identifier can be used on a variety of wagering game machines within a single establishment or across networked establishments and still benefit from the stored voice data.\n\nIn another embodiment, audible or visible beats or oscillations are presented to the wagering game player, such as through the speaker 406 or the touchscreen video display 405. The frequencies are produced as beats when they are formed as the difference between two or more fundamental tones, although frequencies can be produced by sums, products, differences, or other mathematical functions of root tones in further embodiments. In one example, a speaker such as speaker 406 that is unable to produce frequencies below 20 Hz as a pure tone due to its limited frequency response is able to produce higher frequencies "
