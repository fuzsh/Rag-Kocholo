        "text": "Advertisement\n\nRemove\n\nThank you for reading my story so far it's great you've chosen to waste 6000 words of your time on my rough shabby work, for having gotten your attention with what I've done so far I hope you'll find and point out ways to polish up what's been done and turn it into a gem together with me.\n\nEntering my soul well my body rests I was immediately confronted with a shocking change, my chi had now taken the form of a small island with a completely un-proportional mountain in the center.\n\nThe most surprising thing however was the large log cabin built on the solid ground, flying over I landed on the sandy beach and slowly walked over.\n\nMoving aside the curtains in the window hole sitting down at a wooden table was a little girl completely ablaze, seeing her I could only thing 'Emily?'\n\n'Yes master, it's good to see you'\n\nPicking my jaw up off the ground I walked over to the front door and entered the building, inside was rather simple just a log building with plain decorations.\n\nThe only concerning thing about it was what it was made of! Unlike both mana and chi this energy was completely unique, pressing my hands against it I could even feel a pulse like blood flow.\n\nWalking into the kitchen like room Emily was the first to speak, \"You have so many questions, you should relax a little before you hurt my head from the information intake.\"\n\n\"To start with take a seat it seems I'll be explaining quite a bit, how about starting with your chi?\" Now she'd really piqued my interest.\n\n\"What happened to my chi!\"\n\n\"I reformed it\" Such a quick emotionless answer that explains nothing!\n\n\"Why did you reform it? How exactly could you control my chi?\" This time I'll be a little more persistent for answers.\n\n\"If I'm going to live here I need a place to stay besides floating in the sky, unlike you my real body is here not just my mind.\" I've got to give it to her this helps a lot, only stopping for a breath she quickly continued.\n\n\" \"Your\" chi has yet to been made your own, you've simple absorbed it from your new body and brought it into your soul.\" Didn’t Reliam's bond give me the chi I currently have?\n\n\"No master my father did not give you any of his power through the bond you've simple absorbed the chi crystal within the new body he sent you to, on that note why have you not absorbed the mana crystal?\"\n\nChi crystal? Mana crystal? What exactly is she talking about? \"Beings in your world are not usually born with them so it's understandable you don’t know.\"\n\n\"Magical beasts are born with these crystals and absorb their power from birth through their body, other animals can slowly develop them over time\"\n\n\"Humans on the other hand must first dive into their own soul and pull the power into it to be harnessed, humanoids are far more complicated than animals but have far greater benefits.\"\n\nSo that finally explains her own question..\n\n\"What's this house?\" Giving me a knowing smile like she'd already guessed what I'd ask next Emily slowly began to solidify her female form, making herself look almost exactly like me with red skin.\n\nSuppressing my curiosity I stayed silent waiting for more answers to come, giving me a thankful look Emily once again started explaining.\n\n\"It's made from my own natural energy master, natural energy takes the form of plants and eventually animals within your soul.\" Natural energy? No wonder it felt completely different from mana and chi!\n\n\"Truthfully master I find it shocking you're only on the path to becoming a saint, with that you won't even be able to fly without the use of your wings!\"\n\nPath to becoming a saint? As far as I know Saints are able to walk on water and magma without harm, and angels are able to freely walk on top of the air itself.\n\n\"Training mana and chi to their peak will only let you become a ninth level saint!\" What! I thought one could become immortal with mana alone! Why did master never say any of this!\n\n\"To become a first level angel you'd have to learn to absorb sufficient natural, spirit, physic, or soul energy mastering all of them would let you become a ninth level lesser god.\"\n\nOnly at the level of a lesser god? How on earth would on become an actual God?\n\nThrough talking for the rest of the night I was finally told what few ever actually learn, the way to become a god is to fuse all six of these pure energies together into one.\n\nThen once all six are fully fused one would be a ninth level Sovereign God, once there if one still had the talent and ability to proceed further they could challenge existence itself to become a Primeval.\n\nEven most magical beasts wouldn’t know most of this information, thankfully master summoned both a blue dragon and a blue phoenix as Emily's parents!\n\nI'm not going to try to guess as to how she got them to procreate but I won't complain about it, like in a flames temperature blue and violet are symbols of intense highly concentrated energy.\n\nEmily herself trains in soul, natural, and mana on the path to become an angel herself, later on as she grows naturally she'll begin to understand spirit and physic energy purely due to her own race.\n\nThe only Primeval to ever exist created the first gods who in turn created the different races, having liked some beings the primeval Void himself granted them greater power.\n\nGiving all being the ability to become gods through training he continuously released his own power into the atmosphere creating the different energies, the world already having been altered from the gods powers was impure forcing those who trained to expel these impurities from the primeval pure energy.\n\nOne race in particular was so liked by the primeval he saved them from extinction and altered their very being making the fifty survivors into a new race, the voidian race itself.\n\nWith pure blue hair, eyes, and even skin these men and women were extremely powerful, it's passed down that they can only be harmed by someone more skilled than them at their own weapons or magic.\n\nIf you had the ability to kill one voidian through weaponry you'd not be able to kill another unless you matched their magic, if one used a sword another would use an axe, the next a scythe.\n\nSadly this was about all she'd known the rest she should've learnt from her parents but unfortunately she was separated from them within a week of her birth after receiving some training by Jade.\n\nIn the end we only stopped talking with each other once the ground started to tremble, I was being woken up to go to school.\n\nLeaving my soul I was greeted by my father's smiling face this would be the third time I've seen such a big smile on his face the first was when I showed my chi, the second was my fifth birthday when I looked forward to his training.\n\nLooking around the sun had yet to rise, thinking about it my father was away on business the last little while.\n\nHolding his finger up to his mouth he helped me out of bed helping me change into clean underwear and a skirt and blouse.\n\nThe feeling of the fabric is a lot rougher than my usual clothes feeling more like a hide, looking down the clothes appeared to be made out of an animal skin.\n\nNot as comfortable as my usual silk clothes I wasn’t one to complain since I really just wanted to complain about the girls clothes to begin with..\n\nAfter dressing me he quickly grabbed my sword off the desk chair and held my hand with his free one leading me outside, exiting my room we quietly made our way down the stairs and into the yard.\n\nOnce outside my father finally let out a sigh of relief obviously he was worried about waking up mom and Sam, I was beginning to wonder if they even knew he was home.\n\n\"Watch me and repeat once I stop, do it once and I'll give you some pointers than you'll try again\" So he's going to teach me sword moves? Or are we just going to stand and swing the sword one thousand times?\n\nIn the end I sat down on the grass letting the drew soak into my semi-waterproof skirt, apparently it was sword moves.\n\nRaising his sword he dashed forwards three steps and let lose a powerful slash causing the air itself to become a blade with strength alone, he can't expect that of me can he?\n\nQuickly backing off a step he raised his sword as though to guard against an illusionary opponent, next he counter attacked cleanly slicing where the neck would be judging by how he was blocking.\n\nEncouraging me to stand up I slowly walked over to where he'd started earlier well drawing my rapier, the second the sword was out I looked up and saw a hooded man standing beside the trees two meters away.\n\nHaving drawn his sword his leg muscles tensed up as he prepared to charge me, moving faster than I could even register he appeared before me cleanly slicing my throat.\n\nIn the next instant he disappeared fading into nothing more than a wisp of smoke, having fallen down I looked over to my father well sitting on the grass.\n\nHe quickly explained it was an illusion created by his chi in the end he congratulated me for not trying to run the moment I saw my opponent, I quickly asked to try again.\n\nFrom what I observed last time the chi illusion should only be at the first intermediate level although I'm lacking I can still win, although only because the keys to victory were handed over at the beginning.\n\nThis book's true home is on another platform. Check it out there for the real experience.\n\nThe only chance I had was a slim window relying purely on how well I can control my own body, drawing my blade the opponent appeared.\n\nRushing in three steps I swung my blade only to have it blocked by my opponent, without stopping to think I moved my sword to the defensive position my father took earlier.\n\nCrashing down on my with explosive force I realized the reason my father had stood like this letting him absorb the blow with his entire body channeling most of the force into the ground.\n\nNext without pausing I swung my blade at his neck with his stance destroyed he shouldn’t be able to block even with the gap in ability, my father had only fought with about my level of strength the first time around or else he would have taken more than three steps.\n\nSurprisingly enough the illusion blocked most likely my father changed it having seen what I'd just done by copying his movements, or he was testing what I'd do if I didn’t succeed.\n\nBacking off once again I took up a defensive stance I remember from spying on the soldiers training, this caused a look of surprise to appear on my father's face but he quickly suppressed it.\n\nAs I'd been raising my sword the illusion closed in on me forcing me to once again block, this time it was a horizontal slash.\n\nWithout time to dodge I raised my sword to the side meeting his sword with the flat of my blade, even with one hand on the hilt and another pressing against the top of the blade my sword was pushed back.\n\nIn the next instant my opponent struck again this time stabbing directly into my stomach causing me to once again fall to the ground defeated.\n\nLooking over at my father he had a happy look on his face, walking over he crouched down and wrapped his arms around my in a big hug like my mother usually does.\n\nHe said even for having not been born with chi my abilities were amazing, generous even no doubt I would be able to surpass my peers in the next hundred years.\n\nAfter that he spent the next few hours teaching me sword moves, each time I would perfectly copy his movements and he would give me pointers on how to do it even better than his ability allowed.\n\nAfter he was done teaching me the beginner and intermediate skills his sword school had to offer he called me a natural, a gifted fighter capable of learning at a single glance.\n\nI was more or less someone who practiced precision motor control since a young age with an exceptional memory, having seen my father do it I simple needed to calculate the angle to stand.\n\nHave each leg at what angle my feet spaced how far to the side and forwards, the optimal spacing for each step to take for anyone could theoretically do it only it would take longer.\n\nBy now the sun had begun to rise in the sky greeted by a beautiful sunrise we made our way back inside, opening the door we could immediately smell Sam's fresh cooking.\n\n\"Welcome home master, good morning young miss I'm glad you seem to be better\" At first she was talking with a smile but at the end she turned towards my father with a glare, no doubt due to him having taken me outside for training.\n\nFor breakfast today was eggs and bacon my portion and fathers were already prepared well Sam was still making mothers, halfway through my breakfast she came down and gave father a kiss.\n\nLooking me over up and down she raised an eyebrow at my father but let it go unsaid, obviously she was a tactful woman and most likely guessed Sam wouldn't let it go so easily.\n\nAfter I finished I went upstairs with Sam to be undressed from my new clothes and given a quick wash to remove the perspiration from my body, afterwards I was once again dressed this time in a more silky cloth like normal.\n\nWalking down stairs in a light blue ankle length skirt and long sleeve shirt I was met with my mother, Sam on the other hand returned to the kitchen to begin making her own breakfast and do the dishes.\n\nLeaving the house through the front door for the first time I was greeted with the sight of a stone path leading towards the village, walking into further into the village we arrived at one of the few four bedroom houses in the center of the village.\n\nWalking up to the door Aura quickly knocked went through her greetings and began to introduce me, sadly I'm her daughter Azura Grace.\n\nWhy can't I be her son Azure Grace? It'd be so much easier if I was a boy, girls in this world don’t even wear pants what's with this old fashioned way of thinking! Even female warriors still wear skirts all the time, my mother demonstrated flight magic to me once in a skirt.\n\nWalking into the classroom I was introduced as being sick the last few weeks, standing in from of the class I did a customary.\n\n\"Hello my name is Azura Grace it's nice to meet you all\" with that began the rest of the introductions, they knew each other but I didn’t know them.\n\nStarting with the teacher there was Mrs. Prima, Selena, Kyle, and Anthony with my attendance we now had an equal number of male to female students.\n\nMrs. Prima had a tall athletic appearance although on the male scale she'd only be a seven she was still beautiful, with her white hair and cheerful smile she gave off a kind feeling.\n\nSelena was a little taller than me making me the shortest in the class, her main feature was the one curved horn coming out from the center of her forehead.\n\nWith her bright green eyes and light brown hair she'd defiantly grow up to be no less of a beauty than Mrs. Prima, of course I sadly can't get the childhood friend story I could if born as a boy!\n\nKyle's the tallest and also the oldest by a two months, he was relatively skinny but because of that you could see the dense muscle beneath his skin no doubt also a mage like me.\n\nAlthough Kyle's demonic features are hidden his ears are pointed and underneath his cloths and hair are multiple demonic markings typical for his ink-demon race.\n\nAnthony was muscular defiantly a mesomorph body type, already showing signs of heavy definition he had the same horn as Selena.\n\nWithout even having to ask just by how they stood next to one another and the similarities other than the horn you could tell Anthony and Selena were siblings.\n\nHaving come to class late I'd already missed over ten days of class, the semester started on my birthday in the winter months it's preferable to keep children inside learning.\n\nAfter introduction I was brought over to a black monolith like object, with an open slot and a magic circle beside it.\n\n\"Azura since you're the only one who doesn’t have one let's start off with getting you an affinity card\" Affinity card? Elemental affinity?\n\nPoping into my head Emily felt the need to explain for me affinities are most commonly elemental, and elemental affinities are the only ones where you can have multiple.\n\nAn affinity for mana, or chi however you could only have one usually someone would have at least seven affinities.\n\nMana, Fire, Fire, Earth, Earth, Air, Air would be considered extremely lucky giving you the affinity for three fire, three earth, three air, and one of each other element.\n\nChi, Fire, Fire, Earth, Earth, Air, Air would be viewed as the same thing only for physical techniques, mana is an extremely wanted affinity.\n\nEarth, Earth, Earth, Air, Air, Air, Fire would be a far more common type of affinity, pressing my hand against the magic circle on the monolith I couldn’t wait for my affinity card.\n\nComing out it read simply Name: Azura Grace, Race: Demonic Fairy, Affinity: ____, Energy, Life, Mana, Air.\n\nLooking at this I was questioning the blank attribute well Prima was quite shocked, I'd gotten the Mana and Life attributes.\n\nEven through my Air magic only equaled two affinities I'd be able to learn magic of all elements, the blank and Life attributes on the other hand her questioning as well.\n\nThe rest of the class looked at me with pity, Anthony had a Chi attribute like my Mana attribute however he also had elemental affinities to strengthen it.\n\nIn my past live my magic was on par with all others, surpassing them with my powerful air techniques.\n\nMaybe in my world the mana affinity is common but we have less affinities in return?\n\nLooking around my teacher seemed to be waiting for something, feeling around inside my body I felt as though most of my mana had been drained.\n\nLosing the ability to stand Anthony ended up being the one who caught me, if we have trust exercises can he be my partner?\n\nTrying not to pass out I slowly began to draw in mana from the air, doing this instead of having to wait for my mana to replenish itself I could instead just increase my overall mana slightly.\n\nChapter 4: Unabsorbed Power\n\nA special shout out to\n\nZerlestes for asking for a non-op young character,\n\nsad860 for asking me to keep it more original and interesting,\n\nand last but not least Oblivion 0117 for a non nerfed character.\n\nJust wondering if I've been able to keep it decent for you all."
