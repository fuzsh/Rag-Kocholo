        "text": "How do I get my own Dino?\n\nFor Newbies, the best option is to Claim your Newbie Egg, and/or adopt a dino at the Adoption Center!\n\nThere are several other ways to get a dino too, open to new and current players alike!\n\nTrading for/Purchasing from Another Member\n\nSelling & Trading dinos is extremely common and is open to anyone regardless of account age! The best way is to go through our Discord and into the #selling-and-trading or #looking-for channels, but you can also make a post on DeviantArt to submit into the group gallery!\n\nBreeding\n\nYou can combine two dinosaurs together and receive a clutch of offspring with a mix of the parent’s traits! Breeding can be as simple or complex as you want it, but there are a few guidelines:\n\nYou must have a Slot to each parent - Slots are essentially breeding permissions, which allows you to breed that dinosaur once per slot. Slots are often traded and sold, so you can breed two dinos you don’t own, and keep the offspring!\n\nBoth parents must be the same species\n\nBoth parents must be Adults - Primeval Age characters have special age-up quests they must complete before being allowed to breed. Adult dinos have completed these quests, younger dinos have not\n\n​If you have all the above requirements, then you’ll just need to craft a nest & create a Courtship image!\n\nSemi-Custom Sales\n\nOccasionally the group will have semi-custom sales. These are basically make-your-own, allowing you to choose the species, markings, and base colors of your character!\n\nThere is no set schedule for sales, but they’ve historically happened on a yearly basis - sales are announced well in advance so you can prepare\n\nYou are also allowed to use your Primeval Age dinosaur outside of the group! The official import image can only be uploaded to character galleries (such as Toyhouse) and must be credited, but otherwise you can use them as any other OC outside the group if you desire! ​\n\nUpload your Geno to the Site\n\n​\n\nSince we recently moved to the site, some Genos are still on DeviantArt. You will need to have it migrated to the site in order to use it!\n\n​\n\n​To do this you simply go to User > My Claims, and submit a claim with a link to the geno. Only one geno per claim, so if your link leads to several, please specify which!\n\nIt will then be uploaded by a mod to your account! If you have an import that needs to be moved to the site, you can also submit a claim for that! Just make sure the image has a transparent background, and that the credits remain\n\nGenos vs Imports\n\n​\n\nGeno and Import are common terms you’ll hear in most ARPGs - they can seem confusing at first but they’re simple to understand once you break em down!\n\nGenos\n\nA geno is the “blueprint” of your character. This denotes the species, covering, base color, and the markings you are allowed to use for that specific character - think of it as a limited MYO slot.\n\nAn example geno is:\n\nrgb(163,132,124) Do / Fd / Bn\n\nThe rgb is the base color of the dinosaur! If you have an old geno from DeviantArt, it might have a color written out next to the genes - this color is the base color, and has no affect on the marking colors! Markings use their own color guidelines separate from the base color!\n\nThe letters are the markings - all markings have their own individual “code” that is present. So \"Do\" here means the Dorsal marking\n\nEvery marking has two possible forms: Het or Hom - this denotes the different ranges the marking is allowed to present in, and sometimes differences in how they can be colored.\n\nHet Markings will always be two letters, one uppercase one lower case [Xx]\n\nHom Markings will always be all uppercase [XXXX]\n\nImports\n\nAn import is the approved, finished design of a geno. Imports are the playable characters that you can use in the game activities\n\n​Every import base can be found here - if your dino is Standard variant, you will click on the first image to download the base, it contains both the Standard Bald and Feathered bases!\n\nDesigning your Geno!\n\n​\n\nGo to each marking's info page from the Marking Ranges page to see its rules - make sure to read them carefully and take note of things like edge types and colors!\n\nSpeaking of - marking colors are largely up to you! Marking colors are not based on the base color, but on their own individual marking rules! For most markings, you can choose any color you want as long as its within the saturation limits!\n\n​A full color guide can be found here\n\nIn addition to colors, there are other factors such as gums, feathers, keratin, eyes, and dimorphs!\n\nGums must be natural in color and not go beyond the above swatch's saturation\n\nFeathered dinos will have their geno's rgb on the feathers, and you can choose a slightly darker/lighter color for the skin!\n\nHorns and keratin must be a natural color based on the base and/or markings touching the area\n\nEyes can be any color with a few exceptions - cannot be darker than the lineart, nor glowing, nor two-toned.\n\nMale dinos also get a special extra Dimorphic marking; this is a special marking that is passed down from the father & grandfather's dimorphic\n\n​See the links below for the full guides on each!\n\nSubmitting Your Design\n\n​\n\nStep-by-step to submit your design on the site! Be sure to also review the design submission checklist !\n\nSave your design as a transparent PNG at the same resolution as the file you downloaded, with a transparent background & the credits still in place.\n\n​Backgrounds are automatically added by the site, so make sure its removed from your image!\n\nOnce your design is ready to submit, you will hit the ‘Submit Design’ button on the geno’s site page.\n\nFrom there, you will click Create Request, which will bring you to the design request page. Here you'll need to go through each of the tabs (Comments, Masterlist Image, Add-Ons, and Adjustments) and add any needed info & hit save. You'll know a tab is good to go when it has a green circle on it!\n\nIn the comments box you can provide links to making breakdowns, \"other sides\" for asymmetrical designs, or any other comments for the approving mods to consider when checking the design!\n\nFor the Masterlist Image, this is where you upload the import file with the transparent bg. You will also use the cropping tool on the page to create your imports thumbnail!\n\nAddOns is where you'll attach any items such as min marks, or geno editors\n\nAdjustments are if any items you added changed something like the dimorph color. In most cases you'll just leave this page as-is\n\nOn the Status Tab you can then hit \"Submit Request\" to submit your design! When a mod checks it, if any edits are needed you will get the request sent back to you as a draft so you can upload a corrected import image.\n\nAnd you're done! If there are any corrections needed, you will get a notification in your inbox and the design will be sent back as a 'Draft' that you can edit and resubmit. Once it's approved & made into an import it'll be added to your page!\n\nArt by Slugg-o"
