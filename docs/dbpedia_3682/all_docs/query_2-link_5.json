        "text": "This is a list of episodes for the British television drama series Primeval. It premiered on ITV on 10 February 2007 and ran for five series and 36 episodes in total. It was cancelled in June 2009 after the third series, with the network stating it was struggling to fund any more original programming. On 29 September 2009, the station announced it had formed a deal with the digital channels Watch, BBC America, and German broadcaster Pro7, to recommission the programme for the fourth and fifth series. Series 5 of six episodes began on 24 May 2011 on digital channel Watch[1] and was repeated on ITV from 16 June 2012.[2][3]\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first series revolves around \"the team\" forming, following several creature attacks in the Forest of Dean, as well as Nick Cutter's search for Helen Cutter, his missing wife, who had suddenly reappeared after eight years. Throughout the series, Nick becomes romantically involved with James Lester's PA, Claudia Brown. In the first series' finale Cutter travels through a time anomaly, and upon his return he discovers that Claudia Brown no longer exists, and the timeline has changed. In Series 2, Cutter adjusts to the new timeline while hunting for a traitor in the group. It marks the last appearance of the character Stephen Hart, who dies at the end of the series. In the third series, Cutter is killed, while Jason Flemyng joins the cast as Police Officer Danny Quinn. Ben Mansfield also joins as Captain Becker, the team's armed support, replacing Stephen Hart. The climax has Connor, Abby, and Quinn pursuing Helen through anomalies to prevent her exterminating the human ancestors. They succeed, Helen is killed, but they remain trapped in past eras.\n\nA year later, both in real and series time, Series 4 began (introduced by a webisode prologue) with Lester now reporting to an industrialist, Philip Burton, who has secret plans to use anomalies, and with a new team leader, Matt Anderson. Abby, and Connor return and have to win back their places on the team.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries 1 (2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Primeval (series 1)\n\nNo.\n\noverallEpisodeDirected byWritten byOriginal air dateUK viewers\n\n(millions) [4]1Leapin' LizardsCilla WareAdrian Hodges10 February 2007 ( )7.09\n\nA sighting of a strange creature occurs on the outskirts of the Forest of Dean, leading a small team of scientists and government officials to investigate it.

However, they return to find Helen and her Cleaner Replica troops (including a clone of Cutter) have taken over the ARC, so they can interrogate the real Cutter about the artifact.

Meanwhile, Philip introduces Connor to Prospero's \"New Dawn\" which will extract energy from the anomalies and stop the world's energy crisis. Philip also assigns Connor an assistant, April Leonard (Janice Byrne), to keep an eye on him. Connor makes a late appearance and joins the team in tracking down the giant burrowing insect after Abby tells him that people are starting to notice his absence in the field, and is himself captured, and dragged to its nest in a shopping centre under construction, later to be rescued by Matt by means of explosives.

With a young but dangerous theropod dinosaur aboard the submarine, the ARC team then work alongside its naval counterparts to restore power and return through the anomaly before it closes or before they are attacked by an oncoming pod of Liopleurodon. Back at the ARC, Lester and Jess have a battle of their own as they try and dissuade an admiral from nuking the anomaly. At the end of the episode Abby reveals to Matt what happened to Emily after she returned to the 19th century.\n\nAn anomaly alert brings the team to the Gaiety Theatre where they encounter a raptor. The team send the creature through an anomaly which transpires to lead to Victorian London. Matt follows the raptor through to prevent it killing anyone. Matt tracks down the raptor but finds Emily who is doing the same. The pair then find themselves accused of being the mysterious Spring-heeled Jack, killing several people actually killed by the raptor. Matt and Emily eventually stun the raptor and send it back. Matt reveals to Emily that her husband plans to have her confined in a madhouse and the pair head back to the present, being followed through the anomaly by her husband, Henry, who holds Matt at gunpoint. The raptor awakes and kills Henry. Back at the ARC, Abby breaks into Connor's laboratory and copies the information on his computer, however Connor catches her.

The team come to close it, but are ordered out of the laboratory by Philip who heads to \"New Dawn\" to collect data from the device. Connor tells Abby the purpose of the anomaly. Back at the ARC, a swarm of future beetles and their enormous queen come through the anomaly and kill a guard before spreading throughout the building after chewing through reinforced concrete. The ARC goes into lockdown trapping Matt, Connor, Abby, Becker, Emily and Jess inside and they are forced to fight for survival. Jess is bitten by one of the beetles and has a reaction to the bite, slipping into unconsciousness while the team's initial plan to poison the creatures fails. Connor says he can trigger a gamma ray burst from his anomaly but Matt has already disabled the computer control. Matt is forced to reveal that he and Abby have a copy of the data on Connor's computer and they then use it to sterilise the ARC while they take cover in a panic room.

Abby and Connor join them while Becker, Lester, and Jess deal with the ongoing creature threat. After a fight with Abby, April is killed by a swarm of Anurognathus. Philip's device goes online and manages to seal the other anomalies by incorporating their energy into one large anomaly at the centre of the device, but Matt is certain that this is the beginning of the end. With time running out, Connor attempts to sabotage the machine at \"New Dawn\" but ends up being pulled through the giant anomaly to an unknown location.\n\n36The End of the Future: Part 2Cilla WareSteve Bailie & Adrian Hodges28 June 2011 ( )[20]0.496[19]\n\nAfter failing to stop Philip and having been pulled through the \"New Dawn\" anomaly, Connor finds himself in a barren wasteland where future predators are the only obvious life. At \"New Dawn\", Matt and Abby go through the anomaly to rescue Connor. In the future, Matt, Connor and Abby take shelter in an underground bunker as a vicious storm rages on the surface while back at the ARC, Connor's original anomaly reopens. The anomaly at \"New Dawn\" starts to cause atmospheric changes to the planet and as chaos breaks loose, Philip realizes Helen Cutter has been using him to achieve her goal of destroying humanity. Matt, Connor and Abby are able to fight off Future Predators and make it back to the present. With their help Philip is able to gain control of \"New Dawn\" once more and Philip decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the installation with the hope that the anomaly will close. \"New Dawn\" is destroyed but the giant anomaly continues to grow. Back at the ARC several Future Predators come through Connor's anomaly, leaving Lester and Jess to hunt the beasts alone until the team returns. At the ARC the team join forces to defeat the Future Predators and Connor comes up with a plan to merge his miniature anomaly with the giant one and hopefully close them both. Using a containment device, the team are able to take the miniature anomaly to the \"New Dawn\" site where Matt drives it into the giant anomaly causing them to implode. Matt survives and the team are reunited and return to duties at the ARC. With everything seemingly back to normal and Connor and Abby going to get married, a new anomaly is detected and as the team head out to the field, Matt comes face to face with a battered version of himself who says: \"You have to go back\".\n\nFinal appearance of: Matt Anderson (Ciarán McMenamin), Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts), Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt), Captain Hilary Becker (Ben Mansfield), Jess Parker (Ruth Kearney), Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig), James Lester (Ben Miller) and Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley).\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
