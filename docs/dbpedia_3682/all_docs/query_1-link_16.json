        "text": "Many biblical scholars who interpret the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 as yielding a continuous chronology from Adam to Abraham claim the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) preserves the original begetting ages for the patriarchs. The MT's total for this period is 2008 years. The Samaritan Pentateuch (SP) presents markedly different chronological data for each epoch, for a grand total of 2249 years. Calculations derived from the primary manuscripts (MSS) of the Greek Septuagint (LXX) yield a chronology of 3394 years for this period, 1386 years greater than the MT. The MT is classically represented by the Ussher chronology, which places creation at 4004 BC and the Flood at 2348 BC. Figures from the LXX place creation at ca. 5554 BC and the Flood at ca. 3298 BC (Table 1; Appendix, n. 1). This paper proposes that the LXX preserves (most of) the original numbers in Genesis 5 and 11. Most of the MT's chronology in Genesis 5 and 11 does not represent the original text, and is the result of a deliberate and systematic post–AD 70 corruption. Corroborating external witnesses, internal and external evidence, text critical and LXX studies, and historical testimonies will be presented, along with arguments rebutting LXX inflation hypotheses. Explanations for important, accidental scribal errors will be discussed, and a text critical reconstruction of Genesis 5 and 11 will be proposed.\n\nThe goal of this article is to update the ABR community of supporters and other interested readers on the present state of the Genesis 5 and 11 Research Project. The project officially began in 2016 (with its unofficial roots extending back to 2010). The research has produced substantial fruit, and as a result, ABR is pleased to announce plans to publish our first book, tentatively titled, \"From Adam to Abraham: The Case for the Septuagint’s Chronology in Genesis 5 and 11.\" This update will survey the goals of the project, describe new developments and the present direction of our research, answer some questions we have received about Genesis 5 and 11 from supporters, and briefly outline plans for publication(s). Read the rest of this paper here: http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2017/04/26/From-Adam-to-Abraham-An-Update-on-the-Genesis-5-and-11-Research-Project.aspx\n\nThis article discusses the composition of Gen 5, its possible literary growth and its relationship to Gen 2–4 within the larger composition of the Primeval History. Several possible explanations for the relationship between Gen 5 and Gen 2–4 are considered: documentary hypotheses, supplementary hypotheses and Blum’s Priestly composition. Taking both synchronic and diachronic aspects into account, this study argues that Gen 5 should be seen as both an elaboration on and an addition to Gen 2–4. It is concluded that, from the perspective of Gen 5, Blum’s hypothesis provides the best explanation for the formation of the Primeval History. See the url above,\n\nWe tend to take for granted the ages of the pre-Abrahamic patriarchs given in mainstream translations of the Bible. These ages are based on the Hebrew text. The ages in the Greek Septuagint are different. In most cases, they differ by exactly one hundred years. Others have shown that the Septuagint figures are more reliable. This brief paper shows the differences in graphical form."
