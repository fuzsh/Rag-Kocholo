        "text": "Gustave is the main antagonist of the 2007 action horror film Primeval, which is inspired by the true story of the real-life animal of the same name. He is a giant, legendary, man-eating 25-foot Nile crocodile in Burundi who is a near-mythical creature to the local people of the region and is rumored to have killed and eaten up to 300 people in Africa.\n\nGustave is the main antagonist of the 2007 American horror film Primeval.\n\nA group of American tourists travels to the African country Burundi to capture and document a legendary man-eating crocodile named Gustave, but Gustave turns the tables on them by stalking the group.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nGustave is an abnormally large, muscular dark grey Nile crocodile who is stated that he could be \"easily more than 20 feet (6.1 m)\" long and weighs more than 2,000 pounds (910 kg). One of his notable characteristics are three bullet scars on his body while his right shoulder blade is also found to be deeply wounded. Gustave is a large dark grey Nile crocodile stretching a little over 20 feet in length and weighing over a ton.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nGustave Is Depicted As A Selfish, Ruthless, Sadistic, Cruel, Anger, Rage, Manipulative, Intelligent, Cunning, Strategic, Monstrous, Cold-Headed, Arrogant, Bloodthirsty, Savage, Violent, Vicious, Dangerous, Destructive, Powerful, And Homicidal Predator who enjoys stalking and killing anything that came across his territory or got in his way, including both humans and animals, though he sometimes often leaves his victims' corpses uneaten. However, he would kill anything in his path, showing that he preferred to kill anything as long as they are in his way. Since crocodiles can go several months without eating, Gustave can afford to select his prey carefully.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGustave grew up in the rivers of Africa. It is unknown how old he is, but he is said to be more than a century old. He is depicted as a crocodile of god-like or prehistoric proportions. Nevertheless, Gustave grew to reach around 25 feet long, weigh close to a ton, and become the most dangerous and powerful predator in all of Africa and arguable one of the largest, if not the largest, crocodiles the world had ever seen, killing hippos, large buffalo, and on occasion humans. Throughout his existence, Gustave grew into a legend, many claiming to have seen him and even fewer living to tell the tale.\n\nPowers And Abilities[]\n\nGiant Animal Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nSuperior Animal Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nMonster Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nGiant Monster Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nPredator Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nApex Predator Physiology: Gustave (Primeval),\n\nHybrid Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nMutant Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nBerserker Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nLizard Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nReptilian Physiology: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nEnhanced Body: Gustave (Primeval).\n\nNile Crocodile Physiology: Gustave Has Possessed Serval Incredibly Physical Attributes, And Feats Of Strength, Durability, Endurance, Speed, Stamina, Agility, Reflexes, Senses and Intelligence, That Surpassed Than That Of Other Normal Crocodiles In Real-Life, Even For A Legendary Prehistoric Crocodile As He Is Possibly More Stronger And Powerful Than Any Others Seen In This Movie.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Due To His Abnormally Largest Gigantic/Gargantuan Size, Gustave Possesses Varied Levels Of Extremely, Amounts Of Immense, Massive Incalculable God-Like Advanced Physical Natural Strength, While He Also Has Extremely Strong And Powerful Jaws, Making Him One Of The Most Incredibly Exceptionally Monstrously Dangerously Strongest And Powerful Biggest Predators On Land.
