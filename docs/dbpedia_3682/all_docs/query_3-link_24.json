        "text": "Background\n\nIn primeval and old-growth European beech forests (Fagus sylvatica L.), stand replacement is mostly not caused by large disturbances like fire, severe windthrow or insect calamities. Instead, natural regeneration often takes place on a small scale initiated by the age-related dieback of single old trees leading to the formation of small gaps of ca. 100–250 m2. Subsequently, groups of saplings and young trees start to develop [1]. Advanced regeneration beneath the canopy of old trees is also frequently observed [1, 2] and cover considerable portions of gap area at the time of gap formation [3]. Without human influence, it is thought that European beech forests would represent multi-cohort forests on a small scale. It is, however, a matter of debate to which extent also large infrequent disturbances are driving stand dynamics and which area typically is covered by single-cohort patches with more or less homogeneous structure.\n\nUsually there is no information on the true age of trees in primeval beech forests. As a consequence of their multiple-cohort structure and the resulting complex individual growth patterns [2], “stand age” (i.e., the time since the last larger disturbance event) is not an appropriate attribute to characterize the development status of a certain patch of primeval beech forests, as the age of trees in primeval forests varies on small spatial scales [4]. Instead, classification into development stages and further subdivision into development phases of the forest development cycle [5] has been introduced by Leibundgut [6] and Korpeĺ [1] for European primeval forests and is widely accepted as a surrogate for stand age. Based on this categorization, different models have been developed to describe natural forest dynamics over time (e.g., [1, 7–9]). Oliver and Larson [10] distinguish four different development stages for single- or multiple cohort stands: (1) the stand initiation stage occurs when a disturbance event causes partial or complete breakdown of the overstory; (2) during the stem exclusion stage, competition is the main cause for mortality and stem number continuously decreases while living biomass is accumulating; (3) in the understory re-initiation stage, more light may reach the ground when suppressed trees die and tree saplings and small trees establish; and (4) during the old-growth stage, large and senescent trees die and small to medium sized gaps form which are rapidly filled again by lateral branch growth of neighboring trees or by understory trees. In multiple cohort stands like primeval beech forests, cohorts in all of these stages may occur simultaneously and horizontally layered.\n\nIn forest ecosystem research, the concept of forest development stages is used among others for describing habitat quality for different organism groups [11–14] or for characterizing the development of important stand properties such as leaf area index or structural diversity [15]. While it is convenient to describe and classify growth phases of single trees (e.g., through age or diameter classes) and to distinguish development stages of single-cohort stands, classification of multiple-cohort stands is much more difficult. In the past, distinction between development stages was mostly done with dichotomous keys which use thresholds of specific stand structural attributes at the plot level (SSA, for example basal area, height or amount of deadwood) [7, 8, 14, 16]. Recently, with the aid of computer algorithms, more sophisticated classification methods for development stages and phases were developed [17–19].\n\nAll these methods have in common that a priori assumptions about development stages and their characteristic compositions with respect to the used SSAs are made. For example, the occurrence of a certain amount of deadwood is usually one of the criteria for a forest patch to be assigned to the terminal development stage (senescence, breakdown stage [1, 17]). These approaches with parameter delimitation based on expert opinion neglect the possible existence of biologically-determined thresholds in the structural data of old-growth forests, which could mark the transition from one development stage to another. Such breakpoints might occur if SSAs do not change gradually over time but when the stand structure adapts more rapidly after certain SSA thresholds are reached and/or discrete disturbance events change the intrinsic development. For example, the diameter distribution of some primeval European beech forests peaks at mid-range diameters at breast height (DBH) [20]. This may indicate pulses of tree establishment caused by past disturbances. Another explanation is that trees reach the upper canopy at these DBH-classes which reduces competition with larger individuals and mortality rates drop immediately at such a site-specific diameter threshold [20]. We assume that similar effects can be observed and are more pronounced when multidimensional datasets of the stand structure (one dimension for each included attribute) of primeval forests are analyzed. Our hypothesis is that multidimensional point clouds of such data-matrices from primeval forests are not homogeneously distributed, but that spatially separable clusters do exist which are corresponding to the development stages of the natural forest development cycle.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we use stand structural data from two completely mapped primeval beech stands in Albania: Mirdita and Rajca. A moving window (focal filter) approach is used to aggregate the SSA-data in virtual plots over the entire area of two forests. Two parameters of the moving window (virtual plot size and kernel) were varied in a sensitivity analysis to ensure that potentially existing effects are not missed because of an inappropriate study design. We then applied an unsupervised classification algorithm (k-means clustering) to detect potentially occurring clusters in the stand structural dataset without making a priori assumptions about potential thresholds. According to our hypothesis, potentially occurring clusters would correspond with the stages of the natural forest development cycle. K-means clustering requires the pre-specification of the number of clusters k. To avoid assumptions about the number of occurring stages, we used different values for k (2, 3, 4, and 5).\n\nOur results may help to understand the fundamentals which form the basis of the classification of forest development stages and phases. We are asking the question: Does the multidimensional distribution of a primeval forest SSA-data matrix show a clustered configuration with clearly distinguishable thresholds between clusters? If so, we assume that such thresholds mark site-specific transitions from one development stage to another. Such thresholds would represent prime candidates to be used in site-adapted classification schemes. If no clustered configuration appears, this would point towards a rather homogeneous and continuous distribution of the SSA data-matrix in higher dimensional space, indicating the lack of predetermined thresholds. In that case, the selection of thresholds based on ecological theory and by expert opinion would be justified.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe visualization of potentially existing clusters in the stand structural data with the first principal components did not reveal substantial aggregation of data points. On the contrary, only at greater observation scales of 1000 m2 and 1500 m2 there were only slight peaks visible in the contour plots (Fig. and Additional file 1: Figure S1). However, the low averages of the silhouette coefficients of all cluster solutions irrespective of observation scale indicate that these peaks are no evidence of the presence of real clusters in the data. The slight peaks appearing at greater observation scales might well be just an artifact of the size of the study areas and the high similarity of points which are located close to one another. Additionally, even though both completely mapped areas were large (5 ha and 6 ha), it is likely that some common combinations of SSAs did just not occur within the boundaries of the study sites and are underrepresented in the datasets. These findings are consistent regardless of the number of distinguished clusters. No optimal number of development stages which should be used for the characterizing the natural forest development could be detected. It is unlikely that the use of a larger amount of clusters than five would have resulted in different results with improved clustering quality.\n\nThe low discriminability of the data into clusters may also be caused by a more complex stand structure of beech primeval forests than anticipated by the model of cyclic, regularly returning development stages [19, 22]. The stochastic nature of tree growth and mortality and prevalence of site specific disturbance regimes may lead to acyclic, unexpected transitions between stages [22]. Such random processes are probably of high relevance for the formation of the stand structure and may result in a high, unpredictable variation of structural attributes on small spatial and temporal scales. Even though these authors [22] do not question the overall usefulness of the concept of development stages, their results suggest that for some applications, the concept may be too simplistic. This is supported by recent analyses of gap dynamics in natural beech forests [3, 23, 24] which suggest that disturbance events of varying intensities are frequently occurring and can cause complex dynamics which are difficult to capture with the classic concept of forest development stages. In forests, where major disturbances lead to single-cohort structures, potentially existing clusters might have higher average silhouette coefficients and less blurring clusters than are observed in our forests.\n\nThe low quality of the clustering solutions suggests that, at least with respect to the studied variables, the natural forest development cycle does not lead to the emergence of clear thresholds in the SSA data-matrix between different development stages. This does not challenge the concept of classifying research plots into development stages in general, which has reliably and successfully been used to describe the forest development cycle in many previous studies (e.g., [11–13, 16, 25]). Instead, the results suggest that transitions between single stages are rather continuous. This is in agreement with other studies about the forest development cycle which show that patches of the same development stage or stand structure may take different pathways with gradually and continuously diverging composition of stand attributes [22, 26]. This supports the hypothesis of a continuous forest development life cycle as for example formulated by [7, 27]. On the one hand, this illustrates limitations of the classical approach of splitting the forest development cycle into discrete stages, as this approach may not reflect the complexity of natural forest development. This highlights the importance of analyzing single processes of forest development such as gap formation or regeneration in the course of time as done for example by [3, 28]. On the other hand, such a classification approach has proven to be a useful tool in biodiversity studies, in which it is necessary to stratify larger areas of forest according to tree age or other structural features when designing the study and analyzing the data (e.g., [12, 13]). Thus, the commonly applied practice to select thresholds based on expert opinion, which fit best to the respective ecosystems, study designs and questions, has its justification and will continually be used in future.\n\nEven though the selected attributes to describe the forest structure in this study were selected with care, more suitable variables to reflect the natural forest development cycle may exist. In compliance with current methods to describe development stages in the field, we used state variables like stand density, maximum tree height, regeneration abundance, and others (Table ). Ecosystem processes and functions like mortality or biomass accumulation and decay are not included neither in our selection of variables, nor in most other empirical studies addressing the classification of forest development stages. This is not because the importance of processes for forest development is neglected (in fact many authors state their relevance, e.g. [1, 10, 25]), but rather because such variables are much more difficult to monitor and suitable datasets for such analyses hardly exist. We cannot rule out the possibility that including other variables, especially variables describing ecosystem processes and functioning, might have resulted in clearer clustering solutions than observed here. However, the assessment of ecosystem processes such as productivity or decay rates typically require measurements in a high temporal resolution and are time- and labor-intensive. Until now, this prevented their consideration in classification approaches of the forest development cycle.\n\nTable 2\n\nAbbr.DescriptionNNumber of trees per hectareDBHmedMedian diameter at breast heightDBHiqrInterquartile range of diameter at breast heightHmaxMaximum tree heightVolliveVolume of living trees per hectareVoldeadDeadwood volume per hectareRegProportion of the area covered by regeneration\n\nWhen using the uniform kernel (i.e. equal weighting of objects within a virtual plot) for the aggregation of the structural data of the forests, the resulting maps of the distribution of the SSA over the study area displays a grainy pattern (Fig. a). Points lying directly next to each other (2 m distance) can be largely different depending on whether a single prominent structural feature located close to the plot border, falls within the boundaries or not. Highest aggregated values of some SSAs (e.g., live wood volume; Fig. ) do not occur in the direct vicinity of single objects with high attribute values, but right in between two prominent objects. This is because the distribution of large trees is usually not random due to the influence of competition, but tends to be more regular at scales where competition between single trees dominates the spatial distribution of large trees (ca. 10 m and less; [29]). It is more likely to encounter multiple prominent objects within a virtual plot when its center is close to plot radius distance from such an object.\n\nEffectively, the normal kernel aggregates attributes by calculating a weighted sum of all objects with weighting factors declining with distance from the plot center (see “Methods” section for details). This results in smoother distribution maps of the SSA when the normal kernel is applied with maximum aggregated values close to prominent objects (Fig. b). For the analysis of the relationship between structural features and other ecosystem attributes like regeneration or herb cover, the normal kernel could turn out to be superior. For example, when two bigger trees are located at opposite sides of a plot, half of their canopies and root systems reach beyond the plot border. Their influence in terms of light interception or water uptake at plot level is likely lower at the plot level than that of a single tree standing close to the plot center. The normal kernel accounts for this by assigning a higher weighting factor to the tree in the plot center.\n\nIn contrast to our hypothesis, the use of a bivariate normal kernel for data aggregation did not improve the performance of the clustering algorithm. Silhouette coefficients of the cluster solutions and visual appearance of the contour plots were equally poor. No otherwise hidden clusters or relationships between attributes did emerge when features more distant from a location in a primeval forest were downweighted for the assessment of its stand structure. All sort of different combinations of SSAs are equally likely and no clusters are present in the data structure. This does not discard the use of a bivariate normal kernel instead of a uniform kernel in general for the description of forest structure. For other applications, this approach still might be appropriate.\n\nIn many clustering solutions DBHmed and stem density N seemed to be important attributes for the separation of the clusters. As both of these variables are negatively correlated to each other (high N being associated with a low DBHmed and vice versa), they form one of the primary factors which were used by the clustering algorithm to differentiate between stages. The on average second most important factor used by the clustering algorithm was Hmax together with Vlive (which are positively related to each other). Both of these factors were arranged nearly orthogonal to each other in our study. This corresponds well with the selection of variables by [17] who used the distribution of N and basal area of live and dead trees to train a supervised classification algorithm. Other studies (e.g. [8] or [14]) only used maximum DBH, which is related to Hmax. Since the cited studies used some additional variables that have not been addressed by us (e.g. canopy cover), this may explain the missing consideration of N in these classification scheme.\n\nThe two trajectories of forest development identified in our study (N/DBHmed and Vlive/Hmax) are consistent with the framework developed by [10]. Low N and Vlive values correspond to the stand initiation stage, high Vlive and low to high N occur during the old-growth stage, depending on the progress of tree senescence and how much light reaches the forest floor. High N and intermediate Vlive reflect the stand exclusion and understory reinitiation stage. A stage characterizing a gap immediately after a disturbance event with the simultaneous break down of several trees (i.e. low N and low V) before stand initiation stage is missing in [10].\n\nThe ecological interpretation of these partly deviating results on the occurrence of stages should not be overstressed. Clearly, much variation exists in the results with respect to changing orders of the most relevant SSAs, depending on the observation scale and the number of clusters, which is difficult to explain in ecological terms. As there is no consistent trend with increasing observational spatial scale or number of clusters investigated, variation seems to be random and mostly unpredictable.\n\nMost SSAs varied, similar to Vollive, on small spatial scales. Such patterns are typical for the mosaic structure of primeval beech forests and a medium or large scale disturbance event does not seem likely in the recent past. However, even without major disturbances, there can be considerable change in the stand structure on a large spatial scale, as is documented for the gap area by two surveys within 10 years difference in a Slovakian primeval beech forest [3] or for tree species composition in a Slovakian mixed old-growth forest [30]. Differences between the two study areas may have been caused by slightly deviating site conditions and stand structures in Mirdita as compared to Rajca (according to [8], see Table ). The first site has not as good site conditions with more shallow soils and a lower dominant height resulting in a lower live tree volume. There was a slightly higher stem number and relative gap area in Mirdita but a somewhat higher basal area in Rajca. These differences may have resulted in a different average composition development stages in the two study areas. Even without larger disturbance events, such variation in stand structure may be a characteristic element of primeval forests [19, 22] and thus may have resulted in different clustering solutions.\n\nTable 3\n\nStem density (N/ha)Basal area (m2/ha)Live tree volume (m3/ha)Dead tree volume (m3/ha)Dominant height (m)Regeneration density (N/ha)Canopy cover (%)Relative gap area (%)Mirdita33137.2559.340.431.729,84486.166.6Rajca39143.4807.486.038.519,25991.363.3\n\nTabaku [8] categorized the stands in Mirdita and Rajca into 9 different developmental stages based on the same data set as used for this study applying a dichotomous key. The results of both classification schemes showed in many cases only a slightly higher agreement than would be expected from a random assignment of stages (analysis not shown). For example, the clustering solution with two clusters and a moving window size of 200 m2 in Mirdita distinguished one cluster which included 99% of the stand area covered by the category classified as “gap” by [8]. However, such a good agreement was an exception. On average, both classification schemes did not match very well. The thresholds used by [8], which are based on ecological theory and defined by expert knowledge, could not be reproduced by the clustering algorithms. This mismatch illustrates the difficulty of finding a classification scheme which does not underlie subjective assumptions but is still interpretable from an ecological perspective. As the differences between the clusters are rather small, random effects may influence the clustering solutions and a repeated run with the same approach could potentially result in clusters with different characteristics. This hampers comparability between studies and to studies which use a classical classification scheme.\n\nThe low relevance of Voldead for most of the clustering solutions is most likely because its spatial distribution across the study area is rather homogeneous and does not correspond well with the distribution pattern of other attributes. In contrast to earlier studies (e.g., [8, 17]), and in agreement with our results, [31] and [12] found that the amount of deadwood within a plot is not necessarily a good indicator for its development stage. The idea of high amounts of deadwood in the terminal stage and carry-over effects to the growth stage bases on the assumption of a strictly cyclic succession of development stages (i.e., → growth → optimal → terminal → growth → …, [1]). When tree cohorts of different ages are present at a forest patch and disturbance only causes a partial breakdown of the tree cover, transition from one development stage to any other may occur as described in depth by [22]. In conjunction with a high residual time of deadwood logs and snags up to 50 years [32], this may cause high deadwood amounts in any part of the development cycle. Deviating conclusions on deadwood persistence in the forest cycle by other studies may be caused by diverging classification methods. When the amount of deadwood is a key variable in a dichotomous key to assign development stages, conclusions about varying amounts of deadwood are circular reasoning.\n\nAt first glance, only moderate or missing relationships between the deadwood amount and forest development stage seem to be surprising because processes like mortality and decay doubtlessly play central roles in natural forest dynamics. However, the total amount of deadwood may not be a good proxy for such processes, as it just describes the status quo and not the underlying dynamics. A classification of deadwood objects into decay classes, which account for elapsed time since tree death, or direct measurement of deadwood dynamics through repeated measurements or recording of respiration rates may lead to results which are more closely linked to forest development stages.\n\nK-means clustering does not result in clearly separated clusters with distinct thresholds. However, the algorithms still lead to the objective splitting of the study sites into zones with maximum similarity within the same zone and maximum difference to areas of other zones (Figs. and ; Additional file 3: Figure S3, and Additional file 4: Figure S4). Areas of the same cluster in the maps were more likely subject to a similar development history. Large connected areas with a homogeneous stand structure (100 m to 200 m in length) give an impression, at which scale stand replacement takes place in primeval forests.\n\nPatch sizes obtained by this method are, irrespective of the observation scale, all larger than patches identified for example by the classification into development stages with supervised algorithms as done by [17]. Besides the effect of different computational methods, different patch sizes may also be identified because of differing stand dynamics in stands with functionally diverse tree species compositions (e.g., mixtures of broadleaved and coniferous species in spruce-silver fir-beech stands as in [17] compared to almost pure beech stands investigated here) or a differing set and weighting of specific SSAs used in the different studies. Patch size may also depend on the number of development phases distinguished. For example, [8] identified eight development phases with the consequence that observed patch size was smaller than in our study with separation of two to five stages."
