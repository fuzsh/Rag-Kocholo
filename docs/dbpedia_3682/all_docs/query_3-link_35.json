        "text": "Justified: City Primeval is one of FX’s newest shows, and the neo-western has already proven to be a more-than-worthy sequel to the original Justified series. Starring Timothy Olyphant, Aunjanue Ellis, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Adelaide Clemens, Marin Ireland, and Boyd Holbrook, the show takes inspiration from Elmore Leonard’s novel .\n\nBut while the original Justified took place in the Appalachian region of Kentucky, City Primeval is based in Detroit, and the city helps to shape many key events of the plot. The teaser for City Primeval featured many Detroit landmarks, and Leonard himself grew up in Detroit after moving there at age 9. The author remained there throughout his career, and he was even referred to as “The Dickens Of Detroit.”\n\nSince the city plays such a large part in the series, many viewers are wondering if the cast and crew really headed to the Motor City to film the series. Luckily for you guys, we've done the research to find out where Justified: City Primeval was actually filmed.\n\nWhere is Justified: City Primeval filmed?\n\nJustified: City Primeval is filmed in Chicago. The show filmed both on location in the city and also in Chicago Studio City, a full-service film studio.\n\nUnfortunately, the show was plagued by a few scary incidents. While filming in July 2022, two vehicles drove through the show’s barricades, and the car’s occupants were engaged in a gunfight that the cast and crew had to take cover from. Thankfully, no one was injured, but the set was shut down for a few days.\n\nAbout three weeks later, an “incendiary device” was thrown towards the set, but it didn’t explode and no one was hurt, as The Hollywood Reporter disclosed.\n\nOlyphant later opened up to Deadline about what it was like to experience the July shootout. “It was the scariest goddamn thing. It went on forever,” Olyphant said. “It was so frightening. I assumed one was going to hit me.”\n\nThe actor also confirmed that he helped guide a production assistant to safety. “It’s the weirdest thing, I’m wearing the Raylan [Givens] wardrobe standing behind this car,” he went on. “This is just like the show. It’s so weird. What am I doing?”\n\nThankfully, no one was hurt and it looks like there were no further incidents, and the show was able to continue filming as scheduled. The eight-episode limited series continues its run with episodes airing on Tuesdays on FX."
