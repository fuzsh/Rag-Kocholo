        "text": "Season 1 Episode 5 Undone Spoilers Ahead\n\nWritten By: Sarah Dodd\n\nDirected By: Michael Rohl\n\nLast week I scoured for ratings and didn’t find any, this week I came out successful! According to Reuben’s Ramblings, these are the ratings for June:\n\nJune 8 (“The New World”) – 1.3 million\n\nJune 15 (“Sisiutl”) – 1.2 million\n\nJune 22 (“Fear of Flying”) – 897,000 viewers\n\nJune 28 (“Angry Birds”) – 1.1 million\n\nFor a comparison, on Monday nights in the month of June, Warehouse 13 drew in 1.4, 1.7, 1.4, and 1.4 million; and Burn Notice (Thursdays) had 4.3, 4.3, 3.4, and 3.8 million. Two well-established shows, the former is cancelled after a brief 5-episode fifth season and the latter is in its seventh season (and I think it will be done after this season? Don’t watch it, myself). Anyway, point being… my assumption is that Primeval New World will have to be met with numbers greater than this for Syfy to invest. Warehouse 13, at least in the last season, has drawn in between 1.5-2.5 million viewers (slowly on the decline), and that is on its way out.\n\nIf that was too depressing, my apologies. Read on, it gets better.\n\nAfter Fear of Flying, I posited a theory that Sam had some ulterior motive to dating Mac, and thus to her appearance on-site at an Anomaly. Well, clearly I was wrong as she died a horrible, gruesome death this episode, but the idea behind my theory is still there. After Angry Birds, I pretty much shifted my suspicion to Lt. Leeds because he bird-napped Leggy. Aside from the too-long shower scene with Mac, I didn’t mind Sam, the character or the actress, but it seems like her purpose was more to bring Evan to a breaking point as he finally saw how dangerous his rogue operation is.\n\nThe creature-of-the-week was a Lycaenops from the mid to (early) late Permian period. Primeval fans will remember a similar Gorgonopsid creature from the pilot and finale episodes of series 1, but this particular creature was smaller and more dog-like than the one from the original series. They did a great job of distinguishing the two through the size of the body, the mouth, and its predatory tactics, which helped me, at least, consider this story unique. Unlike last week when I thought the use of a bird under the circumstances was a little off-base, this week’s creature was ideal for the situation presented. I’ll hit on that a little more later.\n\nFROSH WEEK\n\nMy favorite episode of Psych is “Scary Sherry” from season one. A sorority house is, supposedly, being haunted and Shawn and Gus uncover the real mystery happening while, simultaneously, getting a lot of great one-liners out from the overly-pampered princesses that inhabit the house. I love watching sorority girls or young freshman girls get the pants scared off them. It’s the cheesiest, funniest, least believable comedy. This may have to do with the fact I was never that girl, or never in a sorority, and never participated in anything campus related, so I like to think these things were going on as I was being a good nerd and studying.\n\nBut I digress. I enjoyed the opening sequence in which we follow Freshman Kate as she’s terrorized by her Frosh House Leader, forced to play a campus-wide game of Capture The Flag (awesome game), and begrudgingly ambles off to avoid her duties as a loyal housemate and, instead, be hunted by a Lycaenops. She locks herself in a bike lockup until campus personnel arrive and scare the pre-historic animal away. When she tries to explain what she saw, no one believes her and she’s asked how much she’s had to drink that night. Typical. This is why I didn’t leave my dorm room! Lycaenops!\n\nMac and Toby hunt her down later on to get a first-person account of the encounter. To no one’s surprise, Kate is unhelpful and offers no significance to the story line except to tell Mac that he reeks of pre-historic creature pee.\n\nLYCS TO READ\n\nThe Lycaenops chooses to hide in the library which created some nice suspense as Dylan and Evan quietly hunted the creature through the stacks. I’m sure there are a dozen innuendoes packed in that scene, but I won’t go into them. My admiration for Evan’s character each week continues to grow because he is not that stereotype. He’s lived, he’s loved, and he’s lost, and he isn’t still stuck in college. This scene also helped to build the dynamic between Dylan and Evan. They use cues and split up, like they’ve been doing this a lot longer than they have.\n\nThe use of flashlights in the library scene was also really neat camera work. I actually liked how, sometimes, all we could see was the flare of the flashlight as they crept between stacks and followed (or ran away from) the Lycaenops. It helped build suspense and it was a funny little parallel to how reliant (or maybe just inexperienced) humans are on sight in comparison to other species, and species of the past.\n\nCROSS PHOTONICS: TEMPORARY DINOSAUR ZOO\n\nThe end of the pilot episode showed us that Evan was already content to leave heavily sedated creatures in freezing temperatures down in the bowels of Cross Photonics, so it wasn’t surprising that Evan wanted to bring the Lycaenops back to headquarters while they waited for the Anomaly to reopen. I can even give them the benefit of the doubt in leaving the creature in the van while they research it and decide how best to handle the situation because Dylan thought she had properly sedated it. Personally, knowing the damage it could potentially cause and the sheer risk of it getting loose where they left it in the van, I would have found some sort of containment room and locked it in there. Of course, then you’d have to deal with it waking up and not having a means to sedate it again when you open the door and it comes flying at you. But I’ll admit, during my first watch I couldn’t figure out why Evan would just leave it in the van. It did make more sense on rewatch.\n\nIn Fear of Flying, Mac seemed to find it pretty sexy how cool Sam was with everything being dropped in her lap, and he was pretty quick to bring her along to the site of the Anomaly. He jokes about leaving her on the side of the road, but if he really had to…what about a bus stop? It appears as though his affection for Sam grew, to a point that she was now reciprocating the feelings at approximately the same level he was, he sees the threat these creatures pose to Sam as someone he cares about rather than someone he wants to impress. He is less inclined to want a girl he’s falling in love with to be exposed to that same danger. I can understand that and throughout this episode, it is written all over Mac’s face. The despair he felt after the Lycaenops mauled his Lady Love was adequate and it provoked the morality question of the week, which was also a heavy point of discussion in the original series: what responsibility does the Special Projects Team really have toward creatures that come through the Anomalies?\n\nWhen Evan still selects a tranq gun from the SPT arsenal, Dylan’s approach to this question was much more practical: “I was trained to make it first priority to return them to their natural habitats. But once they kill, they must be destroyed.” But the blinders she’s wearing is concerning the scope of what these creatures are. These aren’t the neighbor’s dogs who happened to bite a child playing in the yard, nor are they mountain lions venturing closer to civilization than the typical cat. These are the epitome of endangered species, in that killing them could effect something more dire than the threat they present in the current era. Toby’s rebuttal, “No, Evan’s right, if killing these things could change our past then they need to be protected,” falls right in line with a theory that Evan presented to them all based off the information that he got from Connor in the pilot. And finally, finally, Dylan sees that Evan knows something and isn’t sharing all his secrets.\n\nIT’S MY FAULT\n\nBoth Lycaenops are dead, one by Dylan’s hand–who holds her own belief on how the creatures are to be handled–and one by Mac’s hand–who is seeking revenge for Sam’s death. Granted, the female was trying to eat Toby, so there really was no great way to stop it, but I believe that Dylan had a little bit of her own agenda in the Tank. Evan, while incredibly intelligent and versatile, is also blinded by guilt over Sam’s and Uninquisitive Bill’s deaths. The responsibility they have over the past does not diminish the responsibility they have in the present. Every human life is worth something, and if putting these creatures down means saving a person right now instead of considering every possible outcome of this creature’s future in the past, isn’t it our responsibility to do just that?\n\nDylan really is the Stephen to Evan’s Cutter, and is just as quick to oppose him and even overrule hum when she believes she’s in the right. When it comes down to these snap judgments, though, I don’t blame Dylan at all for the choices she makes as a trained agent in Predator Control. Not in the least. I’m reminded of decisions Stephen made after Abby was taken by that futuristic aquatic primate (a.k.a. “The Mer”) in series 2 episode 4, and how he insisted that the creature was in the canal while Cutter suspects the creature to have found an outlet through the drains. The disagreements between Cutter and Stephen were part of what drove that show for me and created much of the drama for the actual hunt of the creatures and I really love that this type of dynamic is being explored in Dylan and Evan’s relationship.\n\nThe most powerful scene came for me in the last couple minutes. Mac says to Evan, “What are you going to say to make it better? Huh?” Dylan had to force the truth of Evan’s wife’s death out of him, so the likelihood of Mac not knowing is pretty great. So the real answer to Mac’s question is quite heavy. Evan could tell him a lot of things that would put everything into perspective. But Evan has proven time and time again that he isn’t that person. And that’s why we love him.\n\nInterestingly, Evan goes to Ange’s arms for comfort. No words, no kiss. She just sees his pain and wraps him in a hug. Their relationship goes way back, I don’t know for sure, but I would definitely suspect that Ange knew his wife and saw him pick himself up after her death. Whether she knows how Brooke died, I don’t know that either, but I would suspect no. Not entirely. But they’ve become close despite the rockiness of the last few weeks, or months, or years, in terms of the division of Evan’s attention. They know each other well, they’ve been through a lot together. So why does Evan go running to her? Because she knows how hard he’s been working on this project for six years, knows how much time he’s invested, how much he’s lost (how much the companies they’ve started together have lost), and, most importantly, will not cast character judgments on him for the decisions he’s made. He lost his wife, he never intended for anyone to die. It’s such a touching moment because you see the reality of his mission come crashing down in the hug.\n\nWRAP UP\n\nWhere do we go from here? I wonder if Lt. Leeds will have a much more prominent role next week, and whether Evan will start to come clean with some of the secrets he’s been playing closer to the vest. One episode a week certainly is not enough!\n\nNext week: Clean Up on Aisle Three"
