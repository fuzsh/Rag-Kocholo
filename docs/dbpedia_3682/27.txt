I’m sorry that I just recently have discovered this album, released in early summer last year. What we have here is the third full-length album from US-death metallers Torture Rack. It arrived five years since its 2018 predecessor, Malefic Humiliation. At the present time, the band formed in 2012, is a four-piece, featuring members of Witch Vomit, Skeletal Remains, Ænigmatum & Weregoat.

Primeval Onslaught consists of 10 tracks, with 26 minutes of gore-soaked old-school death metal. After just one spin I noticed that the songwriting has been tightened and the four guys seem more confident and secure in creating precise and successful compositions, than ever. Thus, the short songs are violent and intense, filled with murderous, thick and muscular riffs, mostly deep and guttural grunting vocals, thundering bass lines and battering and hammering, yet varied drums. Speaking of drums, there’s some incredible drums delivery in a track like “Decrepit Funeral Home”. A personal favorite is a track called “Impalement Storm” due to its variation and memorable riffs. Another interesting song is “Victims of Inquisitors” as it emphasizes the slower pace and the classic straight old-school brutal death metal approach. Due to the short nature of the songs, and of the album, there is no moment whatsoever of dullness.

Torture Rack captures the essence of being a musician, of creating art in its purest impulsive state, without worrying about polishing the edges of making it perfect. That is the addictive charm of Primeval Onslaught.

Primeval Onslaught is a further expansion of a great legacy. If you’re into bone-crushing, savage, gore-soaked old-school death metal, and if you dig some of the following acts, Cannibal Corpse, Autopsy, Morgue, Suffocation, Mortician, Witch Vomit, Broken Hope etc., then it’s tremendosuly recommended to take Primeval Onslaught and have a proper listening experience.
