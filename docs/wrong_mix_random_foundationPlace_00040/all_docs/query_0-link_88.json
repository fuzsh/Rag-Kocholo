        "text": "This might be his last dance.\n\nKanye West was sued by the estate of the late singer Donna Summer after the rapper used a sample of the late Queen of Disco’s 1977 hit “I Feel Love” without permission.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Post, West, 46, approached the Summer estate and requested to use the sample for his track “Good (Don’t Die)” but was denied.\n\nA representative for West was told they were denied because there was a danger of “potential degradation to Summer’s legacy” as “West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him.”\n\nThe estate says that despite permission being “explicitly denied,” West and his collaborator Ty Dolla $ign went ahead and used the track anyway.\n\n“In the face of this rejection, Defendants arrogantly and unilaterally decided they would simply steal ‘I Feel Love’ and use it without permission,” the 16-page document states. “In their song ‘Good (Don’t Die)’ Defendants re-recorded almost verbatim the key, memorable portions of Summer’s iconic song, used it as the hook for their own song and released it to the public knowing they had tried and failed to secure legal permission from its rightful owners and had no legal right to do so.”\n\nThe document also states that West’s song, which was released as a part of his highly anticipated “Vultures 1” album, was “instantly recognized” as a “blatant rip-off” of Summer’s tune.\n\nSince the lawsuit, several music streamers “took down the infringing song in acknowledgment of Plaintiff’s intellectual property rights” but have otherwise left the rest of the album untouched.\n\nThe Post reached out to West for comment.\n\nThe estate of the “Hot Stuff” songstress, who died in 2012 at age 63, is currently seeking “compensatory damages, maximum statutory damages, attorneys’ fees, and disgorgement of any profits earned by West and his Co-Defendants.”\n\nAdditionally, the estate is seeking an injunction against West to block any further distribution of the infringing song.\n\nThis is apparently not the first time that the “Heartless” singer was denied someone else’s music.\n\nEarlier this month, the rapper reportedly asked Ozzy Osbourne for permission to use a sample of one of his songs. He was denied, but used the track at a listening party anyway.\n\nThe Black Sabbath frontman told his Instagram followers that West wanted a sample of a 1983 live performance of “War Pigs.”"
