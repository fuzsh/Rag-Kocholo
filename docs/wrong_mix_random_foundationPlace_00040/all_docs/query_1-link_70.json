        "text": "Donna Summer Estate Says Kanye West Sampled ‘I Feel Love’ Without Permission\n\nThe Donna Summer estate says Kanye West sampled the late singer’s classic song “I Feel Love” without permission.\n\nSummer’s estate shared a statement via an Instagram Story, which was transcribed by Billboard. The statement read, “Kanye West… asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!”\n\nThe alleged sample is featured on the track “Good (Don’t Die)” on the recently released album, Vultures. The album is a joint LP with rapper Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nMore Sample Issues with Kanye West Other Than Donna Summer\n\nThis isn’t the only sample from Vultures West allegedly didn’t get permission to use. Ozzy Osbourne made headlines last week for accusing West of asking to sample a live recording of “Iron Man,” being denied, but then proceeding to use the sample anyway.\n\nOsbourne took to social media to put the rapper on blast. He wrote, “Kanye West asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of ‘Iron Man’ from the US Festival without vocals and was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many.”\n\nOsbourne continued, “He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!”\n\nFollowing Ozzy sharing his statement, Sharon Osbourne issued a statement via TMZ. Ozzy’s wife/manager told the tabloid outlet, “Kanye f—ed with the wrong Jew this time.” (Sharon was raised Jewish, and her father, former Black Sabbath manager Don Arden, was born into a Jewish family.)\n\nSharon also told TMZ that Kanye’s reps reached out regarding the sample about three weeks ago. While Ozzy rarely turns down a sample request, Sharon said Ozzy had a “special f—ing occasion to say no,” due to the rapper’s long history of making antisemitic comments. Furthermore, Sharon said Ye “represents hate,” is a “disrespectful antisemite,” and “the motherf—er’s a pig.”\n\n10 Women Artists Who Have Yet to be Inducted into the Rock Hall\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
