        "text": "Considering that the legendary figure at the center of this story spent much of her life battling against being pigeonholed as superficial and unworthy, “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical” is unforgivably superficial and pretty much unworthy.\n\nThis 2018 Broadway musical, now at the Pantages through Nov. 24, focuses on the 1970s pop music icon who managed to sustain a varied and respected singing career into the new millennium.\n\nThe show’s score consists of 23 songs Summer recorded (written by Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Pete Bellotte, Paul Jabara and others). To tie them together, the musical’s book (by Colman Domingo, Robert Cary and Des McAnuff) splits Donna into three characters, representing three stages of her life.\n\n“Diva Donna” (Dan’yelle Williamson), as her mature self looking back, brings onstage the two other Donnas, explaining this threesome with a single statement: “Welcome to the hall of mirrors.” Here we meet Disco Donna (Alex Hairston) and teenager Duckling Donna (Olivia Elease Hardy).\n\n“I’m an ugly duckling,” cries Duckling Donna to her father, Andrew Gaines (Erick Pinnick). Mary Gaines (Williamson) reminds her daughter that “the ugly duckling becomes a beautiful black swan.” This supposedly explains how Duckling Donna now has the confidence to sing in church, delivering “On My Honor.”\n\nDonna heads for New York, where her life moves “Faster and Faster to Nowhere.” Except, of course, she makes it to the top.\n\nShe moves to Germany, where she meets and has a child with her first husband, Helmuth Sommer (good thing one of them couldn’t spell). He’s instantly out of the picture; she’s suddenly known as the Disco Queen; and she’s singing a duet of “Heaven Knows” with her soon-to-be-second-husband, composer and bassist Bruce Sudano (Steven Grant Douglas).\n\nGunther (John Gardiner), a man she once knew in Germany, now rings her doorbell, pleading that there won’t be trouble. She lets him in. He brutally assaults her. “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” Donna sings. But then she tells us this song isn’t about Gunther; it’s about “all the men” leading up to this moment.\n\nThere’s a funeral for Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart (John Gardiner), and she sings “Dim All the Lights.” She signs with David Geffen, and she sings “She Works Hard for the Money.” And so forth.\n\nThe one aspect of Summer we’re consistently shown is defensiveness. An anti-gay comment the born-again Christian Summer reportedly made (she denied making it) gets an explanation. The handing over of her daughter’s upbringing to grandma and grandpa gets the shortest of mentions. But how anything made Summer feel — divorce, fame, her own cancer diagnosis that took her life at age 63 — is painted over with a sparkly gloss.\n\nChoreographer Sergio Trujillo establishes each era with period-appropriate dance steps. McAnuff directs, but he pulls surprisingly shallow performances out of his Donnas. At least he managed to get a disco ball into one number.\n\nDonna Summer concerts in the 1970s boasted two unforgettable features: innumerable costume changes and that evocative, unique, irreplaceable voice. Here, we get the costumes (Paul Tazewell’s designs).\n\nWe know the singers here are not Summer. But they add nothing to the songs, neither her musicality nor a memorable vocal quality.\n\nWas that a laugh track playing at the show’s start, warming up the audience? Was that the sound of canned applause? If not, the claques at the top of the balcony should tone it down. There’s nothing illegal, probably nothing even unethical, about this. But once again, Donna Summer has been sold short.\n\nDany Margolies is a Los Angeles-based writer.\n\n‘SUMMER: The Donna Summer Musical’\n\nRating: 1 star\n\nWhere: Hollywood Pantages Theatre, 6233 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood\n\nWhen: Through Nov. 24: 8 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, 1 and 6:30 p.m. Sundays\n\nTickets: $39–$149 (“prices may fluctuate”)\n\nLength: 1 hour and 50 minutes, no intermission\n\nSuitability: Teens and adults\n\nInformation: 800-982-2787, hollywoodpantages.com"
