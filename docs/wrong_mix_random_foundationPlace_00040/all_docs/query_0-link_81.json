        "text": "All hail the Queen of disco.\n\n“Summer: The Donna Summer Musical” is doing the hustle at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco through Dec. 29.\n\nThe velvet vocalist rarely got her due back in the day, even though many of her songs remain beloved by ’70s nightclub mavens everywhere. Pulse-pounding dance tunes such as “I Feel Love,” “Hot Stuff,” “Love to Love You Baby,” “Bad Girls,” “Last Dance” and “On the Radio” capture the irresistible beat of the bell bottom era.\n\nAlas, this infinitely forgettable 100-minute jukebox musical that shines a light on her songs doesn’t make much of her compelling life story or her magical signature sound.\n\nMake no mistake, director Des McAnuff, who with Colman Domingo and Robert Cary also wrote the musical’s book, generally has a real flair for the jukebox genre (see: “Jersey Boys”) but this show doesn’t feel worthy of its subject, a woman of color holding her own in a business controlled by white men.\n\nHer poignant biography includes issues of molestation, homophobia and addiction, but the play only skims the surface of these themes in favor of generic patter.\n\nThe hit songs are the saving grace of this cheesy little show in which three actresses play Summer. There’s young De’Ja Simone as “Duckling Donna,” the magnetic Alex Hairston, a master wiggler, as “Disco Donna,” and Dan’yelle Williamson as the formidable “Diva Donna,” looking back on a long career.\n\n“I never see the whole picture,” as Diva Donna puts it, “only fragments.”\n\nUnfortunately the fragments don’t add up to much here and the book never comes close to approaching the shimmering complexity of the music itself. Like “Jersey Boys,” which exposed many to the sounds of the Four Seasons, “Summer” may well convert legions to the pleasures of the disco canon.\n\nAll three performers have their charms but splitting the main character diminishes the ability to channel the spirit of Summer, who died in 2012 at the age of 63. You don’t feel any closer to her after seeing this show, alas, although it does make you wish you never more about the woman behind the disco legend.\n\nThe most memorable moments in the show are when one of the Donnas throws herself into a song like “She Works Hard for the Money” or “Last Dance.” And Hairston certainly roots the dance numbers in a sense of pure, unadulterated hedonism. Bedecked in sequins and glitter (vampy costumes by Paul Tazewell), she channels the spirit of this Lycra utopia.\n\nThe seductive power of disco is the only thing that gives this plastic musical any shimmer at all. In those transcendent interludes, the musical truly finds its beat. The script may be sketchy, the dialogue clunky and the comedy falls just short of camp, but the music is often on fire. Plus, the chemistry between Steven Grant Douglas (as Bruce) and Hairston is suitably tingly. That’s one of the few sizzles in this “Summer.”\n\nThe show is not hot stuff, by any means, but if it’s been a tough year and you feel the need to dance in the aisles, feel free to indulge that guilty pleasure. Singing along is quite acceptable as well.\n\nThe disco balls await you.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical”\n\nWhen: Through Dec. 29\n\nWhere: Golden Gate Theatre, 1 Taylor St., San Francisco\n\nAdmission: $56 to $266"
