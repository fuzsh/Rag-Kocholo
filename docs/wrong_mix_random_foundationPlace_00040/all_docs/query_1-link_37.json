        "text": "The Queen of Disco, Donna Summer, became an iconic recording artist that dominated the late 70's. But how did her personal life unfold? Let's have a look!\n\nSummer earned a total of 42 hit singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 in her lifetime, with 14 of those reaching the top-ten. The five-time Grammy winner was a force to be reckoned with throughout her musical career.\n\nAlthough she passed aged 63 in 2012, her legacy lives on through her legendary music that defined an era of counterculture and extravagance.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nTHE STORY OF LADONNA ADRIAN GAINES\n\nThe iconic singer was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1948. She began performing at church and in school productions, which gained her popularity amongst her peers.\n\nBy 1967, she moved to New York City and joined the band Crow. After the band failed to secure a recording contract and dissolved, Summer auditioned for a role in the counterculture musical \"Hair.\"\n\nImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nShe agreed to join the traveling production when they decided to take the musical to Germany, where she became fluent in German, singing various songs in that language.\n\nIn 1968, the singer released her first single, as Donna Gaines, a German version of the title \"Aquarius\" from the musical.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nIn 1969, she issued the single \"If You Walkin' Alone\" on Philips Records. Within three years, she moved to Vienna, Austria, and joined the Vienna Volksoper.\n\nBy 1971 the singer released a second single, a remake of the Jaynetts' 1963 hit, \"Sally Go 'Round the Roses,\" from a one-off European deal with Decca Records.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nIn 1974, while working part-time as a model and back-up singer, Summer met Germany-based producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte during a recording session for \"Three Dog Night\" at Musicland Studios.\n\nThe working partnership would build Summer up to fame across Europe with singles \"The Hostage\" and \"Lady of the Night.\"\n\nA year later, the partnership led to the creation of \"Love to Love You Baby.\" which reached #2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nBy early 1976 the song had become a Gold single, while the album had sold over a million copies. Donna Summer had become a superstar.\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nImage Source: Getty Images\n\nDecades and multiple hits later, Donna Summers has gone down as one of our history's greatest singers. She won 5 Grammy awards during her career and had a loving family before she sadly died after a battle with lung cancer in 2012.\n\nHER SINGER-SONGWRITER HUSBAND\n\nDonna Summer married her fellow musician and songwriter, Bruce Sudano, on July 16, 1980. Sudano co-founded the late '60s pop-rock band Alive N Kickinâ, which scored a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with âTighter, Tighter.â\n\nHe later became a member of Brooklyn Dreams in the late '70s, which had a top 5 hit with âHeaven Knows,â a duet featuring Summer and Sudanoâs bandmate Joe Esposito.\n\nThis Photo was taken by Wolfgang Moroder.

Moreover, Sudano also co-wrote the songs \"Lucky\" and \"On My Honor\" with Summer.\n\nSudano continued his musical career as a solo artist following Summer's death. He made his South by Southwest debut in 2014 and even went on tour with the rock band, The Zombies.\n\nImage Source: Youtube / Bruce Sudano\n\nImage Source: Youtube / Bruce Sudano\n\nHe also brought the musical about his late iconic wife called \"Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,\" to life. The show opened on Broadway in April 2018, and Sudano released the video to his song \"Forbidden Fruit\" later that year.\n\nSudano and Summer raised three daughters together, one Sudano raised as his own, and they've gone to carve interesting lives for themselves in the world.\n\nImage Source: Youtube / LaChanze - Topic\n\nImage Source: Youtube / LaChanze - Topic\n\nMIMI SOMMER\n\nDonna Summer's eldest daughter is Natalia Pia Melanie Sommer, now known as Natalie Dohler.

She is represented by the New York City-based Bella Agency.\n\nIn 2010, she was chosen to model for Louis Vuitton's Spring/Summer 2010 shoe campaign, making her the first black model to feature solely in Louis Vuitton ads.\n\nThe lovebirds now live with their three children in Los Angeles. They welcomed their firstborn, Joaquin, in February 2015. Three years passed before Joaquin got a younger sister, Luna, and Paloma joined the family in December 2019.\n\nImage Source: Youtube / Johnnyswim\n\nImage Source: Youtube / Johnnyswim\n\nBROOKLYN SUDANO\n\nDonna Summer's eldest child with her songwriting partner and husband Bruce Sudano is actress Brooklyn Sudano.\n\nAt the age of 14, her family moved to Nashville, but Brooklyn and her sisters often joined their mother on tour.
