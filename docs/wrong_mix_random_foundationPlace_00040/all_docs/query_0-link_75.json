        "text": "Welcome to Shelf Life, ELLE.com’s books column, in which authors share their most memorable reads. Whether you’re on the hunt for a book to console you, move you profoundly, or make you laugh, consider a recommendation from the writers in our series, who, like you (since you’re here), love books. Perhaps one of their favorite titles will become one of yours, too.\n\nHer grandmother was a reader (and a First Lady), her mother was a librarian (and a First Lady), so it’s not a shocker that Jenna Bush Hager, who has worked as a reading coordinator, is a literary force. Among her Read with Jenna picks are 44 NYT bestsellers and 32 titles optioned for TV/film, including several under her Thousand Voices production banner, which has a first look deal at Universal. She’s also a NYT bestselling author herself (Ana’s Story: A Journey of Hope, and Sisters First and The Superpower Sisterhood, both co-written with her fraternal twin, Barbara Pierce Bush.) She recently celebrated the 5th anniversary of her book club by donating select titles to a library in all 50 states and with a party at Bibliotheque in NYC.\n\nThe Dallas-born, Austin-raised, CT-based Emmy-winning co-host of NBC’s TODAY with Hoda & Jenna interned at UNICEF in Latin America; is mother of 3, Swiftie, and former grade school teacher; has a tabby cat named Hollywood (her dad is her ; her daughter Poppy has a kitten named Mango); met her husband on her dad’s 2004 re-election campaign (she proposed to him after 3 months of dating); wanted to be a child star; and receives a Bible verse via text from her dad every morning.\n\nFan of: breathwork; queso with beans and tortillas; Trader Joe’s Gone Bananas! and pork and ginger soup dumplings.\n\nNot so much: Perfection (she finds it boring), hard-to-assemble-toys (self-explanatory), water parks.\n\nGood at: Candor, cleaning (loves her Dyson). Polish off her book recs below.\n\nThe book that…\n\n…kept me up way too late:\n\nby Chris Whitaker was genre-bending, and the mystery was super propulsive.\n\n…made me weep uncontrollably:\n\nby Hanya Yanagihara still haunts me with its emotion.\n\n…I recommend over and over again:\n\nby Toni Morrison was the first book that taught me about the power of literature to change lives.\n\n...I read in one sitting, it was that good:\n\nI was on vacation and read by Kevin Wilson in one day.\n\n…currently sits on my nightstand:\n\nI can't tell you that because the books won't be out for a year and a half!\n\n…I’d pass on to my kid:\n\nis a series I passed on to my eldest daughter, Mila, as well as everything written by Judy Blume.\n\n…I’d like turned into a TV show:\n\nThe 12 books we've optioned for Thousand Voices, including by Judy Blume.\n\n...has the greatest ending:\n\nI always say that the first book we chose for Read With Jenna, which was by Tara Conklin, ends with the most beautiful paragraph I've ever read.\n\n…features a character I love to hate:\n\nby Donna Tartt is one of my favorite books of all time, and the character Henry and his coldness are pretty ghastly.\n\n…describes a house I’d want to live in or a place I’d want to visit:\n\nby Ann Patchett has one of the best houses as a character. Also, by Sandra Cisneros is one that I'd love to visit.\n\n…should be on every college syllabus:\n\nby Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah should be taught on every college campus, as well as The Bluest Eye, but I'm sure both will be.\n\n...I consider literary comfort food:\n\nMysteries are the genre that I consider literary comfort food. writes some of the best.\n\n...everyone should read:\n\nby Javier Zamora and by Qian Julie Wang are two memoirs that everybody should read.\n\nBonus question: If I could live in any library or bookstore in the world, it would be:"
