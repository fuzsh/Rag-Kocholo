It would be cool now too. I would definately dig it.\n\nI'm not a fan of \"old Prince\". I'm not a fan of \"new Prince\". I'm just a fan of Prince.

Did you all notice that Donna also has a song called \"Journey to the center of your heart\"?\n\n\"Love is like peeing in your pants, everyone sees it but only you feel its warmth\""
