        "text": "The Donna Summer estate scored a big win against Kanye West this week related to Vultures 1, his new album with Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nThe track “Good (Don’t Die)” off of Vultures 1 featured an unauthorized sample of Summer’s song “I Feel Love.” Per Billboard, the backlash to the unauthorized sample led to the song being removed from Spotify four days after it hit the streaming service. Meanwhile, Rolling Stone reports the entire Vultures 1 album has since been removed from Apple Music. The removal is due to ongoing issues with the album’s distributor.\n\nAs previously reported, Summer’s estate shared a statement via an Instagram Story saying West and $ign sampled “I Feel Love” without permission. The statement read, “Kanye West… asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!”\n\nSummer was not the only artist to cry foul about being sampled without permission by West and $ign. Ozzy Osbourne issued a statement about an unauthorized sample. West and $ign sampled a live recording of Ozzy performing the Black Sabbath classic “Iron Man.” The sample was featured on the track “Carnival.” The live recording is from Osbourne’s performance of the song at the 1983 US Festival.\n\nOn Feb. 9, The Prince of Darkness took to social media and slammed the unauthorized use of the recording and West, himself. Ozzy wrote, “Kanye West asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of ‘Iron Man’ from the US Festival without vocals and was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many.”\n\nHe continued, “He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!”\n\nBy Feb. 13, West had actually removed the unauthorized sample from “Carnival.”\n\n10 Women Artists Who Have Yet to be Inducted into the Rock Hall\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
