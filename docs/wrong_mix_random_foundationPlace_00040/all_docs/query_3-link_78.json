        "text": "Toot-Toot! Heyyy, Beep-Beep! “Bad Girls,” Donna Summer’s biggest-selling single, may seem on its surface a frivolous disco concoction. The song’s Latin-flavored beat, brassy, exuberant riffs and joyous hooks made it a dancefloor staple and propelled it to the top of the charts, and its onomatopoeic singalong refrain has been getting stuck in people’s heads ever since. But there’s much more to “Bad Girls” than meets the eye.\n\nBad Girls\n\nBy 1979, Donna Summer was trying to break free of the perception that she was purely a studio creation. Her work with legendary Italian producer Giorgio Moroder on genre-defining hits such as “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love” triggered a seismic shift in the Top 40 from rock to dance music, earning her the title “Queen of Disco.” Heavy is the head that wears the spangled crown, however, and Summer was ready to diversify. She had always considered herself more of a pop artist, having started her career in 1968 fronting a folk-rock band in her native Boston. She later won a role in the German production of the rock musical Hair and relocated to Munich, where she gained regional fame in musical theater and light opera. Her marriage to Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer in 1973 produced both her firstborn child and her stage name: a record label misprint anglicized “Sommer” and the moniker stuck (she was born LaDonna Adrian Gaines on New Year’s Eve 1948).\n\nWhile singing backup for Three Dog Night at Munich’s Musicland Studios, Summer was introduced to Moroder and his songwriting partner Pete Belotte. That meeting turned into one of the most pivotal collaborations in pop history: the trio went on to write and record eight albums between 1974 and 1980, spawning a dozen Gold and Platinum singles. Moroder would become known as the “Father of Disco” for his pioneering use of synthesizers in the creation of electronic dance music, and under his tutelage, Summer learned to write radio-friendly songs through which she could fully express herself as a multi-dimensional artist. “Working with Giorgio was a priceless opportunity for me to learn the craft of three-minute, maximize-the-lyrics, maximize-the-hook pop songwriting,” she writes in her 2003 memoir, Ordinary Girl: The Journey.\n\n“Bad Girls” was one of the first songs Summer wrote for the follow-up to her 1977 double album Once Upon a Time. After she sketched out the words and melody, she took it to her band to arrange and record a demo. The band — Bruce Sudano on keyboards, Joe “Bean” Esposito on guitar and drummer Eddie Hokenson — were known as Brooklyn Dreams and would ultimately share a writing credit. (Sudano would also be known as Mr. Donna Summer after the couple wed in 1980.) The demo, which can be heard on the deluxe version of the Bad Girls LP, is more laid back than the completed album cut, but Summer knew it was a hit in the making. As soon as the song was finished, she rushed to play it for Neil Bogart, head of her label Casablanca Records. Bogart, the Disco King to Summer’s Queen, loved the song. In fact, he said it was perfect — for Cher.\n\nThough Cher was at a career nadir — her three previous solo LPs had bombed — Bogart was smitten with the mononymous singer, and thought he could use “Bad Girls” to lure her to his label. Upon hearing the news, Summer stormed out of Bogart’s office, demo in hand; she had written the song for herself and wasn’t about to give it away. (Cher ended up signing with Casablanca anyway, thanks in part to a sales pitch by her boyfriend, Kiss bassist Gene Simmons.)\n\nBogart exerted a Svengali-like hold on Summer, and afforded her the “privilege” of an office at Casablanca’s Sunset Boulevard headquarters. Summer’s inspiration for “Bad Girls” came one afternoon when a policeman stopped a young Casablanca publicist named Nellie Prestwood near the label’s offices. Prestwood “was a very pretty, well-dressed Black woman,” Summer writes. “She wasn’t a bad girl in any sense of the word, but she was Black and walking where the so-called bad girls walked, and because of it, the policeman had concluded that she was a prostitute.”\n\nThe incident angered Summer and she “began to consider what kind of life it was for the women who actually were hookers.” She realized there were all kinds of “working women” walking the Sunset Strip, and they all had something in common. “The whole point was that my friend was working a real job, but weren’t the so-called bad girls doing so as well?”\n\nThe sentiment may be as simplistic as the song’s refrain, but at its heart lies empathy. Summer was all too familiar with being misunderstood. “I was much more of a pop-rock, folk-oriented artist,” she writes. “But my skin was brown, so I was automatically packaged as an R&B act.” Even though she’d enjoyed an enviable amount of chart success after her 1975 breakthrough “Love to Love You Baby,” she feared that song’s impact was so strong that “no matter what else I did, I was destined to forever be known and remembered for one seventeen-minute moan-drenched song.”\n\nBad Girls — the song and the album — would change all that. The “Bad Girls” demo languished for two years among the reels at L.A.’s Rusk Studios until one day engineer Steven D. Smith found it, loved it and called Summer. “Donna, this is a hit record!” Smith enthused, but Summer told him Bogart wouldn’t let her release it as her own. “As soon as I heard myself say those words, I knew I had to do something,” Summer writes. “I couldn’t let Neil or anyone else tell me that my own music wasn’t right for me.” Smith suggested pitching the song directly to Moroder, who they hoped would convince Bogart to reconsider.\n\nMoroder recognized the potential of “Bad Girls” and immediately joined Summer in the studio, where they worked on the song for several days. Moroder disco-fied it with a four-on-the-floor drum beat, Latin percussion and a punchy horn part. A tri-tone samba whistle features prominently: isolate the percussion stem at the 20-second mark to hear it, along with the ostinato played on claves throughout. The whistle returns at 3:24, as the full complement of Latin percussion ramps up. Bill Conti’s timbales, congas, cabasa and handclaps not only give “Bad Girls” an Afro-Cuban flair, they elevate the party vibe in the song’s final minute. (The Joe Cuba Sextet’s Latin Boogaloo song “Bang! Bang!” has been cited as an influence on “Bad Girls.” “Bang! Bang!” hit the Billboard charts in 1966, when Summer was 18. While she consumed and appreciated a wide range of musical styles, it’s unknown whether she ever heard the tune or purposely appropriated its call-and-response motif.)\n\nThematically appropriate to “Bad Girls” — it represents law enforcement — the whistle was also a familiar sound at gay discos in the Seventies. Men would often bring musical instruments to clubs (cowbells, tambourines, claves — anything handheld), but whistles were especially popular because they could be worn around the neck, leaving the dancers’ hands free for… other things. Ornate whistles were even sold at high-end jewelers, alongside that other symbol of disco-era decadence, the golden coke spoon.\n\nAs much as Summer liked Moroder’s production, however, she felt something was missing. Finally, after repeated listening sessions, it dawned on her. “How do you get the attention of a hooker,” she thought, “especially if you’re in a car on Sunset?” The duo returned to the studio, Moroder rolled tape, and after Summer added “toot-toot, heyyy, beep-beep” to the final mix, Bogart agreed to release it.\n\nThe Bad Girls album would go on to become Summer’s most commercially successful LP, eventually selling more than four million copies worldwide. The first single, “Hot Stuff,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 in early June and stayed there for three weeks. “Bad Girls” followed in mid-July, holding down the number one spot for five weeks. Bad Girls sat atop the Billboard 200 album chart for one week, making it the second time Summer owned the top spots on the album and singles charts simultaneously (the first was with Live & More and “MacArthur Park” just six months prior). Bad Girls was supplanted the following week by Supertramp’s Breakfast in America, then regained the top spot and stayed there for another five weeks.\n\nBy the time she entered L.A.’s Village Recorder studio in August 1979 to record ”No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” her duet with Barbra Streisand, Donna Summer’s biggest rival for chart supremacy was Summer herself. She held the number one and two spots on the pop charts with “Bad Girls” and “Dim All the Lights,” both songs Summer had written without Moroder and Belotte. Despite promising Summer he’d wait a few weeks for those two songs to peak, Bogart authorized Streisand’s label Columbia to immediately release “Enough Is Enough” as a single. In early October, the duet quickly overtook “Dim All the Lights,” preventing the latter from reaching number one.\n\nHaving three of her songs in the top five was bittersweet for Summer. “Dim All the Lights” was the first hit song for which she alone had written the words and music, and she felt betrayed by Bogart, who she thought “short-circuited” her goal of achieving a number-one record as a singer-songwriter. Once again, Summer was left underestimated and misunderstood.\n\nNevertheless, Summer’s star shone so brightly that she headlined an eponymous primetime television special, which aired in January 1980 on ABC. The Donna Summer Special, a musical variety show, featured pre-taped comedy skits plus concert sequences filmed live at the Hollywood Bowl. Executive-produced by Summer’s manager (and former Casablanca publicist) Susan Munao, the special allowed Summer to showcase her acting and comedic talents, and prove she could anchor a primetime network special. She held her own alongside guest star Robert Guillaume, an Emmy Award-winning actor known at the time for his role in Guys and Dolls on Broadway and his performance as Benson on television’s Soap.\n\n“Bad Girls” was performed on an elaborate set for the special, complete with sidewalks, street lamps and a real police cruiser. Summer is costumed in purple satin leggings, a sequined bustier and new-wave glasses, an image that’s more B-52s than Disco Queen. While the style looked to the Eighties, her backup singers (credited as “bad girls”) were decidedly rooted in the Seventies: they were Twiggy, the British model and cultural icon; actress Debralee Scott, known for ABC sitcoms such as Welcome Back Kotter and Angie; and Pat Ast, the plus-sized Halston model and muse. Summer acts as their ringleader who, in a cheeky outro, is carted off by a policeman as the cast of extras waves goodbye. Even though the segment could have served as a de facto music video for “Bad Girls” at a time when the medium was new, MTV, which went on the air just 18 months later, didn’t play it. Summer would get her due in 1983, however, when “She Works Hard for the Money” became the first video by a Black woman to enter heavy rotation on the overwhelmingly white and rock-heavy cable network.\n\nThough she broke barriers at every stage of her career, Summer was conflicted about her manufactured image as a sex goddess in the disco era, and frustrated by attempts to confine her to a particular genre based on her skin color. It’s no wonder, then, that the plight of the so-called “bad girls” resonated with her. Like Nellie Prestwood or any other woman walking down the street, Summer comprised far more than her outward appearance. “Bad Girls” neither glamorizes nor shames its subjects, it simply recognizes them as human. Like everybody else, they want to be a star, she writes. “Maybe the ‘bad girls’ go about it in a way that is different from yours or mine, but they’re just as real as we are.”"
