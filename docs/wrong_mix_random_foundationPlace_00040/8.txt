(This page is about the American disco singer. For the American electronic producer of the same name, see Donna Summer(2)).

LaDonna Adrian Gaines (December 31, 1948 â€“ May 17, 2012), widely known by her stage name based on her married name Donna Summer, was an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She gained prominence during the disco era of the late 1970s. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Summer was the first artist in history to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the United States Billboard 200 chart and charted four number-one singles in the US within a 12-month period. Summer has reportedly sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. She also charted two number-one singles on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the US and a number-one single in the United Kingdom.

Although not a fan of the singer, Peel did play several covers of Donna Summer tracks by different artists throughout his shows. In the 00's, Peel played many tracks from a breakcore artist named Jason Forrest, using the name Donna Summer as his moniker until the end of 2004, when he reverted to using his real name for releases.
