LSI Wednesday announced that it has acquired StoreAge Networking Technologies, which had been one of the last independent storage virtualization vendors left.

LSI picked up StoreAge for $50 million and will add its software to the Engenio storage systems it sells through IBM and Sun.

StoreAgeâ€™s Storage Virtualization Manager is out-of-data path software installed on a switch-based appliance, which pools storage resources around a storage-area network. The company also has snapshot copy, replication, disaster recovery and migration software, which LSI will add to its Engenio storage systems.

The acquisition leaves Incipient, whose technology is closely tied to Cisco switches initially, as the last independent vendor of storage virtualization software. IBM has its own SAN Volume Controller; EMC has Invista and recently acquired Rainfinity to bolster its network-attached storage virtualization capability. FalconStor and DataCore have virtualization software that runs on appliances sitting in the data path.

The deal is expected to close by year-end.
