        "text": "N/ANetworks (Lexington, MA) has completed the development of the four ASICs powering its second-generation terabit routers ahead of schedule. Working with <%=company%> (Milpitas, CA), a world-leading supplier of communications chips, N/Afinished the new ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) in time to launch its first product into the fast-growing terabit router market.\n\nEngineers used the LSI Logic Right-First-Time methodology to develop chips that enable the N/Arouter to achieve terabit-per-second throughput, making it 25 times faster than today's routers. N/Aused a design strategy that reduced development risk by complementing its ASICs with easily produced field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). This strategy enabled the company to focus more time and resources on the high performance functions that were implemented in ASICs.\n\nN/Aintegrated HyperPHY into its design to drive the backplane. The interface provides a throughput of 800 Mbps for each backplane link, thus delivering much higher performance than traditional parallel backplanes."
