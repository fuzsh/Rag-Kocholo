        "text": "All Started in 1990\n\nDawn of the system LSI era\n\nMegaChips was founded as Japan’s first fabless system LSI manufacturer\n\nwhen the industrial paradigm was changing from production capacity to development capability\n\nGlobal Activities\n\n1993Digitalization of Japanese cell phone\n\n1995Release of Windows 95 / Spread of the Internet\n\nMegaChips’ Activities\n\n1990Establishment\n\n1991Started customer specific LSI business\n\n1995Started MegaChips-brand application specific LSI business / Systems products business\n\n1998Tokyo sales office opened\n\n1998Public stock offering\n\n1990 when emphasizing in-house production capacity with large-scale production facilities was mainstream in the semiconductor industry. MegaChips was founded as a fabless system LSIs manufacturer using a new model that defied the conventional wisdom of that time, namely specializing in R&D and outsourcing all production. In the new field known as system LSIs, MegaChips has developed various ASIC products (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) that are tailored to meet customers’ needs, such as for gaming device and facsimile image processing. In 1995, MegaChips started supplying its own branded ASSP products (Application-specific standard product) for, among others, television use. In addition, from its experience with the Great Hanshin earthquake disaster, MegaChips developed a device that records and transmits images of the situation of remote locations using MegaChips’ proprietary video compression technology as its core. This device has been widely adopted and used in such places as factories, power stations, buildings and elevators.\n\nMain Development Achievements\n\nLSI for game consoles (ASIC）\n\nLSI for facsimile image processing (ASIC）\n\nLSI for wide TV window control (ASSP）\n\nMiniature, lightweight video transmission server (System device)\n\nThe first 7 employees in a meeting when MegaChips started\n\nLSI for wide TV window control\n\nMiniature, lightweight video transmission server\n\n2000-\n\nIn the era of broadbandization and digitalization,\n\nMegaChips expanded business fields focused on the B to C market by capturing the digitalization trends\n\nGlobal Activities\n\n2000Start of broadband services\n\n2001Start of 3G cell phone services\n\n2006Start of digital TV broadcasts\n\n2007Release of iPhone / Increased spread of smartphones globally\n\n2011Start of 4G cell phone services\n\nMegaChips’ Activities\n\n2000Listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange Section 1\n\n2004Obtained ISO14001 certification\n\n2006Obtained ISO9001 certification\n\nThe 2000s evolution of the broadbandization of communication lines and the digitalization of devices in one fell swoop. Having predicted the growth of the coming broadband society, MegaChips has heightened the sense of presence in the industry and developed and supplied system LSIs that support the high functionality of the most advanced digital devices, such as LSIs that realize a high-quality digital camera and high-resolution image processing as well as LSIs for 3G cell phones that process multimedia information, such as videos, images, voices, and music.\n\nMain Development Achievements\n\nJPEG2000 LSI (World’s first in 2004)\n\nMultimedia processing LSIs for 3G cell phones (ASSP)\n\nLSI for single-lens reflex digital cameras (ASSP, ASIC)\n\nLSI for digital terrestrial broadcasting reception (ASSP）\n\nNetwork cameras (System device)\n\nDigital image transmission servers (System device)\n\nDigital video recorders (System device)\n\nWireless intercom (world’s first wireless LAN in 2007)\n\nJPEG XR IP (World’s first in 2009)\n\nMultimedia processing LSIs for 3G cell phones\n\nLSI for single-lens reflex digital cameras\n\nLSI for 1seg\n\nModule for 1seg\n\nNetwork cameras\n\nDigital image transmission servers\n\n2013-\n\nDawn of the IoT era. Age of system LSIs expansion of application fields\n\nExpansion to Global Market Focusing on IoT\n\nGlobal Activities\n\n2013“Industry 4.0”, German domestic organization implementation accord\n\n2014Start of driverless car on public road tests in U.S.\n\n2016Announcement of Japanese government’s “Society 5.0” policy\n\nMegaChips’ Activities\n\n2013Management integration with Kawasaki Microelectronics\n\n2013MegaChips Taiwan Corporation was established as regional headquarters\n\nWith the merger of Kawasaki Microelectronics, Inc., in April 2013, MegaChips took its first step toward globalization. Although MegaChips had consistently made efforts to produce products for its Japanese customers by expanding the business, prior to the merger, using Kawasaki Microelectronics’ global network gave a boost to the globalization of MegaChips’ sales, marketing and development. In addition, by fusing the digital and analog technologies which were strong points of both companies and adding competitive ASSP products to the product portfolio through, among other things, global M&A, MegaChips responded quickly to the burgeoning demand for IoT and expanded its business and global customer base.\n\nSynergies through Consolidation with Kawasaki Microelectronics MegaChips Kawasaki Microelectronics Technology areas Strong in\n\ndigital Strong in\n\nanalog Development process Strong in\n\nupper design Strong in\n\nphysical design Development base Japan / China / Taiwan Japan / China / India / U.S.\n\nMain Development Achievements\n\nTiming controller LSI for liquid crystal panels\n\nIntelligent sensor hub LSI\n\nFull digital video recording and transmission systems\n\nIntellectual property core and LSI for optical communications\n\nAnalog front-end LSI\n\nLSI for wired (coaxial and power line) multi-hop communications\n\nLSI for office equipment\n\nLSIs for liquid crystal panels\n\nLSI for industrial communications\n\nLSI for home networking\n\nAcquired DisplayPort business from STMicroelectronics\n\nAcquired SiTime corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary. Entered into the timing devices business\n\n2017-\n\nBusiness Expansion Focused on Industrial Equipment\n\nGlobal Activities\n\n2020Start of commercial operations of 5G services\n\nMegaChips’ Activities\n\n2017Developed high-speed wired communication LSI for in-vehicle applications\n\n2019Announced the world’s first communication technology LON HD-PLC bridge with Gesytec GmbH\n\n2020MegaChips LSI USA Corporation started a business activity as a sales base of North America\n\n2021CVC fund established by MegaChips LSI USA Corporation\n\nIn anticipation of the evolution of digital technology and the increase in volume of data communications, MegaChips has enhanced its high-speed wired technology required for large capacity and high-speed communications. We regard the industrial equipment field as future growing area with increasing “smartification”, and provide system LSIs that contribute to creating the next generation leveraging our proprietary technology."
