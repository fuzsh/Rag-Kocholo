        "text": "Historical accounts of the Internet's origins tend to emphasize U.S. government investment and university-based researchers. In contrast, this article introduces actors who have been overlooked: the entrepreneurs and private firms that developed standards, evaluated competing standards, educated consumers about the value of new products, and built products to sell. Start-up companies such as 3Com and Cisco Systems succeeded because they met rapidly rising demand from users, particularly those in large organizations, who were connecting computers into networks and networks into internetworks. We consider a relatively brief yet dynamic period, from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, when regulators attacked incumbent American firms, entrepreneurs flourished in new market niches, and engineers set industry standards for networking and internetworking. As a consequence, their combined efforts forged new processes and institutions for so-called open standards that, in turn, created the conditions favorable for the “network effects” that sustained the formative years of the digital economy.\n\n1 On the history of Internet standards, see Abbate, Janet, Inventing the Internet (Cambridge, MA, 1999)Google Scholar; Abbate, “Government, Business, and the Making of the Internet,” Business History Review 75, no. 1 (2001): 147–76; Burg, Urs von, The Triumph of Ethernet (Stanford, 2002)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Campbell-Kelly, Martin and Garcia-Swartz, Daniel D., “The History of the Internet: The Missing Narratives,” Journal of Information Technology 28, no. 1 (2013): 18–33CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Russell, Andrew L., Open Standards and the Digital Age (Cambridge, U.K., 2014)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; DeNardis, Laura, Protocol Politics (Cambridge, MA, 2014)Google Scholar; Greenstein, Shane, How the Internet Became Commercial (Princeton, 2015)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Yates, JoAnne and Murphy, Craig N., Engineering Rules: Global Standard Setting since 1880 (Baltimore, 2019)CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n2 A leading text describes network effects as follows: “other things being equal, it's better to be connected to a bigger network than to a smaller one.” See Shapiro, Carl and Varian, Hal R., Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy (Boston, 1998), 173–226Google Scholar. Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet who plays a prominent role in several parts of our story, also invented “Metcalfe's law,” the idea that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. See Metcalfe, Robert, “Metcalfe's Law after 40 Years of Ethernet,” Computer 46, no. 12 (2013): 26–31CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Rohlfs, Jeffrey, “A Theory of Interdependent Demand for a Communications Service,” Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science 5, no. 1 (1974): 16–37Google Scholar.\n\n3 James L.

Once a dominant design emerges, future technological progress consists of incremental improvements elaborating the standard and the technological regime becomes more orderly as one design becomes its standard expression” (p. 613).\n\n12 Galambos, Louis and Amatori, Franco, “The Entrepreneurial Multiplier Effect,” Enterprise & Society 17 no. 4 (2016): 763–808CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Gawer, Annabelle and Cusumano, Michael A., “Industry Platforms and Ecosystem Innovation,” Journal of Product Innovation Management 31, no. 3 (2014): 417–33CrossRefGoogle Scholar.

It was clear that the only way to make floating-point work was to have a standard, because everybody was doing it differently, and if you wanted to sell a lot of the same chip, you had to have a standard. . . . The PCs were taking off, and local area networks of some kind were going to be pervasive.” Kaufman, oral history interview by James L. Pelkey, 17 June 1988, Campbell, CA, CHM, https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/05/102746652-05-01-acc.pdf.\n\n39 Branscomb, Lewis and Kahin, Brian, “Standards Processes and Objectives for the National Information Infrastructure,” in Standards Policy for Information Infrastructure, ed.

Russell, “Dot-Org Entrepreneurship: Weaving a Web of Trust,” Enterprises et Histoire, no. 51 (June 2008): 44–56.\n\n48 Standards insiders consistently worry about the various ways that companies can “capture” standards bodies and steer outcomes of standards processes toward their own proprietary ends. See, for example, Paul Kunert, “Open letter to Internet Engineering Task Force: Back Off Cisco, Not All Members Want to ‘Play to Your Tune,’” The Register, 17 Apr. 2020, https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/17/open_letter_to_internet_engineering/.\n\n51 Sales numbers reveal their changing fortunes: 3Com had sales of $723 million in 1993, compared with $649 million for Cisco. However, by 1996, Cisco was almost twice the size of 3Com ($4.1 billion versus $2.3 billion), and by 2001, Cisco was more than nine times bigger ($22.3 billion versus $2.4 billion). By 2004, Cisco was roughly twenty times bigger: $18.9 billion versus $932 million.
