        "text": "In the early 2010s, the Japanese semiconductor industry was in decline due to a long period of stagnant performance. Students were being discouraged from undertaking electronics and engineering studies and finding employment in semiconductor-related companies. Facing this reality, Advantest realized that unless we could build a foundation and acquire human capital for the continued growth of the semiconductor industry, it would be difficult for us to sustain our own growth. That aim drives our support for the Power Device Enabling Association (PDEA)which was established in 2012 in anticipation of growing demand for power devices*, from the conceptual stage, and we have been working with car manufacturers, electronic device manufacturers, semiconductor manufactures, and public organizations under the auspices of the PDEA over the past 10 years.\n\nWhen the PDEA launched its“ Semiconductor Engineer Career Certification ” in 2014, we published “Measuring × Understanding Semiconductor,” a series of three textbooks that enables comprehensive study of semiconductor fundamentals, development, manufacturing, testing, and quality assurance, to support people preparing for this examination. Although these materials were mainly aimed at engineers involved in semiconductor design, manufacturing, testing, quality assurance, in recent years, demand from learners in their 20s and 30s is increasing on account of changes in the semiconductor industry environment. The textbooks have also been adopted in special curricula at technical high schools and technical colleges in Kumamoto Prefecture, as well as in the education of new employees at major device manufacturers. Furthermore, these educational materials may enjoy even wider adoption in future, as evidenced by the joint seminars held using “Measuring × Understanding Semiconductor” in cooperation with affiliated organizations such as SEMI Japan, Kitakyushu Foundation for the Advancement of Industry, Science and Technology (FAIS), and Oita LSI Cluster Promotion Council.\n\nAdvantest will continue to focus on developing future talent with the aim of continuously developing and building a foundation for the semiconductor industry.\n\nWe have installed an interactive globe at Advantest's Gunma R&D Center, displaying real-time Earth data, for use in environmental education for children who, we believe, are the generations that will bear the responsibility of shaping the world's future, our employees, and our stakeholders. This tool not only allows us to learn about global atmospheric temperature changes, but also about the past, present, and future of the Earth.\n\nIn FY2022, this globe was also set up in the ESG corner of our booth at SEMICON Japan, a premier international exhibition offering latest insights into semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials. It was well received by our visitors and provided an opportunity to discuss various social issues such as climate change. Likewise, we used the globe for environmental learning during the training of new employees in FY2023, following on from FY2022. We will continue to make effective use of this tool for environmental learning for a wide range of our stakeholders.\n\nUnder the theme of \"Social Contribution\", Advantest (China) Co., Ltd. continuously strengthen the collaboration with universities and research institutes to develop talents for IC industry, especially on their IC test knowledge, even amid the COVID-19 pandemic and also in the post pandemic era.\n\nIn 2022, our engineers, together with our partners (from universities, research institutes, and private companies), carried out IC test trainings online 3 times, covering more than 90 trainees. Also, we developed a new partnership with a university and opened \"CloudTesting™ Service based IC test fundamental\" class.\n\nIn 2023, we visited several universities and invited the professors to our office to discuss new collaboration opportunities. As of May 2023, we opened IC test classes in 3 universities for more than 60 students. We also have a busy worklist for near future; prepare seminar with professors focusing on IC test class setup in universities, develop more partner universities and look for various collaboration models."
