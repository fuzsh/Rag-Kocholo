        "text": "The Google Legal Team is proud to host the US Google Legal Summer Institute (LSI)!\n\nLSI aims to improve access to in-house careers at tech companies by expanding opportunities and removing barriers in the legal industry.\n\nThe Google Legal Summer Institute is a unique experience where 2L law school students are invited to spend one immersive week on Googleâs campus as well as a full summer associateship with one of LSIâs partner law firms. Google welcomes applications from candidates from all backgrounds, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability status, or any other dimension of diversity.\n\nLSI scholars are a diverse group of students with interests across all legal practice areas. We consider full-time and part-time 2L students who are attending schools in the region of their applied program. Students who (1) have demonstrated a commitment to diversity and a culture of inclusion; (2) have faced and overcome adversity; or (3) identify with a group that is historically underrepresented in the technology industry, including but not limited to the following: Black+, Latinx, Native American, LGBTQ+, students with disabilities and veterans, are especially encouraged to apply.\n\nObjectives\n\nLSI measures success through four objectives:\n\nProviding scholars with summer associateships at prestigious law firms\n\nProviding early exposure to in-house careers at Google for students underrepresented in the legal field\n\nSharing information across the corporate sector regarding best practices to develop a legal internship program that prioritizes underrepresented talent\n\nImproving diversity within law firms, especially Googleâs outside counsel\n\nLSI scholars will participate in Googleâs learning and development culture through a week of dynamic and skill-based learning opportunities to enhance their legal skillset.\n\nLaw firm participation\n\nLSI is a paid opportunity and we request that all participating partner firms pay LSI scholars the same weekly rate as their other summer associates for the week at Google and the full summer program with the participating law firm.\n\nThere are no specific requirements regarding scholarsâ law firm work assignments, however we recommend that assignments provide a good balance of quality and quantity and contain substance and variety.\n\nOffice placement location will be at the discretion of the law firm and the student.\n\nMentorship\n\nThe program enables LSI scholars to develop their networking skills by connecting with and investing in a mentor. A Google mentor is an unbiased resource, untied to the scholarâs work, who will aid in the scholarâs development by expanding their Googler network, providing legal career advice, sharing insight into outside counsel firms and building an authentic relationship.\n\nExposure\n\nThe LSI team facilitates candid conversations with top legal leaders throughout their week at Google. Past speakers include Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google General Counsel, and Kent Walker, Google Chief Legal Officer.\n\nCommunity and diversity\n\nLSI scholars and Google Legal Team members are able to pursue interests and participate in the companyâs inclusive culture, in which everyone is a direct contributor and encouraged to share ideas and opinions. Scholars, who represent a diverse set of backgrounds and have an array of unique skills, are encouraged to engage with and learn from Googlers through workshops and social events throughout the week at Google."
