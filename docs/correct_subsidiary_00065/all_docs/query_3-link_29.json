Broadcom Limited SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 23 SWOT Analysis SWOT ANALYSIS Broadcom Limited (Broadcom) is a developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. The company's strong focus on innovation and research and development (R&D) provides a competitive advantage by enabling it to launch products that effectively enhance revenues and market share. However, intense competition may adversely affect the company's market share and revenues in the coming years. Strength Strong Financial Performance Global Footprint Strong Focus on R&D Weakness Concentrated Customer Base Opportunity Growing LTE Adoption Positive Outlook for Mobile Phones Market Positive Outlook for Semiconductor Market Threat Dependence on Contract Manufacturing and Outsourcing of Supply Chain Short Life Cycles and Rapid Technological Changes Intense Competition Strength Strong Financial Performance Broadcom exhibited an increase in the financial performance in FY2017. Strong financial performance enables the company’s ability to provide higher returns to its shareholders and also increases its ability to allocate adequate funds for future growth initiatives. In FY2017, the company generated revenues of US$17,636 million as compared to US$13,240 million in FY2016, with an annual growth of 33.2% over FY2016. The increase in annual revenue was primarily due to the full year contribution from acquired BRCM products, as well as strong organic year­over­year growth. The company reported an operating income of US$2,217 million as compared to an operating loss of US$532 million in FY2016. The company reported a net income of US$1,692 million in FY2017 as compared to a net loss of US$1,739 million in FY2016. Global Footprint Broadcom has a diversified global presence. The company through its design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies is well positioned to serve its customers globally. Broadcom has a number of sales offices located in various countries, with a significant presence in Asia, which is a key center of the worldwide electronics supply chain. Many of the company's customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. In addition, the company has regional customer support call centers, where the company addresses customer issues and handle logistics and\n\n24. Broadcom Limited SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 24 other order fulfillment requirements. In addition, the company witnessed strong growth across all geographic markets. For instance in FY2017, China, Broadcom’s largest geographic market witnessed a growth of 31.7% over FY2016. Furthermore, revenues from the US, Singapore and Other geographies grew by 12.6%, 29.2%, and 40.7%, respectively. The company's widespread footprint reduces its exposure to risks associated with operating in a particular market. It also provides Broadcom with benefits such as cost reductions through economies of scale. In addition, this geographic diversity provides proximity to customers, enabling the development of close relationships. Strong Focus on R&D Broadcom is committed to continuous investment in product development, with a focus on introducing new, proprietary products. The company’s research and development (R&D) efforts allowed it to develop several innovative products, which provided it with significant competitive advantages in certain target markets. Broadcom has a history of developing innovative technologies. Strong focus on R&D has allowed the company to develop innovative, sustainable and higher value product platforms which provided significant competitive advantages over its peers. In addition, continuous introduction of products allowed Broadcom to build strong reputation in the market. As of October 2017, Broadcom had 24,250 US and other patents and 2,061 US and other pending patent applications. It is working on approximately 150 new patent applications per year, related to a wide range of ASIC, isolation, encoder, LED, RF and optoelectronic components, enterprise storage products, HDD silicon, PCIe, USB and other standard I/O devices, Ethernet and Fibre­Channel connectivity and controllers, set­top box SoCs, cable modem SoCs, broadband access SoCs, wireless connectivity SoCs, switching/routing SoCs, high performance processor SoCs and associated applications. Continued innovation and reputation will allow the company to earn attractive margins by developing high value­add products. Weakness Concentrated Customer Base The company has highly concentrated customer base. It is dependent on reasonably small number of direct customers, OEMs, contract manufacturers and distributors for a majority of its business, revenue and results of operations. In FY2017, direct sales to Foxconn accounted for 14% of the company’s net revenue and top five direct customers, through all channels, collectively accounted for 40% of net revenue. Also, the company’s aggregate sales to Apple when Broadcom’s direct sales to it are combined with sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 20% of the company’s net revenue. The customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in the operating results and sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by the company's significant customers. Opportunity Growing LTE Adoption The outlook for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) adoption is robust primarily due to the increased demand\n\n25. Broadcom Limited SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 25 for faster data rates and better spectral efficiency in the wake of heavy data usage, increased penetration of smart devices and the demand for quality services on the move. The growth in the market is further enhanced by the planned large­scale adoption of LTE by operators in the Asia Pacific regions, primarily China. According to MarketLine, the number of LTE subscribers reached 2.6 billion in 2016 and is forecasted to reach 4.9 billion by the end of 2022 growing at a CAGR of 17.2%. Broadcom is keen to enhance its market share in the growing LTE market. The company's wireless communications business offers a variety of RF semiconductor devices, including FEMs, duplexers and multiplexers. The company also provides a variety of optoelectronic sensors for mobile handset applications. The company's robust LTE portfolio coupled with strong growth in the end market would provide incremental growth opportunities to enhance its revenues and market share in the coming years. Positive Outlook for Mobile Phones Market The mobile phones market is expected to grow at a robust pace in the near future. According to MarketLine, the global mobile phones market grew by 2.3% in 2017 to reach a value of US$315.1 billion. Furthermore, the industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.0% for the 2017–22 period to reach a value of approximately US$346.6 billion in 2022. Key products offered by Broadcom for the smartphone market include RF power amplifiers, RF filters, RF FEMs, ambient light sensors and proximity sensors. Robust outlook for the smartphone market is expected to further boost the demand for the company's solutions thus increasing its sales in the coming years. Positive Outlook for Semiconductor Market Broadcom is one of the leading suppliers of semiconductor services globally. Strong growth prospect for the semiconductor industry could bring new growth avenue to the company. Concept of Internet of Things along with increasing demand for next generation of interconnected devices driving the growth for semiconductor market. Growing usage of mobile devices is acting as major catalyst for the market growth. According to MarketLine, the global semiconductors market reached a value of US$423.6 billion in 2017. Furthermore, the industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 32.7% for the 2017–22 period to reach a value of approximately US$562.0 billion in 2022. Broadcomm is poised to benefit from this growth. Threat Dependence on Contract Manufacturing and Outsourcing of Supply Chain The company operates an outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third­party wafer foundry and module assembly and test capabilities. As a result, Broadcom is highly reliant on third­ party foundry wafer fabrication capacity, including single­sourcing for many components or products. Most of its products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular foundry. The company also uses third­party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of assembly and test operations, including ASE Korea, Amkor Technology, Siliconware Precision Industries, UTAC Holdings, King Yuan Electronics and Inari Technology SDN. The ability and willingness of the contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside the control of the company. If one or more of its contract manufacturers or other outsourced providers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at\n\n26. Broadcom Limited SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 26 satisfactory quality levels, Broadcom's ability to bring products to market could suffer, thus affecting its reputation. Moreover, the company does not have any long­term supply contracts with its contract manufacturers or materials suppliers and may not be able to obtain the products or raw materials required for its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Broadcom purchases a significant portion of its semiconductor materials and finished goods from a few materials providers and single source suppliers. The company's dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing of supply chain may adversely affect Broadcom's ability to bring products to market and damage its reputation. Additionally, it may also impair the company's ability to operate effectively. Short Life Cycles and Rapid Technological Changes The semiconductor industry is characterized with short life cycles and rapid technological changes. The advancements in the field will lead to higher substitutions and therefore products in the industry suffer short life cycles. Rapid changes in demand for its products reduce Broadcom’s ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of its customers. The company will find it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. Replacing the production processes can result in inefficiencies and costs due to capacity constraints for new technology. Furthermore, the company has to make substantial investments in the development of capabilities, in resources such as R&D, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements. Due to these investments, the profitability of operations generally lags the sales by considerable time. Fast pace of technology displacement will not give sufficient time to absorb the investments and will lead to lower profitability of operations. Short life cycles associated with end markets tend to impact the profitability of the company's operations. Rapid technological changes require high R&D investments and if the company is unable to commercialize new products, Broadcom will experience significant loss on invested capital. In addition, in an industry with such rapid changes, the company is constantly under the threat from its competitors developing technological advances faster. Intense Competition The global semiconductor industry is highly competitive. The company's competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in niche markets. Broadcom competes with integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. The company competes on the basis of quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system­level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support. In the wireless communications market, the company primarily competes with Murata Manufacturing, Qorvo, Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions and TDK­EPC. Broadcom competes based on its expertise in amplifier design, FBAR technology, module integration and proprietary material processes. In the wired infrastructure market, the company competes with Cavium, Intel, Finisar, GlobalFoundries, HiSilicon Technologies, Lumentum Operations, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Marvell, Mediatek, Mellanox Technologies, Mitsubishi Electric, NXP Semiconductors, Quantenna, ST Microelectronics and Sumitomo. In addition, the company competes with Marvell Technology Group, Microsemi and Texas Instruments in the enterprise storage segment. Furthermore, in the industrial and other markets, the company competes with Analog Devices, Cree, Hamamatsu Photonics, Heidenhain, Renesas Electronics and Toshiba. Also, several of the company's competitors are well established, have a more extensive product portfolio, substantially\n\n27. Broadcom Limited SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 27 greater market share, and manufacturing, financial, R&D and marketing resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. In addition, several of the company's competitors have longer independent operating histories, greater presence in key markets, larger customer base or more comprehensive patent protection. The competition in the markets in which the company operates is expected to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market. Intense competition may adversely impact the company's market share and revenues in the coming years.\n\n28.

Broadcom Limited Company View Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 29 Company View COMPANY VIEW An excerpt from the 'Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' section is given below. The statement has been taken from the company's 10­K filing for FY2017. Fiscal Year Highlights Highlights during fiscal year 2017 include the following: Our cash and cash equivalents were $11,204 million at October 29, 2017, compared with $3,097 million at October 30, 2016, which primarily included the net proceeds from the issuance of the October 2017 Senior Notes (defined below). We generated $6,551 million of cash from operations during fiscal year 2017. Broadcom paid aggregate cash dividends on its ordinary shares of $1,653 million, and the Partnership made aggregate distributions of $92 million on its Partnership REUs during fiscal year 2017. On January 19, 2017, we completed the issuance and sale of senior unsecured notes, or the January 2017 Senior Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $13,550 million. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to repay all of the outstanding term loans under our guaranteed, collateralized credit agreement entered into on February 1, 2016, or the 2016 Credit Agreement, in the aggregate amount of $13,555 million. In addition, on October 17, 2017, we completed the issuance and sale of senior unsecured notes, or the October 2017 Senior Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $4,000 million. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to finance the acquisition of Brocade Communication Systems, Inc., or Brocade, as discussed in detail below. Recent Developments U.S. 2017 Tax Reform Act On December 20, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Reform Act, was approved by Congress and is pending presidential approval. In general, the 2017 Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective in 2018. The 2017 Tax Reform Act moves from worldwide business taxation to a participation exemption regime. The 2017 Tax Reform Act also imposes base­erosion prevention measures on non­U.S. earnings of U.S. entities, as well as a one­time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non­U.S. earnings of U.S. entities. The base­erosion prevention measures will have the effect of subjecting non­U.S. earnings of U.S. entities to taxation in the United States at an effective rate that is expected to be substantially lower than 21%. The 2017 Tax Reform Act will affect the tax position and cash taxes of our U.S. entities and will have a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. On November 17, 2017, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Broadcom, BRCM, Brocade, and Bobcat Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, which BRCM subsequently assigned to LSI Corporation on December 18, 2016, Merger Sub merged with and into Brocade with Brocade as the\n\n30. Broadcom Limited Company View Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 30 surviving corporation, or the Brocade Merger. As a result, Brocade stockholders who did not perfect their appraisal rights with respect to the Brocade Merger received, in aggregate, approximately $5.3 billion in cash in exchange for all shares of Brocade common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Brocade Merger. We also paid $701 million to retire Brocade’s term loan. In addition, we assumed certain vested (to the extent not in­the­money) and all unvested Brocade stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, held by continuing employees and service providers. All vested in­the­money Brocade stock options, after giving effect to any acceleration, and all other RSUs and PSUs were cashed out upon the Brocade Merger. As a result of the Brocade Merger, Brocade became an indirect subsidiary of the Partnership. We financed the Brocade Merger with the net proceeds from the October 2017 Senior Notes as discussed in further detail below under “Indebtedness,” as well as cash on hand. Divestiture of Brocade’s IP Networking Business Following the Brocade Merger, on December 1, 2017, we sold Brocade’s IP Networking business, including the Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch businesses, to ARRIS International plc for cash consideration of $800 million, plus unvested assumed employee stock awards. Proposed Acquisition of Qualcomm Incorporated On November 6, 2017, we announced a proposal to acquire Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, for $70.00 per share, consisting of $60.00 in cash and $10.00 in Broadcom ordinary shares. We stated that the proposal stands whether Qualcomm’s pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V., or NXP, is consummated on the then­disclosed terms of $110.00 per NXP share or is terminated. Including the assumption of net debt and giving effect to the pending NXP acquisition, the enterprise value of the proposed transaction is approximately $130 billion. On November 13, 2017, Qualcomm’s board of directors rejected our proposal. In response, we announced that we remained fully committed to pursuing the acquisition of Qualcomm and reiterated our proposal. On December 4, 2017, we announced that we had provided notice to Qualcomm of our intent to nominate 11 candidates for election to the Qualcomm board of directors at Qualcomm’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. On December 11, 2017, we filed preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, in connection with our planned solicitation of proxies to elect 11 independent, highly qualified nominees to the Qualcomm board of directors at Qualcomm’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, which Qualcomm has announced will be held on March 6, 2018. We also filed a premerger notification under the Hart­Scott­Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission regarding our proposed acquisition of Qualcomm. No agreement has been reached with Qualcomm and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from our proposal. Redomiciliation to the United States from Singapore On November 2, 2017, we announced our intention to initiate a process to change the ultimate parent company of the Broadcom group from a Singapore company to a U.S. corporation. The final form and timing of the redomiciliation has not yet been finalized and may be affected by the implementation of the\n\n31. Broadcom Limited Company View Broadcom Limited © MarketLine Page 31 2017 Tax Reform Act. In addition, the redomiciliation is subject to the approval of our shareholders. We presently expect that our overall cash tax costs will approximately double, as compared to our fiscal year 2017 results, due to the redomiciliation and taking in account our initial estimates of the expected effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. Acquisitions and Divestitures The discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Broadcom Corporation On February 1, 2016, Broadcom became the successor to Avago and acquired BRCM, or the Broadcom Merger, in which, Avago shareholders exchanged their shares on a one­for­one basis for newly issued Broadcom ordinary shares and BRCM shareholders received, in aggregate, approximately $16.8 billion in cash, 112 million Broadcom ordinary shares and 23 million Partnership REUs in exchange for all shares of BRCM common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Broadcom Merger. In addition, we also paid $137 million in cash for vested BRCM equity awards. Broadcom also assumed unvested RSUs originally granted by BRCM and converted them into 6 million Broadcom RSUs. The aggregate consideration for the Broadcom Merger was approximately $35.7 billion. We funded the cash portion of the Broadcom Merger with net proceeds from the issuance of $15.6 billion in term loans under the 2016 Credit Agreement, that we entered into at the time of closing of the Broadcom Merger, as well as cash on hand of the combined companies. The financial results provided in this Annual Report on Form 10­K include the results of operations of BRCM commencing as of February 1, 2016, or the Acquisition Date. During fiscal year 2016, we completed the sales of certain non­core BRCM businesses for aggregate cash proceeds of $830 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $36 million from the sales. Emulex Corporation In fiscal year 2015, we acquired Emulex Corporation, or Emulex, a leader in network connectivity, monitoring and management, for a purchase price of $587 million.\n\n32.
