        "text": "3\n\nForeign Direct Investment and the U.S.-Japan Economic and Technological Relationship\n\nThe U.S.-Japan economic and technological relationship is marked by dynamism and increasingly intense competition and cooperation. Nonetheless, patterns of interaction at the levels of the macroeconomy and individual corporate decisions reflect structural features of the economies and business systems of the two countries that often have deep historical roots. Policies and corporate strategies toward foreign direct investment (FDI) in both countries have played a major role in shaping this structural context. In order to make sense of where the relationship is today and where it might be headed, we need a clear understanding of this historical legacy.\n\nTHE PRE WORLD WAR II PERIOD\n\nEven prior to World War II, the United States generally maintained an open environment for foreign direct investment. In contrast, Japan 's history includes both periods of severe restrictions on FDI and periods in which foreign manufacturing investments that upgraded indigenous technological capabilities were tolerated or encouraged.\n\nHistorically, American and Japanese approaches to inward FDI or investment made with the goal of establishing or gaining control over a foreign business entity have been marked by significant contrasts. FDI and foreign investment in general were important factors in U.S. economic growth throughout the nineteenth century, as the United States emerged as an advanced industrial power.1 In 1914 the United States was the leading host country for the FDI of foreign MNCs, as measured by the estimated accumulated value of global FDI stocks.2\n\nJapan has exhibited a different approach. Even as early as the second half of the sixteenth century, when a growing Western trading and missionary presence in Japan coincided with a series of wars that led to political unification of the country, Japanese craftsmen exhibited an ability to acquire and improve technology imported by the international businesses of that time: The Portuguese traders. For example, even though Arabs, Indians, Chinese, and Native Americans had been exposed to Western firearms long before, only the Japanese proved able to master the technology and launch indigenous mass production of guns.3 Early MNCs, such as the British East India Company, experienced great difficulty in penetrating the Japanese market.4\n\nIn the seventeenth century Japan closed off contact with all Western traders except for a small Dutch mission located on an island near Nagasaki. Japan maintained this policy of sakoku (closed country) for two centuries, ending it in the late nineteenth century when foreign traders were allowed to establish operations in several designated port settlements, although foreign investment continued to be limited severely elsewhere. Under the “unequal treaties ” imposed by\n\nWestern powers at that time, the foreign signatories enjoyed extraterritorial legal authority in these settlements, and Japan's authority to set its own tariffs was limited.5\n\nJapan liberalized treatment of foreign investment somewhat in 1899, with the revision of the unequal treaties. Although restrictions remained—for example, foreigners were not allowed to own land in Japan until 1926—the 1899 to 1930 period was marked by a relatively open stance on the part of the Japanese government and private sector toward FDI. This reflected recognition in Japan of the need to attract greater inflows of foreign capital and technology to support rapid economic development. U.S.-based high-technology companies of the time, such as Victor Talking Machine, Western Electric, and Ford Motor Company, invested in Japan, often with Japanese partners, and achieved great success. But, even during this period, characterized by one scholar as the “door ajar,” FDI in Japan was rather low in comparative international terms: FDI stocks in China were roughly 20 times those of Japan in 1930.6\n\nWhile American and other foreign multinationals were establishing positions in Japan early in this century, Japanese companies, such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd., and Mitsui Bussan, were establishing their first U.S. subsidiaries. In contrast to investments in Japan by foreign MNCs, many of which involved local manufacturing with extensive training and technology transfer, Japan's prewar FDI by banks and trading companies was focused on facilitating and controlling the flow and financing of Japan's imports and exports. For example, Japanese flag carriers transported two-thirds of Japan's imports and three-quarters of Japan's exports during the 1930s.7 Much of Japan's manufacturing FDI was directed at China.\n\nBy the 1930s Japanese industry had made significant strides in international competitiveness, and the Japanese economy maintained solid growth throughout the prewar decade. Although the economic environment provided foreign investors with ample incentive to invest, increasingly restrictive Japanese government policies, often strongly influenced by the private sector, discouraged new investments and forced most American companies already operating in Japan to withdraw.8 The outbreak of World War II marked a complete suspension in bilateral commercial relations, as enemy MNC assets were seized by both governments.\n\nU.S. MNCS IN JAPAN\n\nSince World War II formal and informal restrictions on imports and inward direct investment have depressed foreign participation in the Japanese economy. However, during the 1950 to 1980 period, a number of U.S. companies with superior technology, management, and the ability to mobilize political support in the Japanese business community overcame these obstacles and achieved long-term success. But in many instances the preference of Japanese government and industry for arms-length technology transfers in lieu of product imports or FDI prevailed. Although U.S. FDI in Japan has increased since barriers were lowered (particularly since 1980), foreign participation in the Japanese economy through FDI and direct imports remains low.\n\nIn Japan the policy framework for the regulation of FDI was established in two laws enacted during the U.S. Occupation but that continued in force with only minor modifications for the following two decades. The Foreign Investment Law (FIL) of 1950 regulated the acquisition, by foreign investors, of stocks and proprietary interests in Japan; required validation of technological assistance contracts longer than 1 year; and controlled loans between foreign investors and Japanese persons, where foreign exchange was a consideration.9 The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law (FECL) of 1949 governed international transactions\n\noutside the FIL framework: specified transactions were prohibited without explicit government approval.10\n\nAlthough the Foreign Investment Deliberation Council formally made decisions to grant or deny FIL approval, Japanese business, mediated through the Japanese government agency with jurisdiction over the industry in question, was central to the decision-making process.11 Most companies of whatever nationality with strong market positions are not eager to see powerful new entrants, and Japanese companies appear to be no different. During the period when FIL was in effect, Japanese companies often were able to act on these preferences and influence the process so that approvals were very difficult to achieve.\n\nFor foreign companies seeking to invest in Japan and to profit from its strong economic growth, enlisting powerful Japanese domestic allies often was necessary to achieve meaningful participation.12 For example, Coca-Cola was allowed to establish a Japanese franchise in 1956, but opposition by small Japanese fruit juice bottlers—financed by larger soft drink makers, such as Kirin, Asahi, and Sapporo—led to severe restrictions on Coke's operations.13 Several years later Shin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (now Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, MHI), which had begun manufacturing Coca-Cola' s Japanese bottling equipment under license, saw that it would benefit from an expansion of Coke's presence in Japan. MHI, therefore, encouraged Kirin to negotiate an arrangement with Coca-Cola under which Kirin would own a majority share of the largest Coke franchise in Japan. At the same time, the government removed the most onerous restrictions on Coke's activities.\n\nThe case of Texas Instruments (TI) is similar.14 TI had begun exploring the possibility of manufacturing in Japan in the late 1950s and decided to move forward in the early 1960s. The approval for TI's investment came only after years of effort and was prompted by the growing strength of the domestic semiconductor industry. When Japanese companies began integrated circuit production in the early 1960s, Japan had not issued patents for TI's basic technologies and would not do so until 1989. Japanese companies, therefore, did not need to be concerned about infringement suits on Japanese sales. However, by the late 1960s the Japanese electronics industry had become strong enough to anticipate export sales, particularly indirect exports, as integrated circuits came to be incorporated in consumer electronics products. Since TI had been granted patents in the United States and other major markets outside Japan, infringing chips or products incorporating them could be excluded from these markets. Eager to reach licensing agreements with TI that would allow them to enter the export market, the major Japanese electronics companies pushed the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to reach agreement with TI in 1968.\n\nThese Japanese policies toward FDI, implemented through close government-industry cooperation, made an important contribution to nurturing Japan's high-technology and other manufacturing industries. First, FDI and overall market restrictions gave Japanese companies time to hone their competitiveness to world-class levels before having to face foreign competitors in export markets. Second, and perhaps more important, the policies facilitated a substantial flow of inexpensive foreign technology into Japan and ensured that this technology was widely disseminated.\n\nMost analysts and scholars studying the Japanese economy agree that imported technology has had a major impact on Japan's overall economic development. Some have asserted that a lack of effort and interest on the part of U.S. and other foreign companies was mainly responsible for the high level of licensing and the low level of direct investment by foreign companies over the postwar period.15 However, recently, most scholars studying the development of key Japanese industries support the assertion that public-private cooperation in dealing with foreign MNCs was critical in facilitating a greater arms-length flow of technology into Japan.16\n\nRecognition of the importance of imported technology to Japan should in no way be interpreted as slighting the central contribution of Japanese firms in achieving the nation's current status as a techno-industrial superpower. Scholars nearly unanimously agree that superior management of the Japanese macroeconomy and individual firms was responsible for the rapid assimilation and utilization of this imported technology by Japanese companies.17\n\nRare foreign MNCs with an especially strong technological position and political acumen, such as IBM, were able to use their leverage to gain approval for establishing and expanding wholly owned manufacturing subsidiaries, often on the condition that key technologies be licensed to Japanese competitors.18 Other strong companies, such as Du Pont, were allowed to establish 50-50 or minority-owned joint ventures during the 1950s and 1960s.19 Companies without the technology or political clout to achieve even limited entry through joint ventures were left with technology licensing as the most feasible way of gaining a return in Japan on their technological investments. Fairchild, after being rebuffed when it sought to establish operations in Japan in the late 1950s, licensed its fundamental planar process for integrated circuit manufacturing to NEC.20 In the Fairchild case, as well as other critical technologies, there is evidence that MITI's role in approving licensing arrangements allowed Japanese firms to negotiate lower royalties with foreign companies than would have been the case had they acted on their own.21\n\nThrough a long, gradual process that began in the late 1960s and continued through 1980, Japan lowered its formal restrictions on FDI. During the early phases of capital liberalization, the Japanese government issued lists of industries in which FDI would be approved automatically. However, the number of liberalized industries was limited, and included several that were unlikely to attract the interest of foreign MNCs, such as soy sauce and geta(traditional Japanese shoes).22 More substantial liberalization steps followed in the early 1970s; U.S. auto makers were allowed to acquire minority stakes in several troubled Japanese auto companies at that time. In May of 1973, MNCs were given automatic approval of new wholly owned subsidiaries in all but 22 exempted industries. Foreigners also were allowed to acquire existing Japanese companies if the target company agreed to the takeover. Still, Japanese government and industry retained considerable power to limit or delay the entry of MNCs they considered threatening during the 1970s. Computers, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors were included among the 22 industries exempted from liberalization, and private sector arrangements, such as increases in cross-shareholding were undertaken by Japanese companies to forestall possible foreign acquisition.23 In 1980 Japan abolished the FIL and incorporated residual controls in a new FECL. Under this law foreign MNCs had only to notify the Japanese government of investment plans rather than seek approval, and the ban on hostile takeovers was removed.24 In recent years the Japanese government has even instituted some modest measures to encourage FDI in Japan25 (see Figure 3-1 ).\n\nU.S. FDI in Japan has increased, following the final stages of liberalization, and Japan is now one of the top five host countries for U.S. FDI (see Table 3-1 ). In manufacturing investments, chemical and pharmaceutical MNCs have been among the leading sectors.26 For example, U.S. pharmaceutical maker Merck acquired a majority stake in long-time joint venture partner Banyu. Also, several large U.S.-Japan joint ventures in semiconductor manufacturing were launched following the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement in 1986, including the Tohoku Semiconductor joint venture between Toshiba and Motorola and the Nihon Semiconductor joint venture between LSI Logic and Kawasaki Steel.27 A growing number of U.S. companies have established successful businesses in Japan through direct investment and by other means.\n\nthe general desire of the best new graduates to avoid employment with any but the strongest blue-chip Japanese companies. Third, although policies directly affecting FDI have been liberalized, formal regulations and informal business entry barriers—mainly in the form of administrative guidance and cartels—may serve to hinder or exclude foreign entrants in specific sectors.29 These barriers can include ownership or other tight linkages among manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, and they often hinder new Japanese entrants to specific industries as well as foreign MNCs. Finally, Japan's business culture and corporate ownership patterns discourage acquisitions, which have been used by U.S. companies in other countries and by Japanese companies in the United States to achieve rapid entry.\n\nJAPANESE MNCS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nAlthough the United States remained largely open to inward FDI during the postwar period, Japanese companies did not emerge as major overseas investors until relatively recently. The sharp appreciation of the yen and other factors prompted a boom in Japanese direct investment during the latter half of the 1980s, much of it directed at the United States. Activities of Japanese and other foreign MNCs have raised concerns in the United States about the possible impacts of asymmetrical access to technological assets. Although outward Japanese FDI in the United States has fallen substantially over the last several years, Japanese MNCs will continue to maintain a significant presence in U.S. manufacturing activities and the U.S. economy as a whole.30\n\nAs might be expected of a country recovering from a devastating war, early in the postwar period Japan targeted its capital almost exclusively at domestic investment opportunities, first for rebuilding the economy and then for rapid growth. Economic policies and institutions were created to encourage savings and the flow of these savings to targeted manufacturing industries.31 The FECL that played a large part in restricting entry by foreign MNCs also restricted the outward flow of capital: individual Japanese direct investments abroad required government approval. Japanese companies mainly accessed global markets through direct exports. With strong world economic growth and access to largely open markets in the United States and elsewhere, the environment was favorable for this approach.\n\nJapan and Germany had similar levels of FDI in the United States prior to World War II, but by 1970 German FDI in the United States was six times the level of Japan's. Prior to the 1970s Japanese MNCs in the United States focused on establishing subsidiaries to market products exported from Japan or to procure food and raw materials to be shipped back to Japan for processing.32 Japanese manufacturers themselves gradually replaced trading companies in controlling this trade, establishing independent subsidiaries.33 During the 1970s and through the early 1980s, Japanese FDI in manufacturing began to increase from its low base. A number of Japanese companies in labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, moved production to Asia.34 In the United States Japanese companies began to establish manufacturing facilities, spurred by the end of fixed exchange rates and the appreciation of the yen, as well as by real or potential trade barriers. For example, pressure from U.S. producers led to voluntary restraints on Japanese exports (VERs) of steel (1969) and textiles (1971). In contrast to the gradual easing of restrictions on inward FDI, the Japanese government rapidly lifted restrictions on outward FDI in the early 1970s. Sony and Matsushita, for instance, made investments in U.S. television production before the 1977 orderly marketing agreement (OMA) restricting imports of Japanese televisions.\n\nDespite its heightened activity in manufacturing investments, much of Japan's direct investment still flowed into wholesale trade subsidiaries to distribute exports from parent companies; during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese FDI in the United States increased rapidly, along with direct Japanese exports.35 The pattern of trade barrier-avoiding FDI broadened to the automobile industry: Japanese automakers doubled their share of the U.S. market between 1978 and 1980. The recession of the early 1980s put additional pressures on U.S. automakers. In response to the threat of congressionally imposed limits on Japanese imports, MITI and the Japanese automakers agreed to voluntary limits in 1982. This VER on Japanese autos then spurred the large direct investments of Japanese automakers and their parts suppliers in the United States of the 1980s.\n\nWhen in the mid 1980s the value of the yen rose sharply and the yen price of U.S. assets dropped, Japanese MNCs had an additional incentive to invest in the United States. Table 3-2 shows the resulting rapid rise in Japanese FDI and the trend in U.S. FDI in Japan since the mid 1980s. U.S. states have competed among themselves to offer attractive incentive packages to potential Japanese investors, and over 40 states have opened offices in Japan to market themselves to Japanese MNCs.36 Table 3-3 shows changes in the long-term trend in the regional distribution of Japanese FDI, and Table 3-4 shows the industry distribution of current bilateral direct investment stocks.\n\nJapanese FDI in the United States during the late 1980s through the first few years of the 1990s can be divided into several categories, some of which are more relevant than others to technology relationships between the two countries37 The first category relevant to technology relationships consists of major manufacturing investments. Japanese FDI concentrated in the automobile, steel, and electronics industries—both end-product manufacturers and suppliers— was motivated largely by a desire to maintain access to the U.S. market in the face of actual or prospective trade restrictions. In other industries Japanese MNCs made strategic acquisitions and other investments not explicitly linked to trade frictions.38 In recent years new investment has fallen off with overall Japanese investment. For example, in some labor cost-sensitive industries, such as consumer electronics, Japanese firms are moving U.S. manufacturing to Mexico and Southeast Asia.39 Still, Japanese companies in these manufacturing industries continue to have a significant presence in the United States.\n\nTABLE 3-2 Foreign Direct Investment Positions; Historical Cost Basis, billion dollars\n\n1984\n\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n\n1988\n\n1989\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\nJapanese FDI in the United States\n\nTotal\n\n16.0\n\n19.3\n\n26.8\n\n34.4\n\n51.1\n\n67.3\n\n83.1\n\n93.8\n\n97.5\n\n96.2\n\n103.1\n\nManufacturing\n\n2.5\n\n2.7\n\n3.6\n\n5.0\n\n11.1\n\n15.6\n\n17.1\n\n18.3\n\n18.3\n\n17.7\n\n18.7\n\nU.S. FDI in Japan\n\nTotal\n\n7.9\n\n9.2\n\n11.5\n\n15.7\n\n17.9\n\n19.9\n\n22.6\n\n25.4\n\n26.6\n\n31.4\n\n37.0\n\nManufacturing\n\n3.9\n\n4.6\n\n5.4\n\n8.1\n\n8.9\n\n10.1\n\n11.2\n\n11.5\n\n11.8\n\n13.6\n\n15.8\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce data as compiled in Japan EconomicInstitute, JEI Report, various issues.\n\nThere is some consensus among analysts that this category of Japanese investments has served to transfer technology to the United States.40 The technology transferred has mainly taken the form of superior methods of managing manufacturing and other process technologies, rather than specific product technology. In the automobile industry, which has been the most extensively studied, U.S. manufacturing has benefited from the implementation of manufacturing process management techniques developed in Japan. Most of the economic benefit of this new technology appears to have been realized through imitation and adoption by U.S.-owned manufacturing enterprises, rather than directly through the activities of Japanese subsidiaries. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent to which performance improvements by U.S.-owned automakers and parts suppliers have been due to simple competitive pressure or, alternatively, whether absorption of these management practices was significantly accelerated and enhanced by the presence of Japanese transplant facilities in the United States and by exposure to Japanese techniques in such joint ventures as New United Motors Inc.—the Toyota-General Motors joint venture. We do know that U.S. automakers have made significant strides in manufacturing and product development performance as Japanese transplants have increased their presence in recent years. The same appears to be true for other U.S. manufacturing industries, such as steel, machine tools, and tires.\n\nAnother category of Japanese direct investment in the United States, with implications for technology flow between the two countries, became quite visible and common during the late 1980s. These were investments aimed at tapping U.S. technological capabilities. Such investments took two forms: (1) acquisitions or minority stakes in small, innovative U.S. companies—in industries such as computer software, electronics, and advanced materials, and (2) investments in R&D facilities—both product development-oriented facilities concentrated in the automobile and electronics industries and laboratories aimed at more fundamental computer science and biomedical research.\n\nFigure 3-2 and Table 3-5 show the extent of foreign high-technology acquisitions during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Figure 3-3 and Figure 3-4 show the nationality of foreign R&D investments in terms of facilities established and 1990 spending. Japanese MNCs have made a large proportion of both types of investment. These activities have raised concerns in the United\n\nInvestments by Japanese MNCs in U.S. high-technology companies and R&D facilities fell off with overall Japanese investment, as illustrated by Table 3-6 , but there was renewed activity in this area in 1995, as a number of large Japanese companies established new U.S. R&D facilities.42 The overall impact, in terms of the concerns expressed by critics, is unclear at this point. The flood of Japanese investments has been followed by a competitive resurgence on the part of U.S. companies in several of the industries that were targeted most heavily. Although it is relatively straightforward to link the key technologies licensed in the past by U.S. and other MNCs to Japanese industry with subsequent Japanese competitive success, it is difficult today to link technologies acquired or developed by Japanese companies through U.S. investments with subsequent market success. It is also difficult to measure the contribution of these investments to the U.S. research base and innovative activity. Particularly for the fundamental research laboratories, one of the stated objectives of Japanese MNCs in establishing them was to contribute to the U.S. research base. In the next chapter we will return to a discussion of FDI and contributions to the host country technology base.\n\nAlthough Japanese FDI in the United States has dropped considerably during the last several years, owing to the bursting of Japan's asset price bubble and to economic conditions in both countries, Japanese MNCs continue to maintain a significant presence in U.S. manufacturing activities, and they control a large proportion of U.S.-Japan trade. But despite the relative openness of the U.S. investment environment, Japanese companies have experienced a number of difficulties, particularly recently, which raises questions about how they will respond in the future. A number of Japanese subsidiaries in the United States have had difficulty in achieving profitability in recent years.43 In a survey released in 1994, Japanese MNCs mentioned several conditions that have caused difficulties;44 over half of the companies responding mentioned the harsh, competitive environment in the United States. In descending order, other problems mentioned were the strengthening of tax evasion enforcement, the difficulties in hiring labor and employing locals, and the requirements existing to source locally.45\n\nNOTES AND REFERENCES\n\n1 See Dunning, John H. 1993.
