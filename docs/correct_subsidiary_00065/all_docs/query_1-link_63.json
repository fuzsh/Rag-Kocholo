        "text": "The LSI Integrated RAID solution includes the following RAID features:\n\nIntegrated Mirroring, which provides RAID 1 features.\n\nIntegrated Mirroring and Striping, which provides RAID 10 features.\n\nIntegrated Mirroring Enhanced, which provides RAID 1 Enhanced (RAID 1E) features.\n\nIntegrated Striping, which provides RAID 0 features.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nThe LSI Fusion-MPT firmware supports Integrated Mirroring volumes, Integrated Mirroring and Striping volumes, Integrated Mirroring Enhanced volumes, and Integrated Striping volumes. You can create up to two Integrated RAID volumes on each LSI SAS2 controller.\n\nThe LSI Integrated RAID firmware uses the same device drivers as the standard LSI Fusion-MPT-based controllers, which eliminates the need for complex backup software or expensive RAID hardware. To conserve system resources, the Integrated RAID firmware operates independently from the operating system.\n\nThe LSI SAS2 BIOS Configuration Utility makes it easy to configure mirrored and striped volumes. The Integrated RAID solution is currently available as an optional component of the Fusion-MPT architecture on LSI SAS2 controllers.\n\nThe LSI Integrated RAID solution has the following features:\n\nSupport for up to ten disks per Integrated RAID volume, with one or two volumes on each SAS2 controller. Each controller can support 14 volume drives, including one or two hot spare disks\n\nSupport for two-disk Integrated Mirroring volumes (RAID 1).\n\nSupport for online capacity expansion (OCE) for RAID 1 volumes. OCE allows you to increase the size of a RAID 1 volume by replacing the disk drives with higher-capacity drives.\n\nRAID volume creation, which meets the needs of most internal RAID installations.\n\nEasy installation and configuration.\n\nSupport for booting from any kind of Integrated RAID volume.\n\nAbility to operate without special operating system-specific software.\n\nHigh reliability and data integrity as follows:\n\nNonvolatile write journaling.\n\nPhysical disks in a volume are not visible to the operating system (OS) or to application software.\n\nLow host CPU and PCI bus utilization\n\nProcessing power provided by Fusion-MPT architecture:\n\nShared-memory architecture that minimizes external memory requests.\n\nDevice hardware and firmware that contain the Fusion-MPT architecture functionality.\n\nThe Integrated RAID host interface uses the message-passing interface that gives the host OS access to the RAID volumes and to additional non-RAID physical disks.\n\nThe Integrated RAID firmware supports metadata, which describes the logical drive configuration stored on each member disk of a volume. After initialization, the firmware queries each member disk to read the metadata and verify the configuration. The firmware reduces the usable disk space for each member disk when it creates the volume, which makes room for the metadata.\n\nThe Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) monitors disk drives for signs of future disk failure and generates an alert if it detects such signs. The Integrated RAID firmware polls each physical disk in the volume at regular intervals. If the firmware detects a SMART code on a physical disk in the volume, it processes the SMART data and stores it in a log. The volume does not support SMART directly because it is only a logical representation of the physical disks in the volume.\n\nThe Integrated RAID BIOS uses the LSI Fusion-MPT interface to communicate to the SAS2 controller and firmware, which includes reading the Fusion-MPT configuration to access the parameters that define behavior between the SAS2 controller and the devices that connect to it. The Fusion-MPT drivers for all supported operating systems implement the Fusion-MPT interface to communicate with the controller and firmware.\n\nThe mirroring features of LSI Integrated RAID provide data protection for the system boot volume, which safeguards the operating system and other critical information on servers and high-performance workstations.\n\nThe Integrated RAID solution supports the following types of mirrored arrays:\n\nIntegrated Mirroring, which provides RAID 1 features.\n\nIntegrated Mirroring and Striping, which provides RAID 10 features.\n\nThese three mirroring solutions provide a robust, high-performance, fault-tolerant solution to data storage needs at a lower cost than a dedicated RAID controller.\n\nMirrored volumes can have from two to ten disks to provide fault-tolerant protection for critical data. Mirrored volumes also support one or two global hot spare drives, with a maximum of 14 drives on each LSI SAS2 controller.\n\nNote\n\nFourteen drives is the upper limit for a single LSI SAS2 controller, although the controller may support fewer than 14 drives. You can also configure one mirrored volume and one Integrated Striping volume on the same LSI SAS controller.\n\nEach SAS2 controller can have two global hot spare disks available to automatically replace a failed disk in the one or two mirrored volumes configured on the controller. The hot spares make the mirrored volumes even more fault tolerant.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the LSI Integrated RAID features that support the creation of striped arrays.\n\nThe LSI Integrated RAID solution enables you to create Integrated Striping volumes for applications that require the faster performance and increased storage capacity of striping. The low-cost Integrated Striping feature has many of the advantages of a more expensive RAID striping solution. You can configure an Integrated Striping volume as the boot disk or as a data disk.\n\nThe Integrated Striping solution provides better performance and more capacity than individual disks, without burdening the host CPU. The firmware distributes host I/O transactions over multiple disks and presents the disks as a single, logical drive. Striping is transparent to the BIOS, the drivers, and the operating system.\n\nYou can use the LSI SAS2 BIOS CU to configure Integrated Striping volumes. These volumes canconsist of two to ten disks.\n\nOn Integrated Striping volumes, the firmware writes data across multiple disks instead of onto one disk by partitioning the storage space of each disk into 64-KB stripes. The firmware interleaves the stripes round-robin so that the combined storage space consists alternately of stripes from each disk.\n\nThe below image shows an example of integrated striping: the firmware writes segment 1 to disk 1, segment 2 to disk 2, segment 3 to disk 3, and so on. When the firmware reaches the end of the disk list, it continues writing data at the next available segment of disk 1.\n\nSpeed is the primary advantage of the Integrated Striping solution because it transfers data to or from multiple disks simultaneously. However, there is no data redundancy. You should back up the data on other media to avoid losing unsaved data if one disk fails.\n\nThe LSI SAS2 BIOS Configuration Utility is a menu-driven utility program that enables you to easily configure and manage Integrated RAID volumes. You can use the LSI SAS2 BIOS Configuration Utility to create one or two mirrored volumes on each LSI SAS2 controller, with up to two optional global hot spare disks. You must connect all disks in a mirrored volume to the same LSI SAS2 controller.\n\nAlthough you can use different sized disks in mirrored volumes, the smallest disk in the volume determines the logical size of all disks in the volume. The volume does not use the excess space of the higher-capacity member disks. For example, if you create an Integrated Mirroring Enhanced volume with two 100-GB disks and two 120-GB disks, the volume uses only 100 GB on each of the 120-GB disks.\n\nSee Mirrored Volumes for more information about the features of Integrated Mirroring, Integrated Mirroring and Striping, and Integrated Mirroring Enhanced volumes.\n\nThis section describes how to create Integrated Striping volumes using the LSI SAS2 BIOS Configuration Utility (SAS2 BIOS CU).\n\nThe LSI SAS2 BIOS CU is a menu-driven utility program that enables you to easily configure and manage Integrated RAID volumes. You can use the SAS2 BIOS CU to create one or two Integrated Striping volumes on each LSI SAS2 controller. Each volume can have from two to ten drives. All disks in an Integrated Striping volume must be connected to the same LSI SAS2 controller.\n\nAlthough you can use disks of different sizes in Integrated Striping volumes, the smallest disk in the\n\nvolume determines the logical size of all disks in the volume. The firmware does not use the excess space of the higher-capacity member disk. For example, if you create an Integrated Striping volume with two 100-GB disks and two 120-GB disks, the firmware uses only 100 GB on each of the 120-MB disks for the volume. The supported stripe size is 64 KB.\n\nSee Integrated Striping for more information about Integrated Striping volumes.\n\nYou can configure one or two Integrated RAID volumes on each LSI SAS2 controller. For a two-volume configuration, you can have two Integrated Striping (RAID 0) volumes, two mirrored volumes, or one volume of each type. The two volumes can have a maximum of 14 disk drives, which includes one or two hot spare disks for mirrored volumes.\n\nThe following guidelines apply when creating an Integrated Striping volume:\n\nDisks must have 512-B blocks and must not have removable media.\n\nIntegrated Striping volumes must have at least two disks and no more than ten disks. Integrated Striping volumes do not support hot spare disks.\n\nSteps:\n\nIn the Adapter List window, choose an LSI SAS adapter and press Enter.\n\nThe Adapter Properties window appears.\n\nChoose RAID Properties and press Enter.\n\nThe Create Array window appears.\n\nChoose Create RAID 0 Volume.\n\nThe Create New Array window appears.\n\nMove the cursor to the RAID Disk column and choose a line that has a No entry in this column, which indicates that the disk is not already part of the volume you are creating.\n\nTo add the disk to the new array, press Spacebar to change the No to Yes.\n\nMove the cursor to another line and press Spacebar to add another disk to the array.\n\nContinue adding disks in this way until you have added the desired number of disks.\n\nPress C to create the array.\n\nA menu appears.\n\nFrom the menu options, choose Save changes then exit this menu.\n\nA processing message appears briefly, and the SAS2 BIOS CU returns to the Adapter Properties window. Initialization of the new array continues in the background.\n\nNote\n\nRepeat the previous instructions to create a second Integrated Striping volume, if desired, and if enough additional disks are available."
