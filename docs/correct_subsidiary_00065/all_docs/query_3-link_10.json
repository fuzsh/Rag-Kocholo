Read about their founding, growth, often spectacular success, and sometimes decline.\n\nExplore CHM resources to listen to oral histories of company founders and leaders, view innovative products from our collection of artifacts, and read documents from the archives.\n\n1960s Semiconductor Era\n\nOver the decade of the 1960s, more than 30 startup companies emerged on the southern San Francisco Peninsula to pursue the opportunity for silicon semiconductor devices in computers and new consumer products, including color TV. Most of them spun out of Fairchild Semiconductor that was founded in 1957 by eight disaffected employees from the laboratory of William Shockley, the coinventor of the transistor, in Mountain View, California. One month later the USSR launched Sputnik, creating a demand for silicon transistors in US aerospace systems. Fairchild became an overnight financial and technical success and established semiconductor manufacturing as the primary growth industry of the region, thus giving rise to the nickname “Silicon Valley.”\n\nAmelco Semiconductor, Mountain View, CA (1961)\n\nFounders: Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Sheldon Roberts (all from Fairchild and Shockley)\n\nWith financing arranged by Arthur Rock, Amelco, the first spinoff to be headed by Fairchild cofounders, was established to build integrated circuits in support of Teledyne Corporation’s military and aerospace operations. Later renamed Teledyne Semiconductor, the company operated as a unit of Teledyne Components before being spun out in 1993 as Telcom Semiconductor Inc. Microchip acquired Telcom in 2000.\n\nLearn more:\n\nJay Last, Oral History, CHM Collection\n\nMaking Silicon Valley: Innovation and the Growth of High Tech, 1930−1970, Text, CHM Collection\n\nGeneral Microelectronics, Santa Clara, CA (1963)\n\nFounders: Howard Bobb, James P.
