Moreover, the company offers a family of LTE power amplifiers solutions which offer higher performance in a small form factor. The company's robust LTE portfolio coupled with strong growth in the end market would provide incremental growth opportunities to enhance its revenues and market share in the coming years. Threat Intense competition The global semiconductor industry is highly competitive. The company's competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in niche markets. Broadcom competes with integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs. The company competes on the basis of quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support. In the wireless communications market, the company primarily competes with Murata Manufacturing, RF Micro Devices, and Skyworks Solutions. Broadcom competes based on its expertise in amplifier design, FBAR technology and module integration. In the wired infrastructure market, the company competes with Finisar, IBM's Microelectronics Division, JDS Uniphase, ST Microelectronics, Sumitomo, BinOptics, and Mitsubishi Electric. In addition, the company competes with Marvell Technology Group, and Texas Instruments in the enterprise storage segment. Furthermore, in the industrial and other markets, the company competes with Analog Devices, Cree, Hamamatsu Photonics, Heidenhain, Renesas Electronics and Toshiba. Also, several of the company's competitors are well established, have a more extensive product portfolio, substantially greater market share, and manufacturing, financial, R&D and marketing resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. In addition, several of the company's competitors have longer independent operating histories, greater presence in key markets, more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition. The competition in the markets in which the company operates is expected to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market.\n\n26. Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 26 Intense competition may adversely impact the company's market share and revenues in the coming years. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing of supply chain The company operates a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third- party foundry and module assembly and test capabilities. As a result, Broadcom is highly reliant on third- party foundry wafer fabrication capacity, including single-sourcing for many components or products. Most of its products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular foundry. The company also uses third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of assembly and test operations, including ASE Korea and Inari Technology. The ability and willingness of the contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside the control of the company. If one or more of its contract manufacturers or other outsourced providers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Broadcom's ability to bring products to market could suffer, thus affecting its reputation. Moreover, the company does not have any long-term supply contracts with its contract manufacturers or materials suppliers and may not be able to obtain the products or raw materials required for its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Broadcom purchases a significant portion of its semiconductor materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers. In FY2015, the company purchased 51% of the materials for its manufacturing processes from six suppliers. Furthermore, substantially all of these purchases are on a purchase order basis, and Broadcom has not entered into long-term contracts with the contract manufacturers or suppliers. In the event that these purchase orders or relationships with suppliers are terminated, the company cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices, which could adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations. The company's dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing of supply chain may adversely affect Broadcom's ability to bring products to market and damage its reputation. Additionally, it may also impair the company's ability to operate effectively. Short life cycles and rapid technological changes The semiconductor industry is characterized with short life cycles and rapid technological changes. The advancements in the field will lead to higher substitutions and therefore products in the industry suffer short life cycles. Rapid changes in demand for its products reduce Broadcom’s ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of its customers. The company will find it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. Replacing the production processes can result in\n\n27. Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) SWOT Analysis Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 27 inefficiencies and costs due to capacity constraints for new technology. Furthermore, the company has to make substantial investments in the development of capabilities, in resources such as R&D, technology licensing, test and tooling equipment, facility expansions and personnel requirements. Due to these investments, the profitability of operations generally lags the sales by considerable time. Fast pace of technology displacement will not give sufficient time to absorb the investments and will lead to lower profitability of operations. Short life cycles associated with end markets tend to impact the profitability of the company's operations. Rapid technological changes require high R&D investments and if the company is unable to commercialize new products, Broadcom will experience significant loss on invested capital. In addition, in an industry with such rapid changes, the company is constantly under the threat from its competitors developing technological advances faster.\n\n28.

Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) Company View Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 29 Company View COMPANY VIEW An excerpt from the 'management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' section is given below. The statement has been taken from the company's 10-K filing for FY2015. Overview We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on analog III-V based products and complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices. We have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as smartphones, enterprise servers and storage systems, hard disk drives, solid state drives, data networking and telecommunications equipment, factory automation, industrial equipment and consumer appliances. We have four reportable segments: wireless communications, enterprise storage, wired infrastructure and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. We differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins. Original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large OEMs. We also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network, and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including Avnet, Inc. and Arrow Electronics, Inc. We have a diversified and well-established base of thousands of end customers, located throughout the world, which we serve through our multi-channel sales and fulfillment system. The demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following: • general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets;\n\n30. Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) Company View Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 30 • our ability to define specifications for, develop or acquire, complete, introduce and market, new products and technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner; •the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders and our ability to manage inventory; • the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; and • the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products. Current uncertainty in global economic conditions, including the economic recovery in the United States and the level of growth in China, still poses significant risks to our business. For example, customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations. Net Revenue Substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices that our customers incorporate into electronic products. Our four reportable segments are wireless communications, enterprise storage, wired infrastructure and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. Applications for our products in these segments include smartphones, enterprise servers and storage systems, hard disk drives, or HDDs, solid state drives, or SSDs, data networking and telecommunications equipment, factory automation, industrial equipment and consumer appliances. The percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments varies from fiscal quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality. The first fiscal quarter is often our lowest revenue and cash generating quarter due, in part, to holiday shut downs at many OEM customers and distributors, and the first half of the fiscal year has tended to generate lower revenue than the second half of the fiscal year. However, sometimes typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly in the wireless communications and enterprise\n\n31. Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) Company View Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 31 storage segments. We use distributors for a significant portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. Historically, a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 21% and 25% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended November 1, 2015 and November 2, 2014, respectively. During the fiscal year ended November 1, 2015, or fiscal year 2015, Foxconn Technology Group companies, or Foxconn, accounted for 24% of our net revenue, and our top five direct customers, which also included one distributor, collectively accounted for 46% of our net revenue. During the fiscal year ended November 2, 2014, or fiscal year 2014, Foxconn accounted for 20% of our net revenue and our top five direct customers, which also included two distributors, collectively accounted for 41% of our net revenue. We believe our aggregate sales to Apple, Inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with our sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes (which includes Foxconn), accounted for more than 20% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2015 and more than 15% for fiscal year 2014. We believe our aggregate sales to Cisco Systems Inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with our sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2013. We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top ten direct or indirect customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Costs and Expenses Total cost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials, and the cost of assembly and testing of those products. Cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, including share-based compensation, and related occupancy, computer services and equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty and inventory adjustments, including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, energy costs, other manufacturing expenses and acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs include direct transaction costs and integration-related costs. Total cost of products sold also includes amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges. Although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication and assembly and test facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication and assembly and test facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\n32. Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) Company View Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 32 Research and development. research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including share- based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses, computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process and acquisition-related costs. Selling, general and administrative. selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including share-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, costs of advertising, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses. Amortization of intangible assets. In connection with acquisitions, we recognized intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year to 25 years. We also recognized goodwill and in-process research and development, which are not amortized, in connection with acquisitions. Restructuring and asset impairment charges. Restructuring charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, fixed asset impairments, facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements. Interest expense. Interest expense in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 included coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of the original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our outstanding debt. Other income, net. Other income, net includes net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, realized and unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities, gains on the sale of cost-method investments, interest income, gains (losses) on currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items.\n\n33. Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) Company View Broadcom Limited (formerly Avago Technologies Limited) © MarketLine Page 33 Provision for income taxes. We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. For example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore, which provide that certain classes of income we earn in Singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. In order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a corporate headquarters function and specified intellectual property, or IP, activities in Singapore. The Singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between 2018 and 2025, subject in certain cases to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain. Absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifying Malaysian income, which is effective up to and including our fiscal year 2018. The tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the effect of all these tax incentives was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately $207 million, $99 million and $77 million, respectively. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense. Going forward, our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors, including overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate, as well as discrete events, such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time. In particular, we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside Singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis, potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities\n\n34.
