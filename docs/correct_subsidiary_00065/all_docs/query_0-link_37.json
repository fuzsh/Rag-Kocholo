        "text": "Avago agrees to buy LSI for $6.6 billion\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Avago Technologies said Monday it agreed to buy LSI Corp. for $6.6 billion to get into the business of semiconductors that help run data centers and handle mobile Internet traffic.\n\nAvago said it will pay $11.15 a share in cash for LSI, creating a semiconductor maker with about $5 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAvago said it will pay for the deal with a $4.6 billion term loan from a group of banks and a $1 billion investment from private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners. The latter investment will likely be a seven-year 2% convertible note with a conversion price of $48.04 a share or preferred stock with equivalent economic terms, Avago said.\n\nLSI shares surged 39% to $10.96 in morning trading Monday. Avago stock climbed 14% to $51.90.\n\nThe deal comes as the rise of cloud computing increases demand for data centers and the servers and chips needed to run them. LSI specializes in storage and networking technology for large organizations that use data centers a lot."
