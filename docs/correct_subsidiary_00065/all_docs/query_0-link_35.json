        "meta_description": "A storage area network (SAN) or storage network is a computer network which provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily used to enhance accessibility of storage devices, such as disk arrays and tape libraries, to servers so that the devices appear to the operating system as locally-attached devices. A SAN typically is a dedicated network of storage devices not accessible through the local area network (LAN) by other devices, thereby preventing interference of LAN traffic in data transfer.",

        "text": "NetApp creates storage and data management solutions that are designed to help customers accelerate business breakthroughs and achieve outstanding cost efficiency. Their mission has always been to help their customers achieve what matters most to them. In 1993, they shipped their first data storage system to Patrick Mulrooney, who at that time was a system administrator at Tandem Computers. The network appliance was designed to clean up his infrastructure sprawl. He loved its simplicity. “Patrick’s favorite attribute was that their system rebooted in 30 seconds instead of hours like their competitors,” says NetApp co-founder, Dave Hitz. “While solving his downtime problem, they also gave Patrick a competitive edge.” More than 20 years later, their story is still about delivering innovation that gives their customers an edge over their competitors. From the edge of the universe with CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, to the edge of human endurance in Formula One auto racing, they help you do things you couldn’t before—at speeds you never thought possible. Throughout the world, leading organizations count on NetApp for software, systems, and services to manage and store their data. They help enterprises and service providers envision, deploy, and evolve their IT environments. Customers also benefit from their open collaboration with other technology leaders to create the specific solutions they need. their team is passionate about customer success. Their company culture and work environment support that dedication. Together with their global network of partners, they are united in one goal: to help their customers achieve the outcomes that matter most to them. They view their culture as a competitive advantage and a foundation for continued success. They proudly hire the world’s most talented and committed employees, who work hard to help their customers, partners, shareholders, and communities thrive. Their commitment to their values results in an award-winning culture of collaboration and trust. The Great Place to Work Institute recently named NetApp #4 on its \"World's Best Multinational Workplaces 2015\" - the world's first annual study of multinational workplace excellence. They have repeatedly earned a spot on FORTUNE magazine's list of the \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" in the United States, as well as top spots on \"Great Place to Work\" lists in locations around the world. Their operational philosophy and culture are defined by their commitment to delivering the best possible results for the communities they serve.
