        "text": "I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit with Intel Rapid Storage Technology Enterprise Raid 1 Controller C600 chipset . Raid 1 controller and disk 0 crashed and system will not boot with disk 1 nor disk 1 moved into the disk 0 position. I replaced crashed disk 0 and loaded recovery disks into new disk 0 (shows as non-RAID member). System runs but will not recognize disk 1 (remaining RAID 1 disk).\n\nI have a third empty hard drive (disk 2) loaded and is not recognized by system. I cannot find any app to clone disk 1 on to disk 2. If I can, then I will replace new disk 0 with the cloned copy of disk 1 in primary position (replacing disk 0) and hope system will boot under RAID 1 again.\n\nWill that work assuming someone can recommend cloning software that will work on a non-RAID 1 controlled system?\n\n@Dell_Technologies\n\n@Johnprice once windows boos are you able to see the volume, filesystems, files on the degraded raid device (e.g. only one drive vs. two)? If the volume, filesystems appears, then you can simply clone that (e.g. clone the vdisk vs. the physical) using clonzezilla, acronis, clonix or something else.\n\nOr does the raid vdisk (single drive) not appear to windows?\n\nWhen you power on the computer, watch the screen and right before windows tries to boot, try pressing F2 to see if that takes you into the intel setup, the following shows some more options:\n\nhttp://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/CS-033696.htm\n\nhttp://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/g46033003_raid_qrg.pdf\n\nhttp://download.intel.com/support/chipsets/imsm/sb/irst_user_guide.pdf\n\nGood luck\n\nAs SAM indicates, IRST is FakeRAID. From your post, it appears to me that something more is going on here than a single failed drive. It also appears that you have a version of IRST that is different than what I have worked with in the past, today is the first time I have heard of an “Enterprise” version of it. The link below is the manual for your version.\n\nIn any case, whether restoring from your recovery media or trying to recover what’s on your disk 1, I think your best bet is to build a new RAID 1 array from scratch and either restore to that from your recovery media, or a clone of disk 1 made offline, rather than trying to recover your existing degraded array. I would also recommend doing this with two new fresh drives. If you still have issues after doing this you are probably dealing with a bad IRST controller\n\nBetter yet, would be to get a true Hardware RAID controller from LSI or Adaptec and dump the Intel Raid. The only place I will use IRST is on laptops where installing a controller card is not an option due to physical reasons. Hope this helps.\n\ndownload.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/rste_swug_v11.pdf\n\nThanks for all the info. While in windows recovered version, I changed RAID volume 0000 option to rebuild upon booting, but that did not work. I cannot get into any bios upon booting with blank disk in the primary disk position because the keyboard is not being recognized, wired or wireless. Looks like I need to try offline cloning of RAID disk 1 and inserting back into primary disk position to become the new RAID disk 0.\n\nOne other thought: While in recovered windows boot up, could I change the boot disc to SATA 2 (where RAID disk 1 is located), allowing the system to use the mirror for booting upon restart? If that does not work, I may have to move the recovered windows disk to that position for restart?%uFEFF\n\nReally? You have to ask how using FakeRAID puts people at risk? I’ve never had anyone suggest that FakeRAID wasn’t risky before.\n\nFakeRAID is primary risky by being confusing. The very thing that makes it FakeRAID is that it is designed to fool IT pros into thinking that it is hardware RAID when it is not. This leads to believing that there is a level of encapsulation and protection that does not exist. FakeRAID is also no operating system level RAID. By definition, FakeRAID is not enterprise or business class. It is a category of software that exists just to fool people which, if you read in Spiceworks, you will see that people are fooled by it all of the time.\n\nFakeRAID is risky by the very nature of being designed to fool its own users. As IT professionals we need to know and understand the systems that we work on. It is by having a good understanding of systems that they become safe. Anytime that we are operating without that understanding we are at risk. This is just fundamental IT.\n\nBeyond those issues, the nature of making FakeRAID (duping customers rather than making a good product to make a sale) means that there is no incentive for FakeRAID makers to make a quality product. Customers who know what they are getting would never buy FakeRAID (especially now that even desktop Windows has software RAID built in!) Why spend money on an inferior product when something better is already included and better supported for free?\n\nEverything about FakeRAID is risky. It’s not insanely risky, it is just riskier than not using it. There is always a less risky option. FakeRAID simply makes no sense. It is an unnecessary risk that exists only so that vendors can sell smoke and mirrors.\n\nThat’s not a good thing. If you aren’t going to use hardware RAID then you want operating system software RAID, no exceptions. Third party software RAID is a bad idea for obvious reasons. It only ever existed for products like Windows desktop OSes where there didn’t used to be a software RAID option. But there is now, so there is no legitimate use case for software RAID that isn’t in the OS. RAID, to be useful, needs to be rock solid and not fragile.\n\nEven if you own a system with Intel RST, you should never use it. Stick to business class RAID from your OS if you do not have hardware RAID. Not only is it better supported, better tested and free but it is also portable in case you need to recover to disparate hardware. Why be tied to specific hardware and unnecessary third party software to do something that your OS does better on its own without needing those limitations or complications?\n\nWhoa there, Scott Allen Miller. What you are labeling as “fake raid” is completely independent of the OS. That, by separation of function is inherently superior to software RAID that you state is a recent innovation in Windows, while it has been part of Windows since NT 3.0. You are muddying the waters by making false claims against in-built RAID on business-grade computers such as the Dell Optiplex 760, that is truly hardware-based, just as much as any add-in RAID controller of your choice is, no matter the design, with battery backed cache or not, with a dedicated cpu or not. Remember that there are different plateaus in the marketplace, meant to cater to different budgets. The Ina-built RAID on that example of the Dell a Optiplex 760 minitower is a perfectly adequate form of data protection redundancy for its intended target market .- the needs of one user, or a small group of users. I gave you proof that this even works flawlessly on an Optiplex 755 Minitower running 2008r2, with specific example of array member fault detection and recovery, independent of the OS.\n\nI will go on the record to say that OS-based RAID is what I am opposed to, as it provides no separation of function, and therefore carries liabIlities due to the inherent risk of losing the data on a OS-based array of the installed instance of the OS itself becomes unusable. A quarter of a century ago we did not have hardware-based storage management, if you recall some of the workarounds that were necessary to use a large (for its time) 70MB hard drive on systems that had OS base limitations on partition size.\n\nAgain, I put forth the challenge to you to give us a specific example of how the in-built RAID on a business-class desktop such as the Optiplex 760 minitower, puts users in any more risk than going without that RAID protection.\n\nHarry,\n\nYou are having the same problem as me. It was noted above that an offline clone needs to be made. I took my computer to a tech service, They cloned the RAID disk 1, but it would not boot because Windows tracks the serial number of the hard drive when in RAID mode and wants that drive before it will boot. The tech next entered the bios (using a serial port based keyboard) and turned RAID off, then it booted. Next, he turned RAID back on, even though the bios warned it would delete all data on the disk. He said it doesn’t actually do that in this situation (bios controlled changes?). He was correct and the system is up now with all apps and data intact. It would seem that the above procedure might work using the original mirror, RAID 1 disk, also. It’s unknown why I could not boot from RAID disk 1 after RAID disk 0 crashed.\n\nTech said this version of RAID resides in the Intel chipset and it’s not software RAID, but actually physically controlled RAID on the motherboard with the C600 chipset. I’m not an expert, so this is my understanding based on what the tech told me."
