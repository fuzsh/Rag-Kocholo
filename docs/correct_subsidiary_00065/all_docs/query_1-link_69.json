        "text": "How Different Is GenAI Compared to Prior AI in LegalTech?\n\nGenerative AI represents a significant leap in Artificial Intelligence development and is drastically different from most previous forms of machine learning, not only in the legal industry but across every industry or aspect of human life. The critical difference between GenAI and previous AI iterations is the capacity to generate completely new content.\n\nUnlike previous models and algorithms, which were powerful in their own right and could quickly interpret, sort and classify data, Generative AI is capable of interacting with human users in a question-and-answer format to produce complete, coherent answers to natural language queries. In this manner, unlike the chat bots of yore, GenAI does not rely on preprogrammed responses, and can easily pull context for answers from various sources available to the system or provide opinions on data outside of the system’s training scope.\n\nNaturally, these differences have given birth to a wide variety of potential applications of Generative AI, such as the ability to generate contract language, create case summaries, or help legal professionals quickly access laws and regulations, all of which were previously unattainable with older natural language learning models.\n\nLLMs - Their Role in Powering GenAI & How They Differ from Existing Algorithms\n\nGenerative AI and LLMs (Large-Language Models) tend to quite often be used interchangeably, but it is important to recognize that while these are related concepts, they are not the same thing. Generative AI is a general catch-all term to describe AI systems capable of generating new content, whether it involves audio, video, written text or something else. LLMs, on the other hand, are machine learning models that focus primarily on interpreting, analyzing and composing text-based data. In other words, all LLMs are a form of generative AI, but not all generative AI relies on LLMs. Since the legal field is heavily text-driven, most of the time LLMs will be the only form of generative AI e-discovery practitioners are exposed to, although as the variety of data sources used in data collections expands, it is possible that generative AI driven by other types of media will come to the fore as well. For the purposes of this blog, we will cover only LLMs and text-based aspects of Generative-AI and disregard other types of Generative AI that deal with image or movie generation.\n\nWith that out of the way, there are a few key differences between LLMs and previously used models such as LSI and SVM, which are the two technologies that underpinned TAR 1.0 and TAR 2.0 (“CAL”).\n\nThe most important difference is the ability to generate new output. Both LSI and SVM models were designed to be simple and effective approaches to classify, label or cluster document sets of varying size using a limited amount of sample documents as training material. Their primary focus is to effectively analyze the characteristics of the data they are provided, and not attempt to interpret the language present in the data in any meaningful way. Instead, these models apply a statistical approach (LSI) or a hyperplane method (SVM) to solve a specific problem (document classification) using pre-coded seeds (data) analyzed by the models.\n\nConversely, LLMs are trained on an incomparably greater volume of documents, and to a much greater depth, which allows LLMs to understand the context and syntax behind human language in a way that enables the creation of new content that can also mimic the writing style used in a specific industry.\n\nA general overview of the differences in practice are provided below for quick reference:\n\nBreadth & Scope of GenAI Usage Driven by LLM Networks\n\nThe increased ability of Generative AI models does present certain challenges. For example, LLMs are computationally intensive, and may require significant IT resources to train with additional data. They also typically require a large amount of data for training and will suffer if trained on insufficiently large data sets – this is one of the instances in which an older model, like LSI or SVM, may be more appropriate to use.\n\nLast but not least, most pre-existing LLMs are trained on general language text and may encounter some degradation in performance if required to evaluate text laden with industry-specific jargon that is absent from the initial training data. This point underscores the importance of noting that this technology is still in its nascency. Nevertheless, the drawbacks of exploring the use of LLMs are currently limited, and those that exist are likely to be resolved with future technological improvements. This combined with the upside of discovering a wide range of new opportunities to leverage AI in LegalTech renders a promising future for the creation of innovative solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are very few industries that will remain directly unaffected by GenAI, and fewer yet that will not benefit in some way from this technology. Today, the magnitude of expected disruption can be felt all around us with conference halls buzzing about AI seminars, stock markets pushing shares of companies upwards of 300%, such as NVIDIA, a primary provider of AI-enabling chips, and courts beginning to respond to the use of GenAI in LegalTech.\n\nElectronic discovery is certain to receive a positive impact from the use of Generative AI as well. As the past decade has shown, other automation technologies have become permanent fixtures in many discovery workflows, and GenAI is now primed to augment and/or add to existing processes due to user-friendly and intuitive interfaces that many solutions provide.\n\nAt this time, however, there remain certain challenges with using LLMs in the legal field, and AI hallucinations is at the top of the list. It is our belief that most of these issues will be overcome through the use of reinforcement learning and overall general improvement of LLMs over time. Therefore, it is possible that classification workflows (most leverage some form of CAL) will be supplanted by LLM-driven workflows similar to how CAL replaced TAR 1.0 for many users. However, it is important to note that TAR 1.0 is recognized by courts worldwide and commonly used by legal teams. At FRONTEO, for example, our proprietary KIBIT AI engine continues to power technology assisted solutions across all business lines, and although we continue to innovate and evolve KIBIT with cutting edge technology, we anticipate GenAI-based solutions will most likely serve as an additional option for legal teams over the next few years, as opposed to outright replacements for existing, proven solutions ingrained within workflows that are used with great effect.\n\nThe massive and rapid changes to the way we execute and deliver legal services will surely make for a bumpy road, but as long as certain precautions are taken, GenAI will significantly improve the practice of law. However, it is important to keep in mind that GenAI is not a miracle solution for every problem and should be viewed as “a” tool, but not “the” tool, and consequently, be treated with the same amount of diligence and care as any other application or technology in your software stack."
