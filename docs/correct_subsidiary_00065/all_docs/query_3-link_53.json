        "text": "Tech M&A Research Report\n\nThanks, Bruce. We begin with the public markets, where indices continue to set records, on the rebound from their pullback earlier this year, as most central banks aligned with the US Fed’s unprecedented loose money policies. That and generally growing world economies, the first-quarter US GDP drop notwithstanding, combined with robust tech innovation cycles to stretch buyers’ stocks up and fill their coffers with cash, a substantial amount of which flows through to M&A. So far so good on our January prediction of a fine year for tech M&A sellers.\n\nLooking at the leaderboard, strategic buyers’ numbers are beating records, too, particularly Google, which took back the top spot as it reeled in a very diverse catch. WPP surged past its total of 13 for ALL last year already. The majority of Yahoo’s relatively light 9 transactions involved mobility applications. Dropbox DOUBLED its prior full-year count, and Microsoft appeared on the chart again while Intuit was crowded out of it.\n\nWe also note Apple’s big year-over-year change, having sprung into action in second half last year, and Oracle, though conversely it basically skipped that half. Many of these dramatic rotations show just how quickly the big guys can move when they see a need for M&A – and how quickly they get over it, too. The lesson is to not let the arc of internal company progress preclude you from obeying market urgency – the window can open and close suddenly.\n\nIt’s certainly open at Google, whose decade-plus of aggressive M&A history is clearly making another lurch forward. At this rate it will set a new record for the year, and is poised to be exhibit A confirming our January prediction that top companies will view this year as a key moment to support winning against smaller, more agile competitors via M&A strategies.\n\nThe financial buyers had similar pressing concerns. Vista led the PE parade at almost three times last year’s first half pace, with Insight’s rise even steeper. Much of this activity in the booming and complex PE universe comprised bolt-ons, tuck-ins and other care and feeding of existing platform plays, showing that small companies should not neglect PE possibilities.\n\nThe Corum Index displays increased transaction count with a growing number of VC backed exits, when the major buyers were especially busy harvesting mega-deals. Let’s see, we covered Facebook and Whatsapp before, we covered Apple Beats last month, we’ll talk more about Amaya Gaming’s deal and the SanDisk-Fusion-io transaction when we talk about those markets. And please note that all prior webinars are archived on our Corum website, with free access.\n\nThe most recent and largest megadeal is Oracle’s MICROS transaction at a spectacular $5.3B. This largest purchase of the last 4-and-half-years by Oracle will bring it integrated solutions and customer base in hospitality and retail.\n\nWe also previously covered a bit on Zebra’s amazing buy out from Motorola's Business Solutions for a huge borrowed sum, and how that reflects the low cost of cash supporting the M&A market.\n\nInternet travel market consolidation continued with online travel agency Priceline paying $2.5B for OpenTable and its majority market share position in North American restaurant reservations.\n\nAnd AutoNavi, the leading Chinese mobile map service was valued by Alibaba at $1.6B, as the ecommerce giant upped its ownership stake from 28% to 100%, ahead of its possible—likely—IPO next month, which could be the world’s largest ever.\n\nTraveling around that world now, North America continued to host the majority of deals this year, but its Southern “sisters” growth is accelerating – we at Corum are seeing signs increasing development there this last decade is about to yield a harvest of M&A. The Mideast and Africa have also brought more attractive companies for sale to the world arena.\n\nAs usual, US buyers outnumber sellers in all regions, as we witness a major increase in volumes and shift from NE to West during this year. The most rapid growth occurred in the Midwest which contributed a megadeal with Chicago’s Fieldglass, a 15-year-old provider of Vendor Management services, now deployed in the cloud and sold to SAP. This confirmed the trend Corum saw and talked about in our Heartland sidebar of the Annual Report.\n\nIn Western Europe over a hundred more tech companies were sold during the first half this year than during the first half last year. The leader here is the UK, with its WPP sub JWT, one of those hungry revenue-hunters swallowing digital media agencies.\n\nAt Corum we’re seeing increased interest from EU buyers in Latin America. Sweden’s Hexagon made 2 of its 6 transactions in Brazil, iLab Sistemas and Arvus, both specializing in optimization solutions for the agro-business sector.\n\nIn India, Facebook made its first Bangalore-based purchase, breaking 8 figures for Little Eye Labs, an Android performance analyzer startup. US companies also showed interest toward sellers Down Under; Microsoft picked up GreenButton, a Kiwi “cloud burst” vendor destined for its Azure group.\n\nA final call has to go out for Israel’s vibrant tech sector, where for about 8 million dollars Russian Internet giant Yandex snapped up a mobile geoloc start-up that reduces battery consumption.\n\nOur aggregate Six Market valuations index caught the spring updraft and managed stay in flight, defying gravity for now to keep us on track with our January prediction. Now to deconstruct these 6 market sectors and their 26 components in detail, we turn now to Amber Stoner.\n\nHorizontal Software Valuation Multiples\n\nAmber Stoner\n\nMultiples for the Horizontal sector as a whole remain strong with fluctuations among the subsectors as the market seeks long-term direction. Understanding customer behavior is a core element of any business, consequently buyers in the first half have been targeting companies that provide effective customer analytics solutions.\n\nIn early May, Google spent an estimated $150 million to buy Adometry, a provider of online advertising and customer analytics SaaS, at a strong 7.5x revenue multiple. Adometry’s solution allows users to track consumers through the Internet to find out what motivates them to make purchases.\n\nAlso in May, Brandify was picked up by Where2GetIt. Both companies are involved in providing marketing solutions, but unlike Where2GetIt, which provides location-based digital marketing solutions for local retailers, Brandify offers a SaaS solution that evaluates the online footprint of brands and their interaction with customers.\n\nLast month, Amobee, a subsidiary of Singapore-based SingTel, bought Kontera for $150 million, a 5.8x revenue multiple. Kontera’s platform analyzes data across mobile, web and social networks enabling businesses to make real-time decisions about their consumer trends. With this acquisition, Amobee gains a technology that improves contextual understanding of where and how ads should be placed on the Web and mobile devices.\n\nTo bolster development of its mapping services, Nokia company HERE, acquired predictive customer analytics SaaS company, Medio Systems. Medio’s solutions will facilitate the creation of contextual maps and location services that change according to the situation, providing personalized and predictive experiences for people and businesses.\n\nAlina, there’s something interesting going on with the Consumer sector’s valuations, right?\n\nConsumer Software Valuation Multiples\n\nAlina Soltys\n\nWe’ve had phenomenal growth in valuations over the last 12 months. Revenue multiples have increased almost 60% to 2.54x revenue and EBITDA has not been shy to follow with 30% increase landing just under of 10x. This has certainly translated into a record first half in M&A activity – especially when looking at the gaming sector.\n\nYears of work within the gambling community have finally created a framework for online gaming and gambling to become official – at least on a limited basis in certain states like Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. A high level of M&A activity has followed in its wake as seen by the breathtaking $4.9B acquisition of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker by the Canadian publicly traded Amaya Gaming Group. Originally Amaya lined up significant debt underwriters but the newest plan that they are working is to separately list PokerStars publically. And yesterday, an even larger transaction was announced of GTECH acquiring IGT for $6.4BN!\n\nCasual game maker GSN Games bought BashGaming, the maker of the hit social casino game Bingo Bash for an estimated $160-170M. Bash’s Revenues have been estimated at $60-$70m, placing them at around a 2.5x multiple. With this acquisition, GSN Games will get 4.4million active monthly users, and a very strong position in the social casino gaming space. And speaking of the gaming space, I’ve been invited to speak at Casual Connect San Francisco next week. If you are in the area, feel free to reach out to me to chat further.\n\nThe next two companies are also based in the city, Kabam, one of the largest Western free-to-play game companies acquired game studio Phoenix Age for around $90m. The acquisition bolsters Kabam’s games catalog with strong franchises in the RPG genre across mobile and web platforms.\n\nA lot has been said and written about the $2B pick up of Oculus Rift by Facebook. To counter many fears of becoming a corporate asset hidden within the Facebook vault, Oculus remains independent, doing acquisitions to prepare for primetime.\n\nThe first acquisition is Carbon Design Group – the design firm responsible for collaborating with MSFT on the award winning Xbox controller. They will work on beautifying the currently heavy headpiece.\n\nJust over a week ago Oculus’ second acquisition went through of RakNet. They are a middleware tool that powers cross-platform voice chat, connectivity and other features used by indie developers and large shops alike.\n\nTaking a page out of the Google playbook that Nat overviewed with our client Instantiations becoming open sourced, RakNet has since become open-sourced as well in an effort to grow the developer network and provide them with tools to create on the Oculus platform.\n\nMoving on to the next sector, how does IT Services look Tyler?\n\nIT Services Software Valuation Multiples\n\nTyler Vickers\n\nAs large companies seek to expand through acquisitions, providing an innovative solution remains the strongest driver of a high multiple. The IT Services sector has seen relatively stable, if modest, growth in sales multiples over the last six months, with a small 2% dip in EBITDA by the end of June. The modest growth in sales multiples in the North American and European markets isn't quite reflected in the Asian market, which, after enjoying considerable increases in the last half of 2013, has decreased slightly during the first half of 2014. That being said, overall sales and EBITDA values in the Asian market are higher – by a factor of 4 and 1.5, respectively.\n\nLooking at the deals, international aerospace giant Boeing acquired Ventura Solutions, a hardware and software developer specialized in radio systems and signal processing. Leading the development of RedHawk, a software-defined radio framework, Ventura Solutions provides a perfect example of the blurring lines between hardware and software utilization. The movement toward this type of enmeshed system is an increasingly common occurrence in the IT services industry, as continued improvements in the capability of electronic components makes this transition possible.\n\nIn one of the biggest IT services purchases of the last six months, French giant Atos picked up Bull for a total cost of nearly $850M. This is Atos's first significant purchase since 2011, when it spent just over a billion dollars for Siemen's IT services arm.\n\nLast month, Vodafone Group bought Cobra Automotive Technologies, an Italian telematics R&D company that serves automotive OEMs at the healthy valuation of 1.3x revenue and 10.9x EBITDA. Cobra commanded this valuation by capitalizing on the ever-growing demand for the Internet of Things with their machine-to-machine solutions.\n\nFinally, Big Four auditor KPMG snapped up 3 companies since the beginning of the year. In March they acquired Cynergy Systems, and in June they bought both Safira and Zanett. Through these purchases, KPMG has expanded its experience with IBM's business process management solutions, improved its web and mobile creation strategies, and gained valuable domain expertise in Oracle-based technology consulting.\n\nAmber, could you take us through the Infrastructure market?\n\nInfrastructure Software Valuation Multiples\n\nAmber Stoner\n\nThe first half of the year yielded robust multiples for the Infrastructure sector, with sales and EBITDA multiples up from the beginning of 2014. The security, network management and development tools subsectors all saw increased multiples from Q1.\n\nSecurity has been an ongoing trend in the infrastructure sector throughout the first half of the year with four deals in the anti-malware space focused on unified threat management and endpoint security integrity; the most recent being Proofpoint’s May acquisition of NetCitadel for $24M, a 24x revenue multiple. NetCitadel’s platform provides innovative approach to security incident response. The acquisition emphasizes Proofpoint’s current “tuck-in” strategy that started with the Armorize and Sendmail deals.\n\nOn the other side of Atlantic, two French leaders in web application firewalls, DenyAll and Corum client Bee Ware, combined forces, adding value to existing customers.\n\nThe flash storage industry has also shown significant consolidation. In late May, Seagate Technology paid $450M for the accelerated solutions and flash components assets of LSI, followed by SanDisk’s $1.3B acquisition of Fusion-io last month. SanDisk paid 2.8x trailing revenue to expand its enterprise SSDs business and become a diversified supplier of flash offerings to the world’s largest Internet companies.\n\nOracle, a perennial top acquirer, continues to strengthen its product offerings in the networking and storage spaces. In early January, the application software giant grabbed SDN technology maker Corente, as a follow-on to its 2013 Acme Packet purchase, and in May, acquired desktop virtualization storage company GreenBytes to augment its ZFS Storage Appliances product suite.\n\nErin, How has the Internet sector done so far this year?\n\nInternet Software Valuation Multiples\n\nErin Sanchez\n\nThe Internet sector held steady through the first six months of 2014 and continues to trade at healthy multiples.\n\nContinuing its international expansion, Expedia picked up two travel companies this year, including Australia-based online travel company Wotif.com for $660M. The acquisition enhances Expedia’s supply in the Asia-Pacific region, where Wotif offers hotel rooms, airline tickets, and vacation packages. Prior to this deal, Expedia grew its European presence with the acquisition of Auto Escape Group, a provider of online car rental services.\n\nAnd with the rise of peer-to-peer business like Lyft, the sharing economy is quickly becoming integral to the travel market. HomeExchange.com’s January purchase of online home swapping and vacation rental marketplace Aha! Go illustrates this trend. HomeExchange gained nearly 5,000 members through the acquisition, growing its global network to reinforce the company’s position as one of the largest services of this kind in the world.\n\nAs usual, cloud leads the way, with top acquirer Dropbox starting the year off hot. The company continues to buy application providers, expanding its product portfolio. With eight deals in the first half of the year, the California company is seeking to turn itself into a major creativity and sharing platform. Droptalk, Loom, Hackpad, and Zulip are now part of Dropbox’s array of product and service offerings.\n\nBox, another SaaS provider with file storage and collaboration services, which recently received $150 million from the PEs, announced only one acquisition this year: Streem, a San Francisco-based developer of streaming technology that enables users to keep copies of files on the cloud.\n\nNow to Laura who will wrap up our six sectors with Vertical.\n\nVertical Software Valuation Multiples\n\nLaura Duren\n\nFinally, to end on a high note, the Vertical sector, most appropriately, is going up. Overall valuation multiples have increased steadily over the past year, making it the only sector to show such consistent positive growth. The Healthcare subsector still leads the market, despite taking a small dip since Q1. Financial Services and Government have remained stable, while two breakthrough subsectors: A/E/C and Energy, are on the rise.\n\nTransportation-related deals contributed to the action in the A/E/C space, with companies lining up to develop their planes, trains, and automobiles.\n\nFirst up, aviation giant Boeing acquired Dutch aircraft management SaaS provider AerData in order to streamline its aircraft leasing and maintenance records. It also bought Gibraltar-based ETS Aviation, provider of aviation fuel efficiency software, with the goal of cutting fuel costs while reducing environmental emissions.\n\nChugging right along, next we see that UK workforce management provider Tracsis brought rail operations analysis software into its station by purchasing Datasys Integration, provider of operations analytics that identifies the causes of train delays in the UK.\n\nRounding out the A/E/C sector is Japanese global automotive supplier DENSO. In order to accelerate R and D of its vehicle diagnostic and telematics business it has acquired a majority stake in EASE Simulation, a US-based supplier of automotive diagnostics.\n\nSmart grid-related deals have sparked a lot of interest in the Energy subsector throughout Q2. Landis+Gyr, the utilities-focused Swiss independent growth platform within Toshiba Corporation, led the charge with two smart grid acquisitions. In May it acquired Danish smart grid sensor and monitoring company PowerSense, and in June bought California-based utility analytics provider GRIDiant Corporation. These transactions expand Landis+Gyr’s smart grid portfolio and offer its utilities customers even more energy monitoring products. They also allow Landis+Gyr to take advantage of the Enmeshed Systems trend, as PowerSense’s offerings include both hardware and software solutions for the sensor-based management of power systems worldwide.\n\nIn another Enmeshed Systems deal, Imagine Communications, a California provider of broadcasting and streaming systems for content delivery networks picked up Digital Rapids, a Canadian company involved in digital video processing and streaming hardware and software in order to strengthen its TV Everywhere business.\n\nAnd lastly, in the largest Vertical deal of the quarter, a Blackstone and Goldman Sachs consortium formed just for this transaction paid $960M to acquire a majority stake in New York-based financial book-building software provider Ipreo Holdings. Original private equity majority stakeholder KKR will retain a minority ownership stake. With three major private equity backers, Ipreo hopes to accelerate its customer’s access to new market-leading products.\n\nElon Gasper\n\nAnd that's the halftime report on 2014 tech M&A. Back to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Milne\n\nThank you very much. Alina, Amber, Erin, Laura, Tyler, and of course Elon the team leader, that’s the best major report I’ve ever heard, and so much happening, stunning valuations! Some of these buyers, Boeing has picked up three companies since their presentation at our World Financial Symposium. Oculus under Facebook creating almost a pyramid of buying, and then making several of their own acquisitions. GTECH back, we did our first deal with them almost 20 years ago. And the Asian buyers, most of those large bids for gaming coming out of the Asian market, and just wait until Alibaba goes public. Can’t wait. Can’t wait!"
