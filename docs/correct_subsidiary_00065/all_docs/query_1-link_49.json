        "text": "Creativity is humanity at its best\n\nCreativity is what makes the future bright and the world a better place. The law protects creativity as intellectual property. The Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University provides students with the opportunity to study intellectual property law and play an important role in developing and protecting creativity so that our future becomes brighter every day.\n\nWith ASU ranked the No. 1 Most Innovative University, by U.S. News and World Report 2024, ASU Law is proud to offer an extensive Intellectual Property (IP) law program for students working towards a Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Laws (LLM), and/or Master of Legal Studies (MLS) degree. The IP law program includes offerings in patent law, trademark law, copyright law, trade secret law, as well as IP law and society. Our students have unparalleled access to outstanding faculty and professional opportunities through innovative partnerships to build the foundation for a successful career. Read the announcement featured on ASU News here.\n\nStudent opportunities\n\nLisa Foundation Patent Law Clinic\n\nThe Lisa Foundation Patent Law Clinic is the first and oldest patent and trademark law clinic in the U.S. and the brainchild of prominent Chicago patent litigator Steven G. Lisa, a 1984 ASU Law alumnus. Generous funding from our donors established the clinic, where students gain hands-on experience in real-world patent and trademark prosecution, and learn skills needed to recognize and obtain valuable and enforceable patents and trademarks for clients whose IP may later be successfully licensed or litigated. In the process, students obtain limited recognition status to practice before the USPTO.\n\nLisa Foundation Advanced Patent Scholarship\n\nASU Law, in partnership with the Lisa Foundation, offers scholarships awarded on a competitive basis to students to research advanced patent law matters. The selected scholars gain direct training from Steve Lisa, a leading patent litigation and licensing attorney, in conducting a patent appeal to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In addition to the opportunity, recipients also receive a scholarship reward from the Lisa Foundation.\n\nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Clinic\n\nThe Entrepreneurship and Small Business Clinic is an innovative program that pairs inventors, entrepreneurs, and emerging companies with teams of ASU Law students. There are two primary objectives for the program. First, the clinic provides clients with legal services often unavailable to startups and small businesses. These services will help clients to operate with a stronger legal foundation as they grow and thrive. Second, the clinic will pro future lawyers with “real world” transactional practice experience. These students will be better prepared for their legal careers, post-graduation.\n\nThe McCarthy Institute\n\nCollaborating to solve IP and branding challenges\n\nLed by David Franklyn, one of the nation's preeminent experts on intellectual property and technology law, The McCarthy Institute sits at the intersection of trademark law, marketing, technology, and consumer behavior. A joint-program with ASU Law, The McCarthy Institute conducts regular symposia, workshops, networking groups, and pursues original IP and branding research and scholarship.\n\nJournals\n\nThe Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law supports Jurimetrics, The Journal of Law, Science, and Technology which emphasizes Intellectual Property Law. Jurimetrics is the official journal of the American Bar Association’s Section of Official Journal of Science & Technology Law. It is the oldest such journal in the country and one of a small number of student-edited, peer-reviewed law journals. It regularly publishes articles on topics relating to innovation, patent law and policy, and sustainability and technology.\n\nASU Law also supports the student led Sports and Entertainment Law Journal. As one of the leading sports and entertainment law journals in the United States, the Journal infuses legal scholarship and practice with new ideas to address today’s most complex sports and entertainment legal challenges. Among such challenges often arise issues relating to branding, creative ownership, and enforcement of copyright and trademark rights. Students may engage with the Journal further by becoming part of its executive board in their third year.\n\nCenter for Law, Science and Innovation\n\nASU Law is home to the nationally acclaimed Center for Law, Science and Innovation (LSI), which focuses on the extraordinary legal and regulatory questions rising from rapid developments in science and technology. LSI’s mission is to use law to enable innovation for the betterment of society. By facilitating interdisciplinary efforts among students, faculty, professionals, and policymakers, the center tackles the shared challenges in the governance of new and emerging technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, gene editing, and many others.\n\nIntellectual Property Student Association\n\nThe Intellectual Property Student Association (IPSA) is one of the largest and most active ASU Law student groups, providing speaker series, networking opportunities, and academic support to members throughout the year.\n\nLaw and Science Student Association\n\nThe Law and Science Student Association (LASSA) expands student opportunities, focusing on the ethical, legal, and social issues of cutting-edge science and emerging technologies.\n\nMoot Court\n\nASU Law has fielded numerous IP Moot Court Teams including two trademark moot court teams in the International Trademark Association’s 2019 Saul Lefkowitz Memorial Moot Court Competition winning numerous awards."
