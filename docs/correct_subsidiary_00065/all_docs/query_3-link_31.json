        "text": "Appendix A\n\nBiographies of Committee Members and Staff\n\nRobert W. Lucky, Chair, retired in 2003 as corporate vice president of Applied Research at Telcordia Technologies, which he joined in 1992. He began his telecommunications career at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., where he was initially involved in studying ways of sending digital information over telephone lines. The best-known outcome of this work was his invention of the adaptive equalizer—a technique for correcting distortion in telephone signals that is used in all high-speed data transmission today. The textbook on data communications that he co-authored became the most-cited reference in the communications field over the period of a decade. At Bell Labs he moved through a number of levels to become executive director of the Communications Sciences Research Division in 1982, where he was responsible for research on the methods and technologies for future communication systems. He has been active in professional activities and has served as president of the Communications Society of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), and as vice president and executive vice president of the parent IEEE. He has been editor of several technical journals, including the Proceedings of the IEEE, and since 1982 he has written the bimonthly “Reflections” column of personalized observations about the engineering profession in Spectrum magazine. In 1993 these “Reflections” columns were collected in the IEEE Press book Lucky Strikes … Again. He is a fellow of the IEEE and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He is also a consulting editor for a series of books on communications through Plenum Press. He has been on the advisory boards or committees of many universities and government organizations and was chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the United States Air Force from 1986 to 1989. He was the 1987 recipient of the prestigious Marconi Prize for his contributions to data communications, and he has been awarded honorary doctorates from Purdue University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He has also been awarded the Edison Medal of the IEEE and the Exceptional Civilian Contributions Medal of the U.S. Air Force. Lucky is a frequent speaker before both scientific and general audiences. He has been an invited lecturer at about 100 different universities and has been a guest on a number of network television shows, includ-\n\ning Bill Moyers’ “A World of Ideas,” where he discussed the impacts of future technological advances. He is the author of the popular book Silicon Dreams, a semi-technical and philosophical discussion of the ways in which both humans and computers deal with information.
