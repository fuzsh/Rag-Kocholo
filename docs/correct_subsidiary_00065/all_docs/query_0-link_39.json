Everything seemed ok, so I then placed the drives BACK into the original server since I was now able to have ESXi on it, but when I joined it into Vcenter 5.5, the storage seemed messed up. When I tried to add a VM, it threw up some errors and then when I checked the storage in the configuration, it gave me a \"no persistent storage found\" error and told me to add it. When I did, it gave me an error that it could not create a partition.\n\nWill the method I explained above not work for ESXi 5.5? Both servers have very similar hardware. They are both IBM X3550s\n\nThe issue in this case is likely, that the custom megaraid-sas vib - required for your RAID controller - is replaced by the update:\n\n2015-03-20T11:37:40Z esxupdate: imageprofile: DEBUG: VIB LSI_bootbank_scsi-megaraid-sas_6.606.06.00-1OEM.500.0.0.472560 is being removed from ImageProfile ESXi-Customizer\n\n2015-03-20T11:37:40Z esxupdate: imageprofile: INFO: Adding VIB VMware_bootbank_misc-drivers_5.5.0-2.54.2403361 to ImageProfile ESXi-Customizer\n\nWhat you need to do is to ensure that either the driver is not replaced (i.e. only install the required vibs, which might be difficult), or - after installing the patch, and before rebooting the host - replace the megaraid-sas driver again with the required one.\n\nThe latest driver can e found at https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=DT-ESXI55-LSI-SCSI-MEGARAID-SAS-66081100-1OEM&productId=353"
