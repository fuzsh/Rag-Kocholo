        "text": "Hi-tech is sexy. This may not have been true in the past, but the days when technology was of interest only to IT professionals and the trade publications that covered them have passed. This is due in part to consumers’ increasing use of technology products in the home, the abundance of consumer-friendly dot-coms and excitement surrounding booming hi-tech stocks. But another important factor is that internal PR departments have helped transform the images of formally stodgy outfits into some of the most exciting companies around.\n\nHi-tech is sexy. This may not have been true in the past, but the\n\ndays when technology was of interest only to IT professionals and the\n\ntrade publications that covered them have passed. This is due in part to\n\nconsumers’ increasing use of technology products in the home, the\n\nabundance of consumer-friendly dot-coms and excitement surrounding\n\nbooming hi-tech stocks. But another important factor is that internal PR\n\ndepartments have helped transform the images of formally stodgy outfits\n\ninto some of the most exciting companies around.\n\nBecause in-house PR pros are typically more invisible to the outside\n\nworld than their agency counterparts, PRWeek polled industry insiders\n\nand peeked behind the headlines to find the most influential, powerful\n\nand admired professionals in corporate hi-tech PR.\n\nWho are these movers and shakers? While backgrounds are as diverse as\n\nthe companies they work for, there are some interesting\n\nsimilarities.\n\nFirst, a majority of those profiled (26 out of 50), and a majority of\n\nthose nominated, are women.\n\nSecond, a number of pros fell into the field entirely by accident. For\n\nexample, Michelle Moore, Dell’s VP of corporate communications, majored\n\nin Balkan history at Stanford and got into PR because her first job was\n\nas an office manager for a PR firm. Andy Lark, VP of global\n\ncommunications for Nortel Networks, got laid off from his job as a chef\n\nand took a night job as a janitor at a PR firm where he eventually\n\nstarted writing press releases.\n\nWhile about a third put in time at agencies before moving in-house, a\n\nhandful of the best and brightest entered their current positions after\n\ncareers in journalism or politics, or both.\n\nKathy Bushkin, chief communications officer at AOL, says that while\n\nthere may have been more of a difference between politics and hi-tech in\n\nthe past, the two are now very similar, particularly with a company like\n\nAOL.\n\n’This medium is 24/7, and it’s like a permanent campaign,’ Bushkin\n\noffers.\n\n’You have to be very fast to respond to issues and shape the way they\n\ndevelop.’\n\nRespect for PR\n\nPR has always been more highly valued in the hi-tech world than in most\n\nother industries. As Bushkin explains, ’Hi-tech has recognized from the\n\nbeginning that there’s an advantage to getting the message out and being\n\nthe first mover.’\n\nAnd, unlike those in other, more tradition-bound fields such as\n\nfinancial services, today’s hi-tech in-house exec is more likely to be\n\nthe CEO’s right-hand man than the Rodney Dangerfield of corporate\n\nofficers. Rare is the hi-tech leader who has yet to realize and\n\nencourage PR’s role as a reputation and branding tool.\n\nWendy Ziner, director of marketing for Akamai Technologies, says she\n\ncurrently reports directly to her CEO, something she hasn’t had the\n\nopportunity to do in the past. ’I’ve never felt so plugged into the\n\ninner workings of the business. Clearly, the more information you have,\n\nthe more intelligent you can be. It’s much more strategic.’\n\nThe lure of the start-up\n\nOne of the most striking developments in corporate hi-tech PR is the\n\nemergence of two divergent career tracks, each with its own set of\n\nexpectations and benchmarks. Unlike the days when nearly every ambitious\n\nclient-side tech pro strove for the top posts at blue chip companies\n\n(IBM, Apple, Intel, Dell), many of the industry’s brightest talents now\n\nseek positions with start-ups.\n\nFor many in the start-up set - who, by definition, have been at their\n\njobs only a couple of years or less - the job description has broadened\n\ninto more nontraditional PR activities, many of which blur into the\n\nmarketing realm. Also, these professionals often have hefty, VC-fueled\n\nbudgets to play with. Rather than map out global strategies, they\n\nbrainstorm blockbuster events, like the launch party for Respond.com,\n\nwhich featured Cirque de Soleil acrobats, or Quokka’s press conference\n\non the set of Saturday Night Live, which featured appearances by Olympic\n\nathletes.\n\n’I feel as if I’m part of a cutting-edge industry,’ says Debby Fry\n\nWilson, director of public and government relations for drugstore.com.\n\n’We’re in an industry where there is no road map and there’s not some\n\nold-fashioned way of doing things.’\n\nNot that the big guys are languishing from a dearth of fresh blood; they\n\nare just generally attracting a different breed. ’The corporate track\n\nhas an entirely different value system, a system where compensation is\n\nbased on worth and hard work’ over a long time, rather than a quick\n\nstock-option hit, explains Seattle-based recruiter Judy Cushman, who\n\npublishes an online newsletter about hi-tech PR issues. ’In these\n\ncompanies, employees enter into a contract with the company that says\n\nthe employer dictates the terms. The emphasis is on linear\n\nprogression.’\n\nA further issue that bears watching: how PR execs with some of today’s\n\nhottest upstarts will be able to adjust as these companies inevitably\n\nexpand or get gobbled up. ’There are so many start-up companies that are\n\ngoing to be facing growth,’ says drugstore.com’s Fry Wilson. ’Many will\n\nhave the challenge of building a corporate communication department and\n\ndetermining what the right spread of resources is. The question is: How\n\ndo you do that without building a bureaucracy and still maintain a lean\n\nand trim PR machine?’\n\nBroader skills\n\nMost industry insiders believe that as the Internet market matures and\n\nstart-ups grow up into major corporations, there will be an increased\n\nneed for communications pros with broader skills in branding and\n\npositioning rather than nuts-and-bolts media relations. Finding these\n\nprofessionals might prove difficult, as those on the start-up track tend\n\nto concentrate on tactical matters before cashing out, and those on the\n\ncorporate track may not prove a great fit with more entrepreneurial\n\ncompanies.\n\nNo matter what track a corporate PR pro chooses, a division is emerging\n\nalong age lines in the hi-tech arena. Obviously, as execs get older and\n\nstart families, the idea of putting in 100-hour weeks and taking huge\n\nrisks becomes less enticing. ’That’s when people start looking at the\n\nmore mature companies that might be able to offer options like flex-time\n\nand telecommuting, things that start-ups cannot,’ Cushman says. That’s\n\nalso a time when those on the start-up track - who haven’t made millions\n\non an IPO - start flocking back to agencies, which can be equally\n\ngenerous in such soft benefits, especially since most do not offer stock\n\noptions.\n\nKeeping up with the Internet\n\nOne reality that presents tremendous challenges for PR pros is the\n\nmerger and acquisition activity in the hi-tech space. It’s a rare\n\nin-house hi-tech PR pro who hasn’t had a brush with at least one\n\nacquisition. (Geoff Kerr, VP of corporate communications at USWeb/CKS,\n\nhas dealt with more than 30.) The speed at which these events take place\n\nalso puts more stress on the internal PR structure.\n\nFor example, within four months, Stamps.com launched, entered into a\n\ndollars 56 million deal with AOL, bought Internet-based shipping company\n\niShip and spun off EncrypTix, its online ticket business, according to\n\nSeth Oster, senior director of corporate communication. ’How do you keep\n\npace with a company that is growing this fast?’ Oster asks.\n\nIndeed, more than almost any other industry, the hi-tech community\n\nplaces an emphasis on speed, and the pace has become even more\n\ndizzying.\n\n’Four or five years ago we were dealing with monthly and weekly\n\npublications, and now there are minute-by-minute and second-by-second\n\nreports,’ says Larry Sennett, Hewlett-Packard’s communications manager\n\nfor its office of the president and CEO. ’We need to examine what we say\n\nand how it will be interpreted, because we don’t have time to go back\n\nand say, ’We don’t want it put that way.’’\n\nDue to the pervasive influence of the Web and real-time media around the\n\nglobe, communications has become even more critical. ’If the whole\n\nInternet phenomena hasn’t shown the increasing importance of PR in the\n\nmarketing mix, I don’t know what will,’ Sennett says. ’As people begin\n\nto see more and more examples of how PR has impacted share price and the\n\npercentage of visibility on the outside, the last hold-outs are going to\n\nstart getting it.’\n\nAdds Reed Byrum, director of corporate PR at Electronic Data Systems\n\n(EDS): ’People now know more than ever before about your company.\n\nShareholders can download your annual report and see your financials,\n\nand that means PR professionals have higher obligations and need to have\n\na higher standard for all outgoing communications.’\n\nCommunications is complicated by the globalization of these\n\ncompanies.\n\nCentralizing the PR function to make sure the company issues consistent\n\nmessages worldwide is an increasing challenge for today’s hi-tech\n\nprofessionals on the client side. For example, Nortel’s Lark says his\n\ncompany has operations in 39 countries and a communications staff of\n\nmore than 100. To help get everyone on the same page, one of his main\n\ncharges has been to consolidate its number of outside agencies from 29\n\nto about two or three worldwide.\n\nAnother reason for the emphasis put on PR in these companies is the\n\nincreasing interest in technology itself, particularly among the\n\nfinancial media.\n\n’The business press fulfills the role that the trade press used to,’\n\nsays David Abramson, director of corporate communications for Juniper\n\nNetworks.\n\n’They go much farther down into the weeds than they used to and are not\n\njust glossing over technical things.’\n\nCommunications will always be important in a crisis, of course, and\n\nhi-tech companies have had their share. For example, Yvonne Donaldson,\n\ndirector of corporate communications for Tivoli, was at Compaq during an\n\nera of stock problems, lawsuits and product recalls.\n\n’Things can get pretty edgy,’ admits Donaldson, adding that the company\n\nhad to deal with more than 50,000 products that were found to have\n\nplug-in adapters that could cause electrocution if used improperly. ’We\n\nhad a number of discussions with product people who wanted to mitigate\n\nthe damage to the company. There was not only significant revenue\n\nimpact, but impact to our reputation with our customers.’\n\nOther challenges in-house pros in hi-tech companies face: agencies are\n\nmorphing from tacticians to strategy wonks, leaving the relatively small\n\ncorporate departments very busy. While many corporate in-house\n\ndepartments have a fair number of employees, some, particularly\n\nstart-ups, are operating with only a handful - or, in the case of Red\n\nHat, with one. Yet as the companies themselves get larger, the PR pros\n\nhave to focus more on internal communications to keep the culture\n\nintact.\n\nReaping the benefits\n\nOn the bright side, it’s a financially lucrative time to be working in\n\nhi-tech PR. As in agencies, demand for talent has never been stronger\n\nand compensation has never been so rich. As Silicon Valley executive\n\nrecruiter Susan Flesher points out, ’Just like anything, when demand\n\nexceeds supply, the price goes up. Add the fact that the perceived value\n\nof PR has risen, and you can see why salaries are continuing to\n\nrise.’\n\nOne thing’s for certain. Despite doomsayers’ predictions that\n\nconsolidation (and possible shakeouts) in the Internet space could end\n\nthese boom times, few in the industry are losing any sleep over job\n\nsecurity. ’There are so many openings for good people - it’s definitely\n\na seller’s market, and it’s a fabulous change over several years ago,’\n\nemphasizes Hewlett-Packard’s Sennett. The remuneration these pros enjoy\n\ncomes with many challenges - but clearly, they’re confronting them.\n\nDAVID J. ABRAMSON\n\nName: David J. Abramson\n\nCompany: Juniper Networks\n\nTitle: Director of corporate communications\n\nNo matter what else he achieves in his PR career, David Abramson will\n\nprobably always be known as ’that guy who bought the name to Candlestick\n\nPark.’ Abramson was corporate public affairs director for 3Com when the\n\nthen-unknown Silicon Valley company became the first tech firm to buy\n\ninto the ballpark-naming trend. According to 3Com stats, the move\n\ntranslated into about dollars 500,000 worth of publicity within the\n\nfirst six months. Today, Abramson heads up communications for super-hot\n\nstart-up Juniper Networks, which boasts a market cap of dollars 14\n\nbillion. Since signing on a year ago, Abramson has heralded such offbeat\n\nmarketing ideas as sponsoring the Armenian bobsled team.\n\nLORENE AREY\n\nName: Lorene Arey\n\nCompany: Cisco Systems\n\nTitle: Director of executive communications and corporate public\n\nrelations\n\nCisco Systems is the fastest growing company in the history of the\n\ncomputer industry and the third-highest valued company in the world.\n\nDuring the past six years, Lorene Arey has been instrumental in\n\npositioning the company as a global leader in networking for the\n\nInternet. Recent accomplishments for her 10-member corporate PR team,\n\nwhich oversees worldwide media relations, executive communications and\n\nexecutive technical services without the assist of a full-time agency of\n\nrecord, include a recent segment on ABC’s 20/20 spotlighting CEO John\n\nChambers as ’the best boss in America.’ Other highlights include\n\nBusinessWeek’s designation of Chambers as ’Mr. Internet’ as well as one\n\nof the top 25 executives worldwide for the second time in three\n\nyears.\n\nRICHARD BADLER\n\nName: Richard Badler\n\nCompany: Unisys\n\nTitle: Vice president, corporate communications\n\nSince joining Unisys in July 1998, Richard Badler has been credited with\n\ndirecting the successful evolution of the company’s image from a\n\ndowntrodden manufacturer of computer hardware to an entrepreneurial\n\nprovider of information technology services and solutions. The success\n\nof the company’s brand revitalization is partially due to Badler’s\n\nability to demonstrate to senior executives the impact that integrated\n\ncommunications and reputation management can have on the company,\n\naccording to Chris Broderick, principal at BSMG Worldwide, which\n\nrepresents Unisys. Badler oversees the corporation’s activities in the\n\nareas of reputation management, public and media relations, consultant\n\nrelations, advertising, employee communications, corporate identity and\n\npublic affairs.\n\nPAT BECKER\n\nName: Pat Becker\n\nCompany: Electronic Arts\n\nTitle: Director of corporate communications and government relations\n\nOne of the few high-ranking women in the male-dominated gaming industry,\n\nPat Becker is widely regarded by competitors and colleagues as the best\n\nin the business. In the six years she’s been with Electronic Arts - the\n\nworld’s biggest developer of video games - Becker has overseen a\n\ncommunications program that boosted media coverage by 100% (including\n\nmore than dollars 6 million worth of broadcast air time), helped develop\n\nand launch the company’s first web site and drove its online privacy\n\npolicy development and compliance worldwide. Becker also served as the\n\nkey contact for government lobbying efforts. Becker recently won the\n\n1999 Redwood City-San Mateo County Athena Award for Businesswoman of the\n\nYear.\n\nCHARLES BELLFIELD\n\nName: Charles Bellfield\n\nCompany: Sega of America\n\nTitle: Director of marketing communications\n\nAt the tender age of 30, Charles Bellfield has already engineered\n\ncommunications for a corporate turnaround and steered one of the most\n\nsuccessful consumer product launches in history. In charge of all\n\nexternal communications, Bellfield drove the dollars 100 million,\n\nsix-month PR and advertising push that took Sega out of last place in\n\nthe gaming race and made its Dreamcast console one of Christmas 1999’s\n\nmust-have gifts. Not that this marcom whiz kid has any plans for slowing\n\ndown in 2000. Bellfield says he’s already gearing up to ward off\n\ncompeting products coming down the pike with reinforced branding and\n\ncommunications to Sega’s key customer: the 12-to-24-year-old male,\n\nhardcore gamer.\n\nALBERT ’RUSTY’ BRASHEAR\n\nName: Albert ’Rusty’ Brashear\n\nCompany: Motorola\n\nTitle: Senior vice president and director, corporate communications and\n\npublic affairs\n\nAs the lead corporate communications and public affairs executive for\n\nMotorola since 1987, Rusty Brashear is responsible for all of the PR and\n\nissues management across the telecom giant’s operations worldwide.\n\nHowever, before joining the company 13 years ago, Brashear’s experience\n\nwas concentrated in the realms of politics and journalism. Prior to\n\nMotorola, Brashear served on the White House staff as special assistant\n\nto President Reagan and deputy press secretary for domestic affairs.\n\nBefore that, he served as assistant to the secretary and public affairs\n\ndirector for the US Department of the Interior and press director for\n\nthe EPA.\n\nKEVIN BROWN\n\nName: Kevin Brown\n\nCompany: Inktomi\n\nTitle: Director of marketing\n\nNot every hi-tech PR professional has a sexy, consumer-friendly brand\n\nlike Amazon.com or Yahoo! to promote. Some of the most gifted\n\ncommunications pros making waves today are those, like Inktomi’s Kevin\n\nBrown, who have found a way to make the esoteric relevant to the\n\nbusiness press and everyday consumers. As the first full-time employee\n\nat what was a tiny start-up five years ago, Brown employed public\n\nrelations and marketing communications to position the company as a\n\npioneer in Internet infrastructure - ’a really radical idea at the\n\ntime,’ he admits. And Brown’s efforts have definitely begun to pay off.\n\nIn the past year, he has achieved what he calls his career highlight to\n\ndate: landing Inktomi on the covers of Forbes, Fortune and Business\n\nWeek.\n\nKEVIN BURR\n\nName: Kevin Burr\n\nCompany: Adobe Systems Title: Senior director of public relations\n\nLong before any of the dot-coms entered the scene, Adobe Systems was\n\nbusy making a name for itself as one of Silicon Valley’s most visible\n\nand successful players. Today it is Kevin Burr’s job to keep the mammoth\n\nsoftware company on its winning course, overseeing all external and\n\nexecutive communications. And although Burr has been at Adobe for only a\n\nfew months, his background includes top corporate PR posts at a number\n\nof high-profile tech companies, including Conner Peripherals and Silicon\n\nGraphics, where he helped establish a framework to communicate the\n\ntroubled company’s turnaround.\n\nKATHY BUSHKIN\n\nName: Kathy Bushkin\n\nCompany: America Online\n\nTitle: Chief communications officer and senior vice president\n\nForging a new medium presents tremendous challenges, but Kathy Bushkin,\n\nwho has been with AOL for more than two years, appears to be tackling\n\nthem with aplomb. She has helped shape public policy around the issue of\n\nopen access, assisted AOL in taking a strong lead in online privacy and\n\noutlining privacy guidelines for AOL employees, and has handled\n\ncommunication surrounding AOL’s numerous mergers, including ones with\n\nCompuServe, Netscape and MovieFone(and presumably, the recently\n\nannounced merger with Time Warner as well). Previously, Bushkin was head\n\nof the national media relations practice at Hill & Knowlton. She also\n\nserved as Sen. Gary Hart’s press secretary during his 1984 presidential\n\ncampaign.\n\nCHARLES BYERS\n\nName: Charles Byers\n\nCompany: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) North\n\nAmerica\n\nTitle: Director of communications\n\nFew things showcase a PR pro’s media acumen better than his or her\n\nability to manage - and triumph over - a disaster situation. That’s why\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s Charles Byers deserves more than his share of\n\nkudos for successfully handling the company’s communications during the\n\nmassive earthquake that recently struck Taiwan. Manning the phones\n\naround-the-clock over the 10-day period after the quake, Byers says he\n\ndid ’more than 100 interviews,’ acting as the de facto spokesperson for\n\nTaiwan’s semiconductor industry. ’My biggest accomplishment was managing\n\nto keep the company’s reputation above water against the odds of all the\n\ndoomsayers,’ says Byers.\n\nREED BOLTON BYRUM\n\nName: Reed Bolton Byrum\n\nCompany: Electronic Data Systems (EDS)\n\nTitle: Director, corporate public relations\n\nAs EDS’ top PR exec since 1998, Reed Byrum has been instrumental in the\n\ndollars 17 billion company’s recent reorganization and repositioning\n\nunder new CEO Dick Brown. Over the past year, Byrum has created the\n\ncompany’s first-ever comprehensive global strategy to raise awareness\n\nand inform audiences about its turnaround, new corporate direction and\n\nY2K initiatives. As part of this, he has developed new - and repaired\n\nold - media relationships and doubled coverage in top-tier business\n\npublications and programs including Business Week, The Wall Street\n\nJournal and CNBC. Prior to EDS, Byrum held a variety of corporate PR\n\nposts and had his own agency in Silicon Valley.\n\nPAUL CAPELLI\n\nName: Paul Capelli\n\nCompany: Amazon.com\n\nTitle: Senior public relations manager\n\nIn 1999, Amazon.com proved it was far from yesterday’s news, continuing\n\nits reign as media darling of the Internet set with more positive\n\ncoverage than ever - including the recent naming of CEO Jeff Bezos as\n\nTime magazine’s ’Person of the Year.’ The man behind the year’s\n\npublicity blitz was Paul Capelli, a consumer product marketing pro who\n\njoined Amazon.com in 1998 from Ketchum to steer the company’s external\n\ncommunications as it transitioned from an online bookseller to a mega\n\ne-tailer of everything under the sun.\n\nWorking alongside corporate communications VP Bill Currie, Capelli\n\nmanaged to expand Amazon’s brand awareness further and stem off\n\npotential crises as the company faced holiday delays and shortages.\n\nKATIE COTTON\n\nName: Katie Cotton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nTitle: Director of corporate communications\n\nFew product launches in history - especially in the hi-tech arena - have\n\nmade as big a media splash as the Apple iMac. And, from a PR and\n\ncommunications standpoint, Katie Cotton is the woman who made it all\n\nhappen. For the past three years, Cotton has headed up media relations,\n\ncorporate events and employee communications throughout Apple’s amazing\n\nturnaround, largely spurred on by the 1998 iMac and ’five flavors’\n\ndebut. While Cotton is quick to credit her team and the company’s\n\nproducts, it’s clear her pre-Apple agency-side experience contributed to\n\nher success. Previously, Cotton spent several years handling interactive\n\nentertainment and hi-tech accounts for the Los Angeles-based Killer App\n\nCommunications.\n\nPATRICK DI CHIRO\n\nName: Patrick Di Chiro\n\nCompany: etrade\n\nTitle: Vice president, global corporate communications\n\nAs the most-visited Web destination and one of the top-five most\n\nrecognized brand names on the Internet, eTrade might seem to have little\n\nneed for skillful PR at this point. But recently appointed corporate\n\ncommunications VP Patrick Di Chiro disagrees. ’When you are such a\n\nhigh-profile company, you are under the microscope all the time,’ he\n\nnotes. As the point person for all of eTrade’s reputation management,\n\nmedia relations, investor relations and employee communications, Di\n\nChiro says his primary goal is to ’enhance, promote and protect’ the\n\ncompany’s image into the 21st century. The seasoned exec’s resume\n\nincludes top posts with Visa, American Express and Ketchum.\n\nYVONNE DONALDSON\n\nName: Yvonne Donaldson\n\nCompany: Tivoli Systems\n\nTitle: Director, corporate communications\n\nTivoli Systems recruited Yvonne Donaldson following its acquisition by\n\nIBM and during the height of its explosive growth - 200% revenue growth\n\nand 300-plus employee expansion in less than two years. Donaldson\n\ncreated the company’s first worldwide strategic PR, analyst relations\n\nand executive communications programs and established a communications\n\nframework that was used to direct the company’s first three corporate\n\nacquisitions (Software Artistry, Unison Software and a unit of Mercury\n\nComputer Systems). Before that, she spent more than six years at Compaq,\n\nwhere she developed PR strategies for the company’s first-ever product\n\nrecall, which was heralded as a model for truth-telling in media\n\nrelations.\n\nBRUCE ENTIN\n\nName: Bruce Entin\n\nCompany: LSI Logic\n\nTitle: Vice president, worldwide marketing\n\nThese days in Silicon Valley, it’s not often you find a hardcore\n\nex-business journalist in a top corporate communications post, and even\n\nrarer still to see one who has actually infiltrated the marketing ranks.\n\nBut LSI Logic’s Bruce Entin has done all that and more. In the 15 years\n\nthis former San Jose Mercury News tech writer has worked for the dollars\n\n2 billion chip company, he has been credited with pioneering the\n\npractice of making public announcements of new process technologies to\n\nthe business press and helping to create LSI’s repositioning story along\n\nthe ’System on a Chip’ theme in 1992.\n\nEntin served as VP of corporate communications at Atari and spent seven\n\nyears as a reporter prior to joining LSI.\n\nSUSAN FALLON\n\nName: Susan Fallon\n\nCompany: Novell\n\nTitle: Director of global market relations\n\nAfter 15 years in hi-tech PR, most recently as director of global market\n\nrelations for Novell, Susan Fallon has developed a reputation for quick\n\nthinking and a no-nonsense, results-oriented approach to\n\ncommunications.\n\nOver the past year, her efforts in media and analyst relations have paid\n\noff with increased press coverage and a marked rise in penetration of\n\nkey messages for Novell, the world leader in directory-enabled\n\nnetworking products and services. In the midst of software releases,\n\nproduct launches and executive speaking engagements, she has also\n\ntackled several crisis situations. Prior to her current position, Fallon\n\nspent four years in corporate PR at Sun Microsystems.\n\nJUDIE HAYES\n\nName: Judie Hayes\n\nCompany: Critical Path Title: Vice president of corporate\n\ncommunications\n\nTaking chances has certainly paid off for Judie Hayes and Critical Path,\n\nan Internet messaging company. Hayes saw the company through a\n\nsuccessful IPO in a condensed time frame and supported development of\n\nthe brand almost exclusively through PR activities. She convinced\n\nexecutives to allow tech publication Red Herring to follow the company\n\nthrough its quiet period and into its IPO. Following the initial IPO and\n\na secondary offering six weeks later, the company, which had minimal\n\nrevenue in 1998, raised dollars 250 million. The work with Red Herring\n\nresulted in an eight-page cover story.\n\nCompany co-founder David Hayden was highlighted as one of Forbes’ ’Most\n\nInfluential People on the Internet.’ Hayes also created external\n\ncommunications programs through seven merger and acquisitions over the\n\npast nine months.\n\nATCHISON FRAZER\n\nName: Atchison Frazer\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard Co.\n\nTitle: Director of worldwide media relations, Enterprise and Commercial\n\nBusiness Unit\n\nNew CEO Carly Fiorina may have stolen most of the headlines to date, but\n\nHewlett-Packard’s so-called ’e-services’ division will likely be the\n\nreal key to HP’s turnaround effort into 2000. At the helm of that unit’s\n\ncommunications ship is Atchison Frazer, who joined HP last year to\n\ndirect media relations for the commercial and enterprise business led by\n\nAnn Livermore and Nick Earle. With more than 15 years agency-side\n\nexperience (Porter Novelli, Edelman and Creamer Dickson Basford) and\n\ncorporate posts (Lexmark, IBM) under his belt, Frazer is well-equipped\n\nfor his new job.\n\nFrazer’s career highlights include the debut of Dow Jones’ Personal\n\nJournal in 1995 and advising CompuServe during its successful IPO in\n\n1996.\n\nAMANDA HIGGINS\n\nName: Amanda Higgins\n\nCompany: GO Network\n\nTitle: Senior PR manager\n\nAmanda Higgins joined the GO Network (then Infoseek) in December 1997 as\n\nthe first in-house PR manager the company had employed in seven\n\nmonths.\n\nShe saw the company through its transformation from a seventh-placed\n\nsearch engine to a top-five portal. The launch of the GO Network -\n\norchestrated by Higgins and her team, as well as the assets of partners\n\nincluding Walt Disney and ABC - resulted in a one-day stock climb of\n\n67%. Higgins also managed thorny PR issues, such as the June 1999\n\nannouncement that Disney would acquire the rest of Infoseek and form a\n\nseparate Internet division with its own trading stock and the\n\nannouncement that Infoseek CEO Harry Motro would leave the company after\n\nthe acquisition.\n\nMARK FREDRICKSON\n\nName: Mark Fredrickson\n\nCompany: EMC Corp.\n\nTitle: Director of corporate communications\n\nMark Fredrickson is credited with helping to change the perception of\n\nstorage from an ’unsexy’ topic to a strategic technology investment, and\n\nhas positioned EMC as the leader in enterprise storage.

Fredrickson oversees a network of more than 25 PR\n\nagencies around the world. He also handled external communication\n\nsurrounding EMC’s dissolution of its relationship with its largest OEM,\n\nHewlett-Packard.\n\nDIANE HUNT\n\nName: Diane Hunt\n\nCompany: Yahoo! Inc.\n\nTitle: Senior director, corporate communications\n\nAs one of the most highly recognized brands on the Web, with a market\n\ncap surpassing dollars 107 billion, Yahoo! is often held up as the top\n\nmarketing success story of the Internet era.

She built and now leads a team responsible for\n\nall aspects of Yahoo!’s external communications, including media,\n\ncommunity and analyst relations, public policy strategy and crisis\n\ncommunications. Since joining in early 1997, Hunt has grown the internal\n\ncorporate communications organization as the company ballooned from 200\n\nto 2,000 employees.

After cutting his teeth at Sun\n\nMicrosystems, Oracle and EcoSystems Software, Fry joined BEA in 1995 as\n\nemployee number six. Over the past four years, he has helmed BEA’s\n\ninternal and external communications programs worldwide as it grew to a\n\ndollars 500 million company with more than 2,000 employees, handling\n\ndozens of company and technology acquisition announcements and managing\n\ncom-munications for its April 1997 IPO.

But her\n\ninvolvement outside Motorola is equally impressive. She was appointed to\n\nthe Arthur Page Society Board of Trustees in 1998 and to the Council of\n\nCorporate Communications Executives of The Conference Board in 1993. She\n\nis also currently president of Johnson-Fry Enterprises, a commercial and\n\nresidential real estate investment and development company.\n\nKIRSTEN KAPPOS-HAMLING\n\nName: Kirsten Kappos-Hamling\n\nCompany: EarthLink\n\nTitle: Vice president, corporate communications\n\nHaving stewarded communications over the past three years for the\n\nnumber-two ISP brand, Kirsten Kappos-Hamling owns one of the most\n\nvisible positions in the hi-tech PR space. But with EarthLink’s recent\n\nMindSpring merger, she faces an even greater challenge: catching up to\n\nAmerica Online. Reporting to the CEO, Kappos-Hamling oversees all of\n\nEarthLink-MindSpring’s integrated marketing initiatives, including PR,\n\nemployee communications and investor relations. She says her goal has\n\nbeen and continues to be ’staying focused on taking the leadership\n\nposition without losing sight of our customer service.’ Prior to\n\nEarthLink, Kappos-Hamling served as VP for Shafer Advertising and PR and\n\nheaded up Ingram-Micro’s PR department.\n\nANDY LARK\n\nName: Andy Lark\n\nCompany: Nortel Networks\n\nTitle: Vice president of global communications\n\nAs manager of Fleishman-Hillard’s Nortel Networks account, New Zealand\n\nnative Andy Lark so impressed the client that it stole him away from the\n\nagency in early 1999 to become its chief communications executive. Since\n\nthen, Lark has reinvigorated and reorganized the communications function\n\nfor this dollars 20-million networking giant. With Lark at the wheel,\n\nNortel’s stock price has leapt more than 240%, surpassing competitors\n\nLucent and Cisco. And according to qualitative and quantitative\n\nresearch, the company has shifted its identity among target audiences\n\nfrom that of a ’telecom equipment supplier’ to a key Internet player.\n\nWhile with Fleishman, Lark worked on accounts for such blue-chip\n\ncompanies as Microsoft and Dell Computers.\n\nGEOFF KERR\n\nName: Geoff Kerr\n\nCompany: USWeb/CKS\n\nTitle: VP of corporate communications\n\nAs employee number 30 at USWeb in 1996, Geoff Kerr has seen the company\n\nthrough 30-plus mergers and acquisitions, including the merger of USWeb\n\nwith CKS, the acquisition of Mitchell Madison Group and the pending\n\ndollars 8-billion merger with Whittman-Hart.

He handles PR, industry analyst\n\nrelations, thought leadership, client communications and IR. Previously,\n\nKerr spent four years at Cunningham Communication, managing its\n\nnetworking and communications practice.\n\nMARGARET LASECKE-JACOBS\n\nName: Margaret Lasecke-Jacobs\n\nCompany: Oracle Corp.\n\nTitle: Vice president, global corporate communications\n\nCelebrity CEO Larry Ellison’s mug is now synonymous with Silicon Valley\n\nsuccess, and Oracle - once an obscure database software company - is now\n\na household name among ordinary Joes. You can thank Margaret\n\nLasecke-Jacobs for that. Since joining eight years ago from Fujitsu as\n\nthe company’s first in-house PR pro, Lasecke-Jacobs has helped build\n\nOracle’s image as a global superpower. She steered the company, which\n\nwas previously tracked mainly by the trades, into the mainstream\n\nconsumer and business press, and considers her ’watershed moment’ the\n\nday her team got Ellison on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Later, her team\n\nhelped promote Ellison’s idea for the network computer, which generated\n\nhuge press around the world.\n\nJESSICA KERSEY\n\nName: Jessica Kersey\n\nCompany: Macromedia\n\nTitle: Director of corporate communications\n\nJessica Kersey has achieved much in her post with Macromedia, the\n\ncompany behind popular graphic design and Web publishing software\n\nprograms such as FreeHand and Dreamweaver, as well as interactive\n\nentertainment site Shockwave.com. Since May 1999, Kersey has instituted\n\na competitive communications review process, speakers’ bureaus,\n\nproactive industry analyst relations and a program for strategic\n\npartners. However, many Silicon Valley insiders probably remember Kersey\n\nbest from her stint as the top PR dog at Novell during its glory days\n\nfrom 1992 to 1995. Kersey also made a name for herself in tech circles\n\nduring the late eighties, when she spent six years driving PR for PC\n\nMagazine.\n\nMELISSA LONDON\n\nName: Melissa London\n\nCompany: Red Hat\n\nTitle: PR director\n\nAs PR director of one of the hottest hi-tech start-ups, Melissa London\n\nhas ensured that Red Hat and Linux have become household words. Add the\n\nfact that London is the only PR person inside the company - which does\n\nno advertising - and it’s hard to dispute what an incredible job she’s\n\ndone. Since joining the company three years ago, London, who had no\n\nprevious PR experience, has directed a PR effort that has generated\n\nthousands of articles, and resulted in Red Hat achieving ten times the\n\nbrand recognition of its next-best-known competitor, according to a\n\nFebruary 1999 Linux World survey. The November 1999 Harris Interactive\n\nsurvey ranked Red Hat as the 17th ’best regarded’ company, right after\n\nIBM and Motorola.\n\nJANINE KROMHOUT\n\nName: Janine Kromhout\n\nCompany: BroadVision\n\nTitle: Director of PR\n\nDuring Janine Kromhout’s tenure, BroadVision has seen a 1,081% increase\n\nin stock valuation and a growth in its customer base from eight to more\n\nthan 450.

Previously, she helped grow The\n\nWeber Group’s Palo Alto office from three people to 40.\n\nMICH MATHEWS\n\nName: Mich Mathews\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nTitle: Vice president, corporate communications\n\nNo matter how you feel about Microsoft as a company, it’s hard to\n\ndispute the sheer muscle of its PR machine - especially given the daily\n\nchallenges it has faced with Bill Gates and the antitrust trial. And, as\n\nillustrated in a 1998 Brill’s Content article, Mich Mathews is clearly\n\nthe brains behind the software giant’s communications. Working alongside\n\nagency of record Waggener Edstrom, Mathews officially leads all\n\ncommunication plans and strategies, including PR and advertising.\n\nUnofficially, she is said to be Gates’ right-hand communications\n\nconsultant. Her proximity to the chief exec can be traced in part to her\n\nlong history with the company; prior to joining Microsoft in 1993,\n\nMathews handled its UK account for Text 100.\n\nKEVIN MCKEE\n\nName: Kevin McKee\n\nCompany: IBM\n\nTitle: Director of communications, Storage Systems Division\n\nEven in a company as big as IBM, Kevin McKee has managed to make his\n\nmark as an essential communications player. As director of the San Jose,\n\nCA-based Storage Systems Division, McKee oversees all PR, consultant\n\nrelations and internal communications for the company’s storage\n\nproducts.\n\nThe stellar results by his team are said to have even gotten nods from\n\nCEO Lou Gerstner - certainly not the norm for most division PR\n\nheads.\n\nSome of McKee’s success on the media relations side can likely be traced\n\nto his journalism background. Prior to being, as he says, ’seduced by\n\nthe dark side,’ McKee spent several years as a writer and editor for\n\ntechnology pubs.\n\nMICHELE PERRY\n\nName: Michele Perry\n\nCompany: Lycos\n\nTitle: Director of marketing communications\n\nIt’s hard to keep on top of the changes at Lycos and harder still to\n\ncommunicate them to the press, but Michele Perry has done just that.\n\nSince she joined Lycos in the spring of 1998, the company’s brand\n\nawareness and media coverage have increased significantly, traffic on\n\nthe Lycos Network has climbed to more than 30 million unique visitors\n\nper month and the company’s stock price is flirting with its all-time\n\nhigh. Perry has overseen external communications for six major\n\nacquisitions in the past 12 months, as well as the rise and fall of the\n\nUSA Networks deal.\n\nShe has ultimate responsibility for launching new products and\n\ninitiatives, as well as communicating consumer, advertising, industry\n\nand investment messages.\n\nMICHELLE MOORE\n\nName: Michelle Moore\n\nCompany: Dell Computer Corp.\n\nTitle: Vice president, corporate communications\n\nIn an industry where employee loyalty and longevity are scarce, Michelle\n\nMoore is an anomaly. Since joining Dell in 1989, she has assisted in the\n\ncompany’s rise from the 25th-largest PC maker in the world to its\n\ncurrent place as number one in the US and number two in the world - a\n\ndollars 24 billion corporation with more than 30,000 employees.

But for eBay’s\n\nKevin Pursglove, putting out media fires is almost a daily occurrence.\n\nSince joining the wildly popular auction site a year ago, Pursglove has\n\ntackled such PR challenges as prolonged outages, questions about its\n\ncompetitive business policies and a constant barrage of individuals\n\nready to sell everything from body parts to babies. Despite the\n\nobstacles - and as a testament to Pursglove’s media relations skills -\n\neBay has retained its status as a top-five destination for Web surfers\n\nand its leadership position in an increasingly crowded market.\n\nBOB O’BRIEN\n\nName: Bob O’Brien\n\nCompany: Compuware’s NuMega Lab\n\nTitle: Manager of corporate communications\n\nIn the five years he has been managing PR for NuMega, a once-tiny\n\ndebugging software tools developer acquired by Compuware in 1998, Bob\n\nO’Brien has achieved results and the respect of his industry peers. Most\n\nsay O’Brien’s efficient and friendly manner with reporters and\n\ninfluencers has been the key to NuMega’s extraordinary track record with\n\npress coverage (it has garnered hundreds of clips) and its numerous\n\n’best of’ product awards.\n\nAccording to one former co-worker, O’Brien ’was able to turn sand into\n\ngold’ at the tiny engineer-driven start-up by ’uncovering new\n\nopportunities with key partners and industry contacts.’\n\nRUSS ROBINSON\n\nName: Russ Robinson\n\nCompany: Sprint Advanced Technologies\n\nTitle: Director of corporate communications\n\nRuss Robinson provides a good argument for the power of PR within the\n\nmarketing mix. He led the communications team that launched Sprint\n\nPassport, the company’s ISP, in 1996, garnering more than 200,000\n\ncustomers for the new service without any advertising support.
