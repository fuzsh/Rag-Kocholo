Comment below if you plan on attending! LSI Scott Pantel Henry Peck #LSIAlumni #medtech #healthtech\n\nAttention medical companies, A government healthcare entity in Asia is actively seeking advanced technologies and solutions pertaining to medical screening for the public, sophisticated voice-to-text documentation systems, and advancements in diabetes prevention and management. FDA/CE approvals or a proven track record of significant sales in US/EU markets is a must. If your company meets these criteria and seeks expansion opportunities, I cordially invite you to connect with me here on LinkedIn.\n\nDear Ofri Haggai and all Haggai family. The pain and frustration is unbearable. Where are the living hostages? Where are those who have died? Where are the so-called \"liberals\" or \"humanitarians\" whose minds have been kidnapped by Hamas? And where are the world leaders whose leadership has been kidnapped as well? If you allow the elderly and babies to be held hostage and support the savages who kidnap them, you are neither liberals nor leaders. First, they take Israeli babies, then they will take your \"liberal\" babies. #BringThemHome #StnandWithIsrael # Hamas=Isis\n\nIn usual year it’s a happy feast, marking the freedom of the Jewish people from Egypt. Tonight me feast, no happiness, no freedom. Ofri Haggai everyone with a heart and a brain is behind you and together with all the families."
