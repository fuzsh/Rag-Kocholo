        "text": "Think of LSI as sort of the Guy Incognito in the storage industry.\n\nLSI’s chips control the flow of information within hard disks and large storage systems. In addition, the company makes full storage systems which companies like I.B.M., Sun Microsystems/Oracle and Dell sell under their own brands. About 80 percent of LSI’s $2.7 billion in revenue last year came from the sale of storage technology, but few people outside of this market realize the company’s reach.\n\n“We don’t brand any of our stuff,” says Abhi Talwalkar, the company’s chief executive, rather proudly.\n\nLSI prefers to maneuver in the shadows.\n\nPeople have a tendency to staple the storage industry with the ‘Dull’ tag, knocking it as one of the more sedate parts of the hardware business. Make disk. Put disk in box. Store data. Replace disk with bigger disk. Wash, rinse and repeat.\n\nBut Mr. Talwalkar promises grander things to come, particularly as networking companies like Cisco Systems and Huawei try and make better use of storage systems in their products.\n\n“We are having more meetings about storage products with networking companies than we ever have before,” Mr. Talwalkar says.\n\nThe executive, who took over LSI four years ago after running Intel’s server chip business, attributes the rising interest in storage gear to the increase of multi-media and location-based services on cell phones.\n\nNetworking companies need to place more storage directly in their systems in order to make sure that bulky video and audio files reach people more quickly. In addition, it makes sense to scatter data around different parts of a country as consumers use location-based functions that require quick responses.\n\n“There are a ton of location-based services that are finally starting to become real,” Mr. Talwalkar says.\n\nIn 2007, LSI also bought a company called Tarari that had both silicon and software aimed at inspecting and analyzing data traffic in real-time so that machines can make rapid decisions about the information. Typically, companies will use such technology for security purposes, as they try to finger and block malicious streams of data coming into their data centers before it spreads out to the business’s servers or employees’ machines.\n\nLSI, however, hopes that customers will use this technology for additional purposes like prioritizing video traffic on their networks or speeding up business software.\n\nThis networking intelligence pitch is an obvious one for LSI as it seeks growth in new markets.\n\nMr. Talwalkar insists that LSI has plenty of room to expand in its core markets even though it’s the number one player in most of its largest businesses.\n\n“There’s still a lot of money to be made in storage,” Mr. Talwalkar says. “It’s one of the few categories in hardware that has not had all of its profits sucked out.”\n\nThat said, plenty of people argue that the storage industry is on the verge of going through the same sort of standardization that has hit the PC and server businesses. The innards of mainstream storage boxes look more and more like basic servers every year.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Talwalkar argues that large storage companies will opt to spend less time designing their own hardware and more time on creating unique software tools and other features that gives their products an edge over rivals. If such a scenario plays out, a neutral hardware maker like LSI could make gains by building a larger portion of the storage systems sold by large hardware companies.\n\nLike any number of hardware makers, LSI ’s sales have declined during the recession. Last month, LSI reported a 27 percent decline in first quarter revenue to $482 million.\n\nThe company has also posted net losses the last two years on the back of numerous charges tied to the impairment of goodwill, restructuring and acquisitions."
