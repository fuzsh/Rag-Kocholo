Intel has changed the global marketplace dramatically since it was founded in 1968; the company invented the microprocessor, the \"computer on a chip\" that made possible the first handheld calculators and personal computers (PCs). By the early 21st century, Intel's microprocessors were found in approximately 80 percent of PCs worldwide. The company's product line also includes chipsets and motherboards; flash memory used in wireless communications and other applications; networking devices and equipment for accessing the Internet, local area networks, and home networks; and embedded control microchips used in networking products, laser printers, factory automation instruments, cellular phone base stations, and other applications. Intel has remained competitive through a combination of clever marketing, well-supported research and development, superior manufacturing proficiency, a vital corporate culture, prowess in legal matters, and an ongoing alliance with software giant Microsoft Corporation often referred to as \"Wintel.\"\n\n1968–79: From DRAM to the 8086\n\nIntel's founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were among the eight founders of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, established in 1957. While at Fairchild, Noyce and Moore invented the integrated circuit; in 1968, they decided to form their own company. They were soon joined by Andrew Grove, a Hungarian refugee who had arrived in the United States in 1956 and joined Fairchild in 1963. Grove would remain president and CEO of Intel into the 1990s.\n\nTo obtain start-up capital, Noyce and Moore approached Arthur Rock, a venture capitalist, with a one-page business plan simply stating their intention of developing large-scale integrated circuits. Rock, who had helped start Fairchild Semiconductor, as well as Teledyne and Scientific Data Systems, had confidence in Noyce and Moore and provided $3 million in capital. The company was incorporated on July 18, 1968, as N M Electronics (the letters standing for Noyce Moore), but quickly changed its name to Intel, formed from the first syllables of \"integrated electronics.\" Intel gathered another $2 million in capital before going public in 1971.\n\nNoyce and Moore's scanty business proposal belied a clear plan to produce large-scale integrated (LSI) semiconductor memories. At that time, semiconductor memories were ten times more expensive than standard magnetic core memories. Costs were falling, however, and Intel's founders surmised that with the greater speed and efficiency of LSI technology, semi-conductors would soon replace magnetic cores. Within a few months of its startup, Intel produced the 3101 Schottky bipolar memory, a high-speed random access memory (RAM) chip. The 3101 proved popular enough to sustain the company until the 1101, a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) chip, was perfected and introduced in 1969. The following year, Intel introduced the 1103, a 1-kilobyte (K) dynamic RAM, or DRAM, which was the first chip large enough to store a significant amount of information. With the 1103, Intel finally had a chip that really did begin to replace magnetic cores; DRAMs eventually proved indispensable to the personal computer.\n\nThe company's most dramatic impact on the computer industry involved its 1971 introduction of the 4004, the world's first microprocessor. Like many of Intel's innovations, the microprocessor was a byproduct of efforts to develop another technology. When a Japanese calculator manufacturer, Busicom, asked Intel to design cost-effective chips for a series of calculators, Intel engineer Ted Hoff was assigned to the project; during his search for such a design, Hoff conceived a plan for a central processing unit (CPU) on one chip. The 4004, which crammed 2,300 transistors onto a one-eighth- by one-sixth-inch chip, had the power of the old 3,000-cubic-foot ENIAC computer, which depended on 38,000 vacuum tubes.\n\nAlthough Intel initially focused on the microprocessor as a computer enhancement that would allow users to add more memory to their units, the microprocessor's great potential—for everything from calculators to cash registers and traffic lights—soon became clear. The applications were facilitated by Intel's introduction of the 8008, an 8-bit microprocessor developed along with the 4004 but oriented toward data and character (rather than arithmetic) manipulation. The 8080, introduced in 1974, was the first truly general purpose microprocessor. For $360, Intel sold a whole computer on one chip, while conventional computers sold for thousands of dollars. The response was overwhelming. The 8080 soon became the industry standard and Intel the industry leader in the 8-bit market.\n\nIn response to ensuing competition in the manufacture of 8-bit microprocessors, Intel introduced the 8085, a faster chip with more functions. The company was also developing two more advanced projects, the 32-bit 432 and the 16-bit 8086. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 but took two years to achieve wide use, and, during this time, Motorola, Inc. produced a competing chip (the 68000) that seemed to be selling faster. Intel responded with a massive sales effort to establish its architecture as the standard. When International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) chose the 8008, the 8086's 8-bit cousin, for its personal computer in 1980, Intel seemed to have beat out the competition.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Intel had also developed the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), another revolutionary but unintended research byproduct. Intel physicist Dov Frohman was working on the reliability problems of the silicon gate used in the MOS process when he realized that the disconnected, or \"floating,\" gates that were causing malfunctions could be used to create a chip that was erasable and reprogrammable. Since conventional ROM chips had to be permanently programmed during manufacture, any change required the manufacture of a whole new chip. With EPROM, however, Intel could offer customers chips that could be erased and reprogrammed with ultraviolet light and electricity. At its introduction in 1971, EPROM was a novelty without much of a market. But the microprocessor, invented at the same time, created a demand for memory; the EPROM offered memory that could be conveniently used to test microprocessors.\n\nAnother major development at Intel during this time was that of peripheral controller chips. Streamlined for specific tasks and stripped of unneeded functions, peripheral chips could greatly increase a computer's abilities without raising software development costs. One of Intel's most important developments in peripherals was the coprocessor, first introduced in 1980. Coprocessor chips were an extension of the CPU that could handle specific computer-intensive tasks more efficiently than the CPU itself. Once again, innovation kept Intel ahead of its competition.\n\nIntel's rapid growth, from the 12 employees at its founding in 1968 to 15,000 in 1980, demanded a careful approach to corporate culture. Noyce, Moore, and Grove, who remembered their frustration with Fairchild's bureaucratic bottlenecks, found that defining a workable management style was important. Informal weekly lunches with employees kept communication lines open while the company was small, but that system had become unwieldy. Thus, the founders installed a carefully outlined program emphasizing openness, decision-making on the lowest levels, discipline, and problem solving rather than paper shuffling. Moreover, the company's top executives eschewed such luxuries as limousines, expense account lunches, and private parking spaces to establish a sense of teamwork with their subordinates.\n\nIn an interview with the Harvard Business Review in 1980, Noyce remarked on the company's hiring policy, stating, \"we expect people to work hard. We expect them to be here when they are committed to be here; we measure absolutely everything that we can in terms of performance.\" Employee incentives included options on Intel stock, and technological breakthroughs were celebrated with custom-bottled champagne—\"Vintage Intel\" marked the first $250 million quarter, in 1983—the year sales reached $1 billion for the first time.\n\nCompany Perspectives:\n\nFor over 35 years, Intel Corporation has developed technology enabling the computer and Internet revolution that has changed the world. Founded in 1968 to build semiconductor memory products, Intel introduced the world's first micro-processor in 1971. Today, Intel supplies the computing and communications industries with chips, boards, systems, and software building blocks that are the \"ingredients\" of computers, servers and networking and communications products. These products are used by industry members to create advanced computing and communications systems. Intel's mission is to do a great job for our customers, employees, and stockholders by being the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide digital economy.\n\n1980s: From 286 to 486\n\nDuring the 1974 recession, Intel was forced to lay off 30 percent of its employees, and morale declined substantially as a result. Thus, in 1981, when economic struggles again surfaced, instead of laying off more employees, Intel accelerated new product development with the \"125 Percent Solution,\" which asked exempt employees to work two extra hours per day, without pay, for six months. A brief surge in sales the following year did not last, and, again, instead of more layoffs, Intel imposed pay cuts of up to 10 percent. Such measures were not popular among all its workforce, but, by June 1983, all cuts had been restored and retroactive raises had been made. Moreover, in December 1982, IBM paid $250 million for a 12 percent share of Intel, giving the company not only a strong capital boost, but also strong ties to the undisputed industry leader. IBM would eventually increase its stake to 20 percent before selling its Intel stock in 1987.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Intel began to slip in some of its markets. Fierce competition in DRAMs, static RAMs, and EPROMs left Intel concentrating on microprocessors. While competitors claimed that Intel simply gave away its DRAM market, Moore told Business Week in 1988 that the company deliberately focused on microprocessors as the least cyclical field in which to operate. Customer service, an area Intel had been able to overlook for years as it dominated its markets, became more important as highly efficient Japanese and other increasingly innovative competitors challenged Intel's position. In addition, Intel's manufacturing record, strained in years past by undercapacity, needed fixing. Fab 7, Intel's seventh wafer-fabrication plant, opened in 1983 only to face two years of troubled operations before reaching full capacity. Between 1984 and 1988, Intel closed eight old plants, and in 1988 it spent some $450 million on new technology to bring its manufacturing capacity into line with its developmental prowess.\n\nDespite these retrenchments, the company continued to excel in the microprocessor market. In 1982 Intel introduced its 80286 microprocessor, the chip that quickly came to dominate the upper-end PC market, when IBM came out with the 286-powered PC/AT. The 286 was followed in 1985 by Intel's 80386 chip, popularized in 1987 by the Compaq DESKPRO 386, and which, despite bugs when it first came out, became one of the most popular chips on the market. While the 286 brought to the personal computer a speed and power that gave larger computers their first real challenge, the 386 offered even greater speed and power together with the ability to run more than one program at a time. The 386 featured 32-bit architecture and 275,000 transistors, more than twice the number of the 286.\n\nIn 1989 Intel introduced the 80486, a chip Business Week heralded as \"a veritable mainframe-on-a-chip.\" The 486 included 1.2 million transistors and the first built-in math coprocessor, and was 50 times faster than the 4004, the first microprocessor. In designing the i486, Intel resisted an industry trend toward RISC (reduced instruction-set computing), a chip design that eliminated rarely used instructions in order to gain speed. Intel argued that what RISC chips gained in speed they lost in flexibility and that, moreover, RISC chips were not compatible with software already on the market, which Intel felt would secure the 486's position. A new chip, the 64-bit i860 announced in early 1989, however, did make use of RISC technology to offer what Intel claimed would be a \"supercomputer on a chip.\"\n\nAlso in 1989, a major lawsuit that Intel had filed against NEC Corporation five years before was decided. Intel had claimed that NEC violated its copyright on the microcode, or embedded software instructions, of Intel's 8086 and 8088 chips. Although Intel had licensed NEC to produce the microcode, NEC had subsequently designed a similar chip of its own. At issue was whether microcode could be copyrighted. The court ruled that it could but that NEC had not violated any copyright in the case at hand. The suit made public some issues surrounding Intel's reputation. Some rivals and consumers, for example, claimed that Intel used its size and power to repress competition through such tactics as filing \"meritless\" lawsuits and tying microprocessor sales to other chips. Other observers, however, praised Intel's protection of its intellectual property and, subsequently, its profits. The Federal Trade Commission conducted a two-year investigation of Intel's practices and did not recommend criminal charges against the company, but two rival companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cyrix Corporation, filed antitrust lawsuits against Intel in 1993.\n\n1990s: The Pentium Decade\n\nIntel's annual net income topped $1 billion for the first time in 1992, following a very successful, brand-building marketing campaign. Intel ads aggressively sought to bolster consumer interest in and demand for computers that featured \"Intel Inside.\" By late 1993, the company's brand equity totaled $17.8 billion, more than three times its 1992 sales. Also during this time, Intel began to branch out from chipmaking. In 1992 the company's Intel Products Group introduced network, communications, and personal conferencing products for retail sale directly to PC users.\n\nIn 1993 Intel released its fifth-generation Pentium processor, a trademarked chip capable of executing over 100 million instructions per second (MIPS) and supporting, for example, real-time video communication. The Pentium processor, with its 3.1 million transistors, was up to five times more powerful than the 33-megahertz Intel 486 DX microprocessor (and 1,500 times the speed of the 4004), but, in an unusual marketing maneuver, the company suggested that \"all but the most demanding users\" would seek out PCs powered by the previous chip. The Pentium's reputation was initially sullied by the revelation of an embedded mathematical flaw, but Intel moved quickly to fix the problem.\n\nKey Dates:\n\n1968:\n\nRobert Noyce and Gordon Moore incorporate N M Electronics, which is soon renamed Intel Corporation.\n\n1970:\n\nCompany develops DRAM, dynamic RAM.\n\n1971:\n\nIntel introduces the world's first microprocessor (the 4004) and goes public.\n\n1974:\n\nCompany introduces the first general purpose microprocessor (the 8080).\n\n1980:\n\nIBM chooses the Intel microprocessor for the first personal computer.\n\n1983:\n\nRevenues exceed $1 billion for the first time.\n\n1992:\n\nNet income tops $1 billion for the first time.\n\n1993:\n\nThe fifth generation chip, the Pentium, debuts.\n\n1996:\n\nRevenues surpass $20 billion, net income exceeds $5 billion.\n\n1997:\n\nCompany introduces the Pentium II microprocessor.\n\n1999:\n\nIntel debuts the Pentium III and is added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n2000:\n\nThe Pentium 4 hits the market.\n\n2003:\n\nThe Centrino technology for mobile computers is launched.\n\nThe company enjoyed a dramatic 50 percent revenue increase in 1993, reaching $8.78 billion from $5.84 billion in 1992. Moreover, Intel's net income leapt 115 percent to $2.3 billion, repudiating Wall Street's worries that competition had squeezed profit margins. While Intel faced strong competition both from chip makers such as Motorola's PowerPC and former partner IBM, its place at the leading edge of technology was undisputed.\n\nA key initiative that kept Intel ahead of its competitors was the company's move beyond chip design into computer design. With the advent of the Pentium, Intel began designing chipsets and motherboards, the latter being the PC circuit board that combined a microprocessor and a chipset into the basic subsystem of a PC. With the company now selling the guts of a PC, dozens of computer manufacturers began making and selling Pentium-based machines.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, as sales of PCs accelerated and multimedia and the Internet were beginning to emerge, Intel continued developing ever more powerful microprocessors. In 1995 the Pentium Pro hit the market sporting 5.5 million transistors and capable of performing up to 300 MIPS. Intel next added MMX technology to its existing line of Pentium processors. MMX consisted of a new set of instructions that was designed specifically to improve the multimedia performance of personal computers. Fueled by exploding demand, revenues hit $20.85 billion by 1996, while net income soared to $5.16 billion.\n\nAt this point Intel was continuing its longtime strategy of designing new, more powerful chips for the top end of the market while allowing previous-generation microprocessors to migrate down to the lower segments of the market. With the introduction of the Pentium II in May 1997, however, the company adopted a new strategy of developing a range of microprocessors for every segment of the computing market. The Pentium II, with 7.5 transistors, debuted with a top-end model that clocked at 300 megahertz. Originally designed for high-end desktop PCs, the Pentium II was soon adapted for use in notebook and laptop computers. With the following year came the launch of the Celeron processor, which was designed specifically for the value PC desktop sector, a rapidly growing segment of the market ever since the early 1997 debut of a sub-$1,000 PC from Compaq. Also in 1998 Intel for the first time designed a microprocessor, the Pentium II Xeon, especially for midrange and higher-end servers and workstations. At the same time Intel was moving into another burgeoning sector, that of embedded control chips for networking and other applications, such as digital set-top boxes.\n\nMeanwhile Intel settled a dispute with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) over the development of the Pentium chip by acquiring DEC's semiconductor operations. In May 1997 Craig R. Barrett was named president of Intel, having joined the company in 1974, serving as head of manufacturing starting in 1985, and being named chief operating officer in 1993. Grove remained chairman and CEO for one year, whereupon Barrett was named president and CEO, with Grove retaining the chairmanship. In early 1999 Intel reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission on an antitrust suit, thereby avoiding the protracted litigation and negative publicity that beset its Wintel partner, Microsoft, in the late 1990s. Reflecting the increasing importance of technology to the U.S. economy, Intel was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November 1999.\n\nDuring the late 1990s Intel made several strategic acquisitions that rapidly gave the company a significant presence in areas outside its microprocessor core: wireless communications products, such as flash memory for mobile phones and two-way pagers; networking building blocks, such as hubs, switches, and routers; and embedded control chips for laser printers, storage media, and automotive systems. Intel also entered the market for e-commerce services, rapidly building up the largest business-to-business e-commerce site in the world, with $1 billion per month in online sales by mid-1999. The company was not neglecting its core, however; in 1999 Intel had its largest microprocessor launch ever with the simultaneous introduction of 15 Pentium III and Pentium III Xeon processors.\n\nNew Strategies in the Less Buoyant Early 2000s\n\nThe new product launches continued in 2000, but they were accompanied by an uncharacteristic series of blunders. In February arch-rival AMD had bested Intel by releasing the first 1-gigahertz chip, the Athlon, which had the added benefit of being cheaper than the Pentium III. Intel responded by speeding a 1.13-gigahertz version of the Pentium III to market, but the processor simply did not work right and thousands had to be recalled. Further embarrassment came when the firm had to recall a million motherboards because of a faulty chip. Intel had also underestimated growth in PC sales, leaving its production capacity insufficient to meet the demands of computer makers, and it also cancelled plans to develop a low-end microprocessor called Timna that had been slated for budget PCs. Intel continued to encounter problems developing the complex Itanium 64-bit processor, the company's first, which was specifically designed, in partnership with Hewlett-Packard Company, to meet the needs of powerful Internet servers. The long-delayed Itanium, seven years in the making at a cost of $2 billion, finally reached the market in 2001, receiving a rather muted initial reception. (The Itanium line was later shifted from servers to high-end computers.) On the bright side, Intel successfully released the Pentium 4 in November 2000. This processor included 42 million transistors and ran at an initial speed of 1.5 gigahertz, enabling Intel to regain the lead in the ongoing chip-speed battle with AMD. Despite all of the year's travails, Intel reached new heights in financial performance, earning $10.54 billion in profits on revenues of $33.73 billion.\n\nThe bursting of the Internet bubble posed new challenges for Intel in 2001 as consumer spending on computers dropped off and corporate information technology managers pulled back as well. The fierce competition from AMD prompted Intel to initiate a brutal price war, which cut both revenues and profits, and it also slashed Intel's worldwide share of the microprocessor market to below 80 percent, compared to the 86.7 percent figure from 1998. In 2001 Barrett began jettisoning many of the new ventures and acquisitions that were part of the late 1990s diversification drive, in a renewed refocusing on microprocessors. Revenues for 2001 fell 21 percent to $26.54 billion—the first such drop since the mid-1980s tech recession—while profits plummeted 87 percent to $1.29 billion. Early the following year, Paul Otellini was named president and chief operating officer, with Barrett remaining CEO. Otellini had served in a variety of marketing and management positions since joining the company in 1974, most recently serving as head of Intel's core operating unit, the architecture group, which was responsible for developing microprocessors, chipsets, and motherboards for desktop and notebook computers and for servers.\n\nAs the technology downturn continued in 2002, Intel cut thousands of workers from its payroll to reduce costs. Behind the scenes, an important change occurred in the company's approach to designing chips. Since the 1980s Intel had maintained its leading position by creating ever-faster processors. But by the early 2000s speed was becoming less important to the majority of PC users, who were mainly employing their desktop PCs and laptops to surf the Internet and run basic programs, such as word processors. Intel decided to deemphasize speed in favor of designing chips to better fit the way people were actually using their computers and to do so using technology \"platforms,\" which were composed of several chips rather than a single microprocessor. The first fruit of this endeavor was Centrino, launched in early 2003. Centrino was a combination of chips specifically designed for portable computers. It included the Pentium M microprocessor, which while not sporting top speeds consumed much less power than the typical chip, providing for longer battery life (and reduced energy consumption when installed in desktop computers). The Pentium M was also smaller in size, making it less expensive to manufacture. Centrino also included a supporting chipset to further improve battery life and graphics performance as well as a wireless radio chip for connecting to the burgeoning number of wireless (Wi-Fi) networks being installed at corporate offices, in retail outlets, and within homes.\n\nBuoyed by the success of Centrino, Intel's revenues hit a new high in 2004, $34.21 billion, despite a number of manufacturing glitches, product delays, and schedule changes during the year. Intel abandoned its efforts to develop television display chips and also scrapped plans to introduce the first 4-gigahertz processor because of problems with overheating. The profits of $7.52 billion were an impressive 33 percent higher than the previous year but below the peak reached in 2000.\n\nIn May 2005 Otellini became only the fifth CEO in Intel history and the first non-engineer. At the same time, Barrett succeeded Grove as chairman. One of the key legacies of Barrett's tenure was surely the huge outlay of capital, as much as $32 billion over six years, expended to rebuild Intel's manufacturing base and enabling the firm to increase capacity to meet chip demand and add capabilities to the products. At the same time, Otellini was credited with leading the push toward platforms, and this approach was institutionalized in a 2005 reorganization that divided the company into five market-focused groups: corporate computing, the digital home, mobile computing, healthcare, and channels (PCs for small manufacturers). Otellini was also shifting the product development effort toward so-called dual-core technology featuring two computing engines on a single piece of silicon. In this realm, Intel was competing fiercely with, and playing catchup to, AMD, which released its first dual-core chips for PCs in 2005, whereas Intel was aiming to produce three lines of dual-core processors, for notebooks, desktops, and servers, during the second half of 2006. Like the Centrino technology, dual-core chips were being developed to extend battery life in laptops and cut power costs for desktop PCs and servers. They were also intended to improve performance while avoiding the problems with overheating that had plagued some of the fastest single-processor models. Intel was simultaneously beginning work on multicore platforms with three or more \"brains.\" Two other developments from mid-2005 held potential long-term significance. AMD filed a wide-ranging antitrust suit in U.S. federal court accusing Intel of using illegal inducements and coercion to discourage computer makers from buying AMD's computer chips. This action followed an antitrust ruling against Intel in Japan, earlier in the year. In the meantime, in what seemed a significant coup, Intel reached an agreement with Apple Computer, Inc. whereby Apple would begin shifting its Macintosh computers from IBM's PowerPC chips to Intel chips.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nComponents Intel de Costa Rica, S.A.; Intel Americas, Inc.; Intel Asia Finance Ltd.

Noyce is the co-inventor of the integrated circuit, and Moore made some of the basic discoveries that led to it. In 1968 the two men, feeling frustrated by Fairchild’s size, decided to leave to form their own company. They were joined soon after by Andrew Grove, who had been at Fairchild since 1963 and is president and CEO of Intel today.\n\nNoyce and Moore asked Arthur Rock, a venture capitalist who had helped start Fairchild Semiconductor as well as Teledyne and Scientific Data Systems, for help in raising the money to start their company. With a one-page business plan saying simply that they were going into large-scale integrated circuits, they soon had $3 million in capital. The company was incorporated on July 18, 1968 as N M Electronics (for Noyce Moore), but quickly changed its name to Intel, from the first syllables of “integrated electronics.” Intel gathered another $2 million in capital before going public in 1971.\n\nDespite their scanty business outline, Noyce and Moore had a clear plan for their company. They planned to produce large-scale integrated (LSI) semiconductor memories. At that time, semiconductor memories were ten times more expensive than standard magnetic core memories. But costs were dropping, and Intel’s founders felt that with the greater speed and efficiency of LSI technology, semiconductors would soon replace magnetic cores.\n\nWithin a few months of its startup, Intel was able to produce the 3101 Schottky bipolar memory, a high-speed random access memory (RAM). The 3101 proved popular enough to sustain the company until the 1101, a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) chip, was perfected and introduced in 1969.\n\nIntel’s next product was the 1103, introduced in 1970: a IK dynamic RAM, or DRAM, it was the first chip large enough to store a significant amount of information; today DRAMs are indispensable to every computer. With the 1103, Intel finally had a chip that really did begin to replace magnetic cores.\n\nBut the company’s most dramatic impact on the computer industry didn’t come until the introduction of the 4004, the world’s first microprocessor. Like many of Intel’s innovations, the microprocessor was the by-product of a search for something else. When a Japanese calculator manufacturer asked Intel to design the chips for a series of calculators, an engineer named Ted Hoff was assigned to the project. In his search for cost-effectiveness, he eventually conceived a plan for a central processing unit (CPU) on one chip. The 4004, which crammed 2,300 transistors onto a one-eighth- by one-sixth-inch chip, had the power of the old 3,000-cubic-foot ENIAC computer, which depended on 38,000 vacuum tubes. The microprocessor was born.\n\nAlthough at first Intel saw the new device as a way to sell more memory, it was soon clear that the microprocessor held great potential for everything from calculators to cash registers and traffic lights. With the 1972 introduction of the 8008, an 8-bit microprocessor developed along with the 4004 but oriented toward data and character (rather than arithmetic) manipulation, microprocessors were off and running. The 8080, introduced in 1974, was the first truly general-purpose microprocessor. For $360, Intel sold a whole computer, on one chip, when real computers cost thousands of dollars. The response was overwhelming. The 8080 soon became the industry standard and Intel the industry leader in the 8-bit market.\n\nCompetitors began to produce 8-bit microprocessors quickly, however. Intel responded with the 8085, a faster chip with more functions. Meanwhile, the company was working on two more advanced projects, the 32-bit 432 and the 16-bit 8086. The 8086 was introduced in 1978, but it took two years for it to catch on. In that time, Motorola produced a competing chip (the 68000) that seemed to catch on faster. Intel responded with a massive sales effort to establish its architecture as the standard. When, among other things, IBM chose the 8088, the 8086’s 8-bit cousin, for its personal computer in 1980, Intel’s battle over architecture was won.\n\nIn the meantime, in 1971 Intel had also developed the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), another revolutionary but unintended research by-product. An Intel physicist named Dov Frohman was working on the reliability problems of the silicon gate used in the MOS process when he realized that the disconnected, or “floating,” gates that were causing malfunctions could be used to create a chip that was erasable and reprogrammable.\n\nStandard ROM chips had to be permanently programmed during manufacture; to make a change you had to manufacture a whole new chip. With EPROM, Intel could offer customers chips which could be erased and reprogrammed with ultraviolet light and electricity. At its introduction in 1971, EPROM was a novelty without much of a market. But the microprocessor, invented at the same time, created a demand for memory; the EPROM offered memory that could be conveniently used to test microprocessors. It was a match made in heaven.\n\nAnother major development at Intel during the 1970s was peripheral controller chips. Streamlined for specific tasks and stripped of unneeded functions, peripheral chips could greatly increase a computer’s abilities without raising software-development costs. One of Intel’s most important developments in peripherals was the co-processor, first introduced in 1980. Co-processor chips are an extension of the CPU that can handle specific computer-intensive tasks more efficiently than the CPU itself. Once again, innovation kept Intel ahead of its competition.\n\nIntel’s rapid growth, from the 12 employees at its founding in 1968 to 15,000 in 1980, demanded a careful approach to corporate “culture.” Since Noyce, Moore, and Grove had left Fairchild because its size had created frustrating bureaucratic bottlenecks, defining a workable management style was important to Intel’s founders. Informal weekly lunches with employees kept communication lines open while the company was small, but the system didn’t last for long. Instead, a carefully outlined program emphasizing openness, decision making on the lowest levels, discipline, and problem solving rather than paper shuffling has preserved Intel’s remarkable ability to innovate. Intel makes no bones about the kind of employees it looks for. In an interview with the Harvard Business Review in 1980 Noyce said, “we expect people to work hard. We expect them to be here when they are committed to be here; we measure absolutely everything that we can in terms of performance.” Until recently employees who arrived after 8:10 a.m. signed a late list. But this strict attitude is balanced by company commitment. Incentives include options on Intel stock and breakthroughs are celebrated with custom-bottled champagne (”Vintage Intel” marked the first $250 million quarter, in 1983—the year sales reached $1 billion for the first time).\n\nDuring the 1974 recession, when Intel laid off 30% of its employees, the experience was traumatic enough that when 1981 rolled around, instead of laying off workers, Intel accelerated new product development with the “125% Solution” (asking exempt employees to work two extra hours a day, without pay, for six months), hoping to fight its way through the recession poised to tackle the next upturn. When a brief surge in sales in 1982 didn’t last, again, instead of firing, Intel imposed pay cuts of up to 10%. Such measures weren’t universally popular, but by June, 1983 all cuts had been restored and retroactive raises had been made. And in December, 1982 IBM paid $250 million for a 12% share of Intel, giving the company not only a strong capital boost, but also strong ties to the undisputed industry leader (IBM eventually increased its stake to 20% before selling its Intel stock in 1987).\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Intel began to slip in some of its markets. Fierce competition in DRAMS, static RAMS, and EPROMS left Intel concentrating on microprocessors. While competitors claimed that Intel simply gave away its DRAM market, Moore told Business Week in 1988 that his company chose microprocessors as the field with the most promise.\n\nThe company also struggled during the mid-1980s to overcome its reputation for arrogance in marketing. Customer service, an area Intel had been able to overlook for years as it dominated its markets, became more important as the highly-efficient Japanese and other increasingly innovative competitors challenged Intel’s position. In addition, Intel’s manufacturing record, strained in years past by undercapacity, needed fixing. Fab 7, Intel’s seventh wafer-fabrication plant, opened in 1983 only to face two years of troubled operations before reaching full capacity. Between 1984 and 1988, Intel closed eight old plants, and in 1988 it spent some $450 million on new technology to bring its manufacturing capacity into line with its developmental prowess.\n\nBut in the microprocessor market, Intel continued to excel. In 1982, Intel introduced its 80286 microprocessor, the chip that, when IBM came out with the 286-powered PC/AT, quickly came to dominate the upper-end PC market. The 286 was followed in 1985 by Intel’s 80386 chip, popularized in 1987 by the Compaq 386, which, despite bugs when it first came out, is one of the most popular chips on the market today. While the 286 brought to the PC a speed and power that gave larger computers their first real challenge, the 386 offered even greater speed and power together with the ability to run more than one program at a time. And in 1989 Intel introduced the 80486, a chip Business Week heralded as “a veritable mainframe-on-a-chip.”\n\nIn designing the i486, Intel resisted an industry trend toward RISC (reduced instruction-set computing), a way of designing chips that eliminates rarely used instructions to gain speed. Intel argued that what RISC chips gained in speed they lost in flexibility—and the ability to run the software already on the market, something Intel feels will secure the 486’s position despite whatever speed competitors can offer through non-compatible RISC chips. But a new chip, the 64-bit i860 announced in early 1989, does make use of RISC technology to offer what Intel has claimed will be a “supercomputer on a chip.”\n\nAlso in 1989 an important lawsuit Intel had filed against NEC in 1984 was decided. Intel had claimed that NEC violated its copyright on the microcode, or embedded software instructions, of Intel’s 8086 and 8088 chips, which Intel had licensed NEC to produce, when NEC designed a similar chip of its own. At issue was whether microcode could even be copyrighted. The court ruled that it could be—but that NEC had not violated any copyright in the case at hand.\n\nWhile Intel faces strong competition both from domestic chipmakers like the giant Motorola and the smaller Sun Microsystems and MIPS Computer Systems, its place at the edge of technology is undisputed. Meanwhile, it has also begun to branch out from chipmaking. The company has begun to build computers of its own, including a parallel processing one. It also has a growing systems business, providing customers with everything they need to build computer systems of their own.\n\nIndeed, it is not technology, but more mundane matters like manufacturing, marketing, and management that are likely to pose challenges for Intel in the 1990s. All three of the company’s founders will be looking toward retirement in the next few years, and how the company handles its first leadership transition may make as much difference to its future as the speed of its next chip.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries:\n\nIntel Electronics Ltd.

Intel has changed the world dramatically since it was founded in 1968; the company invented the microprocessor, the “computer on a chip” that made possible the first handheld calculators and personal computers. By the early 1990s, Intel’s product line included: microcontrollers, memory chips, computer modules, and boards for original equipment manufacturers; network, communications and personal conferencing products for retail sale; and high-performance parallel supercomputers. Intel remained competitive through a combination of clever marketing, well-supported research and development, a vital corporate culture, and legal proficiency. In 1993, the market research firm Dataquest estimated Intel’s chip sales at almost 30 percent higher than those of its closest competitor.\n\nIntel’s founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were among the eight founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, established in 1957. While at Fairchild, Noyce and Moore invented the integrated circuit, and, in 1968, they decided to form their own company. They were soon joined by Andrew Grove, a Hungarian refugee who had arrived in America in 1956 and joined Fairchild in 1963. Grove would remain president and CEO of Intel into the 1990s.\n\nTo obtain start-up capital, Noyce and Moore approached Arthur Rock, a venture capitalist, with a one-page business plan simply stating their intention of developing large-scale integrated circuits. Rock, who had helped start Fairchild Semiconductor, as well as Teledyne and Scientific Data Systems, had confidence in Noyce and Moore and provided $3 million in capital. The company was incorporated on July 18, 1968 as N M Electronics (the letters standing for Noyce Moore), but quickly changed its name to Intel, formed from the first syllables of “integrated electronics.” Intel gathered another $2 million in capital before going public in 1971.\n\nNoyce and Moore’s scanty business proposal belied a clear plan to produce large-scale integrated (LSI) semiconductor memories.

Noyce, Moore, and Grove, who remembered their frustration with Fairchild’s bureaucratic bottlenecks, found that defining a workable management style was important. Informal weekly lunches with employees kept communication lines open while the company was small, but that system had become unwieldy. Thus, the founders installed a carefully outlined program emphasizing openness, decision making on the lowest levels, discipline, and problem solving rather than paper shuffling. Moreover, the company’s top executives eschewed such luxuries as limousines, expense account lunches, and private parking spaces to establish a sense of teamwork with their subordinates.\n\nIn an interview with the Harvard Business Review in 1980, Noyce remarked on the company’s hiring policy, stating, “we expect people to work hard. We expect them to be here when they are committed to be here; we measure absolutely everything that we can in terms of performance.” Employee incentives included options on Intel stock, and technological breakthroughs were celebrated with custom-bottled champagne— “Vintage Intel” marked the first $250 million quarter, in 1983—the year sales reached $1 billion for the first time.\n\nDuring the 1974 recession, Intel was forced to lay off 30 percent of its employees, and morale declined substantially as a result. Thus, in 1981, when economic struggles again surfaced, instead of laying off more employees, Intel accelerated new product development with the “125 Percent Solution,” which asked exempt employees to work two extra hours per day, without pay, for six months. A brief surge in sales the following year didn’t last, and, again, instead of more lay offs, Intel imposed pay cuts of up to ten percent. Such measures weren’t popular among all its work force, but, by June 1983, all cuts had been restored and retroactive raises had been made. Moreover, in December 1982, IBM paid $250 million for a 12 percent share of Intel, giving the company not only a strong capital boost, but also strong ties to the undisputed industry leader. IBM would eventually increased its stake to 20 percent before selling its Intel stock in 1987.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Intel began to slip in some of its markets. Fierce competition in DRAMS, static RAMS, and EPROMS left Intel concentrating on microprocessors. While competitors claimed that Intel simply gave away its DRAM market, Moore told Business Week in 1988 that the company deliberately focused on microprocessors as the least cyclical field in which to operate. Customer service, an area Intel had been able to overlook for years as it dominated its markets, became more important as highly-efficient Japanese and other increasingly innovative competitors challenged Intel’s position. In addition, Intel’s manufacturing record, strained in years past by undercapacity, needed fixing. Fab 7, Intel’s seventh wafer-fabrication plant, opened in 1983 only to face two years of troubled operations before reaching full capacity. Between 1984 and 1988, Intel closed eight old plants, and in 1988 it spent some $450 million on new technology to bring its manufacturing capacity into line with its developmental prowess.\n\nDespite these retrenchments, the company continued to excel in the microprocessor market. In 1982, Intel introduced its 80286 microprocessor, the chip that quickly came to dominate the upper-end PC market, when IBM came out with the 286-pow-ered PC/AT. The 286 was followed in 1985 by Intel’s 80386 chip, popularized in 1987 by the Compaq 386, which, despite bugs when it first came out, became one of the most popular chips on the market.

Intel argued that what RISC chips gained in speed they lost in flexibility and that, moreover, RISC chips were not compatible with software already on the market, which Intel felt would secure the 486’s position. However, a new chip, the 64-bit i860 announced in early 1989, did make use of RISC technology to offer what Intel claimed would be a “supercomputer on a chip.”\n\nAlso in 1989, an important lawsuit that Intel had filed against NEC Corporation five years before was decided. Intel had claimed that NEC violated its copyright on the microcode, or embedded software instructions, of Intel’s 8086 and 8088 chips. Although Intel had licensed NEC to produce the microcode, NEC had subsequently designed a similar chip of its own. At issue was whether microcode could be copyrighted. The court ruled that it could but that NEC had not violated any copyright in the case at hand. The suit made public some issues surrounding Intel’s reputation. Some rivals and consumers, for example, claimed that Intel used its size and power to repress competition through such tactics as filing “meritless” lawsuits and tying microprocessor sales to other chips. Other observers, however, praised Intel’s protection of its intellectual property and, subsequently, its profits. The Federal Trade Commission conducted a two-year investigation of Intel’s practices and did not recommend criminal charges against the company, but two rival companies—Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp.—filed antitrust lawsuits against Intel in 1993.\n\nIntel’s annual net income topped $1 billion for the first time in 1992, following a very successful, brand-building, marketing campaign. Intel ads aggressively sought to bolster consumer interest in and demand for computers that featured “Intel Inside.” By late 1993, the company’s brand equity totaled $17.8 billion—more than three times its 1992 sales. Also during this time, Intel began to branch out from chipmaking. In 1992, the company’s Intel Products Group introduced network, communications, and personal conferencing products for retail sale directly to PC users.\n\nIn 1993, Intel released its fifth-generation Pentium processor, a trademarked chip capable of executing over 100 million instructions per second and supporting, for example, real-time video communication. The Pentium processor was up to five times more powerful than the 33-megahertz Intel 486 DX microprocessor, but, in an unusual marketing maneuver, the company suggested that “all but the most demanding users” seek out PCs powered by the previous chip.\n\nThe company enjoyed a dramatic 50 percent revenue increase in 1993, reaching $8.78 billion from $5.84 billion in 1992. Moreover, Intel’s net income leaped 115 percent to $2.3 billion, repudiating Wall Street’s worries that competition had squeezed profit margins. While Intel faced strong competition both from chip makers like giant Motorola’s PowerPC and former partner IBM, its place at the leading edge of technology was undisputed and expected to continue. As it entered the mid-1990s, Intel looked to address potential challenges in the form of leadership transitions, as founders Moore and Grove neared retirement.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries:\n\nIntel Japan K.K.; Intel Corporation S.A.R.L.

Intel has changed the world dramatically since it was founded in 1968; the company invented the microprocessor, the “computer on a chip” that made possible the first handheld calculators and personal computers (PCs). By the early 21st century, Intel’s microprocessors were found in more than 80 percent of PCs worldwide. The company’s product line also includes chipsets and motherboards; flash memory used in wireless communications and other applications; hubs, switches, routers, and other products for Ethernet networks; and embedded control chips used in networking products, laser printers, imaging devices, storage media, and other applications. Intel remained competitive through a combination of clever marketing, well-supported research and development, superior manufacturing proficiency, a vital corporate culture, legal proficiency, and an ongoing alliance with software giant Microsoft Corporation often referred to as “Wintel.”\n\n1968–79: From DRAM to the 8086\n\nIntel’s founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were among the eight founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, established in 1957. While at Fairchild, Noyce and Moore invented the integrated circuit, and, in 1968, they decided to form their own company. They were soon joined by Andrew Grove, a Hungarian refugee who had arrived in the United States in 1956 and joined Fairchild in 1963. Grove would remain president and CEO of Intel into the 1990s.\n\nTo obtain start-up capital, Noyce and Moore approached Arthur Rock, a venture capitalist, with a one-page business plan simply stating their intention of developing large-scale integrated circuits. Rock, who had helped start Fairchild Semiconductor, as well as Teledyne and Scientific Data Systems, had confidence in Noyce and Moore and provided $3 million in capital. The company was incorporated on July 18, 1968, as N M Electronics (the letters standing for Noyce Moore), but quickly changed its name to Intel, formed from the first syllables of “integrated electronics.” Intel gathered another $2 million in capital before going public in 1971.\n\nNoyce and Moore’s scanty business proposal belied a clear plan to produce large-scale integrated (LSI) semiconductor memories. At that time, semiconductor memories were ten times more expensive than standard magnetic core memories. Costs were falling, however, and Intel’s founders felt that with the greater speed and efficiency of LSI technology, semiconductors would soon replace magnetic cores. Within a few months of its startup, Intel produced the 3101 Schottky bipolar memory, a high-speed random access memory (RAM) chip The 3101 proved popular enough to sustain the company until the 1101, a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) chip, was perfected and introduced in 1969. The following year, Intel introduced the 1103, a one Kilobyte (K) dynamic RAM, or DRAM, which was the first chip large enough to store a significant amount of information. With the 1103, Intel finally had a chip that really did begin to replace magnetic cores; DRAMs eventually proved indispensable to the personal computer.\n\nThe company’s most dramatic impact on the computer industry involved its 1971 introduction of the 4004, the world’s first microprocessor. Like many of Intel’s innovations, the microprocessor was a byproduct of efforts to develop another technology. When a Japanese calculator manufacturer, Busicom, asked Intel to design cost-effective chips for a series of calculators, Intel engineer Ted Hoff was assigned to the project; during his search for such a design, Hoff conceived a plan for a central processing unit (CPU) on one chip. The 4004, which crammed 2,300 transistors onto a one-eighth- by one-sixth-inch chip, had the power of the old 3,000-cubic-foot ENIAC computer, which depended on 38,000 vacuum tubes.\n\nAlthough Intel initially focused on the microprocessor as a computer enhancement that would allow users to add more memory to their units, the microprocessor’s great potential—for everything from calculators to cash registers and traffic lights—soon became clear. The applications were facilitated by Intel’s introduction of the 8008, an 8-bit microprocessor developed along with the 4004 but oriented toward data and character (rather than arithmetic) manipulation. The 8080, introduced in 1974, was the first truly general purpose microprocessor. For $360, Intel sold a whole computer on one chip, while conventional computers sold for thousands of dollars. The response was overwhelming. The 8080 soon became the industry standard and Intel the industry leader in the 8-bit market.\n\nIn response to ensuing competition in the manufacture of 8-bit microprocessors, Intel introduced the 8085, a faster chip with more functions. The company was also developing two more advanced projects, the 32-bit 432 and the 16-bit 8086. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 but took two years to achieve wide use, and, during this time, Motorola produced a competing chip (the 68000) that seemed to be selling faster. Intel responded with a massive sales effort to establish its architecture as the standard. When International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) chose the 8008, the 8086’s 8-bit cousin, for its personal computer in 1980, Intel seemed to have beat out the competition.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Intel had also developed the erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), another revolutionary but unintended research byproduct. Intel physicist Dov Frohman was working on the reliability problems of the silicon gate used in the MOS process when he realized that the disconnected, or “floating,” gates that were causing malfunctions could be used to create a chip that was erasable and reprogrammable. Since conventional ROM chips had to be permanently programmed during manufacture, any change required the manufacture of a whole new chip. With EPROM, however, Intel could offer customers chips that could be erased and reprogrammed with ultraviolet light and electricity. At its introduction in 1971, EPROM was a novelty without much of a market. But the microprocessor, invented at the same time, created a demand for memory; the EPROM offered memory that could be conveniently used to test microprocessors.\n\nAnother major development at Intel during this time was that of peripheral controller chips. Streamlined for specific tasks and stripped of unneeded functions, peripheral chips could greatly increase a computer’s abilities without raising software development costs. One of Intel’s most important developments in peripherals was the coprocessor, first introduced in 1980. Coprocessor chips were an extension of the CPU that could handle specific computer-intensive tasks more efficiently than the CPU itself. Once again, innovation kept Intel ahead of its competition.\n\nIntel’s rapid growth, from the 12 employees at its founding in 1968 to 15,000 in 1980, demanded a careful approach to corporate culture. Noyce, Moore, and Grove, who remembered their frustration with Fairchild’s bureaucratic bottlenecks, found that defining a workable management style was important. Informal weekly lunches with employees kept communication lines open while the company was small, but that system had become unwieldy. Thus, the founders installed a carefully outlined program emphasizing openness, decision making on the lowest levels, discipline, and problem solving rather than paper shuffling. Moreover, the company’s top executives eschewed such luxuries as limousines, expense account lunches, and private parking spaces to establish a sense of teamwork with their subordinates.\n\nIn an interview with the Harvard Business Review in 1980, Noyce remarked on the company’s hiring policy, stating, “we expect people to work hard. We expect them to be here when they are committed to be here; we measure absolutely everything that we can in terms of performance.” Employee incentives included options on Intel stock, and technological breakthroughs were celebrated with custom-bottled champagne—“Vintage Intel” marked the first $250 million quarter, in 1983—the year sales reached $1 billion for the first time.\n\n1980s: From 286 to 486\n\nDuring the 1974 recession, Intel was forced to lay off 30 percent of its employees, and morale declined substantially as a result. Thus, in 1981, when economic struggles again surfaced, instead of laying off more employees, Intel accelerated new product development with the “125 Percent Solution,” which asked exempt employees to work two extra hours per day, without pay, for six months. A brief surge in sales the following year did not last, and, again, instead of more layoffs, Intel imposed pay cuts of up to ten percent. Such measures were not popular among all its workforce, but, by June 1983, all cuts had been restored and retroactive raises had been made. Moreover, in December 1982, IBM paid $250 million for a 12 percent share of Intel, giving the company not only a strong capital boost, but also strong ties to the undisputed industry leader. IBM would eventually increase its stake to 20 percent before selling its Intel stock in 1987.\n\nCompany Perspectives\n\nThe Internet revolution requires a wholesale reengineering of the infrastructure for commerce and communications. In five to eight years, we believe the world will be linked by one billion connected computers, through tens of millions of servers, generating trillions of dollars of e-commerce. As we shift our focus from a PC-dominated industry to an Internet-dominated economy, we are positioning ourselves to provide key technologies to help drive this transformation.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Intel began to slip in some of its markets. Fierce competition in DRAMs, static RAMs, and EPROMs left Intel concentrating on microprocessors. While competitors claimed that Intel simply gave away its DRAM market, Moore told Business Week in 1988 that the company deliberately focused on microprocessors as the least cyclical field in which to operate. Customer service, an area Intel had been able to overlook for years as it dominated its markets, became more important as highly efficient Japanese and other increasingly innovative competitors challenged Intel’s position. In addition, Intel’s manufacturing record, strained in years past by undercapacity, needed fixing. Fab 7, Intel’s seventh wafer-fabrication plant, opened in 1983 only to face two years of troubled operations before reaching full capacity. Between 1984 and 1988, Intel closed eight old plants, and in 1988 it spent some $450 million on new technology to bring its manufacturing capacity into line with its developmental prowess.\n\nDespite these retrenchments, the company continued to excel in the microprocessor market. In 1982 Intel introduced its 80286 microprocessor, the chip that quickly came to dominate the upper-end PC market, when IBM came out with the 286-powered PC/AT. The 286 was followed in 1985 by Intel’s 80386 chip, popularized in 1987 by the Compaq DESKPRO 386, which, despite bugs when it first came out, became one of the most popular chips on the market. While the 286 brought to the personal computer a speed and power that gave larger computers their first real challenge, the 386 offered even greater speed and power together with the ability to run more than one program at a time. The 386 featured 32-bit architecture and 275,000 transistors—more than twice the number of the 286.\n\nIn 1989 Intel introduced the 80486, a chip Business Week heralded as “a veritable mainframe-on-a-chip.” The 486 included 1.2 million transistors and the first built-in math coprocessor, and was 50 times faster than the 4004, the first microprocessor. In designing the i486, Intel resisted an industry trend toward RISC (reduced instruction-set computing), a chip design that eliminated rarely used instructions in order to gain speed. Intel argued that what RISC chips gained in speed they lost in flexibility and that, moreover, RISC chips were not compatible with software already on the market, which Intel felt would secure the 486’s position. A new chip, the 64-bit i860 announced in early 1989, however, did make use of RISC technology to offer what Intel claimed would be a “supercomputer on a chip.”\n\nAlso in 1989, a major lawsuit that Intel had filed against NEC Corporation five years before was decided. Intel had claimed that NEC violated its copyright on the microcode, or embedded software instructions, of Intel’s 8086 and 8088 chips. Although Intel had licensed NEC to produce the microcode, NEC had subsequently designed a similar chip of its own. At issue was whether microcode could be copyrighted. The court ruled that it could but that NEC had not violated any copyright in the case at hand. The suit made public some issues surrounding Intel’s reputation. Some rivals and consumers, for example, claimed that Intel used its size and power to repress competition through such tactics as filing “meritless” lawsuits and tying microprocessor sales to other chips. Other observers, however, praised Intel’s protection of its intellectual property and, subsequently, its profits. The Federal Trade Commission conducted a two-year investigation of Intel’s practices and did not recom-mend criminal charges against the company, but two rival companies—Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp.—filed antitrust lawsuits against Intel in 1993.\n\n1990s: The Pentium Decade\n\nIntel’s annual net income topped $1 billion for the first time in 1992, following a very successful, brand-building marketing campaign. Intel ads aggressively sought to bolster consumer interest in and demand for computers that featured “Intel In-side.” By late 1993, the company’s brand equity totaled $17.8 billion—more than three times its 1992 sales. Also during this time, Intel began to branch out from chipmaking. In 1992, the company’s Intel Products Group introduced network, communications, and personal conferencing products for retail sale directly to PC users.\n\nIn 1993 Intel released its fifth-generation Pentium processor, a trademarked chip capable of executing over 100 million instructions per second (MIPS) and supporting, for example, real-time video communication. The Pentium processor, with its 3.1 million transistors, was up to five times more powerful than the 33-megahertz Intel 486 DX microprocessor (and 1,500 times the speed of the 4004), but, in an unusual marketing maneuver, the company suggested that “all but the most demanding users” would seek out PCs powered by the previous chip. The Pentium’s reputation was initially sullied by the revelation of an embedded mathematical flaw, but Intel moved quickly to fix the problem.\n\nKey Dates\n\n1968:\n\nRobert Noyce and Gordon Moore incorporate N M Electronics, which is soon renamed Intel Corporation.\n\n1970:\n\nCompany develops DRAM, dynamic RAM.\n\n1971:\n\nIntel introduces the world’s first microprocessor and goes public.\n\n1974:\n\nCompany introduces the first general purpose microprocessor.\n\n1980:\n\nIBM chooses the Intel microprocessor for the first personal computer.\n\n1983:\n\nRevenues exceed $1 billion for the first time.\n\n1992:\n\nNet income tops $1 billion for the first time.\n\n1993:\n\nThe fifth generation chip, the Pentium, debuts.\n\n1996:\n\nRevenues surpass $20 billion, net income exceeds $5 billion.\n\n1997:\n\nCompany introduces the Pentium II microprocessor.\n\n1999:\n\nIntel debuts the Pentium III and is added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n2000:\n\nThe first Intel 1-gigahertz processor hits the market.\n\nThe company enjoyed a dramatic 50 percent revenue in-crease in 1993, reaching $8.78 billion from $5.84 billion in 1992. Moreover, Intel’s net income leapt 115 percent to $2.3 billion, repudiating Wall Street’s worries that competition had squeezed profit margins. While Intel faced strong competition both from chip makers such as giant Motorola, Inc.’s PowerPC and former partner IBM, its place at the leading edge of technology was undisputed.\n\nA key initiative that kept Intel ahead of its competitors was the company’s move beyond chip design into computer design. With the advent of the Pentium, Intel began designing chipsets and motherboards—the latter being the PC circuit board that combined a microprocessor and a chipset into the basic subsystem of a PC. With the company now selling the guts of a PC, dozens of computer manufacturers began making and selling Pentium-based machines.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, as sales of PCs accelerated and multimedia and the Internet were beginning to emerge, Intel continued developing ever more powerful microprocessors. In 1995 the Pentium Pro hit the market sporting 5.5 million transistors and capable of performing up to 300 MIPS. Intel next added MMX technology to its existing line of Pentium processors. MMX consisted of a new set of instructions that was designed specifically to improve the multimedia performance of personal computers. Fueled by exploding demand, revenues hit $20.85 bil-lion by 1996, while net income soared to $5.16 billion.\n\nAt this point Intel was continuing its longtime strategy of designing new, more powerful chips for the top end of the market while allowing previous-generation microprocessors to migrate down to the lower segments of the market. With the introduction of the Pentium II in May 1997, however, the company adopted a new strategy of developing a range of microprocessors for every segment of the computing market. The Pentium II, with 7.5 transistors, debuted with a top-end model that clocked at 300 MHZ. Originally designed for highend desktop PCs, the Pentium II was soon adapted for use in notebook and laptop computers. With the following year came the launch of the Celeron processor, which was designed specifically for the value PC desktop sector, a rapidly growing segment of the market ever since the early 1997 debut of a sub$1,000 PC from Compaq. Also in 1998 Intel for the first time designed a microprocessor—the Pentium II Xeon—especially for midrange and higher-end servers and workstations. At the same time Intel was moving into another burgeoning sector, that of embedded control chips for networking and other applications, such as digital set-top boxes.\n\nMeanwhile Intel settled a dispute with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) over the development of the Pentium chip by acquiring DEC’s semiconductor operations. In May 1997 Craig R. Barrett was named president of Intel, having joined the company in 1974, serving as head of manufacturing starting in 1985, and being named chief operating officer in 1993. Grove remained chairman and CEO for one year, whereupon Barrett was named president and CEO, with Grove retaining the chairmanship. In early 1999 Intel reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission on an antitrust suit, thereby avoiding the protracted litigation and negative publicity that beset its Wintel partner, Microsoft, in the late 1990s. Reflecting the increasing importance of technology to the U.S. economy, Intel was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November 1999.\n\nDuring the late 1990s Intel made several strategic acquisitions that rapidly gave the company a significant presence in areas outside its microprocessor core: wireless communications products, such as flash memory for mobile phones and two-way pagers; networking building blocks, such as hubs, switches, and routers; and embedded control chips for laser printers, storage media, and automotive systems. Intel also entered the market for e-commerce services, rapidly building up the largest business-to-business e-commerce site in the world, with $1 billion per month in online sales by mid-1999. The company was not neglecting its core, however; in 1999 Intel had its largest micro-processor launch ever with the simultaneous introduction of 15 Pentium III and Pentium III Xeon processors. In early 2000 a one-gigahertz Pentium III chip hit the market. Later in 2000 came the debut of the next generation processor for the early 21st century, the Itanium, the company’s first 64-bit processor, which was initially designed to meet the needs of powerful Internet servers. With its continuing development of ever more powerful processors and its aggressive expansion into other key technology areas, Intel appeared certain to remain one of the linchpins of the information economy in the new millennium.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nComponentes Intel de Costa Rica, S.A.; DSP Communications, Inc.; Dialogic Corporation; Intel Commodities Limited (Cayman); Intel Corporation (UK) Limited; Intel Electronics Limited (Israel); Intel International BV (Netherlands); Intel Ireland Limited (Cayman); Intel Kabushiki Kaisha (Japan); Intel Massachusetts, Inc.; Intel Overseas Corporation; Intel Products (M) Sdn.

Chip maker Intel Corporation, based in Santa Clara, California, produced a major share of the microprocessors powering those PCs, leading the way in both consumer recognition and sales and claiming a 90 percent market segment share by the late 1990s. By 1990 Intel had begun to focus its marketing on shaping the corporate brand with newly hired agency EURO RSCG DSW Partners, Salt Lake City. The agency set out to create a brand image for Intel's chips as \"The computer inside,\" a concept that, in a 1991 campaign, hit the bull's-eye. \"Intel inside\" became more than a campaign tag line; it was an industry icon.\n\nThroughout the 1990s the PC industry faced an ever-increasing demand from consumers for faster, high-performance microprocessors for their personal computers. In 1997 Intel responded by introducing its most enhanced technology in 10 years, MMX and the Pentium II processor. Acknowledging the increasing trend to use PCs for entertainment as well work, Ann Lewnes, Intel's director of worldwide advertising, stated, \"[The company's objective] is to create awareness and excitement among consumers. We wanted to position the product as fun, particularly for multimedia applications.\"\n\nIntel was the only tech company to purchase ads for the 1997 Super Bowl's coveted commercial slots. During Intel's 30 seconds, \"Bunny People\" did the disco. These Bunny People were modeled after chip technicians who work in the hyperclean manufacturing rooms of fabrication plants. Their spacesuit like \"cleansuits,\" or \"bunny suits,\" are worn to prevent even the tiniest of particles from contaminating the processors. In the spot a group of Bunny People danced about in brightly colored lam, bunny suits. Said Lewnes, \"These commercials are humorous, high-tech fantasies that show how fun computing can be with MMX technology.\" Another spot in the campaign featured Seinfeld star Jason Alexander as a hapless character hoping to impress potential blind dates via Intel's video phone. These spots, together with related print ads, radio spots, and promotions, spurred both consumer approval and rival spoofing and was the most comprehensive campaign ever undertaken by Intel.\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nBy the 1980s computers had begun to move from a largely scientific and industrial market into the personal user market. Intel's 1989 ad campaign with Shafer & Shafer, an Irvine, California, tech agency, prompted consumers to upgrade their systems with the latest technologies. Intel had just released its 386 chip, an upgrade of\n\n[Image not available for copyright reasons]\n\nits 286 chip. When computer makers and buyers did not rush to upgrade, a striking \"Red X\" campaign was designed. Print ads and billboards featured graffiti-esque red spray paint x-ing out \"286\" and scrawling in \"386SX\" in an effort to move consumers along the upgrade food chain. In 1990 Intel signed on EURO RSCG DSW Partners. That year's campaign, \"The Computer Inside,\" focused on building the corporate brand. In 1991 the company launched \"Intel Inside.\" The success of the \"Intel Inside\" campaign was due in part to brilliant co-op marketing—that is, paying PC makers to feature the logo in ads. Through a combined marketing effort between Intel and computer makers, the \"Intel Inside\" logo on PCs became a seal of approval in the minds of consumers.\n\nBetween the years 1989 and 1996 Intel's revenues soared from $3.1 billion to $20.8 billion, net income rose from $391 million to $5.2 billion, and market segment share grew from under 60 percent to 80 percent. The \"Intel Inside\" campaign had solidified Intel's image of superior performance, outweighing the fact that the company's microprocessors cost considerably more than those available from its competitors. Intel became a cash cow, with sales increasing a whopping 30 to 50 percent every year between 1994 and 1997.\n\nAs Intel's enviable success was turning heads and profits, their competitors were carving a different niche. Prior to 1997 the average PC price was $2,000. In that year Compaq Computer Corporation set an industry precedent by offering a high-powered PC at a bargain-basement price of $999, powered by rival Cyrix Corporation's MediaGX chip. The sub-$1,000 PC market proved irrepressible. Within a year nearly all major PC makers were offering the new price point, resulting in a segment sales increase from 7 percent of the U.S. retail market in 1996 to approximately 25 percent in 1997. Intel's president and CEO Dr. Andrew S. Grove explained the company's response to this competition to Business Week: \"For us to walk away from a market whose size is going to be measured in tens of millions of units per year, maybe bigger, is inconceivable…. It is very important for us to participate at both ends of the wire.\" The company planned to make up for meager profits on the low end with increased volume and on the high-end with sales directed at server and workstation markets.\n\nTARGET MARKET\n\nThe success of Intel's brand identification could largely be summed up in two words: \"Intel Inside.\" The tag line had proven enormously successful in whispering \"performance inside\" into the ears of PCs buyers. Consumers wanted an assurance that their PC could go the distance double-time as they cruised the Internet, developed intricate audio and animation programs, and played power-hungry computer games.\n\n[Image not available for copyright reasons]\n\nThe age market for such a product was widespread—PC users from their late teens to late 40s. To reach such a diffuse target, the \"Blind Date\" and \"Bunny People\" spots were aired on such programs as ER, Seinfeld, and Veronica's Closet, with cable TV spots purchased on The History Channel, CNN, and A&E. The women's market was targeted with print ads placed in Self, Vanity Fair, Gourmet, and, for the first time, Martha Stewart Living.\n\nThe \"Bunny People\" spots proved the most popular aspect of the campaign. The mood set by Wild Cherry's boogie-down tune, \"Play That Funky Music,\" hit home with those at both ends of the Baby Boomer generation. Boomers who had come of age during the 1970s identified with the disco reference from firsthand experience. The theme spoke to younger Boomers as well because the campaign was launched during a late 1990s nostalgia for anything from the 1970s. The hints of '70s nostalgia in the disco-themed ads proved a winner with the youngest target market segment as well. Intel's campaign had successfully caught the ears of all ages within its intended market.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nBy the 1997 release of MMX technology, Intel had a decided claim on the title of world's top selling chip maker. Primary competition came from Cyrix Corporation's MediaGX processor and Advanced Micro Devices's (AMDs) K6chip. Intel had already earned a distinguished reputation for performance, if not low-end pricing. Rivals Cyrix and AMD set out to develop a reputation for high quality at a more competitive price than Intel's. Cyrix's 1997 marketing goals were strikingly similar to Intel's, with one exception. \"People want to be entertained in their living room—they don't want just a productivity tool. Through our innovative processor and system technology, we've made possible an easy-to-use home infotainment system with PC capability that people can actually afford,\" stated Cyrix's vice president of corporate marketing, Steve Tobak, on the company's website. Intel's rivals had an edge in competing in the sub-$1,000 PC market, because their processors continued to be available at prices well below the Pentium's. Consumers had been offered a sub-$1,000 PC that could perform, and they scooped them up. Market segment share for the price point jumped from 10 percent in 1996 to upwards of 20 percent the following year. \"It's the first time in many years that there has been a viable alternative [to Intel] at the low end,\" IBM senior vice president Samuel J. Palmisano told Business Week. His company tapped AMD's K6 chip for their low-end line of PCs. Intel's monopoly on high performance chips that could run desirable software had been challenged, and at a considerably lower cost to PC makers.\n\nAMD's fall 1997 campaign, developed by Hill, Holliday Advertising, sent out just this message. One spot featured a secret agent held captive by an evil mastermind whose plot to rule the world is foiled when the processor in his expensive PC cannot deliver. Thanks to the AMD processor in his PC, the secret agent handily escapes. On AMD's website, Tom Stites, vice president of communications, said, \"These television spots target personal computer consumers. Our intent is to show that buying PCs based on the AMD K6 processor is a smart choice. The message is that no matter how much or how little consumers are prepared to spend for a similarly configured system, they will get better performance with the AMD K6. Our message of performance and value is compelling, but our primary competitor outspends us on advertising by almost twenty to one. In order to be heard above the noise, commercials from AMD must break through with humor and excitement.\"\n\nApple Computer, Inc., could not have agreed more. In 1997 Apple joined forces with TBWA Chiat/Day for the first time in over a decade. This team was responsible for having produced Apple's legendary \"1984\" campaign, voted the best ad of all time by advertising professionals. In early 1998 the team followed their cerebral 1997 \"Think Different\" campaign with the \"Toasted Bunny\" spot, a direct spoof on Intel's disco dancing \"Bunny People.\" Apple had already made fun of Intel's vaunted processor speed in a spot of a garden snail crawling along with a Pentium II chip on its back. Their \"Toasted Bunny\" spot featured a guy in a shimmering blue cleansuit, accompanied by the 1970s classic \"Disco Inferno.\" As the foil-clad techie dances to the beat, his feet burst into flames, and he has to be doused by a fireman. Apple's website deepened the tease with, \"Ah, there's nothing sweeter than the smell of toasted chips in the morning.\"\n\nMARKETING STRATEGY\n\nIntel's decision to take a more humorous marketing tack came about as chip suppliers were discovering that consumers were not responding well to ads dwelling on the technical intricacies of PCs. On television two \"Blind Date\" spots, starring Jason Alexander, were the first ads to lighten up. Director Jim Gartner, who had brought to life Pepsi's \"Dad's Blessing,\" HBO's \"Falling TV\" and Visa's \"Burro,\" teamed up with EURO RSCG DSW Partners in creating the spots, a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Intel's video phone capabilities.\n\nIn the second round of spots, the Bunny People characters were introduced in a send-up of the boring geek stereotype. The first spot, debuting during the 1997 Super Bowl, contrasted a traditional fabrication-plant setting with a more free-spirited MMX technology department. Within this more fun-loving environment, the Bunny People danced the workday away, suggesting the PC user could experience new heights of fun with the aid of MMX technology. The Bunny People showed up on television spots throughout the year, and during the fall an international flavor was added by having the Bunny People travel the globe in a \"TechMobile,\" created by Batmobile designers Trans FX of Los Angeles. In the \"Road Trip\" spot the Bunny People became so excited about Pentium II technology, they were inspired to build the TechMobile to help them spread the word around the world. In a second spot the TechMobile delivered the beloved Bunny People to Hong Kong, where they were hailed by crowds in awe of the marvels of Pentium II.\n\nThe television and print campaigns were complemented by radio commercials and an interactive sweepstakes. On the websites of MTV, Interzine, Gamespot, MPlayer, Hotwired, and Hollywood Online, users were supplied with clues for the official sweepstakes found on Intel's website.\n\nIntel continued its proven track record of co-op marketing in 1997. The home PC buyer's awareness of the Intel microprocessor increased from 20 percent at 1992's campaign launch date to 80 percent in 1996, according to Dennis Carter, vice president of sales and marketing for the company. Even more impressive was the 90 percent recognition in the business market. Carter told Advertising Age magazine that 70 percent of home PC buyers and 85 percent of business buyers preferred Intel and were willing to pay the higher price the \"Intel Inside\" logo commanded.\n\nPLAYING IS THE THING\n\nIntel's \"Bunny People\" campaign succeeded in transforming supposedly geeky MMX chip technicians into fun-loving, dance-at-the-drop-of-a-keystroke guys. The ads were popular in consumer surveys, and thanks to Intel merchandising, anyone enamored with the brightly suited techies could take home an eight-inch beanbag doll version of their very own. Bunny People character dolls, available in an assortment of cleansuit colors, were among a treasure trove of merchandise developed around MMX technology. Consumers could pick up a Bunny People doll at their favorite computer outlet or log on to Uniquely Intel, the company's Internet merchandise catalog (http://www.intel.com), to scoop up Bunny People embellished beach towels, bags, tumblers, watches, and apparel.\n\nSince the inception of \"Intel Inside,\" consumers had shown a strong allegiance to the company's co-op efforts. According to a September 15, 1997, issue of Advertising Age, Intel had an estimated advertising budget of $900 million in 1997, $750 million of which went into co-op ads. As of 1997, approximately 1,500 PC makers were participating with Intel in co-op marketing, wherein they received a 6 percent rebate on chip purchases by tacking the Pentium logo on their PCs and ads. PC makers would come up with one-third of the cost of print ads and one-half that of broadcast costs. For the first half of the year, nearly 80 percent of the $202.9 million spent on U.S. PC advertising in computer and business publications featured the \"Intel Inside\" logo according to Sheila Crave"
