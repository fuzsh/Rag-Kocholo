To solve these problems, significant social and economic transformations are being demanded in every society and economy, and the advancement of digital transformation utilizing ICT (Information and Communications Technology) is required in every situation.\n\nWhat can be accomplished\n\nAs a leader in digital transformation, we will act and contribute to helping resolve the social challenges unique to each country. For example, the declining birthrate and aging population, proper education, equitable healthcare, regional economic development, and long-term value through technology for the next generations.\n\nFuture vision\n\nThe NTT Group is committed to contributing to the development of society by acknowledging diverse cultures, and thus we will contribute to solving social issues by connecting people, goods, and cultures, including communities, nations, and society, while promoting high ethical standards, diversity, and inclusion in fair and equitable ways, and work towards creating a better workplace through powerful and new digital technologies.\n\nBusiness Activity 16\n\nPromoting the B2B2X Model\n\nOur commitment\n\nAs a leader in digital transformation, we will act and contribute to helping resolve the social challenges unique to each country For example, the declining birthrate and aging population, proper education, equitable healthcare, regional economic development, and long-term value through technology for the next generations\n\nOur objective\n\nB2B2X Earnings\n\nFY2023: 870 billion yen\n\nPolicies and Concepts\n\nIn recent years, various social issues have come to the fore: rapid increase in the global population, growing severity of natural disasters, worsening of food supply and environmental problems, and in Japan, low birthrates and an aging population are leading to a rapid shrinking of the working-age population and shortage of labor. To solve these problems, significant social and economic transformations are being demanded in every society and economy, and the advancement of digital transformation utilizing ICT (Information and Communications Technology) is required in every situation.\n\nCollaborating with companies in different industries and local governments as Your Value Partner, the NTT Group has been applying its management resources and capabilities, including human resources, research and development, and the ICT base to promote digital transformation and resolve social issues.\n\nAdditionally, we held an internal conference intended to deploy practices across the Group on February 22, 2023, and continue to promote the B2B2X initiative in the entire NTT Group.\n\nOrganization for Implementation\n\nIn addition to citing the promotion of the B2B2X model as one of the pillars of its medium-term management plan, the NTT Group has established and is operating a Marketing Strategy Committee chaired by the President to expand the project while facilitating Group cooperation.\n\nWe are also deepening discussion about future deployment of the B2B2X business model at regularly held Board of Directors meetings and reporting on progress at general meetings of shareholders.\n\nWhat is the B2B2X model?\n\nB2B2X is a business model aimed at resolving social issues by creating new value through collaboration with various partners.\n\nThis business model aims to provide our partner's customers (users) with new value by combining the industry expertise and customer platforms of our partners with the NTT Group's \"data services\" and \"data management technology.\"\n\nDevelopment of B2B2X business\n\nThe model is being developed as an All NTT Group initiative in areas like (1) Advancing industry value chains (2) Providing better customer service (3) Utilization of mobile data (4) Community-based service and urban development.\n\nBusiness Activity 17\n\nProtection and respect for intellectual property\n\nOur commitment\n\nIn addition to devising intellectual property (IP) strategies to impart safety and security to the businesses of the NTT Group, which continue their challenge for the sake of new value creation and global stability, and to support the growth of those businesses, we will keep on adequately protecting the research and development results we obtain as IP as well as push forward with its utilization while respecting the IP of others.\n\nOur objective\n\nIntellectual Property Management Our Approach to Intellectual Property\n\nThe business activities of the NTT Group are sustained by products and services derived from the results of our aggressive R&D. For this reason, we believe that appropriate protection and utilization of intellectual property generated by R&D is vital for the NTT Group to achieve continuous growth, which in turn will enable us to continue contributing to our customers and society at large. We strive to protect the intellectual property of the NTT Group and promote activities that respect the intellectual property of others in every aspect of our business activities.\n\nSystem of Intellectual Property Management\n\nNTT protects the results of its R&D to maintain its competitive edge but at the same time makes its intellectual property available to a wider audience by licensing technologies that would contribute to the development of industries and businesses as well as standardized technologies that are already used in society.\n\nUnder the leadership of the NTT Intellectual Property Center, NTT has established policies for intellectual property activities involving the entire NTT Group and also provides support and coordination for the use and management of intellectual properties, aggregates the opinions within the Group on the intellectual property system and disseminates information outside the Group.\n\nProtection of Third Party Intellectual Property\n\nIn order to prevent the infringement of domestic and overseas third party rights, NTT examines the third party rights of technologies used in our business at every step from the early stage of research and development up to the provision of the developed technologies to Group companies. NTT also strives to enhance the Group's compliance with intellectual property laws and regulations in Japan and abroad and mitigate potential business risks by sharing among the Group companies information on system amendments, and trends concerning intellectual property including disputes and court cases.\n\nNTT Intellectual Property Center\n\nExternal Utilization of R&D Outcomes\n\nIntellectual property portfolio related to green transformation (GX)\n\nThe results of R&D, which play a major role in the creation of intellectual property for NTT Group, has translated into ownership of approximately 18,000 patents around the world.\n\nAmong those patents, for the five green transformation (GX) technologies in the \"GXTI (Green Transformation Technologies Inventory)\" technological category created by the Japan Patent Office in June 2022 in order to establish a panoramic perspective of GX technologies, NTT can confirm that the research and development outcomes it has nurtured over time has yielded the ownership of patents in energy supply (gxA), batteries and energy storage (gxC) and energy saving, electrification and demand-supply flexibility (gxB), in that order.\n\nGXTI（\n\nhttps://www.jpo.go.jp/resources/statistics/gxti.html ）\n\nReinforce and Globalize Research and Development Policies and Concepts\n\nAs ICT companies leading the world, the NTT Group recognizes R&D as a material issue that gives Group companies their competitive edge. R&D supports the digital transformation of our customers and lifestyle transformations tailored to individuals, and the R&D department works with operating companies to develop new technologies that provide the wellspring for new value creation in a variety of domains to enhance the NTT Group's R&D, a pillar of our medium-term management strategy.\n\nThe NTT Group seeks to overcome numerous problems involving safety, disaster readiness, and the improvement of productivity through R&D and, as a result, strengthen industrial competitiveness and resolve social issues. Since ICT is applied in a variety of fields, we are forging partnerships with counterparts in wide-ranging industries as we pursue our R&D initiatives.\n\nIOWN GLOBAL FORUM Linking Companies and Academic Institutions Across the Globe\n\nOrganization for Implementation\n\nThe NTT Group's R&D activities focus on making the IOWN concept a reality, as well as basic research and applied research. Basic research serves as the backbone of telecommunications, such as basic and component technologies related to services and networks, while applied research is conducted by operating companies and is closely related to their respective businesses. These R&D activities are undertaken by NTT's IOWN Integrated Innovation Center, Service Innovation Laboratory Group, Information Network Laboratory Group, and Science and Core Technology Laboratory Group.\n\nAlso, we promote general producer activities, in which we formulate marketing and business plans and forge alliances so that the results of research by NTT laboratories can be transformed into Group businesses. In these general producer activities, we seek to develop business in a timely manner by combining the wide-ranging basic technologies of NTT laboratories with external technologies in collaboration with Group companies and with various other companies to create new services. In order for innovation to continually be an important driver of the NTT Group well into the future, we will aim to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by promoting innovations for social issues. These efforts will include patent applications and the publication of scientific papers.\n\nReinforce and Globalize Research and Development\n\nR&D to make the IOWN concept a reality\n\nPromoting Other Cutting-Edge Research\n\nWhy IOWN is essential\n\nThe development of digital technology has broughtabout a number of technological innovations, such as ultra-high definition images, but we believe that we must change our mindset to achieve further evolution.\n\nWith IOWN, we believe it is important to try to grasp phenomena and information as they are through a more diverse set of values and perceptions, as opposed to filtering them through human-only values. Dr. Jakob von Uexkull, a German biologist, proposed the concept of the \"self-centered world\" (\"Umwelt\" in German), which states that all living things have a species- specific perceptual system, and that each has a world based on its own species-specific perception and acts as its own subject. The IOWN concept is based on the idea that different subjects see things in different ways, and that the information being conveyed and the processing method will vary according to the values of each subject. Thus, it aims to convey and process every bit of information in accordance with the values of each subject.\n\nWhile dramatically low latency, enormous bandwidth, and very small latency fluctuations are required to make these new ideas a reality, the current internet is reaching its limits in terms of both transmission and processing capacities. Furthermore, power consumption continues to increase in tandem with the enormous amount of information being processed, and the increase in CO2 emissions has become a serious global issue. NTT Group's vision of a high-capacity, low-latency, low-power-consumption infrastructure that can handle information as-is requires an end-to-end, fullstack redesign and optimization that breaks away from individually designed layers, from networking to computing. The key to this is \"photoelectric merging\" technology. Conventionally, optical signals and electronic signals have had their roles completely separated into \"transmission\" and \"processing,\" respectively, and the task of converting the two types of signals is inefficient and consumes a lot of power. If we tightly integrate optics and electronics, we can apply optical technology to the entire system, down to the processor level, and we can rethink the architecture (structure) from a full stack perspective.\n\nThe advantages of IOWN\n\nI think the optics-related expertise that NTT has accumulated over the years is a big advantage. What everyone is probably most familiar with is internet connection services using fiber optic cables, but NTT has long been researching the possibility of not only using fiber optic cables as a transmission medium, but using optics as a basis for transmission equipment and information processing. The results of these research projects are being put on a development track that brings them closer to commercialization, with the goal being practical applications. In terms of recent achievements, the core of \"photoelectric merging technology\" is the ability to perform optical-electrical and electrical- optical conversion at ultra-high speeds and with ultra-low power consumption. In LSI, the input/output (I/O) consumes the most electricity, and the impact of replacing this with light is quite significant. Moreover, with electricity, power consumption increases rapidly as the distance over which signals are transmitted increases, but with light, power consumption does not increase very quickly. Thus, by utilizing light through photoelectric merging technology, it is possible to achieve not only ultra-high speeds, an original characteristic of light, but also ultra-low power consumption. A typical example is the optical transistor developed by NTT in 2019, the first in the world to combine ultra- high speeds with ultra-low power consumption. A transistor is a conversion device that can output an electrical signal in its proper form by providing it with a control signal. Converting signals is called switching. Conventional light-switching devices are huge and cost several hundred billion yen, but now that optical transistors have been created, they have been reduced to the size of a piece of chewing gum. In addition, the research and development of optical transistors involves not only signal processing technology, but also the creation of optical modulators. This requires know-how regarding stabilization at high accuracy so as not to disturb the spectrum of a certain wavelength, which is an analog technology that is part of a cottage industry. The fact that we are now able to connect long distances optically is largely due to utilization of our technology. To cope with the increase in data volume and power consumption, a structural evolution from electronic processing to optical transmission is essential, and the breakthrough in the technology supporting this structural evolution hinges on the higher precision, smaller size, and lower cost of optical transistors. Therein lies NTT's advantage.\n\nAnticipated business model\n\nIOWN will be available in a variety of domains, but here are two easy-to-understand scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's consider the interior of a data center, disaggregated computing. A personal computer has a similar structure, but a server has an interface, a CPU, memory, and storage. The current trend is for the CPU to issue instructions, temporarily store information in memory, and then store the information resulting from its calculations in storage.\n\nThe CPUs used to be run by electrical signals, but by directly connecting accelerators such as GPUs and DPUs via light and linking them with different wavelengths, it is no longer necessary for each server to have its own CPUs and memory. CPUs are located in one casing and memory in another, and connecting them optically makes it possible to create a situation in which it appears as if a very large amount of CPUs and memory are installed on a single server.\n\nDisaggregated computing\n\nThis allows for a scalable computing infrastructure with ultra-low power consumption, high-speed processing, and the ability to add as many parts as required. One potential business model in this case would involve selling optical transistors. In addition to the optical transistors themselves, products that incorporate photoelectric merging technology and optical modulators into computer motherboards and semiconductor packages are also a possibility. Essentially, we would be selling key components. Next, we will expand the scope somewhat to include all-photonics networks, which utilize optics between networks, and areas outside the data center. Optical transmission technology used in the core of relay systems that connect cities and in metro networks that extend throughout cities can be expanded to the end user's neighborhood, which would allow for flexible configuration of ultra- high-capacity optical paths, such as a \"one wavelength per person\" model, for each application. It would be like having a dedicated, on-demand, one-toone optical line with no video compression and almost no delay in transmission and reception. optical paths, can be used to reduce power consumption.\n\nAPNs could be used for the mobile fronthaul portion that links base stations and mobile antennas. In urban areas, the population changes depending on whether it is day or night, so traffic volumes will inevitably vary. For this reason, load balancing, which dynamically constructs optical paths, can be used to reduce power consumption. APNs can also be used as lines linking data centers. These days, it is difficult to set up large data centers that require enormous amounts of power.\n\nIn the future, small- and medium-sized data centers will be dispersed over a broad area, and it will be necessary to connect these distributed data centers using light so that they can operate at a level comparable to that of large-scale data centers. Large-scale data centers require enormous amounts of electricity, but if spread out, they can also make use of renewable energy generated close to their locations, thus enabling local production for local consumption of energy. Potential business models for cases in which APNs are provided include: acting as an infrastructure service provider, such as providing mobile fronthaul and networks between data centers; a data center business that provides distributed data centers connected by APNs; and a product business selling optical transceivers to be installed in data centers edges.\n\nAll-photonics network (APN) characteristics\n\nWhat are some use cases?\n\nIOWN is an innovative concept based on light that communicates and processes things as-is and helps to create a new smart society with low energy consumption in a sustainable manner that is not attainable with our current internet. Some use cases that are anticipated at this stage include the following.\n\nWhile (1) providing interconnect solutions for data center operators and (2) providing mobile networks for mobile operators have already been introduced, (3) providing networks for events (live broadcasts, cloud-based e-sports broadcasts) is another potential use case. We have already conducted demonstration tests for cloud-based e-sports event broadcasts. Competitive games via the cloud are fought in real time, and it will be essential to exchange large amounts of 8k video data with a delay of less than 20 ms. A delay of a few milliseconds compared to a delay 10 times that amount will result in a different attack timing. It is impossible to fight within a game in an environment where the timing of attacks is off due to delay. The delay in the demonstration test was 20 ms, but we are making efforts to lower this to a few milliseconds, and we are currently developing a system that can control the delay in 1-μs increments to enable synchronization.\n\nFuture schedule and milestones\n\nWe hope to conduct early demonstrations of these use cases, receive feedback from customers, and further refine the IOWN technology. Then, starting around 2020, we have been proceeding with field demonstrations to users and areas that need advanced services, such as smart cities and critical infrastructure. Around fiscal 2022, we will roll out services, though it will still be limited to specific uses and areas. After 2026, we will expand the service nationwide by connecting areas where it has already been implemented. Also, an important event coming up in the near future is the Osaka Kansai Expo 2025. We hope to convey a part of our IOWN-based worldview in an easy-to-understand manner, combining some of the IOWN technologies we have mentioned thus far with existing technologies as well. In doing so, we hope to present a new kind of value through partnerships with various companies and organizations, which will lead to these technologies subsequently being implemented throughout society.\n\nIOWN Expansion Roadmap\n\nBusiness Activity 18\n\nContribution to the revitalization of local communities and economies\n\nOur commitment\n\nAs a leader in digital transformation, we will act and contribute to helping resolve the social challenges unique to each country For example, the declining birthrate and aging population, proper education, equitable healthcare, regional economic development, and long-term value through technology for the next generations\n\nOur objective\n\nContributing to the Vitalization of Regional Societies and Economies\n\nAdvancing Personalization by Supporting the Transformation of Lifestyles\n\nWe support customers as they transform ever-diversifying lifestyles by providing personal solutions centered on DOCOMO that closely align with individual needs.
