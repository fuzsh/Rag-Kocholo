        "text": "Veritas Software Corp announced three key deals for its storage management software yesterday. The Mountain View-based company said it was expanding its existing relationship with Hewlett Packard Co so that HP could distribute Veritas products directly through its HP Local Products Organization. Veritas already supplies HP with foundation level storage technologies. And Veritas has agreed with another of its partners, NCR Corp, to deliver the Veritas Foundation Suite on Sun Microsystems Incâ€™s Solaris x86 Unix operating system, which NCR uses on its Intel based servers. In a third agreement Veritas announced a partnership with Symbios Inc, the semiconductor and storage system subsidiary of Hyundai Electronics America currently being sold to LSI Logic Inc (CI No 3,442). The two plan to develop storage area networking products."
