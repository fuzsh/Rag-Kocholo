        "text": "Anders Fogh Rasmussen will share his views on current geopolitical challenges, staying ahead of security threats and Europe's role in the fight for freedom\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen, renowned Danish politician, and former NATO Secretary General, recognized for his firm leadership, unwavering dedication to democratic principles, and active promotion of global security and cooperation, will be a keynote speaker at the ABSL Summit 2023 – Lead the way. Stay ahead, which will be held September 6-8 in Kraków. In his speech Mr. Rasmussen will address issues including security as a top driver for attracting foreign direct investments, as well as mitigating the risks the economy and business faces against a backdrop of geopolitical instability.\n\nThe ABSL Summit is one of the most important business services events in Europe and one of the key business events in the CEE region. Each year, the ABSL Summit attracts over 1000 business leaders from all over the world as well as public sector representatives, economists, trendsetters, academics, and opinion-forming media. The main themes of this year’s event will be the resilience of business and its ability to forge a path in an uncertain environment, the adaptability that maintains our region’s leading role in the business services sector, and the industry’s capacity to expand even when faced with unexpected changes.\n\nThe keynote speaker of the ABSL Summit 2023 will be Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who has been at the centre of European and global politics for over three decades as Secretary General of NATO, Prime Minister of Denmark, Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, and a leading Danish parliamentarian. At the ABSL Summit, Rasmussen will give a keynote speech, under the title, Stay ahead of security threats: Europe's role in the fight for freedom. He will shed light on the current security issues and geopolitical trends, based on his great knowledge and experience in these respective fields. Mr. Rasmussen is currently working with the Office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on security guarantees for Ukraine. He will be able to provide an invaluable perspective regarding the ongoing conflict.\n\nAs a former Secretary General of NATO, Mr. Rasmussen possesses a unique and nuanced point of view on the security implications of the crisis, while his experience in navigating complex international relations has equipped him with the tools necessary to provide insightful analysis. Furthermore, his work on European and transatlantic relations has given him a comprehensive understanding of the economic and political dimensions of the Ukraine war triggered by Russia’s invasion, allowing him to address the conflict from a holistic perspective.\n\nJanusz Dziurzyński, President of ABSL, said: “In the light of Russian invasion to Ukraine it is even more important than ever to convey to foreign investors the message that despite being located on the EU and NATO’s eastern flank, Poland and the CEE region’s security is protected by these two organizations. In these challenging times we need bold and wise voices, such as the renowned advocate for democracy, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who imparts nuanced perspectives on contemporary global security issues. I am proud that the ABSL Summit in Poland, which serves as a bridge between Ukraine and the West, has now become a platform for such a thought-provoking discourse on how to stay ahead of security threats”.\n\nThe ABSL Summit will take place on September 6 - 8, 2023 in Kraków, the number one destination for business services in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nABOUT ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen has been at the center of European and global politics for over three decades as Secretary General of NATO, Prime Minister of Denmark, Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, and, last but not least, as a leading Danish parliamentarian. On October 1st, 2014, Anders Fogh Rasmussen established Rasmussen Global. He is currently advising the Ukrainian government on a pro-bono basis on future security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen began his political career in 1978, becoming the youngest member of Parliament in Denmark at the age of 25. He was promoted to Minister of Economic Affairs in 1990 and became Prime Minister of Denmark in 2001. He held this position until 2009 when he was appointed Secretary General of NATO.
