        "text": "Yesterday evening, leaders from 20 countries joined President Biden and President Zelenskyy to launch the Ukraine Compact in Washington D.C. This is an important moment. The Compact brings together a web of long-term bilateral security agreements signed between Ukraine and its partners over the last year. It creates a security framework to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression now and deter it in the future. I strongly welcome the Ukraine Compact, which is built on the Kyiv Security Compact that I authored with President Zelenskyy’s Chief-of-Staff Andriy Yermak. For the past two years, Rasmussen Global has worked closely with the Ukrainian President’s Office to promote the need for long-term security guarantees for Ukraine. This war will only end when Vladimir Putin understands that Ukraine’s allies are committed for as long as it takes, and to give as much as it takes for Ukraine to win. The Ukraine Compact formalizes that resolve. Alongside the Compact, the announcements on NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, a permanent representative in Kyiv, and a new $40 billion yearly commitment from allies are welcome. However, the Washington Summit disappointed on the bigger strategic question: Ukraine’s path to membership. Despite promises that Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration is irreversible, Ukraine remains stuck in NATO’s waiting room. The only way of showing Vladimir Putin that our commitment is truly irreversible is by opening accession talks with Ukraine to join the alliance. Leaders should have taken that bold step in Washington, instead they leave a shadow of a doubt that Putin will continue to exploit.\n\nThe European Union has nominated its new top leadership team. Congratulations to Ursula von der Leyen on her nomination for a second term as European Commission President, Kaja Kallas as EU foreign policy chief, and Antonio Costa on his appointment as European Council President. I now look forward to the new European Commission being formed and hope that the European Parliament will approve these nominations in good time. This is a critical moment for Europe—with democracy under threat in Ukraine, a hostile Russia on our borders, an increasingly autocratic and aggressive China, and the challenges and opportunities of the green transition and digital revolution. There is a lot of work to do, but Europe’s global leadership looks to be in good hands.\n\nCongratulations Mark Rutte on becoming the next NATO Secretary General. NATO is the most successful military alliance in history and has been the bedrock of our security for 75 years. Being Secretary General was one of the greatest honours of my life and I am sure it will be the same for you as well. At a dangerous moment for the Euro-Atlantic area, I can’t think of a better leader to guide the Alliance through these troubled waters. I wish you all the best for your term.\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy will soon be under new management. While Ursula von der Leyen seems well positioned to carry on as European Commission president, there will be a new president of the European Council and a new foreign-policy chief. They will inherit an unenviable agenda that includes dealing with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But when it comes to determining Europe’s place in the world, how they respond to an increasingly aggressive China will be just as important. Too often in the past, European leaders have put short-term commercial calculations ahead of European values and long-term interests when dealing with Beijing. With China stepping up its use of economic coercion and military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, sending mixed signals is immensely dangerous. The EU’s new leadership team must understand that and speak clearly with one voice to Xi Jinping. If they do not, their successors will face an even more dangerous reality. https://lnkd.in/eNYWTW6k\n\nLast week, Rasmussen Global hosted its Geopolitical Gårdhave (Courtyard) at Folkemødet for the second year. The courtyard brings debates on the most pressing global issues to Folkemødet (the ‘people’s meeting’) in Bornholm. I am delighted that the courtyard was packed for every session, as we discussed Ukraine, Taiwan, space, energy, critical infrastructure, US and European elections, and much more. The Geopolitical Courtyard is there to show how major global events have a direct impact on all our lives. On stage, I was clear that Denmark, Europe, and the whole democratic world must do everything to deliver a Ukrainian victory and lay the foundations for a lasting peace. A huge thank you to all those in the Rasmussen Global team that worked so hard to make the Geopolitical Courtyard such a success – we will be back even bigger next year!\n\nIt is now one month since the Copenhagen Democracy Summit 2024. It was an incredible event with powerful speeches from political and business leaders. Most importantly, we heard from democracy activists from around the world, those fighting against repression and for a future based on freedom. See the highlights from this year’s event in the wrap-up video below and I look forward to welcoming you at next year’s summit on 13-14 May 2025!\n\nYesterday evening the United States signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukraine. This is an important moment; it shows that the United States is committed to Ukraine’s security for the long-haul. The agreement is built on the Kyiv Security Compact that I co-authored with President Zelenskyy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak. It includes the four main elements that we proposed: building Ukraine’s military to such a strength that it can win this war and deter future Russian aggression, enhanced intelligence sharing, expansion of training and exercises with Ukrainian forces, and developing Ukraine’s military industrial base. Alongside the U.S – Ukraine pact, Japan also signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy. This means all G7 nations have now signed agreements built on the principles set out in the Kyiv Security Compact. To bring this war to an end, Vladimir Putin must understand that he cannot outlast us. The economic and military might of the democratic world dwarfs that of Russia - if we are resolved and united Ukraine will win. The agreements are a positive step, but they are not the end destination. For lasting peace and security in Europe, we must embed Ukraine in the political and military structures of the Euro-Atlantic area. We must bring Ukraine into both NATO and the European Union without delay.\n\nIt was great to be back in Madrid last week to meet with political and business leaders. On Friday, I met with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares. I thanked him for Spain’s strong support of Ukraine and discussed the report on Ukraine’s security and Euro-Atlantic integration that I presented with President Zelenskyy’s Chief-of-Staff Andriy Yermak in Copenhagen last month. We need strong leadership from Madrid and all European capitals, to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to win this war but also the political courage to move Ukraine forward on its path to EU and NATO membership. A strong Ukraine at the heart of the Euro-Atlantic area is not only good for Ukraine, it is the only way to guarantee long-term peace and security in Europe."
