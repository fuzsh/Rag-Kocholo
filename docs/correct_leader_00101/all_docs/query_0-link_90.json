Trained as an economist at the Univ. of Aarhus, he joined the Danish Folketing (parliament) as a member of the Liberal party in 1978 at age 25, becoming the body's youngest member. He was minister for taxation (1987–92) and minister for economic affairs (1990–92). From 1992 to 1998, he was the Liberal party's national spokesperson, becoming party chairman in 1998. After the 2001 elections, he became prime minister of a Liberal-led center-right coalition; it remained in office after the 2005 and 2007 elections. He resigned as prime minister after being chosen as NATO's secretary-general (2009–14), and was succeeded by Lars Løkke Rasmussen.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.
