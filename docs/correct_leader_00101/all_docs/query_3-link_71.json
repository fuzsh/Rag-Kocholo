The same year he became member of the Danish Parliament representing the Liberal Party.\n\nRasmussen held numerous positions in government and opposition throughout his political career. From 1987 to 1992 he was Minister for Taxation and from 1990 to 1992 also Minister for Economic Affairs in the Conservative-Liberal coalition Government.\n\nAs Minister for Economic Affairs and member of the EU's ECOFIN-council 1990-92, Mr. Rasmussen was the Danish negotiator of and signatory to the Maastricht Treaty which eventually led to the introduction of the single currency, the euro.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1998 he was spokesman for the Liberal Party and from 1993 to 1998 in addition vice-chairman of the Parliament's Economic and Political Affairs Committee. In 1998 he became chairman of the Liberal Party's national organisation and vice-chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Policy Board.\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections in 2001 he formed his first government, a coalition consisting of the Liberal Party and the Conservative People's Party. His government was re-elected in 2005 and 2007 respectively, and he held the position as Prime Minister until he was elected as future NATO Secretary General at the Strasbourg-Kehl Summit in April 2009.\n\nDuring the Danish Presidency of the European Union from July to December 2002, Rasmussen played a key role in the process leading to conclusion of the accession negotiations with 10 candidates for EU-membership at the meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen in December 2002.\n\nRasmussen is married to Anne-Mette Rasmussen. They have three children. In his spare time, he is a passionate runner, and he also enjoys cycling and kayaking.\n\nPolitical career:"
