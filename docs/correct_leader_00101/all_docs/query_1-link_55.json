        "text": "The overarching question imparting urgency to this exploration is: Can U.S.-Russian contention in cyberspace cause the two nuclear superpowers to stumble into war? In considering this question we were constantly reminded of recent comments by a prominent U.S. arms control expert: At least as dangerous as the risk of an actual cyberattack, he observed, is cyber operations’ “blurring of the line between peace and war.” Or, as Nye wrote, “in the cyber realm, the difference between a weapon and a non-weapon may come down to a single line of code, or simply the intent of a computer program’s user.”\n\nRenewables are widely perceived as an opportunity to shatter the hegemony of fossil fuel-rich states and democratize the energy landscape. Virtually all countries have access to some renewable energy resources (especially solar and wind power) and could thus substitute foreign supply with local resources. Our research shows, however, that the role countries are likely to assume in decarbonized energy systems will be based not only on their resource endowment but also on their policy choices.\n\n'Conversations in Diplomacy' is the Future of Diplomacy Project's podcast series. In this installment of “Conversations in Diplomacy,\" the Project's Faculty Director,Nicholas Burns, speaks with Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former NATO Secretary General and Prime Minister of Norway. Mr. Rasmussen discusses his new book, The Will to Lead:America's Indispensable Role in the Global Fight for Freedom, and explains the personal and strategic reasons behind his strong support for American global leadership.\n\nListen here:"
