        "text": "Rarely have I found a Rules-based Security System so fascinating. Never have I paid such close attention to cyber-defence. A substantive package for Georgia, you say? Yippee!\n\nMy interest in the summit is first and foremost because I am a politically engaged citizen. And not because hotshot Anders Fogh Rasmussen is the sort of rugged, rangy primus inter pares that has me doodling love hearts all over my limited-edition copy of the North Atlantic Treaty. Oh no.\n\nThe dashing Dane, who was previously prime minister of his country, has the can-do air of an all-terrain skier, the strong-jawed tenacity of a chap who negotiates the Jutland fjords like a Viking, and the salt-and-pepper hair of a silver fox.\n\nWhen he’s not being the 12th General Secretary, I strongly suspect he’s moonlighting as the Milk Tray man or limbering up for a starring role in the Scandi political drama Borgen.\n\nAren’t women always complaining about men who do that? Well, yes we are, but there’s a big difference; we can admire his style and his substance simultaneously; it’s called multi-tasking.\n\nStrip-search terror as we head home from darkest Peru\n\n\"Mummy, have you ever been strip-searched before?”\n\nAn unnerving question but, under the circumstances, an entirely reasonable one, given we were caught up in a South American drugs bust.\n\nAnd let me tell you if there’s one thing scarier than a soldier with a gun, it’s a soldier with a gun putting on a pair of Latex surgical gloves with a business-like “thwack!” at each wrist.\n\nFirst, a little background: my 12-year-old and I returned this week from an extraordinary life-changing trip to Peru, (about which I shall write, orchidaceously, on these pages once my blood pressure lowers).\n\nFor the journey back, we boarded the plane at Jorge Chavez airport in Lima for our 12-hour flight, when we were abruptly told to get off with all our hand luggage.\n\nNo explanation. Assuming there was a fault with the plane, we disembarked – to find a Peruvian army platoon, bristling with weapons, sniffer dogs straining on leashes.\n\nWe were bussed to a building where our luggage was re-scanned and we were patted down by security guards, who gave each of us a piece of paper bearing either the letter A or B and ordered us to sit in a room next door, one end of which was ominously partitioned off with medical screens.\n\nNo one told us what was going to happen – and nobody stood up to ask. And in a moment of high farce, I needed the loo at a moment that could only have added to any possible suspicion.\n\nA head-turningly beautiful female soldier with a murderous expression accompanied me across the room to the Ladies and passed me over to a female security guard who escorted me inside.\n\nFor one horrific moment, I though she was going to make me keep the door open. Mercifully, she waited outside the cubicle – but then searched it afterwards.\n\nBut it was while I was being marched back to my seat that I got the shock of my life. Behind the screens were soldiers putting on surgical gloves, security guards, more dogs and two long rows of tables.\n\nOn those tables, spaced out at two-foot intervals, was a long wooden skewer and a wet-wipe. Seriously. I mean, seriously?\n\nMy mind, dear readers, boggled. Boggled to the point I got an hysterical fit of the giggles, which drew glances, but at least distracted my daughter.\n\nNationality was immaterial; a week ago, 10 people in the UK were jailed for a total of 140 years for plotting a “vast cocaine” smuggling operation into the UK from Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd last year, two young women, one Scottish, the other from my home town of Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were caught smuggling £1.5 million worth of cocaine at this very airport and are now languishing in a high security prison awaiting transfer to a UK jail.\n\nThe only drugs in my bag were malaria pills and statins – but what if that charming chap in Duty Free had hollowed out the inside of my giant Toblerone and filled the chocolate, nougat and almondless vacuum with cocaine?\n\nJust as I was working myself into a frenzy, the pilot and cabin crew were summoned behind the screens. Then, as hold luggage was offloaded, a man yelled out the name of a passenger and they disappeared behind the screen, too.\n\nThe situation was still stressful rather than terrifying, but I’d be lying if I said the sinister wooden skewer and wet-wipe combo wasn’t a nagging concern.\n\nTwo hours had passed and I was wondering whether, if strip-searched, I could make a claim on my Post Office travel insurance, when the dogs started barking. They had scented drugs.\n\nWe were told to return to the plane. As my daughter and I looked back, we saw soldiers slicing into the lining of suitcases with knives.\n\nIn front of the bags stood three bemused-looking elderly women, who hardly fitted the classic image of drug mules, but perhaps that was their USP?\n\nBack on board, I checked the international news online, I discovered that two days earlier, Peruvian police had displayed at the airport the largest cocaine haul (7.7 tons) seized in the country’s history. And as I gratefully fastened my seatbelt, I felt a surge of “what if?” relief that nobody had surreptitiously hidden a stray bag of it in the Ladies.\n\nThree cheers for Judy Murray, high-kicking out of her tennis-playing sons’ shadow for a spangly stint on Strictly.\n\nAnd for Judy Finnegan, flying solo on Loose Women after a career as Goose to her husband’s Maverick.\n\nIt’s refreshing and inspirational to see these women demonstrate such brio in their middle years. Murray, in particular, has been characteristically upfront about her desire to showcase her own abilities after so many years “saturated” with tennis.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t she bask in the spotlight? Men of a certain age tend, with tiresome predictability, to reinvent themselves by upgrading to a trophy wife, so it’s heartening to see this pair choosing to go it alone.\n\nI’m sure Judy M, 54, will have a ball in sequins and feathers; her recent makeover signalled that she was ready to shed the sweatshirted asexuality of a proverbial tennis mom.\n\nAs for Judy F, 66, having vowed to quit telly for good, she’s been persuaded to change her mind, not for a sofa in the comfort zone, but for the cut and thrust of Loose Women, where clashing opinions are strongly held and emphatically expressed. I wish her luck, too.\n\nIt’s an unassailable rule that one is an example, two is a coincidence, but three is a trend. I’m sorely tempted to shorten my name just to see what happens…\n\nHelp others, help yourself\n\nI have a nostalgic fondness for bossy public information films. The ones about the playing child being drowned in a gravel pit and the toddler scalded and scarred by a hot cup of tea are seared onto my retina four decades on.\n\nWhich is why I’m all for the return of this nanny-state-knows-best propaganda to counter the leeching of common sense from our health & safety, self-obsessed culture.\n\nA depressing third of people surveyed by St John Ambulance admitted they would be reluctant to go to the aid of a stranger in extremis for fear they might be sued.\n\nTwice that proportion would be put off because they felt their scant knowledge of first aid might do more harm than good. Then again, it might not.\n\nI can understand an unwillingness to perform a pavement tracheotomy with a ballpoint pen, but surely all of us have a responsibility to grasp the basics, like unblocking an airway or applying a ligature?\n\nNot only does basic first-aid education increase our chance of saving others but it boosts our own chances of being saved.\n\nThe new public information format could be updated to cover the 21st-century dangers of ambient Instagramming and ice-bucket challenging in traffic."
