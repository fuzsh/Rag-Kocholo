        "text": "The Taliban has detained a former politician, a journalist, and a filmmaker in recent days across Afghanistan, according to their relatives.\n\nThe detentions mark a sharp escalation of the extremist group's crackdown on dissent, a violent campaign that has targeted reporters, activists, and political figures.\n\nThe latest target of the clampdown was Sayyed Rahim Saeedi, a television producer and filmmaker based in the capital, Kabul.\n\nRelatives of Saeedi, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi that members of the General Directorate of Intelligence, the Taliban's notorious intelligence agency, detained him and his son on July 20.\n\nHis son was freed on July 21, the relatives said.\n\nIt was not clear why they were detained. The filmmaker's whereabouts remain unknown, and the Taliban has not commented on his detention.\n\nMeanwhile, the Taliban detained Rohullah Rauf, the former head of the provincial council in the northeastern province of Takhar, a source close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity told Radio Azadi.\n\nThe source said Rauf was detained by the Taliban after returning home from Friday Prayers on July 19. It was unclear why he was detained, the source said.\n\nMowloda Tawana, an Afghan rights campaigner, said Rauf's detention showed that the Taliban was not committed to the amnesty that it announced shortly after seizing power in 2021.\n\nThe blanket amnesty included all Afghan officials, security forces, and individuals who cooperated with the departed U.S.-led military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nBut international rights watchdogs and the United Nations have documented widespread cases of retribution -- including extrajudicial killings and torture.\n\nMeanwhile, freelance journalist Mohammadyar Majrooh was detained by the Taliban in the southern city of Kandahar, according to his relatives.\n\nRelatives of Majrooh said the reporter was detained on July 12. His whereabouts are unknown, they said.\n\nMajrooh was previously detained in February 2023 while working on a report for the private Tolo News channel.\n\nIn a statement issued on July 17, the Afghanistan Journalists Center, a local media watchdog, demanded that Majrooh be released \"without further delay and without conditions.\"\n\nHamid Obaidi, head of the Afghanistan Journalists Support Organization, another media watchdog, said the \"illegal detentions and harassment of journalists violate the freedom of speech.\"\n\n\"We strongly condemn these detentions,\" Obaidi told Radio Azadi.\n\nThe Taliban's intelligence agency did not respond to Radio Azadi's requests for comment about the recent detentions.\n\nSince its takeover in August 2021, the Taliban has detained and jailed scores of journalists, activists, and academics for publicly opposing its repressive policies.\n\nHundreds of Afghan journalists have fled their homeland because of intimidation or for fear of persecution. The Taliban has banned several international broadcasters and denied visas to foreign journalists.\n\nAs part of its assault on dissent, the militant group has also clamped down on political parties and local nongovernmental organizations. The Taliban banned all political groups and NGOs last year.\n\nWritten by Abubakar Siddique based on reporting by Firuza Azizi of RFE/RL's Radio Azadi\n\nThe homes of several Afghan migrants in the southern Iranian city of Khur have reportedly been set on fire in apparent retaliation for the killing of an Iranian man allegedly by an Afghan national.\n\nHosna, an Afghan who lives in Khur, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi on July 19 that he moved his family from Khur to Shiraz in Fars Province out of fear for their safety.\n\n\"People in the region are very angry and set homes of several Afghans on fire,\" he claimed.\n\nHosna and others who spoke to Radio Azadi attributed the anger to the July 3 killing of a 62-year-old restaurant owner in the town of Khenj by his 17-year-old apprentice. Iranian media have not identified the nationality of the suspected killer, but Hosna said the suspect was an Afghan citizen.\n\n\"The people of the region have sworn not to sell 1 kilogram of meat, or even a piece of bread, to Afghan nationals,\" Hosna said. \"So, many were forced to flee to Shiraz.\"\n\nAnti-Afghan sentiment in Iran has been on the rise in recent years, especially after a mass influx of migrants following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.\n\nOccasionally, a hashtag that describes the expulsion of Afghan migrants as a \"national demand\" becomes a top trend on X, formerly Twitter, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nLast week, an unsubstantiated claim on social media blamed Afghan migrants for an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran.\n\nThe UN’s refugee agency says Iran hosts around 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to some 2.6 million undocumented Afghan migrants. But Iran claimed last year that the number of illegal Afghan immigrants was closer to 5 million.\n\nThe authorities have vowed to deport illegal refugees and hundreds of Afghan migrants are sent back to Afghanistan every day. They are also banned from living or working in half of Iran's 31 provinces.\n\nAfghans living in Iran have complained to Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:13 0:00\n\nTehran has for years maintained that it does not receive sufficient financial aid from international organizations to handle the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nAn unsubstantiated claim on social media linking an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran to the country’s Afghan community has resulted in renewed calls for the expulsion of Afghan migrants.\n\nIranian media have cited the Health Ministry as reporting nine new cases of leprosy over the past year. The reports said three of those afflicted were Afghans.\n\nThe same day, a freelance Iranian journalist who advocates for the expulsion of Afghan refugees alleged without evidence that “Afghan migrants” were responsible for spreading leprosy in Iran.\n\nHe incorrectly charged that “no cases of leprosy had been seen in Iran in years” -- a claim that is easily debunked by data available on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website.\n\nOn July 9, another journalist who often writes in support of expelling Afghan migrants went as far as calling the alleged rise in leprosy cases “bioterrorism” and demanded that the incoming government of President-elect Masud Pezeshkian “start deporting Afghans.”\n\n“Afghans are bringing and spreading the leprosy virus,” he wrote without offering evidence, falsely claiming that leprosy, which is caused by bacteria, is a viral disease.\n\nBoth posts on the social media platform X have received nearly half a million views, been shared more than 1,000 times, and liked by over 7,000 accounts.\n\nWhat Does The Data Say?\n\nLeprosy in Iran has never been eliminated, but it has declined sharply since 2005, dropping from 79 to six in 2022, according to WHO data. No certified health authority has ever declared leprosy an epidemic in Iran or Afghanistan.\n\nLeprosy is a chronic bacterial infectious disease that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. It is curable but leaving it untreated may cause permanent disabilities.\n\nThe disease spreads via droplets from the nose and mouth through close and frequent contact with untreated individuals.\n\nRising Anti-Afghan Sentiment\n\nAfghans fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1980s were welcomed in Iran, thanks in large part to the anti-Soviet views of the recently established Islamic republic. But animosity toward the growing Afghan community has only worsened since.\n\nIn recent years -- especially after an influx of migrants following the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021 -- there have been more frequent displays of anti-Afghan sentiment.\n\nOver the past several months, a Persian hashtag that calls the “expulsion of Afghans” a “national demand” has been trending, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nThe UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, says Iran hosts 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to 2.6 million undocumented Afghan nationals.\n\nBut the authorities in Tehran claimed last year that 5 million Afghans were living in Iran illegally, and vowed to deport them. Afghan migrants were later banned from living or working in half of the country’s 31 provinces.\n\nIn recent months, Afghan migrants in Iran have complained to RFE/RL's Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nIran has long said that it does not receive enough financial assistance from international bodies to deal with the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nThe world has long been aware of the scourge of apartheid -- the systemic segregation or discrimination of people based on their race. But what about the institutionalized practice of singling people out for ill-treatment due to their gender?\n\nThe push to recognize \"gender apartheid\" under international law is gaining steam, with oppression against women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran fueling calls for immediate action, but tremendous obstacles remain.\n\nWhat Do They Want?\n\nAdvocates want to clearly define gender apartheid as a crime under international law. Currently, only \"persecution\" on the basis of gender is recognized as a crime against humanity. But rights groups and activists say the concept of persecution does not fully capture the scope of the abuses committed under a system of institutionalized gender apartheid.\n\nThe goal is for the United Nations to make up for this gap by legally shielding women and girls from systemic abuse and violence.\n\nAfghan women's rights defenders are credited with being the first to articulate the concept of gender apartheid in the 1990s, during the Taliban's first regime.\n\nSince the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the hard-line Islamist group has reimposed its oppressive policies against women and girls, including severe restrictions on their appearances, freedom of movement, and right to work and study.\n\nHoda Khamosh, an Afghan women's rights activist, says the recognition of gender apartheid would greatly benefit women's rights in the country.\n\n\"We would be able to hold accountable the authorities and perpetrators of gender-based violence and discrimination against women,\" Khamosh told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian women’s rights activists have said the institutionalized discrimination against women in the Islamic republic amounts to gender apartheid.\n\nUN experts have said the violent enforcement of the hijab law and punishments on women and girls who fail to wear the head scarf could be described as a form of gender apartheid.\n\nWhen Do They Want It?\n\nToday. The United Nations has been considering the adoption of a major treaty that would unite signatories against crimes against humanity.\n\nDozens of rights groups and hundreds of individuals signed a statement in March calling for gender apartheid to be included on the draft list of such crimes.\n\nThe hope is that the UN General Assembly will adopt procedures to begin negotiations on the treaty when it next meets in September.\n\nTough Going\n\nWhile the concept of gender apartheid has increasingly been used by the United Nations and international organizations, particularly in connection with abuses against women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran, there have also been missed opportunities.\n\nDuring UN-hosted talks in Doha with the Taliban in early July, for example, women did not have a seat at the table.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:46 0:00\n\nRights activists calling for the recognition of gender apartheid and for sanctions to be imposed on those responsible accused the UN of giving legitimacy to the Taliban's rule and of betraying its commitment to women's rights.\n\n\"The international community has a moral obligation to ensure the protection of Afghan women’s rights and uphold the principles of justice and equality in any engagement with the Taliban,\" Sima Samar, former chairperson of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), told CIVICUS, a global alliance of civil society organizations.\n\nImprisonment And Death In Iran\n\nLike the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's clerical regime has been labeled a \"gender apartheid regime\" by rights watchdogs.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights activist who lives in exile, is among the key signatories of a global effort to End Gender Apartheid Today.\n\nThe movement, highlighting the international community's successful effort to end apartheid in South Africa decades ago, noted that women in Iran are banned from many fields of study, sporting events, and from obtaining a passport or traveling outside the country without their husband's consent.\n\nThe Iranian authorities' goal is to maintain women's subjugation to men and the state through a system of laws, the movement said. Violations can lead to \"violence, imprisonment, and death.\"\n\n\"The situations in the Islamic Republic of Iran and under the Taliban in Afghanistan are not simply cases of gender discrimination,\" the movement concluded in its call for support.\n\n\"Rather, these systems are perpetuating a more extreme, systematic, and structural war against women designed to dehumanize and repress them for purposes of entrenching power.”\n\nWritten by Michael Scollon with reporting by RFE/RL's Radio Azadi\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met on July 3 in Kazakhstan as part of a two-day summit for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which is poised to admit Belarus as a member.\n\nThe expected expansion of the club of Eurasian countries is part of another push from Beijing and Moscow to use the regional security bloc as a counterweight to promote alternatives to the Western institutions that make up the U.S.-led world order.\n\nPutin told Xi ahead of their bilateral meeting that Russia's ties with China were stronger than ever and touted the SCO as a powerful instrument to advance their foreign policy agendas.\n\n\"Russian-Chinese relations, our comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, are experiencing their best period in history,\" Putin said in comments broadcast on Russian state TV. He hailed the SCO for \"strengthening its role as one of the key pillars of a fair multipolar world order.\"\n\nMoscow and Beijing have deepened their political, military and economic links since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should \"uphold the original aspiration of friendship for generations\" in response to an \"ever-changing international situation.\"\n\nCalling Putin an \"old friend,\" Xi alluded to the progress the two countries had made in putting in place \"plans and arrangements for the next development of bilateral relations.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also met with Putin at the SCO, offering to help end the Ukraine-Russia war. Erdogan said he believed a fair peace suiting both sides was possible, according to the Turkish presidency. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Erdogan could not play the role of an intermediary.\n\n\"No, it's not possible,\" Peskov said when asked whether Erdogan could assume such a role, according to TASS. There was no explanation for why the Kremlin was opposed to Erdogan's participation.\n\nThe SCO summit, which ends of July 4, was also set to focus on better coordination for counterterrorism in the region, which remains high on the agenda for members following Moscow's Crocus City Hall attack in April. The security situation in Afghanistan and a new mechanism for an investment fund proposed by Kazakhstan will also be discussed by leaders.\n\n\"The mandate for the SCO can be quite vague and far-reaching,\" Eva Seiwert, an analyst at the Berlin-based MERICS think tank, told RFE/RL. \"Officially speaking, this is a security organization that focuses on improving collaboration among its member states and building mutual trust throughout the region.\"\n\nThe bloc was founded in 2001 with China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan as members with a focus on settling territorial disputes and has grown to tackle issues like regional security and economic development. The SCO added India and Pakistan in 2017, Iran in 2023, and is set to grow again with the addition of Belarus this year.\n\nThe SCO's evolution over its 23-year history has largely been shaped by China and Russia's evolving relationship.\n\nAt times, Moscow has looked to water down or block Chinese-led plans for the bloc, including proposals for a regional development bank and a free-trade zone. But as Xi and Putin have built stronger ties between their countries in recent years -- especially since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine -- the two leaders have more actively made the SCO a part of their broader cooperation together and a centerpiece of their shared anti-U.S. worldview.\n\n\"For a long time, China wanted to make sure that the SCO is not portrayed as an anti-Western organization, but this has changed, especially since Iran joined,\" Seiwert said. \"It's becoming clear that the SCO doesn't care so much about what the West thinks anymore.\"\n\nAt a meeting of senior Russian officials in June, Putin spoke about the creation of \"a new system of bilateral and multilateral guarantees of collective security in Eurasia,\" with the help of existing organizations like the SCO, to work toward gradually \"phasing out the military presence of external powers in the Eurasian region.\"\n\nTemur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told RFE/RL that while the SCO is increasing its international visibility and geopolitical weight, it still remains an organization that is heavy on symbolism but light on substance.\n\n\"It's still trying to figure out what it is now and what it can be,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, its main advantage is just the sheer size and its collective GDP, but there are still almost no substantial results.\"\n\nIn the absence of a clear mandate, the SCO is largely serving as a diplomatic forum for regional leaders to get sought-after face time with Xi and Putin.\n\nLeaders and representatives from nonmember states like Azerbaijan, Qatar, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkmenistan, and Turkey are also expected to attend, as is United Nation Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nNotably absent from this year's summit is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar attending in his place.\n\nNiva Yau, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, says that India appears to be losing interest in the SCO, in part due to New Delhi's tense rivalry with Pakistan, but also over ongoing tensions with China amid a multiyear border dispute.\n\nShe says that this growing reticence from India may hamstring the bloc's potential and Beijing's future plans for it.\n\n\"It reduces the SCO's global profile and limits some of China's bigger plans,\" she told RFE/RL.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nTwo days of UN-organized talks on international relations with Taliban-led Afghanistan were getting under way in the Qatari capital, Doha, on June 30, with the Taliban present for the first time -- but rights groups expressed anger over the hard-line fundamentalist regime’s exclusion of women and its refusal to discuss women's rights at the forum.\n\n\"The Taliban had a major role in creating the agenda of this meeting and who should be in this meeting,” Shahrazad Akbar, the former head of the Independent Human Rights Commission and currently executive director of the Rawadari rights organization, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi, speaking from Britain.\n\n“This in itself is a big problem and is giving power and legitimacy to the Taliban,\" she said.\n\nHabiba Sarabi, a prominent women’s rights activist and former member of the negotiating team of the deposed Afghan government, echoed those remarks, saying, “Afghan women are half of Afghan society.”\n\n“How can we say that women are not present in important decision-making meetings. When it is specifically related to Afghanistan, women should be present and women should also participate in those decisions,” she told Radio Azadi.\n\nThis is the third such UN-sponsored meeting on Afghanistan in Doha, but the first in which the Taliban has been involved. Along with UN officials, delegations from some two dozen nations, including the United States, are expected to attend.\n\nThe Taliban was not invited to the first Doha conference and set conditions that were rejected for its participation in the second gathering in February, including that it be the sole representative of Afghanistan at the meeting.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres said the group’s demands were “unacceptable” and amounted to recognizing the Taliban as the country’s legitimate government, something the international community has refused to do.\n\nAfghan women’s rights groups and supporters have held protests inside Afghanistan and in Europe over the Taliban’s participation and its exclusion of women at the gathering.\n\nZahid Mustafa, who has organized a protest in Amsterdam, told Radio Azadi that \"our goal by these protests is that the United Nations has invited the Taliban to this meeting on behalf of Afghans. But we are protesting this and calling for a boycott of the Doha meeting.\"\n\nShukriya Barakzai, a women's rights activist and Afghanistan's former ambassador to Norway -- who was invited to the previous meeting -- expressed frustration with the UN organizers of the summit.\n\n\"The United Nations’ looking down upon Afghan women and representatives of civil society shows that, despite the fact that this meeting was organized by the United Nations, they are acting against their own procedures and values,\" she told Radio Azadi from London.\n\nShe did not say if she was invited to the current gathering in Doha.\n\nRoza Otunbaeva, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), has defended the failure to include Afghan women at the meeting, saying that women’s rights are certain to be raised with the Taliban. She said the group's inclusion in the talks does not represent a legitimization of its government.\n\nThe Taliban government, which took over after the U.S.-led international coalition left the country in mid-2020, is not recognized internationally, although Beijing has accepted credentials from a Taliban ambassador.\n\nThe United Nations has accused the Taliban of waging \"gender apartheid\" on women and girls since returning to power nearly three years ago, closing girls' schools and forcing women out of the workplace and out of public spaces.\n\nWomen's rights groups and civil society activists are expected to meet with international diplomats and UN officials on July 2, after the close of the official two-day talks.\n\nBut Sima Samar, the former head of Afghanistan’s human rights commission of the deposed Afghan government, said that was not sufficient action by the international community.\n\n“They [the UN] have said they will meet the [Afghan] women on the sidelines after the end of the meeting on July 2,” she told Radio Azadi.\n\n“If they care about women, why don't they meet with women before that, or why aren't women directly at the table, because the Taliban's desire is to erase women from all social and political issues in Afghanistan.”\n\nWelcome to The Azadi Briefing, an RFE/RL newsletter that unpacks the key issues in Afghanistan. To subscribe, click here.\n\nI'm Abubakar Siddique, senior correspondent at RFE/RL's Radio Azadi. Here's what I've been tracking and what I'm keeping an eye on in the days ahead.\n\nThe Key Issue\n\nA new report by the U.S. State Department says religious freedoms continue to deteriorate under harsh Taliban rule in Afghanistan.\n\nPublished on July 26, the report details the dwindling religious freedoms for both Muslim and non-Muslim religious minorities in the country of 40 million.\n\n\"Fear of violence, persecution, and societal discrimination had prompted members of religious minorities to refrain from publicly expressing their faith,\" the report said.\n\nShi'ite Muslims, the country's largest religious minority, accuse the Sunni Taliban of abuses including \"killing, torture, and forced displacement.\" Most Shi'a in Afghanistan are members of the historically persecuted Hazara ethnic minority.\n\nTaliban's jihadist rival, the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), has targeted Shi'ite communities in devastating terrorist attacks.\n\nThe Taliban, meanwhile, has brutalized Afghanistan's tiny Salafist community for alleged links to IS-K.\n\nOther religious minorities, including \"Christians, Ahmadis, Baha'is, Hindus, and Sikhs,\" have left or are seeking to leave the country out of fear of persecution, according to the report. Those who remain are withdrawing from public expressions of their faith, \"with most in hiding or opting to leave the country.\"\n\nWhile most Afghans are Sunni Muslims who follow the Hanafi school, an estimated 15 percent of its population are Shi'a. Small communities of Hindus, Sikhs, and other non-Muslim religions continue to live in the country.\n\nWhy It's Important: The Taliban's avowed aim to impose its interpretation of Sunni Hanafi jurisprudence has marginalized religious minorities.\n\nIn the absence of a constitution and comprehensive legal framework, decrees by Taliban leaders are vulnerable to individual interpretation, opening new avenues for abuse and denial of rights.\n\nIn practice, this translates into severe and growing restrictions on the practice of any beliefs the Taliban disapproves of.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said the Taliban's policies are \"violating freedom of religion or belief for all Afghans holding a different interpretation of Islam and for members of religious minority groups.\"\n\nThe watchdog recommended extending \"protections for freedom of religion or belief into all potential dialogue with the Taliban.\"\n\nIt argued in favor of targeted sanctions on Taliban leaders responsible for \"severe violations of religious freedom.\"\n\nWhat's Next: Last December, the State Department redesignated the Taliban as an \"entity of particular concern\" owing to grave violations of religious freedoms.\n\nThe hard-line Taliban government is unlikely to shed the designation, as it shows no signs of changing its policies in response to international pressure.\n\nWhat To Keep An Eye On\n\nAfghanistan's historic run in the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup ended with a defeat to South Africa in the semifinal.\n\nHowever, the thrashing the national side suffered on June 27 did not prevent Afghans from celebrating a remarkable sporting achievement.\n\n\"We are proud that our team made it to the semifinals,\" Hashmat Ahmadzai, a resident of the southeastern Khost Province, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi. \"Our team demonstrated that they could defeat anyone.\"\n\nIn the northern province of Parwan, another fan, Ahmad Zahid, said their team gained more support for the sensational sport after defeating leading teams such as Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAfghans adopted cricket while living in exile in neighboring Pakistan. Over the past two decades the Afghan national side made remarkable progress, rising from underdogs to one of the most talented sides in cricket today.\n\nWhy It's Important: The Taliban has so far tolerated cricket as its government stays away from micromanaging the team, which plays under the banner of the fallen republic.\n\nThe game has offered passion, entertainment, and united Afghans at a time when the Taliban's extremist policies deny them fundamental freedoms and rights.\n\nThat's all from me for now.\n\nDon't forget to send me any questions, comments, or tips that you have.

Ukraine dismissed the conditions as absurd and said they amounted to capitulation.\n\nWhen asked about Putin’s remarks, Trump, 78, said the conditions laid out by the Russian leader “are not acceptable.”\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:00 0:00\n\nBut Trump, who voiced a litany of falsehoods during the 90-minute debate, also called Zelenskiy the \"greatest salesman ever\" for the Ukrainian leader’s military aid requests.\n\n\"Look, this is a war that never should have started if we had a leader,\" Trump said, claiming again he would be able to \"settle\" the war if re-elected in November.\n\nHe gave no details of how he would achieve such a result.\n\nThe Kremlin said it had no comment on the debate or the comments made during it.\n\n“I don’t think you expect the president of Russia might set an alarm clock, wake up before morning, and watch the debates in the United States of America?\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow when asked if Putin, who has said previously he has no preference for either candidate, had watched the debate.\n\nConcerns Over Age\n\nBiden’s at times stumbling performance in the debate underscored concerns about his age and whether, at 81, he is too old to serve another four-year term, and prompted questions among some Democrats over whether he should step aside as their party’s nominee.\n\nAt one point, Biden seemed to confuse Trump with Putin; at another point, in a section on immigration and border security, he gave a meandering answer, prompting Trump to counter: \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said.\"\n\nBiden \"did get stronger as the debate went on but by that time, I think the panic had set in,\" David Axelrod, an adviser to former President Barack Obama, said on CNN. \"There are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\"\n\nSpeaking to supporters afterward, Biden appeared much more energetic as he kept up his attacks on Trump.\n\n\"I can't think of one thing he said out there that was true,\" said Biden, whose advisers said was suffering from a cold.\n\nElsewhere in the debate, Trump also slammed Biden for failing to gain the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been in Russian detention for more than a year on espionage charges that he, his employer, and the U.S. government have rejected as politically motivated.\n\nThe former president said Biden should have had Gershkovich, whose trial began on June 26 and is being held behind closed doors, \"out a long time ago\" and that Putin is \"probably asking for billions and billions of dollars\" for the reporter’s release.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:56 0:00\n\nTrump didn’t elaborate or substantiate his assertion, but it appeared to be a reference to a 2023 deal that saw the release of five detained Americans in Iran in exchange for the transfer of billions of dollars worth of frozen Iranian assets from banks in South Korea to Qatar.\n\nWashington has said several times the funds are being held in special accounts with restricted access that allow for them to be used by Iran solely for humanitarian goods, such as medicine and food.\n\nTrump also accused Biden of being responsible for the \"most embarrassing moment in the history of our country\" for the U.S.-led withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\nWhile Trump himself had agreed to the withdrawal of international troops with the Taliban leadership a year before he left office, he did not finalize the plan and it fell to Biden to oversee the operation several years later.\n\nBiden said that when Trump left office after losing the November 2020 election, \"things were in chaos.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak in Virginia later on June 28, while Biden has remained in Atlanta, where the debate took place, and will speak at a campaign event.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nAfghan athletes face formidable hurdles under Taliban rule, particularly women, who are denied the chance to compete or even enter a gym. But when the Olympics open in Paris next month, Afghanistan will be represented by a team that epitomizes equality and global resistance to the Taliban's disregard for women's rights.\n\nAfghanistan will field a six-member Olympic team that will consist of three women and three men, all chosen by the exiled Afghan National Olympic Committee (NOC). The team has the full support of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which believes a gender-balanced team will serve as a positive example to the world.\n\nThe Taliban, which remains internationally isolated and whose unrecognized rule of Afghanistan has been marked by human rights abuses, has no stake in the team or the selection process.\n\nRepresentatives of the Taliban and its authoritative bodies were denied accreditation for the Olympics and will not be represented in any way during the games that open on July 26.\n\nThe hard-line Islamist group's ban on women's sports is part of its raft of infamous restrictions that deprive Afghan women and girls of the opportunity to pursue education, employment, mobility, and deny them any prominent role in government or society.\n\nIn Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, women must be accompanied by a male chaperone even to travel outside their homes, and are barred from competitions or even working out in public gyms.\n\nBut in Paris, the athletes representing Afghanistan will be breaking taboos and restrictions. The team was selected with the goal of showcasing gender equality, and features the same number of women and men.\n\nKimia Yousefi, Afghanistan's fastest woman and soon to be a three-time Olympian, will be looking to best the Afghan national record of 13.29 seconds she set in the 100 meters in Tokyo. She served as the flag-bearer for Afghanistan nearly three years ago in those COVID-delayed games, which wrapped up just days before the Taliban seized power in Kabul in August 2021.\n\nYousefi will be joined by the Hashemi sisters, Fariba and her older sibling Yulduz, road cyclists who are on track to be the first-ever -- male or female -- to represent Afghanistan in cycling at the Olympics.\n\nSwimmer Fahim Anwari is among those who will be competing for Afghanistan under the anthem as well as the black, red, and green flag of the former Afghan republic ousted by the Taliban.\n\nThe tumultuous political changes in the Olympian's homeland since he represented Afghanistan in Tokyo have upturned his life and those of his compatriots.\n\nLimited Resources\n\nAfter the Taliban’s seizure of power, Anwari fled to Germany, where he has trained with limited resources and continues to represent Afghanistan in international swimming competitions.\n\n“Problems and challenges in exile severely disrupted my practice,” he told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi. “But I am doing my best to pursue my goals.”\n\nAfghanistan's fastest man, sprinter Shah Mahmud Noorzai, will be competing in the 100 meters.\n\n“I have trained well for the Paris games,” Noorzai, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nNoorzai fled to neighboring Iran after the Taliban rolled into Kabul. With the help of the IOC, he trained with Iranian athletes.\n\nNoorzai said he is looking forward to beating the national record he set in Tokyo in the 100 meters, which he ran in 10.23 seconds.\n\n“I am proud to be the fastest man in Afghanistan,” he said. “To be the fastest man in Afghanistan’s history.”\n\nYunas Popalzai, the exiled secretary-general of the Afghan NOC, told Radio Azadi that in addition to Noorzai and Anwari, the judoka Mohmmad Samim will represent Afghanistan.\n\nAkhtari said five of the Team Afghanistan athletes were based outside their home country.\n\n“As all women’s sports are suspended in Afghanistan, [the female athletes] who were put forward were not introduced from inside the country,” he told the AFP news agency this month.\n\nOnly Samim is believed to be based in Afghanistan itself.\n\nThe objective from the beginning was to choose a balanced team of men and women to represent Afghanistan.\n\n“We made it clear we wanted a gender-equal team,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said earlier this month. “That was the demand, and that is what we achieved.”\n\n“The clear idea is we want to get Afghan athletes and a gender-based team in Paris,” he said. “Because of the demonstration that it gives to the world, at home in Afghanistan, and also to the rest of the world.”\n\nThe IOC provides material and financial support for the Afghan athletes competing in the biggest global sports competition.\n\nAdams stressed that the IOC is not allowing Taliban officials to participate in the Olympics and only recognizes the NOC's right to represent Afghan athletes.\n\n\"There will be no place for Afghan authorities, the Taliban,\" Adams said. \"No representative of the de facto authorities, the Taliban government, will be accredited.\"\n\nAt least three Afghan men and two women will also compete for the IOC's Refugee Olympic Team, which represents 100 million forcibly displaced people worldwide.\n\nManizha Talash, a breakdancer who was born in Kabul, discovered the sport on social media, and now lives in Spain, is among those who will compete with the 36-member team.\n\nThe Refugee Olympic Team will be led in Paris by Masomah Ali Zada, an Afghan road cyclist who competed for the Refugee Olympic Team in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nNigara Shaheen, a judoka in the 70-kilogram category, grew up as an Afghan refugee in Pakistan and practiced martial arts as a family tradition. She has lived and trained in Canada since 2022 and was also named on the Refugee Olympic Team.\n\nThree male Afghans will be on the Refugee Olympic Team-- Amir Ansari in road cycling, Arab Sibghatullah in judo, and Farzad Mansouri in taekwondo.\n\nAfghanistan first participated in the Olympics in 1936, but has only won two medals.\n\nRohullah Nikpah won men’s taekwondo medals at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and in the 2012 games in London.\n\nWritten by Abubakar Siddique based on reporting by Radio Azadi correspondent Faiza Ibrahimi.\n\nShahabuddin had a brush with death when floods ripped through his community and washed away his home in northern Afghanistan.\n\nHaving survived one near-death experience, Shahabuddin soon encountered another foe: disease.\n\n“Within 24 hours, I was so weak that I could barely walk,” the father of four, who lives in the province of Baghlan, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nShahabuddin is among the nearly 47,000 Afghans who have contracted cholera so far this year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nA highly infectious bacterial disease, cholera spreads through contaminated food and water and results in acute diarrhea, fever, and dehydration. If untreated, it can lead to death.\n\nAt least 25 people have died of the disease so far in 2024 in Afghanistan, which has the highest number of cases in the world, according to a WHO report released on June 19.\n\nExperts said a series of natural disasters, including floods that devastated swaths of northern and central Afghanistan in the spring and the country’s crumbling health-care system, are behind the sharp rise in cases.\n\n'No Access To Clean Water'\n\nSharafat Zaman Amar, a spokesman for the Taliban’s Ministry of Health, said Afghanistan “does not have any confirmed” cases of cholera.\n\nBut Faridullah Omari, a physician at the National Infectious Disease Hospital in Kabul, said each day the hospital receives up to 80 patients who are suffering from water-borne diseases like cholera.\n\nHe suggested the cholera outbreak has been fueled by lack of hygiene and more people drinking unsafe water.\n\nCommunities affected by the recent floods, which killed hundreds and impacted tens of thousands of people, said the deluges destroyed much of the water supply and infrastructure in the region. They also said there was a severe shortage of medicines available to treat infectious diseases like cholera.\n\n\"People don't have access to clean water,” said Sharifullah, a resident of the northern province of Sar-e Pol, which was hit by floods.\n\n“All the water is muddy from the floods,” he told Radio Azadi. “But people use this [dirty] water, and they don't have the means to clean it. So people, especially children, are suffering from diarrhea.”\n\nKhodayaqal, a resident of Baghlan, said they have little access to health-care facilities after the mobile clinics deployed by aid agencies and the Taliban government in the aftermath of the floods left.\n\n“Our children are battling with diseases,” he told Radio Azadi. “We have one clinic here, but it doesn’t have any medicine.”\n\nIn its report, the WHO said diminishing stocks of cholera vaccines, as well as population growth, natural disasters, and climate change, have led to cholera outbreaks.\n\nThe public health-care system in Afghanistan, which was largely funded by foreign aid for nearly two decades, has been in free-fall since the Taliban takeover in 2021. The militants’ seizure of power led international donors to immediately cut financial funding.\n\nHundreds of health facilities have been closed in the past three years, with no funds to pay the salaries of doctors and nurses. Hospitals that are still open suffer from severe shortages of medicine.\n\nWhile some foreign aid organizations continue to operate in Afghanistan, many of them have been forced to curb their work as international funding diminishes."
