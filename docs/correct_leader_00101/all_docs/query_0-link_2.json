Nico was previously Chief of Staff at the Federal Ministry of Defence of Germany from 2019 to 2022, under Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. He brings vast experience from the top echelons of German politics, holding numerous senior positions in the German CDU party. Nico served as director of the Ukraine office of Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung in Kyiv from 2006-2012 and was awarded a Robert Bosch Fellowship in St. Petersburg, Russia from 2003-2006. He is a fluent Ukrainian and Russian speaker and adds to Rasmussen Global’s growing reputation as the go-to consultancy on all issues regarding Ukraine.\n\nIn Brussels, Helene Bille Albrechtsen has joined as a project manager focused on critical raw materials and energy. Having most recently served in the Cabinet of European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, as well as having worked four years with trade in the Danish Ministry of Business, Helene is an expert on the European regulatory landscape and its strategic agenda.
