        "text": "Anders Fogh Rasmussen served as NATO’s Secretary General for five years. One of Europe’s most respected politicians he has been a key actor in European politics for three decades. Prior to leading the military and political alliance he served as both Prime Minster and Economics Minister in his native Denmark.\n\nAfter completing his Masters in economics Anders entered the Danish parliament where he served in both cabinet and shadow cabinet positions. As Minister of Economics Affairs in the Conservative-Liberal coalition government he was a key member of the EU’s economic council and was part of the Maastricht Treaty negotiating team.\n\nAs leader of the Liberal Party he was Prime Minister in another Liberal-Conservative coalition and he went on to win two subsequent general elections before his nomination to lead NATO. As Prime Minster he dealt with a number of controversial national issues including limits on immigration, tax cuts, the war in Iraq, local government reorganisation, as well as many EU matters.\n\nAnders was NATO’s Secretary General for a period which spanned wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Arab Spring uprisings. There were also a range of diplomatic issues including Russia’s increased hostility to the organisation and the post-financial crisis pressure on member states’ defence spending. He also led fundamental changes to the alliance establishing new strategic plans and priorities for the long-term.\n\nA leading voice in calling for greater multinational cooperation, Anders is noted not just as a vastly experienced politician, but one of rare clarity and insight. Now a foreign policy advisor to governments and institutions, he takes a broad look at the world, offering his insider’s perspective on politics from Brexit, Trump and populism to security, conflict and America and Europe’s roles in global affairs, the former being the subject of his book, The Will to Lead: America's Indispensable Role in the Global Fight for Freedom."
