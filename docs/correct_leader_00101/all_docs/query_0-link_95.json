        "text": "As a non-Dane with some expertise in such disciplines as transport and sociology, I enjoyed Danish\n\nhospitality for nearly four years.\n\nI was extremely pleased with the professional possibilities that a generous PhD grant had offered me, and which allowed me to teach at Copenhagen University. I had an outstanding time at the Danish Transport Council and the Department of Sociology at the University of Copenhagen, where other awkward experts – most of them “red” – have given me an insight into their original thinking. I have made fantastic acquaintances in the bars of Vesterbro and Noerrebro and I have found wonderful friends in all of these places.\n\nNow I lead a jolly good life in Brussels, where both experts and non-Danes are plentiful. A life, though, that bears less stunning surprises and puzzlement than in Denmark during the de facto political cleansing at the beginning of this year.\n\nI myself was kindly but firmly asked to take my expertise and leave the Danish Transport Research Institute earlier this year. What next? Will Rasmussen fire Catholic researchers because most of his government is Protestant? How about Muslims? Gays?\n\nWhat terrible experiences did Rasmussen have that he bashes his intellectual reserve army in such a way?\n\nJoerg Beckmann"
