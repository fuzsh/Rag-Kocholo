Mena Suvari married long-term partner Simone Sestito in Italy on Saturday

Congratulations to Mena Suvari who married her partner of three years, concert producer Simone Sestino, in Italy's Vatican City over the weekend!

Talking to Us Weekly, a guest blabbed:

"The ceremony was truly unique and Mena looked breathtaking. They are very much in love."

The newlyweds met at the Toronto Film Festival in 2007 and got engaged just a year later, choosing Italy as the location because 35-year-old Simone's family hail from the country.

Talking to People magazine two years ago, Simone said of Mena:

"We just understood each other. She's very caring and understanding. There was a connection."

Aw... The 31-year-old actress's next film is called You May Not Kiss The Bride, but we doubt anyone was saying that to her new husband over the weekend...
