"The ceremony was truly unique and Mena looked breathtaking," a guest told People magazine. "They are very much in love."

The ceremony was followed by a private reception for the couple outside of the city.

Suvari and Sestito met at the Toronto Film Festival in 2007. According to the report, they chose to marry in Rome because most of Sestito's family lives nearby.
