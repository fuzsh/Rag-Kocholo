Mena Suvari wed music producer Simone Sestito in Vatican City on Saturday in a “very romantic and traditional Italian” wedding with a few hundred guests.

It’s the second marriage for the American Beauty star, who wed cinematographer Robert Brinkman, 17 years her senior, in 2000 before splitting in 2005.

Walking down the aisle, Suvari wore a gown by good friend Stacey Bendet, owner of Alice + Olivia. She had been engaged to Simone Sestito since 2008.

“He got down his knees,” Suvari said last fall. “It was very romantic. I love him. It’s all about family and culture. I love his family and it just inspires me.”

Sestito is just as smitten. “The thing I love most about her is the understanding,” he said. “We get each other alot, so there’s a good connection there.”

Sounds like it. Congratulations, kids!

Mena Suvari is now Mrs. Simone Sestito!
