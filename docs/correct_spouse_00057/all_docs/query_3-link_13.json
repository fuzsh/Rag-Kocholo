        "text": "More people celebrate their weddings in June than any other month of the year. Yet that doesn't mean the marriages will last — especially in Hollywood. Wonderwall.com is taking a look back at celebrities' doomed June unions, starting with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. After less than a year of dating, the \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice star\" married the \"Peppermint\" actress — who was pregnant with daughter Violet at the time — on a beach in Turks and Caicos on June 29, 2005. But after a decade of marriage and two more kids, the couple (seen here just 18 months after their wedding) called it quits with a heartbreaking divorce announcement on June 30, 2015, following weeks of speculation about their crumbling relationship.

After more than a decade together, the pair — who are parents to daughter Coco Arquette — confirmed their separation in 2010 and finalized their divorce in 2013. \"We were married for a long time, so it's not like we didn't try,\" Courteney told More magazine. \"When you love someone, you want them to be happy, even if it's not with you.\"\n\nRELATED: Celebrity engagement rings revealed\n\nAfter less than a month of dating, Julia Roberts married offbeat country singer Lyle Lovett wearing a white off-the-rack Commes des Garçons dress on June 27, 1993, at St. James Lutheran Church in rural Marion, Indiana, with her friend Susan Sarandon serving as one of her five attendants. But just 21 months later, the unusual couple's union was over.\n\nRELATED: Unusual couples that didn't last\n\nAfter spending a few years as one of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's girlfriends, reality TV star Kendra Wilkinson moved on with NFL player Hank Baskett and they got engaged in 2008. The married at the Playboy Mansion on June 27, 2009, and welcomed two kids, Hank IV in 2009 and Alijah in 2014. But around the same time as their daughter's arrival, Hank found himself at the center of a cheating scandal with a transgender model. He and Kendra worked through it, but ultimately, they couldn't keep going. Kendra filed for divorce in April 2018.\n\nAfter meeting on her 21st birthday, Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe fell in love, co-starred in \"Cruel Intentions\" and married near Charleston, South Carolina, on June 5, 1999, while she was pregnant with daughter Ava Phillippe. But by 2006, they'd separated, and their divorce was finalized the following year. \"I think more of the problem was age,\" Ryan told \"Larry King Now\" of why it didn't work. \"When we got together we were so young. I think it can create issues with two people in this industry because there's so much noise that goes along with it.\"\n\nPaul McCartney was full of joy when he married Heather Mills — a model-turned-anti-land mine activist, Paralympic skier and \"Dancing With the Stars\" contestant — in Ireland on June 11, 2002. The couple welcomed daughter Beatrice McCartney the following year but separated in 2006. Their ensuing divorce battle was contentious and epic, with Heather demanding a huge amount of money and perks. In the end, a British judge awarded her a $48.6 million settlement in 2008, far less than she'd asked for. When Paul was later asked if marrying Heather was one of his worst decisions in recent years, he told Q magazine, \"I suppose that has to be the prime contender. But I don't want to down anyone. I tend to look at the positive side, which is that I have another beautiful daughter out of it.\"\n\nRapper Eminem and high school sweetheart Kim Scott — who's not only the mother of his beloved daughter Hailie Mathers but the subject of his violent, controversial songs \"Kim\" and \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" — have married (and divorced) two times. Their first wedding took place on June 14, 1999. They divorced in 2001 but later reconciled and wed again in January 2006 — only to split less than three months later.\n\nClad in a princess-style Vera Wang gown, pop diva Mariah Carey married the head of her record label, Tommy Mottola, in a lavish ceremony in New York City on June 5, 1993. But they soon began to clash over both the creative direction of her music as well as Tommy's controlling nature. \"The problem was that I was the chairman of Sony and her husband at the same time. She grew resentful,\" Tommy wrote in his autobiography \"Hitmaker: The Man and His Music.\" \"Things got more difficult and tense by the day.\" They finally divorced in 1998.\n\nOn the heels of her devastating split from Ben Affleck — they were the original \"Bennifer\" — Jennifer Lopez renewed her relationship with an old ex-boyfriend, salsa star Marc Anthony, and made him husband No. 3 on June 5, 2004. The couple (seen here at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' wedding in 2006) soon became parents to twins but separated in 2011. Their divorce was finalized three years later in 2014. \"Sometimes it doesn't work — and that's sad,\" J.Lo told Vanity Fair. \"But I remain an eternal optimist about love. I believe in love.\"\n\nDenise Richards and notorious Hollywood bad boy Charlie Sheen were desperately in love when they tied the knot on June 15, 2002.

Then Charlie — whose troubled behavior and wild romances are the stuff of legend — began to spiral, and Denise filed for divorce while pregnant with daughter No. 2 in 2005.\n\nIt seemed like Drew Barrymore finally found her Prince Charming when she began dating art consultant Will Kopelman in 2011. The couple married on June 2, 2012, and welcomed two daughters, Olive and Frankie, in 2012 and 2014. But the marriage eventually turned sour and the pair divorced in 2016, though they continue to amicably co-parent and support each other.\n\n\"Quantum of Solace\" actress Gemma Arterton married Stefano Catelli at a Moorish castle in Andalucia, Spain, on June 5, 2010. But less than three years later, the British Bond girl and the Italian stuntman called it quits. \"It was a wonderful time and I have nothing bad to say about it,\" she told Marie Claire UK. \"Even if they don't last, relationships can enrich your life in some way and then you move on to the next part — it's all part of the process of living.\"\n\nNatalie Maines met actor Adrian Pasdar in May 1999 at a wedding and the twosome immediately hit it off. They married on June 24, 2000, at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas and welcomed two sons, Jackson and Beckett. They had a great run, but it wasn't meant to last: Natalie filed for divorce in July 2017 after 17 years of marriage.\n\nRadio legend and \"America's Got Talent\" judge Howard Stern might be married to host and animal lover Beth Ostrosky Stern these days, but the former model was not the first Mrs. Stern: Howard wed college sweetheart Alison Berns on June 4, 1978, and together they raised three daughters. Howard credits Alison with helping him forge his successful radio career and supporting him despite the controversy he whipped up for decades — he sung her praises in his best-selling 1993 book \"Private Parts\" — but ultimately, the King of All Media and his queen didn't go the distance. They separated in 1999 after more than two decades of marriage, and their divorce was finalized in 2001.\n\nFormer child star Macaulay Culkin married another child performer, Broadway actress Rachel Miner, on June 21, 1998, when they were both just 17.

They married in her hometown of Dallas on June 9, 2001, and welcomed three daughters together. Angie wanted to raise their girls away from the glare of Hollywood so the family settled down in North Carolina, from which Angie made the grueling commute to Hollywood to film her TNT show \"Rizzoli & Isles\" while Jason stayed home with the girls. The strain of all that time apart contributed to problems, and in November 2014, the couple announced they were splitting after 13 years of marriage.\n\nThree days after her divorce from Sonny Bono was finalized, Cher married Southern rocker Gregg Allman on June 30, 1975. Nine days later, she filed for divorce. They reconciled, then he filed for divorce — only to call it off when Cher became pregnant with their son, Elijah Blue Allman. After recording the weird and disappointing album \"Two the Hard Way\" together, the musicians split for good in 1977.\n\nKiefer Sutherland married wife No. 2, former model Kelly Winn, on June 29, 1996, and became a stepfather to her two boys from a previous marriage.

Kiefer publicly accepted the blame for the demise of the marriage, explaining to \"Entertainment Tonight\" that \"I got more involved in my life than ours.\"\n\nCasey Affleck began dating Summer Phoenix in the mid-1990s after they were introduced by her brother, Joaquin Phoenix. The pair got engaged in 2004 and married on June 3, 2006. Sadly, their love didn't last and the couple separated in 2015 after welcoming two sons. Summer officially filed for divorce in August 2017.\n\nTheir relationship has been fraught with drama from the beginning: After Rosie O'Donnell and former executive search consultant Michelle Rounds met and fell in love in 2011, they postponed wedding plans while Michelle battled rare desmoid tumors. Then, two months after their June 9, 2012, nuptials, Rosie suffered a heart attack. They adopted a daughter, Dakota O'Donnell, in January 2013, but their happiness was to be short-lived: Rosie filed for divorce in February 2015, and a contentious custody battle ensued, with Michelle seeking full custody of their little girl following her allegations that Rosie drinks to excess and gets high, something the talk show host denied. Michelle committed suicide in 2017.\n\nWhite Stripes rocker Jack White married model and singer Karen Elson in the rainforests of Manaus, Brazil, on June 1, 2005, \"on the confluence of three rivers — the Rio Negro, the Solimones and the Amazon,\" read the announcement on his band's web site, which also stated that the nuptials were officiated \"by a traditional shaman priest on a canoe at the exact point where the three rivers met.\" The couple welcomed two children together but split in 2011. A contentious divorce battle followed. It was finalized in 2013 and things are now more civil. \"It's not like splitting up with a boyfriend in your 20s. You are breaking up with a whole life,\" Karen told Harper's Bazaar. \"It's not an easy process. But you've got to be friends, there is no choice. I am the product of a divorced family so I felt a responsibility to make that happen.\"\n\nMel Gibson married Robyn Moore on June 7, 1980, and together they had seven children. They separated in July 2006 after 26 years of marriage following Mel's infamous DUI arrest. Robyn filed for divorce in 2009 and two years later, it was finally over, with Robyn reportedly getting half of Mel's estimated $850 million fortune.\n\nJack Nicholson is one of Hollywood's most notorious ladies' men, but one woman got him to walk down the aisle: actress Sandra Knight. The couple — who co-starred in 1963's \"The Terror\" — married on June 16, 1962, and welcomed a daughter, designer Jennifer Nicholson, a year later. But by 1968, it was over for Jack and Sandra, and he returned to his womanizing ways.\n\nJill Scott thought she had found \"The One\" when she married longtime boyfriend Mike Dobson on June 25, 2016. The relationship wasn't smooth sailing, however, and the singer filed for divorce in 2017 after only 15 months of marriage. In 2018, a judge ruled in Jill's favor to enforce their prenup following months of legal battles.\n\nAfter seven years of dating, \"American Pie\" actress Shannon Elizabeth married actor and professional poker player Joseph D. Reitman on a beach near Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on June 15, 2002. But three years later, it was over for the pair, who'd co-founded the nonprofit animal rescue organization Animal Avengers together, with Shannon filing for divorce in the summer of 2005.\n\nAnother \"American Pie\" actress, Mena Suvari, was also a June bride: Mena married Italian concert producer Simone Sestito on June 26, 2010, at an eighth-century church in Vatican City before heading to Castello Odescalchi (the same 15th-century castle where Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes got hitched) for their reception. Despite the epic nuptials, the marriage didn't last: Mena filed for divorce less than two year later in January 2012.\n\nNo one really even knew that actor Giovanni Ribisi and British model Agyness Deyn were dating, let alone super-serious, when news emerged that they'd quietly eloped on June 16, 2012. Their split was equally low-key: He filed for divorce two and a half years later in January 2015.\n\nEmilie de Ravin and actor Josh Janowicz's relationship is almost as confusing as the plotlines on her old show \"Lost.\" See if you can follow this: Court documents show they secretly married on June 19, 2003, but as far as the public knew, they tied the knot in her native Australia on June 26, 2006 (five months after this photo was taken). They separated six months after that 2006 ceremony but later reconciled — only to split again in 2009. They patched things up that time too, but in July 2014, Emilie filed for divorce (which revealed their true wedding date) — finally marking the end of a tumultuous romance.\n\nAfter more than three years of dating, \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian Chris Kattan married model Sunshine Tutt in Yosemite Valley, California, on June 28, 2008. But just eight weeks later, the marriage was over, and the pair's divorce became final in early 2009."
