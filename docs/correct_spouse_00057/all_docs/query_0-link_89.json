        "text": "Surprise! Actress Mena Suvari — who you probably recognize from the American Pie franchise — confirmed to In Touch magazine that she secretly tied the knot. Back in August, the 39-year-old seemingly hinted she found her forever man on Instagram, but it’s only now that she’s finally speaking out.\n\n“I’m very happy. Very happy. Yeah,” the newlywed revealed while flashing her giant sparkler at the Last Chance for Animals’ Annual Celebrity Benefit in Beverly Hills on Saturday. “Third time’s a charm!” she joked.\n\nMena even opened up about the details of their wedding, which sounded like it was straight out of a fairytale. “It was very intimate. It was very beautiful. I had my closest friends with me. It was very meaningful. After all these years, having ups and downs, it’s very nice just being settled, especially at this point in my life.”\n\nWhile fans may not know much about her new man — except that they met on the set of the Hallmark movie, I’ll Be Home for Christmas — Mena promised, he’s “just like cool, considerate, old-fashioned! I’m like, who are you?!” she gushed. “He’s got the beard you know what I mean? Like the whole lumberjack thing going on… I found myself a Canadian!”\n\nAs for motherhood? “Maybe,” she said. “I have a few years left! We’ll see.”\n\nPrior to meeting Michael, the American Horror Story star was married to cinematographer Robert Brinkmann from 2000 to 2005 and then to concert promoter Simone Sestito from 2010 to 2012.\n\nFollowing her divorce from Simone, she told the Boston Common, “It’s taken years to get to know myself. I had never really taken time to cultivate who I was. I’ve felt drained by it. But I feel like I’m really, finally, content at this point in my life. I’m accepting of who I am and how diverse I am and honoring that. All of it.” Regarding rumors that her fame affected her relationship with her now ex-husband, she said, “I don’t let that affect my personal relationships. I’m very Aquarius that way.”"
