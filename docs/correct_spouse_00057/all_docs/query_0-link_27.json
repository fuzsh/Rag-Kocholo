        "text": "Mena Suvari and Simone Sestito are throwing in the towel.\n\nAn attorney for the actress, 32, filed divorce papers on her behalf on Friday in L.A. County Superior Court. She and Sestito, a concert promoter, have no kids.\n\nAccording to court papers, Suvari cited “irreconcilable differences” and asked that Sestito receive no spousal support. She cited a separation date of 11/1/11.\n\nMena Suvari and Simone Sestito married in June 2010 in Italy, holding a private church in the Vatican City in what the pair called a “romantic” wedding.\n\nThe couple met at the Toronto Film Festival in 2007 and got engaged in 2008. This will be Suvari’s second divorce; she split from Robert Brinkmann, in 2005.\n\nMena is set to reprise her role in the next American Pie film installment, due out later this year. If you haven’t seen it, here’s the American Reunion trailer.\n\n[Photo: WENN.com]"
