        "text": "This Sunday’s New York Times Style section featured a piece on the possibilities of reincarnation. One interviewee, Peter Bostock, uses his belief in past lives to explain the incredible passionate connection he feels with is wife. According to Mr. Bostock, he and his wife share the sort “of attraction and recognition that a soul makes when it encounters the familiar.” As famed neurologist Oliver Sacks says, “recognition is based on knowledge and familiarity is based on feeling.” The brain offers invaluable clues that help explain our subconscious desires. The photo of Mr. Bostock and his wife demonstrate how similar they are to one another. The cause for their intense connection is the chemistry ignited by their facial feature compatibility. Current neuro-science has illuminated the many ways in which our visual perception is manifest as a neurological function.\n\nThe numerous physiological aspects of vision are the focus of a tremendous amount of ongoing research in numerous fields. What we currently know is that there are types of visual information, which are not consciously perceived but are still conveyed and processed. Hence, we interpret stimuli in ways that are not always obvious to us. Most of us don’t know that the people to whom we are most physically attracted have facial features similar to our own because those visuals cues get translated in the unconscious regions of our brain. The eye takes an image but it is the brain that makes sense of it. The optic nerve transmits the received visuals to the cerebral cortex where nerve cells communicate with one another. One particularly pertinent and fascinating discovery was the confirmation of a special face recognition feature in the brain that responds selectively to faces. It’s been proven that faces are unlike all other stimuli; research indicates that by two months old, babies are responding to faces and interacting with others based on exchanged facial expressions. Proof of the unique primacy of the face is also evident because facial perception uses a separate pathway in the brain located at the bottom of the temporal lobe.\n\nOnce that intense connection is established, that’s when desire kicks in. And we thought passion was simple.\n\nBelow are photos of Mena Suvari and husband Simone Sestito, Paul Volker and Anke Dening, Batchelorette Ali Fedotowsky and fiance Roberto Martinez, and HRHs Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden.\n\nAs if finding love were not a hard enough hurdle, society often puts further obstacles in our way. The road to sustainable love is often difficult to navigate and hard to traverse. But it is amazing to see the lengths to which people go to secure that most precious of gifts; the magical combination of abiding love and potent passion. The sacrifices and risks people take, even the losses they sustain, are testament to the power of connection. The things that divide people, some imaginary and some very tangible, can often be overcome when the chemistry is so powerful. There are a host of barriers that the most intrepid lovers can bypass in order to meet their coveted mate on the other side.\n\nOne such barrier is the prison wall. Despite their criminal convictions, many incarcerated men and women still fall madly in love. But to fall in love with someone who is already serving time, particularly an extended sentence, poses serious and unique challenges. I strongly believe that where similar facial features exist, people are willing to go to extreme lengths to ensure that they connect to their facial match. Even inmates and their partners find deep and passionate love in spite of the time and space that threatens to keep them physically apart for many years.\n\nOne woman who married her lover after he was convicted of murder claimed that the potency of their connection was a power greater than them. She asserted the strength of fate in uniting them and keeping them together, despite their circumstances. But, in my view, it was not fate. People tend to believe it is fate but it is actually science at work. The primal urge to be with that familiar face is what generates the strong chemistry that feels like fate and makes people willing to risk everything for that profound feeling.\n\n(http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/prison-wives/)\n\nThen there is the extraordinary story of Michael and Carole Santos, pictured below. Read what Carole has written about their connection and determination to have a life together despite Michael’s prison sentence. And look at their faces.\n\n“I was 38-years-old when I fell in love with Michael Santos. My friends and family thought I’d gone crazy. People could not fathom how I could uproot my life to pursue a romance with a prisoner. But I knew I was leaving behind all the craziness that had consumed my life. I found this incredible treasure I had dreamed of, but never believed was possible, yet I had known him all my life. Michael had been in prison for more than 15 years and he expected to serve another ten years when our romance began. During that time, against unimaginable obstacles, he had earned an undergraduate degree from Mercer University and a graduate degree from Hofstra University, and he had just finished initial drafts of his first two book….\n\nMichael and I worked together to create a plan that would allow me to relocate with every administrative transfer his prison sentence brought. At the same time, we needed to create the financial stability that would help him transition into society after nearly 25 years in prison. With his complete support, encouragement, and blessings, I returned to college to pursue nursing. With a nursing degree, I knew that I could find employment in an honorable profession wherever my husband was confined. That prospect encouraged us. With two years of prerequisites to complete before I could begin nursing school, I invested several years in my education.” (From MichaelSantos.net)\n\nAge is another socially created boundary that often needs to be crossed. But when two people share similar facial features, it often does not matter, to them anyway, how many years separate them. They know that they have something rare and special and they will stop at nothing to realize it. Look at these photos of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.\n\nThe Discovery Channel recently aired The Science of Sex Appeal, an exploration of the various ways in which human physical attraction is informed and enforced by biological and neurological processes. One area of ongoing research involves the importance of scent in mate selection. My theory of shared facial features being a significant, albeit often subconscious, factor in determining chemistry and compatibility is nuanced by scientific data about our sense of smell. It would be an evolutionary disaster if similar facial features were not mitigated somehow in order to prevent members of the same family from finding one another sexually attractive and/or physically desirable. Considering how strong the chemistry can be between those who have comparable features, we must be very grateful that the nose often knows. People are usually somewhat repelled by the bodily odors of members of their immediate families. This crucial aversion helps prevent incest. Family members who share DNA, often share similar body odors and evolution demands that we seek sexual partners outside of our immediate smell orbit on order to perpetuate the species and not sabotage the gene pool by inbreeding. Genetics insist on diversified access to an array of healthy DNA in order to ensure greater immunity and reproductive success.\n\nThis incest aversion protection is hard wired, but it is also subtle and subconscious. Since the homo sapien left the savanna, the demise of hunter/gatherer societies and the dawn of the agricultural revolution, humans have relied less and less on the power of their sense of smell. In addition, we often mask our true scents with perfumes, deodorants and colognes. But that does not stop the one sense that is directly hard wired to our brains from kicking in to protect us in circumstances where the power of similar features exist; but nature demands caution before desire can tamper with the complex fabric of specie survival.\n\nAs Diane Ackerman so aptly puts it in A Natural History of the Senses, “We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die.” This clearly demonstrates that the important and vital visual component which so informs sexual desire and fuels continued chemistry is slightly subordinate to our sense of smell, which according to several scientific studies, offers clues and guidance even when we don’t know it.\n\nA critical unit of investigation that illustrates the importance of scent and the pivotal role of the nose in creating or thwarting desire is the pheromone. Pheromones are chemical secretions emitted by most animals, including humans, designed to trigger certain responses in members of the same species. Human behavior is less controlled by smell than many other mammals but it still provides invaluable clues and offers important social and sexual information in the form of pheromones. We needn’t be aware of these chemical messages to be influenced by them and, hence, responsive to them.\n\nThe profound chemistry often generated when two people share similar facial features is further demonstrated by the hard-wired protection offered to steer us away from extinction. A person’s odor is as individual as their fingerprint but we are fortunate that our sensory and neurological impulses combine to narrow the scope of potential mates and make the ‘game of love’ and the ‘science of sex appeal’ serve not only our romantic urges but also our longevity.\n\nHere’s the link to The Science of Sex Appeal:\n\nHYPERLINK “http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/science-of-sex-appeal-incest-avoidance-odor.html&#8221;http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/science-of-sex-appeal-incest-avoidance-odor.html\n\nTwins in the UK, a brother and sister who were separated at birth and adopted by different families, fell in love and were married in 2008. The aversion to one another’s scent did not kick in for a variety of reasons, such as those mentioned above, scent masking, reduced scent sensitivity, potential blocked neuro-pathways, etc. I believe that this brother and sister fell in love because they have similar facial features. Once they discovered that they were biologically related, they separated.\n\nHere are some female celebrities whose partner bears a striking resemblance to one of her parents. I think this is because the daughter looks like her parent, too. You be the judge!\n\nMarcheline Bertrand and Jon Voight, left, strongly resemble Brad Pitt and their daughter Angelina Jolie, right.\n\nBruce Paltrow, left, and Chris Martin with Gwenyth Paltrow, right.\n\nBrittany Murphy, her mother and husband."
