        "text": "Everyone wants a piece of the pie... Mena Suvari's soon-to-be ex-husband, Simone Sestito, wants the actress to hand over a whopping $17,000 per month in spousal support as part of their divorce.\n\nAccording to court documents filed this week — and obtained by TMZ — Sestito claims he has \"negative balances\" on all his personal and business accounts and has been forced to pay his bills with credit cards and loans from his parents.\n\nSestito claims he got used to eating out \"almost everyday at high end restaurants\" and lists his estimated monthly eating out expense as $3,000 per month. He is seeking $17,151 per month in spousal support from Suvari (who he claims earns $750,000 annually), plus an additional $10,000 for attorney fees.\n\nSuvari's lawyer, Mark Gross, says, \"It is unfortunate that Simone has chosen the spotlight of litigation over the privacy of mediation.\"\n\nSuvari began dating Sestito in 2007, marrying on June 26, 2010. The actress filed for divorce on January 13, 2012. She was previously married to cinematographer Robert Brinkmann from March 2004 to May 2005.\n\nPhoto: © www.splashnews.com\n\nLast On Vogue"
