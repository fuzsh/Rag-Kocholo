        "text": "Mena Suvari, who recently split from concert promoter hubby Simone Sestito, has compared her marriage breakdown to tending troublesome weeds in her garden.\n\nThe ‘American Beauty’ star filed for divorce from Sestito in January, just 18 months after their marriage.u00a0The split marked the actress’ second failed marriage, following the end of her five-year union with cinematographer Robert Brinkmann in 2005, but she has brushed off her chequered relationship history.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“There are many reasons why things don’t work out, and I think at some point you have to acknowledge that and work towards maintaining your own happiness,” the Daily Express quoted Suvari as telling You magazine.\n\n“You have to surround yourself with people who love you and want the best for you. I call this process weeding my garden.\n\n“A year or so ago I went through all the people in my life and asked myself: does this person inspire me, genuinely love me and support me unconditionally? I wanted nothing but positive influences in my life,” she said."
