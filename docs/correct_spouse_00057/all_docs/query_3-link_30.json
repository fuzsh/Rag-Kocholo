        "text": "(Rare) Honest Reporting from Fox News\n\nFox News Shepard Smith vs Trump\n\nPresident Trump called NFL player who have kneeled in protest of the national anthemin\n\n'SON OF A BITCH'.\n\nSamples of NFL players respond:\n\nChris Baker (Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle): So the BLACK NFL PLAYERS are SON OF A BITCH now WOW.\n\nEric Ebron (Detroit Lions tight end): \"Does anyone tell trump to stick to politics, like they tell us to stick to sports?\"\n\nRichard Sherman (Seahawks cornerback): The behavior of the President is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. If you do not Condemn this divisive Rhetoric you are Condoning it!!\n\nLaSean McCoy (Bills running back): It's really sad man ... our president is a asshole.\n\nDoug Baldwin (Seahawks receiver): Iâm not surprised by Trumpâs comments. He has shown, since the beginning, his dehumanized nature. To think he would be anything different is to not know the reality of his presidency. He has surrounded himself with like minded people and has removed anyone who challenges him. He acts like a child craving attention and any attention will do.\n\nAlthough these recent comments are not the worst things heâs said or done, I do believe that this will be a unifying moment for the sports world. And with as much influence as athletes have on the younger generation, this can be an opportunity for us to change the narrative of society and point to the president as a poor example of what you can become if you remain close minded, ignorant and uneducated.\n\nFor all the hate and negativity that has come from Trumpâs presidency, I am still hopeful for justice and love to win out. As I continue to my efforts with the youth of our communities and engage with this hatred, I will resist the urge to return hate with hate and instead react in love and compassion for those who simply can not.\n\nSamples of Celebrities respond:\n\nUSA Today: Hollywood takes a knee on Trump vs. NFL players.\n\nMontel Williams: \"We're not North Korea. NFL players can choose to take a knee.\"\n\nSean Diddy Combs : \"If you do whatever you do in unity, you canât be stopped.\"\n\n\"Yaâll are our stars, you represent us. Yaâll are our strong heros..show that strength please.\"\n\nStevie Wonder: \"I'm taking both knees.\"\n\nEllen DeGeneres: \"Nothing is more American than the right to peacefully protest.\"\n\nAva DuVernayâ: \"He's not declaring war on NFL and NBA. Owners are his donors. He's declaring way against black people with opinions.\"\n\nPharrell Williams said to concertgoers as he kneeled\" \"If I want to get on my knees right now for the people of my city, for the people of my state, that's what this flag is for\".\n\nUzo Aduba: It's that easy. #takeaknee.\n\nlee daniels: #TAKEAKNEE - Take A Photo - Post It\n\nJohn Legend: #TakeaKnee #DarknessAndLightTour #GLORY.\n\nLinda Sarsour: \"Speak the truth even if your voice shakes.\" Make no mistake about it we stand with Kaepernick. #TakeAKnee\"\n\nAmerica Ferrera \"Thank you to all the athletes with the strength & courage to kneel for justice.\"\n\nAlyssa Milano: \"If the ratings down, Trump will use it. In solidarity with #TakeTheKnee and the NFL, let's watch as much football as humanly possible.\"\n\nMatt McGorry: \"In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.\" - Martin Luther King, Jr.#TakeAKnee\n\nChelsea Handler: âYou disrespect our flag every time you open your mouth. You donât deserve to even talk about the flag.â\n\nBarbra Streisand: \"The âyouâre firedâ president thinks heâs still in a reality show! Heâs the one who should be fired.â\n\nComment: We are still waiting to hear from Celine Dion and Kim Kardashian.\n\nPresident Trumpâs list of false and misleading claims tops 1,000\n\nThe Washington Post/Meg Kelly, Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee (August 22, 2017)\n\nWe have been tracking President Trumpâs false or misleading claims for more than seven months. Somewhere around Aug. 4 or Aug. 5, he broke 1,000 claims, and the tally now stands at 1,057.\n\nThatâs an impressive number by any standard. In fact, we are a little late with this update because we have simply been overwhelmed keeping track of the deluge of claims made by the president in the later part of July. Things slowed down during the presidentâs âworking vacation,â so we have finally been able to catch up.\n\nAt the presidentâs current pace, he averages nearly five claims a day. Many are repeats of claims that have been previously debunked. We also include statements that are unacknowledged flip-flops from previously held positions, such as touting new highs in a stock market that he previously derided as being a âbig, fat bubble.â\n\nMore than 30 of the presidentâs misleading statements have been repeated three or more times.\n\nTrumpâs most repeated claim, uttered 50 times, was some variation of the statement that the Affordable Care Act is dying and âessentially dead.â The Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, are not imploding and are expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Moreover, Congress has been unable to pass a law that would repeal Obamacare, making the continuation of the law Trumpâs problem.\n\nTrump repeatedly takes credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office â or had even been elected. Forty-two times, he has touted that he secured business investments and job announcements that had been previously announced and could easily be found with a Google search. And 19 times he has boasted that he achieved a reduction in the cost of Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, even though the price cut had been in the works before he was elected.\n\nBut some of the presidentâs repeated claims have nothing to do with policy but instead rehash discredited campaign rhetoric, such as the false charge that Hillary Clinton gave 20 percent of the U.S. uranium supply to Russia or that the deputy FBI director got $700,000 from Clinton. Both claims were deemed Four-Pinocchios false in 2016. Yet Trump brought them up 11 times.\n\nSome of Trumpâs favorite claims are simply odd. Eleven times, he has said that the United States has already spent $6 trillion on âMiddle East wars,â money that could have been used instead on building roads in the United States. He often suggests this is a recently calculated figure, but it combines the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which is actually in South Asia) and then includes future obligations for veterans costs and interest on the debt through 2053.\n\nAt the six-month mark, the president was averaging 4.6 claims a day, but he has now increased his pace.

Thatâs just common sense; thatâs just speaking the obvious. Manafort, after all, maintained a residence at Trump Tower at or around the same time he was reportedly being tapped by feds. Chances are he ran into Trump on at least one occasion and engaged in a conversation â a conversation that went straight into the fedsâ ears.\n\nNo, whatâs astonishing is that a member of the intel community â well, former member, to be technical â and a high-ranking one at that, would actually admit the presidentâs voice couldâve been caught by wiretap.\n\nBut Clapper, as a quick side note, is the same guy who told a âMeet the Pressâ audience back in March that his intelligence community â the one he oversaw under Barack Obama â never wiretapped Trump or Trump campaign officials.

The groupâs executive director, Austin Evers, recently served in the Department of State as senior counsel for oversight and transparency.\n\nâIf Trump was talking with foreign agents who were under FBI surveillance, he may have been recorded even if not the tap target,â the nonprofit group wrote. âTrying to downplay Trumpâs lie by showing he associated with suspected criminals hardly seems like a robust defense of his honesty.â\n\nThe alleged existence of âFISA warrants targeting Manafort still have nothing to do with what the president talked about in his March 4th Twitter rant,â Moss wrote in a legal analysis challenging the Fox News punditsâ claims that Trump has been vindicated on his accusation against Obama.\n\nAt the very least, the surveillance shows âManafort was the subject of lawful surveillance, and it certainly is plausible that his communications with the president were caught up incidentally in that surveillance,â Moss wrote.\n\nBut this is a ârather far cry from the presidentâs hyperbolic claims from March and his references to Nixon and Watergate,â he wrote.\n\nRead the entire article at NEWSWEEK\n\nComment: FISA warrants targeting Manafort have everything to do with President Trump.\n\nCNN political commentator and host Van Jones called the widely reported investigations and allegations of collusion between President Donald Trump and Russia just a big ânothing burgerâ.

That idiot @realDonaldTrump thinks he was wiretapped.\n\n..Six months later..\n\nCNN: Trump was wiretapped\n\nHere's the thing: The Manafort wiretapping doesn't even come close to proving that Trump's claim was or is right.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\nTrump's tweets:\n\n1. \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\"\n\n2. \"Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!\"\n\n3. \"I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\"\n\n4. \"How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\"\n\nIt is important to be very clear about what exactly Trump is alleging there in his tweets: That President Obama had ordered a wiretap on Trump's own lines -- he repeatedly uses the term \"my phones.\"\n\nDuring the period of time covered by the second Manafort wiretapping, Trump and his former campaign chairman were still in contact. It's not known whether any of the conversations between the two men were picked up on the wiretap. While Manafort does have a residence in Trump Tower, it's not clear whether any FBI surveillance took place there. Is it possible Trump meant \"my phones\" as a catchall for every phone line associated with a person at Trump Tower? If that's the case, why has neither Trump nor the White House made that clear before now as this allegation has festered?\n\n........ .......... .........\n\nIt's worth noting here that even if those conversations between Trump and Manafort were picked up in the surveillance, they would be eliminated unless the conversation had to do with Manafort's ties to Russian officials. This is a process called \"minimization\" which is described in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 this way:\n\n\"Information acquired from an electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to this subchapter concerning any United States person may be used and disclosed by Federal officers and employees without the consent of the United States person only in accordance with the minimization procedures required by this subchapter. No otherwise privileged communication obtained in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this subchapter shall lose its privileged character. No information acquired from an electronic surveillance pursuant to this subchapter may be used or disclosed by Federal officers or employees except for lawful purposes.\"\n\nBut, let's keep our eye on the ball here: The Justice Department tapping Manafort's phone -- even at his residence at Trump Tower (which we don't know if they actually did) -- is not the same thing as Obama ordering Trump's \"wires tapped.\" It's just not. Even if -- and that's a real \"if\" -- conversations between the two men were picked up in the wiretap on Manafort.\n\n........ .......... .........\n\nAnd the fact that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has also definitively ruled out that Trump's phones were tapped.\n\n\"For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign,\" Clapper said on NBC in March. Asked directly whether there was a FISA warrant to tap Trump's phone at Trump Tower, Clapper responded bluntly: \"I can deny it.\"\n\n........ .......... .........\n\nDetails and words matter -- particularly in a story this complicated. And the details and words reported by CNN last night do nothing to exonerate Trump from his still-spurious claim that he was wiretapped.\n\nRead the entire article at CNN Copy\n\nComment: Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large wrote on September 19, 2017 that Donald Trump still has no evidence that his wiretapping claim was right and that the details and words reported by CNN on 9/18 do nothing to exonerate Trump from his still-spurious claim that he was wiretapped. Well, James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, came to CNN on 9/20/2017 and said: \"It's 'Possible' Trump Was Recorded on Manafort Wiretap. It's certainly 'conceivable'.\"\n\nBy the way, the real \"target\" of second FISA warrant to wiretap Paul Manafort was @realDonaldTrump. The Deep State's plan was to wiretap Trump Tower, where Manafort has a residence, in order to get something juicy from Trump. This is a process called 'bloodless coup' understood very well by Chris Cillizza, who pretends that Obama and his team are so honest that they will never violate the process called \"minimization\" described in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Well, you don't think that they will leak the tappings to CNN and The New York Times if they are able to grab Trump by his balls? Have you forgotten the way they leaked the phone conversation between Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak? Not even Donald Trump could control himself and had to take a 'leak' all over Billy Bush when he got the chance grabbing hot women by the pussy. Just look at the way he took the 'leak' on CNN in the cartoon above.\n\nLeft: Just How Did Obama Do It?\n\nRight: Trump Has Nothing To Fear But Fear Itself.\n\nThe target was Trump, not Manafort\n\nOn November 7, 2016, Louise Mensch reported in the right-leaning Heat Street, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had twice sought Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants in connection with its investigation of the Trump campaign's links to Russia. According to Mensch, the first request for a warrant which \"named Trump\" was denied in June 2016 and, a second, more \"narrowly drawn\" request was granted in October 2016. Mensch wrote that this warrant gave \"counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia,\" and to \"look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons\". Mensch further claimed that the October warrant was granted in \"connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server [in Trump Tower] and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank,\" and that \"it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any 'US person' connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men.\" Mensch's article cited reports from two anonymous \"sources with links to the counter-intelligence community.\"\n\n(Source: Wikipedia Trump Tower wiretapping allegations)\n\nComment: If this report was true, the real \"target\" of FISA warrents was @realDonaldTrump. Since the first request for a warrant which \"named Trump\" was denied, the second \"narrwly drawn\" request was used as a Trojan horse. if Trumpâs juicy voice was \"accidentally\" heard on any recording, then, we can all sing \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" except the bitter 'Kenyan-born' Obama, who prefers \"I Got You Babe\" and \"NOW WE ARE EVEN\".\n\nNow you know why Trump fired Comey, the tall guy who requested the FISA warrants --- \"No, No, No, you are not under investigation, Mr. President, but, Good Luck!\"\n\n\"If the federal government wants to 'get you,' they will find a way.\"\n\n(Mike Huckabee, Former Arkansas Governor, September 19, 2017)\n\n\"YES We CAN\" and \"WE WILL, WE WILL\" GET YOU !. --- Barack Obama.\n\nObama spied on Putin, not Trump\n\nTheHill.com/Brent Budowsky (September 22, 2017)\n\nPresident Obama did not tap or spy against President Trump.

Federal agency employees gave a staggering 95 percent of their campaign contributions to oppose the current administration. Political appointees leading these agencies are hard-pressed to counter the effects of their employeesâ nearly unanimous and daily efforts to undermine their goals.\n\nWhen President Trump tweeted in March 2017 that the prior administration wiretapped his campaign and the Trump Tower, the media treated the presidentâs claim not merely as untrue but downright deranged. Intelligence officials responded immediately with steadfast and categorical denials. DNI director James Clapper and FBI director James Comey both insisted that President Trumpâs tweet was not correct or that they had no information about the alleged wiretapping.\n\nWe now know that Manafort, who by the way has a residence in Trump Tower, was indeed subject to a federal wiretap, according to media reports. Now Messrs. Clapper and Comey, and their mainstream media defenders, are left with semantic arguments about âwiretappingâ reminiscent of president Bill Clintonâs infamous claim defending his own sworn testimony because his veracity âdepends upon what the meaning of the word âisâ is.â\n\nConsider also the tale of two investigations. Special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigators deployed brass-knuckles tactics against Manafort, designed to terrify and disorient him and his wife. Intimidation tactics were on full display, bypassing the locks on their residence while they slept and subjected his wife to a weapons search during a predawn raid of the Manafort home. These are highly unusual measures for white-collar offenses, as former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy explains.\n\nIn contrast, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton received kid-glove treatment for her own involvement in national security and corruption offenses. The FBI permitted her to arrange a time to come in and talk with the investigators. There was no search of any of her residences, much less a traumatic predawn raid and spousal body search (can you imagine?).\n\n......... ....... (Then-attorney general Loretta Lynch's chat on the tarmac with former president Clinton.)\n\nAfterwards, Lynch directed Comey to use the term âmatterâ rather than âinvestigation.â New evidence suggests that Comey predetermined that Clinton would not be charged, before investigators had even interviewed her or more than a dozen other witnesses.\n\nOther examples abound. Former United Nations ambassador Samantha Powell allegedly requested unmasking U.S. citizens at an average rate exceeding one request for each working day in 2016, including in the final days of the prior administration. Sheryl Atkinson, a former CBS reporter, outlined how she and other journalists also became targets of the deep state.\n\n......... ....... (Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative nonprofit groups.)\n\nUnprecedented unmaskings, wiretapping opposition campaigns, spying on journalists, directing federal agency power against political opponents: All of these actions were committed by unaccountable federal agency personnel in pursuit of retaining power and influence.\n\nIs there a deep state working against the presidentâs agenda, protecting its own and targeting usurpers? Perhaps we will never know for sure, but this weekâs revelation of the wiretapping of Paul Manafort during and after the election is clearly relevant to this inquiry.\n\nRead the entire article at TheHill.com Copy\n\nRobert Mueller vs Donald Trump\n\nThe Obama Regime Caught Spying on the Trump Campaign\n\nRush Limbaugh (Sep 21, 2017)\n\nRush Limbaugh\n\nRUSH: Samantha Power has been unmasking Americans in the last year of the Obama Regime at the rate of one American every working day. Two-hundred-and-sixty different Americans unmasked by someone not even in the intelligence community. She was a U.N. ambassador. It would be the equivalent of Nikki Haley today unmasking a bunch of people that she thought not â Now, I donât know that too many people know much about Samantha Power.\n\n........... .......... ...........\n\nObama didnât need to send her a memo. The fact that she was working for Obama was all anybody needed to know. She doesnât need to be told that conservatives are to be discriminated against. She doesnât need to be told that conservatives are corrupt. She doesnât need to be told to believe that conservatives pose a threat and therefore they should be penalized, limited, or what have you. Sheâll just do it. As Samantha Power would clearly, if she believes that, for example, opponents of Obama, be they in the Trump campaign or anywhere, just the very fact that they are opponents makes them suspects, the very fact that they oppose Obama.\n\n........... .......... ...........\n\nThey rely on the fact that most people are not nearly as involved and therefore not nearly as suspicious, and therefore they are free and able to operate above the line and above the radar. Theyâre able to operate in plain view. Nobodyâs gonna care, except the opponents, and they donât think we can do anything to stop them. The average, ordinary American, if this is learned, like it has been, the answer will be, âWe didnât know she was doing it. I donât recall. But so what. So what. If she was exposing people, if she was unmasking, they deserved it.â That would be the reaction.\n\nHereâs Catherine Herridge. Catherine Herridge at Fox News is the source authority for the realization that Samantha Power has been unmasking Americans.\n\nHERRIDGE: Fox News is learning new information about the rapid pace of unmasking in the final months of the Obama White House. Two sources not authorized to speak on the record said the requests from Samantha Power, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, exceeds 260, with one request coming in the days leading up to the inauguration.\n\nRUSH: Now, for those again who might be thinking, âWhatâs the big deal here, whatâs unmasking?â Unmasking is a crime, can be a crime. Michael Flynn â everybody knows that name now â Michael Flynn forced to resign from the Trump administration, he was unmasked.\n\nThe way it happens is the intelligence community, the DIA, the CIA, the NSA, the whoever-A, the FBI, conducting wiretap or other kinds of surveillance on known foreign agents. For example, the Russian ambassador, whoever he is, is gonna be surveilled. The North Korean ambassador is gonna be surveilled, wiretapped. They know it. We know it. And so the Russian ambassador, the guy goes to lunch all the time, Kislyak, was under surveillance. And he talked to Flynn one day. Well, the intelligence people hear this. In this case it was Obama intel people. It was before Trump was inaugurated, and they hear Flynn, they hear the conversation.\n\nFlynnâs not supposed to be made public. His side of the conversationâs not supposed to go made public âcause heâs not the target of the wiretap. But if somebody comes along and unmasks him, which happened, then of course it ends up in the newspaper, like it did, and Michael Flynn is destroyed. Heâs considered to be an agent for a foreign government. Heâs talking to the foreign ambassador, the media deep state sources can run stories in the newspaper, Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, put it on TV, and Flynn after a few weeks is destroyed.\n\nAll of that is not legal. You have to get permission and there has to be a legitimate reason. The unmasking happens within the intelligence agency so theyâre never supposed to be public with this because these people are not the target. Unmasked names are people who were not targets. But Samantha Power thought everybody needed to know what theyâre saying and doing. And why? Because theyâre conservatives or because theyâre Republicans and because theyâre not Obamaites. And simply because of that they deserve to be unmasked. That alone will be enough for her.\n\nSheâs no different than the snowflakes on college campus that will engage in riots if somebody shows up and says anything thatâs unapproved. Sheâs no different, that mind-set. And sheâs not alone. So 260 names. And of course Manafort we now learn was surveilled. That means Trump had to have been overheard talking to Manafort. Manafort was being wiretapped, he is talking about Trump. It is a foregone conclusion, itâs inarguable that Trump was overheard and whatever.\n\nNow, Trump found out about it and claims that his wires were tapped at Trump Tower. Everybody laughed and mocked and said he didnât even know how to say it. Your taps donât get wired. Your wires donât get tapped. Trump doesnât even know what heâs talking about. But he always does. He always ends up being, to one degree or another, right.\n\nNow, people said, âNo, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Trump was not targeted.â Exactly. Thatâs the easiest way out. Trump was not targeted. Manafort was. Well, Trump is still not wrong. Itâs a little overlap here. They might be able to credibly say that they didnât target Trump, that there were no wiretaps targeting Trump, but at the same time they would know they didnât have to target Trump in order to monitor what he was saying to certain people. You target those people. You get a FISA warrant to wiretap or surveil somebody, people you know Trumpâs gonna be talking to, and bammo.\n\n........... .......... ...........\n\nSo letâs go to the audio sound bites here. This was March 5th on Meet the Press, Chuck Todd speaking with James Clapper, an elderly version of Mr. Clean, if you add some earrings in there. He was the Director of National Intelligence for Obama. Chuck Todd says, âIf the FBI, for instance, has a FISA court order of some sort for surveillance, would that be information you would know?â\n\nCLAPPER: Yes.\n\nTODD: You would be told this?\n\nCLAPPER: I would know that.\n\nTODD: If there was a FISA court order â\n\nCLAPPER: Yes.\n\nTODD: â on something like this?\n\nCLAPPER: Something like this, absolutely.\n\nTODD: And at this point you canât confirm or deny whether that exists?\n\nCLAPPER: I can deny it.\n\nTODD: There is no FISA court order?\n\nCLAPPER: Not to my knowledge.\n\nTODD: Of anything at Trump Tower?\n\nCLAPPER: No.\n\nRUSH: Well, there was. Thatâs the problem. There was. There was a FISA court order to wiretap Manafort. Manafort had an apartment at Trump Tower. But you heard Clapper, âNo. No. Not to my knowledge.â So did he lie? Did he not know? He said he would know. At the beginning of the bite, yes, he would be told, âI would know this.â\n\nâSo no wiretapping at Trump Tower?â\n\nâNot to my knowledge.â So Clapper goes out, this is when the media starts laughing at Trump, what a buffoon, what an idiot, shouldnât use Twitter, heâs lying and doing all that. So yesterday, last night CNN, Don Lemon goes and gets Clapper, brings him back, says, âCNN has some exclusive reporting involving Manafort, specifically investigators got a FISA warrant to wiretap Manafort before and after the election.

Uh, I canât, uh, I canât confirm or deny it. I cannot comment on the media reporting which is all we have about a FISA warrant allegedly launched against Mr. Manafort. I canât comment on that. I will simply reiterate what I said in March, uh, and I stand on that.\n\nRUSH: What a dodge. What a dodge. I canât comment on it. What do you mean, you canât comment? Youâve been commenting on it every time anybody asks you until â this guy sounded like Gergen yesterday, or two days ago, when he found this all â (stuttering) The court of approval. Anyway, so theyâre chasing their tails now. Theyâre lying either now or then about this. And they have been caught. But they are also confident nothingâs gonna happen to them because even though Lemon uncovered it here, itâs gonna die there, or will. They will not pursue it.\n\n........... .......... ...........\n\nLEMON: Is it possible the president was picked up in a conversation with Paul Manafort?\n\nCLAPPER: Itâs certainly conceivable.

They had a FISA warrant on Manafort, if we are to believe the media. And whoâs the source for the media? The people that did it. Yeah, they are supposed to be classified. But 95% of the crap thatâs been in the newspapers about this for the last nine months has been classified, and itâs leaked anyway.\n\nSo a long way of getting there, but Clapper says (imitating Clapper), âWell, itâs certainly conceivable, yes, that President Trump was picked up in a, uh, certainly conceivable. I donât know, uhhh. And I stand by ââ These people are caught. Samantha Power is caught. Clapper and Brennan and all of these people are caught. They have been exposed here.

It is the Race elephant. And among the allegations, the question of race is one that we are not really looking to engage with, because it is knotty and gnarly. But it bears talking about, because there are black women in Hollywood, and not talking about it does us all a disservice.\n\nRead the article at www.buzzfeed.com Copy.\n\nThe Rush Limbaugh Show\n\nElephant In The Room Of Harvey Weinstein Sexual Harassment Scandal Is âCASTING COUCH RACISMâ (Oct 23, 2017)\n\nRush Limbaugh: âBuried beneath the sickening story of Harvey Weinsteinâs abuse is another story ----(chuckles) ---- Let me sum it up for you. There arenât any black women that made the trek to Harvey Weinsteinâs hotel suite; therefore, in addition to everything else this is, itâs racist.

(MAR 30, 2017, by Olga Khazan The Atlantic Copy)\n\nThe vice presidentâand other powerful menâregularly avoid one-on-one meetings with women in the name of protecting their families. In the end, what suffers is womenâs progress.\n\nPence is not the only powerful man in Washington who goes to great lengths to avoid the appearance of impropriety with the opposite sex.... Social-science research shows this practice extends beyond politics and into the business world, and it can hold women back from key advancement opportunities. ....\n\nWhen men avoid professional relationships with women, even if for noble reasons, it actually hurts women in the end. âThe research is irrefutable: Those with larger networks earn more money and get promoted faster. Because men typically dominate senior management, thereâs evidence that the most valuable network members may be men,â wrote Kim Elsesser, a research scholar at the UCLA Center for the Study of Women, in the Los Angeles Times recently. âWithout access to beneficial friendships and mentor relationships with executive men, women wonât be able to close the gender gap that exists in most professions.â\n\nClara Jeffery (@ClaraJeffery) asked: \"If Pence won't eat with a woman alone, how could a woman be Chief of Staff, or lawyer, campaign manager, or...\"\n\nComment: Harvey Weinstein should be applauded for his courage and willingness to have one-on-one meetings with young actresses in private. However, in order to avoid the appearance of racism, he should, from time to time, invite Black and Latino actresses as well.\n\nPenceâs sexism\n\nMike Pence doesn't eat alone with women. That speaks volumes\n\n(31 March 2017 by Jessica Valenti The Guardian Copy)\n\nNever mind what it means for the (very few) women who work in the White House, who apparently canât count on business dinners or mentorship over a meal. The underlying message of a rule like Penceâs is the same one thatâs taught to teens in abstinence-only education classes: men canât control themselves when alone with women. ... Itâs an insulting view of men, a limiting role for women. ... But perhaps this explains the noticeable lack of women in White House.\n\nif Keith Ellison â who is Muslim (the first Muslim to be elected to the U.S. Congress[)â ârefused to dine one on one with women and used his religion to justify it, the political right would lose their mindsâ.\n\nPence is a misogynist. We know it from his voting record, we know it from the things that heâs said about womenâs rights and now we know it because of his odd personal rule not to dine with women alone. But letâs not let one manâs sexism distract us from his whole partyâs sexist agenda.\n\nPresidents Behaving Badly\n\nLeft: George H.W.

So this is like the antithesis of that hideous night, and that is why I am happy.\"\n\n\"There is no legal definition for collusion, but there is a legal definition for conspiracy,\" co-host Sunny Hostin said. \"Conspiracy requires an overt act from one person to another, I could prove an overt act, easily.\"\n\n\"I remember Richard Nixon, and Richard Nixon stepped down, and so should Donald Trump,\" Behar said. \"If he is going to be taken down for what he did, and this country can start to heal... that is a happy day,\" she said later. \"Justice is messy.\"\n\n\"To me it is not a happy day, it is a sad day,\" former Jeb Bush staffer Ana Navarro said. \"For me what it is, first of all, we're still in this process, it is a scary day. The idea that this guy, he was having contact with the Russians, during the election, was then named National Security Adviser -- the power that that has. The intelligence, the clearance, the access, the influence, the profile, the international implications -- this guy, this former general who knew what he was doing, had been having contact with the Russians and was able to get that position, and that Donald Trump continued protecting him, over and over again... is scary as hell.\"\n\nWood\n\nA man and his wife live in Siberia.

After three months of extensive investigations they conclude that the rabbit does not exist.\n\nThe FBI goes in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, killing everything in it, including the rabbit, and make no apologies: the rabbit had it coming.\n\nThe KGB goes in.

A hard ride over fields and fences and rivulets until the fox is brought down. A ride back with the ears and the tail and then sitting before a roaring fire with a glass of good port. Ah, that is true happiness.\"\n\nThe Frenchman said, \"That is not true happiness. That is merely animal pleasure. True happiness is meeting with the love of your life, having an excellent meal in a topnotch restaurant with champagne, and then retiring to a wonderful hotel room, where you can make frantic and impassioned love all night long. Ah, that is true happiness.\n\nThe Russian said, \"That is not true happiness. That is merely a good time. True happiness comes when you are sitting in your apartment after a hard day at the factory, your little Ivan on your knee, and reading your copy of Pravda. There comes a knock at the door.

Like, what happens if someone robs you and takes everything in your vault?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that!\" says the smooth bank manager. \"The main branch in the city would cover you!\"\n\n\"Okay,\" says Wlodek. \"But suppose the whole bank went bust? I know these things happen.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says the bank manager. \"People have a right to be worried, of course. So that you can feel completely secure, the Polish Central Bank still guarantees your savings.\"\n\n\"But suppose the Polish Central Bank ran out of money?\" asks Wlodek. \"What would happen then?\"\n\n\"This is very hypothetical,\" says the bank manager. \"But if it ever happened, we have a treaty with the Soviet Union. They would still make sure you weren't out of pocket.\"\n\n\"But what if the Soviet Union went bust?\" asks Wlodek stubbornly.\n\nThe bank manager sighs. \"Look,\" he says. \"Wouldn't that be worth 50 zlotys?\"\n\nHonecker and the Sun\n\nHonecker walks into his office, looks out the window and says \"Good morning, dear sun!\" and the sun replies \"Good morning Erich!\"\n\nAt lunch Honecker walks to the window and says \"Good afternoon, dear sun!\", and the sun replies \"Good afternoon Erich!\"\n\nFinally, at the end of the day Honecker walks to his window and says \"Good evening, dear sun!\".
