TMZ has learned.\n\nAccording to court docs filed earlier this week, Simone Sestito claims he has \"negative balances\" on all his personal and business accounts and has been forced to pay his bills with credit cards and loans from his parents.\n\nSestito claims Mena makes $750,000/year, which includes a terrible Captain Morgan ad campaign she did that netted her $225,000.\n\nSestito claims he got used to eating out \"almost everyday at high end restaurants\" and lists his estimated monthly eating out expense as a whopping $3,000/month. A Happy Meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt!\n\nSestito is looking for $17,151/month in spousal support, plus an additional $10k for attorney fees.\n\nA judge has yet to rule."
