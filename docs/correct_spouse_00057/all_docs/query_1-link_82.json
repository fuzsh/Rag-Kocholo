        "text": "Filed yesterday at the Los Angeles Superior Court by the 'American Pie' star's attorney Mark Gross, the divorce documents state November 1 as the date of separation and Suvari is said to be keen for a judge to prevent Sestito from gaining spousal support from her.\n\nIn November, Suvari insisted the couple planned to have children together in the future, but were putting it off for the moment because of her husband's work commitments.\n\nShe then said: \"We are kind of building our lives together, we've been married a year now. He's more in the music industry and he travels a lot as well but we've been able to travel together.\n\n\"Will we have kids? Yeah, one day. One day, hopefully.\"\n\nThis will be Suvari's second divorce after ending her five-year marriage to cinematographer Robert Brinkmann in 2005."
