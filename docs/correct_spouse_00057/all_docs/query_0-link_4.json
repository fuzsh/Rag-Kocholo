        "text": "Mena Suvari is opening up about how she learned to accept being a \"two-time divorcee\" by age 33.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail published Saturday, the \"American Reunion\" star, who filed to divorce second husband Simone Sestito in January 2012 after 18 months of marriage, said, \"Honestly, I never thought that at 33 I’d be a two-time divorcee. But OK, if that’s the path my life is going down, then I accept it.\"\n\nSuvari's first marriage to Robert Brinkmann, a cinematographer 17 years her senior, ended in 2005 after five years of marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for her second marriage to concert promoter Sestito, the actress told the Daily Mail there were \"many reasons why things didn't \"work out.\"\n\n\"I think at some point you have to acknowledge that and work towards maintaining your own happiness. You have to surround yourself with people who love you and want the best for you. I call this process weeding my garden,\" she said. \"A year or so ago I went through all the people in my life and asked myself: does this person inspire me, genuinely love me and support me unconditionally? I wanted nothing but positive influences in my life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't the first time that Suvari dished about how her split from Sestito spawned self-reflection. In February 2012, she told Boston Common magazine, \"I had never really taken time to cultivate who I was... I've felt drained by it. But I feel like I'm really, finally, content at this point in my life. I'm accepting of who I am and how diverse I am and honoring that. All of it.\""
