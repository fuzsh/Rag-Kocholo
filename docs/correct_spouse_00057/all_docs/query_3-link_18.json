Today he's one of the wealthiest managers in the hedge fund world. <br><br>That fortune is at the heart of a divorce battle with his wife Anne Dias Griffin.

He made $900 million the year before and has hauled in $3.9 billion since 2009, according to Alpha. Forbes pegs Griffin's current net worth at $6.5 billion. <br><br>Griffin has been giving away some of that personal fortune, donating $150 million last year to Harvard.

No matter who you are or what your marriage was like, divorce is a difficult thing to go through. It can be ugly or it can be somewhat bearable, but that really depends upon how you go through the process. For some couples, there are lots and lots of things to be worked out when you go through a divorce. Possessions are really only a part of the equation, too. You have to think about the kids who are involved and if you want them to get through the divorce in tact, then you need to get a great divorce lawyer. So what are the ultimate benefits of having a good divorce lawyer? Here are a few of the biggest benefits.<br><br>One of the benefits of using a good divorce lawyer is that it takes a lot of the animosity out of the divorce process. Let's face the fact that a divorce can be mean and disheartening enough on its own, without adding in all of the stuff that can make it even worse. When you are sitting across the table trying to negotiate with the person who you used to sleep with every night, things can become heated. A good divorce lawyer can make this a little bit less so, by using their skills in mediation. They make sure that each of you is heard and that you can come to a solution without things having to get ugly.&#13;<br><br>Another one of the benefits of using a good divorce attorney is that he will always have the big picture in mind. These people are experienced and they have seen it all. They have seen divorces that are much worse than anything that you are going through, so they will help with reframing the situation for you. Often times, you can lose sight of what you need to do if you get too bogged down in what you are doing at the moment. They will keep the big picture in mind, including what is best for your children. Ultimately, they are the ones who get the shaft in the process most often, so having someone who will look out for their good at all times can be very helpful for the entire situation.&#13;<br><br>When you have a good divorce lawyer, all of the little details that go along with the process will be taken care of. One of the things about divorce law that people don't understand is that it is a ton of paperwork even after you make the big decision. Things have to get worked out and the forms have to be drawn up. If you have a good divorce lawyer to take care of the forms, then you won't have to worry about things being lost in the mix. They will be able to look at the entire spectrum and make sure that all of your t's are crossed and your i's are dotted.&#13;<br><br><img style=\"float:left;margin:10px;border:none;\" src=\"http://image.slidesharecdn.com/newmicrosoftofficepowerpointpresentation-141001022336-phpapp02/95/divorce-attorney-service-in-honolulu-1-638.jpg?cb=1412148315\" width=\"342\" /><br><br>All in all, it can be very difficult to go through a divorce without a solid lawyer. Their mediation skills are invaluable and they can save you an awful lot of trouble over the long haul. Trying to do it on your own is something that will undoubtedly lead to frustration on your part and it will lead to a messy divorce.&#13;<br><br><img style=\"float:right;margin:10px;border:none;\" src=\"http://clarklawyers.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Round-Rock-Divorce-Attorney-Team.png\" width=\"369\" /><br><br>The information you obtain from this article is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice.

He denies murder and says he shot Steenkamp with his licensed 9 mm handgun through a toilet cubicle door by mistake fearing she was a dangerous nighttime intruder.<br><br>Any settlement before trial would help Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, who relied on their daughter — a model and reality TV star — for financial help.<br><br>Pistorius could seek non-disclosure clauses in any settlement, law professor and practicing attorney Stephen Tuson said, as well as insist that the agreement is made \"without prejudice\" — meaning he does not admit any fault. However, any settlement might still be used for cross-examination of Pistorius by the prosecution if he testifies at his murder trial, Tuson said.<br><br>\"It definitely does provide material for the prosecution, to just niggle, a niggling question or two,\" Tuson said. \"You paid. Why if you are innocent?\"<br><br>The long negotiations are believed to be nearing their conclusion, with Pistorius' lawyers reportedly hopeful of finalizing an agreement before the 27-year-old's blockbuster trial begins at a high court in the South African capital Pretoria. A conviction, either on a murder charge or on a lesser negligent killing charge, could leave an already financially stretched Pistorius open to a large civil claim.<br><br>State prosecutors are not involved in the private negotiations between Pistorius and Steenkamp's family.<br><br>Tuson, who is not part of the case but has been following it, said a court was \"entitled to draw inferences\" if Pistorius declined to answer questions — as is his right as a defendant — on why he paid Steenkamp's family compensation.<br><br>\"Personally, I would defer … any admissions or any settlement because I don't want any inferences to be drawn,\" Tuson said.<br><br>Burgess, the spokeswoman, said Pistorius was still \"overwhelmed\" and continued to spend time with his family while preparing for his trial. One of the world's most famous sportsmen, Pistorius is rarely seen in public now and thought to be still living at his uncle's house in an exclusive suburb of Pretoria after he was released on bail nearly a year ago.<br><br>The 400-meter athlete had been training as often as four or five days a week for around a month before Christmas, Pistorius' agent Peet van Zyl said, but was now \"scaling down\" his running again in preparation for a trial which is likely to be one of the highest profile cases involving a sports figure in years.<br><br>The case will be heard by female judge Thokozile Masipa, who will pronounce Pistorius guilty or innocent of murder. South Africa has no trial by jury.<br><br>___<br><br>Gerald Imray is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/GeraldImrayAP<br><br><a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/23/oscar-pistorius-settlement-girlfriend-parents_n_4650672.html'>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/23/oscar-pistorius-settlement-girlfriend-parents_n_4650672.html</a><br><br>[[/html]] - Comments: 0\n\n[[html]]<object width=\"400\" height=\"241\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2spHqn-muk8&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2spHqn-muk8&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"400\" height=\"241\"></embed></object><br><br>&#13;<br><br>Most Viewed Articles (Last 30 Days)<br><br>Tanning Without The Dangers By Jerald Shapiro<br><br>In the past years, women take the outside sun waves to darken their colors.
