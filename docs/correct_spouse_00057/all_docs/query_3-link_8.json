        "text": "Regular readers of the Birkat Elyon blog may remember our post from a few weeks ago highlighting some of the top celebrity engagement rings of the last 15 years. It was a dazzling list of beautiful celebrities with beautiful rings – but it was just the beginning. Today we’re back with part II of our look at dazzling celebrity engagement rings.\n\nHeidi Klum\n\nBefore her seven-year marriage (2005-2012) to singer/songwriter Seal, Heidi Klum was presented with an 8.5-carat diamond in December 2004 on a glacier in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The supermodel was a big fan of canary diamond engagement rings set in yellow gold bands, and that’s exactly what Seal gave her. The Lorraine Shwartz-designed ring featured a canary yellow stone flanked by smaller yellow diamonds running along the band.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nJ.Lo has been engaged four times total, and we won’t spend time recounting all four of her engagements, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention the engagement that sparked “Bennifer.” Actor Ben Affleck presented Jennifer with a 6.1-carrat pink Harry Winston stone back in 2002, and the singer said yes. The Bennifer ring is said to be the most valuable of the four engagement rings Lopez has received over the years. Just how valuable is it? Estimates put it at $1.2 million. A source close to Lopez recently said she eventually gave the ring back to Affleck after their relationship ended.\n\nJennifer Lopez (Again)\n\nLopez’s engagement ring from Affleck was her most expensive one. Was. Then along came Marc Anthony, who gave her one worth a whopping $4 million – its blue stone is said to be 8.5 carats – when he proposed in 2004. That engagement fared better than Bennifer, lasting seven years. But when the couple got divorced in 2011, sources said Jennifer planned to sell off all her jewelry from Anthony, including the engagement ring with the impressive blue diamond.\n\nHilary Duff\n\nBack in 2010, professional hockey player Mike Comrie got engaged to actress Hilary Duff while the pair was on a trip in Hawaii. What kind of ring was it? Oh, just a platinum 14-carat radiant-cut ring. That’s all. The two eventually split, but it was said to be an amicable separation, with Comrie and Duff still spending plenty of time around each other.\n\nMena Suvari\n\nMena Suvari, the actress of American Beauty and American Pie fame, got engaged to concert promoter Simone Sestito back in 2009 while the two were on a trip to Jamaica. Sestito used an eight-carat diamond ring seal the deal.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nThey’re one of Hollywood’s most famous couples, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt got engaged to one another back in April of 2012. Pitt assisted jeweler Robert Procop in designing the elegant, enormous ring that included diamonds supposedly of “the highest gem quality.” Because of their perfectionist nature, Pitt and Procop are said to have spent an entire year designing the thing. It features an oblong square diamond and is said to be worth $250,000.\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nJanet and Jermaine were in a relationship for seven years – which seems to be some sort of magic/cursed number for celebrity couples. The two were engaged as of the spring of 2004 when Dupri gave the pop star a 20-carat diamond ring. Though they eventually split, Jackson says that not only does she still talk with Dupri, but that he’s one of her best friends.\n\nBlake Lively\n\nFans were shocked when Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds let them know that the couple had gotten secretly married in 2012. But before the marriage, of course, came the engagement. Reynolds is said to have dropped a couple of bills on the ring…a couple of million bills, that is. The oval-cut diamond ring is believed to be roughly 12 carats and worth up to $2 million.\n\nAvril Lavigne\n\nPopstar Avril Lavigne got engaged to Canadian rocker Chad Kroeger in August of 2012 at a recording studio. The Nickelback front man gave Lavigne a massive diamond ring for their engagement. Getting engaged at their studio was particularly appropriate considering that the two originally met there before recording songs together and eventually falling in love.\n\nCiara\n\nRapper Future and singer/songwriter Ciara’s engagement didn’t end up panning out, as the two eventually called it quits in August 2014 before being wed. However, it certainly started with a bang: Future gave Ciara a 15-carat diamond ring when he proposed in October 2013.\n\nElisha Cuthbert\n\nHilary Duff isn’t the only celeb on this list to get engaged to a hockey player. In September of 2012 Elisha Cuthbert and NHL player Dion Phaneuf got engaged. The couple went on to marry in 2013 in Canada’s Prince Edward Island.\n\nCubic Zirconia Engagement Rings\n\nThe rings on this list are enough to make a Hollywood princess squeal – but they’re also enough to send most of us into bankruptcy for the rest of our lives. Thankfully, there’s another option that’s every bit as magical. Birkat Elyon’s Russian Formula cubic zirconia engagement rings have all the sparkle and beauty of “real” diamond rings for just a fraction of the cost."
