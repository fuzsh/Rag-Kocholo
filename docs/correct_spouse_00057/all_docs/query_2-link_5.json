        "text": "This American beauty is back on the market.\n\nAfter less than two years of marriage, Mena Suvari filed for divorce from husband Simone Sestito in a Los Angeles court on Friday, her rep confirms to Us Weekly.\n\nThe American Beauty actress, 32, wed concert promoter Sestito in a lavish wedding in Vatican City in June 2010, wearing a custom-designed Alice + Olivia gown. The couple exchanged their vows at Santo Stefano degli Abissini, an 8th-century church, and held their reception at Castello Odescalchi, a 15th-century castle in nearby Bracciano — the same spot Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes wed.\n\nSuvari blames the split on \"irreconcilable differences,\" according to TMZ, which obtained the court papers. Listing the date of separation as Nov. 1, 2011, Suvari also seeks to prevent Sestito from receiving spousal support.\n\nThe star will also change her legal name from Mena Suvari-Sestito back to Mena Suvari.\n\nIt will be the second divorce for the star; she and cinematographer Robert Brinkman, 17 years her senior, were married for 5 years before divorcing in 2005.\n\nIn happier times, Suvari gushed to Us about Sestito in the months leading up to their wedding. \"I love him. He's Italian and my family is part Greek, and it's all about family and culture…I love his family and it just inspires me to live that kind of life.\""
