        "text": "Actress Mena Suvari has reached a divorce settlement with her estranged husband just two years after they walked down the aisle.\n\nThe American Beauty star filed for divorce from her second husband, concert promoter Simone Sestito, in January. The pair wed in Italy in 2010.\n\nEarlier this month, Sestito demanded $US17,000 ($17,337) a month in spousal support after growing accustomed to the star's luxurious lifestyle.\n\nIn court papers he also asked for an additional $US10,000 to pay his lawyer's fees.\n\nThe pair has now agreed to a settlement away from the courts, and Suvari has escaped having to pay her ex any further support, according to TMZ.com.\n\nA representative tells the website, \"They have amicably resolved their financial differences outside of Mediation and Court. Neither party will pay the other any support.\"\n\nWENN\n\nFollow Life & Style on Twitter\n\nFollow Life & Style on Pinterest"
