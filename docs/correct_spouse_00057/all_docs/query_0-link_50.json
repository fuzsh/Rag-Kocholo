        "text": "Mena Suvari let the cat out of the bag: She's married!\n\nThe \"American Woman\" star, 39, revealed to Us Weekly Sunday that she secretly wed Michael Hope.\n\n\"Third time's a charm,\" she told the magazine, while attending the Last Chance for Animals’ Annual Celebrity Benefit in Beverly Hills. “It’s great. I’m really happy. We’re happy.\"\n\nAlthough Suvari didn't reveal when the couple quietly said \"I do,\" the actress raved about her \"very intimate\" and \"very beautiful\" wedding ceremony.\n\n“I had my closest friends with me. It was very meaningful,\" she told the magazine. \"After all these years, sort of having ups and downs, it’s very nice just being settled, especially at this point in my life.”\n\nFirst comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes baby in the baby carriage? Suvari didn't seem to rule out the couple's future plans: “Maybe (we’ll) start a family. ... I have a few years left! We’ll see.”\n\nIn August, Suvari shared a cryptic Instagram post of her and Hope in all-white attire, sparking marriage rumors. The picture was captioned, \"Forever finally found us.\"\n\nRelated: Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith recall 'horrible' wedding, share intimate marriage secrets\n\nSuvari was married twice before – to cinematographer Robert Brinkmann from 2000 to 2005 and concert promoter Simone Sestito from 2010 to 2012."
