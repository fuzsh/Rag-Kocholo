        "text": "Elsewhere in the docs, Sestito -- a concert promoter -- reportedly alleges that \"American Reunion\" actress makes $750,000 a year and says he's used to eating out \"almost everyday at high end restaurants,\" listing his estimated monthly dining expenses at $3,000 a month.\n\nThe \"American Beauty\" actress' first marriage to Robert Brinkmann, a cinematographer 17 years her senior, ended in 2005 after five years of marriage. In an interview with the Daily Mail last month, Suvari opened up about her two failed marriages: \"Honestly, I never thought that at 33 I’d be a two-time divorcee. But OK, if that’s the path my life is going down, then I accept it.\""
