        "text": "This Sunday’s New York Times Style section featured a piece on the possibilities of reincarnation. One interviewee, Peter Bostock, uses his belief in past lives to explain the incredible passionate connection he feels with is wife. According to Mr. Bostock, he and his wife share the sort “of attraction and recognition that a soul makes when it encounters the familiar.” As famed neurologist Oliver Sacks says, “recognition is based on knowledge and familiarity is based on feeling.” The brain offers invaluable clues that help explain our subconscious desires. The photo of Mr. Bostock and his wife demonstrate how similar they are to one another. The cause for their intense connection is the chemistry ignited by their facial feature compatibility. Current neuro-science has illuminated the many ways in which our visual perception is manifest as a neurological function.\n\nThe numerous physiological aspects of vision are the focus of a tremendous amount of ongoing research in numerous fields. What we currently know is that there are types of visual information, which are not consciously perceived but are still conveyed and processed. Hence, we interpret stimuli in ways that are not always obvious to us. Most of us don’t know that the people to whom we are most physically attracted have facial features similar to our own because those visuals cues get translated in the unconscious regions of our brain. The eye takes an image but it is the brain that makes sense of it. The optic nerve transmits the received visuals to the cerebral cortex where nerve cells communicate with one another. One particularly pertinent and fascinating discovery was the confirmation of a special face recognition feature in the brain that responds selectively to faces. It’s been proven that faces are unlike all other stimuli; research indicates that by two months old, babies are responding to faces and interacting with others based on exchanged facial expressions. Proof of the unique primacy of the face is also evident because facial perception uses a separate pathway in the brain located at the bottom of the temporal lobe.\n\nOnce that intense connection is established, that’s when desire kicks in. And we thought passion was simple.\n\nBelow are photos of Mena Suvari and husband Simone Sestito, Paul Volker and Anke Dening, Batchelorette Ali Fedotowsky and fiance Roberto Martinez, and HRHs Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden.\n\nAs if finding love were not a hard enough hurdle, society often puts further obstacles in our way. The road to sustainable love is often difficult to navigate and hard to traverse. But it is amazing to see the lengths to which people go to secure that most precious of gifts; the magical combination of abiding love and potent passion. The sacrifices and risks people take, even the losses they sustain, are testament to the power of connection. The things that divide people, some imaginary and some very tangible, can often be overcome when the chemistry is so powerful. There are a host of barriers that the most intrepid lovers can bypass in order to meet their coveted mate on the other side.\n\nOne such barrier is the prison wall. Despite their criminal convictions, many incarcerated men and women still fall madly in love. But to fall in love with someone who is already serving time, particularly an extended sentence, poses serious and unique challenges. I strongly believe that where similar facial features exist, people are willing to go to extreme lengths to ensure that they connect to their facial match. Even inmates and their partners find deep and passionate love in spite of the time and space that threatens to keep them physically apart for many years.\n\nOne woman who married her lover after he was convicted of murder claimed that the potency of their connection was a power greater than them. She asserted the strength of fate in uniting them and keeping them together, despite their circumstances. But, in my view, it was not fate. People tend to believe it is fate but it is actually science at work. The primal urge to be with that familiar face is what generates the strong chemistry that feels like fate and makes people willing to risk everything for that profound feeling.\n\n(http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/prison-wives/)\n\nThen there is the extraordinary story of Michael and Carole Santos, pictured below. Read what Carole has written about their connection and determination to have a life together despite Michael’s prison sentence. And look at their faces.\n\n“I was 38-years-old when I fell in love with Michael Santos. My friends and family thought I’d gone crazy. People could not fathom how I could uproot my life to pursue a romance with a prisoner. But I knew I was leaving behind all the craziness that had consumed my life. I found this incredible treasure I had dreamed of, but never believed was possible, yet I had known him all my life. Michael had been in prison for more than 15 years and he expected to serve another ten years when our romance began. During that time, against unimaginable obstacles, he had earned an undergraduate degree from Mercer University and a graduate degree from Hofstra University, and he had just finished initial drafts of his first two book….\n\nMichael and I worked together to create a plan that would allow me to relocate with every administrative transfer his prison sentence brought. At the same time, we needed to create the financial stability that would help him transition into society after nearly 25 years in prison. With his complete support, encouragement, and blessings, I returned to college to pursue nursing. With a nursing degree, I knew that I could find employment in an honorable profession wherever my husband was confined. That prospect encouraged us. With two years of prerequisites to complete before I could begin nursing school, I invested several years in my education.” (From MichaelSantos.net)\n\nAge is another socially created boundary that often needs to be crossed. But when two people share similar facial features, it often does not matter, to them anyway, how many years separate them. They know that they have something rare and special and they will stop at nothing to realize it. Look at these photos of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.\n\nThe Discovery Channel recently aired The Science of Sex Appeal, an exploration of the various ways in which human physical attraction is informed and enforced by biological and neurological processes. One area of ongoing research involves the importance of scent in mate selection. My theory of shared facial features being a significant, albeit often subconscious, factor in determining chemistry and compatibility is nuanced by scientific data about our sense of smell. It would be an evolutionary disaster if similar facial features were not mitigated somehow in order to prevent members of the same family from finding one another sexually attractive and/or physically desirable. Considering how strong the chemistry can be between those who have comparable features, we must be very grateful that the nose often knows. People are usually somewhat repelled by the bodily odors of members of their immediate families. This crucial aversion helps prevent incest. Family members who share DNA, often share similar body odors and evolution demands that we seek sexual partners outside of our immediate smell orbit on order to perpetuate the species and not sabotage the gene pool by inbreeding. Genetics insist on diversified access to an array of healthy DNA in order to ensure greater immunity and reproductive success.\n\nThis incest aversion protection is hard wired, but it is also subtle and subconscious. Since the homo sapien left the savanna, the demise of hunter/gatherer societies and the dawn of the agricultural revolution, humans have relied less and less on the power of their sense of smell. In addition, we often mask our true scents with perfumes, deodorants and colognes. But that does not stop the one sense that is directly hard wired to our brains from kicking in to protect us in circumstances where the power of similar features exist; but nature demands caution before desire can tamper with the complex fabric of specie survival.\n\nAs Diane Ackerman so aptly puts it in A Natural History of the Senses, “We see only when there is light enough, taste only when we put things into our mouths, touch only when we make contact with someone or something, hear only sounds that are loud enough. But we smell always and with every breath. Cover your eyes and you will stop seeing, cover your ears and you will stop hearing, but if you cover your nose and try to stop smelling, you will die.” This clearly demonstrates that the important and vital visual component which so informs sexual desire and fuels continued chemistry is slightly subordinate to our sense of smell, which according to several scientific studies, offers clues and guidance even when we don’t know it.\n\nA critical unit of investigation that illustrates the importance of scent and the pivotal role of the nose in creating or thwarting desire is the pheromone. Pheromones are chemical secretions emitted by most animals, including humans, designed to trigger certain responses in members of the same species. Human behavior is less controlled by smell than many other mammals but it still provides invaluable clues and offers important social and sexual information in the form of pheromones. We needn’t be aware of these chemical messages to be influenced by them and, hence, responsive to them.\n\nThe profound chemistry often generated when two people share similar facial features is further demonstrated by the hard-wired protection offered to steer us away from extinction. A person’s odor is as individual as their fingerprint but we are fortunate that our sensory and neurological impulses combine to narrow the scope of potential mates and make the ‘game of love’ and the ‘science of sex appeal’ serve not only our romantic urges but also our longevity.\n\nHere’s the link to The Science of Sex Appeal:\n\nHYPERLINK “http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/science-of-sex-appeal-incest-avoidance-odor.html&#8221;http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/science-of-sex-appeal-incest-avoidance-odor.html\n\nTwins in the UK, a brother and sister who were separated at birth and adopted by different families, fell in love and were married in 2008. The aversion to one another’s scent did not kick in for a variety of reasons, such as those mentioned above, scent masking, reduced scent sensitivity, potential blocked neuro-pathways, etc. I believe that this brother and sister fell in love because they have similar facial features. Once they discovered that they were biologically related, they separated.\n\nHere are some female celebrities whose partner bears a striking resemblance to one of her parents. I think this is because the daughter looks like her parent, too. You be the judge!\n\nMarcheline Bertrand and Jon Voight, left, strongly resemble Brad Pitt and their daughter Angelina Jolie, right.\n\nBruce Paltrow, left, and Chris Martin with Gwenyth Paltrow, right.\n\nBrittany Murphy, her mother and husband.\n\nIn a recent New York Times Style piece on Modern Love, (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/fashion/22love.html) Charles H. Antin writes wistfully of discovering, via facebook, that his ex-girlfriend had a new boyfriend. Every so often he would check his ex girlfriend’s facebook page and one day he saw a new guy on her arm; he noticed that “He disconcertingly looked exactly like me but more attractive.”\n\nHis ex didn’t purposely look for someone who looks like Charles … but she is attracted to a man, like Charles, whose features are similar to her own.\n\nAttraction is obviously buttressed by several pertinent factors but psychologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly interested in the role that facial similarities play in successful partnerships. The old wisdom was that long term couples evolved to look more like one another because of shared habits, lifestyles, diets, etc. How can someone start looking like their partner? Only plastic surgery can do that! But new studies indicate that the initial spark of physical attraction is found, not just in desire, but also in evolution. According to a recent University of Western Ontario study conducted by psychologist J. Philippe Ruston, couples with greater genetic similarity were more likely to have happy and successful relationships.\n\nScientists are increasingly curious about the ways in which both genotypical and phenotypical attributes impact the rules of romance. The aforementioned study examines the role of genetics and while our genes determine a lot more than our physical characteristics, they are part of the powerful genetic package. But there is also phenotypical evidence to suggest that people are attracted to one another based on an immediate and unconscious connection to a face similar in degrees of subtlety to one’s own.\n\nI wrote in my first blog that compatibility is a mystery. If I can boast a bit, I believe I solved the mystery! If you have chemistry, and similar style and are two individuals who are reasonable and loving…then, that equals compatibility which leads to a happy union. THE potency of physical attraction indicates a high potential for passion and promise. It does not, however, guarantee a successful union.\n\nOne difficult person in a relationship will make it unstable while two difficult individuals makes it impossible. “You’re doomed”… no matter how similar your facial features are!\n\nBelow is an article on attraction.\n\nhttp://www.liv.ac.uk/precinct/mar05/mar05.pdf (page 12)\n\nThis is a photo of David Letterman’s wife and mistress\n\nboth looking like each other and Mr. Letterman.\n\nRob Thomas told his wife Marisol he was going to marry her on their first date. George W. Bush said it was love at first sight when he laid eyes on Laura. I recently read a feature article in the New York Times Wedding Section about a 63 year-old women who hired a 63 year-old man to do some design work in her apartment. When she opened the door, she had the urge to sing “One Enchanted Evening.” The facial similarities of these couples created incredible feelings of elation and desire.\n\nLong-term relationships are not easy, but shared facial characteristics will enable couples to last the course of a lifetime. When you meet someone that is your match a sensation of familiarity is present and you feel a sixth sense about the person. You have a strong feeling that your love will be returned. This is different than lust. Lust will carry you for a few months or a couple of years if you truly enjoy each other’s company…but it won’t carry you several years or a lifetime.\n\nThink about Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis. They have chemistry, style\n\nand compatibility. I consider “style” to mean the expression of persona or the presentation of one’s self. To give a simplistic example: Brooks Brothers needs Brooks Brothers and Versace wants Versace. If you find a facial feature match and you can see you have similar style, then your compatibility is the only remaining variable, and that will take time to determine.\n\nThe intense, comforting sense of familiarity strengthens any bond. You will feel as if you already know this person, the reason being you have been looking at a version of that face for your whole life: your own! Again, the initial desire and security do not necessarily mean that the relationship is destined to last. The most potent ingredients may be present, but compatibility must also prove itself to sustain any long-term love.\n\nI have been developing a theory of attraction for 15 years and it has generated recent academic and scientific interest. I published a book about it 10 years ago and I am currently working on producing my film on the subject. The fundamental premise is that people are attracted to those who share similar facial features. It’s not about gender or ethnicity but about similarities and proportions. I have many examples of both celebrity and real life couples whose shared facial features exemplify their extraordinary chemistry. Heidi Klum and Seal, for example, have remarkably similar facial features despite their obvious racial differences.\n\nCompatibility is a mystery. But there are many clues to help us understand the intensity of attraction. Often shared facial features can invite amazing chemistry and desire. This desire acts as the glue that keeps the relationship strong and keeps the passion alive. I believe this is what brings couples together, gay or straight. Intense chemistry does not guarantee staying together forever, that depends on other characteristics of the relationship. But the dawn of any sound relationship is mutual attraction.\n\nLooking for your soul mate involves knowing your own facial features. Sometimes looking in the mirror and studying your face or taking a picture of yourself and knowing, shape and size of forehead, spacing of eyes- shape of eyes, shape of face – width of face, shape of nose and lips, etc.\n\nThe topic of physical attraction and the compatibility of facial features is currently receiving a lot of scholarly attention. There are a host of studies that buttress the power of this theory and demonstrate its potency. Links to these studies and photos that exemplify this theory will be posted in future blogs. Please stay tuned."
