Mena Suvari has filed for divorce from her husband of 18 months, Simone Sestito.

The American Beauty actress cited "irreconcilable differences" in court papers filed in Los Angeles yesterday (January 13).

Suvari claimed to have separated from Sestito back in November 2011 and is set to ask a judge to deny the concert promoter spousal support, according to TMZ.

The couple wed at a ceremony in Vatican City in June 2010 after a two-year engagement. They first met at the 2007 Toronto Film Festival.

Suvari previously described her marriage as "comfortable" and last year said she was ready to have children with Sestito.

The 32-year-old, set to reprise her role in American Pie: Reunion this April, divorced first husband Robert Brinkmann in 2005 after a five-year union.
