        "text": "George III, Queen Charlotte and their six eldest children. Zoffany Royal Collection Trust/© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2014. Source: www.georgianera.wordpress.com\n\nBefore his succession, George (4th June 1738– ​29th January 1820) was a grandchild of the Sovereign, namely HM King George II, and as such was granted the Royal Arms differenced by a label of five Points on 27th July 1749 at the age of 11. This was Azure (blue) with the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or. As you will see from the illustration above, this clashed terribly with the second Quarter showing France, which was effectively the same as the Label!\n\nGeorge was not assigned what we would nowadays consider the 'traditional' Label for the first son of a Prince of Wales, namely three-points with a central St George's Cross, as the Hanoverians seem to have considered this the 'traditional' Label for a second son. George's uncle William, Duke of Cumberland, had been assigned just that Label back in 1727 when his Father had ascended the Throne and he had become the son of a sovereign. William was still alive in 1749.\n\nGeorge's Father was HRH Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales who died suddenly in 1751 and who will be the subject of a subsequent Blog. Briefly, Prince George was HRH Duke of Edinburgh, inheriting his Father's Dukedom. As George was not the first son of the Sovereign he could not inherit the Dukedom of Cornwall but three weeks after Frederick's death King George II created his Grandson Prince of Wales and so took on the plain label of three points in white and the plain red Inescutcheon of an heir to the Hanoverian titles.\n\nAlthough George changed titles, he did not change rank. If he did use the single arched Crown of an Heir Apparent as no one could change the order of succession once Frederick had died, he was still only the grandchild of a sovereign. That would be a debate which would only be entered into again if the matter, God forbid, arose again\n\nThe Coat of Arms of HM King George III as King underwent a number of changes during his reign because the British Royal Arms are territorial and represent the main countries over which the Monarch rules rather than being personal. The Hanoverian Dynasty 'inherited' the Arms of the last Stuart Monarch, Queen Anne, and added a Quarter for their own territory, namely the then Electorate/Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg, commonly known as Hanover.\n\nThe first Quarter showed the impaled Arms of the three Lions of England and the red Lion within a Double Tressure of Scotland which represented the Acts of Union of 1707 and the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The three Fleurs-de-Lys of France had been 'relegated' to the second Quarter at the same time as there had been no claim to French land since the Tudor Dynasty and the Treaty of Troyes in 1564. The Harp of Ireland was still in the third Quarter as Ireland had technically been in a personal union with the English Crown since the Irish Parliament had passed the Crown of Ireland Act in 1542, proclaiming King Henry VIII to be King of Ireland. As mentioned, the then Electorate/Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg made up the fourth Quarter as it had been introduced in 1714 with the accession of HM King George I as the first monarch of the Hanoverian Dynasty.\n\nThe Arms of Hanover were largely territorial, too.\n\nI) Gules two lions passant guardant Or (Brunswick), II) Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (Lüneburg), III) Gules a horse courant Argent (Westphalia), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire)\n\nShield of Arms of the Kingdom of Hanover. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nThe Acts of Union 1800 which came into effect on 1st January 1801 created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. At the same time, King George III abandoned the historical claims to the French throne since France had become a republic in the meantime. The title King of France was dropped as part of the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens which was later ratified in March 1802. The Royal Arms were therefore changed, with England now occupying the first and fourth Quarters, Scotland the second and Ireland the third. The Arms of the Electorate of Hanover were now represented on an Inescutcheon surmounted by the Electoral Bonnet. Although the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in August 1806, The King remained at war with Napoleon (who had created the Kingdom of Westphalia) and continued to style himself Elector of Hanover, while the Hanoverian government was operating in London. The Royal Coat of Arms was not affected and the Inescutcheon of an Archtreasurer to the Empire was still shown, even though it was an anachronism.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hanover was established in October 1814 by the Congress of Vienna, which settled issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. King George III was therefore restored to his Hanoverian territories but as King now. This was reflected in the Coat of Arms of the joint realms with the 'upgrading' of the Electoral Bonnet on top of the Inescutcheon to a Continental Royal Crown.\n\n​\n\nCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\n​(HM Queen Charlotte)\n\nCoat of Arms of Queen Charlotte. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Sophia Charlotte 19th May 1744 – 17th November 1818) was born into a relatively minor north German territory and received very limited education. This seemed to suit the new King George III's requirements for a wife and, thankfully, especially considering her care of him during his bouts of madness, they became a very devoted couple.\n\nCharlotte did more than her duty of providing an heir and a spare by giving birth to 15 children, 13 of whom survived to adulthood. More than that, though, George and Charlotte began to foster the idea of a Royal Family and enjoyed a certain domesticity which their granddaughter Victoria would carry on and develop. However, they could not exactly escape the curse of the Hanovers, especially with their eldest son, George, with whom Charlotte had a difficult relationship.\n\nCharlotte was a patron of the arts, being a passionate admirer of Handel, and an amateur botanist who helped expand Kew Gardens; the South African flower, the Bird of Paradise, was named Strelitzia reginae in her honour.\n\nShe died in 1818. It is understood that her husband, who outlived her by just over a year, was not aware of her death.\n\nHer Coat of Arms were simply those of her Father and her Husband impaled together. The format shown is from 1816 when she became Queen of Hanover.\n\n​Unless this was a mistake at the time, Charlotte's funeral Hatchment shows that she was entitled or at least used the full Inescutcheon of an Archtreasurer to the Holy Roman Empire, namely the red Inescutcheon with the gold representation of Charlemagne's Crown. She also evidently continued to show it until her death.\n\nThe photograph to the right shows Charlotte's Hatchment which was rescued from a skip and returned to Kew Palace where she died.\n\nA Hatchment is a painting of a person's Coat of Arms on a diamond of wood which is usually displayed at their funeral. As well as the Arms being significant, the background of the Hatchment can be informative, too. Here, Charlotte's is divided white and black. The white half to the left signifies that her husband was still alive. at the time of her death.\n\nQueen Charlotte's restored Hatchment at Kew Palace along with Peach Froggatt, member of the Middlesex Heraldry Society.

He was created Prince of Wales 7 days later.\n\nAs such, he was also automatically entitled to the plain white 3-pointed Label of a Prince of Wales but was not created a Knight of the Garter until 3 years later. Whilst the Acts of Union of 1800 did change his Coat of Arms as of 1st January 1801, neither the formation of the Kingdom of Hanover nor his appointment as Prince Regent in 1811 affected his Coat of Arms as only his Father could use the Electoral Bonnet and, subsequently, the Crown.\n\nOne thing to observe, though, is the Inescutcheon in the Hanoverian Arms which is plain red. The Elector of Hanover under the Holy Roman Empire was entitled to an Inescutcheon as an augmentation to his Coat of Arms - a representation of Charlemagne's Crown on a red Shield for the Archtreasurer. The Heir was entitled to a plain red Shield.\n\nThe Prince took on his Father's Coat of Arms when he ascended the Throne in 1820.\n\nIn 1795, George famously, or 'infamously', married his cousin Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfebüttel. Their tempestuous marriage has already been mentioned in the Blog about their only child, Princess Charlotte Augusta.\n\nThey effectively separated not long after their wedding night. George sought a divorce which Caroline refused. When George became King, Caroline returned from exile to assert her claims as Queen but George tried to divorce her by introducing the Pains and Penalties Bill through Parliament. However, as George and the Bill were so unpopular and Caroline so popular with the people, the Bill was withdrawn by the Government.\n\nCaroline was barred from the Coronation in 1821 and was refused entry to Westminster Abbey on a number of occasions. She died 3 weeks later.\n\nCoat of Arms of Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel as HM Queen Caroline. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nCaroline's Coat of Arms were simply those of her Father impaled with those of her Husband. They are shown above as Queen.\n\nNote that the first two Quarterings of Caroline's Arms are Lüneburg and Brunswick, the same as the Hanoverian Arms. Her Father was Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg and came from a branch of the same Welf/Guelf family as the Hanoverians. From the time of the German Unification in the 1870s to shortly before the First World War there were reluctant discussions about the then ex-King of Hanover succeeding to this Dukedom. This was finally granted in November 1913 but became academic with the German revolutions of 1918 when the Free State of Brunswick was founded within the Weimar Republic.\n\nAlso, there is a certain symmetry (traditional within German heraldry) with the Quarterings at the bottom of the Shield arranged to complement each other in that the stag's antlers (or Attires), the red of Regenstein and the black of Blankenburg, either side of the black stag of Klettenburg, are tilted in opposite directions whereas, when they are displayed separately, they are tilted in the same direction. It is the red Attires of Regenstein which have been turned round.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nFrederick Augustus (16th August 1763 – 5th January 1827) was the second child of King George and Queen Charlotte. He was appointed Prince-bishop of Osnabrück at the age of 6 months. He remains largely forgotten, like his namesake Grandfather, as he died before his elder brother George.\n\nAt the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) had awarded the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück alternately to a Catholic bishop and to a cadet branch of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Osnabrück became a form of gift with land and income. As such, Frederick was entitled to an Inescutcheon of the Shield of the Bishopric of Osnabrück in place of his Father's red and gold Inescutcheon. The shield was white with a red wheel.\n\n​Osnabrück was annexed to Hanover in 1803. Frederick had ceased to be Prince-Bishop the year before.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück. Authorage: WappenWiki/JSpuller\n\nOtherwise, Frederick was a career soldier, rising to the rank of Field Marshal. Two campaigns, in Flanders and Holland, went against him and he was mocked in the nursery rhyme 'The Grand Old Duke of York'. However, he then carried through a series of reforms to strengthen the British Army after years of neglect.\n\nHe suffered at the hands of one of his mistresses, Mary Anne Clarke, who seriously compromised him. Frederick resigned as Commander-in-Chief in 1809 only to be exonerated of any personal involvement and was restored two years later.\n\nFrederick married his cousin Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia in 1791 but it was not a happy marriage and the couple soon parted. He is not known to have had any children, not by any of his mistresses let alone his wife. Although he became Heir Presumptive on the succession of his elder brother George in 1820, Frederick died in 1827 and did not contribute to the race for an heir.\n\nFrederick was assigned a Label of three Points with a central red St George's Cross, which makes one wonder what would have happened if his niece, Charlotte Augusta, had been male. As previously mentioned, this Label does not seem to have been seen as the traditional Label for the eldest son of a Prince of Wales in those days.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews\n\n​(HM King William IV)\n\nCoat of Arms of HM King William IV as The Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nWilliam Henry (21st August 1765 – 20th June 1837) served in the Royal Navy, spending time in North America and the Caribbean, and was later nicknamed the \"Sailor King\". In 1789, he was created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. In 1827, he was appointed as Britain's first Lord High Admiral since 1709. As his two older brothers died without leaving legitimate issue, he inherited the throne when he was 64 years old, making him the oldest heir to have succeeded. His relatively short reign saw several reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in nearly all of the British Empire, and the British electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832. Through his brother Adolphus, the Viceroy of Hanover, he granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution.\n\nAt the time of his death William had no surviving legitimate children, but he was survived by eight of the ten illegitimate children he had by the actress Dorothea Jordan, with whom he cohabited for twenty years. Late in life, as part of the race for an heir after Princes Charlotte Augusta died in childbirth, he married and apparently remained faithful to the young princess who would become Queen Adelaide.\n\nAs such, William was succeeded in the United Kingdom by his niece Victoria and in Hanover by his younger surviving brother Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland because the succession in Hanover was regulated by Salic Law which prevented women succeeding to the Throne.\n\nIn 1781 William was assigned a completely new Label - 3 Points with 2 blue Anchors and a central red St George's Cross. His was the first to carry an Anchor, presumably to represent his career in the navy. His Label was subsequently assigned to another royal career navy man, Queen Victoria's second son, HRH The Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as mentioned in this previous Blog. He wasn't created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster until 1789.\n\nAdelaide was a princess from another minor German state - Saxe-Meiningen - to which she was briefly heir until the birth of her brother Bernhard. Although the State was known for its liberalism, Adelaide was thought of as pious, even boring and prudish, especially in comparison with the British Court.\n\nWilliam went ahead with the marriage, in a joint ceremony with his younger brother Edward, Duke of Kent, and Adelaide gave him much needed stability and calmed his more Hanoverian tempers and ways.\n\nWhilst William could not see the purpose of his own Coronation, especially following the crippling extravagances of his elder brother, Adelaide was praised for her dignity.\n\nCoat of Arms of Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen as HM Queen Adelaide. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nUnfortunately, in the race to produce an heir to King George III, Adelaide gave birth to two daughters, Charlotte and Elizabeth, neither of whom survived infancy, and had a number of miscarriages. As a consequence, both Wiliiam and Adelaide took comfort in their niece, Victoria, daughter of Edward, Duke of Kent, as the next heir, in spite of a very public feud with her mother, the Duchess.\n\nNot in the greatest of health and ever in search of better climates, Adelaide nevertheless survived her husband by 12 years as the first Queen Dowager for over 100 years. Her greatest legacy is the fact that the capital city of the State of South Australia is named after her.\n\nAgain, as a wife, Adelaide's Coat of Arms are those of her Husband (firstly as Royal Duke and then as King) and her Father impaled together.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Princess Charlotte, Princess Royal\n\n(HM The Queen of Württemberg)\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Princess Charlotte, Princess Royal. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nCharlotte Augusta Matilda (29th September 1766 – 5th October 1828) was the fourth child and first daughter of George and Charlotte. She became Queen of Württemberg as the wife of King Frederick I.\n\nHer Coat of Arms have been covered in a previous Blog as Queen Victoria largely repeated the Labels of King George III's children for her own children. Charlotte's Label of a red Rose between two St George's Crosses was not only later assigned to Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, HRH The Princess Victoria, also Princess Royal, but to the present Queen when she was HRH The Princess Elizabeth.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous Blog, Charlotte's is the only Coat of Arms of her generation shown with the pre-1801 Royal Arms, showing Hanover in the fourth Quarter. The Princess Royal appears to be the only Daughter of King George III whose Label was not assigned in 1789. It became academic, however, in 1797 when she married. All of her sisters either married after 1801 and therefore the post-1801 Arms are relevant, or remained unmarried.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nEdward Augustus (2nd November 1767 – 23rd January 1820) was created Duke of Kent and Strathearn in 1799. He was a career soldier, serving as Governor of Gibraltar and as commander-in-chief of British forces in the Maritime Provinces of North America (basically Canada). He was the first Member of the Royal Family to live in North America and the first British Prince to visit the fledgling USA after Independence. If not entirely liked, his intentions were honourable. However, he will mostly be remembered as the brother who won the race to provide King George III with an heir - the girl who became Queen Victoria.\n\nHe died of pneumonia in 1820, six days before his ageing, ill father and 17 years before he could have become king himself. The baby Alexandrina Victoria was not even a year old.\n\nEdward was assigned a Label of three Points, the centre charged with a St George's Cross and the two outer Points each carrying a blue Fleur-de-Lys. It is hardly surprising, though maybe only by happy coincidence, that when Queen Victoria came to assign a Label to her next son, HRH The Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, the next son of King George III to emulate was none other than Queen Victoria's own Father, the Duke of Kent.\n\nIn the race for an heir, Edward had abandonned his mistresses, mainly Madame de Sainte-Laurent, and married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, widow of Charles, Prince of Leiningen and, ironically, sister of Prince Leopold, in his turn, widower of Princess Charlotte Augusta, Edward's niece. They married at Kew in a joint ceremony with Edward's brother William.\n\nAfter Edward's death, Victoria stayed on in England with their baby daughter, betting on Edward's surviving elder brothers not providing an heir themselves. Through feuds and rumours of an affair with her private secretary John Conroy, the mother survived to see the daughter succeed to the Throne but was then, in her turn, dismissed until her first grandchild, also Victoria, was born.​\n\nMarital Coat of Arms of TRH The Duke and Duchess of Kent atop the entrance to the Royal Victoria and Sussex Hotel, Tunbridge Wells, formerly the Sussex Hotel.

Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nAugusta Sophia (8th November 1768 – 22nd September 1840) was the sixth child and second daughter. She was closest to her immediate sisters, Charlotte and Elizabeth. Although from a very fertile family for the times and having numerous suitors, Augusta never married. Officially...\n\nLike several of her sisters, Augusta embarked on a romance, in her case with Anglo-Irish army officer Brent Spencer who later became equerry to her Father. There are rumours that Augusta approached the Prince Regent to ask for consent to marry him, but there is no evidence that they did marry unless it was in private.\n\nAs of 1789, as a daughter of the sovereign, Augusta Sophia was assigned a Label argent of three Points, the centre Point bearing a red Rose , the two outer Points with a single Ermine Spot. This same Label was subsequently assigned to Queen Victoria's second daughter, Alice, after which an Ermine Spot has never been used again.\n\nHRH The Princess Elizabeth\n\n(HRH The Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg)\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Princess Elizabeth. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nElizabeth (22nd May 1770 – 10th January 1840), the next daughter of George and Charlotte, was the least fussy and most down-to-earth of the Princesses, being the only child of George III who shared his interests in agriculture. She also had a well-developed sense of humour.\n\nShe is rumoured to have married a certain George Ramus in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act (as had a number of her brothers, anyway) and also to have given birth to a daughter, Eliza. But Elizabeth escaped the rigours of the British Court by marrying a little-known German Prince, Frederick of Hesse-Homburg in 1814, who later succeeded his father as Landgrave in 1820.\n\nElizabeth was also assigned a Label in 1789. Hers was a central St George's Cross between two red Roses which was later assigned to Queen Victoria's next daughter Helena.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale\n\n(HM King Ernst August of Hannover)\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Prince Ernest Augustus as Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nErnest Augustus (5th June 1771 – 18th November 1851), as fifth son, seemed unlikely to become a monarch. None of his four elder brothers had a legitimate son and the only child of the next generation who survived infancy was his niece Victoria. So it seemed likely that he would become King of Hanover where Salic Law prevailed, which barred succession to or through a female. Therefore, when his elder brother HM King William IV died in 1837, Ernest succeeded him as King of Hanover. In the United Kingdom the laws of succession were determined by a different system, male-preference primogeniture then, and Victoria became queen. Thus ended the personal union between the British and Hanoverian crowns that had existed since 1714.\n\nErnest was born in England but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. In 1799 he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale.\n\nAlthough his marriage in 1815 to his twice-widowed cousin Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved a happy one. When Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave him some prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried elder brothers married quickly and the daughter of Edward, Duke of Kent, pipped Ernest Augustus to the position as British Monarch, although it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take the throne himself.\n\nErnest was an active member of the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative voting record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia. (You can gather that he wasn't very much liked.)\n\nWhen King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest acceded to the Hanoverian throne. Becoming Hanover's first resident ruler since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign.\n\nAs a British Prince, Ernest was assigned a Label which was the reverse of his next elder brother Edward, namely a central blue Fleur-de-Lys between two St George's Crosses. This Label was not assigned to any of Queen Victoria's children, perhaps not necessarily because Ernest Augustus was not liked, but because his descendants were still alive and still exist to this day.\n\n​As King of Hanover he simply carried on with the same Coat of Arms as his predecessor King William apart from converting to a Continental Crown on top and dropping the Crown from the central Inescutcheon. He maintained the British Quarterings as he was still a British Prince and, until the birth of Queen Victoria's children, was Heir Presumptive to the British Throne.\n\nStrangely, though, he kept the British Supporters too, especially the Unicorn of Scotland.\n\nThe Hanoverian Motto was SUSCIPERE ET FINIRE which means 'Support and Finish' or 'Undertake and Accomplish'.\n\nCoat of Arms of Hanover 1837 - 1866.

Source: http://www.welt-der-wappen.de\n\nThe above Coat of Arms is taken from above a door in Schloß (or Castle/Palace) Celle in Germany which was occasionally used by the Hanoverian Royal Family as a summer residence. Architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves made several alterations in 1839 and 1840, just after Ernst August came to the Throne.\n\nYou may notice that the Arms bear a three-Pointed Label which is plain rather than carrying Ernst August's personally assigned Charges of a Fleur-de-Lys and St George's Crosses. This representation was presumably part of the alterations made by Laves at a time when Queen Victoria had not married and had any children yet and whilst Ernst August was not only Heir Presumptive to the British Throne but considered himself the rightful heir. The Royal Heraldry of England by J. H. & R. V. Pinches, 1974, states that the Label was actually 'changed' to the plain version but was dropped in 1848.\n\nHRH The Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nAugustus Frederick (27th January 1773 – 21st April 1843) was the only surviving son of George and Charlotte who did not pursue any military career. He was known for his liberal views, which included reform of Parliament, abolition of the slave trade, Catholic emancipation, and the removal of existing civil restrictions on Jews and dissenters. He was both President of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nHis claim to fame is that, amongst many mistresses which a number of his brothers had anyway, Augustus married twice, both times in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act which had been brought in in 1772 following marriages deemed to be unsuitable made by two of King George III's brothers when the King himself had been required to marry for dynastic reasons.\n\nOn 4th April 1793, he married Lady Augusta Murray, first privately and without witnesses, at the Hotel Sarmiento, Rome, and again, after banns but still in contravention of the Act, on 5th December 1793, at St George's, Hanover Square, London. Both marriages were declared null and void by the Court of Arches on 14th July 1794, and the two resulting children were subsequently considered illegitimate. Lady Augusta retained custody of the children when she and Augustus separated in 1801.\n\nA year after the death of Lady Augusta Murray, Prince Augustus apparently married Lady Cecilia Buggin, again in contravention of the Act, on or about 2nd May 1831, at her house in Great Cumberland Place, London. On that day she took the surname Underwood in lieu of Buggin. On 10th April 1840, she was created Duchess of Inverness by Queen Victoria (the Duke being Earl of Inverness) giving her equal status at Court but not the same title. Actual acceptance of the marriage would have meant acceptance of the Duke's earlier marriage and thereby the legitimacy of his two children, but the couple were socially accepted as husband and wife.\n\n​The situation was helped by the fact that Augustus was Queen Victoria's favorite Uncle. So much so that she chose him to give her away at her wedding to Prince Albert in lieu of her deceased father, the Duke of Kent.\n\nAugustus was assigned the unusual Label of two red Hearts on the middle Point and a red St George's Cross on each of the two outside Points. His Arms were not inherited by his children as they were illegitimate. Nor, surprisingly, was it passed on to any of Queen Victoria's children.\n\nHRH The ​Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nAdolphus Frederick (24th February 1774 – 8th July 1850) was the tenth child and seventh son of George and Charlotte. He held the title of Duke of Cambridge from 1801 until his death and served as Viceroy of Hanover on behalf of his two elder brothers George IV and William IV. He was largely a career soldier.\n\nWhen William died and his elder brother Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, became King of Hanover only to undo much of Adolphus's work, Adolphus came back to Britain.\n\nPart of the race to produce an heir, he married his second cousin Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, first at Kassel, Hesse on 7th May and then at Buckingham Palace on 1st June 1818. She was the third daughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse, who in turn was the last surviving grandchild of George II through his daughter Mary. Technically, Adolphus won the race when his first child, christened George William Frederick Charles, was born on 26th March 1819. Victoria of Kent and George of Cumberland were born within 3 days of each other but two months later than George of Cambridge. However, Victoria's father was the more senior brother, which is why she became Queen.\n\nAdolphus and Augusta had two further children, Augusta and Mary Adelaide. Whilst George became a senior member of the British Royal Family, narrowly missing out on marrying his cousin Victoria, and another career soldier, his younger sister Mary Adelaide is probably more famous for her expensive tastes and extravagant lifestyle, forcing her family to live abroad for a while to reduce their debts. Her daughter, Victoria Mary, would become betrothed to Prince Albert Victor in late 1892, who died of influenza not long after in the following year, and then the wife of Albert Victor's brother George. She became Queen Mary on her husband's accession to the Throne as HM King George V (of the United Kingdom) and is The Queen's paternal Grandmother.\n\n​Adolphus was assigned the reverse of his elder brother Augustus's Label, namely a central red St George's Cross and two red Hearts on each of the outside Points. Whilst George was assigned his Father's Coat of Arms plus a three-pointed Label underneath in 1835, Adolphus's Arms lived on through his daughter Mary Adelaide and came to prominence with HM Queen Mary as we saw in a previous Blog. Both daughters, Augusta and Mary Adelaide, had been assigned their Father's Arms officially, borne on a Lozenge as shown below, in 1843. (Please note that the first graphic below does not show the correct Coronet.)\n\nQueen Mary's brother, Alexander, also carried the quartered Coat of Arms of Cambridge and Teck (Mary Adelaide having married the Duke of Teck) but his Arms were differenced with a black Crescent for a second son, his elder brother also being Adolphus, later to become Marquis of Cambridge. Alexander married HRH Princess Alice of Albany, daughter of Queen Victoria's youngest son Prince Leopold who suffered from hemophilia and died young. Leopold was assigned a very similar Label to Adolphus but with single red Hearts and his daughter Alice was assigned a 5-point Label with a central St George's Cross and each of the other four Points with a single red Heart. This similarity and bringing together of the similar Labels is covered in this previous Blog.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nMary (25th April 1776 – 30th April 1857) married her first cousin, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, when both were 40. She died on 30th April 1857 at the age of 81, the longest-lived and also the last surviving child of George and Charlotte out of the 15. She was also the only one of George III's children to be photographed.\n\nMary was assigned a Label with a central red Rose and a red Canton (a square in the upper dexter or left-hand corner) on each of the outer two Points. Cantons were used a lot in medieval heraldry as well as Georgian. This same Label would be assigned to Queen Victoria's next daughter, Louise.\n\nHRH Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh was the only son of HRH Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh who was himself the younger brother of HM King George III.\n\nWhilst he was considered as a husband for Princess Charlotte Augusta, it was only in case no other suitable candidate was available. (She ended up marrying Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.) Said to be grander than the King, his capabilities (or, rather, lack thereof) were summed up by one of his many nicknames, \"Silly Billy\".\n\n​William Frederick was the great-grandson of a sovereign. His grandfather was Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died before he could succeed to the Throne. As such, he was assigned his father's Arms with the addition of a plain white Label.\n\n​\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh. Authorage: Wikipedia/Robin S. Taylor.\n\nHRH The Princess Sophia\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Princess Sophia. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nSophia Matilda (3rd November 1777 – 27th May 1848) is perhaps best known for the rumours surrounding a possible illegitimate child.\n\nSophia and her sisters were well-educated but raised in a rigidly strict household. As a result, Sophia and all but one of her sisters grew up in their mother's cloistered household, which they frequently referred to as a \"Nunnery\".\n\nRumours spread, however, that Sophia became pregnant by an equerry of her father's, Thomas Garth, and gave birth to an illegitimate son in the summer of 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of incestuous affair with her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular anyway. Historians are divided on the validity of these stories, however it is believed that Thomas Garth junior tried to blackmail the Royal Family.\n\nIn her final years, Sophia lived in the household of her niece, the future Queen Victoria, at Kensington Palace where she fell under the sway of Victoria's comptroller, Sir John Conroy. He reportedly took advantage of her senility, blindness and money, but helped to deal effectively with the bullying of Sophia's supposed illegitimate son. Sophia frequently served as his spy on the Kensington household as well as on her two elder brothers for Conroy.\n\nSophia never married and died at her residence in Vicarage Place, Kensington Palace.\n\nSophia was assigned a Label with a red Heart between a red Rose on each of the two outer Points. This Label was consequently assigned to Queen Victoria's next and last daughter, Beatrice.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Prince Octavius and ​HRH The Prince Alfred\n\nUnfortunately, little can be written about the next two Princes.\n\nBoth were inoculated against small pox, Octavius (23rd February 1779 – 3rd May 1783) six months after Alfred (22nd September 1780 – 20th August 1782) had died. Both became ill and died, Alfred at the age of two and Octavius at the age of four.\n\n​His parents were devastated, in particular his father. The King's later bouts of madness would involve hallucinations of his two youngest sons.\n\n​\n\nHRH The Princess Amelia\n\nCoat of Arms of HRH The Princess Amelia. Authorage: Wikipedia/Sodacan."
