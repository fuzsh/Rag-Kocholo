(Baptism register of St. James Piccadilly, Westminster)\n\nThe future King George was born at Norfolk House, St. James’s Square, Westminster, Middlesex, England on 24 May 1738 to Frederick, Prince of Wales the heir apparent to the throne, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. [1] [2] The London Gazette reported that the hasty baptism \"was occasioned by some dangerous Symptoms that appeared at first, though they are now happily over...\" [3]\n\nAs he could not be baptised twice according to the canon law of the Anglican Church, he was publicly named as George William Frederick on 21 June 1738 at a ceremony also held at Norfolk House by the Lord Bishop of Oxford Thomas Secker who earlier also performed the private baptism.[4] His Godfathers were the King of Sweden and the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, and his Godmother was the Queen of Prussia. [5]\n\nHe was second in line to the throne at birth (higher in the order of precedence than his father's siblings or his own elder sister) and became heir to the throne aged 13 upon his father's death in 1751. At that time, his grandfather officially confirmed the titles which were his father's and bestowed the title of Prince of Wales: [6]\n\nSt James's, April 20\n\nHis Majesty has been pleased to order Letters Patent... for creating His Royal Highness George William Frederick (the Prince of Great Britain, Electorial Prince of Brunswick Lunenburgh, Duke of Edenburgh [sic], Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham, Viscount of Lanceston, Baron of Snaudon and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter) Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.\n\nIn the same issue of the Gazette, the death and lying in state was announced of the King of Sweden, George's godfather.\n\nOn 25 October 1760 his grandfather King George II died at the age of 76 at Kensington Palace.\n\nOn the following day, 26 October, at a ceremony at Carleton House before the Lords of the Privy Council, George was declared\n\n\"George the Third by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith\" [7]\n\nHe was the first Hanoverian monarch to be born in England and to use English as his first language.\n\nHe would also be the last British monarch to lay a claim to the throne of France.\n\nHe was 22 years old.\n\nMarriage, family and private life\n\nGeorge married the 17 year old German aristocrat Princess Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz at an evening service on 8 September 1761 at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace, by the same Thomas Secker who had performed George's baptism, and was now Archbishop of Canterbury. They had not met before the arranged marriage. [8] [9] Three days later a Royal proclamation was issued that from forthwith all daily prayers in the Church of England litany and any \"publick service\" now had to include prayers for \"Our Gracious Queen Charlotte, Her Royal Highness, the Princess Dowager of Wales and all the Royal Family\" [9]\n\nWith the wedding complete, the couple were crowned King and Queen Consort at a ceremony at the \"Abbey Church in Westminster\" on 22 September 1761. [10]\n\nGeorge and Charlotte had fifteen children over a period of 21 years, thirteen of whom survived to adulthood. They included two future British monarchs, George IV and William IV.\n\nGeorge Augustus Frederick (Prince of Wales, Prince Regent and later King George IV) (1762 - 1830)\n\nFrederick Augustus Hanover Duke of York and Albany (1763 - 1827)\n\nWilliam Henry, later King William IV (1765 - 1837)\n\nCharlotte Augusta Matilda (1766 - 1828)\n\nEdward Augustus, father of Queen Victoria (1767 - 1820)\n\nAugusta Sophia (1768 - 1840)\n\nElizabeth (1770 - 1840)\n\nErnest Augustus, Elector of Hanover after the death of King William IV (1771 - 1851)\n\nAugustus Frederick (1773 - 1843)\n\nAdolphus Frederick (1774 - 1850)\n\nMary (1776 - 1857)\n\nSophia (1777 - 1848)\n\nOctavius (1779 - 1783)\n\nAlfred (1780 - 1782)\n\nAmelia (1783 - 1810)\n\nTwo boys, Octavius and Alfred died young.\n\nGeorge had no acknowledged mistresses during the time he was married, and no known illegitimate children. A story of a liaison with a married Quaker woman named Hannah Lightfoot who was said to have borne him up to three children, has no supporting evidence.\n\nGeorge purchased Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace) for his wife and commissioned the gold state coach seen in modern Royal events. He was the first king to formally study science and and took a keen interest in improving agricultural practices. This led to him acquiring the nickname \"Farmer George\" from his detractors. He started a new royal collection of books, 65,000 of which were later given to the British Museum. [11]\n\nGeorge as a Monarch\n\nAt his accession on 26 October 1760, George was the holder of four distinct Royal titles.\n\nKing of Great Britain - the unified crown of England, Scotland and Wales\n\nKing of Ireland\n\nKing of France\n\nElector of Brunswick-Lüneburg (German: Kurfürstentum Braunschweig-Lüneburg) titular leader of an Electorate situated in the modern day Germany.\n\nThe Acts of Union 1800 formally combined the crowns of Great Britain and Ireland and led to the formation of a new political entity - the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, now commonly abbreviated to the United Kingdom. This came into being on 1 January 1801 by proclamation of the King now styled \"George the Third by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith\". [12] This entity would last until 1922 when Ireland (apart from the 6 counties of the province of Ulster) gained its independence as a separate sovereign state.\n\nThe holder of the crown of England had laid a claim to the crown of France since the Treaty of Troyes in 1422 which gave the title to the heirs of Henry V. [13] Despite the French having an established monarchy of their own from this time onwards, the Kingdom of France was always part of the styling of the title of the monarch of England, and latterly of Great Britain.\n\nThe French Republic was established in 1792, and in peace negotiations to end the British-French war in 1797, the French demanded that the British monarch removed the title. No formal agreement was made, but at the Act of Union 1800, the new Royal coat of Arms no longer contained the French Fleur-de-lys. [14]\n\nThe Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg had been ruled in personal union with the crown of Great Britain since the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Union 1707. These acts ensured that the Protestant succession of the British crown would continue through the descendants of Electress Sophia of Hanover.\n\nIt was ruled by the Privy Council of Hanover (the capital city of the Electorate). George was ruler in name only - he never visited the place. [15]\n\nGeorge ruled in Great Britain as a Constitutional Monarch. [16] All governmental policies had to be agreed by Parliament, but the London Gazette (the official organ of British Governmental communication) shows that he and his sons were in regular attendance at Privy Council meetings.\n\nThese two following pieces of legislation introduced by George directly affected his family and the monarchs who were to succeed him.\n\nHe was party to the renegotiations of the terms of the Civil List payments by which the members of the Royal Family and their households are financed. In 1760 at the beginning of his reign, he exchanged the revenues from all his property (the Crown Estate) for a fixed yearly amount from Parliament. Parliament would, for the first time, be responsible for financing the costs of civil government which previously had been the responsibility of the monarch. [17] This Civil List negotiation has happened for every monarch of the United Kingdom since George's reign. [18]\n\nThe Royal Marriages Act 1772 or An Act for the Better Regulating of Future Marriages of the Royal Family was personally given royal assent by George in person at the Houses of Parliament on 1 April 1772. [19] This means of controlling the ability of the royal family to make \"unsuitable marriages\" was proposed by George after his brother Henry, Duke of Cumberland married the commoner Anne Horton. [20] [21]\n\nLater life and death\n\nFrom the age of 50 onwards, George was affected by a relapsing illness, possibly porphyria, which caused blindness and mental health problems.\n\nHis physical and mental conditions led to the establishment of a formal Regency in 1811. The Regent was his eldest son, the future George IV.\n\nSophia died in 1818 at the age of 74 years and was buried in the Royal Vault which George had commissioned at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. [22]\n\nWindsor, January 29, 1820\n\nTo the Right Honourable Viscount Sidmouth\n\nMy Lord\n\nIt becomes my painful duty to acquaint your Lordship that it has pleased Almighty God to take unto Himself the King, my Beloved Father, and Our Most Gracious and Excellent Sovereign - he expired at thirty five minutes past eight o'clock PM\n\nI am, My Lord, Yours most sincerely\n\nFREDERICK [Duke of York] [23]\n\nGeorge was 81 years old when he died. He was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Berkshire on 16 February 1820, in the Royal Vault with his wife Sophia and the three of their children who had predeceased them. [22]\n\nHistorical Events and Legacy\n\nThis biography does not attempt to comprehensively cover George's sixty year reign and the events both in Britain and abroad which shaped a rapidly changing world. There are plenty of good history books for that. Britain moved from being mainly agricultural to a full-on industrial revolution. There were frequent wars and revolution in Europe. The British Empire expanded and in some areas contracted.\n\nAs the British Sovereign throughout the American Revolutionary wars, George was identified by the Colonists as the figurehead of a British Parliament which denied them direct representation.\n\nThe transcript of the Declaration of Independence 4 July 1776 states: [24]\n\nThe history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\n[a list of grievances]\n\nA Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nIn Britain, King George III is now remembered as the Mad King, because of the play The Madness of George III (1991) by the English playwright Alan Bennett, afterwards the film The Madness of King George. [25]\n\nAfter his death, his personal library of nearly 64,000 books was donated to the newly created British Museum in 1823. Now it is housed in the British Library building at St Pancras, London in a six storey glass edifice known as the \"King's Library\". [26]\n\nHanover or Hannover or ... ?\n\nThis royal dynasty is known as the House of Hanover in Britain, from the name of the city capital of the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nIn the text of the Act of Settlement 1701 the name of the Electoress Sophia is spelled both Hanover and Hannover. [27]\n\nThe city is spelled Hannover in German.\n\nAll derivatives of the Royal name used in Britain and its colonies after the accession of George I spell the word Hanover (Hanover Square, Hanover County) with one ‘’N’’ .\n\nThe family name of the Electors of Hanover was Guelph or Welf. [28]\n\nThe Hanoverian monarchs styled themselves \"of Great Britain etc.\" or used their titles of nobility rather than a surname.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Baptism of George, son of the Prince of Wales in: Baptism register of St James, Piccadilly (St James, Westminster), Middlesex, England.
