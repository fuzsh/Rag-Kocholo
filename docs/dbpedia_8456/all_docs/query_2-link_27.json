        "text": "The first scene of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story opens with the titular character's brother, Adolphus Frederick IV, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Mirow. Charlotte spies him signing what we soon learn is her marriage contract to King George III.\n\nTunji Kasim, left, plays Queen Charlotte’s brother Adolphus in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.\n\nBut who was Adolphus in real life? Did he really sign her marriage contract? Here's everything you need to know about Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Duke Carl, Prince of Mirow.\n\nDuke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg—also known as Duke Carl, Prince of Mirow—and Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen had ten children (six of whom survived to adulthood). Queen Charlotte would later write in her memoirs of her parents, their \"union, as it was founded on mutual affection, never suffered from any caprice.\"\n\nAdolphus was born on May 5, 1738; Charles and Elisabeth's third child, and first son. \"All the children were born at Mirow,\" Charlotte writes, \"the palace of which bore a near resemblance to the castellated mansions of our old English nobility.\" His father was part of the Sterlitz branch of the House of Mecklenburg (hence Mecklenburg-Sterlitz), and when his uncle, Adolphus Frederick III, died without a heir, he became the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nHis succession was \"not a smooth and easy process,\" according to his biography on the official Mecklenburg-Sterlitz website. His mother, Princess Elisabeth, served as a regent for a year while he finished his studies.\n\nPer the Royal Collection Trust, Dr. Nugent, who visited his court in 1766, said, \"His chief diversion is doing good, in extending himself in acts of benevolence towards his subjects whose happiness seems to constitute the sole object of his ambition.\"\n\nHe organized the marriage of Queen Charlotte and King George III.\n\nDuring the Seven Years War, Adolphus had his principality neutral, but in 1761, he allied with the British when he signed the marriage contract for his younger sister, Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Sterlitz, to marry Britain's King George III. Per the royal family's official website, \"King [George III] announced to his council in July 1761 his intention to wed the Princess, after which a party of escorts, led by The Earl of Harcourt, departed for Germany to bring Princess Charlotte to England. They arrived on 14 August 1761 and were received by Charlotte's brother, the current Duke, and the marriage contract was signed.\"\n\nAlong with another brother, Adolphus accompanied Charlotte to England, and attended her wedding. Two years after Charlotte's wedding to George, he was invested as a knight of the Order of the Garter, the oldest order chivalry in Great Britain. After Queen Charlotte married, the two corresponded regularly. Queen Charlotte's seventh son, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, is named after him.\n\nHe never married.\n\nThere were rumors he was going to marry King George III's younger sister, Princess Louisa Anne, but due to her delicate health, the marriage contract was postponed and then she died at age 19 in 1769. In Queen Charlotte, he's shown to have a fictional romance with Lady Agatha Danbury—but as Lady Danbury is a fictional character, and so a relationship never happened.\n\nHe remained a bachelor his entire life. The Mecklenburg-Sterlitz website notes, he \"was not a typical prince of his era, as he was not interested in popular pursuits such as hunting or shooting, preferring to go for rides in his chariot around his domain.\"\n\nDuring his reign, he acquired estates, and loved throwing balls\n\nHe died at age 56 in Neusterlitz."
