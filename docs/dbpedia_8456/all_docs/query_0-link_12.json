AUTHOR’S NOTE When, in August 1955, I was invited to undertake this work, the private papers of Her Majesty the late Queen Mary had already been removed from Marlborough House to the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle, where they are still being catalogued. By gracious permission of Her Majesty the Queen I have been given unrestricted access to these papers, as well as to all other relevant material in the Royal Archives. These manuscript sources included: 1. Queen Mary’s Diaries, kept daily from 1891 until the year of her death, 1953. There is also a solitary volume for the year 1884. 2. The Diaries of King George V. 3. The letters exchanged between King George V and Queen Mary. 4. The Diaries and letters of Queen Victoria; the Journals and letters of Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck, and the letters of her husband, Francis, ist Duke of Teck; the letters of Princess Augusta Caroline, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, of King Edward VII, of Queen Alexandra, of the Empress Frederick, of Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and of other members of the Royal Family. 5. The letters of Queen Mary to her friends, returned to her upon their deaths. 6. The letters and papers of Prince Adolphus, 2nd Duke of Teck and, after 1917^ ist Marquess of Cambridge, deposited in the Royal Archives by his son, the present Marquess. I have also been kindly allowed to make use of certain material outside the Royal Archives, including: I. The Athlone Papers. These comprise letters of Queen Mary’s parents, of Queen Mary herself and oif her elder brothers, to Prince Alexander George of Teck, later Earl of Athlone. They are in the possession of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, who has generously allowed me to have access to them. 14 QUEEN MARY 2. The Papers of His Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor. These papers, which comprise the letters of King George V, of Queen Mary and of othei members of the Royal Family to the Duke of Windsor are in His Royal Highnesses possession in France, where he has given me every facility to work at them. 3. The Kronherg Archives. These consist of the letters of Queen Victoria to the Empress Frederick, as well as the Empress’s corre- spondence with her own children, and are preserved at Schloss Friedrichshof, Kronberg, near Frankfurt-am-Main. For permission to make use of these archives I am indebted to His Royal Highness, Prince Philip, Landgrave of Hesse (Cassel). These main sources of unpublished manuscript material I have supplemented by reference to further collections in private hands, the most notable being the papers of Mrs Charles Hunt, of the late Sir Dominic Colnaghi, and of the late Lady Bertha Dawkins. I have also consulted many published works on the history of the period covered by this book, as well as a considerable number of biographies and volumes of memoirs. Of these I should mention in particular the Memoir (in two volumes) of Queen Mary’s mother, the Duchess of Teck, by C. Kinloch Cooke, published in 1900; the Personal Memoir of King George V by Mr John Gore, and the Life and Reign of the same monarch by Sir Harold Nicolson; and the Life and Reign of King George VI by Sir John Wheeler-Bennett. The writer of a biography of a personage recently dead has one advantage over those writing about some figure in the remote past: he can consult, and speak with, the surviving relations, friends, and — in the case of Royalty — members of the staff of his subject. If I follow the discreet example of Mr Gore, Sir Harold Nicolson and Sir John Wheeler-Bennett and do not set down the names of all the many, many people who have helped me in this way, it is not for want of gratitude but simply that the list would be too long. I must, however, record the faultless kindness and assistance which I have received firom the members of Queen Mary’s family, both in this country and hroad. Only those who have been privileged to work in the Royal Archives - Windsor Castle can realise how much this book owes to the Eperience and the amiable personal interest of Sir Owen Morshead, now librarian Emeritus at Windsor, as well as to the patience and cGHoperation of his successor as Librarian and Deputy-Keeper of the AUTHOR^S NOTE I5 Royal Archives, Mr Robert Mackworth- Young and his staff, most notably Miss Leta Smith, Miss Hedley, Miss Price Hill, and Mrs Lawrence Morshead. For constructive but unsparing criticism, and for constant encouragement in my work on this book I am also vastly indebted to Sir Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary and Keeper of the Archives to King George VI and to Queen Elizabeth II. During the three years in which I have been working on this biography I have indeed been lucky to have had the assistance of Mrs Gordon Waterfield. Without the aid of Mrs Waterfield’s precision, power of concentration and total understanding of the book’s aims, it would never have appeared in its present form. I should also like to thank Mr Rudolf Kandaouroff for the exactitude with which he has prepared the genealogical tables and helped in many other ways during the writing of this book, as well as Miss Jillian Moore, of the Royal Geographical Society, for the skill with which she has drawn the map.

Written to the chatelaine of Reinthal by her only brother. Prince Teck, this letter told her that his wife, the former Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, was expecting their first child within a few weeks’ time. The doctors had predicted 26 May as the date for the birth. ‘I am looking over Kensington Palace’, wrote Prince Teck, in German, from his mother-in-law’s house at Kew, ‘as I want to be established there by at least the 6th. . . . Let us hope that a nice baby will be bom there in the lovely month of May.’^ Sure enough, with a precision that marked her actions throughout the course of her long life, the child did in fact appear in that lovely month and upon the very day the doctors named. The new baby was born just before midnight on 26 May, in the presence of her mother’s sister, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (who had driven across the Park from St James’s Palace) and of her mother’s close friends, the Duchesse d’Aumale and Lady Elizabeth Adeane. As the next day dawned over London, the Duchesse d’Aumale hastened off in her carriage through the flowery lanes of Kensington to Cambridge Cottage, Kew, there to give the first news of the birth to the child’s German grandmother, the old Duchess of Cambridge, whilst ‘Augusta Strelitz’ remained with her sister at Kensington. There had been considerable anxiety about the event, since Princess Mary Adelaide, a personage of unusual girth, was already thirty-three, an age then considered dangerous for the bearing of a first child. ‘Poor Mary,’ the Crown Princess Frederick had written to Queen Victoria from Berlin in December 1866, ‘it seems most alarming — ^with her size — and at her age — ^her prospects must fill her with fear.’^ M QUEEN MARY So soon as the public announcement was made that morning in London more than one thousand persons flocked towards Kensington Palace to inscribe their names. For though Prince Teck himself was still scarcely known in London, Princess Mary Adelaide (whom he had married in the previous June) had a multitude of friends amongst the limited circle of rich or aristocratic persons who then comprised ^General Society*. She had managed to combine this purely social popularity with a gift for inspiring a wild affectionate enthusiasm amongst the London crowd, which relished Tat Mary’s* stout, benevolent appearance and her jovial yet imperious manner. It was this gift which had never been entirely welcome to her first cousin, the retiring, six-years* widowed Queen. By 5 June Princess Mary Adelaide was well enough to write herself to her husband*s relatives at Reinthal: ‘I have indeed much to be thankful for, lying as I do here with Baby in her cradle by me, Francis with Ves* on his lap on the other side .*3 Because of the month in which the little girl was bom her doting mother would refer to her as 'my May-flower* or, more simply, 'May*. The spring name caught. Long after she had married, in fact until the year in which her husband ascended the throne of England, the girl bom on 26 May 1867, at Kensington Palace, was known affectionately to her friends and to the English public as ‘Princess May*. Word of Princess May’s birth was immediately telegraphed to Queen Victoria, who was in the midst of her spring seclusion at Balmoral. But, prolific in royal circles, this spring of 1867 had already produced other infant competitors for the Queen’s attention. At Marlborough House the Princess of Wales had given birth to a daughter, Louise, on 20 February, while Queen Victoria’s own child Helena had just been delivered of a son, 'Christie*. It was this latter, Schleswig-Holstein, boy who was currently absorbing all the Queen’s eager attention. Cousin Mary Teck’s girl inevitably took second, if not third, place. 'Mary T[eck] is going on perfectly well (to everyone’s astonishment) & it is a very fine child’, the Queen wrote cursorily to the Crown Princess Frederick on 2 June. 'However nothing can beat Lenchen’s Boy — ^who one really sees grow daily — He is a splendid fellow.’f 4 In after years, when Princess May had * ‘Yes* was Princess Mary Adelaide’s small dog. f ICnown in the family as ‘Lenchen’, Helena, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, was the third daughter and fifth child of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort. Born in 184(3, she married Christian, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein- A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 25 married the heir-presumptive to the throne, Queen Victoria would dwell upon the coincidence by which the girl had been born two days after the Queen's own birthday and, as she herself had been, at Kensington. 1 like to feel your birthday is so near mine, that you were born in the same House as I was & that you bear my name. It is very curious that it should be so ',5 she wrote to her, for instance, in May 1896. But at the actual time the arrival of the Teck baby made little impact upon Queen Victoria, nor was she struck by its coincidental aspect. She nevertheless wrote to the mother with that genuine kind- ness that often characterised her behaviour, from Balmoral, on 4 June: I send you today a quilt wh. Lenchen, Louise & I have worked for you (our names are put into it) with much pleasure and send you today [^fc] hoping you may use it on your sofa. I need not repeat to you, my dearest Mary how truly ^ really happy I have been at your safe & prosperous confine- ment & the birth of your little girl. I have known & loved you dearly from your earliest infancy — my darling Husband was very fond of you — & your happiness has ever been very near my heart — & therefore my joy at this event is most sincere. Could my own dearest Husband but have witnessed it & be able to join me in visiting you at my poor old Home!^ The Queen had often had before, and was to have again, occasions to complain of her Cambridge cousin's dilatory habits in answering letters* once Princess Mary Adelaide got going on one of her volu- minous ‘journal-letters' few, if any, of her contemporaries in England could surpass her talent for amusing description, but it was the effort to begin a letter which daunted her, and the Queen was sometimes chagrined to find that her own missives were never given any special priority over the mass of general correspondence which flooded Princess Mary Adelaide's work-tables at Kensington Palace and at White Lodge. It was thus not until a fortnight later, and with an excuse which was somewhat lame, that Princess Mary sent her thanks for the Queen's present: With a rather shaky hand and my feet under your quilt, [she wrote on 18 June] I take up for the first time my pen, to thank you, and that warmly and lovingly, for your charming gift, which I prize more than I can express as the joint work of those very dear to me; as well as for all your kind and tender interest in my safety and well-doing and pleasure at the birth of our dear little girl, whom I quite long to present to you. . . . with grateful Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1831-1917) in 1866 and died in 1923. Their first child, Christian Victor, known as ‘Christie’, died in the South African War in 1900. 26 QUEEN MARY messages and love to Helena and Louise for their share in the couvrepied^ I remain ever, in fond gratitude for all your sisterly kindness, Your devoted and most affectionate Cousin Mary Adelaide.7 Back at Windsor in June, Queen Victoria made one of her expedi- tions to London — rare at that period — to inspect the rival babies at Marlborough House and at Kensington. Princess Louise, the Prince of Wales’s first daughter,* was pronounced to be a ‘poor little Baby’ with a cough, and not to ‘look very strong’. At five o’clock on the same day on which she had thus confirmed her private theory that the Wales children were liable to be undersized and ‘pigeon-breasted’ (‘the race will be a puny one which would have distressed darling Papa’ she had written on an earlier occasion to her eldest daughter and confidante, the Crown Princess Frederick!^) the Queen set off again from Buckingham Palace, headed this time westwards in an open carriage and four through ‘the densely crowded Park to see dear Mary Teck. It seemed so strange’, she noted in her Journal ‘to drive into the old courtyard and to get out at the door, the very knockers of which were old friends. My dear old home, how many memories it evoked walking through the well-known rooms !’ Going up to the top of the house, to the big light bedroom in which she and her mother had slept in the years before her accession to the throne, the Queen there found Princess Mary Adelaide, ‘Aunt Cambridge’, and the baby. This last proved ‘a very fine child, with quantities of hair — ^brushed up into a curl on the top of its head! — & very pretty features & a dark skin’. Seen again nearly a year later ‘Mary T’s baby’ seemed ‘a dear merry healthy Child, but not as handsome as she ought to be’.9 For the moment, however, the Kensington Palace infant seemed in every way superior to that lying in its bassinet at Marl- borough House. On this first visit to a child for whom, many years later, she was * Louise, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, bom 1867, died 1931, married Alexander, Duke of Fife (1849-1912), in 1889. The third child and first daughter of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and his wife Alexandra, Princess Louise was created Princess Roj^ in 1905. •f Victoria, Princess Royal, bom 1840, died 1901, was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort. In 1858 she had married Frederick, Crown Prince of Pmssia, who succeeded his father Wilhelm I as German Emperor and King of Prussia in 1888 and died ninety-nine days later of cancer of the throat. Queen Victoria’s bi-weekly letters to this eldest daughter are preserved at Schloss Friedrichshof, Kronberg, and the Empress Frederick’s replies are in the Royal Ardiives at Windsor Castle. A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 2.7 develop a high admiration^ the Queen was told of the burden of ^^mes provisionally selected for the baby to carry through life: Agnes ^ugusta Victoria Mary Louise Olga Pauline Claudine. ‘Agnes after ^ranz’s grandmother\"\", she diligently noted, ‘and Claudine after his pother, Augusta after Aunt Cambridge and Augusta Strelitz, and \"Victoria after me. I am to be one of the godparents.\"^® But when the j^aby was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Kensington palace on 27 July, the sequence of names had been for some reason j-earranged. The list now read Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga pauline Claudine Agnes. It seems likely that this new dispensation -^as the result of a determined effort by the old Duchess of Cambridge ^nd her elder daughter the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Princess Louise, the Prince of Wales’s first daughter,* was pronounced to be a 'poor little Baby’ with a cough, and not to 'look very strong’. At five o’clock on the same day on which she had thus confirmed her private theory that the Wales children were liable to be undersized and 'pigeon-breasted’ ('the race will be a puny one which would have distressed darling Papa’ she had written on an earlier occasion to her eldest daughter and confidante, the Crown Princess Frederick!^) the Queen set off again from Buckingham Palace, headed this time westwards in an open carriage and four through 'the densely crowded Park to see dear Mary Teck. It seemed so strange’, she noted in her Journal 'to drive into the old courtyard and to get out at the door, the very knockers of which were old friends. My dear old home, how many memories it evoked walking through the well-known rooms!’ Going up to the top of the house, to the big light bedroom in which she and her mother had slept in the years before her accession to the throne, the Queen there found Princess Mary Adelaide, 'Aunt Cambridge’, and the baby. This last proved 'a very fine child, with quantities of hair — brushed up into a curl on the top of its head! — & very pretty features & a dark skin’. Seen again nearly a year later 'Mary T’s baby’ seemed 'a dear merry healthy Child, but not as handsome as she ought to be’.9 For the moment, however, the Kensington Palace infant seemed in every way superior to that lying in its bassinet at Marl- borough House. On this first visit to a child for whom, many years later, she was * Louise, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, bom 1867, died 1931, married Alexander, Duke of Fife (1849-1912), in 1889. The third child and first daughter of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and his wife Alexandra, Princess Louise was created Princess Royal in 1905. t Victoria, Princess Royal, bom 1840, died 1901, was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort. In 1858 she had married Frederick, Crown Prince of Prussia, who succeeded his father Wilhelm I as German Emperor and King of Prussia in 1888 and died ninety-nine days later of cancer of the throat. Queen Victorians bi-weekly letters to this eldest daughter are preserved at Schloss Friedrichshof, Kxonberg, and the Empress Frederick’s replies are in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle. A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 27 to develop a high admiration, the Queen was told of the burden of names provisionally selected for the baby to carry through life: Agnes Augusta Victoria Mary Louise Olga Pauline Claudine. Agnes after Franz’s grandmother’, she diligently noted, ‘and Claudine after his mother, Augusta after Aunt Cambridge and Augusta Strelitz, and Victoria after me. I am to be one of the godparents.’^o But when the baby was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Kensington Palace on 27 July, the sequence of names had been for some reason rearranged. The list now read Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes. It seems likely that this new dispensation was the result of a determined effort by the old Duchess of Cambridge and her elder daughter the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. To both of these ladies the child’s direct descent from King George III and her kinship with the reigning sovereign of Great Britain were far more significant than her morganatic Wurttemberg and RhMey ancestry on her father’s side. According to this, the official Cambridge view. Prince Teck was indeed fortunate to have been allowed to marry a Princess of Great Britain and Ireland; for after the wedding they chose to forget their secret satisfaction at getting Princess Mary Adelaide married off at all.

Nor was it to be, by a long way, the last. II We now tend to think of Queen Victoria in matriarchal terms, as head of a numerous family of English and German descendants. Yet when she first came. to the throne, and indeed until her children had grown up and married, she had only three collaterals of her own generation in England* — ^the Cambridge cousins. These cousins were * Her fourth collateral, George Prince of Cumberland (King of Hanover, 1851), bom 1819, died 1878, was the son of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland 28 QUEEN MARY the children of the Queen’s uncle, Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge^ seventh son of George III. In the near-panic* caused by Princess Charlotte’s death in 1817 (an event which suddenly left the English throne with no direct heir in the third generation) the Duke of Cambridge had married Augusta, Princess of Hesse, a daughter of Friedrich, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, and his wife Caroline, Princess of Nassau-Usingen. They had lived for many years in Hanover, where the Duke was Viceroy, returning to England at Queen Victoria’s accession when Hanover was separated from the English Crown. There had thus been a brief period — between the death of William IV in 1837 and the birth of Queen Victoria’s first child, the Princess Royal, in 1840 — in which the Cambridge family were very high lip in the line of succession to the English throne. Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, had died in 1850 and was succeeded in the Dukedom by his only son, George. This, the second and the last Duke of Cambridge, bom in 1819, is remembered as having held the position of Commander-in-Chief of the British Army for a span of thirty-nine years, during which he consistently opposed every sug- gestion for modernisation or reform. In 1847 he had bewildered his mother and his sisters by contracting a private marriage with an actress, Louisa Fairbrother. Miss Fairbrother was subsequently known as Mrs FitzGeorge and bore the Duke three FitzGeorge sons, upon whom their little Teck cousins were taught to look askance; Despite this marriage, Queen Victoria continued on excellent terms with the Duke of Cambridge. His sisters she treated with a certain reserve, whilst their mother, ‘Aunt Cambridge’, inspired her with no special affection. The Duchess of Cambridge was a large, stately German lady, with a heavy, rather coarse face, and thick black eyebrows which gave her what her niece Victoria called ‘a severity of expression’. She wore shiny black pomatum on her hair, which was turned sleekly in beneath (1771-1851), who became King of Hanover in 1837 and, as fifth son of George III, was (to the nation^s horror) Queen Victoria’s heir-presumptive until the birth of her first child, Victoria, Princess Royal. * Of the seven sons of George IH who survived infancy three, at the date of Princess Charlotte’s death, were bachelors, and the four who were married were either childless or without lawful issue. Three rapid marriages were arrmged: Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, m. Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, 7 May 1818; Edward, Duke of Kent, m. Victoria of Saxe-Cobiurg-Saalfeld, widow of Prince Emidi-Charles of Leiningen, 29 May i8i8 ; and William, Duke of Clarence (afterwards William IV)> m. Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, ii June 1818. A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 29 an elaborate cap. Some people thought her proud and haughty, while others judged her ‘one of those exceptional people who had the gift of winning hearts\"*^* She spoke English with a strong German accent. She was clever rather than highly educated, and had what was then called ‘a sense of fun*. In her own household she was rated to have a perfect temper, to think of herself last, and to be remarkably indus- trious, since she liked knitting or doing needlework while her lady read to her aloud. Essentially formidable, and, in her latter years, a permanent invalid, the Duchess never succeeded in winning the hearts of her grandchildren, who resented the hours they had to spend in her rooms at St James’s Palace, and who remembered to their dying day her ‘stingy teas’ of buns and rusks. Writing from Frogmore in 1909 to her Aunt Augusta Strelitz, Princess May reflected upon her own fear of her grandmother, the old Duchess of Cambridge : I still meet older people sometimes who knew dear Grandmama & invariably talk so nicely of her. I wish I had been older to appreciate her properly, but in spite of her great kindness to us we were always rather afraid of her. ... I know that if ever we had a chance of talking to her alone we loved listening to her interesting reminiscences but these talks were few and far between .^3 To which her aunt replied that she wished: You had been able really to know Grandmama; as it was you could not get in real contact wdth her, besides she looked and could be rather severe, wi'di her firm old notions and principles, though her heart ever was fall of love for all her belongings. . . .^4 In 1843 Duchess of Cambridge had successfully married oifher elder daughter, Princess Augusta Caroline, to the son and heir of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whose wife, the Grand Duchess Marie, had been a Princess of Hesse and was own sister to the Duchess of Cambridge herself. This marriage between first cousins meant that the elder Cambridge sister went to live in Strelitz, and, though she came over to London with her husband almost annually, and was on occasion importunate about having rooms of her own at St James’s (which Queen Victoria refused to give her) or about crossing the Channel, as the Queen’s daughters did, in a private steamer, she ceased to impinge greatly upon the Queen’s consciousness. In early days Princess Augusta Caroline had indeed caused Queen Victoria annoyance: ‘she was altogether very jealous of my position in Society, as being very popular’ Princess Augusta recalled in old 30 QUEEN MARY age, in another letter to her niece Princess May in which she recounted ‘a scene I had with the Queen at a small Ball in the Gallery during the Tsarevitch Alexander’s stay in London, when he was more attentive to me than to her’* On her side Princess Augusta could not forgive the fact that ‘Albert’s German influence’ had caused the title ‘Princess of Great Britain and Ireland’ to be changed, in the case of the Cambridge sisters, to ‘Princess of Cambridge^ — ‘giving to each the Fathers title for a family name, which is perfectly wrong ’.^5 For Princess Augusta Caroline harboured strong feelings about her status as a granddaughter of George III: ‘The Grand Duchess of Mecklen- burg’, wrote Queen Sophie of Holland in 1867,^^ ‘is one of those who keep themselves in hot water about their rank and cannot bear the second place. ... I always wonder when clever people dwindle away their lives with such petty preoccupations.’ Eight years after Princess Augusta’s marriage, her younger sister Mary Adelaide made her debut, at the age of seventeen, at the official opening of the Great Exhibition. Chaperoned by the Queen’s mother, the Duchess of Kent, she wore white roses ‘with long branches of a lovely feathery kind of flower’ on her head.^? Soon she and her mother were, in Lord Redesdale’s word, ‘the only members of the Royal Family who were seen in general society’ where ‘their presence always gave pleasure. They were so gracious and unaffectedly gratified at any attempt to entertain them.’^^ Since she did not marry until 1866 there were fifteen long years — ^fifteen crowded London seasons — during which Princess Mary Adelaide and her mother (‘the stout parties from Kew’, as Lord Clarendon irreverently called them^ 9 ) moved freely in Tory society in the metropolis. They themselves gave musical parties, small dances or receptions for the diplomatic corps at St James’s Palace or at Cambridge Cottage, a pretty, simple house with hand- some rooms for entertaining tacked on to it, on Kew Green. In this way ‘the Cambridges’ seemed to display a genial aspect of Royalty which was in contrast to the more formal atmosphere of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, where the emphasis lay on the serious and the domestic sides of royal and family life. Theirs was a happy, kindly existence. It was filled with high-spirited gaiety. A large part of it was devoted to various practical charities. It was almost entirely independent of the Court. This independence sometimes went too far, and was judged to amount to carelessness, if not to disrespect, as on an occasion in F^Druary 1863 when Princess Mary Adelaide, by omitting to attend A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 3I a Drawing-Room, failed to perform her duty as a member of the Royal Family. Whilst Her Majesty is always anxious to live upon the most friendly terms with the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Mary [Sir Charles Phipps was told to write to Lord Granville, selected as a go-between in this ‘unpleasant matter’] Her Majesty considers it to be a duty, from which She may not shrink, to maintain her own proper position, and to require those marks of proper respect and attention from all the members of the Royal family, which have always been acknowledged to be due, and which were always most Strictly insisted upon by Her Royal Uncles. Lord Granville was asked to see the Duke of Cambridge and to remonstrate with him over his sister’s behaviour; upon which the Duke ‘alluded to the little the Duchess of Cambridge had seen of the Queen, and to their not knowing even now whether they were to be invited to the Castle, excepting for the marriage’.*^® It is episodes such as this which explain Queen Victoria’s attitude of comparative detachment over the birth of her cousin’s first child. Princess May. Six months after their baby’s birth, Princess Mary Adelaide and her husband were asked to dine and sleep at Windsor Castle one November night. It was thus that, in her long withdrawal from active life after the death of the Prince Consort, the Queen would from time to time summon those relations whom she wished to see. ‘She is alas! grown enormous & has never recovered her strength’, the Queen reported of her cousin, to Berlin, ‘ — ^but they are very happy together; the Baby had a cold & cld therefore not come.’ A fortnight later they were asked again, this time for two nights. They brought with them ‘their little Baby — a dear spritely little thing — ^but not a fine or a remarkably handsome Child; but I am sure she will he pretty’, wrote the Queen, adding: ‘It is a real pleasure to see dear Mary now — she is so bright & happy & also her fine qualities come out to such advantage now that she is happy. But her siie is fearful! It is really a misfortune.’^^ ASHOKN A C A R, HYSi Like most diminutive persons. Queen Victoria found anyone very muph larger than herself a trifle oppressive. Yet there was no exag- ^ i.e., the marriage of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, celebrated at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, 10 March 1863. QUEEN MARY 32 geration in her references to her cousin Mary Adelaide’s obesity. This handicap had long rendered Princess Mary Adelaide a problem piece upon the family chessboard: a Princess who had remained so long unmarried as to have begun to seem unmarriageable. When, therefore, in April 1866, Princess Mary Adelaide had accepted Prince Teck’s offer of marriage (made in the Rhododendron Walk in Kew Gardens after what her sister called an ‘incredibly short’ acquaintanceship), the Queen and her whole family had breathed a sigh of relief. For it was supposed that several previous suitors from the Continent had been deterred by their first glimpse of Princess Mary’s appearance. The tragedy about this appearance, for a proud and intelligent girl, had been the sense that had she not been thoroughly stout she might have been distinctly beautiful. She was tall, and had ash-blonde hair with a pretty, natural wave in it, dark blue eyes fringed by dark lashes beneath dark brows, ‘a creamy complexion’, a sweet expression and beautiful teeth. She would look her best in a mourning dress, cut low at the bosom, with black garnets ‘sparkling like black diamonds on her white neck’.^^ In 1857, when she was twenty-four, the American Minister to the Court of St James’s estimated that this ‘very fat, very thick-set and very proud young lady’ must weigh at least two hundred and fifty pounds .^3 Another witness who sat near her in the theatre described her afterwards as ‘that moimtain of a girl’, whilst the flippant world of the aristocracy referred to her as ‘our domestic Embonpoint’. Surrey neighbours spoke of the way that the springs of a carriage would ‘groan’ as she entered it. Young officers were admired for the skill with which they could steer Princess Mary Adelaide through a complicated dance. Once, at a great ball at Orleans House, Twickenham, Princess Mary Adelaide, ‘looking splendidly handsome with a wreath of purple grapes round her wavy hair’, and dancing the Lancers with the Comte de Paris as partner, had collided with another girl and knocked her ‘flat down’ on her back .^4 Princess Mary Adelaide was very fond of clothes and jewellery. Her favourite colour was blue, though as a young girl she often wore white, and went to one of her first Drawing-Rooms at Buckingham Palace in a crinoline trimmed with scarlet poppies and with scarlet poppies ‘at the side of her*head below the plumes and falling amongst the folds of the gold-spangled white tulle veil ’ .^5 Members of Princess Mary Adelaide’s family were painfully aware of the problems posed by her size. When the Empress Eugenie had suggested that ‘la Princesse Marie de Cambridge’ should marry Prince A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 33 Oscar of Sweden, Queen Victoria replied that Prince Oscar ^ pour r ait ne pas etre content de se trouver engage a une jeime Princesse . . . qui^ quoique bien belle^ spirituelle et bien instruite et possedant un excellent coeur est cependant plus forte que la plupart des jeunes dames de son dge?^ ‘Meyer says that he knows both a horse and saddle which will suit you ’, ^7 the Queen wrote tactfully to her cousin in 1853, when urging her to take riding lessons in Windsor Great Park. When the Duchess of Cambridge (travelling incognita as Lady Culloden) looked in on King Leopold on her way through Brussels in 1852, the old King scribbled off to his niece Queen Victoria: 1 found her extremely well and very curious, as usual, but poor Mary, such a beautiful child, is grown out of all Compass^ to my great regret. Leopold, who is all longitude, was her neighbour and looked quite alarmed.’^^ Princess Mary Adelaide was at this time seventeen. Photographs confirm these contemporary judgements, as do the memories of those still living who knew Princess Mary as Duchess of Teck. These eye-witnesses recall the Princess’s quick, graceful movements, despite her bulk,- the nimble way she stepped down from a carriage, the easy gesture with which she would give her hand to be kissed. It was a part of her charm that she herself made jokes about her weight and would allow small relatives to test it on her velvet- covered scales, or spontaneously demonstrate a tarantella to the dancing-class to which her daughter went. No member of the Royal Family could wave so valiantly from a carriage, and in any royal procession she was certain of the longest and the loudest cheer. Children adored her, for she was easy-going and high-spirited, impulsive and generous, and had no idea of time. This notorious unpunctuality, together with a total lack of any sense for money, were the cause of many of the troubles which her children shared and witnessed in their youth. They may be taken as the direct psycho- logical reason for her daughter’s equally notorious punctiliousness about time and for her sense of order. Her own letters, which, once begun, might run on for thirty or more pages, offer the surest evidence of Princess Mary Adelaide’s exceptional, and wholly delightful, qualities of head and heart. Queen Victoria, however, was both more sedate and more care- worn than her younger cousin. High spirits were never the key to the Queen’s heart and, at a period when she herself had chosen virtually to disappear from public gaze, Princess Mary’s popularity seemed ostentatious and almost deliberately sought. What were in fact a B 34 QUEEN MARY genuine love of human beings, a compassionate reaction to want in any form, and a happy wish to please, were misinterpreted by the Queen and her immediate family. ‘Mary is very popular, and justly so,’ the Empress Frederick wrote to her mother in 1891, ‘still I think she courts popularity perhaps more than sisters would care to do, — but I may be wrong ! ’*9 The project for Princess Mary Adelaide to marry Prince Oscar, the second surviving son* of the King of Sweden and Norway, had, as we know, been invented by the Empress Eugdnie, who first put it forward in a private letter to Queen Victoria in April 1 856 : '’J'ai pensi ifi dans mon petit coin que la Princesse Marie de Cambridge a vingt- deux ans et que leurs ages et leurs positions riciproqucs vont bien en- semble et si cette petite combinaison convenait a Votre Majestd je me rejouirais d’ avoir eu une ided qui put contribuer au bonhcur d'un mcmhre de Votre famillel'i^ Queen Victoria had thereupon suggested that Prince Oscar and Princess Mary Adelaide had better meet. He came to London, saw her several times, and withdrew to Paris without having proposed. Further discreet enquiries revealed that he had no wish to marry Princess Mary, and in the following year he proposed to, and was accepted by, Sophie, Princess of Nassau. Five months later, in September 1856, the fashionable Italian sculptor Marochetti, who had been much impressed by Princess Mary when she gave him sittings for a bust, was empowered by Cavour to bring her an official offer of marriage from the King of Sardinia. Passed on, with the Queen’s sanction, to Princess Mary, who was then with her mother in Baden, this offer was refused by her on religious grounds : ‘how would the announcement of the marriage of an English Princess (a Guelph) with a papist Sovereign be taken by John Bull.'’’ she asked her brother. 3 i The Duchess of Cambridge, who shared Lord Clarendon’s fear that, to the Piedmontese, Princess Mary Adelaide might appear ‘as a sort of Anne Boleyn’, supported her daughter in her refusal. The Duchess was convinced that, once in Turin, Princess Mary would be poisoned by the Jesuits. This Sardinian tentative had at least the merit of being a genuine offer of marriage genuinely refused. It thus compensated somewhat for the mortification felt by Princess Mary Adelaide at the failure of Prince Oscar to come up to the mark — a failure known to London Society. * Prince Oscar (1829-1907) succeeded his elder brother Charles XV as King of Sweden and Norway in 1872. It was as King Oscar 11 that he renounced th® throne of Norway, which then became a separate kingdom, in 1905. A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 35 Three years Before this, in 18535 the Queen and the Prince Consort, as well as the Duchess of Cambridge herself, had been disturbed at a secret feeler put out by Napoleon III that Princess Mary should marry his^ profligate cousin Napoleon, son of ex-King Jerome. On this occasion, also, religion had been pleaded as the reason for a refusal. In the light of this and of the Sardinian offer the Queen then decreed that no more Catholics could be considered, even were it the Archduke Leopold, whom the Crown Princess Frederick at one time put forward as a candidate: he is popular & bears a good reputation wh. with me goes before the rest’.3* Other bridegrooms thought of over the years included Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Brunswick (strongly favoured by Queen Victoria: ‘The Duke of Brunswick is the match for her & I wish we could bring it about’33), the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, Prince William of Baden, Prince Waldemar of Holstein, Prince Nicholas of Nassau and Prince William of Hesse-Philippstlial-Barchfeld. ‘Alas!’ declared Lord Clarendon, who was personally sympathetic towards Princess Mary Adelaide and was always anxious to help her, ‘no German Prince will venture on so vast an imdertaking.’l^ Another factor was Princess Mary’s manner, which stiff German princelings did not like. Recounting for Queen Victoria’s benefit a conversation she had with Princess Mary Adelaide’s brother in Berlin in September 1858, the Crown Princess of Prussia summed up this feeling: Uncle George . . . said also that when foreign Princes came to your Court, her Behaviour put him out a good deal; that she laughed & talked a gt. deal too much with other gentlemen, which together with her being so very tall & stout rather frightens people, he said a good deal of this was nervous- ness with her, & as she is no longer a child she cannot help being ‘prioccupie’ with the idea of her future, & that makes her manner still less quiet & natural.35 Princess Mary herself now expressed ‘a horror’ of life at small German courts and stated categorically that she had no wish to leave her country. She was once or twice suspected of an emotion about some member of the English peerage, and was even thought to have proposed to Lord Skelmersdale, who was himself in love with his future wife. Lord Clarendon’s favourite daughter Alice. But some such practical solution as this was likewise forbidden by the Queen, who considered that in such a union Princess Mary Adelaide ‘would haidly have been able for many reasons to maintain her rank’ 36 — a 34 qVEkN MARY genuine love of human beings, a citinp.i«».«.iuiwif rr Xi 1 1 i'S 'I M * li, liiv f I) \\ ?

His dark good looks stirred the Queen to envy, for in a letter to the Crown Princess of Prussia describing his Osborne visit she continued: I do -wish one cld find some more black eyed Pees or Pcesses for our Children ! — can’t help thinking what dear Papa said — that it was in fact a blessing when there was some little imperfection in the pure Royal descent & that some fresh blood was infused.

I must end for today, my somewhat odd letter, but it is not as trivial as you may think for darling Papa — often with vehemence said: ‘We must have some strong dark hloodl What (Queen Victoria forgot, and Princess Mary Adelaide did not yet know, is that persons with strong, dark blood are sometimes subject to strong, dark rages. There were many occasions during her thirty- one years of married life when Princess Mary might well have wished that her husband had been a little more ‘lymphatic’. At a later period, when Prince Teck came under rather heavy fire from his wife’s family on account of her well-known extravagance, some of his own friends like Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar declared that he had been ‘regularly dragged into’ the marriage by the Cam- bridges. He himself, when driven hard, once remarked that, had he wished, he could have married an English north-country heiress with eighty thousand pounds a year instead of Princess Mary.42 It is only fair to the Cambridge family to remember that, while they welcomed Teck with open arms, the original initiative had been his, not theirs. In this he had been abetted by the Prince and Princess of Wales, who had taken a fancy to him on the Continent early in 1865. ‘You see, they all wanted to find a husband for my Mother’, Queen Mary once explained to someone who asked her how her father had first come to this country. ‘So once when Kang Edward (then Prince of Wales) was out in Vienna he met this handsome young officer in the Austrian Army, liked him, invited him to England on a visit, intro- duced him to my Mother — and everyone seemed to think it would doH-r-and it did.’ PtSneiSSs Hekma’s busbaini, Prince Chrisdan of Schkswig-Holstein: see A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 39 At the moment of Prince Teck’s arrival in England on this specula- tive visit, in March 1866 , Princess Mary Adelaide would, in the normal . course, still have been disporting herself in her brother-in-law’s little northern German capital of Neu Strelitz, where she had been helping her sister the Grand Duchess Augusta to improvise the-datisants and dinner-parties, musical evenings, private theatricals and a highly successful charity bazaar. The Grand Duke and his wife lived in one part of the square old Schloss which stood facing the cobbled central Plati of the town; while in another part ‘Tante Marie’, the Dowager Grand Duchess, at once Princess Augusta’s aunt and mother-in-law, held her small, stiff, separate court. Winters in Strelitz were fierce and set in early, with snow knee-deep around the town and great crystal squares cut from the lakes to fill the ice-houses of those who wished to entertain. The linden trees would glitter in the sun, looking, as the Grand Duke said, ‘like currants well sugared’. Boar-hunting was in full swing about the countryside; and in the sedate, well- heated houses of the town, with their cheerful, big porcelain stoves, simple and charming gaieties whiled away the long cold months before the spring. Princess Mary had tried hard to please, this winter at Neu Strelitz. ‘She is certainly changed’, the Grand Duchess wrote to their brother, the Duke of Cambridge, in the tone of grudging approval usually adopted by elder sisters or brothers about some younger one: ‘she nearly worked herself to death for that tiresome bazaar . . . and nothing would stop her’ ,43 The Cambridges’ plan was to keep Princess Mary in ignorance of the ‘T’ project: ‘Mama writes me word that I am to bring her back or send her by the middle of next month {pour cause)\\ the Grand Duchess wrote in another letter to her brother: ‘now that is very well but how is it to be managed.^ without giving her a reason.^ . . . Do you really think it may do.^ with the difference of years, no money, name or position.^’ ‘May it succeed, as our last chance, provided she likes him,’ she wrote again, some days later, ‘it would indeed be an excellent thing to settle her in life; she bears no restraint whatever, & becomes more difficult to manage every day, so both for her & most particularly for Mama it would be of the greatest importance to get her settled down by herself.’ ‘You must remember’, she wrote prophetically, ‘that she is more spoilt than either you or me, & that she requires more to live upon than we do, whose tastes and requirements are simpler than hers.’44 In justice to Princess Mary Adelaide it should here be remarked that her sister the 40 QUEEN MARY Grand Duchess Augusta was famously parsimonious, a trait inherited from their mother. On the disingenuous excuse that her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, could no longer get on without her. Princess Mary Adelaide was despatched to London from Neu Strelitz towards the end of February, in the charge of an apple-cheeked Hofdame of the Grand Ducal court, Frau Willichen Schreve. ‘The sample of Strelitz beauty that is to accompany Mary to England — ^for indeed she could not travel without a lady — ^is not what I could have wished to have exhibited there, but she is an excellent creature & will not be seen much ’, 45 wrote the Grand Duchess; for to royalties in that bygone era the gift for ‘not being seen much’ and ‘not being really in the way’ was a first qualification for the often unrewarding position of lady-in-waiting. Prince Teck reached London in mid-March. On lo April he and Princess Mary became engaged. The Duke of Cambridge wrote ‘a dear funny letter’ describing this event to his Strelitz sister, who replied with alacrity: Since I have received your different letters, Mary’s, Mama’s, yours, I fed perfectly reassured & happy that it should be as it is, and indeed, we can wish her & ourselves joy that this marriage has been settled! Who would have thoi^t it possible and in so short a time too 1 To me it is like a dream !

The Grand Duchess wrote that Tritz’ was strongly against their asking the King of Wiirttemberg for a dukedom, since he would not wish to grant it, and that in any case Princess Mary’s own title was superior to anything that they could glean from the little court of Wiirttemberg. He also suggested that if they became Duke and Duchess of Wiirttemberg they would need more money, because ‘more would be expected’ of them. ‘As P, of Teck he is the charming & agreeable husband of Princess Mary et voila tout\\ this wise message ended. 4 S 'Et voila tout ' — there was the rub, there the seed of much dissension. Prince Teck had spent his life in the Austrian Army, from which he had just resigned. He was not a brilliant man but he did not care for a life of idleness. Yet, save for a brief and rather inglorious participation in the Egyptian campaign of 1882, he was never allowed, in England, to make himself of any use. Disraeli, who had a wide imaginative grasp of affairs, once put forward the proposal that the Tecks should go as Viceroy and Vicereine to Ireland, on the theory recurrent to Victorian statesmen, but always rejected by the Queen herself, that the presence in Ireland of a member of the Royal Family might help to conciliate that turbulent island. The Queen had refused to consider this proposal: and the Duke of Teck was left to his diurnal pastimes of gardening at White Lodge, choosing wallpapers and brocades, collecting Chinese pottery, moving the furniture around, helping his wife to entertain, and arranging the jewels on her person and the flowers in her hair. This, in spite of his strong and genuine affection for his family, was not a fulfilling life. It was to be predicted that as he became older he would become more restless and more irritable, and that — a minor German royalty who was not even quite a royalty — he should increasingly attach an almost incredible impor- tance to such trivia as precedence and rank. ‘There is a dreadful * Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar (1823-1902) was the son of Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach by his wife Ida, Princess of Saxe-Coburg-Meiningen, a sister of Queen Adelaide. Bom at Bushy Park, Prince Edward made his career in the British Army, and, in 1851, made a morganatic marriage with Lady Augusta Gordon-Lennox, who was called Countess of Domburg in Germany, but, by virtue of a decree of Queen Victoria's, ranked in England as Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar. Friends of the Tecks, the Weimars had a house in Portland Place. They had no children. B* 42 QUEEN MARY feud going on between [Leiningen] and Teck on the question of precedence’, Sir Henry Ponsonby wrote to his wife from Buckingham Palace in 1878, ‘and I heard that Teck would go nowhere, where there was a chance of meeting Leiningen.* This has stirred up the pride of Gleichenf who . . . now claims to be called His Serene High- ness and to rank before Teck — Teck’s fury is redoubled. He declares that in Wiirttemberg he goes into the closet with the whole royal family and asks triumphantly if Leiningen or Gleichen can do as much. Tis said the matter will come before the Queen .’49 But these were troubles in the future; and the only apparent threat to perfect happiness, on the June morning on which Princess Mary Adelaide was wedded to Prince Teck at Kew, was the imminent danger of the outbreak of war between Prussia and Austria, a disaster which would involve the bridegroom’s rejoining the Imperial Army in Vienna without a moment’s delay. At the Duchess of Cambridge’s reception at Kew on the eve of the wedding, Prince Teck replied ‘almost tear- fully’ to one guest’s congratulations, ‘saying that he could not help thinking even on this eventful day of his poor fatherland’-S^ The outbreak, in June 1866, of the Austro-Prussian War spelt not only the doom of Austria but sounded the death-knell to the freedom and local power of all the little German courts, Wiirttem- beiger or Strelitzer alike. When the Tecks celebrated their Silver Wedding, in June 1891, the Grand Duchess Augusta wrote to her ^ter: T so remember that 12th June, whilst I was putting on my blue Dress with Queen Charlotte’s fine Lace, Fritz came in with Bfilow’s Telegram, that Prussia had upset the Diet at Frankfurt; and asking Fritz what line he would take! this was the beginning of the end of all things. 5 ^ However, the wedding in the little rustic church on Kew Green passed off happily enough. The village was thronged with weE-wishers, both because of the local popularity of Princess ice of Leiningen (1830-1904), an Admiral in the British Navy, was of Queen Victoria’s mother, the Duchess of Kent (i78(S-i86i) by to Emich-Charles, Prince of Leiningen (1763-1814), and thus to Qpeen Victoria’s beloved half-sister, Feodora, who married <2i Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

A MAY CHILD AND HER PARENTS 43 Mary Adelaide and her mother and because it was one of the first functions the Queen had attended since her widowhood. ‘Dear Mary looked very handsome & very happy\\ the Queen wrote later.5^ ‘ . She was very quiet & self-possessed. Frani was very nervous. The Fracas with the China caused by the Bp. of Winchester was considerable. Such an absurd thing to happen! . . The newly-married couple set blithely off for Ashridge, lent them for their honeymoon by Lady Marion Alford. They were accom- panied by the good wishes, as well as the doubts, of their relatives. To the worldly-wise of that generation, marriages contracted after the first flush of youth was over took on something of the quality of a potential battleground. Which party, they pondered, would gain the upper hand.^ Queen Victoria’s half-sister, Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, backed Princess Mary Adelaide: ... I cannot deny, that I was much astonished at the suddenness of Mary's Verlobung with that very young looking Prince Teck. May they be happy, is all one can say and wish. As for his being imter dem Pantoffel^ by and by, I have no doubt of, but if so I have no pity on him, for it is always the man’s own fault if that is the case. Certainly Mary is mighty but I think, if she is fond of a person she may be able of showing great devotion and affection. She is much cleverer than he is.53 The Queen, on the other hand, took the opposite view: ... I think really she is vy fortunate, for Pee Teck, is not at all wanting, & has a vy firm will & opinion of his own so that Mary who is excessively fond of him, will certainly obey him; her manner is already — quieter & she talks most sensibly of her future.54 After a broken honeymoon of only fifteen days Prince Teck started for Vienna, taking his bride with him as far as Stuttgart, where he left her in charge of his Wiirttemberg relations, at their stiff, Teutonic court. Proving too late to take part in the Six Weeks’ War, Teck returned to Stuttgart to fetch his wife, settled with her for some weeks in Vienna and then moved on to his sister’s, at Schloss Reinthal near Graz. They were home again in September, borrowing a comer house in Prince’s Gate for three months, whilst their rooms at Kensington * History does not record what the Bishop of Winchester (who had been assisting the Archbishop of Canterbury at the wedding service) did to the china. The incident presumably occurred in the library at Cambridge Cottage, where the royal table for the breakfast was laid, the rest of the party sitting down in a gaily decorated tent. 44 QUEEN MARY were being got ready. ‘I am thankful to say that the Queen has given us the greater portion of the apartment she and Aunt Kent occupied at Kensington Palace in days of yore, which the Board of Works promise to get ready for us by the month of May’, Princess Mary Adelaide wrote to a friend, ‘and which, if they please to spend a little money upon it may be made a very charming abode, as the rooms are handsome and comfortable.’SS It was in this spacious chain of rooms at Kensington Palace that Princess May and her three brothers were born. Although the T ecks’ apartment comprised the ground floor, below the vast painted State Rooms of the Palace, a part of these latter were used as nurseries. ‘It was quaint and pretty to see the little ones in their cots with allegorical figures hovering above them’, wrote one of the Duchess of Cam- bridge’s ladies, Miss Ella Taylor. 5 ^ It was thus literally from the cradle that Princess May began to realise that her circumstances, and so perhaps her destiny, were different from those of all the other children bom in the borough of Kensington in May 1867, CHAPTER TWO KENSINGTON PALACE AND MARLBOROUGH HOUSE I ^HE BIRTH of Princess May in 1867 was followed on I 13 August 1868 by that of the Tecks’ eldest son, Adolphus. JL On 9 January 1870, a second son. Prince Francis, appeared upon the scene. These were both fine-looking, large children, but their births were heralded by tiresome, vociferous expressions of anxiety on the part of Princess Mary Adelaide’s immediate relations, similar to those which had preceded and accompanied the birth of Princess May. ‘Your confinement really was a surprise, to me at least’, her sister wrote from Strelitz on the birth of Prince ‘Frank’. ‘. . . But now I really hope this charming little Trio will suffice. . . . Tomorrow I suppose your bed will be pushed into the Morning room.^ not today as it is Friday! I see it all before me, Clarky coming in with Baby, and later with a bottle of Champagne!’^ The fourth and last child, Alexander George, was bom on 14 April 1874. ‘Mary Teck was safely confined yesterday with another & jri// bigger boy! That seems hardly possible’, was the Queen’s comment, in a letter from Osborne to her daughter at Berlin.^ Thus was the general ground-plan for Princess May’s youth prepared: the only girl in a family of four. Known as ‘the Peacemaker’ in nursery and, later, schoolboy squabbles, she early learned to exercise her native discretion, firmness and tact. Her eldest brother. Prince Dolly, fair-haired and blue-eyed like herself, was throughout his life the closest to her of the three. Prince Frank and the baby, a plump child called at his Aunt Augusta’s suggestion and much to the Duchess of Cambridge’s annoyance ‘Alge’,* as a contraction of Alexander George, were very dark, like their father. Prince Dolly and Prince Frank were startlingly handsome children; in the nursery their sister would refer to them as ‘Beauty Boys’. The blonde Prince Dolly especially appealed to Princess May’s aesthetic sense: ‘dearest Dolly . . . * Pronounced ‘Algy\\ QUEEN MARY is SO beautiful that he quite took our breath away’, she wrote to her aunt in November 1890, when her brother, then twenty-two, returned from India: ‘he has grown very much & is much thinner & has such a smart figure. His face is longer & his nose has become straighter, in fact his profile is lovely & he is more like the pictures of the old Royal Family than ever . ’3 All through her life mere physical beauty was greatly enhanced, in the eyes of Princess May, by any element of the family-historical. In the same way a portrait or miniature of some unknown personage might be exquisitely painted and so worthy of wholehearted approval; but if it turned out to be the picture of some member of ‘the old Royal Family’ it became automatically an object of admiration — and desire. This potent interest in family history, which became a guiding factor in later years when, as Queen Mary, she was constantly adding to the Royal Collections pictures and objects of family interest bought out of her own private purse, was first imbibed from her mother, who never forgot that she was a granddaughter of George III. It was also richly fed by her aunt, Augusta Strelitz, whose views and recollections, purveyed in long, lively weekly letters, became a strong influence in Princess May’s mental development. The Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz outwitted all her contemporaries in the Royal Family by living merrily on until the age of ninety-four. She died during the First World War, in 1916, having for long enjoyed the triumphant position of being the only living English Princess who had taken part in the Coronation of William IV, and, consequently, able to advise Queen Alexandra and after her Queen Mary on the long-forgotten court etiquette of Queen Adelaide’s day. The very fact of living in old Kensington Palace, with its mellow fed brickwork, fine rooms designed by Wren and re-decorated by Kent, its smoke-dark panelling and dim, lofty painted ceilings increased Princess May’s natural passion for the past. Here William III had conducted afeirs of state, here George II had argued with Queen Caii^oline, who knotted fringe and gossiped to Lord Hervey in the IcMg shallow galleries which smelt of bees-wax. Princess May’s night- nursefy was, as we have seen, one of the old State Rooms, and when 1 ^ portots wished to entertain at dinner — ^which they wished fecpendy— thdr guests would eat in the Council Room on the of the Palace. The Tecks’ apartments had been sumptu- ^How handsomely and comfortably the rooms at l^aadngton are arranged’, the Crown Princess, herself a person of KENSINGTON PALACE AND MARLBOROUGH HOUSE 47 taste, wrote to her mother, from St Leonards-on-Sea in November 1868.4 1 am already looking forward so much to pay you frequent little visits at Kensington which I don’t know at all yet, and which I heard from all sides is quite lovely’, the Princess of Wales wrote prettily, six months after Princess May’s birth .5 It was generally recognised that Prince Teck knew all about what would now be called ‘interior decoration’. ‘He had’, wrote a contem- porary, ‘the art of making his surroundings thoroughly comfortable’, and Princess Mary ‘submitted her judgement to his’ in all matters of carpeting, curtains, upholstery and the disposal of pictures and pieces of furniture about their rooms. He shared with his cousin, Prince William of Wiirttemberg, afterwards King William II, an almost feminine urge to arrange and re-arrange rooms. Like his cousin he was very musical and had the quiet and charming German love of home-life — ‘never so happy’, a member of the household noted, ‘as within his own walls’. The Tecks’ salon was dominated by the great full-length Lawrence of George IV, now in the Wallace Colle<ption, which had been given to the Duke of Teck by Lord Conyngham. Royal relics, such as Queen Charlotte’s sedan chairs, abounded at Kensington Palace; while living survivals of the late Georgian past were near at hand — ranging from the dear little old Duchess of Inverness, whose quarters were in another part of the same building, to Mr Beckham, the Duke of Sussex’s venerable page, who ‘lived in a little house near the Serpentine, in Kensington Gardens & our nurse used to take us sometimes to see him’, as Queen Mary recalled forty years after.^ Protecting the privileged inmates of the Palace from the public sward of Kensington Gardens was the ‘pretty and delightful garden of our own’ where warm summer’s afternoons were spent by Princess May tucked up, in niched muslin bonnet and pelisse, in her three- wheeled perambulator with its heavy silk-fringed canopy nodding above her head. Here, too, a laden tea-table placed upon a carpet on the lawn would form a focal point for little family gatherings — Prince Teck, his wife, her brother the Duke of Cambridge, her mother the old Duchess, or her sister the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg- Strelitz. The region immediately outside the purlieus of this private garden was regarded with a certain suspicion, for the Round Pond was thought to give off noxious vapours, harmful to a gently-nurtured child. In July 1868, when she was fourteen months old, Princess May was seized with violent spasms : ‘Whether she caught a slight chill, or QUEEN MARY 48 the effluvia from the pond in Kensington Gardens, which was in a very unhealthy state, and which the nursery windows face, I know not’, wrote her anxious mother, describing \"an alarming relapse’, after which the baby \"all the next day lay in a state of collapse’. The Duchess of Cambridge intervened and \"very wisely insisted on carrying her off to Kew, to be away from the pond, and out nearly all day in the garden, under the shade of the old chestnut tree ’.7 When they ventured farther afield, quite beyond the small world of the Round Pond and Mr Beckham’s cottage by the Serpentine, they did so in a manner calculated to impress even more clearly on Princess May’s mind her parents’ and her own semi-royal status. In 1871 Queen Victoria initiated a frustrating private enquiry into why her cousin Princess Mary Adelaide and Prince Teck were using Royal livery (of scarlet and dark blue) for their own servants and coachmen, and why their carriages were painted, like her own, the Sovereign’s colour, chocolate brown. It was also noticed that the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz seemed to be making use of similar liveries and similar carriages. Such a thing had not even been done by Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, husband of Princess Charlotte; for both before and after her death he had used his own liveries of green and gold, with green carriages and grey horses — \"very handsome’. It was a delicate matter, and the answer to the question was ambiguous: the Teck servants did indeed wear scarlet coats, but \"the Waistcoats & other part of the Dress, are Blacky & not Blue^ as in the Royal Livery — ^though bound with Gold Lace, the same as The Queen’s servants. The imdress is the same blue as the Queen’s.’ It was asserted that the waistcoats were black instead of dark blue because this was the Wurttemberg livery at the court of Stuttgart. \"Their carriages’, it was added, \"are exactly the same as the Queen’s with the exception of the difference of the Crowns.’ ^ There the matter rested, until brought up again by Sir Henry Ponsonby in 1881, when Lord Sydney recapitulated the Wurttemberg argument, admitting that \"the nuance was very fine’ and that \"practically there is little difference from the other Members of the Royal Family’. \"This ought not to be!’ minuted the Queen on a summary of the results of this second investigation, \"Livery or undress shd be their own ’ .9 All that a small child would notice would be the fact that her parents and her brothers lived, in style, in a Royal Palace, and that when they left it on ^^pme expedition they did so in equipages apparently identical in every detail with those used by the Queen of England herself. KENSINGTON PALACE AND MARLBOROUGH HOUSE 49 Apart from the stories and traditions of the Palace in which she was reared in comparative pomp, contemporary family history, in the form of living members of the family, was passing before Princess May’s attentive eyes. 1 am the last of the family who has a good memory of what the family in 1874 looked like’, Queen Mary wrote to the Librarian of Windsor Castle in 1948. 'I was always interested when members of the family came to see Mama, & had a good stare to take them all in.’^o II So, at the age of seven — for such she was in 1874 — Princess May was already sharpening those very exceptional faculties of observation and of photographic memory for which she was famous in after life. However, there was one aspect of the visiting members of 'the Family’ which would have made them rather easy to remember: their rarity. At that period British Royalties were few and far between. It is not to be wished that the Royal family shd become too large’, wrote Queen Victoria, who, as the mother of nine children, might have been thought to have herself done more than anybody else to expand it. It is a weakness, rather than strength.’^^ As we have noticed, Queen Victoria had only four first cousins in her own generation. Three of these were Princess May’s mother, Princess May’s uncle and Princess May’s aunt — all figures too closely familiar to be subjects for a child’s blue-eyed stare. Of the officially recognised widows of George Ill’s sons, old aunts who had doted on Princess May’s mother as a girl, all but two were dead when Princess May was born. Queen Adelaide had died in 1849, the Duchess of Gloucester in 1857, the Duchess of Kent in 1861. There remained the Duchess of Inverness, the former Lady Cecilia Buggin, who had been the Duke of Sussex’s second wife and who had never claimed Royal rank. The Duchess of Inverness was aged, squat and small. She dressed in a bygone mode and had quaint, cosy old ways. She lived in discreet state in a wing of Kensington Palace, entertaining in a dining-room which was ‘fitted up like a tent & was very stuffy’. Although her French was feeble, and she made no claims to conversational sparkle, she was a favourite with the diplomatic corps, and was noted for her genial hospitality: ‘no-one that called on her ever left her presence without hearing the words — “Come and dine”.’^^ It was the Duchess of Inverness who had given Queen QUEEN MARY Charlotte’s fine sedan chairs to the Duchess of Teck, who subsequently sold them to Queen Victoria for three hundred pounds. She was also generous to the Teck children: 1 hope you went to see the Duchess of Inverness, who always gives you such nice things’, Princess May’s father wrote to her, from Sandringham, in the New Year of 1871.^3 The Duchess of Inverness died in 1873, when Princess May was six. By 1 874 there remained of that old Royal generation in England only Princess May’s own grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. ‘Grandmama’ lived on until 1889, when Princess May was a young woman; but, after a paralytic stroke at Neu Strelitz in 1873, the Duchess of Cambridge had become, as the Teck children knew to their cost, more visited than visiting. Thus there were left, for childish observation, only Queen Victoria herself and her family of nine. During Princess May’s childhood the Queen came rarely to London and very seldom indeed to Kensington. From time to time she would send for the Teck children to have a look at them, as, for instance, in May 1872, when she wrote to the Duchess of Teck: ‘I have so much to do & have suffered so much from my head lately that I fear I cannot undertake to sttyou this time — ^but {{you will send Girdlestone* with the children by \\ past 10 on Wednesday I cld find a few minutes to see them — wh. I long to do’; or, in July 1874: ‘Your darling chubby Boys looked beautiful yesterday & May much better .’^4 Each 26 May the Queen would remember her goddaughter Princess May’s birthday, and send her a gift — z Balmoral album ‘with likenesses of ourselves’ in one instance, and she would also take great trouble over the making, and despatch from Ballater, of Highland kilts, complete with silver ornaments, for the Teck boys. Princess May and her brothers would in their turn send the Queen birthday presents — z box with forget-me-nots ‘drawn from nature’ on it, a plate painted by Ppncess May with gold which had to be ‘fired several times’, a ‘novelty ifojr flowers’ and, once, an ambitious fretwork basket in which they had all collaborated. ‘The Children made the basket for you’, wrote the Duchess of Teck, ‘(all traced, for cutting out with a saw, and therefore so difficult as would appear). They are overjoyed at your in^tion their work and you cannot think the pleasure they ii| paking the basket for you!^ — ^but they are amply rewarded by moation of it .’^5 There was at least one further example ipn: ‘My brothers and L have had great pleasure in ea^e, which^ we lay most respect-- nurse to die tfaee elder Teck cMldreUi KENSINGTON PALACE AND MARLBOROUGH HOUSE 5I fully at Your feet and hope You will kindly use in remembrance of Your dutiful and loving little Niece and Nephews', Princess May wrote to the Queen, in May 1877, in a round childish hand.^^ Such was Queen Victoria's pleasant relationship with her juvenile cousins, the little Tecks. The Duchess of Teck was friendly with several of the Queen's own children, though not especially intimate with any of them; for here a purely chronological factor intervened. Having been born in 1833, she was fourteen years younger than the Queen, but at the same time twenty-four years older than the Queen's youngest child. To the Queen, Princess Mary Adelaide had always seemed a young cousin, isolated, as it were, in a mezzanine generation of her own; to the Queen’s sons and daughters she had seemed in their cliildhood an older relative, almost an unmarried aunt. ‘She was the friend of my youth when we were girls together, and though she was eight years older than I am, I was sincerely attached to her', the Queen's eldest daughter, Princess ‘Vicky' wrote, as Empress Frederick, after the Duchess of Teck's death .^7 In 1858 Princess Vicky had married and gone to live in Berlin. The next sister. Princess Alice, was ten years younger than Princess Mary Adelaide, who used at one time to drive her in her pony phaeton through the Park. In 1862 Princess Alice also had married and retired to Germany, going to live in Darmstadt where she died of diphtheria in 1878. The Queen's third daughter, Princess Helena, thirteen years Princess Mary Adelaide's junior, had married in 1866, the same year as herself. They had never been on noticeably warm terms with one another, and Princess Mary Adelaide had indeed earned a sharp reprimand from the Queen for forgetting, in her own nuptial excitement, to write to congratulate her on ‘Lenchen's’ engagement to Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. Of the Queen’s other children. Prince Alfred was often at sea, or in such naval stations as Malta; in 1874 he married the only daughter of the Tsar Alexander II, a devout, dowdy and haughty-seeming woman, who did not trouble to placate Princess Mary Adelaide's strong Russophobia. Princess Louise, who was married to Lord Lome in 1871, had apartments in Kensington Palace, but lived much in Scot- land, and, from 1878 until 1883, was in Canada where her husband was Governor-General. The three youngest members of the family, Aithur, Leopold and Beatrice, were kept at the Queen’s side until they, each in turn, married: their children, born during the decade of the ei^teen-eighties, were small babies when Princess May was in her QUEEN MARY 52 ’teens. And so it turned out that of all Queen Victoria’s children and their families, those with whom the Tecks were on the best terms were also those into whose intimacy fate was to carry Princess May of Teck: the Wales family, living in fashionable luxury at Marlborough House, and headed by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Princess May’s future father-in-law and future King. Ill The Duchess of Teck’s friendship with the Prince of Wales was of long standing, but it was tinged by fear. He could charm her, as he could, if he wished, charm anyone who came into his orbit for, with the possible exception of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, he was by far the most fascinating of Queen Victoria’s sons and he had a true kindness of heart. It was his sense of humour that Princess Mary Adelaide found disquieting: ‘Wales, who is in very good looks, was most dear and nice, and not in that odious chaffing mood I so dislike’,^^ she wrote in February 1875, after a luncheon at Marlborough House. Some people, like her mother’s lady-in-waiting, Lady Geraldine Somerset, believed this fear to be mutual, and that the Prince of Wales found the Duchess of Teck as unnerving as she found him. In any case her attitude seems likely to have infected Princess May, who was never really at her ease with ‘Uncle Wales’, either before or after she became his daughter-in-law. She may also, as she grew up, have been influenced by her mother’s stalwart views on what she called the ‘fast ladies and gamblers’ of the Prince of Wales’s circle, on the dreadfully Russophile proclivities of the Marlborough House family, and on thdr signal lack of interest in literature or any other of the arts. In 1858, when he was just seventeen, the Prince of Wales had been virtually shut up at White Lodge in Richmond Park with a couple of tutors, ‘so as to be’, in his father the Prince Consort’s words, ‘away from the world and devote himself exclusively to study’. In this case being away from the world meant being within easy reach of the Duchess of Cambridge’s house at Kew, and it was here that he tended his first dinner-party. To relieve the tedium of these cloistral months at White Lodge, the boy would pay visits to his old Aunt Cambridge and her daughter towards sundown, rowing up-river from Richmond or Mortlake and mooring his boat alongside Ae old fencEng-stage at Brentford Ferry. He would despatch little letters to Princess Mary Adelaide saying that he intended ‘rowing round by KENSINGTON PALACE AND MARLBOROUGH HOUSE S3 Kew Gardens today as we told you yesterday*, or sending her ‘some parts of the pheasant which I shot which is arranged for ladies* hats, & will you be so kind as to choose which part you like best *,^9 This amiable, cousinly relationship with the Cairiridges was made suddenly more intimate by the Prince’s marriage, in March 1863, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark. Princess Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg was a daughter of the elected heir to the old Eng of Denmark. In the year of Princess Alexandra’s marriage he succeeded to the Danish throne as Christian IX. His wife. Droning Louise, was the daughter of the Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel, the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother. As the old Duchess’s great-niece. Princess Alexandra was thus a cousin to Princess Mary Adelaide. When she first settled in England as the ravishing Princess of Wales — ‘something exquisite and flowerlike ... a beautiful rose or a rare orchid or an absolutely faultless carnation . . . , a garden flower that had been grown by a superlative gardener, who knew every trick of his art’^^ — ‘Alix’ had naturally turned to her Cambridge cousin for companionship. At the Wales marriage in St George’s Chapel, Windsor, Princess Mary Adelaide had been prominent: ‘I never saw a finer piece of acting’, wrote an eyewitness, ‘than Princess Mary heading the English Royal procession. Morally as well as physically the place was not big enough to hold her.’^^ Ever since she was a small child the bride had known and loved Princess Mary Adelaide, who used to call her ‘la petite Alexandrine’ and would push her about in a little carriage round the courtyard of Rumpenheim, the quiet summer residence of the Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel, an old white- washed, green-shuttered Schloss with a cupola’d clock-tower and a terrace walk along the gentle, leafy banks of the Main near Frankfurt. On her side Princess Mary Adelaide responded to the young Princess of Wales’s trusting affection with her"
