        "text": "Here is my attempt at a long time line, set from 1819, I hope to cover the next 200 years. With the birth of a single baby on Christmas Day, this child would grow on to change the history dramatically.\n\n-----​\n\nEarly life\n\nIn 1819, Her Royal Highness, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, Duchess of Clarence and St Andrews, be came pregnant for a second time, her husband Prince William had hoped to move the household to England so his future heir would be born on British soil, however following the premature state of the last pregnancy, he chose to stay put in Herrenhausen Palace, Hanover. [1]\n\nTheir son was born safely and healthy midday on 25th December 1819, with Adelaide also being healthy. He was christened on the day of his birth at the Palace by, his father's Domestic Chaplain, Rev Edward Curtis Kemp (serving as Chaplain to the British Ambassador to the Court of Berlin, The Rt. Hon. Sir George Rose as well), who had already been staying in Hanover to perform the Christmas sermon for the family.\n\nHis godparents were his paternal uncles, Prince Regent George (later George IV, represented by his other uncle Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland), Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (represented by Prince Ernest's step son, Prince Frederick of Prussia) and the Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (represented by deputy of the Knighthood of the Principality of Osnabrück, Herbord Sigismund Ludwig von Bar) and his paternal aunt, Charlotte, Princess Royal, the Dowager Queen of Württemberg (represented by Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, The Duchess of Cumberland and Teviotdale)\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Clarence had been discussing that if it was a girl to name her, Georgina Elizabeth Adelade and if a boy to name him George, in honour of the both Duke's father, King George III and the Duchess's father, George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, but Prince Regent George, asked that the child be named either named Elizabeth or William instead. The couple agreed and on the day, chose to christened him, William George Henry.\n\nAt birth, William was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of George III: George, the Prince Regent; Frederick, the Duke of York; William and, his father, the Duke of Clarence. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children.\n\nThe small family moved to Great Britain, shortly after Prince William's birth, the family arrived in Great Britain, in mid January, however before the new born was able to meet his grandfather, George III, died on 29 January 1820 and was succeeded by his eldest son, George IV.\n\nOn the 10 December 1820, 15 days before his first birthday, the small family was joined by the birth of Princess Elizabeth Georgiana Adelaide of Clarence, however this joy was short lived, as 2 months 22 days after her birth, Princess Elizabeth of Clarence, who had \"suddenly been seized with the fatal disease, an intro-susception of the bowels\" and died.\n\nFor the first few years, his family living in Richmond and at Kew Palace, until 1827, when the family moved into the specially commissioned royal residence of 'Clarence House', situated on The Mall, in the City of Westminster, attached to St. James's Palace and sharing the palace's garden. He was educated by private tutors, selected by his uncle, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, who was known for his liberal views.\n\nNine days after Prince William's seventh birthday, Britain mourned another royal death, when the Duke of York died on 5 January 1827, at the age of 63, followed three years later, when King George IV died on 26 June 1830, aged 67, these two young deaths, were said to have had an adverse effect on Prince William's view on immortality.\n\nKing George IV was succeeded by his next surviving brother, William IV, and 10 year old, Prince William of Clarence and St Andrews, became Prince of Wales and heir to his father's throne. With William IV, succeeding at the age of 64, the Parliament, under Prime Miniser, Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, set about bringing about the Regency Act 1830, which made special provision for William's wife to act as regent in case William died while his son was still a minor.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Prince of Wales had hoped to follow in his father's footsteps and join the Royal Navy as a midshipman, however due to being the only child of the king of Britain, parliament declined the request, he would instead assist his father, during meetings privy meetings.\n\n[1] In our time line, Adelaide became pregnant, but in her seventh month of pregnancy, she caught pleurisy and gave birth prematurely on 27 March 1819 during the illness. Her daughter, Charlotte, lived only a few hours. Another pregnancy in the same year caused William to move the household to England so his future heir would be born on British soil, yet Adelaide miscarried at Calais or Dunkirk during the journey on 5 September 1819.\n\nAs well as his years on the Privy Council, Prince William of Wales, took on a new role of touring foreign nations on his father's behalf as well as searching for a suitable future bride. He left Britain, in January 1835, aged 15, with a large household around him. William would begin his visit, with a stop in Belgium, where he was graciously hosted by Leopold I, who regaled him tales of his time as husband of William's own late cousin, Princess Charlotte of Wales and introducing William to Leopold's thirteen year old niece Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, daughter of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág, however there was no connection between the pair.\n\nFrom Belgium, the royal tour, traveled through Prussian held provinces of Rhine Province and Westphalia, the Prince was able to see the influence the Prussian hyper-masculine military culture and monarchy was having on these lands.\n\nArriving in mid-March in the Prince's father's other domain, the Kingdom of Hanover, where his uncle, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge was serving as Viceroy of Hanover, along with his cousin, Prince George and Princess Augusta of Cambridge, the time spent with his cousin, George created a bond that would serve both the men a life time of loyalty and friendship, however Augusta, was a formidable force and did not take to William's liberal views.\n\nLeaving Hanover, in late May, his household, traveled northward to Denmark, where William was welcomed with kind hospitality, by 67 year old Frederick IV, housed in Palace of Amalienborg in Copenhagen. Frederick was the son of King Christian VII and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, Christian was himself, son of a British princess, Louise of Great Britain. Although 42 years separated the pair, the conversations between them were heard by staff to continue though out the day and into the late hours of the night. Frederick suggested that William would be a charming and caring match for his youngest daughter, Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark, however, she was 13 years older than Prince William and only separated from her husband Prince Frederick of Denmark, with a divorce on the cards, Vilhelmine, would cause a great crisis in the British constitution, which William knew he couldn't allow. While inside the palace, Frederick, granted an private and personal reading of the \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\" by an author named, Hans Christian Andersen, Prince William, fell in love with these tales and requested a published book in English to be sent to his home in London, for him to read to himself and his future issues. He left the Kingdom of Denmark, sailing from Copenhagen, through the Baltic sea, for Stockholm Sweden in Early-July.\n\nIn Russia, William stayed with Russian Tsar, Nicholas I and his family in the Winter Palace, seeing the beautiful country in its warm summer scene of August, he caught the eyes of both of Nicholas's eldest daughters, Grand Duchess Maria and Grand Duchess Olga, however he found Olga to be non-challenging, while Nicholas did not want his eldest daughter, Maria, who William found to be attentive and generous with strong liberal views, to leave Russia to live abroad.\n\nWilliam and his entourage would bid the Russian family, good bye on the 8th September, traveling toward Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, the royal party would reach the Hohenzollern household, in late September, with the elderly Frederick William III of Prussia gratefully welcoming the British heir.\n\nKing Frederick William, had hoped to have a Hohenzollern bride wed William, forming a strong alliance with Britain, however his daughter's were already married and his granddaughters, were too young.\n\nThe visit was a short one, with the Prince, traveling south towards Vienna, before September was even finished, while sitting in his stage coach, Prince William of Wales, would spend his time observing the country side of Europe, which still bared scares of the Napoleonic War, and arriving at the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna, in mid-October, he was greeted warmly by Prince Klemens von Metternich, Austria's Foreign Minister, who represented the mentally deficienct, Emperor Ferdinand of Austria, whom had succeeded to the throne on March 2, of this year, following the death of his father, Francis, the last Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nLeaving Vienna on 3rd November, the court would make their way West, aiming for France, along the Germanic side of the Alps. King Louis Philippe I, tried desperately to persuade the young Prince of Wales to consider marrying his youngest daughter, Princess Clémentine of Orléans, who was described as \"possessing great beauty and accomplishments,\" going as far as stating he would request a decree from Pope Gregory XVI (although many believed that the strongly conservative and traditionalist Pope would have said no)\n\nPrince William, having grown up learning about King James II, the Glorious Revolution and seeing the great strife that was still in Britain, knew that a Catholic bride would have consequences that didn't bare thinking about.\n\nOn his last day in Paris, Prince William, was expected to return straight to Great Britain, however he was invited to visit the Netherlands as an honoured guest at the court of William I, it was while in this beautiful country, that William fell in love with Princess Sophie, the granddaughter of William I, through his heir Prince William of Orange.\n\nHe requested a extension on his visit as to spend his 16th birthday with the Dutch royal family, secretly he would as King William I permission and on 25 December, he requested that Princess Sophie, did him the honour of being his wife, as expected she was quick to accept and so it was set, with his father's ailing health at 72 years old, on 25 November 1837 at the age of 18, Prince William of Wales was wed to Princess Wilhelmine Marie Sophie Louise of the Netherlands (8 April 1824 – 23 March 1897) in one of the grandest weddings in European history, with foreign dignities such as Léopold I, King of the Belgians (uncle of William's cousin, Princess Alexandria), King Louis Philippe I of France, and representing Frederick William III of Prussia, was his forty year old, second son, Prince William of Prussia (future Emperor of Germany)\n\nAs well as President Andrew Jackson being represented by former American chargé d'affaires in London, Aaron Vail. Prince William, refused the offer of United States Minister to the United Kingdom, Andrew Stevenson, to attend, due to Stevenson's controversial standing of being a slave owner, going against the Prince's abolitionism views.\n\nThe grooms side:\n\nKing William IV (Father)\n\nQueen Adelaide (Mother)\n\nPrincess Alexandria of Kent and Strathearn (cousin)\n\nThe Dowager Duchess of Kent and Strathearn (aunt)\n\nThe Princess Augusta Sophia (aunt)\n\nThe Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (uncle and aunt)\n\nPrince George of Cumberland (cousin and Groomsman)\n\nThe Duke of Sussex and Lady Cecilia Underwood (uncle and aunt)\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (uncle and aunt)\n\nPrince George of Cambridge (cousin, bestman and groomsman)\n\nPrincess Augusta of Cambridge (cousin)\n\nPrincess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge (cousin)\n\nThe Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh (aunt)\n\nThe Princess Sophia (aunt)\n\nThe bridal train was carried by these bridesmaids:\n\n- Maid of Honour, was bestowed on to Princess Alexandria of Kent, cousin of Prince William and third in line to the throne at this time.\n\n- Princess Wilhelmina Frederika Alexandrine Anna Louise, cousin of the bride, through Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, the second child of King William I of the Netherlands and Wilhelmina of Prussia, youngest at only 10 years old.\n\n- Lady Mary Howard, granddaughter of the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal and premier peer of the realm\n\n- Princess Augusta of Cambridge, cousin of Prince William\n\n- Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, cousin of Prince William\n\n- Lady Caroline Gordon-Lennox, daughter of the Duke of Richmond and Lennox\n\n- Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the Earl of Carlisle\n\n- Lady Wilhelmina Stanhope, daughter of the Earl Stanhope\n\n- Lady Sarah Villiers, daughter of the Earl of Jersey\n\n- Lady Elizabeth Sackville-West, daughter of the Earl De La Warr\n\n- Lady Ida Hay, daughter of the Earl of Erroll\n\n- Lady Jane Pleydell-Bouverie, daughter of the Earl of Radnor\n\nPrincess Sophie was chosen not only for her closeness of age, but also whom through her great-grandfather, William V, Prince of Orange's mother Anne, Princess Royal, she is related to George I, and on her other side she is the Great-great maternal granddaughter of George I, via Sophia Dorothea of Hanover. Her links to Prussia and Russia, being the great granddaughter of Peter III of Russia, Catherine the Great and Frederick William II of Prussia, also made her an idea choice for Prince William.\n\nShe was described by her husband's aunt, Victoria, Dowerger Duchess of Kent and Strathearn, thusly \"Sophie was not my first though of as a future Queen of Great Britain, due to being extremely ugly, she has however showed great strength and personality, being a most imposing Princess.
