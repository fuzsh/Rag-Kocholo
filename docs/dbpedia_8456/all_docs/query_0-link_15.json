        "text": "MOTION Abstract Aristotle's ideas, and interpretations of them, dominated theorizing about motion during the Middle ages. However, local motion [motus localis] or locomotion was, according to the 'Philosopher' and his followers, only one of four types of change. In addition to change in location, the Peripatetics distinguished change in substance, in quality and in quantity. Within these four domains of change, change always requires the existence of a potentiality which can be actualized. During the late renaissance, however, the peripatetic views on motion were variously criticized, adapted, rejected and replaced. (Bodnar 2016) Generally speaking, the different kinds of change were all reduced to local motion, and one of the key ideas of the new theory of motion was the principle of inertia. First versions of this concept were introduced by Galileo (1564-1642) and later developed by René Descartes (1596-1650) and Isaac Newton (1643-1727). The seeds of this (r)evolution, though, had already been planted by philosophers such as Johannes Buridanus (c. 1300-1358) during the late Middle Ages, who was himself inspired by the work of John Philoponos (c.490-c.570). In the geocentric cosmos as conceived of by Aristotle (384-322 BC) and Ptolemy (c.100-c.170), there was a strict, ontological distinction between the sublunary world of change and the celestial world of perfect bodies making perfect, circular motions. However, in 1543, Copernicus (1473-1543) published his De revolutionibus which presented a heliocentric model of the universe, supported by Galileo's telescopic observations. The collapse of the traditional worldview was completed when Newton introduced his notion of universal gravitation.\n\nThe Alliterative Morte Arthure and Stanzaic Morte Arthur narrate violent interactions and intense emotions that are predominantly conveyed by means of kinesis. When a literary work refers to kinesis, i.e., gestures, movements, facial expressions, and physical interactions, readers tend to infer the kinaesthetic valence of such information. The term kinaesthesia refers to the sense of movement. More systematically than their medieval sources, the two Middle English poems emphasize the significance of kinesis and kinaesthesia. This article supports this claim by analysing kinesic tropes of emotions, and action verbs referring to detailed dynamic movements. It also highlights the importance of kinesis in conceptions of identity and faciality, showing that facial gestures are more relevant in the two poems than facial features.\n\nIn this paper I will present an ongoing semiotic investigation of motion and some 14th century attempts at representing it in geometrical terms. The semiotic approach that I will follow focuses on the manner in which time, space and velocity were signified in certain historical periods. I take as my starting point the idea that the conceptualisation of motion and its key conceptual elements—speed, time and velocity— can only be understood within the scope of the epistemological configurations that make motion thinkable in a certain way. In other words, any attempt at investigating conceptualizations of time, speed, and velocity needs to take into account the cultural mental structures that underpin them. These cultural mental structures, or épistèmes, to use Michel Foucault’s term, are not mere spiritual or intellectual forms evolving on their own. They arise, acquire shape and evolve under the evolution of social practices, as well as their material conditions, forms of production and social relations. Thus, in the perspective that I am advocating here, to ask questions about time, speed and velocity is also to ask questions about the cultural and social conditions that made these theoretical constructs possible.\n\nThere is common preservation that the term &quot;metaphysical&quot; is utilized to portray a gathering of seventeenth-century English artists, who wrote in a specific way affected by, or in response to, works by John Donne. The chose not many related as such are known as the metaphysical artists, and their works marked as &quot;metaphysical poetry&quot;. Precisely what the term metaphysical refers to, or what does it define this aspect requires some explanation. As indicated by the Cambridge Dictionary, metaphysical poetry identifies with the piece of theory that is tied in with getting presence and information&quot;; while theory then again, is &quot;the affective reason in viewing things with the aspect of the present reality and presence. Subsequently, by suggestion, however, till this day there is no fully effective definition of metaphysical poetry, as it requires a variety of characteristics which will be presented in this paper along with the brief history behind the metaphys..."
