        "text": "We read somewhere that Zemun is Belgrade's oldest neighborhood. We are not sure what people that live in Zemun would say about this, but we are sure that this is the only city in Belgrade, and it hides perhaps the most beautiful parts of the capital. The cobbled, narrow, authentic streets, lookouts and squares that just pop out in front of you instantly overwhelm you with the spirit of Zemun, not changed to this day.\n\nPRACTICAL INFORMATION\n\nThis part of Belgrade, at the mouth of the Sava River in the Danube, was annexed to the capital in 1934.\n\nThe oldest name of this part of the city, Taurunum, dates from the XII century. The present name is assumed to be related to the Slovenian word \"zemlin\" which means dugouts, present at that time in this area.\n\nLOCATION\n\nZemun is located in the southeastern part of Srem, below the Srem plateau on the right bank of the Danube, not far from the mouth of the Sava. Today it is expanding territorially to the west and southwest, where it connects with New Belgrade.\n\nPrimarily developing as an independent city, Zemun has everything that exists in the very center of Belgrade. As part of the capital, it forms a major cultural and educational center. It is also adorned with its own theater - Madlenianum, known for its theater and opera performances.\n\nINTERESTING FACTS\n\nThe oldest house in Belgrade is located in this municipality. Formerly a hospitality facility, today one of the oldest preserved Zemun houses from the Ottoman period is the White Bear Tavern (Kafana Beli medved), which is one of the cultural monuments of the Zemun municipality and is under the protection of the state.\n\nThere are many legends and stories about Zemun. The one who walks their streets and alleys, feels like he belongs to Zemun. As Branko Najhold, a Zemun historian and chronicler, once said, \"being a Zemunac is a state of mind\""
