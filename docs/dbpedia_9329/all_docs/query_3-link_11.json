        "text": "Zemun is the second largest Belgrade municipality which has been an integral part of Belgrade\n\nsince 1934.\n\nUntil then, Zemun used to be a separate town in the south-east part of Srem. However, due to its\n\nhistorical, political and territorial ties, Zemun was integrated with Belgrade, which lead to even\n\nmore intensive development and interference of cultural, economic and other ties in the years that\n\nfollowed. Despite all these ties, residents of Zemun even today like to insist that Zemun is an\n\nindependent and unique city which is connected to the Serbian capital only in political sense of\n\nthe word. Why is this so? The evidence that prove the existence of a settlement in the territory of\n\nZemun date back to the Neolithic age, which is a proof that first city settlers stayed in this very\n\nlocation even so long ago.\n\nThe real settlement in the vicinity of today’s Gardos area existed even before the Romans arrived,\n\nand Zemun’s first name dates back to this period of history – Taurunum. Once they settled here,\n\nthe Slavs changed this name and due to a large number of small river houses (Zemunice in\n\nSerbian) nearby, they named the settlement Zemun (Zemlin). It’s interesting to know that in some\n\nold historical records Zemun is referred to as – Malevila, which implies “an evil place”. Whether\n\nthis is due to a number of murders typically associated with this area, or even the diseases spread\n\nby mosquitos, which were plentiful here because of the river and the specific swamp soil, it is still\n\nunknown. Anyway, the name like this sounds quite intriguing indeed.\n\nLiving in Zemun is quite satisfying and interesting for both the residents and visitors who like to\n\nspend time here. In addition to a lot of schools, Zemun also offers a faculty, important institutes,\n\nhospitals and theatres. With immensely rich history and unique geographical location, Zemun\n\nreally has a lot of advantages as it is located on the Danube coast, near the confluence of the\n\nSava and Danube rivers. Zemun is indeed a place that has it all. One of the former biggest hotels\n\nis situated at the Danube promenade in Zemun. This is the Hotel Jugoslavia and is even today\n\none of the most recognisable gathering places in Belgrade.\n\nTo arrive in Belgrade for a few days without visiting the Zemun promenade or visit some of the\n\nclubs near the Jugoslavija Hotel – this is something unimaginable. Zemun promenade offers a\n\nwhole range of restaurants, river clubs and night clubs, which is suitable for everyone’s taste.\n\nFantastic food, wine and other drinks, music for all generations – this is in a nutshell, Zemun\n\npromenade for many of its visitors. Charming landscape, a view of the river, Great War Island,\n\nLido, are just some of the most distinctive features of this “city within a city”. The remnants of the\n\nOld Town and the Millenium tower, the so-called Tower of Sibinjanin Janko at Gardos are\n\ninvaluable for the history and culture of this city and are definitely Zemun’s most recognisable\n\nsymbols.\n\nIf you’re planning to stay in Belgrade and you also belong to a group of river lovers who prefer a\n\nmore peaceful pace of life, Zemun can be an ideal place to stay in Belgrade. And if you’reparticularly fond of river fish that the Danube fishermen deliver to the well-known restaurants in\n\nZemun every day, then this is the proper location that you have to select as your base for further\n\nexploration of Belgrade. We should also mention that Zemun is very well-connected to the city\n\ncentre and almost all parts of the city.\n\nSo, before you set out, do check out what our web site has to offer in the section Zemun\n\nand pick an apartment which will suit you best.\n\nNovi apartmani wishes you a pleasant stay in Zemun."
