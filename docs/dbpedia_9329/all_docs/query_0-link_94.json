        "text": "Nowadays the migrations (voluntary and forced) and concomitant processes of socio-cultural transformations are an important sphere of studies among the Balkan ethnologists and anthropologists. In our migration investigations we often follow “western” models of typologizations and theoretical explanations, regardless of the question whether they are relevant to the specific Balkan reality or not. The initial inspiration was the author’s inner conviction that we should not break the local/regional research traditions and neglect uncritically what was achieved by the scholars of generations before us. Jovan Cvijić is one of these early, influential and still frequently cited Balkan researchers among the pioneers taking interest in the study of migrations on the Balkan Peninsula, researching their causes, directions, characteristics and induced by them transformations of cultural patterns, languages, religions, and ethnicities. The paper critically examines his research work, discussing some of its controversies, on the one hand, and contributions and influence on the study of Balkan migrations, on the other. Simultaneously the author tries to put the methodological and theoretical achievements and findings of Cvijić in the broader context of some of the contemporary migration theories and compare them.\n\nDue to numerous transformation problems which determined the collapse of the industrial sector, unemployment and low living standards, an increasing number of working population leaves Serbia. For a very long time, Serbian emigration was directed primarily to the developed Western European countries (especially Germany and Austria). However, Slovakia has recently joined the narrow circle of countries-destinations for emigrants from Serbia. The article focuses on this wave of the working population emigration from Serbia to Slovakia and considers it in the framework of the contemporary migration theories, especially the push-and-pull factors theory. The research data was compared with the relevant data from previous studies. The research was conducted in the municipality of Kovačica (northern Serbia) with a questionnaire on the sample of 100 respondents (the snowball method was applied), and the authors also used various other data sources: statistical data (censuses, migration stati...\n\nVojvodina, an autonomous province in the Republic of Serbia, is ethnically one of the most heterogeneous regions of Europe and therefore represents an inexhaustible subject of research. There are more than 20 ethnic groups living in Vojvodina. According to the most recent 2011 census, there are 1,931,809 people living in Vojvodina and the Serbs make the largest ethnic group, 66.7% of the total population. Hungarians make 13.0% of the total population of Vojvodina and with a somewhat smaller proportion come the Slovaks, Croats, Rroma and Rromanians. In the period between the two censuses the reduction in the number of members of all ethnic groups was recorded and the only ethnic group that increased in number was the Rroma. Different socio-economic and demographic trends have had a great influence on the reduction of the share of members of almost all ethnic groups in the total population of Vojvodina in the last decades. First of all, it was influenced by forced migrations in the ni...\n\nEurope has been challenged with the waves of migrations recently, but such a phenomenon is not a newborn aspect of \"our\" European identity. However, it was the Balkans - the region which due to Ottoman expansion and its revision suffered numerous migrations (voluntary and involuntary) and relocations (frequently forced) of its inhabitants. The results of such a policy was a constant need to revenge, we mean Balkan nations wanted to revenge on Turks and vice versa. Such phenomenon is clearly visible in the course of 19th century (Russo-Turkish wars, Berlin congress, shaping of modern Balkan states), but it has roots in older periods. In June 1690, as a result of Great Turkish War, from 30 to 40,000 Serbs gathered in Belgrade led by the patriarch Arsenije III. Čarnojević to seek refuge in Hungary. This is called the Great Migration or in Serbian Velike seobе Srba (Велике сеобе Срба), the main area to settle for Serbs was current territory of Vojvodina, but they were moving also to present day Hungary and Romania. The main aim of this paper is to provide the scholars and public with a new unbiased view of Serb migration 1690 and its place in national identity and myths. One of quests to solve is the \"war of numbers\" such typical for Balkan region (concerning Great Serb migration from 40.000 to 500.000) and how is the Serb migration perceived in modern European historiography – primarily Czechoslovak, Albanian and Anglo-American compared to traditional and modern Serbian.\n\nAccording to the results from the 2011 Census, in Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (hereinafter referred to as ’Vojvodina’) there were 1,815 Slovenians, or 45% of the total number of Slovenians in the Republic of Serbia. Slovenians make up only 0.09% of the total population in Vojvodina. All demographic indicators show a profound demographic decline in the population based on biological depopulation that began in the late 1960s. Furthermore, a negative trend in natural increase was further strengthened by inverse migrations that started several years after they had colonized Vojvodina, especially south Banat. Slovenians in Vojvodina, at an average age of 52.1 years, were ranked second place in the rank of ethnicity by age, which clearly indicates to intense process of population ageing and inability to achieve positive effects of natural movement. Although this population is statistically small in number, this paper clarifies the underlying causes of extremely unfavorable demographic trends that characterized Slovenian population in Vojvodina over the last several decades.
