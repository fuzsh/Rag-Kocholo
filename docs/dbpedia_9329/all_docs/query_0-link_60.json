        "text": "Day 1. Meet in Belgrade and transfer to the starting point, Bački Breg, at the Hungarian border.\n\nDay 2. Bački Breg – Apatin. (ca.58km)\n\nThe route leads through the flat land of Vojvodina, formerly Hungarian, along the nature reserves of the Duna-Drava Nemzeti Park, the Grand Bački Canal, which leads all the way to Novi Sad, and the beautiful Sombor.\n\nApatin is the beer capital of Serbia and home to the tasty Jelen beer. A visit to the brewery is on the agenda for those who like it.\n\nPossible excursions:\n\n• Visit the Jelen brewery\n\n• Visit Bačko-Bodroška District office explanation about the famous large painting\n\nDay 3. Apatin – Bač (approx. 54km).\n\nThe route continues through the pockmarked former marshland of the Danube to Bač, with its impressive fortress and faubourg. Bač Castle was the guard post of the Hungarian kings for a long time against the advancing Turks. It is the namesake of Bačka County, the surrounding region.\n\nThe border with Croatia is sometimes only a stone’s throw away. The flora and fauna-rich nature reserve “Gornje Podunavlje” in the Danube Delta separates the two countries. There is a lot of agriculture along the way, fish farms and fruit orchards, ponds, ditches, and forests.\n\nPossible excursions:\n\n– Visit a fish farm\n\n– Boat visit Gornje Podunavlje\n\nDay 4. Bač – Bačka Palanka (approx. 47km).\n\nWe cycle through the flat land of Vojvodina; in the distance, the hills of the Fruska Gora loom up, formerly an island in the Pannonian Sea, pushing the Danube out of its course. Its name reminds us that Charlemagne’s empire once extended to these parts. Hidden in the hills, 17 orthodox monasteries have been preserved, some of which we will visit later.\n\nPossible Excursion:\n\nKaradjordjevo\n\nDay 5. Bačka Palanka – Novi Sad (approx.45-60km).\n\nOn the other side of the Danube lies the fortified town of Ilok, the easternmost city in Croatia, the first stop for the day, where we can enjoy the view of the plain we have left behind.\n\nFrom Ilok, the route follows the Danube to Novi Sad. The bolder among us can do it on the ridge road of Fruska Gora, but this requires a climb, which is rewarded at the end with a long descent.\n\nThe Museum of Vojvodina will be pleased and proud to show you the three golden Roman helmets found in the area. The museum is free of charge for holders of the Sultans Trail Passport.\n\nPossible excursions :\n\n– Visit Stari Podrum Ilok\n\n– Visit the museum of Vojvodina\n\n– Visit Petrovaradin\n\nDay 6. Novi Sad – Stari Slankamen. (approx.48km)\n\nVia the Danube bridge, we leave Novi Sad in the direction of the mighty castle of Petrovaradin. Then the route takes us past Sremski Karlovci, where we visit the “Chapel of Our Lady of Peace”. Here, after the failed second siege of Vienna in 1683, the peace negotiations between the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires took place under the mediation of a Dutch and English diplomat, resulting in the “Peace of Karlowitz” (1699), which put an end to the Great Turkish War (1683-1699).\n\nThe route continues away from the Danube through the lovely vine-covered foothills of the Fruska Gora. Enthusiasts are encouraged to visit two or three beautiful Orthodox monasteries hidden in the hills. After this, the route continues through the flat land of Srem, on the high bank of the Danube. At the end of the ride, there is a view of the lower bank, and on a clear day, one can see as far as 60km across the Pannonian plain.\n\nPossible excursions:\n\n– “Kapela Gospe od Mira” in Karlovci\n\n– Visit Monasteries of Veliki Remeta, Grgeteg and Krušedol\n\n– Wine tasting in Vinarija Acumincum, Stari Slankamen\n\nDay 7. Stari Slankamen – Belgrade (approx. 52km).\n\nOn the high bank of the Danube follows an utterly flat ride to Belgrade, ending with descent in Zemun to the waterfront, where we follow the cycle path on the quay, a popular strolling place for the inhabitants of Zemun and nearby New Belgrade.\n\nDay 8. Day of rest in Belgrade.\n\nFrom the fortified citadel Kalemegdan, at the confluence of the Sava and Danube, take a view over the Pannonian plain. The fortress was founded by the Celts, extended by the Romans, and rebuilt by the Ottomans, a historical bone of contention of empires and razed to the ground 36 times in the course of history.\n\nShop, enjoy one of the traditional restaurants and in the evening, relish the nightlife in Strahinjića bana at the Danube shore or Skadarlia, the Montmartre of Belgrade.\n\nThe Lonely Planet declared Belgrade the best nightlife city in Europe.\n\nSights to see:\n\n– Underground city of Belgrade\n\n– Nazi camp at the Belgrade Fairground\n\nDay 9. Belgrade – Smederevo (approx. 56km).\n\nThe route leads through the gentle hills covered with fruit orchards along the Danube to Smederevo, at the confluence of the Danube and the Great Morava.\n\nDuring the Ottoman advance, Smederevo was briefly the capital of the Serbian Kingdom, later crucial for the Ottomans, who had stationed their river fleet here. The city was surrounded by mighty walls with impressive towers, which stood intact until the Second World War. Unfortunately, the explosion of a parked ammunition train caused considerable damage to the still imposing defences.\n\nSights to see:\n\n– Smederevo fortress\n\n– Smederevo Museum\n\nDay 10. Smederevo – Velika Plana (approx.51km).\n\nAfter Smederevo, we leave the Danube and continue through the valley of the Great Morava River, which will bring us to the Bulgarian border. The route, known as the “via Militaris”, has been used to travel towards Istanbul since Roman times.\n\nThe route will take us into “traditional Serbia”, characterised by gently rolling hills, farmland, peaceful monasteries, scattered towns and rural villages, and mighty wood-covered mountains in the background. In the villages, children’s voices are still heard, and the elderly drink their rakia and coffee in the streets. The status symbol of every man here appears to be a red tractor, without which it seems impossible to exist.\n\nDay 11. Velika Plana – Jagodina (approx. 48km).\n\nThe river winds its way along several hills, and so do we, with the highest point, just before Jagodina, at 250m. Jagodina is a spacious, elongated rural town with all amenities, including a large water park and a regional museum.\n\nDay 12. Jagodina – Kruševac (approx.56km).\n\nOn this day, we ride mainly in the shadow of the Juhor, a 60km long, relatively inaccessible ridge with Veliki Vetren (774m) as its highest point.\n\nKruševac, founded in 1371 by King Lazar, who also had his palace built here, is a glorious place in Serbian history. It was here that the Serbian army gathered at the outset of the dramatic Battle of Kosovo (1389). A battle that is still deeply engraved in the Serbian soul. The ruins of Lazar’s town are still visible today.\n\nDay 13. Kruševac – Aleksinac (approx. 50km).\n\nBetween Kruševac and Aleksinac, we face our first challenges, with two small hills of 350m and 320m and slopes up to 4.9%. Aleksinac is a lovely old town at the foot of the Stara Planina (Balkan mountains).\n\nDay 14. Aleksinac – Niš (approx.35km).\n\nDespite a slope of 7.9%, a gentle ride to Niš, situated at the Nisava, a tributary of the Great Morava. The town lies on a ford in the Nisava, traditionally a crossing point, where the Romans founded Naissus, and the Ottomans built a fortress. The old fort has been fully preserved and is the city’s landmark. Niš forms the informal border between east and west. Constantine the Great, the man who, as emperor of Rome, founded Constantinople, was born here.\n\nSights to see:\n\n– The Niš fortress\n\n– The Nazi Concentration Camp\n\n– The Skull Tower\n\n– The birthplace of Constantine\n\nDay 15. Niš – Bela Palanka (approx. 42km).\n\nIn this stage, we climb to 600m with a maximum slope of 11.2%. We ride through the mountain area of the Suva Planina or Dry Mountains. On the other side of the Nisava are the Stara Planina, which run all the way to the Black Sea and have given their name to the whole region under the name “Balkan”. The word Balkan, by the way, is of Turkish origin and means Forested Mountains. In their aversion to the Ottoman past, the Bulgarians prefer the Slavic name ‘Stara Planina’, or Old Mountains.\n\nThe origin of Bela Palanka lies in Roman times when it was known as Remesiana. A Roman milestone in the centre and the excavated remains of a church are reminders of this past. The Ottomans built a wall of stones and earth that is still visible and had a large Caravanserai, of which nothing remains. Nevertheless, all these remains indicate that it was a significant place on the road to Constantinople. A small part of this road is still visible at the water mill on the edge of town.\n\nDay 16. Bela Palanka – Dimitrovgrad (approx. 60km).\n\nOn the final day of this tour, we reach a respectable altitude of 691m, with a maximum gradient of 8.6% and a long descent. Halfway through this stage, at about 27km, we arrive in Pirot, a town with a character all of its own, known for its woven carpets, unique cheese, beautifully restored fortress, promenade along the Nisava riverside and a fascinating regional museum. The ideal place for a lunch break.\n\nThe last stretch to Dimitrovgrad is a piece of cake. Gradually we rise another 100m, but that is it. Dimitrovgrad, just a few kilometres from the Bulgarian border, wedged in a narrow valley between a large railway yard and motorways, is a typical border town popular with Bulgarians for dining.\n\nDay 17. Transport back to Belgrade"
