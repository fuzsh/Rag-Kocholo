        "text": "Belgrade's Old Town, also known as Zemun, spread around Gardos Hill, is one of the city's oldest parts. Throughout the centuries, as the Balkans were part first of the Roman, then the Byzantine, and then the Austro-Hungarian empires, this area transformed into a beautiful neighborhood with narrow streets, cute buildings, and breathtaking views opening from the hill onto the Old Town and the Danube River below.\n\nBig Square (Veliki Trg) is the heart of Zemun and a focal point for locals and visitors. This bustling spot is surrounded by picturesque buildings, cafes, and shops, creating a vibrant atmosphere that invites people to explore its nooks and crannies. The on-site market is a must-visit for those looking to immerse themselves in the local culture, offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and a taste of traditional Serbian cuisine.\n\nOne of the prominent landmarks in Zemun is the Catholic Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. A short walk away from it is another religious gem, the Saint Nicholas Church.\n\nGardos Tower, an iconic symbol of Zemun, stands tall on the Gardos hill, offering a sweeping panorama of the Danube and the city. The nearby Zemun Cemetery holds historical significance and provides a serene place for reflection.\n\nFor those seeking to explore typical Balkan architecture, the White Bear Tavern is the only remaining example of such and the oldest surviving edifice on the urban territory of Belgrade. Another well-preserved historical building in the vicinity is Icko's House.\n\nThe Franciscan Monastery of Saint John the Baptist and Saint Anthony is a peaceful sanctuary within the neighborhood, while the Homeland Museum of Zemun provides an excellent opportunity to delve into its history.\n\nDon't miss the House with the Sundial, an architectural gem that adds to Zemun's unique charm, and finally, Gospodska Street, a picturesque thoroughfare lined with quaint shops and eateries, perfect for a leisurely stroll.\n\nAnyone with a taste for historic churches, local delicacies, or simply keen on soaking in the ambiance of charming old streets, will find plenty of this and more in Zemun. So, take our self-guided walk and discover the magic of Belgrade's Old Town, where history, culture, and beauty intertwine in a captivating mix."
