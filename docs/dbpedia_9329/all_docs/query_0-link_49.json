Our guide Jovana was informative, friendly and told some great stories, goving an great insight into Serbia and its people. She also answered our questions and gave some good tips. I would defintely recommend joining this tour.\n\n647kirstyc on tripadvisor\n\nReviewed on July 23rd, 2024\n\nAmazing tour and guide Subotica\n\nStefan was a fantastic guide and driver for our full day tour of Subotica - The Culture of Vojvodina. The winery was beautiful and not touristy. The highlight was the amazing art nouveau architecture in Subotica and the tour of the synagogue. Stefan made this tour come alive with his incredible knowledge and relaxed personality. The final stop was lunch in a charming country restaurant for local cuisine. I highly recommend this tour\n\nWinstonthedog on tripadvisor\n\nReviewed on July 10th, 2024\n\nAmazing experiance\n\nWe had an amazing week going around in beautiful Serbia, visited lots of beautiful & interesting places,Milos was very professional, everything was perfect.
