        "text": "edit\n\nBrief History\n\nThe beginning of the Serbian state starts with the White Serbs settling the Balkans led by the Unknown Archont, who was asked to defend the frontiers from invading Avars. Emperor Heraclius granted the Serbs a permanent dominion in the Sclavinias of Western Balkans upon completing their task. The Serbian Empire was proclaimed in 1346 under Stefan Dušan, during which time the country reached its territorial, spiritual and cultural peak, becoming one of the larger states in Europe. After the loss of independence to the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, Serbia briefly regained sovereignty under Emperor Jovan Nenad in the 16th century. Three Austrian invasions and numerous rebellions, such as the Banat Uprising, constantly challenged Ottoman rule. Vojvodina endured a century long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the Habsburg Empire in the 17th–18th centuries under the Treaty of Karlowitz.\n\nThe first modern independent Serbia was established in the course of the Serbian national revolution (1804–1817), and it lasted for several decades. In 1876, Montenegro and Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, proclaiming their unification with Bosnia. The formal independence of the country was internationally recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, which formally ended the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. In 1882, Serbia, ruled by King Milan, was raised to Kingdom. During the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the Kingdom of Serbia tripled its territory by acquiring part of Macedonia, Kosovo, and parts of Serbia proper. As for Vojvodina, during the 1848 revolution in Austria, Serbs of Vojvodina established an autonomous region known as Serbian Vojvodina.\n\nOn 28 June 1914 the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria at Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina by Gavrilo Princip (a Yugoslav unionist member of Young Bosnia) and an Austrian citizen, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Kingdom of Serbia. In defense of its ally Serbia, Russia started to mobilize its troops, which resulted in Austria-Hungary's ally Germany declaring war on Russia. The retaliation by Austria-Hungary against Serbia activated a series of military alliances that set off a chain reaction of war declarations across the continent, leading to the outbreak of World War I within a month. Serbia was part of The Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1918 and 1945, after which it was incorporated into Socialist Yugoslavia until 1991. Slobodan Milošević rose to power in Serbia in 1989 in the League of Communists of Serbia through a series of coups against incumbent governing members. Milošević promised reduction of powers for the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. This ignited tensions with the communist leadership of the other republics that eventually resulted in the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia from Yugoslavia.\n\nMilošević represented the Bosnian Serbs at the Dayton peace agreement in 1995, signing the agreement which ended the Bosnian War that internally partitioned Bosnia & Herzegovina largely along ethnic lines into a Serb republic and a Bosniak-Croat federation. On 5 October 2000, the fall of Milošević led to end of the international isolation Serbia suffered during the Milošević years. Milošević was sent to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on accusations of sponsoring war crimes and crimes against humanity during the wars in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo which he was held on trial to until his death in 2006. That same year, Montenegro became an independent country.\n\nedit\n\nGeography\n\nSerbia is a country located in the Balkans (a historical and geographical region of southeastern Europe) and in the Pannonian Plain (a region of central Europe). It shares borders with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Romania. Serbia claims a border with Albania as well through its disputed territory of Kosovo. It is landlocked, although access to the Adriatic is available through Montenegro, and the Danube River provides shipping access to inland Europe and the Black Sea.\n\nSerbia covers a total of 88,361 km², which places it at the 113th place in the world. Arable land covers 19,194 km², and woods cover 19,499 km² of the territory of Serbia without Kosovo. Its total border length amounts to 2,027 kilometres (Albania 115 kilometres, Bosnia and Herzegovina 302 kilometres, Bulgaria 318 kilometres, Croatia 241 kilometres, Hungary 151 kilometres, Macedonia 221 kilometres, Montenegro 203 kilometres and Romania 476 kilometres). All of Serbia's border with Albania, and parts of the borders with Macedonia, Montenegro, are under control of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo. It has 6,167 registered settlements, 207 urban and 5960 others (rural).\n\nedit\n\nEvents and Festivals\n\nCinema City Film Festival\n\nDespite its name, Cinema City is more than merely a film festival. This Novi Sad event features more than 150 film screenings and workshops during its eight days in June, but its opening event is a lively concert at the city’s historic Petrovaradin Fortress. Film screenings and premieres take place at four outdoor, and five indoor, cinemas throughout Novi Sad.\n\nEXIT Festival\n\nFew of the world’s rock concert venues boast as much history as Novi Sad’s Petrovaradin Fortress, where many of the world’s hottest musicians perform each July at the EXIT Festival. All six of the festival’s main arenas are situated within the fortress. This festival, among Eastern Europe’s biggest, also features an outdoor cinema, technology zone, and extreme sports arena.\n\nGuča Trumpet Festival\n\nEach August, more than 600,000 trumpet fans from around the world make the three-hour bus journey from Belgrade to Guča, a small Serbian town with a population of 2,000. This annual brass band festival is also sometimes called the Dragačevo Assembly. A few dozen of the world’s best brass bands battle it out during the main Sunday competition, but the festival also boasts a Friday opening concert, featuring previous winners who perform for brightly dressed folk dancers.\n\nBelgrade Beer Festival\n\nVisitors attending Belgrade’s annual beer showcase in August only have to shell out for the price of drinks. Between 2004 and 2010, the festival’s attendance numbers skyrocketed from 75,000 to 900,000. Many of these people arrive from other countries to sample more than 30 domestic and foreign brews that are available for tasting. Each of the festival’s four nights is filled with live music and fun.\n\nLeskovac Grill Festival\n\nIn September 2009, a 106-lb Serbian pljeskavica - grilled during this annual Leskovac tribute to meat - was declared the world’s biggest burger. That same year, the people who attended Serbia’s answer to Munich’s Oktoberfest also set an attendance record of 500,000. Each September, Leskovac’s main thoroughfare is closed to motorized traffic during this five-day festival filled with carnivals, fashion shows, concerts, and plenty meat!\n\nFestival of Street Musicians\n\nMore than 150 of the world’s most talented street musicians performed during the latest incarnation of this festival, held in central Novi Sad over four early September days. In addition to musicians playing a variety of instruments, the street performances also include dancers, actors, and even acrobats.\n\nBelgrade Music Festival\n\nNone of Serbia’s classical music festivals date further back than the event held in the nation’s capital each October. Although the festival’s focus is on traditional Balkan music, orchestras and performers from throughout the world may take part in the many concerts held at Belgrades’s Kolarac Hall, Yugoslav Drama Theater, and many other elegant venues. Musicians also have the opportunity to learn from some of Serbia’s finest artists during the creative master workshops.\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nRestaurants, clubs, cafe's and hotels are usually fully booked and organize New Years celebrations with food and live music. However, Serbian New Year's celebrations are most known for the outdoors festivities in Belgrade, and several other major cities such as Novi Sad, Nis and Jagodina. As of mid-December, cities are extensively decorated and lit. The decorations remain until way into January due to the persistent influence of the old, Julian calendar. Throughout the region, especially amongst former Yugoslav republics, Belgrade is known as the place to be for major parties, concerts and happenings. It has become common for large groups of Slovene's to visit their former capital and celebrate the beginning of a new year. Especially since the mid-nineties, street celebrations grew into mass gatherings with hundreds of thousands of people, celebrating New Year on one of several locations throughout Belgrade.\n\nedit\n\nWeather\n\nSerbia has a continental climate with warm summers are cold winters. Summers last from June to September with average highs of 25 °C to 30 °C in most of the country, sometimes hitting 40 °C. Winters last from December to February when temperatures during the day are around or slightly above zero, while nights are freezing and temperatures below -20 °C are possible. Summers are somewhat wetter compared to the other season, though rain or snow is possible year round. In summer, rain is more like heavy showers with enough sunshine during the days as well.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nBy Plane\n\nJat Airways might have some small planes available for flights within Serbia, but most flights go to Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Podogrica in Montenegro.\n\nBy Train\n\nApart from the international connections, Serbian Railways operates a few national lines which might be of use for travelers. Destinations from Belgrade include Novi Sad, Niš, Subotica, Užice, Požarevac, Šid and Požega.\n\nBy Car\n\nThe main roads, including the toll highways are generally in a good condition, but driving at night on secondary rural roads is best avoided. You can rent cars from many international and local firms at airports and bigger cities. You need an international driving permit and it's possible to bring your own car. Be sure to have proof of ownership and sufficient third party insurance.\n\nBy Bus\n\nLasta is the national long distance bus line and there are frequent connections, most of them originating or terminating in Belgrade. Bus lines tend to be faster but less comfortable than train travel in Serbia.\n\nBy Boat\n\nThere are no useful passenger services within Serbia.\n\nedit\n\nMoney\n\nSee also: Money Matters\n\nThe currency in Serbia is the Serbian Dinar (RSD). Banknotes come in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 dinar. Coins are in 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 dinar.\n\nThe Euro (€) is occasionally accepted, but not generally, and prices are often inflated when directly compared to the Dinar. Money can be converted in banks and exchange offices in the cities, and cash machines (ATM's) accepting all major international credit and debit cards are available throughout the countries.\n\nedit\n\nEat\n\nSerbian food is a typical Balkan mix of Asian and Middle Europe dishes. Serbs are very proud of their food, which is heavy on grilled meats and sausages, local cheeses and bread. Serbia is predominantly a meat-loving nation. In all major cities, there are many international restaurants, such as Italian and Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Lebanese, and Israeli. In Belgrade you can even find sushi or kosher food.\n\nThe most famous dish in Serbia is ćevapčići. Also called Ćevapi, they are a traditional food eaten throughout the Balkans. It consists of different types of minced meat (pork and beef) mixed together, shaped like small sausages, and then put on the grill. It is usually eaten with diced onion, and is very tasty. Depending on size, a portion of ćevapčići in a somun (pita bread), possibly with onion, ajvar or kajmak, is between €1.5 and €4.\n\nMost Serbian restaurants offer roštilj, a large plate of various unseasoned grilled meats, or any possible variety of grilled chicken wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese. It is possible to order fresh salads, plates of grilled vegetables, crepes, or omelettes if you are not carnivorous. Serbian cuisine is famous for its heavy use of varied vegetables, fresh or cooked.\n\nTurkish delicacies such as baklava, tulumba, and other Greek/Turkish treats are also commonly found.\n\nFoods that vegetarians and meat eaters alike should try include kajmak (something between cream cheese and butter) and ajvar, a savory spread made out of roasted red peppers. It is also worth visiting a pijaca (green market) to buy some fresh fruit, vegetables and other grocery items.\n\nTry Pljeskavica (pronounced Plee-es-ka-vee-tsa) - a hamburger-like streetfood that is prepared using various minced meats (beef, pork, goat, lamb) and spices. Served with a variety of Serbian condiments.\n\nedit\n\nSleep\n\nSerbia has a wide range of accommodation. On the budget side are camping grounds and hostels, while there are many options in the midrange class like guesthouses, small hotels and B&B's in some regions. Luxurious hotels are available in larger cities mainly.\n\nedit\n\nHealth\n\nSee also: Travel Health\n\nThere are no vaccinations legally required to travel to Serbia. It's a good thing to get your vaccinations in order before travelling to Serbia. The general vaccination against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Polio (DTP) is recommended. Also a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended.\n\nIf you are staying longer than 3 months or have a particular risk (travelling by bike, handling of animals, visits to caves) you might consider a rabies vaccination. Vaccination against hepatitis B is also sometimes recommended for stays longer than 3 months. It is also recommended to have a vaccination against tick borne encephalitis when you go hiking and/or camping for 4 weeks or more in the period of March to November.\n\nFinally, other possible health issues include diarrhea and other general travellers' diseases like motion sickness. Watch what you eat and drink and in case you get it, drink plenty of fluids (to prevent dehydration) and bring ORS.\n\nedit\n\nSafety\n\nSee also: Travel Safety\n\nIn terms of personal safety Serbia is considered to be one of the safest countries in Europe. There are no parts of country, or a town which are not considered safe. However it is advisable to beware of pickpockets, especially in Belgrade public transport or at main touristic sites. In general local population is extremely helpful and hospitable, especially in rural areas. Most of the people can speak some foreign language. The majority of younger population speak English, while among older people German, French and Russian is more common.\n\nedit\n\nKeep Connected\n\nInternet\n\nSerbia is very well covered with broad band internet. It is widely available in urban areas. Almost every cafe or restaurant has an wi-fi connection which is free for guests. Also there are public hot spots in major cities in some areas which are free of charge as well. There are 3G USB sticks at mobile operators which are easy to use and inexpensive to purchase.\n\nPhone\n\nSee also: International Telephone Calls\n\nInternational dial code for Serbia is +381. Emergency phone numbers are 192 (police), 193 (fire department) and 194 (ambulance). There are three mobile operators in Serbia:\n\n1. Telenor - 063, 062\n\n2. Telekom MTS (National telecom) - 064, 065\n\n3. VIP (Vodafone) - 060, 061\n\nPrepaid SIM cards usually cost 200 dinars and there is no need for identification when buying them. In some stores you can buy a simple mobile phone packaged with prepaid SIM card for 2000-3000 dinars.\n\nPost\n\nSerbia has a postal service since 1840 and it was one of 21 countries which founded the Universal Postal Union in 1874 in Bern. Serbia Post is today a public, state owned company with post offices in almost every village. Postal service is pretty good and reliable. In smaller towns work hours of post offices can vary so don't count on long working hours even on non-weekend days. For sending packages you can also use companies like UPS, TNT or DHL."
