After WWII, New Belgrade was built between the two old towns, connecting them. Today Zemun is part of Belgrade, a neighborhood and municipality north of New Belgrade, yet still different in spirit, speed and architecture, which is way better preserved than in the rest of the metropolis.\n\nThe old town of Zemun is a preserved area showcasing the urban life in the 18th and 19th century. The town existed since Roman times when it was known as Taurunum. Some remains of the fortress are still visible today, if you know where to look – around the Gardoš tower and the cemetery.\n\nThe top landmark of Zemun is Gardoš, the Millennium tower built in the nineteenth century to celebrate the thousand years of the Austrian empire. Another attraction is the derelict hostelry Beli Medved (The White Bear), the oldest in Belgrade, from the 17th century.\n\nOther important sights in the old town there are several orthodox and catholic churches, the old post office, houses of important traders from the 18th and 19th century, and a few schools.\n\nAdjacent to the old town is the Zemun Quay, one of the most popular walking zones in Belgrade.\n\nGetting here:\n\nSeveral buses go from Zeleni Venac square in downtown Belgrade to Zemun: 15, 17, 84, 701, 704… It is possible to reach Zemun on foot, by the quay, but it’s a very long walk. Biking is another option, but can be a major challenge because the narrow and steep streets.\n\nPhoto Gallery:\n\nHotels near old Zemun\n\nLocation\n\n[mappress mapid=”44″]"
