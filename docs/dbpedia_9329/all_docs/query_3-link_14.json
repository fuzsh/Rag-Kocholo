        "text": "I‚Äôm a Serbia local and, in this travel guide, I dish everything you need to know about visiting Zemun, a district of Belgrade.\n\nZemun is a great travel destination across the board and should be on your list of places to visit in Serbia. There are plenty of things to do, the gastronomy is unreal, and there are some excellent hotels. Plus, it‚Äôs way less visited than other destinations like Belgrade city center (and even the center isn‚Äôt that touristy).\n\nFrom where to stay to what to do, and how to get there, this guide includes everything you need to know to experience Zemun like a local. Let‚Äôs get into it.\n\nüëâ Jump to: Why Visit | How to Get There | Tours | Things to Do | Where to Stay | Restaurants | Tips\n\nFirstly, you should visit Zemun because of its unique history.\n\nIn the past, Zemun was an independent border town between the Austrian and Ottoman Empires.\n\nZemun joined with Belgrade in 1934, but given its independent history before that, it comes as no surprise that Zemun has a unique charm. It has an old-town vibe, rich history, and significant local pride. You‚Äôll also find a blend of Austrian and Ottoman design.\n\nMany still feel that Zemun is a separate and independent city. However, that‚Äôs not the case. Zemun is a significant part of Belgrade and its history.\n\nFurther, Zemun is full of diversity and unexpected sites.\n\nI recently took some friends from Morocco to explore Zemun. Can you guess where we spent almost an hour? At the cemetery! They were so surprised that people from different religions were buried together.\n\nAlso, compared to the city center of Belgrade, Zemun is a calm piece of paradise. It has one of the best walking areas in Serbia, amazing views from Gardos, and a perfect balance between hectic city life and nature.\n\nAll in all, make sure that Zemun is your number-one stop while exploring all the things to do in Belgrade!\n\nHow to Get to Zemun from Belgrade\n\nYou can get to Zemun from Belgrade‚Äôs center via bus, train, or taxi. In this section, I‚Äôll cover each option step-by-step.\n\nWhatever you do, one thing is for sure ‚Äì you will love the ease of transportation here in Belgrade. To get from the Belgrade city center to Zemun is easy, fast, and rarely takes more than 30 minutes.\n\nUnless you decide to walk, which takes about one hour and fifty minutes. That‚Äôs actually not too bad, though, right?\n\nA couple of tips to remember when planning your trip to Zemun:\n\nFirst, you will need cash Serbian Dinars (RSD) or a credit card (for a taxi) to use transportation.\n\nSecond, if possible, always go to Zemun from Belgrade‚Äôs city center (versus from further out). It‚Äôs more affordable, closer, and easier to move.\n\nBelgrade to Zemun by Bus\n\nUse bus 95 from Skadarska (Skadarlija) and ride to stop Sava Centar, then wait for bus 88, which will take you to the heart of Zemun.\n\nImportant: remember to buy a bus transport card at any corner shop so that you can move freely. You need to buy the plastic card for 250 RSD (about $2.28 USD), and it will last for three months. You can add more money to that card for bus rides as you go.\n\nOne bus ride ticket is 89 RSD (about $0.81 USD), and you have the privilege of using it for an hour.\n\nAlso, make sure that you validate your ticket every time you enter the bus.\n\nTime: approximately 27 minutes\n\nTicket price: about $0.81 USD\n\nBelgrade to Zemun by Train\n\nYou can use the train to get to Zemun from Pancevacki Most Station. There, you should board the ‚ÄúBG Voz,‚Äù which rides to Batajnica. Ride this train for six stops.\n\nTo Pancevacki Most Station, you can come from almost any part of the city. If you are using any of the following buses: 16, 23, 48, 33, 95, 96, 27e, or 48, to get to Pancevacki Most, you should step out on the station named ‚ÄòAleksandar Nikolic.‚Äô\n\nFor exact times, check out the train schedule here. You can also make online reservations.\n\nTime: 50 minutes\n\nTicket price: about $0.81 USD\n\nPro local tip: if you are planning to explore Zemun on the bike, you can place it in Bg: Voz for a small extra price.\n\nBelgrade to Zemun by Taxi\n\nThe exact distance between Belgrade and Zemun is only 13km. That‚Äôs why you can walk to Zemun in under two hours, and it means that a taxi may be the most viable option for many. Note that taxis are usually cheaper during the day than at night.\n\nTime: 10 ‚Äì 20 minutes, if it‚Äôs not rush hour\n\nPrice: about $9.20 USD for a day ride\n\nPro local tip: always use official Taxi service\n\n3 Awesome Tours\n\nSince Zemun has so much to offer, the easiest and fastest way to explore is by joining a tour.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, exploring Zemun on foot is the best way to explore the area ‚Äì and so many of these tours involve a fair amount of walking. In general, these tours are generally cheap, environmentally friendly, and the most exciting way to immerse yourself with the locals.\n\nHere are my top 3 recommended tours that you should try while in Zemun, Serbia.\n\nWalking Tour\n\nA walking tour with a local guide is perfect if you want to explore the real charm of Zemun. You will see the oldest parts of the area next to the Danube River.\n\nThis Zemun 2 Hour Walking tour features Gardos Tower, Nikolajevska Church, and ‚Äô‚ÄôWhite Bear‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì the oldest house in Zemun. The most central place of Zemun ‚Äì Madlenianum, is also a feature of this tour.\n\nThe tour ends with a long break at the Rakia bar. Trust me, this is an excellent place (Serbians never take foreign friends for a lousy drink, lol!).\n\nDuration: 2 hours\n\nStarting time: 11:00 AM\n\nPrice: ~$16 per person\n\nHow to Do it: Reserve Your Tour Via Get Your Guide\n\nE-Scooter Tour\n\nIf you prefer fresh air, but not walking a lot, then the E-scooter Zemun tour is a logical choice.\n\nThis tour will let you experience the local ways of Zemun while being friendly toward the environment.\n\nThis highly-rated E-Scooter Zemun Tour will show you a more Mediterranean atmosphere of Belgrade and you will feel like you are on the sea. If you want a private photo session, this tour offers a photographer as well.\n\nOn top of this, if you or your friends are real foodies, a street food boulevard can be included.\n\nDuration: 3 hours 30 mins\n\nStarting time: Monday ‚Äì Sunday: 11:00 AM ‚Äì 08:00 PM\n\nPrice: $37.91 per person\n\nHow to Do It: Reserve Your E-Scooter Tour via Viator\n\nBike Tour\n\nBike tours are awesome to see more of the city in a short amount of time. With this fun Zemun bike tour, you can explore Zemun and other areas of Belgrade as well.\n\nWhile riding along, you‚Äôll discover history of the area and get to experience both old and new parts of Belgrade.\n\nDon‚Äôt stress about bike rental. Bikes are provided. Plus, you will get to ride the bike next to the Danube.\n\nDuration: 4 hours\n\nStarting time: Every day at 3:30 pm\n\nPrice: $20.95 per person\n\nHow to Do it: Reserve Your Zemun Bike Tour via Viator\n\n7 Best Things to Do\n\nMarvel at Gardos Tower\n\nGardos Tower is a memorial tower located in the heart of Zemun. It was built in 1986 and is a real example of Gothic art. This is truly a historical and visual symbol of Zemun, and its history will leave you speechless.\n\nThat‚Äôs why you must visit this place in Zemun in my opinion.\n\nREAD NEXT: 23 Things to Do in Novi Sad Serbia (By a Local!)\n\nWitness the Opera & Theatre Madlenianum\n\nThe Opera & Theatre Madlenianum, or simply Madlenianum, is known as one of the best culture-related places to visit in Zemun.\n\nEven if you are not an opera fan, you should visit this famous building.\n\nIts architecture is impressive, and you can usually see the interior of the building. Moreover, this is the first private opera and theater in Serbia.\n\nKalvarija, Zemun\n\nKalvarija is an urban neighbor of Zemun with a rich history.\n\nResidents of Zemun are incredibly proud of this area and it‚Äôs connected with the park Tosin Bunar (also a famous tourism spot) with 128 painted steps.\n\nIn 2016, local activists collected 150 euros and painted the stairs by writing 128 names of people who lived, worked, and positively influenced Zemun.\n\nWalk Along the Danube River\n\nWalking next to the river is practically mandatory in Zamun, especially in the summer. During the summer, the whole Danube River area is full of fun things to do.\n\nYou can ride bumper cars, go on boat rides, and try some delightful homemade cookies. And of course, some swans will only make your Zemun visit more magical.\n\nGrab a Bite at Cafeteria Gardos\n\nAre you looking for a great place to rest from your bike tour in Zemun? Cafeteria Gardos will welcome you for a quick tea, coffee, and some French food bites.\n\nThis place also looks fantastic in photos (if you are an Instagram fan), and it‚Äôs most magical during the winter.\n\nSoak in History at the White Bear Tavern\n\nApart from Belgrade Fortress, the ‚ÄúWhite Bear Tavern‚Äù is the oldest surviving building in the Belgrade area, dating to the mid-17th century. It was originally a ‚Äúkafana,‚Äù or a type of community bistro.\n\nDepending on who you ask, it might be the oldest house in the Belgrade area, though it is certainly one of the best preserved examples of Serbian history.\n\nIt was built in the 1600s, and during its long life, it operated as a tavern, then a real-life dungeon, and even as a rooming house.\n\nToday, this house is completely abandoned and it‚Äôs under the city‚Äôs protection.\n\nYou can find the White Bear Tavern just off the main strip of Zemun at 10 Vasilija Vasilijeviƒáa Street.\n\nPaddle Board in Zemunski Park\n\nNext to the big city square (Veliki trg) is Zemunski Park. This is the biggest Zemun park and the main one. The park is located on the old border where Zemun quarantine once stood.\n\nHere, you can visit two churches, one elementary and one high school.\n\nThe park is rich with statues, and overall, this is a great place to relax and find silence from the city‚Äôs rush.\n\nüëâ Pro local tip: If you are visiting during the summer, you must visit Daska & Veslo for stand-up paddle boarding, great music, amazing fast food, and an endless summer vibe.\n\nMoreover, from here, you can paddle around the War Island (Ratno ostrvo) and explore a real untouched river island in Belgrade.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nThe great thing about Zemun is that it‚Äôs affordable.\n\nStill, for being in the capital city of Serbia, Zemun offers a variety of different accommodations for everyone‚Äôs wallet. It‚Äôs cheaper to stay here in a luxury hotel than in any western European country.\n\nHere are the best places to stay in Zemun, depending on your budget:\n\nBest Luxury Hotels\n\nHotel Zlatnik\n\nFour-star hotel\n\nLocated in the heart of Zemun\n\nOffers great transportation connections\n\nGreat for business and vacation trips\n\nClick to check prices and availability on Tripadvisor\n\nHotel Theater Belgrade\n\nFour-star hotel\n\nModern rooms\n\nNear the river\n\nPets are allowed\n\nMost suitable for children and family\n\nCheck prices and availability on Booking.com\n\nBest Mid-Range Hotels\n\nHotel D10\n\nFresh design\n\nNear the Dunabe and Gardos Tower\n\nHotel for non-smokers exclusively\n\nAirport ride included\n\nThe best choice for sleep with breakfast\n\nCheck prices and availability on Booking.com\n\nBest Budget Hotels\n\nGardos Riverview\n\nGreat location, next to the Gardos Tower\n\nAn amazing river view\n\nFree parking\n\nGreat for children\n\nCheck prices and availability on Booking.com\n\nVilla Petra\n\nClose to Zemun‚Äôs most famous landmarks\n\nGreat for those for are eager for authentic local interior\n\nNon-smoking rooms and great for children\n\nFree breakfast\n\nCheck prices and availability on Tripadvisor\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nFoodies, brace yourselves.
