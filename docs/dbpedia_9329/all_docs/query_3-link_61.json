        "text": "Even today, people say that Zemun represents a city within the city. The symbol of Zemun is the Millennium Tower on Gardo≈° Hill, located in the central part of the oldest preserved fortress from the 14th century. The Tower, widely known as the Tower of Janos Hunyadi, is open for visitors every day. The most interesting part of the Tower is the balcony with a viewpoint from which you can enjoy the panoramic view of the city during bright winter days.\n\nOld Zemun attracts many visitors with its narrow streets and old buildings from the period of Austro-Hungarian rule, traditionally hospitable people, authentic cuisine and cozy atmosphere in its restaurants. We suggest you take a walk during the day on the always crowded Zemun promenade, along the Danube bank, where you can relax, as well as taste fish specialties and have a good time listening to urban traditional folk music."
