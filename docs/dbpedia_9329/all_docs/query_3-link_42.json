        "text": "GARDOŠ TOWER\n\nSome of the first stories about the Zemun Fortress date back to 9th and 10th century. Today there can be seen just ruins of the medieval citadel. In the center of these ruins stands a magnificent tower. This main landmark of Zemun is actually a symbol of Hungarian domination who once lived in this area. Gardoš Tower is also known as Millennium Tower or The Tower of Janos Hunyadi.\n\nHOUSE WITH THE SUNDIAL\n\n(Dubrovačka Street 2)\n\nThis house built in 1828, decorated with the sundial is unique in Zemun. It is in Dubrovačka Street. Its architecture style is a mixture of classicism and baroque. Well-known Serbian writer, Jovan Subotić, spent his last years in this magic house.\n\nKARAMATA FAMILY HOUSE\n\n(Matije Gupca Street 2)\n\nThe greatest part of the house was built in 1764 by a rich merchant from Zemun, Kuzman Jovanović. In 1772, the house was bought for 4,000 forints by Dimitrije Karamat, whose descendants still live here. Interior is well-preserved with the 18th and 19th century furniture and the works of famous painters such as Georgije Tenecki and Pavle Đurković.\n\nIČKO’S HOUSE\n\nIčko’s House is a Classical-style building, built in 1793. It consists of a basement, ground floor and partial second floor formed by a high gable roof with dormers. The tavern Marko Kraljević was on the ground floor, while the first floor was used for housing. The building is one of the oldest preserved houses, and is representative of a town house at the end of the 18th century. The building is known as Ičko’s House because the rebel diplomat and trader Peter Ičko stayed in it from 1802–1803 when he had to leave Belgrade after the return to power of the Dahije. Ičko played a role in the First Serbian Uprising in 1804, working with the Serbian rebels.\n\nKALEMEGDAN BELGRADE FORTRESS\n\nIt is an old citadel built on the white reef on the confluence of the River Sava and Danube. Throughout the centuries it was many times destroyed and reconstructed. Today it is the main landmark of the Serbian capital. Visiting Upper and Lower Town of the Belgrade Fortress and having a walk around Kalemegdan Park is essential if you want to experience the true spirit of history. Feeling of eternity is even more present thanks to “Victor”, a monumental sculpture - proud guardian of the city, peace and time.\n\nZEMUN’S QUAY\n\nZemunski Kej, as its name suggests (Zemun's quay), is located alongside the right bank of the Danube. The promenade itself begins below the Gardoš hill, at the square of Veliki Trg and after 2, 5 kilometers it continues into the municipality of Novi Beograd. It is also location of several old and famous kafanas in Zemun, like Venecija, Stara Kapetanija, Šaran, and many other bars and restaurants. Last few years the main hosts on the Zemun promenade are gorgeous swans always ready to welcome new guests.\n\nUŠĆE SHOPPING CENTER\n\nFavorite place and unforgettable moments – everything can be found here. UŠĆE Shopping Center is the biggest shopping center in Serbia and in whole region. Ideally located between old and New Belgrade, it connects cultural and business center of Serbian capital. On 50.000 square meters there are more than 135 shops, restaurants, bars, playrooms, supermarket and one of the best cinemas in the region."
