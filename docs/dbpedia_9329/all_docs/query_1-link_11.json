        "text": "Bordering with Hungary, Romania, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbian northernmost Autonomous Province of Vojvodina represents the most developed and the most ethically diverse regions of the Republic of Serbia. Novi Sad is the capital of Vojvodina, the second largest town of Serbia, situated on both banks of the Danube River, renowned for being the liberal city of music, art and fun. Novi Sad is our home town with population of roughly 400.000 inhabitants which is European Capital of Culture in 2022 – pls ask for our special offers for events in culture.\n\nVojvodina is positioned in the Pannonian Plain, and covers the area of 21.506 sq km with the population of about two million inhabitants. Serbs make the absolute majority in the Vojvodina Province with a population of 1,143,723, followed by Hungarians, Croats, Slovaks, Montenegrins, Romanians and smaller ethnic groups who live in 466 inhabited settlements registered in Vojvodina, which have shaped their habitus through long history of multi-generational (co)existence.\n\nIt has been long known that the name “Syrmia” in the Middle Ages meant not only the area between the rivers Sava and Danube, but also the territory on the right bank of the Sava, today’s Mačva, which was called in the sources “Further Syrmia” (Sirmia Ulterior). The Byzantine and Hungarian Syrmia in the 10th-13th centuries, Predrag Komatina\n\nThe old house of Vojvodina was built from materials found in the surroundings – soil, wood, straw, reed, and used to be organized in favor of peasants needs who lived there. The first overground houses in Vojvodina were constructed from soil with a single unit, without windows. After arrival of the Habsburg Monarchy in the 18th century there were applied rules and regulations on building of villages, creation of streets and appearance of houses, which was called the “ušoravanje naselja” /formation of settlements/. That is how the houses of Vojvodina emerged, called ‘dužne kuće’ /longitute houses/. The main features of this type of the Vojvodina houses are the rectangular plots on which houses were erected along the streets. Similar to organization of yards, developed house space itself was also characterized by an elongated rectangle with three-partial organization of the inner space and featuring the narrower facade turned towards the street.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire administration, the present areas of Bosnia, Slavonia, Baranya and Srem were commonly called Pannonia. One of the larger towns of Pannonia was the town of Serbinum, before the fake “Slavic” settlement/immigration. In medieval time the space of Slavonia, Baranya, Srem, Backa and Banat was known as Raška – Rascia, Racszag, Ráczország, Ratzenland, Rezenland, after the Serbs Rascians. In Serbia there is still existing the Stara Raska, Raška oblast, which is nowadays the Raški okrug /Raska county. If we go deeper in the past, it is known that the ancient Etruscans called themselves the Rasenes – Rasenna, Rasna/Raśna.\n\nIn the 15th and the 16th century the Serb despotes possessed estates and properties in Srem, Banat, Bačka, Baranya and Slavonia. Among famous Serbian despots who possessed lands and estates there are Vuk Grgurević Branković – Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk, Đorđe Branković, Jovan Branković, Ivaniš Berislavić, Stefan Berislavić, Radić Božić – commander of the Serbian sajkasi troops – river flotilla guardians, Pavle Bakić – commander of the Serbian Sajkasi – river flotilla guardians, Stefan Štiljanović. Residence of the Serb despotes was located in the town of Kupiniku, today Kupinovo in Srem district, and despotes also had their estates in other places like Morović, Berkasovo, Apatin, Vukovar, Borovo, Slankamen, Bečej, Vršac, Lipovo, etc…\n\nThere was the Serbian Tsardom of Jovan Nenad Crnojevic in the area of the south Pannonian plane. The supreme commander of tsar Jovan Nenad Crnojevic was the Srem duke of Radoslav Čelnik. The most famous Serbian vice-duke and all the Serbian territories within the Habsburg Monarchy was Jovan Monasterliija, who also was the military commander and the commander of the Serbian police – 1686-1704. Among other most famous commanders of the Serbian police (Rascianica militia) was Jovan Popović Tekelija.\n\nThe history records colonization from Bukovina in 1833 of some 400 families of the Hungarian ethnic group – Sekely people into the villages in Vojvodina of the south Banat area – Vojlovica, Skorenovac and Ivanovo. Sekelyi population of Vojvodina preserved and maintain their customs, culture, heritage, traditions, creativity….\n\nDuring the history there was the Serbian Voivodship – Dutchy and later the Dutchy of Serbia and the Timis Banat. In 1918 the areas of Srem, Baranya, Bačka and were unified with the Serbian mainstream entity of Kingdom of Serbia, by the decision of the Great Assembly of the Serbs, the Bunyevci people – catholic Serbs, the Sokci people – catholic Rascians/Rašani/Srbs and other national minorities, held in Novi Sad on 25 November 1918. On the day before, the 24th November 1918 the Assembly in Ruma decided that Srem district should join the Kingdom of Serbia, to its foundation concept which promotes national culture. The seat of the Matica srpska institution is since 1864 located in Novi Sad.\n\nDue to its vast fertile land, Vojvodina has long been called the “granary of Europe”, and because of its multinational population, the “little Europe”. Its administrative capital, town of Novi Sad, is the center of cultural activity in the region, and was poetically referred to as the “Serbian Athens”."
