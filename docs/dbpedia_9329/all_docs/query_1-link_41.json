        "text": "Vojvodina sits in the northern reaches of Serbia, on the vast Pannonian Plain that sweeps down from neighbouring Hungary. Bordered by rivers on two sides, the countryside is dotted with many small towns, monasteries and castles.\n\nWhile most of Vojvodina is rural, the capital city of Novi Sad is a bustling city of 400,000 people, and the cultural heart of the province. A charming blend of traditional Serbian culture and modern ways of life, the city has a number of theatres, museums, art galleries and a number of fascinating historical buildings.\n\nThe countryside around Novi Sad and throughout Vojvodina is rich and fertile, providing much of the food for the rest of Serbia. A patchwork of farms, vineyards and fields, it's ideal for outdoor activities such as horseback riding, golf and hiking. Lake Palic is a popular weekend destination, with its art nouveau buildings, 19th-century spa and excellent eateries.\n\nOther popular towns and tourist destinations in Vojvodina include Sremski Karlovci, Subotica, Paracin, Titel and Vrsac. A driving tour of Vojvodina is an essential part of any holiday in Serbia, allowing travellers to experience the diverse local cultures that give each town a unique history and personality.\n\nThings to do in Vojvodina\n\nSerbia travel info\n\nElectricity\n\nElectrical current is 220-230 volts, 50Hz. Two-prong round pin attachment plugs as well as Schuko plugs are in use.\n\nLanguage\n\nSerbian is the official language.\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency of Serbia is the Serbian dinar (RSD), which is divided into 100 para. Dinars are not accepted in Kosovo, where the euro is the official currency. Credit cards are accepted by most of the larger hotels and shops in Serbia. Pounds sterling, US dollars and euros are the most widely accepted currencies for exchange. ATMs in the cities usually accept international bank cards, but can be hard to find in the more rural areas.\n\nTipping\n\nTipping is not obligatory in Serbian restaurants, but if patrons are satisfied with the service, a 10 to 15 percent tip will be appreciated. At bars and with taxis, it's fine to leave a tip by rounding off the amount.\n\nHealth\n\nAll eligible travellers should be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines, and visitors should consider vaccines for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and tick-borne encephalitis. Air pollution levels can be high, especially in winter, as heavy smoke from coal and wood burning heaters can stay in the air, and accidental release of toxic matter from factories is common. Travellers who have asthma or any other breathing difficulties should speak to their doctor before visiting. A reciprocal healthcare agreement entitles British nationals to free emergency treatment in Serbia but, due to a widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials, comprehensive travel health insurance is strongly recommended for all visitors. Tap water and unbottled beverages should not be consumed.\n\nSafety\n\nMost visits to Serbia are trouble free, but it is wise to take sensible precautions with valuables, as pick-pocketing, car theft, purse snatchings, and burglaries do occur in the larger cities. Protests occasionally occur in cities such as Belgrade, and travellers are advised to keep informed of current events and avoid large gatherings, as demonstrations can quickly turn violent. Those travelling to the south and UN-administered Kosovo are advised to check the local situation before departing. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move that has been recognised by almost 40 countries including the US and most of the EU, but has been opposed by Serbia as an 'illegal act'.\n\nLocal customs\n\nSerbians are generally very hospitable people and often enjoy visiting and chatting with others. There is a strong coffee culture throughout the country, and kissing is a common form of greeting for both men and women.\n\nHomosexuality is tolerated, but open displays of affection between same-sex couples are frowned upon. Visitors should carry their passports at all times for identification purposes, and should avoid taking photographs of any military or police buildings, personnel or operations in Serbia or Kosovo.\n\nDoing business\n\nBusiness people usually greet by shaking hands, maintaining eye contact and introducing themselves when entering the room, regardless of gender. The convention when greeting senior figures is to refer to them by their professional title, such as director, though other colleagues may be addressed by their first name. Business cards are common and often exchanged without any formal ritual; most Serbian professionals speak English, so it is not always necessary to hire a translator or translate business cards.\n\nDecisions are often made without consultation, and managers are not always strictly required to provide an explanation as to why a decision was reached. Business relationships are valued and many Serbian businesses may prioritise them over business matters. As a result, several meetings may occur before business details are confirmed. Operations can go slowly due to cumbersome bureaucracy, so it is a good idea to allow more time for deadlines. July and August are summer holidays and it is difficult to reach senior management during this period. Business hours are 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday.\n\nDuty free\n\nVisitors entering Serbia may bring the following goods without paying customs duty: personal baggage, clothing and jewellery; 200 cigarettes, 100 cigarillos, 50 cigars or 250g tobacco; 1 litre of alcohol and 1 litre of wine; medicine and perfume or eau de toilette for personal use.\n\nCommunications\n\nThe international direct dialling code for Serbia is +381. WiFi can be found in hotels, restaurants and some cafes; visitors can purchase local prepaid SIM cards for unlocked phones.\n\nPassport & Visa\n\nAll visitors require a valid passport. Visitors may be requested to show a return or onward ticket, documents for the next destination and sufficient funds to finance their stay. Entry to Serbia via Pristina Airport, Kosovo, may carry a different set of requirements, which visitors to Kosovo must check before travelling. It is highly recommended that travellers' passports have at least six months' validity remaining after the intended date of departure from their travel destination. Immigration officials often apply different rules to those stated by travel agents and official sources.\n\nEntry requirements\n\nUS passports must be valid on arrival. No visa required for a stay of up to 90 days within a six month period.\n\nUK passports must be valid for 90 after departure. No visa required for a stay of up to 90 days within a six month period.

The visa must be valid for the period of intended stay.\n\nIrish passports must be valid on arrival. No visa required for a maximum stay of up to 90 days within a six month period.
