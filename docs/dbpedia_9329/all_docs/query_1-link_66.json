        "text": "Serbia’s second city, Novi Sad, is renowned for being the liberal city of music, art and fun. Set on an idyllic stretch of the Danube River, Novi Sad locals enjoy the rapturous reputation of living within Serbia’s cultural heart.\n\nIt is an open and tolerant city with friendly people who are proud of their cultural diversity. Little wonder then, the European Union named Novi Sad the European Capital of Culture of 2022. If that’s not enough, here are 10 reasons Novi Sad is worth a visit.\n\n1. It has a laid back, inclusive vibe\n\nNovi Sad is the capital of one of Serbia’s most ethnically diverse regions, which has been home to groups such as Hungarians, Croats, Slovaks, and Romanians over the centuries. Experts believe the city was first established by Serbs who were denied the freedom to practice their Orthodox faith. Today it has six official languages and is home to a medley of places of worship – a neo-gothic Catholic church standing proud in the main square, a pink-hued Orthodox Bishop’s palace, and the majestic Synagogue of Novi Sad.\n\n2. It’s easy to explore\n\nThanks to the city’s flat terrain, the bike-friendly attitudes of locals and extensive cycle paths, Novi Sad is a great place to see by bicycle, with reasonable hire rates and lots of pick-up and drop-off points. It’s also very walkable. Tour guides offer free 90-minute tours, leaving from in front of the Serbian National Theatre, twice a day. For those looking for a touch of adventure, it’s possible to rent a kayak or canoe and see the sights from the water.\n\n3. It has a thriving urban art scene\n\nNovi Sad takes its street art seriously. Drab building facades have been turned into a colourful display of large-scale murals and awe-inspiring street art that mixes photo-realism with illustration. You can find the best street art outside Kombinat and hidden in the alleyways along Dunavska Street. Be sure to check out the huge portrait of a girl wearing cat ears and holding a cat puppet by renown Serbian Street artist Artez. The work is named after a famous Serbian saying, “when the cat’s away, the mice will play”.\n\n4. You can head to the beach\n\nWhen the weather’s nice, the locals head to the Štrand, a 700-metre-long beach alongside the Danube, to swim, sunbathe, and build sandcastles. At low tide, it’s possible to walk over to Fisherman’s Island and find a secret spot for a picnic or enjoy a late-night drink at one of the floating bars. Alternatively, stop for a spot of people watching at one of the Štrand’s beachside bars and cafes, with live music providing the backdrop to an evening sitting on the sand as the sun goes down.\n\n5. Nature is on your doorstep\n\nThe rolling hills of Fruška Gora National Park is a short drive or bike ride away, with lots of hiking and cycling trails to explore, as well as several lakes that are popular swimming and fishing spots. This is wine country, so make time to stop at the vineyards with ‘vinski podrum’ (wine cellar) on the door to try some of the local varieties. Bermet, a dessert wine, from this region is supposed to have been served on the Titanic.\n\n6. There’s plenty of inspiration for cultural and art aficionados\n\nPreparations for 2022 have added even more venues to the city, including the Cultural Station Eđšeg, which hosts theatre, exhibitions and literary events inside a former belle-époque shooting club. There’s also recent the reconstruction of an old industrial silk-dyeing factory, now known as the Svilara Cultural Station. The old factory and the distinctive chimney serve as a reminder of the economic and social development of the time. Today the Svilara Cultural Station is filled with contemporary art on ongoing cultural events.\n\n8. The shopping\n\nGet an authentic Serbian experience by bargain hunting at the city’s markets. Locals stock up on cheap seasonal fruit and veg at Riblja, Pijaca and Futoška Pijaca. The fish market, Trg Republike, is also worth a visit. If you’re looking for some unique souvenirs, The Manual Company, which dates back to 1985, is well known for its leatherwork. When you’re ready for a break, head to Trčika, a cafe housed in a former city tramway car, for a coffee and side of Serbian pancakes (palačinka).\n\n9. History-buffs will be spoilt for choice\n\nThe Museum of Vojvodina has an estimated 400,000 artefacts, covering 70,000 years of life in this area dating back to the Stone Age – of particular pride is several Roman helmets, found just outside the nearby town of Šid. Visitors shouldn’t miss stopping by the Petrovaradin Fortress, which took 88 years to build in the eighteenth century and to explore its impressive 16km network of tunnels."
