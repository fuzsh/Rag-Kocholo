        "text": "Raised and thus secured against floods, Zemun’s exceptionally accessible natural position on the right bank of the Danube attracted dwelling settlements.\n\nTraces of the oldest settlement in Zemun were found at Gardoš, the site of today's cemetery. This settlement originates from the early Neolith times, the time of its oldest culture in the Danube region. Zemun was a separate town that was incorporated into Belgrade in 1934. The development of New Belgrade in the second half of the 20th century affected the expansion of the continuous urban area.\n\nOpera and Theatre Madlenianum is the first private opera and theatre in this part of Europe. Before the reconstruction, it used to be the Zemun theatre. It is located in the very heart of the Zemun’s city center.\n\nA few small squares make the old core of Zemun: Magistratski, Senjski, Veliki, Branka Radičevića, Karađorđev, and Masarikov, where during the day the open-air green market is located. On the promenade Zemunski Kej, along the Danube river, there are many restaurants, an amusement park, entertainment facilities and the formerly largest hotel Jugoslavija.\n\nMany cultural events are appropriately organized within the historical sites and venues, such as the Millenium Tower on the top of the Gardoš Hill, and Zemunski Park, where the Roman sarcophagus is placed in the vicinity of an avenue containing 150 years old trees. During the summer season most visited events are Leto na Gardošu, Leto na Keju, Leto na Lidu, as well as Zemun’s International Salon of Caricature, International festival of monodrama and Pantomime, and the Day of Tesla.\n\nPublic transportation:\n\nBuses: 84, 15, 17, 45, 73, 81, 81L, 82, 83, 85, 703, 704, 706, 706е, 707, 610, 611"
