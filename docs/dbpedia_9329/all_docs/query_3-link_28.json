It was earlier known as “Taurunum” by the Celtics and “Mallevila” by the Crusaders in the 9th Century and has been an important city throughout its past. It was established on three hills on the banks of the River Danube. It has many historical squares and ruined castles that speak of the bygone era. Most of these historical landmarks are located in the Old Town part of the municipality.",
