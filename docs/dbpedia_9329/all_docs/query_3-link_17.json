        "text": "Although the Zemun town makes a part of today's Belgrade city, it has always had something that distinguished it, from the city on the other side of the Sava River.\n\nFrom a historical point of view, Zemun used to be a border town between two Empires: Austrian and Ottoman. It isn't surprising that Zemun has that old-town charm, rich local history, and some astonishing historical facts in the town area.\n\nI have always been fascinated by Zemun. Trust me, there is no place like this town. When, in 1976, I got married, I settled in Zemun. It is a town I fell in love with at first sight. It remains an indelible part of my life.\n\nIt may seem strange to you if I start from Zemun's geographical location. It's about 20 minutes by car from the Belgrade city center.\n\nAnother great advantage of the position of Zemun is that it lies on the banks of the beautiful Danube. Located at the right bank of the mighty Danube river, Zemun has a kind of Mediterranean feeling.\n\nOnce you see it for the very first time, you will understand what I am talking about. Zemun has (Zemunski Kej), is a huge promenade that goes along the coast of the Danube in Zemun and it is undeniably considered one of the most beautiful and most astonishing oases in Belgrade city.\n\nDuring the hot Belgrade summers, I have some good news for you. The nearness of the river makes the temperatures much more tolerable as the wonderful breeze brings a little relief.\n\nOn the other hand, if you would like to escape from the Belgrade heat and feel less urban, then Zemun Lido beach is the perfect spot for you.\n\nThe only problem with this beach is that during the periods of great floods, remains completely flooded. Still, if you like to feel the intact natural beauty, this is the right spot for you.\n\nZemun Quay is a huge promenade that goes along the coast of the Danube in Zemun and it is unquestionably considered one of the most beautiful and most astonishing oases in Belgrade.\n\nIf you are looking for a place for a long walk or a bike ride, then your search is over. Zemun Quay offers the most amazing hiking and biking trails and routes.\n\nZemun Quay is also the harbor for many ships using the river, which creates the most beautiful sight and makes it one of the most picturesque palaces in Belgrade.\n\nGardos Tower is a memorial tower located in the heart of Zemun Town. It was built in 1986, and it’s a real example of Gothic art.\n\nThis is truly a historical and visual symbol of Zemun. Don't miss climbing to the top of the tower from where takes breathtaking views of the Danube and almost all of Belgrade!\n\nIf you love original and real-magic places, with good vibes, you must visit Cafeteria Gardos. Are you looking for a great place to rest from your walking or bike tour in Zemun Town?\n\nThis cafeteria will welcome you for a quick tea, coffee, and some yummy food bites. This place is easy to find. It's located at the end of Zemun Quay, not far from Gardos tower.\n\nMany of you will say why this cemetery is interesting to visit. I must say that I know some tourists that spent more than one hour at this cemetery!\n\nZemun cemetery, however, keeps the memory of the people who helped to build it. The cemetery grounds house the remains of people of all faiths and religions.\n\nThere you'll find Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish, cemeteries. Zemun Cemetery is a fantastic place for history and architecture buffs and helps us remember all those who shaped this city before us. Read all about this cemetery!\n\nFrom the above picture, you may be disappointed, but today, this house is completely abandoned, and it’s under the city’s protection. It was originally a ‘kafana', or a type of community bistro.\n\nAs soon as you step from the wide boulevards of New Belgrade into the narrow streets of Zemun Town and head toward the center of the town, you will come across the famous Zemun Park.\n\nAt nearly eight hectares proudly boasts one of the top high schools in the country, primary school, college, military barracks, two churches. It's a great place to relax and find silence from the city’s rush.\n\nThe Karamata family house is one of the most important cultural monuments in Zemun Town. The home is located on the same name street at Karamatina 17.\n\nThe house consists of three parts: ground floor, one story with a simple roof, and one story with a basement and attic roof. All three parts are connected by a unique facade and have a common main entrance.\n\nIn the house of the Karamata family, during the Austro-Turkish War, in 1788, Emperor Joseph II stayed with his staff. In addition to other celebrities, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić also stayed there.\n\nIf you don't visit Zemun Greenmarket (Zemunska Pjaca), then your impression of Zemun is not complete. It is the best place to get to know the atmosphere of a city."
