        "text": "INSTITUTIONS\n\nTHE J. PAUL GETTY MUSEUM, SCULPTURE AND DECORATIVE ARTS DEPARTMENT, in LOS ANGELES,\n\ngranted me a three months fellowship in 2011. I wish to thank Dr. Antonia Boström, Senior Curator for Sculpture and Decorative Arts, for inviting me and making this fruitful stay possible, Anne-Lise Desmas, Associate Curator of Sculpture and Decorative Arts, for her daily help, before, during and after my stay, Ellen South and Elizabeth Buhe, and Jennifer Lieu.\n\nAt the Getty Research Institute, Thomas Gaehtgens, Director, A. Alexa Sekyra, Head, Scholars Program, the always helpful staff of the Institute, Daniela Ferrari, Rachel Longaker, Sabine Schlosser, Rebecca Zamora, and the Interlibrary Loan Office, made this stay an invaluable step in my research.I also thank Murtha Baca, Head, Digital Art History Access, Jane Bassett, Conservator, Rebecca Peabody, Manager of Research Projects and Programs, Brenda Podemski, Principal Project Specialist in Collection Information & Access.\n\nI dedicated my fellowship to working with the wonderfully comprehensive files assembled in 1975/1976 by former curator Peter Fusco when he made a survey of nineteenth-century sculpture in American collections. This survey was the basis for the pioneering show The Romantics to Rodin: French Nineteenth Century Sculpture from North American Collections, 1980-1981, co-organized by Peter Fusco and Horst W. Janson, and which toured the country with four venues (Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Detroit, Indianapolis).\n\nTHE SAMUEL H. KRESS FOUNDATION, NEW YORK, has granted financial support for research-related travel and intern housing (2018-2019). Traveling within the US and to France to conduct research will thus be facilitated. Having direct access to object files in American museums and to artists files at the Archives in the Musée du Louvre and Musée d'Orsay, Paris, will give in depth information. And the housing funding is highly appreciated by the 2018 intern from the Ecole du Louvre and the 2019 interns from Paris 1-Sorbonne and Ecole du Louvre. We are all very grateful for this generous help.\n\nTHE RICHARD LOUNSBERY FOUNDATION, WASHINGTON, D.C., has granted generous financial support for a reshaping of the website and for the director's salary (2019-2020). Thanks to these funds we wish to make the research tool on the website more efficient and to offer a layout which would entice interaction, especially with a non-specialized audience. I conceived the French Sculpture Census as a tool for sharing knowledge and as a place where one could learn to love French sculpture. I am very grateful to the Richard Lounsbery Foundation for giving me the means to reach these goals.\n\nFRENCH HERITAGE SOCIETY, PARIS, generously supports two or three students from the cultural heritage and archives master's program at the Ecole du Louvre. The students come to the US and conduct research related to the French Sculpture Census. Their stay is also an opportunity to discover American culture and the American way of life. It is often a transformative experience. I am happy to thank Diane de Roquette-Buisson and Amy Fienga, Co-Chairmen of FHS Student Exchange Program, for their continuous commitment to this program, as well as Caroline Giboulet, Senior Development Officer (until 2016) and Samantha Kohli-Brisolier, Student Exchange Program Administrator.\n\nTHE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE MUSÉE RODIN (SOCIÉTÉ DES AMIS DU MUSÉE RODIN), PARIS, has granted a fellowship to a student with the following mission:Study Rodin's works in the French Sculpture Census:\n\n- uniformize titles according to the reference publications from the Musée Rodin, Paris;\n\n- include in the Bibliography of each bronze the reference to the English and French versions of The Bronzes of Rodin (Antoinette Le Normand-Romain, Paris, RMN/Musée Rodin, 2007);\n\n- add information found in the archives at the Musée Rodin.\n\nThis work on Rodin's pieces, representing 10% of the total number of French sculptures in American public collections, will provide a far better understanding of them. It will also be an opportunity for American museums and the Musée Rodin, Paris, to exchange information.\n\nI am happy to thank here M. Edwart Vignot, President of the Société des Amis du Musée Rodin, for its generous contribution, and Mme Antoinette Le Normand-Romain, who accepted to supervise this mission.\n\nINDIVIDUALS\n\nI am happy to warmly thank those individuals who have financially supported the French Sculpture Census:\n\n- Ernst Family (Dallas)\n\n- anonymous donors (New York City)"
