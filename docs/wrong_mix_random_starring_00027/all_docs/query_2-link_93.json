        "meta_description": "The St. John's College Digital Archives features items from both the Greenfield Library in Annapolis, MD and the Meem Library in Santa Fe, NM.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe college was founded in Annapolis, Maryland in 1696 as King William's School and chartered in 1784 as St. John's College. In 1937 it adopted a unified curriculum based on the study of great works in the humanities and sciences and premised on the belief that inquiry and discussion are at the heart of learning. A second campus dedicated to the same educational vision was opened in 1964 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1967 the Santa Fe campus added the college’s first graduate program: St. John’s Graduate Institute in Liberal Education now offers a Master of Arts in Liberal Arts on both campuses. Since 1992 the Graduate Institute in Santa Fe has also offered a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics.",
