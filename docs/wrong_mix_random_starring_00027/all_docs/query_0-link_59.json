        "text": "b. Los Angeles, CA 1949\n\nJohn Divola received a B.A. from California State University, Northridge in 1971 and completed his M.F.A. from University of California, Los Angeles in 1974. Divolaâ€™s career spans four decades, focusing on the conceptions and limitations of photography. Although the photographer has a fascination with physical objects that range from buildings to landscapes, his concerns are purely conceptual as they challenge the boundaries between fiction and reality, the abstract and the specific.\n\nIn his Vandalism (1973-75) series, Divola comments on the role of the photographer as synonymous to the graffiti artist, making his own marks and emulsions in an abandoned building. His fascination with inhabitable houses led him to Zuma (1997), a body of work that documents the man-made interiors of buildings that are corroded and vandalized in contrast to the exterior of sunsets and shorelines. The physical relationship between man-made interventions and its immediate surroundings emphasize the distance between image and reality.\n\nPhotographing manipulated and inhabitable environments and applying his own interventions, Divola explores the relation between real and artificial representations of the image. For Divola, photography functions as a transcendental medium, accommodating performance and manipulation of perception.\n\nEducation\n\nTeaching\n\nSelected Solo Exhibitions\n\nSelected Group Exhibitions\n\nSelected Public Collections\n\nAwards and Honors"
