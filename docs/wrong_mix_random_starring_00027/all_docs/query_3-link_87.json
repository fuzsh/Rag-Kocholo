He was commissioned in 2019 by the Museum of Latin American Art to create the public sculpture “Long Beach High Five” at Robert E. Gumbiner Park in Long Beach. Jorge Mujica explores the fragility of an unbroken line and the context created within the boundaries of a positive and negative space. His designs are rendered through rehearsed drawing exercises examining a combination of automatic movements and choreographed mapping of space to animate flat materials into free-standing painting surfaces. Mujica’s academic background allows him to understand the conventions of contemporary artwork by addressing the flat surface as an illusionistic portal and simultaneously, embracing the independence of the object as a sculpture in physical space to manifest panoramic ruptures. Grazing (Spring), 2022 Oil and spray paint on 1/4” plywood 35 x 28 x 32 inches – 36 – From the series Atonal Chromatics: Inside an Elephant’s Brain, 2020 Acrylic on canvas 12 x 12 inches HAGOP NAJARIAN (Generation X) Hagop Najarian was born in Beirut, Lebanon. Najarian and his family immigrated to the United States in 1969. Najarian received his BFA in drawing and painting from Cal State University Long Beach. At the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, he earned a MFA in painting through the study abroad program in Rome and Philadelphia. Najarian is a Professor of Art, teaching drawing and painting at Cerritos College since 1999. In addition to exhibiting his work locally and nationally, he is a co-founding member of the artists collective Museum Adjacent and a member of locally run collectives Durden and Ray, and High Beams. “The work seeks to communicate visually what I experience when hearing and playing music, my musical and visual DNA. Using visual elements like composition, line, shape, speed, texture, light and color, as a reaction to the musical structures of rhythm, volume, mass, atonality and harmonics. Atonal Chromatics is a series of paintings that investigate the compositional and structural elements of atonal harmonics in music and translates those effects to drawing and painting. The paintings are a synthesis of varying musical genres like Jazz, Classical, Punk and Reggae interacting on a single surface. They are a visual response to an audible force. From the series Love Stories, Short Stories, a Series of Fast Paced Action Paintings: Off-Hand Remark, 1981 Oil on panel 18 x 24 inches MARGARET NIELSEN (The Boomers) Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Margaret Nielsen attended Chouinard Art School, received a BFA from California Institute of the Arts, and MA in clinical art therapy from Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles. She has exhibited her paintings extensively, both nationally and internationally, as well as produced numerous public art projects. Nielsen travels through her work and her own psyche, portraying aspects of life with a universal commonality and delving into the mystery of the human condition. Through the use of recurring imagery such as birds, the four elements, and other natural motifs, Nielsen connects the private, intangible world with the external, physical world. Her paintings, often small, jewel-like, and intimate, evoke Jung’s notion of the collective unconscious in that they touch upon experiences common to us all in the journey through life. – 38 – CLAUDIA PARDUCCI (The Boomers) Claudia Parducci received her MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 2006. Her work has since been exhibited in the US and internationally. She is currently represented by Ochi Projects, Los Angeles, and recently showed with Galerie Thomas Zander in Cologne, Germany and at California Museum of Art, Thousand Oaks. Claudia Parducci’s practice stems from her interest in histories of destruction and rebuilding. Her recent work suggests survival strategies as well as the creative labor associated with reconstruction. Drawing is a fundamental part of her practice, and the line is a repeating motif, whether in two-dimensional graphite or three-dimensional twine or rope. The repetition of lines and structures arises from a process of interrogation of material and historical tensions. Her works visualize the capacity to hold conflicting ideas at the same time, such as the idea that a structure can be rising or falling, a material can appear supple and rigid, idea and object. Infinite Impossibilities, 2019 Cast bronze, wood and acrylic 93 x 29 x 19 inches ALICIA PILLER (The Millenials) Alicia Piller is a Los Angeles based artist born and raised in Chicago and received her Bachelors in both Fine Arts (Painting) and Anthropology from Rutgers University in 2004. While working in the fashion industry; living a decade in NYC and three and a half years in Santa Fe, NM, Piller cultivated her distinctive sculptural voice. Continuing to expand her artistic practice, Piller completed her MFA focused on sculpture and installation from Cal Arts in May of 2019. Piller’s work is a part of the Hammer’s permanent collection, Glendale College Collection, Forrest Kirk Collection, the Pam Royalle Collection and Janine Barrois Collection. Her sculptural work was featured on the cover of Full Blede Magazine, Issue 10 (Fall 2019) and drawings of sculptural work in the Lumina Journal (Sarah Lawrence College, Jan 2020.) “As a method to locate the root of human histories, I merge the new and discarded, working at a micro/macro level, experimenting with a wide range of materials to construct large scale works that mimic forms of cellular biology. Attempting to reconcile questions about the current state of our times, I envision historical traumas, both political and environmental, through the lens of a microscope; my mixed media practice is as much about materiality as it is about content. Each work becomes a biological unfolding of time, examining the energy around wounds societies have inflicted upon themselves and others.” Untitled, 2020 Latex balloons, resin, giclée prints, gel medium, dried banana fruit, palm roots, clock spring, shell, coral and metal 37 x 24 x 7 inches – 40 – Crush, Crushing, Crushed, 2020 Acrylic on canvas 72 x 72 inches REBECCA RICH (Generation X) Rebecca Rich was born in New York and received a BA from Occidental College and MFA from Claremont Graduate University. She lives and works in Los Angeles. “Painting is a place where I explore the duality of the self and the unknown as it relates to the concept of the perpetual present. My work begins with marks and accumulated layers that create thresholds, transitions, and intentional movements. They reach towards form but never come into complete being. The continuous space pushes outward to the edge and back in, yet the center never truly becomes a center. The tension between the textural surface and the underlying composition marks a knowable space but presents the world as elusive and changing, indeterminate and unstable. This simultaneity, the feeling of ungroundedness or lack of resolution, is an invitation to accept a center that is inherently off balance, but within an energy that is contained. My work reflects on the passage of time, and the unfolding of understanding and knowing. The accumulation shows traces of concurrent narratives, yet the work doesn’t resolve itself and won’t sit still. Through color, I challenge the notion of hierarchy, objectivity, and the rules governing its use. I use color and its absence to create transitions—places to rest and reflect, and then continue seeking. Permanent resting spaces are actively revealed through sequences and forms that come together, splinter or oppose each other. The work creates a state of flux, a sense of moving forward in time, in motion, but perfectly still.” JOHN ROBERTSON (The Boomers) John Robertson has broad experience producing an extensive range of artworks for the discriminating collector and for residential and commercial projects including work for major sport stadiums and arenas: MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL. “Robertson lives in a hilltop house trailer overlooking the ocean. He’s a slight man with a graying beard and the kind of enthusiastic attitude that glows in the dark; a guy doing exactly what he should be doing. Robertson paints. Not with fancy oils and acrylics on textured canvas but with house paint on those rolls of canvas you put on the floor when you’re redoing the ceiling. It was a question of economics at first. Drop cloths and cans of paint are a lot cheaper than the stuff you buy in art stores. Later it became a choice. He began painting about a dozen years ago in all kinds of styles and sizes, but what he’s become known for are the faces of musicians and writers he puts on 4-1/2-by-6 foot canvases in a techniques vaguely reminiscent of Jackson Pollock’s. Faces glow through streaks and lines of color. Mine is one of them.” —Al Martinez, L.A. Times, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Falling Man, 2011 Oil on treated, unstretched canvas 88 x 47 inches – 42 – metal mettle metal mettle, 2020 Acrylic with paper collage on panel 60 x 72 inches Courtesy of Vielmetter Los Angeles Photo: Robert Wedemeyer STEVE RODEN (Generation X) Steve Roden received his BFA from Otis Parsons College of Art and Design in 1986, and his MFA from ArtCenter College of Design in 1989. He was awarded a Durfee Foundation Grant in 2001, a California Arts Council Grant in Visual Arts in 2003, and a California Community Foundation/Getty Foundation mid-career artist fellowship grant in 2008. With the support of his Grants to Artists grant, Roden completed seven large paintings and a film in his stone’s throw series in 2010–11. Roden has exhibited his visual works in solo and group exhibitions nationally and internationally at The Kitchen; MOCA San Diego; The Hammer Museum; Mercosur Biennial, Brazil; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; and the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens. Over the past fifteen years, he has taught both graduate and undergraduate courses at numerous Southern California institutions and has lectured, and been a visiting artist at numerous universities across the U.S. Roden’s work, metal mettle metal mettle, is a new diptych in which he incorporates collage elements into his abstract painterly gestures that in the past have usually been connected to language or sound based systems. The impetus for this new work came from Roden’s experience during the initial stay-athome order. He began to create small collages and mailed them to friends to connect and to see how they were doing. This work is a larger composition that resulted from these small gestures Entretien Entre Le Ciel Et la Terre (Dialogue Between Heavens and Earth) Mixed media on canvas 54 x 93 inches ALAIN ROGIER (The Boomers) Alain Rogier obtained his BA in political and social theory from UC Berkeley. He attended Loyola Law School before joining the Los Angeles, City Attorney’s Office as a prosecutor. He established his private practice in Brentwood specializing in high conflict child custody cases. His art studies have taken him to the American College in Paris, and Otis College of Art and Design. He studied at Otis with Alexis Smith and Bonita Helmer and has exhibited extensively in Japan, had two separate shows in Paris, and participated in a two-person exhibition in Krakow, Poland. He has exhibited with Los Angeles Art Core in numerous galleries, museums in Japan and Los Angeles and, separately, at selectively judged exhibition at Site: Brooklyn in Brooklyn, New York as well as in Massachusetts. “Over time, we build layers of experience, knowledge, and insight into the human condition and ourselves. For me, there is an ongoing dialogue between such layers – and the thoughts and sentiments they generate – that is both an intellectual and aesthetic conversation. I confront this in my art, unveiling various levels of conflict. I don’t pretend to have answers. I do seek different resolutions to the same questions: how do we maintain a critical dialogue regarding the human condition? How do we celebrate the best of humanity, nature, and life? What is the role of color? What is the role of black and white? Can abstraction cause us to reflect, ponder, and respond to the chaos, and to the beauty that still survives – even if it is harder to find?” – 44 – Memories 112, 2020 Oil, acrylic, watercolour, pencil, caulk, on watercolor paper on linen canvas 43.5 x 49 inches SHARON RYAN (The Boomers) Sharon Ryan is a painter of Irish decent based in Los Angeles. Ryan received her BFA in 1987 from Cal State, Fullerton. She’s had solo exhibitions at Kim Light Gallery, Los Angeles; Light Box Gallery, Los Angeles; Sandroni Rey Gallery, Los Angeles; Peter Blake Gallery, Orange County; Gallery S, Seoul, Korea; Meyerson Nowinski Gallery, Seattle, WA; and group exhibitions at Hosfelt Gallery, San Francisco; Hohenthal und Bergen, Berlin; Neuhoff Gallery, NY, Barbara Davis Gallery, Houston; San Jose Museum of Art; L.A. Louver Gallery, Venice; Post Gallery, Los Angeles; Lemon Sky Projects, Los Angeles; Davis/Keil Gallery, Naples, FL. Ryan shows us a visual symphony of the unseen, the inside out, and the parts that go unrecognized. She is painting shapes, marks, textures and colors of sounds, memories, and silence. “With this body of work I wanted to take the time to be mindful of the tiniest fragments in my environment/surroundings…and paint them…a sound, a cricket, a leaf, a tea cup, a shadow, a bolt, a stone, a breeze. Our brain will feed us visions, feelings and emotions that keeps us humans going…I started to think about how memory and sound are essential to how we humans relate to our histories. Celebratory moments, acts of love, golden moments, love letters/songs…the language and vocabulary of all the shapes and forms are familiar but yet unfamiliar. I am painting what my memory leaves with me.” From the series Inner Light: Metaphysical Life and Love 002, 2021 Ink on paper 23 x 19 inches HIDEO SAKATA (The Silent Generation) “Art can bridge the cultural gap and bring people together under a shared humanity.” Hideo Sakata was born in Nagasaki, Japan in 1935 and received a BFA from the Nagasaki University and the University of Mexico. He came to Los Angeles in 1970 and in 1991 established Lantern of the East, Los Angeles (LELA.) Sakata’s emotional and spiritual influences are deeply rooted in his childhood experience of the atomic bomb explosion in Nagasaki. “No one survives a holocaust unscathed. Even if the body comes through without a scratch, mind and spirit are forever changed — The explosion recurs in his art as a warning and as a celebration; and human frailty and the finality of death – the grave profundities you would expect such a momentous event to aver so indisputably – are at once reaffirmed and subverted by the compositional formats and elements in which Sakata contextualizes that blast.” — Peter Frank, Los Angeles art writer and critic – 46 – CHRISTIAN SAMPSON (Generation X) Christian Sampson was born in 1974 in Bradenton, FL. Sampson received his BFA from Ringling College in Sarasota, FL, and his MFA from Hunter College in New York. His work has been shown at galleries and museums nationally and internationally, including the Centre-Pompidou, Paris and The Sarasota Museum of Art at Ringling College. He lives and works in Los Angeles. Sampson’s artwork explores ideas about light, color and perception. Hovering between painting and sculpture, his works vacillate within dimensional boundaries. Through the physical real, illusionistic LED projection, and the related double, he creates playful, layered installations of color, light, and form. Most often his works are created site-specifically in response to the architectural space – from museum halls, to domestic living spaces, to pop-up performance stages. While his installations align themselves with the minimal language of the Light & Space Movement artists of the 1960s and can be linked to early cinematic animation and handmade filmmaking experiments, his knowledge and use of contemporary technologies strongly positions his work in the present and future.
