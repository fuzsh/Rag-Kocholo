Born in Glendale, California, Saxe studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles from 1965 to 1969 and earned a B.F.A. degree at California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, in 1974. Saxe's vessels are nonfunctional. Often adorned with small sculptural appendages, they have classical shapes and traditional glazes.\n\nSaxe is a professor of design at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he has taught for almost twenty-five years. Saxe has received many honors and fellowships, including a six-month residency at the experimental atelier of the Manufacture National de Severes in France.\n\nSource: Kenneth R.
