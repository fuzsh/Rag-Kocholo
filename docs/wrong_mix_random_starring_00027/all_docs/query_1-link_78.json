        "text": "A diary of my experience during Metallica’s M72 World Tour stop at State Farm Stadium in Arizona over Labor Day weekend in 2023\n\nAugust 30, 2023\n\nOur flight was preparing to depart Newark Liberty Airport at about 7 AM and although I knew the answer I had to ask, “Who’s idea was it to fly this early?” Susan’s quick response was “It was your idea.” She was right. It was a busy summer with all the Metallica related travel, and we only had so many off days to spare, so I wanted to maximize our time in Arizona by leaving early in the day. Luckily for us, the flight was abnormally on time, and we landed at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix without issue.\n\nWe grabbed our rental car and headed due north to our first destination in Sedona. The first thing you notice about Arizona is the natural beauty of the landscape. The scenery changes every few miles as you drive through the desert, revealing sprawling mountains and varying vegetation. None of it was as stunning as when we approached the red rock buttes of Sedona. We pulled into town and stopped for brunch at Creekside.\n\nAfter checking into the hotel, we headed to Red Rock Western Jeep tours for a tour than I had booked in Newark Airport that morning before we left. I did not want to lock into a tour before we knew our flight would be on time, so I did not research it much. I settled on “Earth Wisdom Tour”. I would soon regret that decision.\n\nThe tour had some cool scenery which is what I wanted out of it. But the driver was some hippie from Hawaii who relocated to Sedona who believed in all the local folklore nonsense. Instead of talking about the natural land formations, he wouldn’t shut up about vortex energy, quantum entanglements, inflows, outflows, drum clearings, meditation, and a bunch of Sedona claptrap. The mountain views were nice, but next time I’m doing a regular Pink Jeep tour.\n\nSedona looked like a daytime only town. We were barely able to find a restaurant open after dusk but were able to get someone to seat us for dinner. We called it a night after dinner, primarily because there was no place left open when we were done.\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nI was excited to get out of bed today. We went to breakfast at the Coffee Pot, famous for having 101 omelets on the menu. They had a cool outdoor patio, and it was hard to nail down exactly what to order.\n\nWe finished up breakfast and headed straight for EagleRider Sedona to pick up our Harley rental. The plan was to pick up a bike for 24 hours and ride it to The Grand Canyon and back. The weather forecast was a bit sketchy but I figured it was a desert so there was no way it would rain so it made sense just to go. Susan followed me in the car on the way to Flagstaff. She parked at Target and hopped on the bike for the trek to the Grand Canyon.\n\nIt looked like there were only two routes to get there, US 180 to AZ 64, or US 89 to AZ 64. I wanted to see them both so plotted a round trip course that started with the US 180 route and would take us back on US 89.\n\nAs we expected the scenery was stunning for the entire trip. What we didn’t expect was that yet again, the desert scenery changed so much every few miles. There was always something different to look at. The route was devoid of civilization except for an odd gas station until we got closer to Grand Canyon National Park.\n\nI stopped to pay the fee at the main gate and followed the signs to the nearest parking lot along the south rim of the canyon. This was Susan’s first trip to the canyon, and my second. But I think we were equally stunned by the view as we approached it. None of my pictures can do it justice and it is hard to put into words how vast and majestic it looks.\n\nWe got back on the bike and rode around the park to see some of the other vantage points on the south rim. We walked down part of the trail to the bottom of the canyon to take some pictures.\n\nI stopped to look at the weather forecast and the radar map on my phone and things were starting to look a bit icky. I thought it was not supposed to rain in the desert! Undetered, we headed east along AZ 64. We stopped at a few more points of interest along the south rim to keep taking pictures. It seemed like the canyon would stretch east forever.\n\nAs we made our way towards US 89, we could start to see columns of rain off in the distance, along with ominous lightning strikes. I thought that if we could make it to US 89 and head south that maybe we could dodge the storm. That plan failed when rain drops started falling on us.\n\nI ride through rain all the time on the east coast. But the rain in Arizona has a much different characteristic. The locals call those storms monsoons, a term that is not as menacing as it sounds. Visibility was low and the rain made us feel cold, but it was inconsistent and not very heavy. Susan ducked behind me and used me as a windshield, and I used the taillights on the car ahead of me as a guide.\n\nWe stopped at a gas station to take a break from the rain and to wait for it to end. It did not seem like it was going to stop any time soon, but we figured we made it that far and were close enough to the car in Flagstaff to make a break for it. We got back on the bike and just like that, it stopped raining. Had I kept going we would have been fine. We made it back to the car in Flagstaff, Susan got in and followed me back to Sedona.\n\nIt was a whirlwind trip on the rental bike and one of the most unique I have been on. I had never been on a motorcycle in the desert before. Arizona does not have nearly as many roads to bike on than we do on the east coast, but they are amazing to ride on.\n\nWe had one more night in Sedona, so we showered up and hailed an Uber to downtown. There seems to be a major Uber shortage in Sedona. That, coupled with our observation that everything closes at dark made me wonder if something was keeping visitors from coming to town. Either way, the car finally came and we made it to dinner at Elote Café.\n\nSeptember 1, 2023\n\nI woke up excited for the day, we were going to see Metallica at night! We started with another breakfast at the Coffee Pot because their menu was large enough to warrant a second trip. Susan wanted to rent a bicycle and go for a scenic ride in Sedona, so I dropped her off at the shop. I went back to the hotel to work on my blog for an earlier Metallica trip while she went for her ride.\n\nI checked out of the hotel and went to get her when she was done, and we headed straight south to our hotel for the rest of the trip in Scottsdale. We spent most of the afternoon poolside at our hotel. I wanted to conserve energy for the concert. We got dressed up really fancy and drove to State Farm Stadium in Glendale for the show.\n\nWe walked into the stadium and surveyed their dinner options. The best thing I could find was a “sausage” that was more like a hot dog. That was somewhat of a letdown for a new stadium that had just hosted a Super Bowl earlier in the year.\n\nBut I inhaled whatever it was, and we made our way down to the floor to find a good vantage point for the show. We walked down as Pantera was playing and that immediately set my mood. We found a spot outside the donut-shaped stage and about twenty feet from the barrier.\n\nIn a scene almost right out of a classic Beavis and Butthead episode, some shirtless chubby dude was moshing with himself to the music right in front of us. Then he raised his arms, bent over, and puked whatever he had eaten or drank for the last three days. Another sign this was going to be a great night!\n\nThe lights dimmed and AC/DC’s “Long Way to the Top” played. This was about to be my seventh Metallica show for the year and I was just as excited for this one as I was for the first six. The people in our surrounding area were feeding off the energy, too. It was about to get good. Metallica took the stage and tore into “Creeping Death”!\n\nIt was such a hot start to the show that it felt like the crowd was almost overwhelmed with emotion. A father was standing in front of us with his adult son who broke into tears of joy as they hugged. We collectively sang every word of the song.\n\nThe setlist progressed through a familiar mix of new and old songs. For the “deep cut” song they tend to play in the third slot, they returned to “Holier Than Thou” like they did in Paris and in East Rutherford. James, Robert, and Kirk roamed the stage and played to every inch of the stadium. Lars filled the room with his drumbeats. I turned around and saw Robert’s wife Chloe, sitting in the nearest VIP section behind us.\n\nAs Metallica worked their way through the performance, I could tell that Susan was really getting into the concert, more so than at the last four we had been to together. Initially she had some hesitation about seeing Metallica six times in a year (having had seen them a total of zero times in prior years) but the greatest band in the world had won her over. She was calling out songs and correctly predicting when and where Lars’ drumkit was going to move.\n\nThings were going great but towards the show I started to notice something unusual. They played the intro tape to “The Day That Never Comes” but then played “Hardwired” to follow it. I thought I had maybe misplaced the song, or they changed things up. But it was a sign that something was wrong.\n\nThe next song was “Fuel” and it sounded like James’ microphone was cutting out because he was missing parts of the song. I looked over to his part of the stage and saw that he was not singing parts of the song. And when he did sing, his voice was strained. I started to worry that it was giving out.\n\nThey cued “Seek & Destroy” and the beachballs fell from the lighting towers. James again had a hard time finishing the song. And when it was over, the houselights came on and the band started throwing picks to the crowd and taking bows. The show was over, by our count they only played 14 songs out of the usual 16. There was no “Enter Sandman”.\n\nWe were worried about what happened to James as we left. It seemed like it could have been laryngitis or some sort of vocal issue that can understandably happen to the lead singer of a band. But they were supposed to put on another show in two days and if he could not get through this one, what would come of the Sunday show?\n\nWe made it to our rental car in the parking lot and sat there for an hour and a half before we were able to exit. What started off awesome with puking fans and Pantera ended up with a shortened Metallica show and insane traffic. It certainly was not the biggest problem I have ever had, but it was a bummer.\n\nSeptember 2, 2023\n\nAs part of the Metallica takeover of the Phoenix area for the weekend, Robert Trujillo and Blackened American Whiskey master distiller Rob Dietrich were advertised for a bottle signing at Paradise Liquor in Phoenix. I had met Robert Trujillo at a similar signing in New Jersey in 2022 so it was not my top priority to do it again. But much to my surprise, Susan wanted to go. I told her from my experience that if we wanted to ensure ourselves an opportunity to get inside, we would have to get there at least three hours early. She still wanted to go. Metallica really did manage to convert her.\n\nWe grabbed a quick breakfast near our hotel and drove to the liquor store. We arrived about three and a half hours before the event was supposed to begin, and there were maybe 50 people ahead of us on the line, so I figured we were in good shape to get our bottles signed. We lucked out and managed to stand behind a gate that shaded us from the mid-day Arizona sun while we waited. We made some friends on the line while were passing the time.\n\nA shirtless and shoeless man walked across the three-lane street while cars slammed on their breaks to not hit him. He appeared to behave like a fictitious zombie, and I was immediately worried for Robert Trujillo’s safety and well-being. Maybe next time Metallica’s management can put him in a liquor store in a better neighborhood.\n\nThe event started on time, and we got to move inside the store. We each bought a bottle of M72 limited edition Blackened American Whiskey and got on the next line to meet the guests of honor. One by one were told to hand our phones over to someone who would take our pictures while we stood on the “X”.\n\nI briefly told Robert Trujillo that I met him in New Jersey last year. He said he remembered that appearance and wore a t-shirt for a local EMT that someone gave him at that signing on stage this year at one of the MetLife Stadium shows. That was about all the time I got with the two Robert’s. I turned around for my picture and waited on the side for Susan to get her bottle signed and her picture.\n\nThey sent us out the back door and I got to say “I told you so” to Susan. The line to get in was now huge and there was no way all those people were going to get in.\n\nI have family in Arizona and part of the agenda of the weekend was to visit them. I drove to visit my cousin Josh and his family a few towns over. We finished up there and drove back to the hotel. I parked the car and saw a notification on my phone. I read the e-mail and it hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nI got my reason why the show was cut short on Friday. James Hetfield had the COVID-19. Not only was Friday’s show cut short, but Sunday’s show was postponed to the following Saturday, after we were planning to fly home on Tuesday. We were going to miss the second show.\n\nI immediately felt bad for Susan, I know she was really getting into the tour, and we had flown all the way across the country to see them twice. I was bummed as well, but I guess I could not say I was Metallica-deprived for the year; I had seen them seven times. On the bright side, we would not have to suffer through Five Finger Death Punch.\n\nWe got ready for the evening and my cousin Brandon, and his wife Victoria came to get us. We went out for dinner and drinks in Phoenix and in Scottsdale. Phoenix was a bit livelier than I had expected, and Scottsdale looks like it is always fun on a Saturday night.\n\nSeptember 3, 2023\n\nWhelp, we had a lot more time on our hands on Sunday than we had originally planned. There would be no need to get to the stadium early to fight for a spot near the stage, nor would we get stuck in traffic getting out of there after the show.\n\nWe grabbed breakfast and drove to Taliesin West. Taliesin West was a winter camp designed by Frank Lloyd Wright to create a community and a workspace for himself and other architects. We did the self-guided tour through the buildings and grounds.\n\nOne of the more interesting things I saw was a sketch Lloyd made of the Guggenheim in New York. I visited the Guggenheim in 1998 for their Art of the Motorcycle exhibition and it inspired me to go out and get my motorcycle license and first bike.\n\nFrom there we headed into Old Town Scottsdale for lunch and to wander the town. The Old Town area is mostly a tourist trap. We checked out a lot of the stores but did not find much in the way of things to buy other than some souvenirs for friends and family. It was probably the least interesting part of Scottsdale we saw that weekend.\n\nWe went back to the hotel and sat by the pool. I guess that was the next best thing to going to the Stadium early. Anyway, we wrapped that up and headed back into town for dinner at Citizen Public House. The food there was better than the garbage at the stadium on Friday, another silver lining.\n\nAfter dinner, we walked to the Cake Nightclub for some drinks. I was stopped at the door and the bouncer made me turn around and lift the back of my shirt up, he wanted to be sure I was not trying to bring a concealed pistol into the club. Wild west, indeed.\n\nWe hung out there for a while and decided to see hop to the other bars in the area. By the time we went outside, the area had exploded with people moving from club to club. It was quite a scene. I guess it was more crowded than a regular Sunday because it was a holiday weekend. Some of the bars opened to the outside, others had long lines to get in. It looked like a fun neighborhood to party in.\n\nIf you gave me the choice between Metallica and clubbing, I would pick Metallica 10 times out of 10. But I did not have a choice, so we made the most of the night. It was a fun time and at the very least I knew the lay of the land for any return trips.\n\nSeptember 4, 2023\n\nWhat to do on the last full day in the Phoenix suburbs? How about off-roading? We got up and drove north to Arizona Outdoor Fun Adventures & Tours. We made an online reservation prior to departure for two ATVs on a guided tour. When we signed in, the staff strongly recommended that we switch to a two-person UTV instead due to the relative difficulty of the trail and our inexperience. We agreed that if they were going to suggest we make a change so emphatically that did not cost us any extra money that we should probably take their advice.\n\nWe boarded the UTV and I took the wheel. Our tour guide made it easy for me to understand how to operate it and how to follow along. He took off and we fell in line behind him and some of the other vehicles.\n\nThe trail was wild up and down the mountain range. It was rocky and vertical and most of it was on the side of a very steep cliff. One wrong move and we were going straight down!\n\nWe stopped along the way to check out the scenery and listen to our tour guide explain the desert vegetation. He was a self-described desert geek and was very enthusiastic about the topic. He was way better than the Sedona “positive energy” mumbo jumbo-spewing tour guide from the previous week.\n\nAfter several stops and starts, the tour headed us back to the parking lot. It was an exhilarating finish to the tour and we both really enjoyed it. It was my first time driving a UTV and it was a lot of fun to operate. Covered in dust, we got in the car and headed for lunch.\n\nOur final tourist stop was at the Arizona Boardwalk in Scottsdale. The Arizona Boardwalk is a complex that has attractions like the ones you would find on a Jersey Shore boardwalk. It is just nowhere near an ocean.\n\nWe were there to visit the OdySea Aquarium. It is a smaller-sized aquarium than some of the others I have been to, but it had all the standard stuff. Lots of tanks and fish.\n\nOur final meal in Arizona was at Oregano’s in Scottsdale. Oregano’s is a laughable attempt at an Italian restaurant, but it was good for what we needed. I had invited out all my Arizona cousins, their significant others, their kids, and my aunt out to dinner. It was good to be able to get everyone in the same place at the same time while I was there.\n\nThat was a wrap for the Arizona leg of my M72 World Tour itinerary. We had an uneventful flight home the next morning and settled back into our normal post-Labor Day Weekend activities.\n\nWrap\n\nArizona worked out well as a destination. I had been there before, but never on a proper vacation. Much like Paris, I got to combine a motorcycle trip with a host of touristy activities. The natural beauty of Arizona was what stood out to me most.\n\nOf course, it was not a perfect trip. It rained on my motorcycle ride. Metallica cut one show short and postponed the other one to a date that I could not attend because of COVID. When you plan a vacation, everything is going to be perfect in your mind, but you must roll with what happens if things do not go to plan.\n\nI had a fantastic time with my Metallica itinerary in 2023. I got to visit Paris, Montreal, and Arizona and see them in all three cities. I also got to see them in my home stadium with a large group of friends in East Rutherford. Paris and Arizona were fantastic destinations, and even though Montreal was not what it was cracked up to be, I still got to make it into a cool motorcycle trip.\n\nI am grateful to Metallica for inspiring me to travel. I probably would not have gone to any of these cities in 2023 had it not been for them. I am looking forward to going back on the road next year for the 2024 leg of the tour in Madrid and Foxborough. Who knows, maybe I will add one or two more cities to the list.\n\nMy M72 World Tour Itinerary\n\nMy lifetime Metallica concert history\n\nLink to YouTube playlist of all official Metallica concert videos I have been present for\n\nMetallica songs I have seen performed on the M72 World Tour\n\nAll Metallica songs I have seen performed live\n\nA diary of my experience during Metallica’s M72 World Tour stop at MetLife Stadium in August 2023\n\nMetLife Stadium feels like the epicenter of the 2023 mega tour season. It started with the “You can send your kids to see Taylor, or you can send them to college someday, but you can’t afford both” extravaganza in May. It was followed by some prick named Ed Sheeran in June who broke the MetLife attendance record with a crowd of 89,000. Beyoncé followed in July. The Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen is going to round things out over Labor Day weekend.\n\nBut all these shows combined could not match the level of intensity of the two shows Metallica played on August 4th and 6th at MetLife Stadium. Therefore, this is the only non-travel blog in my Metallica M72 World Tour series because Metallica brough the show to me.\n\nThere is something exciting about Metallica coming to the area you live in. They do not just show up and play, they take over the area for four days. They promote Blackened American Whiskey happy hours and events, host a film festival of Metallica related content, promote concerts for bands that their kids are in, and open pop-up stores with all the Metallica merchandise you could want. So, of course I bought half of the inventory at the pop-up store at the American Dream Mall the day before the first show.\n\nThe most important thing to me about Metallica playing at home is getting to attend with my friends. It is a great excuse to get together, and it gives us an event that we will tell stories about for decades to come. In fact, we were telling stories about getting guitar picks at a Metallica show at the old Izod Center in 2003 while we were at the show this year.\n\nMost of us had general admission tickets, and with as many people as I had going with me, it was a logistical exercise in herding kittens to get everyone in the same place at the same time. It started off in the afternoon on Friday, a bunch of us blew off work early, piled into my car, and went to the Blackened American Whiskey and WFAN pre-party at Redd’s in Carlstadt. Others partied at a local brewery; others drank on the NJ Transit Train on the way to the stadium.\n\nAfter the pre-gaming was done, we shot over to the stadium, waited for Joe to get off the train, and headed in. Bobby was not one to wait, he went straight inside and scouted out a spot as close to the railing as he could get for us. We made it inside and then I had to text half a dozen people with our approximate location. I looked up and saw a banner for Larry Grantham who had his #60 retired by the Jets so I told everyone to look for that sign and meet us between that and the stage.\n\nIt turned out to be a pretty good spot, it was right at the main entrance for the band members. First up was Mammoth and we caught a good view of Wolfgang Van Halen’s mother, Valerie Bertinelli who accompanied him to the stage.\n\nMammoth was a lot of fun to watch. Wolfie has rock and roll genes, and he puts in the effort to prove he belongs on stage.\n\nNext up was Pantera. I haven’t seen them since about 1999 before they broke up and when the Abbott brothers were still alive and well.\n\nPhil Anselmo walked on stage and milled about for a bit before the show started. He took his shoes off and performed the entire set barefoot.\n\nZakk Wylde walked right in front of us before he went on stage. Zakk is the 5th greatest guitar player of all time and one of my favorite rock stars ever. I’ve seen him with Ozzy Osbourne, his own band Black Label Society, and Generation Axe. This was my first time seeing him with Pantera. He is the only guitar player in the world that is an acceptable substitute for Dimebag Darrell.\n\nPantera hit the stage and crushed their set. It will always be a strange feeling to see Pantera play without the Abbott brothers, but Charlie Benante and Zakk filled in the gaps admirably. Pantera was one of the best opening bands I’ve ever seen for Metallica.\n\nPantera finished up and anticipation started to build. People that I had texted earlier kept filing in. We could barely contain our excitement.\n\nThe lights went out and “Long Way to The Top” by AC/DC hit the speakers. It was time for Metallica to start and I thought my head was going to explode. Metallica walked through the aisle toward the donut-shaped stage and Lars Ulrich, the greatest drummer in history, stopped right in front of us.\n\nOnce the traditional opening song “Ecstasy of Gold” was finished, the excitement in the stadium was at fever pitch. The band took the stage, and bam! They started right off with my favorite live Metallica song “Creeping Death”! I, along with the frenzied MetLife Stadium crowd of over 80,000, started singing along to every word.\n\nFifteen songs followed through a blistering set that spanned Metallica’s entire career. There was a heavy dose of classics such as “Harvester of Sorrow”, “Holier Than Thou”, “Battery” and others that we all grew up with. They also played three songs from the new album “72 Seasons”, including the live debut of “Shadows Follow”.\n\nJames Hetfield is a superbly talented front man. He held the crowd in the palm of his hand for the entire night. He compelled us to chant “Temptation” during “If Darkness Had a Son”. He acknowledged his 60th birthday just the night before the show as he prepared to play “Fade to Black”.\n\nThere is a genuine element to Metallica that helps them to connect with the audience. Kirk Hammett made a mistake during the intro to “Nothing Else Matters” but he laughed it off and started over and he nailed it. Nobody seemed to be upset about it. Robert Trujillo held down the bass line and backing vocals like the seasoned veteran that he is.\n\nThe stage setup is massive for this tour, and it is very difficult to take everything in. There was smoke, fire, lights, a snake pit, and a beach ball drop. Lars used four different rotating drumkits at different points of the stage throughout the show. We had a great vantage point when the band was right in front of us but had a hard time seeing them when they wandered elsewhere on the stage.\n\nWith “Master of Puppets”, the show came to an end. We were excited, exhausted, and left wanting more. We dove to the floor as the band showered us with guitar picks. I did not manage to grab one, but Pooch got two and gave me one of his. What a guy!\n\nSaturday was a day of rest for the band in between shows. I put on my finest Metallica t-shirt from the European leg of the tour and went to Manhattan with Susan to run some errands and see Bobby and his kids. Susan and I were in Eataly, and someone saw my shirt and told me he was at the show the previous night, too. We traded Metallica stories for a bit. As we walked around town, I spotted people who looked like tourists in Metallica apparel. They really did take over the whole area.\n\nSunday was a bit less hectic getting to the stadium. We left early to be there because I hired a friend BBQ-By-Bear to cater our tailgate. Bear is a grill master who routinely caters tailgates at MetLife Stadium events, and he was the right man for the job.\n\nBear got to the stadium right when the parking lot opened and found a great spot right by the entrance to the stadium to set up. We started to filter in as food was ready on the grill. It was a perfect day for a tailgate and excitement was once again building for the show.\n\nThis time we were on different agendas for when to go inside and where to stand. Ned, Sue, and their kids wanted to get inside for both opening acts, so they went back to the Larry Grantham spot early. Chris was unsatisfied with the view from that spot, so he went in by himself to get another vantage point.\n\nA handful of us went in before Five Finger Death Punch went on to try to scout a different spot with a better view and settled on a different location where the stage was lower. I am not a FFDP fan and was not overly impressed with the show. They were slightly better than my low expectations.\n\nThe canned music routine to start the Metallica set was the same as on Friday. Metallica hit the stage and tore into “Whiplash”, and it was on! Bobby was especially excited, that is one of his favorite songs to see live. They went right into “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and the crowd nearly lost it. This was such a hot opening that I used up nearly all the energy I had on the first two songs.\n\nSunday night followed the same theme of career spanning songs, and as promised was completely unique from Friday’s set. We were treated to the live debut of “Too Far Gone?” which was intermingled with classics like “Ride the Lightning”. Kirk played the solo for “Lux Æterna” right in front of us. While this is far from his best solo, it was mesmerizing to watch a guitar god like him shred right in front of us.\n\nJames Hetfield commanded the crowd again. They re-worked “Wherever I May Roam” to pause the instruments so the crowd could sing the hook repeatedly. Giant beach balls fell from the light towers as the band ripped into “Whiskey in The Jar”. I was wiped out when “One” and “Enter Sandman” finished off the set and the show was over. This time, I was able to grab a guitar pick of my own as it hit the floor!\n\nIt was a bitter-sweet feeling when the show ended. It was just such an epic weekend that I couldn’t wrap my head around it. It was an exciting feeling to know that Metallica was in town and had taken it over. The shows were breathtaking. Most importantly, as far as I could tell, everyone in my group had an absolute blast.\n\nMy plan when the tour was announced was to go to six cities in 2023 and 2024, but the most important two for me were Paris and East Rutherford. Everything else is just going to be the cherry on top. Metallica may be done with my home state, but next up for me is a road trip to Montreal to see them do it all over again!\n\nMy M72 World Tour itinerary\n\nMy lifetime Metallica concert history\n\nLink to YouTube playlist of all official Metallica concert videos I have been present for.\n\nMetallica songs I have seen performed on the M72 World Tour\n\nAll Metallica songs I have seen performed live\n\nA diary of my trip to France to see Metallica’s M72 World Tour in May 2023\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nSince this is 2023 and we were flying United, our scheduled 6:30 PM departure turned out to be a 12:15 AM departure out of Newark Liberty Airport. Our original flight was cancelled, and the replacement flight was delayed numerous times. I guess this type of fun is what I was missing all the years I spent not flying to Europe.\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nWe landed about six and a half hours later than originally planned. Susan arranged for a pickup at the airport and notified the dispatcher about the cancelled flight and the delayed replacement flight before we took off. We landed and she got a note saying that they cancelled the ride because we didn’t show up. So, we stood in the “ham and egger” taxi line and hopped a cab to the hotel. The first thing I noticed about Paris is that they sure do love their graffiti. It’s everywhere, on the walls along the highway, on the box trucks, and on street signs.\n\nWe rolled up to the hotel in Montmartre and our room was not ready, so we headed into town. First off, I needed to kill my jet lag, so I started off with my trusty cure.\n\nWe wandered into Cimetière de Montmartre. The second thing I noticed about Paris is that they like their mausoleums.\n\nAfter checking into the hotel, we set off for dinner at Le Dôme on the Metro. The stations in the Metro do not smell nearly as bad as the stations in the New York City subway. I ordered the monkfish and the third thing I noticed about Paris, and this was not a surprise at all, is that the food is awesome.\n\nWe walked from the restaurant towards Notre Dame through Jardin Du Luxembourg. It reminded me of a smaller version of Central Park. Notre Dame is still being rehabilitated from damage from a devastating 2019 fire so we could not get very close but could see where the fire had badly damaged the structure.\n\nAcross the street, we stopped at La Crème de Paris for dessert. I grabbed a honey crepe and officially ate too much on my first day in Paris.\n\nAt about this point, bone-crushing jet lag set in, so we headed back to the hotel in an Uber. I needed to be at the top of my game for Wednesday, the night of the first Metallica concert!\n\nMay 17, 2023\n\nI woke up ready to rock for the most important day of the year so far, my first Metallica concert since August 2022!\n\nOur hotel gave us a walking tour guide of the surrounding area of Montmartre. One of the stops was a restaurant called Hardware Society, so we stopped there for breakfast.\n\nAfter breakfast, we took a short walk to Sacre Coeur and the Montmartre overlook. This was my first view of what Paris looked like, sprawling and full of buildings that were only a few stories high. I was not expecting the terrain to be so hilly.\n\nWe walked to the Metallica pop up store at Crémerie de Paris. I wanted to beat the lines at the concert by buying my t-shirts there, but there turned out to be a long line to get in anyway.\n\nAlong the walk to the Metallica pop up store, I was taken aback by how many cafes and restaurants there are in Paris. I wondered at first how they all stayed in business, but throughout the trip noticed how full and bustling they all seemed to be.\n\nWith our Metallica merchandise in hand, we took the Metro to the Eiffel Tower. Our tickets included a glass of Moet at the top floor.\n\nThe Tower offered an even grander view of Paris than the Montmartre overlook. The streets are laid out in a chaotic and maze-like fashion, and the sprawl is even more evident than my first vantage point.\n\nOn the way out, we walked down the stairs from the “2nd floor”. I found out the hard way that the 2nd floor is much higher than two stories, and it was a dizzying descent down a long spiral staircase.\n\nWe went back to the hotel for a quick power nap and to get gussied up for Metallica! We grabbed a quick dinner nearby at La Sancerre. It was my first time eating French Onion Soup in France!\n\nWe used Google maps to plot a course to the show at Stade de France in Saint-Denis. It told us to take the Metro to a bus stop to connect there to a bus that went to the stadium. This turned out to be a huge mistake. Our bus did not show and there appeared to be angry commuters walking away in disgust. There was a lot of construction and traffic in the area, and we were confused about what to do. None of the buses that came were the bus we wanted, and the clock was ticking, we had to get there!\n\nWalking didn’t seem to be a good idea; it would take about 45 minutes, which we didn’t have. We tried an Uber, but it looked like it drove past us and was stuck in traffic and wouldn’t arrive for 20 minutes. We tried hailing several taxis to no avail (we couldn’t figure out their red light/green light/no light system) until one finally waived us in, apparently somewhat begrudgingly. I expected to get stuck in traffic as we approached the stadium, but it took about five minutes for him to drop us off right outside. Crisis averted; we were there on time.\n\nThis was my first time in a stadium outside of the US. I read that it previously had hosted international events including World Cup Soccer. But it looked to be very bare bones to me, missing a lot of the amenities that standard NFL stadiums have. The lettering and numbering convention for their seating sections was confusing. I stopped to ask an usher where our seats were. He looked at my ticket and shrugged his shoulders and told us he did not know. It turned out we were only one section over from where he was stationed.\n\nOur seats were in the lower bowl in the 16th row. I normally like getting general admission tickets for Metallica so I can get close, but I had a Ticketmaster snafu and accidentally bought seated tickets. This tour is the first time that Metallica featured a stage in the round in a stadium, normally that practice is reserved for arenas. There were six lighting and sound towers that surround the stage and one of them partially obstructed our view, but not to the point that we would miss any substantial part of the show.\n\nWe sat down 20 minutes before the show. The anticipation was building despite the continued sunshine. At this time of year, sunset in Paris is well after the normal start time for Metallica at around 8:45 PM. With all the exhaustion from the travel to Paris, and the transit debacle getting to the stadium, I barely had time for it to sink in that I was about to live a life-long dream to see Metallica in Paris! It hit me like a ton of bricks when the loudspeaker blared AC/DC’s “Long Way to The Top”, the traditional cue that a Metallica concert is about to start. We were minutes away and I thought my head was going to explode!\n\nAt the commencement of the recorded music to cue the show, Metallica took the stage to a thunderous reception from the crowd. They tore into “For Whom the Bell Tolls”. James Hetfield started jumping up and down to fire up the crowd and the audience sang every word.\n\nFifteen songs followed, and they were a mix of classics, rare cuts, and new songs from their recently released album “72 Seasons”. I was excited to hear “I Disappear” for the first time in years. It was the first time I got to see any of the new songs performed live. “Lux Æterna” was an instant heavy metal anthem. I enjoyed the three songs they played from their greatest album of all, the eponymously named “Metallica”. “Holier Than Thou” always fires me up. The band took delight in playing the instrumental “Orion”, their excitement was evidenced in their body language.\n\nThe centered stage let Metallica connect with the crowd in a way that they couldn’t do from their normal end stage setup at stadiums. James, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo circled the stage throughout the show. Lars Ulrich’s drum kit was relocated to different sections of the stage throughout the show and rotated in each spot, so the audience had many different vantage points for his playing. The band played to all sections of the stadium, including fans in the Snake Pit in the center of the doughnut-shaped stage.\n\nThe frenzied set concluded with “Master of Puppets”, which is critically accepted as one of the most important heavy metal songs in the history of the genre. Fireworks were displayed on the big screens on top of the lighting towers. I thought that was odd, I’m used to actual fireworks at Metallica shows, I wonder if they just didn’t have a pyrotechnic permit for the show in Paris.\n\nUsually, the end of a Metallica show is bitter-sweet because it is over, but this one was different. Due to the nature of the M72 World Tour, they were going to play a second show in less than 48 hours with a completely different set list. I was able to leave happy both from satisfaction from the show I had just seen and anticipation for the second one.\n\nWe followed the crowd to a train station that was fifteen-minute walk away from the stadium. I guess city planners didn’t think it was important to build a stadium near a train station. We made our way back to Pigalle for a nightcap. This section of Paris was especially lively for a Wednesday night. A few glasses of wine later, we walked back to our hotel completely exhausted.\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nThe day started with a breakfast of pain au chocolate from a local bakery. That was one of my objectives, to have pain au chocolate as much as I could in France. Our first destination was the Musée du Louvre. The Louvre started off as a palace for kings outside of the busy section of the city, so it is obscenely large. So large in fact, that it is hard to make sense of some parts of the visitor map. We managed to figure out the route to the Mona Lisa, observing the art collection along the way.\n\nA lot of the art in the Louvre was stolen from French conquests, but in recent years was purchased or collected from donations. It gave me an appreciation for their history and dedication to the arts. I’m not an art critic by any means, but it was interesting to see the conflation of pieces inspired by mythologies, Catholic teachings, and important historical figures.\n\nNext up was a wine tasting at Les Caves Du Louvre. It used to be the wine cellar for the Louvre. Some of the cellar tunnels were cut off for construction of the Metro. It was privately bought and turned into a wine shop that hosts tours. The ceilings were very low, even for someone of my stature.\n\nWe walked along the Seine and back to our hotel, about an hour away. The endless cafes were jammed, and people were out and about on a late spring day.\n\nAfter a quick stop at the hotel, we went to dinner at La Boîte Aux Lettres. I grabbed a steak with smashed potatoes and cheese, it was fantastic. Susan rolled with a piece of fish and gave her meal high marks, too.\n\nAfter dinner we went to see Moulin Rouge. We were prohibited from taking pictures of the show (probably because of the gratuitous nudity) which is too bad because it was quite an interesting experience. I’ve only been to a few Broadway musicals in my lifetime and sat there in agony throughout most of them. But I really enjoyed the Moulin Rouge cabaret, and it wasn’t just because of the nudity. It was an impressive production and featured some incredibly athletic performances and a fascinating contortionist. Maybe being in a different language helped, too. I couldn’t complain about the lyrics since I didn’t understand them.\n\nOverall, visiting the Louvre Museum and the Moulin Rouge was quite a contrast to the previous day’s Metallica-centric activities.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nI woke up ready to rock for the most important day of the year so far, my first Metallica concert since Wednesday!\n\nWe started the day with breakfast at the Breizh Café with both savory and sweet crepes. Why not have your first dessert of the day at breakfast?\n\nNext up, we took the Metro to Le Catacombs for a tour. This was a wild experience, like nothing I had seen before.\n\nThe catacombs were originally a limestone mine underneath the entire city of Paris. Somehow their collective society forgot about the tunnels it left behind as they began to build throughout the city. The tunnels were structurally unsound so houses or even entire streets would sink into the ground. The catastrophe made its way to the king who did nothing at first but finally asked an architect to check out what was happening. They were startled to find the massive tunnels and set about stabilizing them to prevent further damage to the city.\n\nYears later, cemeteries and hospitals were overflowing with carcasses from massive waves of death from diseases like the plague and syphilis. The reigning king ordered the bodies to be dumped in the mine tunnels, thus turning them into catacombs. Millions of bodies were disposed of in the catacombs in the following years, many of them in aesthetically pleasing patterns of femurs and skulls, with the rest of the bones piled up behind them.\n\nThe tour allowed us to walk among the bones throughout a small section of the tunnels. There were an unimaginable number of them throughout our walk. I found it to be paradoxically eerie and humorous. I took a lot of pictures.\n\nThis was a great way to prepare for a heavy metal concert: with skulls, bones, disease, despair, and death!\n\nAfter the tour we stopped at La Mabillon for a drink, and I got a Tiki Toi. The name reminded me of one of my favorite drinks at the Jersey Shore, the Tiki Tea. This one was very different.\n\nI stopped for a quick dinner at Le Nazir and ordered the burger with fries. I forgot they serve fries with mayonnaise in France.\n\nWe changed our plan of attack to get to the stadium, reversing the route we took to get back from the Wednesday show on the Metro. That worked out well to get us there, but the biggest annoyance of our trip stuck upon our arrival at the station. On our way towards the exit, we were stopped by security who asked to see our tickets. We were told we then had to talk to someone who appeared to be some sort of transit officer. She told us we bought the wrong priced tickets and had to pay a EUR 30 fine on the spot! My first inclination was to start screaming and cursing at her, but instincts kicked in right away. I didn’t want to spend the night in a French prison instead of watching Metallica. Incredulously, I paid the fine with my credit card and we headed towards the stadium.\n\nFor the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why our ticket at that price let us get through the turnstiles the previous night. Later, I checked into it, and we were exactly 1 EUR short on each ticket. I would have gladly paid the extra Euro had I known. Anyway, we chalked it up to France needing a way to keep government employees employed.\n\nThis time we had more time before the show to check out the stadium. Susan hadn’t had a chance to get dinner with me, so she tried to get a sandwich at the only concession stand anywhere near us. They said they were out of sandwiches, so she had to eat stale popcorn for dinner. They had only one beer to choose from, Heineken. What kind of stadium only serves one kind of beer? Especially something as awful as Heineken?\n\nThe bathrooms were woefully inadequate, they were far from the stands and undersized. They had no hand driers or paper towels, everyone just either didn’t wash their hands or walked out with them soaking wet.\n\nStade de France totally sucks. I don’t recommend attending an event there just to say you did. Only go for something important like Metallica.\n\nNone of that was going to deter me from having a blast. The standard canned audio to start the show hit the speakers and the crowd heated up. It looked like there were more people there, maybe because the show was on a Friday.\n\nMetallica hit the stage and started with my favorite Metallica song, “Creeping Death!”. I was in absolute heaven, screaming along with the “Die! Die! Die!” chant coming from the frenzied crowd.\n\nJust like on Wednesday, Metallica played a total of sixteen career-spanning songs, each one of which was an absolute delight. I really enjoyed seeing “If Darkness Had a Son” for the first time, the “temptation” chant it incurs from the crowd is intense. They played another instrumental, “The Call of Ktulu” from their second album. The set finished with blistering renditions of “One” and “Enter Sandman”.\n\nThese two concerts made the entire trip worth it. The members of Metallica have more money than they will ever need, and they are in their early sixties, around the age when many people start to think about retirement, especially those who are ultra-wealthy. But Metallica is soldering on, making new music and playing huge stadiums around the world. They have slowed down their touring pace considerably (this entire tour is only 25 shows over the course of two years), but they attack the shows with the same intensity they had when they started the band in the early eighties.\n\nJames told the crowd on both nights that they consider playing in front of crowds to be their purpose. The joy and excitement they play with cannot be faked; they clearly take pride in performing at the highest level of their lives.\n\nThis time the end of the show was indeed bittersweet. I was thoroughly satisfied with both unique sets and happy that I was able to live a dream of seeing Metallica play in France. But I was bummed that the Metallica part of the trip was over, and I must wait until August to see them again in East Rutherford.\n\nWe bought the properly priced tickets for the Metro and headed back to Pigalle for a few drinks and a late-night snack before calling it a night.\n\nMay 20, 2023\n\nWe didn’t have much of an agenda for Saturday, so we started with breakfast at Marcel. We took the Metro to the Seine River for a riverboat tour hosted by Bateau Mouches. The narration was hard to follow because it was in about six different languages, and I kept zoning out before they got to the English portions. But it was a lot of fun and the views of the city from the boat were cool.\n\nAfter the tour was over, we walked to Champs-Élysées. Other than the monuments at each end of the street, there didn’t seem to be much uniquely French to the area. It was a shopping destination full of global brands that I can shop at home. I have a Foot Locker at my local mall, I didn’t feel the need to stop into theirs.\n\nWe took the Metro back to the hotel, and I ran down the hill to get a bite to eat. I heard a commotion and there was a protest headed my way. Prior to the trip, I had seen in the news that there were protests in French cities regarding a proposal from the government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. I couldn’t quite tell, but I think that was what the protest I saw was about.\n\nUnlike the news clips I had seen at home, this one wasn’t dangerous looking. There were some senior citizens with makeshift drums and a megaphone singing a song. They were surrounded by dozens of cops in riot gear. The police presence seemed excessive, but I guess it was best they over prepared.\n\nAfter avoiding catastrophic injuries due to the “riots” we ditched that part of town and went to Rue Montorgueil for the night. Rue Montorgueil is another Parisian walking street with lots of open restaurants and bars with outdoor seating. We settled on Le Compas on for dinner. I went with the pasta and Susan ordered tuna and it was another fantastic meal.\n\nWe stayed in the area and bar hopped for the rest of the night. Let’s just say that the locals sure know how to live it up.\n\nMay 21, 2023\n\nSunday was our day to plan to leave Paris to visit the Champagne region of France. Originally, we were going to rent a motorcycle and head out this way, but logistics got in the way of easily making this happen, so we took the high-speed train there. The trains connecting the cities in France are insanely fast, I can’t think of a form of land transportation I have used in the states that moved this quickly. It only took about 45 minutes to make it to Reims.\n\nWe walked into town from the train station and this city has a much different vibe than Paris. I’m not sure if it was because we were there on a Sunday or because that’s how it always is, but compared to Paris, it was not very lively at all. There is a large pedestrian walkway in the center of town, and a big park nearby, but not many people were out and about, and we couldn’t find much to do.\n\nWe found another Notre Dame cathedral, like the rest of their cathedrals, it was insanely ornate and huge.\n\nAfter checking into our hotel, we walked to GH Mumm for our scheduled activity for the day, a tour of their historic champagne making facilities. Mumm has a history of using sophisticated techniques for harvesting and pressing grapes. We learned how sediment is removed from champagne in a process called riddling.\n\nThe underground tunnel system for their cellars is incredibly long. I think our tour guide used the number of four kilometers in total. Susan noted how much of our trip was spent underground considering the Louvre wine cellars, the catacombs, the Metro, and now the GH Mumm cellars.\n\nMumm seems to be especially proud of the research and development they’ve done on the first champagne that can be enjoyed in space. They are waiting for approval from the French Space Agency to start including their bottles on space flights.\n\nFollowing the tour, we grabbed a simple dinner at one of the only restaurants that was open. I’d say that the Mumm tour was very cool, but other than that, there’s not much to see in Reims as a tourist.\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nWe woke up and got back on the train to Paris and checked into a new hotel. Today was supposed to be the full day we would have been on the Harley, but since that didn’t work out, we winged a new plan. A lot of tourist attractions in Paris are closed on Mondays so we settled on the modern art museum Centre Pompidou.\n\nWe started upstairs at Restaurant Georges for lunch, and I ordered the croque monsieur.\n\nThe view from the rooftop outside the restaurant was cool.\n\nWe walked through most of the galleries to check out the current exhibits. The most interesting one to me was the Norman Foster exhibit, he is a world-renowned architect with a portfolio spanning 50 years.\n\nThe art on display there was expectedly different from what was on display at the Louvre. The contrast in modern art to the classical pieces is very pronounced. It was certainly less centered around mythology and religion. But it is all representative of Paris’ continued dedication to the arts.\n\nDinner that night was at L’Aller Retour. I ordered steak frites with mashed carrots. I sure had a lot of beef on this trip.\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nThis was the third biggest day of the trip, behind only the two Metallica days. Part of my original dream to see Metallica in Paris included renting a Harley and riding it around wine country. Tuesday was the day to seal the deal.\n\nAfter I failed to locate a suitable bike using my paid Harley Owners Group membership, Susan managed to easily find one by contacting ATS Harley-Davidson Paris Bastille. I’m not sure why HOG didn’t make it that simple for me, but I’m glad she just googled it and figured it out.\n\nWe reserved a Road King for 9 AM for when they opened. We woke up and headed straight there to maximize the time on the road. They had the bike waiting for us outside the dealership. After signing off all the paperwork, we got on the bike and headed off. We had until 7 PM that day to get the bike back.\n\nMy normal bike that I’ve owned since 2007 is a Fat Boy. Harley has changed a lot of things since then, and the Road King is a bigger bike than my Fat Boy. It has a hydraulic clutch, a windshield, a bigger engine, and a six-speed transmission (mine is a five-speed). Additionally, my bike has a mount on the handlebars to use my phone as a GPS, but the Road King didn’t have the mount, so I was riding blind in a strange land. Even worse is that everything is in kilometers, there is a toll system I don’t understand, and all the road signs are in French.\n\nAll told, this added a great degree of difficulty for me. But with Susan’s help navigating from the back seat, and my exceptional riding talent and experience, we made it work. We rode through the craziness of the Paris city traffic and made it to the A4 highway.\n\nThe further we got from the city, the less traffic there was, and the scenery got better and better. We exited the A4 in the Champagne region and found signs for a Champagne trail through a series of vineyards. We made our way into Epernay and stopped for lunch. We walked to the Moet headquarters to take a few pictures and got back on the bike.\n\nWe improvised a route from there, heading north and west through Parc naturel régional de la Montagne de Reims. There were vineyards everywhere and the scenery was stunning.\n\nFrom there, we wandered west and south, improvising a route through small towns and farmlands. We passed a lot of old homes and champagne houses. There were signs for WWII memorials, and even a sign for a US Memorial Day celebration. We kept this up until it was time to get back on the A4 to get the bike back to Paris by 7 PM.\n\nThe ride was exactly how I imagined it and I was impressed that we were able to improvise a ride without a GPS in a foreign land. It was the culmination of a dream come true vacation.\n\nWe timed it perfectly, getting the bike back to the dealer with about 25 minutes to spare. They checked it over, decided I didn’t do any damage to it and refunded my EUR 2,500 security deposit!\n\nI noticed that the dealership windows were smashed with a blunt object. I asked about it and was told that the protestors had targeted them for some reason.\n\nWe went back to the hotel to get dressed for one last dinner. We went back to Rue Montorgueil for a late reservation at L’Escargot. Of course, we ordered the snails!\n\nMy last dinner in Paris was duck confit, and it was so good.\n\nThat was it for France, we woke up early the next morning, went straight to the airport and had an uneventful flight back home to New Jersey. I spent the time on the flight reflecting on this trip and writing most of this blog.\n\nI got everything I wanted out of this trip and then some. I got to see the greatest band of all time play two concerts, I got to ride a Harley around wine country, and I got to explore a city I had never been to before. On top of that, I gained a new perspective about traveling to places outside the US. I think I need to keep this up. Most of all, I am grateful for Metallica, I probably would never have done a trip like this if it wasn’t for them.\n\nNext up for me on the M72 Tour is the lone home game: East Rutherford in August.\n\nMy M27 World Tour itinerary\n\nMy lifetime Metallica concert history\n\nLink to YouTube playlist of all official Metallica concert videos I have been present for.\n\nMetallica songs I have seen performed on the M72 World Tour\n\nAll Metallica songs I have seen performed live\n\nMy New Jersey Transit bus was predictably late, and when it arrived it was standing room only. The Lincoln Tunnel was jammed on the way to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. I dodged a few homeless people on my way to the subway platform and hopped the C Train to the Fulton Street Station. A quick walk from there to my Financial District office in Downtown Manhattan and my Monday morning slog to work was complete. I settled into my desk, said hi to everyone, put my phone on the charger and got to work. I am a software developer, and I had a lot of coding to do that day.\n\nThere was nothing out of the ordinary on the agenda for the day. The only unusual circumstance was that my boss was visiting that day from our Miami office. He and I had placed a sandwich bet on a Dolphins/Jets NFL game about a month prior, and my Jets won it for me. We decided we would settle the bet at the recently reopened Lenwich in Hanover Square that day. I knew he would be extra annoyed because he really hates the Jets. That was going to make my sandwich even more enjoyable.\n\nAbout two hours into my day, I paused what I was doing to look at my phone. There was a text message from Metallica (I had previously subscribed to text alerts from their website):\n\nWait, what? A new Metallica song? How come I hadn’t heard anything about this? What is happening? I’m confused! Wait, how to you pronounce the title? Is “Æ” even in the alphabet?\n\nWith alacrity I put my PC headset on and navigated to YouTube. At the top of Metallica’s channel was a link to the new video. I set the volume to maximum and clicked play. Metallica had unleashed a thrash metal instant classic. On first listen, it sounded like a grown-up sequel to “Hit the Lights” from their first album “Kill ‘Em All” crossed with Motörhead’s “Overkill”. I was instantly amazed and fired up.\n\nMy mind was racing as I tried to take it in. I needed to know more so I navigated to metallica.com in search of answers. The home page was remade since my last visit.\n\nWait, what? I just found out about the new Metallica song. But what’s this about a new Metallica album? And what is this about a new Metallica Tour?\n\nI clicked on the tour link and saw the full itinerary. They laid out their touring schedule for 2023 and 2024 all at once. They announced they would play two nights in each city and both set lists would be unique. There were cities all over North America and Europe on the list. One city jumped out at me. It would be a chance to finally make a dream come true.\n\nMetallica is my favorite band, which probably goes without saying. I am imbued with the following beliefs:\n\nMetallica is the greatest band of all time.\n\nJames Hetfield is the greatest singer of all time.\n\nJames Hetfield is the greatest guitarist of all time.\n\nLars Ulrich is the greatest drummer of all time.\n\nKirk Hammett is the second greatest guitarist of all time.\n\nRobert Trujillo is the second greatest bassist of all time.\n\nIf you were to challenge me on any of those points, I would not even bother to argue. I would just think that you are stupid, and it would not be worth my time.\n\nIn 2018 I wrote a story about a twenty year stretch of my life as a Metallica fan against a backdrop of technological changes in the world over that time. I detailed the twenty-two Metallica concerts I had seen up to that point. But Metallica has been on the move since then and I added five more concerts to my total since 2019.\n\nWe flew to San Fransisco in September 2019 for S&M 2, which was the first event at the newly built Chase Center. After a pause in touring for the COVID-19 restrictions, the band hit the road again in 2021. We flew to Louisville in September for the Louder Than Life Festival, and Metallica headlined two of the four nights, playing a distinct set each time. In 2022 I went to the two closest Metallica shows to New Jersey, Boston in May, and Buffalo in August.\n\nEach show was a unique experience, and they were all a reminder about how important it is for me to continue to see Metallica play live at every opportunity I get. They have significantly cut back on their touring schedule, and they are not getting any younger. But they look and sound better than they ever have.\n\nI have been to 27 Metallica concerts over a 30 year stretch from 1992 to 2022. But prior to 2019, I had never traveled very far to see them. I was content to see them play in cities I could drive to from New Jersey, the furthest one being Montreal.\n\nI was never much of a traveler. As a child, our family vacations consisted of driving south for two hours for a two week stay in Long Beach Island. I loved it. I never was jealous of other kids who flew to other places like Disney World. The Jersey shore had everything I needed from a vacation spot, and it was cheap and easy to get there.\n\nNot much changed as an adult. I would rent out houses with friends in various spots between Belmar and Point Pleasant Beach and spend weekends there in the summer. The stories I could write about the things I have seen and done at the Jersey Shore could fill a book. If I could even remember them all!\n\nI also purchased a Harley Davidson in 1999, and I have owned one ever since. When I was not at the shore in the summer, I would be on the bike exploring routes and destinations all along the Appalachian Mountains, from Georgia to Quebec.\n\nTypically, those two activities would satisfy my need to get out of the house and go somewhere. But along the way, I did pick up a nagging desire to mix things up occasionally.\n\nFor a long stretch, in the 2000’s, Metallica would only tour in Europe. They would send me an e-mail with my fan club pre-sale code for tickets every time they announced a tour. It started to get annoying that I had priority access for tickets to shows on another continent, but there were none here in America. I started to think to myself that maybe I should go see them play in France one summer and make a vacation out of it. Maybe even rent a Harley and ride through the countryside for a day or two.\n\nI was never able to put it together. At first, I didn’t make it a priority. Then, I had run myself into financial trouble by gut renovating a house. The project went off the rails and I was flat broke for four years. I finished the project in 2019 and sold my condo and I finally had both the time and the money to try to make the “Metallica in France” dream come true. Then a plague swept the earth and shut down all live concerts!\n\nIn 2021 I tried to go to one of their European shows, but due to a snafu with ticketing, and rising flight prices, I failed to put it together yet again. But that turned out to not be much of a problem when I saw the itinerary for the “M72 World Tour” for 2023 and 2024. Now was going to be my chance to live out that dream.\n\nWithin a few minutes of watching the Lux Æterna video, my phone lit up like a Christmas tree. Friends were texting back and forth about the news and the potential tour dates. I was so distracted that I had to come clean and explain to my boss that Metallica had just announced a tour and I immediately needed to plan. The pre-sale was going to start in less than 48 hours so some quick decisions would have to be made.\n\nThis was a tour announcement like none other. Metallica will play two shows in each city with no song repeats. The stage is in the center of each stadium. It will have a donut hole-shaped “Snake Pit” in the middle of the stage offering a 360 view. The tour itinerary covers North America and Europe from April 2023 to September 2024. The first round of tickets would be sold in two-night passes for each city that cannot be broken up.\n\nThe second city on the tour is Paris and that jumped out at me immediately! This could be my chance to finally make this dream a reality. The date is not great, it will require me to reschedule a camping trip that I traditionally host that weekend, but sacrifices would have to be made.\n\nAfter a few more stops in Europe, the tour heads to North America and the first stop is right here in North Jersey at MetLife Stadium. If Metallica plays New Jersey, I go every time.\n\nThe following weekend, they head due north to Montreal. Motorcycle and Metallica trip!\n\nThe next city that looked good to me is Phoenix on Labor Day weekend. I just visited the area in 2021 for the NASCAR Cup Series championship race and felt like my trip was too short for some of the things I wanted to do. I also have family in the area and they are fun to spend time with. That would be four cities in 2023, a pretty good number to cap it.\n\nMetallica is going to take a well-deserved break starting in November 2023 and they hit the road again in June 2024, beginning again in Europe. Of the five European cities they will travel to in 2024, the one that looked the most interesting to me is Madrid in July. Why limit my dream to see Metallica in Europe to just Paris when I can also go to Madrid?\n\nThe next city on the tour is back in America in Foxborough, MA. That will be another motorcycle and Metallica trip for me, not to mention I have a college friend in the area that I enjoy visiting.\n\nNow that I had an itinerary planned out, it was time to start planning the logistics of buying tickets. To steal a quote from a crappy movie I once saw, I’d rather stick a flaming hot skewer in my eye than deal with Ticketmaster. The company was recently in the news for botching a Taylor Smith tour pre-sale. I was surprised so many people were unaware how horrible the Ticketmaster experience was until then. They have been screwing me since they went online in the late 1990’s.\n\nBut I still have my priceless Legacy Fan Club Membership at my disposal, so I was counting on that to help me get tickets for every show. I was a paid member of the Metclub for about 17 years, and in 2016 Metallica obsoleted the paid tier, but promised all paid members that they would be grandfathered in to future pre-sales before the rest of the general pubic. Since then they have kept that promise. Today, no amount of money could buy you a Legacy Fan Club Membership from their website. Take that, Taylor Swift fans!\n\nI collected my unique pre-sale code and got to work. I asked around to see what friends wanted to go to what shows. I was able to buy four passes for each city (but only two Snake Pit passes if I was lucky enough to pull them). There were too many of us going to the New Jersey show for me to help everyone who was going. But between us all we had enough pre-sale codes to accommodate everyone. For the rest of the shows, I had enough of my own ticket allocations to cover those that wanted to join me.\n\nI read through the fine print in the ticket sale FAQ. The Legacy Fan Club pre-sales all start at 9 AM local time. That meant that for the France and Madrid shows, I would have to be online at 3 AM local time. Great.\n\nThe East Rutherford, Montreal, and Foxborough pre-sales started simultaneously at 9 AM. But I was advised that Ticketmaster does not like when you are buying tickets for multiple events at the same time. It supposedly guards against things like different browsers on the same device, using one Ticketmaster account login or a singular credit card to make simultaneous purchases. There was no good way to verify this, but I was not going to take any chances. I opened two additional Ticketmaster accounts, I assigned each one a different credit card. I lined up three devices: my personal computer, my work notebook computer, and my work desktop computer. I could use them in conjunction to order tickets for the three shows simultaneously. I never trusted the Ticketmaster iOS app, so I nixed the idea of using my phone.\n\nFinally, there was the Phoenix show. That pre-sale would start at 11 AM, but of course the venue has an agreement with Seat Geek instead of Ticketmaster so that would be a different platform and account altogether. I had never previously bought primary market tickets on Seat Geek, so I had a lot of apprehension about their web site capabilities. But I assumed I would be able to figure it out once the rest of the pre-sales were out of the way and just hope for the best.\n\nI reviewed my plan, checked all my accounts and credit cards, got my PCs ready, copied my pre-sale code to them, then set my alarm for 2:40 AM. I do not recall a previous instance that I was so nervous heading to bed. Maybe it was the day before I bought my first Harley, and I knew that I had to ride it home having never previously operating a motorcycle on a highway.\n\nI did not get much sleep, but I was groggy when the alarm went off. My cats Ozzy and Lemmy gave me a confused look as I stumbled down the hallway to the computers I set up. I followed the links from the band website to the event pages on Ticketmaster France and Ticketmaster Spain. The first thing I noticed was that Ticketmaster France has a much different user interface than the American version. On top of that, despite clicking the “EN” link at the top for English, it didn’t translate everything.\n\nI managed to enter both ticket queues for the Madrid and Paris shows and waited about 15 minutes for my spot to pop up to buy tickets. Madrid was first and I immediately selected two Snake Pit tickets and clicked buy. Bingo, I was allocated two Snake Pit tickets! I began the checkout process, and my username and password weren’t working. Unbeknownst to me, you need a separate Ticketmaster account for each country you want to buy tickets in. I had to begin the process of creating an account quickly enough to secure the Snake Pit tickets.\n\nWhile this was happening, I was trying to pull Paris tickets on a different computer. But with the different interface and the failed translations, I was having a much harder time figuring out what to do. Everything was in a grid that looked like this:\n\nThe Snake Pit column was straightforward, but this didn’t appear to be a simple 2-day pass as advertised. I had no idea which to pick but I tried the link for “Tarif Pack 2” but it came back and said “no more seats in this category”. While I was still trying to check out my Madrid tickets, I had to try to figure out how to drop down to general admission for Paris. I grabbed two tickets for what I thought was general admission, then I also had to create a Ticketmaster France account as a requisite for completing the purchase.\n\nGroggy and as confused as I was, I managed to get Snake Pit for Madrid and two tickets for Paris as well. Off to a good start. I went back to bed.\n\nIn the morning, I forwarded the French confirmation e-mail to a friend to ask him if I screwed something up. It turned out that I had, I got seats and not general admission tickets. I guess I confused “Pelouse” with “Carrie Or” when I bought tickets. This was a mistake, but not the end of the world. I would still have a pretty good perspective.\n\nNext up, it was time to buy tickets for East Rutherford, Montreal, and Foxborough at the same time. I checked and my regular Ticketmaster account worked for Montreal, so I was all set with my original three-computer plan. Everything was smooth this time, I was not able to get Snake Pit tickets for any of the shows but was easily able to move down to general admission for all three.\n\nFinally, Phoenix was up next at 11. I checked my Seat Geek account and it said, “there is a problem with your account, please call customer service”. I opened a new account, added a credit card, and got in line for more tickets. I was unfamiliar with their queuing system, but after what seemed like a longer than usual wait, I managed to pull general admission tickets.\n\nWith that, I was locked in. No Ticketmaster snafus in any country was going to keep me out. My trusty Metclub Legacy Membership came through for me.\n\nThis capped a whirlwind 48-hour stretch. I came out of it with a whole new direction in life. I am going to break up the cycle of only spending my vacation time and weekends on my motorcycle and at the Jersey Shore and throw some big travel plans into the mix, inspired by the greatest band of all time.\n\nI have a lot of preparing I need to do. I need to book flights and accommodations along with sightseeing itineraries. I told my personal trainer that I need to step up the intensity of my workouts. I need my strength and conditioning to be as best as possible for these shows.\n\nThis turn of events has inspired me to write. I’m going to keep a journal of events around every trip and every concert and turn it into a Metallica travel blog.\n\nFour countries, six cities, twelve Metallica concerts. When it is done, my lifetime total of Metallica concerts seen will increase from 27 to 39.\n\nThe text message I got on Monday, November 28, 2022, wasn’t just a notification for a new Metallica video. It was my existential pivot.\n\nFull speed or nothing.\n\nMy M72 World Tour itinerary:\n\nMy lifetime Metallica shows:\n\nSongs I’ve seen performed live:"
