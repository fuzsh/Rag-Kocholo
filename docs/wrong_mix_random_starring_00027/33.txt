Hovering between painting and sculpture, Christian Sampson's works vacillate within dimensional boundaries. Through the physical real, illusionistic LED projection, and the related double, he creates playful, layered installations of color, light, and form. Most often his works are created site-specifically in response to the architectural space -- from museum halls, to domestic living spaces, to pop-up performance stages. While his installations align themselves with the minimal language of the Light and Space Movement artists of the 1960’s and can be linked to early cinematic animation and handmade filmmaking experiments, his knowledge and use of contemporary technologies strongly positions his work in the present and future.

Christian Sampson earned a BFA from Ringling College of Art and Design and an MFA from Hunter College, NYC. His works have been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, FR and Centre Pompidou-Metz, Lorraine, FR (curator Pascal Rousseau); the Sarasota Museum of Art, Sarasota, FL; Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg, FL; Hunter College, New York, NY; Southfirst Gallery, Brooklyn, NY; Turn Gallery, New York, NY; Essex Flowers Gallery, New York, NY; Pablo’s Birthday, New York, NY; Jackie Klempay (Situations US) Gallery, Brooklyn, NY; One River Gallery, Englewood, NJ; 247365 Gallery, Brooklyn, NY; Dorsky Foundation Gallery, L.I.C., NY; Brand Library, Glendale, CA; and Domaine Les Crayeres Park, Reims, France. Sampson works in Los Angeles and Sarasota. In addition to an active studio practice and several upcoming exhibitions, he recently completed a public art installation made of laminated colored glass for a Brooklyn public elementary school. He currently has large-scale installations made of colors and the sun’s rays on view at Sarasota Museum of Art and Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg.
