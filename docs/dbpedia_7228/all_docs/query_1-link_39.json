Jack Valentine seemed to have it all. He made good money as an adman, and looked good doing it.

The elderly man, Cal, shares his life story - one not dissimilar to Jack's - of material wealth masking a gaping hole within. Cal ultimately found salvation through philosophy ('the love of wisdom'), and now offers to help Jack by prepping the younger man for the Final Questions we all must face:",
