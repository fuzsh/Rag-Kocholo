This inspirational book is a spiritual journey and self-help guide masked as fiction.

A mysterious visitor, Max, comes to see him. Max, an old friend of Jack’s deceased father, gives Jack a mission to meet three teachers who will show him how to live wisely and well.\n\nFirst, Jack is to meet a saint named Father Mike in Rome, Italy. Father Mike shows Jack how to have a rich spiritual life.\n\nHe explains that leading a fulfilling life means connecting with the soul, embracing serenity, and walking the path of love.\n\nJack learns that it’s essential to forgive others, to love unconditionally, and to connect with one’s inner spirituality. The saint teaches him to cherish silence, seek wisdom, and practice kindness.\n\nThe second teacher Jack meets is the surfer, named Mick, located in Hawaii. Mick embodies a carefree lifestyle, spending his days catching waves and appreciating the beauty of nature. Mick teaches Jack how to follow his heart’s desires and be true to himself.\n\nHe emphasizes living authentically and passionately, to make the most of every moment and appreciate the beauty of the world around him.\n\nMick introduces Jack to the principle of “flow,” explaining that when you love what you do and live authentically, life flows smoothly.\n\nListen to “The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO” for Free.\n\nFinally, Jack meets the CEO, Madeleine, in New York. Madeleine helps Jack understand the importance of achieving professional success without sacrificing personal joy.\n\nShe discusses the balance between love and discipline, between dreaming and doing, and teaches Jack to seek prosperity without losing his peace of mind.\n\nShe teaches him about vision, ambition, and service, and that a good leader is a servant leader.\n\nIn his journey, Jack learns to incorporate these lessons into his life, and his transformation impacts not only his own life but also the lives of those around him. By the end of his journey, Jack has learned to lead a life of inner peace, passion, and purpose.\n\n“The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO” is a holistic guide to personal transformation. The book is not just about changing one aspect of life but about leading a balanced and fulfilling life — a life of joy and abundance. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining harmony in all aspects of life and fulfilling your heart’s desires.\n\nTo sum up the greatness of this book, Sharma uses the compelling narrative of Jack Valentine’s journey to guide readers towards achieving fulfillment and happiness. The lessons provided by the saint, the surfer, and the CEO can help individuals find balance between their spiritual, personal, and professional lives. While it may appear to be a light-hearted fiction novel on the surface, the wisdom and life lessons within its pages offer considerable food for thought. This is actually one of my wife's favorite books!"
