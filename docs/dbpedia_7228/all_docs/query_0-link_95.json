The Vietnam War was provoking a backlash of protests. Ebullient waves from psychedelic drugs, acid rock, newfound sexual freedom, feminism, environmentalism, and backto-the-land hippie communes were creating tectonic shifts in the\n\nexistential landscape. The psychedelic expansion of consciousness began crossbreeding with Buddhism, Hinduism, and New Age spirituality to offer glimmers of internal liberation. Idealistic visions were soon tempered by experience. There were good trips and bad trips. Deaths of students at Kent State and of rock ’n’ roll heroes Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison were sobering shocks. Woodstock was over. The big party woke up the morning after, smelling the coffee and needing to get on with it, laying the foundations for real change. Richard Alpert had been Timothy Leary’s professorial colleague and psychedelic sidekick at Harvard, which fired them both in 1963. After Harvard, they ran a counterculture exploratorium at Millbrook in upstate New York. In 1966, Alpert, the consummate psychedelic psychologist, went to India. He returned as Ram Dass, a Western yogi, and soon became a Johnny Appleseed of Eastern spirituality throughout the West. After a second sojourn in India, from 1970 to 1972, Ram Dass\n\nagain went on the road, lecturing tirelessly for two and a half decades. Over and over, he conveyed, with humor and stories and quotes, a shift from the Western achievement model of “making it happen” and “just doing it” to quieting the mind and being in the moment, being present and attentive and loving—just being. Going radically beyond his previous experiences, he described and manifested in himself a different state of being, transmitted from his guru in India. Some spiritual seeds sprouted. Thousands of people got the message and changed their lives in response. The publication of his handcrafted manual of transcendence, Be Here Now, interjected a new note into the cacophonous cultural conversation of the ’70s. Produced at a commune of graphic artists in the mountains of northern New Mexico and printed on brown wrapping paper, it was more graphic novel and artwork than text. W he n Be Here Now came out as a book, it was a powerful statement of this new way of being. Suddenly, out in the mainstream publishing world, there was this hand-hewn, counter-\n\ncultural owner’s manual for consciousness. It caught on. People passed it around to their friends, and it became a New Age bible. The message of Be Here Now was like a pebble dropped into the cultural pool of consciousness, and it continues to ripple out in contemporary lingo, yoga culture, in names of radio shows like NPR’s Here and Now, in a stream of New Age literature flowing all over the spiritual map. Be Here Now was not just a media phenomenon but part of a cultural shift in consciousness. More people now identify with eclectic nondenominational spirituality. Aging baby boomers are dealing more openly with life and death. Yoga has gone from being an exotic Eastern import to a transnational subculture. In the Internet age, being here now transcends time and space; we dwell entwined in a virtual moment. As we journey together through space on blue-marble earth, planetary awareness grows and separations dissolve. As Ram Dass would say, “ Them is becoming us.”\n\nFor millions of us, Be Here Now opened doors to our deeper selves, clarifying and calming the tumult of insight and upheaval and helping many of us take the first step on the pilgrimage into our own heart. Since the ’60s, the winding way of inner exploration has led us around many bends and up some blind alleys. The inner vision continues to pull, and we continue to follow. Be Here Now shifted our point of view from whatever we thought was going on to seeing life as a spiritual journey. A section of it, the “Cookbook for a Spiritual Life,” gave practical recipes for spiritual practice and yoga for Westerners. The simple message was, “Now that you’ve seen the light, this is how to live in it.” That cookbook is still an essential resource, and the perennial imperative of the book’s cryptic title remains: just be completely present in the moment. Just be. The process of clearing our mind-fields of clutter and attachment in order to just be here now is complex and daunting. It’s a multilevel game. As soon as you focus on one part of the\n\njigsaw puzzle of your consciousness, something else that’s even harder to deal with invariably grabs your attention. As Ram Dass says, “The mind is a wonderful servant, but a terrible master.” In keeping with these many levels of mind and emotion, the image of polishing the mirror is a multidimensional metaphor. Consciousness itself is a hall of mirrors. The key quality of the human soul is the ability to reflect on its own existence. Selfreflection, introspection, self-inquiry—whatever we call it—takes us through many layers of the onion of our inner being, from our most mundane, recursive thoughts to exalted states of pure awareness and unconditional love, of oneness or Godconsciousness. This internal reflection can also be seen as a process of witnessing, or simply observing our own actions, thoughts, and emotions with an attitude of tolerance and love. Witnessing helps us to detach from the external phenomena and sensory experiences, as well as from our mental narratives, our personal story lines that\n\nso thoroughly occupy our attention. Witnessing subtly shifts how we identify ourselves. We shift from being the protagonist of our personal narrative, captivated by the tumult of our thoughts and experiences, to seeing those thoughts and experiences as phenomena reflected in the calm mirror of our inner being. From being the star of our own show, we become an affectionate observer of the play. Alongside this shift in the locus of our inner identity there is a process of external reflection, as we see our inner being reflected and projected onto every experience of the outer world. With patient spiritual practice, we can bring our external experience into ever-closer alignment with our inner being. This is yoga—not just yoga of the body, but also yoga of the mind (jnana yoga), yoga of the heart (bhakti yoga), and the yoga of selfless action (karma yoga). As the veils of illusion begin to become more transparent, as we recognize the limitation of identifying solely with thoughts and\n\nexperiences, with so-called objective reality, we begin to reflect a purer state of being. Removing the dust of impurities and attachments from the mirror of our heart-mind allows the light of the spirit to be reflected. As the layers become more transparent, the light shines through us, and we begin to dwell in a less contentladen, ever-clearer state of awareness. Awareness in the heart flowers into love, compassion, and wisdom. Polishing the mirror, this process of reflecting on ourselves by witnessing and by bringing our external life into harmony with our true being, resolves when we identify fully with our soul, and these layers of being merge in our spiritual heart. Perhaps then there is a further stage when we cease to experience ourselves as separate beings, when the paradoxical relationship of subject and object merges in oneness. That last step requires something we can only call “grace.” Having a guide or guru for this process of self-reflection can provide us with the crucial feedback we need to stay focused and to\n\nkeep us from being distracted not only by our own mental detours, but also by astral and other subtle planes. A true guru reflects our innermost being, our true Self, because he or she lives in that place. The guru’s loving awareness of our journey, at every level, is an ever-present homing beacon on the path. This book of Ram Dass’s teachings is a toolkit to quiet the mind, open the heart, and enter into oneness. These teachings offer practical ways to be here now. Think of this book as a travel guide for the path to nowhere (now-here), a how-to guide for finding that precious sense of inner peace and spiritual reunion. The methods are simple. The path is subtle. We are so close— just a thought away! Only you can know for yourself if polishing the mirror is working. You’ll know if you become quieter inside, more loving and compassionate, more peaceful and present, more content with your life. As with any kind of inner work, there are endless opportunities\n\nfor self-deception. The ego effortlessly morphs into a new, spiritual ego: “Wow, I’m getting really spiritual!” Ram Dass, with his humor and his honesty about his own path and its pitfalls, is a good model. May we treat ourselves with a degree of compassion and patience equal to his, and not take ourselves too seriously. There is, after all, nothing to be accomplished. We are just allowing ourselves to be. IN LOVE, RAMESHWAR DAS\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeing Here Now\n\nBEING HERE NOW sounds simple, but these three words contain inner\n\nwork for a lifetime. To live in the here and now is to have no regrets about the past, no worries or expectations for the future. To\n\nbe fully present in each moment of existence is to live in total contentment, in peace and love. To enter into this presence is to reside in a different state of being, in a timeless moment, in the eternal present. Once you touch this state of pure being, you can never completely forget it. You begin to see how your thoughts keep carrying you away from being in the moment. But being is always here, never more than a thought away. There’s nothing to do, nothing to think about. Just be—here and now. When our thinking mind subsides, what we might call our heartmind takes over, and we can begin to live in love. Love is opening to merge with another being, whether with another person or with God (in the end they’re the same). Love is the doorway to oneness with all things, to being in harmony with the entire universe. This return to oneness, to a simplicity of just being, of unconditional love, is what we all long for. This unified state is the real yoga, or union.\n\nPerhaps this book will provide a new perspective from which to view your life. I hope you find living from this perspective a more meaningful and transcendent way of being in the world. To be fully present with ourselves and other beings is to focus on what is truly important in life, and by doing so, we become more conscious and loving.\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT Perhaps you are already an evolved soul who is separated from the One only by the most gossamer of veils, and your enlightenment will be nearly instantaneous. Or maybe you are a more tentative seeker whose mind pulls you this way and that, and you need more constant reminding of where your true Self lies. Whatever your karmic situation is, may this primer of consciousness be a useful road map to help guide you home. Home is where the heart is. For most of us, it is helpful to set aside some time in each day\n\nto devote to spiritual practice, which means scheduling time in our already busy lives. The path of the heart is not hard or easy, but it takes time and intention. Traditionally the best times are early morning, while the world is still quiet, and during the evening, at the close of the day’s activities. Consider this your time to explore your own inner being, to find more of the meaning of your life. Spiritual practice offers us a chance to come back to the innate compassionate quality of our heart and to our intuitive wisdom. Like shopping for a new set of spiritual clothes, try on these practices of self-reflection, opening the spiritual heart, or selfless service, and see what fits. Then take a look in your mirror and see who you are now and what works for you. Each of us has our own path to follow, our own karma. You have to honor your own unique path. You can’t imitate someone else’s trip. Listen to your heart to hear what you yourself need, take what you can use from these practices, and leave the rest.\n\nTHE ROAD HOME In 1961, I was thirty and at the height of my academic career. I had a PhD from Stanford University, and I was a professor of social relations at Harvard. I had arrived at a pinnacle of life as I thought it should be, professionally, socially, and economically. But inside there remained an emptiness—a feeling that, with all I had, something was still missing. Here I was at Harvard, the mecca of the intellect. But when I looked into the eyes of my peers, wondering “Do you know?” I saw in their eyes that what I was looking for was nowhere to be found. In a social or family setting, people looked up to me and hung on my every word because I was a Harvard professor, and they clearly assumed that I knew. But to me, the nature of life remained a mystery. I had a lot of knowledge, but I lacked wisdom. In this state of discontent, I filled my life with all the things I thought I wanted and that were supposed to be culturally fulfilling. I ate and\n\ndrank too much. I collected material possessions and status symbols: I had a Triumph motorcycle and a Cessna airplane. I played the cello. I was sexually active. But these outer pleasures weren’t giving me the answers I longed for. Deep inside, I had no real sense of satisfaction or contentment. Another psychologist, Timothy Leary, moved into the office down the hall from me. Meeting Tim was a major turning point in my life. We became drinking buddies. I soon discovered that he had a brilliant mind—brilliant in a way that was different, more open to looking at the world in new ways. One semester Timothy returned from the mountains of Mexico, where he had taken psychedelic mushrooms called teonanácatl, or “flesh of the gods.” He said he had learned more from that experience than from all his training in psychology. I was intrigued. In March of 1961, I took psilocybin, a synthetic version of the magic mushrooms, and everything changed for me. I felt that psilocybin introduced me to my soul, which was independent\n\nof body and social identity. That experience expanded my consciousness and changed my view of reality. Our explorations in psychedelics and subsequent dismissal from Harvard created a stir on local and national news and brought us a lot of notoriety. By that point there was a part of me that really didn’t care about degrees and peer reviews, because the worlds I was exploring were far more interesting than academia. Psychedelics allowed me to cut through my traditional upbringing and tap into realms of mind and spirit that would not have been available by other means. When I got high, I felt like this was who I knew myself to be—a deep being, at peace, in love, and free. I continued using psychedelics for five or six years, trying to stay in that place of enlightenment, that place of being love. I would get high and come down, get high and come down, touching that state of being love but unable to stay there. I wanted to be free, not high. Ultimately I realized this method wasn’t working for me, and I began to sink into a deep despair.\n\nIn retrospect, while psilocybin, as well as LSD, was critical to my own awakening, psychedelics are not necessary to the process of coming into your Self. They can show you a possibility, but once you’ve seen the possibility, to keep revisiting it again and again isn’t necessarily transformative. As Alan Watts used to say, “Once you’ve gotten the message, hang up the phone.” Finally you have to live in the world and keep transforming within. Aldous Huxley had given us a copy of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and I realized that the East already had maps of these inner states that we were exploring intuitively and without reference points. So in 1966, I went to India in search of someone who knew about these spiritual planes of consciousness. For the first three months, I traveled with a friend who had a Land Rover shipped to Teheran and invited me to join him. We traveled through Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal amidst a haze of hashish. But it was just another trip—more of the same, getting high and coming down—more of my own reality, leading to more despair.\n\nThen one day in Kathmandu, Nepal, at a hippie restaurant called the Blue Tibetan, a strikingly tall Westerner with long blonde hair and a beard walked in. He was wearing Indian clothes, and he came over to our table and joined us. It turned out that Bhagavan Das, a twenty-three-year-old surfer from Laguna Beach, had been living in India for several years. After a short time with him, I knew he knew about India. I decided to travel with him to see what I could learn. As we were traveling through Nepal and India, I would attempt to tell my usual charming stories or ask questions about where we were going. Bhagavan Das would say, “Don’t think about the past; just be here now,” or “Don’t think about the future; just be here now.” Although he was compassionate, he didn’t involve himself in dealing with my emotions. There was nothing much to discuss. After several months of blisters on my feet, bouts of dysentery, and lessons in hatha yoga, Bhagavan Das said he had to go see his guru in the Himalaya foothills about his visa. He wanted to drive there\n\nin the Land Rover, which had been left in the care of an Indian sculptor with instructions to give it to me if I wanted it. So I went with Bhagavan Das. On our way up to the hills, we stopped overnight, and I went outside to go to the toilet. Under the star-filled Indian sky, I thought about my mother, who had died the previous year of cancer of the spleen. As I was thinking about her, I experienced a powerful feeling of her presence. I didn’t tell anyone about it. The Freudian psychologist in me thought, “There you go, thinking about your mother while you’re on the toilet.”\n\nTHE GURU, REMOVER OF DARKNESS As we were driving up into the hills, I could tell something was going on with Bhagavan Das. Tears were streaming down his face, and he was singing holy songs at the top of his lungs. I sat in the corner of the seat, sulking. I thought of myself as a Buddhist, and I\n\ndidn’t want to see a Hindu guru. We arrived at a small temple by the side of the road, and Bhagavan Das asked someone where the guru was. They said Maharaj-ji was up on the hill. Bhagavan Das went running up the hill, leaving me sitting there. Everybody was looking at me expectantly. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t want to see any guru. But finally, compelled by the social situation, not by my own choice, I went after him. I was stumbling uphill behind this giant who was running in big leaps and crying. As we climbed the hill, we came around to a beautiful little field out of sight of the road and overlooking a valley. In the middle of the field was a little old man under a tree, sitting on a wooden bed with a blanket around him. Ten or fifteen Indians wearing white were sitting around him on the grass. With the clouds in the background, it was a beautiful tableau. I was too uptight to appreciate it. I thought it was some kind of cult. Bhagavan Das ran up and prostrated himself in danda pranam,\n\nlying face down on the ground with his hands touching this old man’s toes. Bhagavan Das was still crying, and the man was patting his head. I didn’t know what to do. I thought this was lunacy. I was standing off to the side saying to myself, “Well, I’ve come here, but I’m not going to touch anybody’s feet.” I didn’t know what this was all about. I was totally paranoid. The old man was patting Bhagavan Das’s head, and then he looked up at me. He pulled Bhagavan Das’s head up and said to him in Hindi, “Have you got a picture of me?” Through his tears, Bhagavan Das said yes. Maharaj-ji said, “Give it to him.” I thought, “Gee, that’s really nice, this little old man is going to give me a picture of himself. Wow.” It was the first ego boost I had gotten all day, and I really needed it. Maharaj-ji looked at me and said something that was translated as, “You came in a big car?” He was smiling. That was the one topic I didn’t want to talk about. We had borrowed the Land Rover from my friend. I felt responsible for it.\n\nStill smiling, Maharaj-ji said, “Will you give it to me?” I started to say it wasn’t my car, but Bhagavan Das jumped up and said, “Maharaj-ji, if you want it, it’s yours.” I sputtered, “You can’t give him that car! That’s not our car to give away.” Maharaj-ji looked up at me and said, “Do you make much money in America?” I figured he thought all Americans were rich. I said, “Yeah, I made a lot of money in America, at one time.” “How much did you make?” “Well, one year I made $25,000.” They all calculated that in rupees, and it was a sizable amount of money. Maharaj-ji said, “Will you buy a car like that for me?” At that moment, I thought that I had never been hustled so fast in my life. I grew up around Jewish charities. We were good at shaking the tree, but never this good. I mean, I hadn’t really even met this guy and already he’d asked me for a $7,000 car. I said,\n\n“Well, maybe.” This whole time he was smiling at me. My head was going around in circles. Everyone else was laughing because they knew he was putting me on, but I didn’t know that. He said we should go and take prasad, “food.” We were taken down to the little temple and treated royally and given beautiful food and a place to rest. This was way up in the mountains—no telephones, no lights, nothing. After a while, we were brought back to Maharaj-ji. He said to me, “Come, sit.” He looked at me and he said, “You were out under the stars last night.” “Yeah.” He said, “You were thinking about your mother.” “Mm … hmm. Yeah.” “She died last year?” “Yeah.” “She got very big in the stomach before she died.” “That’s right.”\n\n“Spleen. She died of spleen.” He said “spleen” in English. When he said “spleen,” he looked directly at me. At that moment, two things happened simultaneously. First, my rational mind, like a computer out of control, tried desperately to figure out how he could have known that. I went through every super-CIA paranoid scenario possible, like, “They brought me here, and this is part of the mind-screw thing. Or he’s got this dossier on me. Wow, they’re pretty good! But how could he know that? I didn’t tell anyone, not even Bhagavan Das …,” and so on. But no matter how grandiose I got, my mind just couldn’t handle this one. It wasn’t in the instruction manual. It was beyond even my paranoid fantasies, and some of them were pretty imaginative. Until then, I had an intellectual position on anything psychic or super-natural that happened. If I heard about it secondhand, I would say, as any good Harvard scientist would, “Well, that is\n\ninteresting. We certainly must keep an open mind about these things. There’s some interesting research being done in this field. We’ll look into it.” Or if I were high on LSD, I as the observer would say, “Well, how do I know I’m not just creating this whole thing out of whole cloth anyway?” But I wasn’t under any chemical influence, and this old man had just said “spleen.” In English. How did he know that? My mind went faster and faster, trying to figure out how Maharaj-ji could know this. Finally, like a cartoon computer with an insoluble problem, the bell rang and the red light went on and the machine stopped. My rational mind gave up. It just went pouf! Second, at that same moment, there was a violent wrenching, a very painful pull in my chest, and I started to cry. Later I realized it was my fourth chakra, the heart center, opening. I looked up at Maharaj-ji, and he was looking back at me with total love. I realized he knew everything about me, even the things I was most\n\nashamed of, and yet he wasn’t judging me. He was just loving me with pure unconditional love. I cried and I cried and I cried and I cried. I wasn’t sad and I wasn’t happy. The closest I can say is that I was crying because I was home. I had carried my big load up the hill, and now it was all done. The journey was over, and I had finished my search. All that paranoia washed out of me, and everything else too. I was left with just a feeling of fantastic love and peace. I was in the living presence of Maharaj-ji’s unconditional love. I had never been loved so completely. From that moment on, all I wanted was to touch Maharaj-ji’s feet. Later Maharaj-ji gave me a spiritual name, Ram Dass, which means “servant of God” (“Rām” is one of the Hindu incarnations of God, “Dass” means servant). He also sent Hari Dass Baba to me as a teacher to instruct me in yoga and renunciation for the next five months.\n\nNOWHERE TO GO During the months I was in yogi training at Maharaj-ji’s little temple in the hills, I got really high. It felt like light was pouring out of my head. At one point I had to go to Delhi to get my visa renewed. I went as a yogi. I had long hair and a long beard and māla (prayer beads), and I was wearing white. As I was walking barefoot through Connaught Circus, in the center of New Delhi, I felt the shakti, the spiritual energy, everywhere. I loved it. My newly spiritual ego was along for the ride too. I put in my visa application and collected the mail from American Express. Then I went to a pure vegetarian restaurant for lunch. I was hungry, but I was maintaining my yogic purity. In India they treat holy people with great respect, but if you’re a white holy man from the West, that’s really very unusual. So I was doubly holy, and they were very respectful. They watched me eat. I\n\nhad the vegetarian special, and I ate very consciously and yogically. At the end they served a dessert that had two little English biscuits in it. I knew those weren’t yogi food. You know, when you’re pure, you can smell which food is pure and which is impure. But there is always a very oral Jewish boy in me too, and he wanted those cookies. So while I looked holy, I carefully edged the dish over and pushed the cookies into my bag. I looked as if I was thinking of something holy. I ate the biscuits in the alley outside the restaurant. Then I went back up to the mountains, an eight-hour bus ride, and as I entered the temple, I went to touch Maharaj-ji’s feet. I looked up at him, and he said, “How did you like the biscuits?”\n\nSIMPLE TRUTH I kept hoping to get esoteric teachings from Maharaj-ji, but when I\n\nasked, “How can I become enlightened?” he said things like, “Love everybody, serve everybody, and remember God,” or “Feed people.” When I asked, “How can I know God?” Maharaj-ji said, “The best form to worship God is in all forms. God is in everything.” These simple teachings, to love, serve, and remember, became the guideposts for my life. Maharaj-ji read people’s thoughts, but beyond that, he knew their hearts. That blew my mind. In my own case, he opened my heart because I saw that he knew everything there was to know about me, even my darkest and most shameful faults, and he still loved me unconditionally. From that moment, all I wanted was to share that love. Although he knew I would have liked to stay with him forever, in early spring of 1967, Maharaj-ji told me it was time for me to return to America. He said not to tell anyone about him. I didn’t feel ready, and I told him I didn’t feel pure enough. He had me turn around and around, and he looked me up and down intently.\n\nLooking into my eyes, he said, “I don’t see any impurities.” Before I left India, I was told that Maharaj-ji had given his ashirvad, his blessing, for my book. I replied, “What’s an ashirvad? And what book?” I didn’t start out planning to write the book that became Be Here Now. Be Here Now is Maharaj-ji’s book. As I sat in the Delhi airport, waiting to leave India, a group of American soldiers kept staring at me. I had long hair, a full beard, and was wearing a long white Indian robe that looked like a dress. One of the soldiers approached me and said, “What are you, some kind of yogurt?” When I got off the plane in Boston, my father, George, picked me up at the airport. He took one look at me and said, “Quick, get in the car before someone sees you.” I thought, “This is going to be an interesting trip.” Forty years and one near-fatal stroke later, it is still quite a journey. Being here now is even more relevant for me. Being in the moment, at ease with whatever comes one’s way, becomes contentment. This practice allows me to be present to love and\n\nserve others and to express unconditional love in the world. When you are fully in the moment, this moment is all there is. It feels like time slows down. When your mind is quiet, you enter into the flow of love, and you just flow from one moment to the next as naturally as breathing. Whatever arises, I embrace it with love in the moment. This is my practice of polishing the mirror to reflect Maharaj-ji’s love. In this moment there is just awareness and love. If someone asks me how to get into their heart, I give them this practice: I Am Loving Awareness. In India when people meet and part they say, “Namasté,” which means: I honor the place in you Where the entire universe resides. I honor the place in you Of love, of light, of truth, of peace.\n\nI honor the place in you Where if you are in that place in you and I am in that place in me, There is only one of us. Namasté. RAM DASS MAUI AUGUST 2013\n\nChapter 1\n\nPolishing the Mirror\n\nMIND FIELDS The essence of yoga is union or becoming one with the universe. The conceptual heart of yoga, Patanjali’s yoga sutras, begins with “Yoga citta vritti nirodha,” which means “unified consciousness comes with cessation of thoughts.” Quieting the mind allows the natural depth of the spirit to manifest. Meditation, the practice of quieting and concentrating and purifying the mind, aligning it with the spirit, is a foundation of yoga. Although it can start from the thinking mind and you can get into it through thought, meditation goes beyond the thinking mind. Meditation stems from the truth that who you really are is more than who you think you are. The more you desire to know who you truly are and why you are here on earth, the more you are drawn to that truth. As you are pulled inward, you begin to leave behind the kinds of clinging and attachment that keep distorting and narrowing your vision.\n\nYour mind can take you into the spirit, but it can also keep you deeply attached to your ego, to who you think you are. Western culture glorifies the mind, but there are other ways of knowing, and the thinking mind is only part of our being. The reality of oneness is greater than what is available to you through your senses and your thoughts. Attachment to the melodrama of your ego is what keeps you from being here now. This model of who you think you are and how you think the world is constantly brings you down into separateness. These are habits of mind. Because of the nature of these attachments, you can see only what you can see, which from the ego’s standpoint is a world of subject and objects, me and the material world. A more skillful use of the intellect is contemplation. It is also a form of jnana (pronounced “gyān”) yoga, the path of knowledge and wisdom. In this yoga of the mind, you use the mind to reflect on itself. For example, each morning, take out a holy book and\n\nwork with a thought. Don’t read many pages; just take one thought and sit with it for ten or fifteen minutes. Think about it throughout your day. If we reflect on the qualities of Christ’s love, or of equanimity, kindness, or compassion, we begin to take on those qualities. Sri Ramakrishna said, “If you meditate on your ideal, you will acquire its nature. If you think of God day and night, you will acquire the nature of God.”\n\nYOU CAN’T KNOW IT; YOU CAN ONLY BE IT If you’re reading this, you already recognize you’re on a spiritual journey. You also may understand that, from within the illusion of our separateness, what we perceive is relative reality, what in India is referred to as māya, the projected illusion of subject and objects. All around you there are various levels of relative reality. In exploring the mind, it is helpful to examine those relative realities.\n\nMany people are so totally involved in their lives that the spiritual element is irrelevant to them. They have no sense that behind their apparent reality there is another equally true reality, a spiritual dimension. When you begin to awaken to your predicament—that you are trapped in illusion—you begin to see through the dreamlike quality of the veils of illusion. Everything you thought was real you now see as māya (illusion). Motivations and desires affect our perceptions. We don’t necessarily see things as they are. We see them as we are. Our desire system creates our perceptual universe. In that sense, you can say our reality is a projection of how we identify ourselves. Hari Dass, my yoga teacher at the ashram in India, once wrote on his chalkboard, “If a pickpocket meets a saint, all he sees are his pockets.” In The Lazy Man’s Guide to Enlightenment, Thaddeus Golas says, “You never have to change what you see, only the way you see it.”\n\nGurdjieff, a great spiritual teacher who taught in Europe and America in the early decades of the twentieth century, noted that if you think you’re free and you don’t know you are in prison, you can’t escape. Gurdjieff saw us as being in a prison of our own habits of mind. Unless we understand how we are conditioned by our desires, we remain stuck in the reality they create, like a television program with an ad that keeps repeating over and over, implanting a subliminal message while we watch the show.\n\nBEYOND THOUGHT In the West we get rewarded for rational knowledge and learning. But only when you see that the assumptions you’ve been working under are not valid, when you despair of getting there through your rational mind, does the possibility of truly changing your mind arise. Albert Einstein said, “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.” He also\n\nsaid, “The mind can proceed only so far upon what it knows and can prove. There comes a point where the mind takes a leap—call it intuition or what you will—and comes out upon a higher plane of knowledge, but can never prove how it got there. All great discoveries have involved such a leap.\" In the Vedic lore of India, the ancient sages say there are three ways to acquire spiritual knowledge: First and most direct is through your own experience. Second, you hear about it from somebody you know who knows, and they tell you.\n\nThird is to study or learn from books like this with your logical mind. What about other ways of knowing or experiencing life, ways that resonate with an inner validity and that feel intuitively right? Einstein said, “I didn’t arrive at my understanding of the\n\nfundamental laws of the universe through my rational mind.” He got there through intuition. Intuition is something we really don’t understand, though we use it all the time. We say someone knew something intuitively. They have entered into a subjective rather than objective way of knowing. In fact, there are ways of knowing other than through the senses and through the thinking mind. In 1906, William James wrote in The Varieties of Religious Experience: Our normal waking consciousness … is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application…. No account of\n\nthe universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question…. They may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. People first awaken to a spiritual dimension in their lives in an incredible variety of ways. Some people seem to open up to it through traumatic experiences, as people describe when they’ve come near death or at another moment when they touch something much deeper than the usual way they thought about things. Other people awaken through meditation or through religious experiences. Others arrive at it through sex or through drugs. I remember lecturing in a hall once, back in the early ’70s. Most of my audience at that time was young, and they tended to wear white and smile a lot and wear flowers. I wore my māla and had a\n\nlong beard. In the front row there was a woman of about seventy, who had on a hat with little fake cherries and strawberries and things like that on it. She was wearing black oxfords and a print dress, and she had a black patent leather bag. I looked at her, and I couldn’t figure out what she was doing in the audience. She looked so dissimilar to all the rest. These talks were like a gathering of an explorers club, where we would come together and just share our experiences. I started to describe some of my experiences, some of which were pretty far out. I looked at her, and she was nodding with understanding. I couldn’t believe that she could understand what I was talking about. I was describing experiences that I had using psychedelic chemicals, experiences that involved other planes of consciousness. I’d look over at her, and there she was, nodding away. I began to think maybe she had a problem with her neck and maybe it had nothing whatsoever to do with what I was saying. I kept watching and getting more and more fascinated and getting\n\nmore and more outrageous, and she kept nodding and nodding. At the end of the lecture, I just kind of smiled at her so intensely that she just had to come up and speak to me. She came up and said, “Thank you so much. That makes perfect sense. That’s just the way I understand the universe to be.” And I said, “How do you know? I mean, what have you done in your life that brought you into those kinds of experiences?” She leaned forward very conspiratorially, and she said, “I crochet.” And at that moment, I realized that people arrive at spiritual understanding through a much wider spectrum of experience than I ever anticipated. Part of the process of awakening is recognizing that the realities we thought were absolute are only relative. All you have to do is shift from one reality to another once, and your attachment to what you thought was real starts to collapse. Once the seed of awakening sprouts in you, there’s no choice—there’s no turning back.\n\nActually, we all know that reality is relative; we have known it since childhood: “Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.” Life is a dream.\n\nLOSE YOUR MIND TO GAIN YOUR SOUL One reason to practice purification is to cool out, so we’re not creating so much heavy karma for ourselves. We are constantly preoccupied with the creations of our minds. Einstein again: “The true value of a human being can be found in the degree to which he has attained liberation from the self.” What we strive to be liberated from are our habitual thought patterns about ourselves and the pull of our sensory experiences. Lightening up in these areas allows us to refocus on centering and calming the mind with meditation, mantra, or the practices of bhakti yoga. As these practices deepen, the higher wisdom comes.\n\nTaming the mind is fraught with paradoxes. You have to give it all up to have it all. Turn off your mind. There is a place in you beyond thought that already knows—trust in that. Jesus tells us that unless we become like little children, we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. That child mind, sometimes called beginner’s mind in Zen, is the innocence of pure being, of unconditional love. If we are to live in that state of pure being, something within us must die. It’s like when a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. The caterpillar does not become a flying caterpillar; it morphs into a butterfly. This is the pathless path. Where the journey leads is to the deepest truth in you. It is really just returning to where you were initially before you got lost. Shedding the layers of the mind is like taking layers off of an onion. You peel them all away until you come to your essence. The spiritual journey is not about acquiring something outside yourself. Rather, you are penetrating the layers and veils to return to the deepest truth of your own being.\n\nWhat you seek is already within you. This reality is subjective, not the outer objective reality. You may experience it as focused in the center of your chest. It can be called the soul, or in Hinduism the Atmān, or in Buddhism the pure Buddha-Mind. Jesus Christ said, “The kingdom of God is within you.” This is the space of full awareness that is in harmony with the universe; this is wisdom itself. The full spirit of God is inside each of us. When you want to approach God, go inward.\n\nENLIGHTENING UP Offering up or cleaning up the ego stuff that distracts you from the spirit is called purification. Purification is an act of letting go that is done out of discriminative awareness—that is, you understand that you are a soul passing through a life in which the entire drama is a script for your awakening and that you are more than just the drama. You are a spiritual being having a human experience. Your\n\nlife experience is a vehicle for coming to God, for becoming conscious, for becoming liberated. Ultimately that’s what you are doing here. This awareness helps you discriminate between thoughts, feelings, and actions that bring you closer to God, to your own freedom, and those that take you away from it. Instead of filling your mind with the daily news, fill it with stuff that helps you become more conscious, that liberates you. As you become more aware of what gets you to God and what doesn’t, you will naturally let go of what doesn’t. That’s purification. You do it to get to God, not for the sake of being pure. So how do you become conscious of all these unconscious influences? Go within to your spiritual heart, your hridayām, and watch the drama that is your entire life. When you quiet your mind enough to transcend your ego, you can begin to hear how it all is. Then you watch with unbearable compassion for yourself and all beings. Watching involves what you may call the witness consciousness, which comes from your soul plane. It is another\n\nway of polishing the mirror, to connect your thinking mind with your spiritual heart. You observe your behavior and thoughts, enhancing your ability to live fully in the moment, to be here now. Then, when you are with a candle flame, you are the candle flame and the watcher. When there is a task to do, you are the task and the observer of the task. It’s not that you do it—it’s how you do it, where you are coming from as you act.\n\nWATCHING THE WATCHER The witness doesn’t evaluate; it doesn’t judge your actions. It merely makes note of them. It’s a subtle thing, the watcher watching him- or herself watching. It’s actually two planes of consciousness simultaneously, the witness and the ego. The witness is connected to the soul plane. At first, you may be distracted and remember to witness only\n\nnow and then. Later you’ll notice that although you still fall asleep and lose the witness, you start to remember to witness again sooner. Just notice. You don’t have to change anything. Eventually things will change naturally. After some practice, it gets more subtle, and throughout the day you remain centered in the witness, watching life’s drama unfold. The witness is always here and now. It resides in each instant of living. You ask yourself, “How do I use my every moment to get here?” The attitude is not heavy or tight, like “I’ve got to be careful; I might make a mistake.” Relax, be light, dance through it all, trusting, quieting, flowing. Your witnessing lives in the flow of your love and the quietness of your mind. Women in Indian villages talk and gossip as they walk back from the well, but they never forget the jugs of water on their heads. The jug of water is what your journey is all about. So do what you do in your life, but don’t forget the jug of water. Don’t forget what it’s all about. The illusion keeps pulling you back into forgetting. Lost in your\n\nmelodrama, you keep forgetting into it. Sometimes you spill the water. You will keep forgetting and remembering and forgetting and remembering. And every now and then, you remember. Keep your eye on the mark.\n\nBREATHING IN, BREATHING OUT Eventually the balance shifts. You allow your life to become simpler and more harmonious. Less and less you grab at this and push away that. You listen to hear how it is rather than imposing a structure. Imposing structures doesn’t set you free. Your romantic attachment to your own story line and how it comes out fades. “Who am I becoming?” and “What will I be when I grow up?” are irrelevant when you are just being. All of these models just fall away. You start to sit simply, live simply, just be where you are, just be with whomever you’re with when you’re with them. You listen for your dharma, the spiritual way of living your life.\n\nAldous Huxley reminds us, “The body is always in time, the spirit is always timeless and the psyche is an amphibious creature compelled by the laws of man’s being to associate itself to some extent with its body, but capable, if it so desires, of experiencing and being identified with its spirit.” Your whole life becomes a meditative act. It’s not just sitting on your meditation pillow, your zafu. All of life is a big zafu, no matter whether you’re driving or making love or whatever you’re doing. It’s all meditation. It is the practice of being here now. When you meditate, you begin to develop the power of your mind through concentration, through one-pointedness, by following the breath or repeating a mantra. You develop the capacity to put your mind on one thought and keep it there and let everything else flow by. You don’t stop your mind. You let it flow. But you bring one thought constantly to the surface. You keep coming back to one thought. “Breathing in, breathing out,” or “Rising, falling.” Or you use your mantra, “Rām, Rām, Rām, Rām,\n\nRām …” Whether you are eating, sleeping, making love, “Rām, Rām, Rām …” keeps going. You spiritualize your life. You convert it all by maintaining a frame of reference that has the dual capacity of centering you and increasing the power of one-pointedness. Maharaj-ji told me, “Bring your mind to one point and wait for grace.”\n\nA GUIDED VISUAL MEDITATION Sit straight, so your head, neck, and chest are in alignment. Start by focusing in your heart area, in the middle of your chest, where the hridayām, the spiritual heart, is located. With your mouth closed, breathe in and out of your chest, focusing on your heart as if you were breathing in and out through your heart. Breathe deeply. Because of the purity of your seeking, many incredibly high beings are present, and with them comes the spiritual substance out of which all form derives. You can imagine that substance as a\n\ngolden mist that fills the air. With every breath, don’t just breathe in air; imagine you are pulling into yourself this golden substance. Fill with it; let it pour through your entire body. Breathe in the energy of the universe, the shakti of the universe. Breathe in the breath of God. Let it fill your whole body. Each time you breathe out, breathe out all of the things in you that keep you from knowing your true Self; breathe out all the separateness, all the feelings of unworthiness, all the self-pity, all the attachment to your pain, whether it’s physical or psychological. Breathe out anger and doubt and greed and lust and confusion. Breathe in God’s breath, and breathe out all the impediments that keep you from knowing God. Let the breath be the transformation. Now let the golden mist that has poured into your being focus in the middle of your chest; let it take form as a tiny being, the size of a thumb, sitting on a lotus flower right in the middle of your chest. Notice its equanimity, the radiance that comes from within. Use your imagination. As you look upon this being, see that it is\n\nradiating light. See the light pouring out. As you meditate upon it, experience the deep peace that is emanating from this being. Feel, as you look upon this being, that it is a being of great wisdom. It’s sitting quietly, silently, perfectly poised in your heart. Feel its compassion and its love. Let yourself be filled with its love. Now, slowly let that tiny being grow in size until it fills your body, so its head fills the space of your head, its torso, your torso, its arms, your arms, its legs, your legs. So now in the skin of your body sits this being—a being of infinite wisdom, a being of the deepest compassion, a being that is bathed in bliss, a being that is self-effulgent: a being of perfect tranquility. Let this being begin to grow in size. Experience yourself growing until everything in the room around you is within your body. All of the sounds, all the sensory experiences are coming from inside you. Continue to grow. Feel your vastness, your peace, your equanimity. Your head extends into the sky. Expand until your\n\ntown, your environment, and all those beings within them are contained within you. Experience the human condition; see the loneliness, joy, caring, violence, paranoia, a mother’s love for her child, sickness, fear of death—see it all. It is all within you. See it with compassion and with caring and, at the same moment, with equanimity. Feel the light pour through your being. Let yourself grow still larger. Feel your vastness increase until you are sitting in the middle of this galaxy, the earth deep within your belly. All humankind is within you. Feel the turmoil and the longing. Feel the beauty. Sit in this universe, silent, peaceful, compassionate, loving. All of the creations of human beings’ minds are within you; look upon them with compassion. Continue to grow until not only this galaxy but every galaxy is within you, until everything you can conceive of is within you. All of it is inside you. You are the only One. Feel your aloneness, your silence, your peace. There are no other beings here; all planes of consciousness are within you, and all beings are within you.\n\nYou are the Ancient One. Everything that ever was, is, or will be is part of the dance of your being. You are the universe, so you have infinite wisdom; you feel all of the feelings of the universe, so you have infinite compassion. Let the boundaries of your being dissolve, and merge yourself into that which is beyond form. Sit for a moment in the formless, beyond compassion, beyond love, beyond God. Let it all be in its perfection. Very gently, very slowly, let the boundaries of your vast being, the One, reestablish themselves. Vast, silent, all is within you. Come back from beyond the One and slowly come down in size. Come down through the universes into this universe, until your head is once again among the planets and the earth is within you. Come down again until your head is once again in the heavens and the cities are within you. Come down in size until your head is at the top of your room. Stop here for a moment. From this place, look down into the room and find the being who you thought you were when you began this\n\nmeditation. Look at that being, bringing to bear all of your love and compassion. See the journey of that being as it is living out this incarnation; see its fears, its doubts, its connections. See all the thoughts and objects it clings to that keep it from being free. See how close it is to knowing who it is. Look within that being and see the purity of its soul. Reach down and, with your mind, very gently place your hand on the head of this being and bestow upon it your blessing that in this very life it may fully know itself. Experience simultaneously that which blesses and that which is being blessed. Now come back down into the body you thought you were when you began. You are still flesh surrounding a being of radiance and wisdom, a being of compassion that comes from attunement with the truth, with love for all that comes from being that vast One. That love and peace are pouring out of you to all beings everywhere, like a beacon for all those who suffer. Remember those people toward whom you have felt less than\n\nloving. Look to their souls and surround them with light, with the love and peace of this moment. Let go of the anger and the judgment. Send the light of love and peace out to people who are ill, who are lonely, who are afraid, who have lost their way. Share your blessings, because only when you give can you continue to receive. As you journey on this spiritual path, accept the responsibility for sharing what you receive. That is part of God’s harmony, of becoming an instrument for the will of God. Let the radiant, perfect being within you again assume its diminutive form, the size of a thumb. See it again sitting on a lotus flower in your spiritual heart, in the middle of your chest, radiant with light, peaceful, immensely compassionate. This being is love. This being is wisdom. This is the inner guru. This is the being within you who always knows. This is the being you meet through your deeper intuition when you go beyond your mind. This is the tiny form of the entire universe that exists within you.\n\nAt any time, you need only sit and quiet your mind, and you will hear this being guiding you home. When you finish this journey, you will have disappeared into this being, surrendered, merged, and then you will know the truth that Ramana Maharshi, a great realized being from India, meant when he said that God, guru, and Self are one.\n\nChapter 2\n\nBhakti Yoga, the Path of Devotion\n\n“YOGA” MEANS “YOKE” or “union”—union with God. Bhakti yoga is\n\nthe path of devotion, of loving God and imbibing God’s love. The practitioner of bhakti, the bhakta, is the lover, and God is the Beloved. Bhakti uses the dualism of relationship, the deep longing of the heart, for the lover to merge with the Beloved, to become one in love. Bhakti is the path of the spiritual heart, using our human emotions to forge the connection between the human and the divine. The practices of bhakti yoga awaken this flow of love. We may sing to the Beloved, we may pray, we may sit with a picture of a holy being, or we may just dwell in the sweetness of remembering God. Once you have set out on the river of love, all you have to do is let it carry you to the ocean. When Maharaj-ji was asked how to meditate, he said, “Meditate the way Christ meditated…. He lost himself in love.” Devotion complements the quieting of the mind in meditation by opening the heart. This outflowing of the heart toward the object of our devotion further polishes the mirror reflecting the\n\nspirit. This flow of loving energy amplifies other methods too, as we’ll explore later. Opening my heart made it easier for my mind to change. That’s really what devotion is about—it’s a way of making it very easy to turn your mind in a certain direction because the love is so seductive, because it brings so much joy. Ramakrishna said, “Bhakti, love of God, is the essence of all spiritual discipline.” The yoga of devotion starts from right here where we are, as embodied souls separate from God. When we are fully present in this moment, with a quiet mind and an open heart, we experience the flow of love from our spiritual heart. Bhakti yoga opens us to this flow of divinely inspired love. You could say bhakti is the love play, the līla, between God and the soul. Bhakti yoga uses the dualistic relationship of lover and Beloved to take us into the essence of love, to become love. Love has a built-in power to carry us beyond the limitations of our separate being, our ego, to the Atmān, our higher being. Our\n\npersonal emotional love gets absorbed into the all-encompassing unconditional love of the One. As Meher Baba said, “Being is dying by loving.” Of all the different yogas, all the many ways to the One, all the various routes up the mountain, bhakti is known as the easy path. With bhakti, you don’t really have to do anything; you just relax and let go and open your heart. It doesn’t matter whether you call it love of God or of the guru or of the truth of who you are. How you think of it is really irrelevant. The emotional tidal wave of a love affair with the Divine is so intense that it carries you beyond your thinking mind. This devotion begins to permeate whatever you’re doing in your life, bringing it into the divine love play. In Sanskrit that soul joy is called sāt cit anānda, “truth-consciousness-bliss.” Or you could say, “Consciousness of Truth is bliss.” Devotion to God underlies most spiritual traditions, especially those oriented more to the emotional and ecstatic than to the\n\nintellectual. Love is more than an idea. We can’t just sit down and intellectually figure out what bhakti or devotion is about. It has to do with the heart, and heart trips are experienced in a realm that’s not necessarily conceptual. The harder you try to think your way through to devotion, the harder it will be. Hafiz the poet said, “O thou who are trying to learn the marvel of love from the copybook of reason, I’m very much afraid that you will never really see the point.” We can think and talk about bhakti yoga, but we experience it through kirtan, or chanting; mystical poetry; the remembrance of saints; mantras for opening the heart; or just by being together in love, in true satsang. The openness of love is timeless. When you are with another being in love, you are sharing your being, your presence. You are just here, together in love. The minute I heard my first love story I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was.\n\nLovers don’t finally meet somewhere. They are in each other all along. RUMI Many of us are afraid to let go of our judging minds to fall into love, to be absorbed into the liquid flow of the universe. In the case of divine love, faith makes it easier to let go. In romantic relationships it’s a tricky balance because relationships bring up our personal fears and vulnerabilities. Understanding the difference between emotional or romantic love and divine love is helpful in allaying those fears. Loving God is totally safe because the object of love is ultimately your true Self. I n Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche speaks of what is necessary for a spiritual transmission between two people—a relationship of openness and trust and warmth. Another expression of that relationship is from the I Ching: “The Master said … when two\n\npeople are at one in their inmost hearts, they shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze. And when two people understand each other in their inmost hearts, their words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of orchids.”\n\nHOW DO I LOVE THEE? Gurdjieff talks about three levels of love. There’s physiological, sexual, biochemical love—“let’s make love.” Then there is romantic love, which is personality love, loving an object. Romantic love has in it jealousy and possessiveness and all the interpersonal psychodynamics. When you say, “I fell in love with so-and-so,” what you are really saying is, “So-and-so turns me on to the place in me where I am the ocean of love.” The third kind of love is conscious love, spiritual love. It is important to understand that there is a difference between romantic love and spiritual love. To change romantic love into an expanding,\n\nconscious love, we have to take it up another level. Conscious or spiritual love is unconditional; it’s soul love. To enter into the space of conscious love you become love—not loving someone or something, but just being love. This is not to say these levels of love are really separate or that one kind can’t be contained in another, such as sexual love becoming subsumed in love of the Divine (a practice of Tantra, a yoga that uses external energy for internal transformation). Bhakti focuses on spiritual love, the soul’s love for God. If we can see even for a moment that loving another person is loving the manifestation of the spirit in them, just loving love, then they become yet another form of the Beloved, of God. This is love’s truth: that love is in all of us, that we are one in love. Rām hi kewal prema piyara Jnani leo jo ja nani hara\n\nLove loves only love He who knows this can know FROM THE RAMAYANA OF TULSI DAS\n\nLOVE IS A STATE OF BEING When I live in the place where I am love, I see love wherever I look. It’s very far out. Imagine seeing love in everyone and everything. Love doesn’t demand that you do anything about it. We’re all right here in love. To the extent another being is open, when I meet them, there’s a harmonic resonance with the place where they also exist as love—not that they are loving, but where they are love. Suddenly here we are in the ocean of love, which is what Christ’s love is about. This love isn’t possessive. We can’t collect it. We can only become it. As you grow in devotion and focus more and more on the Beloved, you tune in to a deeper place within yourself. The\n\nemotional, romantic qualities give way to a new kind of love where finally you see everyone and everything as the Beloved. It is only when you begin to understand that love is a state of being that you can really be in love. If you and I are truly in love, if we both dwell in the place in ourselves that is love, we are together in love. Being in love is sharing a common state together. Anandamayi Ma, the Indian saint whose name means “blisspermeated mother,” said to her devotees, “You all love this body so much that you often come to see me, unmindful of the long distance that many of you have to travel. Yet, it is true that this body has no relationship with any of you except the kinship of the Atmān [the universal soul] which this body enjoys equally not only with each of you but even with all trees, creepers, and foliage around, as well as with rocks, mountains and everything else.”\n\nGURU KRIPA (THE GURU’S GRACE)\n\nWhen Dada Mukerjee, an old devotee of Maharaj-ji, visited the Neem Karoli Baba Ashram in Taos, New Mexico, he was surprised to find sincere devotees who had never met Maharaj-ji in the body. Dada said, “The real miracle is these devotees who never met Maharaj-ji and have the same devotion.” They knew Maharaj-ji primarily through the stories in Be Here Now and Miracle of Love. Many Westerners have realized that if you invite Maharaj-ji into your heart, he will be with you. That quality of loving, trusting openness allows you to receive the transmission from another being. It was Maharaj-ji’s love and my opening to him that allowed his blessings to come through. The way bhakti works is you just love until you and the Beloved become one. As each person opens and loves, the grace comes through—it just pours into you. Let me always feel you present, in every atom of my life.\n\nLet me keep surrendering my self until I am utterly transparent. Let my words be rooted in honesty and my thoughts be lost in your light, Unnamable God, my essence, my origin, my life-blood, my home. FROM PSALM 19, TRANSLATED BY STEPHEN MITCHELL For me, the form of the Beloved is my guru, Maharaj-ji Neem Karoli Baba. Because the guru is so much a part of my path, I am often asked if it is necessary to have one. It depends on how you understand what a guru is. As you go deeper, you begin to understand (as the meditation at the end of the last chapter shows) that God, guru, and Self are indeed one. So the answer comes on different levels. On one hand, it’s not necessary to have an external guru, because the true guru is an internal relationship. In the higher sense of Self, you are the guru.\n\nOn the other hand, as long as you identify yourself as a separate entity, it can be helpful to have a personal guru to keep you headed in the right direction. It depends on what you need. In bhakti yoga the form of your Beloved can be whatever you love deeply. You can find it in God, in a guru, in a teacher, in a flower, or a pet. The Beloved is everywhere. You can find the Beloved in anyone or anything you love deeply enough that opens your heart and takes you through. Just allow that love to open you and dissolve the boundaries of your separateness, melding into one. Listen to the messages that come through as you sit quietly, and you will find plenty of guidance. The quieter your mind gets, the more you are able to hear these inner messages and allow them to guide you. How will you know your guru? The guru will know you. You don’t have to look for the guru. The guru appears when you are ready. You’ll know. There won’t be any doubt. The guru is a mirror that reflects your higher Self, allows you to see that place of love\n\nand pure being in yourself. The guru may be Christ or any of a number of beings, and not necessarily on the physical plane. Your guru will guide you, to the extent that you ask purely, through one teaching after another. Some teachings may take the form of other teachers or situations or experiences. Other teachings may come from inner experiences as you quiet inside and deepen your practice. As you begin to trust in that relationship, you will become more and more attuned to that presence and awareness. Ask your guru to guide you, and you will begin to see how each life situation is a teaching from your guru to bring you home. In India it is understood that you do not seek the guru. Rather, it is the guru who finds you. A guru is different from a teacher. A teacher points the way; the guru is the way. The guru beckons from beyond. He or she is somebody who’s all finished. A teacher or teaching, on the other hand, is somebody (or something) standing next to you and pointing up the road.\n\nMost people we call gurus are really teachers whose goose is not fully cooked. The likelihood of finding a being who is completely done is fairly slim. Most teachers are still working out their own karma; they have their own stuff still to resolve. A teacher can be someone through whom a teaching comes, though they themselves may not be the full truth. From your point of view, if you’re seeking truth with a pure heart, you separate the purity of a teacher’s message from the stuff of their karma. That discrimination develops as you listen to the guru inside, to your Self. Then you take a teacher’s truth, and you work with it and use it to take you further on your path. The rest is their karma. Even your enemies can be teachers who wake you up to a place that you’re not, that you need to bring into your awareness. They help you get free of that place and get on with it. If you see everything in the universe as a way to work on your own consciousness—even if it’s showing you where you’re unconscious\n\nor where you’re asleep—then everyone and everything in the universe becomes your teacher and a means of awakening. My own teachers have come in all kinds of packages. Some years ago I was invited by John and Toni Lilly to swim with their dolphins, Joe and Rosie. Everybody wanted to swim with dolphins, and I wanted to swim with dolphins too, although I wasn’t quite sure why. When I got to the holding tank, it was a cold, gray day. I thought maybe this was really not for me. But other people were watching, and after all, this was Ram Dass swimming with the dolphins. I got into the water, and these huge beings zoomed by me very close up. They were quite intimidating. I was treading water and feeling out of my natural medium. After a while, one of the dolphins, Rosie, was sort of hovering just to my left, and I reached out and touched her. I assumed that when you touch a wild creature it would be startled or irritated and swim away. But Rosie didn’t swim away.\n\nI started to stroke Rosie’s back. It was amazingly soft, like silk, very porous. I stroked some more. The wild creature model of who I had thought she was had stopped working. In that model, she wouldn’t have allowed me to stroke her because I was doing it with considerable pressure at that point. In that moment, my mind let go, and I started to experience ecstasy just being with Rosie. Then she dove to the bottom of the pool, but I stayed on the surface. When I didn’t follow her to the bottom, she came back up to get me. When I finally let go, Rosie turned herself upright, vertical in the water, and pressed her stomach against my stomach. I noticed everyone watching me with my stomach pressed against this dolphin’s stomach, and I wondered, “Is this legal? Is it ethical?” I found myself putting my arms around her and kissing her on the mouth, saying, “Oh, Rosie!” I was going into such states of ecstasy. I realized that Rosie, as one of my teachers, was taking me out of my mind into the fullness of the moment that is part of the mystery of enlightenment.\n\nTeachings are everywhere. Your guru is waiting for you to be ready for him or her. You don’t have to rush off to India, because the guru and the teaching are always right where you are, right here, right now.\n\nDIVINE RELATIONSHIPS Devotion is a love affair between your soul and God. K. K. Sah, one of Maharaj-ji’s closest devotees, was with Maharaj-ji since childhood. Maharaj-ji assigned him to watch over me, and he took me to live in his home in those early days in India. Here is what he writes about devotion: Devotion is easy and natural and has no hard and fast rules on how one should meditate. By devotion one can realize the secret of love itself. On this path the aspirant sees the universe as the very expression of his Beloved.\n\nThe only thing it requires is faith—implicit faith. There is nothing to argue, it is beyond logic. It is like learning to swim: a person cannot enter the water unless he can swim, and swimming is impossible without entering the water. There are various attitudes or feelings with which one may approach the Beloved. You might feel as though God were your child, like the feeling of Yashoda (Krishna’s mother) toward her baby Krishna, or the feeling of Mary for the infant Jesus. Or you could see God as a friend. Again there is the attitude of the servant toward his Master, where you serve the Lord as Hanuman serves Lord Rama in the Ramayana. Then there is the attitude of lover, where you see your Beloved with the love of husband or wife…. Becoming the bride of God, like the Gopis sporting with Lord Krishna or St. Therese the Little Flower married to her Beloved Jesus. Finally there is the attitude of peaceful contemplation of the great saints and sages, the ancient yogis of India.\n\nThere are many ways to open yourself, to make yourself more receptive to this love for God. One way is through satsang, the company of Saints, contact with the living spirit of truth and love in other beings. Delighting in the stories and incidents of God in His many forms and incarnations— like the life of Christ, or Rama or Krishna—can also bring this love. Or by humbly serving at the feet of the Guru, the devotee can efface the ego in surrender to God. And constantly singing His name and His praises further centers the mind and heart on Him. For the devotee, the mere repetition of the Name of God brings His Presence. Then with firm faith, one crosses the ocean of desire in the boat of the Name.\n\nMAHARAJ-JI The method of the guru is called guru kripa, which is the particular\n\nform of bhakti yoga that focuses on the guru and on the guru’s blessing or grace (kripa). Most of the time I’m just hanging out with my guru, even though he’s no longer in the body. The thoughts and remembrances of him come up a thousand times a day. I may be sitting with someone, and they turn into my guru— over and over again. It’s just hanging out with this incredible being of love, of consciousness, of presence. It’s a way of opening myself to those qualities. It’s a process of surrendering to that place of unconditional love. The essence of a relationship with a guru or spiritual teacher is love. The guru awakens incredible love in us, then uses that love to help us out of the illusion of duality. The relationship between the guru and the chela (“devotee”) was beautifully described by Ramana Maharshi: “It’s like an elephant waking up upon seeing a lion in a dream. Just as the appearance of the dream lion is enough to wake the elephant, so also is the glance of Grace from the Master enough to waken the\n\ndevotee from the sleep of ignorance to the Knowledge of the Real.” In other words, the guru, as a separate entity, exists only within the illusion of separateness, within the dream. As soon as the method of the guru has worked and it awakens you, it automatically selfdestructs. The relationship between a guru and a chela has nothing to do with the intellect whatsoever. You may think you’re surrendering, but there’s really no choice involved in it. There is just deep karma unfolding so that you are drawn to the guru when the moment is right. At first all I wanted to do was be with my guru, look at his form, and touch his feet. After a while, the love grew different, no less intense but less to do with the form, until I was very fulfilled just being at a distance from him. And as time went on, it just kept growing deeper and deeper, and I didn’t care if I was with his form at all anymore. As I went deeper still, it wasn’t about a man in India anymore—it was the essence of guruness. I began to\n\nexperience it in myself instead of in relation to him as an external being. The whole dynamic of the relationship was changing as I was deepening and my heart was opening and my surrender was increasing. I’ve said half jokingly that I worshiped his form until I realized his form was just the doorpost and I was just worshiping doorposts. As I looked through that doorway, each surrender led me further in. It was a method that took me right back into myself and beyond the form. The guru constantly reflects back that part of us that is beyond form. That process also illuminates the dust on our own mirror, the impurities and imperfections of our individuality that keep us from becoming one, from living fully in that place of pure being and unconditional love. Sometimes, for a moment, the guru will blow it away to give us a glimpse. I remember standing in the front yard of a humble house in a village in the hills when Maharaj-ji arrived unexpectedly. I was told to remain outside, so I had the opportunity to watch other\n\npeople arriving. They seemed to appear almost out of nowhere, coming from all directions. Women were running, wiping flour from their hands on their aprons, carrying their half-dressed babies. The men had left their shops unattended. People were pulling flowers from the trees as they came, so they would have something to offer. They came with a feeling of expectation, with such joy and a reverence that could not be mistaken. I watched newcomers arrive, some skeptical with questions. I saw their hearts gently open and this soft, flowerlike quality emerge under the tender care of the master gardener. Maharaj-ji touched each person’s heart in a way special to that individual. Everyone’s experience with him was different. That’s why you can’t explain what it was like to be with him. Everyone had their own heart connection. How do you describe a being like Maharaj-ji? It’s like trying to describe the sweetness of a fruit or the fragrance of a rose. When I was with him, there was nothing other than Maharaj-ji—it was\n\ntotal, effortless worship. Krishna Das remembers, “We would come up against our fears and our stuff, and then he’d just kill it with love. Maharaj-ji would just look at you and giggle, and you would forget your stuff.” He was like a magnet of love attracting us all. And that love was his real teaching. For some devotees, what stands out is the precious intimacy that comes from experiencing another being within the same space that your own being occupies, like the whisper of a lover who knows your innermost heart. When you are in the presence of unconditional love, you are in the optimum environment for your heart to open. The moment your heart opens, you are once again letting in the flow, and that flow is where you experience God. That is the experience of being with Maharaj-ji. Perhaps your experience with your Beloved is like that too. Meher Baba, in Life at Its Best, said, “Devotees should keep their love for their Guru alive and aglow, by making him their constant companion in all their thoughts, words and actions, while\n\ncarrying on their responsibilities, commitments and all other apparently necessary things of this world.”\n\nTHE FEELING OF DEVOTION I will set You on my breath So You will become my life. RUMI Swami Muktananda, in his guru kripa sadhana, used to meditate intensely on his guru, Nityananda. He would visualize bringing him into his own body until he himself became Nityananda. So intoxicated did he become in his devotion to his guru that there were times when he didn’t know if he was Muktananda or Nityananda. A sense of that feeling of devotion comes from the first-century Odes of Solomon:\n\nMy heart was split, and a flower appeared; and grace sprang up; and it bore fruit for my God. You split me, tore my heart open, filled me with love. You poured your spirit into me; I knew you as I know myself. … My eyes are radiant with your spirit; my nostrils fill with your fragrance. My ears delight in your music, and my face is covered with your dew. Blessed are the men and women who are planted on your earth, in your garden, who grow as your trees and flowers grow, who transform their darkness to light. Their roots plunge into darkness; their faces turn toward the light.\n\n… There is infinite space in your garden; all men, all women are welcome here; all they need do is enter.\n\nHANUMAN, DEVOTED SERVANT OF RĀM The Indian epic the Rāmayana is a saga of God taking physical form as a warrior prince to guide humanity and strengthen our faith. It’s a story of grace. The legend is that it was first written down in Sanskrit over 2,000 years ago by the poet-sage Valmiki. A vernacular Hindi version by Tulsi Das is recited and performed in Hindu homes and temples and at annual festivals. It’s like the Bible of North India. You can read the Rāmayana on many levels, as an actual historic event or a romantic tale of the battle between good and evil. You can also hear the characters as symbolic archetypes of sacred and secular forces, the soul and the ego, the\n\ntruth of dharma and the illusion of desire, all of which vie within each of us. It is a multilevel work of living spirit that stirs our impulses toward divinity. One of the main characters in the Rāmayana is the monkey god, Hanuman, who is the perfect servant and great devotee of Rām— God in the human form of a prince. Hanuman represents our simian lower nature in service of the highest Self. Hanuman says to Rām, “When I don’t know who I am, I serve you. When I know who I am, you and I are one.”\n\nRām and his wife, Sita, and his brother, Lakshman, were banished to the forest for fourteen years under extraordinary circumstances. (You will have to read the book if you want all the details.) Sita, the perfect wife, who is also the soul and the earth mother, the shakti or power of God, is stolen away, kidnapped by Ravana, a demon king who is the bad guy in the story. Ravana is full of ego and pride. He has ten heads, and every one of them is full of power. Rām, though he is God on Earth, is distraught because he’s also a husband. (As a husband he’s bereft, though as God, he’s not.) Looking for Sita, Rām enlists the help of the bears and the monkeys, who are rather human characters too. The chief monkey to help him is Hanuman. They search for Sita and finally ascertain that she has been taken by Ravana to the island of Sri Lanka (which used to be called Ceylon) off the southern coast of India. There is an ocean between India and Sri Lanka, and when the monkeys and bears all get to the shore, they can’t figure out how to\n\nget across to rescue Sita. They’re discussing it among themselves, and each one has a reason why they can’t jump across. Somebody has to just jump the ocean; there’s no time for anything else. Finally they turn to Hanuman, who is just sitting there kind of meekly. “Hanuman, you haven’t said anything.” Now, Hanuman is under a curse because of some mischief he got into when he was a young monkey and inadvertently disturbed a yogi. Otherwise he has all the power in the universe, since he lives only to serve God. But he’s cursed to have no selfconsciousness of his own power (just as you or I really have no sense of our true inner power). One of his companions says, “Hanuman, you have the power to leap the ocean.” He says, “Oh, I do? Oh yes, of course, I can jump over the ocean.” At that point, he starts to grow in size from just a regular monkey into a huge, huge form. This is really just a symbol of the leap of faith that each of us has to make, to have faith in ourselves\n\nand faith in the universe, faith in the flow of things, to go beyond ourselves. Hanuman leaps across the ocean as Rām’s messenger to locate Sita and reassure her that Rām has not forgotten her. Sita, the perfect devotee of Rām, represents all devotees. Hanuman is serving God by reminding the devotee to have faith—that God cannot possibly forget us. This is from William Buck’s version of the Rāmayana: In his mind Hanuman had already crossed the sea and entered the demon city. He climbed one of the Malaya hills to get firm ground under his feet. He began to fill up with power. He grew very large and heavy, and his tread pressed down on the hill and crushed the caves of the serpents. Out from the underworld came the richly dressed Nagas [the serpent gods], bruised and hissing, their hoods spread wide. In their anger they rolled on the ground with tongues\n\nflaming. They spat fire and bit the rocks in passion. Their venom cracked the hill, and gleams of red metal and stone shone from within the Earth. Hanuman climbed higher. With smiles of amazement, the heavenly Gandharvas [the astral musicians] and their Apsarasas rose half-dressed from the hill into the sky and looked down to watch. Hanuman climbed up through their hillside parks, where Gandharva swords and bright colored robes were hung on trees, and golden wine cups and silver dishes were on the ground in fair shady gardens hiding lovers’ beds of lotus petals. Hanuman neared the summit. His feet squeezed water from the hill. Rivers tumbled down, rockslides rolled, bright fresh-broken veins of gold sparkled, tigers ran off and birds flew away. The tree spirits fled, and in their dens the wild cats yelled in a frightful chorus like the cry of the mountain himself through the voice of all his animals.\n\nHanuman stood on the hilltop. He held his breath and sucked in his stomach. He frisked his tail and raised it a little at the end. He bent his knees and swung back his arms, and on one finger gleamed Rama’s gold ring [that he was taking to Sita]. Then without pausing to think he drew in his neck, laid back his ears and jumped. It was grand! It was the greatest leap ever taken. The speed of Hanuman’s jump pulled blossoms and flowers into the air after him and they fell like little stars on the waving treetops. The animals on the beach had never seen such a thing; they cheered Hanuman, then the air burned from his passage, and red clouds flamed over the sky and Hanuman was far out of sight of land. That white monkey was like a comet, pushing the sky from his way and bumping clouds aside. The wind roared under his arms and was pushed down from his breast as he passed, and made the ocean pitch and roll. Sea spray rose and\n\nsteamed up the Sun. Beneath Hanuman as he went, the green salt water parted, and he could see the whales and fishes like people surprised at home. The air around Hanuman became electric, and sheets of light gathered and crackled—blue, and pale melon green, and flickering orange and red. Halfway across to Lanka, the golden mountain Mainaka lived on the ocean floor, and from under sea he saw Hanuman coming and thought he would be tired…. “Rest awhile,” said Mainaka. “Let me pay my ancient debt to your father, the Wind.” … “Forgive me, but I must not break my flight,” said Hanuman. What a glorious leap! A leap into the unknown, a leap way beyond Hanuman’s capacity, a leap way beyond who he thought he was. Your own leap—your leap into life, into death, into the next moment, into freedom—comes from giving up the model of who\n\nyou think you are. Who are you? Are you a straight person? Are you a clown? Have you been laughing forever? Have you been sad long enough? Is it all very heavy and important? Or is it kind of light and playful? How does this round work for you? It’s all wide open this time. It’s all wide open. On Hanuman’s return, after he has found Sita and leapt back across the ocean, Rām praises and embraces him in a moment of divine affection. Hanuman, ever the humble servant, responds, “Save me, save me (from the tentacles of egoism), my lord!” Rām says, “As long as men shall speak of you, you will live on Earth. No one can equal you. Your heart is true; your arms are strong; you have the energy to do anything. You have served me faithfully and done things for me that couldn’t be done.” “It’s nothing,” said Hanuman, “I am your friend, that’s all.” Hanuman is the connection between bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, and karma yoga, the yoga of action and selfless service. He can accomplish anything because of the purity of his love for\n\nGod. When he repeats Rām’s name, Hanuman remembers who he is, and when he does things in Rām’s name, nothing can stand in his way. Serving as Hanuman serves is a way of making your entire life an offering, an act of devotion. For Hanuman, each action is an opportunity to place a flower at the feet of Rām, the Beloved. Maharaj-ji had us learn the “Hanuman Chalisa,” forty verses in praise of Hanuman. The opening of the “Hanuman Chalisa” (see the invocation) inspired the title of this book. Krishna Das, who has helped spread the Chalisa in the West, says, “Chanting the Chalisa is a powerful way … to enter into the flow of Love and Grace. In the Chalisa, we bow to the great beauty, strength, and devotion that Hanuman embodies; we also begin to bow to that place in ourselves. The Chalisa inspires us to make the mirror of our heart as clean as Hanuman’s so that we can become aware of the great beauty and love that lives within us as our own true nature.” Maharaj-ji said Hanuman is the breath of Rām.\n\nChapter 3\n\nKarma Yoga, Living in the World\n\nONCE YOU GET that first glimpse of living Spirit, once your heart opens even for a moment to unconditional love, everything in your life becomes grist for the mill of your awakening. That awakening is from ego consciousness, your limited self, to the Self, the universal Spirit present in each of us, the God consciousness. It’s such grace to share this path of the heart together. Although I went through a major transformation on my journey, that’s not how the journey goes for everyone, nor is rapid transformation necessary. For many people, their inner transformation occurs through subtle changes over long periods of time. In any case, it is a fallacy to think you’ll get closer to God by changing the outer form of your life, by leaving your partner or changing your job or moving to another place, by growing your hair or cutting your hair or giving up your material possessions. It is not the outer form that changes; it is the nature of the inner being that fills the form. If you’re a lawyer, you go on being a\n\nlawyer, but you begin to use being a lawyer as a way of coming to God. One form is no more spiritual than any other. The essential work of developing a spiritual consciousness is quieting the mind and opening the heart.\n\nYOUR KARMA IS YOUR DHARMA The game of enlightenment starts from exactly where you are in your life at this moment. It’s not about rejecting or walking away from any part of your life. The game is to bring all of your life into harmony at every level, to act according to dharma, the law of the universe, truth, how it all is. Your karma is what you are given to do in your life, based on past actions. Making a spiritual practice out of your karma, using it to go to God, is what brings karma into dharma, life into harmony with the spirit. From a spiritual standpoint, the intent and the manner of doing something are more important than the act itself.\n\nWhen you bring all of your life into harmony at every level, you act in accord with dharma. Another way to say it is you’re doing God’s will. All forms of yoga are ways of coming into union with God. Karma yoga is putting all the activity of your life—work, relationships, service—toward consummating that union. How you go about your work in the world determines whether your work is a vehicle for your spiritual awakening or for getting more caught in māya, increasing the illusion of separation. Karma yoga uses selfless action and service as a way of bringing your life into harmony with the One. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna to do what he does, but to offer the fruits of his actions to him, to Krishna, to God. To use your daily life and work as a conscious spiritual path means relinquishing your attachment to the fruits of the actions, to how they come out. Instead of doing it for a reward or a result, you do your work as an offering, out of love for God. Through love for\n\nGod, your work becomes an expression of devotion, of bhakti. Loving service to others is also a way of offering your work to God. In the Rāmayana, Hanuman expresses his devotion through his service to Rām. Hanuman exemplifies that combination of bhakti (devotion) and karma yoga (service). Hanuman personifies Khalil Gibran’s statement, “Work is love made visible.” Like Hanuman, you serve others as a way of honoring God. It’s an attitude you develop, an attitude of offering. Every action you perform, you offer as selfless service, “seva” in Sanskrit. In the same vein, Christ says about service, “What you do for the least of my brothers and sisters you do for me.” Seva doesn’t have ego in it; it’s all soul. Any action can be seva. Everything you do—cooking, working, gardening—is an act you can offer to God. Offering your work and all your actions to God takes daily life out of the realm of ego and into the higher Self. Karma yoga is a great practice, especially for us Westerners who are so addicted to doing, because it opens us to being even while\n\nwe’re doing. Letting go of the doer lightens your load. It’s not even your load any more. “Not my will, but Thy Will.” I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy. RABINDRANATH TAGORE Find someone or something that needs help, and help out. Work on yourself to make it a conscious act of seva. Gandhi said, “The act that you do may seem very insignificant, but it’s important that you do it.” Another term for karma yoga is “right action.” In the West the concept of right action is a difficult one to hear because it runs counter to our achievement and goal-oriented culture. In India, they have a very deep sense of doing one’s dharma. From that view, it’s natural to attune yourself to be in harmony with the laws\n\nof the universe. Your life is the part you play. You go from being the star of your own show to becoming an actor in the divine play. That Bhagavad Gita instruction to be unattached to the fruits of your actions is the key. If you are a parent raising a child, don’t get attached to the act of raising the child. That doesn’t mean you’re not a loving, active parent. Your job is to love and nurture, feed and clothe, take care and guard the safety of the child, and guide him or her with your moral compass. But how the child turns out is how the child turns out. Ultimately he or she is not your child; who they turn out to be is up to God and their own karma. Your attachment, your clinging to how the child is going to turn out, affects every aspect of how you parent. A lot of our anxiety comes because we are attached to how a child is supposed to come out—smart, successful, creative, whatever it is we want for our child. Of course, you parent your child as impeccably as you can. “Parent” is your role to play because that is your dharma, and naturally you become immersed in your role in life. But it is also\n\nimportant to remember you’re a soul playing a role. Who your child is and who you are are not roles. As a conscious being, you do all you can to live in your soul and to create a space for others to be in their soul too. But you do so without trying to change the existing karma. You don’t need to change your karma, only your attachment to it. Attachment is what keeps you stuck in your limited reality. Your attachment, wishing your loved ones to be different than they are, keeps them the same. Just allow them to be the way they are and love them. Then they may change. But it’s not up to you. Samuel Johnson said, “He who has so little knowledge of human nature, as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition, will waste his life in fruitless efforts.” Just keep working on yourself until you are radiating love for each of the beings in your life. When you are radiating love, then everybody else is free to give up their stuff when they’re ready to give it up. Like a skillful gardener, you create a space for people to\n\ngrow when they’re ready to grow. As a parent you create the garden for a child to grow (that’s why they call it kindergarten), but you don’t grow the flower. You cultivate and fertilize the earth and keep it weeded and moist, and then the flower grows naturally.\n\nWITNESSING YOUR OWN MELLOW DRAMA The essence of karma yoga is to free yourself from attachments to the events of your life, to stop creating more karma that gets you more stuck, and to get free of your existing karma. The minute your awareness grasps at anything, whether through attraction or aversion, you create karma from that link between awareness and the acts (or thoughts or emotions) that follow from the desire or the aversion. Action arising from awareness not identified with attraction or aversion creates no karma. Karma is the residual effect of an attached act. No attachment, no karma. The Great Way is not difficult\n\nfor those not attached to preferences. When neither love nor hate arises all is clear and undisguised. Separate by the smallest amount, however and you are as far from it as heaven is from earth. If you wish to know the truth, then hold to no opinions for or against anything. To set up what you like against what you dislike is the disease of the mind. When the fundamental nature of things is not recognized the mind’s essential peace is disturbed to no avail. … When you try to stop activity to achieve quietude your very effort fills you with activity. …\n\nDo not remain in a dualistic state avoid such easy habits carefully. If you attach even to a trace of this and that, of right and wrong, the Mind-essence will be lost in confusion. Although all dualities arise from the One, do not be attached even to ideas of this One. When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way, there is no objection to anything in the world, and when there is no objection to anything, things cease to be—in the old way. SENG-TS’AN, FROM HSIN-HSIN MING, VERSES ON THE FAITH-MIND, TRANSLATED BY RICHARD B. CLARKE One way to get free of attachment is to cultivate the witness consciousness, to become a neutral observer of your own life. The\n\nwitness place inside you is simple awareness, the part of you that is aware of everything—just noticing, watching, not judging, just being present, being here now. The witness is actually another level of consciousness. The witness coexists alongside your normal consciousness as another layer of awareness, as the part of you that is awakening. Humans have this unique ability to be in two states of consciousness at once. Witnessing yourself is like directing the beam of a flashlight back at itself. In any experience—sensory, emotional, or conceptual—there’s the experience, the sensory or emotional or thought data, and there’s your awareness of it. That’s the witness, the awareness, and you can cultivate that awareness in the garden of your being. The witness is your awareness of your own thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Witnessing is like waking up in the morning and then looking in the mirror and noticing yourself—not judging or criticizing, just neutrally observing the quality of being awake.\n\nThat process of stepping back takes you out of being submerged in your experiences and thoughts and sensory input and into selfawareness. Along with that self-awareness comes the subtle joy of just being here, alive, enjoying being present in this moment. Eventually, floating in that subjective awareness, the objects of awareness dissolve, and you will come into the spiritual Self, the "
