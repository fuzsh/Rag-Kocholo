        "text": "Class Notes and Newsmakers\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n’40-’47\n\nColby Magazine\n\nclassnews@colby.edu\n\n’48\n\nDavid Marson\n\nclassnews1948@colby.edu\n\n’49\n\nAnne Hagar Eustis\n\nclassnews1949@colby.edu\n\nWell, here I am again. Thanks to those of you who have been in touch. As I write, it’s fall in New England with foliage at peak. For those of you no longer in New England, remember those spectacular bright red maples, my favorites! ✹ Cynthia Crook Lieck reports from Venice, Fla., that she survived Hurricane Ian. “I’m sure there are other ‘Colby kids’ doing the same thing. Aston Gardens Independent Living took a lot of damage, seen and unseen. Thankfully, my two daughters here had no real damage to their homes. I was with one on the island for four days after Ian passed, home for two days, then to other daughter’s for four more as a rain-penetrated LR wall, facing north and east (worst direction), needed immediate treatment for five days, but back home yesterday. More work here (wall and floor) but I shouldn’t have to leave again. I’m so thankful for my daughters and the efforts here. And I am well. God bless those many who have suffered far more. No other news in my life right now.” ✹ I had a call from Mary Lou Roberts Friberg, who really only wanted the address and telephone number of another classmate. However, she did report that her husband died last August at 96. They had had 73 wonderful years together. ✹ John Stuart reports that he went to medical school following Colby, and after completing a residency and internship he practiced for 23 years in Providence, R.I. While there, he delivered his daughter, who is now also a doctor and with whom he now lives in California. John states that he’s “living a good life!” ✹ Dwight Erlick called me from his home in Scottsdale, Ariz. He’s a retired psychologist with a son and daughter and three grandsons and a granddaughter. He spends his summers in Portland, Ore., with his daughter. He’s a great proponent of Match, having discovered the site eight years ago. He’s also a Rummikub addict, playing three or four hours a day! “Life is pretty good!” ✹ At our time in life, it’s not surprising that I’ve heard that our class is getting smaller. Richard Tardiff notified me that his father, Donald Tardiff, “passed away on December 15 of last year at the age of 97.” Also, Todd Sigety wrote, “My dad, Ernest Sigety, passed away peacefully in his sleep April 2, 2022, at home in Alexandria, Va. It was one month shy of his 98th birthday.” ✹ And so I come to the end of another column for the ’49ers. Please remember to send me news at any time for my ’49 file.\n\n’50\n\nColby Magazine\n\nclassnews1950@colby.edu\n\n’51\n\nFred Boyle\n\nclassnews1951@colby.edu\n\nAl Stone, now 94, is the grandfather of five Colby alumni. “I can report that they’re all prospering. Meanwhile, I’m privileged to still be allowed to go to work most days as one of their employees, which I consider my good fortune. Thanks to Colby, Harvard Business School, and the U.S. Navy, I’ve been blessed with good health, a long life, and nine additional grandchildren!” ✹ The Springvale Public Library honored Harland Eastman with the naming of its genealogy room as the Harland H. Eastman Room. Congratulations! Harland is a long-time trustee of the library and is also president of the Sanford-Springvale Historical Society, which dedicated a park next to its building as the Stephen Emery Eastman Park in memory of Hal’s late son. ✹ For me, Fred Boyle, 2022 brought many challenges. With the death of my wife, Barbara, in March, I moved into an apartment and sold our home of almost 40 years. My latest book, Early Families of Buxton, Maine, came out in June 2022. I’ve gotten in some traveling—Italy, PEI, Columbia River—and performed in a veteran’s show last November.\n\n’52\n\nArt White\n\nclassnews1952@colby.edu\n\nLouise Ginsberg Hirshberg lives in Exeter, N.H., and has become active in the game of pickleball. In fact, Louise writes that she is the senior New Hampshire pickleball champion! She also confesses that the competition at the senior level is thin. The competition may be thin, but I don’t think I’ll challenge Louise to a game! Louise visited Colby recently and is impressed with what the College and the town of Waterville have done together. ✹ Mary and I traveled to Charlottesville, Va., for my grandson’s wedding last fall. Four delightful days filled with festive events. We visited Monticello and were impressed with that magnificent estate. Our trip home began at 5:30 a.m. in Virginia, and we arrived in Bath, Maine, at 7:30 p.m. Mary and I rode in the back of the van the entire trip. Not bad for two mid-90 oldies! I was saddened to hear of the passing in April 2022 of my good friend and loyal Colby grad George “Lum” Lebherz. He was a very friendly, loyal, and contributing person. It was difficult to spend time with Lum and not smile. Happy spring to all our classmates. Let me know what is happening in your life for the next Colby publication.\n\n’53\n\nBarbara Easterbrooks Mailey\n\nclassnews1953@colby.edu\n\nWhat are classmates doing during these waning years? I heard from two of our loyal correspondents. Priscilla Eaton Billington sent me a note, saying she went to Massachusetts Eye and Ear last fall for a “thumbs-up” decision on having an implant in her ear. It would be a long process but could be done before she left for her Florida home in December. Her Colby daughter, Dianne (Billington Stronach ’75), enjoyed her Colby reunion but returned home with a Covid infection, despite having a fourth shot protection. ✹ It gives me a warm feeling to hear again from Carolyn English Caci. She said that having had a broken hip in January 2022 and then a broken wrist in June, she decided to move to the assisted-living section of Brooksby Village in July. Carolyn is learning to love her newest change in her way of living. ✹ I will add a final note from this correspondent. For all the avid readers, if you have not heard of Colby’s Thomas Savage ’40, you should try to find his novel Power of the Dog with “afterward” by another Colby writer/author, Annie Proulx ’57. She said that Dean Marriner told Savage that he could miss classes as long as he was writing! It seems that Dean Marriner saw in him a classic writer of the future.\n\n’54\n\nVic Scalise\n\nclassnews1954@colby.edu\n\nNancy Moyer Conover lives in Storrs, Conn., and is a big rooter for the UConn women’s basketball team. All the homes in her community have expansive front porches, which encourage conversations with passersby. (The poet Sam Foss wrote, “I want to live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man.”) Nancy’s three daughters, Betsy, Joanne, and Sally, and their families bring much joy to her life. Nancy traveled to Sweden last summer to visit the home of her maternal grandmother. Nancy concluded, “America is a country of emigrants, so I encourage everyone to look to their roots in the ‘old’ world and see where they take you.” ✹ Whitey Thurston sold his home in Penobscot, Maine, last August and moved permanently to Englewood, Fla. Whitey found traveling back and forth and maintaining two properties “became too much for me.” He said he would miss his summers in Maine but will always have fond memories of those delightful times. ✹ John Krusell phoned from his home in Kissimmee, Fla. He continues to live alone but appreciates the visits and support of his family. John was upbeat about life and retains an active mind. His love of reading remains one of his greatest pleasures. ✹ Tom Hunt and his wife, Susan (Miller ’56), celebrated their 66th year of marriage. It has been a 70-year relationship when including their going-together at Colby, which Susan is eager to count. Last Sept. 2, Tom began his 92nd year of life. He concluded, “These are big numbers, and we are grateful we’ve had a very good life together.” ✹ Art Eddy died Feb. 19, 2023. Art wrote a wonderful biography for our 50th Reunion book. He closed by saying, “Colby served me well, my memories are positive, and my life has been (and still is) completely due, in no small part, to what happened to me during my four years ‘on the hill.’” His daughter Sara wrote when he passed, “He was 90 and, until the last few months, lived a fully independent and active life, including playing as many rounds of golf as he could manage!” Art served as our class correspondent with distinction for nearly two decades. ✹ Sue Johnson flew for the first time since Covid. She traveled from her home in Virginia to visit her sister Nancy, who lives in Massachusetts. Sue continues her love of knitting, which she learned at Colby from Ginny Kane Hawrylycz, who recently passed away (see obituary section). Many of us were recipients of Sue’s beautiful socks. Sue is currently learning a new skill, playing the harp. She takes pride and great joy in her eight great-grandchildren. Sue also said in this time of life, she has a desire to grow closer to God and develop a greater awareness of “the other side.” ✹ Christine Henderson Harper left Colby after two years to marry. Yet, Chris is one of our most loyal and generous members of the Colby family. Currently living in Unionville, Ontario, Canada, Chris turned 90 in August. She enjoyed a family reunion and celebration of her birthday. She keeps busy by going to exercise class, knitting for a charitable group, doing work for a small firm, and reading a lot. ✹ Mary Mastin Campbell spoke of her longtime meaningful relationship with Betsy Powley Wallingford. She also remembered fondly Ned Shenton “as a quiet but strong presence.” She requested Mira Ptacin’s essay on Ned and has obtained his memoir. ✹ Ten of our ’54 classmates are Floridians: Carole Bullock Adams, Lakeland; Margaret “Peggy-Jane” Moore Blair, West Palm Beach; John Krusell, Kissimmee; Colby Thompson Lowe, Gainesville; Al Packard, Merritt Island; Mark Powley, Cape Coral; Jim Rapaport, Boca Raton; John Resler, Miami; Allen Sandler, Boca Raton; and Whitey Thurston, Englewood. Each person’s experience with Hurricane Ian was different depending on their location. Whitey Thurston said it most succinctly for all, “Survived Ian.” ✹ On a sad note, the beloved wife of Karl Dornish, Jane Millett Dornish ’55, died last October. She was the daughter of our much-loved alumni secretary Bill Millett. In Karl’s words, “Jane was a wonderful person, wife, and alumna.”\n\n’55\n\nBetty Harris Smith\n\nclassnews1955@colby.edu\n\nKay Hartwell Philipps commented that she enjoyed reading about David Ward’s research in our last column. Every summer Kay’s family spends a week together at Rockywold Deephaven Camps on Squam Lake, N.H. “I call it my spirit home. This year my husband and I planned to drive to Maine after Squam and visit the Colby Museum of Art. Unfortunately, age-related problems prevented this excursion.” Kay is curious if many alumni have visited the art museum. Have you? ✹ Speaking of David Ward, he reports that his 25 years of research on federal supermax prisons still garners attention. Last summer two producers from the History Channel interviewed David for a series on famous prisons, which was scheduled to air at the end of 2022. They spoke to David about his Alcatraz project and about the prison’s successor in Colorado, a project he worked on from 1994 to 2002. ✹ Peter French wrote in from Yonkers, where he lives in a castle known as Greystone Court with a view of the Hudson River. “When I was 84 and my wife, Marietta (Roberts ’57), had died, I decided to buy a castle in Yonkers that I fell in love with at first sight. Secretly, I think I always wanted to live in a castle. Everyone thought I was crazy to do it, including me. Now that I’ve lived another five years and lived here, I’m glad I did it. I’m hoping for at least another five. It’s been a good place to sit out the pandemic. Now that my children are running my business [French Color and Fragrance], I have time to work in a lab I set up in the basement to do what I learned at Colby: chemistry. I’m trying to make some new products for our salespeople to sell.”\n\n’56\n\nCharlene Roberts Riordan\n\nclassnews1956@colby.edu\n\nJoanna McCurdy Brunso wonders how many classmates are left. When she lived in upstate New York, several classmates would get together at someone’s house. She still hears from Lois Latimer Pan, Kathie Vogt, Cookie Allen, Yvonne “Vonnie” Noble Davies, and Heidi Pauly Lansing. Joanna lives in the Seattle area during the warm months and snowbirds in Green Valley, Ariz. Any classmates nearby? She dreams of travel: this year she will go to Atlanta for her oldest son’s retirement. ✹ Kathy McConaughy Zambello went to Colby last June for Saturday events during Reunion Weekend. Mary Ann Papalia Laccabue came from Tarzana, Calif., with her daughter and two grandsons. The Class Parade was led by a 98-year-old woman, JoJo Pitts McAlary ’44, who walked on her own. Mary Ann and Kathy followed; Kathy carried our class flag. They were the only Golden Mules in attendance at the luncheon afterward. The campus has changed so much: an enormous field house, dorms by Johnson Pond, rotaries, and pedestrian-only walkways. ✹ Brian Stompe works on getting single-payer health care in California and the U.S. He belongs to Sons in Retirement, which meets monthly and has speakers of general interest and a dozen interest groups: science, foreign affairs, military history, books, etc. He gets out around the Golden Gate in his Klamath boat for salmon and rockfish and Dungeness crabs in season. It was a slow salmon season north of the Golden Gate last year. ✹ Frank Huntress’s big thing was watching, with a gathering, the Queen’s funeral with its precision and timing. He shared that the funeral had been “practiced” over a five-year period to avoid “hitches and glitches.” However, he did notice two errors in the names of two clergy. He had planned to attend our reunion but an eye problem canceled that. His general health is good and he takes services in Marblehead. He compares President David Greene with our President Seelye Bixler in their idealism. He wishes to be remembered by our classmates for memory’s treasure of friendship and wonderful years “on the Hill.” ✹ Last summer’s highlight for Janet Nordgren Meryweather was her granddaughter’s wedding in New Mexico, an hour from Santa Fe. She stayed at the “Blame Her Ranch” for five days and slept in an air-conditioned Conestoga wagon with bathroom facilities outside. Before the wedding, they lost power and there wasn’t a generator. Thankfully, power was restored before the ceremony. Janet has recently dealt with colon cancer. She had surgery in Florida and chemo in Maine, and both procedures were easy with no side effects. She is a survivor of four melanomas and two breast surgeries. Her current CT scan shows her clean of colon cancer. She’s blessed by her wonderful team of physicians and maintains a positive attitude. In early December, she headed back to Nokomis, Fla., where her home was habitable except for lanai damage following Hurricane Ian. ✹ Covid has taken its toll on me, especially in New York City: no operas, museums, or Broadway. However, I visited Little (Lil) Island, my landscape-architecture grandson’s idea. It’s an artificial island park at Pier 55, and it’s impressive. Then, we walked the High Line. Last summer, with my granddaughter and another grandson, we walked over the Brooklyn Bridge. It was tiring but wonderful fun! Take care and be safe. Your correspondent, Robbi.\n\n’57\n\nDon Tracy\n\nclassnews1957@colby.edu\n\nMichaline “Mikki” Chomicz Mann feels lucky that despite our age, we’re able to enjoy our families, friends, and favorite activities. Her move to Wilmington, N.C., a few blocks from her daughter’s home, has been much easier than she thought. She misses everyone from up north but takes advantage of the internet. She’s now in an area with many interesting group activities and is close to the beach. She joined the Wilmington Choral Society and participated in its December concert. Last August she visited friends in Boston, which was a “delight. They drove me to Rhode Island for lunch with my granddaughter and to Worcester, my hometown. That’s something I have in common with President Greene since he grew up in Worcester.” This year she hopes to visit grandkids in Newport, Pittsburgh, Fort Worth, and Ithaca. ✹ Peter Hussey checked in from Kennebunkport, Maine. He and his wife, Kathryn, traveled in Europe over the past 20 or 30 years, with one trip to New Zealand, but the pandemic killed their chances for more trips overseas. They feel really grounded now. “Kathryn volunteers at the Brick Store Museum in Kennebunk and I hold down the fort, as the saying goes. I’m still on the board of directors of Hussey Seating Company, not far away in North Berwick. The company had a tough time with the pandemic with prices of steel and plywood going up fast while jobs already sold were on the books at lower prices,” writes Peter. He wants to visit Colby’s new Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center, which, of course, has Hussey Seating products throughout. “Must be a great improvement!” ✹ Annie Schimmelpfennig Laszlo shared two “long-remembered” quotes from her father-in-law: “The best exercise is a push from the dining room table,” and “You catch more flies with honey than vinegar.” She concluded: “I hope this brings a smile.” ✹ What a treat to hear from Annette Picher Houston, who has never sent in news before. After her husband, Ken Houston, died in 2009, she moved to Lebanon, N.H., to be near her daughter. She also has a musician son in Berkeley, Calif., and another son in Dover, N.H. “I spent my teaching life in central Maine, teaching art in Waterville and area schools, and then being the coordinator of a gifted program in Newport, Maine. As a member of Art Quilts Maine and the Newport Art Association, I exhibited with fellow artists in many shows with paintings and art quilts.” Annette lives in a senior community now and says she is blessed with good health. She keeps active as an art teacher in her community and continues to make small quilts to donate to servicemen and women through their VA hospital nearby. ✹ Eleanor Duckworth retired in 2013 from teaching at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. She still does some teaching, though, as well as some writing. She started dancing around 1993 and still does modern dance, performing with various groups, mostly in the Boston area. Eleanor lives in Cambridge, Mass., and spends summers in Québec. ✹ Lou and Bill Bois celebrated their 65th anniversary last summer with their two children (now senior citizens themselves), grandchildren, relatives, and friends at a fun party. Lou and Bill are “both reasonably well and able to maintain our home,” Bill writes. “I went to our 65th Colby reunion, one of only two of our class to attend. Colby is heavily involved in the efforts to revitalize downtown Waterville. Very impressive! The changes on the Hill are amazing.” ✹ As for me, Don Tracy, I’m still living in Rockport, Maine, and have a little energy to enjoy our coastal area and my family, half in Maine and the others in the Midwest and in Phoenix. My wife, Linda, and I have enjoyed Maine for more than 45 years. We enjoy our many children, who keep a close eye on us. Many within our family remain active in the preaching activities for which Jehovah’s Witnesses are well known. Linda and I enjoy letter writing to many in the area or those I’ve known over several years. I’ve been doing this for more than 60 years, having many precious memories for an “ol’ guy.”\n\n’58\n\nMary Ellen Chase Bridge\n\nclassnews1958@colby.edu\n\nPeter Vlachos still works full time as chief investment officer in a business managed by his daughter Zoe and his business partner. During the pandemic two years ago, he became chairman of the nonprofit Valissima Institute, which was “created to correct the wrong that has always existed in classical music: the systemic block to women becoming conductors and music directors of the world’s leading symphonic and opera orchestras.” It intends to accomplish this mission by training and mentoring outstanding young women musicians, 13-18-year-olds, in summer programs. The second program was held last August to outstanding acclaim. Peter promises to tell us more about this activity in upcoming columns. (Hooray! I’m always looking for more news.) ✹ Jane Gibbons traveled to Washington State last fall to help out her daughter. On her return, she decided to open her house in Sweden, Maine, near the White Mountains, as an Airbnb. If you’re traveling in her area, you might like to check out the location and attractions. ✹ Janice Klem Benicek is in touch with her roommate Peg Beebe Ramsay; in fact, their combined families (17 people) plan a cruise to Bermuda in June 2023. Janice enjoyed a trip to Cuba three years ago and thought such jaunts might be over, so she’s excited for the one upcoming. In other news, she has a new great-granddaughter who is lively and interested in everything and brings joy to her life. Janice’s hobbies include painting and reading lots of British mysteries. ✹ We two are going to compare notes on our reading: my latest British mysteries include the Elly Griffiths series (14-15 to date), featuring Ruth Galloway, an archaeologist in northern England (find the list online and be sure to start with the first, as they proceed chronologically); the series by Judith Flanders (four to date), featuring Samantha Clair, who works in a London publishing house; and the Richard Osman series about the Thursday Murder Club (maybe three to date?), a group of seniors in a retirement village in Kent who collaborate with the local police. What are the rest of you reading and doing? Are you still traveling? Do you have grandchildren or great-grandchildren you want to brag about? (My 18-year-old grandson is in Spain, training to perhaps become a professional soccer player.) I need to hear from more of you to keep this news column alive, so please help out when the next request comes your way.\n\n’59\n\nJoanne K. Woods\n\nclassnews1959@colby.edu\n\nFran and Boyd Sands celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary and live, in retirement, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. They enjoy the benefits of their large family—five children, 15 grandchildren, and 23+ great-grandchildren. ✹ Frank Seebode reports that he is “85 and still alive!” ✹ Ed Tomey and Maich Gardner have spent nearly four years in their independent-living apartment in a marvelous lifelong retirement community in Keene, N.H. They left their home on 25 acres, and Ed misses their extensive flower gardens as well as working the land with his tractor. Ed finally retired from organizational consulting and leadership coaching after nearly 50 years, receiving the title of professor emeritus when he retired after 30 years teaching at the Antioch University Graduate School in Keene. Music is still part of his life. He formed a trio last year: Ed is the vocalist, accompanied by a pianist and a bassist. About 90 percent of their concert repertoire can be found in The Great American Songbook of standards familiar to our ’50s Colby generation. Maich and Ed still engage in community work, including advocating for the homeless, striving for racial equality and inclusion, and promoting chamber music and human services nonprofit organizations. In their more limited life surroundings, it’s not as easy to gather their four kids, their spouses, and eight grandkids, but they’re getting more creative at it. ✹ Wendy (Ihlstrom ’61) and Bob Nielsen will celebrate their 62nd wedding anniversary this August. Both are fine, walking a little slower but doing well. They had made reservations for our 60th reunion but, unfortunately, had to cancel at the last minute. They live in East Lyme, Conn., and enjoy all that the shore has to offer. Their children live outside of New England, and they look forward to their summer visits with their families. Bob and Wendy planned to travel to Alexandria, Va., to see their daughter’s family and then in November to Scottsdale, Ariz., to celebrate Thanksgiving with their son and family. ✹ Jocelyn and Tom Connors moved to Arbor Acres, a “continuing care center,” which is across the street from where they lived in Winston-Salem. Karen (Beganny ’63) and Skeeter Megathlin spent the night with them the week they moved. Tom fought the move, but now that he’s there he’s enjoying it very much. They have a fabulous fitness center that has three pools, all sorts of workout equipment, fitness classes, etc, and a great library, so Tom is in hog heaven. They had a lot of friends there anyway but were surprised to find out that Tom’s twin brother’s four-year Yale roommate and his wife are also there. Tom and Jocelyn became great-grandparents last March of Katherine Martin Harder, their first great-grandchild. Tom has enjoyed seeing Colby sporting events on the web and was excited to see that Colby bought Allen and Benner islands from the Wyeth Foundation. His family used to visit the Maine coast from Connecticut in the summer, not too far from where those islands are located. ✹ Ed Goldberg spent four weeks in Vietnam last fall. Much of his time was spent in the northeast along the Chinese border. Aside from the indescribable beauty, he accidentally became involved with a group of retired military people who never had the opportunity to engage an American in an intimate way. It was an extraordinary moment filled with watery eyes, long hugs, and an exchange of gifts. Despite the language barrier, a thousand thoughts were exchanged without the spoken word. Ed was disappointed that no one showed up for the June reunion, which was a lost opportunity. Hopefully, the class can do better in the future. ✹ I hope all is well with everybody. I always enjoy hearing from you.\n\n60s newsmakers\n\nEddie Woodin ’69\n\nBasketball legend Ken Stone ’64 was inducted into the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame. When he graduated, Stone was the Mules’ career scoring leader with 1,500 points in just 74 games (20.3 points per game). He’s currently ninth on the scoring leaderboard. ♦ Maine’s Scarborough Land Trust named Eddie Woodin ’69 its first Conservationist of the Year. The trust said Woodin is a “spiritual and inspirational philanthropist who has championed many local causes, including Maine Audubon, Center for Wildlife, Boy Scouts of America, Southern Maine Agency on Aging, Friends of Casco Bay, and Scarborough Land Trust.” The State of Maine’s 130th Legislature extended its congratulations to Woodin on the award with an official recognition signed by the Speaker of the House and president of the Senate.\n\n’60\n\nJane Holden Huerta\n\nclassnews1960@colby.edu\n\nI went to our reunion in June and was disappointed that so few of us were able to attend. However, those of us who were there had a great time. Claudia Lawrence Rogers, Tony ’57 and Bev Jackson Glockler, Jock Knowles, Steve Curley, Ed Marchetti, and Phil Shea. And we talked to John Vollmer by phone, which was special for me as we went to high school together. We also spent time with members of the Class of ’61. Colby did a really great job handling the multiple reunions. One of the highlights for me was talking to a young woman who told me that she was only able to attend college because of the financial aid she received from Colby. Her family could not even afford to send her to any state college in Washington. Juan and I have managed to avoid Covid so far and are still wearing masks on airplanes, in supermarkets, and in large gatherings. Both of us continue to work part time, which seems to keep us feeling young! ✹ Jock Knowles has both good and bad news for us. The really good news is that he has been smitten by Betsy Perry Burke ’61, and they have been seeing a lot of each other. They now call themselves “partners.” The bad news is that he attended Dick Lucier’s funeral service. We will all miss Dick. Jock and Betsy had lunch with Ed Marchetti a while back. Ed had a redo on a knee and was hobbling a bit but still in rare form. Jock talks to Steve Curley often. Steve’s wife, Bryna, recently entered a nursing facility. ✹ Steve Curley was also disappointed that we didn’t have a bigger turnout for our reunion. His time with Phil Shea, Eddie Marchetti, and Jock Knowles was time well spent. His thoughts for all of us are to take care, be healthy, and above all, stay positive! ✹ Peg Jack Johnston moved from her home of 31 years to a condo two blocks away, just north of Denver’s beautiful Washington Park. She looked forward to making new friends. Covid had curtailed her travel, but she went to Philadelphia twice last year to be with family, to Houston for a Rotary convention, and to Maui in August with 14 family members: three sons and wives plus eight grandchildren. “Great fun!” This spring she planned to spend a week at her timeshare in Puerto Vallarta. She writes, “Many of my hours are spent on Rotary, fundraising for international programs and polio eradication, planning luncheon speakers, and socializing. I’ve been blessed with great health. Retirement is wonderful!” ✹ Pete Henderson has been dealing with the loss of his wife, Jane, who passed away three years ago. She died of lung cancer, which is doubly distressing since neither she nor Pete smoked. Pete is in good health in spite of turning 84. He has spent a lot of time visiting his two daughters, one in Tennessee and the other in Florida. Weekends are spent at his lake house, where he does a lot of canoeing. Pete is also writing a book that may or may not get finished, but it gives him a lot to think about and makes time go by faster. It’s about terrorists who devise a way to destroy Portland’s historic waterfront. How they are discovered and stopped makes up the rest of the story. ✹ Mike Silverberg agrees that we’re fortunate to have Steve Curley to hold our class together. “He is great.” Mike works at home three days a week, nothing like past years, but enough to keep his mind sharp. He continues to battle cancer and has been successful for about 10 years. He speaks with Hank Silverman ’61 and Dick Fields ’61 often. A close associate of Mike’s has a son in Colby’s Class of 2026. He loves Colby so far!\n\n’61\n\nDiane Scrafton Cohen Ferreira\n\nclassnews1961@colby.edu\n\nAloha, Class of ’61! Bravo to those who attended our 60th reunion, greeted by thunder, rain, and lightning. Those who braved storms to attend: Sandy Arens, Betsy Perry Burke, Class President Bob Burke, Bill Clough, Ginny Murphy Cragin, Denny Dionne, Mary Sawyer Bartlett, Sandy Nolet Quinlan, Scotty MacLeod Folger, Charlotte “CC” Clifton Lee, Gene Rainville, Quimby “Q” Robinson, Dave Tourangeau, and your correspondent. As newly initiated “Golden Mules,” we are now welcomed back to Colby every year as distinguished older alums. A big special thanks to Donna Burke, who served as “hostess with the most-est,” organizing the Woodman party headquarters and helping with everything that needed help. ✹ Immediately following our reunion, I met my sister Lee Scrafton Bujold ’64 for two days of family time in Weld, then flew to northwestern Montana for a weeklong indoor yoga spa, where the outside temperature was below 40 degrees with heavy snow the last two days, closing Glacier National Park … making the Maine experience look temperate by comparison! My next adventure was in Africa for most of November 2022 rafting on the Zambezi River and hiking on a safari in Botswana. The conclusion featured four days in Cape Town visiting wineries. Two vintners from Hawai’i were part of our small group of six. ✹ As a former correspondent, Penny Dietz Sullivan always shares a few words, assuring us. “Paul (Hill) and I are doing fine. He retired for the fourth (and last) time.” Penny keeps busy playing golf and bridge, serving on a board of concerts group, and as a judge in the midterm elections. “Have not seen or heard from anyone in a long time. Sorry to have missed the reunion. Hope all are staying healthy and busy.” ✹ Sandy Nolet Quinlan really enjoyed seeing Mary Sawyer Bartlett and others at the reunion. We shared memories during a brief sun experience in front of the tent on the Colby Green before leaving campus. Sandy reports, “having only attended Saturday late afternoon and Sunday brunch (because of a granddaughter’s high school graduation), I missed seeing other classmates who left early. Dean and I savor life. I continue to enjoy oil painting, I play occasional (frustrating) golf, and I cook, garden, entertain, and practice yoga. Yes, life is good!” ✹ Terence Lee (Terry, to fans of Colby Eight) reports he and Cathie celebrated 54 years of marriage and visited Mary (Mercer ’60) and Doug Riis in their beautiful home featuring a magnificent Asian arboretum out back. Doug and Terry sang with the Colby Eight—attendees of past reunion dinners will remember the special touch the “Retired Eight” added with smooth tones generating great memories. I’m humming “Mood Indigo” now! Both also sang with the Colby Concert Choir and the Colby Glee Club. Terry now sings with his church choir. Thank you, Doug and Terry, for sharing your talents so generously. ✹ Denny Dionne wrote a note of appreciation for this column! It was wonderful seeing both him and Gene Rainville again. ✹ Here’s Quimby Robinson’s message: “Enjoyed seeing and conversing with you all at our reunion. Good lobster rolls, too. I may be too old to remember what I may have learned about your lives, but it was nice hearing it and seeing that we’re still just elderly physical versions of our college selves. See you in five.” ✹ And finally, a note from Judy Dunnington Vollmer in Italy: “In the midst of Covid, I moved to Pietrasanta, Toscana, Italia, to be near my daughter, Vicki, who has a yoga studio here. I’m delighting in learning Italian and in becoming part of the community in this famous old city of art. Saluti a tutti!”\n\n’62\n\nNancy MacKenzie Keating\n\nPat Farnham Russell Cole\n\nclassnews1962@colby.edu\n\nGreetings, Class of ’62! Kudos to Judy Hoagland Bristol for her brilliant “steering” of our class at our reunion last year. Numerous events took place because of her abilities and her energy. Judy roomed with Roey Carbino, finally deciding that dorm life might not be really exciting for 80-year-old women. Judy wrote that of the three classes that were grouped, ’62’s was the largest. The Class of ’62 reunion began with a brisk wind and a cool temperature followed by the wonderful warmth of old friendships. At the check-in, Michael (McCabe) and I (Nancy McKenzie Keating) encountered John McHale. He traveled all the way from Colorado to “get a taste” of his alma mater. He told us a little about his illnesses, maybe because Michael shared his own. ✹ Jay Webster and his wife, Diane, attended reunion with Peter Leofanti, Doug Mulcahy, and Doug’s friend, Liz, staying at a cottage in Belgrade Lakes. They explored some of the newer facilities on campus, and Jay remarked particularly about the “first-class pool,” the hockey rink, and the basketball court in the new athletics center. Jay also mentioned the Andrew Wyeth exhibition at the Colby Museum of Art, saying, “Clearly, Colby is no doubt first class in all manners.” Jay and Diane feel fortunate to still enjoy skiing, snowshoeing, sailing, kayaking, and swimming. They attend concerts and such, and the four family weddings were “the highlight of this past summer.” ✹ Peter Duggan made a 1,700-mile trek from Naples, Fla., to Phippsburg, Maine, for a seven-week vacation in wonderful Colby country. While there, he had four delicious meals at Linda and Bruce Marshall’s home (his next-door neighbor) and one with Nancy and Whit Coombs, whom he hadn’t seen in decades. Peter said the Marshalls and the Coombs made a trip to campus and were “impressed” with the athletic complex and new soccer field. (Whit and Peter played on the Colby undefeated soccer team their junior year.) Peter worked out at the Bath Y last year next to Ann Tolan ’23, a Colby varsity swimmer. ✹ Nancy Rowe Adams, Judy Cronk Liberty, and Annie Ticknor McNeece met up for a happy day in Gloucester, Mass., last fall. Nancy said it was a great time and something they should do more often. Don’t we all say that? Nancy and Nancy McKenzie Keating reminisced about living at Colby in a room with three that was meant for two. Those were the days! ✹ Michael (McCabe) and I (Nancy McKenzie Keating) had a difficult year in 2022, but a good one after all. One day, Michael touched his neck and said, “Can you feel something here?” I did. That bump turned into a year and more of treatment with about four doctors and dozens of nurses (the best!) and daily trips to Brunswick and Bath for things I couldn’t spell. On a snowy day, Michael called to let me know that he had an accident. The truck was halfway up a hill, stuck in the trees. What did he do? He called me. I went to him in my car, left the truck where it was … and we went off to Bath for a treatment. There was no question that the treatment was more important. Since then, he’s had a long recovery, but a good one. Every day has been better. ✹ Ann Tracy sent a copy of her newest book, Rivets and the Heart’s Attachments, to Pam Taylor. Pam said, “It is just wonderful. It’s about family and sibling love.” Find it on Amazon. Pam spends April-October in Forest City, Maine. Other summer residents she sees frequently are Forrest ’56 and Ann Jefferson Barnes ’57, Barbara McGillicuddy Bolton ’65, and Bruce Snow ’64. ✹ Pat Farnham Russell Cole had a nice phone visit last fall with Jimmy Johnson, who had sad news to report. His good friend Connie Fournier passed away Sept. 15, 2022. ✹ Our best to all of you.\n\n’63\n\nPaule French\n\nclassnews1963@colby.edu\n\nAnne Quirion Connaughton continues to garden “with beasts of various species eager to partake of the harvest.” All is well with her, son Jacques, and daughter Marie-Noelle. ✹ Bill ’62 and Barb Haines Chase spent two weeks in Friendship, Maine, with sailboat in tow and with granddaughter Dierdre O’Rourke ’25, a sophomore at Colby. Barb and Dian Emerson Sparling had a fun chat when Dian was visiting Judy Thompson Chandler in Bangor. Bill and Barb see Don and Mary Michelmore Hayes often, as they live in Concord, N.H. ✹ Family and friends gathered to celebrate the life of Sally Morse Preston’s husband, John, who died last December. ✹ Gayle and Byron Petrakis celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary on a vacation in Ireland last September. Their first overseas trip since 2019 was “well worth the wait!” ✹ George Swasey wrote of a wonderful 80th birthday trip to Manhattan with daughter Anne and her family. Dinner at his favorite restaurant, drinks overlooking Chelsea, a visit to Little Island, and Fika at the Whitney Museum. “Sometimes getting old is fun!” ✹ Jody Spear has been revisiting Mozart’s Great Mass in C minor, which she’s sung many times and would have liked to perform in August at the Voces8 British summer festival in Milton Abbey, Dorset. “Singing Haydn’s Creation Mass there in 2019 was a milestone event, along with crossing on the Queen Mary (a far cry from the Sylvania in 1961-62, for junior year abroad).” ✹ Nancy (Godley ’65) and John Wilson attended Colby class reunions last summer and caught up with former classmates. John is still singing with the Bagaduce Chorale and making hand-crafted wooden fishing lures, and Nancy is active in church and community activities on Deer Isle and Blue Hill. They’re planning to move back to western Massachusetts within the year to be closer to their son, Seth, and family. ✹ Honolulu continues to be home for Ken Robbins, although his sons and family are in Oregon and Texas. He’s still practicing law full time and has fit in traveling to Florence, Umbria, Istanbul, Athens, and the Aegean islands. Recently, he saw Tom Jones at a Van Morrison concert and was inspired by the 82-year-old Jones’s performance! ✹ John and Marsha Palmer Reynolds continue to practice and perform with their handbell group. Marsha’s grandniece returned to Colby for her second year. She loves it there and is doing so well both academically and athletically (swim team). They visited her last fall and went to the Colby Museum to see the Wyeth and Alex Katz exhibitions. ✹ Bonnie Brown Potter organized a gathering at the beautiful Maine home of Dick ’62 and Joan Dignam Schmaltz. Buck ’62 and Nat Gates Lawton, Pen Williamson and Bev, Ned Platner, Jane Melanson Dahmen, and I enjoyed a lobster dinner with lots of catching up and laughter. Al Carville and Linda were with us in spirit from Florida! ✹ Thanks to a birthday trip from her daughter, Pauline “Pi” Ryder Kezer visited Dorking, England, birthplace of her eighth great-grandmother, Priscilla Mullins Alden. Pi heads the Alden Kindred Historic Site in Duxbury, Mass., and is working on “twinning” Duxbury with Dorking. She visited the building where Priscilla Alden was born in 1604 and imagined how she survived her trip on the Mayflower. Pi’s pilgrimage was fulfilled! ✹ Sandra “Sam” Moulton Burridge has rejoined a choir associated with the twin town Oxford of Leiden in the Netherlands, and they “exchanged concerts, which meant travel!” Gardening and domesticity are foremost in these post-pandemic times. ✹ Whit Bond and Faith will be moving to southern Maine in the near future. Faith (Fuller Wilcox) has written an award-winning book, Hope is a Bright Star: A Mother’s Memoir of Love, Loss, and Learning to Live Again. Both heart-wrenching and heart-warming, it’s beautifully written and a must-read.\n\n’64\n\nMarcia Phillips Sheldon\n\nclassnews1964@colby.edu\n\nDick Friary retired in Montana after a long career as a Ph.D. medicinal chemist. He’s the owner of 25 U.S. patents and the author of two books and 32 chemistry papers. Highlights of his life include having a Colby student as an intern in his laboratory for two summers and being invited to present a lecture to the Colby Chemistry Department. ✹ After 50 years working in tax and finance, John Bush is leaving his position as director of tax and fiscal reform at the International Lawyers Project, a small UK-based charity that provides legal services to developing countries. He and his wife split their time between New Castle, N.H., and Manhattan. They recently had dinner with Nancy (Greer ’65) and Andy Weiland. ✹ Sally Berry Dixon enjoys her new home and art studio in Kennebunk. She’s happy to be back in Maine and is interested in finding a Colby group in her new surroundings, including Portland. ✹ Gloria Shepherd, usually a frequent traveler, is slowly returning to socializing but not yet taking trips. Covid-19 has kept her from traveling but she has plans to do so in the next few months. ✹ Robbie (Gilson ’65) and Bob Drewes are retired and live in Provo, Utah. Their main focus is their family. Bob applauds the continuous improvements by the Colby administration. ✹ Zooming around hilly central New York, Louise Brown Smith and her husband are enjoying their new electric-assist bicycles. They heat their house with wood but use a gas-powered wood splitter and are looking for easier ways to get the maple sap down from their woods. Louise has kept in touch with Sue Sawyer McAlary and with Becky and John Oakes, and she enjoys family, friends, books, cycling, outdoor chores, exploring, conversations, and equity and peace work. ✹ Jonathan Allen values his broad liberal arts education from Colby, with an emphasis on ethical and intellectual growth. Jonathan earned an M.S. and a Ph.D. in applied physics, both with a parallel curriculum in environmental science. In retirement, he volunteers at the Mercer County (New Jersey) science fair and works at the Sarnoff-RCA Museum. Jonathan and his wife recently became grandparents! ✹ Still a full-time professor, Jerry Shapiro teaches psychotherapy to graduate students at Santa Clara University, Calif. Jerry recently published a memoir, An Acquired Taste: Lifelong Optimism, Skepticism, and Darn Good Luck. He continues to write and visit grandchildren. ✹ Larry Dyhrberg is recovering from significant back surgery but is looking forward to being back on the golf course. He’s home with the family dog, who sleeps while Larry cooks, reads, and writes. Maybe he’ll publish a novella-length piece based on a boy growing up in a 1950s Maine mill town?! ✹ Linda Spear Elwell recently attended four family weddings, in New England and in Kentucky. She and her husband spent three months at a beach house in Wells, Maine. Two grandsons are graduating soon, from business college and the University of Louisville. ✹ Richard Larschan is expecting a new grandson! After summering in Westport, Mass., Richard is back teaching a course at the 92nd St. Y in New York City: Women Writers of the Harlem Renaissance. ✹ Jim Harris is on the board of the Pacific Northwest Writers Association, having spent the bulk of his work life in the book publishing field. Jim is looking forward to our 60th reunion in June 2024 and hopes to see everyone there. ✹ Judy Milner Coche Anderson has retired to Haddonfield, N.J., after many years of clinical practice and teaching colleagues, and of extensive writing in the area of clinical psychology. She stays active with walking and fitness classes, caring for two Italian water dogs, and visiting with grown children and two granddaughters. ✹ Stephen Brudno has resorted to online chess and Scrabble tournaments due to Covid concerns. He had been participating in live events ever since being at Colby. Recently, Steve “had to say goodbye to a long-time family member”: his 1970 Chevrolet. After five replaced engines, rust from New England weather couldn’t be removed any longer.\n\n’65\n\nJay Gronlund\n\nclassnews1965@colby.edu\n\nDespite lingering Covid risks and erratic weather, our 55th reunion attracted a solid core of classmates. John Cornell had to cancel his pre-reunion party due to Covid but rallied to attend on Saturday. Instead, Betsy Stevens Palmer hosted a “pre-mini-reunion” gathering at her house in Nobleboro, Maine. Betsy continues her success in the art world, exhibiting in shows in Boothbay, Damariscotta, Rockland, and even NYC (international internet art show). ✹ Congrats to Harold Kowal, who received a Colby Brick award at reunion. ✹ Travel seems to be back. Rick and Nancy Winslow Harwood missed our reunion because they were on a safari in Zimbabwe. They went to Morocco in October and planned to visit Egypt and Jordan in January, along with Sunny Coady. Sunny transformed our June reunion into a family affair, with her siblings Brad ’67, Jeff ’69, and Shelby ’72 all joining her. Sunny stays in touch with George Hooker, who overcame some health challenges to help celebrate his daughter’s 50th birthday in October, a “multi-day extravaganza,” in Thailand. ✹ Ken Gray missed reunion due to medical issues but is getting the best treatment available. ✹ Margo Beach recently became a great-grandmother!✹ Bruce Davey is involved in community activities in Minnesota and fondly remembers his hockey years at Colby. ✹ Jim Foritano reads poetry that “chimes with the theme of his friend’s music on the piano” around Boston, plus books “his professors said he won’t understand.” ✹ Callie Holmes Marsh and her husband enjoy independent living at a senior life-care residence in Iowa. They summer on Gotts Island in Maine. ✹ Joan Stressenger Chesley lives in Vero Beach, Fla., but often travels in the Northeast visiting her son in NH and daughters in VT and VA. Joan still works as a real estate broker. ✹ Lew Krinsky continues to be “amazed at all the progress at Colby.” ✹ John ’63 and Nancy Godley Wilson remain very active with community organizations in Deer Isle and Blue Hill Peninsula, Maine. Instead of traveling abroad during Covid, their sons and grandkids visited often in the summer, but now they are getting ready for more cruises. ✹ Norman Miner continues his acting “career” and is scheduled to play George Washington in July in Exeter, N.H. ✹ Rodney Gould still practices law but had time to visit a dude ranch and polar bears in Manitoba with his kids and grandkids. ✹ Pam Pierson Parziale is in West Virginia, where she and husband Ren own a pottery studio, Sycamore Pottery. They spend summers in Ferry Beach, Maine, with a son and granddaughter next door. She also sees Donna Brown Salisbury and Pat Campbell, who are close by. ✹ Bob Lewis summarized his 55 years since Colby with jobs in NATO, insurance, local governments, and consulting. He’s lived in NYC, Seattle, LA, and now Denver. ✹ Tom Donahue has spent the past 40 years teaching in LA, Texas, and now Michigan (Saginaw Valley State U). Tom remains active reading, painting, hiking, and traveling. ✹ Rick Spitzer confirmed how happy he is back in Massachusetts close to his family and relatives. ✹ Fortunately, there was minimal damage to our classmates’ homes in Florida from Hurricane Ian: Stan Garnett in a retirement community in St. Petersburg; David and Dale Rottner Hatch, plus neighbors Ann and Bud Marvin, who had their roof and lanais damaged; Allen Post and Randy Antik in Naples reported no damage, too. ✹ Jane Patterson Paxton in Hallowell, Maine, remains busy lecturing at a nearby college, playing bridge, reading, and gardening. ✹ Judy Turner Jones is now in Chappaqua, N.Y., with both children and grandchildren. She traveled to Florence, Bologna, and Venice last spring. ✹ Eliot Terborgh had a family reunion (13) in Yosemite in July and toured Iceland in August. ✹ Personally, I saw John Tewhey and Rick Davis on the Cape last summer. Rick and Gail had to cancel a tour to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic when Putin announced his nuclear threats. May-Lis and I went to the Galapagos in April 2022, then Sweden, Norway, and Estonia in late August to visit relatives. Our daughter and family joined us from London, too.\n\n’66\n\nBeth Adams Keene\n\nclassnews1966@colby.edu\n\nGreetings, Classmates! I enjoyed hearing from many of you last fall and was pleased to be able to send news via email at that time. I hope you found it as inspiring as I did to hear that so many classmates are still working and/or volunteering for important causes and purposes. Others are coping with serious illness or loss and yet finding the best in their situations. Several reflected upon ways they had found peace and fulfillment or coped with change. It certainly reaffirms our resilience, and it’s much appreciated that you shared these thoughts. ✹ In news received since that email, Peter Densen writes from Iowa City that he and his wife, Ellie, have felt fortunate to spend June–October on Mount Desert Island for the past few summers. In the small-world department, they’ve gotten together with Anne Ruggles Gere and husband Budge in Ann Arbor a few times over the years as their younger son, Brad, lives one block from Anne. Peter shared that John Cookson serves on the board of a lobster company in York, Maine. In mid-July John and his wife, Marilyn, met up with Peter and Ellie for dinner on the Portland Wharf. A fair share of oysters and lobster were washed down with Portland Pale Ale. ✹ Fran Finizio reports he lost his carport to Hurricane Ian at his home in Naples, Fla., but feels very fortunate the seven-foot storm surge stopped a mile from his home. ✹ The email did not include details of our delayed 55th/actual 56th reunion last June. We had a robust crowd of 17 classmates and six accompanying spouses. Fran Finizio and I arrived early enough on Thursday for the highly interesting Alumni College presentations from Colby faculty. The talk about the new Davis Institute for AI at Colby was fascinating and particularly relevant to the world we live in. We were joined on Thursday evening by Pete Anderson and wife Elena, George Cain, Tom Boghosian, Frank ’64 and Natalie Bowerman Zaremba, and Betty (Savicki ’68) and John “Daisy” Carvellas for a celebratory dinner at the Village Inn and Tavern on Belgrade Lake. Friday offered campus tours led by undergrad students—such fun to talk to them about their current Colby experiences. Those of us who visited the new Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center were wowed by this impressive facility that caters to both athletes and the entire Colby community. Friday night we hosted our own lively Class of ’66 cocktail party in Dana Hall and invited Class of ’65 and ’67 attendees as we were the only class from those years that had planned something. Arriving for that party were Deb Anglim Higgins, Erik Thorson and wife Rhonda, Dag Williamson, Budge and Anne Ruggles Gere, John ’65 and Gretchen Wollam O’Connor, Ellie Caito Thompson, Marty Walker Marchut, and Peter Grabosky all the way from Australia. A huge thanks to Pat Berg Currier, who organized both our reunion headquarters and the party so successfully. Many of you are familiar with the traditional Class Parade and Vacationland Luncheon that happen on Saturday of Reunion Weekend. The difference is that now, as we walk, we receive the applause of the crowd honoring the elderly for still attending—haha! It was great fun. Our class dinner on Saturday night included a Colby Mule mug as a favor and an unanticipated but greatly enjoyed song by Erik Thorson sung to his wife, Rhonda. Later, some of us, including Deb Anglim Higgins, George Cain, and Pete Wagner, proved we can still party like undergrads by rocking under the big tent to a great local band. ✹ Please contact me or Pat Berg Currier if you did not receive the emailed Class of ’66 newsletter last fall so that we can send you a printed copy or update your email address. Also, contact us if you have any suggestions for our 60th reunion in 2026.\n\n’67\n\nBob Gracia\n\nclassnews1967@colby.edu\n\nChris and JJ Tillinghast Sinton traveled to Venice, Italy, and enjoyed the wonderful architecture, sights, food, and perfect weather! They spent most of the summer in Stonington, Conn., and headed south to Vero Beach for the winter. They very much enjoyed the 55th reunion at Colby last June. ✹ Speaking of reunions, Vero Beach is an off-campus meeting spot for Mules. Kurt Swenson also spends the nasty months there. Kurt was unable to attend our most recent reunion because he’s busy, very busy, attending his grandchildren’s athletic events. This brings Kurt great joy, and he’s thankful to be part of the unfolding of the generations. And yes, if you were wondering, Kurt does get together with JJ and Chris in Vero Beach. ✹ Clemence Ravacon Mershon runs a 100-acre farm in northwest Pennsylvania. Her husband died recently, and the farm never ceases to demand care and attention. Her son offers assistance that is greatly appreciated, and her family helps to raise produce, tend to the chickens, harvest potatoes, etc. Clemence has retired from all other endeavors but continues, however, to serve on many Quaker committees via Zoom. Clemence hopes to visit a revitalized Waterville before her great-niece, a sophomore, graduates from our alma mater. ✹ Sandy Miller was among the dedicated cadre attending the reunion, and as a reward for her loyalty, she and Patty Whittemore Jenkins have been appointed co-presidents for our 60th. President-for-Life Irv Faunce claims that he won the nomination, and a court battle is to follow. On a more serious note, Sandy spent much of her summer in the Maryland woods on Antietam Creek and then returned to the Quincy section of Wollaston on the shores of Quincy Bay. Sandy is partial to waterfronts. ✹ I see that Rick Sadowski lives in Venice, Fla., and I can only wonder how he fared in the terrible storm that swept that part of the state last October. Rick reported that he attended the funeral of his former wife, Penny Fertel. Our thoughts are with the family. ✹ Alice Hubert Gardner used her pandemic lockdown time very well as she completed 46 paintings for a book about what to do in Gloucester, Mass. She worked with her granddaughter, and they meet via Zoom several times a week. ✹ Regular readers of this column might recall that Ken Ingram has moved about the hemispheres, north and south, for some time as if he were on the lam. Perhaps the statute of limitations has run out. Ken has settled, for now, in Maine as he works restoring a classic Bristol sailboat. Ken attended the 55th and spent time with Tony Wilkins and Dag Williamson. ✹ Bob Field has produced documentaries for many years and continues his work on a variety of topics, including national parks, national historic trails, and the Buffalo Soldiers. He currently is working on a project about prisoners of war from Vietnam. He recently had lunch with Fran Richter Comstock in Grantham, N.H. ✹ This reminds me that I had dinner with Dave Aronson recently, and it will come as no surprise to those who know Dave, but he’s playing baseball in an over-50 league. Dave is 27 years over 50. He didn’t pitch this summer due to a shoulder problem, but he played first base and didn’t miss a game. Tom Brady, are you paying attention? ✹ Linda (Mitchell ’66) and Lee Potter had to return early from a cruise along the Maine coast cut short by a nasty storm in September that took aim at Nova Scotia. Nonetheless, they enjoyed the voyage and are now comfortable at their residence in New Hampshire. ✹ Martin Gliserman and his wife spent last summer on Islesboro as they have for the last 30 years. Martin celebrated his 50th year on the faculty at Rutgers, and his book on neurology and cultural transmission will be published soon. ✹ Chris Balsley ’68 lets us know that Bob “Guppy” Goldstein died unexpectedly Dec. 14, 2022. He was living in Vero Beach, Fla., where he moved after retiring from a career as a lawyer. Read his obituary and other classmates’ in the back pages of this magazine.\n\n’68\n\nLynne Oakes Camp\n\nclassnews1968@colby.edu\n\nBob Grossman still practices law in Rochester, N.Y., but finds time for long bike rides. He spends most of the winter in Longboat Key, Fla., where he keeps meeting Colby folks on his biking journeys or on shopping trips to Publix, seeing Paul Cronin ’67 and his wife. ✹ Ken Hoadley and his wife, Leana, continue to enjoy life as retirees in beautiful Costa Rica, with trips to the States to visit family. He keeps busy as a board member of two local nonprofits: TeenSmart International and Semilla Nueva. They also enjoy their garden and orchard, where they produce coffee, bananas, avocados, mangos, and a variety of citrus fruits. ✹ Skip Fucillo and wife Linda enjoyed getting together last spring in Naples, Fla., with Peter Frizzell and wife Linda, Gerald Ogus and wife Christine, and Joe Boulos. They also visited with Martha (Luce ’70) and Rich Habeshian in Maine. They have completed their family circus by adding two English creme golden retrievers, “Barnum and Bailey.” ✹ Phil Johnson and wife Brenda celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary last September with family and friends, including classmates Peter Roy and his wife, Jane, and Dave Lanman. ✹ Al Gray and wife Donna have moved into their condo in Litchfield, Conn., and see a lot of son Chris and his family, wife Kara and daughters Avery, 8, and Addison, 7. Their oldest daughter, Erin, visited from California, and daughter Julie also visited from Wilmington, N.C., along with her son MJ, 3 1/2. Al and Donna continue to work full time remotely. ✹ Clarke Keenan reports that Cathie Smith Keenan has been battling long-term Lyme disease for the past year and that she is greatly limited. Clarke is her caretaker, and Cathie takes many medicines, integrated antibiotics, supplements, tinctures, and probiotics. ✹ Ted Allison’s son, a yacht captain, got a contract to deliver a 54-foot catamaran from the south coast of France to St. Thomas in the Caribbean. Their other son also came, and the whole family got to sail across the Atlantic Ocean together. They put into Spain, Gibraltar, the Canaries, and the Cape Verdes. Ted’s motorcycle riding continues with his annual ride to hook up with the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club of Wyoming. He’s been hanging out with Carolyn for some 50 years now! Life is good! ✹ Pat McCormack and wife Linda retired from teaching and are traveling to celebrate. In 2022 they visited Antigua, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Spain, Morocco, the Grenadines, St. Maarten, and St. Barthelemy. In 2023 they plan to visit Costa Rica with family before heading to Tahiti, Raiatea, Moorea, and Rangiroa, finishing off with a cruise on the Douro. ✹ Steve Ford and wife Mary fared well during the pandemic. Their annual family reunions in Maine continued each summer and were attended by all five children, spouses, and 13 grandchildren. Their travels resumed in earnest in October 2021 with a river cruise in Bordeaux, a Barcelona-to-Bergen ocean cruise in June 2022, and a river cruise through Eastern Europe in October 2022. ✹ Betty Savicki Carvellas wrote from St. Augustine, Fla., where they do the weekly BOGO buying at the grocery store. This year, however, they’re telling people they got cardiology BOGOs. John ’66 was in the ER just before they left Vermont and was diagnosed with atrial flutter. Betty was in the ER in Florida exactly a week later and diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Both saw the cardiologist the same day and had stress tests the same day. Maybe a little too much togetherness, even after 52 years! They visited Colby last June for John’s delayed 55th reunion and were once again amazed at what President Greene has done. While there, she met Margie Reed McLaughlin for coffee, and they had a great time catching up.\n\n’69\n\nRay Gerbi\n\nclassnews1969@colby.edu\n\nGreetings, classmates! It was nice to hear from so many of you, and I hope you are all well. ✹ Chris Christensen took delivery of electric snow-melt mats so he didn’t plan to do much snow shoveling this year. He got together with some mutual friends, flew to Portland, where they picked up TDP roommate Charlie Miller, then flew to Brunswick, Maine, for lunch and catching-up time. They hoped to have Ed Beard join them, but Ed was in Colorado visiting Peter Shearston. In February Peter retired as an IT program lead with the Missile Defense Agency and since then has been “trying to figure out what this retirement gig is all about.” During Peter and Patti’s visit with Meg and Ed Beard, they drove to the top of Pikes Peak and also attended the Air Force Academy Falcons-Nevada Wolfpack football game. Ed and Meg then headed north to Estes Park and Peter and Patti to the Bryce Canyon area. They planned to travel to Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina this spring, then visit Scotland and England in June. Peter hopes you have had an opportunity to view the slideshow he created of our 50th Reunion. If you have not received it, please let me know. ✹ Warren Heller retired from his solo law practice last September, and he and Debbie now spend weekends going to their grandson’s hockey games. Last winter they followed him to a national tournament in Buffalo, N.Y., and last summer to the Portland, Maine, area for a “summer bash.” They also enjoy following their granddaughter, a sophomore dance major at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee College. Warren and Debbie visited Peter ’70 and Linda Marsh Foss ’70 and keep in contact with Linda Loring Shea ’70, Walter Cotter ’70, and Connie Tingle Grabowy. ✹ Last year, 2021-22, was a very difficult year for Bill ’66 and Cathy Cyr Latvis. They experienced significant family losses and sold their “sweet lake house” in Gardiner. They resided in Dayton, Maine, for the summer and headed back to Florida in September. They visited Colby’s Museum of Art and toured the new Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center, ending their afternoon with a lovely meal at Front + Main, Colby’s new restaurant in the Lockwood Hotel. Plans were for a trip to Disney in November with their son and his family and a trip to Portugal in March. Cathy missed her get-togethers with Colby friends, but did connect with Kristina Faber for lunch in Waterville. ✹ Judy and Gary Austin saw last summer begin with high school graduations of three grandchildren. One joined his brother at the University of Alabama, one flew off to La Rouche University in Marbella, Spain, to study hospitality management, and the other started at a community college. The rest of the summer was traveling to the Canadian Rockies on a Rocky Mountaineer train trip, spending a week in London with grandkids, and a three-week trip to the Dolomite area in Italy. Last fall, they headed out for a 15-day Mississippi River cruise. ✹ Cynde and Steve Fisher saw the arrival of their seventh grandchild, the first for one of Steve’s own two children. They are very happy to finally have one living pretty close after all their jaunts to NYC and London. ✹ Eddie Woodin was the first recipient of the Scarborough Land Trust Conservationist Award. Congratulations, Eddie! ✹ Dwight Parsons retired six years ago and spent several years visiting family and fly-fishing. He and his son Dwight B. went to Montana/Idaho/Yellowstone for two weeks for more fishing. One highlight was a 1,300-foot descent into Cardiac Canyon on the Henry’s Fork of the Snake River at about a 45-degree angle. Dwight thinks it’s the last time he’ll be able to do that. They spent Christmas 2021 with his sister’s family in San Mateo, Calif. ✹ Best wishes to everyone! ✹ Editor’s note: Colby Magazine received news that Ray Gerbi died suddenly and unexpectedly April 23, 2023, at his home in Brunswick, Maine.

Over 100 had preregistered. We spent Wednesday afternoon touring Peak’s Island and had a private dinner there. We traveled to Waterville for three days with Alumni College lectures among them, learning how artificial intelligence is woven into so many liberal arts courses and how Colby is a leader among colleges committed to AI. We socialized, ate, drank, laughed, cried, and listened to our comfort music in the background. There were many first-time attendees. People attended from all over the country, although Covid prevented some from attending. Fortunately, Andy and Sandy Holler Hayashi as well as Dan Timmons were able to attend from Canada. Thanks to all others who attended and to those who contributed their time to make the events so meaningful. ✹ Jane Stinchfield Sexton and her husband spent six weeks traveling from Maine to Seattle and then back home. The last stop was Dover, Del., which made all 50 states for Jane. In June Jane was elected as a trustee to the Portland Water District. ✹ Jeff Lovitz did not attend the reunion. Instead, they celebrated their 50th anniversary with their four kids and grandkids on a cruise out of Camden harbor. They have been speaking with Roman Dashawetz, who has been active for more than 20 years organizing medical missions to Ukraine. Most recently he’s been putting together emergency backpacks for the Ukrainian army. ✹ Wallace and Mona Burnett Tapia celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a family party in Stowe, Vt., in May 2022, hosted by their two daughters and other family members. Wallace is almost fully retired from his CPA practice, and Mona retired from a 25-year elementary school teaching career a few years ago. They look forward to resuming traveling again soon. ✹ Mike Self was planning to attend reunion but tried hard to cut his finger off while splitting firewood so was unable to come. Mike spends a lot of time splitting, bundling, and selling firewood, money for a college fund for two of his grandsons in elementary school. ✹ Debbie Anderson very much enjoyed attending our 50th Reunion, visiting with many classmates, and taking a swim in the new pool. She and her husband have two fun and entertaining grandsons, 18 months and almost 1. One daughter lives next door with her husband and son. They are fortunate to have the other family also nearby in Seattle. They had a busy summer hiking in the Cascades, kayaking off the BC coast, and spending a week in Yoho and Banff national parks hiking. They had several long weekends with the family on Cape Cod and also in the San Juan Islands. ✹ Norma Rivero de Biermeyer has been married to Herbert for 46 years, and they have two grandkids living in Spain. Norma missed reunion due to residency requirements from Germany and the EU, which oblige them to reside in the EU for six months and one day. She still likes living in Caracas, Venezuela, despite the current 10-percent inflation rate. Their apartment is high, and they live without air conditioning or heat year-round, in a very nice humid rainforest climate. ✹ Bill Aldrich cites several memorable moments from reunion: random “bouts” of rain until Sunday, the small ceremony the class had in the chapel for those who have predeceased, and marveling that the gym that was being built when we were incoming freshmen cost $2 million or so, and the new gym complex cost $240 million. ✹ Thomas Whidden received the National Maritime Historical Society Distinguished Service Award for his outstanding contributions to yachting and his leadership in the design and manufacturing of technologically advanced sails and sailcloth. ✹ Now a request from me. I have been the class correspondent since 2010 and would like to pass this duty on to someone else who would enthusiastically take on this responsibility. Send a note if you’re interested.\n\n’71\n\nAnn E. Miller\n\nclassnews1971@colby.edu\n\nYou must see the very first response I received for this column, asking for memories from our 50th Reunion. Dave Williams said, “My very favorite memory was when, at 10 p.m., Ann Miller headed down to the big dance tent by herself in a complete downpour! After seeing that, we had to head down ourselves!” I laughed out loud at this memory, and I hope you will, too. It’s totally true. We had such a fantastic weekend for reunion. For those who were not there, you missed a great time. It was absolutely wonderful to have three reunion classes (’70, ’71, and ’72) all together, especially since we know so many people in other classes. Thank you, Colby, for doing that; we know it was a logistical nightmare, but so worth it for us. ✹ In December 2021 Rich Abramson sent a lengthy and newsy note but missed the deadline for submission. He reported then that he was recovering from a total reverse shoulder replacement and was doing well. The second one was in November 2022. He’s been appointed to the Maine State Museum Commission; Earl Smith is also on the commission. Rich serves on his homeowners’ association, and he’s also served as education director for Day One, a Maine-based substance abuse/mental health agency. He’s also one of the Portland event staffers ushering at Merrill Auditorium. He’s stayed in touch with former President Bro Adams and his wife, Lauren. ✹ Debbie Wentworth Lansing returned in October to her home in Florida after their exile in Tennessee avoiding Hurricane Ian. Fortunately, they encountered only some tree debris. She missed reunion because of a long-delayed trip to Lake Como. Back in Florida, she’s now a research contractor for the Mayflower Society revising the William White Silver Book. ✹ This response about reunion also made me laugh, from Sarah Hall Gibson: “… I had a great time and am looking forward to the 75th!” And she meant that! We aged quickly! She traveled with her sister to the Grand Tetons, where she enjoyed incredible scenery. ✹ Chip Altholz and his wife bought a 33-foot RV and headed to Arizona for the winter, where they planned to connect with Dave Nelson and other friends. Chip is still producing music and had an album coming out in January called Handheld with Rough Edges by Anonymous 17. ✹ Thanks to Linda Wallace (and her husband, George) for all the hard work and preparation for our 50th Reunion—fantastic job! Linda writes that reunion was fabulous and tiring. Huh? Really? You were tired, Linda? (She slept for a week!) Seriously, she did a wonderful job with film clips and photos. She also said that she hopes to see us in “4 HOURS”… for our 55th. Time flies. She and George met up with Larie Trippet last fall. In February Larie, Jerome Layman, and Linda and George met up in Florida. Linda and George were scheduled to visit Egypt last November. ✹ Unable to come to our reunion because his daughter was getting married, Joe Greenman writes that he’s expecting his first grandchild. ✹ Leslie Anderson sent a long, newsy note. She enjoyed reunion in unexpected ways: she was blown away by the talk at the Legacy Society brunch (by Randi Arsenault Maloney ’09); the Colby students driving golf carts all over for us and giving tours—incredible ambassadors for the College; the tour of the new athletic center and the data point that students actually USE the facility; and the self-guided tour of downtown. She’s proud to be affiliated with this amazing institution (me, too!). She went back to Waterville last fall, and then she painted again for three shows in Portland, Maine. ✹ Mike Smith said it was great to see his Deke brothers at reunion: Bob Ewell, Paul Spiess, Ed Mahoney ’72, and Steve Self ’72.\n\n’72\n\nNancy Round Haley\n\nclassnews1972@colby.edu\n\nOur 50th Reunion was an awesome experience! I shared a suite at the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons (downtown) with Janet Veasey McLetchie, Norma Ouellet O’Reilly, and Stina Reed. It was wonderful! ✹ Susan Hoy Terrio attended, and one of her best moments was literally bumping into her Colby roommate Jamie Aronow O’Heir. They had lost touch over the years and had a wonderful time catching up. (That’s the best part of reunions!) ✹ Marilyn McDougal Meyerhans attended with her former roommate Susan Buttner Lavelle. They spent three days catching up. Marilyn still grows apples and vegetables in central Maine, supplying local stores and even Colby. ✹ Sally Chester Williford and Joyce Bemak Hanes didn’t make it to reunion, but they celebrated 54 years of friendship in Joyce’s booth at the York (PA) Antique Show. Sally still sits as a retired judge and hopes to go to our 55th. ✹ Alice Ossmer Olson has been retired from teaching for eight years but continues to work at the local library. She and her family enjoy Maine’s Eustis, Flagstaff Lake, and Round Pond. She traveled to Scotland in spring 2022 and looks forward to visiting Madeira Island in the Azores. ✹ In spite of a persistent medical issue, Paul McGurren went on a fly-fishing trip of a lifetime last May. He flew with friends to Montana for eight days and stayed at a gorgeous private ranch house on a 4,000-acre plot with ponds full of huge rainbow and brown trout. Food and lodging were provided as well as a private jet. Paul is proud father of daughters Emma and Clara, now living within driving distance in Maine. ✹ Michael Harvey, who lives in Hancock, N.H., and his son, Colin, a filmmaker from Los Angeles, completed a 30-minute documentary on the homeless population in southern New Hampshire. They interviewed numerous homeless people, experts in the public defender’s office, and the county prison warden. The film has been shown at festivals and will air on New Hampshire PBS. ✹ Dean Ridley, John and Janet Shreve Martland, and Nat Smith and his wife, Mary, were all at reunion. In July John and his family ran into Jean De Christoforo Coello, a Vermont native, on a hiking trail in the White Mountains. John and Janet have taken several road trips, including to the Outer Banks to see their youngest son and family. ✹ Robert Brown loved teaching high school history for 41 years. He’s served on the local board of education and is involved in Connecticut’s teacher’s union political action committee. He and his wife enjoy time with their five grandkids. ✹ Bob and Judy Moreland Spitz attended our 50th and were happy to get together with Peter and Pam Mause Vose and Susie-Jane (Rogers ’73) and David Belton. Judy found Colby’s campus and the programs it’s developing very impressive. ✹ Tina Murphy Serdjenian had a wonderful time reconnecting with classmates from the Classes of ’70, ’71, and ’72 at reunion. She thanks Dave Cheever, Debbie Christensen Stewart, and Andrine Smith for getting our yearbooks out ahead of reunion. Tina also thanks Chris and Debbie Trescott Pinkham, Mike Szostak, and Clark Ruff for their planning, communications, and leadership to make our reunion so special. Thanks also to Chris Hanley Pike, who worked very hard to honor classmates and “honorary” classmates no longer with us. ✹ Joani and Billy Alfond continued their gracious hospitality at their Belgrade home on the Sunday of Reunion Weekend, as they’ve done for us reunion after reunion. Thank you to John Atkinson, who joined Billy in providing boat rides around the lake. Billy has enjoyed Zoom calls, catching up on life with classmates, and being on Colby’s Board of Trustees, which allows him to appreciate and admire the vital work that Colby accomplishes. Billy and Joani enjoyed a wonderful summer in Maine with their children and seven grandchildren, ending with a trip to Italy with their entire family (15) to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. ✹ John Danila had a terrifying experience in August 2022 at Ogunquit Beach. He and his partner got stuck in a rip current that pulled them way offshore. A witness alerted the lifeguards, and a 16-year-old came to their rescue. An unforgettable experience for him. ✹ Greg Chapman is in his 50th year in education and is currently subbing. He coached football for 25 years and basketball for 22. Greg has memories of great times and great people at Colby. He was saddened to hear of the loss of his Colby roommates Cletch, Crabby, and Pikey. ✹ Time goes by way too fast. Carpe Diem!\n\n’73\n\nCarol Chalker\n\nclassnews1973@colby.edu\n\nThe Class of ’73 has been busy keeping up with all of the information that Colby requested to prepare us for an amazing experience at our 50th Reunion. A few classmates shared recent experiences. ✹ Author Richard Cass has published his seventh novel, The Last Altruist. It’s his first standalone mystery that follows the sixth book in his Elder Darrow Jazz Mystery series. In 2018 he was the “Crime Fiction” winner of the Maine Literary Awards, and in 2021 he was awarded the Nancy Pearl Book Award. Visit his website to learn more: rjcassbooks.com. ✹ Gülsün Aydinlar writes from her home in Turkey. Due to a number of health-related procedures last year, she won’t be able to attend reunion. She sends her love and best wishes all. When the pandemic started, Gülsün retired from Bosphorus University, where she taught English. She especially would like to be remembered to her Colby roommates Ida Dionne Burroughs and Terri Ashburn Higgins. ✹ Anne Huff Jordan experienced a number of health issues last year that needed attending to, but she helped with her son’s new puppy in her recovery. She also found time to include some recollections for our reunion yearbook, and I’m very jealous that hers included seeing a moose near her sleeping bag while camping on Mount Katahdin with the Outing Club! Thank you for sharing that memory, Anne. ✹ Stay tuned for a very newsy column following Reunion 2023.\n\n’74\n\nDennis Delehanty\n\nRichard Vann\n\nclassnews1974@colby.edu\n\nJudging from the abundance of news submitted for this column, we can now proclaim that the pandemic has ended! ✹ Brian McQuarrie traveled to western Ukraine last summer to produce a three-part series for the Boston Globe on the grim daily lives of refugees displaced by the war in the east and the mood of defiance among ordinary Ukrainians. ✹ Harriet Hults King is returning to Vermont to take up a job she held previously and loved, working as a small-town prosecutor. ✹ Last summer Jane Dutton ventured to the Canadian Rockies and Glacier National Park for the trip of a lifetime. ✹ Philip DeFord is teaching Introduction to International Business as an adjunct at Saint Louis University. ✹ Newly retired Nancy Snow Littlefield is studying for her second (!) B.A., this time in classics, at the University of Vermont. After taking Homeric Greek with Professor Westervelt at Colby, Nancy always longed to major in the classics. ✹ Jody St. Hilaire has downsized and moved to a new Las Vegas neighborhood five minutes from her two beloved grandchildren. ✹ Having just won a trial for a Fairbanks hospital, Howard Lazar can now brag that he has won trials in every decade from his 20s to his 70s. ✹ For happily retired Craig and Cathy Downes Weston, travel last year included a bike tour along the Danube River. ✹ Diana Waterous Centorino’s first grandchildren, a boy, then a girl, were born last September and October, 10 days apart! ✹ After 35 years managing a lab at Schepens Eye Research Institute/Mass Eye and Ear, Sandra Spurr Michaud has retired to Cape Cod. Sandra would love to hear from Ronda Luce and Kyle Buck MacPherson. ✹ Mark Curtis revels in the athletic feats of his grandchildren, who variously play basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. After a double bypass last August, Mark says that “all going well.” ✹ David Bailey continues to teach music lessons for woodwind, brass, percussion, guitar, recorders, and bass in Nashua, N.H. David is in his 37th year conducting the Hollis Town Band nearby. ✹ Lynn Urban Roberge and her husband operate a marina in Casco, Maine, purchased a dozen years ago as a “retirement plan.” It’s a “fun business to own,” writes Lynn, offering slip and boat rentals on a gorgeous lake. ✹ A thoughtful message arrived from David DiCola, who retired in 2015 primarily to care for his dad, a severely wounded World War II veteran who had been diagnosed with dementia a decade earlier. Though his dad passed away in 2019 at age 101, David feels grateful to have been able to develop a stronger bond with him during his last years. ✹ Last summer Michael McNamara navigated up the Seine on a Viking river cruise from Paris to the Normandy beaches. Having an uncle who lost a leg on D-Day, Mike found the memorial service at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach particularly moving. ✹ John Ladky’s “test run” for our class’s forthcoming reunion was his 50th high school reunion at the University School of Milwaukee. ✹ Scott Hobden and Donald Joseph were on Mayflower Hill last September for a reunion of Colby’s 1972 football team that finished 7-1. Scott was in awe of the transformation of Colby’s campus. “Words don’t do it justice,” he writes. “You need to see it for yourself.” ✹ Marilyn Lebowitz Rothberg’s husband, Brian Rothberg, and Norman Rattey completed their second Des Moines Register Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa, a 470-mile route. The pair’s team name was the Maine Line Spokesmen—a nod to Norm’s home in Maine and Brian’s residence on Philadelphia’s Main Line. ✹ Finally, it is with great sadness that we share the passing of Linda Krohn Lund last August. Lindy loved her time at Colby and joined many of our reunions, most recently our 45th. Lindy lived a life of good humor, compassion, and grace despite the challenges she faced over the years. Even after her ALS diagnosis last year, she would start each day by saying, “It’s good day!” Yes, Lindy, it is a good day … because we had you in our lives.\n\n’75\n\nSusie Gearhart Wuest\n\nclassnews1975@colby.edu\n\nThanks for all the great responses! ✹ Katy Seabrook Brunault continues to play cello in a community orchestra and teach ballet and pointe one night a week.

They also spend a week on the Maine coast every summer. ✹ Ed Walczak traveled to London and Paris on business in October, followed by a more interesting tour of Vietnam and Cambodia in November. ✹ Michael and Kristine Bowen Lynes spent five months in winter 2021 in Norway, where Michael was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Bergen, Center for Diabetes Research. Since then, he’s stepped down after a decade as molecular and cell biology department head at UConn. Now they’re spending more time with their five grandkids. Retired for several years now, Kris helped their kids manage the issues Covid brings to young families; something she continues to do. Not ready to retire yet, Michael continues working on a therapeutic antibody recently licensed to a pharmaceutical company. ✹ Andie Ward Antone finally fit in her 2020-postponed traveling, first with a retirement trip to Paris and Italy, an Alaskan cruise, both with her youngest daughter, and then with Linda Watts to our twice-postponed 45th reunion, which was all she had hoped it would be. She said it was a great time with people she knew well and others she hadn’t really known. An unexpected and fun adventure was discovering that our class was housed in the former ATO house and then exploring new buildings on campus as well as in downtown Waterville. ✹ In October Mike Fletcher attended the 50th Reunion of the 7-1 1972 Colby Mules football team, when they gathered Sept. 17, 2022, at the Colby home opener with a victory over Williams College. They shared memories/stories, went to a dinner that Carl Nelson attended, and remembered those teammates and coaches who had passed. It was great seeing all his teammates again. Mike plans to retire in March to spend time with grandchildren, travel, and golf! ✹ Sarah Dailey ’74 and Alan Berry now have four grandchildren ranging in ages from 4 to 10.

After spending a few weeks in both Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks last August, Eric remarked on how the national parks are such a treasure. He has stayed in touch with former Colby buddies Steve Smith and Steve Kunzman, who inspired Eric to keep music in his life. ✹ I was sorry to miss our 45+2-year Colby reunion, but my husband, Paul, and I opted instead to spend a few days with our grandchildren on Cape Cod. In October we had the opportunity to visit Pete Coz in Southern California. About five years earlier, he began construction on an all-steel frame structure for a Spanish Revival-style house on a “hilltop” in Bonsall, Calif., 11 miles east of Oceanside. Pete did a large portion of the work himself, and three years later, the interior and exterior were completed, including solar panels and extensive landscaping, plus great views of both the ocean and the mountains. Truly a comfortable home for his family: wife Susan and twin daughters Petra and Lizzie, 7 ½ years old.\n\n’76\n\nRobert Weinstein\n\nclassnews1976@colby.edu\n\nHello, my ’76ers! Hard to believe it’s already been so long since reunion. Hoping you’ve been well.✹ First-time writer Bob McAuliffe received his doctorate in economics from the University of Virginia. He then taught at Babson College for 40 years. He retired in 2021 but may reconsider. (Great to hear from you, Bob. And now hoping to hear soon from other first-time writers!) ✹ Heather Finney Eng is enjoying life in Pittsburgh, well launched into “real life.” She made two retirement commitments: exercise every day and make no commitments. Heather recently narrated a recorded book at the Library for Accessible Media for Pennsylvanians and loves the process. Her ecologist daughter has encouraged Heather to convert her mown-grass yard into a more natural habitat; Heather’s focused on supporting native bees and pollinators. Heather has a new bike and is training for a Pittsburgh-to-DC trip along the Great Allegheny Passage; she’s hoping to go this coming summer once her husband retires. She maintains monthly Zoom contact with Kathy Jewett ’77, Joy Sawyer Mulligan, Julie Stewart, and Wendy Swallow. ✹ Since the educational and Covid shutdowns in China, Mitch Brown’s international tutoring business has grown even more. He teaches about 20 students from around the world. He also runs his home-improvement construction business while taking care of family rental houses. Mitch says the mix of intellectual and physical work gives him the variety to maintain his energy and meet each challenge. All four of Mitch’s daughters are now out of the house. His wife runs her own RNA-sequencing cancer diagnosis and treatment company. Mitch continues to play soccer regularly, though after two hip replacements and rehab, he’s decided it may finally be time to play at his own age level. Mitch and his wife hope to travel as well. He sends his prayers for everyone’s peace, harmony, balance, and health. ✹ Sherry DeLuca Delany reports that her son Joseph is currently a Colby first-year who did his first semester in Salamanca, Spain, after taking a gap year (thanks to Covid). Joseph seems to be loving the experience and was excited to get to the Colby campus for Jan Plan 2023. Joseph’s twin brother is doing an internship in marine biology at the Cape Eleuthera Institute in the Bahamas. ✹ Cathy Worcester Moison has a simple message for all of us. Having lost too many relatives this past year—including two brothers within four days—Cathy writes, “Do it. Do it now. Spend time with people now as tomorrow is not promised.” Cathy’s message is not only simple but also powerful. ✹ Susan and Barry Rabin had a great time at our class reunion in June; it was fun to mingle with the others. They had a terrific Sunday brunch at the new Lockwood Hotel in downtown Waterville and highly recommend it to any visitors. They’re well and enjoy having their two grandchildren across the street from them. Barry can’t believe the next reunion is our 50th. “Wow!” ✹ Like many of us, Dale-Marie Crooks Golden MacDonald traveled “home” for her 50th high school reunion; in her case, it coincided with her birthday. While in Massachusetts, she naturally reunited with Betsy Buckland for a birthday lobster roll! ✹ As for Robert Weinstein (me!), I returned to community theater in 2022. In April I played Old Mr. Toad in The Adventures of Peter Cottontail. Over the summer, I was in Mary Poppins at the Algonquin Theatre in Manasquan, N.J. A terrific experience. As I complete this column, I’m rehearsing for the musical A Christmas Story, also at the Algonquin in December. In addition to being in the ensemble, I’ll be playing the cranky, cantankerous department store Santa in Act 2. Some have called it typecasting! Closing this column with a reminder that our 50th reunion is closer than you think. Remember to donate to the Colby Fund. Please contact that classmate who’s been on your mind. Be well, everyone!\n\n’77\n\nRuss Lowe\n\nclassnews1977@colby.edu\n\nMany of us may be retired or close to it, but we do find some great ways to keep challenging ourselves in this phase of our lives. ✹ Joanne Karlin Giudicelli writes that pickleball is a great replacement for the tennis that she played for years. She still runs two companies, spends time with her horses, and sees kids and grandchildren while feeding the addiction of pickleball. She published a second book in 2022: Freedom from a Toxic Relationship with Food: A Journey That Will Give You Your Life Back. Life is good, except for the extreme heat, drought, and fires. ✹ It’s been quite some time since we heard from Martin Lobkowicz. He married in 1983 and has a son who married in 2021 and a daughter who is recently engaged. He moved to Florida in 1994 and ran his own business for many years but is now consulting in the electronics industry and doing volunteer work for the Palm Beach Animal Care & Control facility. He finds time to fish and golf with his wife. ✹ Mindy Levy stopped by Colby when she was visiting the U.S. last November. She’s lived in Israel since 1979 and has a new book out, Birth Days: Inspiring Stories of Healing and Transformation in Childbirth. It is all about how she became a midwife, body-mind psychotherapist, and specialist in working with post-trauma surrounding birth. ✹ I got to see Sue Harvey and many others at reunion in June. Sue reported that she and Vicki Johnson were happy to see the people there from our class. We both ended up talking with folks who were not close friends back in the day. Vicki also saw an old friend, Everett Briggs ’80, due to the extra classes having reunion this year. One of the best things about the weekend was a tour of Miller Library’s tower. Fantastic views for miles and miles all around. I echo what Sue said about reunion—the College is more beautiful than ever. Colby goes all out to put on a great party for us. Check out the pictures and follow the Colby College Class of 1977 Facebook page.\n\n’78\n\nLisa Mathey Landry\n\nclassnews1978@colby.edu\n\nThanks for the abundance of news! We’ll begin with all the weddings. In August Suellen and Jeff Wheeler’s daughter, Katie, was married on Cape Cod. In September Sarah and Bob Underhill celebrated the marriage of their daughter, Molly, on Nantucket, with Gary McCarthy ’79 and Henry Kennedy ’80. Then, Chris and Lea Jackson Morrissey’s daughter, Anne, was wed in Marblehead, Mass. Four Morrissey alumni joined in the celebration: Chris’s father, Chuck ’56; brothers Dean ’79 and Shawn ’81; and sister Shannon Morrissey Cronin ’85, as well as Peter Schmidt-Fellner and Sandy Buck. Jeff, Bob, Chris, Peter, and Sandy were off-campus roommates their senior year; it was lovely they were able to witness all three weddings together. ✹ Lastly, Nancy Piccin and Ken Kubic tied the knot in November! This was the culmination of a busy year of changes, including the sale of her long-time home, the death of her mother, and retirement. At Ed Smith’s “Lobsterfest,” Nancy joined Sue (Conant ’75) and Jim Cook, Anne Marie Hobson Pesarik, Laura Hyer, and John Devine. Still living in Andover, Mass., John spends a lot of time at Colby, watching hockey games at the amazing new athletic center with Brian and Michele Fortier Cullen and Mike Slavin. ✹ Cynthia Burns Martin entered Colby with us but spent only two years there.

Betsey Judd Butler lives in Durango, Colo., with her husband, Rich, where they ski, snowshoe, and hike. They’ve climbed all the 14,000-plus-foot peaks in Colorado (54 official and two unofficial), and last summer she solo hiked the Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango, 485 miles, in 32 days (resupplied by Rich and her son, Brett). ✹ In September Paul Wolf and Jacie (Cordes ’79) and Charlie Hurd hiked almost 74 miles in the Engadine region of the Swiss Alps, an amazing bucket-list item following the previous summer’s “old-man backpacking” trip. ✹ After 35 years, Paul Fackler retired as a professor in the Department of Agriculture and Resource Economics at North Carolina State University.

They traveled last October to Georgia and South Carolina with classmate Sheila Meeres Yurcik. In November Karen and Ben headed to Hawaii and on a trip to be decided in December. They enjoy having time for hobbies, traveling, and visiting their daughter in Chicago whenever they want, no longer tied to the school vacation calendar. ✹ Another classmate, Gayle Amato, retired June 1, 2022. Last summer she did more hiking with a local hiking group and also participated in a choral concert for the first time since the pandemic started, with the Hartford Chorale. Unfortunately, they’re still required to wear masks when performing. In August Gayle celebrated her nephew’s wedding in Portland, Ore., which also included hiking and e-biking in the Columbia Gorge. There were trips to Virginia and Maine over the summer, with extended babysitting for Gayle’s 4-month-old grandson in NC and a quick trip to Alabama for her granddaughter’s first birthday.
