        "text": "Jack Valentine is having a very bad day. He's chronically unhappy, unfulfilled and broke; his girlfriend has left him; and he's just been hit by a truck. Still, when he wakes up in a hospital covered in bruises, he's certain it's all happening for a reason. As Jack recovers, his dying hospital roommate, who happens to be Jack's long-lost father, imparts some final advice: the only three questions that matter are whether one has lived wisely, loved well and served greatly. He sends Jack on a journey around the world to meet three teachers (the saint, surfer and CEO), who guide him through a spiritual transformation and help him answer the three questions. Sharma, a motivational speaker and \"life coach,\" has attempted a spiritual allegory Ã  la Paulo Coelho's classic, The Alchemist. Unfortunately, Sharma's book lacks any narrative drive, the characters are thinly rendered and the dialogue is almost comically wooden (\"You're getting to be a pretty good surfer there Jack.\" \"It's become a passion of mine Moe\"). Readers seeking Sharma's brand of advice (e.g., \"see your life as a fantastic growth school\" and \"be true to yourself\") will lose nothing simply turning to the last page, where the book's lessons are laid out in 10 succinct bullet points. (Nov.)\n\nForecast:Sharma's previous book, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari (HarperCollins), sold 40,000 copies. Blurbs from Richard Carlson ( Don't Sweat the Small Stuff) and Mark Victor Hansen (the Chicken Soup series) could help this one, but weak reviews may stunt sales."
