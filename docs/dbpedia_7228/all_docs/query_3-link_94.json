        "text": "Peter Singer, the Australian philosopher, became a vegetarian in his mid-twenties, after a fellow Oxford graduate student told him, over a spaghetti lunch, about the brutality of factory farms. A few years later, in 1973, Singer proposed an essay called “Animal Liberation” to The New York Review of Books. Robert Silvers, the magazine’s longtime editor, not only published it; he became a vegetarian, too. In 1975, Singer expanded the essay into a book, which has been translated into dozens of languages and helped inspire the modern animal-rights movement.\n\nSinger, who is seventy-four, is now the author of seventeen books and the editor or co-author of two dozen more. He has written about birth and death, Hegel and Marx, political philosophy and globalization, and many other topics. (He’s just edited a new version of Apuleius’ “The Golden Ass,” a second-century Roman novel which, he told me, can be read as a “kind of adventure fiction.” He explained, “The author clearly has some sympathy with animals.”) Singer calls himself a consequentialist: he believes that actions should be judged by their consequences. His ideas about our ethical obligation to help people in extreme poverty, first expressed in his essay “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” from 1972, and later in his book “The Life You Can Save,” from 2009, are foundational to the effective-altruism movement, which encourages people in wealthy countries to donate large sums to charities that measurably improve the most lives. They have also influenced the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic campaign launched by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.\n\nOthers have discovered Singer’s work because of the controversies he has ignited. In his book “Practical Ethics,” from 1979, he argued that parents should have the right to end the lives of newborns with severe disabilities. In the decades since, a number of his lectures have been disrupted by demonstrators or cancelled altogether. In 1999, the disability-rights group Not Dead Yet protested his appointment at Princeton, where he still teaches. That year, he was profiled in this magazine by Michael Specter; the piece was titled “The Dangerous Philosopher.” On Friday, Singer and two fellow-ethicists launched a peer-reviewed publication called the Journal of Controversial Ideas.\n\nSinger spent the past year at home in Melbourne with his wife of fifty-two years, Renata. He told me that he missed seeing his children and hugging his grandchildren but that he “probably got more work done than I would have in a normal year.” He also surfed, a hobby he picked up in his fifties. In our three conversations by video chat, he joined me from a spare white study with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Our conversations have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHave you been thinking about the philosophical implications of the pandemic?\n\nThere are specific issues that I’ve been interested in. How should we distribute the vaccine? How do we decide whether the lockdown is justified? If we’re short of intensive-care beds, of respirators, should we give preference to people who are younger and therefore will have longer to live, or other people who might have equal need but a much shorter life expectancy? I think the pandemic sharpens, and forces us to answer, a lot of questions that were lurking—it’s not as if, before the pandemic, there weren’t people dying from preventable diseases that we could have helped but didn’t. The pandemic has affected us greatly, but it hasn’t killed as many people as die every year from preventable, poverty-related causes.\n\nI was surprised, going through some of your work, that you wrote about pandemics in 2015, in “The Most Good You Can Do.” You talk about the risk of a serious pandemic breaking out because of the way that we treat animals.\n\nThere are two public-health risks in factory farms. The one that’s well documented is the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through the routine feeding of antibiotics to factory-farm animals. The pandemic stuff was a bit more speculative, but, in 2009, when we got the swine-flu pandemic, one that implicated factory pig farms pretty directly, I started talking about it occasionally.\n\nWhen I started thinking about the treatment of animals and became a vegetarian, it was entirely because of concern for what we do to animals. Then along came climate change. And although, at first, that seemed to be about fossil-fuel burning, it turns out that meat production is a significant contributor. So then you get an additional reason for not eating meat or for being vegan. With the pandemic, we’ve got another major reason.\n\nThe vast majority of vaccines have been “reserved” by wealthy nations, and so hundreds of millions of doses go first to the U.S. and Europe. I’m wondering how much this bothers you and what should be done about it.\n\nI think it’s disgraceful that the vaccines are being bought up by wealthy countries—some of which, I should say, have relatively low need. We have very few cases in Australia but have ordered more than enough vaccines to vaccinate everyone in the country.\n\nWhere does responsibility lie for making the distribution more equitable?\n\nWe don’t have a world government, so we are a world of sovereign nations—and those governments should be getting together so that the burden is distributed equitably among affluent nations, just as we get together in the Paris agreement to try to distribute the burden of reducing greenhouse gases equitably. The World Health Organization, of course, is proposing a scheme for a more equitable distribution, and I think governments should be signing on to that.\n\nThe pharmaceutical companies can play a role, of course, in terms of making some vaccines available at cost, or allowing producers in low-income countries to produce generics. But you can’t expect pharmaceuticals to be charities. The system of patenting rewards companies for selling to wealthy people and doesn’t reward them for providing drugs for people who can’t afford them. An alternative scheme, called the Health Impact Fund, has been proposed, to which governments would contribute funds, and they would be allocated to the extent that a drug reduces the global burden of disease. Then the pharmaceutical companies would have an incentive to develop those products that would do the most to help people worldwide. That would be a much more rational system.\n\nHow did your family first come to live in Australia?\n\nMy parents were both living in Vienna in the nineteen-thirties. They were around thirty years old when Hitler marched into Austria, and they were both Jewish. They realized very rapidly that they had no future in Austria. Jews could not own businesses under Nazi laws, and my mother was just qualified as a physician. The Nazis said that Jewish doctors could only treat Jewish patients. I don’t think they actually, at that stage anyway, really thought that they could be murdered. But my father wrote to an uncle in America, and said, “Could you provide a sponsorship for me and my wife?” And the uncle wrote back, saying, “I’m very happy to sponsor you. But, unfortunately, as I’ve not had the opportunity to meet your wife, I can’t sponsor her.” So, obviously, that was a pretty devastating blow.\n\nMy mother then remembered that she had met an Australian who had come to Austria to ski, and she’d been invited to join him and some friends at one of the wine bars on the edge of Vienna. He had then sent her a card from Australia, thanking her for the company. She thought she would write to this man. He was not Jewish. He was a Catholic of Irish descent, but he was very supportive and moved rapidly to organize visas for my father and for her. And that’s why they came to Australia. We went to see the man who sponsored them, Jerry Donovan, in Melbourne, when I was a child.\n\nOf my four grandparents, one, my mother’s mother, survived the Holocaust and came to Australia just about when I was born, in 1946. She lived until 1955. We were very close. We had other Jewish friends in Melbourne, some of whom had concentration-camp numbers tattooed on their arms. I wondered what that meant.\n\nDid your family history influence your views of ethics?\n\nI’m sure, but I can’t say that I was really conscious of it. The elements that I was conscious of were an abhorrence of racism and violence. I read a lot of history of the coming of Fascism in Europe, and how the Holocaust was conceived and planned. Some people have said, “Well, if you’re aware of this kind of sheer physical suffering being inflicted on your family, then it’s easier to empathize with the suffering that’s being inflicted on nonhuman animals.” Isaac Bashevis Singer, who is no relation to me, said the same kind of thing—in one of his stories, he has a character saying, “For the animals, every day is Treblinka.”\n\nIn a book about your maternal grandfather, “Pushing Time Away,” you write that he met your grandmother, in part, because he was attracted to men, and she was attracted to women, and they were meeting to discuss that. That seemed like a real discovery.\n\nThat was a real discovery, yes. I learned about it only when I obtained letters that my grandfather had written to my grandmother, which had been brought to Australia. I found this whole stack of letters in my aunt’s apartment. I read German, but this earlier style of handwriting was a lot of trouble to read. When I got somebody to transcribe them, I was completely amazed. I had no idea that their original connection was because of attractions to people of their own sex.\n\nWhat motivated you to go through all that, and write a book about it in the end?\n\nI originally was interested in learning more about my grandfather, because he was the person in my family who I could perhaps most see as a forerunner to myself. I knew that he had been a member of Freud’s Wednesday circle, that he had co-authored a paper with Freud, and that then he had been involved with Alfred Adler, the founder of Individual Psychology. I wanted to see: Were there any parallels between his thinking and mine? But then I found out other things that I didn’t expect.\n\nI got the sense, from the book, that you questioned whether it was worthwhile to write about your family history.\n\nThat’s right. And I still have that feeling a little bit. Which of my works have done the most good? It’s not going to be “Pushing Time Away.” It’s going to be “Animal Liberation” or “The Life You Can Save.” I think it’s good for my children and grandchildren, but from an impartial calculation of how I can do the most good, this was something of an indulgence.\n\nOne of the reasons that I was first drawn to your work was that it encourages me, as an individual, to consider all the downstream consequences of what I do. In “Animal Liberation,” you call on us to “take responsibility for our own lives, and make them as free of cruelty as we can.” This idea reappears in your work later on.\n\nI think that’s right. You can compare the dollars you spend on products as a kind of voting for that industry or method of production. “Animal Liberation” is essentially saying, “Stop eating the products of cruelly treated animals. You don’t need a social revolution—or the social revolution is too difficult to achieve, and rather we should focus on getting individuals to change their practices.” Maybe that’s had some influence on my thinking, and why I think about individual change.\n\nYou’re saying that “Animal Liberation” perhaps carried over into the way you framed your arguments about global poverty, in that you were centering responsibility in the individual?\n\nIt’s possible that there’s continuity. While I was a student at Oxford, there was a group called Radical Philosophy. A lot of the people who were involved were influenced by a broad Marxist tradition—that is, they thought that we needed to overthrow the capitalist system and replace it with something better. I started to feel that there was a lot of talk going on, and it wasn’t really making much impact.\n\nYou couldn’t live through that period without having seen footage of starving children—particularly from the Biafra crisis, when part of Nigeria broke away and was essentially besieged by the rest of Nigeria. We were living in Oxford, which is where Oxfam, the international aid organization, had its headquarters. They seemed to be trying to do things along the right lines, and so we started supporting them.\n\nA lot of people thought that we don’t have to help people in extreme poverty, because we’re not responsible for their poverty. You can say, “Yes, we are responsible because we benefit from an unequal global trading system,” but that’s a complicated debate. I was trying to cut around that by saying, “Look, if you came across a child drowning in a shallow pond, and you could rescue that child at relatively minor cost to yourself, but you just decided not to do it because you didn’t want to ruin your clothes, that would be horrible.” But, then, if you accept that, you are accepting that we have responsibilities for people who are in need.\n\nYou seem to be a skeptic of Marx’s ideas in practice. Why did you write a book about Marx?\n\nI was invited to do a book for an Oxford series. I had studied Marx when I was a graduate student, and there was this view of early Marx, largely based on some unpublished writings, that was all about alienation, and that there was a decisive break that came somewhere around 1848—first you had the kind of Hegelian-philosophy Marx, and then you had the different, scientific Marxism, and there wasn’t much of a connection between the two. In studying this, I’d been persuaded that was wrong, that there was continuity, and that you could explain what Marx was on about in his later writings by looking at the early writings—and that this also explained some of the flaws in Marx’s thinking. The idea that history is leading toward this goal, where all the contradictions will be resolved, came straight from Hegel. I think there are some interesting critiques of what’s going on in capitalist societies, but he really thinks that the revolution is inevitable. I think that was clearly wrong.\n\nIt seems like one of your least “instructive” books, in terms of how to live.\n\nThat’s true. I guess it’s one way in which we ought not to live. And that is still relevant because, very often, when I speak about global poverty, somebody gets up and says, “Well, isn’t the problem really capitalism? And shouldn’t we be doing what we can do to overthrow capitalism?”\n\nIt seems to me that the movement that has grown up around your philosophical work has ended up being very compatible with capitalism, in the sense that some of its practitioners are people who set out to earn a lot of money—some of them are billionaires who have decided to give away the money that they’ve amassed. Was that something you expected, for capitalism to almost be incorporated into your philosophical work?\n\nI don’t think capitalism is incorporated into my philosophical work. I think my philosophical work is neutral about what is the best economic system—but it’s also realistic, and I think we’re stuck with capitalism for the foreseeable future. We are going to continue to have billionaires, and it’s much better that we have billionaires like Bill and Melinda Gates or Warren Buffett, who give away most of their fortune thoughtfully and in ways that are highly effective, than billionaires who just build themselves bigger and bigger yachts.\n\nDoes that mean you’re not that interested in the question of whether billionaires should exist?\n\nLook, I think it would be better if you had an economic system in which we didn’t have billionaires—but the productivity that billionaires have generated was still there, and that money was more equitably distributed. But, really, there hasn’t been a system that has had equity in its distribution and the productivity that capitalism has had. I don’t see that happening anytime soon. If one country starts to tax billionaires so that there can’t be any billionaires, those billionaires are going to go to other countries where they can continue to be billionaires.\n\nOne thing that surprised me, in “The Life You Can Save,” is that you argue in favor of very high salaries for C.E.O.s. You also write that inequality is a problem only insofar as it leads to oppressive relationships—that inequality in itself is not wrong.\n\nI think my point there was simply that it’s rational for corporations that are doing billions of dollars’ worth of business to be prepared to pay tens of millions of dollars to hire somebody who can maintain that level of profitability. That makes perfect sense. So I don’t think we should be surprised by the way they do it now.\n\nIf you’re asking me, “Would it be a better system if no C.E.O. would want to earn fifty million dollars?” Yeah, that would be a better ethos. But I see the difficulties in a real transformation, not only in a culture, but perhaps pushing against some aspects of human nature that a culture has emphasized and that people then come to see as natural. It’s not easy to change that.\n\nAnd that aspect of the culture, in this case, is self-interest?\n\nYeah, and a belief in market competitiveness, I guess. And an assessment of worth in terms of how much you earn, rather than the social good that you produce. But there are lots of books that have been pointing this out and have said, “This is not good, and we should change.” But it doesn’t seem that writing books about this actually has a very lasting impact. I suppose I’ve come to think that encouraging people—wealthy people—to give fifty per cent of their income, or all the different sliding percentages that I talk about in “The Life You Can Save, ”that’s more likely to do some good.\n\nA lot of your works cite white male academics who, for lack of a better phrase, take up a lot of space in intellectual conversations: Joshua Greene, Steven Pinker, Timothy Garton Ash, Michael Sandel, Benedict Anderson, John Rawls, to name a few. Because so much of your work is fundamentally about equity, I wonder if that is something that’s on your radar.\n\nThat’s the manner in which I was educated, I suppose, and which still is very influential in the ideas that I’m involved with. I’ve certainly worked with a lot of philosophers who are not male, but they have been white generally. I’ve got a project now about the issue of global population, with Alex Ezeh, a demographer of Nigerian origin at Drexel University. I worked with Pascal Kasimba when I was at Monash University, who is of African descent, on a project relating to in-vitro fertilization. I have also co-authored things with people of Asian descent, with Yew-Kwang Ng, for instance. But, I have to say, I want to work with people whose ideas are, you know, at a level of discussion that I’m interested in, and that I’m progressing. If you’re thinking of the work of Africans, for example, I don’t know the work of many of them that is really in the same sort of—I’m not quite sure how to put this—participating in the same discussion as the people you’ve just mentioned.\n\nThere’s a big difference between “I haven’t found them yet” and “They might not exist.” Do you think it’s for lack of searching? Or lack of representation, period, across philosophy and the fields that you work in?\n\nThere’s certainly an underrepresentation of philosophers of African or African-American backgrounds. No question about that, in the field of philosophy that I work in. And there is an underrepresentation of women, although I think that’s changing. I’ve tried to encourage women in philosophy all my career. But there’s still an underrepresentation. I was the founding president of the International Association of Bioethics, in the early eighties, and we did try very hard to get global representation. So I wouldn’t say that I’ve not searched, but it’s true that that’s not been one of my priorities, really.\n\nI think it’s a worthwhile question, because there are moments in your work where you argue that there should be a shift of decision-making power away from big, powerful non-governmental organizations and toward communities that have the best understanding of their needs. And I wonder whether international perspectives would help you execute the vision of effective giving and fighting world poverty. I’m thinking, for example, of Amartya Sen as an economist who uses philosophical frameworks to describe poverty and the right responses to it.\n\nYes, but, often, the people who write those things—Sen would be a good example—seem to be, in spirit and thought, much closer to Western élites than they are to people in poverty in rural villages. I’m not sure that it makes a huge difference to Sen’s writing that he has an Indian background, really. It’s a question you can speculate on, obviously.\n\nI probably have stayed out of discussions of race relations in America largely because I’m not an American, and I feel as if people who’ve been working for so long on these questions have a stronger feel for it than I do. And I still feel a bit of an outsider in that discussion.\n\nYou’ve touched on migration here and there in your writings, and it’s part of your family’s story. But I heard you say on a podcast that we might actually have a moral imperative not to open borders, because it could lead to the kind of backlash that would put the likes of Donald Trump in power. It was a very surprising way of looking at it. What is your view on migration? What should we be doing?\n\nI don’t think you should find it surprising, given that I’m a consequentialist. In an ideal world, we would have open borders, no question about that. I think that would have many good consequences and certainly would enable refugees to move away from situations of oppression and genocide. Obviously, my parents did just that, and that’s why I exist.\n\nBut I’ve seen the effect of regimes that do open borders, or nearly open borders. I was a founding member of the Australian Greens, which said that we should accept all the so-called boat people from Afghanistan and Iran and other places, who were seeking asylum in Australia in the eighties and nineties. For a time, Labor did as well. But it was clear that those issues were exploited by the conservatives to suggest that Australia was going to be swamped by different people, and I’m pretty sure it cost Labor a federal election on at least one occasion. And then you see the other bad consequences of this: not only did the borders get closed and the refugees were put in horrible detention camps, which the conservative government did, but they also opposed doing something on climate change. They cut foreign aid, they run down the hospitals and schools and universities. There is a real cost to this.\n\nThe E.U. has had to realize the same thing. You got right-wing governments in Hungary and Poland and Italy for a while. Clearly, immigration was a factor in Trump getting elected in 2016. So that’s why, as a consequentialist, I think you have to have policies that include some restrictions.\n\nIt’s a difficult standard to hold oneself to—that you can’t advocate for positions that your political opponents might use against you. In the U.S., we’re currently having this conversation around the slogan “Defund the Police,” or around the prison-abolition movement. I struggle with the idea that a consequentialist would say that we ought not to give too much oxygen to those movements, because they might provoke a backlash.\n\nSo you would have liked Biden, before the election, to say, “I endorse defunding the police”?\n\nNo, but I think the presence of “Defund the Police” in our debate about criminal justice is important, and the discussion about prison abolition is important, even as “law and order” conservatives might use it against anyone in the Democratic Party. I can’t imagine myself being in favor of trying to shut down a more radical or visionary approach.\n\nI don’t want to shut it down. I started the Journal of Controversial Ideas because I’m a great believer in freedom of speech and freedom of expression. But I also don’t want a progressive party to throw away its chances of governing by embracing ideas that clearly are rejected by the electorate.\n\nSo the order of operations is, you change hearts and minds, and then you change policy. You don’t expect policy to do the work of convincing people.\n\nYeah, that’s right. Jeremy Bentham, before the 1832 Reform Act was passed in Britain, argued for extending the vote to all men. And he wrote to his colleagues that he would have included women in that statement, except that it would be ridiculed, and, therefore, he would lose the chance of getting universal male suffrage. So he was aware of exactly this kind of argument. Bentham also wrote several essays arguing against the criminalization of sodomy, but he never published them in his lifetime, for the same reason.\n\nDoes that mean that your version of consequentialism requires a certain level of moderation, politically—that it has to always take into consideration the possible backlash and the progress you can lose out on, if you make the wrong argument?\n\nYeah, sure. I would say it just has a certain level of realism, rather than moderation. But realism will sometimes dictate moderation.\n\nI wanted to ask you about your work on disability, and your views on what is permissible for a parent to do if their child is born with a disability. This is a set of ideas that has made you very controversial, and in some circles very unpopular. And I wonder whether you’ve ever regretted wading into that arena, because it might make people less likely to come to your other ideas.\n\nYes. I’ve wondered whether the effects were good or bad. The first public protests against my views on disability were in Germany, starting in 1989. After all the attention that I got because of the protests—mostly very critical media; you know, a terrible double-page in Der Spiegel with photos of the trucks that took Jews to prison camps—the sales multiplied ten times. My views in Germany became far better known. As you say, I became very unpopular in some circles, and some of my talks got cancelled. It’s unfortunate that I get associated with these so-called “ableist” views—and, of course, in Germany there was this horrendous link with the Nazi so-called euthanasia program. It’s not that I haven’t ever regretted it. I have. But, other times, when I reflect on the over-all impact, I’m not sure that it’s been bad. I do get letters, both from people with disabilities and parents of people with disabilities, who support my views.\n\nWould you mind summarizing what your view was then, and whether it’s changed at all?\n\nMy view then was that parents of children born with serious disabilities ought to have the option of ending the life of their child, immediately after birth or as soon as the diagnosis has been properly established. It’s not true to say that I support euthanasia for disabled infants. It’s not true that I think that disabled infants ought to be killed. I think the parents ought to have that option.\n\nLet me say a couple of things in relation to that. First, parents do have that option, right now, in every country that allows abortion when a prenatal diagnosis has shown that there’s a disability. I don’t draw a big distinction between abortion and infanticide. Those who think that it’s O.K. for women to have an abortion need to show why there’s such an important difference between the fetus before birth and the newborn infant after birth. Second, parents, right now, have the option of withdrawing life support for an infant with a serious disability. I think that both of these cases convey exactly the same attitude to disability that I’m defending. You can say that is ableist. But some have said that I’m simply representative of the ableist society as a whole, which supports both of these things. And I think that’s true.\n\nI think it’s wrong to discriminate against disabled people in employment or housing or other areas where their disability is not relevant to their ability to perform the job. I fully support rights for disabled people in those respects, and for them to be in normal schools. I think it’s a complete mistake to think that I’m opposed to people with disabilities in some way. This is specifically something about euthanasia for newborn infants, who are not able to have any kind of input into what they want their lives to be like, or whether they want to live it.\n\nI have to say that comparing abortion at six months to infanticide is the sort of argument that one’s political opponents could use against you—the sort of argument that, as we were talking about a minute ago, might not be worth making because of the potential backlash.\n\nAbsolutely, and I’m glad Joe Biden didn’t make it before the last election! I’m not advocating that any political party with a serious chance should make this policy, although in some parts of the world, this is not so crazy. It actually is public policy in the Netherlands.\n\nHarriet McBryde Johnson, the disability-rights lawyer who debated you and wrote about it in a remarkable piece for the Times Magazine, in 2003, had a lot of criticisms, but one that stayed with me is the idea that you might not be in a position to evaluate whether her life involves more suffering than yours, or whether she is worse off than you are—that there might be an element of subjectivity inherent in any calculation of suffering.\n\nI totally agree with that. And, of course, I fully supported Harriet’s right to continue to live and to have the best possible life she could. And her death was a sad loss. [Johnson, whose piece for the Times Magazine began “He insists he doesn’t want to kill me,” died in 2008, in her sleep, at the age of fifty.]\n\nBut that doesn’t really help the parent trying to make a decision for their newborn infant, because their newborn infant doesn’t have the subjectivity to express a view on it. They have to make the decision. You asked me before whether my position has changed. It hasn’t fundamentally changed, but I do accept exactly this point that Harriet and others have made to me—that it’s not good enough for the parents considering this decision to talk to their doctors. They ought to talk to people with a disability that their child has, or, if that’s not possible, because the child has an intellectual disability, then the parents of children with that disability. I accept that our society does have this bias—thinking, Oh, I wouldn’t like to live that life. And you don’t really know what that life is like nearly as well as people who are living it or the parents of people who are living it. That applies to abortion as well, by the way.\n\nThe bias that you described—the assumption that a person with a disability is worse off—is that something that you recognized in yourself as these conversations were happening?\n\nTo some extent, yeah, I think so. I thought Harriet was a very good example of somebody who lived a rich and fulfilling life despite a severe disability. No intellectual disability in her case, of course. She was very sharp.\n\nDid she change your mind in some way?\n\nMaybe a bit. Maybe a bit.\n\nTell me about the Journal of Controversial Ideas.\n\nThis is a response to what I feel is a worrying trend of restricting freedom of thought and discussion, including in academic life. Francesca Minerva, Jeff McMahan, and I decided to create a journal that would, first, be prepared to publish controversial ideas and not retract articles because there were petitions or letters signed against them, and second, to allow articles to be published under a pseudonym—which, as far as we’re aware, no peer-reviewed academic journal does. If the argument is good, and if the referee says, “Yes, this is well-argued,” we won’t rule it out on the grounds that this is too controversial. It’s an attempt to provide a sort of place that can’t be cancelled, in the sense that discussion can’t be shut down by intimidation.\n\nCould you tell me about some of the topics that are appearing in the first issue?\n\nNot surprisingly, perhaps, the first issue has a couple of papers on gender issues. Does the term “woman” mean adult human female? And does that suggest that there’s a biological component to it rather than simply a matter of gender preference?\n\nAre those papers in opposition to one another?\n\nYes, they are. We have another interesting paper called “Cognitive Creationism,” which explores parallels between young-Earth creationism and the ideological views that reject well-established facts in genetics, particularly related to differences in cognitive abilities—across individuals, not between demographic groups. There’s a paper discussing blackface in terms of various cultural traditions, whether blackface can be acceptable. There’s a defense of direct action to stop animal abuse. There’s a paper raising the question of whether despotism is necessary to stop climate change. There’s a paper about punishment, which contemplates enforced coma as an alternative to long-term imprisonment. There’s a paper on the epistemology of “no platforming,” the idea that some ideas are just so stupid that you should not give them a platform, and arguing that that’s not the case.\n\nThat one’s getting pretty meta, in that it’s reflecting on the endeavor in which it’s participating.\n\nYes, that one is.\n\nMy perception is that there are times when freedom-of-speech arguments provide cover to ideas that inflict harm—and that some of these arguments come from thinkers who already do have the freedom to express their views, as long as they’re willing to be held accountable for them in a public forum.\n\nThe journal is particularly aimed at protecting junior academics who don’t have tenure. But if the concern is just that people write them hate mail, I don’t see that as an issue. Freedom of speech applies to people who write hostile criticism on Twitter—they have freedom of speech, too. I think you’ve just got to develop a thick skin. But if no publisher will touch them for fear of being branded, then I think you have a problem. John Stuart Mill says this explicitly: offense can’t be a grounds for prohibiting free speech, because it’s just too wide.\n\nDo you think of the protests against your work over the years as a form of “cancellation”?\n\nThat term wasn’t around in ’89, but, yes, I think the protests in Germany were certainly an attempt to make it impossible for me to speak publicly. But, beyond that, it’s not so much a personal thing. You could say I’m an unreconstructed supporter of freedom of thought and expression.\n\nYour views were never taken out of print, and you are, of course, a professor at Princeton who has had the ability to publish and write freely through your career.\n\nThe initial invitation in Germany came from a conference of disability organizations. They were pressured by some of the people there to disinvite me. That’s fine. But I was also invited to speak at German universities by professors who wanted to hear me speak, and the rector of the university cancelled it.\n\nI guess I’m having trouble seeing the line between cancellation and the freedom of speech of your critics.\n\nI think universities need to be a place for free discussion of ideas. Other venues can choose who to invite.\n\nAn example comes to mind. Someone might argue for a transphobic law that restricts the freedoms of a trans person, and that person can say, when they’re criticized, that their freedom of speech is being curtailed. That’s maybe part of the story. But if their advocacy is harming trans people, I would think that harm should be the center of the conversation.\n\nIn the actual debate, it’s not only harm to trans people—gender-critical feminists argue that women are harmed by not having a space that is only for biological females. If people are not allowed to say that, or are cancelled for saying it, how are you going to get to the truth of the matter? Even the label of “transphobia” is already, I think, prejudicial.\n\nBut I didn’t say anything about not allowing a person to speak—merely vehemently criticizing them. And the response to that vehement criticism is often the objection, “My freedom of speech is being curtailed.” I assume that the actual, lived harm that trans people experience might count more than the harm inflicted to a person whose freedom of speech is restricted.\n\nWhy should you have to assume that? Shouldn’t that be something that people try and produce evidence about? And that’s only half the question, right? What you’ve got to weigh is the restrictions on trans people against the restrictions on biological females.\n\nI wish it weren’t a free-speech debate—I wish it were only a debate about the substance of the claims. But people who try to raise questions from a gender-critical feminist perspective, about the substance of the claims, have difficulty in presenting their views.\n\nAs we talk about this, I’m thinking about “Animal Liberation.” You write about it being a mistake to assume that one form of discrimination is the last form of discrimination. And it occurs to me that one of the logical consequences of this observation is that some people who view themselves as fighting oppression may eventually be seen as participating in oppression that they have not yet recognized. Do you think that offering a platform to ideas that, down the road, could be seen as oppressive is participating in the oppression?\n\nNo, I think offering a platform for reasoned argument is not participating in oppression. I think it’s trying to get to the truth.\n\nIf, through truth-seeking, you conclude that the person’s argument has an oppressive effect, what comes next? If it turns out that an argument published in the Journal of Controversial Ideas causes more harm than good, what comes next?\n\nThat is quite possible—that an individual argument might cause more harm than good. What I and my co-editors believe is that promoting freedom of thought and discussion, on the whole, will do more good than harm, even if occasionally an individual article does cause more harm than good.\n\nWhat do you think is the role of accountability in this enterprise?\n\nThe way to hold academics accountable is to expose the flaws in their argument.\n\nBut if a person publishes under a pseudonym, all that happens sort of behind the veil of anonymity.\n\nThat’s true. They don’t get credit for the argument, at least as long as they retain the pseudonym, and they don’t get the opprobrium for putting forward a bad argument if the argument is exposed as wrong. I suppose we think that it’s more important that the ideas get exposed as wrong—or not, if they’re not.\n\nThe distinction between controversial and uncontroversial seems to rely on an arbiter or a gatekeeper of which ideas fall within the bounds of mainstream discussion. That puts a lot of pressure on the editorial board needing to stand in for the culture at large. And that brings us to the diversity of the editorial board—ideologically, and in terms of subject matter, in terms of backgrounds.\n\nThat’s true. We have done, and are continuing to do, our best to have a diverse editorial board. It’s certainly diverse in terms of ideological positions. Is it diverse in terms of ethnic backgrounds, gender diversity, and so on? I think we’ve tried, but maybe we haven’t got to where we should be.\n\nIt did strike me as a very white group of people. I wonder if that affects the boundaries of what the editorial board perceives as controversial—and also as a good argument.\n\nWell, I think we’re aware of the fact that we are predominantly white, and we are actively looking for other people. People are welcome to self-nominate if they wish to create that diversity, or to nominate others. To some extent, it’s a reflection of the fact that we three co-editors are white, and it’s those who we’re in contact with.\n\nWould it trouble you to publish an article about race, say, without being aware of the race of the author?\n\nNot in itself, I think. I think a paper ought to be able to be reviewed on the strength of its arguments. Obviously, in arguments drawing on personal experience, identity is a relevant factor. But I think there can also be arguments that can be assessed independently of the identity of the author.\n\nI was curious whether you have projects that you consider unfinished business. Projects you want to return to, or things you haven’t been able to get to yet, that have some urgency now.\n\nI’ve started revising “Animal Liberation.” The basic text hasn’t been updated since the 1990 edition. In fact, I’ve got a research assistant pulling out some papers on animal experimentation at the moment, and it’s pretty depressing. I thought that there’d been a bigger change. I’m reading reports that feel like I’m back in the New York Public Library in 1974, pulling out horrible experiments from journals.\n\nI talked about this possible book about ethics and population, with Alex Ezeh. I think that’s an interesting issue, whether global population is or isn’t a problem nowadays. If that goes ahead, it would be the next major new book that I would produce.\n\nIn 1999, when you were profiled in The New Yorker, your mother was living with dementia, and you talked to Michael Specter about the money you were spending on her care. And the story suggested that there might be some disconnect between your philosophical convictions and the decisions you had to make in your own life. Is that a fair way of describing what was going on at the time?\n\nYou know, I’ve often said that I don’t consider that I’m doing everything that I should do. I don’t fully live up to the really high standard that you can see in “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” where I suggest that the only real stopping place is when, if you gave any more, you’d be harming yourself as much as you’d be benefiting the person. That’s an incredibly demanding line, and I’ve never claimed to live up to it. I spend money on myself and my family. The money that my sister and I spent on my mother, and keeping her comfortable, at that level—there could have been better things you could have done with that. But, as I say, that’s true of many of the things that I spend money on.\n\nI can’t think of anybody who would criticize you for doing so. But there seems to be an implicit criticism coming from yourself.\n\nIt’s not a criticism that leaves me feeling terribly guilty, but it is an acknowledgment that I’m not living to the highest possible moral standards.\n\nDo you think of yourself as a good person?\n\nYes, because that invites a comparison with other people, and I think by those standards I’m a good person. But do I think of myself as an ideally good, perfect person, the perfect person, a secular saint? Definitely not."
