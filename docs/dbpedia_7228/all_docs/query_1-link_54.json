        "text": "Chasing Happiness happiness is why you are depressed : Do This Instead : In the pursuit of a fulfilling life, consider this paradigm shift: 1. Chase Acheivment, Not Just Happiness. How I flipped the script: ‚Üí Seek to do small actions every day. ‚Üí Cultivate qualities that attract positivity. ‚Üí Happiness becomes a result, not the sole pursuit. Start New Habits : ‚Üí Embrace self-improvement. ‚Üí Meditate to have positive energy. ‚Üí Talk to others and be your genuine self. 2. Chase Achievement, and say \"No\" to cheap Happiness. Reframe your ambitions: ‚Üí Stop hangging out with negative people. ‚Üí Stop playing video games. ‚Üí Stop eating processed food. Achievement is the way: ‚Üí Set ambitious Goals. ‚Üí Embrace challenges. ‚Üí Happiness becomes the companion on your success path. Strive for Actions, and watch your life transform. P.S: What are you chasing today?\n\n\"The Sunny Nihilist: How a Meaningless Life Can Make You Truly Happy\" by Wendy Syfret explores the idea of embracing nihilism to find contentment and happiness. Here are seven key lessons from the book: 1. Embrace Meaninglessness: Recognizing the inherent meaninglessness of life can be liberating. It allows us to let go of societal pressures to find purpose and instead focus on what brings us joy. 2. Focus on the Present: Without the burden of searching for a grand purpose, we can fully engage with the present moment and appreciate the small, everyday pleasures. 3. Freedom from Expectations: By accepting that life has no intrinsic meaning, we free ourselves from the expectations imposed by society, family, and ourselves, reducing stress and anxiety. 4. Find Personal Contentment: Happiness comes from within and is not dependent on external achievements or recognition. Embracing nihilism can help us find contentment in our terms. 5. Reevaluate Success: Success doesn't have to be defined by conventional standards like wealth, status, or career milestones. It can be about living authentically and in alignment with our values. 6. Appreciate the Absurd: Life's absurdities can be sources of amusement and wonder rather than frustration. Embracing the absurd can lead to a more lighthearted and resilient outlook. 7. Cultivate Compassion: Understanding that everyone is navigating the same meaningless existence can foster compassion and empathy towards others, enhancing our relationships and social connections.\n\n‚ú® Embrace Your True Self ‚ú® Reinventing yourself and finding your true purpose in midlife is normal. Let go of the limitations we place on ourselves. It's easy to feel lost or stuck, especially when juggling career demands, personal relationships, and the quest for deeper meaning. But remember, every challenge is an opportunity for growth and transformation. Imagine a life where you are not defined by past expectations but by your evolving essence. This period is not about a crisis; it's about a beautiful journey towards self-discovery and enlightenment. Start by tuning into your inner wisdom. Spend a few moments each day in quiet reflection or meditation. Listen to what your heart truly desires, and allow that voice to guide your decisions. Surround yourself with support. Engage with communities or groups that uplift and inspire you. Share your experiences and learn from others on a similar path. Embrace the wisdom that comes with age. Your experiences, both good and bad, have shaped you into the strong, resilient person you are today. Trust that you have the inner strength to navigate any obstacle. Take small, meaningful steps towards your goals. Whether it's picking up a new hobby, reconnecting with old passions, or setting new professional objectives, every step forward brings you closer to your authentic self. Remember, midlife is a time of renewal and possibility. It's never too late to rewrite your story and live a life filled with purpose and joy. üåü #MidlifeJourney #SelfDiscovery #PurposefulLiving #WomenEmpowerment #InnerWisdom #LifeCoach #JungianLifeCoach #RelationshipCoach #PurposeCoach\n\nOne Thought Away from Happiness Watch your thoughts, they become words; Watch your words, they become actions; Watch your actions, they become habits; Watch your habits, they become your character; Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. This timeless wisdom encapsulates the profound impact of our thoughts on our lives. Imagine waking up and the first thought that crosses your mind is, \"Today is going to be a great day.\" This single positive thought sets the tone for your day, influencing your words, actions, and interactions. It‚Äôs a small shift but one that can lead to a cascade of positive outcomes. One thought truly can be the key to happiness. By consciously choosing positive thoughts, we lay the foundation for a happier, more fulfilling life. So, start your day with a positive thought, and watch how it transforms your destiny. What positive thought will you choose today? #Positivity #Mindset #PersonalGrowth #Happiness #Inspiration #DailyHabits #LifeLessons ______________________________________________________________________________ Hi there! I'm Gabriela, and I love sharing valuable lessons I've learned along my journey. Do you find posts like this helpful? Let me know by dropping a comment below or reposting. Let's grow and learn together! üåü\n\nThe journey is the destination. Life is not in the future; it is now! I've borrowed and repurposed these three questions from Mindvalley. At the end of every quarter, I review them as I look at my goals. These questions address desires innate to every human being: 1. How do I want to grow? Growth is essential. When we stop growing, we start dying. Our expansion allows others to grow. We are each individual incubators for the Universe. 2. What do I want to experience? We grow by pursuing happiness. Often, we neglect activities we enjoy, letting less meaningful tasks fill our time. To avoid this, I intentionally plan (e.g., scheduling on my calendar) what brings me joy. Dr. Daniel Amen's four circles guide my planning: Biological: Taking naps, eating healthy, playing pickleball, being in nature. Psychological: Morning routines with gratitude and quiet time, reading, writing, watching TV series and movies with complex characters, working towards goals. Social: Time with loved ones, sharing with others, staying in touch with friends. Spiritual: Daily personal meditation, shared meditation with my Beloved, expressing gratitude, helping those in need, random acts of kindness. 3. What do I want to contribute to? Our talents are meant to serve others. We give meaning to life by the difference we make. Besides these three questions, what else would you add?\n\nJust finished reading Clear Thinking by Shane Parrish. A quick synopsis... Find out what your common defaults are, and why you are so comfotable with them. Shane explains how they get in our own way, and we blame everyone else when it goes wrong. Learn that the world revolves... just not around you. There is a difference between self-confidence and ego. Once you learn how to delineate the two, you will make better decisions by defining a problem instead of finding the wrong solutions. Don't prepare for your predictions, but prepare for multiple futures! He also consults the Happiness Experts, and yes, \"The biggest regret people had ‚Äì worrying about things that never happened. Worrying wastes your life. Happiness is a choice, not a condition.\"\n\n‚ÄúEven a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.‚Äù ‚Äì Carl Jung This quote by Carl Jung delves into the intricate balance of emotions in life, emphasizing the importance of embracing both joy and sorrow with a patient and balanced perspective. \"Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.\" Jung acknowledges the inherent duality in human experience. He suggests that happiness gains its significance precisely because it contrasts with moments of darkness and sadness. The quote underscores that a complete life encompasses a range of emotions and experiences, rather than a constant state of euphoria. \"It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.\" Here, Jung advocates for an approach of patience and balance in dealing with life's ups and downs. The phrase \"take things as they come\" encourages acceptance of life's unpredictability. \"Equanimity\" refers to maintaining emotional balance, regardless of circumstances. Jung suggests that facing challenges with both patience and emotional equilibrium allows for a more harmonious existence. In essence, this quote reflects the philosophy of embracing life's diverse experiences and emotions. It acknowledges that true happiness gains depth from the contrast with moments of sadness, and that approaching life with patience and emotional balance leads to a more meaningful and fulfilled existence. It encourages us to find beauty and wisdom in the full spectrum of human emotions, allowing us to navigate life's journey with greater resilience and grace.

Wait don't judge yet ! Let me put forward my learnings from this amazing book! üòÄ Reading Susan Cain‚Äôs \"Bittersweet\" has been a transformative experience, challenging my understanding of happiness and sadness. The book delves into the profound beauty found in the melancholic side of life, an idea that resonates deeply with me. In our culture, there's a relentless push towards positivity, a narrative that suggests happiness must be constant and that sadness is something to be avoided or quickly overcome. But Cain argues, and I agree, that this perspective is fundamentally flawed. True fulfillment and emotional richness come from embracing the full spectrum of our emotions. Our sorrows and our joys are not opposites but are deeply intertwined, each giving meaning to the other. By acknowledging our pain and allowing ourselves to fully experience it, we enhance our capacity for joy and build deeper, more authentic connections with those around us. This perspective aligns with my own mindset and experiences. I've found that some of the most meaningful moments in my life have come during or after times of deep sadness. These moments of vulnerability and reflection have allowed me to grow, to appreciate the fleeting beauty of life, and to connect more genuinely with others. \"Bittersweet\" has reinforced for me that the pursuit of perpetual happiness is not only unrealistic but also diminishes the richness of our human experience. By embracing the bittersweet aspects of life, we can live more fully and authentically. It's not about seeking out sadness but rather accepting it as a natural and valuable part of our emotional landscape. Let's shift our focus from the superficial chase of constant happiness to a more balanced appreciation of life's complexities. Embracing both our joys and sorrows can lead to a more profound and fulfilling life. #Bittersweet #EmbraceSadness #TrueHappiness #EmotionalDepth #LifeLessons #HumanExperience #SusanCain #EmotionalIntelligence #MentalHealth\n\n‚ÄúI would have liked to have been happier‚Ä¶‚Äù said a fellow coach. ‚ÄúI said how old are you?‚Äù ‚Äù43 she said‚Äù What I found incredibly sad was her assumption that she was incapable of happiness. As if happiness was some form of foreign country, far, far away! Instead of a place of warmth and light within your heart. Today, I'm unveiling 10 steps to unlocking your full potential and discovering your miraculous self. 1) Believe in yourself. üåü 2) Set clear, achievable goals. 3) Embrace challenges as opportunities. 4) Surround yourself with positive influences. 5) Practice gratitude daily. 6) Stay curious and keep learning. 7) Take care of your physical health. 8) Meditate and reflect regularly. 9) Celebrate small victories. üéâ 10) Be kind to yourself and others. These steps won't solve everything instantly. They will require effort and dedication. But they will pave the way to a more fulfilling and joyful life. Optimism is a powerful tool. Use it. Your answers lie within, not outside of you."
