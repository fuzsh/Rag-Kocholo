        "text": "Craig D. Campbell Lake Conway Reservoir\n\nFor the most up-to-date lake level, visit the U.S. Geological Survey’s Lake Conway water level site.\n\nNOTE: Lake Conway recently experienced a fish kill due to low oxygen levels. Most fish affected were non-game fish (such as drum, shad and yellow bass), but some game fish also died. Fish kills like this are likely to happen throughout a lake renovation when water levels are low and temperatures are high. Daily limits are still lifted, and harvest of catches is highly encouraged. The AGFC thanks anglers for their support and patience. For more Lake Conway renovation project updates, see https://agfc.attn.tv/aQNV63-BKBEL\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Bates Field and Stream (501-470-1846) said water is back in the lake; it is about full after this week’s major rain event. “We were catching some crappie and catfish before it was real high,” they tell us. The crappie are expected to scatter out now until the water drops and they return back to their usual spots. Minnows are the bait now. “We’ve been selling the fire out of minnows. That’s what they’ve been catching the crappie on.”\n\nLake Conway has no creel or length limits while the lake is in its drawdown phase as part of the AGFC’s renovation project. All fish may be kept; in fact, it’s encouraged, hence the no limit regulation. Still chances to stock up on crappie and others for the freezer.\n\nAlso, the Lake Conway nursery pond is open for fishing with the AGFC stocking various sport fish there. The pond is more than 60 acres and has bass, crappie and bream.\n\nLittle Red River\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Greers Ferry Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website or by calling (501) 362-5150). Also check the Southwestern Power Administration website to see forecast generation schedule.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Mike Winkler of Little Red River Fly Fishing Trips (501-507-3688) said Thursday that the recent rain throughout the Ozarks was much needed and has made a significant impact. Greers Ferry Lake received 6.5 inches at the dam, with some areas getting even more. The lake is still filling up from this substantial rainfall.\n\nThis is great news for the Little Red River. With the extra water in the lake, the Army Corps of Engineers will be running more water during the hot summer days.\n\n“As of Thursday morning, the river is still muddy and hasn’t cleared up yet. However, I anticipate that by the weekend, the Corps of Engineers will start releasing more water, which should help clear the river.\n\n“Fishing will improve as the river clears. It’s too early to predict the generation schedule now that the lake has filled up, but check back next week for updates on whether we’re on a consistent generation pattern.\n\n“For now, the hot flies are pink San Juan Worms, Pheasant Tail Nymph, Guide’s Choice Hare’s Ear and Midges. Happy fishing!”\n\nGreers Ferry Lake For the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from Greers Ferry Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Tommy Cauley of Fishfinder Guide Service (501-940-1318) said the water level at Greers Ferry Lake is at back up to 462.58 feet msl, which is 0.04 feet above normal pool — Tuesday it was at 460.80 feet msl, to with runoff from rains it looks like it will come up some more going forward. Not much else has changed other than more and more fish are coming up on top schooling in different parts of the lake and rivers. Power generation has picked up with the Southwestern Power Administration generating 4-5 hours in afternoons, which will help oxygenation in the lake and the river below the dam as well. It will also help with the bite as well — all species of game fish are eating off and on at opportune times. Most species now are getting and staying out where they will summer at and staying on structure where you can really work on them.\n\nFor crappie, try super shallow and out to 30 feet and use jigs, minnows or crankbaits. A lot of fish are migrating to cooler areas in timber where a lot of bait will spend the summer, so fishing straight up and down is a must when seeking crappie. Walleye are eating in the main lake, and for the few that are left up rivers, drag a crawler or crankbait in 28-50 feet. Some walleye are following under big schools of white bass and hybrid bass — use a spoon for those. And, just like crappie, it’s time for a lot of them to head to the timber and hang out for the rest of summer into fall, as water is a little cooler and more bait fish are there as well. A spoon is best for that vertical fishing in 10-50 feet.\n\nHybrid striped bass and white bass are setting up in main lake for the summer, while a few are still roaming and schooling on top. For the ones that are set, use spoons, inline spinners, grubs and swimbaits in 25-60 feet. Catfish have started showing up more regularly, and the usual catfish baits are working in the lake and rivers. Some bream are shallow but most are still around 8-30 feet; crickets and crawlers are working fine for them, as well as inline spinners. Some loner black bass are shallow, but most are out or roaming shallow and schooling. Use Carolina rig, topwater lures, wake baits, drop-shots, crankbaits and spinnerbaits for best action super shallow out to 60 feet. Be safe and wear your life jacket.\n\nHarris Brake Lake\n\n(updated 7-11-2024) Harris Brake Lake Resort (501-889-2745) said anglers have been catching catfish. Most catches are on trotlines baited early in the morning, and they are catching cats in the 3-4-pound range. Bream are also biting well off the shoreline on crickets and redworms. Bass are reported to be biting for boat anglers near the big island in the lake. One angler fishing for bass also was catching some crappie — not many, but a few that were big in size and biting minnows.\n\nThe best fishing is very early in the morning 5-6 a.m. and wrapping up by 10 a.m., then back to it after 5 p.m. and into the evening.\n\nLake Overcup(updated 7-11-2024) John “Catfish” Banks at Overcup Landing off Arkansas Highway 9 said the lake’s water level is about 2 feet high from 5 inches of rain. Clarity is murky at best but clearing quickly. Surface temperature is around 85 degrees.\n\nBass are doing well on Cajun Spin and buzzbaits and plastic worms.\n\nCrappie are in the deeper water; nobody has been fishing for them lately.\n\nCatfish are doing well on trotlines and jugs using bass minnows and bream.\n\nBream were doing well on crickets and redworms before all this water. One family came out and caught 130 in about 5 hours.\n\nBrewer Lake\n\n(update 7-18-2024) David Hall at Dad’s Bait Shop (501-289-2210), a 24/7 self-serve bait shop at the lake, said “The lake is sitting at normal water level, and a lot of people are coming throughout the day. Anglers have been having the best luck for crappie and catfish around the dam area. Bass fishing has been reported to be at its best in the late afternoon or evening time of the day. For crappie it seems that tri color jigs are doing the trick for most out on the water, with a white rooster tail for bass.\n\nLake Maumelle\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) WestRock Landing in Roland (501-658-5598) said the surface water temperature has consistently been around the 86- to 88-degree mark. The largemouth bass bite is good this week, and several black bass caught Tuesday night in WestRock’s weekly tournament were large fish.\n\nAnglers report that largemouth bass are schooling in the mornings and evenings. They can be found shallow in the mornings and evenings in 2-4 feet, whole other are being found deeper, in the 12-20 feet range. Try points and drop-offs and use drop-shots, Texas-rigged worms, topwater lures and crankbaits. Spotted bass (Kentucky bass) are still fair. They’re reported being fond on points in 8-20 feet as well as around drop-offs. Try drop-shots and crankbaits. Josh Jeffers and Josh Baker caught a whopping 20.67 pounds of bass on Tuesday night to win the tournament, while Carter James and Zach Duff were second with 16.03 pounds and a Big Bass of 7.33 pounds. Besides that Big Bass, three bass weighed 6.55, 5.60 and 5.32 pounds.\n\nThe crappie bite remains good. Reports have them suspended around brush anywhere from 16-21 feet with decent size to them. Use jigs and minnows. Bream are fair, and the bluegill continue to bite well. Use jigs and minnows. No reports on white bass or catfish.\n\nArkansas River at Morrilton\n\nFor the real-time water flow at the Ormond Lock and Dam and Morrilton stage level, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nLittle Maumelle River\n\n(update 7-18-2024) Ray Hudson at River Valley Marina (501-517-1250) said the Little Maumelle was at normal water pool, and that the water is clear as well as getting up to high temperatures throughout the day. “Catfish have branched away from the moving water since the rainfall has stopped and now are being caught under docks with stink bait or hot dogs” he said. He went on to discuss the lures that were working best for bass any time of the day, which were shad-colored spinnerbaits. Nothing of bigger size has been reported, with mostly 12- to 15-inch fish being caught regularly. Some were also using lizards and catching a few. Bream were being caught, also; they were up shallow and biting crickets and worms in 2-3 feet of water.\n\nArkansas River (Maumelle Pool) For the real-time water flow at the Toad Suck Lock and Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nArkansas River (Little Rock Area Pools)\n\nFor the real-time water flow at the Murray Lock and Dam and David D. Terry Lock and Dam, as well as the Little Rock pool stage level, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Fish ’N Stuff (501-834-5733) had no new reports.\n\nPeckerwood Lake\n\n(updated 7-11-2024) Donna Mulherin at Herman’s Landing (501-626-6899) said anglers say that “right now the hot species of the lake are the catfish and bream” As for crappie, some are having success trolling and others are spider-rigging underwater structure for bites.\n\nCatfish are biting hot dogs and liver, and also some live bait such as shiners, shad and bream are great to use.\n\nEarly morning and evening topwater is working now for the black bass. Donna also said, “Right now it seems that the bass anglers are the ones that are rarely left empty-handed.”\n\nBream have seen an increase in overall activity, the full moon playing its part. Crickets and worms are the most popular bait for bream.\n\n“We’re level full and a little dingy, but not that bad. About normal for Peckerwood,” she said of the water conditions.\n\nWhite River(updated 7-18-2024) Cotter Trout Dock (870-435-6525) said, “The week of brutal heat was broken by a memorable rainstorm. We needed some rain — we got a lot! By the time you see this report, the river will be pretty much back to clear and normal here in the Cotter area and upstream to Bull Shoals Dam. It will take a little longer to recover\n\ndownriver past Calico Rock (40-plus miles downstream from Cotter.) The remainder of this coming week will bring milder temperatures.\n\n“Bull Shoals Lake is recorded at 662.59 feet msl at this moment and rising. The release schedule will probably continue to be low even as the lake rises because of the flooding downstream, so wading and bank fishing will continue to be viable, taking extra care due to some debris issues.\n\n“Take advantage of the easy access while we have it. Keeping a john boat floating and not grounded in very low water takes lots of concentration and skill, so please be considerate of all your fellow anglers, however they choose to fish.\n\n“Bright-colored baits will gain the most attention from the rainbows in the coming days. Sunrise and white Power Eggs will continue to be a favorite this week for both shore fishers and anglers in boats. The browns always beg for sculpins and soft-shell crawdads (keep the Rebel Wee Craw handy). Pull out your hopper flies; we are getting into the best grasshopper time of the year and the trout are looking for them.\n\n“We have a terrific bunch of folks at Arkansas Game and Fish Commission taking care of our trout fishery, plus the river guides and local residents who care so much about our resources, so keep anglin’ on the White and we’ll see you on the river.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Dave McCulley, owner of Jenkins Fishing Service in Calico Rock, said, “We saw ‘normal’ water levels during the week with depths as much as 8 feet or more and dropping to around 4 feet. Fishing was steady drift-fishing with Uncommon Baits UV eggs and corn with or without sliver inline spinners. On Sunday we saw depths fewer than 3 feet most of the day. Fishing was amazing using artificial lures such as quarter-ounce spoons in nickel and/or gold, Rapala Countdowns CD5 in silver or anything with a blade that provides a flash.\n\n“The storms Tuesday night/Wednesday morning caused the river to flood. As of 4:30 p.m., the river at Calico Rock was at 17.6 feet and still rising, while Norfork has crested. Hopefully by Saturday the river will be clear enough to fish.\n\n“We did receive on stocking of more than 1,000 rainbows at the Calico Rock boat ramp and another 1,000-plus just upriver at the Chessmond Ferry boat ramp.\n\nBull Shoals Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Bull Shoals Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Fishing guide Del Colvin at Bull Shoals Lake (815-592-4302) said Wednesday night that lake level was back up to around 662 feet msl, about a 3 feet since last weekend rise and still coming in. “Watch out for debris, and hopefully we can keep up with courtesy ramps. The Army Corps of Engineers has been running some water in the afternoon and evenings, and the water temperature is around 85 degrees, give or take. It’s warmer in the stained water.”\n\nBass are set up on summer areas and patterns. Shad are spread out from the back off the creeks out to the main lake. Check deeper water, points, ledges, drop-offs and channel swings and saddles. Get up early, or if it’s cloudy, rainy and windy hit the surface with topwater! ”Smaller sizes are working best for me: Zara Spook, Pop-R, Lucky Craft Gunfish and wake baits in shad patterns.\n\n“As the sun gets up, a try a 2.8 swimbait, especially if there’s wind, or Flutter Spoon — that will keep the bite going. Once the sun gets up a lot the fish will move out over deep water. You can follow them out there and try a drop-shot Robo Worm or shad -shaped worm or Tater Shad.\n\n“If we get runoff, I’ll powerfish covering water. Try a spinnerbait and Chatterbait, Whopper Plopper or buzz bait if it’s windy and cloudy, or a frog/toad if it’s sunny. A frog or punch mulch mats. You can still catch ’em on points with small Jewel Peewee Jig in green pumpkin orange or a tube or shaky head in 10-20 feet early on, then try 25-30 feet. Keep boat out and use deep, long casts. There’s lot of activity around the 30 feet range for brush pile hopping. You can also go up there with a big worm, a Beaver or Salt Craw early or late. The shallower brush piles closer to deep water in less than 25-30 feet are holding some fish.”\n\n“Overall, summer patterns are here and suspended fish in large groups are roaming. If you can find them with the front looker, you can get right in a hurry.”\n\nDel regularly posts new YouTube videos.

We’re pulling night crawler harnesses in 30-33 feet slowly (.8 to .9 mph) with 2-ounce bottom bouncers on the sides of primary and secondary points. Fishing with No. 1.5 Smile Butterfly Blades in gold or orange, and chartreuse with an orange bead pattern is working. Also still just a No. 4 split shot and No. 2 Aberdeen hook and nightcrawler, worked slowly around groups of fish or on deeper sides of brush piles, will catch some. Lots of fish in the 16- to 17-inch size are still being caught at this time (to keep walleye, they must be 18 or more inches).\n\nSpooning with a three-quarter-ounce white spoon in water off main lake points in 28-35 feet will also get some fish.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Crappie 101 Guide Service (870-577-2045) says crappie seem to be moving deeper and are definitely pickier as the jig bite has slowed down a lot. Minnows and 4-pound line help, but they are still finicky. Just keep moving until you find fish that will cooperate.\n\nNorfork Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Norfork Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Lou Gabric at Hummingbird Hideaway Resort (870-492-5113)\n\nsaid had no new reports, but he posts fishing reports nearly every day to his blog on the Hummingbird Hideaway Resort webpage.\n\nBeaver Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Beaver Lake Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Jon Conklin with FishOn Guide Service (479-233-3474) said Beaver Lake has dropped to 1120.21 which is about 1 feet below normal level. Water temperature is around 90 degrees or so.\n\n“Fishing is in the summer pattern, as it has been for last month or so. What that means is a thermocline is setting up. Knowing where that is at is very important on pattering Beaver Lake in the summer. If you know the thermocline is at 25 feet, well, that is where you need to be fishing near or above that level. This really helps shrink the lake into manageable areas to scout and fish. Trolling is the best method this time of the year, especially for crappie and walleye.\n\n“On that note, trolling for crappie is good most days. Invest in some cranks that touch 15 feet when trolled — troll at or near 1.8 mph. One guide tip from me is to zig-zag. This will speed up and slow down the baits and will, a lot of times, trigger a strike.\n\n“Trolling for walleye has been my go-to the last week. We have been catching some nice fish on trolled Flicker Shad. Also, using crawlers on bottom bouncers is a great way to catch walleye.\n\n“Stripers are good and you must fish very early or late to catch them. Good areas are Starkey and all points on the north end of the lake. Trust electronics! It’s very important to understand what you are looking at. Stripers move by the hour.\n\n“Catfish are good on all methods. The spawn is over and the bite is on.\n\n“Lots of boats on the lake. Be careful. We had a drowning accident last week. Wear life jackets!\n\n“Stay safe and hydrated, and get out early or late and catch some fish. Good luck!”\n\nVisit Jon’s Facebook page for the latest updates, FishOn Guide Service Goshen AR.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Southtown Sporting Goods (479-443-7148) said, “The water conditions are very good for summertime.” Stripers are the number one species being caught on a day-to-day basis. Blue minnows and shad are the best bait for this time of year. He said, “Bass is a hit or miss, but if you can find a cooler day in the week, that would be the time to get out there.” People have reported catching crappie on brush piles if they can find them, with most using LiveScope.\n\nBeaver Tailwater\n\n(updated 7-11-2024) Guide Austin Kennedy (479-244-0039) says fishing these past two weeks has been pretty good. You may have to move around a bit, but the bite does pick up as you do so. Most fish have been caught between Houseman Access and the U.S. Highway 62 bridge. The trout have been very responsive to Pautzke Fire Worms, fished on bottom, with slight movement. This is also the bait and presentation of choice when drift-fishing. Also Fire Bait, with light terminal tackle, has also produced nice numbers. You can also try pulling crankbaits in the deeper water for some bigger fish.\n\nThe water temperature has been up and down, but the Army Corps of Engineers is releasing water to keep the tailwater cool. There are still some here-and-there walleye being caught. Most catches are in the deeper holes, jigging with soft plastics.\n\n“As summer in upon us, remember to stay hydrated, wear loose cool clothing and protect yourself from the sun. Hope you all are able to get out and catch some fish!”\n\nFollow Austin’s fishing Facebook page (Busch Mountain Fishing Guide Service) for regular updates.\n\nLake Fayetteville(updated 7-11-2024) Lake Fayetteville Boat Dock (479-444-3476) says catfish have started moving around after the rain earlier in the week and anglers reported a few bites Wednesday. Bream are still good on redworms. A couple of anglers were fishing them with crickets too, but reported that redworms were working better. If you know what you’re doing on Lake Fayetteville with the crappie and their usual locales, you can catch them — regulars reported a few smaller crappie being caught. Black bass have been really good this week on soft plastic worms and on a little topwater, but mostly the plastics.\n\nLake Charles\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Shelly Jeffrey at Lake Charles State Park (870-878-6595) said anglers are still catching catfish from the shoreline on worms and smallish bream and other sunfish are still good from the shore as well. The surface water temperature earlier in the week was as cool as it’s been recorded in a while, 79 degrees. The clarity is the usual murky and the water level is high.\n\nBream will bite worms, crickets and jigs. They’re related to brush piles, stumps and rocky points.\n\nBlack bass have been fair. Try soft plastic worms and fish in shady areas around brush or rock.\n\nCatfish are loving worms.\n\nNo reports on crappie or white bass.\n\nShelly suggests anglers pencil in Aug. 1-7 as the best days upcoming to fish Lake Charles based on “moon” times. Good days should be Aug. 16-22, she added. The park’s visitor center has your fishing needs.\n\nLake Poinsett\n\n(updated 7-11-2024) Jonathan Wagner at Lake Poinsett State Park said that even with the heat and rain left over from Beryl, Lake Poinsett has had numerous anglers out and about. Bream are still biting pretty well, according to reports. Anglers are mostly using live bait of crickets or worms. Bass and crappie continue to be catch-and-release, but reports of catches have been decent for the crappie; bass, not so much. Anglers have reported several-pound crappie and have expressed excitement for them eventually to be able to keep them. Primarily, anglers have been fishing early mornings and into the evenings (even with the mosquitoes).\n\nSpring River\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Mark Crawford with springriverfliesandguides.com (870-955-8300) said water levels are at 350 cfs and water clarity is mostly clear. Plenty of rain over the last few months can change river conditions quickly. This week the river is looking great and has been back down to an average flow rate. With the heat, it has been very refreshing on the river.\n\nWith the heat of summer on, fishing early and late in the day is key. If you’re hot and miserable, the fish are too. The rainbows have been hitting great with plenty of stockers and an occasional big ’bow rolling up. Seeing a few big brown trout, not many. Hopper droppers can work great when water is clear, with nymphs, worms or Y2Ks as the dropper. On the off-water days an olive Woolly or a Y2K/Mop Fly can work well. On the tough days, it’s all about getting the fly to the bottom.\n\nSmallmouth bass have been the fish to chase lately. The high water makes it tough to get the bite on at times; the trick is to fish deep and slow for them — down on the bottom of the river in all the many rocks the Spring River has. “Lead Eye or Cone Head Woolies, Skull Heads and crayfish patterns always work. On good days, Clouser and baitfish patterns can be a blast. If we fish topwater, we usually run a dropper. Plenty of fish will hit it looking at the popper.\n\n“Saturdays have been busy with floaters. The prime time to fish is through the week and on Sunday.\n\n“Plenty of rain lately — it is summer and it will dry out. As the heat turns on, don’t forget the cold waters of the Spring River! Fifty-eight degrees all year!”\n\nCheck out Mark’s blog for the latest river conditions on the Spring River on his website linked above.\n\nWhite River\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time gauge level and flow from the White River stages at Batesville, Newport and Augusta and all other sites within the White River basin in Arkansas, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nMillwood Lake For the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from Millwood Lake Dam, visit the Corps Little Rock office website.\n\nNOTE: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District began lowering Millwood Lake on July 15 to improve shoreline vegetation and promote sediment compaction. The drawdown will expose an extensive area of shoreline for revegetation to allow the planting of millet, which promotes water quality, increases fish production and provides habitat for wintering waterfowl. The lake will be held near an elevation of 257.2 feet until Sept. 13, 2024, when it will be raised 6 inches. The lake will be raised to the top of normal conservation pool of 259.2 feet on Nov. 1, 2024. Boaters are urged to wear a life jacket and exercise caution during the drawdown, as submerged stumps and shallow areas will be more prominent, especially in boat lanes. Real-time lake-level information can be found on the USACE Little Rock smartphone app, which can be found in most app stores. For more information, contact the Millwood Project Office at 870-898-3343.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Mike Siefert at Millwood Lake Guide Service said Tuesday that Millwood elevation was falling and the lake level was 12 inches below normal pool at 258.2 feet msl. The lake falling due to the Army Corps of Engineers drawdown (see note above). Millwood Lake Dam was releasing about 8,850 cfs and the tailwater is holding near 236 feet and stable. Check the most recent lake level of Millwood Lake on the guide service’s website linked above, Army Corps of Engineers website, updated gate release changes and inflow rates with rising and falling lake levels. Watch for random floaters and broken timber during any navigation on Little River and Millwood.\n\nSurface temperature is stable, ranging 87 degrees early to 93 degrees later in the day along Little River, depending on location and the time of day. Clarity along Little River continues improving with decreased river current. Normal to moderate stain is seen in most locations; some areas further up Little River are the heaviest, with river clarity ranging 10-15 inches in visibility depending on location. Clarity of oxbows will vary widely from normal stained to good visibility from 20-30 inches, and we observed fair visibility in a few wind- and current-protected areas like McGuire Oxbow up to 3 feet clarity. Clarity and visibility can change dramatically on Millwood in just a few hours with high winds, gate discharge, rain or thunderstorms.\n\nMike had these specifics on the fishing at Millwood:\n\n* Not much change over last few weeks, except it’s HOT in southwest Arkansas folks. The best bite of the day for largemouth bass continues to be from dawn to around 9 a.m. During midday in this heat of 90-100 degrees, until dusk, the bass are dropping off the flats into the deeper sections of creek channel depths and mouths of creeks dumping into Little River where the thermocline resides between 10-15 feet. For the past few weeks, bass have been active early up to 2-4 pounds on topwaters baits, and cloud cover mornings continuing having the best activity over the past few weeks, especially early at dawn. Feeding activity levels have slowed with the increase of surface temperatures in the mid- to low 90s range over the past couple weeks during the heat of the day. Best baits at early morning continue to be buzzbaits, soft plastic frogs, Cordell Crazy Shads, StutterSteps and Jitterbugs near pads and vegetation. Best buzzbait colors continue to be Hot Firecracker Chartreuse, Bleeding Bream, black or Hot Cotton Candy. The best buzzbait bite is by working across flats near creek channel swings, with stumps and laydowns, and around lily pads StutterSteps, Cordell Crazy Shads, Arbogast Jitterbugs and Moss Bosses continue working in the slop and are all getting fair to good reactions from largemouths in creek channels near stumps, cypress trees and lily pads. Topwater activity levels drop off after 9-10 a.m. with the high noon sun baking down. Very little top water activity has been seen after noon and until dusk.\n\nAfter the topwater activity diminishes, a fairly decent and random bite can be had near creek dumps into Little River with a custom painted, shad pattern, shallow-running square bill crankbait, 2.0 & 3.0 & S-cranks or Bill Lewis Echo 1.75s to draw a few good random reactions by banging/deflecting them off stumps from 8-10 feet deep in creek channels and points. Bass around 14-15 inches in length are randomly responding to crankbaits in shad and bream colors. Best color of cranks in the oxbows, like the 2.0 S-cranks, and Echo 1.75 square bills, have been the Bold Bluegill, Millwood Magic and Ghosts. Increasing size up to a three-quarter-ounce Rat-L-Trap, fished much slower and deeper, will draw a few random hits during late mornings in creek channels and across points converging with Little River. Best colors of Traps over the past week or so have been Millwood Magic and White Smoke.\n\n* White bass continue hitting vertical-jigged half-ounce to 1-ounce slab spoons in Little River between Jack’s Isle and the first entrance into Mud Lake, and also in Hurricane Creek, from 10-15 feet deep. Little River has improved clarity and bite over the past couple weeks and the reduced current has clarity much improved on primary or secondary points. White bass are roaming back down Little River to their summer spots in the main lake, but pausing on these points in the process, and roaming in and out of creek dumps, too. With the drawdown in effect, many whites are found in close proximity to the Kentucky and largemouth bass, all feeding on threadfin shad.\n\nHeavy three-quarter-ounce Cordell Hammered Spoons, Kastmaster chrome/blue Spoons with white bucktails, or Bomber Fat Free Guppy or Fingerling crankbaits, and the Bill Lewis MR-6 Crankbaits both in Citrus Shad, Tennessee Shad and Millwood Magic colors will draw reactions. Little George’s, Rocket Shads and red/white Rooster Tails continue working. Random and broken schools are pausing their annual migration back down river and stopping in Little River where primary or secondary points intersect with creek mouths dumping into the river. With reduced current, their activity levels have improved reacting to crankbaits and spoons.\n\n* Crappie continue to improve with water clarity improving in many locations. Planted brush piles in Pugh Slough, Horseshoe, Bee Lake, Millwood State Park or Saratoga continue to hold nice 12- to 15-inch crappie, and have given up some nice 2-pound slabs. The crappie are best using minnows one day, and jigs the next, or jigs tipped with a minnow, in planted brush piles at 10-16 feet depth. Best colors for jigs over the past few weeks have been chartreuse/blue, chartreuse/black, Monkey Milk or Electric Chicken. Cordell smoke-colored Grubs with a chartreuse tip tail on a light wire jighead will pick up a few extra bites.\n\n* We are getting good reports of large Mason bream and bluegills biting well at the Millwood State Park and Jack’s Isle over the past week using redworms and crickets. These aggressive bream were biting from the bank and the floating dock in 4-8 feet depth.\n\n* No report on catfish.\n\nLake Columbia\n\nNo reports.\n\nLake Greeson Tailwater\n\nFor the most updated Narrows Dam generation schedule from SWEPCO, click here.\n\nLake Greeson\n\nFor the most updated lake level at Lake Greeson, click here.\n\nNo reports.\n\nDeGray Lake\n\nFor the most updated lake level at DeGray Lake, click here.\n\nNo reports.\n\nDe Queen Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from De Queen Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nDierks Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from Dierks Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nLake Catherine Tailwater (Below Carpenter Dam)\n\nFor weekly flow releases from Carpenter Dam, visit www.entergy.com/hydro\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Shane Goodner, owner of Catch’em All Guide Service, reports that water temperature below Carpenter Dam is 65 degrees with stained conditions in the tailrace. Both lakes Hamilton and Catherine are at normal summertime pool. Entergy has scheduled several days of lengthy generation time, which has lowered the tailrace water temperature and aided greatly in the reduction of grass and moss growth. Below Carpenter Dam, fly-fishermen can still wade to areas that hold numbers of trout and can have had some success casting micro-jigs in white or black under a strike indicator. This presentation perfectly matches the injured shad drawn through the turbines from Lake Hamilton. San Juan Worms offer feeding trout a different look and will often work equally well when fished in the same manner. Trout Magnets should not be overlooked by fly-anglers and often make the difference between a successful outing and an unsuccessful one. Bank fishermen using waxworms or mealworms cast with a small bobber or fished just off the bottom with a marshmallow floater can catch rainbows. Boaters can anchor in and around sandbars and rock structure and catch trout using small inline spinners such as a Rooster Tail or Mepps Spinner in brown or silver colors.\n\nConditions are favorable now for effective trolling against the current. Catching a limit of rainbow trout in July should be considered a good day on the water, as the bite is very inconsistent and short in duration.\n\nNumbers of male and female walleye remain to rest from the long-over spawning season and feed before making the move downstream to the main body of Lake Catherine. These fish can be caught by trolling shallow-running crankbaits against the current on both sides of the river below the dam. Shad or crayfish imitations work best, as both of these are present in large numbers in the lake and offer game fish a solid food source all throughout the year.\n\nDespite the safer conditions and warmer weather, it is extremely important to remember that fish in the tailrace have proven difficult to catch this entire year. Trout can be caught but not in the numbers that were expected in past years. Normal pool levels will bring a more consistent bite from the rainbow trout population. Patience is a must this year for anglers to have success due to the flooding and heavy flows the lake has experienced.\n\nCatfish spawned in the tailrace during June from the bridge to the dam and some fish were caught on cut bait fished on the bottom. These fish will offer anglers a hearty fight and some wonderful table fare.\n\nThe heat of summer brings striper action closer to Carpenter Dam as these large predator fish search for prey and cooler temperatures. Alabama rigs and large topwater lures work well when the turbines are running, which is a key ingredient for success when attempting to catch these wary predators. Entergy is scheduling a weekend release below Carpenter Dam from noon until 5 p.m. on select Saturday and Sunday mornings, which is keeping tailrace temperatures down and reducing moss growth that is rampant below the dam. The fishing report will be much the same each week during the summertime. Action will change dramatically in mid-November when the rainbow trout stocking schedule begins again.\n\nAlways wear a life jacket when on the water and remember to follow all park and boating regulations. Pick up after yourself as the number of trash cans are limited in this area. Always cooperate with all wildlife officials and law enforcement.\n\nLake Dardanelle\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ outflow and gauge level reports from Dardanelle, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Seth Boone, superintendent at Lake Dardanelle State Park (479-890-7474), reported that Lake Dardanelle has had some tough fishing the last few weeks with the heat and low water. Black bass seem to be deeper and more likely to be caught while breaking on shad. White bass seem to be doing well around shad spawns in shallow water. Anglers appear to be catching them on spoons and jigs. Catfish are doing OK on chicken liver and worms in the deeper water. “Crappie, I have had no word on,” he said. “Bream are doing well on crickets and worms.”\n\nLake Hamilton\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Capt. Darryl Morris of Family Fishing Trips (501-844-5418) had no new reports.\n\nLake Nimrod\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow reports from Nimrod Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nLake Ouachita\n\nFor the current lake level at Blakely Dam, click here.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Todd Gadberry at Mountain Harbor Resort and Spa (870-867-2191/800-832-2276 out-of-state) said black bass are fair. Try a topwater bait near main lake and secondary points or a Texas-rigged Ole Monster worm near brush.\n\nWalleye are good and being caught on nightcrawlers near structure with a drop-shot rig or a minnow-like jig. Stripers are still good. These fish are being caught in the eastern portions of the lake and can be caught on umbrella rigs or live bait. Bream are very good and are being caught on crickets and worms in the 15- to 25-feet range. Crappie are fair. Try minnows or small jigs over structure in the 20- to 40-feet range. For catfish, try stink bait or cut bait on a rod-and-reel setup in the 15- to 25-feet range, especially near structure and brush.\n\nWater temperature on Wednesday was ranging 82-86 degrees. Water clarity is clear. Lake level is at 575.89 feet msl, dropping a little more from last week’s level and now more than 2 feet below normal pool. Call the Mountain Harbor fishing guides (Mike Wurm, 501-622-7717, or Chris Darby, 870-867-7822) for more information.\n\nBlue Mountain Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow reports from Blue Mountain Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website."
