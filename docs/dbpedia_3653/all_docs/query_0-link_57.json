        "text": "After millennia of natural fluctuations, human water use has pushed Great Salt Lake into structural decline. Since 2020, the lake has lost just over one million acre-feet of water each year (Fig. 4), much more than predicted by current hydrographic models20,60,61. If this rate of water loss continues, the lake would be on track to disappear in the next five years. The lake is now 10 feet and 6.9 million acre-feet below its minimum healthy level, which has only been attained once since 2002 (Fig. 4)51.\n\nSaline lakes are highly vulnerable to water overuse because they depend on a delicate balance between streamflow and evaporation. Consequently, there is a strong relationship between the area of irrigated agriculture in a saline lake’s watershed and the severity of its shrinkage53. Agriculture began affecting Great Salt Lake levels in the mid 1800s38. However, it wasn’t until the 1900s that humans became the dominant force controlling the lake3,23,59. Federal and state construction of dams, canals, and pipelines in the 1900s allowed more of the watershed’s natural runoff to be diverted for agricultural, industrial, and municipal use3,38,53. These subsidized water projects led to unsustainable water consumption42,63 and plummeting lake levels through the 1960s1,3. An extremely uncommon wet period in the 1980s temporarily refilled the lake1,23, but since peaking in 1987, it has been in steady decline (Fig. 4).\n\nOver the last three years, the lake has received less than a third of its natural streamflow because of excessive water diversions (Fig. 5)60. In 2022, the lake dropped to a record elevation of 4188’—the lowest level on the state’s contingency charts10,18,64. The depletion of water is even more severe than it appears because groundwater is not included in these estimates. Approximately 26 million acre-feet have been lost from the lake itself, but twice that amount may have been lost from the aquifers around the lake due to water table drop65. These empty aquifers could slow the rate of rebound after runoff is increased.\n\nLike most saline lakes, Great Salt Lake has a large watershed crossing multiple jurisdictions (Fig. 6)2,30,68. The 23-million-acre watershed is divided into four main basins, with the Bear, Jordan, and Weber watersheds contributing almost all surface water inflow (Fig. 6). Irrigated agriculture covers 1.4 million acres or 6% of the watershed. 63% of this agricultural land occurs in Utah, 31% in Idaho, 5% in Wyoming, and 1% in Nevada. Urban development covers 0.7 million acres or 3% of the watershed area, with 93% occurring in Utah.\n\nAgriculture dominates water use in the Great Salt Lake watershed (Fig. 5)25,26,69. Irrigation of alfalfa and other crops directly accounts for around three quarters of total consumptive water use plus 5-10% indirectly through storage and transport losses such as reservoir evaporation1,3,66. Mineral extraction from the lake itself represents another 9% of water use (Fig. 7). Cities and industry account for the final 9% of consumptive water use, of which 90% is outdoor water use (irrigation for lawns and other decorative plants). The remainder of the consumptive use comes from thermoelectric power production, mining, and other industrial processes25,70. Indoor water use has little direct effect on lake level because ~95% is returned after wastewater treatment, though the storage, conveyance, and treatment of water used indoors does cause consumptive losses and degradation of water quality25,71.\n\nClimate change is a secondary contributor to the decline of Great Salt Lake. Human greenhouse gas emissions have caused ~4°F of warming in northern Utah since 1900 and exacerbated drought in the southwestern U.S.66,72–74. This climate change has reduced runoff to Great Salt Lake and increased evaporation, accounting for ~9% of the lake’s decline based on current estimates2,23,43,66. Streamflow is projected to decrease in the future, making water conservation even more important66,75,76. We need to plan for a drier Utah.\n\nOver the past century, the fields of global hydrology and water security have generated important insights about resilient water management38,42,49,75,117–119. This includes a large body of literature on Great Salt Lake and similar saline lakes around the world (see references at the end of the report)1,30,68. In this section, we summarize a few of the general approaches we find most relevant to Great Salt Lake.\n\nLearn > Conserve > Augment\n\nWater scarcity is the difference between demand and supply120. Our first instinct when faced with scarcity is often to increase supply through “hard-path” solutions like dams and pipelines. However, experience from around the world has shown that augmentation (increasing supply) should be a last resort118,121. Sustainable water management recommends the following prioritized steps to strengthen water security in a given region42,122:\n\nLearn: Carefully study the physical, biological, and social dimensions of water\n\nConserve: Systematically eliminate water waste and overuse\n\nAugment: Increase supply as little as necessary after exhausting steps 1 and 2\n\nThere are many ecological and economic reasons to follow this sequence. Large-scale water infrastructure is extremely expensive, and water projects are notorious for “cost overruns, benefit shortfalls, and the systematic underestimation of risk”123. Even when projects are completed as intended, they are often scaled incorrectly because of inadequate consideration of hydrological variability and changes in water demand63,124. This can cause water overallocation, leaving a community with more problems than before the project123,125,126. This is especially true in a world of rapid land use and climate change, where many water projects are obsolete before completion43. Finally, water augmentation in one region requires water depletion in another, shifting rather than resolving scarcity31,49,127.\n\nRather than increasing supply, it is almost always more cost effective and resilient to decrease demand39,122,132. This is a hydrological application of the principle of living within our means. Conservation initiatives such as water pricing, water markets, and consumption caps often achieve their goals ahead of schedule and under budget39,46,133. For example, a recent analysis of water use in the Great Salt Lake watershed estimated that conservation could return adequate water to the lake for a total cost of $14 to $96 million—$5 to $32 per person in the watershed132. The use of open water markets where users can freely buy and sell available water could decrease the conservation cost even further to $6 to $48 million—$2 to $16 per person39,132. Even if these estimates are overly optimistic by an order of magnitude, they blow augmentation proposals’ return-on-investment out of the water134.\n\nThe Great Salt Lake watershed provides multiple examples of hard-path water compromises, including Bangerter’s pumps, a federally-subsidized and oversized reservoir system whose storage and conveyance losses equal total municipal water use, and interbasin transfers that are accelerating the decline of the Colorado River while inducing local consumption63,71,128–130. Thankfully, wise managers and citizens have helped us dodge many silver bullet “solutions,” including persistent proposals for new reservoirs and pipelines such as the Bear River Development and repeated attempts to fill in our watershed’s freshwater lakes to reduce evaporation3,71,131.\n\nNature is the model; naturalness is the goal\n\nThe foremost law in ecology is “Nature knows best,” or the law of unintended consequences135. This law has two major implications for water management. First, the more altered and artificial a system is, the more rigid and high maintenance it tends to be136. Second, more modification creates more negative tradeoffs and compromises71,119. The Great Salt Lake ecosystem is highly modified and managed6,137. From streamflow inputs to wetland water levels, almost every aspect of its hydrology and chemistry is controlled by people (Fig. 13). These changes were made with good intentions, but they contribute to the lake’s current crisis1,3,106,138.\n\nA return to a “pristine” pre-human state is neither desirable nor possible119, but we should use naturalness as an overarching management goal when implementing future changes136. This approach can increase the chances of success, decrease the likelihood of side effects, and lay the groundwork for a self-regulating system that is resilient to future natural and human pressures118,139,140. In practice, this principle should inform goals about the amount and timing of streamflow to the lake and the area of conservation buffer needed around the lake to allow natural fluctuation without undue infrastructure damage. For example, the target elevation range for the lake should be increased to include the lake’s long-term natural level (4207 feet)3,51. By restoring more natural hydrology to Great Salt Lake, levels will rise and there will be major co-benefits for water and habitat quality in the upstream rivers, lakes, and wetlands (e.g., Utah Lake, Jordan River, Weber River, Logan River, and Farmington Bay)71,136,141.\n\nA lake-first approach to water stewardship\n\nWater for the environment has historically been relegated to last place in western water law142–145. However, putting nature last neglects the fact that human flourishing depends on environmental health78,88,146. Shifting water among different users may treat symptoms of overuse, but it does not resolve the root problem124,133. To create a sound foundation for our state, we need to permanently allocate the lake its fair share of water. The water law concept of prior appropriations—first in time, first in right—could be highly useful to this end. The original beneficial use of water in our region is the lake itself and the soils, aquifers, and river networks that make up its watershed. As responsible stewards, we need to establish a binding environmental flow right for Great Salt Lake133. This right should be based on both lake level and annual streamflow, to avoid long-term catastrophe and ensure annual ecosystem health51.\n\nThough recognizing the lake’s water right decreases the amount of water available for human use in a given year, it benefits water users by decreasing uncertainty124. For example, after the lake’s share is met, remaining water could be distributed based on prior appropriation or a proportional reduction applied to all shares equally, as was recently approved in Nevada147. The prior option has the advantage of aligning with current water law in Utah, but the latter option is more equitable and could create more certainty and economic benefit for a greater number of users, particularly if coupled with water markets132. Certainty is extremely valuable when making agricultural and natural resources decisions, and water users might be supportive of changes that increase certainty even if it means less total water124.\n\nRecognizing Great Salt Lake’s right to exist fills another need that is less tangible but perhaps more important. This respectful approach to God’s creation is in line with the religious and cultural teachings of the Indigenous and immigrant peoples of Utah148–151. There is no better way to honor the legacy and foresight of our ancestors and Creator than acting as wise stewards of the watershed entrusted us.\n\n1. Baxter, B. K. & Butler, J. K.
