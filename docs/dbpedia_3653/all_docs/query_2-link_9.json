        "text": "Hood Canal Bridge live updates\n\nFind out if the Hood Canal Bridge is open to traffic and other real-time alerts at the Hood Canal Bridge status page.\n\nHood Canal Bridge common questions\n\nWhy does WSDOT open the bridge for one boat which results in traffic backups?\n\nWSDOT is following federal law. Under maritime rules, boats get the right-of-way over vehicles when bridges block the path of marine traffic. We understand it seems counterintuitive since there are more vehicles than marine vessels. However, long established law requires the Hood Canal Bridge and others like it (Title 33, Part 177 Draw Bridge Operations) to give marine traffic the right-of-way over vehicular traffic.\n\nWSDOT has an agreement with the US Coast Guard to prevent some seasonal drawspan openings. From May 22 to Sept. 30 each year, private vessels (pleasure craft) are prohibited from requiring a drawspan opening from 3 to 6:15 p.m. daily which is during the peak afternoon commute. The rule doesn’t apply to commercial, U.S Navy or other Department of Defense vessels.\n\nHow long does it take to open and close the Hood Canal Bridge?\n\nThe length of time it takes to open and close the Hood Canal Bridge for a marine opening can vary from about ten minutes to 45 minutes.\n\nTo open the bridge to allow marine traffic to pass (as required by the Coast Guard), WSDOT has three spans on each side that are hydraulically raised. Once they are raised, the floating spans can be retracted back under those spans to provide the opening. Depending on what type of vessel is passing through, WSDOT may only have to retract one side of the span. If it is a sail boat that darts through, we will only open one side and it will take less time for traffic to get moving again.\n\nSubmarines and the support vessels that accompany them take longer and require both sides to be retracted. Submarines are not very maneuverable on top of the water and they will request the opening early. Ahead of the submarine will be smaller escort vessels that cross through first and then the submarine. As soon as all the vessels are through, the operator will start the closure of the two 300-feet floating spans moving towards each other. These are massive and take time to get moving and then slow down until they are together and locked. A crew member verifies that the lock is engaged, and then the three spans on each end of the opening that were raised up for the opening, these will be lowered back down. Once they are in place, the gates can be opened to vehicle traffic.\n\nIf there are any malfunctions in the system, the process will take longer. There have been times when cars would not start after they stopped for the bridge opening. This can also cause a delay in the time to clear traffic.\n\nWhy does the WSDOT Hood Canal Bridge camera go dark during a marine vessel opening?\n\nWSDOT no longer shows ships or submarines passing through the Hood Canal Bridge due to Homeland Security regulations.\n\nI plan on taking my boat. What do I need to know about the Hood Canal Bridge?\n\nFederal regulations require recreational mariners to navigate under truss spans of the bridge whenever possible. Mariners should not request draw span passage if their vertical clearance is enough to use elevated areas of the bridge.\n\nTruss heights (smallest vertical clearances at Mean High Water.) Clearances vary based on tides and wave activity.\n\nJefferson County (west) - 31 feet\n\nKitsap County (east) - 50 feet\n\nAll vessel operators must know their mast height. Requesting an unneeded draw span opening is a reportable offense to the United States Coast Guard.\n\nMariners who cannot navigate under the east truss (Kitsap County side) can request a Hood Canal Bridge draw span opening by calling (360) 779-3233. It is required to give at least an hour's notice prior to the requested opening time.\n\nUnder what weather conditions will the Hood Canal Bridge close?\n\nGenerally, the Hood Canal Bridge will close to vehicle traffic and may open the draw spans during storms involving wind speeds in excess of 40 mph that are sustained for 15 minutes or longer to relieve pressure on the bridge structure. The bridge may also close to drivers as conditions warrant. However, the direction of the wind can cause the bridge to be closed to traffic at a lower sustained wind speed if it is negatively impacting vehicle traffic crossing the bridge. Additionally, powerful Hood Canal tides can also play a role in the decision to close the draw span to traffic.\n\nIs the Hood Canal Bridge a toll road?\n\nThe Hood Canal Bridge is not a toll road. Learn more about WSDOT toll roads and toll facility locations is found on our tolling and Good to Go! pages.\n\nHow do I receive notification if the Hood Canal Bridge is open or closed?\n\nUpdates about the Hood Canal Bridge are sent out through WSDOT’s GovDelivery system. Users can subscribe for free bridge alerts."
