        "text": "Where Did Our Love GoThe Supremes\n\nHolland-Dozier-Holland originally wrote \"Where Did Our Love Go\" with The Marvelettes in mind, but they turned it down. Marvelettes lead singer Gladys Horton sang in a lower key than Diana Ross, so when The Supremes came to record the tune, Ross was forced to sing in a lower, breathier style than she was used to.\n\nThinking Out LoudEd Sheeran\n\nWhen Ed Sheeran's \"Thinking Out Loud\" climbed to the top of the UK singles chart in its 19th week, the song broke the record for the slowest continual ascent to #1.\n\nRocketDef Leppard\n\nThe line \"satellite of love\" in the Def Leppard song \"Rocket\" came from the title of a 1972 Lou Reed song.\n\nCandy GirlNew Edition\n\nIn the UK, the first #1 hit with a rap was \"Candy Girl\" by the American boy band New Edition in 1983.\n\nFacebook, Bromance and Email - The First Songs To Use New WordsSong Writing\n\nWhere words like \"email,\" \"thirsty,\" \"Twitter\" and \"gangsta\" first showed up in songs, and which songs popularized them.\n\nSongs in Famous Movie Scenes: Tarantino EditionMusic Quiz\n\nWhether he's splitting ears or burning Nazis, Quentin Tarantino uses memorable music in his films. See if you can match the song to the scene."
