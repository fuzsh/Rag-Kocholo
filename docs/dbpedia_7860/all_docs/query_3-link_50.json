        "text": "Patriotic Assembly Song of the Week:\n\n\"You're a Grand Old Flag\"\n\nFeatured Musician of the Week:\n\nJOHN DENVER\n\n1943 - 1997 American\n\nGenres: Folk, Country Pop, Country Rock\n\nMONDAY\n\nListening Example: \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\"\n\nJohn Denver had several ‘signature’ songs for which he was known, and which became No. 1 hits on the music charts. These include “Take Me Home, Country Roads; Annie’s Song; Sunshine on My Shoulders; Rocky Mountain High; and Thank God, I’m a Country Boy”. These songs will be our listening examples for this week.\n\n“Take Me Home, Country Roads” was recorded in 1971 and released on Denver's first album. This became one of his most popular songs, and it is still very popular around the world. It is even included in school music textbooks.\n\nLISTEN FOR . . .\n\nThe words were inspired by little, winding roads taken while traveling, and a friend’s stories about the splendors of the West Virginia countryside. Co-writers Danoff and Nivert wanted to sell the song to country singer Johnny Cash, but John Denver said he wanted to record it himself. ​\n\nMUSIC LISTENING LINKS\n\nTUESDAY\n\nListening Example: \"Rocky Mountain High\"\n\nAir Force B-58 \"Hustler\" Bomber\n\nLt. Col. \"Dutch\" Duetschendorf, wife Erma and son Henry, Jr., a.k.a. John Denver\n\n“Rocky Mountain High” is a folk rock song recorded in 1972. It is one of the two official state songs of Colorado. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. One of the verses refers to the destruction of the mountains by commercial tourism. The song has been used in pop culture, and the Snowmass ski resort, near Aspen, named a ski run “Rocky Mountain High’ in honor of John Denver.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nListening Example: \"Calypso\"\n\nDenver also loved nature and supported concerns for environmental issues and conservation.\n\nSCIENCE CONNECTION\n\nJohn Denver was a close friend of Jacque Cousteau. Cousteau was an undersea explorer, photographer and writer. He produced TV shows which enlightened audiences around the world on the ocean’s natural treasures and the effects of pollution.\n\nCalypso was the name of Jacques Cousteau’s exploration ship that sailed around the world for ocean conservation. John Denver expressed his interests in ecology in the 1975 song, “Calypso”, which was a tribute to Cousteau and his research team.\n\nLISTEN FOR . . .\n\nThe opening harp glissando and the guitar rhythm create a sense of forward motion that reflects the sailing ship.\n\nMUSIC LISTENING LINKS\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nListening Example: \"Annie's Song\"\n\nDuring the 70’s and 80’s, Denver starred in\n\nseveral films and television specials.\n\nHe was a guest star on The Muppet Show, which began a lifelong friendship with Jim Henson and led to other Muppet specials.\n\nHe starred in the 1977 film Oh, God! with comedian George Burns.\n\n(Denver was offered the lead role in the 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman, but he turned it down, and the role was given instead to Richard Gere.)\n\nHe also hosted several Academy Awards and The Tonight Shows.\n\nDenver’s talent extended beyond music. He pursued photography, saying “photography is a way to communicate a feeling”. He was an avid snow skier and golfer, but his main interest was in flying. His love of flying was second only to his love of music. His father had taught him to fly, and he bought a Learjet to fly himself to concerts. He collected several types of small planes.\n\nDenver was also a supporter of space exploration. In 1980, he and his father, an Air Force Lt. Col., co-hosted a TV special called “The Higher We Fly: the History of Flight”. This film won an award from the Aviation/Space Writer’s Association.\n\nDenver with his father, Lt. Col. \"Dutch\" Deutschendorf\n\nHow fast can a songwriter write a song?\n\nOur song for today is called “Annie’s Song”. “Annie’s Song” was written as an ode (poem) to Denver’s wife, Annie. He “wrote this song in about ten-and-a-half minutes one day on a ski lift” to the top of Bell Mountain in Aspen, Colorado, as the physical exhilaration of having “just skied down a very difficult run”, and the feeling of total immersion in the beauty of the colors and sounds that filled all senses inspired him to think about his wife.\n\nClick below to hear “Sunshine on My Shoulders”. Denver wrote this song when he was in Minnesota at a time when it was late winter/early spring--perhaps in March. It was a dreary, gray, slushy winter day, when he was ready for spring and feeling kind of sad. He remembered how sometimes just the sun itself can make you feel good.\n\nFRIDAY\n\nListening Example: \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\"\n\nJohn Denver expressed caring and a kind of optimism through his songs, and he brought new importance to acoustic music, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way. His optimism is heard in our song for today, which is “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”."
