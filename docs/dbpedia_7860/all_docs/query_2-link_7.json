        "text": "May 6: 13 NAACP BC and BVEA Members attended a leadership workshop conducted by CCG organizers Brock Grosso and Jorge Montiel. All who attended felt it was a valuable experience. Since attending the workshop, 4 NAACP BC board members met to discuss forming a branch of CCG in Boulder. A list of 10 non-profit organizations and unions was created. These organizations will be approached about forming a CCG BC. Once there are some commitments to exploring this possibility, at least one of the organizers will make a presentation on what and how CCG works.\n\nMay 25: Annett James and I attended CCG’s Mayoral Community Action event at Bruce Randolph HS in Denver. There were over 350 CCG members present (CCG is composed of 30 Front Range organizations). 8 CCG members gave their stories, which were then part of the proposals presented to Denver mayoral candidates, Brough and Johnston. Both candidates had met with the planning team a day before the event to brief them on the questions they would be asked at the forum, which would be answered with a simple “yes or no.” We were interested in this type of forum as NAACP BC could use this format for such forums in Boulder Co. Here is the link to the Westward article on the event: https://www.westword.com/news/ coloradans-for-the-common- good-denver-mayor-forum- 16943329\n\nOn June 1, Annett , 2 CCG board members and I met with Sheriff Johnson to update him on the National Gun Safety Consortium (NGSC) project, which the Boulder County Sheriff’s Department though Sheriff Pelle joined almost 2 years ago. With Sheriff Johnson coming on in January 2023, communications by the NGSC lagged. Our goal was to get the sheriff’s department back on track with the testing of locked handguns. A follow up meeting will be in the 3rd week of July. For more information on the National Gun Safety Consortium see: https://mail.google.com/mail/ u/0/?tab=wm#inbox/ FMfcgzGsmrDMJnhHwWdHhzPfkHrKvH JD?projector=1&amp; messagePartId=0.1\n\nLouisa Matthias\n\n[email protected]\n\nCommunications Committee\n\nJuneteenth is right around the corner, and the 3rd Annual Boulder County Juneteenth celebration will showcase a number of activities and performances. The planned events will feature two children’s book authors: Alice Faye Duncan, and Nyasha Williams. And Black Talk is thrilled to be able to speak with both of these prolific writers about their individual and collective journeys to create books that speak to all readers, especially Black children. You are invited to tune in to hear both Alice Faye and Nyasha read from several of their books. We will discuss their current and future projects, and talk about efforts afoot to ban certain books such as Alice Faye’s, Memphis, Martin, and the Mountaintop, about the 1968 sanitation workers’ strike in Memphis.\n\nYou are invited to tune in to Black Talk on Thursday, June 8th at 8:32 am on KGNU 88.5 FM.\n\nIf you’ve missed any shows, look for them at, Black Talk on KGNU. Remember: Black Talk airs on KGNU 88.5FM the second Thursday of every month at 8:32am – 9:30 am.\n\nJoin the Communications Committee! We need people who are interested in flexing their creativity muscles to create videos and podcasts, photography, writing, and graphics. Contact me if you are interested in joining this great team.\n\nSandra B. Daniel\n\nmedia.naacpbouldercounty@ gmail.com\n\nCriminal Justice Committee\n\nIn May, the city of Boulder removed one of the candidates that had previously been approved for the Police Oversight Panel (“POP”). This was in response to a code of conduct complaint against the POP Selection Committee, which included representatives from El Centro Amistad and the NAACP Boulder County Branch, alleging that the Selection Committee had failed to account for real or perceived bias of the selected POP member. Jude Landsman, VP of the Branch, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Boulder and the city council of Boulder asking the District Court for Boulder to find that the Selection Committee members’ due process rights to a hearing and to present evidence was violated, and that the city abused its discretion (see the complaint here).\n\nOur Branch was also contacted by the family of a Black high school student who has been removed from school in Boulder County and who faces criminal charges for alleged non-consensual physical contact. There will be a hearing on June 9th at 9 AM at the Boulder Court House, 1777 6th Street, Boulder 80302. Branch members are asked to support this young man by attending the hearing. Criminal Justice Committee Chair Darren O’Connor will be present to direct members to the correct courtroom, but you must show up before the start time of 9 AM.\n\nThe Mental Health Task Force is scheduling a meeting with the person in charge of mental health in the Boulder County Jail to learn more on the path to determining how best to work on improving such services.\n\nThe Criminal Justice Committee meets the 3rd Wednesday of the month at 5:30 PM, by Zoom. If you are interested in learning more about or joining the committee, contact Darren O’Connor at [email protected]\n\nEconomic Opportunity Committee"
