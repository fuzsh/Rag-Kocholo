        "text": "On May 24, 2023, the music world was stunned to learn that legendary performer Tina Turner had died at 83. Since 1960, Turner has been a fixture of R&B and soul music, a consummate performer who was as legendary for her on-stage shows as she was in the recording studio.\n\nFlip through the slideshow for 18 of Turner's most essential tracks, from early hits like \"River Deep, Mountain High\" to deeper cuts like \"On Silent Wings.\"\n\n1 of 18\n\n\"The Best\"\n\nLarry Busacca/WireImage\n\nOriginally recorded by Bonnie Tyler in 1988, Tina Turner scored a massive hit the following year with \"The Best.\" Appearing as the lead single from her album \"Foreign Affair,\" it has since become one of Turner's signature songs.\n\n2 of 18\n\n\"River Deep, Mountain High\"\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nOne of their first hits as a duo, \"River Deep, Mountain High\" is widely regarded by critics as one of the finest Ike & Tina Turner collaborations — and one of the greatest songs in pop music history.\n\n3 of 18\n\n\"What You Get Is What You See\"\n\nfrederic meylan/Sygma via Getty Images\n\nReleased in 1986, \"What You Get Is What You See\" is a little bit twangy, and is yet another example of Turner demonstrating her love for country-infused tunes.\n\n4 of 18\n\n\"I Can't Stand The Rain\"\n\nRoss Marino/Getty Images\n\nEven though her take on this 1973 hit originally recorded by Ann Peebles wasn't a major commercial success, Tina Turner's take on \"I Can't Stand The Rain\" is still incredibly compelling thanks to her smoldering vocals.\n\n5 of 18\n\n\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\"\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine,\" the gospel-inflected ballad that appears on 1962's \"Dynamite!\" earned Ike & Tina Turner the duo's first Grammy nomination. Sadly, though, its optimistic title was not reflective of how their abusive, tumultuous relationship would turn out.\n\n6 of 18\n\n\"On Silent Wings\"\n\nGie Knaeps/Getty Images\n\nTina Turner teamed up with Sting for \"On Silent Wings,\" a 1996 ballad that's about the end of a relationship that's totally heartbreaking. \"There's no more promises to break, or our love has slipped away on silent wings,\" she sings. \"You never see it coming, but you know it has to end.\" Ouch.\n\n7 of 18\n\n\"Goldeneye\"\n\nDave Hogan/Getty Images\n\nWritten by Bono and the Edge of U2, \"Goldeneye\" was written for the James Bond film of the same name, starring Pierce Brosnan. Turner swooped in to replace new-wave rockers Depeche Mode for the song, which was a minor hit across Europe despite mixed reviews from critics.\n\n8 of 18\n\n\"Nutbush City Limits\"\n\nPete Still/Redferns\n\nNamed for her Mississippi hometown, \"Nutbush City Limits\" is personal for Tina Turner, who co-wrote the song and recorded it numerous times throughout her career, both with her ex-husband Ike Turner and as a solo artist.\n\n9 of 18\n\n\"I Don't Wanna Lose You\"\n\nBernd Muller/Redferns\n\nNearly thirty years after her musical debut, Tina Turner proved that she was still capable of pushing the envelope — and turning out hits all over Europe — with \"I Don't Wanna Lose You\" in 1989.\n\n10 of 18\n\n\"Proud Mary\"\n\nGai Terrell/Redferns\n\nThough it was written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, pretty much no one would deny that Tina Turner made the riverboat anthem \"Proud Mary\" her own in 1971. Even as recently as 2009, Turner delivered fiery versions of \"Proud Mary\" that dazzled audiences.\n\n11 of 18\n\n\"A Fool In Love\"\n\nGAB Archive/Redferns\n\nThe first-ever single from Ike & Tina Turner, released in July of 1960, \"A Fool In Love\" was a success on the charts, and introduced the world to one of music's most legendary talents.\n\n12 of 18\n\n\"Why Must We Wait Until Tonight\"\n\nRob Verhorst/Redferns\n\nWritten by Bryan Adams, whom Turner collaborated with on multiple occasions, \"Why Must We Wait Until Tonight\" is a dramatic ballad that's also a little steamy. \"You like to take it real slow, show me every little move you know,\" she sings. \"Take a little love and watch it grow, but I wanna lay with you, darling, right now.\"\n\n13 of 18\n\n\"It's Only Love,\" with Bryan Adams\n\nPete Still/Redferns\n\nIn 1984, Bryan Adams tapped Tina Turner for \"It's Only Love,\" a collaboration that appeared on his album \"Reckless.\" Their work together in the studio inspired a longtime friendship, and Adams actually performed at Turner's 2013 wedding to Erwin Bach.\n\n14 of 18\n\n\"Private Dancer\"\n\nDave Hogan/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nWritten by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Tina Turner brings her distinct brand of vampy sexuality to \"Private Dancer,\" a top-ten hit for Turner in 1983. And even though many folks think it's about a stripper or a sex worker, \"Private Dancer\" actually refers to the \"taxi dancers\" of the early 20th century.\n\n15 of 18\n\n\"We Don't Need Another Hero\"\n\nWarner Brothers/Getty Images\n\nWritten for the epic film \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,\" \"We Don't Need Another Hero\" was, like the film, a major success for Turner that came complete with a music video starring the artist as her character, Aunty Entity.\n\n16 of 18\n\n\"Steamy Windows\"\n\nDave Hogan/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAs its title might indicate, \"Steamy Windows\" is one of those Tina Turner songs that's only for grown folks. It's a sultry, country-inflected tune about hooking up in the back of a car, done only in the way Tina can do it.\n\n17 of 18\n\n\"Typical Male\"\n\nRob Verhorst/Redferns\n\nTina Turner uses the law as a metaphor on \"Typical Male,\" a song that's all about figuring out how to attract the attention of a \"typical male.\" As if Tina Turner ever had to try to attract anyone's attention!\n\n18 of 18\n\n\"What's Love Got To Do With It\"\n\nPaul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nReleased in 1984, \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" is Tina Turner's signature song, and her biggest-selling hit as a solo artist. It was an instant #1 hit, marked a resurgence in Turner's career, and eventually went on to inspire the title of her 1993 biopic, which starred Angela Bassett."
