        "text": "Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997) was an American musician and songwriter. He was of German and Irish ancestry. He was very popular in the 1970s. He died when the plane he was flying crashed in California.[1][2]\n\nDenver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s. By 1974, he was one of America's best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as \"among the most beloved entertainers of his era\" [3][4]On 12 October 1997, John Denver died in a plane crash aged 53.\n\nOn October 12th, 1997 Denver was piloting his own \"experimental ultralight plane\" off of Monterey Bay, California. He made an error in calculating his remaining fuel levels and fatally crashed directly into the ocean near Lover's Point, Pacific Grove, after the plane ran completely out of gas. After a thorough investigation completed by the National Aviation Services and supporting law enforcement, it was deemed that he was too confined within the limited space of his plane to successfully engage his reserve tank. Denver was 53 years old; his remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Rocky Mountains."
