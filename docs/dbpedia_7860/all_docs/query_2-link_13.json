        "text": "Everyone has their own favorite artist.\n\nI'm never one to try and hate on people's music taste. We all have very different lives, stories to tell, and music that we love.\n\nI was scrolling through Facebook earlier this week when I came across an interesting bit of information.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about what musical act/artist that comes from your home state is the highest grossing artist?\n\nI did some diving and found the different highest grossing artists from each state and Iowa's will surprise you!\n\nHow Did They Determine This?\n\nI was talking with a co-worker about this story and could not believe some of the artists that are considered the \"highest grossing\" in each state.\n\nTennessee's highest grossing artist from the state is Tina Turner.\n\nWe were both shocked that Dolly Parton didn't take this spot.\n\nAccording to Paste Magazine, this ranking was determined based off of information from the Recording Industry Association of America, specifically in terms of units sold per artist.\n\nThe top highest grossing artists overall are as follows:\n\n1. The Beatles\n\n2. Garth Brooks\n\n3. Elvis Presley\n\n4. Eagles\n\n5. Led Zeppelin\n\nWho Is The Highest Grossing Artist From Iowa?\n\nAccording to a 2023 story from Paste Magazine, the highest grossing musician from Iowa is...\n\nAndy Williams...\n\nIf you're a millennial or a Gen Z-er like myself, you might be wondering just who exactly Andy Williams is.\n\nHe is often referred to as the \"King of Christmas.\" You actually hear his crooning voice every single holiday season with his beloved hit 'It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.'\n\nBorn on December 3rd, 1927 in Wall Lake, Iowa Williams got his start singing with his three brothers in his hometown's church choir, according to IMDB.\n\nWhile he ventured out East to build a music career, he never quite gave up his Midwestern sensibilities.\n\nHe ended up spending the later parts of his career in Branson, Missouri where he was the featured act at the Andy Williams Moon River Theater.\n\nAre you surprised that Andy Williams holds this title in the Hawkeye State? Will another artist ever come close to this man's musical legacy?\n\nCheck out the artists from the rest of the country here!\n\nStay up to date with everything going on in Eastern Iowa by downloading the free station app from your app store.
