        "text": "Ah - I misunderstood. I thought you were saying Michael Jackson refused to play because he knew he'd get overshadowed by Queen!\n\nI think he would've done just fine - honestly, the legend of Queen's appearance has gotten a little out of hand over the last 32 years. Yes, they did well, but it's not like people didn't appreciated other performances as well...\n\nIt was absolutely superb and was the best of the event. But because it's the most memorable one, it's what gets shown and acclaimed the most, to the extent that everybody else barely gets a mention. Status Quo, U2 and Bowie all played very good sets at Live Aid but are barely mentioned now.\n\nBut, then again, Queen were better than those on the day. Watching it as an 11 year old who loved Queen, I was excited by the whole thing. Queen were my favourite band on it of course, but I don't remember them overshadowing everybody else's performances at the time. The whole event was the thing, not just Queen.\n\nIronically, if there were one band who initially didn't think Queen would give a legendary performance it was Queen themselves. The band almost broke up around 1983 and still was pretty much in shambles. People around them really had to convince them to do the gig (as much as their manager pushed them to make the halfhearted The Works album). They probably gave it their all and I'm pretty sure it was Live Aid (and, ofcourse, another matter) that prompted the band to go full speed ahead.\n\nDionne Warwick and Lionel Richie participated too.\n\nMJ was working on the Captain EO music and film for Disney:\n\nCaptain EO - Wikipedia\n\nHot Space may have been an unpopular album, but I've never read anything about Queen possibly splitting following its release. However, it's known that they decided to record their next project in Los Angeles rather than returning to Musicland Studios, as certain members were annoyed by the lifestyle distractions that spilled onto its predecessor from the Munich club scene. Unfortunately, for all the group's best efforts, The Works suffered because of Freddie's personal manager, Paul Prenter, turning down opportunities for interviews on his client's behalf and even live shows in the US, with the final straw for many conservative Americans being the video for I Want To Break Free plus the controversy that revolved around Capitol, Queen's distributor there at the time. Having burning so many bridges then Freddie suffering with his voice and a recurring knee injury on the subsequent Works Tour, it's believed the band came very close to splitting by early 1985, their appearances at that year's Rock In Rio being quite the embarrassment.\n\nAlthough they reluctantly agreed to perform at Live Aid, everyone clearly had a point to prove, and I've read that Freddie especially put in more than his fair share of effort, losing weight (to supposedly impress his then new-boyfriend, Jim Hutton, who saw the whole show from just off the stage) and singing against the advice of a doctor. While there has been talk of Freddie suspecting that something was wrong at this point, he didn't get his official AIDS diagnosis until Easter '87, and he described Live Aid as injecting new life into Queen, as he was the one who came up with the idea of abandoning the original plan to spent the rest of '85 on a break. Under the promise he was now 100% committed to the music and perhaps bruised after the recent commercial failure of Mr. Bad Guy, which CBS had funded with a record-shattering budget, expecting a major hit solo album, Freddie launched into One Vision and the subsequent A Kind Of Magic before embarking on what became his final tour with Queen.\n\nI was at the London gig. The concert made a huge impression on the 18 year old me and I've continued to read as much as I can about it.\n\nGeldof covered the black artists not participating in his autobiography. The politics and management interference is pretty shameful.\n\nThe reasons for many of the artists listed not being on the line up are varied but mostly come down to them not being big enough or current. Remember that artists had fleeting moments in the sun at the time and the entire point of the concert was to make money by putting those acts most likely to draw audiences and donations. Geldof himself said if it was down to music he liked then most of the acts wouldn't be on the bill. In Geldof's book he discusses the issues in getting U.K. And US businesses to work at cost or at least donate profits to the charity. Catering in wembley for example ran at full profit that day and refused to donate.\n\nDepecehe Mode don't do charity concerts and at the time in the UK were a cult former pop act who the print press hated.\n\nSpringsteen was asked but , as Geldof related in his book, had just got married and was on honeymoon. He donated the stage and rigging in Wembley.\n\nJulian Lennon was due to appear in a London and is on the t-shirts and if I recall correctly is listed in the programme.\n\nTears For Fears were due to appear but the band was falling apart on a world tour.\n\nI met Geldof after a Boomtown Rats gig earlier this year and got to chat with him about Live Aid as he was signing my ticket and programme. He mentioned that even at Wembley the Live Aid Trust was getting ripped off the official attendance was 72,000 but geldof maintains there were closer to 85,000."
