        "text": "It's the start of a new year which means it's the second best time of the year, next to Christmas, and that's tax filing season. Whether you file your taxes with professional tax filers or do them yourselves it seems that this year things are a little different.\n\nOn Monday, January 8, the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, released a statement online that the filing date for 2024 which seems to have some people a bit peeved. The filing date for taxes in 2024 is January 29 and that date seems like a very far date compared to the previous year tax date. In 2023 the tax filing open date was January 15 which seems like an appropriate tax date since it's in the middle of the month and allows people who received their W-2 early to file.\n\nWhile this tax date has people who already received their W-2 angry that they have to wait to see their money they won't actually have to wait to do their paperwork. You can begin your taxes on the IRS website on January 12 for those that qualify for the free file option due to their income. Which means you can get started and don't have to worry too much.\n\nThe deadline for filing your taxes is April 15 which gives taxpayers plenty of time to get their documents sorted out. You can file your taxes for free, if you qualify, by heading over to IRS.gov where you can also find more information about filing for 2024."
