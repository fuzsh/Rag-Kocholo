        "text": "Randy Sparks passed away this past February 11, 2024, at the age of 90.\n\nRandy was a colorful and influential person in the Folk Music Industry. He was also very personable and approachable, and he LOVED to tell stories.\n\nOne of the stories he told us (and many others over the years) was the story in which he credits himself as the person who gave John Denver his stage name.\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf Jr. was performing at Randy’s club Ledbetters, when Randy commented his name wouldn’t fit on a marquee. Randy suggested that John take the last name of Denver (Randy had written and recorded a song called “Denver” and he said the sheet music was laying there so he suggested that). John resisted. He very adamantly wanted to keep his family name, but he finally and reluctantly went with Randy’s suggestion.\n\nThe John Denver connection with Randy Sparks continued with John Denver recording other songs of Randy’s, including “Today” and “Saturday Night in Toledo, Ohio” on multi-platinum albums.\n\nBlogs are supposed to be short – so this is my own abbreviated version of a very long and detailed story that Randy told me and Jim. Randy was a wonderful storyteller, he greatly influenced Folk Music history and many aspiring singer/songwriters…learn more on Wikipedia and The New Christy Minstrel website."
