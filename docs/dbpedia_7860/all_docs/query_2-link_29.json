        "text": "I’ve been thinking about Joni Mitchell.\n\nAnd thinking about her music. I borrowed a half-dozen of her CDs a couple of weeks ago after reviewing David Yaffe’s Reckless Daughter: A Portrait of Joni for the Rochester Central Public Library’s noontime Books Sandwiched In series. The room was full. I’m told 85 people attended. Most, I suspect, were there because I brought along the marvelous Connie Deming to sing three of Mitchell’s songs.\n\nAnd I’ve been thinking about rebellion.\n\nMitchell is a remarkable figure. Her sometimes contradictory complexity makes her ever more remarkable. Throughout Reckless Daughter, shimmering legends of popular music offer testimony to her genius. Leonard Cohen. David Crosby. Judy Collins. Bob Dylan, who she says doesn’t dance. And she is a ruthless evaluator of others’ flaws: Jackson Browne appears to be one very odd man, if Mitchell is to be believed. As a teenager, she was a self-taught painter, guitarist, dancer, poet and smoker, and apparently was quite good at all of it. She picked up a ukulele and began playing it, then learned guitar by listening to a Pete Seeger instructional record. But because her left hand was damaged by polio when she was a child, Mitchell had to invent her own tunings. She played folk, and then jazz, at coffeehouses.\n\nAll of this, before Mitchell was 20 years old. And it was only then that she wrote her first song. And she immediately began producing words of stunning self-examination.\n\nIt is a genius that is wholly hers.\n\nMitchell is now 74 years old, undergoing physical therapy as she recovers from a brain aneurysm. Throughout her long, creative life, she has lived with one very significant guiding principal. Seek the truth. Question authority. Here’s an anecdote from early in Reckless Daughter when Mitchell, as Yaffe describes it, “raised hell in Sunday school class.”\n\nMitchell simply asked, “Adam and Eve were the first man and woman, right?”\n\n“Right,” the Sunday school teacher replied.\n\n“They had two sons, right?”\n\n“Right, Cain and Abel.”\n\n“And Cain killed Abel and then Cain got married? Who did he marry, Eve?”\n\nQuestion authority. Mitchell did so, even as a young person.\n\nDid you dare to question authority?\n\nMy own youthful defiance was spotty. I didn’t grow up during the Cold War. But the chill still lingered when I was an impressionable youngster. I’m from a suburban town just outside of Cleveland, not far from Akron. And I remember my fifth-grade teacher, Mrs. Meutzel, telling us one afternoon that if the Soviets ever targeted a nuclear bomb for Northeastern Ohio, they would drop it right on our town, because that way they could wipe out both Cleveland and Akron.\n\nThat was my introduction to how adults, working together, could plan for a more-efficient nuclear apocalypse. Mrs. Meutzel had some other ideas that, even as a fifth-grader, I wasn’t buying into quite so easily. She once told our class that a gigantic net had been placed in outer space, floating over the entire country. If a Soviet missile penetrated that net, an alarm would go off. Ridiculous, of course. Even at that young age, I figured maybe she had read or heard someone using a net as an analogy for our nuclear-defense system, and confused it with an actual net.\n\nBut the world was ready for a net by then anyway. In 1968 alone, we assassinated Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. We even shot an artist, Andy Warhol. Men were orbiting the moon for the first time, cops were beating up protestors at the Democratic National Convention and we elected Richard Nixon as president. The Vietnam War was raging and Woodstock, as only Mitchell seemed to recognize, was us merely fooling ourselves into thinking it all might change for the better.\n\nIf you listen to Mitchell’s version of “Woodstock,” the song she wrote after the famous music and mud festival, it’s tone is different than the hit version by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Theirs is more upbeat, a celebration. Hers suggests the whole weekend was an illusion, that peace and love was slipping out of reach.\n\nTwo years later, the Ohio National Guard shot and killed four college students at Kent State University, a mere 45 minutes’ drive from our house. I remember my dad siding with the governor of Ohio, and what seemed to be the prevailing adult attitude, that those four dead college kids and the nine who were injured were just a bunch of filthy Vietnam War protestors who should have been in class, and deserved to be shot.\n\nI don’t recall thinking any differently.\n\nA few weekends ago, hundreds of thousands of teenagers filled the streets across the country, the world, even, in protest against gun violence. The March For Our Lives. The kids have been criticized as being too young to have opinions, they’ve been accused of being crisis actors taking advantage of tragedy.\n\nBut Vietnam, assassination and Nixon. And what was the Ohio National Guard doing with real bullets on a college campus, if it wasn’t planning to shoot college students?\n\nWhat do kids know? Let me ask you: What do adults know?\n\nBE THE FIRST in your neighborhood to know when a new Critical Mass has been turned loose.

Whenever I come across a work crew that’s digging into a street or sidewalk, I always stop and peer into the hole.\n\nI love the diesel-engine smell and the comforting mechanical rumble of heavy equipment.\n\nOne of my favorite sights is a baseball stadium lit up at night.\n\nBuying a copy of Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits from a small record store while walking home from baseball practice changed the direction of my life, although not right away.\n\nOne of my unusual talents used to be catching fly balls behind my back. Not anymore, though.\n\nI sang with Tina Turner for a few seconds.\n\nIn college, I wrote a poem about Rondo Hatton. Google him.\n\nI have eaten haggis. Twice.\n\nI watched a man drown in a river. There was nothing I could do.\n\nI am not on a first-name basis with Bruce Springsteen but it’s not my fault, because I really have seen him 52 or 54 times.\n\nI was looking out of a bus window in Reykjavík, the capitol of Iceland, when a dump truck stopped next to us. It was loaded with fish heads. I thought: Where is that going?\n\nLandscapes of the Hudson River School are beautiful. It’s the light.\n\nOne of my favorite art forms is mechanical drawing. I never see them in museums.\n\nWhen the guitars come out at night during parties and my friends start singing, I always sit in the darkness in the back of the room, in case I start crying, because it’s so beautiful.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes: “Some people get nervous about that word. Art. They think it’s a pretentious word from the giddyap. To me, words are only symbols, and the word art has never lost its vitality. It still has meaning to me. Love lost its meaning to me. God lost its meaning to me. But art never lost its meaning.” That’s Joni Mitchell.\n\nMy favorite book is George Orwell’s Nineteen-Eighty Four.\n\nAnother one of my favorite quotes: “Don’t play what’s there, play what’s not there.” That’s Miles Davis.\n\nFollowing a dog on a path through the woods is a beautiful feeling. And then the two of you find the crumbling, overgrown foundation of an old building and you both think: What’s that doing here?\n\nDogs are awesome.\n\nGoat tastes OK.\n\nI’ve never read a Stephen King novel.\n\nThe best concert I’ve seen was at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas, with Dave Alvin and Tom Russell together onstage performing their song “Blue Wing.”\n\nI shot a gun, once. At an empty beer can. I hit it. I quit while I was ahead.\n\nIf I could invite any four living people to dinner, it would be Anthony Bourdain, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Tom Waits and Patti Smith.\n\nAnother favorite quote: “The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.” That’s Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nIf I could invite any four dead people to dinner, it would be William Burroughs, Ben Franklin, Flannery O’Connor and Amelia Earhart, if only to ask her, “What the hell happened?”\n\nYet another favorite quote: “I’ve always believed in having a sense of balance and stealth.” That’s Patti Smith, she’s amazing.\n\nAll of the great cars were made in the 1950s. No. 1 on the list is the 1957 Chevy Bel Air convertible.\n\nYes I’m a writer, but I also know how to operate a forklift.\n\nI read The Sunday Times, so you don’t have to: Feb. 7\n\nFirst music of the day, Kenny Garrett’s Pursuance: The Music of John Coltrane. Let’s start off with a few stories from the from the front page of The New York Times that are about groups who would love to control your life, rather than allow the government to do it.\n\n1, Organizers of this weekend’s Tea Party convention in Nashville say they have deliberately kept anyone who looked too crazy out of the room, in an attempt to at least look like a legitimate political force. Unfortunately, the speakers weren’t monitored as closely: One claimed the Jesus’ birth was better documented than Barack Obama’s. The group’s goal is to contribute $10 million to conservative candidates this year. Perhaps one in your very own town. Citing the election in Massachusetts of Scott Brown to the Senate a couple of weeks ago, and the influence of out-of-state Tea Party money in that election, conventioneers spoke excitedly of ousting Democrats Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. The story leaves unchallenged some facts stated by conventioneers, that a Tea Party rally in Washington, D.C. drew a million and a half people (authorities estimate it was tens of thousands) and that Pelosi called the Tea Partiers “Nazis” (I can find no evidence that she did so; instead, Pelosi appears to have only said, and said correctly, that Tea Partiers have carried posters with swastikas on them). Attendance at the convention: About 600.\n\n2, Voters in New Albany, Miss., have finally said that, yes, a hard-working citizen who spent all day filling potholes in your roads will soon finally be able to enjoy a beer in this town. Prohibitionists still want liquor and wine outlawed, but their demands that beer not be sold on Sundays, or in single bottles, or even be refrigerated, were defeated. The writer William Faulkner, who was born in New Albany and was an enthusiastic drinker, led pro-alcohol movements in nearby Oxford, to no avail. An 85-year-old woman quoted in the story calls the prohibitionists “a mixture of hypocrisy and ignorance, with maybe a little stupidity thrown in.” Many churchgoers, she says, are known to drive to Tupelo for a margarita or two.\n\n3, De-regulation advocates may want to re-think their position after reading “Toyota’s Pattern Is Slow Response On Safety Issues.” The company, whose cars have been troubled by sticking gas pedals and brake malfunctions, has a history of quietly fixing problems in future designs without taking the costly step of addressing the troubles of cars currently on the road. The free market does not police itself.\n\n4, I knew this was going to happen: Karaoke has been shown to be deadly to your health, particularly in the Philippines, where murderous brawls have erupted during performances, particularly versions of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way.” It’s been estimated the pop hit has led to to perhaps a half a dozen deadly hits on karaoke crooners in the past decade. Theories include the song is difficult to sing, driving listeners to take revenge on the tuneless victim, or perhaps the defiant words are accepted as a challenge by others in the room; It’s estimated there are one million illegal guns in the Philippines. The violence is not limited to that country, or to Sinatra. In Thailand, a man killed eight of his neighbors after they karaoked John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.”\n\n5, The astronomer Geoffrey Burbridge has died at age 84. He advanced the idea that every one of us is made of chemical elements that came from one star, an exploding supernova that spread those elements throughout the universe. For the layman, The Times‘ obit sagely adds: “Or, as the singer Joni Mitchell put it, ‘We are stardust.’ ”\n\n6, In The Week in Review, say your airplane explodes. We learn Popular Mechanics advises that your best odds of surviving a fall from 35,000 feet without a parachute is to “ride a piece of debris on the way down.” This has resulted in a successful landing 31 times since 1940.\n\n7, In a long yet quite comprehensible editorial, the Sunday Opinion page gives us “The Truth About the Debt.” This whole mess is one big set of interconnected troubles. The Times writes that “Unless health care costs are controlled, there is no way to solve the country’s long-term deficit and debt problems.”\n\n8, Columnist Frank Rich heard the silence from the right after Adm. Mike Mullen said gay men and lesbians should be allowed to serve in the military. While homophobia has long been a plank of the Republican party, Rich notes that the silence of the Republicans (excepting the occasional crank like John McCain) is its agreement that it can no longer fight against this Civil Rights issue.\n\n9, Oh, God has blessed us. The classic 1941 monster flick The Wolfman has been re-made, with Benicio Del Toro in the title fur. And little else in the way of make-up, judging by the photo I’m looking at.\n\n10, In the NYT magazine, Canadian writer Douglas Coupland, who invented the phrase “Generation X,” compares the U.S. with what some might call Canadian socialism: “To have healthy culture you have to have stable health care financing and stable arts financing and stable sports financing, and if you don’t have that, your culture becomes a parking lot.”\n\n11, The magazine’s letters page is filled with readers trashing the Jan. 24 cover boy, novelist James Patterson. “Assembly line page turners give up the ghost in a decade or less,” one writes, comparing Patterson’s best sellers with another once-popular writer whose work has displayed the shelf life of an avocado, Irving Wallace. Writes another, “Calling James Patterson a writer is like calling Fox News news.”\n\n12, The Jan. 24 Book Review assessment of Crisis and Command: the History of Executive Power by Bush Administration torture apologist John Yoo set off similar fireworks. His two books, one reader writes, have been “universally discredited by serious scholars.” Ponders another, “Why is The New York Times reviewing a book by someone who may be a war criminal?”"
