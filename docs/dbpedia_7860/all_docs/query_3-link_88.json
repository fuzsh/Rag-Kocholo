        "text": "1. John Denver was originally known by his birth name, Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. He changed his last name to \"Denver\" as a tribute to the beautiful city of Denver, Colorado, where he began his music career.\n\n2. Despite his fame as a singer-songwriter known for his wholesome image, John Denver had a dark side. He struggled with alcoholism and had several run-ins with the law, including a conviction for drunk driving.\n\n3. John Denver's signature song, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads,\" is often associated with West Virginia. However, the song was actually written about Maryland, where John Denver lived at the time. Denver had never been to West Virginia prior to the song's release.\n\n4. Alongside his successful music career, John Denver pursued a passion for space exploration. He took extensive astronaut training and in 1985, he became the first civilian to fly the experimental aircraft, the Rutan Long-EZ, which was designed by his friend Burt Rutan."
