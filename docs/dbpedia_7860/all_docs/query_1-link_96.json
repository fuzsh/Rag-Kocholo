The tour promoted her final studio album Twenty Four Seven (1999). It was reported that the tour grossed US$122.5 million from 108 shows with an attendance of 2.4 million spectators.[2] According to Pollstar, the tour also became that year's highest-grossing tour in North America with $80.2 million in earnings.[3] At that time, Turner's outing was the fifth highest grossing tour ever in North America.[4] The tour was sponsored by E*Trade.\n\nThough billed as her final outing, Turner would return to touring in 2008 with her anniversary tour.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter her record-breaking 1996 world tour, Turner decided to take a longer break between albums and tours. Initially, Turner planned an elaborate co-headlining tour with Elton John. The two performed a duet of Turner's hit \"Proud Mary\" and John's \"The Bitch is Back\" on the VH1 special, \"Divas Live '99\". During rehearsals, Turner felt unease with the music and stopped everyone from playing and then instructed John on how to play the song.\n\n\"I made a mistake when I needed to show him how to play 'Proud Mary'. The mistake is you don't show Elton John how to play his piano. He just went into a rage, which he apologized for later. He said it was wrong.\"\n\n— Tina Turner, CBS News[6]\n\nThe tour plans were cancelled and Turner scrapped her initial plans for a greatest hits collection deciding to record her final studio album. Along the way, Turner also performed the Super Bowl XXXIV pre-show ceremonies.\n\nTo introduce the tour, Turner stated:[6]\n\nIt's a play. It's an act. For the moment, it's a small movie, so to speak. That's why I like all of the stuff and the action and the playoff between me and the girls. It's life on that stage for that two hours.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nAs mentioned above, the tour initially was set to promote her latest studio album. During promotion, Turner acknowledge the tour as her final one as she enters pseudo-retirement. She comments:\n\nI've been performing for 44 years; I really should hang up my dancing shoes. I can't keep up with Janet Jackson. I'm not a diva like Diana Ross. I'm rock 'n' roll, but I'm happy I can do it one more time, so people can remember me at my best.\"\n\nThe album played a prominent role in the tour as Turner rehearsed \"Whatever You Need\", \"When the Heartache is Over\", \"Talk to My Heart\", \"Falling\", \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" (which was to be included in a ballads medley with \"Two People\" and two other unknown songs) and \"Twenty Four Seven\". When Turner decided to do a retrospective of her career, she included her first hit, \"A Fool in Love\", the first time Turner performed the song live since the 1970s. Turner also rehearsed \"Ooh Poo Pah Do\" but replaced with \"Get Back\". Additionally, she included some of her favorite R&B hits including, \"Hold On, I'm A Comin'\" and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\".\n\nTina had previously planned to have more acoustic styled arrangements for the set list, however as the tour developed this idea was scrapped\n\n\"It has been described as a stadium tour in an arena. [it's] hugely complicated and one of the largest arena shows to ever go out and tour back-to-back.\"\n\n— Mark Fisher\n\nFor her final outing, Turner wanted a stage that was sleek and modern. Her original concepts included the framing of an \"apartment building\" that had cabins and access ramps. Also included were risers with visible staircases and front drop for the musicians. Fisher, also wanted to create a volcano effect with the staging, have it split into two sets. This inner stage included a video screen and a ramp leading to an upstage platform. There was an additional ramp that lead downstage. The main feature of the stage was the \"cantilever arm\". A 2' wide, 60' long platform that extended Turner into the audience. Initially, Turner did not want the arm as the same concept was used for her 1990 European tour and she did not want to repeat herself. However, after seeing video animations, Turner wanted the arm included. For stadium shows, a roof for the stage was added along with additional video screens. The arm was extended an additional 20 feet. It took at least seven hours to construct the stage.[8]\n\nThe stage was constructed by McLaren Engineering Group.[9]\n\nOpening acts\n\n[edit]\n\nLionel Richie (North America [Leg 1] & UK)\n\nJohn Fogerty (Europe [select dates]).\n\nJanice Robinson (North America [Leg 1])[11]\n\nJoe Cocker (Europe [select dates] & North America [Leg 2])\n\nSet list\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following set list is from the July 16 show in London. It is not intended to represent all other dates throughout the tour.[12]\n\nNotes\n\n\"Hold On, I'm A Comin'\" was performed during the first leg in North America.\n\n\"Get Back\" was performed from March 23 to June 17, until it was ultimately replaced by \"Better Be Good to Me\".\n\n\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was performed earlier in the set list, from March 23 to June 17, but was moved later in the set for shows in Europe. It permanently cut from the set list of the second North American leg.\n\n\"Twenty Four Seven\" was only performed during the European leg.\n\n\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" was added to the set list on June 30.\n\nStarting on September 20, a performance of \"Hot Legs\" by Turner's background singers replaced the \"Baby I'm a Star\" interlude. Additionally, \"Steamy Windows\" was added to the set list.\n\nDate City Country Venue North America—Leg 1 March 23, 2000 Minneapolis United States Target Center March 24, 2000 Madison Kohl Center March 25, 2000 Rosemont Allstate Arena March 26, 2000 Auburn Hills The Palace of Auburn Hills March 30, 2000 Cleveland Gund Arena March 31, 2000 Louisville Freedom Hall April 1, 2000 Greensboro Greensboro Coliseum April 3, 2000 Philadelphia First Union Center April 7, 2000 New York City Madison Square Garden April 8, 2000 April 9, 2000 Buffalo HSBC Arena April 12, 2000 Atlanta Philips Arena April 14, 2000 Tampa Ice Palace April 15, 2000 Sunrise National Car Rental Center April 16, 2000 April 19, 2000 New Orleans New Orleans Arena April 20, 2000 Dallas Reunion Arena April 21, 2000 San Antonio Alamodome April 23, 2000 Houston Compaq Center April 27, 2000 Phoenix America West Arena April 28, 2000 San Diego San Diego Sports Arena April 29, 2000 Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena May 3, 2000 Sacramento ARCO Arena May 4, 2000 Anaheim Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim May 5, 2000 May 6, 2000 San Jose San Jose Arena May 8, 2000 Oakland The Arena in Oakland May 12, 2000 Tacoma Tacoma Dome May 13, 2000 Vancouver Canada General Motors Place May 15, 2000 Salt Lake City United States Delta Center May 17, 2000 Denver Pepsi Center May 19, 2000 Kansas City Kemper Arena May 20, 2000 Moline MARK of the Quad Cities May 21, 2000 St. Louis Kiel Center May 24, 2000 Milwaukee Bradley Center May 26, 2000 Indianapolis Conseco Fieldhouse May 27, 2000 Rosemont Allstate Arena May 28, 2000 Cincinnati Firstar Center June 1, 2000 Auburn Hills The Palace of Auburn Hills June 2, 2000 Grand Rapids Van Andel Arena June 3, 2000 Columbus Jerome Schottenstein Center June 4, 2000 Toronto Canada Air Canada Centre June 8, 2000 Boston United States FleetCenter June 9, 2000 June 10, 2000 Montreal Canada Molson Centre June 11, 2000 Ottawa Corel Centre June 14, 2000 Bristow United States Nissan Pavilion at Stone Ridge June 15, 2000 Hartford Hartford Civic Center June 17, 2000 East Rutherford Continental Airlines Arena Europe June 30, 2000 Zürich Switzerland Letzigrund Stadion July 1, 2000 July 3, 2000 Hanover Germany Niedersachsenstadion July 5, 2000 Saint-Denis France Stade de France July 7, 2000 Glasgow Scotland Hampden Park July 9, 2000 Cardiff Wales Millennium Stadium July 11, 2000 Dublin Ireland RDS Arena July 13, 2000 Sheffield England Don Valley Stadium July 15, 2000 London Wembley Stadium July 16, 2000 July 18, 2000 Groningen Netherlands Stadspark July 19, 2000 Hamburg Germany Volksparkstadion July 21, 2000 Berlin Olympic Stadium July 23, 2000 Munich Olympic Stadium July 25, 2000 Werchter Belgium Werchter Festival Grounds July 27, 2000 Frankfurt Germany Waldstadion July 28, 2000 Cologne Müngersdorfer Stadion July 30, 2000 Leipzig Zentralstadion August 1, 2000 Vienna Austria Ernst Happel Stadion August 3, 2000 Copenhagen Denmark Parken Stadium August 5, 2000 Gothenburg Sweden Ullevi August 6, 2000 Oslo Norway Valle Hovin August 9, 2000 Helsinki Finland Finnair Stadium August 10, 2000 August 12, 2000 Tallinn Estonia Tallinn Song Festival Grounds August 15, 2000 Sopot Poland Sopot Hippodrome North America—Leg 2 September 20, 2000 Boston United States FleetCenter September 22, 2000 Philadelphia First Union Center September 23, 2000 Albany Pepsi Arena September 24, 2000 Toronto Canada Air Canada Centre September 26, 2000 September 28, 2000 Montreal Molson Centre September 30, 2000 Pittsburgh United States Mellon Arena October 1, 2000 Uniondale Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum October 4, 2000 Chicago United Center October 6, 2000 Cleveland Quicken Loans Arena October 7, 2000 Washington, D.C.

Dickey (Spartanburg Herald Journal) praised the tour, stating, \"'In fact, the only low points came during Turner's protracted absences for outfit changes, when the backing crew was forced to carry the show. Minus Turner's soaring vocals—which cut sharply though the Target Center's infamously muddy acoustic chamber—the band seemed awkward and cursory.[36]\n\nMark Brown (Rocky Mountain News) gave the performance at the Pepsi Center an \"A\", citing \"From minute one, Turner bursts onto the stage with energy and finesse that only the Queen will process. Belting out her memorable hits, Turner proves it doesn't take media trickery to have success. She may be rolling down the river but Turner is creating an untouchable path. \"[37]\n\nMartine Bury (VIBE) praised Turner's performance at the Allstate Arena, \"From her signature rendition of Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Proud Mary' to the way she heats up dance floors with her most recent single, 'When the Heartache is Over' that sultry, gravelly voice tells ardent stories like no other.\"[38]\n\nBroadcasts and recordings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe opening night of the tour at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, aired live on VH1's Opening Night Live on March 23, 2000. The concert at the Sopot Hippodrom aired on TVP1 on August 15, 2000. An additional television broadcast aired on BBC Three. The concert footage was filmed at the Oakland Arena performance on May 8, 2000. The performances filmed at the Wembley Stadium were later used for the DVD release in 2001 and aired on the CBS Network in the United States. The DVD was certified platinum in the US and UK. The concert at Groningen was filmed and broadcast locally.
