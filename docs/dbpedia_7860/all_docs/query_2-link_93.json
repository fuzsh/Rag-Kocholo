        "text": "August 5, 2024\n\nPrograms to help men to stop using violence are crucial, but are men meaningfully engaging with them? Our new study found opportunities to increase engagement, and in doing so, better protect women.\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nRecently there have been three worrying reviews into Australian Olympic sports but much more needs to be done to protect vulnerable athletes.\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nThe 16-volume royal commission report, to be made public tomorrow, will show beyond doubt how state policies and institutions have been guilty of enabling abuse. Change has to begin immediately.\n\nJune 24, 2024\n\nWomen who have moved to Australia, particularly from traumatic settings, are particularly at risk of gendered violence. Here’s what our research found helps them to speak up.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nEvidence shows the links between punishment, discipline and behaviour change are weak at best. Good rehabilitation has a therapeutic focus – but this is less popular with politicians and the public.\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nYou’d call the police if a stranger in public did what many bullies at work get away with. 2 researchers who study workplace violence describe the widespread phenomenon.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nThe dangers of high-impact sport aren’t contentious. Medical professionals agree that sport-induced brain trauma leads to degenerative brain disease – so why are we still allowing children to play?\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nDassi Erlich details the crime, the cover-up and her eventual victory in court against Malka Leifer, the former school principal who abused her.\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nIncreases in intimate partner violence have highlighted the need for creative and innovative ways of addressing the issue, particularly during emergencies.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nTo develop meaningful solutions, sexual harassment needs to be seen as an organizational issue and not just an interpersonal one.\n\nOctober 23, 2023\n\nSome children and young people escape family violence, only to find themselves alone, homeless and in violent relationships. How can we support and protect these vulnerable adolescents?\n\nOctober 18, 2023\n\nThe Victorian parliament has introduced a bill to criminalise non-fatal strangulation – but consent could be a defence.\n\nSeptember 28, 2023\n\nTo honour Truth and Reconciliation Day, we spoke with Terri Cardinal, who headed up one of the many community searches for the children who went missing while attending an Indian Residential School.\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nAthletes and coaches often describe abusive behaviour as ‘tough love’.\n\nSeptember 10, 2023\n\nTeenagers are experiencing intimate partner violence and abuse that is putting their lives in danger. And they want help from others to spot the early warning signs.\n\nJuly 19, 2023\n\nAccording to the texts shared by his ex girlfriend, Jonah Hill had a series of prohibitions for her behaviour during their relationship. He described these as his ‘boundaries’.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nDele discussed a range of shocking experiences including being a victim of sexual abuse, dealing drugs at the age of eight, and being hung off a bridge by an adult at the age of 11.\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\nMuch of the media coverage of Tina Turner’s victim-survivor status overlooks the fact that as a black woman she walked a fine line in speaking publicly about her experiences.\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nWe should celebrate that this bill is passing through parliament. But there are 2 key concerns."
