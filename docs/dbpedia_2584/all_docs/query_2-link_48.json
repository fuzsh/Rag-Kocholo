        "text": "Incidents involving All Parties Hurriyat Conference\n\n2012\n\nDecember: 30 The moderate and hard-line factions of the APHC have called for a complete strike on December 31 demanding withdrawal of armed forces from towns and cities and repealing of AFSPA.\n\nApril 25: Jammu and Kashmir Police registered a case against APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, charging him with attempt to murder and stone-pelting. Geelani had gone to North Kashmir on April 6, where he addressed a gathering after offering Friday prayers.\n\nApril 17: A Delhi court commenced the trial of a close aide of APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Ghulam Mohd Bhat, and three others, for allegedly running a hawala (illegal money transfer) racket to fund HM in J&K. The three other accused include Mohammad Siddiq Ganai, Ghulam Jeelani Liloo and Farooq Ahmed Dagga. The court had framed charges against all the four accused under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on March 3, 2012.\n\nThe NIA in 2011 had filed the charge sheet against the four, indicting them for procuring over INR 45.7 million from Pakistan through hawala channels within three years after 2008 for funding the terrorist activities in the Valley. Detailing their modus operandi, the NIA had said Ganai developed a close relationship with Delhi-based Raj Kumar and his brother-in-law Rajeev Nankani and motivated them to collect money on their behalf from hawala operatives in New Delhi.\n\nApril 6: At least 20 people including six Policemen were injured in clashes that broke out in Baramulla town of Baramulla District in the afternoon after protesters pelted stones on the Baramulla Police Station. The protests broke out after the chairman of the hardline faction of Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, addressed a gathering in the Main Chowk of the town.\n\nMarch 30: APHC-M Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is \"supported and controlled\" by ISI, US Attorney Neil H MacBride claimed before the US District Court in Alexandria in Virginia, before the scheduled sentencing of Executive Director of the KAC Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai. MacBride made a 10-page submission to the court. In a footnote, he linked the Mirwaiz to the ISI. Fai submitted the names of 53 individuals from Pakistan, India and the US in his support and all of them have urged the District Judge Liam O'Grady to give Fai a lighter sentence. Mirwaiz is among those who have written letters of support.\n\nFai was sentenced to two years of imprisonment by the court for \"conspiracy to defraud the US\" by concealing the transfer of at least USD 3.5 million from ISI to fund his illegal lobbying efforts on Kashmir.\n\nMarch 1: Delhi Police will question APHC-G Chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani over alleged links with LeT. Reports say Geelani had given a reference letter to the LeT militant, Athesham Malik to obtain a Pakistani visa. Official sources said a copy of the recommendation letter given by Geelani was found in the papers seized from 24-year-old Malik. Athesham Malik was arrested by Delhi Police on February 28 along with another LeT militant Shafaqat.\n\n2011\n\nDecember 16: The 'chairman' of APHC-G, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, stated that the separatist leaders be free and allow their political activities to see who is favoured in the society.\n\nNovember 25: Police on November 25 said that they arrested a person who was about to hand over the snatched pistol of the Military Intelligence (MI) trooper to LeT militants in the Sopore area of Baramulla District. While giving details, Police said they arrested five persons who had assaulted the MI trooper in APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani's rally in Sopore two weeks ago. On the instance of one of the arrested persons, service pistol of the MI trooper was recovered from one Mudasir Ahmad Dar. Police claimed that Mudasir was arrested along with the pistol when he was about to hand it over to the LeT militants. Police said that all the six arrested persons are acting as foot soldiers for Syed Ali Shah Geelani.\n\nNovember 24: Jammu and Kashmir Police refuted the report of a New Delhi-based human rights group alleging rights violation in the arrest of minors saying those mentioned in it face criminal charges. \"Majority of the persons were arrested on the grounds of rape, sodomy, theft, outraging the modesty of women, eve teasing, violation of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic substance act (drug peddling), murder, kidnapping and other heinous social crimes,\" Deputy Inspector General of Police (Srinagar range) Abdul Gani Mir told reporters. \"Majority of these alleged minors are already bailed out, which exposes the sinister designs of separatists (for calling the strike),\" he added. He was reacting to November 25 (today) shutdown call given by APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani to protest against the arrest of alleged minors following the report by Asian Centre for Human Rights. Mir said out of 51 cases mentioned in the report, only 38 belong to Kashmir valley.\n\nOctober 27: Police have busted a LeT module that carried out attacks at Baramulla and Batamaloo on August 25 in which two persons were killed and 13 others were injured, Deputy Inspector General (Central Kashmir) Abdul Gani Mir said. Mir said, \"On August 25, a blast took place at Baramulla in which a civilian and a BSF jawan were killed. An hour later a blast occurred at Batamaloo here in which 13 persons were injured. We launched investigations in both these incidents and it was established that these blasts were carried out on directions of Sopore based Lashkar 'commander' Muza Molvi. Furqan, an ex-filtrated militant of LeT was in contact with Muza Molvi and both of them made the ultimate plan of the twin blasts.\" Mir said that the leads about the involvement of module in militant activities came to fore after the arrest of Muzaffar Ahmad Mir, the militant responsible for the killing of Sajad Ahmad Parray, a Police Constable at Hazratbal on October 14.\n\nHe said five LeT operatives were arrested from different parts of Valley. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted to probe the blasts succeeded in arresting two LeT operatives, identified as Irfan Ashraf Dar and Ali Mohammad, both residents of Reban-Sopore in Baramulla District. Later, one more LeT operative, identified as Tariq, was arrested. Police also arrested one Khalid Ahmad Bhat alias Sajad son of Haji Ghulam Hassan resident of Nagam-Chadoora in Budgam District in connection with the twin blasts at Baramulla and Batamaloo. The DIG said that Haji Ghulam Hassan is an active worker APHC-G.\n\nOctober 24: The APHC-G chairman, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, said Kashmir, in all probabilities, was going to be a part of Pakistan \"had the Indian troops not landed here on the day.\" He also reiterated the call for strike on October 27, 2011.\n\nOctober 20: APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani rebuffed United Jihad Council (UJC) leader and HM chief Syed Salah-ud-Din's appeal against taking to the Union Government, saying he does not take \"dictations''. \"We take our own decisions here and dictations are not taken by us,\" he said while reacting to Salah-ud-Din's statement. Geelani said his Hurriyat faction would accept the Centre's talks offer only after a formal invitation. \"The talks offer in that case will be discussed in the advisory council of (his Hurriyat faction),'' he told reporters. Geelani had earlier ruled out unconditional dialogue with the Centre, saying New Delhi should first accede to his five demands, including demilitarization, as a precondition to the talks.\n\nOctober 18: APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani expressed his willingness to hold talks with the Centre over Kashmir issue. He said he would seek the consent of his colleagues in the advisory committee if the Centre extended an offer for talks. He, however, said that India should first accept his four demands- acknowledgement of Kashmir as an international dispute, demilitarization Jammu and Kashmir, revocation of draconian laws like AFSPA, Public Safety Act etc., release of political prisoners and prosecution of Security Forces responsible for the killing of over 100 people last summer.\n\nSeptember 27: APHC-G alleged that 70 per cent Tehreek-e-Hurriyat (TeH) leadership was serving detention in different prisons since 2010 mass agitation, according to Greater Kashmir. The APHC-G spokesman Ayaz Akbar in a statement said, \"70 per cent of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat leadership is detained in jails since 2010.\" The amalgam has expressed serious concern over the continued detention of the TeH senior leaders, Muhammad Yousuf Fallahi and Peer Saifullah.\n\nSecurity agencies have arrested 98 persons and seized INR 12.3 million since 2009 as part of efforts to check pumping of hawala money into Jammu and Kashmir for funding secessionism and militancy, the State Government informed the Legislative Assembly. Of the arrested persons, 48 were found misusing trade across the Line of Control (LoC) and INR 73, 34,410 along with en-cashed cheque worth INR 100,000 one lakh recovered from them. The highest number of 66 arrests were made in 2009 and INR 7.7 million was recovered that year. Only 15 persons were arrested and nearly INR 1 million was seized from them in 2010. As many as 17 persons were arrested till July 2011 and INR 36, 17,000 were recovered from them, the Government said. The money was meant for Hurriyat Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, Islamic Students Front, Mass Movement, Peoples Conference, Mahaz-e-Azadi and Democratic Freedom Party, besides militant outfits - Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), Al-Badr, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM, Al-Umer, Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, Al-Burq and Islamic Front.\n\nSeptember 12, 2011: APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani rejected the Truth and Reconciliation Commission proposed by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and demanded a UN-fact finding mission to probe the unmarked graves in Jammu and Kashmir. \"We vehemently reject the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as we do not expect justice from the system which is perpetuating human rights violations in the state,\" said Geelani, who is under house arrest. Omar had reiterated his suggestion for setting up of Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the investigative wing of the State Human Rights Commission admitted the existence of over 2,700 unmarked graves at 38 sites in north Kashmir.\n\nSeptember 8: A US secret diplomatic cable revealed that APHC-M chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq wanted LoC to be converted into a permanent border and three separate legislative assemblies for Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir regions with Chief Minister and Governor from each region on rotation basis, according to Indian Express. The cable said the Mirwaiz wanted this \"because he was concerned about his own political future\".\n\nIt adds that the Mirwaiz's proposal - 'United States of Kashmir' - included turning the LoC into a permanent border between India and Pakistan. \"First, the LoC would become border, but every effort would be made by parties on both sides to make it irrelevant similar to the soft barriers that define many of the borders in Europe. Second, both Kashmiri regions of India and Pakistan would be given semi-autonomous status. The proposal would set three separate state assemblies on the Indian side and two on the Pakistani side including Azad Kashmir and northern areas,\" it says.\n\nUnited States Embassy in New Delhi believes that the APHC spearheading the resistance movement in Jammu and Kashmir split in 2003 due to \"proxy participation\" of Abdul Gani Lone-led People's Conference (PC) in the Legislative elections in 2002, Kashmir Dispatch reports citing a Wikileaks cable released recently. The partial extract of the original cable, which details the profile of Kashmir-related leaders, dates back to 2005. The cable while profiling Lone's son, Sajad Gani Lone, who participated in the 2008 state elections, says, \"The Hurriyat split in September 2003 on the issue of People's Conference's proxy participation in 2002 landmark state elections.\" The three-part biographic report compiled \"information academics, journalists, NGO activists and others during a 2002-2005 assignment at embassy New Delhi\" and impressions gained from contact with Kashmir-related politicians, government officials, separatists. Syed Ali Shah Geelani demanded that the PC and the brothers be expelled from the APHC, but the moderates (Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Prof Abdul Ghani Bhat, Maulvi Abbas Ansari and the Lones) resisted, whereupon Geelani took his group out of the Hurriyat, and it has remained deeply split ever since, the US cable read.\n\nSeptember 7: For the second consecutive day, normal life remained affected in Kashmir valley in response to a strike call given by APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Ali Shah Geelani. However, the situation remained peaceful and no reports of protest as well as stone pelting were received from any part of the Valley. As reported earlier, Geelani had called for two day strike (September 6-7) and protests to mount pressure on the State Government to release arrested youth and political prisoners.\n\nSeptember 6: Normal life across Srinagar and other major towns of the Kashmir valley was affected in response to a strike call given by APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Geelani has called for two day strike (September 6-7) and protests to mount pressure on the State Government to release arrested youth and political prisoners. Further, around 100 youth were arrested on charges of stone throwing before Eid from downtown Srinagar area after stone pelters attacked Nowhatta Police Station on August 27.\n\nSeptember 4: A leaked cable highlighted the turf war between rival factions of the APHC. According to the cable, APHC-M leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq had counseled against issuing a passport to APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani for seeking treatment in the United States saying he would \"stir up trouble\". \"When we met Mirwaiz in February, he said it would be a big mistake for the GoI (Government of India) to issue Geelani a passport to travel, because he would stir up trouble\".\n\nSeptember 2: A CRPF trooper was injured in incidents of stone pelting in Baramulla town, according to Daily Excelsior. As soon as APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani finished his speech at General Bus Stand in Baramulla town, groups of youth assembled near the Bus Stand and adjoining markets. They started pelting stones on SFs injuring a CRPF trooper. Stone pelting and protests were also reported from the main market of Sopore. Also, some miscreants attempted to disrupt peace and resorted to stone pelting on SFs' deployments after the Friday prayers at Nowhatta in Srinagar.\n\nMeanwhile, Geelani has called for two day strike, on September 6 and 7, against continuous detention of youth and separatist leaders and threatened more strikes and protests across Kashmir if Government does not release them immediately. He asked people to be ready for a long drawn agitation programme saying that protests would continue unless Government releases all youth arrested in 2010 along with political activists.\n\nAugust 31: APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said that he would come out with a protest programme alleging that most of the youth arrested during 2010 summer agitation are yet to be released. \"Although some of the youth were released, but most of them remained behind bars. The Government is giving an impression that all the youth have been released, but it is not true. Once the Eid celebrations are over an organized agitation programme would be announced and the same would be made public,\" Geelani said while addressing people at Eidgah in Sopore.\n\nAugust 28: Chief Minister Omar Abdullah announced an amnesty package for nearly 1,200 youths arrested during 2010 summer agitation in Kashmir valley. Omar said that the amnesty is for all those booked on charges of stone pelting, except for those involved in cases of arson during the agitation. \"This would be first and last chance for them as we are not going to tolerate their actions in future\", he added. \"The cases of youth involved in arson would be reviewed if the situation remained normal and no unfortunate incidents are reported,\" he asserted. Times of India quoted him as saying, \"(However,) the cutoff date for amnesty is today. We cannot do it again. Anyone arrested till today on stone-pelting charges can avail this amnesty.\" All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) Chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani had earlier set a deadline of Eid-ul-Fitr for the release of all those involved in 2010 summer unrest. The Government had, earlier in the week, released 12 political prisoners, including two close aides of Geelani.\n\nThe hawala money (illegal transfer of money) supplied by Pakistan for the militant 'commanders' and separatists through cross-Line of Control (LoC) trade route of Uri (India)-Muzaffarabad (Pakistan) has been worked out around INR 60-70 million. Some weapons had also been smuggled under the cover of trade items from the same route.\n\nInterrogation of the arrested persons and investigations by the intelligence agencies have revealed that Firdous Ahmed Dar, earlier arrested on August 20, was not the only conduit but nearly half a dozen persons had received hawala money and weapons through the cross-LoC route which had been supplied by Pakistani agencies. Sources said the cash received by the conduits had been distributed among the militant 'commanders' and the separatists according to directions received by them from across the LoC. The 'commanders' of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) and separatists affiliated to All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) were major beneficiaries of the cash sent by Pakistan through the cross-LoC route. Firdous Ahmed Dar along had admitted having received INR 15 million through cross-LoC route of Uri-Muzaffarabad. Of this amount, he had distributed INR 300000 to Aiyaz Akbar, the spokesman of APHC-G and a trusted lieutenant of its chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani, in three equal installments of INR 100000 each.\n\nAugust 26: Clashes broke out between Security Forces and the stone pelting youth in Nowhatta area of Srinagar city after over 100000 people offered payers at Jamia. This is the fourth consecutive Friday when protests and stone pelting took place in Nowhatta area. The recent wave of protests started after chairmen of both the factions of All Party Hurriyat Conference Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Syed Ali Shah Geelani threatened to launch agitation against arrest of youth and curbs on separatist leaders.\n\nAugust 20: Police and Intelligence agencies cracked a major hawala (illegal transfer of money) network being operated by Pakistan through two cross-LoC traders doing business on Uri-Muzaffarabad rout. One of the cross-LoC businessman, arrested by the Security agencies, has confessed having generated INR 15 million through the business transactions and distributed it among several militant leaders and separatists. He has also admitted having paid INR three million in three installments to hard-line Hurriyat Conference spokesman, Aiyaz Akbar, a close aide of All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) Syed Ali Shah Geelani, official sources said. They identified the cross-LoC businessman, who has turned out to be a major hawala operator for Pakistan, as Firdous Ahmed Dar son of Abdul Rashid Dar, a resident of Sangam, Bijbehara in Anantnag District.\n\nAugust 7: APHC-G leader, Syed Ali Geelani, has called for complete shutdown on August 15, the Independence Day of India, according to Kashmir Media Service. Geelani stated, \"The day should be observed as black day and we must remember our martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of Kashmir\".\n\nAugust 5: At least 12 persons were injured as street protests in Jammu and Kashmir. Large number of youth after offering congregational Friday prayers at the Srinagar's Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta took out a rally to protest the curbs on APHC-M chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, by the Government and against alleged custodial killing of Nazim Rashid in Sopore on July 31. The youth pelted stones on the Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). They, in return, resorted to cane charge and fired tear gas shells to stop them from marching ahead. Four protesters were injured in the clashes that followed in Nowhatta, Gojwara and Jamia Masjid areas. Three photo-journalists covering the incident were also injured.\n\nSenior separatist leaders were placed under house arrest ahead of APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani's call for peaceful protests against the alleged custodial death of Rashid. Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and several other leaders, including Shabir Ahmad Shah, Nayeem Ahmad Khan and Shahid-ul-Islam are under house arrest for past several days.\n\nAugust 3: Life in Srinagar and other major towns of the Kashmir valley was affected by a strike call given by APHC-G and supported by APHC-M against the earlier reported alleged custodial killing of Nazim Rashid alias Anjum in Sopore area of Baramulla District on July 31, according to Daily Excelsior. Stray incidents of stone pelting were reported from Maisuma, Nowhatta, Gojwara, Jamia Masjid, Khanyar, Naid Kadal, Saraibal areas of Srinagar city, as well as from various parts Sopore town.\n\nAugust 2: the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has put APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani under the scanner, following investigations of Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) funding for separatists in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The NIA has filed a charge sheet saying that a key aide of Geelani had supplied INR 45.7 million of slush funds from the ISI in Pakistan to the separatists in J&K for secessionist and terror activities. Sources in the Home Ministry say that though NIA has not named Geelani as an accused in their charge sheet, a \"further probe\" is on into his role.\n\nThe main accused in the charge sheet is Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, whom the NIA has identified as the \"legal advisor\" of the APHC-G and Geelani's close aide. Three other J& K residents - Mohd Siddiqui Ganai, Ghulam Jilani Lilo and Farooq Ahmed Dagga - were charge sheeted last week too. NIA has also identified a Hizb-ul-Mujahedeen (HM) 'commander' in Pakistan, Maqbool Pandit, who the NIA claims sent INR 45.7 million since 2008 from Pakistan to a contact of Bhat in Delhi by Hawala. This is the same case in which Delhi Police special cell sleuths had waylaid Geelani near the Delhi Airport on March 1, and had questioned him on his links with Bhat. Geelani was then trying to leave for Srinagar without heeding to a request from the Delhi Police to meet them in connection with this case.\n\nAPHC-M chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq threatened violent protests across Kashmir if the restrictions imposed on the separatist leaders continued. Mirwaiz, while addressing a press conference at his residence, said that he would be forced to ask people to come on streets and lodge protests. \"There are curbs on people and protests against the human rights violations in the Valley are not allowed,\" he alleged, and asserted, \"Our programmes have been peaceful so far and people have been following the same. But the situation is going out of control and peoples' anger has crossed all the limits. I believe there would be violence and agitation if the people are not allowed to register their protest in a peaceful manner.\" He also supported the strike call given by APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani against the killing of Nazim Rashid. \"I am not in favour of strikes but protest in the form of strike is the last resort in Kashmir,\" he added.\n\nA close aide of APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani is among four persons charge sheeted by National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with alleged hawala racket used to channelise money to terrorists of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) in the Kashmir Valley. The chargesheet names Ghulam Mohammed Bhat, Geelani's aide, along with three other accomplices, including Mohd Sidiq Ganai, who had allegedly collected over INR 4.57 crore during a period of three years from January, 2008 through hawala channels from Pakistan for promoting \"terrorist\" activities in the valley. \"The investigation has disclosed that four arrested accused acted as a gang and indulged in unlawful activities pursuant to criminal conspiracy and mobilised/raised funds for terrorist activities and thereby they committed offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,\" said the NIA in its 17-page charge sheet.\n\nThe chargesheet said that \"funds through hawala channels were being sent to Jammu and Kashmir for funding terror and secessionist acts in the state and Pakistan-based Maqbool Pandit, a member of banned Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, and Aizaz Maqbool Bhat, at present living in Saudi Arabia, were the key accused behind it.\" Special judge H S Sharma took the charge sheet on record for taking cognizance and issuing summons to the accused who are at present lodged in Tihar jail in New Delhi.\n\nJuly 31: The Delhi Police has reportedly launched a manhunt for Nasir Safi Mir, who is accused of funding several Hurriyat leaders and is believed to have fled to the Gulf after jumping parole. He was arrested by Delhi Police in February 2006 while carrying INR 55 lakh from a Delhi-based jeweller along with some explosives. He had jumped parole which he had got after several requests made by his family to a court citing medical problems. Mir, against whom a non-bailable warrant was issued in 2009, managed to escape using the Nepal route from where he had used the forged passport procured with the help of a senior separatist leader in Kashmir and officials in security establishment, they said. He reached Dubai after making a detour through Europe and Libya. However, the sources now claim that he has left Dubai as well.\n\nThe name of Mir, a resident of North Kashmir, who ostensibly used carpet trade and later a money exchange business in Dubai for sending hawala money (illegal money transfer) to Hurriyat leaders and other separatists in Kashmir, cropped up when the Government was examining the role of Kashmiri American Council leader Gulam Nabi Fai and whether India could give some additional information to the US, the sources said. Apart from Mir, considered as the \"financial brain\" behind funding of separatist activities in Kashmir, investigators were also probing the role of some senior Government officials who had helped him in securing a passport from a Southern State which helped him to flee from Nepal around October 2008, official sources said.\n\nJuly 29: The chairman of the APHC-M Umar Farooq said the mainstream political parties in J&K represent Indian Government's view point on issue of State and there is no need of Pakistan to hold talks with them. He further said the mainstream parties can't be representatives of the people of the State as they are in power just for their personal interests. He said that for the past three years Omar Abdullah Government is using force to \"quell the genuine voice of the people.\" He also condemned the External Affairs Ministry's objections over meeting of Kashmiri separatists with Pakistani Foreign Minister Hinna Rabbani Khar.\n\nJuly 27: Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that \"there is nothing new in Hurriyat Conference leaders meeting Pakistani dignitaries. This is not happening for the first time and there is nothing to worry about.\" He, however, added, \"If they want inclusion of Kashmiri leadership in the dialogue, then Pakistan will have to talk to the mainstream leadership also.\" He said separatists were not the only leaders in Jammu and Kashmir as the mainstream political parties have proved their representative character from time to time.\n\nJuly 26: Pakistan Minister Hina Rabbani Khar met leaders of both the factions of APHC during which the separatists sought Islamabad's intervention for release of Ghulam Nabi Fai arrested in US for being a front of ISI.\n\nJuly 20: APHC-G leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani was detained by Police in South Kashmir after his supporters clashed with Police. Few people received minor injuries as Police resorted to baton charge on a group of protesters who raised anti-national slogans after Police tried to detain Geelani at Verinag in Anantnag District. An unnamed Police spokesman said, \"Instigated by the speech of Geelani, a small group of miscreants resorted to stone pelting on Police at main market of Verinag in the afternoon.\"\n\nAHHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani said, \"Fai's arrest was carried out at India's behest to weaken the Kashmir's struggle at diplomatic level.\" APHC-M chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said, \"All groups and individuals who are championing the Kashmir cause across the globe are working within the laws of the countries they are in.\" Other separatist leaders like Shabir Ahmad Shah, Mohammad Yasin Malik, Javid Ahmad Mir have strongly condemned Fai's arrest.\n\nJuly 12: Chairman of the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Mirwaiz (APHC-M), Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, described the dialogue process initiated by Centre through Interlocutors as a \"farce\". \"It is a fraud, it is a lie.

Considering the trust deficit between India and Pakistan, the US alone can mediate,'' said the Mirwaiz to reporters at his home.\n\nNovember 3, 2010: Barring couple of stray incidents of stone pelting, the law and order situation in Kashmir Valley remained peaceful even as normal life was disrupted due to strike call given by the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani.\n\nOctober 28, 2010: Shops and business establishments were open and all modes of transport were plying in almost entire Valley, including the summer capital Srinagar, after authorities lifted curfew from Srinagar, Baramulla, Bandipora and Kupwara Districts and APHC-G exempted the day from the purview of its strike calendar. As per the schedule issued by Geelani, there will be no strike on October 29, 2010 also.\n\nOctober 22, 2010: Normal life was disrupted in Kashmir Valley as authorities imposed curfew in several parts of the Valley to foil the plans of the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani to hold a rally in Bijbehara town of Anantnag District. Official sources said curfew was imposed as a precautionary measure in Anantnag, Bijbehara and Shopian towns in South Kashmir to prevent the march to Bijbehara as announced in the 10-day protest schedule by Geelani. Curfew was also imposed in North Zone of Srinagar covering almost entire downtown Srinagar, Kupwara District town, Trehgam, Kralpora, Chotipora, Kulangam and Handwara areas in North Kashmir as these areas have witnessed violent protests after Friday prayers in the beginning of the ongoing unrest in Kashmir valley.\n\nUnion Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Police would take action in accordance with law over the speeches made by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others. Referring to Geelanis speech at a seminar in New Delhi on October 21, 2010 he said, \"If it is established prima facie that the laws have been violated, the Delhi Police will take action in accordance with the law.\"\n\nOctober 21, 2010: Authorities imposed curfew in Srinagar and parts of Baramulla District to foil the plans of the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani to hold a rally at Lal Chowk in Srinagar. \"Curfew was imposed early morning in the areas falling under the jurisdictions of Police Station Kothibagh, Maisuma, Kralkhud, Sadder, Shergari, Shaheedgung, Batamaloo, Safakadal, M.R. Gung, Khanyar, Nowhatta, and Rainawari of Srinagar city,\" a Police spokesman said. He said curfew has also been imposed in Sopore town, Sangrama, Watergam, Dangiwacha and Ladoora areas of Police Station Sopore. The APHC-G, which is spearheading ongoing agitation in the Valley, had called for a march to historic Lal Chowk where the separatist leaders from the amalgam had planned to hold a rally.\n\nHowever, Syed Ali Shah Geelani gave a call for their boycott. Describing the exercise as a ploy of the Government to gain time, Geelani said there was no sincerity towards finding a permanent solution to the Kashmir problem. I am announcing from the platform of this convention on Kashmir that nobody should meet the interlocutors when they visit the State. Do they not know what people in Kashmir want? What will these interlocutors do in their one-year-long mandate? They want to meet students, shopkeepers and everyone else but what do they want to know? Geelani was speaking at Convention on Kashmir  Azadi: The only Way, organised by the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP) in New Delhi.\n\nOctober 18, 2010: The pro-Pakistan Muslim League, a constituent of the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G), Chief Masrat Alam, seen as the spearhead of street protests and stone-pelting in Kashmir Valley for the past four months, was arrested in Srinagar. Underground since June 2010, Alam, was arrested in Tailbal locality on the outskirts of the city. Alam would be booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA), official sources said. Sources said he carried a reward of INR 5 lakh on his head, adds The Hindu. He was seen as the one who chalked out 10-day protest calendars signed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, APHC-G Chairman. Alam has been jailed for more than 10 years on charges, mostly of waging war against the State and acting against national interest. It was in the 2008 uprising against transfer of land to the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board that he devised the Ragda, a dance in which people formed circles, stood shoulder-to shoulder, and stomped their feet shouting anti-India slogans. In 2010, Alam coined the Go India, Go Back slogan.\n\nOctober 15, 2010: The All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani issued a fresh 10-day agitation schedule. While exempting Sundays (October 17 and 24) and the Wednesday (October 20), the remaining seven days have been marked for strikes and protests. Earlier, curfew was imposed in parts of Srinagar, Baramulla, Pulwama and Kupwara Districts of the Valley as a precautionary measure due to apprehensions of violent protests after Friday prayers.\n\nOctober 14, 2020: The Kashmir Valley witnessed a day of normalcy after the Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the Chairman of the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G), exempted the day from protests and strikes. A Police spokesman said, \"The situation throughout the day remained normal and there was no untoward incident reported from anywhere in the Valley.\" He added that curfew restrictions were also lifted from parts of Sopore town in Baramulla District in the night of October 13. However, restrictions under prohibitory orders remained in force at Delina and Palhallan areas of the District as a precautionary measure, the spokesman added.\n\nOctober 13, 2010: Authorities lifted curfew from entire Valley, except parts of Sopore town in Baramulla District. However, normal life remained affected due to the strike called by the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani in his 10-day protest schedule.\n\nOctober 13, 2010: The All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) rejected as a \"futile exercise\" the Centres appointment of interlocutors saying that no dialogue can be held for resolution of Kashmir issue unless the Centre acts on the five-point proposal mooted by him in August 2010 for normalisation of situation in the Valley. Separately, APHC-Mirwaiz termed the appointment as yet another non-serious initiative, adds The Hindu. The Government should first identify the reason to appoint the interlocutors. The dialogue process is step two. Step one is that the ground realities should change first. Dialogue and oppression cannot go together, said the APHC-Mirwaiz chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, adding, that until the Government acted upon his party's four-point programme, the moderate Hurriyat will not enter into any dialogue.\n\nOctober 12, 2010: Curfew was imposed on most parts of the Kashmir Valley to foil a march planned by the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) to Hyderpora in Srinagar, where its chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani has been under house arrest for some time. The march was called by Massarat Alam Bhat, a Geelani confidant.\n\nOctober 11, 2010: Authorities imposed curfew across Kashmir Valley to foil the proposed march to Hyderpora called by the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) on October 12, 2010. Curfew has been imposed across Srinagar District,\" District Magistrate Srinagar Mehraj Ahmad Kakroo said. An unnamed Police spokesman said the authorities have decided to impose Valley-wide strict curfew restrictions on October 12 following Hyderpora Chalo (March to Hyderpora) call given by the APHC-G. Underground separatist leader Masrat Alam has called a march to Hyderpora residence of chairman of the APHC-G Syed Ali Shah Geelani who has been under house arrest for nearly one month now.\n\nOctober 10, 2010: Stone-pelting incidents were reported from several parts of the Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar city, Sopore, Shopian and Pulwama towns, during a strike called by the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Elsewhere in the Valley, the law and order situation remained by and large peaceful. Further, while Geelani remained under house arrest for the past 28 days, similar restrictions were imposed on chairman of APHC-Mirwaiz Mirwaiz Moulvi Omar Farooq.\n\nOctober 7, 2010: At least three students were injured as protestors pelted stones at school buses at two places in Kashmir Valley, where the Syed Ali Shah Geelani led All Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G)-sponsored strike disrupted life with shops and business establishments in the main markets closed and public transport off the roads.\n\nOctober 5, 2010: Authorities imposed curfew in some parts of the Valley to foil the call for a march to Kupwara District given by All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-Geelani) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani even.\n\nOctober 3, 2010: Chairman of both the factions of the All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Syed Ali Shah Geelani of APHC-Geelani and Mirwaiz Omar of APHC-Mirwaiz remained under house arrest while other separatist leaders also remained confined to their homes because of curfew restrictions. Geelani remained under house arrest for the past 20 days.\n\nSeptember 29, 2010: Kashmir Valley returned to normalcy. As the law and order situation improved, the authorities lifted curfew from Kupwara and Ganderbal Districts. In addition, a Police spokesman said, \"Curfew was relaxed in south, west and east zones of Srinagar city from 8.00 am to 10.00 am, but the relaxation was later extended till further orders.\" Meanwhile, All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) Chairman Syed Ahmad Shah Geelanis decision to exempt the day from strikes and protests saw a massive 26 per cent more students attend schools as many private educational institutions opened, two days after the Government announced its plans to restart learning process in the Valley even during curfew days. While only 41 per cent of the students had attended classes across Kashmir Valley on September 28, the figure on September 29 stood at 67 per cent.\n\nSeptember 27, 2010: Schools across Kashmir Valley reopened after remaining shut for 100 days due to civil disturbances. Attendance was, however, thin in the wake of All Party Hurriyat ConferenceGeelani (APHC-G) leader Syed Ali Shah Geelanis call to parents not to send their wards to schools and colleges. Further, the All Party Hurriyat ConferenceMirwaiz (APHC-M) rejected Centres latest initiative on Kashmir, saying it was \"disappointing\" as it reflected lack of willingness to meet the aspirations of the people. The APHC-G has already rejected the package as a \"mere eye-wash\".\n\nSeptember 26, 2010: Differences came to the fore among separatists as Mohammad Yasin Malik-led Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) took exception to All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani''s remarks that Jammu and Kashmir could not survive as an independent country. \"We respect every leader and the party associated with the on-going movement in Kashmir. But, we request the leaders not to issue statements which can lead to chaos and confusion among the people,\" several JKLF leaders said in a statement. The leaders, without mentioning Geelani, were reacting to his interview to a private news channel on September 25 in which he had said Jammu and Kashmir would have to accede either to Pakistan or India as it could not survive as a sovereign State. The JKLF leaders said there were many countries smaller than Jammu and Kashmir in terms of resources, area and population which had survived. This is for the first time during the current unrest in the Valley that separatist leaders have publicly voiced their differences over resolution of the Kashmir issue.\n\nSeptember 14, 2010: The All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G), which is spearheading the agitation, issued a fresh 11-day protest calendar, calling for complete shutdowns barring September 19 and 22 and a march to the local office of United Nations Military Observers Group for India and Pakistan at Sonawar on September 20. According to the calendar, the APHC-G asked people to go for normal activities between 7pm to 7am during the strike days, seeking to reverse the biological clock.\n\nSeptember 13, 2010: Police arrested 52 activists of All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Muslim League headed by Massarat Aalam for allegedly instigating violence in the Budgam District. \"From Budgam District alone, we have arrested 52 persons and all of them belonged to APHC-G and Muslim League,\" Director General of Police (DGP) Kuldeep Khoda told reporters. He said all the arrested persons were \"caught in action\" while fuelling violence in the District. Khoda said more arrests have been effected in other parts of the Valley and the figures were being consolidated.\n\nThe DGP also played out two intercepted telephonic conversations between a close associate of Geelani and a foot-worker talking about mobilising people for holding protests in Budgam. \"You can very well draw conclusions how the crowds are being gathered and instigated to resort to violence,\" Khoda said. In one of the intercepts, Imtiyaz Haider, who is a close confidant of Geelani, tells the person on the other side to assemble people from Budgam and adjoining areas for holding protests. Although Haider purportedly talks about not attacking the Security Forces (SFs) or their installations, the DGP said \"you have seen what happens after the people are gathered.\" Asked if the incidents of violence today were only due to the alleged desecration incident in the United States, Khoda said \"the violence levels had been coming down but the alleged desecration which is yet to be ascertained gives an opportunity to the separatists to disrupt the situation.\"\n\nSeptember 12, 2010: Police registered cases against Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of All Party Hurriyat Conference-Mirwaiz (APHC-M) and other separatist leaders for allegedly inciting September 11 violence during which Government properties were set ablaze by mobs.\n\nSeptember 8, 2010: Police arrested All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) leader Syed Ali Geelani from his residence in Srinagar and lodged him in a local police station, according to The Hindu. His arrest sparked protests in many areas. Geelani had planned certain programmes which could have disturbed the public order. Anticipating the developments his plans would have caused, he was arrested and lodged in Police Post, Humhama,. Police sources said Geelani would be kept in custody till Eid. He was earlier arrested on June 20 as a preventive measure after violence rocked Srinagar in the wake of the killing of youth in Srinagar. On June 23, he was booked under the Public Safety Act by the District Magistrate, Srinagar, for waging war against the State and lodged in the Chesmashahi jail. He was released on August 4, after which he called for peaceful protests. Before his arrest, Geelani warned that the APHC-G would intensify its protests if New Delhi refused to accept his five-point formula. Geelani said people should continue to follow the Hurriyat programme, but reiterated his appeal to youth to remain peaceful during their pro-freedom demonstrations.\n\nSeptember 7, 2010: Curfew was clamped in Srinagar city and restrictions imposed in rest of the Valley as authorities apprehended large scale protests over the killing of four protesters in the Palhalan area of Baramulla District on September 6. Meanwhile, a Police spokesman said situation across the Valley remained by and large peaceful barring few stray incidents of stone pelting at Singhpora, Tappar in Baramulla, Chinkipora, Bomai in Sopore, Kangan Bazaar, near DC office in Shopian, Nowgam and Tengpora By pass in Srinagar. Meanwhile, the most wanted separatist leader, Massarat Alam Bhat, surfaced in Srinagar in the night of September 6, joining a protest and then addressing a gathering in a local mosque where he declared that Kashmiris will soon get freedom. He asked the people to continue the protest until freedom is achieved, adding, This is a do-or-die situation for us. Going against All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) leader Syed Ahmad Shah Geelanis call for peaceful protests, Alam justified stone-throwing, saying, Any action targeted at Government Forces is legitimate. He, however, asked the protesters not to target civilians.\n\nSeptember 6, 2010: Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that the Centre would soon respond to the All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) leader Syed Ali Shah Geelanis five points pre-condition for talks and hinted at either phase withdrawal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) or softening some of its hard options. \"The Central Government has several times stated that within and outside the Parliament that talks were the only solution to Kashmir problem, he said, adding that a unique solution had to be found to the problem since ikhlaq (accession) of the State was also held under unique circumstances. He made it clear that no individual represents the entire State or the Vaadi (Kashmir Valley).\n\nAugust 31, 2010: The All Party Hurriyat Conference-Geelani (APHC-G) leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said the ongoing protests could be reviewed and a dialogue with the Centre initiated if it fulfils five preconditions. Addressing a press conference the separatist leader said he was \"responding to the willingness shown by Indian leadership to engage in a dialogue with Jammu and Kashmir leadership\". Geelani, however, stuck to his stand that India must consider Jammu and Kashmir issue as an international dispute, but refrained from repeating his usual demands about implementation of UN resolutions and involvement of Pakistan in talks. Meanwhile, ruling out any talks with the Union Government at present, All Party Hurriyat Conference-Mirwaiz (APHC-M) Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said his faction has taken an initiative for unity among separatists under the present scenario. In an interview to a local news agency, KNS, he said APHC-M will get in touch with APHC-G chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani within two days in this connection. We have formed a two member committee for establishing contact with other pro-freedom groups, Mirwaiz said. He rejected autonomy and self-rule.\n\n2009\n\nDecember 5, 2009: Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has called for a general strike in the Valley as a mark of protest. He told that the elements behind the attack were scared that their shops will be shut in case of resolution of Kashmir issue through a dialogue process. He asserted that talks with India and Pakistan for resolution of Kashmir issue will go ahead. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah described the attack as a well-thought out attempt to derail the peace process. \"It is the most unfortunate incident and a well thought out attempt to derail the peace process and deny people of the State a peaceful atmosphere they have a right to,\" Omar said. Describing Qureshi as a pro-dialogue individual and among the most reasonable separatist leaders, Omar said he was one of the separatist leaders who wanted to find a solution to the Kashmir problem at the negotiating table. The Chief Minister said Qureshi was offered security on various occasions but he turned it down. A member of the decision-making Executive Committee of the Hurriyat Conference, Qureshi had played a key role in facilitating talks between the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) and the Government in 2000 following a cease-fire in July that year. He was also part of the Hurriyat delegation that held talks with the then Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani in 2004.\n\nOctober 14, 2009: Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Centre will hold talks with mainstream political parties like National Conference, People''s Democratic Party, Congress and other smaller parties. Without naming any separatist outfit, he added that the dialogue process will also include other groups which are not organized and are referred to as extremists. However, the Home Minister declined to answer a question as to whether a formal invitation will be extended to the groups like the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC). On the alleged non-implementation of reports submitted by the working groups formed after Round Table Conference convened by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2005, the Home Minister said \"these reports are being absorbed in our Kashmir plan. It is not right that these are being ignored.\"\n\nApril 23, 2009: A faction of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) issued a boycott call for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections in the State saying elections have no locus standi in the resolution of Kashmir issue. Seeking to clarify the earlier statement of the amalgam about not giving a boycott call, Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq said \"we have asked the people to stay away from the futile exercise of elections which means that they should boycott the polls.\" Asked if the Hurriyat will launch a boycott campaign, he said leaders and the units of the amalgam were already out in the field trying to make people aware about their duties and responsibilities towards the \"freedom movement\".\n\nUmer, who chaired a two-day emergency session of the Hurriyat, said elections in the State will have no bearing on the status of the Kashmir issue as there are United Nations resolutions and international laws which hold that elections have no locus standi in disputed regions. \"United Nations resolutions are clear that elections held in the State have no bearing on the Kashmir issue. Elections have been held since 1947 in the State but have failed to yield a solution. Elections cannot be a substitute to right to self determination,\" he added. He said there were many examples whereby elections were held in conflict zones after reaching a settlement and not before that. Mirwaiz reiterated that Kashmir was a political problem and not a territorial or border dispute between India and Pakistan which the two countries can resolve bilaterally. Last week, the Hurriyat Conference had said it will not issue a boycott call for the elections as it was a non-issue for the amalgam and will leave the decision to vote or not to vote to the conscience of the people.\n\nApril 16, 2009: A faction of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) headed by Mirwaiz Umar Farroq said it will leave to the conscience of the voters whether to vote or not during the forthcoming Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) elections in the State. \"We will have to call a spade a spade. Boycott in Jammu and Kashmir is not possible. The people in Jammu will vote, Ladakh will vote, Bhaderwah, Kishtwar and Doda will vote the frontier regions will vote. That is why we will not use the term boycott but elections remains a non-issue for Hurriyat and it will not affect Kashmir issue,\" former chairman of Hurriyat Conference Abdul Gani Bhat told reporters in Srinagar.\n\nThe other Hurriyat faction led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani has already called for a boycott of the elections and a general strike on the days of polling. Although elections were held for the Jammu-Poonch Lok Sabha seat on April 16, the strike call had no effect on the normal life in the Valley. Bhat said Hurriyat will go to the people and tell them consider the fact that pro-India politicians were gloating about the results of the Assembly elections. \"We have been talking about this issue (boycott) for past three-four months. We will ask the people to consider the pro-India leadership gloating about the results of previous elections. We will leave the decision to the people,\" he said. He said while his faction of Hurriyat did not deny the right of other separatists to call for boycott of the elections, they should also not be denied their right to call the polls a non-issue.\n\nJanuary 11, 2009: Nasir Safi Mir, alleged to be the financial brain behind All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and other separatist leaders, has managed to flee the country after getting a forged passport from a southern State even as Delhi Police claimed that they were still looking for him. Mir against whom a non-bailable warrant was issued, had allegedly bribed some officials of a southern State and made his passport after which he took a route to Nepal and then to Europe. From Europe he was reported to have flown to Libya before finally reaching Dubai, sources said. Mir, was earlier arrested by Delhi Police in February 2006 while ferrying INR 5500000 from a Delhi-based jeweler along with some explosives, but had jumped parole which he had got after several requests made by his family to the court citing medical problems. The 38-year-old Dubai-based businessman, who owns a carpet showroom and money exchange firms in Gulf, had been regularly reporting to the nearest police station till October 2008, but after that he did not turn up either at the police station nor on the hearing date of the court. According to recent technical intercepts, Mir allegedly spoke to the separatist leadership after reaching Dubai.\n\n2008\n\nJanuary 23, 2008: All the separatist and militant groups in Jammu and Kashmir have called for a general strike on January 26 and to observe the Republic day as \"black day\", while security arrangements have been tightened ahead of the occasion across the State. Security arrangements have been geared up as the security forces have intensified search operations and security checks across the valley. These have been further intensified in and around Bakshi Stadium, the venue of main Republic day celebrations and also around the vital installations in the summer capital. Both factions of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Mirwaiz and Geelani, and other constituent groups and the militant outfits have called for a general strike on the occasion and asked the people to remain indoors.\n\nJanuary 14, 2008: Senior separatist leader Shabir Ahmad Shah formally joined the secessionist conglomerate the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and invited breakaway Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani for talks to clarify on his six-point unity formula. Shah announced his decision in the presence of APHC chairman, Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, at the martyrs graveyard at Idgah in capital Srinagar. Shah said that the APHC leaders would launch a State-wide campaign making it an organisation at the grassroots level in all three regions of Kashmir, Ladakah and Jammu.\n\n2007\n\nNovember 4, 2007: Police arrested G M Bhat, a close associate of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani from Srinagar following disclosures made by three hawala (illegal money transfer) operators, who were arrested from Udhampur on November 3, 2007 along wit a hawala consignment of INR 4.6 million. The operators revealed that the money was being smuggled for Bhat from New Delhi to Srinagar. Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Udhampur range Alok Puri, confirming the arrest of Bhat said that a case against Bhat has been registered in FIR No. 252 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act along with three other accused.\n\nJune 8, 2007: A purported al Qaeda compact disc (CD) is reported to have referred to Kashmir as \"gateway of Jihad against India\". The Government of India has reportedly ordered an investigation to judge the authenticity of the CD that carried a recorded statement of an Urdu speaking masked gunman. Personnel of the Srinagar-based Kashmir News Service told that an unidentified man delivered a CD besides a five-page statement in Urdu, purportedly from chief of \"Al-Qaeda Fil Hind\", Abu Abdul Rehman Ansari. The statement, read out in Urdu in the CD by a masked gunman, Abu Ibrahim Al-Aasim, criticized all factions of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and the Muzaffarabad-based alliance of militant outfits, Muttahida Jihad Council (MJC) for \"misleading the Kashmiris into the quagmire of UN resolutions and politics of shutdowns and demonstrations.\"\n\nApril 18, 2007: Chairman of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Mirwaiz (a hereditary title of one of Kashmir's important religious seats, and also head priest of the Jamia Masjid) Umar Farooq, has rejected the Centre's invitation for Prime Minister's 3rd Round Table Conference on Kashmir, scheduled to be held in New Delhi on April 24. He said that the Hurriyat would participate only in such a political exercise that would involve leadership from both sides including the Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Mirwaiz Umar said during a public meeting at Sumbal that If President Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were to be present with top leadership from both countries and all parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Hurriyat would not hesitate to participate in the Round Table Conference. He also urged the Centre to announce a cease-fire in Jammu and Kashmir, and claimed that the Hurriyat will persuade the militant leadership to reciprocate, UNI reported. If India takes one step, we will take ten. If India announces complete cease-fire, the Hurriyat Conference will persuade the militant leadership to reciprocate, he said.\n\nApril 4, 2007: The Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) has called for the formation of an 'Elders Council'-comprising both factions of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Bar Association and Kashmiri intellectuals - and asked the Kashmiri separatist leaders to unite on one platform \"at this crucial juncture.\" LeT spokesman Abdullah Ghaznavi asked the two factions of the separatist Hurriyat Conference to unite on one platform \"at this crucial juncture\" and salvage the \"freedom movement\" from the quagmire of failure. \"If the (split) Hurriyat leaders failed to sink their differences and unite on one platform and a solution (of the Kashmir problem), not in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people was allowed to be imposed, history would never forgive these leaders,\" the spokesman said. He added that the \"freedom movement\" had entered into a critical phase and required to be actively guided by an \"Elders Council\" comprising leaders of the united Hurriyat, Kashmir Bar Association and Kashmiri intellectuals.\n\nFebruary 22, 2007: India and Pakistan should not allow incidents like the Samjhauta Express blasts to disrupt the ongoing talks and both the countries should \"institutionalise\" and \"take forward\" the ongoing peace process in the larger interest of their people, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) said. \"Delhi and Islamabad must institutionalise and consolidate peace process so that people-centric CBMs are taken and the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir improves,\" Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told reporters after an almost two-hour-meeting with the visiting Pakistan Foreign Minister Khursheed Mahmood Kasuri at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi. \"The peace process must be taken forward and Hurriyat supports both India and Pakistan for this initiative,\" Farooq said.\n\nFebruary 2, 2007: Islamabad Police arrested 40 students of a Madrassa (seminary) in connection with a protest demonstration by the banned Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) held during the visit of an All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) delegation. Islamabad Senior Superintendent of Police Sikandar Hayat said the police initially arrested 100 students, of which 40 were identified with the help of a video of the protest. The students had protested against the APHC, which supports resolution of the Kashmir issue through dialogue. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and President Pervez Musharraf had reportedly expressed displeasure with the city administration for allowing the banned group to organise the demonstration.\n\nJanuary 31, 2007: In the second attack by militants targeting the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) in three weeks, militants hurled a grenade on the headquarters of the group at Rajbagh in the capital Srinagar. The grenade exploded in the compound, without causing any damage. None of the top Hurriyat leaders was present in the office when the grenade was hurled. The grenade attack comes in the wake of threats from militant outfits for the statement by APHC Chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq during his recent tour to Pakistan that separatist violence in Jammu and Kashmir had failed to achieve anything.\n\nJanuary 23, 2007: In Pakistan, the visiting All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq met several members of the United Jihad Council (UJC), an amalgam of various Pakistan-based terrorist groups, and sought their co-operation for the peace process between India and Pakistan, Press Trust of India reported. \"There are many groups and leaders from the UJC who are supportive of the process. In the UJC, there are about 18 parties. People have been coming individually and meeting us. There are groups and leaders. They are quite keen that this process should move further,\" Farooq said. His remarks came ahead of a conference of moderate leaders convened by him and the political leadership of Pakistan occupied-Kashmir on January 26. However, the Mirwaiz clarified that he had no meeting with HM Chief Syed Salahuddin, who is also the Chairman of the UJC.\n\nJanuary 21, 2007: The United Jihad Council (UJC), a conglomerate of Pakistan-based terrorist groups, has rejected the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooqs call to give up armed struggle to pave way for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Kashmir issue. Militant leaders have been shocked by the \"baseless\" and \"uncalled\" for statement of the Mirwaiz and his colleagues who are \"ignorant of the background and realities of Kashmir issue,\" a spokesman for the UJC said in a statement issued from Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). \"The statement of Mirwaiz may please some Western circles and Indian leaders, but it cannot change the ground realities,\" he said referring to Farooqs comments that it was time to give up armed struggle to pave way for fruitful negotiations to reach a lasting settlement of the Kashmir issue.\n\nJanuary 19, 2007: The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, called for giving up armed struggle to pave the way for fruitful negotiations for a lasting settlement of the Kashmir issue. The Mirwaiz (a hereditary title of one of Kashmir's important religious seats, and also head priest of the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar), who along with other senior leaders of the APHC, is on a visit to Pakistan, stated this after a series of meetings in Islamabad, including talks with President Pervez Musharraf. Speaking at a dinner meeting with Azad Kashmir (Pakistan occupied Kashmir) Prime Minister Sardar Attique, the APHC leader said peaceful negotiations were the only way out. According to him, \"We have already seen the results of our fight on the political, diplomatic and military fronts which have not achieved anything other than creating more graveyards.\" The Mirwaiz said some people involved in the struggle could still have some reservations, but as far as the APHC was concerned, \"we are not prepared to sacrifice any more of our loved ones.\" He said with their new strategy they would convince India to arrive at a more agreeable settlement.\n\nEarlier in the day, the APHC leaders held a meeting with President Pervez Musharraf, which reportedly focused on the Presidents proposals which include self-governance, demilitarisation and joint control of the territory. Meanwhile, even as this meeting was underway, hundreds of Jihadis and their supporters from the hard-line Islamic groups reportedly protested on the streets of Islamabad, condemning any attempt to compromise on Pakistans long-standing position on Kashmir.\n\nJanuary 17, 2007: The call for a shutdown by a faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani affected normal life in the capital Srinagar. Over 50 vehicles were damaged in stone pelting by Geelani followers at different places. The shutdown call was given by Geelani seeking Jammu and Kashmirs protest against the rival faction chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooqs visit to Pakistan as also his efforts to enter a dialogue process, separately with India and Pakistan, over the Kashmir issue. The call was reportedly supported by the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.\n\nJanuary 15, 2007: Suspected militants carried out a grenade blast at the house of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, in the Nageen area of Capital Srinagar. However, no loss of life or injuries was reported. The Mirwaiz, who was in Jammu at the time of the attack, said he would not be cowed down by such attempts, according to Indian Express. The explosion was reportedly claimed by the Save Kashmir Movement. Farooq is to leave for New Delhi on January 17 and then travel to Pakistan for a dialogue with President Pervez Musharraf.\n\n2006\n\nDecember 17, 2006: The United Jihad Council (UJC) has decided to step up its political and diplomatic activities to push for Kashmirs accession to Pakistan, after what it perceives is Pakistans shifting stance on Kashmir. Sources privy to a two-day meeting of the UJC held recently in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Pakistan occupied Kashmir [PoK]), told that the councils leadership expressed serious concern over a recent Foreign Office statement that Pakistan has never called Kashmir an integral part of the country. The leaders opined that it was time for the UJC to come out of its slumber the sources said. Most of the council members and close aides of Syed Salahuddin, the Chief of the UJC and Hizbul Mujahiddeen, asked him to come forward and play his role, the sources said. The leaders felt that this would also strengthen Syed Ali Shah Geelani, chief of a hard-line faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC).
