        "text": "Sheikh Jibran Ajaz, MD\n\nMedical School: Government Medical College Srinagar\n\nProfessional Career Interests: Still deciding but I do really enjoy Cardiology\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: I really liked the program faculty and residents as I interviewed with them. Also, St Maryâ€™s and Covenant, being the major health care providers to the community in the area, promised a diverse exposure to pathology, while the affiliation with CMU provided a robust structure for academics and research. The beautiful landscape and lakes of Michigan were the icing on the cake.\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: Cycling, swimming, working out and essentially all sports\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: Still exploring Michigan\n\nWasef Al-Khateeb, MD\n\nMedical School: Marmara University School of Medicine\n\nProfessional Career Interests: Pulm/Crit, Cardiology\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: Being here, it feels like I am a part of one big family, all working towards the same goal. Everybody here wants to see you grow and would support you in any shape of form.\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: SPORTS, all of them, especially soccer, and volleyball. Also, a big fan of escape rooms.\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: I want to visit all the lakes, starting from Lake Huron. There are a lot of places I want to go to and many restaurants I want to eat at.\n\nLahib Douda, MD\n\nMedical School: AUC School of Medicine\n\nProfessional Career Interests: Hospitalist\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: I chose CMU because it stood out as an academic residency based in a community setting that cares for both the local population and that of several other hospitals. This combination is unique in that it offers the best of both worlds in a seamless way!\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: Spending time with my family and friends, doing projects around the house and playing video games.\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: Enjoying the different seasons, trying new restaurants and going up north.\n\nRobert Kasemodel, MD\n\nMedical School: Medical College of Wisconsin\n\nProfessional Career Interests: Rural medicine, cardiology, critical care medicine, pre-operative medicine\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: I'm originally from Ann Arbor, MI so I was looking for a program close to home. Additionally, I was impressed by the emphasis on critical care medicine and procedural proficiency at CMU. We don't have fellows to compete with for procedures so you have the opportunity to gain some really impressive procedural skills in the inpatient setting.\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: Tennis, FIFA, board games, camping, working out\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: Camping at Nordhouse Dunes on Lake Michigan, going up north to explore the lakes and nature, spending time with friends in Ann Arbor, and trying new restaurants in the Detroit Metro area.\n\nMatthew Kunz, MD\n\nMedical School: Wayne State University School of Medicine\n\nProfessional Career Interests: Anything that offers more opportunities for procedures, included but not limited to cardiology, pulmonology/critical care, GI, etc. I have not ruled out pursuing primary care nor working as a hospitalist either, as these offer a greater diversity in problems I could see and help patients with.\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: I chose CMU because they offer many opportunities for procedural work. I am glad that without extra effort I am able to get access to these moments. Additionally, you can add on procedures by pursuing them. The atmosphere and interpersonal relationships between residents and faculty was pleasant, both prior to and during residency. Additionally the X+Y schedule system is more humane, in my view. This system allows one to be constantly learning without feeling bogged down by month long rotations. I appreciated having the separation of ambulatory clinic and in-patient services, not every program offers this. Additionally, the faculty are warm and receptive to your concerns and support your growth not only as a physician, but as a person, too. The program has great faculty that want to build something special here. CMU was an obvious choice for me.\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: I enjoy fishing, kayaking, biking, soccer, and weight lifting among other typical activities. I also enjoy making metal model sets of random things (such as tanks, and architecture, the most recent one took a month and it was of the Notre Dame Cathedral).\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: I enjoy being on the water, camping up North at Pictured Rocks. I am originally from the metro-Detroit area so I love going to the Red Wings games at the LCA. There are plenty of things and sites to see in the mitten state!\n\nGeorge Mathew, MD\n\nMedical School: K.S. Hegde Medical Academy, Mangalore\n\nProfessional Career Interests: I am currently interested in pursuing a career in academic Oncology, likely hematological and GI malignancies. I am still open to other options and look forward to exploring different subspecialties during residency.\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: CMU offers a unique program that provides a good balance between academic medicine and clinical research. The faculty are very supportive and provide a nurturing environment. This program offers broad clinical experience from two different training hospitals, with world-class SIM lab facilities that deliver an excellent opportunity for procedural skills training.\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: I enjoy traveling to different places, exploring various cultures, and spending time with friends and family. I am always excited to try new restaurants (notably Middle Eastern cuisine!). Also, fond of being involved in church activities\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: I'm still exploring the beautiful state of Michigan\n\nAmaka Merah, MD\n\nMedical School: Ross University School of Medicine\n\nProfessional Career Interests: I am particularly interested in Pulmonary/Critical Care, but I'm still exploring different paths as I have so many interests within the field of Internal Medicine\n\nWhy did you choose CMU: It was very important to me that my program was supportive of the growth and well-being of its residents, and CMU does exactly that. The IM faculty, residents, and the rest of the staff at Ascension St. Mary's and Covenant are approachable and knowledgeable, and they foster an environment that inspires me to be a better physician every day.\n\nPersonal Hobbies/Interests: Cooking/Baking, Travelling, Photography, and spending time with my husband\n\nFavorite Things to do around Michigan: I'm still exploring Michigan, but I've enjoyed visiting Lake Huron and Frankenmuth."
