        "text": "The commitment of North-West Frontier Province Pakhtun religious politics towards the quest for a society and state governed by religious leaders was directed through the colonial period, and into the national period, predominantly by the ulama known as Deobandis. These ulama took their title from the madrasa Darul Ulum Deoband in the United Provinces in north-India and came to prominence through championing Muslim interests in colonial NWFP. After the partition of the Indian subcontinent and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the United Provinces remained in India, separating Pakistani scholars trained in Deoband from Indian Deobandi theologians, and indeed from the school itself. But these ulama continued to call themselves Deobandis and were central to the successful demand for the constitutional declaration of Pakistan as an Islamic state; and brought Islam to bear on national and provincial legislation from positions in parliament. Increasingly well-organised and well-funded, NWFP Deobandi ulama established madrasas and mosques in the province, strengthening the preserve of religion and their own authority. When the Afghan resistance to the Soviet occupation began in 1978, a section of the resistance organisation working in exile in Peshawar gravitated towards these Deobandi institutions, drawing the Deobandi ulama of the NWFP into the jihad. Sustaining links to the Afghan fighters even after the withdrawal of the Soviets, the NWFP Deobandis contributed to and encouraged the emerging organisation of the Taliban, becoming champions of their reactionary brand of Islam.\n\n23 The JUH central organisation had highlighted and organised around three central issues during the 1927–1935 period – the Rangila Rasul movement, the Sarda act, and the Shahidganj Mosque protection. The Rangila Rasul agitation was sparked over a book published in 1924 by a Hindu, Rajpal, that described the Prophet Mohammad as a self-indulgent philanderer. The Sarda Act was a piece of legislation that had raised the legal age for marriage from twelve to fourteen years this was declared to be an unacceptable interference by the government in a matter governed by religion. The agitation over the Sarda Act was exacerbated by the feeling that Hindus supported the legislation. The Shahidganj mosque issue contested the site of a mosque built in the Mughal Aurangzeb's times that had been taken over as a Sikh gurdwara in the nineteenth century. This issue became a highlight of public controversy once again in the 1930s. Because of the distinct Hindu-Muslim tensions surrounding these three issues, the activities of the JUH have generally been classed as ‘communalist’ – a part of the Hindu-Muslim opposition.\n\n64 Highly regarded Deobandi scholars in the United Provinces tried to prevent such an accord developing in the NWFP. Madni was critical of the Muslim League, accusing its members of undermining the anti-colonial cause by accepting favours from, and working with, the British administration. Anwar Shah Kashmiri, a prominent Ahrar party member who ultimately left the Darul Ulum Deoband and then died in 1933, was a strong proponent of the Congress non-cooperation and civil disobedience method in the NWFP. See Madni to unknown, Jamadi-ul Awal 1366, in Naziuddin Islahi (ed.) Maktubat-i Sheikhul Islam, vol. II (Saharanpur, 1950); and Kashmiri, Khutba-yi Sadarat, 1927."
