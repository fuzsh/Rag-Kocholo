        "text": "In an epic journey in the making for 10 years, Sunny Jain was the first in his family to return to their ancestral land, Sialkot, Punjab, since the 1947 independence and partition of the Indian subcontinent. Jain walked the streets his elders traversed, received an overwhelming “welcome home” and even found the house his father had to flee over 75 years ago. As his Wild Wild East ensemble was on tour in Pakistan during this trip, the band decided to go into the studio that very night after the remarkable finding. Recording engineers, Asad Ali Khan and Amr Kashmiri, captured the palpable emotions in the air during the session at Art Club Sugar Records in Lahore. The cover art for the singles are from a temple in Sialkot where Jain’s ancestors would worship. It’s one of the last few standing Jain Temples in Pakistan and was opened up specifically for him.\n\n”Belonging,\" transports listeners on a mesmerizing journey that contemplates the human experience of migration and finding the feeling of home in a place unknown. Combining Jain's signature dhol drumming and effects, with lush melodies from vocalist Ben Parag, the track is a testament to the power of rhythm and voice to uplift and inspire."
