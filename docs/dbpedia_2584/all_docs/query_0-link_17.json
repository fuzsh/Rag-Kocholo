        "text": "The Lieutenant Governor (L-G) of Delhi on Wednesday increased the monthly relief package given to Kashmiri migrant families living in the city from Rs 10,000 to Rs 27,000 per month.\n\nThe LG also approved the addition of names to the Kashmiri Migrant Cards issued by the Delhi government. It will allow the grown up and married children of migrants, to get their own Kashmiri Migrant Cards and become eligible for AMR.\n\nadvertisement\n\nApart from this, the LG also allowed the inclusion of a non-migrant girl marrying into a migrant family as a member of the Kashmiri migrant family.\n\nThe Adhoc Monthly Relief (AMR) was introduced by the government in 1989-90 to support the relief and rehabilitation of Kashmiri families which were uprooted during the militancy.\n\nThis increase came after 16 years. Earlier, in 2007, the AMR was increased from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 by the government.\n\nCurrently, 2,000 Kashmiri families are benefiting from the scheme. However, the number is likely to go up by nearly 70 per cent as there is a spike in the number of family members.\n\nAccording to the officials, there will be a mandatory Aadhaar seeding of data for family members eligible for AMR. The payment of relief will only be through an Aadhaar-based payment system.\n\nDELHI AND UNION GOVERNMENT'S SHARE\n\nCurrently, AMR is paid to a Kashmiri migrant family at the rate of Rs 3,250 per person per month, subject to a family of four persons maximum.\n\nOf this Rs 3250, Rs 1,000 is paid by the Delhi government, whereas Rs 2,250 is paid by the Union government.\n\nThe monthly expenditure incurred for the scheme is nearly Rs 2.5 crore."
