        "text": "Women are frequently stereotyped in histories of armed conﬂict; an emphasis on their vulnerability gives them visibility mainly as the victims of violence, and does not acknowledge their agency. Though the victimization of women is a reality in any conﬂict, the one-sided emphasis on this portrays women in a severely limited way. This is true in the case of literature regarding the conﬂict in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir; women have repeatedly been represented as victims of conﬂict, but seldom recognized as political agents. As a result, women’s agency in the resistance politics of Kashmir has been historically overlooked by the majority of scholarship on the conﬂict as well as by the parties to the conﬂict. By contrast, the three books under review here provide a refreshing and even-handed assessment of Kashmiri women’s multifaceted roles in resistance politics, collectively arguing that women in Kashmir have not been merely accidental victims of violence, but have historically resisted the Indian occupation in a range of diﬀerent ways. It is precisely in this respect that the books are a valuable addition to the existing literature on the history of conﬂict in this region, as together they show both the depth and breadth of women’s contributions to the cause of azadi (the demand for the right to self-determination).\n\nKashmir is riven by a conflict that dates back to India's and Pakistan's independence. The promise made to the people of Kashmir by the Indian government at the time of annexation has yet to be fulfilled. The war has been prolonged by the uncertainty about the future, to the point that ordinary Kashmiris have lost faith in the Indian state and its democratic ideals. As a result, insurgency and counterinsurgency have emerged as forms of violence. In this war, the women of Kashmir have been on the receiving end. They are the conflict's deadliest victims. Nonetheless, they have shown their tenacity and carved out a place for themselves. They have adapted to the changing conditions by balancing their duties as a mother, wife, daughter, and activist. The study attempts to comprehend how Kashmiri women have adapted to the war. What are the Kashmiri women's organisations that have been engaged in the Kashmir struggle since 1989?\n\nThis paper aims to interpret construction of the self and struggles of nationhood of some Muslim women in Kashmir's resistance movement against Indian control , focusing on the phase of the armed struggle in the 1980s. It argues that they have been continually refashioning their notions of self and notions of just and free political community, and have cast themselves in religious -cultural terms to suit the needs of the movement. Muslim women with an active role in the armed struggle underwent a process of self-constitution in the processes of engagement with their immediate social and political context. There are women with a Muslim identity, who may or may not be practising Muslims when they intervene in political action. Yet, they were invariably cast in religious -cultural terms, forgetting that they have challenged both the Indian state and its patriarchy of militarism, alongside that within their own community.\n\n'What serious scholar of Kashmir could deny the simultaneous existence of human rights abuses and a political problem that needs a political resolution which must involve the Kashmiris themselves? Yet, even something as basic as this is hard to find being reflected in the Indian mainstream media, through which most Indians form their opinions on Kashmir. We urge the readers of this review issue to move beyond the comfort zone of merely acknowledging the vulnerabilities of the marginalised Kashmiris, by equalising the illicitness of the military and the militants, by thinking past the self-serv- ing machinations of the Indian power brokers at the centre and Kashmiri mainstream politicians at the periphery, and by asking the difficult question: How long must ordinary Kashmiris suffer their traumatic history as endless memory before their calls for freedom and justice are taken seriously enough to warrant a political resolution? The Kashmiri women herein speak of myriad things: of spectacles and street protests; women’s companionships and female alliances; women’s movements and imaginaries of resistance; the links between militarisation, militarism, and the creation of impunity by the law; competing patriarchies and sexual violence as they seek to break Kashmiri communities; the infrastructures of control that limit their mobilities, bodies, and experiences; public grief at funerals as a challenge to Indian sovereignty over Kashmir; and autobiographies, oral histories, and the textures of political memories. In the powerful idiom of postcolonial criticality, the ques- tion we should ask is not “Can the Kashmiri women speak?” but rather “Can you hear them?”' [We would like to thank the guest editors Nitasha Kaul and Ather Zia, and the members of the editorial advisory group of the Review of Women's Studies Mary E John, J Devika, Kalpana Kannabiran, Samita Sen, and Padmini Swaminathan for putting together this issue on \" Women and Kashmir.\"]\n\nThe Life of a Kashmiri Woman: Dialectic of Resistance and Accommodation Nyla Ali Khan New York: Palgrave Pivot, 2014, 137 pp. Reviewed by Ather Zia The biography under review can also be categorized as a memoir authored by Nyla Ali Khan, who is a Kashmiri-American academic. Khan is the granddaughter of Begum Akbar Jehan—the subject of this book—and her husband Shiekh Mohammad Abdullah. Shiekh was the founder of the National Conference party and the first Muslim Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.[1] Jehan is well known as a political activist, especially for playing a pivotal role in Shiekh’s political missions that ranged from Quit Kashmir movement to plebiscite and finally succumbing to India’s hegemony in Kashmir. Shiekh’s increasing acquiescence with Indian policies cost him the carte blanche that the Kashmiri masses had granted him. Since his death in 1982, the public discourse around his legacy has become deeply hostile. From 1948 till the early seventies, Shiekh was seen as an unrelenting figure of Kashmiri nationalism. The Indian government ousted him from power in 1953, after which he was incarcerated multiple times. The political travails of Shiekh’s life thrust Jehan into the center-stage and forced her to singlehandedly carry forward their political mission and domestic duties.\n\nKashmir predicament is not merely the problem of men but women are more pretentious as compared to men. The Kashmir crisis started after the British withdrew from the Indian subcontinent in 1947, but real chaos started from 1989 onwards. This paper will analyze the varied atrocities and assorted extent of violence committed against women from 1989 to 2011. Violence against women (VAW) was not acknowledged as a human rights violation by the domestic and international community for a number of years. It was first addressed at the United Nations Nairobi conference in 1985. Women have been subjugated in Kashmir from last two decades by Security forces. Hundreds of victims were raped, tortured and murdered in reprisal attacks. Violence against women in valley exists in various forms. They are often beaten, mutilated, burned, sexually abused and raped. Such violence is a major obstacle in achieving peace and harmony in the state.\n\nFor the last 16 years Kashmir has been embroiled in a fulminating manifestation of a turmoil that has been simmering since 1947. The issue is protracted and violent, which has taken a massive toll on human lives. Women amidst the mayhem have been equal recipients in the suffering. While on one hand women have become more visible in a deeply patriarchal society, on the other, they have rarely been the pivot of a sustained and constructive documentation and discussion in media or academia. There have been disparate attempts towards studying the multidimensional issues of victim hood and empowerment, forced and catalyzed by the prevailing circumstances; however the overall picture of their emergence has been elusive. It is important to make efforts towards garnering a consolidated view about the emergence of Kashmiri women, their unique history, and the travails and tribulations faced by the them and the resilience with which they not only sustain but also improve their lot. It is also important that the situation of women in Kashmir should not be presented in a vacuum, but needs to be viewed in context of the dismal political violence that engulfs the valley. The shaping of the lives of Kashmiri women, for good or bad, is deeply rooted with Kashmir polity and is a reflection of the society at large."
