        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn forensic investigations, massively parallel sequencing (MPS) with the ability to genotype multiple markers in various biological samples in a single assay with small DNA amount, delivers the potential to enhance human identification and forensic intelligence gathering. It also provides benefits in a number of areas such as admixture analysis, solving complex paternal/maternal cases. leading to an increase in the performance and cost/time-effectiveness of sensitive legal cases [1]. Identification of a person and relatedness between individuals are two of the leading matters in forensic analysis.\n\nThe potential of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be utilized as genetic markers has made them enormously popular especially in the field of forensic DNA analysis because of various qualities they possess such as automation ability, small fragment length and frequency in the genome [2]. SNPs are more stable genetic markers in most of the sensitive situations such as ancestry cases like inheritance/kinship, provides investigative lead value in cases having no genetic profile match in DNA databases or with no suspect, and in family reconstructions in case of missing individuals and unknown human remains (where the DNA is significantly fragmented). This is because of the fact that they have comparatively low mutation rates [3]. SNP variation in pigmentation genes can also be useful for inferring visible phenotypic traits for example hair, skin and eye colour [4].\n\nFor forensic identification purposes targeted enrichment combined with massively parallel sequencing has been explored recently which targets mtDNA and nuclear SNPs [5, 6]. Commercial MPS panels using standard PCR-based target enrichment have been developed to genotype many forensically relevant markers [7–9]. Hybridisation enrichment, an alternative approach to PCR-based target enrichment prior to sequencing, uses biotinylated probes (complementary to target regions in a DNA sample) to bind to target DNA and has proven successful on modern as well as degraded and ancient DNA [10]. This strategy can enrich for SNP loci prior to sequencing without the need for an initial PCR. Streptavidin beads magnetize to probes bound to target DNA, while unbound DNA and impurities are eliminated through a series of stringency washes. Hybridization enrichment can eliminate some issues with PCR-based approaches, particularly for primer design, and as a result much shorter fragment lengths of DNA can be captured without the need for intact PCR primer binding sites [11]. There is no requirement for complex PCR primer multiplex design for large numbers of markers and thus no limit on how many loci can be examined in a single assay [12].\n\nThe aim of the present study is to explore the implementation of emerging target enrichment and massively parallel sequencing technologies to genotype forensically relevant SNPs in samples from different ethnic populations of Pakistan. We used a customized 124-SNP forensic intelligence panel that offered a combined suite of phenotype, biogeographic ancestry and Y-chromosome (Y-chr) SNPs for comprehensive biological profiling.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHuman identification is a complex process that is important for social and legal reasons. In forensic investigations, MPS can enhance the potential of human identification and help resolve mixture complexities [1]. For SNP typing of samples in forensic investigations, there are many recent MPS approaches that show promise for generating information for multiple markers in a single process [8, 9]. The latest hybridisation enrichment strategies for MPS analysis of DNA samples have enhanced opportunities to obtain volumes of genetic data for forensic intelligence and identification purposes [5, 6, 39].\n\nPredicting physical characteristics from DNA as a biological source termed as forensic DNA phenotyping has gained popularity within forensics due to the potential intelligence information it can provide [40, 41]. This facilitates sensitive investigations in which conventional DNA profiling fails or does not provides useful outcomes. There are already developed and forensically authenticated systems consisting of specific markers designated for specific tasks. One example is the IrisPlex system which is a dedicated DNA test for eye colour prediction [42]. Likewise, HIrisPlex as used in the present study combines the SNPs for both eye and hair colour prediction in its system [43]. We analysed samples from different ethnic groups of Pakistan to represent different hair and eye colours. It has been investigated this way that the inclusion of the phenotype SNPs with the ancestry and Y-chr SNPs using a hybridisation enrichment technology gives results that are consistent with known phenotype. Brown and blue eye colours were predicted accurately in all cases in research by [4], however intermediate eye colours remained problematic to predict, giving an overall 83% prediction accuracy of the SNPs to infer eye colour. Interestingly, when excluding the intermediate eye colour category (sometimes explored due to the potential inaccuracies in predicting intermediate eye colour against observed eye colour) [4], the prediction accuracy increases to 92% when grouping individuals into ‘brown’ and ‘not brown’ eye colour categories. Given that pigmentation in eye colour is a complex trait which can be subjective to report [44], and that intermediate eye colour has demonstrated a lower prediction accuracy than other eye colours in previous studies [4, 45, 46], this result is not unexpected. For samples in the present study, a 100% prediction accuracy was achieved across the twenty- eight samples for hair colour. Predictions were consistent with reported hair colour for all samples, using the combined highest p-value approach and step-wise model incorporating probability thresholds for light or dark shade. Eye colour predicted accurately for all of the samples based on the highest p-value except R7 and PT32 for which eye colour predicted as blue instead of brown (actual eye colour) giving prediction accuracy of 92.8%. Again, previous studies have documented inaccuracies with predicting hair colour phenotypes (down to a 73% prediction accuracy on average), particularly with blond and brown categories [4, 46]. For both hair and eye colour, the prediction accuracy shown in this study is consistent with previous error rates established in earlier studies of the HIrisPlex SNP panel [4, 43]. Since the design and execution of the panel used in the present research, a latest HIrisPlex panel has been published, called HIrisPlex-S assay which includes additional 17 SNP markers in pigmentation genes which provides additional facilitation of inferring skin colour [47, 48]. As a further consideration, these SNPs could easily be incorporated in to the customized enrichment panel as per needs which can serve as a further intelligence tool. Nonetheless, this study has demonstrated the successful use of the HIrisPlex panel in a hybridisation enrichment approach for forensic analysis and may help to further support ancestry estimations when used in conjunction with the ancestry informative SNPs in the custom panel. Currently, the HIrisPlex model includes test data only from European populations [4]. Understanding how different populations may influence the prediction model and therefore the success rate could be improved by including reference samples from multiple non-European populations as from present study.\n\nAll 67 biogeographic-ancestry SNPs were successfully retrieved from all twenty-eight samples under study. Comparative study for the target sample’s SNP genotype data versus available reference population data showed that all likelihood ratios were at least 1 billion times more likely one population over any of the other four populations, with the exception of samples K3 and P12. Use of some additional SNPs especially enlightening for pairwise differentiation of east and south Asia’s populations will boost the ability of the panel to differentiate between these populations. Moreover, the reference dataset used for comparison included 89 individuals from EAS population which were JPT: Japanese in Tokyo, hence it is the only representation for EAS group. Inclusion of population genotype data from various countries and ethnic groups of Asia especially Pakistan and neighbouring countries for representation of east and south Asian population groups in the reference dataset could improve final predicted results and clearer biogeography-ancestry estimation. Snipper has also limitation in accurately accounting for admixture, hence it can be concluded that samples under study showed an admixture between EAS and EUR ancestry.\n\nResearch has been dedicated for many years on the human Y- chromosome and its variation analysis especially targeting YSNPs. This effort resulted in establishing a well-defined Y chromosome phylogeny. The rise of MPS approaches in recent times is facilitating the discovery of new YSNPs which are in turn increasing resolution to discriminate between closely related Y-haplotypes. The Y-chromosome being haploid and largely non-recombining in nature, is widely used as a marker in many disciplines including forensics research [49, 50], exploring structure of Y chromosome [51], and population based studies [52, 53]. The Y-SNPs in the custom enrichment panel were able to predict Y-chr haplogroups for all male samples with no conflicting haplogroup classifications. No Y-chr SNP data was recovered from any of the female samples, which also indicates the capability for this method as an indication of sex. For all twenty-one male samples under study, haplogroup classifications and their associated most likely geographic affiliations were reconciled with reported self-declared ancestry. Self-declared ancestry and region of samples under study have been affiliated well with inferred one i.e. Asian as all samples belong to local ethnic populations of Pakistan. The panel has successfully determined informative Y-chr haplogroups and sub-haplogroups and can be considered a suitable tool for exploring the paternal lineage of male samples.\n\nWhole genome sequencing is the only method that allows the simultaneous detection of all types of variations within a genome. In a single assay, a wide range of applications can be examined with the downstream analysis providing information about targets that need close examination. But as reads with bad quality were dropped prior to analysis, and whole genome approach yields less coverage in comparison to targeted approach which sequence only loci of interests. Targeted approach identifies those variants that get skipped as a result of whole genome sequencing [54]. It eliminates redundant and unnecessary genetic variations that can lead to distraction from direct interpretation. It is cost and time effective option, especially when a large number of target samples are under study like present research [54]."
