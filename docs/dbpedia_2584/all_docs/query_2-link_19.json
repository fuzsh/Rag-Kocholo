        "text": "Shoaib Mansoor has done a great job again by producing the movie \"Bol\". I found this movie much better then his previous production \"Khada Kay Liye\".\n\nI will rate this movie with 4 starts and The Best Movie In Pakistan Film History.\n\nThis movie has very strong and sensitive story/plot. I don't want to give much detail about the movie, but will recommend that you don't see this movie with your elders such as parents. This movie has several sensitives issues and you may not get comfortable listing/watching those issue with your parents.\n\nFor those who enjoy Bollywood Masala movie, you may get disappointed as this move is more an ART movie then a commercial movie. Yeh, you will see Atif Aslam with his guitar and he has played his role very well, but this movie is not about music, dances or any other related glamor activity. This movie is to open eyes about common social issues.\n\nIn my opinion, this movie should go for an Oscar award and it deserve it.\n\nThe main character of this movie is Manzar Sehbai (Played Hakim Sahib/father) and he has done an awesome job. The movie's plot/story goes around him and he has done an excellent job showing the \"true man\" of the what so called \"Indo Pak Society\". You will find many of them around our society.\n\nThe other strong character of this movie is Shafqat Cheema. He has played his role very strong and very close to reality. I found Humaima Malick, Iman Ali and Mahira Khan have done a great job as well. After searching on the web, I noticed that one song showing Iman Ali was not part of the movie when I saw it in the theater. And I think movie is good without it.\n\nAmr Kashmiri .. I salute you for accepting such challenging role and doing a great job performing it. Not many will have courage to do what you have done to show the dark side of the society. Bravo!!!! .. Kudo!!! May Allah bless you\n\nYou may or may not agree with the story of this movie. This movie has dark side of the society and not many people want to talk about these social issues. The movie is currently playing in following theaters in Chicago area and you may buy a DVD from Eros Entertainment.\n\nBIG Golf Glen 59180 W. Golf Road – Niles, IL 60714\n\nAMC South Barrington 30170 Studio Drive – South Barrington, IL 60010\n\n2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.\n\nPermalink"
