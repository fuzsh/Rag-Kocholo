This study tests whether these functionally validated variants confer susceptibility towards heroin addiction in a Pakistani population. A total of 540 heroin addicts and 467 healthy controls were genotyped, basic allele and genotype tests were performed. Neither rs1076560 nor rs2283265 significantly associated with heroin addiction. The enhancer rs12364283 occurs more frequently in heroin-dependent cases than controls (MAF 13% versus 7%, respectively), revealing significant association with heroin addiction (p=3.0E-06, OR 2.1). This study identifies rs12364283 of DRD2 as a potential risk factor for heroin addiction in the Pakistani study population. This enhancer variant had previously been shown to increase DRD2 mRNA expression (Zhang et al. 2007), a possible factor in increased vulnerability to heroin addiction. Further studies are needed to validate this association of rs12364283.\n\nKeywords: Addiction, DRD2, Enhancer Variant, Genetics, Opioids\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nClinically, opioid drug addiction is a heterogeneous disorder with highest heritability for heroin dependence compared to other drugs of abuse (Tsuang et al., 1996, Tsuang et al., 1998). To gain further insight into possible causes, diagnosis, treatment and primary prevention of heroin addiction, knowledge of the key genetic factors is essential (Tsuang et al., 1996, Tsuang et al., 1998). Clinical benefits of opioid analgesics are limited by substantial individual variation in response, a high rate (up to 66%) of adverse events, and addiction liability. Family based linkage studies and association studies have identified a number of genetic variants associated with heroin addiction or combined drug addiction (Xu et al., 2004, Kreek et al., 2005).\n\nGenetic variants in dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2 11q23.2) play a key role in signaling pathways linked to neuroadaptive changes, and are therefore prime candidates for genetic studies (Levran et al., 2008). GWAS results have implicated various DRD2 variants in multiple psychiatric disorders (Kaalund et al., 2014); however, the identified SNPs may not directly represent causative variants. A previous study had identified two intronic variants affecting mRNA splicing, rs1076560 and rs2283265, leading to altered expression of the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor (Zhang et al., 2007), later shown also to affect cocaine abuse related deaths (Moyer et al., 2011) and numerous other traits. In addition, an enhancer variant in DRD2, rs12364283 (A>G), located 844bp upstream of the transcription start site has been shown to affect the expression of DRD2 mRNA in the brain. The minor G allele (gain-of-function, penetrant allele) of rs12364283 SNP is associated with enhanced DRD2 expression compared to the major A allele (Zhang et al., 2007). Enhancer variants are reported to affect transcription and thereby potential susceptibility to common diseases (Corradin and Scacheri, 2014). rs12364283 has been found associated with behavioral responses like impulsivity, inhibition (Hamidovic et al., 2009) and avoidance in decision making (Frank and Hutchison., 2009). However, rs12364283 has been less well studied, possibly owing to its lower allele frequency (MAF ~5%) than the splicing variants.\n\nBecause disease associated genetic variants may differ in frequency and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns among different populations, functional variants may have different impact in different ethnic groups (Lohmueller et al., 2006). Drawing on previous molecular genetics studies, the present case-control association study was designed to assess the frequency of rs1076560, rs2283265, and rs12364283 DRD2 variants and their potential effect on risk of heroin addiction in Pakistanis. The Pakistani population cohort lacks prior studies on genetic susceptibility to heroin addiction, with unknown genotype distributions in the DRD2 candidate gene.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nHeroin addicts (positive for opioid urine test and being on daily multiple uses of heroin for at least a year) were recruited from drug rehabilitation centers/clinics located in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, and Peshawar Pakistan. The exclusion criterion followed for controls was: a) one or more instances of drinking to intoxication, or any illicit drug use, in preceding 30 days. b) Past history of alcohol drinking to intoxication, or illicit drug use, more than twice a week and six consecutive months. c) Cannabis use for more than 12 days in prior 30 days or past use for more than twice a week for more than 4 years (Levran et al., 2008). However healthy controls included in this study had no history of drug abuse or mental disorder.\n\nAll subjects completed a detailed questionnaire while ethnicity was self-reported (Punjabi/Pashtuns/Kashmiris). The study had been approved by the Ethics Committee for the use of human subjects, Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi, Pakistan. An informed consent was obtained from all study subjects before sampling.\n\nVenous blood (5 ml) was collected in EDTA vacutainers, and DNA extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform protocol of (Sambrook et al., 1982). A total of 1007 male subjects included in the study were genotyped for the DRD2 intronic variants rs1076560 and rs2283265, and a less frequent enhancer variant, rs12364283. Genotyping for rs1076560 and rs2283265 SNPs of DRD2 was performed by PCR-RFLP using a DNA Analyzer 3730 (Applied Biosystems (ABI, Life Technologies). For RFLPs, a 100–300 base pair region surrounding each SNP was amplified via PCR using one fluorescently labeled primer and one unlabeled primer (Zhang et al., 2007). The resulting amplicons were digested overnight with a restriction endonuclease that selectively distinguishes between the fluorescently labeled fragments of two alleles. obtained from these methods were analyzed on AB 3730 capillary electrophoresis instrument (Papp et al., 2003). A modified allele-specific PCR method (Papp et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2007) was used for genotyping of rs12364283 A>G variant of DRD2. The minor allele primer was tagged with a GC tail for better resolution of melting curves on a ABI PRISM® (7000 Sequence Detection System) instrument:\n\nForward: wt F, 5’_AAgTGTCCTCAGTTTGCgAGA_3’\n\nGC-tagged forward: gcF, 5’_GCCCGGCGCGCGCCCTGTCCTCAGTTTGCCTGG_3’\n\nReverse: 5’_CAGCACCTGTTTAAGCCTCAGT_3’\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe allelic and genotypic distribution both in cases and controls were calculated. Genotypes were checked for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Both basic allele tests (with additive, dominant and recessive allele models) and a genotype test were performed and association with heroin dependence was determined using χ2 test. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) among three studied DRD2 SNPs was calculated and presented as D´ and r2. The Helix Tree (Golden Helix) (50) software package was used for statistical analysis.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA comparison of the MAFs of all studied SNPs in major world populations and Pakistani population is given in the showing that the local Pakistani population shares similar allele frequencies as reported for SAS populations. The MAF of DRD2 enhancer variant rs12364283 in the controls (0.07) was in the similar range for EUR population (0.08) but was lower compared to total SAS population (0.12). rs12364283 had a higher MAF (0.13) in cases as compared to controls.\n\nTable 1.\n\nSNP IDSNP\n\nLocation\n\non GeneAlleles\n\nMajor/\n\nMinorGlobal PopulationsCurrent Study PopulationEAS\n\n(n=1008)EUR\n\n(n=1006)AFR\n\n(n=1322)AMR\n\n(n=694)SAS\n\n(n=978)Controls\n\n(n=467)Cases\n\n(n=540)Total\n\nPopulation\n\n(n=1007)rs1076560Intron 6C/A0.420.150.080.270.290.240.210.22rs2283265Intron 5G/T0.410.150.080.270.290.230.240.23rs123642835’UpA/G0.0040.080.010.040.120.070.130.10\n\nSince study subjects belong to different ethnic groups, MAFs among Punjabis, Pashtuns, and Kashmiris are listed separately in . There are some notable differences in the MAF among ethnic groups, in particular, DRD2 rs12364283 differed between Punjabis (mean MAF 0.07), Pashtuns (0.06), and Kashmiris (0.13) with the highest MAF. As in the full study population, the enhancer SNP rs12364283 also displayed significantly higher MAF in each of the three ethnic groups; Punjabis (0.13 in cases, 0.07 in controls), Pashtuns (0.16 in cases, 0.06 in controls), and Kashmiris (0.18 in cases, 0.13 in controls) ( ). The MAFs of the other two DRD2 SNPs, rs1076560 and rs2283265, also differed between Punjabis, Pashtuns and Kashmiris (0.26, 0.15, 0.15 and 0.26, 0.16, 0.19 respectively). Allele frequencies estimated for Kashmiris were calculated from a small population, and therefore, may not fully represent MAF for this sub-population. Therefore, we analyzed association with heroin dependence for the entire cohort combined, even while MAF values differed between the ethnic groups.\n\nTable 2.\n\nMarkersMinor Allele Frequencies within Ethnic GroupsPunjabis (n=678)Pashtuns (n=194)Kashmiris (n=61)MAF\n\nTotalCases\n\n(n=334)Controls\n\n(n=344)MAF\n\nTotalCases\n\n(n=141)Controls\n\n(n=53)MAF\n\nTotalCases\n\n(n=33)Controls\n\n(n=28)rs10765600.230.210.260.170.180.150.200.260.15rs22832650.240.230.260.170.180.160.240.300.19rs123642830.090.130.070.120.160.060.150.180.13\n\nThe association for all DRD2 polymorphisms with heroin addiction are presented in , along with genotype data. Only the enhancer SNP rs12364283 displayed significantly higher minor allele frequency (0.13) in cases as compared to controls (0.07), (p=3.0E-6). Moreover the homozygous minor allele carriers are four times more frequent in cases than controls for rs12364283 (20 vs 4). The basic allele test gave the lowest p value (p= 3.0E-06, OR=2.1 with 95% CI=1.5–2.9) showing significant association of the minor allele of rs12364283 with increasing risk of heroin dependence. The genotypes were in HWE for the control group (p=0.17), but deviated significantly in the cases (p=2.9e-5), consistent with the enrichment of the minor allele in the cases. While associations of neither rs1076560 nor rs2283265 were significant with heroin addiction (p=0.16, OR=0.86 with 95% C.I=0.69–1.06; and p=0.46, OR=0.92 with 95% C.I=0.75–1.14, respectively). The genotypes of both SNPs, were in HWE for the control group (p=0.189 for both SNPs) and for the cases (p=0.25 and p=0.118). The LD scores for all three variants are presented in . Per results rs1076560 and rs2283265 are in tight LD between them (D´=0.947) while rs12364283 is in low LD with both SNPs (rs1076560 D´=0.059 and rs2283265 D´=0.02).\n\nTable 3:\n\nGenotypesBasic Allele Test and Genotype Test p-valueMarkersPopulationDDDdddBasic\n\nAllele Test\n\np-valueBasic\n\nAllele Test\n\nCorrected\n\np-valueGenotype\n\nTest\n\np-valueGenotype\n\nTest\n\nCorrected\n\np-valueOR (95% CI)rs1076560Cases321161270.160.480.080.240.86 (0.69–1.06)Controls25117020rs2283265Cases321171330.461.000.100.300.92 (0.75–1.14)Controls24516820rs12364283Cases38695202.96E-068.89E-067.23E-050.00022.1 (1.5–2.9)Controls390544\n\nTable 4.\n\nrs_numberrs1076560rs2283265rs12364283rs10765601.0/1.01.0/0.9470.059/0rs22832651.0/0.9471.0/1.00.02/0rs123642830.059/00.02/01.0/1.0\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study is the first conducted in a Pakistani cohort consisting of heroin addicts and a normal control group. The initial focus was to compare allele frequencies in opioid addiction candidate genes between ethnicities across the world and the Pakistani population. A primary goal of the study was to identify candidate variants that contribute to heroin addiction vulnerability in the Pakistani population. Previous evidence has linked anomalous subcortical dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) signaling with drug addiction and other central nervous system disorders (Seeman, 2006). Our results implicate an enhancer SNP in DRD2, rs12364283, 844bp upstream of the transcription start site.\n\nThe DRD2 rs12364283 variant had been shown to cause increased mRNA expression (Zhang et al., 2007), but because of lower MAF than other DRD2 variants, its clinical associations with opioid addiction has yet to be studied. Owing to a higher MAF in study cohort (heroin addicts as total and ethnically separated), and a sufficient number of subjects, our study provided an opportunity to test its effect on heroin addiction. Indeed, rs12364283 is significantly associated with heroin dependence in the studied Pakistani population, with an approximately twofold odds ratio (OR 2.1, CI 1.5–2.9). This result must be replicated before the potential significance of rs12364283 in opioid addiction is confirmed. In support of a functional role of rs12364283, a study on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a pathologic response to severe stress and a common co-morbid disorder in drug use disorders, revealed an association between rs12364283 and pathophysiology of PTSD in amphetamine-dependent individuals (Nelson et al., 2014). Also, DRD2 variants have been implicated in risk of opiate addiction, affecting the need for methadone substitution therapy and methadone dosage requirements (Doehring et al., 2009). In that study cohort, the minor rs12364283 allele was present with nearly twice the frequency in cases compared to control (10.1% versus 4.6%; OR 2.3 (1.0–5.3) (Doehring et al., 2009), similar to our findings, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Bonferroni corrected) owing to a small number of subjects. Nevertheless, this result provides a first replication of the result reported here.\n\nPreviously, two intronic SNPs, rs2283265 and rs1076560, had been identified in high LD with each other (Zhang et al., 2007) which affect DRD2 splicing and memory processing, as well as an association with risk of death as a result of cocaine abuse (Moyer et al., 2011). However, both of these SNPs failed to show significant association with risk of heroin addiction; moreover, a haplotype analysis indicates that rs12364283 alone largely accounts for the association (data not shown). rs12364283 had been shown to increase DRD2 expression (Zhang et al., 2007). A confounding factor, ethnic admixture in cases and controls could have affected the results, but similar trends are observed in each sub-population. The rs12364283 DRD2 enhancer SNP may increase vulnerability to heroin addiction and should be considered in future association studies involving disorders characterized by dopaminergic dysfunction.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe are thankful to drug rehabilitation centers and hospitals, support and advice from members of the College of Medicine Center for Pharmacogenomics (Audrey Papp, Leslie Newman, Roshan Mascarenhas, Danxin Wang and Ryan Smith), The Ohio State University, USA.\n\nFunding was provided by Indigenous Scholarship [106–1960-BM6–056], Higher Education Commission, Pakistan and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grant U01 GM092655.\n\nFootnotes\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author.
