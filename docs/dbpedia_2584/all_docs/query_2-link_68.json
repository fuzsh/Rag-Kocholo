        "text": "Crisis India-Pakistan:\n\nAchtergrondinformatie, analyse en nieuws\n\nuit de Indiase, Pakistaanse en internationale media.\n\nindex The News International, October 15, 2005\n\nQuaking ourselves out of apathy\n\nPraful Bidwai\n\nThe colossal destruction and heart-rending human misery wrought by the Muzaffarabad earthquake has suddenly focused a beam of bright white light on a stark, simple truth, which many South Asians have suppressed, trivialised or forgotten: namely, the India-Pakistan border is basically political. In sharp contrast to the rifts and divisions the border represents stands the lived experience of flesh-and-blood people affected by the disaster, itself rooted in their common humanity and shared grief. Even the geological processes that led to the earthquake cut across borders.\n\nYou don't need a map of the subcontinent to realise that the Line of Control is an obstruction, a profound irrationality. The easiest access to some parts of Pakistani Kashmir lies through Indian terrain across the LoC. If rescuing people and providing relief has any meaning -- and what else matters at this point of time? -- the border has none.\n\nIt's a sad irony that Indian soldiers crossed the LoC not to provide desperately needed relief to civilians, but to reconstruct a Pakistani military bunker!\n\nWe citizens, therefore, have every right to be infuriated at the cussedness and bloody mindedness of our rulers, who still cannot rise above the pettiest considerations of prestige, protocol and precedent, nor spontaneously assert a simple urge to relieve human suffering.\n\nPakistan has refused India's offer to conduct joint relief operations. It won't welcome Indian workers' teams crossing the border. It has only accepted 25 tonnes of material and even spurned the offer of light helicopters, which it badly needs. What else is this but a move to block direct human contact between the two peoples at a time when it can make a life-or-death difference?\n\nIt's ludicrous to imagine that accepting substantial relief from India, in particular through joint disaster management efforts, would be a sign of \"weakness\". But that's the sole, perverse, rationale of the \"sensitivities\" that President Pervez Musharraf cited while saying \"thanks, but no thanks\" to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. At work here is a fraudulent notion of national security and power projection.\n\nIndia, in turn, has refused to share seismic data with Pakistan because it fears it might be used to pinpoint the location of any future nuclear experiments (full-fledged blasts or hydronuclear tests) it might conduct. This fear is compounded by India's opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, under which seismic verification has been agreed. Thus India hasn't joined the Global Seismographic Network maintained by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), Washington, a consortium created by universities which accurately monitors earthquakes at 128 stations worldwide.\n\nSo the shadow of the mushroom cloud looms over India's decision not to cooperate with Pakistan even through IRIS. This is as self-defeating for India as Islamabad's refusal of relief teams is for Pakistan. Joining IRIS would give India real-time access to seismic data and help substantially cut the response-time to earthquakes. This could save lives.\n\nOur wretchedly callous governments won't willingly shed their profound antipathy to their own people or their Neanderthal-like militaristic instincts. Not anytime soon. But that doesn't mean that civil society organisations (CSOs) should be passive and not push them. They must do their utmost to establish people-to-people contacts across the border using all available means.\n\nIt's the CSOs' duty to reach out -- not only because government-level efforts have proved unacceptably inadequate. The Kashmiris, in whose name we all speak, have themselves called for such initiatives. Hurriyat chairman Umar Farooq has said so explicitly while decrying the relative inactivity of major NGOs in the present case -- in contrast to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake or last December's tsunami.\n\nIndia's CSOs have a much longer and richer experience of dealing with disaster relief thanks to the Uttarkashi and Chamoli earthquakes in the Himalayas (1991 and 1999), the Latur tremblor in Maharashtra's plains (1993), besides Bhuj. They have invaluable insights into what's needed -- not just in terms of food, water and materials, but the way their distribution should be organised involving local communities. They have worked for years on building temporary shelters as well as permanent structures which can resist earthquakes.\n\nThe mountainous areas affected in Pakistan, especially Azad Kashmir, are very similar to those in India's Himalayan hill districts in topography, access, quality and structure of housing. Disasters in the hills pose different problems from those in the plains. Here too, the Indian CSOs' expertise could prove useful -- in restoring ruptured communication links, or in quickly erecting temporary shelters to protect people from the cold and the rain.\n\nI have been talking to many CSOs, earthquake engineers, architects and other experts in Delhi, Dehra Dun and Mumbai. They draw the following lessons from their experience.\n\nThe success of relief efforts depends not just on the timely provision of materials, but on involving local people, so they \"own\" and participate in the process. Or else, they see it as someone else's problem and won't contribute to improving the process to suit local conditions.\n\nWomen have a critical role to play because they are far more acutely aware than men of domestic needs, the space and attention required by children and old people, and cooking and cleaning facilities, etc. \"Natural\" disasters unite people and temporarily obfuscate gender-role hierarchies, allowing women to play a more proactive public role than would be normally allowed.\n\nIn the best shelter programmes, people are taught to build sheds or barracks with simple implements and local materials such as tin sheets, which they can adapt to suit their needs. It's pointless to throw Western equipment at them, or dump blankets and tents.\n\nAs important as material aid are community and social ties, communication networks, and governance structures like village panchayats or local bodies. Efficient communication is vital in rescuing people. A panchayat run democratically and transparently will provide relief more effectively than bureaucratic structures, even when led by well-meaning babus.\n\nPublic-spirited doctors should be involved in medical, including psychiatric, relief programmes from the start. It's possible to procure essential medicines at subsidised prices. That's a secondary problem. Familiarity with community and social medicine is more important than sophisticated techniques in medical relief.\n\nThis may sound easy. In practice, it isn't. Nothing can facilitate it as much as ground-level cooperation, where people rub shoulders with one another.\n\nSo, Pakistani CSOs and well-meaning citizens should do something simple: get in touch with their Indian counterparts. Equally, Indian CSOs, especially in Uri and Tangdher, should ask Pakistani physicians and CSOs for help. At this point, let me do something Columnists don't usually do.

Unless its people, CSOs and NGOs seize the initiative, the victims of this tragedy won't get relief, leave alone rehabilitation.\n\nFinally, to quote someone from Islamabad cited in any number of emails doing the India-Pakistan rounds: \"The rescue efforts are pathetic -- people trying to get into the collapsed mountain of concrete using picks and shovels. It shows how unprepared the society is for any ...disaster. And yet the fools talk of surviving nuclear war\".\n\nWill we learn? We must. And we must not give in.\n\nThe writer, a former newspaper editor, is a researcher and peace and human-rights activist based in Delhi\n\nindex Indepent Online, October 15, 2005\n\nwww.iol.co.za\n\nIndia in pursuit of Denel money trail\n\nBy Michael Schmidt\n\nNew Delhi is probing whether part of the $393 720 (R2,6-million at Saturday's conversion rate) paid to a British agency by arms firm Denel as part of its successful anti-matériel rifle (AMR) deal with India was \"round-tripped\" back into the pockets of a trio of Denel executives.\n\nAsh Kirpal, an attorney ousted this year as head of Denel's forensic investigation unit, has claimed that Varas Associates Inc, the British Virgin Islands-based company at the heart of the corruption allegations, was a paper tiger that camouflaged Denel chiefs' practice of skimming money from over-inflated \"consultancy\" fees.\n\nBut Kirpal has no documentary proof, Denel has flatly denied any wrongdoing in the contract to sell 400 AMRs to India - and India is keen to that unfreeze its Denel deals so it can acquire sought-after South African artillery pieces, armour and avionics.\n\nSaturday Star revealed that Varas Associates had been paid millions of dollars Last Tuesday, our sister paper The Star reported that the Indian military journal SP's Land Forces \"said India had cancelled the $3,86-million AMR deal because it had failed to disclose that it had used an agent to secure the multibillion-deal\".\n\nBut the Indian Defence Ministry said it was not true that any deals had been cancelled, merely frozen: \"The matter is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe probe is looking into the employment of middlemen in buying the AMR from Denel. We have not reached a conclusion yet.\"\n\nStill, last week the vice-chief of the Indian Army, Lieutenant-General S Pattabhiraman, admitted that the freezing of all contracts with, and pending orders to, Denel had hit the army very hard.\n\nParticularly affected was its Bhim Project, whereby it would mount Denel's world- famous 155mm artillery gun on an Indian Arjun tank chassis.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of defence industry synergy that was envisaged by the so-called G3 pact signed by India, Brazil and South Africa in 2003 as part of their strategic plan to build a powerful \"South\" bloc of nations. The G3 partners are unlikely to allow problems with the AMR deal to derail future co-operation.\n\nOn April 16, Saturday Star revealed that Varas Associates had been paid millions of dollars, allegedly in part to influence India's choice of Denel as its AMR supplier.\n\nWhen Denel landed the deal in 2003, it was hailed as a coup for the group although its AMR - known as the \"new technology weapon\" - was one of the best in the world, a long-range sniper rifle, with heavy armour-piercing incendiary shells, that is perfectly suited for use by special forces against targets such as aircraft and lightly armoured vehicles.\n\nBut signed documents from the Denel treasury in this newspaper's possession purported to show that Denel paid Varas Associates two sums on January 27 2003 ($2 408 373 and $1 099 672) and $151 350 on June 19 2003. There was no indication what the payments were for.\n\nActing Denel spokesperson Priya Pillay said that five months ago \"the Indian Ministry of Defence informed Denel of their intention to cancel the contracts\" with Denel. That threat appears to be receding.\n\nThe week after Saturday Star broke the story, both houses of the Indian parliament were adjourned early amid chaos over the arms scandal.\n\nThen, on April 20, the Indian Ministry of Defence and Defence Production froze all deals with Denel while the Central Bureau of Investigation probed the AMR deal.\n\nOn June 6, Ritu Sarin, the New Delhi-based defence correspondent of The Indian Express newspaper, said the CBI had filed a charge against Denel under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\nMarc Craigh Veitch, at that time, was a director of Varas Associates, apparently one of a group of British companies of which he was director. another was Africa Link Ltd.\n\nThe Manx registrar of companies had no listing for Varas, but said Veitch's Africa Link had been registered in January 1997 and given its business first as \"investment company\", and then, oddly, as \"farrier\" - a maker of horseshoes.\n\nVeitch and Varas Associates could not be reached for comment. The firm is believed to have since shut up shop. The Indian Express reported in June that Varas was based not on the Isle of Man, as stated on its invoices, but rather on the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.\n\nOn May 22, Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad paid a low-key visit to India, reportedly to deal with the fallout from the Saturday Star report on documents in its possession purporting to show that Varas sent Denel three bills totalling $987,530 for its \"technical services\".\n\nAmong these was a December 8 2002 invoice apparently signed by Veitch, for $393 720, being for \"fees for consulting and technical services as per agreement\" relating to the \"AM2 & AM3\" project, said by a Denel insider to be the sale of the anti-matériel rifles plus ammunition and technology transfer.\n\nFollowing a massive arms kickbacks scandal in 198-88 involving a British anti-aircraft system, a clause was inserted in all Indian defence deals stating that a company can be blacklisted and contracts cancelled if it uses middlemen.\n\nIn 2002 the Indian Ministry of Defence allowed the use of registered agents only. What is at stake is whether Varas was a registered agent - and whether it acted within the letter of the AMR deal and of the law.\n\nKirpal claimed that \"apart from the commission paid [to Varas], there is evidence that the commission was inflated to the benefit of people in Denel\".\n\nBut Kirpal admitted that his evidence was oral and that he had no documentary proof.\n\nPillay responded: \"Denel has sought legal advice in both South Africa and India throughout its business dealings in India and can confirm no laws were transgressed in the process, in either South Africa or India.\n\n\"It is also Denel's view, based on legal opinion obtained in both countries that Denel did not breach any provisions of its contracts with the Ministry of Defence, India.\n\nThe company, in co-operation with government and legal counsel, is working to determine how this very complex and sensitive issue can be resolved.\"\n\nindex Defense-Aerospace.com, October 13, 2005\n\nwww.defense-aerospace.com\n\nIndia and France Sign Contracts Worth $ 3.5 Billion for Construction of Scorpene Class Submarines For Indian Navy\n\n(Source: Indian Ministry of Defence; dated Oct. 6, web-posted Oct. 13, 2005)\n\nNEW DELHI --- India and France today signed contracts for the construction of six Scorpene class submarines in India under Project-75. The project will cost around three and a half billion dollars.\n\nAccording to the contracts, India will build the Scorpene class submarines at the state owned Mazagon Docks in Mumbai, under transfer of technology from France. The first submarine will be ready for induction into the service within seven years of signing the contract. The remaining five submarines will be delivered at intervals of one year each thereafter.\n\nThe thrust of Indian Navy's 30-year Submarine Building Plan of which Project-75 is a part, is to develop national competence in submarine building. Towards this end, the indigenous component of the machinery and equipment fitted on the Scorpene is expected to go up to 60% during the implementation of the project.\n\nThe selection of Scorpene was made after detailed techno-commercial analysis of the available options that best suited the requirements of Indian Navy. Scorpene is a state-of-the-art conventional submarine, which incorporates advanced stealth characteristics that make its detection difficult. It has a high level of automation and redundancy, which contribute towards reduction in crew strength, enhanced endurance and greater survivability. The modern sonar and electronic equipment fitted on the submarine, lends the Scorpene superior capability in detection and classification of surface and underwater targets.\n\nThe submarine packs a lethal weapon outfit with anti-ship missiles and wire-guided torpedoes. It has an integrated combat system, which effectively synergises the capabilities of its sensors and weapon systems. Apart from India, Chile and Malaysia have also contracted to acquire two Scorpene submarines each. The first submarine of the Scorpene class has already been commissioned for the Chilean Navy.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Arun Prakash said that the contracts had received repeated scrutiny at every level, by different organs of the Government and the Parliament.\n\n\"In fact we were determined that in the interest of transparency and probity we would accept as much delay as was necessary. In this context we were particularly happy that for the first time an integrity pact has been signed today between the buyer and the sellers This provision has been included in the Defence Procurement Procedures 2005 at the request of the Navy and will soon become a standard feature which will be promulgated at the time Request for Proposals (RFPs) are issued so that subsequently there are neither doubts nor apprehension in the minds of either the buyer or the seller\", Admiral Prakash said.\n\nSix different contracts, pacts and technical arrangements were signed in today's ceremony:\n\nThe technical arrangement provides unhindered supply of equipment and services for the entire duration of the programme. This was signed by Shri S Banerjee, Addl Secy, Ministry of Defence on behalf of India and Mr. Dominique Girard, the Ambassador of France on behalf of the Govt of France.\n\nThe Integrity Pact assures avoidance of all forms of corruption by ensuring free, fair, transparent and unprejudiced dealings, prior to during and subsequent to the currency of the contract. This was signed by Dr. Thomas Mathew, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Mr. Pierre Legros, Chairman, M/s ARMARIS of France for the contract between Ministry of Defence, Govt of India and M/s ARMARIS of France.\n\nAnother integrity pact was signed between Dr. Thomas Mathew, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Mr. Marwan Lahoud, CEO M/s MBDA of France for the contract between Ministry of Defence, Govt of India and M/s MBDA of France.\n\nThe contract for Transfer for Technology and design for construction of Scorpene Class submarines and supply of Combat Systems was signed by Rear Admiral RM Bhatia, Chairman and Managing Director, Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) and Mr. Pierre Legros, Chairman M/s ARMARIS.\n\nThe contract for construction of six Scorpene Class Submarines at MDL, Mumbai was signed by Rear Admiral RM Bhatia, Chairman and Managing Director, MDL and Dr. Thomas Mathew, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe contract for supply of missiles for the submarines was signed by Dr. Thomas Mathew, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Mr. Marwan Lahoud, CEO, M/s MBDA.\n\nTop officials of the Ministry of Defence including the Defence Secretary Shri Shekhar Dutta and Secretary Defence Production Shri Dhanendra Kumar were present at the ceremony.\n\nIndia constructed two Type 209 submarines of German design at Mazagon Docks Limited, Mumbai in the mid 1980s, demonstrating our ability to build hi-tech submarines. Many of the skills and technological expertise acquired in this process got dissipated in the 15-year hiatus that followed.\n\nHowever, with the signing of this contract, the Indian shipbuilding and ancillary industries will once again acquire the strategic capability to build submarines.\n\nindex The Indian Express, October 12, 2005\n\nIndia Inc rushed to Gujarat, where are they now: Mirwaiz\n\nBashaarat Masood & Muzamil Jaleel\n\nSRINAGAR, ISHAM (LOC), OCTOBER 11: As thousands wept while they prayed for the quake victims, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who led special prayers at Srinagar's Jamia Masjid today, sent the rest of India a wake-up call: \"It is sad that people have not responded to this great tragedy. This was not expected. When Latur and Bhuj were ravaged, big industrialists stepped forward to help. But no one seems to be coming to our aid.\"\n\n\"This is a national tragedy, a tragedy for Kashmiris on this side of the LoC and on the other side. This tragedy has not recognised the LoC. For the first time, we have been witness to such destruction, put to such a test. Thousands have died in Uri, Tangdhar, Muzaffarabad and Rawlakote,\" he said.\n\nAs the Mirwaiz recalled scenes of devastation and demanded immediate restoration of communication links between J&K and PoK, tears rolled down cheeks of those assembled there. Outside the Grand Mosque, people offered funeral-in-absentia for those killed in Uri, Tangdhar, Muzaffarabad and elsewhere.\n\nThe Mirwaiz called for a complete shutdown on Friday as a mark of respect for those who died. \"The coming Friday will be observed as a day of mourning. All shops and offices will remain closed and Hurriyat will start a door-to-door campaign to collect relief for victims,\" he announced.\n\nWhat the Mirwaiz said about India Inc and NGOs not doing enough in Kashmir's hour of need is being repeated by people everywhere, be it Srinagar or Uri or Tangdhar.\n\nWith the government still missing in villages along the LoC, people are also beginning to notice the absence of voluntary groups. Other than the Army, which has moved at great speed to rush relief, it has been left to hundreds of young men from across the Valley to come to the aid of the affected.\n\nYouths have been carrying sacks of rice and flour, milk powder packets, clothes, pots, water bottles and blankets for the quake survivors. Hours after the quake, young men formed village and mohalla committees to collect relief and then despatched hundreds of volunteers to the worst-hit areas. Despite torrential rains in the entire Uri region today, young men brought food and respite to the people who say they have been \"abandoned\" by the civil administration. \"We are shocked. Our own government is lying to the world that they are helping us,\" says Ali Hussain Abbassi of Isham.\n\n\"We went to Uri today to complain. We heard that the Prime Minister was visiting. He would have heard us but the police didn't let us speak to our own ministers and chased us away,\" he said.\n\nIn Dardkote, Mohammad Akbar Mir is angry with the state government. \"Do you think they don't know that nothing has reached us? There are 100 villages in Uri, almost 90 are hit. They could have sent five-six police battalions with rations. If these young volunteers can reach us, why can't the government? There wouldn't have been a single hungry person here,\" he says.\n\nSchool teacher Firouz Din Shah is shocked that voluntary groups still haven't shown up: \"Forget the Central government, we can't believe that no NGO has come. Where are the people who set up community langars when a similar tragedy hit Gujarat? Only the Nehru Yuva Kendra is in Uri. We heard that a Sikh group from Punjab has reached Srinagar. Where are the others?\"\n\nindex Deccan Herald, October 11, 2005\n\nIndo-Pak relations - No breakthrough in sight\n\nBy M.B. Naqvi\n\nIn the context of nuclear weapons, CBMs are inadequate and there can be no meaningful co-operation\n\nAssessing the progress in the ongoing Indo-Pakistan dialogue is becoming tiresome. There is nothing new. There is the usual incremental advance. Both sides are determined to soldier on to the Third Round. This determination to go on talking is strange. Is it an effort by both sides to keep the Americans happy? But that may be unfair. The stoppage of bilateral dialogue means a return to an open-ended deadlock that can occasion war, conceivably nuclear. So let them go on talking.\n\nThree reasons prevent settlement. First, Kashmir is actually insolvable. This land is linked to the honour, self-esteem and prestige of both sides. India would keep Kashmir State. Pakistan would take it. As it happens, Pakistan cannot wrest it. India is not prepared to even dilute its control. Kashmiris are now too alienated from both; left to themselves they would keep both out while expecting them to help them. But they are unable to win their right to be free. India is unable to win over the Kashmiri hearts.\n\nThe second major reason preventing settlement is the two rival nuclear deterrents sitting so close to each other. Atomic weapons are of use only to attack and that too pre-emptively. There is no defence against them. Period.\n\nAll talk of anti-missile defence boils down to slightly more accurate rockets that will ultimately be used for offensive purposes, when it is not a sales pitch for rocket manufacturers. Neither Islamabad nor New Delhi can really trust the other so long as there are nuclear-tipped rockets sitting in the other's arsenal.\n\nNeither side can so lower the guard as to allow the citizens of the other country to swarm around them. A close friendship involves lots of cooperation, trade and tourism. Spook agencies, on both sides, are conscious of the other's capabilities and are always paranoid about open borders and free travel. Inside governments the securitywallahs always win over other departments.\n\nThe Pentagon would use nukes on suspected third world countries pre-emptively. That is their only use. No other use is possible. Thus the presence of these weapons destroys trust radically. A close neighbour, possessing the ability to suddenly incinerate any city, cannot be trusted on the hoary doctrine that it is the capability that counts; intention can always change.\n\nThat basic mistrust disallows close economic, trade and cultural cooperation. It is this that does not permit either side making significant concessions. Some trust is a precondition for a cooperative dispensation to being agreed upon. Even insipid normalisation eludes.\n\nReasons for quarrelling\n\nWhy have Pakistan and India been quarrelling all along? The reason has many constituents. Emphasis on religious communities was a colonial legacy. That resulted in communal rivalry that progressively got worse; communalism was the shortest route to political success if the other community was sufficiently demonised. Muslim communalism demanded being treated as equal to Hindus for having once been dominant. They tended to be toadies to a \"central\" power to save one's privileges, mainly lands. Muslim politics was a quest for saving privileges that evolved into Muslim separatism.\n\nPakistan inherited an assumption of equality with Hindus. Meantime Hindus evolved a nationalism with Hindu ethos and another based on Indo-Persian civilisation superimposed with secularism and democratic values. Thus in Indian and Pakistani states, the colonial period's communal rivalry survived as foreign policies. Indians think they are a great power. But Pakistan's UN representative has observed: \"In the strategic and defence areas, Pakistan always demands and deserves parity with our neighbour\". This is rivalry in the context of nukes. With such mindsets can they work out a friendly settlement?\n\nFactually, not one out of eight disputes has come nearer a solution after two Rounds. Two have been dealt with, viz, Kashmir and atomic forces, and a brief mention made of the third: rival states are based originally on communal consciousnesses. Today the reality is rivalry between the two states that caused several wars and the cold war continues. Popular pressure to get out of this vicious cycle is there. Which is why the two governments do not let the dialogue die. American nudges and pushes are also responsible.\n\nIf anyone in Pakistan would listen there is a solution of Kashmir: let's stop seeking a Kashmir settlement, unless territorial aggrandisement is what motivates Islamabad. It is a matter of Kashmiris' aspirations vis-à-vis India and their rights. Well, let these two sort it out. Pakistan should loudly proclaim it has no locus standi. If Kashmiris want a different future, let them struggle and achieve it.\n\nThe second issue concerns atomic weapons. Well, there is no solution of this problem. The only solution is that both countries should simultaneously get rid of them. The bomb-loving lobbies on either side think it is not a practical proposition. Islamabad and New Delhi pretend that confidence building measures are adequate.They aren't. The CBMs look good in normal times; when tensions are high they are ignored.\n\nWork of time\n\nTime will reshape assumptions, attitudes and purpose of the two states. Their identities must rest on firm cultural and historical foundations. A people-to-people reconciliation and friendship between them, indeed among South Asians, will transform the prospect.\n\nBut a fourth issue is trying to climb up the list. It is river waters.

Muralidhar Reddy\n\nIslamabad ready to accept relief supplies from India but not for joint relief and rescue operations\n\nISLAMABAD: Even as it became clear that the death toll in Saturday's earthquake in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) could be well over 30,000, Islamabad on Monday said it would receive relief goods from India.\n\nHowever, it maintained that there was no \"possibility\" of joint relief and rescue operations with India on the plea that the Line of Control (LoC) was not inhabited.\n\nHours after Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran announced in New Delhi that a planeload of relief materials would be ready to leave for Pakistan, the new Foreign Office spokesperson, Ms. Tasneem Aslam, told The Hindu here: ``Yes. We have indicated our requirements to New Delhi and relief materials would begin coming from there from tomorrow onwards. However, I am not sure about the mode of transport.\"\n\nIt appears India offered to lend the services of a few helicopters as well as experts to help in the rescue of stranded people but Pakistan did not accept the suggestion.\n\nEarlier, Ms. Aslam told a news conference that Islamabad had offered assistance to New Delhi to help the victims on the other side of the LoC.\n\nOn the possibility of a coordinated approach by the two countries, she said the Pakistan Army was operating in villages and towns in PoK, including in far-flung areas but not along the LoC. Asked whether security concerns were involved in relief operations in PoK, Ms. Aslam said: \"I don't know. Maybe, the Indian media has reported about security concerns.\"\n\nShe said: \"We remain willing to help Indians if we are needed for any kind of assistance, like the Indians offered us.\"\n\nThe counter offer by Pakistan to India has surprised diplomatic observers here considering the magnitude of its problem.\n\nUNICEF projections\n\nOn the basis of field reports and projections, the United Nations Children's Fund has estimated that between 30,000 and 40,000 people died in Pakistan and PoK. Children accounted for 50 per cent of the population in the affected areas in northern Pakistan and PoK.\n\nThe UNICEF projections were corroborated by the grisly footage telecast on local channels. On Monday, television crews reached Muzaffarabad and shot images of flattened structures and terrified residents in the PoK capital.The only consolation was that authorities were successful in reopening roads to this city of 2.5 lakh people and other big towns. United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations reported that trucks carrying relief supplies began arriving in the region.\n\nThe United Jehadi Council, a conglomerate of militant groups engaged in operations in Jammu and Kashmir, announced suspension of its activities.

This tragedy that has hit Pakistan and India - nations united by geography and divided by history - reminds us of a common humanity and common sense of grief and loss. It should lead to a shared desire and purpose to mitigate the suffering being played out on a gigantic scale before our eyes. This is a South Asian tragedy. It requires a national response without doubt. But it also demands a South Asian response.\n\nThere is, of course, cruel irony in the fact that the region most affected by Saturday's killer quake is also the area that has been most marked by political tensions between India and Pakistan. Kashmir, even while being visited by a calamity of such rare magnitude, continues to remain a victim of its geo-political location. The question really is this: can we rise above the limitations imposed by the past to urgently address a situation that is embedded in real time? There have been instances - few and far between - when India and Pakistan have been able to throw lifelines over borderlines. Take that moment in 2001, when Pakistan despatched tents and blankets for those affected in the Bhuj earthquake [in India]. Just a year earlier, the armies of the two nations were locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. India has, from time to time, made available its medical expertise to Pakistani patients. These are examples that can and should be multiplied as tensions wind down - and never more than today when whole villages have disappeared under rubble, when countless survivors have nothing but the sky as shelter.\n\nThat [Pakistani] President Musharraf should respond to [Indian] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's offer of help with great circumspection is not surprising. He is much more comfortable with western assistance and is frank enough to explain that there are \"sensitivities involved\" in accepting aid from India for a region that is the source of conflict between the two nations. He doesn't say it, but he is worried that the world would read this as a sign of Pakistani weakness, of its inability to administer to a region that it believes should rightly be its own. These are understandable concerns - but for more normal times. Today, Pakistan is facing the biggest natural disaster in its history and India has a great deal to contribute, not just because of its proximity to the sites of devastation but it enormous experience in handling such calamities. Ways can always be worked out to address Pakistan's sensitivities and protect its interests. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the Hurriyat Conference, spoke a good deal of sense when he appealed to both countries to \"come jointly to the rescue of thousands of people here\".\n\nindex The Hindu, October 11, 2005\n\nA tragedy and an opportunity\n\nEditorial\n\nNatural disasters recognise no boundaries, present nobody to blame, and can affect people across the socio-economic divide. The massive earthquake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale with its epicentre in the Hindu Kush mountains, exhibited all these three characteristics. The temblor devastated parts of Pakistan, Pakistan Occupied [read administered] Kashmir, India and Afghanistan; it was the result of nothing but the Indian tectonic plate's gradual and unstoppable northward shift and collision with the Eurasian plate; and it brought down everything along its deadly fault line, from posh buildings and high-rises in Islamabad to entire villages in Kashmir. The full magnitude of the destruction and a more accurate assessment of the death count (which could be over 30,000 according to some estimates) will become available only in a few days. Aid and rescue operations have been hampered by snapped power and telephone lines. Moreover, blocked roads due to landslides have made the job of reaching remote and far-flung villages, a challenge in the best of times, even more difficult. The scale of devastation in POK is so great that the destruction on the Indian side, huge though it is in absolute terms, pales in comparison. Muzaffarabad, the principal town in POK where an estimated 70 per cent of the buildings are either flattened or damaged, faced the worst of \"nature's fury.\"\n\nThe terrible tragedy may have taken place in disputed territory but it has united the two parties that stake claim to it, India and Pakistan, in a common grief. At one level, New Delhi's offer of rescue and relief assistance, which was made just hours after the earthquake by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to President Musharraf, reflected the new warmth in ties. At another level, and perhaps more importantly, it has opened up the possibility of bringing the two countries closer on an emotive issue, one that will strike an immediate chord with their peoples. If India and Pakistan had agreed to coordinate their disaster relief operations, such mutual assistance would have constituted an important confidence building measure. But Islamabad, which has turned down this proposal, is obviously worried about the political ramifications of allowing the Indian Army, which undertakes much of the relief and rescue work, access into POK. Given such sensitivities, it may be far too optimistic to expect that the earthquake will pay a large peace dividend, but some sort of cooperation between the two countries can and must be set in place. Large numbers of people on one side of Kashmir have relatives on the other and it is imperative - as the moderate Hurriyat leader, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, has stressed - for the two countries to restore communication links and facilitate the free flow of information across the line of control. The earthquake has damaged Aman Setu, the bridge connecting the two parts of Kashmir that symbolises the thaw in their ties. It will be repaired shortly but the tragedy has offered New Delhi and Islamabad a greater opportunity: that of establishing an emotional bridge between the two countries.\n\nindex The Daily Times, October 11, 2005\n\nHRCP expresses grief over massive quake loss\n\nStaff Report\n\nLAHORE: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) chairperson, office-bearers and council members have expressed sorrow over the massive human loss and devastation caused by the earthquake.\n\n\"The HRCP has directed our correspondents, core-group activists and members to offer whatever assistance and succour they can to earthquake victims, and to help Edhi Trust teams for this purpose. Aiding those unable to access relief is particularly important at this time,\" said a statement issued on Monday on behalf of HRCP Chairperson Asma Jahangir and General Secretary Syed Iqbal Haider.\n\nThe HRCP is coordinating its relief operation with the Joint Action Committee for Peoples Rights (JACPR). \"Sungi Foundation, a non-government organisation, will be the focal point and HRCP members will provide vital information and identify groups for relief distribution,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scale of the tragedy demands wholehearted efforts from all citizens, especially people's rights activists, it added.

Phones: 051-0092-51-2282481, 2282482).\n\nThe HRCP hoped that the government's relief efforts would be completely transparent, especially as many months of effort would be required to rehabilitate and re-house survivors. \"An assessment of the relief operation's effectiveness may become necessary at a later date, as the emerging picture regarding measures taken becomes clearer in the weeks ahead,\" the statement concluded.\n\nindex counterpunch.org, October 11, 2005\n\nThings are Bad and Getting Worse\n\nPakistan Will Never Forget This Horror\n\nby Tariq Ali The scale of the disaster has traumatized the entire country or perhaps not quite. Here in Lahore a group of people collecting funds for earthquake relief were apprehended and charged. They were amassing money for themselves. Even in the midst of disaster, life goes on. Like a giant vulture flock, the global media has descended on the country. The same images repeated every few minutes over three days. The same banal comments. Soon they will get tired and move on. When they are really needed, to monitor relief efforts and reconstruction, to maintain a watch on the funds and alert viewers to the inevitable corruption (in the past blankets and tinned food designed for victims of the floods earlier this year were being openly sold in the black-market) they will not be there. The South is only worth a disaster. Emote and disappear. And as the media circus moves on the citizens of the West--they with the short memory spans--also forget. Pakistan will never forget this horror.\n\nThe picture in the North-West of the country is much worse than has been reported. The Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz, a World Bank favourite, lost his cool at local journalists for reporting the destruction of schools and the deaths of hundreds of children. \"Why are you being sensationalist? Be optimistic!\" The defensiveness was unnecessary. Nobody blames the regime for the earthquake and even the normally loquacious Frontier province and Afghan mullahs, eager to pronounce Katrina as God's punishment for US wars, have fallen silent. Why would Allah punish the Islamist strongholds in Pakistan?\n\nThe death toll has been underestimated. Balakot, a small city which is the gateway to the beautiful Kaghan valley and heavily dependent on seasonal tourism, has been destroyed. Corpses litter the streets. According to today's estimates, at least half of the city's population of 100,000 is now dead. A whole generation has been wiped out. Survivors were, till yesterday, without food or water because the roads had been wrecked and helicopters were in short supply.\n\nIt is the same story in Muzaffarabad, in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Everything is wrecked. Here there have been anti-Government manifestations and citizens have looted shops in search of food, just like in New Orleans. Further up on the Indo-Pak border where a state of permanent tension is deliberately kept alive by both sides, there was another tragedy. 400 Pakistani soldiers, sitting in their trenches were crushed to death as the mountain wall protecting them crashed and buried them alive.\n\nWhat of the relief effort? The government is doing its best, but it is not enough. The lack of a proper infrastructure, no serious reserve funds in the budget to deal with unexpected tragedies and a total lack of preparedness despite annual disasters on a lesser scale, has cost innumerable lives. To watch General Musharraf on state television bemoaning the shortage of helicopters was instructive. A few miles to the north of the disaster zone there is a large fleet of helicopters belonging to the Western armies occupying parts of Afghanistan. Why could the US, German and British commanders not dispatch these to save lives? Is the war so fierce that these were needed every single day? Five days after the earthquake, the US released 8 helicopters from war duty to help transport food and water to isolated villages. Too little, too late.\n\nThe Pakistan Army has been put into action, but armies here and elsewhere, are not suited to relief effort. They are not trained to save lives and reports today that aid convoys are being attacked and seized by angry crowds long before they reach their destination is an indication of the chaos. Even in normal times the poor have limited access to doctors and nurses. The state-of-the-art hospitals in the big cities are exclusively for the wealthy. The shortage of medical staff has been a curse for the last fifty years. No regime, military or civilian, has succeeded in creating a proper social infrastructure, a safety net for its less privileged citizens who compose a large majority of the population. At times like this the entire country feels the need, but it will soon be forgotten, till the next disaster. In a privatized world, the state is not encouraged to buck the system. Things are bad here this week, but they will get worse when rescue teams arrive in areas still out of reach.\n\nTariq Ali is author of the recently released Street Fighting Years (new edition) and, with David Barsamian, Speaking of Empires & Resistance.\n\nindex The Hindu, October 10, 2005\n\nPakistan quake death toll touches 20,000\n\nB.

Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao told a news conference here after an emergency Cabinet meeting that the Government still had no access to three of the four worst-hit districts in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\nPoK Communications Minister Tariq Farooq told the local media that the death toll in PoK alone could reach 30,000 as the focus so far had been only on the main towns, not the mountain villages.\n\nAftershocks continue\n\nThe aftershocks, which continued through the second day, only added to the woes of people stranded in the affected areas. In the capital city, every time a tremor was felt people ran out into the streets. Most people preferred to spend the night in the open.\n\nMr. Sherpao said 70 per cent of the houses in the three worst affected districts in PoK, including the capital city of Muzaffarabad, were destroyed. Landslips triggered by the earthquake blocked road links to the region, cutting it off.\n\nThe Pakistan Army suffered casualties in PoK; 200 personnel were killed and 450 Army officers and personnel injured.\n\nAfter PoK, the North West Frontier Province was the worst hit. Around 1,760 people have been confirmed dead and 1,797 people are believed to be injured. The Government does not have estimates of the number displaced in the province. It may run into the thousands if not a million as in at least three districts in the province, 50 to 70 per cent of the houses have been reduced to rubble.\n\nWith the arrival of a team of experts from Britain the operation to remove the debris of the 10-storied Margalla Tower in the capital was intensified in a bid to rescue people trapped under it. By Sunday evening, around 80 persons were rescued from under the debris.\n\nAfter an aerial survey of the affected areas in PoK, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf asked the international community to assist the country with supplies of medicine, tents, cargo helicopters and financial assistance.\n\n\"We do seek international assistance, we have enough manpower but we need financial support so that we may utilise it in a required way to cope with the tragedy. Then there is a need for large supplies of medicines, tents and cargo helicopters to reach out to people in far-flung and cut-off areas, the bigger these copters the better,\" he said on the State-run Pakistan Television.\n\nGen. Musharraf said there were reports of extensive damage in Muzaffarabad with 50 per cent of the hilly city believed to be devastated; a number of schools and hospitals had collapsed and children were trapped inside the schools.\n\nIn the Mansehra and Balakot areas, there were massive losses.\n\nDue to the landslips, the administration is dependent on air services to reach people in PoK. Civil aviation helicopters were pressed into service and the C-130s of the Pakistan Air Force were ready to drop food, water and emergency medicine.\n\nPrime Minister Shaukat Aziz told journalists after an aerial tour of the affected areas in the Frontier that a three-day mourning would be observed to express solidarity with the people who had lost their relatives in the natural disaster.\n\nMr. Aziz said the Cabinet decided to pay Rs. 100,000 to each of the victim's families. It would help survivors to repair infrastructure.

And why would any merciful god have punished those who rushed in to save them?\n\nI can only suggest to those who believe in such a possibility that, perhaps, the children died as an unavoidable fallout of Divine Fury, directed at the real sinners - the damned Religious Right, which unleashes acts of political and personal aggression against those who challenge them in any way, or disagree with their version of Faith.\n\nSurely, they, with their misuse of the Hudood Ordinances, falsification of blasphemy cases, killing of worshippers who belong to another sect or belief system, sodomizing of children trusted to their care for 'religious' education, torturing of spouses in ways that even the Marquis de Sade did not imagine, the inventing of 'traditions' and issuing 'fatvaas' to suit their personal purposes - and the covert incitement to countless forms of terrorism - deserve such fury more than the poor souls they successfully misguide.\n\nindex The Hindu, October 9, 2005\n\nMore than 2,000 feared killed as quake rocks Pakistan\n\nB.

Reports said the town was the worst hit. Agencies said more than 1,000 people died in PoK alone, mostly in the capital. In the North West Frontier Province, 400 school children were killed when their school buildings collapsed. In the same province and in PoK, 200 soldiers were killed.\n\nAccording to Shaukat Sultan, Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 50 per cent of the buildings either collapsed or were damaged in Muzaffarabad.\n\nAs the communications systems collapsed, details of the destruction were not yet known.\n\nThere was panic in the national capital as the earth began shaking at 8.52 a.m. (9.22 a.m. IST).

More than 2,000 houses were damaged, and thousands became shelter-less in minutes.\n\nAll parts of the State were jolted but the border districts of Kupwara, Baramulla and Poonch bore the brunt, due to their proximity to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, where the epicentre of the quake lay. The entire Uri town, adjoining Muzaffarabad district of PoK was flattened. Officials of the 15 Corps told The Hindu that more than 120 persons were killed and over 300 injured in the Uri sector of Baramulla district. In the same sector, 20 Army personnel were killed and 37 injured.\n\nAuthorities in Baramulla district told The Hindu that more than 90 per cent of the houses in 54 villages were completely destroyed. Many people were feared buried under the rubble. Baramulla town also suffered damage. Two persons were killed and 80 others injured there.\n\nIn the Tangdhar sector of Kupwara district, another forward area north of Baramulla district, 20 persons were killed and more than 100 others injured.\n\nIn Poonch district, 10 persons were killed. The famous Moti Mahal building in the heart of the town, housing soldiers of the Poonch brigade, was completely destroyed. The soldiers were evacuated and taken to the military hospital.\n\nOfficial sources said the bodies of 197 civilians and 36 Army personnel were recovered all over the State. The number of injured stood at 650, including 82 Army personnel.\n\nThe full impact of the quake could not be known as roads to many of the affected villages remained inaccessible due to landslips. No contact could be established with many villages and people protested against the poor response of the administration. As the roads were blocked, relief was sent by air to Uri and Tangdhar. However, the Baramulla-Uri and the Kupwara-Tangdhar roads were opened in the evening.\n\nThe Government cancelled the leave of absence sanctioned for all medical and para-medical staff.

The Government said those who lost their houses would be accommodated in school buildings.\n\nindex The News International, October 8, 2005\n\nOne step forward, two steps back\n\nPraful Bidwai\n\nThe most that can be said about Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's visit to Pakistan is that the two neighbours have barely managed to salvage their dialogue from a downturn. There was no breakthrough on any issue, including the relatively tractable Siachen and Sir Creek disputes. But India and Pakistan have successfully taken out the gravely, discordant, note out of their conversation, which became audible in New York last month in references to United Nations resolutions and cross-border terrorism. The return of a degree of cordiality and earnestness in India-Pakistan exchanges is more than a little welcome.\n\nYet, it's evident that both states are proceeding with the utmost caution. Take the language of their joint statement. Its boldest formulation says: \"The two sides exchanged ideas on the Siachen issue and agreed to continue their discussions so as to arrive at a common understanding before commencement of the next round of the composite dialogue ...\" On other issues, officials merely \"welcomed the ongoing diplomatic discussions in a framework to promote a settlement... on a mutually acceptable basis\".\n\nNatwar Singh has since even played down the optimistic note on Siachen by declaring that \"there is no deadline\", but \"we hope the talks will move forward\". One can only hope he was being overcautious. The substantive agreement on Siachen is specifically focussed on six issues: identifying the positions currently held by the two armies, agreement on the positions to which their troops shall withdraw, defining the areas of disengagement, creation of arrangements to monitor the pullback, establishing a verification mechanism to rule out future violations; and settling the Line of Control beyond reference point NJ-9842.\n\nThis detailed formulation leads to the inference that India and Pakistan may be close to reaching an agreement, just as they were August last year, indeed, as far back as in 1989. Nevertheless, worries and reservations persist among their military leaders.\n\nThe Indian military is keen to demarcate its troops' precise existing positions -- something that Pakistan's brass believes will amount to endorsing India's \"aggression\". India reportedly holds two of the three crucial passes around the glacier. It does not want to surrender this \"advantage\" without its troops position being recorded. Pakistan is reluctant to identify the location of its troops.\n\nThe \"advantages\" are mostly illusory. The considerations at work are largely about false notions of \"honour\", \"prestige\", \"humiliation\" and \"surrender\". They must not be allowed to block agreement. Siachen, it bears repeating a hundred times, is the world's highest-altitude -- and also it's most pointless and strategically ludicrous -- war. It costs India Rs20-25 million a day, and Pakistan perhaps only slightly less. The two countries have lost thousands of soldiers on the glacier's icy slopes -- not so much to gunshots as to frostbite.\n\nA much larger number of those who serve in these ultra-harsh conditions amidst total desolation have developed severe psychiatric problems, including extreme anxiety, stress disorders and chronic depression. These colossal human and material costs would be hard to justify even if Siachen had exceptional strategic importance. But it has no strategic significance whatever. The glacier leads nowhere. Control over it gives no privileged access to another strategic location either.\n\nIt's hard to understand how military leaders who even minimally respect the rights of soldiers (\"our boys\") countenance such wanton destruction and gratuitous assaults on their bodies and minds. Such callousness beggars belief. It also calls for a political initiative to take matters out of the generals' hands. They often don't make wise, discriminating judgments about strategic issues, leave alone human rights.\n\nThat's exactly what India and Pakistan need to do. Leadership is all about that. If Manmohan Singh and Musharraf can't summon up the will to crack even the Siachen dispute, they will have proved that they don't lead from the front. They will also have proved the hollowness of the promise to make Siachen a \"mountain of peace\". Rather, Siachen's glacial speed will literally set the pace of the India-Pakistan dialogue.\n\nThe hard part of the India-Pakistan talks is yet to come -- Kashmir, nuclear weapons, demilitarisation, complete end to all support to hostile groups, water, trade, freer movement of people. So far, India and Pakistan have dragged their feet over implementing even what they agreed to -- for instance, reopening consulates in Karachi and Mumbai. Even on the Nankana Saheb and Poonch-Rawalakot bus services, they insist on holding \"technical-level\" talks, as if the schedule and capacity of the buses were a highly complex issues soluble only with uncommon expertise.\n\nSuch ultra-conservative, ossified mindsets must change if there's to be a breakthrough, indeed if the dialogue is to be sustained through the present stage. It's not easy to see how this can happen. As this Column has argued earlier, there is merit in non-reciprocal, unilateralist approaches -- whether on visas, trade and investment, or demilitarisation.\n\nOn Kashmir, there's some hope. There's a cross-LoC dialogue for the first time ever, and the Indian government and the majority faction of the Hurriyat Conference have met. The dialogue needs to be expanded and speeded up. But it's already clear that the Kashmiris have a mind of their own, and will follow an independent approach, given a chance. By all accounts, there has been a remarkable improvement in the situation in Indian Kashmir. This too should facilitate resolution of the dispute within the agreed parameters.\n\nIt's on the nuclear and missile issues that there's no cause for hope or optimism. Both India and Pakistan continue to pretend that their nuclear weapons are not destabilising -- when they manifestly are. This is an extension of the charade the two played out in the 1980s and most of the 1990s. Then, each tacitly accepted that the other was developing/had developed nuclear weapons; that was only \"normal\" and \"natural\". On missiles too, the two have shown deplorable complacency.\n\nAfter their nuclear tests, they should have agreed to a missile tests-flight ban to delay the deployment of nuclear weapons on delivery vehicles with a far greater reach than warplanes. Instead, they have plunged headlong into a missile race, which has dangerously shifted beyond the ballistic level, to include cruise missiles.\n\nThe agreement signed last Monday permits both sides to test-fire ballistic missiles from as close as 40 km inside their border, with an impact-site (where the missile can land) limit of 75 km. Apparently, India wanted the test-site at least 120 km inside the border. But Pakistan insisted on 40 km. This was an insane bargain, given that both have whole classes of missiles with a range several times greater than 120 km.\n\nThe deal's implications are clear. The two adversaries, with no strategic distance worth the name between them, have cynically chipped away at margins of safety and assurances regarding unusual occurrences. Now, missile tests perilously close to the border will be considered \"normal\" within the context of a half-century-long hot-cold war.\n\nThis is a retrograde step even in relation to the nuclear and missile confidence-building measures agreed in 1999, themselves inadequate. This is bad news for India-Pakistan relations in general. Unless the two stop regarding each other as strategic adversaries - what else are nuclear rivals? - they cannot talk peace in ways that are authentic or organic to their security interests.\n\nThe writer, a former newspaper editor, is a researcher and peace and human-rights activist based in Delhi\n\nindex The News International, October 5, 2005\n\nPakistan - India : Missile test agreement\n\nEditorial\n\nOnly hours before Islamabad and New Delhi signed an agreement on warning each other prior to testing any ballistic missiles, India test fired an Akash missile from a sea-based launcher, not once but three times, and without warning Pakistan. In fact, it never needed to because Akash, being a surface-to-air missile, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the agreement which covers only the testing of surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nThe agreement, signed by Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri and his Indian counterpart Natwar Singh after reviewing the second round of the on-going dialogue process between the two countries, therefore, at best warrants partial celebrations. The missile programmes of both India and Pakistan intend to acquire everything that technology can offer: From long-range air-to-surface ballistic missiles like Pakistan's Shaheen and India's Agni to cruise missiles which the former is developing as Babur and the latter as BrahMos, with various machines of short and medium range falling in between, their arsenal is too varied to be covered by anyagreement which fails to cover all types of missile technologies available.\n\nA welcome development in its own right, however, the agreement is yet another step in the direction of preventing fatal and strategic accidents that may be caused by un-intentional, untargeted acts by the two countries. It's indeed a perfect follow up on 'Prohibition of Attack Against Nuclear Installations and Facilities' that was signed by the two South Asian neighbours on December 31, 1988.\n\nBut the failings of the agreement on missile testing are as glaring as its achievements. On August 11, 2005, only five days after a memorandum of understanding was signed as a precursor to the agreement signed on Monday, Pakistan test fired its first cruise missile Babur. Now India's testing of Akash on the same day the agreement was signed only serves to highlight that any missile control regime in South Asia needs to go further than it has already gone.\n\nThe Akash test is certain to evoke a response from Pakistan, first through diplomatic channels informing on its fall-outs, followed by scientific and military ones which can be translated as the testing of a similar looking machine. We have already observed India and Pakistan conducting tit-for-tat missile tests not once but on a number of occasions. This race to outmatch each other in the destruction, range, speed and accuracy of their missile systems will unfortunately go on, agreement or no agreement.\n\nThe real need, therefore, is not to look for an improved agreement on missile testing or a different agreement covering different missiles, for none of them can be comprehensive enough to cover all the types and ranges of missiles the countries have, but to have an altogether different agreement: The one which ensures that Pakistan and India carry out no more nuclear tests at all. South Asia will become a safe region only once we stop producing weapons of mass destruction, along with the technology to deliver them, and ensure that the ones we have already acquired are not used. Till then, the two sides will keep benefiting from one flaw or the other in the early warning regimes to have an upper hand.\n\nindex\n\nHOME Landelijke India Werkgroep\n\npagina KRUITVAT INDIA-PAKISTAN"
