        "text": "Image by Isaac Fryxelius from Pixabay\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Economics is more accurately called the „Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Science in Memory of Alfred Nobel“ and has been awarded for the first time in 1969. On the occasion of its 300th anniversary in 1968, the Swedish National Bank established the prize and is still funding it until today. As the prize is awarded every year together with the Nobel Prizes that Alfred Nobel initiated in 1895 (for the categories Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics and Physiology/Medicine), it has become entrenched to call it Nobel Prize too.\n\nFor more than 50 years the Nobel Prize in Economics is seen as the most prestigious award in its field and has given scientific authority to ideas that have shaped our economic system.\n\nNevertheless, ever since its beginning a lot of people have been questioning its existence and its importance. One argument, which has been put forward, is that Alfred Nobel himself is said to have been had the opinion that economic sciences is too unprecise and not on the same level as the before mentioned fundamental sciences.\n\nOverview\n\n2020: Auction theory and new auction formats\n\nPaul Milgrom and Robert Wilson\n\n2019: Social Experiments to Alleviate Poverty\n\nAbhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer\n\n2019 Not the Nobel: Reimagine the Role of the State\n\nMariana Mazzucato\n\n2018: The Economics of Climate Change\n\nWilliam Nordhaus\n\n2017: Integrating Economics with Psychology\n\nRichard Thaler\n\n...\n\nOf course, there are many more.
