Williamson was a pioneer in the multi-disciplinary field of transaction cost economics, and one of the world’s most cited economists. Williamson was chosen for the prize “for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm.” He shared the 2009 prize with Elinor Ostrom, a professor of political science and of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington.\n\nWilliams was the Edgar F. Kaiser Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business and Professor Emeritus of Economics and Law at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRead Oliver Williamson’s obituary in our newsroom.\n\nSee Oliver Williamson’s work on Google Scholar.\n\nBooks by Oliver Williamson\n\nThe Mechanisms of Governance\n\nMarkets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications\n\nThe Economic Institutions of Capitalism: Firms, Markets, Relational Contracting\n\nBooks inspired by Williamson’s work\n\nFirms, Markets and Hierarchies: The Transaction Cost Economics Perspective, by Glenn R.
