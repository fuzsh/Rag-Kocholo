        "text": "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded 44 times to 71 Laureates who have researched and tested dozens of ground-breaking ideas. Here are five prize-winning economic theories that you'll want to be familiar with. These are ideas you're likely to hear about in news stories, because they apply to major aspects of our everyday lives. (Read More: How Influential Economists Changed Our History)\n\n1. Management of Common Pool Resources\n\nIn 2009, Indiana University political science professor Elinor Ostrom became the first woman to win the prize. She received it \"for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons.\" Ostrom's research showed how groups work together to manage common resources such as water supplies, fish and lobster stocks, and pastures through collective property rights. She showed that ecologist Garrett Hardin's prevailing theory of the \"tragedy of the commons\" is not the only possible outcome, or even the most likely outcome, when people share a common resource.\n\nHardin's theory says that common resources should be owned by the government or divided into privately owned lots to prevent the resources from becoming depleted through overuse. He said that each individual user will try to obtain maximum personal benefit from the resource to the detriment of later users. Ostrom showed that common pool resources can be effectively managed collectively, without government or private control, as long as those using the resource are physically close to it and have a relationship with each other. Because outsiders and government agencies don't understand local conditions or norms, and lack relationships with the community, they may manage common resources poorly. By contrast, insiders who are given a say in resource management will self-police to ensure that all participants follow the community's rules.\n\n3. Asymmetric Information\n\nIn 2001, George A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence and Joseph E. Stiglitz won the prize \"for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information.\" The trio showed that economic models predicated on perfect information are often misguided because, in reality, one party to a transaction often has superior information, a phenomenon known as \"information asymmetry.\"\n\nAn understanding of information asymmetry has improved our understanding of how various types of markets really work and the importance of corporate transparency. Akerlof showed how information asymmetries in the used car market, where sellers know more than buyers about the quality of their vehicles, can create a market with numerous lemons (a concept known as \"adverse selection\"). A key publication related to this prize is Akerlof's 1970 journal article, \"The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.\"\n\nSpence's research focused on signaling, or how better-informed market participants can transmit information to lesser-informed participants. For example, he showed how job applicants can use educational attainment as a signal to prospective employers about their likely productivity and how corporations can signal their profitability to investors by issuing dividends.\n\nStiglitz showed how insurance companies can learn which customers present a greater risk of incurring high expenses (a process he called \"screening\") by offering different combinations of deductibles and premiums.\n\nToday, these concepts are so widespread that we take them for granted, but when they were first developed, they were groundbreaking.\n\n4. Game Theory\n\nThe academy awarded the 1994 prize to John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash Jr. and Reinhard Selten \"for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games.\" The theory of non-cooperative games is a branch of the analysis of strategic interaction commonly known as \"game theory.\" Non-cooperative games are those in which participants make non-binding agreements. Each participant bases his or her decisions on how he or she expects other participants to behave, without knowing how they will actually behave.\n\nOne of Nash's major contributions was the Nash Equilibrium, a method for predicting the outcome of non-cooperative games based on equilibrium. Nash's 1950 doctoral dissertation, \"Non-Cooperative Games,\" details his theory. The Nash Equilibrium expanded upon earlier research on two-player, zero-sum games. Selten applied Nash's findings to dynamic strategic interactions, and Harsanyi applied them to scenarios with incomplete information to help develop the field of information economics. Their contributions are widely used in economics, such as in the analysis of oligopoly and the theory of industrial organization, and have inspired new fields of research.\n\n5. Public Choice Theory\n\nJames M. Buchanan Jr. received the prize in 1986 \"for his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.\" Buchanan's major contributions to public choice theory bring together insights from political science and economics to explain how public-sector actors (e.g., politicians and bureaucrats) make decisions. He showed that, contrary to the conventional wisdom that public-sector actors act in the public's best interest (as \"public servants\"), politicians and bureaucrats tend to act in their own self-interest, just like private-sector actors (e.g., consumers and entrepreneurs). He described his theory as \"politics without romance.\""
