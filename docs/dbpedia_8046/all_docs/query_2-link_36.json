        "text": "Congratulations to Claudia Goldin, who was awarded the 2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences today\" for having advanced our understanding of women's labor market outcomes.\" Professor Claudia Goldin was a faculty member at Penn Economics from 1979 to 1990. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in announcing the prize, explained that Goldin \"provided the first comprehensive account of women's earnings and labor market participation through the centuries. Her research reveals the causes of change, as well as the main sources of the remaining gender gap.\" Click here for a high-level summary of Professor Goldin's contribution, and here for a longer account of her work.\n\nClaudia Goldin joins seven prior Penn-affiliated Nobel laureates who have won the Nobel Prize in Economics: Simon Kuznets (1971), Lawrence Klein (1980), Edward Prescott (2004), Edmund Phelps (2006), Oliver Williamson (2009), Thomas Sargent (2011) and Robert Shiller (2013)."
