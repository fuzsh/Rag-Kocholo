        "text": "Every year the Nobel prizes laureates are announced and as a movie fan is eager to hear who won an Oscars, scientists are eager to hear who won a Nobel Memorial Prize. The names of the winners might not always be familiar to most people, but the work they did most likely affected many if not the whole world. A while ago I was reminded of Elinor Ostrom by pure coincidence because her name was used on a new university building in the city I live. Ostrom was an American political economist and moreover she was the first of only two women to have ever won the Nobel Prize in economics. While reading this I felt guilt going through my veins. Although I always pay attention to who wins and on what topic, I never noticed how women were so tremendously underrepresented within the area of economics.\n\nAs economics is more and more involved in so many disciplines of development it requires gender equality and what better way to also show that than with the Nobel Prize. Men and women agree on many things, but also have different visions and ideas on many aspects concerning economic development. Reaching solutions that are supported by the people requires the inclusion of the views of men and women on all levels.\n\nOstrom receive the Nobel Prize in 2009 for her research on commons. While most economists of her time assumed that the sharing of natural resources would automatically lead to overuse and depletion Ostrom thought something else and was convinced that small groups could manage in sustainable way. Instead of going with the mainstream she was so convinced that she gave up her position at UCLA to be able to investigate this new thinking at Indiana University. A famous quote from her that became known as Ostrom’s law is:” A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory.” For me it means that if something works good in the reality it should not be tampered with by science or anyone until we can explain how and why it works the way it does.\n\nOstrom left her traces in the world of science and showed with her research that women in economics are needed. She won the Nobel Prize in 2009 and it took 10 years for another woman, Esther Duflo, to win in 2019. Let us hope and make sure it does not take that long for the next woman to win."
