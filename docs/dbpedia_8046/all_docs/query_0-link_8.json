        "text": "What we call the Ostrom Workshop formally began as The Center in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. It was founded at Indiana University in 1973 by Vincent and Elinor \"Lin\" Ostrom, she being the Nobel Prize-winning economist. The Ostroms believed ideas and theories must be considered through the lens of experience—that the critical connection is between ideas and what gets done.\n\nDuring our 50 years, the Workshop has become the epicenter of commons governance, with research affiliates from around the nation and the world. Current research has expanded from studying water and forestry governance, to opera sustainability and space governance.\n\nVincent and Elinor Ostrom married in 1963 and started at IU two years later with Vincent as a full professor at the Department of Political Science and Elinor as a visiting assistant professor. “I had the good luck to be offered a visiting assistant professor position,” recalls Elinor, adding, “since they needed someone to teach political science at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and I was willing to do that.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Ostroms built their home near Bloomington and undertook an interest in woodworking and carpentry. Under the apprenticeship of furniture maker Paul Goodman, the Ostroms developed an appreciation for apprenticing, particularly in a workshop setting that pushed their understanding and skills. This would be one of the reasons the “Center for Political Theory and Policy Analysis” would consistently be referred to by the Ostroms as “the workshop”.\n\n“One of the reasons we called this place a workshop instead of a center was because of working with Paul and understanding what artisanship was. You might be working on something like a cabinet and thinking about the design of it, and thinking this idea versus that idea, and then Paul could pick up a board and say, oh, you shouldn’t use this one because it will split. He could see things in wood that we couldn’t. So the whole idea of artisans and apprentices and the structure of a good workshop really made an impression on us.” —Elinor Ostrom\n\nThe term “workshop” represents the belief the skills for this type of research are best acquired and used in a setting where students, working as apprentices and journeymen, have the opportunity to collaborate with experienced scholars.\n\nFrom a simple tradition of voluntarily organizing weekly colloquia with their colleagues across campus, the Ostroms crafted an academic environment where students, visiting scholars, and colleagues from diverse disciplines in academia and in the field across the world interacted daily, studying issues of institutional analysis and collective action.\n\nOver the last half-century, Workshop scholars have produced pioneering research and taught generations of students about the ways in which governance processes at the local, national, and global levels can be crafted to enhance human well-being. All while promoting democratic principles and sustainable resource management.\n\nIn their work, the Ostroms delved deeply into how governance arrangements affect the performance of urban police agencies, irrigation systems, and forest resources. These natural resources are part of “the commons”, a set of cultural and natural assets available to all members of a society and are not privately owned.\n\nVincent Ostrom’s pioneering studies on metropolitan governance along with Elinor (Lin) Ostrom’s empirical work on polycentricity and local public economies focused on national problems. Later, Lin’s extended studies on common-pool resources added both a global dimension and a focus on self-governance.\n\nIn 2009, Lin Ostrom was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences “for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons.” The Ostroms’ persistent search to better understand the diversity of formal and informal rules that shape human behavior was also driven by a keen interest to better understand policy implications with practical solutions to societal problems. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in economics.\n\nToday, the Ostrom Workshop is leveraging the intellectual legacy of its founders to continue addressing governance problems. These governance problems include the formal and informal rules that shape human behavior. We believe that we will solve major societal problems only by taking a complex, interdisciplinary approach."
