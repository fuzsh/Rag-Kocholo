She emphasized the importance of analyzing problems through diagnosis rather than simply painting the world in a black-and-white picture of âgoodâ or âbadâ. Instead, she said, we must dig under the terms and see who has access and what kind.\n\nProf. Ostrom focused on the Social Ecological Systems (SES) framework for looking at how people interact in a diverse system. Prof. Ostrom told researchers and students: âTo do good research one must choose the question carefullyâ. Thus, not only did Prof. Ostrom give an engaging lecture on the subject material of the SES framework and current research on ecological systems, she also gave important advice to the audience on research methodology while introducing an innovative way of looking at the world. A lively discussion period with the Tsinghua audience followed.\n\nAfter the lecture Prof. Ostrom attended a professorsâ roundtable at SPPM, where she was able to learn about the work and research centers of SPPM, as well as exchange views with SPPM professors on their research interests.\n\nProf. Elinor Ostrom won the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and was the first woman to receive the economics prize in the 41-history of the award."
