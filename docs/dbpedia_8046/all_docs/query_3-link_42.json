        "text": "A political scientist from Indiana University whose work exploring how people come together to preserve their collective resources may provide important clues in the fight against climate change has become the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics.\n\nElinor Ostrom, 76, shares the award with fellow American academic Oliver Williamson, 77, whose work focuses on a similar area of the relationship between individuals, companies and government.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the pair had been chosen to win the 40th prize in economic sciences because they both challenged established thinking on economic governance – a poignant statement given that the global financial crisis has left perceived economic wisdom looking more than a little tarnished.\n\nFor Ostrom, the award came, as she revealed, as an \"immense surprise\". To rise to the pinnacle of her area of learning has been an immense journey, as she has had to struggle against her own weaknesses and the impediments of the system.\n\nAt school in Los Angeles she suffered from stuttering. Paradoxically, it was partly as a result of the treatment for her speech impediment that she was given – she was put into debating society – that she acquired a love of argument and of thinking about policy.\n\nShe also faced the hurdles common to most women of her generation entering the sciences – she was discouraged from taking a PhD when she applied for graduate school.\n\nHer field of study has been striking for how cross-disciplinary it is. Early on she gained a reputation for bringing economics, political science and sociology together.\n\nWhat interests her is how common property can be managed successfully through groups in society. One of the first subjects that interested her was management of water resources.She has also looked at the management of fish stocks, pastures, woods and groundwater basins.\n\nThe findings of her research have been striking, as the Nobel committee pointed out, because they have challenged the established assumption that common property is poorly managed unless it is either regulated by government or privatised. She has shown how disparate individuals can band together and form collectives that protect the resource at hand.\n\nThat is an important message at a time when policymakers are grappling with how to cope with global warming. Again, it challenges a conventional assumption that without regulation or the action of private enterprise, no progress to change individual behaviour can be made.\n\n\"A lot of people are waiting for more international co-operation to solve [global warming],\" Ostrom said being told she had won the award. \"There is this assumption that there are public officials who are geniuses, and that the rest of us are not.\n\n\"It is important that there is international agreement, but we can be taking steps at family level, community level, civic and national level … There are many steps that can be taken that will not solve it on their own but cumulatively will make a big difference.\"\n\nShe is one of a record five women who have been awarded Nobels this year; only 40 have won in the history of the prizes. The other winners this year are Herta Mueller who took the literature prize; Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider for physiology or medicine; and Ada Yonath for chemistry.\n\nOstrom will receive 5m Swedish crowns (about £453,000), as will Williamson. A professor emeritus at the Haas School of Business, Williamson's work has centred on the way in which conflicts of interest are handled in different ways by hierarchical organisations, such as firms, compared with stockmarkets. It explains why it is sometimes better for a company to develop a product or service inhouse, rather than buying it from outside."
