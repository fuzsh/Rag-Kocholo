        "text": "Students at ZU working towards a Master's Degree also have the opportunity to work on their own research projects.\n\nIn addition to compulsory projects and research modules, the AMC, CME and PAIR Master's programs also have optional modules in which students are able to pursue their research in collaboration with study chairs or partners in practice on an individual and interdisciplinary basis.\n\nWho was Elinor Ostrom?\n\nBorn on August 7, 1933 in the USA, Lin Ostrom graduated in Political Science from the University of California in 1965 achieving a Doctor of Philosophy. She embodies the interdisciplinarity of ZU par excellence -- she was a professor of Political Science and a leading researcher in the field of Environmental Economics, who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. In her work, she deals with topics that relate to contemporary issues such as sustainability and self-organization.\n\nWhen you access external media via our website, which we integrate into our web pages to provide videos, flipbooks, social media applications, and maps (among other things), certain data such as your IP address is transmitted to the providers of the respective services.
