        "text": "When Swedish chemist and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-96), the inventor of dynamite, established a series of prizes to be awarded for distinguished achievement in Peace, Chemistry, Literature, Physics, and Medicine, Economics was not among the disciplines. Given the growing importance of Economics, the Sveriges Riksbank, in celebration of its 300th anniversary, created a prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. Listed below are links to the Nobel internet archive and a profile of laureates in Economics."
