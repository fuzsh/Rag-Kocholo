        "text": "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded 52 times to 86 Laureates who have researched and tested dozens of ground-breaking ideas. These five prize-winning economic theories are ideas you're likely to hear about in news stories because they apply to major aspects of our everyday lives.\n\n1. Managing Common Pool Resources (CPRs)\n\nThe term common pool resources (CPRs) refers to those that aren't owned by one particular entity. They're held by the government or they're allocated to privately owned lots that are made available to the general public. CPRs, or commons as they're commonly known, are those that are available to everyone but are in finite supply. They include forests, waterways and water basins, and fishing grounds.\n\nEcologist Garrett Hardin wrote \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" which appeared in Science in 1968. He addressed the overpopulation of the human race in relation to these resources. Hardin surmised that everyone would act in their own best interests and would end up consuming as much as they possibly could. This would make these resources even harder for others to find.\n\nIndiana University political science professor Elinor Ostrom became the first woman to win the prize in 2009. She received it \"for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons.\"\n\nOstrom's Groundbreaking Research\n\nOstrom's research showed how groups work together to manage common resources such as water supplies, fish, lobster stocks, and pastures through collective property rights. She showed that Hardin's prevailing tragedy of the commons theory isn't the only possible outcome or even the most likely outcome when people share a common resource.\n\nOstrom showed that CPRs can be effectively managed collectively without government or private control as long as those who use the resource are physically close to it and have a relationship with each other.\n\nOutsiders and government agencies don't understand local conditions or norms and they lack relationships with the community so they may manage common resources poorly. By contrast, insiders with a say in resource management will self-police to ensure that all participants follow the community's rules.\n\n2. Behavioral Finance\n\nBehavioral finance is a form of behavioral economics. It studies the psychological influences and biases that affect the behavior and decisions of investors as well as financial professionals. These influences and biases tend to explain various market anomalies, especially those found in the stock market. This includes very drastic increases and drops in the price of securities.\n\nPsychologist Daniel Kahneman was awarded the prize in 2002 \"for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.\"\n\nKahneman's Work\n\nKahneman showed that people do not always act out of rational self-interest as the economic theory of expected utility maximization would predict. This concept is crucial to behavioral finance. The research identified common cognitive biases that cause people to use faulty reasoning to make irrational decisions. These biases include the anchoring effect, the planning fallacy, and the illusion of control.\n\nHe conducted his research with Amos Tversky but Tversky wasn't eligible to receive the prize because he died in 1996.\n\nKahneman and Tversky's Theory\n\n\"Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk,\" is one of the most frequently cited articles in economics journals. Kahneman and Tversky's award-winning prospect theory shows how people make decisions in uncertain situations.\n\nThey demonstrated that we tend to use irrational guidelines such as perceived fairness and loss aversion. They're based on emotions, attitudes, and memories, not logic. Kahneman and Tversky observed that we expend more effort just to save a few dollars on a small purchase than to save the same amount on a large purchase.\n\nKahneman and Tversky also showed that people use general rules such as representativeness to make judgments that contradict the laws of probability. When given the description of a woman concerned about discrimination and asked if she is more likely to be a bank teller or a bank teller who is a feminist activist, people tend to assume she is the latter even though probability laws tell us she is much more likely to be the former.\n\n3. Asymmetric Information\n\nThe asymmetric information discipline is also known as information failure. It occurs when one party involved in an economic transaction has much more knowledge than the other. This phenomenon typically presents itself when the seller of a good or service possesses greater knowledge than the buyer but the reverse dynamic may also be possible in some cases. Almost all economic transactions involve asymmetric information.\n\nGeorge A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz won the prize \"for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information\" in 2001. The trio showed that economic models that are predicated on perfect information are often misguided because one party often has superior information in a transaction.\n\nUnderstanding information asymmetry has improved our knowledge of how various markets work and the importance of corporate transparency. These concepts have become so widespread that we take them for granted but they were groundbreaking when they were first developed.\n\nAkerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz's Research\n\nAkerlof showed how information asymmetries in the used car market, where sellers know more than buyers about the quality of their vehicles, can create a market with lemons, a concept known as \"adverse selection\". A key publication related to this prize is Akerlof's 1970 journal article, \"The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.\"\n\nSpence's research focused on signaling or how better-informed market participants can transmit information to lesser-informed participants. He showed how job applicants can use educational attainment as a signal to prospective employers about their likely productivity and how corporations can signal their profitability to investors by issuing dividends.\n\nStiglitz showed how insurance companies can learn which customers present a greater risk of incurring high expenses. He called this process screening. Asymmetric information occurs by offering different combinations of deductibles and premiums, according to Stiglitz.\n\n4. Game Theory\n\nThe theory of non-cooperative games is a branch of the analysis of strategic interaction commonly known as game theory. Non-cooperative games are those in which participants make non-binding agreements. Each participant bases his or her decisions on how he or she expects the other participants to behave without knowing how they will actually behave.\n\nThe academy awarded the 1994 prize to John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash Jr., and Reinhard Selten \"for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games.\"\n\nHarsanyi, Nash, and Selten's Analysis\n\nOne of Nash's major contributions was the Nash Equilibrium, a method for predicting the outcome of non-cooperative games based on equilibrium. Nash's 1950 doctoral dissertation, \"Non-Cooperative Games,\" details his theory. The Nash Equilibrium expanded upon earlier research on two-player, zero-sum games.\n\nSelten applied Nash's findings to dynamic strategic interactions and Harsanyi applied them to scenarios with incomplete information to help develop the field of information economics. Their contributions are widely used in economics, such as in the analysis of oligopoly and the theory of industrial organization. They've inspired fields of research.\n\n5. Public Choice Theory\n\nThis theory attempts to provide the rationale behind public decisions. It involves the participation of the general public, elected officials, and political committees, along with the bureaucracy that's set up by society. James M. Buchanan Jr. developed the public choice theory with Gordon Tullock.\n\nJames M. Buchanan Jr. received the prize in 1986 \"for his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.\"\n\nBuchanan's Award-Winning Theory\n\nBuchanan's major contributions to public choice theory bring together insights from political science and economics to explain how public-sector actors such as politicians and bureaucrats make decisions. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, he showed that:\n\nPublic sector actors behave in the public's best interest as public servants.\n\nPoliticians and bureaucrats tend to act in self-interest, the same way private sector actors like consumers and entrepreneurs do.\n\nHe described his theory as \"politics without romance.\" Buchanan laid out his award-winning theory in a book he co-authored with Gordon Tullock in 1962, The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy.\n\nWe can get a better understanding of the incentives that motivate political actors and better predict the results of political decision-making using Buchanan's insights about the political process, human nature, and free markets. We can then design fixed rules that are more likely to lead to desirable outcomes.\n\nInstead of allowing deficit spending which political leaders are motivated to engage in because each program the government funds earns politicians support from a group of voters, we can impose a constitutional restraint on government spending, which benefits the general public by limiting the tax burden.\n\nHonorable Mention: Black-Scholes Theorem\n\nRobert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 Nobel Prize in economics for the Black-Scholes theorem, a key concept in modern financial theory that's commonly used for valuing European options and employee stock options.\n\nThe formula is complicated but investors can use an online options calculator to get its results by inputting an option's strike price, the underlying stock's price, the option's time to expiration, its volatility, and the market's risk-free interest rate. Fischer Black also contributed to the theorem but couldn't receive the prize because he passed away in 1995.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
