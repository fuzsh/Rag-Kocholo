        "text": "With a professional career spanning over twenty-five years, Bill Johnson has forged his niche on stage, screen, and television as a dependable character actor. But he’s got a unique specialty – portraying Bob Hope’s life in comedy with a lookalike and soundalike tribute to the legendary comedian. Bill has performed his tribute to the late, great Bob Hope with the USO across the United States and the South Pacific to rave reviews.\n\nBill also appears regularly at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. When the Museum premiered the film Beyond All Boundaries in their Victory Theater, Bill was honored to introduce NBC-TV broadcast journalist Tom Brokaw, and perform a brief moment of comedy with the film’s Executive Producer, Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks. Bill regularly appears at BB’s Stage Door Canteen (also on the campus of the WWII Museum), starring in a sell-out production of “Thanks for the Memories: Bob Hope and his All-Star Pacific Tour.”\n\nBill has appeared in a wide variety of films, including Ocean’s 11; has been “murdered” on \"CSI\"; and seen in national commercials including ads for McDonald’s. For seven years, Bill performed as the wizard “Stradivarius” in his own show at Caesar’s Magical Empire, inside Caesar’s Palace on the Las Vegas strip.\n\nBill currently lives in Las Vegas, NV.
