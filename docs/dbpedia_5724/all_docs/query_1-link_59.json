        "text": "Editor's note: The following is a guest post by Bethel Church pastor Bill Johnson.\n\nI was told if I voted for Trump I needed to open my bible to find out why it was morally wrong. So I did, and this is what I found.\n\nI found that murder/abortion was wrong, which Clinton approves of even up to the point of delivery. Changing the name from baby to fetus doesn't change reality. It's a baby. A woman has a right to decide what happens to her own body. But all of our rights stop when they violate the rights of another - in this case the unborn. I also found that one of the main biblical purposes of authority is to speak on behalf of those who have no voice. The unborn qualify. They wait silently for someone to stand up and speak. Clinton has refused to do so.\n\nI found that one of the primary responsibilities of the government to protect its citizens. Clinton pulled the protection back from our representatives who were crying out for help at Benghazi. She then deceptively blamed a video on YouTube, knowing it wasn't true.\n\nI found that compassion for aliens (visitors to a nation) is vital, but here again the responsibility to provide safety for its citizens comes first. Open borders violates such a responsibility, creating an impossible task for our law enforcement officers who already live in the daily challenge of risking their lives to provide safety for all enter our borders, citizens or not. We also have a great need to demonstrate compassion to those who are here illegally to come to a redemptive solution where possible. On the other hand, what right do our leaders have of choosing what laws they want to enforce or ignore. By implication that places governmental officials above the law itself. \"Illegal alien\" speaks for itself. If it's a bad law, change it.\n\nI found that honesty is a core value of Gods kingdom and that Clinton violated that value when she deleted hundreds of thousands of emails, some of them classified, and then lied about it to congress and tried to destroy the evidence. Some of the classified emails were given to unclassified people, putting our safety as a nation in jeopardy.\n\nI found that God gives us the ability to make wealth, and that merely giving people money without work can create a lifestyle of dependency that is dangerous for them and our government. The failed liberal agenda espoused by Clinton actually creates the problems they claim to fix. I also found that often times the welfare system masquerades as compassionate when it actually robs people of their much-needed self-esteem gained in their ability to work. Each person has the right to work to create wealth for their families in order to break the cycle of systemic poverty. This is the heart God for every household of every race. The problem won't be fixed by merely throwing money at the problem. But neither will it be fixed without throwing money at the problem. People compassionately helping people is desperately needed. It is also the privileged responsibility of any society to care for those who cannot care for themselves.\n\nI found that redefining the family according to the latest immoral code is in fact cursed by God. Tragically this is a primary focus and value of the Clinton candidacy.\n\nI found that socialism is contrary to Jesus and His teachings. He strongly taught of the importance of giving to the poor. But when he talked about taking from the one person who had one talent (a sum of money) and gave it to the one who had the most, He disqualified himself from being a socialist. Socialism robs people of personal identity and liberty at the expense of national control and power. The liberal agenda, of which Clinton takes center stage, embraces this theme proudly. When government takes from the rich to give to the poor they rob the wealthy of the self-esteem gained from being a part of the solution through compassion. I cannot call it compassion if I take your money and give to someone in need. It's only compassion when I give my own.\n\nI found that the accusations of racism to be serious enough for all Americans to stop and take notice that we might be a part of the solution and not add to the problem. When I looked at Trumps personal staff and the workers in his businesses and I found happy minority workers who were very thankful for their boss. I also found that accusation is a trick of the devil to create fear, thus manipulating peoples decision making process. I found that the devil himself is called the accuser, and that often times good people fall into that trap thinking they are doing the rest of us a good service by creating an evil image of someone when their perception is in itself wrong. Trump was never called a racist until he ran against Clinton.\n\nI found that he who blesses Israel is blessed of the Lord, and that the present liberal agenda has put at risk decades of success with this important ally.\n\nI found that political correctness is nothing new, and that Jesus Himself faced these challenges. He refused to be governed by popular opinion. I found that the fear of man, which is the goal of political correctness, is a stench in the nostrils of God for it removes freedom to think for oneself.\n\nI found that God values each nation uniquely, and that the present move towards globalization is nothing more than a modern Tower of Babel. It is mans efforts towards creating unity through uniformity instead of being free to celebrate diversity both with individuals and nations.\n\nI found that speaking of women in a sexually demeaning way is wrong, as is treating any other human being as a piece of property. It is inexcusable, but not unforgivable. I also found that it is important to forgive people who have asked for forgiveness. Trump acknowledged his error of ten years ago and publicly apologized. I hope that those who judge him for that sin are not also judged for what they did wrong that they have confessed. For what it's worth I often look at the children of an individual to be able to measure what kind of person they really are. Trumps children adore their dad and work for and with him honorably. I want the same for all who read this.\n\nAll elections are tough. This one more so than any other I can remember. And there very legitimate reasons for voting for or against any given candidate. Unfortunately neither Billy Graham or Mother Theresa were running for office. That leaves us with the responsibility to do our best with what we have. And I have done that, with a good conscience. I believe the outcome is from the Lord. At the same time I realize that many people I care for don't see it that way at all. Regardless, my love for God and people remains the same. And as I did for Clinton, Bush, and Obama, I pray for protection for President Trump and his family, that he would have great wisdom for his near impossible assignment, and that he would always listen to godly counsel. I pray that he would increase in favor with God and man. I pray for those who are in despair because of the outcome of this election, that God Himself would give them peace and a hope filled promise. And finally I pray that each of us would have a life of realizing the fulfillment of dreams, with great health and blessing in every area of life."
