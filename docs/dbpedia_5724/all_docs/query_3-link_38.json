The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in Room 334, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Bill Johnson, [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Johnson, Roe, Flores, Donnelly, McNerney, Barrow, Runyan. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BILL JOHNSON Mr. Johnson. The hearing will come to order. I want to thank everyone for coming to today's hearing on the VA's Fiduciary Program. I will say from the outset, we already know that we're going to be interrupted. I apologize for that. We've been told that here within the next five to fifteen minutes votes will be called. At that point, we'll take a brief recess and go take care of that matter, and then reconvene. I would like to ask unanimous consent of the Subcommittee and of the Subcommittee that Chairman Runyan of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs' Subcommittee be allowed to join us today in our meeting. Hearing no objection, so ordered. The Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Congressman McNerney--is also Member of this Subcommittee, and we welcome him in both capacities today. We're here today to have a frank and honest discussion about the problems festering in the VA's fiduciary program. The VA's approximately 95,000 appointed fiduciaries manage over $3 billion in payments made to more than 100,000 of our Nation's veterans and their dependents. In the last several years, the VA has created and implemented its fiduciary hub program. This program aims to streamline the system, and improve processing in fiduciary accountings, but I fear that these recent changes have only addressed a fraction of the problem. This Subcommittee's investigation in the VA's Fiduciary Program revealed that fiduciaries who are doing the right thing are all too often finding it difficult to navigate the maze that makes up the fiduciary program. While numerous honorable fiduciaries serve our veterans, many bad actors exist in the system. We found an instance where the VA arbitrarily removed a veteran's wife from her duties as his fiduciary, after what the VA characterized as ten years of excellent service. She was replaced by a paid fiduciary. VA policy is that they prefer family members and friends to serve as fiduciaries. It is obvious to me that this policy is just lip service and that needs to change. Our investigation also uncovered that the fiduciary program has been plagued by failures in oversight and unwillingness to listen to the veteran. Last week in a hearing before the Full Committee, VA Deputy Secretary Scott Gould stated that the wrong way became the way we've always done it. This mindset seems to have permeated the VA's fiduciary program. This past December, a VA fiduciary and a VA field examiner were convicted in Tennessee for embezzling almost $900,000 from ten veterans' accounts which they oversaw. These felons used some of the stolen funds to pay their own cable and utility bills. Holding its fiduciaries accountable through proper oversight is just one way the VA can take modest steps to improve the system. One of the VA's core values is responsible stewardship of the human and financial resources entrusted to it. The VA needs to work more efficiently and effectively to properly serve those veterans who have fiduciaries. I have seen evidence of veterans, their friends, and family repeatedly notifying the VA of fiduciary misfeasance. And time after time their appeals have been ignored. This needs to stop. Identifying and correcting situations like these is certainly not rocket science. The VA has testified in the past that they are working through the backlog of fiduciary claims. To successfully manage the fiduciary program, the VA must focus not only on those waiting to be assigned a fiduciary, but also on those veterans in the program already. In our first panel, Mr. Dave McLenachen, Director of the VA's Pension and Fiduciary Service and Ms. Diana Rubens, Associate Deputy Under Secretary for Field Operations at the VA will share their thoughts on the state of the fiduciary program. As we will hear from our second panel, the VA is aware of the problems facing those in the fiduciary system. As much as the VA focuses on the positive steps they are taking in the fiduciary program, we are all aware of the other problems they refuse to address. This hearing provides a positive step forward in addressing and resolving these issues. I appreciate everyone's attendance at this hearing, and I now yield to Ranking Member Donnelly for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Bill Johnson appears in the Appendix] OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE DONNELLY, RANKING DEMOCRATIC MEMBER Mr. Donnelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this important hearing. This hearing provides us with an opportunity to learn of the many changes the VA has taken to improve this program, since the Subcommittee on Disability and Memorial Assistance held a hearing last Congress on the VA Fiduciary Program. The VA assures us that it is taking solid steps to fix the problems and weaknesses in the fiduciary program. Other witnesses will suggest that many problems remain. I want to be assured that the VA is improving the program, and has a solid road map to follow as we move forward. The VA Fiduciary Program in place since 1926 is one of the most sensitive programs run by the VA, and one most in need of effective management and oversight. Not only must the needs of beneficiaries come first, but their assets must be protected from fraud and waste. The VA currently oversees approximately 95,000 fiduciaries managing the financial affairs of more than 121,000 beneficiaries. In fiscal year 2011, the VA reports that the Veterans Benefits Administration made payments for compensation and pension benefits of approximately 53.5 billion, while fiduciaries managed approximately 171 million in VA benefits. Since the 2010 hearing, VBA acknowledging that central office oversight of its fiduciary program like priority, announced in November 2011 that they would consolidate fiduciary operations from 56 regional offices into six hubs in six regional offices. The VA informs us the process will convert to a paperless processing environment. These changes should hopefully increase the program's efficiency and accountability. The VA also informs us that it is making progress in coming to grips with the many problems it faces with its fiduciary beneficiary system. One of the major flaws exposed in 2010. I am interested to see where we are in this process, and hope to get a detailed timeline, as to when the VA expects to bring forward a new electronic case management system. I hope the VA and our witnesses can provide insight into the current staffing levels of the VA Fiduciary Program, and whether we might need additional personnel. I also would like to explore the effectiveness of current training efforts in ways this could be improved. I'm interested to hear that VA believes it has fully addressed the recommendations made by the VA, OIG and GAO. I hope we'll have an in-depth discussion of where we have been and where we need to go. The fiduciary program faces many challenges and many problems in improving oversight. We must ensure that while we provide beneficiaries and their families with a meaningful say in the fiduciary process, we must make sure that the needs and interests of our veterans come first. I am pleased the VA is taking steps to improve the fiduciary program, but this Subcommittee wants to make sure these steps represent real progress in fixing these real problems. Mr. Chairman, thank you for bringing this hearing, and I yield back. [The prepared statement of Joe Donnelly appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I've just been notified that votes have been called. So I think at this point, so we can keep continuity to the hearing and stay on focus, we're going to go ahead and recess at this point, and we will come back. I suspect it'll take probably 15 to 20 minutes or so, if I've got my information correct. So the meeting--the hearing will be adjourned for now. We'll reconvene in about 15, 20 minutes. [Recess] Mr. Johnson. This hearing will come to order. I thank those in attendance for indulging us as we took care of our duties to vote. I now recognize Chairman Runyan of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JON RUNYAN Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, and thank you for the opportunity to participate in the hearing today. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorials Affairs, I'm greatly concerned about the current state of the VA's Fiduciary Program. I look forward to working with this Subcommittee on oversight investigation in an effort to serve our Nation's disabled veterans. Improving the VA's Fiduciary Program is essential because it serves a very vulnerable segment of the veterans' population, who are no longer able to take care of themselves. There are approximately 95,000 fiduciaries in the VA system, overseeing accounts of approximately 120,000 veterans. The total value of these accounts is in excess of $3.3 billion. While this overall amount is clearly significant, every individual dollar counts to the veteran who has earned disability investment through his or her service in sacrifice to our country. Mismanagement and little oversight have no place in the administration of these benefits, especially dealing with those that are least able to manage their own affairs. We are here today to hold our VA accountable for its inability to properly serve the veterans who are in most need of the VA's assistance. When the VA fails to provide this assistance, many veterans experience extreme financial hardship. Currently there is evidence that some in the VA system with responsibility for helping our veterans are embezzling funds, being nonresponsive to veterans' needs, and being over compensated for their duties performed. And this is simply unacceptable. The issue in the VA Fiduciary system are further complicated by a backlog of initial appointments. Although the VA has stated that this backlog is due to the rigorous vetting process, there also has been evidence that the VA's noncompliance with its own regulations in ensuring that it appoints responsible trustworthy individuals to assess veterans in this way. The majority of VA regulations concerning these appointments date from 1975 and I would highly encourage the VA to update these regulations immediately. It is my hope that as a result of today's hearing, the process of fixing VA's flawed fiduciary system can begin. I want to commend the Chairman, Chairman Johnson for holding today's hearing. And again, as Chairman of the Disability and Assistance--Disability Assistance and Memorials Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with you in truly serving our American heroes, and thank you, and I yield back. [The prepared statement of Jon Runyan appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. We'll now, without any objection, we'll make Ranking Member McNerney's statement a part of the record. [The prepared statement of Jerry McNerney appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. I now invite the first panel to the witness table. On this panel, we will hear from Dave McLenachen, the VA's Director of the Pension and Fiduciary Service. He is accompanied by Ms. Diana Rubens, the VA's Deputy Under Secretary for Field Operations. Mr. McLenachen, your complete written statement will be made a part of the hearing record, and you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF DAVE MCLENACHEN, DIRECTOR OF PENSION AND FIDUCIARY SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, ACCOMPANIED BY DIANA RUBENS, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY FOR FIELD OPERATIONS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. OPENING STATEMENT OF DAVE MCLENACHEN Mr. McLenachen. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to review the Department of Veterans Affairs Fiduciary Program. I'm accompanied by Ms. Diana Rubens, Deputy Under Secretary for Field Operations. First, I am pleased to report the VA has strengthened its central office oversight of the program, dramatically improved the timeliness of its fiduciary appointments, aligned its staffing with the needs of beneficiaries, and significantly reduced misuse of benefits. The Fiduciary Program appoints and oversees fiduciaries for veterans and other beneficiaries because of injury, disease, or the infirmities of age are unable to manage their financial affairs. The VA currently oversees approximately 95,000 fiduciaries, who provide services to more than 121,000 beneficiaries. In April 2011, VA established a new office to more directly control this program. The new pension and fiduciary service focuses on the unique needs of these beneficiaries, of whom more than 50 percent are in VA's needs-based pension program. The separate service also allows us to strengthen oversight of VA appointed fiduciaries, with dedicated staff responsible for policy, procedures, quality and training. Prior to the establishment of the pension and fiduciary service, VA worked to implement program improvements. These efforts included revising the site visit protocol for field activities, providing on-site training, deploying special assistance teams, strengthening policies and procedures, and enhancing service, delivery and protections. In addition, VA has been responsive to GAO and Inspector General audits of the program. The findings from these audits confirm the VA has improved the fiduciary program. Recommendations from GAO included conducting additional reviews of appointed fiduciaries and evaluating VA's fiduciary hub pilot project. Recommendations from OIG included additional financial reporting requirements for fiduciaries, development of the fiduciary personnel staffing model, and development of Web sites for fiduciaries. All recommended action items were completed and closed. To improve operational efficiencies, VA consolidated 14 of its fiduciary activities at the western area fiduciary hub in Salt Lake City, Utah. Under this hub concept, fiduciary managers deployed their field examination resources, according to the location of beneficiaries within the hub, and without regard to state borders or regional office jurisdiction, while centralizing all other fiduciary functions at the hub. The consolidation improved timeliness of initial fiduciary appointments by 36 percent, and improved quality by 13 percent. It reduced the number of miles traveled per field examination by 6 percent, and the average days to complete initial fiduciary appointments by 26 days. We are planning the deployment of the fiduciary hub concept in five other regions nationwide. In preparation for this deployment, we conducted an in-depth staffing analysis of our fiduciary activities, mapping the physical location of our beneficiaries, and field examiners, to develop a model for the national consolidation plan. The VA will hire 58 additional field examiners and employ them nationwide based upon this model. The VA continues to develop procedures to enhance its efforts, to prevent and identify the misuse of beneficiary funds. We now require fiduciaries to submit detailed financial records with annual accountings. This allows us to verify reported expenditures during the accounting process, and better identify potential misuse of funds. Additionally, under procedures implemented in 2010, our central office staff reviews each misuse determination to ensure accuracy and timeliness of follow-up actions. As a result of these new requirements, the rate of misuse decreased to less than one-tenth of one percent in 2011. VA continues to conduct outreach regarding the fiduciary program. We participate in forums hosted by various agencies, such as the National Guardianship Association, the National Association of Elder Law Attorneys, the National College of Probate Judges, and the American Association of Retired Persons. Outreach efforts include providing education on VA's program, participate in conference discussions, and recruiting qualified fiduciaries. We also organized and led a multi-agency round table with other government agencies to discuss and identify government-wide fiduciary best practices. We established collaborative relationships and developed methods to better serve common beneficiaries. In 2011, the VA further improved its fiduciary training programs for employees and external stakeholders. We conducted centralized training for 115 new legal instrument examiners who review accountings, and maintain follow-up communications with beneficiaries. We also conducted ongoing monthly conference calls with field personnel to ensure consistent dissemination of policy information. Finally, we deployed our first ever Web site for fiduciaries and beneficiaries, which provides tools, references, related links, and information on fiduciary responsibilities. Despite VA's successful implementation of these improvements, challenges do remain. VA continues to work to improve its electronic case management system, the fiduciary beneficiary system, as it poses significant limitations. Thus far, VA has developed a business requirements document for the new system, established a work group to investigate how it should integrate with other VA systems. Mr. Johnson. Sorry, Mr. McLenachen, your time has expired. So the remainder of your testimony will be entered into the record. Mr. McLenachen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dave McLenachen appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. Let's go into questioning. What are the criteria for choosing a fiduciary? Mr. McLenachen. Mr. Chairman, the criteria for selecting a fiduciary is controlled by law. Congress required us when looking to see who should be a fiduciary to check a number of things; criminal history, credit, and with general willingness to act as a fiduciary for a beneficiary. VA's policy, Mr. Chairman, is to always try to select the least restrictive and most effective method of payment for a beneficiary. To do that, the first thing that we do is we look at who does the beneficiary want us to appoint. That's our first step. If we can qualify that person, we will appoint that person. If that person cannot be qualified, we'll look to the person who has the care and custody of the beneficiary. That may be a family member that lives with the beneficiary and provides care, it may be a guardian, that's who we'll look to next. The next step is any other family member or person interested in performing these functions for a beneficiary. Only as a last resort, Mr. Chairman, will we look to a paid fiduciary or a court-appointed fiduciary. That is because we're looking for the least restrictive method. And I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that that is our policy and that's how we carried it out. Just so there's no misunderstanding, currently only about eight percent of the roughly 120,000 beneficiaries pay a commission for fiduciary services. Mr. Johnson. Okay. The CFR states that a commission is only given to a beneficiary when it is necessary to obtain his or her services. Further it states that commission should only be used if the veteran's best interests would be served by the appointment of a qualified professional, or a qualified person. What does qualified mean to the VA? Mr. McLenachen. To us, Mr. Chairman, qualified as I've described means that it's a person that has the interest of the beneficiary in mind, is willing to perform the service, and meets the qualifications that have been prescribed by Congress for us to implement. That is what the regulations are referring to. So if it's an individual who has a criminal history or that has bad credit history, or for some other reason cannot be bonded, that individual will not be appointed as a fiduciary, but that just---- Mr. Johnson. Are there any educational or other qualifications required for--to be classified as a qualified person? Mr. McLenachen. Not at this time, sir. However, one of the first things that I did when I took this job of approximately five months ago, was to initiate a complete review of our current regulations, which Congressman Runyan mentioned during his statement. I think there's a real need to update those regulations. We've reviewed all of those regulations and are currently revising them. That is one issue that I would like to address in our regulations is whether there should be such requirements for fiduciaries. Mr. Johnson. Would it surprise you to know that we have sworn testimony that a VA fiduciary stated that she had approximately one semester of community college education, while she is the appointed fiduciary for 43 veterans, as a single mother, working full-time? Is that--would that be the VA's acceptable criteria for a qualified person? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, I can tell you that with our current regulations, there is nothing to prohibit that fiduciary from serving in that role. Mr. Johnson. In your opinion, would that be a qualified fiduciary? If you're a veteran, a disabled veteran, would you want--is that who you would want to put in charge of your daily care? Mr. McLenachen. It may be, sir, if that's the wishes of the veteran to have that particular fiduciary---- Mr. Johnson. No. This wasn't the wishes of the veteran. I'm talking about the VA appointing someone who's a qualified person, so the veteran has gone to the VA saying, I need a fiduciary. So you go to the VA, and you request a fiduciary, would that be your idea of a qualified person? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, I would like to strengthen the requirements to be a fiduciary. So, in that instance, I think that there should be some more stringent requirements. Mr. Johnson. Okay. How many fiduciaries have the background checks or certifications waived? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, we just recently issued new guidance that affirms our responsibility to check the background. Mr. Johnson. Does the VA waive fiduciary background checks and certifications? Mr. McLenachen. It's not my knowledge that we do. The guidance out there now is to check background in every fiduciary appointment. Mr. Johnson. I hope you're going to stay around for all the testimony today then. Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir. Mr. Johnson. What's the maximum percentage of a veteran's benefit a fiduciary is allowed to keep as a fee for their services? Mr. McLenachen. I'm glad you asked that question, Mr. Chairman, because I think there's a lot of confusion about the payment of commissions. The maximum amount by law is four percent. That's of the annual benefits paid to a beneficiary. And again that's the maximum. We always try to pay--to find a fiduciary who will take less than four percent, but that's four percent of the annual benefits that's paid to a beneficiary. And again, only eight percent of the more than 120,000 beneficiaries pay such a commission. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Would it surprise you to know that we have examples of VA fiduciaries taking five percent of all the veteran's income, as well as others taking five percent of VA disability compensation? And what do you do when you find situations where a fiduciary is taking more? First of all, what kind of auditing process do you have to ensure that you know, that your department knows what fiduciaries are taking, and what do you do when you find someone who's taking more than they should? Mr. McLenachen. Well, sir, the--we do have very stringent requirements that--for detecting that type of abuse. Approximately 30,000 or more than 30,000 accountings are done every year, to include fiduciaries who receive a commission. They're required to submit an annual accounting report, and in addition to that, submit detailed financial records to show all the transactions going in and out of the beneficiary's account. To include the commissions. I'd be very surprised to learn that a fiduciary was in a VA appointment case taking more than four percent. What may be happening is the information you have pertains to a court- appointed fiduciary. In that situation, we recognize often a court-appointed fiduciary and the state courts often authorize more than the four percent that is authorized by Federal law. For that reason, court-appointed fiduciaries are a very last option as far as selecting a fiduciary for a beneficiary. Mr. Johnson. Okay. I'm going to yield now to our Ranking Member for his questions. We'll go to Mr. Barrow, since the Ranking Member is not here. Mr. Barrow. I'd like to pass at this time, Mr. Chairman. I'll ask the question later if I may. Mr. Johnson. Absolutely. The gentleman yields back. I'll go to Dr. Roe. Mr. Roe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Obviously there are situations where veterans are taken advantage of. We certainly understand that, and--but we shouldn't be by the fiduciaries. In Tennessee, there was an example of $900,000 being siphoned off from ten veterans' accounts, and what sort of oversight is there of the fiduciary by VA to prevent this incredibly egregious occurrence? Mr. McLenachen. Congressman, thank you for asking that question because I would like to be able to promise you that there would be no misuse of any benefits at all, and that we could completely eradicate that problem. Unfortunately, that is always going to be a very difficult task. Nonetheless, we have a very, I believe, good story about the oversight that we're currently doing to prevent misuse of funds. In addition to the accountings that I mentioned, which are done on an annual basis, Congress has also authorized us to do on-site reviews of fiduciaries that handle 20 or more beneficiaries. In those cases, we actually go to the fiduciary's site where they conduct their business, and investigate the work that they've been doing for the beneficiaries that they manage. In addition to that, sir, every single beneficiary in this program receives a follow-up field examination. Now, it depends on the circumstances of the beneficiary's case, it may be an annual follow-up field examination, or it may be periodically such as every four years in a case where there's a small amount of benefits paid. But between those three--with those three measures that we take, annual accountings, on-site reviews, and follow-up field examinations, which every single beneficiary gets, we believe we're doing a pretty good job now of detecting misuse of benefits. Mr. Roe. Does a VA fiduciary have the right to act independently of the VA? Or do they act independently of VA? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, are you asking about the fiduciaries? Mr. Roe. I'm asking if a fiduciary does something, they have to go back to the VA, does the VA look at that? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, actually, this is something that I have a little bit of concern about, and I really want to address in the regulations that we're working on. I think one area that we can really improve this program is more clearly defining the responsibilities of the fiduciary and the rights of beneficiaries. I'm admitting to you today that that's an area that we need to address. VA is not the fiduciary. We appoint a fiduciary to act for the beneficiary. Mr. Roe. Independently? Mr. McLenachen. Independently within the guidelines provided by the law, VA regulations and guidance issued by the VA. Mr. Roe. But they're not acting independently? Mr. McLenachen. No, sir. We still do VA oversight. Mr. Roe. That would not be my definition of independent. Mr. McLenachen. There is no---- Mr. Roe. With all these disclaimers. Mr. McLenachen. There's no fiduciary that acts independent of VA oversight, sir. Mr. Roe. Okay. What legal basis for VA--what is the legal basis for VA to ignore valid power of attorney appointing a specific individual of the veteran's choice as attorney-in- fact, fiduciary, or guardian of a veteran's finances? Mr. McLenachen. Let me clarify, sir, that we do not ignore individuals that have power of attorney. In fact, if that's the person that the beneficiary wants to have appointed, that's the first person that we would look to to appoint. Mr. Roe. But isn't that a--haven't you just laid out a catch 22, because if this person isn't competent to do their own finances, then you would assume they wouldn't be competent to appoint who they want as fiduciary, that's why the VA does it. That's kind of a catch 22, isn't it? Mr. McLenachen. No, sir. These individuals are unable to manage their financial affairs. They're not unable or---- Mr. Roe. Who determines that? Mr. McLenachen. Excuse me? Mr. Roe. By the way? Who determines they're incompetent? I know the voters determine we're all incompetent, but who determines that the veteran is incompetent---- Mr. Johnson. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. Roe. I'll yield. Mr. Johnson. Are you speaking for everybody? Mr. Roe. I'm speaking for everybody. Mr. Johnson. Okay. I wanted to make sure you were including all of us. Mr. Roe. I'm including everybody. But who makes that determination? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, actually I'm going to refer you to Ms. Rubens. It's actually her individuals out in the field that have jurisdiction over making those decisions before they're forwarded to the fiduciary activity. Ms. Rubens. Thanks, Dave. Hopefully I can answer this fully. Actually, the rating specialist at the regional office, when they're reviewing the medical records, whether it's an exam or some other indication from medical providers, determine that there perhaps is a reason to believe that the veteran may be incompetent. At that point, if in fact, there's some uncertainty or some conflicting opinions, we will request an opinion to investigate the competence, based on the opinion of the medical provider as to whether or not they're competent to manage their own funds for VA purposes. Once that's done, we'll provide that veteran due process, a notice that that proposal to determine that he or she is incompetent, allowing the veteran to come back in, provide contradictory or clarifying evidence. And at that point, we will make a determination based on that medical evidence that the veteran may be incompetent to handle his or her funds, and begin the process of identifying a fiduciary. Mr. Roe. Okay. I'll yield back. I'll have some other questions later. Mr. Johnson. We will--we'll have multiple rounds of questions, I'm sure. I'll go to Mr. Flores now. Mr. Flores. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Director McLenachen and Deputy Rubens, thank you for joining us today. It appears that you've done some internal studies on your fiduciary processes, and you've also reviewed, you know, thousands of cases of fiduciary work. Under Title 38 CFR 1369 it stipulates that the number of beneficiaries for whom an individual fiduciary may act, will be limited to the number of fiduciary that any--excuse me, the number the fiduciary may reasonably be expected to properly serve. What do your studies tell you based on those--that in your reviews is a reasonable number of persons that a fiduciary can act for? Mr. McLenachen. Let me first say that, just to give you an idea of the scope of work that fiduciaries currently have. You've heard that there's 95,000 fiduciaries that we provide oversight of. 90,000 of those fiduciaries serve one beneficiary. So that's a one-on-one relationship. Of the remaining 5,000, 4,000 of them serve five or fewer beneficiaries. That leaves us 1,000 fiduciaries who actually serve six or more veterans who need fiduciary services. Of those, roughly half are corporate fiduciaries, and the other half are individuals. Now, keep in mind, that for these 1,000 fiduciaries, we're not talking about a single individual who tries to provide services to a hundred or 200 beneficiaries on their own. Rather, these are people that are actually in the business of doing--of providing fiduciary services. So they have full staffs. It may be an accountant that has a full staff of individuals to work on the project. And again, these are the individuals that we go out and we do on-site reviews of, and we get annual accountings regarding their practices. The number of individuals that a particular fiduciary can handle, is controlled by what we see as far as the capabilities of the fiduciary and their performance. If they're performing below the level that we think is appropriate, we will remove them as fiduciaries for certain beneficiaries, and get them down to the level that we think they can do an adequate job. Mr. Flores. Okay. Well, I was a little concerned because I'd heard the comments by Chairman Johnson about 43 beneficiaries under one fiduciary, and 20 from Dr. Roe, and so you're saying we've got a small number of issues. Let me rephrase this, are you telling me we've got a small number of incidents where we have fiduciaries that have too many beneficiaries, or are you going to limit it to a handful or? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, we've got a small number of fiduciaries that handle multiple beneficiaries, a very small number. Mr. Flores. I got that part. Mr. McLenachen. As far as how many a particular fiduciary can handle, again there's no set number in our regulations. There's the criteria that you noted in the regulations which we interpret to mean, they've got to perform adequately to handle the number that they have, and have the capability to do it. And if they don't, we'll remove them as a fiduciary. Mr. Flores. Okay. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I'll go to Mr. Runyan. Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank both of you for being here and your testimony, but my--I think my first question is probably going to go to Ms. Rubens. In the American Legions' written testimony, they've--it cites that the Western Hub Fiduciary Program delayed for a follow-up has went from 120 days to 151 days on average. Are-- is this accurate and are you addressing that issue? Ms. Rubens. Thank you. I would tell you that I don't have the exact number for how long it's taking. I can tell you that as I look at the trend of how quickly we're doing those follow- up or fiduciary beneficiary exams, that that has continued to improve through the end of last fiscal year and into November. We have looked at and are working with Mr. McLenachen, as we identify where do we need to put some additional field examiners out, and we're in the process now of taking our number of field examiners from 350 and adding another 58. Not to a specific geographic location where we're located, but in fact, we have also worked to identify where are our beneficiaries are located, so that we can ensure our ease of access to reach them. We are working diligently to improve each and every outreach and field exam that we do, whether it's an initial appointment or a follow-up exam. Mr. Runyan. I mean, because obviously creating the hub was supposed to increase efficiency, and with their testimony, it's going the wrong direction. And it's unacceptable personally. Ms. Rubens. And I would tell you that as we are looking at the numbers, is that the FEs are at a standard of 120 days, and right now, we're at 116. If we've got some issues in the west, obviously we'll take a look at that and make sure that we're addressing it. I think as we add those 58 field examiners, the goal is, based on where the need is greatest and where we are seeing those beneficiaries residing, to ensure that we're going to have good access to them. Mr. Runyan. Now, kind of addressing--actually what I said in my opening statement, a lot of the--the majority of the regulations concerning fiduciaries haven't been updated since 1975. You've talked a lot about how these--and how you need to do it, and how you're promising to do it. I mean, we need to get this done, because you also say, we have training that we have to do. Well, what standards are we training to? I mean, it's really hard to hold people accountable for things that we have outdated procedures and rules to deal with. Can you tell me where you're at in the process, how close you are to being-- having a solid thing to update your manual? Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir. When I said that we were working on the regulations, I did not imply--mean to imply that we're not currently working on them, or we're going to do it in the future. We are actually drafting regulations right now. So we took a--we brought people together, our staff for a week, to essentially disassemble the current regulations. I couldn't agree with you more that our regulations are out of date and need to be updated immediately. I came from the Office of General Counsel, where I reviewed regulations for the department, I know how to do this, and that's what we're working to get done. As far as timing, I can tell you that the rule-making process is not easy. It's slow, just because of the law that's required, that we're required to follow when we're doing regulations. So these regulations will be complete within the next year to a year and a half, and that's only because of the lengthy process that's required by law. Now, I will say that I've discussed our regulations with Secretary Shinseki, and he assured me that these were among the highest priorities in the department, and he was going to back us on getting them done as quick as possible. And I intend to take him up on that. Mr. Runyan. How long going into that, I know the GAO report of 2010 said you needed to revise them. How long--did we not address that issue before we got to where you're at now? Mr. McLenachen. Well, sir, I can't really comment on what happened before I got to this position. I can tell you that when I first got to this position, I did an assessment on my own, to see what I thought we needed to do, what the highest priority was, and if you talk to any Member of my staff, I'm sure they would tell you that that was the very thing that I identified. Why it took so long to get to this point, I cannot answer that question for you. I can just assure you that we're working on it. Mr. Runyan. I'll wait for the next round of questions and I yield back. Mr. Johnson. Thank the gentleman for yielding back. We'll return now to Ranking Member McNerney for his questions. Mr. McNerney. Good morning. Thank you for testifying this morning. Before I get into sort of the pre-prepared questions, what I'd like to know is what's your--Ms. Rubens, what's your opinion of the overall--well, what's the typical fiduciary? Are they well meaning and well intended and well prepared, or just sort of--what I want to avoid is painting a picture of all the fiduciaries as being bad, because I think most of them are out there doing the best they can with lack of training, and I just want to make sure they get credit before we go into this sort of investigatory phase. Mr. Rubens. Mr. McNerney, I couldn't agree more. I would tell you that as Mr. McLenachen mentioned, 90,000 of our fiduciaries are out there with responsibility for one beneficiary. And I would go beyond that to say that even for folks that are taking care of more than one veteran, largely you are absolutely right. They are doing a terrific job and a great service for the servicemembers and survivors who have come to the point where they're incompetent to handle their funds. And they're doing a terrific job for the most part of ensuring that those benefits that they're receiving are meant to take care of and are, in fact, taking care of our veterans and beneficiaries, absolutely. Mr. McNerney. Thank you for that statement. In your testimony, you mentioned that an analysis of the pilot hub improved initial fiduciary appointments by 36 percent and qualified by 13 percent. How does the VA measure timeliness, and can you elaborate on how the VA quantified quality to claim a 13 percent improvement? Ms. Rubens. Absolutely. We have targets established for how long will it take us to do our initial appointments, to have fiduciaries established. We have timeliness requirements for how long will it take us to do follow-up visits with those fiduciaries. The quality standard is established, and a review is by the National Systematic Technical Advisory Review Staff, and I believe, Dave, your folks are also in Nashville. And they will do a review of a statistically valid sample of the work being completed, and in this case, by the western area hub, and the staff has identified an improvement in that quality of 13 percent. Mr. McNerney. So what this tells me is that the effort then is to continue to improve the quality especially from these sort of home fiduciary people that are caring for relatives or people that they know personally? Ms. Rubens. I would tell you, sir, that it's across the board, that no matter where that fiduciary comes from, it's important to us to ensure that they're doing a good job of administering the veteran or beneficiary funds. Mr. McNerney. And this 13 percent is your way to quantify that improvement? Ms. Rubens. Yes, sir. Mr. McNerney. Okay. Are there outside like the OIG or any other group that's collaborated or validated that improvement? Mr. McLenachen. Not that I'm aware of, sir. However, I want to clarify that in addition to, I believe you're asking about the quality of fiduciary services---- Mr. McNerney. Right. Mr. McLenachen. --the quality measure that we're referring to is the quality of our own staff in doing the functions that Diana's more than 600 people out in the field doing this work, it's their quality that is increasing as a result of the hub consolidation concept. So that's part of the quality measure that we're talking about. Mr. McNerney. Okay. Well, I know that we had--in DAMA, we had a hearing last year on this, and I would like to see next year when we have a hearing, that we have another 13 percent improvement. So that's our challenge is to keep improving this and make sure that--whenever you have a system like this, there's going to be temptation for some people, some bad players, to rip the system off. We want to make sure that we have the tools in place to keep that from happening, and when it does happen, to prosecute. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back, and we'll go into a second round of questioning, and I would like to echo what my colleague Mr. McNerney said. This hearing today is in no way a negative reflection on those fiduciaries that are doing an outstanding job, and that's certainly not the intent. Our responsibility here on the Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigation is, of course, to make sure that all of our veterans, every single one of them, is getting the benefits and the care that they have earned, and therefore, as we dig down into this, we have questions to weed out, as he said, those bad actors. With that being said, I want to go back and kind of spin off of what Congressman Runyan was asking. You were talking about if I recall, that you monitor these fiduciaries and monitor their performance. What kind of metrics do you use to determine how your fiduciary program is working? I think if I heard your testimony right, Ms. Rubens, you did not know how long it's taking to get these claims through. So what are your metrics, how are you reviewing them, and what do you do with the information when you get them, and that's for both of you? Mr. McLenachen. Well, sir, first of all, as far as metrics regarding fiduciary performance, which I think was the first part of your question, those metrics are set up during the field examination that we do in the selection process. The field examiner actually meets with the beneficiary, meets with the prospective fiduciary, discovers what the needs are of the beneficiary, and in discussing that situation of that beneficiary, we come up with a basic picture of what this particular person needs. And that is actually discussed and given to the fiduciary at that point, so that there's an agreement about what this particular person actually needs. When I talked about performance, that's what we're talking about. Is this fiduciary ensuring that the needs of this particular beneficiary are being met. Mr. Johnson. Let me qualify my question. We talked about at least one instance that we know of, of a person who is managing 43 veterans, a single mother working full-time with nothing more than a, one semester of community college background. How--what kind of metrics do you have that would tell you that you've got that kind of situation out there? Mr. McLenachen. As far as telling us that that particular individual has full-time employment, separate from the fiduciary activities she's doing, I'm not aware of any metrics that would identify that for us at this time, that that may---- Mr. Johnson. Do you have any operational metrics that come to you that you review on the fiduciary program, as a part of your operational review? Mr. McLenachen. We do have those metrics that---- Mr. Johnson. What are they? Mr. McLenachen. --we gather at the central office regarding the performance of our fiduciary activities out there, and that information---- Mr. Johnson. Can you provide us with a copy of what those metrics are? Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir. Mr. Johnson. Yeah, I'd like to see that. When was the last time that a fiduciary was removed? I mean, assuming that you're monitoring these operational metrics, and you're monitoring the performance of the fiduciaries, when was the last time a fiduciary was removed because of lack of performance? Mr. McLenachen. Well, sir, I don't have that exact information with me today. Mr. Johnson. Can you provide that to me as well? Mr. McLenachen. I can, sir. Mr. Johnson. What I'd like to see is, I know you said you came to the job five months ago? Mr. McLenachen. Five months ago, yes, sir. Mr. Johnson. I'd like to see if you could provide that for the last three years. Mr. McLenachen. Okay. Mr. Johnson. I'd like to see how many fiduciaries have been removed as a result of performance related issues and the dates that that occurred. Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir, we'll provide you that. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Has VA upgraded or replaced the fiduciary benefit system in order to provide an electronic interface for external entities that includes inputting and processing of income and expense related transactions? Mr. McLenachen. Mr. Chairman, it has not been replaced yet. However, I'm--I can report that a decision has been made to replace it. We have a business requirements document that states exactly what the new system is going to look like. It's been planned. And we have a weekly work group that is looking at how we are going to integrate this new system. As you know, we're also developing other systems in the VA as we're continuing---- Mr. Johnson. Well, I'm well aware of that. Mr. McLenachen. Yes. Mr. Johnson. Information technology and business systems applications are another very important area that we're interested in. Mr. McLenachen. This--the fiduciary beneficiary system provides us kind of a unique challenge because as you may know, it's a stove pipe system that exists outside of VBA's corporate database. And so the challenge we have is as we're developing these other new systems, we need to make this external system integrate into those systems. We need to remove the data from the Legacy system, and plug it into the new system that's being developed. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Mr. McLenachen. And we're currently working on that. Mr. Johnson. According to your testimony, VA's outreach efforts are for qualified fiduciaries, and yet you also stated that fiduciary personnel should be trained to a centralized environment, using a standard curriculum. So if fiduciaries are already qualified, what would VA be schooling them on? Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir. Actually the reference to training being centralized is for VA's fiduciary personnel, not for the fiduciaries themselves. So what I was suggesting in my testimony was, we can do a lot better job of training our own personnel to make sure that we're providing state of the art customer service for these vulnerable beneficiaries, that's what I was referring to. Mr. Johnson. Okay. In your written testimony, you mentioned round tables that VA, the Social Security Administration, OPM and DFAS have participated in. Why is there such a disparity between the Social Security Administration's fiduciary program and VA's? Mr. McLenachen. Well, I think there's two factors there. One is there is a different body of law that pertains to each, they have their own unique criteria and are substantially different. But in addition to that, the social security system is enormous compared to the fiduciary system that VA runs. Although I believe that we're the second biggest such program in the government, nonetheless, the Social Security Administration's payee program is much, much larger than VA's which poses its own problems. Mr. Johnson. Okay. How is the VA--how are you strengthening the oversight of the fiduciary program? Who oversees the field examiners? I think that's in your area, Ms. Rubens. And how much oversight occurs, and I'm going back to that operational metric review? How does that process work? Ms. Rubens. Yes, sir. I would tell you that we are strengthening the program, and I think that it's in two arenas. One, as you've heard Mr. McLenachen talk about, the standing up of the pension and fiduciary service in November, will provide us a number of things for the folks in the field that are implementing the guidance and the regulations. It's that more consistent oversight from headquarters, in terms of devising guidance. It's also, as he talks about the Federal beneficiary system, helping us build new tools. It's identifying things. For instance, in the Salt Lake City Hub, they identified mapping programs to help them be more efficient in how they go out and make our visits to our fiduciaries. And I would tell you that I think the hub program in itself, reorganizing the infrastructure, sir, in the field, will make a tremendous difference in two ways. One, is that we now will look to consolidate our legal instruments' examiners, who are actually doing the accountings and reviewing the information provided by the fiduciaries. We're ensuring there's a more consistent review. But also frankly, sir, while they were distributed among the regional offices, the number of legal instruments' examiners at one legal office might be one, two, or three, or in a large office, you might get up to six or ten, which meant you could find yourself with, I'll say, a shortage of personnel if somebody were to get a promotion, leave the job, retire, what have you. By consolidating into the hubs, we are going to aggregate that accounting review expertise. We are also then going to ensure that the oversight for our field examiners takes advantage of the fact that they are provided direction and oversight from fewer responsible supervisors. This also take advantage of the fact that jurisdictional lines that may have been an issue when they were out there by regional office are no longer an issue. So we can ensure the most effective and most efficient means to get out and do those field exams. Our timeframes for doing an initial appointment are set at hitting those at 45 days. That's a record that we monitor. We're currently at about 51, which is not where we want to be. With 58 additional field examiners, we expect that we're going to make a tremendous difference there. For the review of exams by the field examiner, we have a target of 120 days and are at 116 days. We think that we've got some room; we can continue to improve, but we're hitting our target. And there is a time frame for making sure that we're getting the accounting work in, looking to ensure that those accountings are coming in for our review. We agree that while most of our fiduciaries are doing a terrific job, it's still our responsibility to look for those anomalies and to look for those bad actors that you referred to. Mr. Johnson. Okay. All right. Back to Mr. McLenachen. You've been in your job for five months, and I certainly sense, you know, a desire and motivation to make this program effective, and I appreciate that. In your testimony, you said that the VA has initiated a complete review and revision of all regulations and procedure manuals pertaining to fiduciary matters. When was this review initiated? Mr. McLenachen. Sir, I started in this position in August, and I believe it was the beginning of September where I first started discussing with my Assistant Director, Gary Chesterton, that we initiate that process. I've had people working on that full-time since that--since early September. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Are you aware that in early 2010, the VA stated that a new fiduciary policy was to be published in September of 2010, and that to date, no specific policy has-- that has not happened, and the policy is still, as far as we know, is still dated 2005, and a revision has not been released. Are you aware of that? Mr. McLenachen. Mr. Chairman, based on that information, I cannot answer the question. If you could narrow it down to a specific policy, I might be able to provide you an answer. Mr. Johnson. Yeah, I would certainly like to see that, because September of 2010 has long come and gone. I concur with Congressman Runyan's assessment, this is not rocket science. Why it's taking so long to get these policies and regulations reviewed and put in place, is a little bit concerning to me. Mr. McLenachen. Mr. Chairman, being in this position for five months, I haven't yet had an opportunity to sit down and meet with your staff, and I'm available to do that at any time if you would like to arrange that. Mr. Johnson. Okay. All right. Thank you. At this time, I yield to Ranking Member McNerney, if he has any follow-up questions. Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, you asked one of my questions, so I'm a little blank here. But I'd like to follow-up with a remark that you made earlier, Ms. Rubens, that the--and I just want to clarify it. You said that the quality is measured by the staff performance, not by the actual benefits disbursement. Could you clarify that a little bit? Ms. Rubens. Absolutely. The quality review that's done by our headquarters quality review staff in Nashville is really to look at how we in the field are carrying out our responsibilities from a review of the accountings, ensure that we get our field exams done, whether they're initial or follow- up. They ensure that as we conduct those field exams, we are following the prescribed guidance. Those two things are really meant to help us ensure that if there is a concern, a problem with how the fiduciaries disbursing the funds, that that's brought to light. If we're identifying those things, we are pursuing that and ensuring that if, in fact, that fiduciary is misusing the money, that appropriate action is taken. As the STAR review staff, the quality reviewers, and headquarters review our work, it's to ensure that we are meeting our requirements to identify those kinds of situations. Mr. McNerney. So it sounds like you believe and feel that it's not only a measure of the quality of your staff's performance, but also of how the benefits are being disbursed? Ms. Rubens. It is our effort to ensure that the disbursement of those funds is being made in accordance with the guidance that we've got, yes, sir. Mr. McNerney. Okay. In your testimony, you state that the-- you've reviewed the pilot's program strengths and weaknesses. Do you have an assessment of the weaknesses? You've talked about the strengths, but you haven't discussed the weaknesses. Ms. Rubens. I would tell you that as we look at the pilot opportunities to ensure that we've got enough field examiners out there to meet the needs. Ensuring that we've got good supervision in the right places and doing oversight with those field examiners as well as the accountants, these are things on which we continue to work with Mr. McLenachen. As the P&F service has stood up, I think it's been one of the best things that we've done for our incompetent veterans to ensure we've got the right guidance and the right oversight. Dave and I have worked very closely together to make sure that we're meeting those needs. Mr. McNerney. Okay. I'm going to yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. Dr. Roe. Mr. Roe. Just a couple of--thanks, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. Just a couple of questions. What sort of a contract does a fiduciary sign with the VA, when you're accepted as a fiduciary, and that's your job? Mr. McLenachen. Well, sir, there is no contract that's signed. There is a document that we call a fiduciary agreement, which is really just a informing the fiduciary of their responsibilities, the specific needs of this particular beneficiary. So that document does exist, and it is signed by the fiduciary and provided to us. It's essentially a way for us to inform the fiduciary of what this particular needs--what the particular needs of this particular beneficiary are. But this goes back to the point that I was mentioning an area that we really need to strengthen is the role of the fiduciary in this program, and something I intend to work on. And that is, that the fiduciary holds an obligation to the beneficiary. That is where the fiduciary relationship is, and that's the one thing that we really--one of the things that we really need to strengthen and clarify. Mr. Roe. I'm glad to hear you say that, because if--do they sign this document, does it obligate them to check with VA before they release these funds, or to be looked at by VA before they can be released? Mr. McLenachen. The current policy, sir, is that if an expenditure is going to exceed a thousand dollars, an unusual, a nonrecurring expenditure of that amount is going to be made, per current policy is that there does have to be a check with the fiduciary activity, that's correct. Mr. Roe. So in Tennessee, where this $900,000 was embezzled, that didn't happen obviously, unless they took it out of, a buck at a time? Mr. McLenachen. Unfortunately, sir, I cannot comment about that specific case, the facts of that case, and I cannot tell you whether there was a lack of oversight or not. It may have been discovered---- Mr. Roe. Well, it obviously was if $900,000 got embezzled. Mr. McLenachen. Yeah. Eventually it was discovered, and there's--thankfully Congress has a law in place that we've implemented that allows us to reissue benefits in those cases, and of course, those matters are referred to the Inspector General for prosecution. Mr. Roe. I guess just one last question, Mr. Chairman, briefly, and this one bothers me a little bit, because what legal basis is there for VA, the Veterans Administration, to ignore a state court order of guardianship? If a state court, a judge in a court of Tennessee says, you can be--this is a legal guardianship, how can the VA just ignore that, and they have? Mr. McLenachen. Well, sir, we have a body of Federal law that requires us and authorizes us to run this program. That law is supreme. And we have developed policy that we believe best suits the needs of these veterans, with the exception---- Mr. Roe. So that--back up right there just a second. So what you're saying is, and I'm not directing this at you, but I'm directing it globally. Mr. McLenachen. Sure. Mr. Roe. That sounds pretty arrogant to me, to think that a judge in a hometown that knows my folks better than anybody up at Webber Wood, is now being told that no, you can't be a guardian. This is a judge that may know the family, they may know the circumstances in Surgoinsville, Tennessee, a lot better than anybody at the VA would ever know it. Mr. McLenachen. Mr. Congressman, let me clarify my statement just a little bit. If that guardian, which has been appointed by the Court, is the individual that this beneficiary wants appointed, then yes, we're going to seek to appoint that person if that's who they want. If it's not who they want, and there's an exorbitant fee being charged by that guardianship created in the state court, we are going to determine whether that's in the best interests of that beneficiary. I don't know whether you're aware of this, but the fees often exceed by far the four percent authorized by Congress for this fiduciary program. In many cases, and for that reason, we only appoint approximately eight percent--eight percent of our fiduciaries are court appointed guardians. So we've determined that in most cases, it is not in the best interests of a beneficiary to have a state appointed fiduciary. Now, that does not mean that we're not recognizing state appointed guardians who are family members, or the person that the beneficiary wants. Mr. Roe. So you're telling me now on the record, that the VA, and I don't know this has or hadn't happened, has had a veteran who said, yeah, this is fine with me, this will be fine, the VA hadn't overruled that? Mr. McLenachen. I'm sorry, sir. Could you restate the question? Mr. Roe. Yeah. We've had the state court, the judge, the local judge has said, this will be--this is a guardianship and this person is the guardian. And the veteran says that, yeah, this is okay with me, the VA's never counteracted that? Mr. McLenachen. That is not my testimony. We often appoint--in eight percent of our fiduciary cases we appoint---- Mr. Roe. Now, back up. That's what you said. You said if the veteran wanted it, and the state court said it was okay, then it was okay. I think that's what you said. Mr. McLenachen. Yes. If the person that the beneficiary wants as their fiduciary is a state appointed guardian, that is the first person that we're going to look at to qualify. Mr. Roe. Okay. And you've never--and the VA's never gone and said, no, that's not adequate? Mr. McLenachen. I do not have that information with me, no. Mr. Roe. I'll yield back. Mr. Johnson. Thank you. I think we'd like to see that if you could look into that and tell us whether or not that has occurred. Mr. Flores. Mr. Flores. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of questions. As you're going through this regulatory rewrite and overhaul process, a couple of questions on the statutory side. Are there any limitations under current statutes that are preventing you from being able to write all the regulations that you need, or to overhaul the regulations in a manner to make this work better? Mr. McLenachen. Congressman, at this time, I do not believe that we need additional authority. I think our authority is sufficient to allow us to write the regulations that we need. Mr. Flores. Okay. So I think that answered my second question, too. And that is, do you--is there any legislative fix that you need in order to be able to complete this regulatory rewrite? Mr. McLenachen. One of the things that we have been recently asked is whether we have legislative proposals to develop within the department, and we intend to take a look at the statutes, to see if we can make some recommendations for you that we think might improve the program. Mr. Flores. Okay. Well, that would be good, if you can get those to us as soon as you get to that point, that would be helpful. Mr. McLenachen. We will. Mr. Flores. I mean, we'd like to work together on this---- Mr. McLenachen. Yes. Mr. Flores. --so that we take--do what our charge is, and that's to take care of our Nation's vets. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Runyan? Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Chairman. And continuing on the theme of rewriting some of these regs. Our Uniform Probate Code which serves as a standardized and modernized all areas of probate law was not widely adopted until after the VA had adopted its current regulations. And Uniform Probate Code was recently updated in `06. Will the VA take up the Probate Code, Article 5, Part 5, which concerns durable power of attorney into consideration in updating your regulations? Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir. In reviewing our regulations, we looked at a number of different sources of modifications that we could make, including those, the Social Security Administration regulations, and any other regulations existing that we could find that might be helpful to us for informing us about a better way to do what we're charged with doing. So, yes, we have looked at those. Mr. Runyan. And are there any guidelines for fiduciaries or field managers to follow when it comes to emergency requests? Mr. McLenachen. Yes. We have procedures in place for appointing temporary fiduciaries. Just last night, we got a call regarding a specific case regarding a terminal veteran where those exact procedures needed to be invoked. So we do have those procedures in place. Mr. Runyan. It's working? Mr. McLenachen. Yes, sir, it is. Mr. Runyan. And are you also looking to update any of them to make sure you can work any bugs out of it? Mr. McLenachen. Those will be included in the regulations that we're working on, yes. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Johnson. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I have no further questions. Any other Members have questions? Well, our thanks to the panel, and you are now excused. Our second panel we will hear from today consists of Doug Rosinski and Katrina Eagle, Veterans Law Attorneys, Pam Estes, who serves as the fiduciary for her son, Jason, an OEF, OIF veteran, and Rick Weidman, Executive Director for Policy and Government Affairs at Veterans of America. Mr. Rosinski, Ms. Eagle, Ms. Estes, and Mr. Weidman, your complete written statements will be made part of the hearing record. Mr. Rosinski, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENTS OF DOUG ROSINSKI, ESQUIRE; LAW OFFICE OF DOUGLAS J. ROSINSKI, ESQUIRE; KATRINA EAGLE, ESQUIRE; THE VETERANS LAW OFFICE OF MICHAEL WILDHABER, LLP; PAM ESTES, VETERAN FIDUCIARY; RICK WEIDMAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR POLICY & GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA. STATEMENT BY DOUG ROSINSKI Mr. Rosinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Members of the Subcommittee. I want to also join your statements. This is not about the vast majority of fiduciaries who are struggling to do the best for their veterans. This is about primarily the veteran--the Department of Veterans Affairs' individuals. This is not about VA money, this is about the veterans' money. Every dollar we're talking about today has already been awarded and provided to the veteran. VA is spending the veteran's money at a rate--for the veterans that I represent, at approximately $600 an hour to write a single check a month. They get $108 and change at four percent for a hundred percent benefit, that's $108 to write one check a month. These metrics that you've been talking about are misleading. They are metrics about policies and procedures. We are talking about people who live day-to-day, dollar-to-dollar, who have to beg the VA fiduciary because of the policies to buy new underwear for a Korean War veteran. They're about policies and procedures that require and instruct these fiduciaries to not contact the veteran, to not answer a veteran, to not respond to their counsel. So when you measure how many meetings they have, how long it takes to meet with a veteran, how many days it takes to cash a check has nothing to do with what goes on in the field day- to-day. What my clients want to know is why, when they are living at home, or under supervised care, their veteran suddenly has to have a VA fiduciary at all. My veterans have had decades of family members giving them care, and handling their benefits without VA interruption. Suddenly VA appoints a perfect stranger, perfectly unknown to the veteran, who has never contacted the veteran, who will not ever contact the veteran, and is paid money from the veteran's account to withhold the money from the veteran, to place it in bank accounts that they will not disclose to the veteran, and that they will not even disclose under FOIA. They will redact the veteran's own information about his own money from the files they give up. My clients want to know why that if there is a need for a VA appointed fiduciary, it has to be this stranger. They want to know why this stranger is told to take all of the veteran's finances, all of his bank accounts, and ask questions about his CDs and his--whether he owns a boat, and what his wife's salary is, and where is that salary put, and then go into the banks and take all of it and not tell them where it is. They want to know why VA not only will not correct that, when I've had personal discussions with Members or people sitting in this hearing today, and then they will not fix that problem. They want to know why VA defends those practices at every turn in every court in every discussion. This is not about numbers and procedures and policies. My clients don't care about policies and procedures. They want to know why they have $100,000 in the bank and they cannot afford the medicine that the VA doctors prescribed last month. They want to know why the power company is in the front yard, when they have $50,000 in the bank, and it takes an emergency motion to the Veterans Court before these people will call a power company and tell them they'll pay $178. That's what my clients would like to hear today. And I did not hear any of that by the prior panel. I thank you for the time, and yield back the rest of my time. [The prepared statement of Douglas J. Rosinski appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Rosinski. Ms. Eagle, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF KATRINA J. EAGLE Ms. Eagle. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, thank you very much for having me this morning. I want to use my five minutes to address some of the fundamental misunderstandings. First of all, let me be very clear. A finding of incompetency by the VA applies only to their managing of their VA money. There is no catch 22. They can enter contracts. That finding of incompetency applies only to their being able to manage their VA money. So with respect to having durable powers of attorney and being able to enter into those, they are perfectly fine. The VA has no finding with incompetency. It does not reach that far. The second basic fundamental misunderstanding, is the law that applies to the fiduciary program. That law states very clearly that the Secretary may find, when it is in the veteran's best interest, may appoint a fiduciary. And before they appoint a fiduciary, that law makes it very clear that the money can still go directly to the veteran. It can go supervised direct pay. VA's own forms list the veteran as receiving his own money even after being found incompetent. The fiduciary is the last person. So that with respect to the VA form direct payment of the beneficiary, that was not the intent of Congress when they created the fiduciary program. And, in fact, even since the Freeman decision, made challenges to the fiduciary appointments available to veterans. Just in December 6th, 2011, the VA's most recent VA FAS letter emphasizes another basic misunderstanding. That letter makes very clear one sentence sums it all up. The purpose of the VA Fiduciary Program is to protect the benefits paid to the beneficiaries. No. I submit to you the purpose of the program is to protect the veteran. It is his money, not the VA's. The VA treats it as if it is theirs. Another basic misunderstanding is how this process actually works. Ms. Ruben's identified very clearly, when a veteran is proposed to be found incompetent, there are due process systems in place. That veteran can appeal. While that appeal process with respect to the finding of incompetency is ongoing, nothing happens. The moment incompetency attaches to the veteran, however, everything else changes. A fiduciary is appointed, the same day his direct deposit VA money is stopped and changed and diverted to another account with which the veteran has no knowledge, did not approve, and is now getting four percent of that money taken out and paid to someone else he does not know, has not met. That same money that is the veteran's, is then used, without his permission, without his authority, for a surety bond. The veteran gets to pay for his own money to be protected from him. Before the veteran is asked or even let allowed to try and use his own money, even though found incompetent. We have in this country, you are innocent until proven guilty, but in the VA system, once you are found incompetent, you can't even be trusted or given a chance to use your own money. They assume you can't, and put somebody else, be it a spouse, a family member, or a paid fiduciary before the veteran himself is given an opportunity to show that he can still do it, even with being found incompetent. The last thing that I would like you to make sure you understand is that the strict control of the money, while we discuss policies are being changed, while we discuss regulations are being reviewed and changed, every day a veteran has a need, daily lives, life goes on, and they have needs to access of their money. If they call their fiduciary and in the best of circumstances, weeks go by while they fax in this request to the fiduciary hub in Salt Lake City or anywhere else, and they have to wait weeks to get approval, if they get approval for an air conditioner, for underwear, for heart medication, they have to wait. While they wait, what do they do? They use credit cards, they get fees charged to them because they have to find other means to pay for things that they need today. The system is not working. I appreciate your time. I appreciate sincerely on behalf of veterans that I work with, you're looking into this entire program. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Katrina J. Eagle appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. I thank you for your comments, Ms. Estes, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF PAM ESTES Ms. Estes. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Donnelly, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify at the VA's Fiduciary Program and for holding this hearing. My name is Pam Estes. My life and my family's life changed overnight in December of 2005 when my son sustained multiple severe injuries, including severe traumatic brain injury, multiple leg fractures, a lower leg amputation, and second and third degree burns to over 60 percent of his body, as a result of an IED blast in Iraq. At the time of his injury, Jason was only 19 years old. Since then, my husband, Mike, and I have been caregivers for Jason. I was appointed to serve as a fiduciary in 2007 as he was not able to manage his financial affairs. As both a fiduciary for my son and as a caregiver, I have extensive experience in working with the Department of Veterans Affairs. In fact, I served for two years as a Member of a VA Advisory Committee, on OEF, OIF veterans and families established by former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jim Nicholson. As a result, I have a good understanding of the department and its programs. But my experience of dealing with the Veterans Benefits Administration as it relates to Jason's VA compensation contrasts sharply with the experience of working with the Veterans Health Administration as it relates to my son's care and to the administration of the VA Caregiver Assistance Program established by Congress. One of the very positive experience with the VHA, particularly in coordinating effectively with its case managers surrounding Jason's care, my experience as a fiduciary and me not even understanding VBA's requirements, has been disturbing. I certainly understand that VBA has an important responsibility as it relates to safeguarding the benefits of veterans who are unable to manage their own affairs. While this fiduciary program unquestionably has an important mission, my own experience and that of other caregivers of wounded warriors, leave me to question how effectively the program is managed. Among the frustrations I've encountered in serving as a fiduciary has been the lack of information as to precisely what VBA needed and expected, and the mixed signals it sent. Despite a lack of guidance, I maintain detailed documentation of expenditures for Jason, consistent with my background in accounting. But I was stunned in 2008, when despite the lack of detailed VBA instructions, I received a letter from the VA regional office in Baltimore, which cited my failure to submit your timely accounting is outstanding, constituting a breach of your fiduciary duty, and threatened to remove me as fiduciary. I find it extremely offensive to be painted as irresponsible when we've been working so hard to do what's best for Jason, including saving much of his money for the future, when we're not there to care for him. Following up on that letter, I ultimately met with a VA field auditor in September of 2008, and explained that I'd never received instructions about requirements for annual accounting or applicable forms. I was relieved that the official accepted my detailed documentation, and advised me that no further action was needed. Yet, less than a year later, I received another letter from the VA regional office officials stating that I was delinquent, and this time, directing me to submit a VA form within 14 days, an accounting of all expenditures for Jason going back to 2007. This letter again threatened that I risked being removed as fiduciary. The VARO official's letter also responded to an earlier letter of mine explaining that I had never received instructions on how to file an annual accounting to VBA, and stated that in an ideal world, each year the computer would print you a letter, and we would send you the letter and blank forms prior to your accounting date. It's supposed to work that way, but in real life, it doesn't. VBA's fourteen-day reporting or else directive prompted us to contact the Wounded Warrior Project who brought this situation to the attention of the VBA central office officials and requested a meeting. My husband and I subsequently met with these officials who were deeply apologetic. The meeting was instrumental in resolving the immediate problem, and we assumed accordingly that we would encounter no future difficulties, but we were mistaken. For the 2011 accounting period, I received a message from the supervisory official in Baltimore indicating that I was subject to a field audit this year. After back and forth messages, the visit had still not been scheduled, and still hasn't been. Fearing another delinquency, I submitted my annual accounting on December 5th of 2011, and further sought to clarify VA policy regarding certain charges to be entered on that form. In a follow-up letter--in a follow-up to the letter, I called and left messages, but received no response. On January 9th, however, I was shocked to receive a letter stating that I was delinquent again in submitting the required accounting, and threatening to remove me as Jason's fiduciary if I did not comply within 30 days. Today's 30 days, so I'm sure I'll get another letter. From the perspective of a mother of a very severely wounded warrior, VBA communications like this suggesting that with the stroke of a pen, I could be deemed unqualified and lose the right to manage my son's finances are terribly stressful. Despite my being a loving caregiver, the program operates in a manner that leaves me feeling as though something threatening is always hanging over my head. Given that that's been my experience, imagine what this process might be like for a young spouse, without my background and recordkeeping, let alone my years working in accounting. I understand the need for methodical recordkeeping and reporting and the interest of documenting appropriate financial management of Jason's compensation, but I do not understand an agency that is so quick to threaten, so unresponsive to questions, so much of a black hole. Nor do I understand why VBA cannot better align its reporting requirements with a much less detailed and less burdensome level, a reporting used by the Social Security Administration. Some two and a half years ago, my husband, Mike, attended a caregiver summit here in Washington sponsored by Wounded Warriors. One of the most common and deeply felt concerns expressed by the caregiver participants was with the VA Fiduciary Program. Which many participants described in some details as confusing, demeaning, highly intrusive, and often unreasonable, and disallowing expenditures. The then Director of VA's Compensation and Pension Service attended the session of the conference, and on hearing a presentation of these problems, promised fiduciary program reforms. But it's not apparent to me that such reforms have taken place, or if any steps were taken, that they really have taken hold. On behalf of the many other caregivers who as fiduciaries for their loved ones, have had experiences like mine, I hope this morning's hearing can help achieve such changes. [The prepared statement of Pam Estes appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Ms. Estes. Mr. Weidman, you are now recognized for five minutes. STATEMENT OF RICK WEIDMAN Mr. Weidman. Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing us to present our views here today. And thank you moreover for having this hearing. Going back to at least 2006, it seems like the only time we make progress and fits and starts, is when there's a hearing coming up. So I guess we should have more hearings, maybe we'd keep that progress going. But hopefully, this time it's going to take. The first thing about this program is that there's big bucks involved, and any time there are big bucks involved, you better make sure that you have all of your safeguards in place. And that's the first thing, point I want to make. The second point is, it's not a financial program. It is an extension of a clinical program, and that's a fundamental misunderstanding of this program. If this individual, and the former age, 60 years ago, many of these veterans would be in a long-term care facility, but they don't exist anymore at VA. And therefore, they're living independently. So at nowhere in this, has anybody talked about, is this person eating correctly, do they have access to proper nutrition, do they--is their shelter warm, do they have warm clothes for the winter time, do they have an air conditioner, et cetera. It's all an extension, if you will. What we should be concerned with is a medical model and hopefully people getting better. The third point I wanted to make is, this is a drastic step to take to infantialize, if you will, a person who had taken that step forward, pledging life and limb in defense of the Constitution, and therefore has been lessened by virtue of that service. And it should be rare. There are a lot of things today that in terms of doing financial literacy classes at each medical center or CBOC or somewhere available in the community, putting the individual's bills on--that are recurrent on automatic pay for him or her, and many things short of taking away their money to make decisions at least on anything, and giving it to a stranger, as you've heard here before. There should be, and in our view, never a case where there's a percentage of retroactive benefits that are paid to the individual, and a fiduciary takes a percentage. This happens though. There are two recent cases that we know of. One that where Katrina is an attorney, and another with our folks in New Jersey. Where there was a large settlement, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, and without the knowledge of the veteran, he was--a fiduciary was appointed, and a huge chunk of this was given to a person the veteran had never met. This doesn't make any sense. They should be recompensed for services rendered. And the best model is to think about what you all have done here in this Committee in passing caregiver legislation. Which makes a great deal of sense. Where there are a certification, and it's based on care provided that is an extension of the medical system. Yes, you need to pay the bills on time, but a lot of that can be taken care of by computerization and automation of the accounts today. And our real concern should be the welfare of this individual, number one. And number two, if you have to take that drastic step now, what is being done to help that person get better and get away from, get out of the fiduciary program, and return to full autonomy. And nobody talks about that. There aren't any clear procedures for getting out of the fiduciary program once you're stuck in. And this becomes a catch 22, almost like a hundred years ago, that if you got stuck in the state hospital, you couldn't get out, you couldn't get out. It was assumed that anything you said that you were nuts, and therefore, you were stuck in all of your basic rights under the Constitution of the United States would be taken away. Well, these are folks who put their lives on the line in defense of the Constitution. And if they want their full rights restored in terms of autonomy, then there should be a clear way to exit the program. And there is apparently now a move to rethink things, and I was glad to hear the first panel talk about that. I must tell you that they have not contacted anybody in the veteran's service organizations. They haven't contacted Committee staff, they haven't contacted Committee Members, and exactly who are they going to talk to, to rectify some of the problems that we have identified that they seem to be blissfully unaware of. My guess is that those discussions on the new regulations don't include any interface with people on the Veteran's Health Administration side, and they need to. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for--once again for this opportunity to appear, and I'd be glad to answer any questions, sir. [The prepared statement of Rick Weidman appears in the Appendix] Mr. Johnson. I thank you all for your statements. Let's go directly into questioning. Mr. Rosinski, in your experience, what is the significance of VA's Form 21-4703 when it comes to fiduciary authority? Mr. Rosinski. Mr. Chairman, that's one of the roots of the problem here. You talked about it briefly in the previous panel. But essentially, that is a contract. That is the--those are the rules for this fiduciary, and I always put quotes around fiduciary when it's and/or qualified as a VA appointed fiduciary. One of the key points here is this is not a fiduciary. These people are agents of VA, and this form establishes that. There's various versions of this form in the files of fiduciaries, but it explicitly requires that this VA appointed fiduciary only do what VA authorizes. And---- Mr. Johnson. Okay. So that's basically the contract between the VA and the fiduciary? Mr. Rosinski. Yes, sir. And it is---- Mr. Johnson. And their responsibility for the veteran. Mr. Rosinski. And it is--and if you read it, they have no responsibility for the veteran. They only do what the VA says. Mr. Johnson. Yeah, we're going to get into that. I apologize for cutting you off, but for the sake of time, we're going to try to keep our answers short, so we can get through all of these questions, because there are some very, very important ones here. So please don't be offended if I move us along. Ms. Eagle, if VA is paying a fiduciary a percentage of a veteran's compensation, only to allow VA to have the final say, then why pay a fiduciary in the first place? Ms. Eagle. I have many veterans and clients who ask that very same question. I don't understand it myself. I find it ironic that I have several cases where the veteran is paid also, excuse me, his social security benefits, and he has no fiduciary managing his social security benefits, but the VA finds fit that he must be appointed a fiduciary for his VA benefits, which also then gets sucked into including his social security benefits. Moreover, as Mr. Weidman was saying, with respect to veterans who try to get out of the program, I've seen many instances of retribution, so to speak, in that when the veteran applies to get out of the fiduciary program, he is then found perfectly fine with his medical condition, the underlying medical condition be it physical or often times a psychiatric condition, and therefore he is reduced. And that is encouraging the veteran to say nothing, go along, and not question or cause problems. Mr. Johnson. And I want to read this paragraph for everyone's attention out of that form we're discussing. It says, approval for VA use of--``Approval for use of VA funds,'' and this is the 21-4703 that we're discussing. ``VA must approve any use of a beneficiary's VA funds. You,'' and I'm presuming that's the fiduciary, ``agree to use these funds only as specifically authorized by VA. You agree to request VA approval for all spending of these funds, unless VA has previously authorized the expenditures. Any questions regarding authorized expenditures should be addressed to the fiduciary activity at the address and phone number on the front side of this form.'' Ms. Eagle, in your opinion, should VA remove this paragraph in question on VA Form 21-4703? Ms. Eagle. Yes. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Thank you. Ms. Estes, you mentioned that you submitted the annual report to VA but have heard nothing since. When is your last day to be informed of the status of this issue? You said today, correct? Ms. Estes. They told me I had 30 days, so I'm assuming--I took 30 days from the postmark on the envelope, that would be today. Mr. Johnson. Okay. What results, good or bad, have you experienced in the fiduciary program? Now, that's a big question, but ---- Ms. Estes. When there is contact, it's fine. I mean, when they come out and I talk to them, we go over the expenditures and stuff, I don't have a problem there. It's like a black hole. I don't get any return calls when I call and leave messages. I was afraid to send the accounting because they require originals of everything, original bank statements and stuff like that, and you're not handing it, you're mailing it, so I suspected something like that might happen, so we sent it certified and everything. And even--and then I followed up with a phone call saying I did this, I know I was supposed to have an audit, but nobody came out, so I'm submitting it, and so then we got the letter that said, I hadn't submitted it at all. Mr. Johnson. So basically it's miscommunication, lack of communication, lack of follow-up---- Ms. Estes. There would be no communication, right. Mr. Johnson. --no communication? Ms. Estes. Right. There's no communication. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Ms. Eagle, on the first panel, we discussed VA waivers for fiduciaries. And if I recall the testimony, they were not aware of waivers being granted for certification or fiduciary qualifications. Do you have any experience with VA fiduciary requirements being waived? Ms. Eagle. I do. What I find and what Mr. McLenachen was talking about is that a fiduciary for the first time will be reviewed, background checks perhaps performed. What I see happen in all of the cases I have reviewed, and assisting the veteran is that if that fiduciary has been at all ever in the VA system as a fiduciary previously, the background check is waived, criminal background checks are waived, et cetera, et cetera. So once he's in, it's good to go. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Mr. Rosinski, is the issue of a person with a criminal background being allowed to serve as a VA fiduciary an isolated incident in your view? Mr. Rosinski. Mr. Chairman, there's no way to tell. As Ms. Eagle just said, they waive all of the background checks I've ever seen. And also, my experience is, all they ask is, they're asked to check a box, have you ever been convicted and served more than one year for a felony, yes, no. So I'll leave it to you whether a convicted felon is going to answer that yes, no. That is, as far as I know, the background check. I have never seen anything else, and that is what is waived on top of it. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Rosinski, in your experience and clients you've represented, what is your background of some of the VA fiduciaries? Have you seen incidents where fiduciaries have been removed? Mr. Rosinski. The only fiduciary that I know was removed, was a daughter who was taking care of her 81-year old father, and was a registered nurse, and had been taking care of her father full-time for two decades, had retired from being a nurse to do that. She took her father to an Alzheimer's clinic because he has advancing Alzheimer's, and VA turned around and fired her as fiduciary, and has registered a complaint for misuse of those funds because they were not preauthorized. I've also--that's my example of firing. The issue of qualifications, I had the privilege of deposing two actual fiduciaries in the State of Texas. One was a cabinet salesman, who in 2009, got his first fiduciary appointment. In 2011, November 2011 when I had deposed him, had 53. He had never heard of a fiduciary until someone suggested that this would be a good job to have, since he had had a heart attack. The other fiduciary there is the full-time working single mother, who incidentally said her father had been a VA fiduciary, and that's how she found out about the program. Mr. Johnson. Okay. Ms. Eagle, given the three to five percent fee paid to a fiduciary for administering a veteran's account, what purpose would a fiduciary have for hoarding a veteran's money? Ms. Eagle. I think that the purpose of hoarding has nothing to do with how much they're being authorized from the veteran's money on a monthly basis. The reason they would be hoarding, and there's two different kinds of fiduciaries that I have dealt with. The hoarding is encouraged by the VA Fiduciary Program leadership, because they are to save as much money as possible, in case of future emergencies. Keep in mind that these are monthly recurring benefits. So needing to save $100,000 when the veteran's going to get paid $3,000 every month until and unless he passes, there's no need to save that much money. Second of all, lots of these fiduciaries are banks. It is in their best interest to keep as much money in their accounts as possible. So those are two possible reasons I see for hoarding other than you have people who have not had background checks performed, who may not have the veteran's best interests at heart. Mr. Johnson. Okay, thank you. With that, I yield to the Ranking Member for his questions. Mr. McNerney. Thank y"
