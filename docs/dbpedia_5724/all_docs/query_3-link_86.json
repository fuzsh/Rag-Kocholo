        "text": "With great speed and a considerable amount of controversy, managed care has produced dramatic changes in American health care. At the end of 1995, 161 million Americans—more than 60 percent of the total population— belonged to some form of managed health care plan (HIAA, 1996a). The movement into managed care has been especially rapid for the treatment of mental health and substance abuse (alcohol and drug) problems, also known as behavioral health. Behavioral health problems are common: every year, an estimated 52 million Americans have some kind of mental health or substance abuse problem (see ). At the end of 1995, the behavioral health benefits of nearly 142 million people were managed, with 124 million in specialty managed behavioral health programs and 16.9 million in an HMO (Open Minds, 1996).\n\nHealth maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), point-of-service plans, and other forms of managed care networks, such as managed behavioral health care organizations, differ in their organizational structures, types of practitioners and services, access strategies, payment for practitioners, and other features. Their goals, however, are similar: to control costs through improved efficiency and coordination, to reduce unnecessary or inappropriate utilization, to increase access to preventive care, and to maintain or improve the quality of care (IOM, 1996a; Miller and Luft, 1994).\n\nBoth private-sector employers and public-sector agencies (Medicaid and state mental health and substance abuse authorities) have turned to managed behavioral health care companies to control costs and improve quality and access for mental health and substance abuse care. Traditionally, mental health and substance abuse care benefits have been more limited compared with benefits for physical health, and for mental health and substance abuse care there also have been few alternatives to hospitalization. In the late 1980s, the majority (70 percent) of mental health funds spent by Medicaid and private insurance went for inpatient care, leading many researchers, clinicians, and advocates to question the imbalance and to search for policy changes. Only the introduction of managed care arrangements has led to a significant shift away from costly and often unnecessary inpatient stays to a more appropriate range of outpatient and community-based care. In sum, behavioral health care offers purchasers the potential to spread existing resources farther by paying for less intensive (and less expensive) treatment strategies that can return patients to a reasonable level of functioning, such as being able to return to work or school (England and Vaccaro, 1991).\n\nThe controversies in managed care are less about the goal of cost reductions and are more about the ways in which cost reductions are achieved. Methods of cost control include authorizing only certain practitioners who are under contract to provide services to an enrolled population, reviewing treatment decisions, closely monitoring high-cost cases, reducing the number of days for inpatient hospital stays, and increasing the use of less expensive alternatives to hospitalization (Iglehart, 1996; Shore and Beigel, 1996).\n\nIn the committee's view, managed care strategies are not inherently harmful and can be appropriate and helpful, as in the shift from inpatient to outpatient care, the additional supervision for complex cases, and applications of standards based on best practices. However, certain activities of companies that provide behavioral health care, such as limiting or denying services that are considered to be needed, adding barriers to access to care such as increased copayments for outpatient visits, and adding gatekeepers who change the practitioner-patient relationship, are viewed as having an adverse impact on the quality of care (Mechanic et al., 1995).\n\nThe overall impact of managed care on the quality of health care is difficult to determine. Managed care has many structures, making comparisons across organizational forms (e.g., HMOs vs. PPOs) difficult. In addition, the quality of health care is difficult to measure and define because of the complexity of health care. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has defined quality of care as “the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge” (IOM, 1990a, p. 21).\n\nDefinition of Quality of Care\n\nThe degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge (IOM, 1990a, p. 21).\n\nAdopting this definition would suggest an array of health services research based on the variations of each component: health services (e.g., primary care and specialty drug abuse, alcoholism, and mental health treatment in different practice settings, including hospital-based and office-based practices and health centers), individuals (e.g., differences among children, adolescents, adults, and seniors, as well as gender differences), populations (e.g., cultural differences and differences between rural and urban populations), and outcomes (e.g., cure, relapse prevention, and return to functioning). The combinations are virtually unlimited.\n\nPublic interest in quality of care is keen, and purchasers are not waiting for conclusive outcomes research to help them make decisions on the value and effectiveness of different managed care options. HMO ratings, adapted from product and service rating systems such as those developed by Consumer Reports, are published in national magazines such as Time, U.S. News and World Report, and Newsweek and in national newspapers including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today. Report cards and ratings are produced by managed care organizations, governments, purchaser coalitions, and trade organizations, emphasizing consumers' satisfaction with their care and the services that they have received.\n\nWhen these new measures of health care quality are added to the traditional approaches, primarily accreditation and licensure of practitioners and facilities, quality assessment becomes a complex patchwork of mechanisms. Federal, state, and local governments, accreditation organizations, managed care organizations, purchaser coalitions, consumer groups, professional organizations, and the media are actively involved in providing information on the quality of health care. Some of these efforts are collaborative, but some are competitive. Overall, the picture is incomplete, inconsistent, and inadequate for making truly informed decisions about the quality of health care services. To those who are responsible for purchasing care, the absence of consensus on quality measurement makes decisions more difficult.\n\nIn the spring of 1995, the IOM was asked by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to convene a committee to examine quality assurance and accreditation guidelines for managed behavioral health care. The committee's charge was to provide a framework to guide the development, use, and evaluation of performance indicators, accreditation standards, and quality improvement mechanisms in managed behavioral health care (i.e., services related to mental health, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse). In carrying out this task, the committee operated on a clear premise: the ultimate goal of the work was to improve the quality of care for people with behavioral health problems.\n\nAlthough many of the committee's concerns about the quality of behavioral health care are unique, any study of accreditation and other quality assurance strategies also has relevance to the general health care system. The processes of accreditation and quality assurance are fundamentally the same in the primary care and specialty sectors, and the role of primary care practitioners contributes to the evaluation and delivery of behavioral health care. Furthermore, all sectors of the health care delivery system are responding to the same demands from policymakers and the public for accountability and cost-effectiveness.\n\nSix themes emerged from the committee's review of the research and industry literature. The themes were echoed and amplified in the testimony from individuals from the managed behavioral health care industry, accreditation organizations, professional associations, and advocacy groups; consumers; and health policy analysts. They are as follows:\n\n1.\n\nBehavioral health problems include a wide range of conditions whose effects may be short-lived or lifelong and that may be mildly distressing or profoundly disabling. Many conditions are chronic and relapsing. Most can be effectively treated and respond to appropriate and ongoing care.\n\n2.\n\nTreatment is most successful when it matches an individual's needs and includes an array of integrated services, including primary care, specialty mental health and substance abuse care, and community-based care, such as social support programs.\n\n3.\n\nBehavioral health care is changing rapidly and profoundly, stimulated primarily by the introduction and evolution of managed care and by the discovery of new and effective medications and other treatments.\n\n4.\n\nThe influence of managed care will continue to grow. Administered appropriately, it can provide quality care at reasonable cost. Without careful attention, it can result in the undertreatment and neglect of some of the most vulnerable individuals.\n\n5.\n\nThe complex patchwork of quality measures and accreditation mechanisms has yet to produce significant progress in the effort to improve the quality of care, but it is laying a foundation of performance measures and accreditation standards that may ultimately serve that purpose.\n\n6.\n\nDifferences in perspectives and differences in the timing of and strategies for treatment make it difficult to find a set of measures of the quality of behavioral health care services that all stakeholders can agree on.\n\nThis final point must be emphasized. A combination of factors—including the expected outcome, the time at which treatment effects are measured, and the perspective of the individual consumers and practitioners—can produce dramatically different conclusions. Confronted with a patient with suicidal depression, for example, a psychiatrist might judge treatment as high quality if that patient no longer has suicidal thoughts after a week in the hospital. The patient's mother, on the other hand, may be disappointed with the hospitalization even if she is pleased that her son was released so soon and denies suicidal thoughts. She may feel that the resident psychiatrist was inexperienced, that the attending psychiatrist doubted her account of the potential reasons for her son's crisis, and that the underlying causes of his problem were not addressed. This same set of circumstances could occur in both fee-for-service and managed care settings, although the next steps for reviewing the treatment decisions might be very different.\n\nDespite such challenges, the committee believes that all of the stakeholders—consumers, practitioners, public and private purchasers, managed care companies, accreditation organizations, and other citizens and groups with a stake in the quality of care—can and must work together to reach a coordinated, collaborative, and consensus approach to quality measurement and treatment. The committee believes that efforts to achieve consensus, both on definitions and on measures of quality, are a valuable investment in the effort to provide the best possible treatment at the lowest appropriate cost.\n\nThe development of consensus on quality is particularly important in the field of behavioral health for a variety of reasons that will be discussed throughout this report. Both the complexity of health care and the number of stakeholders have grown extremely rapidly. In the field of behavioral health, the growth in complexity can be attributed to at least four factors:\n\n1.\n\nIncreased scientific knowledge about the effectiveness of treatment and the proliferation of new treatment methods give both primary care and specialty practitioners an opportunity to treat these problems.\n\n2.\n\nMore publicity, greater public understanding, availability of insurance, and less stigma associated with behavioral health conditions result in increased numbers of people seeking treatment and give purchasers new incentives to control their costs.\n\n3.\n\nDifferences in the structure of insurance coverage for behavioral health care compared with that for physical health care, including the continued application of lifetime and annual limits and other restrictions, have drawn the attention of state and federal lawmakers, businesses, lobbies, and advocacy groups that seek parity for behavioral and physical health care coverage.\n\n4.\n\nThe immense growth in managed care in general and in carve-outs (independent, specialty managed care organizations for behavioral health treatment) changes purchasers' choices and prompts new consumer actions.\n\nWhat makes the health care system succeed or fail in providing high-quality treatment is the interaction between groups of stakeholders and their views on the system's structure, access to care, outcomes, costs, and other factors. Throughout the committee's deliberations, the perspectives of different stakeholders— consumers and families, practitioners, purchasers, and the managed care industry—were discussed. Different stakeholders provided their perspectives, and each must be considered to provide a context for the committee's observations and recommendations."
