        "text": "CHICAGO (WLS) -- A Chicago dog owner is furious with a local animal hospital after she brought her dog in to get her teeth cleaned only for her to be accidentally spayed.\n\nAshley Jenkins said her 10-year-old cavapoo Savannah was due for a routine teeth cleaning.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\n\"I was nervous, but I knew it was something that needed to be done,\" she said \"I've had Savannah for 10 years, since she was eight weeks old. So yes, she is my baby.\"\n\nJenkins took her dog to Banfield Pet Hospital in Chicago's Beverly neighborhood, a location the dog has been to before.\n\nA few hours after dropping Savanah off, Jenkins said she got a disturbing call from the medical director at Banfield about what they called \"a slight mix-up.\"\n\n\"Instead of Savannah getting her teeth cleaning, she got spayed, and she said it just like that,\" Jenkins said. \"And I'm like... 'excuse me?' 'How did that happen?!'\"\n\nShe said the director told her there was another dog that looked similar to Savannah, and that's how the mistake happened.\n\n\"I'm in shock! I'm baffled. I'm confused,\" she said. \"When I saw Savannah, I had tears. I had tears in my eyes. She looked at me like, you let them do this to me. I shattered.\"\n\nJenkins said if she was ever going to get Savannah spayed, it wouldn't be at 10 years old.\n\n\"I don't want to put her through any unnecessary stress, surgeries. I would have never done this to her,\" she said.\n\nThe ABC7 I-Team reached out to Banfield and a spokesperson responded, saying in part, \"Banfield has existing measures in place to prevent errors from happening and we're thoroughly investigating what occurred. All other patients in the hospital received the intended care they were scheduled for. We are taking this matter seriously and working directly with the family to address their questions and concerns, as well as extend our sincere apologies.\"\n\nJenkins said Banfield offered to schedule Savannah for a teeth cleaning in the coming weeks.\n\n\"Are you kidding me? You think i would trust you with my dog again?\" she said. \"Both of our rights were snatched from us.\"\n\nBanfield told the I-Team the health, safety, and wellbeing of pets is their top priority, and they are committed to providing high-quality care to the millions of pets they see every year.\n\nBanfield said they are glad to hear Savannah is recovering well and remain committed to providing and covering the cost of any related care."
