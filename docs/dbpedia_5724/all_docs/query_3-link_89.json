        "text": "Clyde G. Johnson, 81, of Streator passed away with family by his side on Tuesday, July 30, 2024 at O.S.F. St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Ottawa.\n\nFuneral services will be at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, August 6 at New Beginnings Baptist Church in Streator.\n\nVisitation will be from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Monday, August 5 at the Solon-Telford Funeral Home in Streator. Additional visitation will be from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, August 6 at the New Beginnings Baptist Church in Streator.\n\nBurial will be in Hillcrest Memorial Park in Streator. Full military rites will be accorded by members of the Leslie G. Woods American Legion Post 217 and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1492. Pallbearers will be his grandchildren, Bill Allison III, Lincoln Johnson, Guy Johnson; and friends, Jim Cherveny, Lyle Peterson, Michael Hadsell, and Bob Burris.\n\nBorn January 19, 1943 in Kewanee, IL, Clyde was the son of Lawrence and Leva (Lorras) Johnson. He married Sally J. Robinson on January 20, 1967 at First Baptist Church of Kewanee.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sally J. Johnson of Streator; a daughter, Stacy (Bill) Allison of Chillicothe. IL; sons, Jeff (Mary) Johnson of Wauwatosa, WI and Derek (Bridget) Johnson of Savannah, GA; grandchildren, Emily Allison, Bill (Lydia) Allison III, Aubrey Allison, Josey (Clark) Owsley, Libby Allison and Joe Schlink, Sadey (Jonathan) Rose, and Ivy Allison; Daisy Johnson, Lincoln Johnson, Guy Johnson, and Dashiell Johnson; Adelyn Johnson, Evan Johnson, Owen Johnson and Emersyn Johnson; great-grandchildren, Billy Allison IV and Oscar “Ozzy” Allison; and a half-sister, Donna Boberg of Cambridge, IL.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; his step-mother, Ann Johnson; and a son in infancy, Erich Johnson.\n\nRaised in Kewanee, Clyde graduated from Kewanee High School in 1961 and later attended Western Illinois University, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in education and a master’s degree in business education and guidance. After college, Clyde was drafted into the U.S. Army and served for two years. Clyde’s business degree ended up becoming fortuitous, as while Clyde was on his flight for his field mission in Vietnam in 1968, he struck up a conversation with his guardian angel, who just so happened to need someone who could type and work as an office assistant to General William Westmoreland at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. When Clyde’s flight landed, a transfer of position was settled with a single phone call and Clyde never saw nor heard from that stranger again.\n\nAfter nearly a year in Vietnam, Clyde returned to the states to live out his true calling, teaching at Streator High School and starting a family. For the next 34 years, Clyde taught business and accounting classes, coached various basketball and football teams, and eventually became a guidance counselor for the last 10 years of his career. In addition to educating and advising countless students who passed through the halls during his time at Streator High School, Clyde was also fortunate enough to have each of his kids in various classes during their high school years. That did, however, lead to multiple smart-aleck notes getting handed in as homework asking for allowance raises or to leave class early because “you’re a boring a teacher.” Outside of his time at Streator High School, Clyde was also a local realtor in Streator and worked as an agent for both Century 21 and Hart Realty throughout his career. Clyde too could be found spending countless hours at fields and gymnasiums either coaching or cheering for his own children during their sporting events over the years.\n\nOnce retired, Clyde could still be found at Streator High School frequently serving as a substitute teacher or a test proctor. He and Sally also traveled extensively and enjoyed a variety of trips with friends. With his affable personality, easygoing manner, and conversational skills, Clyde had a special way of making others feel comfortable. He had a network of friends across the country, from Streator to Arizona to South Carolina to Georgia, all with whom he enjoyed frequent dinners, socialization, and talking about anything Cubs or Bears related. His favorite times, however, were visiting his children, grandchildren, and recently great-grandchildren. As grandparents, he and Sally loved attending their grandchildren’s gymnastics meets, soccer, softball, volleyball and baseball games, music recitals, school events, and church events. Clyde had no greater joy in life than providing in every way for his children and grandchildren. Each one of them knows how deeply he loved them. He has left his family and friends a legacy of love and generosity.\n\nClyde was a man of faith and a longtime member of First Baptist Church, now New Beginnings Baptist Church of Streator. Memorials may be directed to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital or New Beginnings Baptist Church. Condolences may be left for the family at www.solontelford.com"
