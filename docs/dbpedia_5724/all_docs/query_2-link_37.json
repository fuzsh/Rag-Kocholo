        "text": "Published on August 7, 2024\n\nIn this year of choices, Mayor Battle and City leaders encourage Huntsville area residents to elect to adopt, not shop, and give loving homes to shelter animals.\n\nIn August, Huntsville Animal Services (HAS) is offering free adoptions on most adult pets as part of the nationwide “Clear the Shelters” adoption campaign.\n\n“We invite everyone to come out, meet these wonderful animals and consider giving them a loving forever home,” Mayor Tommy Battle said. “Together, we can ensure every pet finds a family, and every home has a furry friend.”\n\nHAS Interim Director Virgie Graham said the shelter experienced an alarmingly high number of intakes this summer and needs the community’s help to alleviate stress on the shelter and the animals by adopting or fostering.\n\n“When owners fail to spay or neuter their pets, the result is a shelter full of animals that become stressed by the noisy environment and can often show signs of aggression to humans or other animals,” Graham said. “The reality is that we are not a no-kill shelter, and without the community’s assistance, we will have to take measures to relieve this undue stress.”\n\nAnimal Services is one of hundreds of organizations participating in “Clear the Shelters.” This year marks the 10th anniversary of the initiative, which surpassed one million adoptions nationwide in 2023.\n\nWhile adoption fees have been waived on most adult pets, some exclusions apply. Adoptions include up-to-date vaccinations, a microchip for pet identification, spay or neuter surgery, a City license and a free bag of dry pet food while supplies last.\n\nA full list of available pets at Huntsville Animal Services can be found here."
