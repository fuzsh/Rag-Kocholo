Cazares creates an epic multiverse where time is fluid and the characters are refracted through literal televisions, imagined video games, endless Walmart aisles and a double-wide torn in two. NYTW Usual Suspect Rubén Polendo, founding artistic director of Theater Mitu, directs the multi-media production which includes live performance, live camera feeds and pre-recorded video.\n\nScenic & Costume Design Bretta Gerecke\n\nSpecialty Costumes Mondo Guerra\n\nLighting Design Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew\n\nTechnology Design Theater Mitu (Kelly Colburn, Alex Hawthorn, Justin Nestor)\n\nCasting Caparelliotis Casting (David Caparelliotis/Joseph Gery)\n\nFight Director J.

Committed to challenging the parameters of theater research and practice with Mitu for over twenty years, Polendo’s practice and pedagogical work is situated in the tension between acting and performance, theatrical design and installation, multi-media and interactive technology. Theater Mitu is located in its own interdisciplinary arts space in Gowanus, Brooklyn called MITU580. This former glass recycling facility is a unique gathering place where transdisciplinary arts practice is interrogated, incubated and produced. The company’s work has also been presented and developed nationally (including NYTW, The Public Theater, Skirball, Lincoln Center, NAATCO, Rattlestick Theater, 3LD, Kennedy Center, McCarter, Perseverance, The Alliance, Mark Taper Forum, A.C.T., Sundance, Watermill, NACL, Zspace, Rubin Gallery, MASS MoCA, NOLA Contemporary Arts Center, LATC, BAM) and internationally (including Patravadi Center/Thailand, CCPN/Mexico, DUOC/Chile, Visthar/India, UB Blkbx/Mongolia, Mansion Blatt/Lebanon, Manarat Al Saadiyat/UAE, NYUAD Arts Center/UAE, Kontakt Festival/Poland, CIFCET/Egypt, MESS Festival/Bosnia & Herzegovina). Theater Mitu has been company-in-residence at The Public Theater, New York Theatre Workshop and at The NYU Abu Dhabi Arts Center. Polendo served as Founding Theater Program Director and Associate Dean for the Arts Center at NYU Abu Dhabi. Polendo is currently Chair of The Department of Drama at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nTheater Mitu / Co-Producer\n\nDriven by a commitment to innovation, Theater Mitu expands the definition of theater through methodical experimentation with its form. Founded in 1997, this artist-led organization frames artmaking as a mode of research and inquiry. We share knowledge, spark dialogue, and strengthen our community through cultivating radical ways of reimagining our world. Mitu embodies this by way of theatrical productions and exhibitions, trans-global research initiatives, artist support opportunities, education programs galvanizing the next generation of artists, and the curated programming of MITU580. Mitu’s founding Artistic Director Rubén Polendo, and Co-Artistic Director Justin Nestor, lead an interdisciplinary group of company members in building bridges across ideas, cultures, and communities. Mitu’s work has been presented at theaters, contemporary arts centers, and venues throughout the United States, South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. In 2018, Mitu established MITU580, a space where transdisciplinary arts practice is interrogated, incubated, and produced. This 2,400-square foot multi-use art space stands on unceded Munsee Lenape and Canarsie land now known as Brooklyn, NY. The venue is home to our primary artistic programs: New Work (world premieres and tours of company created productions); Hybrid Arts Lab (fellowship supporting trans, non-binary, and women artists of color working in technology and performance); Expansion Works (developing and presenting works fusing new media, visual art, and performance); and Artists-At-Home (technical residencies offering space and equipment for artists to integrate technology into the process of creating new work). Theater Mitu values artistic rigor, disciplined exploration, and the continuous exchange of knowledge. We are committed to creating and maintaining a space that embraces the whole person as a vibrant and unique range of embodied experiences, histories, and imaginations. Theater Mitu asserts that identity is not negation but aggregation. We hold these intersectionalities as essential to innovation and the vibrancy and growth of our community."
