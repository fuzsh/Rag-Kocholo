        "text": "Fred Silverman (born September 13, 1937, New York City, New York, U.S.—died January 30, 2020, Los Angeles, California) was an American television producer and executive who, as head of programming at each of the three major channels in the United States (CBS, ABC, and NBC), introduced a number of shows that are widely considered classics.\n\nSilverman attended Syracuse University (B.A., 1958) and the Ohio State University (M.A., 1960). He then worked at WGN-TV in Chicago before eventually becoming vice president of programming at CBS (1970–75). In that post he helped transform the channel with a series of groundbreaking sitcoms, including The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–77), All in the Family (1971–79), and M*A*S*H (1972–83). As president of ABC’s entertainment division (1975–78), he helped produce such popular shows as Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–79), Laverne & Shirley (1976–83), and Charlie’s Angels (1976–81). He also had success with the highly acclaimed miniseries Roots (1977), which was based on the novel by Alex Haley."
