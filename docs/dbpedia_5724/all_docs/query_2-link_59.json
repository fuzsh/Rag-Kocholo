        "text": "La Biennale di Venezia and Campari are pleased to announce that the Italian production designer Paola Comencini (C’è ancora domani, La bestia nel cuore, Romanzo criminale) will be the recipient of the Campari Passion for Film Award of the 81st Venice International Film Festival (August 28th - September 7th, 2024).\n\nThe ceremony for the award to Paola Comencini will take place on Friday 6th of September in the Sala Grande (Palazzo del Cinema) at 9.30 pm, before the screening Out of Competition of Il tempo che ci vuole (Italy/France, 110’) by Francesca Comencini, starring Fabrizio Gifuni and Romana Maggiora Vergano, featuring Paola Comencini’s production design.\n\nAbout Il tempo che ci vuole by Francesca Comencini:\n\nA father and a daughter. Cinema and life. Childhood that seems perfect and then grow up making everything wrong. Falling and getting up, starting again, getting old, becoming fragile, letting go but never getting lost. The time it takes to save yourself\n\nThe Director of the Venice International Film Festival, Alberto Barbera, said, «Throughout her lengthy career as an architect, set designer and costume designer, Paola Comencini has demonstrated a special sensibility in highlighting the distinctive traits of eras and characters, navigating through genres and languages with great rigour and invention. Her remarkable creative spirit allows her to best interpret the spirit of the stories to be brought to the big screen and to enhance each and every character in interior spaces and outdoor environments. Her innate taste supported by an exceptional professionalism have led her to work with filmmakers who differ widely in temperament and style, starting with her father Luigi. In addition to her sisters Cristina and Francesca, she has worked with some of the most important Italian directors, including Michelangelo Antonioni, Riccardo Milani, Michele Placido, Daniele Luchetti, Stefano Sollima, Carlo Vanzina, as well as Paola Cortellesi for her highly successful debut C’è ancora domani (2023), definitively establishing herself as one of the best costume and set designers in Italian cinema. She has achieved this result through constant dedication and careful study which has always been manifest in the layouts of the sets, in the selection of the fabrics, in the use of often simple props, in the enhancement of every environment. This is the remarkable work of an atelier carried out with meticulous passion, which places her among the finest production designers in the world».\n\n“We are very proud to confirm the official ‘Campari Passion for Film Award’, created by Campari alongside the Artistic Direction of the Exhibition - announced the Senior Marketing Director Campari Group, Alberto Ponchio. Sticking with the main theme that everything comes about through Passion, already understood as a fundamental element for inspiring Creativity, the Prize is aimed at showing an appreciation for the figures who, alongside the director, contribute to excellence when creating cinematic art. This year, in choosing the Italian production designer Paola Comencini, we have rewarded the a profession that is characterised by a distinct aesthetic and artistic sensitivity and the ability to combine passion, craft work, innovation, always looking ahead”.\n\nThe Campari Passion for Film Award, instituted six years ago at the 75th Venice Film Festival, seeks to highlight the remarkable contribution given by the director's closest collaborators to the fulfillment of the artistic project that each film represents. Passion for Film attributes this award to these professional figures, who are more than just craftsmen: they are artists and co-authors of the films to which they offer the gift of their unparalleled talent. Over the years, the award has been given to the American film editor Bob Murawski, to the Italian cinematographer Luca Bigazzi, to the American jazz trumpeter and composer Terence Blanchard, to the British production designer Marcus Rowland, to the American artist and costume designer Arianne Phillips, and last year the Italian production designer Tonino Zera.\n\nBorn in Rome in 1951, after graduating from the French baccalauréat, she attended the faculty of architecture. However, very early on she decided to work and started following some production as an intern. In 1972 she participated as a volunteer assistant in the film shot by Billy Wilder in Italy, Avanti!.\n\nIn 1978 she began working with her father Luigi Comencini, who was a strict and demanding teacher. Her career progressed between ups and downs. She works in all genres of films, comedies, dramas, crime, costume and modern, with directors very different from each other. And she learns something from everyone. She builds environments of all kinds in the various studios. She also collaborated with Cristina and Francesca Comencini.\n\nShe received the David di Donatello in 2006 with the film Romanzo criminale directed by Michele Placido and would later be involved in two seasons of the series of the same name directed by a comparative newcomer Stefano Sollima.\n\nHer filmography is very long and very eclectic, as you can see from the list below. This bizarre eclecticism corresponds to the very nature of her chosen craft but also to the character of the production designer.\n\nThe last two years have been fortunate. In 2022 she curates the sets of C'è ancora domani by Paola Cortellesi, with whom a deep professional and human relationship is established. 2023 is the year of Il tempo che ci vuole directed by Francesca Comencini, a film in which the set design is not only a creative and accurate work but an incredible emotional journey.\n\nFilmography\n\n2023 “Il tempo che ci vuole” by Francesca Comencini\n\n2022 “C’è ancora domani” by Paola Cortellesi (nomination David di Donatello)\n\n2022 “L’ultima volta che siamo stati bambini” by Claudio Bisio\n\n2021 “Il principe di Roma” by Edoardo Falcone\n\n2020 “I fratelli De Filippo” by Sergio Rubini\n\n2019 “Luna nera” by Francesca Comencini, Susanna Nicchiarelli, Paola Ranby\n\n2018 “Suburra - La serie”, season 2, by Andrea Molaioli / Pietro Messina\n\n2017/2018 “Tutto può succedere”, series tv by Lucio Pellegrini season 3\n\n2016/ 2017 “Tempesta” by Daniele Lucchetti\n\n2016 “Tutto può succedere”, TV series by Lucio Pellegrini season 2\n\n2015 “Qualcosa di nuovo” by Cristina Comencini\n\n2015 “Tutto può succedere”, TV series by Lucio Pellegrini season1\n\n2014 “Latin Lover” by Cristina Comencini\n\n2013 “Oriana Fallaci”, TV series by Marco Turco\n\n2013 “Ti ho sposato per allegria”, comedy by N.
