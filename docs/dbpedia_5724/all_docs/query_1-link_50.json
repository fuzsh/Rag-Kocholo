        "text": "Bill Johnson, a swaggering skier who in 1984 became the first American man to win an Olympic gold medal in downhill skiing, but whose life took a sharp, precipitous turn soon afterward, died on Thursday at an assisted-living facility in Gresham, Ore. He was 55.\n\nMegan Harrod, a spokeswoman for the United States Alpine team, confirmed his death. Johnson, in declining health, had a series of strokes in recent years after sustaining brain damage in a skiing accident in 2001.\n\nDownhill racers, who hurl themselves down slick, dizzying slopes, are seldom retiring, but Johnson’s brashness stood out. Like Muhammad Ali, who predicted the round in which he would stop an opponent, Johnson promised Olympic gold in 1984, at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. Everybody else, he said, “could fight for second.”\n\nAfter winning the gold convincingly, at 23, he was asked what it meant.\n\n“Millions,” Johnson said with his trademark smirk. “We’re talking millions.”\n\nIt was a heady time for Johnson after that triumph. President Ronald Reagan expressed the nation’s pride at a White House reception, telling him, “You gave your country thrills beyond description.” There were a slew of endorsement deals, magazine covers and, in 1985, a fictionalized television movie about his life, “Going for the Gold: The Bill Johnson Story,” starring Anthony Edwards as Johnson.\n\nJohnson married and bought a house in Malibu, Calif., and a Porsche. His victories in two World Cup events the month after the Olympics presaged a bright athletic future.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
