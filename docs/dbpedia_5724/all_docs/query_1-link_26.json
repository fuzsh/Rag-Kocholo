        "text": "The first time Bill Johnson stepped foot in the city of Reno, he was impressed.\n\nIt actually marked the first time Johnson was ever on television. That appearance came in March 1997. At the time, Johnson was a 20-something assistant basketball coach at Nebraska, which visited Nevada for a second-round NIT matchup. The Cornhuskers' head coach,Danny Nee, turned down the pre-game interview, assigning the gig toJohnson.\n\n\"It was just a little local cut-in,\" Johnson remembered during an interview with NSN this week at Morrill Hall.\n\nNebraska knocked off Nevada that night, scoring a 78-68 road win thanks to 21 points and 15 rebounds fromMikki Moore and 18 points and four assists fromTyronn Lue, both of whom went on to play in the NBA. But the thing that stuck out to Johnson was the crowd. A then-Wolf Pack record 11,275 fans packed into Lawlor Events Center, a mark that still ranks top 10 in school history 25 years later.\n\n\"It was a big-time environment,\" Johnson said. \"It reminded us of Lincoln. We were the main show in Lincoln, Neb., just as Nevada is in Northern Nevada, and it was an exciting place to play. I still remember how loud it was. I've been in some loud arenas like (Kansas') Allen Fieldhouse. It rivaled that in noise that night.\"\n\nThat stint at Nebraska wasJohnson'sforay into working at the college level, a journey that came full circle this month whenJohnson was named the Nevada Wolf Pack's acting athletic director following the .Johnson's first official day on the job began Sunday, and he's been busy since then, spending time this week at the Mountain West football coaches meetings.\n\nJohnson knows this is not a long-term arrangement. He'll stick on the job a couple months before a permanent athletic director is hired. After all, he's already got a big job on campus as UNR's vice president for advancement, that title essentially putting him in charge of the university's overall fundraising efforts, including those in athletics.Johnson's main task as acting AD is to close the 2022 fiscal year as smoothly as possible.\n\nWhen picking an acting AD, UNR president Brian Sandoval didn't opt for an active member of the Wolf Pack athletic department. But Johnson's college sports bona fides are strong.\n\n“Bill has had an incredibly well-rounded and accomplished career in higher education,\" Sandoval said. \"He’s a proven fundraiser and a builder of relationships. His experience in athletics was hard to ignore. He played Division I college basketball, coached as an assistant at the Division I level in the Big 12, Ivy League and West Coast Conference, and was an athletic administrator at a highly successful Big East institution. What I felt we needed for this interim period was someone who understands the landscape of collegiate athletics, and who also can provide a sense of stability for the student-athletes, coaches and staff of our athletic department. Bill’s a warm, caring and very hard-working person. We are extremely lucky to have someone with his skillset on our campus.”\n\nJohnson grew up in rural northeast Nebraska, the son of an Irish mother and Native American father. He was born on areservation and worked on his grandparents' farm as a kid, riding aJohn Deere 60. His dad was his first basketball coach, ushering him into that sport at age 5.Johnson eventually grew just shy of 6-foot-6, an undersized power forward these days. He played two years of junior college hoops atNortheast Community College outside his hometown.\n\nHe transferred to Nebraska in 1986 and played in the Big 8 against future NBA stars Danny Manning, Mitch Richmond, Mookie Blaylock and Harvey Grant. After earning his degree, he stayed in school to get a Master's in athletic administration while working as a graduate assistant, helping as a director of operations, compliance officer and on-court coach. He eventually became a full-time assistant, taking that trip with the Cornhuskers to Reno a few years later. From there,Johnson was an assistant coach at Columbia before a one-year stint as the head coach at Casper (Wyo). College prior to being an assistant at San Francisco. He was a finalist for the Montana State head job in 2006, but eventually moved away from athletics.\n\nJohnson's first experienced a hesitance toward life as a basketball coach in2003 when Columbia fired Armond Hill and his staff, which includedJohnson. The abruptness of that change made him consider his future, so while he still coached basketball another few years, he started to plant the seeds of change. In 2007, he left that profession and took a fellowship at Harvard that focused on thebusiness side of higher education administration. The change wasn't easy.\n\n\"Very hard,\" Johnson said. \"When you play something since age 5 and you walk in and see your spouse who's a 19-time track and field All-American who's been doing it since she was 5, athletics just becomes a way of life. Whether you're coaching or in high school or college or youth sports, it's a way of life. You're doing something on weekends with sports, and it becomes who you are. There's also a different way of carrying yourself and speaking and working in an athletic environment. That's different than in higher education. So it was a hard transition, just learning a new skillset and learning how to operate and maneuver at a big, complex, decentralized environment that moves at a slower pace.\"\n\nThe pace and passion sports offer was hard to give up, but it ultimately proved the right decision for Johnson, whose first job after his year at Harvard came at Georgetown University as a fundraiser. He then moved on to San Francisco (where he used to coach) and University of the Pacific before landing the VP of advancement job atCalifornia State University-East Bay in2017. Last August, he was hired for that same position at Nevada and oversees the university's fundraising efforts.\n\nJohnson has a daughter who is a sophomore at Northwestern and sons who attendDepoali Middle School andPoulakidas Elementary School in south Reno. He never viewed his stints in California as a final destination, but he does feel that way about Nevada, a state the mirrors his Nebraska roots. He also said having Sandoval as his boss was a big plus.\n\n\"I was looking for a place that reflected those values of relationship, community,\" Johnson said. \"I wanted to have a president that I could connect with, and I really connected to President Sandoval in the interview. With our kids, we thought this would be a great place for them to grow up and experience the outdoors and also be in a community that has values that we have. My family came out for the interview, not to interview it, but they drove all around Northern Nevada for two days. It had that Midwest hospitality where I grew up and that Southern hospitality where my wife grew up.\"\n\nJohnson has been at UNR for less than a year, and when Sandoval approached him about serving as acting AD, the opportunity to get back into athletics— temporarily, of course— was too much to pass up.\n\n\"Athletics is woven into our house,\" Johnson said. \"We believe in the participation of sport and what it does for student-athletes in terms of growth. Immediately, it was just a great honor. I couldn't be more excited to contribute over the next two months. It's something that's just meant so much in my life and my wife's life. We're going to (Nevada) baseball, softball and baseball again this weekend. Our boys come and enjoy it. This is who we are.\"\n\nUnderstanding his calling for the university are elsewhere, Johnson is not applying for the long-term AD job. His immediate task is to close out the fiscal year with the less glamorous part of being an athletic director, going through a compliance audit, making sure Title IX requirements are met, attempting to balance the budget, kicking off the 2022-23 season-ticket sales drive and making sure certifications are obtained for Wolf Pack athletes taking summer school classes. Johnson is aiming for a smooth handoff for the next athletic director, with a hiring expected this summer.\n\nAlthough athletics are no longer his driving force professionally, it remains a big part of who he is.\n\n\"I've said this in every interview stop along the road since I left athletics about 16 years ago: My father introduced me to a team sport at age 5 and it profoundly impacted how I try to lead an organization,\" Johnson said. \"We move collectively together. I firmly believe the organization health of any division you supervise or any department you lead is key. Culture trumps strategy. To my wife and I and to anyone who participated in sports, you face problem-solving, communication, success, failure all in 90 seconds, oftentimes in a public environment. Those are great soft skills in managing and leading people. It's profoundly impacted me and my time leading an organization.\"\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
