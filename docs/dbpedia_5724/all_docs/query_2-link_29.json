        "text": "This game is unlike any other game I've ever played. For perspective, I enjoy the loneliness of games like Fallout. I even enjoy the slower pace of those games, but this takes slower pace to a new level. Most of that is due to the long cut scenes, which you can skip, but I feel like you're missing out on the artistry of the game if you do that. At one point I'd been sitting still for so long that my wife said, \"Are you watching a movie? I thought you were playing a game.\" The gameplay itself is great! I'm playing with a controller on my iPad and Mac. The graphic details are amazing, and the sound effects and music are spot-on. This I've had some crashing issues on my 11\" M1 iPad Pro. My M1 Mac Mini does fine. I've tried propping up my iPad so it has good airflow around the back with no case, and that seems to be better. When the iPad is in the Magic Keyboard, it seems to crash more frequently. More T&E needed to solve that unless they release an update that addresses that.\n\nDeath Stranding is so much fun! Just before I finish the game (the power went out outside, otherwise I would have finished it already), I want to praise this game and my MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch). This is the first time in two and a half years since I bought it that I have felt that this is a device that can get hot, has a fan, and uses a battery (it offers the same experience as the daily use Intel MacBook Pro without gaming, haha.). The gaming experience it brings is perfect: the mini-LED backlight allows for a large amount of sky and light sources to be presented in HDR in the game; although it is only equipped with the M1 Pro 16GB of unified memory, its graphics processing power can maintain almost 120Hz stably ((it seems to me is.) , at 2560*1440 with \"very high\" quality), w/ or w/o power connected. This also means that I can play a 3A wherever and whenever I want (on the other hand, game saves can also be continued on iPhone, which is really great). Next, I will continue playing Death Stranding without plugging in, hoping to completely drain my battery until it's below 80% health (currently at 87%) before the AC three-year warranty expires. This MBP has been the most powerful and favorite among all the Macs and PCs I have used so far. I don't know if I should thank Tim Cook or thank Hideo Kojima, but playing Death Stranding on my MBP has been the first happy event of my 2024."
