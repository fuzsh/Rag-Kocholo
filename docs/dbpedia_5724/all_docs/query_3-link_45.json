        "text": "Medicare Advantage Plans\n\nIf you have Part A and Part B, you can join a Medicare Advantage Plan, sometimes called “Part C” or an “MA plan.” This type of Medicare health plan is offered by Medicare-approved private companies that must follow rules set by Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans include drug coverage (Part D) . What should I know about Medicare Advantage Plans?\n\nInsurance companies can decide if a plan will be available to everyone with Medicare in a state, or only in certain counties. Insurance companies may also offer more than one plan in an area, with different benefits and costs. Each year, insurance companies can decide to join or leave Medicare.\n\nIf a plan decides to stop participating in Medicare, you’ll have to join another Medicare health plan or return to Original Medicare.\n\nThe grace period is at least one month long, but plans can choose to have a longer grace period. If you lose eligibility for the plan, you'll have a Special Enrollment Period to make another choice.\n\nThis Special Enrollment Period starts when your Medicare Advantage Plan notifies you that you're no longer eligible for the plan. It continues during the plan's grace period, and if you're disenrolled from the plan at the end of the grace period, it continues for 2 months after your coverage ends. It's very important to review your coverage options at this time to make sure you continue to have the Medicare health and prescription drug coverage you want.\n\nTypes of Medicare Advantage Plans:\n\nHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) Special Needs Plans (SNPs)\n\nMedicare Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) Private Fee-for-Service Plans (PFFS) Compare All Plan Types\n\nOther Medicare health plans\n\nSome types of Medicare health plans aren't Medicare Advantage Plans, but are still part of Medicare. The coverage they offer varies depending on the specific type of plan. Some of these plans include Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B coverage, but most only offer Part B coverage. Some also include Medicare drug coverage (Part D). These other types of health plans include:\n\nMedicare Cost Plans\n\nDemonstration/pilot programs\n\nProgram of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE)"
