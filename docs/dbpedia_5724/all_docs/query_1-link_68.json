        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. (Dakota News Now) - While many of us may be eyeing the November election, others have been watching legislative changes and a bill making its way through Congress.\n\nOne such bill is the Farm Bill, which is the main policy governing agriculture and food.\n\nFarmers are concerned as to why the bill hasn’t passed yet, and Dakota News Now spoke with lawmakers and producers to learn what’s important for them.\n\nOn Wednesday at the Sioux Empire Fair, in celebration of Ag Appreciation Day, South Dakota’s elected officials and farmers alike met to share a meal and talk about what’s going on in the state.\n\nRepresentative Dusty Johnson discussed the changes with the farm bill, who it impacts and why it’s important.\n\n“Obviously, we all eat. We all want to make sure that we’ve got food available for purchase and having great American farmers and ranchers who have the predictability of knowing what the rules of the road are gonna be, makes sure that America is growing a powerful amount of food to feed us and the rest of the world,” Rep. Johnson explained.\n\nOverall the bill affects everyone, especially the farmers.\n\n“This really does affect them on a day-to-day basis because it identifies what the price support is for those commodities, and so for them, it means affecting their daily lives. It means it’s affecting their income. So they watch it carefully and they know a lot more about it than some people realize. They’d like to know what the future’s gonna look like for farming operations and what to plan for,” Senator Mike Rounds said.\n\nSeveral people have been eagerly waiting to hear about the bill, including SD Pork Producers Council Executive Director Glenn Muller.\n\n“Well, I’d be very surprised if we’d get a new farm bill. It has to be extended in September to be maintained and I would predict that they will do an extension to get passed the election and possibly the inauguration before we get a new farm bill. We’re certainly pushing to get it done prior to that, but optimism is not real high that that’s gonna happen,” Muller expressed.\n\nThe big question still remains: Who is to blame for the long wait? Muller said he’s not completely sure.\n\n“Well, I think as far as, I don’t know that I want to say blame. It just seems like there’s a lack of functionality at a national level in the legislative process and administration right now. A lot of focus on the election, but not so much productivity on what’s happening in Washington, D.C. is our concern,” Muller said.\n\nOfficials said that they hope to see a change in the congress by the first of the year."
