        "text": "Keanu Reeves will make his Broadway debut in Waiting for Godot.\n\nThe play, directed by Jamie Lloyd, will come to Broadway in fall 2025. Reeves will play Estragon and Alex Winter, an actor and co-star with Reeves in Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, will play Vladimir in the revival of Samuel Beckett’s play.\n\nReeves is well-known for his starring roles in the John Wick series, the Matrix films, Dangerous Liaisons, Something’s Gotta Give, Parenthood and more.\n\nReeves struck up a friendship with Winter after the filming of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Winter recently wrapped production on Adulthood, which he directed and starred in with Josh Gad and Kaya Scodelario. He has also directed the documentaries The YouTube Effect, Zappa, Showbiz Kids and The Panama Papers.\n\nThe exact theater for the revival has not yet been announced, but the production says it will play at one of Ambassador Theatre Group’s now seven theaters.\n\nBeckett’s Waiting for Godot is a philosophical play that sees Estragon and Vladimir engage in discussions and encounter other travelers, while waiting for a character named Godot. The play has appeared on Broadway four times, most recently in a 2013-14 production starring Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart.\n\nLloyd is known for his spare staging of revivals, including Betrayal with Tom Hiddelston, Charlie Cox and Zawe Ashton; A Doll’s House starring Jessica Chastain; and Sunset Boulevard, which is transferring to Broadway this fall, starring Nicole Scherzinger.\n\n“It is a real honor to be collaborating with the brilliant Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter on Samuel Beckett’s sublime masterpiece — one of the greatest plays of all time,” Lloyd said.\n\n“We’re incredibly excited to be on stage together and work with the great Jamie Lloyd in one of our favorite plays,” Reeves and Winter said.\n\nWaiting for Godot is produced by The Jamie Lloyd Company, ATG Productions, J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot Live and Gavin Kalin Productions."
