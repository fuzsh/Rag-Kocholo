        "text": "The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are coming off a 7-6 season and a Gasparilla Bowl victory to end the 2023 season. It was Ga. Tech’s first bowl game since the 2018 Quick Lane Bowl under Paul Johnson.\n\nCoach Brent Key has posted an 11-10 record (9-6 in the ACC) since replacing Geoff Collins during the 2022 season. After Collins was dismissed, Key finished 4-4 in ‘22 narrowly missing a bowl invite as interim coach.\n\nKey spent over a decade of his career under George O’Leary at both Georgia Tech and UCF before being hired as the Alabama offensive line coach under Nick Saban in 2016. While coaching the Crimson Tide OL, Key won one National Championship and two SEC Championships.\n\nIn ‘23, the Jackets more or less alternated wins throughout the season including that fateful win over the Miami Hurricanes . However, Ga. Tech has to stop losing to the Bowling Greens and Boston Colleges of the world in order to turn the corner.\n\nGT always has a hell of a strong schedule and ‘24 is no different. The Jackets will play six preseason ranked opponents including heading to Ireland to face FSU in Week Zero.\n\nProgram Evaluation\n\nAcquisition\n\nPer 247, the Yellow Jackets were 7th in recruiting in the ACC this off-season, and 33rd in composite ranking. GT’s transfer portal rating was 62nd in ‘24. Key brought in three four-star HS prospects and “only” 14 transfers.\n\nIn ‘23, GT’s composite class was ranked 62nd and did not include a single four-star. This is a make or break type of year for Tech, much like Miami. GT banked on their returning production and plan to only start a small handful of their transfers.\n\nDevelopment\n\nGT has only 14 active NFL players and development has been scarce in Atlanta for some time. However on the plus side, a majority of those prospects have come since Key arrived. If Tech wants to push above that just bowl eligible mark they’ll have to bring in more talent, or develop their talent to the fullest.\n\nDeployment\n\nDeployment objectively can best be judged by Bill Connelly’s SP+ analytics system. The SP+ combines returning production with recent recruiting (recency is biased) and recent history (2-4 seasons).\n\nTech is on the bottom end of the “Power 5” number of ~65 teams. The SP+ has GT as the 60th best team in FBS. The offense is 35th, the defense is 101st, and the kicking game is 68th.\n\nMiami’s SP+ OODK has the ‘Canes at 21st overall, 17th on offense, 38th on defense and 3rd in kicking. This revamped Miami offense with Cam Ward, Damien Martinez and Sam Brown shouldn’t have any issues scoring 35+ on Key’s Jackets.\n\nLevel Up: Area of Improvement\n\nClearly Georgia Tech needs to improve their defense if they want to compete for the ACC Championship or even play in a higher tier bowl game. The Jackets defense improved immediately when Key took over as interim but fell right back to Collins’ level in ‘23.\n\nLast year GT allowed 29.5 points per game, good for 97th of 133 FBS programs. Duke’s Tyler Santucci, a Mike Elko disciple, was hired by Key to serve as his defensive coordinator. This will be a complete overhaul from the Collins Era defensive staff as Key has hired Kyle Pope and Jess Simpson on staff as well.\n\nSimpson will be familiar to Miami fans from his two short runs in Coral Gables in 2018 and 2021. Simpson has coached for the Atlanta Falcons, Georgia State, and Duke in recent years.\n\nHedgehog Concept\n\nWhere I think culture will help Manny Diaz at Duke and he should hang his hat on it, I think Coach Key already understands how to create a winning (or at least more winningly) culture at GT.\n\nPart of that culture will be an insistence on playing solid defense (hence the staff changes) and in establishing the run game. Key and Mario Cristobal aren’t that dissimilar as both have been dubbed recruiters (Mario better than Brent) and OL coaches (Brent wins over Mario).\n\nKey even replaced Cristobal as the OL coach at Alabama before Cristobal headed west to Oregon and Willie Taggart’s staff in 2017.\n\nThe offense scored 31.1 PPG in ‘23 (43rd of 133) and looks to continue that improvement into the new season. QB Haynes King returns along with RB Jamal Haynes. The Haynes Bros. combined for 17 rushing TD’s and both averaged 6.1 yards per carry last season.\n\nWR Eric Singleton Jr. also returns to Atlanta. Last season Singleton caught a team high six TD’s. The culture in Atlanta is established by bringing their studs back and living up to the promise that Key made to keep moving forward.\n\nMost Interesting Game from ‘23\n\nThe game of the year for GT was a loss but it was the time the game has been within one score (eight points) since Georgia Tech won “Clean Old-Fashioned Hate” back in 2016. Of course that’s two coaches ago for UGA and three for GT.\n\nIn ‘23, UGA edged the Jackets 31-23 at Bobby Dodd Stadium to remain undefeated. GT fell to 6-6 prior to their win over UCF in the Gasparilla Bowl. UGA went on to lose to Alabama in the SEC Championship Game before dismantling FSU by 60 in the Orange Bowl.\n\nUGA was banged up on offense but still exploded in the middle of the game to score 24 points in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. The middle 8 is where games are often won or lost and this was on exception.\n\nClearly GT needs to improve their defense giving up 8.8 per throw to Carson Beck and 8.7 per carry to Kendall Milton (with two scores). But how was GT able to move the ball on UGA’s vaunted defense?\n\nKing averaged 7.9 yards per attempt and scored twice on the ground, while Haynes and Dontae Smith averaged 5.4 and 4.5 yards per carry, respectively. Singleton caught four balls for 96 yards (24 per catch) as well.\n\nGIFs\n\nAbove- With every team in the USofA running the same dozen concepts, mixing a common play up with a new wrinkle is smart here. Instead of the typical split zone with the TE running a slide (flat out) route, GT has him run a ‘rail’ instead and you can see the vacated space over the middle.\n\nAbove- Athletic QB’s vs. over-aggressive defenses. UGA is used to grabbing the jet sweep and picking up a TFL, except GT read the overhang player and used his aggressiveness against him. King scores here on inverted veer from a jet sweep look.\n\nAbove- That’s the screenshot of it and King sees pull all the way and scores.\n\nAbove- King is a high risk (16 INT’s) high reward (34 TD’s) type of player. His skillset did not mesh well with Jimbo Fisher at Texas A&M but works for King in his read option’y offense.\n\nAbove- I have no idea why this play was called on 4th and 1 and why their idea wasn’t to get King out in space in the first place, but his ability to extend a play works here on 4th and 1.\n\nAbove- More plays dialed up to take advantage of King’s legs and UGA’s chasing the big play. Faking the reverse is genius and works for a 1st down heading into the middle 8.\n\nAbove- Again, boom or bust on King. He takes some sacks he shouldn’t and even fumbles a couple of times during the game.\n\nAbove- A popular concept in the 2020’s has been “Bash.” Pulling the OL one way, reading the DE to the pull side, and having a jet sweep read going against the pullers.\n\nAbove- King is reading that circle defender and since he sits it’s time to give on the jet sweep. The WR’s job is to outrun the DT, which should be easy enough between his speed and path. The OC is banking on the DT following the pulling guard which they’re trained to do.\n\nAbove- Tech got into full Tecmo Super Bowl play-call mode against UGA. The base run, the counter, the play-action and the trick play. Here it’s a fake toss and keep behind the pulling lineman and TE.\n\nWrap up\n\nObviously GT will never ‘out talent’ UGA, but they dinked and dunked trick plays, reads, counters, and play-actions around enough to stay in the game. If Key didn’t kick so many FG’s against a team that was clearly going to score TD’s, GT might’ve been even closer into this thing (or lost by even more, who knows?!).\n\nBut playing a cat and mouse game to torture an aggressive DC and defense is the smart way to play it and they’ll have to continue that trend against FSU, Miami, Louisville and UGA in ‘24.\n\n2024 Prediction\n\nBrent Key has managed to turn chicken poop into chicken salad in Atlanta. Key already has complied 11 wins in 1.5 seasons while it took Collins three-and-change to win 10 games.\n\nGT could be vastly improve and actually win less games with their SOS. They have tough spots against FSU overseas; and their late season run of Miami-NCSU-UGA.\n\nHowever, they do get Miami after an off week and at the start of the three game run. This one will be closer than it should be."
