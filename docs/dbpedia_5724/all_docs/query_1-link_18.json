        "text": "Teltech Communications was founded in 1999 with a keen focus on customer service and strong relationships. As a Native-American/woman-owned business, the hard work, dedication, and perseverance it took to succeed came with no surprise. That identified core values which are still the heart of our company identity and have an active influence in our day-to-day operations and every business decision.\n\nOriginally launched as Teltech Communications, a telecommunications equipment reseller working with industry leading broadband service companies, the business quickly evolved to include warehousing, asset management, forward and reverse logistics, professional resources and, most recently, “technology solutions,” which is our overarching way of saying, “whatever you need, we are up to the challenge!” Our diverse team of industry veterans has the expertise to transform broadband networks, manage assets, implement new smarter technologies, and provide alternative cost-effective solutions. Teltech Group has 400,000 square feet of scalable warehouse space in multiple parts of the country and has proven again and again we are especially skilled at expanding or pulling back to fit our clients’ needs on the fly. We are committed to making a difference in the communities that we live and work. We are actively involved in a variety of initiatives that positively impact Native American communities too. Our subsidiary GrayWolves Telecom, for example, is aimed at improving broadband connectivity in America’s tribal lands. Teltech Group has also focused on the need to provide high speed internet access to rural locations like Rio Blanco County.\n\nOur Tethered Drone Solution has enabled temporary communications service in response to catastrophic damage caused by hurricanes in Florida, Louisiana, Haiti and Puerto Rico. Our main warehouses are ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certified and we are dedicated to the highest standards of quality for both technology and customer service. While others talk about quality and environmental sustainability, Teltech Group lives it. Our list of success stories is long, and our clients eagerly provide testimonials to support them.\n\nAmanda Hernandez-Lawler\n\nVice President of Business Solutions\n\nAmanda Hernandez-Lawler, Teltech’s VP of Business Solutions, is a veteran sales leader in equipment and distribution within the telecommunications space. With over 20 years in the industry, her success comes from being a champion for her customers – from the carriers to the broadband end-users. In her role, Amanda is responsible for business development, nurturing customer and vendor relationships, and the creation, implementation, and execution of Teltech’s sales strategy. She applies her technical knowledge, critical thinking, and motivational teamwork to expand and diversify the company’s business to generate top line revenue. Amanda brings strong negotiation and relationship-building skills to the table along with the proven ability to turn underperforming markets around. In previous positions, her discipline and commitment to excel in service resulted in exponential growth driving sales revenue up 300%. Simply put, she brings thoughtful leadership focused on maximizing Teltech’s market share while also being a true partner to customers and OEM’s."
