        "text": "GREENWICH STREET’S OWN HAUNTED HOUSE\n\nIn the summer of 1966, there was a haunted house setup in the Daniels' \"playhouse\" as part of a Carnival for Muscular Distrophy held by neighborhood kids J.P. Daniel, Laurie Bolster and John Maier. These carnivals were a fun way to raise money for muscular distrophy (before the Jerry Lewis Telethon) and were promoted by the afternoon kiddie show hosts on WTTG Channel 5. The playhouse was a perfect place to transform into a haunted house, similar to those of the Addams or Munsters families. A mysterious voice surprised each visitor, along with a remote- controlled robot monster .The fireplace held an iron pot full of \"Madame Witch’s Brew\", complete with snakes, bats and newts. Uncle Ogelthorpe's skeleton (a horseskull) was on display for all to see.\n\nIronically, the house was reported to be really haunted, in the years before the Daniels moved there in 1935. Charlotte Hottle recalls Mrs. Minnie Lent telling the story that the house's previous owners often heard a baby's ghost crying. No one in the Daniel family ever heard it, though.\n\n*****\n\nPOSTSCRIPT (May 2001)"
