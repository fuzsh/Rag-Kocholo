For example, 52% of female characters but 38% of males were seen playing personal-life roles. 56% of males but 42% of females played work oriented roles.\n\nCenter for the Study of Women in Television and Film\n\nLGBTQ Characters on TV\n\nLGBTQ series regulars on broadcast television reached a record high of 10.2%. That’s 90 out of 879 series regulars on broadcast scripted primetime TV.\n\nLGBTQ women in series regular/recurring roles on broadcast TV outnumbered LGBTQ men, 53% to 47%.\n\n52% of the 120 LGBTQ regular and recurring characters on broadcast networks were people of color. 48% of the 215 LGBTQ characters on cable TV were people of color, as were 41% of the 153 LGBTQ characters on streaming networks.\n\nBetween Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, there were 109 regular LGBTQ characters on scripted originals and 44 recurring LGBTQ characters.\n\nNetflix had the highest number of LGBTQ regular and recurring characters on scripted originals. The CW was the most LGBTQ-inclusive broadcast network, with 15.4% of series regulars identifying as LGBTQ, while Showtime was the most inclusive on cable.\n\nGLAAD/Variety\n\nWomen Behind the Scenes\n\nLooking at the percentage of women and underrepresented episodic directors from 2012-13 to 2019-20, 22.3% of episodes were directed by women and 22.4% by people of color.\n\nOverall, 5.2% of episodes had a woman of color in a directing role.\n\nInclusion Initiative\n\nOverall, women accounted for 31% of individuals working in key behind-the-scenes positions.\n\nWomen comprised 30% of all creators, directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and directors of photography on broadcast programs, 31% on cable programs, and 35% on streaming programs.\n\n63% of programs employed 5 or fewer women in the behind-the-scenes roles considered. 16% of programs employed 5 or fewer men.\n\nOverall, women fared best as producers (39%), followed by writers (36%), executive producers (32%), directors (30%), creators (28%), editors (17%), and directors of photography (8%).\n\n94% of the programs considered had no women directors of photography, 81% had no women editors, 76% had no women directors, and 73% had no women creators.\n\nWomen accounted for 28% of creators. This represents a historic high.\n\nPrograms with at least 1 woman creator employed substantially greater percentages of women in other key behind-the-scenes roles and featured more female characters than programs with exclusively male creators. For example, on programs with at least 1 woman creator, women accounted for 69% of writers versus 20% on programs with no women creators.\n\nPrograms with at least 1 woman executive producer featured more female protagonists, and more women in other key behind-the-scenes positions, than programs with exclusively male executive producers. For example, on programs with at least 1 woman executive producer, women accounted for 39% of writers. On programs with exclusively male executive producers, women comprised 12% of writers.\n\nCenter for the Study of Women in Television and Film\n\nOf the more than 4,300 episodes produced in the 2019-20 season, the portion helmed by directors of color grew to 32%.

African American females 5.2%, Asian American males 4.3%, Asian American females 2.1%, Caucasian males 43.3%, Caucasian females 23.4%, Latino males 4.8%, and Latino females 2.4%.\n\nDGA\n\nWomen in TV\n\nConstituting slightly more than half of the population, women remained underrepresented on every front but among digital scripted leads:\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among broadcast scripted leads (37.5 percent)\n\nNearly proportionate representation among cable scripted leads (45.3 percent)\n\nProportionate representation among digital scripted leads (50.2 percent)\n\nGreater than 2 to 1 among broadcast scripted show creators (24.1 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among cable scripted show creators (29.0 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among digital scripted show creators (29.2 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among broadcast episodes directed (30.6 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among cable episodes directed (31.3 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among digital episodes directed (33.4 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among credited broadcast writers (41.1 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among credited cable writers (42.8 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among credited digital writers (42.0 percent)\n\nUCLA\n\nPeople of Color in TV\n\nThough people of color were approaching proportionate representation among cable and digital scripted leads, they remained underrepresented on every industry employment front:\n\nNearly 2 to 1 among broadcast scripted leads (23.2 percent)\n\nApproaching proportionate representation among cable scripted leads (33.6 percent)\n\nApproaching proportionate representation among digital scripted leads (31.0 percent)\n\nGreater than 4 to 1 among broadcast scripted show creators (9.8 percent)\n\n2 to 1 among cable scripted show creators (20.6 percent)\n\nLess than 3 to 1 among digital scripted show creators (14.7 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among broadcast episodes directed (25.8 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among cable episodes directed (27.2 percent)\n\n2 to 1 among digital episodes directed (21.7 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among credited broadcast writers (26.4 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among credited cable writers (28.6 percent)\n\nLess than 2 to 1 among credited digital writers (24.2 percent)\n\nUCLA\n\n2019\n\nOf the 50 most-watched children’s shows:\n\nBlack girls and women are 6.5% of the US population, 6.2% of all characters, and 6.4% of leading characters.\n\nBlack girls and women are more likely to be shown as attractive (48.5%) compared to other women of color (44.6%) or white women (41.6%).\n\nBlack women are more likely to be shown in a STEM occupation (5.6%) than other women of color (3.0%) or white women (3.3%).\n\nMore Black female characters are shown as leaders than other women of color or white women (40.9% compared with 36.0% and 34.6%, respectively).\n\nBlack female characters are far more likely to be shown as “smart” than other female characters of color and white female characters (32.7% compared to 22.2% and 26.4%, respectively).\n\nBlack female characters and other female characters of color are twice as likely as white female characters to be shown with a degree of nudity (5.2% and 4.9% compared with 2.5%).\n\nCompared to white female characters, Black female characters and other female characters of color are twice as likely to be shown in revealing clothing (10.7% and 8.7% compared with 4.5%).\n\nBlack female characters are more likely than white female characters and other female characters of color to be verbally objectified by other characters in family TV (1.4% compared with 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively).\n\nWhite female characters are more likely to have an occupation (89.6%) than Black female characters (70.5%) or other female characters of color (58.8%).\n\nBlack female characters are twice as likely as white female characters and other female characters of color to be shown in a service industry job (56.3% compared to 26.4% and 20.6%, respectively).\n\nBlack women (5.6%) are less likely than white women (8.7%) and other women of color (11.0%) to be shown in a romantic relationship, but more likely to be shown as having at least one sexual partner.\n\nGeena Davis Institute on Gender in Media\n\nEmployed television writers:\n\n43.5% were women; 35.3% were BIPOC.\n\n26.7% were white women; 19.1% were BIPOC women; 15.9% were BIPOC men.\n\nWhite women represented 27.6% of staff writers, 27.1% of story editors, 23.5% of executive story editors, 23.6% of co-producers, 27.2% of producers, 30.3% of supervising producers, 23.1% of consulting producers, 30.2% of co-executive producers, 20% of executive producers, and 25.1% showrunners.\n\nBIPOC women accounted for 30.4% of staff writers, 35.6% of story editors, 31.3% of executive story editors, 24.7% of co-producers, 29.6% of producers, 26.3% of supervising producers, 11.5% of consulting producers, 17.1% of co-executive producers, 7.7% of executive producers, and 8.2% of showrunners.\n\nBIPOC men comprised 17.5% of staff writers, 17.8% of story editors, 31.3% of executive story editors, 22.5% of co-producers, 21% of producers, 18.2% of supervising producers, 16.7% of consulting producers, 16.7% of co-executive producers, 11.6% of executive producers, and 10.3% of showrunners.\n\nWGA West\n\n2018-2019\n\nOf the most popular 200 scripted shows in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and New Zealand:\n\nOf the 8,885 speaking or named characters, only 98 or 1.1% were Muslim. This translates into 89.7 non Muslim characters to every 1 Muslim character. Yet there are 1.9 billion Muslims accounting for 24.9% of the total worldwide population.\n\nThree shows in 2018 accounted for the largest number of Muslims per series: “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” (33 characters), “Next of Kin” (19 characters), and “Our Girl” (9 characters). After removing these shows, 2018 (26 Muslims coded) series still had numerically more than twice as many Muslim speaking characters than did 2019 (11 Muslims) series.\n\n13% (n=26) of shows depicted one or more Muslims across the first three episodes evaluated. This variable deviated marginally by year, as 17% of shows featured at least one Muslim character in 2018 and 9% in 2019.\n\n87% (n=174) of series erased Muslim speaking characters altogether. Of the remaining shows, the mode or most frequent number of Muslim characters in a series was 1 (8% or 16 programs). One percent of shows (n=2) had 2 Muslim characters, 2% (n=4) had 3 Muslim characters, and 2% (n=4) had 4 or more.\n\nOf the 98 Muslim characters, only 12 were series regulars. Half of the Muslim series regulars were in the U.S. sample of shows and only 2 series regulars appeared in the 2019 sample (Wendell Pierce, “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” Ali Karim, “Shortland Street”).\n\n60.2% (n=59) of Muslim speaking characters on screen were inconsequential. Fifty-two (59.8%) of the 87 Muslim speaking characters were inconsequential to the plot in 2018 and 7 (63.6%) of 11 were in 2019. By country, U.S. shows were far more likely than international shows to feature inconsequential Muslim speaking characters on screen (71.7%, 42.1%, respectively). The ratio of inconsequential Muslim characters is 4.92 to every 1 series regular.\n\nOf the 98 Muslim speaking characters, 69.4% were male (n=68) and 30.6% (n=30) were female. This pattern deviated substantially from the overall sample where 41.7% of non Muslim speaking characters were girls and women.\n\nNo Muslim speaking characters were coded as non binary. 180 series erased or did not feature at least one male Muslim speaking character and 184 erased or did not feature at least one female Muslim speaking character.\n\nMuslim speaking characters were most likely to be Middle Eastern/North African (52%, n=51), followed by Asian (28.6%, n=28) and Black (13.3%, n=13). Few Muslim speaking characters in the sample were White (2%, n=2), Hispanic (1%, n=1), or multi-racial/multi-ethnic (3.1%, n=3). While the majority of Muslim speaking characters were MENA, only 37.5% (n=51) of all MENA characters sample wide (n=136) were Muslim.\n\nU.S. series were more likely to showcase MENA Muslims and international series were more likely to showcase Asian and Black Muslims.\n\nOf the 98 Muslim characters, 0 were young children (0-5 years), 13.4% (n=13) were children (6-12 years), 10.3% (n=10) were teens, 48.5% (n=47) were young adults, 25.8% (n=25) were middle aged and 2.1% (n=2) were elderly. There were no Muslim children 0-5 years of age across the entire sample. Only 2 elderly speaking characters were coded as Muslim and none appeared in the U.S. sample or across 100 popular shows in 2019.\n\nAcross the 98 Muslim speaking characters, only one was part of the LGBTQ community. That character was a 21-to-39-year-old Asian lesbian who played a supporting role in the U.K. series “Next of Kin.” No gay, bisexual, or transgender Muslims were depicted. Not one Muslim speaking character was shown with a significant and persistent cognitive, communicative, and/or physical impediment.\n\nOf the 98 Muslim characters, 45.9% (n=45) lived in Muslim-dominated countries or areas. The remaining 54.1% (n=53) of Muslim characters lived in countries that were not Muslim-dominated (e.g., U.S., U.K., India, France, New Zealand). Only 13.3% (n=13) of all Muslim characters were native to non-Muslim dominated countries, while 2 were immigrants.\n\nLess than one-third (31.6%, n=31) of Muslim characters spoke English as their native language, compared to 63.3% (n=62) who were native speakers of another language, and 5.1% (n=5) whose portrayal was too brief to be evaluated for this measure. Of the 62 non-native English speakers, 51.6% (n=32) spoke accented English while the remaining 48.4% (n=30) of characters spoke only in non-English languages, such as Arabic, French, Urdu, and Hausa.\n\n51 characters (60%) were shown with an occupation. Male Muslim characters (78.4%, n=40) were more likely than female Muslim characters (21.6%, n=11) to be employed. The highest percentage of Muslim characters (37.2%, n=19) were involved with criminal activities while 15.7% (n=8) of Muslim characters worked in law enforcement. Other Muslim characters held occupations outside of the justice system. Roughly one-fifth (19.6%, n=10) of Muslim characters were shown with careers in healthcare, while the remaining characters held jobs in religious domains (7.8%, n=4), in travel and logistics jobs (7.8%, n=4), financial services (3.9%, n=2), politics (2%, n=1), media (2%, n=1), personal care (2%, n=1), and retail (2%, n=1).\n\n30.6% (n=30) of characters perpetrated violent actions against another character. These individuals primarily used firearms (43.3%, n=13), though characters were also shown with bombs or vests with explosive devices (36.7%, n=11) and using natural means (e.g., punching, kicking; 26.7%, n=8) to attack and physically harm others. The majority of the Muslim perpetrators of violence were in roles that defined them as antagonists to the plot (76.7%, n=23).\n\nNearly 40% of Muslims were also targets of violence (38.8%, n=38). More than half of these victims (52.6%, n=20) were the story’s antagonists or affiliated with villains. 12.2% (n=12) of all Muslim characters died during the first three episodes evaluated. All died by violent means.\n\nNearly half of Muslim characters (49%, n=48) made some form of verbal reference that was indicative of their faith while 23.5% of characters (n=23) were identified as Muslim through non-verbal depictions. Expressions of Islam were also shown through tangible artifacts and clothing. Only 11 characters (11.2%, 5 secondary and 6 tertiary characters) were presented with artifacts affiliated with their Muslim identity. More than half of Muslim characters (52%, n=51) were shown wearing attire related to or affiliated with Islam. Twenty-two of the Muslim women in popular series distinctly wore hijabs, including in non-Muslim dominated settings. Men’s attire was more diverse, including kurtas, topis, ghutras, and thobes.\n\nA consistent theme across the way Muslim girls and women are characterized: they experience fear and peril, typically at the hands of men. Muslim women experienced both emotional distress as well as physical danger. Muslim girls and women were shown to be fearful, upset, or anxious about a variety of circumstances. Physical peril was also common for Muslim women who faced direct threats and actual violence, including the threat of sexual violence.\n\nAlthough there were 39 primary or secondary Muslim characters across the series evaluated, only 12 Muslim characters held series regular roles. These rolesoffered the greatest opportunity to showcase diversity within the Muslim community. Series regulars appeared in 5 programs across the sample. Compared to the full sample, Muslim series regulars were less likely to be women, and more likely to be Middle Eastern/North African and Asian. In terms of genre, 65% of the series (n=130) were dramas and 35% (n=70) were comedies. Of the 26 series featuring Muslim characters, however, only 11.5% (n=3) were comedies while 88.5% (n=23) were dramas.\n\nInclusion Initiative\n\nOf all U.S. Netflix shows 2018-2019:\n\n57.7% of all 2019 series were filled with female-identified leads/co leads versus 50.6% in 2018.\n\nAlmost half of the main cast across series (47.3%) were female-identified.\n\nThe percentage of female-identified speaking characters in 2018 (39.9%) was roughly the same as it was in 2019 (41%), and in line with the broader TV industry (40% in 2018, 45% in 2019).\n\n32.8% depicted gender-balanced or majority female-identified casts.\n\nUnderrepresented main cast increased 11.4 percentage points (2018=27%, 2019=38.4%).\n\nThe percentage of underrepresented speaking characters (35.2%) was similar to the industry norm (35.4%) and increased over time (2018=32%, 2019=38%).\n\n33.1% featured a majority of leads/co leads who were white males, 22.9% featured mainly white females, 10.3% underrepresented males, and 9.1% underrepresented females. The figures for underrepresented male and female leads/co leads did not change significantly over time. For underrepresented male and female leads/co leads, Netflix series fell far below proportional representation.\n\nWhite men and boys comprised 36.2% of the main cast, white girls and women 30.7%, underrepresented boys and men 16.5%, and underrepresented girls and women 16.6%. In terms of proportional representation, series achieved this designation for white women in main cast roles, though not for underrepresented men or women.\n\nMen and boys of color in series main cast increased from 2018 to 2019 (13.3% to 19.4%), as did underrepresented women and girls (13.8% to 19.1%). Netflix content showed significant improvement for girls and women of color in main cast roles from 2018 to 2019 overall and by storytelling type, but continued to over-represent white boys and men in main cast roles compared to population figures.\n\n39.3% of speaking characters were white males, 25.5% were white females, 19.9% were underrepresented males, and 15.3% were underrepresented females. Once again, Netflix achieved proportional representation to the U.S. Census only for underrepresented male characters.\n\nOnly 2 scripted shows had a majority of leads/co leads who were LGBTQ.\n\nNetflix series featured LGBTQ main cast in 6.1% of roles, which was consistent over time (2018=4.6%, 2019=7.4%). Netflix series were also similar to the representation of LGBTQ series regulars in primetime broadcast programs (2018=6.4%, 2019=8.8%) each year.\n\nOver two years, 3.3% of series characters were LGBTQ, which did not deviate meaningfully from 2018 to 2019.\n\nFewer than 1% of all series featured a majority of leads/co leads with a disability.\n\n5.1% of main cast were shown with a disability. In 2018 (Netflix=5.2%, industry=1.8%) and 2019 (Netflix=5%, industry=2.1%), there were no significant differences between Netflix and series regulars with a disability in primetime broadcast shows.\n\n2.4% of speaking characters in series had a disability, which was consistent from 2018 (2.4%) to 2019 (2.5%).\n\n29.8% of show creators were women. A significant increase in the percentage of women show creators was observed from 2018 (26.9%) to 2019 (32.2%).
