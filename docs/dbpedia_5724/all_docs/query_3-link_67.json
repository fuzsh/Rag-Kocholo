        "text": "One of the many weird but understandably overlooked remarks made by former President Donald Trump last week at the National Association of Black Journalists convention was his observation that it “makes no difference” whom a presidential candidate selects as a running mate because the vice president designee has “virtually no impact.”\n\nIt was the ex-president’s questioning of the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris that has rightfully received the most attention at the conclave. But his observations about the Vice presidency warrant attention, too.\n\nApart from minimizing the big build-up he gave his selection of Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and then throwing him under the bus, the ex-president once again shows his ignorance of history, including Minnesota’s and his own. His running mate echoed his views a few days later, stating that the vice presidential pick “doesn’t really matter.”\n\nThese observations are even more noteworthy in light of the selection Tuesday of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as the Democratic candidate for that position.\n\nConsequential candidates\n\nWhile polling suggests that vice presidents do not cause a large number of voters to cast a ballot for someone they would not otherwise have supported, their selection is not inconsequential.\n\nThere have been many occasions in which the identity of the VP helped a ticket prevail dating back to “Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too,” the first significant presidential election slogan in which the presence of Southerner John Tyler from Virginia helped carry a few key states in that region for William Henry Harrison from Indiana in ousting the incumbent, New Yorker Martin Van Buren, in 1840. Tyler then took over as president when Harrison died a month after his inauguration.\n\nAbraham Lincoln’s dropping of Maine’s Republican Hannibal Hamlin, his first term VP, for a Tennessee Democrat, Andrew Jackson, helped Honest Abe solidify his reelection in 1864 by appealing to pro-Union Democrats in the North, so much so that they ran in a newly-named Union Party ticket.\n\nFast forward a century and it was John F. Kennedy’s placement of Texan Lyndon B. Johnson on the “Boston-Austin” ticket that secured the Lone Star State crucial to his victory in 1960.\n\nTrump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, chose Joe Biden in 2008 largely because of his foreign policy stature, adding to their joint credibility to defeat the rival GOP tandem that included vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. She undoubtedly was a drag on the ticket as the most sizable hot-potato VP choice since Dan Quayle 20 years earlier, although he managed not to submerge the ticket headed by then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. That dubious selection prompted his son a dozen years later to be more circumspect in adding more gravitas to the GOP team with Dick Cheney as his victorious vice president.\n\nMuch Matters\n\nThe experiences of the two previous Minnesota vice presidents, whom Walz hopes to join, also belie the Trump-Vance view.\n\nWhile LBJ was headed to an easy victory in 1964, his selection of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, former head of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, as vice president appealed to the left wing of his party and helped boost him to a landslide.\n\nA dozen years later, by picking Walter Mondale, Humphrey’s successor in the U.S. Senate, Jimmy Carter added some helpful inside-the-Beltway stature to his outsider’s posture.\n\nAnd then there’s the former president himself, who ought to recall that his selection of Mike Pence as his vice president helped attract Christian Evangelicals to their side before he decided he didn’t want him hanging around any longer during the January 6 attempted insurrection.\n\nBy the way, that episode — Pence’s refusal to give in to the entreaties to deny certification of the election — refutes Vance’s “doesn’t really matter” declaration since Vance himself has said he would not have validated the vote, throwing the election — and the country — into chaos, and he presumably is prone to do likewise if another opportunity arises in, say, 2029.\n\nThat would seem to “matter” much.\n\nAdministration appointments\n\nIn addition to disregarding historical reality, the ex-president’s choice of Vance provides a window into the cast of characters who would populate a second Trump administration. Not surprisingly, they would be Vance-types: inexperienced, bombastic, right-wing extremists taking their cues from Project 2025 with unabashed and unquestioned loyalty to the president.\n\nThe first Trump administration was replete with grifters, ideologues, knaves and overmatched personnel. But there were a few who comprised the guardrails that prevented going over the cliff that was perpetually looming. Officials like Chief of Staff General John Kelly and another military man, General H.R. McMasters, who headed the National Security Council, were among the handful of level headed guardians.\n\nBut the selection of Vance and everything that he stands for — and against — vivifies what to expect from Trump II appointees. The guard rails will be gone.\n\nIt cannot be known specifically who would populate a Trump-Vance administration. But two things seem certain: they won’t be childless and they won’t have any cats.\n\nMarshall H.
