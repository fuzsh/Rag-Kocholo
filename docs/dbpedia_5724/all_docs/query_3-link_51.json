        "text": "The student’s name must match the name listed in the ODU system to be processed. For example, if your name listed with VMSDEP is Bobby Smalls, the ODU name listed must also be Bobby Smalls. It cannot be Bob Smalls or Robert Smalls. VMSDEP funds cannot be processed if the student names do not match in both systems. The student’s domicile must also be determined. Submit the request for instate tuition form or contact the Office of the Registrar for assistance. Students with a pending domicile status cannot be processed.\n\nVMSDEP can only pay the authorized term tuition. Late fees may be assessed if the student is not listed in the portal timely and will be the responsibility of the student.\n\nApproval for late submission of VMSDEP request for awarding of benefits will be at the discretion of the ODU Office of Financial Aid.\n\nRetroactive Waivers: ODU does not approve tuition waivers retroactively. Eligible waivers are applied to current and/or future terms as determined by DVS. Student’s name must be on the semester roster in the VMSDEP portal by the last day of the current term for the waiver to be applied to that term.\n\nFollow the VMSDEP application deadline guidelines to ensure you are approved for the semester you want to start the benefit.\n\nVMSDEP Award Information\n\nAs a state veterans’ benefit, the VMSDEP will be included as a financial resource in your financial aid package and may reduce state grants*, university grants or scholarships, federal loans, federal work-study, and private loans. Each financial aid offer type is different, so the benefit may affect each person's offer differently.\n\n*A student cannot receive both VMSDEP and state grants. The state grant award will be cancelled once the student is authorized for VMSDEP.\n\nTuition benefits (Tier 1 and Tier 2)\n\nEligible students, as confirmed by DVS, are guaranteed a waiver of all tuition and mandatory fees for eight semesters at a Virginia public college or university and Eastern Virginia Medical School. Please note tuition and mandatory fees are waived.\n\nHousing, dining, books, and supplies are considered educational expenses, however, are not considered mandatory fees and are not waived under this program.\n\nStipend benefits (Tier 2 only)\n\nEligible students may receive a stipend to offset educational expenses such as housing, dining, books, and supplies. SCHEV works with DVS and the public colleges and universities in disbursing funds. The amount of the stipend is determined annually by SCHEV and is dependent on the student's enrollment status; the number of participating students; and available funding. Stipends are awarded later in the semester when funds are received from SCHEV.\n\nQuestions? Contact us"
