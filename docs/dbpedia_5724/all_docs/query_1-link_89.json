        "text": "It's official.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz is joining Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection, speculation started on who would fill the VEEP role. Names such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear were all mentioned as possible contenders.\n\nIn the coming weeks, politicos will debate the choice heading into the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nBut others may be wondering who will play Walz on Saturday Night Live.\n\nWho will play Donald Trump on SNL?\n\nNashville comedian and impressionist James Austin Johnson will likely reprise his role as Republican candidate President Donald Trump. He joined the cast in 2021 and received praise for his portrayal.\n\nWho will play Kamala Harris on SNL?\n\nDeadline reported that Maya Rudolph will return for the 2024 season to reprise her Harris impression. She debuted her impression in 2019 and made guest appearances in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nShe was a cast member from 2000 to 2007.\n\nWho will play Tim Walz on SNL?\n\nLorne Michaels isn't afraid to bring in guest impressionists so the actor may not be on the current cast list.\n\nSteve Martin\n\nIt's hard not to look at Walz and think Steve Martin would be the perfect doppelganger. Martin has hosted the show 16 times and made dozens of special guest appearances.\n\nDarrell Hammond\n\nIs there anyone Darrell Hammond couldn't impersonate? Hammond was a cast member from 1995 to 2009, has made several cameos and took over as announcer in 2014. Could Hammond go back in front of the live audience? Remember Hammond has impersonated everyone from President Bill Clinton to William Shatner from John McCain to Jimmy Carter.\n\nMikey Day\n\nAs for a current cast member, Mikey Day may be suited to take on the impression. He started as a writer in 2013 and was added as a featured player in 2016. He has a variety of impressions including Elon Musk, Roy Moore, and Donald Trump Jr. and has even impersonated Joe Biden.\n\nLarry David\n\nThe viewers wanted the SNL writing alum to play Sen. Bernie Sanders and David delivered. He impersonated him from 2016 to 2020 and hosted once during that season.\n\nWhat is an Impossible burger made of? : Here's a look at the vegetarian patty\n\n'SNL' cast departures: Punkie Johnson, Molly Kearney exit\n\nSomeone else\n\nThe official 50th season cast list has not yet been released. A new addition may step into the role as well.\n\nWhen is the next season of SNL?\n\nThe 50th season of SNL is scheduled for Sept. 28."
