        "text": "Jackson Walker is pleased to welcome William T. Johnson as a partner in the Houston office. Mr. Johnson joins the Firm from Nathan Sommers Jacobs and adds even further depth and distinction to Jackson Walker’s robust Real Estate and Finance practice groups.\n\nMr. Johnson is a veteran banking lawyer with more than 30 years of experience representing banks, developers, and investors in commercial and real estate financings. He represents clients in all types of secured and unsecured commercial lending transactions, including syndicated credit facilities and the financing of complex commercial transactions. He has extensive experience in complex workouts and restructures of commercial transactions and has represented commercial banks, financial institutions, developers, and other borrowers in real estate transactions. He also spent four years based in Dubai representing multi-national companies in cross border transactions across the Middle East.\n\nMr. Johnson is AV-rated by Martindale Hubbell. He received his B.S. degree in Finance from the University of Virginia and his J.D. degree, cum laude, from Washington and Lee University School of Law, where he was a member of the Order of the Coif and worked on the Washington and Lee Law Review.\n\n“Bill is a terrific addition to our team,” said Kurt Nondorf, managing partner of Jackson Walker’s Houston office. “His finance practice aligns perfectly with the type of work we do, and his expertise and experience complement our group very well.”\n\nWith several significant additions over the past two years, Jackson Walker now boasts 20 lawyers in Houston and more than 50 attorneys firmwide who are dedicated to Real Estate law, making the Firm’s group one of the largest and most experienced in the region.\n\nLike other high-profile attorneys who have made the move to Jackson Walker recently, including Alfie Meyerson, Thad Armstrong, David Jones, Lewis Kasner, and David Robins from Thompson Knight, Mr. Johnson found both the Firm’s Texas-friendly culture and its competitive overhead costs attractive.\n\n“The fact that we continue to attract top talent from other law firms shows that there’s something good going on here,” said Wade Cooper, Jackson Walker’s firmwide managing partner. “For Texas attorneys whose clients require an efficiently managed law firm with first-class resources, Jackson Walker is the place to be.”\n\nJackson Walker has 125 years of experience in providing legal counsel to clients throughout Texas, the United States, and internationally. The Firm provides a strong regional base of more than 350 attorneys in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, San Angelo, San Antonio, and Texarkana."
