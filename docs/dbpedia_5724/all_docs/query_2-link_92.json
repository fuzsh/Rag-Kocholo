        "text": "Emmy Award winning American television writer, director, and producer, Ryan Murphy is a familiar name for fans of most genres. His directorial ventures have spanned multiple genres, including horror, thriller, true crime, drama, musicals, and more. He is most commonly renowned for the TV shows: ‘Glee’, ‘American Horror Story’, ‘American Crime Story’, ‘Ratched’, and ‘Dahmer’.\n\nNext up from the director as an executive producer is a star-packed legal drama that stars Sarah Paulson, Niecy Nash, Teyana Taylor, and Naomi Watts in addition to the previously announced actors Glenn Close and Kim Kardashian!\n\nWhile not a lot of details about the project have been made public yet, it will be titled ‘All’s Fair’, and will come forth from the streaming hub Hulu. The show will revolve around an all-female Los Angeles law firm. The only plotline that has been uncovered so far is that Kardashian will play an LA divorce lawyer in the law firm headed by Close’s character.\n\nThis announcement comes following Halle Berry’s exit from the project due to scheduling conflicts. Tony Award winning actress Paulson recently earned her 9th Emmy nomination, as a guest star in the drama series ‘Mr & Mrs Smith’.\n\nWatts was recently nominated for an Emmy in the lead actress in a limited or anthology series or movie category for her role in Murphy’s ‘Feud: Capote Vs. The Swans’. Nash-Betts won an Emmy for supporting actress in a limited or anthology series or movie for her role in Murphy’s ‘Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story’. Taylor received a National Board of Review breakthrough performance award for her role in ‘A Thousand and One’.\n\nLastly, Kardashian was last seen on the silver screen in Murphy’s ‘American Horror Story: Delicate’. Stay tuned for more updates on the subject!\n\nWe’re hiring!"
