        "text": "Rian Johnson was born in Maryland and at a young age his family moved to San Clemente, California, where he was raised. After graduating from high school, he went on to attend the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. His first feature film, Brick (2005), was released in 2005 and was the metaphorical building block that launched his career. He is a director, writer, and musician, among other areas of expertise.\n\nHis second feature, Brothers Bloom (2008), proved his ability to tell an exciting story with A-list actors, and the visionary Looper (2012) cemented him as a modern science-fiction icon. Among his highest-rated work are three episodes of the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad (2008). His filmography made him a strong candidate to write and direct Star Wars - Episode VIII: Die letzten Jedi (2017), the penultimate episode of the 'Star Wars' series. Lucasfilm was pleased with his work and announced that we would write and direct a 'Star Wars' trilogy separate from the main Skywalker story.\n\nBorn in Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England, Neil Marshall has been working successfully in both feature films and television since his feature debut 'Dog Soldiers' in 2001. His second feature as both writer and director,'The Descent' 2005 was an even bigger critical and commercial hit, winning several awards including the BIFA for Best Director, and the Empire award for Best Horror. He followed this success with the post-apocalyptic action movie 'Doomsday' 2008 for Universal and historical adventure 'Centurion' 2010. In 2012 Neil made his debut in the world of high-end television with 'Game of Thrones' S2 Ep9 'Blackwater', and followed that up with S4 Ep9 'The Watchers on the Wall' for which he received an Emmy Nomination for Best Director.\n\nMarshall continued to work in the network, cable and streaming arenas directing projects such as the pilot episodes of 'Black Sails' for Starz, DC's 'Constantine' and 'Timeless' both for NBC. Marshall also directed notable episodes of 'Hannibal' for Showtime and 'Westworld' for HBO. In 2017 Neil developed, produced and directed the Netflix reboot of classic sci-fi series 'Lost in Space', quickly followed the same year by the feature film reboot of 'Hellboy' released in 2018.\n\nIn 2020 Marshall made his return to independent film and the horror genre with the multi-award winning witch-hunt saga 'The Reckoning' which was the opening movie at Fantasia festival in Canada that year. Marshall's next movie 'The Lair', an all action-creature-feature set in Afghanistan was the opening night presentation at Frightfest 2022 in London and also played Sitges in Spain before being released on Shudder in Feb 2023.\n\nMarshall switched genres yet again for the violent gangster revenge movie 'Duchess', due to be released by Saban in the US in September 2024. Most recently Marshall directed the erotic giallo thriller 'Compulsion' and is developing several projects including WW2 alien invasion thriller 'Invaders', tense action thriller 'Dead Stop' and land speed record drama 'Mach One'."
