        "text": "[theme music] NARRATOR: : The Battle of Gettysburg would not have happened if not for a certain newspaper advertisement.\n\nWhat was the ad selling?\n\nA taxi wreck changed Florence foster Jenkins life forever.\n\nWho is she?\n\nFind out as we all play The Pennsylvania Game.\n\n[theme music continues] The Pennsylvania Game is made possible in part by Uni-Marts, Incorporated, with stores in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nServing you with courtesy and convenience every day of the year.\n\nUni-Marts more than a convenience store.\n\n[music playing] [applause] Now, let's get the game started.\n\nHere's the woman with a $64 question.\n\nThe host of The Pennsylvania Game, Lynn Cullen.\n\n[cheer and applause] Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n$64 question?\n\nIs that what he says?\n\nA $64,000 question.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nLots riding on this one.\n\nShall we meet the panel?\n\nWhy not.\n\noh, my, it's him again.\n\n[chuckles] Uh, Just kidding, of course.\n\nGood to see a familiar face.\n\nSince he last appeared on the pencil game-- Pennsylvania Game.\n\nExcuse me, that is the name of the show.\n\nSteve Wagner.\n\nWhat?\n\nYou're not doing what you used to be doing.\n\nNo.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You're working as a lifeguard in a car wash, for heaven's sakes.\n\nYes.\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: Let's welcome Steve Wagner.\n\n[applause] Millie, Millie, Millie, Millie Bubash, the State College hat lady returns for a third season.\n\nGood to see you.\n\nFor more than 40 years, she's been entertaining audiences with her informative presentations about everything from old age to antique fashions.\n\nMillie, hi.\n\n[applause] And Ted Hanson's a new face.\n\nHe is director of the Pennsylvania film office.\n\nThat means he markets Pennsylvania locations to Hollywood and gets to meet all those stars and things.\n\nHe's also a member of the Pennsylvania Historic Preservation Board.\n\nWelcome, Ted.\n\nHave fun.\n\n[applause] Well, that Pennsylvania Historic Preservation Board might serve you in good stead, actually, Ted, because history has something to do with our first question.\n\n[music playing] NARRATOR: The Battle of Gettysburg, the bloodiest battle of the US Civil War, would not have happened if it were not for a certain newspaper advertisement.\n\nAt the end of June, 1863, General James J Pettigrew was leading his weary confederate troops through Pennsylvania.\n\nAlong the way, he happened to read an advertisement in a recent copy of the Gettysburg compiler.\n\nDid the newspaper ad announced the sale of, A, Horses, B, ammunition, C, bottled beer, or, D, boots?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right, there he was, General Pettigrew and his exhausted men, what kind of an ad did he see?\n\nFor horses, ammo, bottled beer or boots that sent him into Gettysburg and history?\n\nSteve.\n\nHe probably saw two ads, one for bottled beer and one for ammunition.\n\nHe acted on the ammunition one, B.\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: OK. Just a guess.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. Of course it's just a guess, what else would we do on this program?\n\nThe last answers you gave me were all off.\n\n[chuckles] Millie.\n\nI chose B too.\n\nI think ammunition, probably.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Would make sense.\n\nYeah, would make sense.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Sure.\n\nAmmo for sale.\n\nTed.\n\nWell, I don't know this because of my historic preservation interests, I know it because of the movie Gettysburg which was filmed in Gettysburg and how I spent my summer vacation one year.\n\nIt was D. It was boots.\n\n[chime] LYNN CULLEN: It was boots.\n\nIt was boots.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. We've got ammo, we've got ammo, we've got boots.\n\nWhat was Pettigrew looking for?\n\nNARRATOR: The answer is D, boots.\n\nBy the end of June, 1863, General Pettigrew's forces were in bad shape.\n\nMost of his men had worn out their shoes and were marching barefooted.\n\nImmediately upon reading the newspaper ad announcing the sale of fine new boots, Pettigrew ordered his men to detour and march the nine miles to Gettysburg to confiscate all of the shoe stores footwear.\n\nAs his men headed for Gettysburg, they were spotted by Union troops who sent out to intercept them.\n\nThe two sides clashed and the bloody Battle of Gettysburg was underway.\n\nThe three day fight, the biggest and costliest in American history to that point, ended with a Union victory.\n\nWell, with all the dead there, it's probably, I think, safe to say that it was a loss on both sides, frankly.\n\nAnd the Gettysburg National Military Park says that the shoe thing was really just a minor reason for the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nThere were several reasons.\n\nIt's a good story, but apparently, it's not the whole story.\n\nJust to set the record straight.\n\nOK?\n\nOK. TED HANSON: So my answer is right?\n\nNo.\n\n[chuckles] We wouldn't want to mislead.\n\nMILLIE BUBASH: Mine isn't either.\n\nNo, yours isn't either.\n\nLet's go to the next-- TED HANSON: Mine's still good though, right?\n\nLet's go to another question you can get wrong.\n\n[music playing] NARRATOR: Philadelphia is home to a special museum which not only encourages its visitors to touch everything they see, but also rents out exhibits to groups that can't get there.\n\nThe Please Touch Museum founded in 1976, is the first of its kind in the nation.\n\nWhat sets this museum apart?\n\nA, it was specifically designed for children under age 8, B, it was created solely for the blind and visually impaired, C, it features replicas of the world's most famous works of art, or, D, it features hands-on physical science experiments?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right, none of this stern guards looking at you all the time at this museum.\n\nNothing behind glass.\n\nThis museum says, please touch.\n\nIs it for children?\n\nFor the visually impaired?\n\nAre there famous works of art there, replicas or physical science experimentation which you can do.\n\nThe Please Touch Museum.\n\nMillie, what'd you decide?\n\nI like B too, for the blind, but I chose D. LYNN CULLEN: Oh.\n\n[chuckles] What?\n\nWhat?\n\nMILLIE BUBASH: I like them both.\n\nAll right, so what the heck.\n\nTed, what did you like as opposed to what you chose?\n\nOh, what I liked?\n\nI liked what I chose, and it's for kids under 8.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. For critters.\n\nFor little critters.\n\nYeah, little critters.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Steve.\n\nWell, I think you gave me the answer.\n\nYou said, if the guards aren't there to keep you out of trouble, then it has to be for the visually impaired because they couldn't get in trouble.\n\nI took B. LYNN CULLEN: Well, I think some visually impaired people might suggest to you they can get in plenty of trouble.\n\nYeah, well.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, let's see.\n\nLet's see.\n\nNARRATOR: The answer is A.\n\n[music playing] It's specifically designed for children under age 8.\n\n[applause] The Please Touch Museum was founded in 1976 by educators, artists and parents.\n\nTheir goal was to make the museum a place for children to learn about and interact with the world around them.\n\nSpecial exhibits permanently in use there teach children about life, transportation, television, food, and the environment.\n\nA troupe of actors called The Touch Tails performs interactive children's theater at the museum once or twice a month, and also performs at schools and other special events.\n\nIn addition, traveling trunks which contain books and hands on exhibits are rented to schools and libraries on a regular basis.\n\nThe Please Touch Museum was recognized by USA Today as one of the nation's top children's museums.\n\nChildren love it because this is the one place where parents don't say don't touch.\n\nThis museum encourages children to learn by touching everything they see.\n\nMILLIE BUBASH: Mm, not with our kids.\n\nGee, why don't they have a museum like that for people over 8?\n\n[chuckles] I mean, I'd like to touch and have fun and all that kind of thing, but it really helps children and their imaginations.\n\nAnd speaking of imaginations, I'm inexorably drawn to Steve Wagner.\n\nI'm going to say, see me after the show.\n\nWell-- [chuckles] So now, this lifeguard in a car wash, you're not really-- No, no, no.\n\nYou've been looking for all sorts of things to do.\n\nI've worked for a company that made gold yo-yos for wealthy idiots, and it's been an interesting experience.\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: It has.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt has.\n\nSo you've been looking for work because I get that impression?\n\nI move about once a month to avoid paying the rent.\n\n[chuckles] If that gives you a hint.\n\nYou're a survivor, in other words.\n\nSo to speak, yeah.\n\nPut curtains to match the sidewalk.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, that-- [chuckles] Well, you're always welcome here-- STEVE WAGNER: Thank you.\n\n--as you know.\n\nMillie, Millie, Millie.\n\nThe hat lady.\n\n[chuckles] The hat lady.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You know, my father still wears-- he always wore a hat.\n\nMen today don't wear hats.\n\nWell, everybody-- LYNN CULLEN: Unless they wear a baseball cap.\n\n--they're wearing the baseball things.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut that's about-- and the women are wearing the hats with the thing up in the front with a big flower stuck on.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nThat's about it.\n\nYeah, that's about it.\n\nWhere's your hat?\n\nYou usually have a hat.\n\nWell, I usually wear them when I'm doing my shows.\n\nWell, you're doing a show, why don't you wear a hat for us?\n\nWell, I will.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: I didn't even know you had hair.\n\n[chuckles] I don't think I've ever seen you-- I'm kidding.\n\nReally, I'm just kidding.\n\nAll right, Ted, they're making lots of movies in my town, Pittsburgh.\n\nI mean, right now, I think Sharon Stone is there, Isabelle Adjani, Kathy Bates was there, Woody Harrelson is there.\n\nWho?\n\nJeff Bridges?\n\nNo.\n\nAll kinds of people.\n\nReally messing up traffic for you, aren't they?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, they do.\n\n[chuckles] Yeah, they do.\n\nI mean, you try you go to visit a friend and all of a sudden, you're prevented from getting where you want to go because there's a-- they're shooting a movie.\n\nA whole big film crew.\n\nYes, but that brings money into Pennsylvania-- LYNN CULLEN: That's what they keep telling us.\n\n--and it boosts tourism.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Mm-hmm.\n\nIn fact, after Gettysburg, 300,000 more people visited that site than did the previous year.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Wow, that's really neat.\n\nIt really is good for us.\n\nOK, well, later, I want to find out if all these people are really nice and all that and if they're like they seem, they are and all that because they never are.\n\nThey never are.\n\nYou can't imagine the stories.\n\nTED HANSON: Sure, they are.\n\nThey're always nice.\n\nWonderful people.\n\nYeah, wonderful people.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Everybody's wonderful.\n\nEverybody's lovely.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nSure.\n\n[chuckles] Let's go to the next question, huh.\n\n[music playing] NARRATOR: Until the late 1960s, Clinton County was home to the tallest man made structure of its kind.\n\nPasserbys often referred to this Nittany Valley landmark as the 12th wonder of the world.\n\nWas the structure A, a smokestack, B, a silo, C, a TV antenna, or, D, a water tower?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What was that thing in Clinton County?\n\nYou had to crane your neck to see it.\n\nA smokestack, a silo, a TV antenna, a water tower.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nWhat was that, Ted, I got a stiff neck trying to see the top of that thing.\n\nI think it might be a smokestack, but since we're doing TV, I chose C, a TV antenna.\n\nSee now you're getting the hang of it.\n\nYou think one thing, but you vote another.\n\n[chuckles] That's the way we work on this program, don't we?\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd because this is all smoke and mirrors, I did pick A, a smokestack.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: A smokestack.\n\nAnd Millie?\n\nSo what do I know about silos or any-- a smokestack.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: A smokestack?\n\nRight.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Why?\n\nWe have smokestacks and TV antennas.\n\nGuess what?\n\nWe don't have a correct answer.\n\n[chuckles] NARRATOR: The answer is B.\n\n[music playing] Farmer and entrepreneur Eugene Heckman built this 120 foot high silo in 1920 to test a new type of concrete.\n\nThe structure was so tall that it was never filled to the top.\n\nIn fact, climbing the silos outside ladder became a challenge for daring children.\n\nAlthough the Nittany Valley landmark is no longer standing, you may have driven over it.\n\nIt was torn down in the late 1960s to make way for Interstate 80.\n\nToday, it's buried under the highway near the Lock Haven exit.\n\nGood heavens, we have driven over that thing.\n\nHow about seeing how the scoring is going?\n\nOh my, what a depressing sight I just saw.\n\nMe too.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Steve, you have nothing.\n\nMillie, you have nothing.\n\nAnd our newcomer, Ted, two and in the lead.\n\n[applause] And you think that's depressing.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhy are you depressed?\n\nI'm not depressed, it's just the zeros.\n\nBeginner's luck, I'm sure.\n\nTED HANSON: I'm sure.\n\nHey, this is the first clue for our Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nI'll give you three in the course of the program.\n\nGet it right the first time, three points.\n\nThe second clue, two points.\n\nFirst clue, one point.\n\nFirst clue.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh in 1889, he served four terms as mayor of that city and is given credit for the city's Renaissance.\n\n[music playing] He was born in 1889, he served four terms for the FDR of Pittsburgh and he's given credit for the city's rebirth, its Renaissance.\n\nYou ponder that, folks, and we'll just sort of slide over to the next question, OK?\n\nNARRATOR: The Philadelphia Toboggan Company of Lansdale, Montgomery County, is the world's only major manufacture of what?\n\nA, toboggans, B, wooden roller coasters, C, Amish buggies, or, D, black walnut croquet mallets?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh, what do you mean?\n\nThe toboggan company makes toboggans, doesn't it?\n\nOr does it make roller coasters, wooden ones, or Amish buggies or black walnut croquet mallets.\n\n[chime] Weird.\n\nSteve.\n\nWell, in keeping with my losing streak, I picked C, Amish buggies.\n\nGood.\n\n[chuckles] Good, that streak might be alive and well.\n\nMillie.\n\nWell, because I'm going along with Steve.\n\n[chime] LYNN CULLEN: Oh, no.\n\n[chuckles] And losing too, I also picked C. Well, go down together, isn't it sweet?\n\nMILLIE BUBASH: I need company.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Ted, since you seem to know the correct answers, what is it?\n\nI'd like to buy a vowel, please.\n\n[chuckles] I don't think the correct answer is up there.\n\n[chuckles] I really don't.\n\nThey used to make wooden carousels, but-- LYNN CULLEN: Did they?\n\nThey did.\n\nThey did.\n\nThey're very valuable now.\n\nBut I picked-- what did I pick?\n\ncan you tell me?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You picked B. I picked B-- LYNN CULLEN: Wooden roller coasters.\n\n--because it's an amusement Park ride.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, they both were an amusement park, sure.\n\nWell, that's smart, you're using your noggin.\n\n[chuckles] Let's get the answer, huh.\n\nNARRATOR: The answer is B.\n\n[music playing] [applause] The Philadelphia Toboggan Company is the world's only manufacturer of wooden roller coaster stock.\n\nOf the 130 wooden roller coaster rides in the world today, PTC made some part of 115 of them.\n\nFounded in 1902 as the Philadelphia carousel company, some 85 carousels and 65 roller coasters have been built by the Lansdale manufacturer.\n\nThe company's name was changed in 1932 to reflect the 12th century term toboggan, which was used to describe European ice slides.\n\nThe world's first amusement coasters.\n\nI'll tell you, from carousels to coaster cars, if you see Pittsburgh Toboggan Company, PTC, if you see a logo on a coaster ride that you happen to be on at the moment, that means it was made right here in Pennsylvania.\n\nI would never see a PTC logo because any time I get on a roller coaster, which is rare, my eyes are closed, I'm praying.\n\nYou see it on the turnpike.\n\nYou do?\n\nPTC?\n\nPennsylvania Turnpike Commission.\n\n[chuckles] I get it now.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nAnd why don't you be quiet and direct your attention to the screen here for the next question?\n\n[music playing] NARRATOR: Since the late 19th century, Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania has carried a special distinction.\n\nIt is officially recognized as Pennsylvania's first and only, A, \"dry\" community, B, town, C, community to adhere to the state's Blue Laws, or, D, nudist colony?\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: Oh, my, well, I sure hope it's D just for the fun of it.\n\n[chuckles] I hope-- I don't know, is it dry?\n\nIs it nude?\n\nIs it a town?\n\nWhat's the big deal about being a town?\n\nOr is it a Blue Law kind of a place?\n\nMillie.\n\nWell, if I'm going to lose, I may as well go with nudist colony.\n\n[chuckles] That's the spirit.\n\nI love you, Millie.\n\nTed.\n\nI want it to be nudist colony, but it's Pennsylvania's only town.\n\n[chime] LYNN CULLEN: It is?\n\nIt is.\n\nIsn't that weird?\n\nBig deal.\n\nIt's the only town?\n\nTED HANSON: Only town.\n\nEverything else is a borough or something.\n\nOh.\n\nEvery Middlesex borough and farm.\n\nSteve, what did you pick?\n\nI picked A because it has the longest fair in the State and they don't want anybody drinking and making it ugly, so I picked A.\n\nBut he's right.\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: Well, are the people nude when you go to the fair there?\n\nSome.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, some are nude and some are clothed.\n\nMillie, you could be in trouble.\n\nLet's get the answer.\n\nNARRATOR: The answer is B, town.\n\n[applause] [music playing] In 1870, State Senator Charles R Buckalew sponsored legislation which made towns something separate from villages and boroughs.\n\nThe distinction was purely a political one.\n\nBloomsburg applied for town status and received it becoming the first and only town in Pennsylvania.\n\nEven after Bloomsburg discontinued the political structure which made it a town, it was allowed to retain that designation.\n\nSpeaking of retention, the score, both Steve and Millie are retaining their goose eggs.\n\nThey have yet to get a correct answer, and Ted, you have added to your lead, it is 4 zip.\n\n[applause] I'm going for the dinette set.\n\n[chuckles] MILLIE BUBASH: Are we allowed to-- LYNN CULLEN: No, no, no.\n\nAnd you can't have the Broyhill dinette set.\n\n[chuckles] Let's get our second clue for the Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nKnown to some as Mr. Democrat, he created the first fair housing bill in the nation while governor of Pennsylvania.\n\nFour terms as mayor of Pittsburgh, governor of Pennsylvania, credited with Pittsburgh's Renaissance, known as Mr. Democrat.\n\nWho be that guy?\n\nWell, if you don't know it, may be prayer would help.\n\n[chuckles] Let's go to church, as a matter of fact.\n\nLet's go.\n\n[music playing] NARRATOR: The Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal church in Philadelphia, founded in 1794 by Richard Allen, a former slave and Methodist lay preacher, is one of the many historic places that can be found in the city of Brotherly love.\n\nIs Mother Bethel Church A, the oldest property continuously owned by African-Americans, B, the first African-American church in America, C, the oldest surviving church building in America, or, D, the first American church to use stained glass windows?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Mother Bethel AME Church, which was it?\n\nThe oldest property continuously owned by African-Americans?\n\nThe first African-American church in America?\n\nThe oldest surviving church in America?\n\nThe first American church to use stained glass windows?\n\n[chime] Whew!\n\nI'm exhausted.\n\nI'm leaving.\n\nNow, Ted, what did you pick?\n\nI'm confused that I have to stay.\n\n[chuckles] I think there's two correct answers up there, but I chose B.\n\nNo, I didn't.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, you didn't.\n\nYou chose A. I did not choose-- that was the other correct answer, I thought.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, that why you are confused.\n\n[chuckles] You chose A. I chose A because I think it is the oldest property owned by-- OK.\n\nI've been there and that's what I was told.\n\nOK. TED HANSON: OK?\n\nWell, I would choose A too if I were there and had been told that.\n\nSteve.\n\nI thought to myself, this could be the only correct answer I get.\n\nI picked B, so therefore, it's probably A. LYNN CULLEN: You're probably right.\n\nOh, my.\n\nMillie, if you pick-- Well, since Ted thought that B was right and that is what I chose, I'm hoping that it's the right one.\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: Hey, guess what, guys?\n\nI mean, the fact that Steve and Millie are both together on this one, what do you think?\n\nAre they right or are they wrong?\n\n[chuckles] MILLIE BUBASH: Wrong.\n\nNARRATOR: The answer is A, the oldest property continuously owned by African-Americans.\n\n[music playing] Mother Bethel AME Church was founded in 1794 by Richard Allen, a former slave and lay preacher.\n\nIt was established when Allen led a group of Black parishioners from nearby Saint George's Methodist church in protest of an attempt by the church leadership to segregate the congregation.\n\nMother Bethel became the first African Methodist Episcopal church in America.\n\nA blacksmith's shop which was hauled to the land by a team of horses served as its first church.\n\nSince that time, the church, which is graced with magnificent stained glass windows, has been rebuilt three times.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What a beauty of a building.\n\nIt was also an important station on the Underground Railroad during the mid 1800s.\n\nAnd now, I can't wait for this, my favorite, favorite question.\n\nNot only of this show, but maybe of every show I've ever done.\n\nHere it comes.\n\nI love this.\n\n[music playing] NARRATOR: A taxi collision in 1943 changed Florence Foster Jenkins in a remarkable way.\n\nIn fact, the Pennsylvania heiress was so delighted with the side effects of her accident that she waived legal action against the taxi company, presented the driver of the car with a box of imported cigars and launched an exciting new career.\n\nDid Florence Foster Jenkins become, A, faith healer, B, a psychic, C, an opera singer, or, D, a ventriloquist.\n\n[chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: Isn't this wonderful?\n\nI mean, whatever she did, it's too wonderful for words.\n\nShe's in a taxi, it gets in an accident, her life is changed.\n\nDoes she become a faith healer, a psychic, an opera singer, or a ventriloquist?\n\n[chime] Oh, Florence.\n\nBoy, she's a real-- wait till you find out more about Florence, a piece of work.\n\nSteve.\n\nB, but no matter what I say, it's going to be wrong.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Right, right, that's true.\n\n[chuckles] We shouldn't even come to you anymore.\n\nMillie, if you say B, I'm going to [indistinct].. Well, I'll probably never be on this show again, I don't care, I'm going to say-- LYNN CULLEN: Oh, no.\n\n[chuckles] I'm going to say D. LYNN CULLEN: Ted.\n\nDid I say D?\n\nYes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, you said B. Oh, Did I say B?\n\nIt doesn't-- Yeah, that's what I want, B.\n\n[chuckles] You know what, Millie?\n\nMillie, it doesn't matter, you'd be wrong no matter what you say.\n\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n[chuckles] OK, Ted, I was thinking [mumbles].\n\nWell, I think it had to be B.\n\n[chime] MILLIE BUBASH: B.\n\nBecause there's real rationale here.\n\nIf she had psychic powers before the taxi accident, she would have known the taxi was going to hit her-- LYNN CULLEN: That's right.\n\nThat's true.\n\nAnd would have avoided it.\n\nSo, you know-- MILLIE BUBASH: That's what I was thinking.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Brilliant.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nSo are we all right or all wrong?\n\nYou're all wrong, of course.\n\nMillie and Steve-- you're with Millie and Steve, you're wrong.\n\n[chuckles] NARRATOR: The answer is C, an opera singer.\n\n[chuckles] [music playing] [applause] A taxi collision left, would be diva, Florence Foster Jenkins capable of hitting a higher F than she'd ever manage before.\n\nThe unusual career of this Pennsylvania heiress was for many years an in-joke among music critics.\n\nIn one review, Newsweek wrote, in high notes, Mrs. Jenkins sounds as if she was afflicted with low nagging backache.\n\nNevertheless, the portly matron then in her 70s, had regular singing engagements in salons from Philadelphia to Newport.\n\nAnd in October of 1944, Florence Foster Jenkins, who was universally hailed as the world's worst opera singer, somehow managed to sing before a packed Carnegie Hall.\n\nMILLIE BUBASH: I remember her now.\n\nSTEVE WAGNER: Yeah, I do too.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: And the building is still standing.\n\nOh, look at this.\n\nLook at this, our final clue.\n\nCould it be coming to an end?\n\nOoh.\n\nHis 1966 obituary appeared on the front page of the New York Times and described him as a political boss, which was a label he disliked.\n\nWho is this guy?\n\nFour time mayor of Pittsburgh.\n\nCredited with its Renaissance.\n\nWe could use him again.\n\nMr. Democrat.\n\nGovernor of Pennsylvania.\n\nBig enough that the New York Times ran his obituary on the front page in 1966.\n\nOK?\n\nYou're all written up there?\n\nI'm moseying over to you, and I think, Millie, I'm asking-- come on, Millie.\n\nCome on, let's end with a bang not a whimper.\n\nI want to see your answers.\n\nYou want to see my answers?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh, no.\n\nI don't want to show you my answers.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: I don't blame you.\n\n[chuckles] She's got a pickle, Heinz.\n\nShe's got a Schapp and she's got a Schapp.\n\nRight.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK, well, Schapp was governor.\n\nYeah, he was a governor.\n\nHeinz was not, I believe.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, Heinz was not.\n\nHe was never the mayor.\n\nHe made pickles.\n\nRight.\n\nTed.\n\n[chuckles] Now, I am a native Ohioan, so dead Pennsylvania governors, I'm not real good on.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You're not a big-- I know.\n\nI understand.\n\nNo, no.\n\nSo you've got to give me a break here.\n\nBut I'm at least-- LYNN CULLEN: You'll probably get it right.\n\nCome on, let's see.\n\nOf course.\n\nAt least I am consistent.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: David Lawrence, it's still David Lawrence, and David Lawrence.\n\nWell, David Lawrence was a mayor.\n\nDavid Lawrence was a governor.\n\nAnd David Lawrence is dead.\n\nYeah, well, that's good.\n\n[overlapping chatter] That's good.\n\nThat's right and he was democrat.\n\nCome on.\n\nDavid Lawrence.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: David Lawrence.\n\nDavid Lawrence.\n\nOh, boy, Millie, are you getting that sinking kind of a feeling?\n\nWell-- Sorry.\n\nWell you're consistent, and there's something to be said for consistency.\n\n[chuckles] All right, let's find out who's our Mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nNARRATOR: David L Lawrence loved politics and was a devoted democrat from childhood.\n\nDuring his four terms as mayor of Pittsburgh, he represented and fought for the people, especially the underdog.\n\nLawrence mediated labor strikes and encouraged City-wide improvements by passing smoke control and sewage disposal laws.\n\nHe is often recognized as the force behind Pittsburgh's Renaissance.\n\nBut his career was not limited to Pittsburgh, his efforts extended to Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen at age 69, he became the Commonwealth's oldest governor.\n\nIn 1961, he passed the nation's first fair housing bill to combat discrimination.\n\nLawrence remained a member of the Democratic National Committee until his death in 1966.\n\nHis accomplishments are still recognized nearly 30 years later, and although he may not have liked the term political boss, he was considered one.\n\nDavid L Lawrence, a famous Pennsylvanian.\n\nWell, yep, that's the guy.\n\nThe convention center in Pittsburgh is named after him.\n\nIt's called, not surprisingly, the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nAnd for a kid from Ohio, Ted, pretty impressive that you would know that, and not only that, pretty impressive that as a newcomer to this game, you knocked off two old pros, Millie and Steve, running away with this.\n\nDo you have to say old?\n\nWe ought to hate him?\n\n[chuckles] No, come on.\n\nLet's be-- Millie.\n\nMillie, let's be fair sports.\n\nTED HANSON: Do you want a part in the movies?\n\n[chuckles] No, I won't even-- MILLIE BUBASH: Yes.\n\nI won't give the score because it's a total embarrassment.\n\nIt really is.\n\nEspecially for you Millie.\n\n[chuckles] You know maybe you've been wearing those hats too tight, you know.\n\nI think so.\n\nThat could be a-- that could be.\n\nBy the way, we never did show our hats.\n\nWell, show your hats, but Ted, we want to give you something for being so smart.\n\nWhat do we want to give you?\n\nA dinette set.\n\n[chuckles] No, not a dinette set.\n\nA car.\n\nThis is from our friends at Tastykake headquartered in Philadelphia.\n\n[chuckles] Your favorite Tastykake treats there selected just for you.\n\n[applause] Millie and your Easter bonnets.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, panel.\n\nPut that on.\n\nThank you.\n\nPut that on.\n\nIs that-- nice.\n\nLet's take a look at these guys.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nMwah, thank you.\n\nSee you next time we play The Pennsylvania Game.\n\n[applause] Don't I get a hat?\n\n[theme music] NARRATOR: The Pennsylvania Game is made possible in part by Uni-Marts, Incorporated.\n\nWith stores in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nServing you with courtesy and convenience every day of the year.\n\nUni-Marts, more than a convenience store.\n\nANNOUNCER: Meals and lodging for contestants of The Pennsylvania Game provided by the Nittany Lion Inn, located on Penn State's University Park campus.\n\n[applause] [music continue]"
