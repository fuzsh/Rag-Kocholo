I keep meaning to revisit Revolver, too (a film that I initially saw in London when it opened and really didn't know what to make of it; I remember stopping off in the lobby to take a post-film piss in the WC and two blokes who had also seen it, and also happend to be taking pisses at the same time as me refered to it as a "piss take", which was kind of appropriate since we were all taking pisses--needless to say, I had never heard that phrase before, so I had to look it up!).

snatch was the best of the bunch, followed by lock stock, but I don't think RocknRolla was horrible. better than yet another fucking superhero movie.

Gangster #1

The Limey

In Bruges

The Guard

Kill List

Sexy Beast

B. Monkey

Croupier

And of course there are always The Classics:

The Long Good Friday

Get Carter

Night and the City

Don't even get me started on the French crime films!
