        "text": "Gerard Butler, Thandie Newton, Tom Wilkinson and rapper Ludacris have all joined the cast of Guy Ritchie's new film RocknRolla, which began shooting in London earlier this month.\n\nThe crime caper, which sees Butler as a street-smart mobster who walks a thin line between legality and the criminal world, promises a return to the style of Ritchie's early films, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. The story begins when a Russian mafioso sets up a crooked land deal in London and millions of pounds are thrown up for grabs, sparking the interests of various figures from the capital's underworld.\n\nWilkinson will play a top gangster, part of London's old guard, who is quickly losing ground to foreign mobsters, while Newton will provide Butler's love interest as an accountant with ties to the underworld. Ludacris will take the role of an American musician trying to break into the London music scene.\n\nRitchie has also written the script for the film, which will cost about $20m (Â£10m), considered a low budget by Hollywood standards. Butler's star is on the rise after the success of the Frank Miller adaptation 300, in which he played King Leonidas."
