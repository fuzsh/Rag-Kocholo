        "text": "France in August is one of the busiest months of the year as the French go on holiday. So it’s also peak time for events in France in August. While the seaside resorts and popular destinations like the Loire Valley are busy, you can always find peace and quiet in the deep rural countryside. Try the small villages in the south or take in the views, the air, and the space in the mountains of France.\n\nIn particular, August is the month when Brittany comes into its own with so many festivals celebrating Celtic culture.\n\nAnd this year, the Paris Olympics 2024 will dominate the capital.\n\nAnd don’t miss the many vide-greniers fairs held everywhere in August. Half of France is putting on those brocante ‘open-attic’ fairs; the other half is buying old plates, glasses, wooden furniture, old farm implements and more than you could ever imagine.\n\nBrocante, bric-a-brac, vide-greniers and any old tat sales in France.\n\nCheck out these top events in France in August 2024.\n\nTo Aug 2, 2024: Le Festival du film de Lama, in Corsica takes place in a medieval village. Around 20 feature film premières, programs for children, a short film competition and documentary screenings take place in three different places: the swimming pool (great views of the mountains), Place de l’Umbria and the Mercatu in the village’s centre (cushions and pillows provided).\n\nTo Aug 4, 2024: Jazz in Marciac, Gers, Occitanie. This great jazz festival attracts over 200,000 people each year to listen to top jazz musicians in a superb south west France setting. There’s also a fringe festival on the main square.\n\nTo Aug 8: Pablo Casals Festival. Since 1950, world famous soloists, and up and coming young groups, have performed in Prades in Pyrénées-Orientales. The festival, which takes place in historic religious buildings like the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa, focuses on chamber music from Bach to Mozert, as well as contemporary works. Also here: meetings with artists and film screenings.\n\nTo Aug 10, 2024: Festival Saint-Céré, Saint-Céré, Lot. The delightful town hosts a lyric festival with four alternating shows and 40 events performed in the town and throughout the Lot department. The productions then tour France during the following winter.\n\nFrom Saint-Céré you can see the towers of the Saint-Laurent-les-Tours castle where the artist Jean Lurçat lived and worked…and during World War II operated a secret radio for the French Resistance. He’s best known as a driving force in the creation of modern French tapestry in the 20th century.\n\nHere’s the Story of Tapestry in France\n\nTo Aug 11, 2024: The Paris Olympics is the biggest event in France and Europe this year, along with the Paris Paralympics. Paris will see some 15 million visitors to the capital, of which around 500,000 will be British.\n\nHere’s a Guide to the Paris Olympics\n\nTo Sep 8, 2024: Paris Jazz Festival. 25 free festivals spread over the summer take place in the Parc Floral in jazz, world music and Afro-American music (soul, blues). Along with the concerts, there are workshops where you can make instruments from salvaged objects, introductions to percussion and conferences as well as a sound discovery area for children in the Botanic Garden. All concerts and activities are free; there’s a charge for admission to the park.\n\nTo Sep 8, 2024: Le Voyage Estival in Nantes has become one of the most exciting, and original, summer events in France. It’s an urban trail with works of art, some of which are new, others are created. 30 or so different works start at the former LU factory by the Canal Saint- Félix, then continue past iconic sites and buildings like the castle of the Dukes of Brittany and the Machines de l’Isle park with its grand elephant. A green line on the ground takes you along the itinerary. Don’t worry if you miss it; there is a permanent Voyage à Nantes through the city.\n\nTo Sep 22, 2024: Impressionist Destination in Normandy celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Impressionists. Around 150 to 200 events are organised in the main cities celebrating the art: Rouen, Caen, Le Havre, Cherbourg, Giverny, Honfleur, Port-en-Bessin-Huppain, Fécamp and Saint Lô and in other smaller towns.
