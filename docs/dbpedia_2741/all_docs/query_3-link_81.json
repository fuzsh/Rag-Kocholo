That was Last Seen Alive (2022), another one I'd never heard of. Oddly, when I looked into the film after watching it, the actual IMDb score was only 5.6 so Amazon has its wires crossed there but I really enjoyed watching it anyway. It tells us of Butler having yet more marital woes & he's driving his wife to her parents for the two of them to start a trial separation. Along the way he stops for gas and.... she disappears, in broad daylight.\n\nThe gaps in the backstory are gradually filled in through a series of flashbacks and even if the story at the root of the film might not be too compelling and the film might not break new ground, once the stage had been set I found the film to be taut or tense for 90% of the running time. Butler does a great job again and some chewing of fingernails might be required. The ending might be a bit limp but as a slice of B movie action, this is a very pleasant way of spending about 90 minutes. The music's good in it, adding to the tension, & there's a particularly effective scene at derelict farm. 7/10.\n\nRustychain\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 17, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n2,308\n\nReaction score\n\n5,853\n\nPoints\n\n1,443\n\nLocation\n\nItaly\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\n#34,691\n\nI saw that score and assumed a lot of teenage boys had voted.\n\nThat was Law Abiding Citizen we were talking about.

Oddly, when I looked into the film after watching it, the actual IMDb score was only 5.6 so Amazon has its wires crossed there but I really enjoyed watching it anyway. It tells us of Butler having yet more marital woes & he's driving his wife to her parents for the two of them to start a trial separation. Along the way he stops for gas and.... she disappears, in broad daylight.\n\nThe gaps in the backstory are gradually filled in through a series of flashbacks and even if the story at the root of the film might not be too compelling and the film might not break new ground, once the stage had been set I found the film to be taut or tense for 90% of the running time. Butler does a great job again and some chewing of fingernails might be required. The ending might be a bit limp but as a slice of B movie action, this is a very pleasant way of spending about 90 minutes. The music's good in it, adding to the tension, & there's a particularly effective scene at derelict farm. 7/10.\n\nView attachment 1916719\n\nThat sounds suspiciously like a remake of Spoorloos (The Vanishing) The Vanishing (1988) 7.7 | Mystery, Thriller .\n\nRustychain\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 17, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n2,308\n\nReaction score\n\n5,853\n\nPoints\n\n1,443\n\nLocation\n\nItaly\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\n#34,696\n\nI think you've solved the mystery of the mixed up scores...\n\ndavidjohnson\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 19, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n10,236\n\nReaction score\n\n19,490\n\nPoints\n\n5,258\n\nAge\n\n56\n\nLocation\n\nSouth Yorkshire\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\n#34,697\n\nI think you've solved the mystery of the mixed up scores...\n\nI would strongly recommend Spoorloos, which was remade in English by its director in 1993\n\nRustychain\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 17, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n2,308\n\nReaction score\n\n5,853\n\nPoints\n\n1,443\n\nLocation\n\nItaly\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\n#34,698\n\nI've just looked into it & I like the sound of it very much. That will have to be a blu ray purchase for me though. It's available to stream over here but the problem is this.... with Kandahar the other night, even though it's an English speaking film & I can watch it in English, when the Arabic is spoken, that gets Italian subtitles, not English. Or if a film starts with some on screen graphics such as \"In 2008 there was a global financial crisis\", that will be in Italian, even with everything set to English.\n\nThe Vanishing looks like it's Dutch, French & English so that could end up as a real viper's nest so it'll have to be disc.\n\nLast edited: Aug 29, 2023\n\ndavidjohnson\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nAug 19, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n10,236\n\nReaction score\n\n19,490\n\nPoints\n\n5,258\n\nAge\n\n56\n\nLocation\n\nSouth Yorkshire\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\n#34,699\n\nI've just looked into it & I like the sound of it very much.
