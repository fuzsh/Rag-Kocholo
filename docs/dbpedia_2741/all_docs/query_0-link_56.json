        "text": "A smart return to form for writer-director Guy Ritchie, “RocknRolla” puts a positive spin on the term same-old/same-old. While not as tricky and fresh as “Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels” and “Snatch,” Ritchie’s first two London underworld comedies, “RnR” does a much better job of it than his last film, “Revolver.” And it goes without saying that, since Madonna is nowhere to be seen, this has got to be better than “Swept Away.”\n\nWhat we have here is a typically\n\nRitchiean bunch of clashing criminal groups, trying to outfox one another and getting caught up in increasingly Byzantine and bloody complications. This time, the chicanery involves London’s booming (until last month, anyway) real-estate market and, to a lesser extent, the music business (so it’s even more impressive that Ritchie kept his wife out of it).\n\nOld-school hardball player Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson, having a profanely good time) has a great business bribing councilmen into approving outlandish building projects for the crooked speculators who pay big for his services. But Lenny also can get officials to withhold permits from small-timers to whom he’s lent seed money, which he does to a group of working-class criminals called The Wild Bunch.\n\nThey’re led by comparatively decent, charismatic One Two (“300’s” Gerard Butler). In order to avoid ruination, or worse, at the hands of Lenny’s enforcer Archy (Ritchie veteran Mark Strong, who’s also great in Friday’s release “Body of Lies”), the Bunch gets in cahoots with icy/smoldering super-\n\naccountant Stella (Thandie Newton). She’s the go-between for filthy rich Russian Uri (Karel Roden), who has hired Lenny to push his building project through. But somehow the payoff money keeps getting, well, snatched.\n\nIf you can follow that, you should have no trouble dealing with pertinent subplots involving thieving junkies, a punk rock star who’s supposed to be dead, two American record producers played by Jeremy Piven and Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and a purportedly lucky painting that causes as much trouble as any ill-gotten loot.\n\nDialogue is fast and witty and, unlike in most Ritchie films, more or less comprehensible to American ears. Shot quick and dirty on HD, and with a penchant for panning camera edits that works surprisingly well for being so showy, the movie looks both gritty and elegant, what with all of its modern architecture motifs.\n\nThere is a brutal, well-constructed chase. A running gay panic gag turns out to be fairly enlightened, eventually. And Newton’s ridiculously abrupt sex scene isn’t at all what many of us have been waiting for – but it is pretty funny for that.\n\nSure, “RocknRolla” is overplotted and icky violent at times and self-indulgent through and through. But it’s clever, well-played and confidently presented, so it really has the pertinent scam bases covered."
