        "text": "I just watched the really really good\n\nAmerican Fiction - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23561236/reference/\n\nstarring Jeffrey Wright as Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison (he's got a shitload of tv roles but i've never seen him so i guess he plays supporting characters).\n\nI would recommend that you just watch it. I'm gonna say that, as i was watching it my opinion varied, because it's slow - but in the end, every point the film has to make is necessary for the final effect.\n\nDialogue is good, there's some really good scenes, and while it may seem to lack cohesion at some points, you just need to bear through that and they will make sense.\n\nTogether with The Burial and The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial they are my favourite films of the last 12 months.\n\nSpoilers, and maybe you should not click it, this one time.\n\nMonk is a vaguely successful writer in LA. Black, but also quite posh, intellectual, overeducated; and while his books are well regarded by some, they don't really sell great, and his finances aren't doing so great either.\n\nMonk's got middle-age life trouble. His sister dies, his gay brother is gay, his mom is sick, and his girlfriend isn't letting him into the brown tunnel. But what makes Monk FURIOUS, is that other writers, other \"BLAK\" writers, are being showered with praise for writing garbage books that pander to the white suburbanite's prejudices that Black life is all about murder, gangs, drugs, teen pregnancies and absent fathers.\n\nOn night, in a rage, he puts to paper his new book, where he uses every stereotype he can think of, and send it off to the editor to mockingly show how low-effort these books are.\n\nAnd .. you can imagine the rest.\n\nBased on a 2001 novel, it's also got a lot in common plot-wise with Bamboozled. While Bamboozled is very much a culture film, American Fiction is more about being a man. About realizing that, as we struggle to be the best person that we can, often that does not lead to praise, but the opposite, and that to be a person of principles has no other reward but itself.\n\n.. i am not sure that this film can be made shorter. About half of it is spent setting up the main plot, and you could in theory start it halfway and still get all of the principal points; but the scenes that serve as the introduction as well made on their own, so much so that i thought this film was just going to be structured as a series of vaguely related scenes, as they don't really give any clues as to how they will be relevant later on. Monk and the other character are well written, well acted, so really not being able to follow is my fault, not the film's. I mean .. if this was made less nuanced and more sensationalistic - like Bamboozled is - it would probably get a higher vote. Such is life.\n\nMy vote: 7.8/10 (the same as on IMDb)\n\nCinema Paradiso - an Italian movie about the relationship between the projectionist at a cinema and a boy who wants to learn to be a projectionist. The version I watched is the 1988 theatrical release. There is a director’s cut that is half again as long and carries a second story line that the studio chopped out. I haven’t watched that one yet. 10/10\n\ndon't. The original release is WAY better than the director's cut.\n\nmy review:\n\ni have merely perused The Professor and The Madman, instead settling for the 173m version of\n\nNuovo Cinema Paradiso - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/reference\n\nIt would be an interesting read the \"Reception\" section of the Italian wikipedia page; the film is from 1988 but it bombed hard at the box office, only picking up 2 years later after multiple relaunches and heavy trimming, cutting 50 minutes of useless garbage.\n\nThe film is .. should be .. mostly the story of a young child in 1940s southern, rural Italy, who falls in love with the cinema. Salvatore Cascio is the child, and Philippe Noiret (in super-obvious dubbing) stars as his mentor.\n\nThis film sure has that charming quality that period Italian films have, portraying both youth and poverty as blessings.\n\nYoung Salvatore is 12-ish old boy in love with the cinema. He tries repeatedly to fall into the graces of elderly cinema projectionist Alfredo, with little success, until the time comes for Alfredo to take his middleschool exam at the ripe age of 50; he cannot read or write, and Salvator agrees to share his test answers with Alfredo if only he will let him become a projectionist.\n\nThis section of the film takes up most of the runtime. It's got quirky characters attending the cinema, Salvatore's missing dad who went to fight in Russia, a prudish parish priest who wants to censor every kiss out of the films, all that sort of stuff we Italians are so good at.\n\nThen there's also the broader story of Salvatore grown up, both as a young man and later as a successful film director, both of which are pretty horrid, have a different tone from the rest of the film, and due to their protracted runtime, are extremely intrusive.\n\nThere's other films that use this annoying storytelling technique; The Legend of 1900, Once Upon A Time In America, etc, and generally to make it work they would only be short snippets at the beginning and ending of the film. Here, it's ... well, it's those dumb 50 minutes that were originally cut, resulting in a much better film.\n\nI would still recommend \"Cinema Paradiso\" but in the theatrical, 123 minute version. It flows better, it focuses more on what's good and less on what's not as interesting, specifically the character of Salvatore as an adult. Supposedly, he resents his successful life and wants to go back to his youth, but there is very little development, very little meaningful dialogue, just images of an old guy moping around. Likewise, the young-man Salvatore is also far less interesting than boy-Salvatore is, and we are throwin in media res of his story, never setting up why we should care for this guy.\n\nMy vote: 123m version 7/10, 173m version 6/10\n\nWatched on Hulu a few good ones. Most notably is \"No One Will Save You\" 2023. IMDb I would give this an 8/10 dues to the info below.\n\nThe thing I noticed about this movie is the lack of dialogue. There is very little, but the emotions and fear are excellently portrayed by the actress.\n\nI'll insert a spoiler quote from IMBd by Stephen King.\n\nTrivia\n\nJust three days after the film was released on Hulu, Stephen King gave it the highest praise on his Twitter account, where he posted this comment: \"NO ONE WILL SAVE YOU: Brilliant, daring, involving, scary. You have to go back over 60 years, to a TWILIGHT ZONE episode called The Invaders (1961) to find anything remotely like it. Truly unique.\" (25th of September 2023).\n\nA couple others if you are into Horror/ Thrillers are as follows\n\nThe Boogeyman ( I know the name is cheese) but I would give it above average rating. Maybe 7/10 using that scale.\n\nThe Cursed 2021 Not the Korean version, but the UK, France, United States version. Probably a 6.5/10 maybe 7. If you like these types of movies, the setting of 19th century helps it.\n\nIf Voice dubbing or subtitles is not your thing, then pass unless bored. (My wife hates dubbed over movies, prefers subtitles in these cases) TMI there.\n\nThe Accursed 2021 very low ratings, but a decent time passer. I had to go back 4 months in messenger to see what I had to I had told my nephew might like. Pretty sure I had this confused with the above. My history shows I watched them both. But IMDb shows this one was very negatively reviewed. Pass unless bored.\n\nThe links all goto IMDb except the spoiler.\n\nThe first one is by far the best of these listed here."
