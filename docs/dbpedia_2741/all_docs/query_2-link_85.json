An Introduction to a Book on Nineties American Film\n\nJon Lewis\n\nA L M O S T H A L F A century ago, Jean-Luc Godard famously remarked,\n\n“I await the end of cinema with optimism.” Lots of us have been waiting ever since for this prophecy to finally come true. Nineties cinema was destined to be important even if it wasn’t any good. History is sometimes driven by chronology. Events happen because the calendar turns a rare and significant page. The nineties featured two such significant calendar events. First there was the celebration of film’s centenary. Surveys and retrospectives, reruns and retreads of old products and product lines were mounted in anticipation and celebration of the motion picture’s one-hundred-year anniversary. The centenary brought proof positive, if such proof was still necessary, that movies were the dominant art form and format of the twentieth century. Scholars and journalists alike encouraged a reexamination of the classical American cinema, the auteur renaissance, the so-called new Hollywood with an eye on each moment’s importance to “the American century.” The studios viewed the centenary as an occasion for nostalgia and self-congratulation, two sentiments they have always found easy to muster. From mid-decade on, the celebration of film’s past gave way to the inevitable countdown to the millennium. Films staging the end of the world proved to be exciting, profitable, and fun. Toying for an hour or two with some sort of revelation and rapture reflected and refracted a culture that awaited the end of this or that with irony if not optimism. The millennium (on and off screen) promised a sort of cosmic 1\n\n2\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nspring-cleaning. Cinema loomed as a possible casualty. But nobody seemed all that worried. It wasn’t like there’d be nothing for us to watch in the movies’ absence. The way films were made and exhibited changed significantly at century’s end. The vast twenty-first-century entertainment marketplace now features all sorts of new audiovisual products and new ways to consume them (over and over again). Films, some of which are not exactly “films,” can now be projected on screens in significantly revamped theaters, in homes on big, highly resolved TVs with multichannel and multispeaker home entertainment setups, on little screens in minivans and on home computers, or on private, personal viewers we can strap on like those telephones travel agents use. But with all this new gear, and all sorts of new product, will we necessarily get different, better movies? Or might we someday in the not so distant future look back on the ’90s with nostalgia and wonder how things might have been different, if . . . ? This book assumes the historic importance of nineties American cinema and endeavors to examine the key films and filmmakers, the corporate players and industry trends, film styles, and audiovisual technologies . . . cinema as we once knew it before the dust of the twentieth century had fully and finally settled.\n\nSOME QUICK OBSERVATIONS ON THE NINETIES The movie business in the nineties was characterized by an increasing concentration of industrial power among a select group of multinational players. Relevant here are four big mergers—Time and Warner Communications, Paramount Communications and Viacom, the Disney Corporation and Capital Cities/ABC, and Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting (a deal complicated further by an end-of-the-century merger-in-principle with America Online). To this growing conglomeration and vertical and horizontal integration, we can add some significant inter-industry developments: strategic alliances between Internet companies, telephone carriers, cable television outfits, and what were once upon a time just film studios. Nineties Hollywood was dominated by five companies that controlled the industry more completely than the old studio trusts ever did. This conglomeration was accompanied by growing internationalization. As the importance of foreign markets increased, Japanese, French,\n\nTHE END OF CINEMA AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL . . .\n\n3\n\nAustralian, Canadian, and Italian companies, at one time or another during the decade, took control of a major “American” film studio. By decade’s end the term “American film” had become relative, perhaps even obsolete. New technologies radically changed production, distribution and exhibition. Forrest Gump (1994), one of the biggest hits of the decade, ably exploited computer-generated imagery, so much so it made possible, even inevitable, a future cinema in which location shooting and live production might become obsolete. More and more multiplexes were equipped with one or another variant of digital, Dolby sound. The result was not only higher-quality film exhibition but an increasing production emphasis on action-based sound effects (whammies, producer Joel Silver calls them), pop music packages, and MTV video and recording company tie-ins. Exhibition technologies impacted significantly on motion picture production. Much of what we saw on screen—The Rock (1996), for example, or better yet The Matrix (1999)—was made to suit and exploit the new sound and image capabilities of the modern movie house. But despite these improvements, there are plenty of indications that “going to the movies” may be on its way out. A vast array of sophisticated home box office delivery systems and exhibition software and hardware became available in the nineties: hardline cables carrying digital signals, advanced home-TV satellite dishes, the perfect and convenient and cheap DVD, big TV screens and home entertainment components. Proposed tie-ins with tele-computer home information systems in development (and much in the financial news) at decade’s end promised to destabilize the theatrical filmgoing experience even further. We can now envision a not so distant future in which we will never have to leave our houses to see a movie. The rare movie we will leave our houses to see will be exhibited in dramatically new formats (like today’s IMAX) or at new and different sorts of venues (with five-star restaurants, with theme park attractions in the lobby). What made certain films and filmmakers important in the nineties had less to do with relative quality than with success in the marketplace, a success complicated and multiplied exponentially by merchandising, global distribution, ancillary formats, and the multitude of delivery and exhibition systems. The important films were those that seemed to use filmmaking technology best, films that declared in their very form and format their status as contemporary, new, or different.\n\n4\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nWith each big film the ante was upped with regard to special effects, (pseudo-) realism, even gross-outs. Film production resembled nothing so much as a high-stakes poker game, a game in which all the players bet heavy on the audience’s continued desire to see and hear bigger and louder movies. It was a strategy that carried with it the promise of astronomical profits and paydays. But as every good card player and every savvy industry player knows, it was also a strategy that required lots of cash on hand. Only players with enough money to safely play in such a high-stakes game had any chance of walking away from the table a winner.\n\nTHE END OF CINEMA AS WE KNOW IT Just as the 1990s came to a close, I wrote to some friends and colleagues who I think write persuasively on contemporary film and I asked them to take one quick shot at the decade past. The thirty-four essays that comprise this book are their responses. I insisted on brief essays, but that was about all I did to determine things in advance. So, while this anthology does not necessarily present a comprehensive tour through the decade, it does offer an indication of what films, what events, what stories, what signs of a future with or without cinema most interested film scholars at the end of the 1990s. The first part, “Movies, Money, and History,” includes Thomas Elsaesser’s “The Blockbuster: Everything Connects, but Not Everything Goes,” my essay, “Those Who Disagree Can Kiss Jack Valenti’s Ass,” Jan-Christopher Horak’s “The Hollywood History Business,” and Murray Pomerance’s “The Man Who Wanted to Go Back.” These essays examine the ways film history (its unfolding, its preservation, and its retelling) has become inextricably tied to corporate matters. The ways films were made, released, and screened, policed and censored, preserved and restored in the nineties—how film history was made and remembered—bear out that, in the final analysis, in Hollywood, it’s always about the money. “Things American (Sort Of),” the second section, speaks to the increasingly misleading term “American film.” Few films these days are made in Hollywood. And while most of the studios maintain corporate offices in Los Angeles, the financing, production, distribution, and exhibition of so-called American films have become so complex and in-\n\nTHE END OF CINEMA AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL . . .\n\n5\n\nternational these days that geographic borders seem quite beside the point. The three essays in this part—Charlie Keil’s “‘American’ Cinema in the 1990s and Beyond: Whose Country’s Filmmaking Is It Anyway?” Justin Wyatt’s “Marketing Marginalized Cultures: The Wedding Banquet, Cultural Identities, and Independent Cinema of the 1990s,” and Hilary Radner’s “Hollywood Redux: All about My Mother and Gladiator”— focus on how American cinema in the nineties, in terms of investment as well as on-screen content, was a global affair. With the decade only just ending as work on this project began, the task of identifying certain films as somehow the most important, the most indicative of what lay ahead was very much the stuff of educated guesswork. Time will tell whether the contributors to part 3 have chosen films that spoke specifically and only to a certain place and time or if they have identified films that will emerge as classics of a certain style or type of filmmaking that took root in the United States in the last years of the twentieth century. In part 3, “Four Key Films,” Pat Mellencamp, Henry A. Giroux and Imre Szeman, Eric S. Mallin, Frank P. Tomasulo, and Krin Gabbard provide the following short list: The Matrix, Fight Club (1999), The Blair Witch Project (1999), and Saving Private Ryan (1998). What does such a list of important if not good, of indicative if not classic, films tell us about the nineties? What does the list tell us about American cinema as we once knew it, about a new American “cinema” that threatened to emerge at century’s end? It is axiomatic that nineties films—commercial nineties films, at least—were apolitical. A commitment to political correctness at the studios and at the MPAA led to a watering down of content. This was less a political than an economic strategy, as inoffensive films can be marketed to the largest possible audience. The five essays in part 4, “Pictures and Politics,” do little to refute the notion that, with regard to content, nineties American film went soft politically. Instead, these essays reveal the different ways politics on and in films became an issue. In “The Confusions of Warren Beatty,” Dana Polan examines the complex politics of celebrity. Thomas Doherty, in his essay, “Movie Star Presidents,” focuses on the representation of politics on screen. Like Polan, Doherty examines how politics in the nineties became the stuff of cinematic spectacle, subsumed, confused, and conflated with celebrity images. Maureen Turim’s essay, “The Fantasy Image: Fixed and Moving,” discusses the official, federal political reaction to on-screen images, their alleged connection to and liability for the off-screen, on-the-street\n\n6\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nbehavior of impressionable, violent-movie, computer-game–addicted youth. Ralph E. Rodriguez and Chon A. Noriega discuss films that fashion themselves as political, films targeted at niche markets inclined to consume politically liberal insights into the lives of peoples of color in North America. What both Rodriguez and Noriega argue is that even the best political intentions are thwarted by concessions to genre, conventional storytelling, and narrow and naïve attempts to rework timeworn ethnic stereotypes. R. L. Rutsky’s “Being Keanu,” David R. Shumway’s “Woody Allen, ‘the Artist,’ and ‘the Little Girl,’” Marita Sturken’s “Affliction: When Paranoid Male Narratives Fail,” and Alexandra Juhasz’s “The Phallus UnFetished: The End of Masculinity As We Know It in Late-1990s ‘Feminist’ Cinema” all take aim at one of the decade’s most talked about topics, the apparent crisis of masculinity in nineties culture. Rutsky and Shumway focus on two very different male celebrities: the transcendentally handsome and inscrutable star Keanu Reeves and the consistently newsworthy New York Jewish comic actor, writer, and director Woody Allen. Sturken sets her sights on a single indicative film, Affliction (1997). The film, like the Russell Banks novel on which it is based, focuses on a fruitless battle between an abusive father and an underachieving son—two all too familiar nineties men bound by blood and despair. In “The Phallus UnFetished,” Juhasz closes the chapter by examining two very popular and different films: Fight Club and South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999). That these two films represent “male trouble” in the nineties in some interesting or important way dauntingly satisfies the essence of the essay’s subtitle: it’s “the end of masculinity as we know it.” Cinema is of course a visual medium, and as such it has from its start been engaged in setting the standards of physical beauty, even perfection. In part 6, “Bodies at Rest and in Motion,” Elizabeth Young and Jerry Mosher examine another sort of cinematic body: the deformed, reformed, or just fat. In the body of the female monster in the 1935 film Bride of Frankenstein (brought back to life again in two very different nineties films, Frankenhooker, 1990, and Gods and Monsters, 1998), Young finds a deft game with gender and homosociality. Mosher examines the ways certain nineties films depict and exploit images of fat people. Because overweight bodies are so unusual in obsessively fit Hollywood, fat has become an easy way of identifying film characters as outsiders, as objects of rejection, humor, or if they’re lucky, pity and sympathy.\n\nTHE END OF CINEMA AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL . . .\n\n7\n\nMuch was made in the nineties of a supposed indie revolution. After all, a handful of independently produced and released titles did well at the Academy Awards and at the box office. Some of the decade’s most memorable movies (The Blair Witch Project and Being John Malkovich, 1999, come immediately to mind here) were made and distributed by so-called independents. But economic analysis hardly bears out such optimism about an emerging alternative American cinema. The nineties saw a decline in the number of indie distributors and the purchase of premier indie outlets by conglomerate studios. The four contributors to part 7, titled “Independents,” take a long hard look at the alternative scene at the end of the century. Their accounts are, collectively, hardly upbeat. In his Independent Feature Project (Independent Spirit Award) speech, writer-producer James Schamus rants about the impossibility of independence in the contemporary marketplace. Robert Sklar shares Schamus’s frustration as he too contends that the 1990s indie scene was far too closely tied economically and formally to traditional studio product lines. Sklar finds independence only at the far margins of Hollywood, in, for example, the intentionally offensive oeuvre of Harmony Korine. To find the independent spirit, Kathleen McHugh and Murray Smith venture even further from the studio mainstream. McHugh’s discussion of Cheryl Dunye’s The Watermelon Woman (1996) and Smith’s examination of Wayne Wang’s adaptation of Paul Auster’s Smoke (1995) and Blue in the Face (1995) suggest that independence is rooted not in production budgets or in distribution strategies but in a certain way of making movies, a production grammar that was once dubbed a new American cinema. The essays in part 8, “Not Films Exactly,” focus on works even further from the mainstream, even further from the traditional setting of the movie theater. Chuck Kleinhans’s “Pamela Anderson on the Slippery Slope” examines the decade’s most talked about “film”—the home video of celebrities Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s honeymoon vacation. The distribution and exhibition (transmission, downloading) of the honeymoon tape, Kleinhans maintains, promise all sorts of problems and products for the future—films that aren’t really films made available instantaneously to anyone with a modem and an Internet connection. Hamid Naficy focuses on the only other amateur video to attain as much nationwide interest: the beating of Rodney King by several officers from the LAPD. Naficy takes a provocative look at this much-seen artifact, arguing in part that the video operated in terms of\n\n8\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nfamiliar, fictional cinematic images of people of color in American cities today. In “Live Video,” Laura U. Marks ventures to the museum to find films that aren’t exactly films. An offshoot of performance art and performance video, “live video” is the stuff of mixing and matching new technologies to provide an expressive and inexpensive alternative to Hollywood-style filmmaking. The contributors to part 9, “Endgames,” take the collection’s title seriously. Christopher Sharrett, Heather Hendershot, Paul Arthur, and Wheeler Winston Dixon spell out the end of cinema in terms of postmodern irony, cynicism, and exhaustion; religious fundamentalism and fanaticism made widely accessible by clever entrepreneurship and media savvy; the doomsday formulas in disaster-genre pictures and the cinematic stagings of Armageddon in popular Hollywood films; and finally the decline (into oblivion) of what we once used to call film culture. At the risk of complicating matters here at the start, perhaps this is not the end of cinema but rather a transitional period from one new American cinema to another. Perhaps what we are seeing are only new material conditions under which film history will persist. American film has always had a tendency toward repetition (of styles, stars, genres). Even such significant technological developments as the advent of sound, color, and the introduction of TV have only revealed the flexibility and resilience of the industry and the medium it produces. The basic corporate structure that makes and delivers American films is stronger than ever. If there is to be an end of cinema, I am sure it is something these few companies have planned for and are now engineering. Maybe optimism isn’t the right term here . . . Godard was just being clever anyway. So long as there is so much money at stake and at risk, we can all relax. Even if films will soon no longer exactly be films, even if cinema is once and for all (in some specific, narrow way) really dead, it’s not like there will be nothing for us to pay for and watch in the future. The likes of Time Warner and Disney will see to that.\n\nPART I\n\nMOVIES, MONEY, AND HISTORY\n\n1 The Blockbuster Everything Connects, but Not Everything Goes\n\nThomas Elsaesser\n\nEVERYTHING CONNECTS About two-thirds of the way into Jurassic Park (1992), there is a scene where Hamond and Sattler talk in the Jurassic Park restaurant about the nature of illusion and reality. The scene begins, however, with the camera exploring the adjacent gift shop. It is a slightly eerie moment, because it is as if the movie was at this point turning round and looking at us, but in the future tense. Set within a theme and adventure park, which exists only as a fiction, the film invites us to imitate the visitors in the fiction. Insofar as this fiction of a fiction will produce “real memorabilia,” the film is itself an advertisement for the games, gadgets, and toys that one can buy after seeing the movie. It therefore does not come as a surprise to learn that six months before the release of the film, Amblin Films issued a Jurassic Park style book for advertisers and merchandisers, which alone cost $500,000 to produce. In today’s media world—to paraphrase E. M.Forster—everything connects. A feature film, a theme park, a toy store, and a computer game have a lot in common: they feed off each other as they play off each other. When one considers that The Lion King (1994) took $80 million at the box office, but made $220 million as a videocassette, one can understand why commentators have argued that a film today is merely a billboard stretched out in time, designed to showcase tomorrow’s classics in the video stores and the television reruns. Jurassic Park may make the intermedia connections more explicit than most, insofar as it mimics the links within its own fiction, but it also shows that if everything connects, this does not mean that anything goes. 11\n\n12\n\nTHOMAS ELSAESSER\n\nBig, loud, and expensive: Spielberg’s perfect blockbuster, Jurassic Park (Universal, 1992).\n\nAnd yet, since the 1980s, it was precisely as if anything did go and the sky was the limit. The New Hollywood staged such an extraordinary comeback from its premature burial and put on such a permanent revolution of the eternally same, that one has to ask, was it the charisma of the directors that did the trick? Or was it the new generation of stars,\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTER\n\n13\n\nwith their talent agents and deal makers? Was it the synergies with the music business, the new technologies of sound design, of special effects and digital imaging devices? To most observers, the answer to why the contemporary Hollywood cinema climbed back to popularity all over the world was simple: money. However, as one tries to understand the ebb and flow of all this cash, it also seems that money is very nearly that which blinds one’s insights, and not merely because it catches one in an economic or even technological determinism. The energies that feed the system, the aggregates of power that circulate, the creative manias, cunning strategies, and ingenuity that animate the makers, as well as the fictions and fantasies that stir and attract audiences, may find in the exchange of money their most convenient and probably most banal materialisation. But the conglomerates being put together by the software firms, the music industries, the creative agencies, and broadcast television companies are on the brink of realizing—in both senses of the word: becoming aware of, and translating into action—not only economic clout but also political might. DreamWorks, the name that Spielberg, David Geffen, and Jerry Katzenberg have chosen for their new studio, is brilliantly and nonchalantly candid: the manufacture of dreams that “work” (i.e., “function,” but also “do their job”). In order to explore what this job is, I want to look at some of the more internal or micro-links that alongside the macro-level synergies hold today’s media culture together. If the macro-level comprises the profit-oriented connections, the micro-level encompasses the pleasureoriented connections. At the macro-level, it is possible to distinguish further between the “horizontal” links, where everything connects in the world of entertainment and leisure (advertising, consumption, fashion, toys, as well as other aspects of popular or everyday culture), and the “vertical” ones, where everything connects at the level of business, industry, technology, and finance. More broadly speaking, the macrolevel points to the relations that exist between the film industry and other forms of modern capitalist business practice, where the strategies of the multinationals do not differ all that much, whether they produce/sell cars or movies, silicon chips or television programs, computer software or stars, soft drinks and junk food or sounds and images. The micro-level, on the other hand, is at first glance more mystifying, but not altogether mysterious: why do we go to the movies, rather than watch individual films? The micro-levels of pleasure highlight, among other things, the fact that as scholars we may have much at stake\n\n14\n\nTHOMAS ELSAESSER\n\nin the distinction between “film-as-text” and “film-as-event,” but as audiences we evidently have quite pragmatically resolved one of the central but rarely asked questions of film studies, which is not whether a film is “art” or “entertainment,” but whether films are “products” or “services.”\n\nPRODUCT DEFINITION: IS A FILM A COMMODITY OR A SERVICE? The industry talk of money and profits, of merchandising and franchising, of tie-ins and spin-offs, of secondary markets and residual exploitation rights at once disguises and underlines what lies at the heart not only of contemporary Hollywood, but of the American film industry ever since its beginning: the struggle to define a product, to decide what it actually is that it is in the business of. The history of Hollywood could be written as the successive moves to install and define the commodity “film,” while at the same time extending and refining the service “cinema.” As to the first, it has not always been as self-evident as it now seems that a strip of celluloid, a can of film, or “two hours spent in the dark” can be a commodity. As to the second point, the cinema had to oust and/or compete with other providers of the same service, whether we call it mass entertainment or performing arts, leisure activity or popular spectacle. A commodity is something whose value to the consumer is both material and immaterial, something that both enhances the self and can be used to communicate or signify to others. A car, for instance, is a perfect commodity: its material value is as an individualized means of mass transport, but its immaterial value is that of a status symbol, and as a status symbol—say, a BMW—it enhances the self-(image) of the owner and signifies something to others (such as “irresponsible, unmarried thirty-something showing off”). These self-images and the meanings attached to them by the culture at large, however, are not fixed and eternal. They can change over time and are always embedded in history and ideology. In the 1970s, for instance, BMWs in Germany were known as Baader-Meinhof Wagen (after the names of the two leading members of a German terrorist group), because they were the preferred getaway cars during the group’s frequent shoot-outs and bank robberies.\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTER\n\n15\n\nA film, on the other hand, was once quite difficult to define as a commodity, not only because what distinguishes the cinema from an automobile is the peculiar and remarkable convergence of money and culture, of commerce and art. It has also been difficult because a film essentially commodifies an experience, which by its nature is highly subjective and context-dependent. “Film,” too, is material and immaterial, but in a combination that would seem to cut across the distinction between commodity and service, unless one defines the cinema as a “service supported by commodities.” Going to the movies involves all kinds of things other than watching a film. It presupposes the simultaneous coexistence of two systems. One, we can now say, is concerned with turning an experience into a commodity: the film as it lives in the collective mind as an event. The other is concerned with providing a service: the theater, the comfortable seats, the ice cream and soft drinks, as they provide the pleasant atmosphere of simulated luxury for time out with friend or lover. Going to the movies is an activity in which the film is only one of the elements, and maybe sometimes not even the most crucial or memorable one. The cinema, once one looks at it as both an industry and a culture, is really these two systems sitting on top of each other, loosely connected, or rather connected in ways intriguingly intertwined. One is the system that links a space and a site to bodies endowed with perception via a certain set of expected and anticipated pleasures or gratifications. The other system is that which connects writers, directors, producers, cinematographers, actors, and moneymen around an activity called making a film. That the two systems have very little to do with each other is indicated by the fact that some filmmakers can make films that never get shown in cinemas, and some films do not get made until they are already sold to the cinemas. When one thinks of how many films get shown at festivals like Cannes or Berlin and how few of them end up getting general release, one cannot but conclude that the system is wasteful and doesn’t work. It just does not seem to “connect” in a meaningful, rational way to audiences. The structure of desire that the movies work on is a well-known one: we enjoy the cinema as legitimized voyeurism, accessing the lives of others, but we also apprehend the films as a mirror of the self. If this is a notoriously complex theoretical issue, it nonetheless also comes down to some simpler points, one of which is the importance of repetition, of doubling, which we can picture as a movement of enfolding or mise-en-abîme. The same as different: genre cinema and the norms of\n\n16\n\nTHOMAS ELSAESSER\n\nstory construction involve the self in remembered pleasure and anticipated memory, both of which lock the spectator into a kind of repetition compulsion that ties the cinema experience to recollection and expectation. These shifting structures of temporality and the moment, of place and space not only constitute key aspects of human subjectivity, they generate a subjectivity (in the form of “desire” or “fantasy”) that can be attached to objects and products. This is what we understand by “commodity fetishism,” because what defines the commodity in this context is precisely the ability of an object to attract and fix a desire or a fantasy. When buying a movie ticket, we are effectively taking out a contract, by which in exchange for our money, we are guaranteed (temporary access to) a normative, quality-controlled product. Conversely, our part of the deal is to be prepared to pay: not for the product itself and not even for the commodified experience it represents, but simply for the possibility that such a transubstantiation of experience into commodity might “take place.” Neither the term “product” nor “service,” neither the idea of “consumption” nor the concept of “leisure” quite capture the nature of this act of faith.\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTER: HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER On the face of it, it is the blockbuster in its contemporary form that combines (in the most exemplary but also the most efficient form) the two systems (film-as-production/cinema-as-experience), the two levels (macro-level of capitalism/micro-level of desire), and the two aggregate states of the cinema experience (commodity/service). When, on a Friday night, we go to the movies, what do we want to see? Nine times out of ten it will be the big movie, which has announced itself like a weather front weeks before, by the turbulence it creates in the news media, the novelty shops, and the department stores. In short, we want to see the movie that promises to be an event. This movie may have many different titles, but essentially it has one generic name: it’s called a blockbuster. What characterizes a blockbuster? First, a big subject and a big budget (world war, disaster, end of the planet, monster from the deep, holocaust, death battle in the galaxy). Second, a young male hero, usually with lots of firepower, or secret knowledge, or an impossibly difficult mission. The big movie is necessarily based on traditional stories, sometimes against the background of historical events, more often\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTER\n\n17\n\na combination of fantasy or sci-fi, with the well-known archetypal heroes from Western mythology on parade. In one sense, this makes blockbusters the natural, that is, technologically more evolved, extension of fairy tales. In another sense, these spectacle “experiences,” these “media events,” are also miracles, and not at all natural. Above all, they are miracles of engineering and industrial organization. They are put together like supertankers, aircraft carriers or skyscrapers, office blocks, shopping malls. They resemble military campaigns, and that’s one of the main reasons they cost so much to make. It is a notorious fact that the cost of moviemaking has spiraled to astronomical heights. Today, the sort of movie that premieres under the conditions just described costs between $80 and $120 million to make, with some like Titanic (1997) consuming as much as $200 million. That’s enough to build 4,000 homes, provide uncontaminated drinking water for 600,000 people for one year, or rewire the telephone system of an entire city the size of Rome. In fact, the only other kind of product that costs as much—and on the scale of basic human necessities is as frivolous as a movie—is an assault helicopter, a set of intercontinental missiles in a submarine, or an atomic test on the Muraroa Atoll in the Pacific. And at this level, the Hollywood story has much in common with the arms race. What Hollywood has done is to have continually raised the stakes: by making filmmaking ever more costly and extravagant, it has made sure that the number of competitors has become smaller and smaller. Of course, I am exaggerating. But the high cost of moviemaking is rather like the membership fees to country clubs and golf courses: it is designed to keep out the undesirables, the upstarts. It is designed to keep most of the world’s countries from being able to afford a film industry. And it keeps most of the world’s independent filmmakers from getting their films into the cinemas. Once upon a time, European nations could afford a film industry. Today, with the possible exception of France, none can: not Italy, not Spain, not Britain, not Germany. Once upon a time, second-run cinemas and art houses would show independent productions. Now, not even the multiplexes keep one screen out of their fifteen for the art crowd, unless it happens to be for a movie that has garnered a prize at Cannes, Venice, Berlin, or Rotterdam. Via its stranglehold on exhibition outlets, the American film industry has achieved the extraordinary feat of being able to open the same film in thousands of theaters on the same Friday night, and within the same month all over the globe. Why should such a feat be desirable in\n\n18\n\nTHOMAS ELSAESSER\n\nthe first place? The answer, of course, lies in the shifting economics of international box office earnings. While Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s could recover its production costs in the huge U.S. home market alone, so that export earnings were pure profit, over the last ten to fifteen years, the foreign markets have accounted for more than 50 percent of the U.S. film industry’s total earnings, making economies of scale in the advertising and marketing of a big-budget picture not only desirable but essential. Not unconnected with the changes in exhibition is a third development by which such tactics of synergy—the new name for vertical integration—have revived the fortunes of New Hollywood. Synergies not only occurred through the new management practices in the production sector (fewer, but more expensive, one-offs and prototypes) and the control of cinema exhibition via the hegemony in distribution. Synergy also affected the management of the software libraries, meaning the exploitation of film and TV rights via cable stations, or the “dumping” practices on foreign (TV-) markets, such as the repackaging of repeats on TV-Gold. The explosive growth of TV channels has proved the importance of owning these libraries: even if a studio was bankrupt, as MGM was, even if all its physical assets had been sold or dispersed, it was still a gold mine because of the rights to old content. Hence Tino Balio’s assertion: “If you’re a big corporation you can never not make money with movies.” This contrasts with the conclusion drawn by James Schamus (producer and screenwriter of The Ice Storm, 1997): “If you are an independent production company, then you can never make money with movies, even if they are successful at the box office and with critics.” Why this difference? The answer lies in the fact that the new integration/synergy model can be seen as a sort of pinball machine. The principle behind it would be something like this: you launch with great force the little steel ball, shoot it to the top, and then you watch it bounce off the different contacts, pass through the different gates, and whenever it touches a contact, your winning figures go up. The media entertainment business is such a pinball machine: the challenge is to “own” not only the steel ball, but also as many of the contacts as possible because the same “ball” gets you ever higher scores, that is, profits. The contact points are the cinema screens and video stores, theme parks and toy shops, restaurant chains and video arcades, bookstores and CD record shops. By contrast, the independent producer only has his little steel ball, and if he is not care-\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTER\n\n19\n\nful, he has to stand by and watch as all the others owning the contact points make money off his/her film. Describing the same phenomenon, Siegfried Zielinski uses an interestingly different metaphor: for him, a film is a Durchlauferhitzer, a machine that heats up cold water, brings it to the boil, and then lots of people turn on the tap and out comes a shower. Combined with television, cable, home video, and DVD, what the cinema heats up is the temperature of popular culture, by giving certain of its products (brand name) recognition value. After bringing together text production and social experience, capital and desire, commodity and service, the blockbuster generates recognition value and thus cultural capital. Yet as a generator of cultural capital, it is not only a moneymaking but also a meaning-making machine. A third characteristic of the blockbuster is therefore that it is a movie engineered for maximum meaning, which is to say its different parts function as a cultural database, in a process that is both “analytical” (it breaks down culture into separate items and individual traits) and “synthetic” (it is capable of apparently reconciling ideologically contradictory associations). Often, the parts are attractions, which come together in the film’s story line, but which in the process of marketing can be exploited separately. Sometimes, the parts are cultural assets, assembled specially for the occasion, validating and authenticating everything they touch. And invariably, the floor plan or chassis is the myths and templates of religion and Western culture. My tag that “everything connects,” but not “everything goes” alludes to the fact that whoever the guests at the party, in the minds and bodies of the audience, the parts must reassemble themselves: their final “fit” is what makes the movie an event.\n\nCATCH THEM YOUNG, KEEP THEM FOREVER: THE DISNEY FORMULA AND THE SPIELBERG CONCEPT This final fit returns me to the “internal connections” or the micro-level. For not only the money, the corporate clout, the production values, or the stars make a movie “big.” It is what these entities represent, what they can “realize.” If delivery of recognition value or cultural capital is the way the “market” puts it, the more metaphysical move would be to say that what these values, accumulated in the blockbuster, realize is\n\n20\n\nTHOMAS ELSAESSER\n\n“time”—paradoxically, not so much the time of the viewing of the film, but time past and time future. Foremost among the strategies with which the blockbuster multiplies, but also organizes the different temporalities, are precisely the kinds of “doubling” or repetition effects with which I started. The souvenir-display-within-the-film, as in the example from Jurassic Park, is only one such enfolding. The same goes for the internal repetitions of the “film-within-the-film,” as in the opening scenes of Titanic. Another modality would be the event-within-the-film doubling the situation of the viewer (as in the films that are released around Christmas and feature wintry celebrations, e.g., Gremlins, 1984), or the films that feature vacations and are released for the vacations, such as Home Alone (1990) and the granddaddy of all modern blockbusters, Jaws (1975). The special thing about a film like Jurassic Park, then, is not the doubling itself, but how tightly all this enfolding activity is synchronized and orchestrated, how neatly the different aspects of engineering and technology, of entertainment and adventure, of fantasy and merchandising fit into each other around the time-shifting axis of past, present, and future. Such films systematically “double” the levels of their referentiality, making us aware that we exist in two places at once: watching a movie and remembering ourselves watching a movie. But instead of “breaking the illusion,” the split actually deepens our fascination. It catches us in multiple mirrors, but it is not necessarily only a visual effect. The folding movement is also emotional and cognitive, in that it joins anticipation with repetition, and mimesis with memory. I am tempted to call this type of effect not mise-en-abîme, but to think of it as a sort of “situation-synergy”—to join all the other kinds of synergy discussed above. One reason a blockbuster is so often concerned with topics of childhood and adolescence, with major disasters and the forces of nature is that it prefers themes that dramatize time and temporality, that connect the past with the future. But what America has learned from the European fairy tales is not only their insights into the world of childhood fears and longings, of wonder and the need to “return home.” It has also appreciated the fact that if you get children used to something early, they’ll stick with it all their lives. What we do in our formative years will always remain a utopia, maybe a backward utopia since we always will want to go home. To make our childhood synonymous with the cinema: this has been the secret of the Disney principle. Earlier than any\n\nTHE BLOCKBUSTER\n\n21\n\nother studio, the Disney Corporation had “realized” that the modeling—and marketing—of time is the cinema’s deepest fantasy. In Disney films and in Disneyland, it is always “now,” and every film is an instant “classic.” As such, the Disney principle looks set to be the global master plan: each generation of Americans since the 1930s has in effect not only grown up with Disney cartoons, but has had the first and formative encounter with the cinema thanks to one of the company’s key films, from Snow White (1937) to Fantasia (1940), from Bambi (1942) to Cinderella (1950), from The Jungle Book (1967) to The Lion King (1994), from Aladdin (1992) to The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Only George Lucas, with Star Wars (1977), and Spielberg—with E.T. (1982) and his DreamWorks productions—has tapped as deeply into the roots of this fantasy structure of generational time “doing its work.” By successfully adapting the Disney formula, Spielberg has expanded it to include wars and human disasters (Schindler’s List, 1993; Saving Private Ryan, 1998), the boundaries between the human and the prehuman or post-human (Jaws, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 1977). His special effects, soundscapes, and animatronics have realized to its fullest illusion of presence the cinema’s ability to connect past and future into a mythic “now,” extending it to stories taken from history, and making even the disasters of the twentieth century fit family fare for the theme parks of the future. In the contemporary scene the blockbuster thus provides a focus for many conflicting forces. One of the minor miracles is how it rivals nature, by dividing the year and ringing the changes of the seasons. The big movies now colonize the holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, and they announce the summer vacation or the start of fall. Bringing home history, they are also becoming chronometers, the synchronizing gears of a media temporality that in many ways pick up on the mythic rhythms of the celestial clocks our ancestors used to live by: Stonehenge, the Pyramids, from DreamWorks to ClockWorks. As a billboard, pinball machine, or hot-water heater, a blockbuster may be the sign of a new kind of “vertical integration” in the audiovisual and entertainment industries. As pop and folkculture’s timepiece, both at the level of the day-to-day and at the life-cycle level of childhood and its eternal returns, blockbusters want to be nothing less than our lifecalendar. The mise-en-abîme effect with which I started also works the other way round: movies take our everyday habits “by the hand” and mirror or fold them into so many temporalities and lifelines that our lives are at\n\n22\n\nTHOMAS ELSAESSER\n\nonce miniaturized and magnified. Time as duration and time as intensity no longer appear to oppose each other, chronos and kairos come together in the space of the moment that mystics have always known about: the epiphany. After the possible macro-links around the deals, the synergies and the diversifications, the point about the micro-links is therefore at once simple and complex. Between past and future, between childhood and parenthood, mainstream cinema has found its cultural function as the world’s time machine, with the blockbuster the “engine” that simultaneously raises expectations, stirs memories, and unites us with our previous selves. Across mythical stories of disaster and renewal, trauma and survival, it thus reconciles us to our mortality. That is a tall order for the movies, but in a world where money is the bottom line and entertainment the generator of sky-high profits, the movies taking on the mandate of heading our secular redemption may not be too much to ask, not even of Hollywood. There, we are told, anything goes, but what matters is that sometimes it even connects.\n\n2 Those Who Disagree Can Kiss Jack Valenti’s Ass Jon Lewis\n\nSalman Rushdie commented that the reason the State frequently wars with its artists is because the two represent two conflicting versions of the truth. . . . We of course do not have government censors—that would be totalitarian. It would also be unnecessary. What we do have is the MPAA. —Wes Craven, filmmaker\n\nI N T H E S U M M E R of 1999, two big films reached local theaters after celebrated bouts with the MPAA’s Classification and Rating Administration (CARA): Stanley Kubrick’s last film, Eyes Wide Shut, and Trey Parker’s animation feature, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.1 First cuts of both films received the NC-17 rating and, because of their contracts with their studio distributors, Kubrick and Parker cut their films in order to obtain an R rating. Kubrick’s film is about the impact of sexual fantasies on even the most perfect of couples and the ways sexual and erotic images both real and imagined play on all of our minds. The nudity and sexual content in Eyes Wide Shut were thus hardly, to coin the silly industry parlance, gratuitous. (I’d argue that nudity and sexual content are never gratuitous. Cinema is a visual medium. No image, especially an erotic image, however irrelevant to a film’s plot, is, in the larger scheme of things cinematic, gratuitous.) In order to obtain an R rating from the CARA board, Kubrick supervised the addition of computer-generated figures to obstruct our view of the action during a long and wholly unerotic orgy scene.2 While 23\n\n24\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nKubrick’s distributor, Warner Brothers, insisted that not a single frame was cut—which is, after all, technically true—the effect of the computer-generated obstruction is comical. Indeed, the computer-generated figures seem only to be standing in for the CARA board, watching the film as we watch it, putting their torsos—their shrouded figures— in our way as we try to see what it is they can see that we can’t. Jack Valenti, the MPAA’s longtime president and CEO, maintains absolute secrecy concerning the identities of the CARA board members. The image of these board members as shadowy, shrouded figures seems at once appropriate and ironic. When a number of well-known film reviewers complained about the computer graphics, Warner Brothers cochairman Terry Semel offered a succinct response: “We’re not in the NC-17 business. NC-17 is a whole industry. It includes triple-X-rated porno films. So to us that’s just not a business that we’re in.”3 Semel’s quip is disingenuous on so many levels it is difficult to know where to start. The NC-17 cut of the Warner Brothers film, released without the computer gimmick, was in theaters in Europe at the very moment Semel made his remark. In 2001, Warner Brothers released the “director’s cut” on video and DVD. From the very start the plan at Warner Brothers was to cash in a second time on a film that really isn’t very good the first time you see it. And that’s fine with the MPAA, Semel, and the executives and shareholders at Time Warner. A second question begs asking here. Why didn’t Semel and Time Warner want the public to know that they are indeed in the NC-17 business? The NC-17 designation is a perfectly legitimate CARA classification. Its copyright is held by the MPAA. It was adopted in 1990 to classify and by classification legitimize studio-produced adults-only films. The first film released with an NC-17 tag was Philip Kaufman’s Henry and June (1990), a frank if not all that graphic retelling of Henry Miller’s adventures in Paris with two sexually liberated women, his wife, June, and fellow author Anaïs Nin. At the time, it seemed the perfect film to introduce the new designation: Henry and June was a gorgeously shot, serious bio-pic by a director with a considerable reputation.4 It was a hard film to dismiss as just porn, but it was also a difficult and expensive art movie about an all too little-known American writer with no stars and no high concept. Though the NC-17 got Henry and June into the legit marketplace, the film, for reasons that had nothing to do with its rating, failed to make much of an impact at the box office.\n\nTHOSE WHO DISAGREE C AN KISS JACK VALENTI’S ASS\n\n25\n\nIn the summer of 1999, American audiences didn’t get to see all of Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (Warner Brothers, 1999). Warner Brothers chairman Terry Semel reassured parents that his company was “not in the NC-17 business,” at least not in theaters in the United States.\n\n26\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nThe most famous and historically important NC-17 title ever released in the United States was not Henry and June but Showgirls (1995), a film so bad and stupid there aren’t words. Even with big studio money and advertising behind it, Showgirls bombed at the box office. The studios blamed the NC-17 rating because it was easier than blaming the film’s writer and director. After Showgirls flopped, NC-17 became the designation for films that fall through the cracks in the regulatory process—films that are so pervasively NC-17 there is no way for filmmakers to cut to suit the CARA board. NC-17–rated films face significant industrial obstacles. They don’t play in most mall theaters (where leasing agreements prohibit such fare) or at many multiplexes (for fear of folks sneaking in after paying to see another title). None of the premium pay-channels—HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, the Movie Channel, Starz, etc.—screen NC-17 films. Blockbuster Video and Kmart won’t shelve NC-17–rated videos. The studios have their reasons for writing contracts that prohibit filmmakers from producing NC-17 films. But such an industrial policy has nothing to do with sex or morality or larger legal questions regarding censorship and obscenity. In Hollywood, or so the saying goes, “when they say it’s not about the money . . . it’s about the money.” Semel’s press release defending the alteration of Kubrick’s film reveals the contemporary industry’s all too industrial bottom line. The flap over Eyes Wide Shut, as Semel coolly implied, was not really about the integrity of the film itself, or of films in general. Nor was it really about the practice of film censorship, which has persisted here in the United States in a variety of forms since before the turn of the twentieth century. It’s about box office and ancillary revenues. It’s about the generation of profits and the complex ways cine-regulation (engineered in this and most other such cases by the MPAA) is designed primarily to serve the studios’ best interests. Like all the other MPAA member studios, Warner Brothers is committed to, as New York film writer Armond White has described them, “soft . . . American, box office friendly” films. Studio executives do not necessarily like such fare, but they are convinced that such films are the only sort that make money these days. CARA’s objection to the orgy scene in the director’s cut of Eyes Wide Shut was anticipated; it was consistent with its classification of other similar scenes in other studio films. Kubrick made the film knowing that the orgy scene would most likely be cut to suit the industry censors.\n\nTHOSE WHO DISAGREE C AN KISS JACK VALENTI’S ASS\n\n27\n\nAnd he understood that when the CARA board listed certain changes he might make to secure an R rating, Warner Brothers would force him to make the cuts or find someone else to do it for him. Kubrick also had the implied (if not explicit, contractual) promise of a properly preserved director’s cut of the film, which is a whole lot more and better than directors could expect in the good old days under the Production Code Administration (PCA). When the New York critics came to Kubrick’s defense—a defense seemingly made stronger, to be brutally honest here, when the legendary director died before Eyes Wide Shut was released—they had little hope of effecting a change in policy at the MPAA, CARA, or the studios. The CARA board and the film rating system it has overseen at the MPAA’s behest since 1968 have been widely and justifiably credited with saving Hollywood. However compelling the critics’ argument, and however essential they have become in the entertainment marketplace, their efforts on behalf of the film were doomed to failure. In their letter to Semel, the New York film critics excoriated the Warner Brothers executive for failing to protect Eyes Wide Shut from the industry censorship board. Copies of the letter were sent to the editors of several major newspapers and the industry trades. The letter asked why, especially given the film’s larger historical importance, had Semel and Warner Brothers allowed the MPAA and CARA to alter Kubrick’s final statement on film? The critics of course knew precisely why Semel did what he did. He is, after all, just a studio executive and in this case he was just doing his job. The MPAA supervises the self-regulation of film content and does so solely to protect studio products in the marketplace. Cooperation with the MPAA is in every instance a practical as well as symbolic gesture. In the very act of adding those robed figures in the orgy scene, Warner Brothers expressed its continued commitment to the network of relationships that comprise the MPAA. Semel got Kubrick to alter his film because the network of relationships (between studios and other studios, between studios and the vast majority of American theater owners) that is maintained by the MPAA is and always will be more important than the integrity of a single movie. The MPAA film rating system is technically voluntary. Since the classifications imposed by CARA are not legally binding, theater owners are free—at least on constitutional grounds—to ignore them. Of course they don’t, for fear of breaking faith with a larger set of\n\n28\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nindustrial relations with the MPAA that work very much to their economic advantage. The New York critics’ letter called attention to the ways such a practical business policy and procedure might have a larger cultural or political dimension. They described the CARA board as “a punitive and restrictive force [that] effectively tramples the freedom of American filmmakers.” It is, of course, but that’s beside the point. The critics’ collective indignation is at the very least interesting, mostly as an example of how the industry actually works these days. The studios participate in the rating system because they believe it is good for business. But while the primary task of the rating system is to support industry profitability and vertical and horizontal integration, the MPAA and its member studios have done well to define its classification of movies publicly in terms of social responsibility. That the critics oppose such a system thus speaks less to their critique of corporatebased censorship executed by the MPAA than to a mostly unpopular defense of dirty movies. In this little psychodrama, the studios play the part of good corporate citizens and in doing so successfully represent corporate collusion as responsible public relations. An unsettling by-product of the studios’ collective commitment to the economic imperatives of a safe and sensible movie culture (as envisioned by the MPAA) is, as the critics note, a pervasive “kneejerk Puritanism.” The network of cooperative and collusive arrangements between the MPAA and the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) that has at its foundation the CARA system has required of filmmakers and studio executives alike the delivery of watered-down, dumbed-down products. The principal and sole virtue of such a system is that it insures that all G-, PG-, PG-13–, and R-rated films move freely and profitably through the vast entertainment marketplace. Thanks to the MPAA, the art of cinema is institutionally subsumed by and rendered secondary to commerce. It’s a matter of policy and standard business procedure. A separate letter protesting the cuts to Eyes Wide Shut penned by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association was addressed directly to Valenti and the MPAA. It was met with a swift, succinct, and decidedly undiplomatic response. In a widely circulated press release, Valenti dismissed the West Coast critics as “a small band of constant whiners [who] talk to each other, write for each other, opine with each other and view with lacerating contempt the rubes who live Out There, west of\n\nTHOSE WHO DISAGREE C AN KISS JACK VALENTI’S ASS\n\n29\n\nManhattan and east of the San Andreas fault.” For all those critics who would deign to disagree, who would dare to call for a less rigid, less inconsistent, less rigged production code, there is but one alternative. As Armond White put it in a piece on the Eyes Wide Shut controversy, they “can kiss Jack Valenti’s ass.”5 I use the term “rigged” here for a reason. All film distributors who want to get their films into mainstream American theaters—theaters more likely than not owned by one of a handful of conglomerates—must submit their film to the MPAA for classification. If you are not a member of the MPAA—if you are an independent distributor or foreign film importer—you still have to submit your film to an organization run by and for the major Hollywood studios. If you don’t, your film is technically “unrated” and you will have no hope of securing screenings nationwide. If you do, the classification imposed ostensibly by your competitors—competitors who already have more money than you do—will very much govern the way your film moves through the marketplace. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is comprised entirely of construction paper cutouts, crude animation that serves to highlight the animators’ crude sense of humor. The film was screened by the MPAA six times. The first five times, the film was returned to Paramount with an NC-17. The sixth time proved the charm. Dialogue between CARA and the studios is by policy confidential. The MPAA offices in New York guard CARA transcripts. All records of the ratings board since its inception in 1968 are kept secret. Researchers are never granted access to official CARA materials because Valenti believes that revelation, analysis, and/or discussion of how or why CARA rates a film R or NC-17 might compromise the board’s objectivity. In what may well have been something of a publicity gimmick, a series of confidential memos sent by the CARA board to Parker and co-writer Matt Stone were leaked to the press. In one of the memos, reprinted in part in Entertainment Weekly, the filmmakers were asked to change a line of dialogue from “God fucking me up the ass” to “God’s the biggest bitch of them all.” After careful consideration, the board approved the use of the word “fisting,” so long as its definition was excised. One board member had trouble figuring out whether or not he/she should be offended by a scene in which a cutout depiction\n\n30\n\nJON LEWIS\n\nAnimators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to recut South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (Paramount, 1999) five times in order to get an R rating.\n\nof Winona Ryder does something seemingly unspeakable with ping pong balls. Subsequent correspondence from the animators pointed out that Ryder’s paddle, revealed in the last shot of the sequence, was the source of her expertise. The board accepted the explanation and okayed the scene. The source of the leak, it turned out, was the film’s executive producer, Scott Rudin, whose frustration with the board no doubt speaks for a lot of creative people in Hollywood: “The [memos were] like Alice in Wonderland, it was so crazy. I realize they’re good people trying to do a good job, but the MPAA’s not meant to be some moral arbiter of an entire culture.” Rudin and Parker and Stone are all savvy industry players and they made the most of their little drama with Valenti and the CARA board. “Hands down, the MPAA made our movie more graphic and subversive,” the directors have boasted (and taunted) in the press. “We should send a thank-you letter to Jack Valenti. Our movie’s funnier because of him.” The MPAA chief doesn’t argue the point: “They’re trashing [the\n\nTHOSE WHO DISAGREE C AN KISS JACK VALENTI’S ASS\n\n31\n\nMPAA] to get attention for their film, and guess what? They have brilliantly succeeded.”6 However mad Valenti gets at Parker and Stone, he is no doubt happy for Paramount. South Park was a huge hit for the studio, even without an accurate tally of the youngsters who bought tickets at their local multiplex to G-rated films like Tarzan (1999) and then snuck into South Park when the theater manager wasn’t looking. Even when filmmakers make a mockery of the process, as Parker and Stone have, the rating system is there to help everyone to make money. In the heat of a ratings controversy, we tend to forget that the true measure of the system lies not in its treatment of specific scenes in specific movies but in its maintenance of the larger network of relationships (between studios and other studios, between studios and their own subsidiaries, between studios and exhibitors) that comprise the new Hollywood. In a press release revisiting the letters written by the New York and Los Angeles critics in the summer of 1999, Valenti bristled: “When I invented this system, which is totally voluntary, it was not to placate critics—it was to protect parents. I haven’t heard from a single parent who said, ‘Gee, I wish you’d kept that orgy in there,’ . . . The ratings board isn’t infallible, but I don’t understand why a bunch of critics are so certain that an orgy is something the rest of America would find casual. I think this system is doing exactly what it was intended to do.”7 Valenti can afford to be so glib. The system is indeed doing exactly what it was designed to do. As we marvel at the success of the studios these days, we need to remember that once upon a time not so very long ago the studios were not making any money. They are now. And they have Jack Valenti, the MPAA, and the film rating system to thank for it.8\n\nNOTES 1. A third film bears mention here, American Pie (1999), though the tussle with the ratings board was at once weirder and easier to resolve than the two films discussed here. Warren Zide, the producer of the R-rated teen comedy, reflected on his exchange with the folks at CARA: “We went back four times before we got an R . . . we had to get rid of a few thrusts when he’s having sex with the apple pie. The MPAA was like ‘Can he thrust two times instead of four?’” 2. Though Kubrick died before the film was released, he is said to have supervised the post-production of the orgy scene himself.\n\n32\n\nJON LEWIS\n\n3.

Hard Core: How the Struggle over Censorship Saved the Modern Film Industry (New York: New York University Press, 2000).\n\n3 The Hollywood History Business Jan-Christopher Horak\n\nI N T H E 1 9 9 0 s , film history became a viable commodity for the enter-\n\ntainment industry that could be marketed on television and other electronic media. Previously relegated to the realm of the fan book publishing industry and the academic press, the film historical narratives reached a relatively small number of consumers. However, the proliferation of cable networks and other new media, and the concomitant development of ever more specialized and fragmented audiences, forced distributors to turn to the collective movie past. Old movies and documentary programming about the entertainment industry are inexpensive, at least in comparison to the costs of developing and producing new product. Networks like American Movie Classics, Turner Classic Movies, and TV Land specialize in presenting old movies and television and also exhibit film historical “infotainment” as “wrap-arounds,” or as independent programming. Other cable channels like Arts and Entertainment, E! and MSNBC present star biographies, supposed “behind-the-scenes” looks at the stars of yesterday and today. With the end of cinema as it has been practiced in the last century in sight, the history of the medium has gained currency on TV. Such a glorified and schematized view of Hollywood film history had already been successfully peddled in theme parks like Universal Studios, Disney-MGM Studios Florida, and the Paramount Parks, theme restaurants like Planet Hollywood, and gambling casinos in Las Vegas and along the Mississippi. With the introduction of DVDs, the major studios have rushed to create added value for their most popular catalogue titles with the production of film historical shorts. The Internet, apart from providing home pages for all the entertainment companies, has rapidly expanded a collector’s market engaged in the 33\n\n34\n\nJ AN-CHRISTOPHER HORAK\n\nexchange of film memorabilia through auction sites such as eBay and Amazon.com. In order to service all these myriad businesses, in the 1990s the studios began founding their own archives to protect their historical assets. For the first time, the studios became concerned with their own history. While Disney has had a small archive for Walt Disney’s personal collection for more than twenty-five years, the first studio to found a full-fledged archive was Warner Brothers, which hired a curator in 1994. Fox followed suit in 1996. Its archivist was primarily responsible for the extensive memorabilia tour surrounding the release of Titanic in 1997. Universal and Sony Columbia began to archive projects in 1998, leaving only Paramount without an official archive to protect and control its historical assets. At all the studios, the desire to collect film history was motivated and driven by marketing and branding considerations, rather than any altruistic urge to preserve history.1 By the late 1980s the work of film archives entered the public consciousness, thanks to the relentless self-promotion of the American Film Institute (AFI). The AFI has accomplished relatively little in terms of actual film preservation. But it has created a more acute awareness in the public mind of the ephemeral nature of the medium and the need for film preservation. Several high-profile restorations (and the publicity campaigns surrounding them), including Napoleon (1927 and 1981), Lawrence of Arabia (1962 and 1989), and Vertigo (1958 and 1996), and debates surrounding the “colorization” of black and white film classics also raised awareness in the general population.2 All this film historical activity has brought about an expansion of the labor market for film historians. But don’t be misled. The studios have never been interested in film history per se, unless it can be used to market their product. For the studios, the exploitation of film history is never more than a short-term goal. The industry is structured only to achieve immediate profits, rather than invest in long-term strategies. My goal in writing this essay is not so much to analyze the function and feasibility of film historical texts in the emerging mass media. Rather, it is to present a case study of one studio’s relationship to its own history, as viewed from the vantage point of an insider involved in the founding of a studio archive. It is the story of a serious film historical experiment initiated by a major motion picture company, Universal Studios, which was summarily torpedoed, the victim of studio machinations and financial politics. The names have not been changed, since\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY BUSINESS\n\n35\n\nthere are no innocents. This is a personal story, and this essay makes no claim to objectivity. Instead it offers a cautionary message on the stakes of film history in the 1990s. Despite the fact that Universal Studios has existed as a company for nearly ninety years (an anniversary it will celebrate in June 2002), for most of its existence little thought was given to its history, traditions, and material culture. In 1936, after Carl Laemmle was forced to relinquish control, many of the production files from the silent era were thrown away. In 1949 Universal burned its entire nitrate holdings from the silent period in order to reclaim the silver. All 5,553 films that Universal produced between 1912 and 1930 disappeared in the flames. Around the same time, Universal sold much of its property department, which included material going back to the 1910s. With each succeeding generation of Universal managers, more and more historical material was lost or destroyed. As late as the early 1980s, Irving Thalberg’s correspondence from his time as head of Universal disappeared when a New Jersey warehouse in which it was stored was sold. In 1989 Beth Kennedy, senior vice president for administration at MCA (Universal’s parent company), commissioned a feasibility study for the establishment of a Universal archive. The Winthrop Group was hired to conduct the study. The Winthrop Group surveyed for the first time Universal’s historical assets, set parameters for the conditions necessary for their protection, and made recommendations for the establishment of an archive. The study was completed after five months of site visits to Universal City Studios, samplings of materials, interviews with corporate managers, and analysis of the situation at MCA. The report contained a wealth of information regarding Universal’s archivalquality holdings as they existed in 1989-90. A not insignificant amount of the material described in the report would indeed disappear before an archive was actually established. The Winthrop Report emphasized that the establishment of a corporate archive demanded a long-term budgetary and structural commitment from Universal’s management, as well as the formulation of company-wide policies concerning the collection, maintenance, and use of archival collections. The Winthrop Report was presented to Lew Wasserman, MCA’s aging chairman, in 1990. Wasserman rejected the proposal out of hand as too expensive. Later the same year, Wasserman sold MCA-Universal to Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company of Japan for $6.59 billion. In 1995\n\n36\n\nJ AN-CHRISTOPHER HORAK\n\nJoseph E. Seagram Company purchased an 80 percent interest in MCA-Universal for $6.3 billion, leading ultimately to the retirement of Wasserman in April 1996. In December 1995, six months after Seagram purchased MCA, Seagram corporate curator Carla Ash sent a memo to Edgar Bronfman Jr., Seagram’s thirty-nine-year-old CEO, which can be regarded as the founding document for the Universal archive. Ash, while on the Seagram payroll, reported informally to Phyllis Lambert, the sister of Edgar Bronfman Sr., a major stockholder in the family-controlled business and the director of the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal, an institution she built and financed. It was through Lambert’s influence that Seagram hired Mies van der Rohe to build its Park Avenue headquarters in the 1950s, created several corporate art collections, and established archives for all its subsidiary businesses. In the memo Ash made the following recommendations: (1) that company-wide guidelines be established for archiving Universal’s history; (2) that a directory of archival holdings be created; (3) that conservation procedures be developed; (4) that an oral history program be instituted; and (5) that all artistic production materials be located and retrieved. Although Bronfman’s reaction to the memo is not documented in any available paperwork, it is assumed that he gave his blessing to the project, because in March 1996 C. Ford Peatross, curator of prints and photographs at the Library of Congress, began a yearlong study of the situation at Universal. In August 1996 Peatross proposed the formation of an Archives Committee, consisting of himself, Ash, and Maygene Daniels, chief archivist at the National Gallery of Art. Meanwhile, in August 1996, an archives “working group” was set up at Universal (at Carla Ash’s instigation) by Howard Weitzman, Universal’s new executive president, and COO Ron Meyer. Richard Costello, a former Madison Avenue advertising executive and another recent Bronfman hire, was assigned the task of overseeing the founding of the archive. Independently of the Seagram initiative, an embryonic proposal for an archive had been made to Ron Bension, president of Universal Studio’s theme park operations, which stated that such an archive could produce income for the theme parks. Another division of Universal, Consumer Products, also submitted to management a proposal for an archive, “Preserving the Magic of Hollywood.” A studio archives “working group” was formed, including representatives from Consumer Products, Recreation (theme parks), Strate-\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY BUSINESS\n\n37\n\ngic Marketing, Studio Operations, Corporate, and Corporate Communications. In a memo dated August 15, 1996, the committee suggested that an immediate moratorium be put on disposing of any company props or other studio materials, and that a studio archive be set up that would be exempt from operating on a profit/loss basis. In February 1997 Carla Ash and the consulting team surveyed the historical materials and memorabilia at Universal. In almost every area the team identified historically valuable material that was in peril. A month later, Daniels and Peatross filed their report, “Archives and Collections: Recommendations for Action,” which had been written in close conjunction with Ash. The recommendations included the following: 1. the establishment of an Archives and Collections Department; 2. the transfer to Archives and Collections of all files, photographs, manuscripts, posters, graphic items, and other materials that document the company’s history; 3. The collection of signature props, costumes, and other memorabilia; 4. the maintenance of the best professional archival and curatorial practice to ensure preservation; 5. the hiring of a highly qualified senior-level archive director; 6. the establishment of offices (on-lot) and significant warehouse space (off-lot); 7. the immediate establishment of an exhibition space and longterm development of a museum facility; 8. the institution of Archives and Collections as a permanent department; 9. the establishment of a budget for all aspects of the department’s work; 10. the immediate identification and transfer of historical materials at physical risk; 11. the establishment of programs and guidelines for the acquisition of historical materials from outside the company; 12. the establishment of policies and procedures for internal and external access to the collections; 13. the acquisition of key props from all new productions to ensure their preservation;\n\n38\n\nJ AN-CHRISTOPHER HORAK\n\n14. the development of products to draw on Universal’s history; and 15. the participation in activities that improve corporate communications and increase a sense of corporate identity. What immediately strikes one about these recommendations is that they insist on practices that are common in the nonprofit world of archives and libraries but are seldom put into practice in corporate archives. No motion picture studio had ever established archival practices in accordance with the guidelines of the American Society of Archivists (ASA). The committee’s recommendations were based on the assumption that the archives would not generate income. Not even the nonprofit world can afford such idealism anymore, much less a corporation whose officers receive a bonus based on financial performance. By the late spring of 1997 the archive project was well under way. In July 1997 Costello and Ash made a presentation to Weitzman, which called for the official establishment of an Archives and Collections Department divided into an archive subgroup and a marketing/resources subgroup. The proposal also included a first mission statement and a limited set of objectives. The list of objectives made clear a shift away from archiving the company’s film history in favor of marketing concerns. It would not be the last time that archival and marketing functions would be debated. In February 1998 I was hired as director of Archives and Collections, and officially began work in May. At my request, the marketing and archive areas were unified under one budget and management, with a staff of five. While the Universal Classic Film Series (the first of which was called “Universal Noir”) was administered by an outside consultant, archive staff devoted time to both archiving and marketing efforts. I proposed a budget for fiscal year 1999, and on July 1, 1999, Archives and Collections officially became a department, reporting to Costello in Universal Corporate. The budget included a list of long-term goals which were approved without discussion by Weitzman’s replacement.3 Since the archive was in Corporate, a division that does not itself generate income, but only assists and administers infrastructure for other income-generating departments, budget goals for generating revenues were included neither in the budget, nor in the attached goals. In the summer of 1998 a warehouse was located near the lot. Initial\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY BUSINESS\n\n39\n\ncapital improvements were completed in the winter of 1998, and in March of the following year, materials collected over the past two years were moved into the new archival space. At the same time, offices were set up in the basement of the Universal Commissary so that the archive would have the necessary on-lot presence. By the spring of 1999 the department had settled on a database system that was both robust and complex enough to handle the extreme heterogeneity of material coming into the collections.4 The technical aspects of founding, organizing, and creating a user base for the archive were relatively easy to accomplish, even with a small staff. Much more difficult was the navigation of the highways and byways of corporate politics. One of the first land mines was the issue of reporting structure. While I officially reported to Costello, Ash exerted influence over the decision-making process through the perceived power of her position as a direct link to Edgar Bronfman. Costello was more interested in the marketing aspects of the archive’s corporate mandate, while Ash insisted that until exact surveys of all the company’s historical materials had been made and the archive’s infrastructure had been firmly established, the department should refrain from any marketing or outreach efforts. This managerial conflict bubbled under the surface in the archive’s first fiscal year. Several factors ultimately affecting the position of the archive changed in the beginning of the archive’s second fiscal year. First, Edgar Bronfman’s interest in Universal began to wane as he set his sights on the Polygram Music acquisition. Universal’s dismal box office performance in 1997-98, encompassing seventeen months of flops, and the industry’s cold shoulder to the Seagram CEO certainly didn’t help to perk Bronfman’s interest. Meanwhile, Seagram-installed executives began to disappear as quickly as they had appeared after the Seagram acquisition of MCA in 1995.5 The executive control of Archives and Collections was shifted to Universal Studio Operations, the division responsible for maintaining and generating income from the studio’s physical plant. This was not good news for a department that was a cost center, rather than a revenue center. Studio Operations was controlled by executives who had worked for Lew Wasserman, none of whom had ever given their blessing to Seagram’s archival project. Indeed, one can assume that they were unhappy about the archive’s founding under Corporate, given the fact that Central Files, the Research Library, the Costume and Prop Departments,\n\n40\n\nJ AN-CHRISTOPHER HORAK\n\nand the Film Vaults—all of which collected if not protected studio assets—were under their control. While paying lip service to cooperation and synergy, they frustrated the archive’s efforts at every turn. For example, when the archive asked Studio Operations to turn over their poster collection for proper archival storage, they refused. The Property Department had been amassing original Universal posters for several years through purchase in the collector’s market, in order to hang them in the offices of studio executives. While Studio Operations finally realized that it was not a good investment to expose a poster valued at $30,000 to UV light, and had begun a program of hanging photographic copies in public spaces, the originals were still being stored in a back room of the Prop Department. At my first meeting with Jim Watters, president of Studio Operations, the executive stated that in his division “we do not eat our own,” a comment meant to soothe and reassure. In point of fact, Studio Operations management would spend a good part of the fiscal year 2000 doing exactly that: eating their own. By the winter of 1999 Bronfman began shopping the studio around. Universal was once again on a hit movie roll, having generated close to $1 billion in box office receipts, thanks to such blockbusters as The Mummy (1999), Notting Hill (1999), and American Pie (1999). But upper management began cutting costs anyway, so that the company would be more attractive to potential buyers. Quietly, a massive bloodletting began. In the spring of 2000, over six hundred jobs were eliminated. Archives and Collections lost two budgeted but not yet filled positions, and a third position through attrition. I was told to close the eightyfour-year-old Research Department (which was then sold to Lucasfilm). Then two researchers were let go and as a result I had to close the Research Library. Finally, the travel, exhibitions, and acquisitions budgets were either zeroed or cut back. The Archives Department closed the fiscal year 2000 in June, 15 percent under budget. The museum project, which by July 1999 had progressed to an architectural drawing stage within Corporate Strategic Planning, was the first goal to be abandoned. When the department’s manager for exhibition services resigned to take another position, all activities connected with servicing other departments were radically scaled back. Finally, when the French conglomerate Vivendi purchased Seagram in June 2000, Studio Operations felt they could abandon all pretense to following the lofty goals of the Seagram project. My position\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY BUSINESS\n\n41\n\nas director of Archives and Collections was eliminated, while the remaining staff was put under the administration of Central Files. While the archive continues to exist, its function is no longer to make history visible, but rather to bury it.\n\nNOTES 1. Just why the entertainment industry put film history on its agenda in the 1990s bears some theoretical analysis, certainly more than will be discussed in this essay. The above articulated theory of an economic imperative is certainly one viable explanation, but it fails to account completely for the initial impetus to produce film historical programming and products. One need only remember that self-reflexive movies about the film, television or music industry’s history were considered, with few exceptions, by industry insiders to be box office poison. My own possibly optimistic view is that the audience for film/TV history has grown, thanks to thirty years of film/media education at the secondary and university level, and historical film programming in countless museums, cinémathèques, art cinemas, and college film societies. 2. The U.S. Congress passed legislation pertaining to the distribution of classic Hollywood films, whether on film or video, which compels distributors to state whether a film has been altered or not. The legislation culminated after extensive hearings in 1993 on a national film preservation plan in the establishment of the National Film Preservation Board in 1998. 3. The goals included the following: a. to establish an archive to collect, conserve, preserve, and catalogue all documents, visual materials, and three-dimensional objects pertaining to Universal’s history; b. to build a proper archival and research facility off-lot for long-term storage; c. to repackage in archival housing and restore, where necessary, all historical materials; d. to complete oral histories of the studio’s longtime executives and employees; e. to acquire historical materials from outside sources; f. to create an outreach program to educate Universal employees; g. to build a museum that would showcase Universal’s history; h. to develop access policies for internal and external users; i. to facilitate other Universal departments to generate income from dormant historical assets.\n\n42\n\nJ AN-CHRISTOPHER HORAK\n\n4. The material included photographic stills, set and costume designs, production records, company correspondence, sets, costumes, props, memorabilia, posters, publicity materials, company publications, branded products, theme park designs, music cue sheets and scores, videos, DVDs, music videos, and awards. 5. Both Howard Weitzman and Dick Costello, two key players in the archive’s founding, left the company, not necessarily at their own volition.\n\n4 The Man Who Wanted to Go Back Murray Pomerance\n\nWhen space feels thoroughly familiar to us, it has become place. —Yi-Fu Tuan, Space and Place\n\nI A M T RY I N G to map my own experience and biography as memories\n\nof feeling-in-place. This involves, among many other things, trying to understand Hitchcockian narrative as an emplacement, a set storytelling. I am particularly interested in Vertigo (1958), a film that offers the problem of figuring out both where one is and whither one is going—two questions, Heisenberg warned, we could never answer at once. In particular it is Vertigo: The Restoration (1996) that fascinates me here, specifically, the film seen again—as Henry James would have put it, revised.1 Nowadays, a gripping predisposition for progress causes us to regard every space and meaning as a destination to which we might advance if only we had resources enough of understanding, sufficient light, the fuel to carry on. But as Yi-Fu Tuan cautions, “Human beings are not endowed with an instinctive sense of direction.”2 He goes on to quote James Feibleman: “The importance of events in any life is more directly proportionate to their intensity than to their extensity.”3 If we look at Vertigo as an unfolding of intensities, it is clear that its story rests on our ability to regard the past as something to contemplate returning to, a lure, even a target, rather than as a primordial source that lingers behind us and above. Above? Surely, to begin with an equation, before is above; and our fall is the gravity-bound depreciation of adventure, and surely of narrative. The Enlightenment posited life as a climb to ever purer, constantly and ineffably magnified Being, out of and in escape 43\n\n44\n\nMURRAY POMERANCE\n\nVertigo: The Restoration (Universal, 1996) reminded us that they don’t make ’em like they used to.\n\nfrom a “pit of Babel”4 in which we hankered for freedom through ascent. But the image of our present and future as a glorious and golden prominence, a kind of sanctified crane shot, is a conceit, even sales pitch, calculated to feature the available (that is, well-distributed) present at the expense of the past. Vertigo shows clearly enough that futurity—the protagonist’s and ours—is below, that progress (at least narrative progress) is a tumble. Paul Goodman was invoking this fall when he wrote of “probability and implication as important unifying relations” in literature.5 The past is all improbable, and our experience as it unfolds is a gathering of probability. The 1996 release of Robert Harris and James Katz’s restoration of Vertigo recaptures and redeploys an earlier music. In so doing, it is a precise reflection of the themes of the film it restores, since Vertigo is explicitly about being restored while falling—falling in love, falling to death, falling for a performance. Scottie Ferguson’s pursuit of Madeleine Elster is a fall toward certainty from a peak of suspicion and disbelief; and his relation with Judy Barton, ostensibly to him a voyage into\n\nTHE MAN WHO WANTED TO GO B ACK\n\n45\n\nthe past, in fact hurls him toward his own creative ground. The “love story” of Scottie and Judy Barton—in which he uses her, as a film director might, for building up a characterization through gesture, hairstyling, costume, dialogue, posture, and situated action—echoes the earlier “love story” of Scottie and “Madeleine.” Hitchcock establishes a vertical placement of these two tales on a scale of class and sentiment (preexisting for his audiences) and thus uses his narrative not only to drop us to a conclusion but also to inform us that we are being dropped. Judy is beneath Madeleine, and Scottie has “fallen.” Hitchcock openly signals Judy, the rank actress, to be “low,” making her a salesgirl at I. Magnin, giving her a harsh elocution, dressing her garishly.6 This makes stratification itself the substance of the tale, and Kim Novak playing Judy playing Madeleine suggests directly Scottie’s confusion about height, that is, his vertigo. Scottie’s vertigo, however, is not ours, and it is our vertigo that is referred to in the film’s title. We fall, but also loathe to fall, through the tale. To assist us, Hitchcock made the explicit choice to shoot in San Francisco, where it would be possible to have the story advance in a downhill direction.7 Further, the “Madeleine” who seduces Scottie is unreal. He falls for someone who exists solely as a character concocted by Elster, and so his fall, a form of “reading,” bears kinship with our own attraction to him, to Madeleine, and to the film. It was precisely as a film lover who had seen Vertigo many times and felt its power, but had also failed to comprehend it deeply and who therefore needed to remember, to re-vise or see again, that Robert Harris entered into a project with James Katz to restore this film in the mid1990s, a time when so much of human history was being reseen, reorganized, revised itself in memory of the twentieth century. So gripped was Harris by the possibilities of reproducing Vertigo as Hitchcock had originally conceived it to be seen, that the irony of laboring in restoration of a work about laboring-in-restoration entirely evaded him.8 The intention of finding the original production materials and recrafting a print from them swept Harris into his own time trip, a systematic hunt through long-unopened storage boxes and rendezvous with now aged collaborators with both precise and faulty memories of their own early experiences working on this film. From the start, the restoration of Vertigo posed problems. While mag tapes, color separation masters, original negatives, advertising materials, trailers, and sound stems for original effects, dialogue, and music tracks for most films of the 1950s and 1960s filled as many as one\n\n46\n\nMURRAY POMERANCE\n\nhundred large boxes, for Vertigo Harris and Katz found only ten. In 1967 the rights to the 1950s Paramount films reverted to Hitchcock.9 In order to learn how best to keep the physical materials, the genetic fragments necessary for assemblage, Hitchcock consulted not an archivist but his business manager, Herman Citron, one of whose employees advised that he should store only the original camera negative, the black and white Technicolor separation masters, one for red, one for green, one for blue; a sixteen-millimeter optical track negative (for making prints); a thirty-five-millimeter soundtrack negative; and five positive prints. Everything else—original dialogue effects, original music stems, original Foley stems, original effects stems, original trailers, advertising materials, still photographs—was junked worldwide. Storage, after all, is expensive. Ultimately, Universal spent $5 million to license the rights to the Paramount films from Hitchcock’s estate. In 1983 James Katz, who was heading the Classics Division there, and who had not yet partnered with Harris, convinced the studio to make a license with him for Vertigo. Arrangements were made for Paramount to ship the stored materials to Universal from its vaults. But Hitchcock had everything in storage in a Los Angeles warehouse that was neither heated nor air-conditioned.10 In summer, temperatures in the warehouse climbed to 105 degrees. The optical material faded, differentially according to whether the reel sat above or below other reels. Because of its Famous Music subsidiary, a substantial investment in itself, Paramount was assiduous about keeping the original music recordings, but of these the acetate backings were shriveled and the oxide was flaking off. Harris’s assistant Mike Hyatt was able to get a sound dub by keeping his thumb against the mag stock as it rolled over the playback head in order to keep the contact consistent. For the entire picture the Foley track—an effects track incorporating footsteps on the stairs of the tower, Scottie climbing his ex-girlfriend Midge’s banana yellow stepladder, and other “practical” sounds—had to be redone from scratch. Certain specific sound effects were complicated to grab in 1995 with the authenticity that would have been possible in 1957. Restoration is a battle for authenticities. A period Karmann Ghia had to be located, for example, so that Midge’s car stopping in front of Scottie’s house at night would sound right. Some of t"
