        "text": "For a while you go along for the ride. But as the film progresses it becomes increasingly unwieldy.\n\nA sharp comedy as well as a punk-pulp spree.\n\nRitchie has crammed RocknRolla with innumerable homoerotic lads'-mag jokes. He has probably calculated that if the film fails on the high street, h...\n\nFor all its hipster posturing, fast cutting, and camera tricks, this tale of chicanery is peculiarly arid and brittle, without a single charac...\n\nRocknRolla is a recovery from the knockout blows of his past two films but Ritchie is certainly retreading familiar thematic territory.\n\nFlashy but assured, the film is a controlled exercise in style that toes the line but never feels over-the-top. In a word, RocknRolla rocks.\n\nStyle is what RocknRolla is all about. And it has it in spades, from the cockney Pulp Fiction dialogue to the music-video editing of the rambling n...\n\nRocknRolla often feels more like a parody of a Guy Ritchie film than a real movie.\n\nBetter just to sit back and enjoy RocknRolla for what it is: a fast-paced amoral joyride that’s more interested in the absurdities of violent...\n\nRocknRolla isn’t as jammed with visual pyrotechnics as Ritchie’s Lock, Stock and Smoking Barrel (1998), but that’s OK, because wi...\n\nRocknRolla is a well-acted and attitudinal action movie, a return to Ritchie’s trademark 'Mockney' style, which takes amusing and twiste...\n\nRitchie whisks you along on a whirlwind tour, but he’s not averse to putting on the brakes long enough to admire some of his favorite at...\n\nRocknRolla reminds us of how cool Ritchie was before Madonna doused his fire. Pity he makes us wait so long.\n\nAlas, Guy Ritchie seems to have lost even what little touch he once had, his latest a typically convoluted saga about strangely named big&nbsp...\n\nRocknRolla did not leave me wanting more (the last shot promises a sequel is on its way). Still, its confidence is impressive. London’s...\n\nThe actual plot is so uselessly convoluted you’d get a headache just reading it – but you might want to pull out the Advil anyway...\n\nI mean, Mr Ritchie: this genra: it’s ova. I mean, doing yet anotha stinka of a drama about the mee-lee-a of the ersatz London gangs...\n\nRocknRolla marks a pulpy return to form for Ritchie.\n\nAs in other Ritchie films, RocknRolla attempts to depict a world of ever-expanding chaos. But the chaos is only in the way the story is told...\n\nSometimes it amounts to a laugh or two.\n\nGuns, gangsters, and Richie’s unique style and tone make his latest picture just plain fun.\n\nRitchie the director may have returned to form, but Ritchie the writer is still an amorphous mess.\n\nYou can say this much for Guy Ritchie’s RocknRolla: it isn’t as bad as his last two films.\n\nRocknRolla, though not the most original movie ever made, is a blast, an adrenaline rush of punked-out rock-and-roll-fueled action and crime.\n\nRocknRolla feels as if Ritchie is imitating his favourite director here, and that director is Guy Ritchie.\n\nIt is perhaps high time for us to just come out and finally admit to the world that director Guy Ritchie is not a very good filmmaker.\n\nThis is the first of his cartoons to work better as a movie than as a fashion spread."
