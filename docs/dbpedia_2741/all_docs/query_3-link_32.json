        "text": "I know we're supposed to be \"solely professional\" on here, but I cannot stay silent about this. To be clear, I don't subscribe to the kind of blanket statement hot takes I see in contemporary film analysis online, nor will I take preference to only one kind of film genre as \"true\" cinema at the exclusion of all else. I will engage with the nuance of EVERY KIND of story that can be told. To only prefer one genre is to be close-minded, as far as I'm concerned. But the issues facing the industry at present, which I think are perfectly encapsulated by this video from a recently emerging indie filmmaker near the release of his first film, are scary. The close-mindedness AND lack of basic awareness about audience buying trends and interests, among those currently making decisions about which films get made -- and where they get released -- is genuinely terrifying. I won't pretend to be presently capable of articulating such phantasmagorical fears about the industry's future in a clear or concise manner, but at the very least I cannot be silent about it. Because I don't merely want to make movies. I NEED to make movies. It is a literal chronic need. It is as essential to me as oxygen or water. To not be able to do that is equivalent to the feeling of starvation. Every second I am not able to do that, or work towards doing that, is the most physically and mentally painful anguish imaginable. It means that much to me. And seeing every existing available door into that art form close to new filmmakers, and even supposedly \"cemented status\" filmmakers, is terrifying. As absurd as I know it this will sound tomorrow, long after I've already said this, it genuinely makes me question if this art form has a future. Especially when there are already so few stories in it, and even fewer storytellers in it, who look or sound like me. Those are the storytellers being banished the most in this present state of release trends. That cannot continue. Unless EVERY story that is capable of being told gets told, this art form will cease to be a legitimate one.\n\nüí™ Are you a film 'bro'? üçø What is it? Let's get into it. üìà A term gaining prominence in name-calling on social media, primarily through TikTok. ü§ê I was labeled as such after one of my satirical videos surpassed a million views. Essentially, the title is given to men with shallow knowledge and limited, singular taste in films. If they are fans of male-led/directed movies that highlight hyper-masculinity, violence, and/or misogyny (also known as 'toxic masculinity'), Film Bros would actively discredit or even refuse to watch films that directly address these issues. They might even rate a movie poorly if it has a female lead and/or director without watching it (This is called review bombing - examples include Captain Marvel and Barbie). However, there are 'good' film bros who appreciate both 'The Godfather' and 'Bridget Jones's Diary' or Greta Gerwig's catalogue of films (literally me). If you enjoy any of the following directors or their films, then you most likely fall into this category (loosely): Martin Scorsese Christopher Nolan David Fincher Ridley Scott Quentin Tarantino Bonus: Your favorite film is \"American Psycho\" (2000) or \"Joker\" (2019). It's all subjective anyway. Watch whatever you want and enjoy whatever you like. Don't rain on anyone else's parade, though.\n\n\"The Butterfly Effect\" is a thought-provoking film that explores the intricate connection between our past actions and the present realities we face. Just as a butterfly's gentle flutter can trigger a chain reaction that culminates in a distant storm, our seemingly insignificant choices can have profound and far-reaching consequences. The movie is about a man named Evan who learns that he can travel back in time. However, he soon realizes that even the smallest changes he makes can have a ripple effect, causing major changes in the present day. The movie is called \"The Butterfly Effect\" because it is a reference to the theory of chaos, which states that even the smallest actions can have a major impact on the future. The butterfly effect is named after the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas. This is because the butterfly's flapping creates a small change in the air that eventually leads to a large change in the weather. In the movie, Evan's changes to the past have a similar effect on the present day. For example, when he travels back in time and prevents his friend from being killed in a car accident, it turns out that his friend was actually a murderer. This changes the course of Evan's life and the lives of everyone he knows. The movie is a reminder that even the smallest actions can have a major impact on the world. It is also a reminder that we should be careful about the choices we make, as they can have unforeseen consequences. #TheButterflyEffect #Movie #ChoicesAndConsequences #TimeTravel #LifeLessons #ReleaseDate #Director #Cast #AshtonKutcher #Hollywood #thoughts #butterflyeffectuniverse #time #Action #PastAndPresent #Friends #Films #Lifelessonmovies\n\n\"Sunset Boulevard\" \"Hollywood had never been so faithfully depicted before as in Billy Wilder‚Äôs production of Sunset Blvd. Remembered today, as a noir icon ‚Äì right alongside Wilder‚Äôs other major title Double Indemnity ‚Äì Sunset Blvd. with all its cynicism and pessimistic view of the world managed to capture what was the true essence of classic Hollywood.\" Truman Hopper on the Taste of Cinema website helps us understand why this film is a creative masterpiece. We recall it today because it premiered on August 10, 1950. \"During his career, Billy Wilder tended develop stories around people that were considered outcasts, people that were forgotten by society or that just simply didn‚Äôt fit in. ... \"But in Sunset Blvd., the director guides us through a depressive and delusional vision of the world as seen through the eyes of a group of outcasts, a failed scriptwriter, a forgotten movie icon, her now butler former film director, as well as, her now bridge companions former movie stars. Hopper identifies four factors that make Sunset Boulevard stand out.1) Film Structure; 2.) Themes and Timelessness, 3.) Noir visual style and themes. 4) Performances. You can deepen your understanding of this great film and the four factors by watching the full movie with commentary at the link. Creativity happens every day. The creator's creative spark allows him to see what others fail -- or choose to ignore -- to see. It takes courage and the willingness to act creatively. https://lnkd.in/eh_gUSbm\n\nWhat can we learn from failure? ü§î I recently chatted with Declan Neil Fernandez, a film enthusiast and author of the making-of-film book, ‚ÄòHorrible and Fascinating ‚Äì John Boorman's Exorcist II: The Heretic‚Äô. (The book took Declan ten years to write. The film is often described as one of the worst ever made. ) Link to episode: https://lnkd.in/g8vHqfGV The book seeks to answer many of the questions associated with the unique, compelling, and infamous film, ‚ÄòExorcist II: The Heretic‚Äô. Released in 1977, the film was a much-anticipated sequel to the most popular and successful horror film ever made, ‚ÄòThe Exorcist‚Äô. The sequel was inspired by profound philosophical concepts popular in 1970s culture, related to new age consciousness, spirituality, and human evolution. Unfortunately, all of this was lost in the confusion. The film is often described as one of the worst ever made. On a fact-finding mission, Declan asked the question: How did it happen? Declan offers insights into his writing process as we chat about the background, context, and dynamics of the film, with discussions around the Hollywood film industry in the mid 1970s, Warner Bros studio, director John Boorman, and other aspects of the ill-fated production. Declan shares some of the reasons why he decided to venture into this unexpected and curious cultural territory, on an intriguing, personal mission to solve a mystery. #film #filmmaking #culture #sequel #exorcist #horrible #fascinating #filmdirector #johnboorman\n\nFILM REVIEWS - 'The Parade Movie Guy' HORIZON: AN AMERICAN SAGA - CHAPTER 1 Recently, I was invited to be the exclusive Film Reviewer for 'The Parade Cinema' in Marlborough, West England, under the alias, 'The Parade Movie Guy'.
