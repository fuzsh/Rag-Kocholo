        "text": "Secrets Of Two Social Media Experts\n\nFollowing the success of Stā Social, Samantha Cusick and Conor Doyle chat candidly about all aspects of social media\n\nSamantha Cusick\n\nConor James Doyle\n\nThe first in a series of free educational events, award-winning hairdressers Samantha Cusick and Conor James Doyle joined forces for Stā Social – a social media masterclass for hairdressers looking to level up their content. Following the event, Creative HEAD chatted to the dynamic duo about their relationships with social media and what they’ve learned about building a following.\n\nSamantha Cusick\n\nTalk us through your relationship with social media – how has it transformed the way you work?\n\nI have a genuine love to create content and share knowledge with others and social media is the best avenue for this. Social media has completely revolutionised the way I approach my work. Before, it was all about word-of-mouth and local advertising, but now I can showcase my work to a global audience in real-time. It’s like having a portfolio that’s constantly updated and always accessible. Social media has allowed me to build a community, engage with clients on a more personal level, and attract new business – be that clients or attracting the attention of brands – which has led to paid ambassador roles. The instant feedback and interaction I get through platforms like Instagram and Facebook have also helped me stay on top of trends and continuously improve my skills.\n\nWhat would you say is your favourite platform, and why?\n\nInstagram is hands down my favourite platform. As a visual person, it’s the perfect place to showcase my work. The platform is designed for sharing beautiful images and videos, and that’s what my business is all about. The ability to reach people with just a hashtag or location tag is incredibly powerful. Plus, Instagram Stories and Reels have added an easy way to engage with my audience, giving them a behind-the-scenes look at my life as a hairdresser and business owner, which they love.\n\nAs well as the benefits, what would you say are some of the pitfalls or common misconceptions?\n\nOne common misconception is that social media success happens overnight. It takes a lot of time, consistency, and effort to build a following and create content that resonates with your audience. Another pitfall is the pressure to constantly produce perfect content, which can be overwhelming and lead to burnout. It’s important to remember that social media should be a tool to enhance your business, not a source of stress. Being authentic and sharing real moments, even the imperfect ones, can actually strengthen your connection with your clients and audience.\n\nIf there was one thing you’d wish you had done differently when building your profiles, what would it be?\n\nI wish I had started engaging with my audience more from the beginning. When I first started, I was so focused on posting content that I didn’t prioritise responding to comments and messages as much as I should have. Building a community is just as important as showcasing your work, and it’s something I’ve really focused on improving. Engagement is key to growing your presence and turning followers into loyal clients. I used to think it was all about growing my follower count but actually engagement is the most important.\n\nOne common complaint we hear is the time involved with capturing, editing, and posting content. What would your advice be to fellow hair pros with not enough hours in the day?\n\nI totally get it—creating content can be incredibly time-consuming. My advice is to batch your content creation. Set aside specific times during the week to capture photos and videos, and then use scheduling tools to post them. This way, you’re not constantly interrupted by the need to create content on the everyday. I also make sure I use each client I do to make multiple pieces of content, think beyond the usual before and after and capture things like your consultation process, the colouring process, styling etc. Each step can be its own piece of content, building you a library of incredibly low-effort content that will do well and give value to the viewer. Also, don’t be afraid to repurpose older content or share user-generated content from your clients. It’s a great way to keep your feed active without spending hours every day on it.\n\nWhen social can be so all-consuming, what are your top tips for setting boundaries and managing a work/life balance?\n\nIt’s so important to set boundaries with social media to avoid burnout. I’m a big believer in time blocking – set aside specific times in your calendar to edit and schedule your content as well as designating specific times for checking and posting on social media, rather than being on it all day. I also make it a point to unplug from my devices during personal time. It’s okay to take breaks from social media – your audience will understand, if you’re comfortable sharing that, honesty and authenticity really resonates with people. Remember, your mental health and well-being should always come first. Being mindful of the time you spend online will help you maintain a healthy work/life balance while still growing your business. I think it’s important to add as well that you shouldn’t compare yourself to others online, I used to fall prey to this and it was super damaging to my mental health, just be you and share what you feel is right for your business.\n\nConor James Doyle\n\nTalk us through your relationships with social media – how has it transformed the way you work?\n\nSocial media has changed how I work mostly through reach. I’m from a small town in Ireland, there’s no way I would have reached the opportunities I’ve had in LA, Australia, Europe and the UK if not for the audience I’ve connected with internationally online. I don’t even think it’s to do with the numbers but the connections I’ve made.\n\nWhat would you say is your favourite platform, and why?\n\nPersonally, I prefer Instagram. TikTok is great for reach and discovery of new people, but I think it cannot foster a connection with your audience. Instagram is somewhere you can get to know and nurture your community.\n\nAs well as the benefits, what would you say are some of the pitfalls or common misconceptions?\n\nThe main misconception is that big numbers = success. I know many creators with huge followings who struggle to monetise it. Your following is like a little garden you create. Success and prosperity rely on how you tend to it and how consistent you are. If you just focus on expansion the whole thing can fall apart.\n\nIf there was one thing you’d wish you had done differently when building your profiles differently, what would it be?\n\nRealise what my audience is really looking for instead of overcomplicating things and pushing out what I ‘thought’ they wanted based on seeing other creators. So many times, I’ve lost myself and point of view but ultimately I don’t regret that either. These mistakes help give us clarity and direction when navigating back to ourselves. When you’re on the right track it’s a feeling, you just kind of know.\n\nOne common complaint we hear is the time involved with capturing, editing and posting content, what would your advice be to fellow hair pros with not enough hours in the day?\n\nStop overcomplicating and start maximising. I really only do hair 2-3 times a month and when I have those clients in, the second I see a nice aesthetic shot I shoot. I bank a load of these throughout the service, sometimes only 3-5 seconds long. I’ll share some text or a helpful tip and that’s it. I also will recycle a lot and assemble them to create longer-form pieces with a different angle.\n\nWhen social can be so all-consuming, what are your top tips for setting boundaries and managing a work/life balance?\n\nAvoid checking first thing in the morning; if it’s your first hit of dopamine it tells your brain this is the most important source, and you will check it more during the day with more of a sense of urgency. Don’t take it to bed with you either. Treat it like your office or workspace and log off as you would work. Easier said than done and that’s why having a separate phone with zero social media has been a game changer for me. I leave my work phone in a separate room.\n\nAlso, a final note; forget the algorithm. If social is getting you down, take a break. It’s fine to go. It’s when most of your fresh ideas will flourish.\n\nMore for you\n\nSecrets Of Two Social Media Experts\n\nSecrets Of Two Social Media Experts\n\nFollowing the success of Stā Social, Samantha Cusick and Conor Doyle chat candidly about all aspects of social media.\n\nTom Smith Shares The Styles That Are Set To Define Autumn 2024\n\nTom Smith Shares The Styles That Are Set To Define Autumn 2024\n\nInternationally renowned stylist highlights practicality and warmth at the forefront of the season\n\nHow to Offer Blondes The Best Of Both Worlds\n\nHow to Offer Blondes The Best Of Both Worlds\n\nSiobhan Jones shares her freehand balayage technique for the perfect pairing of softness with high coverage.\n\nTom Smith Shares The Styles That Are Set To Define Autumn 2024\n\nTom Smith Shares The Styles That Are Set To Define Autumn 2024\n\nInternationally renowned stylist highlights practicality and warmth at the forefront of the season\n\nby Caitlyn | Documents\n\nAs we transition into autumn 2024, hair trends are focusing on blending cosiness, elegance, and practicality. According to Tom Smith, a renowned hair expert, this season’s haircuts are all about maintaining health and authenticity while embracing styles that transition seamlessly into cooler months. According to Tom, this season emphasises “health and wealth signalling,” with longer styles taking centre stage. Whether your clients are seeking a subtle update or a more defined, structured look, this season’s trends offer versatility and personalisation.\n\n“There’s a cosiness in the shapes we’re seeing this autumn,” says Tom, who explains that this season’s looks will favour longer, healthier hair and more manageable styles.\n\nAutumn brings a shift towards longer hairstyles and more practical, yet fashion-forward looks. According to Tom, there’s a “real lack of very short hair” in the current trends. Instead, we’re seeing an emphasis on maintaining healthy hair at various lengths, whether chin-length bobs or waist-length locks. He notes, thanks to innovations in haircare products, many have welcomed the choice to wear their hair longer to signal “health and wealth.”\n\nSabrina Carpenter styled by Laurie Heaps (@_hairbylaurie)\n\nOne style making a significant return is curtain bangs, offering a voluminous, face-framing look that brings softness and warmth. Although we won’t be leaving it behind, Tom highlights the appeal of this style in the cooler months, noting that it “brings cosiness in” and pairs beautifully with layered outerwear. “There’s a practicality element here,” he says, pointing out that curtain bangs can be refreshed without washing the entire head of hair, making it a low-maintenance yet stylish choice.\n\nSanaa Lathan styled by Kim Kimble (@kimblehaircare)\n\nThe tiara bun, a high bun placed at the crown of the head is making its way forward this season. Tom tells us that this strikes a balance between “practical sportiness” and a “regal element,” providing both elegance and lift for someone seeking a polished look. “A high bun like this does wonderful things to the cheekbone, lifts the face, and makes people feel taller and hold their posture higher,” he adds. This style’s versatility allows it to be worn sleek or with texture, depending on the client’s preference.\n\nSerena Williams styled by Angela Meadows (@angelameadowssalon)\n\nFor clients who want to embrace their natural texture, cloud curls offer a soft, ethereal look. These airy waves or curls create a youthful and carefree energy that transitions well from summer into the cooler months. “Cloud curls is very much that kind of theme,” Tom explains, emphasising that the relaxed, textured waves bring a touch of summer’s warmth into autumn. This style works especially well when combined with deeper, richer autumn tones.\n\nAlexa Demie styled by Igor Rosales- Jackson (@hairbyiggy)\n\nShorter cuts are also having a moment with styles like the tucked bob and laser cut bob. The tucked bob is a sleek and minimalist style that is both practical and stylish. By tucking the hair neatly behind the ears, this bob creates a polished look that works for all hair types and face shapes. Tom mentions that this style is perfect for the cooler months, as it offers a “more serious, groomed sharpness” after the casual looks of summer. The tucked bob is ideal for clients who want a clean, sophisticated look that requires minimal effort while still maintaining a refined edge.\n\nLily Collins styled by Jacob Schwartz (@jacobschwartzhair) and Gregory Russell (@gregoryrussellhair)\n\nFor clients seeking precision and structure, the laser-cut bob is the perfect choice. This sharp, one-length bob provides a bold and modern aesthetic, ideal for those who appreciate clean lines and attention to detail. As Tom describes it, this is the “tailoring of the haircuts” for autumn 2024, offering a sharp, defined look that pairs well with more tailored, structured fashion. The laser-cut bob works best for clients with fine hair, as the precise cut adds thickness and density to the hair, making it appear fuller and more structured.\n\nFor salon owners and stylists, autumn 2024 is the perfect time to refresh your service menu with these cosy yet chic styles. Clients are looking for cuts and styles that blend ease and sophistication, making it essential to focus on not only being fashionable but practical for the season. As Tom emphasises, this season is less about dramatic transformations and more about helping clients evolve their look naturally, promoting hair health and confidence. By staying on top of these trends and aligning with client preferences, salons can position themselves as ahead-of-the-curve in creating chic autumn styles that are both trendy and practical for the cooler months ahead.\n\nHow to Offer Blondes The Best Of Both Worlds\n\nHow to Offer Blondes The Best Of Both Worlds\n\nSiobhan Jones shares her freehand balayage technique for the perfect pairing of softness with high coverage\n\nby | TECHNIQUES\n\nL’Oréal Professionnel Paris global ambassador Siobhan Jones shares the perfect technique for delivering high-coverage blonde, using freehand balayage free weaving. “This technique is perfect for anyone who loves the softness of balayage, but is looking for the coverage of foils,” says Siobhan.\n\nDia Light Formula\n\nContour: 10.18 with 9vol\n\nRoots: 8.21 with 9 vol\n\nMid-lengths: 9.21 + 9.82 with 9 vol\n\nEnds: 10.18 with 9 vol\n\nGet the look\n\nStep 1: The model’s hair is a natural base seven.

This Is The Right Way To Support Them\n\nClients Experiencing Hair Loss? This Is The Right Way To Support Them\n\nTrichologist Mark Blake shares his expert guide on giving guidance to clients\n\nby Caitlyn | Industry News\n\nSummersby Media\n\nAs stylists and salon owners, you play a crucial role in your clients’ hair journeys. Hair loss can be an emotional experience for many people, but with knowledge and the right approach, you can guide clients towards better hair and scalp health. Understanding the causes, treatments, and preventative measures can transform how your clients manage their hair loss.\n\nEducating your clients about the importance of early intervention is key. Hair loss often worsens when left untreated. Leading trichologist, Mark Blake, tells us that the best thing for clients to do is “get advice and start a hair loss regime as quickly as possible.” Hair loss gets worse if left untreated, so doing nothing is going to let the problem get worse. By guiding your clients to act early, you can help them preserve their hair health and confidence.\n\nOne essential point to highlight is the seasonal nature of hair shedding. “Clients shouldn’t be alarmed if they notice more hair loss in September,” Mark shares. “It is the month that we see the highest proportion of natural hair loss in the Northern Hemisphere. It’s thought to be due to seasonal changes in light and weather.” While this is a natural occurrence, you should encourage clients to seek advice if they notice excessive or persistent shedding. Here are a few methods you can share with your clients, so they can start their health growth journey as soon as they leave the salon.\n\nMark’s Tips for Hair Growth Restoration\n\nMany clients may not realise how crucial their diet is to hair growth. Hair is composed of approximately 85 per cent protein, and a lack of it can severely impact growth. Blake reminds us that “hair only grows from the protein eaten or retained,” highlighting the importance of a well-balanced diet for hair health.\n\nSecondly, scalp care is critical but often neglected. Blake suggests that clients exfoliate their scalp every six weeks, explaining, “the scalp ages 12 times faster than the skin on the body and six times faster than the skin on the face. The scalp is where the hair must grow out of, and it needs looking after.”\n\nSome clients believe that washing their hair less frequently will help reduce hair loss, but Mark Blake warns against this misconception. “As a Trichologist, I see more problems from hair loss patients who don’t wash their hair frequently than from patients who do wash their hair frequently,” Blake explains. He adds: “Clients should treat their scalp like any other part of their body. They should probably treat it better…scalp health is directly linked to hair health.” Encouraging clients to wash their hair regularly, focusing on scalp health, can help mitigate issues related to hair loss.\n\nUnsplash\n\nHow to Further Support Clients\n\nAs trusted professionals, you can offer more than just styling. Offering scalp treatments, exfoliation services, and hair loss consultations can set your salon apart as a wellness hub for clients concerned about thinning hair. Plus, partnering with specialists, stocking trichologist-recommended products, and training your team in hair loss management will better serve your clients and build trust in your expertise.\n\nHair loss can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including genetics, hormonal changes, stress, nutrition, and even certain medical conditions or treatments. While understanding the root cause of hair loss is helpful, what’s more important is focusing on timely and effective intervention. Whatever the cause, action can prevent further loss and help restore hair health. The key is not dwelling on why hair loss happens, but rather how you can guide clients towards the best solutions to manage it.\n\nHair Loss Awareness Month is a great opportunity for salon owners to enhance their services and raise awareness about hair health, even by simply adding more targeted scalp health treatments to your service menu. Offering this added layer of care can position your salon as a leader in holistic hair care.\n\nHair Loss Awareness Month is a reminder that hair loss is a common issue, and it’s oftentimes tied up with many emotions, but it can be managed with the right knowledge and approach. As stylists, you are in a powerful position to provide education, support, and care for clients experiencing hair loss, helping them to regain their confidence and maintain healthy hair.\n\n“Focus On What Brings You Joy” – Sam Burnett On Finding Alignment Between Work And Life\n\n“Focus On What Brings You Joy” – Sam Burnett On Finding Alignment Between Work And Life\n\nThe owner of Hare & Bone shares what he’s learned about living his best (balanced) life\n\nby Kelsey | Conversations\n\nReflecting on my journey, I now understand the importance of finding alignment by setting boundaries and prioritising self-care. Early in my career, I often said yes to every project, driven by a desire to learn and excel. This enthusiasm, while beneficial, sometimes came at the cost of my wellbeing. Over time, I’ve learned that it’s okay to say no and to prioritise my health and personal life. This shift has not only improved my quality of life but has also enhanced my professional performance.\n\nMaintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial. I’ve learned to value rest, nutrition, and exercise as integral parts of my routine. Establishing a morning routine has been a game-changer for me, providing structure and setting a positive tone for the day. This balance between personal care and professional responsibilities ensures I can bring my best self to my work.\n\nUnderstanding and aligning with my core beliefs has been a significant part of my journey and part of the reason we moved to Davines, a brand that reflects our ethos and values. Authenticity, creativity, kindness, and sharing are the pillars that guide my decisions and actions. These values not only shape my professional approach but also resonate with my personal life, helping to create an alignment in both worlds. The B Corp status of Davines was a big attraction and their transparency and accountability inspired us as a business to look for the best practices and prioritise people over profit.\n\nSam with Davines\n\nDiscovering and embracing your purpose is a dynamic process. For me, mentoring has become a fulfilling aspect of my career. Whether guiding my salon team, working with the Fellowship, or supporting others in the industry, I find immense satisfaction in helping others grow. Your purpose will evolve, reflecting your growth and experiences.\n\nI understand that when starting your career, it’s tempting to seize every opportunity. With experience, I can offer this advice: focus on what brings you joy. People often talk about work-life balance, but when you find purpose in your career, the alignment naturally follows. You don’t need to chase everything all the time. Recognise what makes you feel good about yourself, and the rest will follow."
