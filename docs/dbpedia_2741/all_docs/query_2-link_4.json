        "text": "‘I’ve Loved You So Long’\n\nH H H\n\n“I’ve Loved You So Long” is the kind of film America’s moviemakers have all but given up on. An example of the French tradition of high-quality adult melodrama, conventional in technique but not story, this thoughtful, provocative film is slow developing because it’s all about character, about the tricky, fragile relationships that make us human; about, if you really want to get down to it, the reclamation of a soul.\n\nWhen you’re doing a film like this, you want the best acting you can get, and writer and first-time director Philippe Claudel chose brilliantly when he picked Kristin Scott Thomas to star as the shattered Juliette.\n\nThe bilingual Thomas is best known to domestic audiences for her Oscar-nominated performance in “The English Patient.” Her roles, whether in “Four Weddings and a Funeral” or “Gosford Park” or the recent French-language “Tell No One,” always have exuded a kind of imperturbable confidence. But her Juliette is nothing like that.\n\n“I’ve Loved You” opens with Juliette sitting in an airport terminal, waiting for her ride. To say she comes across as gaunt, plain and colorless is to understate the obvious. Juliette has the unmistakable look of a truly damaged person, a ghost in human form who is in the throes of permanent despair.\n\nLea, the harried, cheerful woman who finally comes to collect Juliette, is another type entirely. As played by Elsa Zylberstein (whom the director says he chose because he loves “the blend of joy and immense fragility she gives off”), Lea is married with two young children and a demanding job, yet she is the unselfish one in her life, the person who is always willing to do whatever it takes to make things go smoothly. Although Scott Thomas’ is the showier role, it takes Zylberstein’s complementary skill to make the scenario completely convincing.\n\nLea is also Juliette’s younger sister, but the women have not seen each other in 15 years, the time Juliette has been in prison. Because of the nature of her crime, their parents declared that Juliette no longer existed for the family and forcibly kept the sisters apart. Now Lea desperately wants to re-establish contact, to connect with the sister whose presence she was robbed of. As for what Juliette wants, that is more difficult to know — and that is the driving force of the film.\n\n“I’ve Loved You” is not without weaknesses, including a colleague of Lea’s (Laurent Grevill) whose empathy feels a bit schematic. But performances this strong and direction this sensitive make us simply grateful to have an emotional story we can sink our teeth into and enjoy.\n\nThis film — in French with English subtitles — is not rated. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes.\n\n— Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times\n\n‘RocknRolla’\n\nH H\n\nGuy Ritchie reshuffles a worn-out deck in “RocknRolla,” a return to the shady stylings that characterized his earlier flicks “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and “Snatch.” The on-screen names have changed, and the edited rhythms have been somewhat slowed, but more or less everything else follows formula: pump up the volume, tilt the camera, flex the muscle, strut the stuff, bang bang, blah blah.\n\nThere are the usual villains with funny names — a nice-and-easy Gerard Butler plays One Two, while the underdeployed Idris Elba plays his partner in London crime, Mumbles — committing the usual villainy while spouting the usual argot. There’s the big, bad boss, Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson), a thug in bespoke pinstripes who comes with an iron fist in a velvet glove called Archy (Mark Strong). There are drugs and a rock ‘n’ roll druggie, Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell). There’s the requisite femme fatale in stilettos, Stella (Thandie Newton), and the de rigueur scary, scarily rich Russian, Uri (Karel Roden). There are double-crosses and right hooks and ha-ha scenes of grim torture that come with throbbing musical accompaniment.\n\nIt isn’t all bad — many of the lads look lovely, and there’s a chase sequence that nicely devolves into an impressionistic blur of herky-jerky faces — but there isn’t much to chew on or mull over. The violence is idiotic and brutal (the story is just idiotic), but it’s also so noncommittal that it doesn’t offend. Like the filmmaking itself, the violence has no passion, no oomph, no sense of real or even feigned purpose. For Ritchie, a man who clearly appreciates fine tailoring (and kudos to the costume designer, Suzie Harman), a fist in the mouth or a bullet in the head is just a stylistic flourish, some flash to tart up the genre cliches he never seems to have bought in the first place.\n\nThis film is rated R (for violence). Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes.\n\n— Manohla Dargis, New York Times\n\n‘Saving Marriage’\n\nH H\n\nMaybe there’s a documentary out there in the future on gay rights that will take up as much space on a video store shelf as ”Eyes on the Prize,” that epic PBS series about the civil rights movement. This as-yet-unmade film would cut a similar path of historical education and emotional devastation. In the meantime, there are earnest testimonials like last year’s ”For the Bible Tells Me So” and exercises in righteousness like the new “Saving Marriage.”\n\nDirected by Mike Roth and John Henning, the film examines the fight to legalize gay marriage in Massachusetts. It manages to raise the most central argument of this debate: Is it more crucial to grant a segment of the electorate rights the majority enjoys or to let the people be heard by putting the amendment to a vote?\n\nThe filmmakers build a steady case for the former.\n\nThe movie is effective when it forgos talking heads (activists, politicians, lawyers) to observe the ground war between gay marriage and its opponents, namely the strategies gay-marriage advocates devise to keep the amendment from passing. In Peabody, Somerville, and Andover, for starters, men and women ran to unseat incumbents either opposed to gay marriage or more comfortable with the civil union ”compromise.”\n\nOpening locally just days before California votes on Proposition 8, “Saving Marriage” is a well-meaning but unremarkable documentary. Which is not to say that there’s nothing touching about the movie. In listening to gay men and women assert that they deserve to have their relationships legally recognized, the words “traditional” and “legitimate” come up a lot. Conventionality has rarely seemed like a more compelling human right.\n\nThis film is not rated. Runng time: 91 minutes.\n\n— Wesley Morris, Boston Globe\n\n‘The Haunting of Molly Hartley’"
