        "text": "The film emerged from a wider, AHRC-funded practice-as-research PhD entitled Affective Cinema, which experiments with cinematographic and directorial techniques, and methods of working with performers, in order to generate film structures that disrupt or offset narrative, semiotic and/or spatial coherence by the production of audiovisual affects. In this way, a certain boundary is being explored between the representational and the non-representational, which gives rise to a sense of 'affective significance'-a meaning that is felt before it can be thought.\n\nThe beginning of the art of acting in cinema depends on the technical development of the industry. Cinema began to present silent films because of the lack of technical means for recording sound at the time. The actor's expressive role in performing the dramatic character he represents in the film depends mainly on his physical abilities the embodiment of emotions in all situations that pass through the personality of the cinematic film. Many academic studies have compared and searched for differences in the performance of the theater and film actor. A study did not address the cinematic performance of a theater actor. The performance of the actor through the screen is also a feature of the cinematic performance of the scene. The combination of expressive techniques used by the audiovisual arts in a presentation designed to convey an idea to the recipient through the integration of artistic elements into a form of artistic creativity that has unity and aesthetic harmony must include the performance of the actor in the presentation. Therefore, studies and research should be conducted to identify this representative performance in the presentation.\n\nThe part played by acting in audiences’ responses to films is largely unexplored – but often assumed to be considerable. In this essay, we report on the results of a small research project into this, using the 1995 film The Usual Suspects as a focus and stimulus. Deliberately recruiting a mix of audiences, the project resulted in twelve discussion groups. Out of the responses of these groups, we explore the variety of ways in which acting plays a part within people’s responses, and outline a tentative model for theorising this relationship.\n\nThis paper starts from the premise that screen acting has taken a dominant place in the working life of the professional actor at the beginning of the 21st century. With the implications for the training of professional actors for the commercial sector in mind, I want to use close analysis of two scenes from one television drama series, &quot;Burn Up&quot; (Global Television/BBC 2008), to examine actors’ performance choices and the ways in which some key concepts of Stanislavskian actor training operate specifically in screen performance. In doing so I will make comparison between British and American styles and traditions of acting, again with reference to the work of Stanislavsky, the dominant theorist underpinning much British and American actor training.\n\nEver since Edwin S. Porter created the first story-telling film, The Great Train Robbery, in 1903, there has been a tendency to compare film with literature. The earliest books written on film technique, for example, The Art of the Moving Picture by Vachel Lindsay (1915), or The Photoplay by Hugo Muensterberg (1916), contained such comparisons but interestingly enough, none of these early critical books ever stressed upon the ultimate truth about the nature of film art -the fact that film is purely an independent medium, differing from literature not only in its method of expressing concepts, but also in the construction of its rhythms and forms. The film derives its power from the visual representation of concepts and secures its characteristic form and rhythm by the purely filmic process of editing; literature is a method of manipulating words and sentences in a manner designed to stir the thoughts and emotions of the reader. It is high time that the confusion between these two ar...\n\nIf film is a form of visual art, why does it rely mainly upon narrative text and is not more indebted to drama? Why are theatrical plays not so easily (and frequently) adapted for the screen as novels and short stories? Is it true, as Käte Hamburger suggests, that “filmed drama becomes epic”? In order to grasp the concept of film hybridism (both film theorists and film makers have long dealt with the natural tendency of film to absorb other art features and forms), in this paper I intend to address the issue of film genre by taking into account Jauss’s evolutional theory and confronting it with Frye’s concept of “radical of presentation”. André Bazin spoke of the impurity of film, whilst Manoel de Oliveira, who has been said to produce “theatrical films”, clearly states that “film adds to theatre the capacity of fixing the image in time”. Time is, in fact, a decisive factor in genre definition – as Hegel clearly demonstrated – and it is through the way that film deals with this factor that we are able to gauge either its distance from or its closeness to drama and/or to literature."
