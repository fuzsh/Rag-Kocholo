        "text": "Guy Ritchie returns to his gangster roots with RocknRolla, a comic caper about a bent land deal, a missing painting and the shifting power base in the London underworld. The cast features a who's who of young British acting talent, while Ritchie's ear for crackling dialogue and eye for stunning visuals returns following the dire one-two punch of Swept Away and Revolver. IGN caught up with him earlier this week to discuss crack-addled rock stars, Russian billionaires and his forthcoming take on Sherlock Holmes.\n\nYour screenplays are complex affairs - how long does it take you to write them?\n\nGuy Ritchie: Quite a long time. I amalgamate certain interesting narratives, like someone tells me a joke or conceptually something that I recognise, or even sometimes, I'll steal directly out of another movie or TV series. I'll see something that appeals to me.\n\nIf there's a unifying factor, it's to do with sub-culture. Like the gypsies in Snatch - that was a culture I was interested in. I don't know why, and I can't intellectualise it, but I think it's aspects of our culture which aren't exposed often. Criminals are constantly exposed, but it's a kind of criminal I'm interested in rather than a generic criminal.\n\nPeople say that my movies are gangster movies but they aren't. There's usually an aspect of the movie that involves professional gangsters, but usually the protagonists are good guys who have probably done a few naughty things. That's what I'm attracted to - not having them be literally bad or literally good. I like the dichotomy of being made to feel uncomfortable by the fact that he's a criminal, but I like him. I find that interesting, creatively, that people are not perfect.\n\nSo there aren't good guys and bad guys in Rocknrolla?\n\nRitchie: I think ultimately there are bad guys, but in general it's not about good guys and bad guys, it's a mixture of both of that. I think that's what resonates with us as audiences. I think with a film like this you want to be put in a hyper-realised version of that so it's not too prosaic and it doesn't reflect our lives in too much of a boring fashion, but at least it allows us to recognise bits of ourselves in that, and that's why people go to the cinema.\n\nSo is Tom Wilkinson's character - Lenny - one of those bad guys?\n\nRitchie: Yes. I think Tom's character is someone who just nurtured too much of his evil side, and ultimately, becomes blind to it. Other characters in the movie, like 'The Wild Bunch', struggle with that. How far are they prepared to go? Are they still good guys. The idea that a grass is amongst them â€“ on what rung on the ladder of evil does that come?\n\nYou've got Uri the Russian billionaire in your film - have you come across any Russian oligarchs?\n\nRitchie: I'm not sure if I have. I'm inspired by the media, and my life, and stories that I hear. You hear so many stories, and the vast majority are probably fictional, but you never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Especially when it comes to Russian oligarchs, because they are such fantastic stories.\n\nDid you have any concerns that [Chelsea Football Club chairman] Roman Abramovich might think that the character is based on him and take offence?\n\nRitchie: It's not supposed to be about it, it's supposed to be a commentary. I don't think Abramovich is a villain - at least that's my understanding. It's not about him per se. There's an influence, obviously, but there are other oligarchs out there who are clearly villainous, so it's an amalgamation of those tales I have heard.\n\nWas your crack addicted 'rocknrolla' based on any music stars in the media at the moment?\n\nRitchie: It's a commentary on that creative, talented, suicidal mission because it happens a lot. I'm not sure if it's completely specific to the UK, but it's something that we're familiar with and has been going on for as long as contemporary culture has been lining our papers.\n\nThis film does seem to be very much a throwback to your earlier films. Why was that?\n\nRitchie: There are probably 20 reasons. It's easy. I enjoy it. It's fun. It's challenging - I don't think easy and challenging are mutually exclusive. I know there's a market. I can tell there's a warm breeze blowing. When I do something more ambitious, like Revolver, a cool breeze blows, but with this, it's easy, and it's the kind of thing I like to see at the cinema. To me it feels fresh and fun. If I saw the poster, I'd go and see that movie, because it appeals to me. I suppose it's an act of indulgence in one respect, and the job is secondary to that.\n\nYou certainly mix up humour with the nasty stuff - is that your personal taste?\n\nRitchie: That's what I like in a movie. I never set them out to be conspicuously funny, but I like to chuckle, and I like to chuckle when it's uncomfortable for me to chuckle. That's not an intellectual process for me; the humour just ends up creeping in.\n\nRitchie directs Gerard Butler and Idris Elba. It certainly kicks off with a bang - is that important to you?\n\nRitchie: Well I like that. I remember the first time I saw Pulp Fiction and when the music comes in and the title comes up I thought it was a really audacious beginning, and you were immediately into it, so it was really ballsy.\n\nThere are a lot of so-called 'gay jokes' in the movie. Is that reflective of your sense of humour?\n\nRitchie: Not really. I think it's reflective of the humour your average villainous heterosexual male. As long as there are heterosexuals, there are going to be gay jokes. And it works the other way, but it's not me.\n\nIs it right that you have a Rocknrolla trilogy in mind?\n\nRitchie: I do, yes.\n\nSo who would be returning and what should we respect from parts two and three?\n\nRitchie: You'll have to wait and see.\n\nWhat about the Sherlock Holmes film you've got coming up?\n\nRitchie: Well we start filming in a month.\n\nAnd what kind of style should we expect?\n\nRitchie: I find it hard to answer that question in a fashion that you can understand, because it's a style, and to know exactly what that style is, you'd have to see the movie. We are going to make it stylish movie. We are choosing a particular stylistic motivation.\n\nWill it be funny?\n\nRitchie: Again I'm not sure. At one point it was funnier, then it became less funny, and I imagine it will end up somewhere in the middle.\n\nAnd are you pleased to have Robert Downey Jr. as your leading man?\n\nRitchie: It's great. I've seen quite a lot of him because Susan, his wife, was a producer on this film. In fact he's quite responsible for the design of the Rocknrolla poster because he was there when we were deciding. But it's great.\n\nRocknrolla is released in the UK on Friday."
