        "text": "In August of last year we ran a controversial look at 43 reasons why 2007 would be a great year for movies. Now that 2007 has nearly come and gone and almost all of those 43 movies have been released, it's time to look ahead at 2008. The last 12 months have played a major part in building the hype for most of the movies mentioned and I can now say that 2008 looks way more appealing at this moment than 2007 did at the same time last year. This could be the year that we see revolutionary new changes in Hollywood, not only as the Writers Strike ends but as we encounter films like Cloverfield, Speed Racer, and The Dark Knight. Let's take look at 54 reasons why 2008 will be an awesome year for movies and an even better year than 2007.\n\nThis is a comprehensive list of what will make 2008 a truly memorable year for movies.\n\nPlease visit the 2008 Release Schedule for updated release dates as well as the entire list of films opening in 2008.\n\nRelease dates listed below are subject to change.\n\n21\n\nRelease Date: March 28th, 2008\n\nDirector: Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde, Monster-in-Law)\n\nStarring: Jim Sturgess, Aaron Yoo, Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, Laurence Fishburne\n\nSynopsis: 21 is the fact-based story about six MIT students who were trained to become experts in card counting and subsequently took Vegas casinos for millions in winnings.\n\nThe Hype: The trailer makes this look like it could be the next best Vegas / cards movie with a great cast, and it's based off of a great book to start.\n\nAdventureland\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: Greg Mottola (Superbad)\n\nStarring: Jesse Eisenberg, Ryan Reynolds, Kristen Stewart, Martin Starr\n\nSynopsis: A comedy set in the summer of 1987 and centered around a recent college grad (Eisenberg) who takes a nowhere job at his local amusement park, only to find it's the perfect course to get him prepared for the real world.\n\nThe Hype: The director of Superbad, the late-summer sleeper hit comedy of 2007, is back again with a film he wrote that has a plot that sounds like it could rival Knocked Up or Superbad.\n\nAustralia\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge)\n\nStarring: Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, David Wenham\n\nSynopsis: Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape, they experience the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by Japanese forces firsthand.\n\nThe Hype: I think just mentioning that this comes from the colorful mind of Moulin Rouge's Baz Luhrmann and stars Hugh Jackman is enough to confirm that this is one to definitely watch out for.\n\nBabylon A.D.\n\nRelease Date: August 29th, 2008\n\nDirector: Mathieu Kassovitz (Gothika)\n\nStarring: Vin Diesel, Gérard Depardieu, Michelle Yeoh\n\nSynopsis: Veteran-turned-mercenary Thoorop (Diesel) takes the high-risk job of escorting a woman from Russia to China. Little does he know that she is host to an organism that a cult wants to harvest in order to produce a genetically modified Messiah.\n\nThe Hype: It looks like Vin Diesel is returning to his Pitch Black sci-fi roots and delivering a grungy, action-packed sci-fi film with some French finesse.\n\nBe Kind Rewind\n\nRelease Date: January 25th, 2008\n\nDirector: Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Science of Sleep)\n\nStarring: Jack Black, Mos Def, Danny Glover, Mia Farrow, Melonie Diaz\n\nSynopsis: A man (Black) whose brain becomes magnetized unintentionally destroys every tape in his friend's video store. In order to satisfy the store's most loyal renter, an aging woman with signs of dementia, the two men set out to remake the lost films, which include Back to the Future, The Lion King, and RoboCop.\n\nThe Hype: If you haven't seen it, watch the trailer now. Not only will VHS nostalgia hit hard, but you can't go wrong with the immensely creative Michel Gondry, Jack Black, and Mos Def all working together!\n\nBlindness\n\nRelease Date: August 8th, 2008\n\nDirector: Fernando Meirelles (City of God, The Constant Gardener)\n\nStarring: Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore, Gael Garcia Bernal, Danny Glover, Alice Braga\n\nSynopsis: A doctor's wife becomes the only person with the ability to see in a town where everyone is struck with a mysterious case of sudden blindness. She feigns illness in order to take care of her husband as her surrounding community breaks down into chaos and disorder.\n\nThe Hype: Although The Constant Gardener wasn't a hit, anything City of God director Fernando Meirelles works on is guaranteed to be incredible, and this time around it sounds like it most certainly could be.\n\nThe Box\n\nRelease Date: Late 2008\n\nDirector: Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko, Southland Tales)\n\nStarring: James Marsden, Cameron Diaz, Frank Langella\n\nSynopsis: A small wooden box arrives on the doorstep of a troubled married couple, who open it and become instantly wealthy. Little do they realize that opening the box also kills someone they do not know.\n\nThe Hype: Donnie Darko writer/director Richard Kelly is hopefully making a much more down-to-earth movie that's a solid thriller rather than an off-the-wall \"apocalyptic comedy\" like Southland Tales.\n\nBurn After Reading\n\nRelease Date: Late 2008\n\nDirector: Joel Coen & Ethan Coen (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Ladykillers, No Country for Old Men)\n\nStarring: George Clooney, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton\n\nSynopsis: A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to sell it.\n\nThe Hype: After directing one of 2007's most critically acclaimed movies, No Country for Old Men, the Coen's are already back finishing up Burn After Reading, and it seems like it could be another brilliant film.\n\nThe Changeling\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood (Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby)\n\nStarring: Angelina Jolie, Jeffrey Donovan, John Malkovich, Amy Ryan\n\nSynopsis: A mother's prayer for her kidnapped son to return home is answered, though it doesn't take long for her to suspect the boy who comes back is not hers.\n\nThe Hype: Eastwood steps back behind the camera with a script by J. Michael Straczynski (\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\", \"Babylon 5\") with what seems like a very promising period mystery story.\n\nChoke\n\nRelease Date: Late 2008\n\nDirector: Clark Gregg\n\nStarring: Sam Rockwell, Anjelica Huston, Kelly Macdonald, Brad William Henke\n\nSynopsis: A sex-addicted con-man pays for his mother's hospital bills by playing on the sympathies of those who rescue him from choking to death.\n\nThe Hype: The very next movie based on a book by Chuck Palahniuk since Fight Club in 1999. It's debuting at Sundance and I'm hoping Clark Gregg kept the story intact enough for it to be even remotely as good as Fight Club.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\n\nRelease Date: May 16th, 2008\n\nDirector: Andrew Adamson (Shrek, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe)\n\nStarring: Georgie Henley, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Ben Barnes, Warwick Davis\n\nSynopsis: The Pevensie siblings return to Narnia, where they are enlisted to once again help ward off an evil king and restore the rightful heir to the land's throne, Prince Caspian.\n\nThe Hype: Although I'm not a huge fan of the first Chronicles of Narnia from 2004, the trailer for this sequel makes it look a lot darker, grungier, and intense and it's certainly captured my attention.\n\nCity of Ember\n\nRelease Date: October 10th, 2008\n\nDirector: Gil Kenan (Monster House)\n\nStarring: Bill Murray, Tim Robbins, Martin Landau, Toby Jones\n\nSynopsis: For generations, the people of the City of Ember have flourished in an amazing world of glittering lights. But Ember's once powerful generator is failing, and the great lamps that illuminate the city are starting to flicker.\n\nThe Hype: The concept just sounds ridiculously cool, and you combine that with Bill Murray and I'm very interested to see what this is all about.\n\nCloverfield\n\nRelease Date: January 18th, 2008\n\nDirector: Matt Reeves (\"Felicity\")\n\nStarring: Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel, Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas\n\nSynopsis: Revolves around a monster attack in New York as told from the point of view of a small group of people.\n\nThe Hype: You've all seen the trailers by now and at this point the \"what the hell is it?!\" buzz is higher than almost any other movie in 2008. The early reviews have been all positive, and a new classic could be in the making.\n\nCurious Case of Benjamin Button\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac)\n\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas\n\nSynopsis: Tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with bizarre consequences.\n\nThe Hype: You take an intriguing story idea, combine it with Brad Pitt, and then let Fight Club director David Fincher make it all come to life - I'm there in an instant!\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nRelease Date: July 18th, 2008\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige)\n\nStarring: Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal\n\nSynopsis: Batman and James Gordon join forces with Gotham's new District Attorney, Harvey Dent, to take on a psychotic bank robber known as The Joker, whilst other forces plot against them, and Joker's crimes grow more and more deadly.\n\nThe Hype: Batman returns in the sequel to Christopher Nolan's 2005 revamp, and he's back fighting the Joker. This is already on its way to becoming the best movie of 2008 (or at least the biggest money-maker) from the early marketing alone. And the latest trailer is an absolute hit itself.\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\n\nRelease Date: December 12th, 2008\n\nDirector: Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose)\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates\n\nSynopsis: A remake of the 1951 classic sci-fi film about an alien visitor and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth.\n\nThe Hype: Although the response is quite negative at the moment, this could turn out pretty good if all the right elements fall into place, and that includes Keanu Reeves' performance and Scott Derrickson's directing.\n\nEagle Eye\n\nRelease Date: August 8th, 2008\n\nDirector: D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea, Disturbia)\n\nStarring: Shia LaBeouf, Michellle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson\n\nSynopsis: A young slacker and a single mom get tangled up in a terrorist cell plotting a political assassination.\n\nThe Hype: The duo that made Disturbia a huge hit earlier this year, director D.J. Caruso and Shia LaBeouf, are back together again in another thriller that sounds quite promising.\n\nFanboys\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: Kyle Newman\n\nStarring: Sam Huntington, Dan Fogler, Jay Baruchel, Kristen Bell\n\nSynopsis: Star Wars fans travel to Skywalker Ranch to steal an early copy of Episode I: The Phantom Menace for their dying friend.\n\nThe Hype: The long-delayed Star Wars comedic adventure is supposed to finally hit theaters in 2008 and you know what, I'm still looking forward to it like the Star Wars geek I am.\n\nThe Fighter\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain)\n\nStarring: Mark Wahlberg, Brad Pitt\n\nSynopsis: A look at the early years of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid '80s.\n\nThe Hype: Visionary filmmaker Darren Aronofsky is finally taking on a more mainstream film that will likely still include his incredible cinematography and brilliant filmmaking techniques.\n\nThe Forbidden Kingdom\n\nRelease Date: April 18th, 2008\n\nDirector: Rob Minkoff (The Lion King, Stuart Little, The Haunted Mansion)\n\nStarring: Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Michael Angarano\n\nSynopsis: A discovery made by a kung fu obsessed American teen sends him on an adventure to China, where he joins up with a band of martial arts warriors in order to free the imprisoned Monkey King.\n\nThe Hype: Despite Rob Minkoff's family film background, this kung fu epic still looks incredible, especially featuring Jet Li and Jackie Chan as well as fight choreography by Matrix and Kill Bill choreographer Yuen Wo Ping.\n\nFrost/Nixon\n\nRelease Date: 2008\n\nDirector: Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, The Da Vinci Code)\n\nStarring: Frank Langella, Michael Sheen, Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Toby Jones, Matthew Macfadyen\n\nSynopsis: A dramatic retelling of the post-Watergate television interviews between British talk-show host David Frost and former president Richard Nixon.\n\nThe Hype: Ron Howard's latest since The Da Vinci Code promises to be an epic political look at Nixon and Frost's interviews, and it's not often that Howard screws up.\n\nGet Smart\n\nRelease Date: June 20th, 2008\n\nDirector: Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3, Anger Management, 50 First Dates)\n\nStarring: Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson, Terence Stamp, Alan Arkin\n\nSynopsis: Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 for CONTROL, battles the forces of KAOS with the more-competent Agent 99 at his side.\n\nThe Hype: Possibly already the big comedy hit of 2008, it's the first movie since The Producers in 2005 to have Mel Brooks' touch. Besides that, the footage already out has planted this solidly as the soon-to-be funniest spy movie of the decade.\n\nThe Happening\n\nRelease Date: June 13th, 2008\n\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village)\n\nStarring: Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, Spencer Breslin\n\nSynopsis: A paranoid thriller about a family on the run from a natural crisis that presents a large-scale threat to humanity.\n\nThe Hype: Although not everyone is a fan (anymore), I always look forward to M. Night's movies and the early buzz is that The Happening is the most R-rated intense film he's made to date.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nRelease Date: November 21st, 2008\n\nDirector: David Yates (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix)\n\nStarring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis\n\nSynopsis: As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously \"This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince\" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.\n\nThe Hype: As the series works its way to the seventh and final book, it continues to ramp up the energy and improve in various ways, as not only have the actors gained experience, but so have the directors.\n\nHellboy 2: The Golden Army\n\nRelease Date: July 11th, 2008\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro (Blade II, Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth)\n\nStarring: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Luke Goss, Thomas Kretschmann\n\nSynopsis: The mythical world starts a rebellion against humanity in order to rule the Earth, so Hellboy and his team must save the world from the rebellious creatures.\n\nThe Hype: Guillermo, Perlman, Blair, and Jones are all much more experienced as we return to the Hellboy universe again since the first film in 2004. And del Toro, now a more well known director, is putting more energy, effort, and excellence into this sequel.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk\n\nRelease Date: June 13th, 2008\n\nDirector: Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, Unleashed)\n\nStarring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson\n\nSynopsis: The Incredible Hulk tells the story of Dr Bruce Banner, who seeks a cure to his unique condition, which causes him to turn into a giant green monster under emotional stress.

But all is lost when a new creature emerges - The Abomination.\n\nThe Hype: Seeing Edward Norton take on the role of the Hulk is the best thing that could ever happen to this comic book adaptation, and the passion he is bringing combined with Louis Leterrier directing will result in the Hulk movie we've always wanted.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\nRelease Date: May 22nd, 2008\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Munich)\n\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Shia LaBeouf, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent\n\nSynopsis: The latest installment of Indiana Jones is set at the height of the Cold War in 1957.\n\nThe Hype: This needs no introduction.

Even I'm interested in this despite having a passionate dislike for period pieces.\n\nPineapple Express\n\nRelease Date: August 8th, 2008\n\nDirector: David Gordon Green (George Washington, All the Real Girls, Snow Angels)\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Amber Heard\n\nSynopsis: A stoner and his dealer are forced to go on the run from the police after the pothead witnesses a cop commit a murder.\n\nThe Hype: The powerhouse Judd Apatow production team is ready to redefine and reinvigorate the stoner comedy genre with Pineapple Express, a half-action, half-comedy mega-movie.\n\nRambo\n\nRelease Date: January 25th, 2008\n\nDirector: Sylvester Stallone (Paradise Alley, Rocky Balboa)\n\nStarring: Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz, Paul Schulze, Matthew Marsden\n\nSynopsis: In Thailand, John Rambo assembles a group of mercenaries and leads them up the Salween River to a Burmese village where a group of Christian aid workers allegedly went missing.\n\nThe Hype: Like Rocky before it, Sly Stallone has returned to put a final cap on this franchise and so far the incredibly gory trailers have evoked an overwhelmingly positive response.\n\nRepo!

The repossession clause is a killer, however.\n\nThe Hype: Although I'm still unsure of what exactly to expect, Repo is such an off-the-wall and unique concept that I can't help but be excited to see what Darren Lynn Bousman has cooked up.\n\nRocknRolla\n\nRelease Date: October 3rd, 2008\n\nDirector: Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch)\n\nStarring: Gerard Butler, Thandie Newton, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jeremy Piven\n\nSynopsis: London's criminal underworld takes notice of a Russian mobster's shady land deal, a scam that puts millions of dollars up for grabs.\n\nThe Hype: Possibly Guy Ritchie's big return to excellent British mob movies since 2000 and Snatch, which is a great thing considering how awesome and how unique of a filmmaker Ritchie is.\n\nThe Ruins\n\nRelease Date: April 4th, 2008\n\nDirector: Carter Smith\n\nStarring: Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Shawn Ashmore, Joe Anderson\n\nSynopsis: A group of friends whose leisurely Mexican holiday takes a turn for the worse when they, along with a fellow tourist embark on a remote archaeological dig in the jungle, where something evil lives among the ruins.\n\nThe Hype: Early buzz is saying that this could be the big horror movie of 2008, especially being adapted from an apparently quite horrific novel.\n\nScanners\n\nRelease Date: October 17th, 2008\n\nDirector: Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II, III, IV, Repo! The Genetic Opera!)\n\nStarring: Unannounced\n\nSynopsis: Remake of the 1981 David Cronenberg horror classic in which \"Scanners\" have great psychic power, strong enough to control minds.

Abrams is revamping this epic franchise back into full action and turning it into a mainstream fascination.\n\nTrailer Trash\n\nRelease Date: August 22nd, 2008\n\nDirector: Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel: Part I & II)\n\nStarring: Unannounced\n\nSynopsis: A series of fake trailers strung together into a feature film.\n\nThe Hype: Although Grindhouse didn't fare too well at the box office, the film (and its fake trailers) was one of the best of the year, which is why I can't wait to see what sick madness the controversial Eli Roth has dreamt up over countless fake trailers.\n\nValkyrie\n\nRelease Date: October 3rd, 2008\n\nDirector: Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men 2, Superman Returns)\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Bill Nighy, Carice van Houten, Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Wilson\n\nSynopsis: Based on actual events, a plot to assassinate Hitler is unfurled during the height of WWII.\n\nThe Hype: Given that it's Bryan Singer, the expectations are high and after watching the trailer, my perception is that it could be the best WWII movie since Saving Private Ryan.\n\nVantage Point\n\nRelease Date: February 22nd, 2008\n\nDirector: Pete Travis\n\nStarring: Dennis Quaid, William Hurt, Matthew Fox, Sigourney Weaver, Forest Whitaker\n\nSynopsis: With a Rashomon narrative style, the attempted assassination of the president is told from five different perspectives.\n\nThe Hype: The very first trailer that dropped over the summer for Vantage Point has since kept up the energy and excitement as well as my expectations for an early-in-the-year action-thriller hit.\n\nWall-E\n\nRelease Date: June 27th, 2008\n\nDirector: Andrew Stanton (A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo)\n\nStarring: Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, Ben Burtt\n\nSynopsis: The year is 2700. WALL•E, a robot, spends every day doing what he was made for. But soon, he will discover what he was meant for.\n\nThe Hype: I'm a sucker for sci-fi and I'm a sucker for Pixar. From the trailers, photos, and talk so far, this could be the best Pixar movie yet.\n\nWanted\n\nRelease Date: June 27th, 2008\n\nDirector: Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch)\n\nStarring: James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Common\n\nSynopsis: A young man finds out his long lost father is an assassin. And when his father is murdered, the son is recruited into his father's old organization and trained by a man named Sloan to follow in his dad's footsteps.\n\nThe Hype: This seems unique enough from the trailer to be pretty damn good, also considering I love fresh new styles from Europe and comic book adaptations - and this is made up of both of those.\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are\n\nRelease Date: October 3rd, 2008\n\nDirector: Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation)\n\nStarring: Catherine Keener, Benicio Del Toro, Forest Whitaker, Lauren Ambrose, Catherine O'Hara\n\nSynopsis: An adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic children's story, where Max, a mischievous little boy, creates his own world - a forest in habited by fabulous wild creatures who crown Max as their ruler.\n\nThe Hype: Spike Jonze is up there with Michel Gondry (see Be Kind Rewind above) as being one of the most creative and unique filmmakers in the entire world. The promo photos I've seen so far and very early buzz that I've heard has lead me to believe that this is a gem in the works.\n\nThe X-Files 2\n\nRelease Date: July 25th, 2008\n\nDirector: Chris Carter\n\nStarring: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Amanda Peet\n\nSynopsis: Unannounced\n\nThe Hype: I'll be honest - I loved the original X-Files movie from 1998, despite not being a fan of the show. And now they're coming back with what could be an even better and more thrilling story.\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno\n\nRelease Date: Late 2008\n\nDirector: Kevin Smith (Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Clerks II)\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Jason Mewes\n\nSynopsis: Lifelong platonic friends Zack and Miri look to solve their respective cashflow problems by making an adult film together. As the cameras roll, however, the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought.\n\nThe Hype: Kevin Smith rarely goes wrong and after Clerks II in 2006, I'm confident that this will be just as good, if not even better than that.
