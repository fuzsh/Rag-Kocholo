        "text": "After the critical and commercial drubbing he received for Revolver, his tail-chasing deconstruction of the genre he popularized in the late 1990s, Guy Ritchie's career as a purveyor of hipster crime movies by all rights should have been over. Mind you, that might suggest that his career as a whole is over, since he's only done one non-crime film in his career and it was the disastrous remake of Swept Away. But one might think that he would explore some other creative options after discovering that audiences didn't find his supposed cleverest trick very clever, if they found it at all.\n\nUnfortunately (for whom remains to be seen), Ritchie's affection for colorful criminals and convoluted plotlines remains unabated, at least evidenced by Revolver's follow-up. RocknRolla, his latest, admittedly goes down far more smoothly than its predecessor, but proves to be just as much an exercise in substance-less style, eliciting the dangerous question \"who cares?\" from an audience (much less a fan base) that at this point only barely does.\n\nGerard Butler, capitalizing poorly on the stardom he won as the star of 300, plays One Two, a low-level crook who conspires with his partner Mumbles (Idris Elba) to fleece a wealthy developer named Uri Obomavich (Karel Roden) out of millions. The robbery goes off without a hitch thanks to inside information from Uri's comely accountant Stella (Thandie Newton), but the pair runs afoul of a London mob boss named Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) who runs the city. In the meantime, everyone is looking for Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), a drug-addled rock star who comes into possession of a treasured painting that may make or break a deal that could fill Cole's coffers for life.\n\nCLICK HERE to read the full RocknRolla review by Todd Gilchrist.\n\nScore: 5 out of 10\n\nVideo and Presentation\n\nRitchie's style is slick, decidedly dark and a bit sepia-toned. That comes across just fine here in a picture that is true to the theatrical version, offered in a widescreen format on a dual-layer disc. The quick wipes and rapidly moving camera don't pose any problems, and we detected no digital flaws or clarity issues in the transfer. Some of the scenes inside the Battersea Power Station are a bit too dark, but the streams of light pouring through make for a nice contrast. For a modest-to-low-budget production without any spectacular visuals or bright, vivid colors, the image is appealing enough.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nThe audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. Like all of Ritchie's movies, music plays an important part, and there's plenty of thumping to set the tone. Strong's voiceover narration is always clear, though some of the dialogue in the busy London streets is a bit lost in the mix at times (it may help those with trouble deciphering the thick accents to turn on the English SDH subtitles). Sound effects like the snap of a gunshot or screeching tires also living up the wide, spacious track. The Dolby Digital track is also offered in French and Spanish as well.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nExtras and Packaging\n\nThis two-disc \"special edition\" is only special in that one of those discs includes a digital copy for downloading to your personal media player. The case comes in a protective cardboard sleeve with matching cover art.\n\nThe extras include:\n\nCommentary by Writer/Director Guy Ritchie and Co-Star Mark Strong\n\nDeleted Scene\n\nGuy's Town\n\nThe commentary is a fun listen. Ritchie talks about the inspiration for the film, which came at a time when real estate was expanding in London at unsustainable levels. The director seems pretty with the end result, and himself (he frequently quotes his favorite lines before the actors speak them), and Strong only reinforces that with plenty of praise of his own. Aside from that, though, it's a pretty interesting track. Ritchie reveals that a lot of the script was based on real stories he's heard about London's criminal underworld. There's also the usual behind-the-scenes anecdotes that give you an insight into what it was like to be on set. There's also a bit of fun London trivia sprinkled throughout.\n\nThe deleted scene is titled \"Will you put the cigarette out?\" It's a two-minute scene, mainly between Butler and Elba at the gym. While I won't deny enjoying seeing Butler on a treadmill, it really is of little consequence to the plot of the film and probably best left out. It's a little odd that there should be only one scene here, though. And there's no director commentary to explain whey it was cut.\n\n\"Guy's Town\" is described as a reflection of the director's fascination with ever-evolving London. Ritchie talks some more about his observations of the changes in the city over the past decade, but this featurette includes input from the actors and crew members as well. For anyone who loves London or is even slightly curious about it, this is a fascinating bit of modern history and an intimate look from an insider's point of view. The segments covers some of the famous landmarks used as locations in the film, including Battersea Power Station, Royal Chelsea Hospital, Wembley Stadium and Canary Warf.\n\nTaken as a whole, the features are a little slim. There's no real \"making of\" featurette here or any sort of input from the film's bigger stars, like Butler, Wilkinson and Newton. It leaves the viewer with a pretty good idea of how the director feels about his film and its setting, but that's about it.\n\nScore: 5 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite being a little skimpy on the extras, the quality of this release should be enough to please Ritchie fans. It doesn't hold up against earlier, better films like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or even Snatch, but it's not a bad way to spend an evening on the couch with a bowl full of popcorn."
