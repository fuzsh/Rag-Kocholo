        "text": "2.  Cinema distinguished itself as the twentieth century’s genuinely international medium.  The apparatus called as cinematographe, invented by the Lumiere brothers, was carried on the backs of operators from region to region where people gazed at pictures of themselves and their surroundings taken just maybe a few days ago.  Then this footage was taken to Paris, which functioned as a depot in 1900.\n\n3.  To understand the concept of world cinema, the author categorizes it in two ways.  First, the patterns whereby a certain set emerged that distributors, critics, scholars and cinephiles consider to belong to the class of world cinema, should be identified. Second, we can note distinct phases of world cinema that reveal the aesthetic criteria employed to define this quite varied set of films which seem to speak to audiences everywhere.\n\n4.  The certain films travel out of phase, the cinema is out of phase with itself. The critic, the scholar, the cinephile can find themselves repositioned by certain films that rework their understanding of what the cinema holds out, what it represents, to whom.\n\n5.  The author proposes 5 phases that periodize world cinema history;  Cosmopolitan These phases often  National overlap and coexist  Federated  World  Global\n\n6.  The author makes a comparison between television and the cinema. He says the film image leaps from present to past, since what is edited and shown was filmed at least days, weeks or months earlier. This separates filmmaker from spectator and this condition constitutes cinema’s difference from television. Films display traces of what is past, where television feels present.  Television is sold as a furniture. It is a part of our daily life. However, we leave our house to go to the movies. The author relates this to jetlag. It is like we are taken on a flight.\n\n7.  There is also a comparison between Hollywood and East Asia cinemas’ development. Continous narrative with Hollywood’s norms is seen as the body of a tree and mainly European alternatives are branches and forks.  However, East Asia cinema was not able to develop like that. Neither the Chinese nor the Koreans could see a Japanese film for decades after World War II, for example.  Nevertheless, Asian cinema has many cosmopolitan and local forms and negotiation of these forms may be the key of current energy of Asian cinema.\n\n8.  Then, he returns to the beginning with an Asian point of view. Lumiere’s cinematographe was thought to complete the mission of open up Japan.  Images of Mount Fuji, The Emperor’s Palace and Japanese beauties in kimonos were being seized by the camera and shipped to the West  At the same time, this technology brought images of Western customs, values and commodities to Japan.  This tempted some Japanese to cast their allegiance with a cosmopolitan community.\n\n9.  The author mentions Junichiro Tanizaki and his fantastic tale called Jinmenso. In the story, the very face of Japan, Utagawa Yurie, is kidnapped to Hollywood where she serves to producers. This actress returns to Japan in vengeance to suck the soul from anyone who dares to watch this film alone at night. It is like a prototype of Ringu.\n\n10.  In its opening passage, Jinmenso imagines an international comradeship of enthusiasts, adventurous men in Tokyo, Shangai and colonial outposts in the South Seas, all on the lookout for dangerous amusements issuing from Los Angeles, and purveyed by a company named Globe Films.  The interplay of the national and the international forces evident in the business pratices of both the fictional Globe Films and the genuine Lumiere brothers, encourages the adoption of another cognate, the transnational.\n\n11.  The word means geographical extension, proposing not just a field to survey but also a process to understand.  Successive historical phases alter the process of cinema’s transnationality.  Multiple notions of cinema always coexist but new notions can be seen emerging to color each phase.\n\n12.  Interwar years drew the attention and most often the allegiance of many intellectuals back to their separate lands and traditions.  Sound supported the cinema’s nationalist turn by immediately anchoring every film to a linguistic community and its literature. Everywhere foreign actors were replaced by performers from the national theater because thed have the national speech patterns and physical gestures and this evoked a feeling of familiarity.\n\n13.  This is how many cinemas managed to flourish unders the shadow of Hollywood, which has indefinite resources in technology, financing and marketing.  Serials during the age of broadcast television, the routine of genres and the routines of actors kept audiences of the interwar years mainly tuned in their respective homelands.  The author also refers to Benedict Anderson. Cinema extends Anderson’s assertion that national was made possible with the advent of daily newspapers linking readers across the land simultaneously.\n\n14.  The victory of the Allies over the fascist state didn’t bring an end to the reality of nations. New entities and new rivalries were placed on the world chessboard. Like East Germany, North Korea, Israel.  The realities of cinema like those of politics were hardly overturned all at once. The USSR, for instance, persisted in its jingoistic socialist realism, produced by an unchanged cultural bureaucracy.\n\n15.  Hollywood films rolled behind American troops to reinforce its unchallenged claim to overseas distribution.  The military vocabulary often associated with big business (tactics, strategies, marketing offensives, trade wars, and treaties), plus the maintenance of personnel in outposts abroad, remind us that as an ‘idea of cinema’ nationalism was hardly broken by World War II. Neverthelss, another idea rose to challenge it, signaled by the world ‘federation.’  He mentiones Europe, that it looked up Switzerland for political idea because Switzerland successfully balanced the partial independence of its many cantons and several linguistic groups.\n\n16.  Die Letzte Chance, a social realist allegory of refugees who struggle to cross into the safety zone of Switzerland won the prize in Cannes. This award also means the promise that film from anywhere could speak as they might choose and be given a chance to make a diffeence culturally and politically.\n\n17.  He mentiones De Rougemont and his idea about the nation. The problem with it is that it had become an abstraction that cost individuals their freedom and communities, their distinctive characters. The federal model, however, encourages cooperation, since its primary unit is the local community where people are more likely to trust each other. For needs that trascend the local, De Rougemont suggests a regional linkage of ‘united communities.’\n\n18.  The federation model fosters both equality and difference in artistic expression. For example, a minor Swiss film could be taken just as seriously as a Hollywood product.  Resisting large theater chains, federalism promotes local control over exhibition and it encourages alliances among neighboring locals.  This federal idea incubated most successfully in war-raged Europe where it served as a defensive strategy to ward off imperial threats from the U.S and USSR. The moral force of film festivals, for instance, lay precisely in their egalitarian pan-nationalism.\n\n19.  From the perspective of the West, the 1970’s, this decade when film studies took root in the U.S was utterly unremarkable. Except for the New German director and the new American cinema of Scorsese, Coppola and Malick. And except for what was then termed the Third Cinema of Brazilian cinema novo, nuevo cine argentino, and Cuban cinema. All three of these movements were taken to be new waves with directly political, rather than cultural ambitions. Their fates depended on the vicissitudes of state politics.\n\n20.  Festivals played a crucial role in the transition of becoming ‘world’ rather than ‘international’ events. Scanning the first 25 years of festival submissions, one is struck that no major festival screened East Asian titles except Japanese. Indeed few titles come from anywhere outside Europe. After 1968, however, the major festivals under strong leaders actively shaped their own lineup, opening up to for more films.\n\n21.  When the Italian public service broadcaster RAI stopped sponsoring films in the late 1970’s, the blood was drained from European art cinema. So, it was left to film festivals to present alternative possibilities, that increasingly were being taken up in the elsewhere.  Films from places never before thought of as cinematically interesting, surprised Western cinephiles. As for Europe, the most vibrant works can be expected now from its edges, from Yugoslavia on one side and from Ireland on the other.\n\n22.  By 1990, the striking films from Taiwan and the PRC had already drawn so much attention from both the West and from their respective government that it would be disingenous to speak of the natural development of these movements as if films were being mined or harvested from the land.\n\n23.  World systems imply transnational operations and negotiations that encourage the spread and interchange of images, ideas, and capital across and throughout a vast but differentiated cultural geography.\n\n24.  As late as the 1960’s, exported movies traveled by ship, leaving an interlude of weeks between production and reception.  But after 1990, video has come to supplement memory, and films spread massively and swiftly.\n\n25.  Hybridity today, in the world of DNA code and of genetic modification and manipulation, is a very different matter. The very idea of hybridityhas becoma a postmodern concept.  In this new postmodern process what happens is that a single characteristic fragment is selected from one gene and inserted into another one.\n\n26.  In his article, Frederic Jameson, mentions the relationship between globalization and hybridization. He refers to two films, Dust and Happy Together. He points out the global hybridization effects on these films. In the first film, he indicates that the American protagonists, the classic Western frontier cowboys, are inserted into the cell of the Balkan landscape and society like a virus inserted into the host gene. As  For Happy Together, the most important fact he suggests, is the exclusion of any reference to the United States. It is left out of the film. It is an unusual situation because on the stereotypical global system, everything passes through the United States. Happy Together breaks this stereotype and shows a connection between cultures which falls outside of the conventional scheme."
