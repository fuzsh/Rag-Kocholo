        "text": "People ask a question.\n\nWhat's a RocknRolla?\n\nAnd I tell them it's not about drums,\n\ndrugs and hospital drips.\n\nOh, no.\n\nThere's more there than that,\n\nmy friend.\n\nWe all like a bit of the good life.\n\nSome, the money.\n\nSome, the drugs.\n\nOthers the sex game,\n\nthe glamour or the fame.\n\nBut a RocknRolla,\n\noh, he's different.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause a real RocknRolla\n\nwants the f***ing lot.\n\nMy name's Archy,\n\nformerly known as Archibald.\n\nI work for a man called Lenny Cole.\n\nAnd Lenny Cole has the keys\n\nto the back door of this booming city.\n\nLet me give you an example\n\nof how Lenny works his magic.\n\nTwo years ago,\n\nthis property cost 1 million pounds.\n\nToday, it costs 5 million.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nAttractive tax opportunities\n\nfor foreign investment...\n\n...restrictive building consent\n\nand massive hedge-fund bonuses.\n\nLondon, my good man...\n\n...is fast becoming the financial\n\nand cultural capital of the world.\n\nLondon is on the rise.\n\nProperty value has gone one way: up.\n\nAnd this has left the natives struggling\n\nto keep a foothold in the property ladder.\n\nI can't teach you how to skin a cat...\n\n...but I can tell you a lot\n\nabout the money in bricks and mortar.\n\nLike he said, it's going one way.\n\nYou need to see a lawyer.\n\nWe do need to see a lawyer.\n\nWell, it looks like a great deal.\n\nThese are the plans.\n\nIt'll cost 10,\n\nand it'll be worth 20 with planning.\n\nBut, first, you gotta give\n\nthe Councillor a drink.\n\nSame deal as before.\n\nI'll tell them they've got the planning.\n\nThank you, Councillor.\n\nYou'll get the planning.\n\nTake care of the Councillor,\n\nand it'll move like sh*t through a goose.\n\nWe need help.\n\nLenny Cole.\n\nDog number one.\n\nBet he moves fast\n\nand likes bricks and mortar.\n\nI do move fast,\n\nand I love bricks and mortar.\n\nProperty's always a safe bet...\n\n...but you gotta know what you're doing,\n\nthis ain't soft money.\n\nBecause of these boys'\n\ncriminal records...\n\n...the bank won't lend them\n\nthe money they need.\n\nEnter Mr. Lenny Cole...\n\n...London's money-loaning\n\nand fast-moving property magician.\n\nDon't let me down, boys.\n\nCome on, give me your hand.\n\nAnd this is where he waves\n\nhis black magic wand.\n\nCan't talk now,\n\nbut there's been a problem.\n\nI can't get you the planning.\n\nSorry, boys, can't get the planning.\n\nOh, isn't that an unpleasant surprise.\n\nBecause they don't wanna owe Lenny.\n\nHe can't get the planning.\n\nThat's right, sweetheart.\n\nCan't get the planning?\n\nYou've been f***ed.\n\nWhat do you mean\n\nyou can't get the f***ing planning?\n\nYou owe me.\n\nRight, I get the building,\n\nyou lose your share...\n\n...and I'm still out of pocket\n\ntwo large ones.\n\nFind it.\n\nThey know they'll have to pay Lenny\n\nbefore the month is out.\n\nBecause Mr. Cole has ways of making life\n\nvery, very uncomfortable.\n\nWe better find it.\n\nWhat they don't know\n\nis that Lenny controls the councilors...\n\n...the judges and the lawyers.\n\nNo planning permission will be given\n\nuntil Lenny wants it.\n\nAnd now that he owns the building,\n\nhe wants the permission.\n\nHello, Councillor?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, I hear you got that car\n\nyou wanted.\n\nYou're very generous, Len.\n\nRight, now, sort that planning out,\n\nwill you?\n\n- Sorted, Lenny.\n\n- Good.\n\nWhat's wrong with you, Archy?\n\nWas that not a bit strong, Len?\n\nThey come from the same place as you.\n\nYou're gonna clean them out.\n\nThe same place as me?\n\nDo I look like a f***ing immigrant?\n\nNo one gave me a leg up.\n\nThey need a little bit of fear,\n\notherwise, they'll come up against me.\n\nThey need a little lesson, don't they?\n\nAnd that is an example\n\nof how Lenny works.\n\nNow, today is Lenny's big day.\n\nHe's hit the big time...\n\n...because a new Russian billionaire\n\ndesires Lenny's property contacts.\n\nHe wants planning permission\n\nwhere the law won't allow.\n\nLenny Cole is here.\n\nLenny will come through...\n\n...but he will rape that Russian\n\nfor every ruble he can get.\n\nNice to see you, Uri.\n\nGood. Come and take a seat.\n\nExcuse me if I am hasty,\n\nbut I have a busy day.\n\n- Oh, that's all right.\n\n- Sit.\n\nI can see we are very much alike,\n\nyou and I, Lenny.\n\nWe like to get things done.\n\nWhat's it going to cost me?\n\nFirst, let me make it clear exactly\n\nhow we can help you benefit from this deal.\n\nWithout me,\n\nyou'd be waiting five to 10 years...\n\n...before you got permission\n\nto erect your arena.\n\nSecondly, with British law\n\nas it so stands...\n\nLenny, how much?\n\nSeven million euros.\n\nI expect the guarantee that I have consent\n\nwithin six months and no red tape.\n\nOh, you got it.\n\nConsider it done.\n\n- Drink?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nThat's a nice painting, Uri.\n\nIt's got depth, you know.\n\nThat picture has brought me nothing\n\nbut luck, Lenny.\n\nIt's my lucky picture.\n\n- Yeah?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nYou like?\n\nYeah.\n\nTake it for a while.\n\nMaybe it will give you luck.\n\nOh, no, Uri, I... You know, I couldn't.\n\nWe are partners now, I insist.\n\nI will get it sent around to your house.\n\nYou can give it back to me\n\nwhen our deal's finalized.\n\nHm?\n\nWell, I thought you lot drank vodka.\n\nWhiskey is the new vodka.\n\nYou're not joining me?\n\nI don't drink.\n\n- Cheers.\n\n- Cheers.\n\n- You all right, Len?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nBecause you're looking a bit pink.\n\nGet us some water\n\nand a wet wipe live-o, will you, Turbo?\n\nRight away, Len.\n\nHe tried to poison me, the dirty Cossack.\n\nLook, stop messing about,\n\njust give me the bottle.\n\nSorry, Len.\n\nHow is the billionaires club?\n\nWell, I tell you what, this Communism\n\ndidn't slow him down, did it?\n\nI'll tell you what, Arch.\n\nWe've hit the big time here.\n\nWell, what's wrong?\n\nWhere's the famous Archy smile?\n\nYou gotta watch yourself with this lot.\n\nI mean, times are changing.\n\n- They ain't no respecters of the old school.\n\n- Oh, bollocks.\n\nThere's no school like the old school,\n\nand I'm the f***ing headmaster.\n\nThat's why he come to me.\n\nGot it?\n\nYeah, got it.\n\nYou think you should have lent him\n\nyour lucky picture?\n\nIt makes the peasant feel royal.\n\nDon't spoil it,\n\nwe need him at the moment.\n\nI want that consent.\n\nCall the accountant\n\nand get her to clear the money.\n\nIf Uri's gonna turn over seven large ones\n\nto grease Lenny's contacts...\n\n...he's gonna need it in cash.\n\nAnd for that,\n\nhe needs his personal accountant.\n\nMeet the very gifted\n\nand the financially creative Stella.\n\nYou know why you get deals?\n\nBecause those sad, fat, old men like it\n\nwhen you swear at them.\n\nThey shake like cocktails\n\nand sweat like Semtex...\n\n...when you raise that posh, little voice.\n\nYou, my love, are a rare commodity.\n\nNow, come on, give your Bertie a smile.\n\nI don't feel like smiling.\n\nI'm a 30-year-old accountant\n\nmarried to a homosexual lawyer.\n\nI'm a beard without kids, Bertie.\n\nFor a marriage of convenience,\n\nthis can be quite inconvenient.\n\nStella, we need to talk.\n\nYes, she's right here.\n\nIt's Omovich.\n\nYou sure he isn't gay?\n\nBut what the Russian doesn't know...\n\n...is that his accountant\n\nhas got bored of the safe life...\n\n...and is looking for excitement\n\nin all the wrong places.\n\nWelcome to the Speeler.\n\nThis hot little house of crime is home\n\nto a particularly nefarious group..."
