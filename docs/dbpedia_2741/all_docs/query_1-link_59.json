        "text": "Race to Witch Mountain\n\nKids will like it, but it’s a kind of an up-and-down flick. Some of the action and special effects are definitely second rate, and—though I like The Rock quite a bit—he isn’t given much to do in this one.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRambo\n\nSylvester Stallone has always known how to tell a tight, dramatic story and he proves it again with this film. Look who’s talking, but it’s a little bloodier than it needed to be, or maybe a lot bloodier. Anyway, it’s nice to see Stallone doing what he does well once again. The direction is quite good and Rambo holds up–he looks great for his age. Wish I could say the same.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRampage\n\nI suspect that whoever put this movie together was very familiar with the Zoo TV series. The direction is definitely better, but the special effects are just as cheesy. Just love that monster alligator climbing up the side of a skyscraper. On the other hand, I always enjoy seeing Dwayne Johnson. B-\n\nRango\n\nThis movie has extraordinary vocal talent and terrific art direction. The part that mystifies me is that there were several families in the theater when we watched the movie. Much of the dialog totally flies over the head of most anyone under 12 or 13, as well as many of us who are quite a bit older.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRed\n\nRed is a more sophisticated and sometimes very funny variation on the Expendables theme: an older ensemble group in a shoot-em-up. Ironically, Mary-Louise Parker turns out to be the star. Bruce Willis is very good, too. Morgan Freeman, who I love of course, doesn’t seem all that comfortable in comedies. Helen Mirren appears lost as well. Still, this is an enjoyable stew.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nRed Sparrow\n\nNot nearly as good as the novel, which was one of the better thrillers in a while. Never really captures either of the two main characters. Violent at times. Never convincingly sexy. If you want to meet Dominica, you’ll have to read about her. B\n\nRendition\n\nIs a good thriller with good performances, but for me at least the subject matter is way too serious for a genre movie like this. Hollywood continues to make thrillers and suspense movies that are incredible downers, then wonders what happened at the box office. Plus, any movie called Rendition is fighting an uphill battle. What where they thinking?\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nResident Evil: Afterlife 3D\n\nI suspect this is for people who enjoy videogames and/or light science fiction. I’m not a particular fan of either, but I do think this film’s director has a terrific eye—i.e., it may all be nonsense, but it’s shot very well.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRide Along 2\n\nI enjoy Kevin Hart—but this is a really sloppy film. I think it’s the duty of actors and filmmakers to put out a better product when they know millions and millions of people are going to pay their hard-earned dollars to see it. C+\n\nOn DVD: Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRighteous Kill\n\nWho could resist Pacino & De Niro—not me. Loved them in Heat; liked them here. There are a lot of good dialogue snatches in the movie. Unfortunately, a lot of you will see the ending coming halfway through the film.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nThe Road\n\nI know from personal experience that a very weird thing happens when you send a book out to Hollywood. They look for screenwriters that will offer their “take” on your story. Very often this “take” has little to do with your book. At any rate, I find this procedure to be unbearably strange, especially since many of these screenwriters wouldn’t be capable of writing and publishing a novel, and have mostly created failed movies as well. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that the screenwriter for The Road offered his “take” on Cormac McCarthy’s stunningly good novel. The result certainly isn’t an embarrassment but it isn’t the book, either. Like the book however, it is rather dismal.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nRobin Hood\n\nPrepare yourselves, as this has literally nothing to do with the Robin Hood story you’ve heard since you were a kid. However, I kind of liked it. But I always liked the way Ridley Scott shoots films, and I’m a sucker for Russell Crowe.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRocketman\n\nI like this a lot – more than I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody – although I’m a little bigger Queen than Elton John music fan. The elite performance by Aaron Egerton was terrific and the film was really nicely directed. The small glitch for me was that the music and dance tended to gloss over how painful and difficult Elton John’s life seemed to have been. A-\n\nRocknRolla\n\nI like the director, Guy Ritchie, probably more than Madonna does these days. This isn’t his best work, though. Way too much voice over; too much art direction. (Reader, you can add the last line from my Zack & Miri review here).\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n\nI have to confess I’m not a huge Star Wars fan. It’s not that I don’t admire the art in the storytelling—I just have no interest in watching futuristic airplanes flying around and occasionally being blown up. I did find the storyline in this one a little more interesting than the last few. Please pardon me for not being the kind of fan so many of you are. B+\n\nOn DVD: Amazon | Barnes & Noble\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRoman de gare\n\nPick of the Week\n\nThe French way of doing thrillers is different than the American or British way—big surprise there. The director, Claude Lelouch, does a very nice job with the twists and turns. The cleverness is first rate, as is the acting. The excitement is not at the level of the best American films in this genre, however.\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nPosters: Amazon\n\nRush\n\nPick of the Week\n\nI loved Ron Howard’s early films, and what a treat to see him teamed with a very good camera man, who actually moves the camera. A good story here, even if you don’t give a hoot about race cars (I don’t).\n\nOn DVD: Amazon\n\nOn Demand: Amazon | iTunes\n\nPosters: Amazon"
