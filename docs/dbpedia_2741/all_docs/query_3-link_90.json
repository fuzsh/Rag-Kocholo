Mark Strong is a ubiquitous performer who has excelled in so many films, from Our Friends in the North to Sherlock Holmes, from Kingsmen to Anna Karenina and RocknRolla. He has been …\n\nContinue reading The brothers Grimsby: definitely mad for it.\n\nCumberbatch’s ‘Third Star’ left me startled\n\nI'd just been out with friends to The Star, my local pub, for a very lively evening and we came back home and chose a movie. What better than to settle down and watch 'Third Star'? We were all in the mood for a strong plot, with an actor who always delivers a fine performance, and the film has …\n\nContinue reading Cumberbatch’s ‘Third Star’ left me startled\n\nHow would you bet on the next James Bond?\n\nLike so many other people, I had always disliked James Bond films. I suppose the 007 movies have become a cultural reference point for British people: we know a bit about the actors, the villains, the traditional genre and the theme tunes. I didn't like the Connery Bond; even if we allow that it is of …\n\nContinue reading How would you bet on the next James Bond?\n\n‘The Program’ – blood bags, syringes and sleuth.\n\nI watched 'The Program', the biopic of Lance Armstrong's exploits, which deals with his fight against cancer and his decision to take performance enhancing drugs in order to become a Tour de France winner. The film relates the story of Armstrong, from his early days of being a competitive young rider, through his battle with cancer, …\n\nContinue reading ‘The Program’ – blood bags, syringes and sleuth.\n\nHigh rate for the H8ful Eight\n\nI need to review my habit of going to the cinema and buying tickets in Row A. I choose to sit at the front, partly because I am a bit myopic and partly because if I don't sit there, someone with a big head will come and sit directly in front of me. However, Row A and the pre-film …\n\nContinue reading High rate for the H8ful Eight\n\nThe Revenant: Man v Nature, Man v Man?\n\nI decided to test the hype for myself: I went to see 'The Revenant' at the cinema last night, sitting on the front row, right in front of the Big Screen. I wasn't put off by the preamble warning about blood and gore and detailed injuries: I knew this was a film about some guys enduring …\n\nContinue reading The Revenant: Man v Nature, Man v Man?\n\nSnow Cake – Alan Rickman’s best film?\n\nAs the plaudits and praise rightly pile up about the late and impressive actor, Alan Rickman, people will ponder his best films. Of course, the blockbusting and memorable films such as 'Die Hard', 'Harry Potter', 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' and 'Truly, Madly, Deeply' will be high on most people's ratings. But I have seen …\n\nContinue reading Snow Cake – Alan Rickman’s best film?\n\nCumberbatch and Hardy: the action to the word, the word to the action, with special observance\n\nStuart: A Life Backwards: a review We've all had the discussion: is the film better than the book? Is the book more meaningful than the film? In the case of Alexander Masters's book, 'Stuart: A Life Backwards,' the answer is, absolutely, that both are equally impressive. Alexander Masters's book is an account of his unlikely …\n\nContinue reading Cumberbatch and Hardy: the action to the word, the word to the action, with special observance"
