        "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. I fully expected this to be an all-out raunch-com in the vein of The Hangover, and I was absolutely mistaken. The film only slips into slapstick and physical punchyness at the lowest part of the actual dinner. The rest of the movie is pretty basic and set somewhere near real life.\n\nOften, real life situations bring the most humor. Sadly, that’s not the case here. Most of this one is just plain boring. There are some very talented people associated and they all do a fine job. It’s just that the pieces don’t make up an enticing whole. The film basically rides on the shoulders of the talented Steve Carell as Barry. Barry is a genuinely nice guy whose wife left him for his boss (Zach Galfianakis), and his hobby is making intricate displays of dressed up dead mice … his “mouseterpieces”, he calls them.\n\nPaul Rudd plays Tim, another genuinely nice guy trying very hard to make it in the business world. He has the right car and a great apartment and a beautiful girlfriend (Stephanie Szostack) who doesn’t think it’s time for them to be married. Tim seizes an opportunity at work to go for a promotion. This gets him invited to his boss’s monthly dinner party where all the managers bring a guest with extraordinary skills … the titular schmucks. The point is to have a good laugh at the expense of the idiots. Obviously Tim runs into Barry and the guest list is complete.\n\nTim explains to his girlfriend that there is a “me you don’t know” who has to do things in order to get ahead at work. I really wanted to see more of THAT guy! Instead, we are subjected to another film that just doesn’t know how to take advantage of Paul Rudd’s talent. He is a funny guy and you would never know it here.\n\nIf not for Steve Carell and an outlandish performance by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as an “artist”, this film would be totally flat. Instead, there are a few laughs and an underlying theme about the sweetness of some people. It tries to ask the question, who are the real schmucks? Director Jay Roach is responsible for the Austin Powers and the Meet the Parents franchises. He obviously knows humor. He takes this one from a French film directed by Francis Veber called The Dinner Game. In that film, we never actually get to the dinner. In this one, the film sinks to its lowest point during the dinner. Lesson learned. Best part? Hearing the Beatles during the opening and closing credits.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. Thanks to the July 29 one-night-only showing through Fathom Events, I got to see this on the big screen again for the first time since it’s initial release in 1972. In celebration of what would have been Elvis’ 75th birthday, an introduction was added that includes some clips and interviews … kind of a “making of” segment. I found it most interesting to get a behind the scenes look at how the film was put together, and the roles of Robert Abel, Pierre Adidge and Martin Scorcese.\n\nThe film itself won a Golden Globe for best documentary and it’s easy to see why. It provides a look at Elvis on the road … and a peek at what he was like as a man. In the new intro, Priscilla says “Elvis didn’t just sing a song”. She is so right. Sure, he had an amazing voice. And yes, he was an incredibly charismatic stage performer. Obviously, he was a handsome man and sex symbol of the times. But what the film reminds us is that he was a musician … a man who felt and loved the music. Watching him breathe in a song by The Stamps (including the great J.D. Sumner) is a moment to behold.\n\nFor anyone who doesn’t “get” Elvis or thinks he was just some old guy in a sequined jumpsuit, this is the film to watch. Upon its original release, Rolling Stone magazine’s headline read “Finally, the first Elvis movie”. The montage of his early years and crowd shots of his later years, show just what an impact he had on his fans. There was, and still is, a connection to those who were captivated by the man and his songs. He truly was a musical and social phenomenon.\n\nSeeing him carry the burden of being ELVIS is very interesting. While the songs and performances are fun to watch, the real value here is in the backstage portions. That’s where we see that he lived for the music. How else can you explain the voluminous recording library he left behind in less than 20 years. Despite the military service, pressures of fandom, and his personal issues, he continually recorded songs that we can enjoy today. Compare this to the Rolling Stones, whose careers have lasted more than twice as long as Elvis! While he was not at his physical peak on this tour, he was 37 years old and in decent condition. What is obvious is that the VOICE is still there when he wants it. The two best moments are when he records “Separate Ways” and then when he performs “Trilogy”. We hear the proof that the special gift never left him.\n\nIt’s difficult to watch this and realize that Elvis was dead 5 short years later. It really affects how you view his father, Vernon, who we see backstage and watching his son perform. It is also painful to see guys like Joe Esposito and Sonny and Red West kissing up to Elvis, now that we know they would go on to publish trash stories about him, once their golden goose was dead.\n\nThe film truly captures a part of history and a glimpse at a fascinating man. Elvis really was the first mega-superstar who became bigger than life.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. Can’t imagine there ever will be, but if there were to be a court trial against Pixar claiming unfair world animation domination, Despicable Me would surely be logged as Evidence A from the prosecution. It’s a well made, pleasant enough kids film that parents won’t dread sitting through. However, with the unfortunate luck of being released in the same year as Pixar’s masterpiece Toy Story 3, it’s just no match.\n\nI am happy to report that the kids in the theatre seemed to respond very well … especially to the Minions. If you have been to a movie in the past year, you have probably been exposed to the Minions – a group of cute, yellow tennis ball-looking creatures with either one or two eyes, a unique squeaking language and an infectious giggle/laugh. I found them to be the highlight of the movie as well.\n\nBasic story has Gru (Steve Carell voice) on a mission to be the world’s best villain. He has had some success, but has been a financial disaster. We learn this when he visits the Bank of Evil and they reject his loan for his newest project – stealing the moon! Gru is in competition with a new, younger, overblown evil mastermind named Vector (Jason Segel voice). Gru and his inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) are a step behind in technology, but manage to come up with a strategy.\n\nThe plan involves cookie-selling orphans who Gru adopts. The story is pretty simple in that he initially plans to use them to trap Vector, but of course, Gru is the one who has his heart stolen by the 3 girls. Yes, a bad guy is cast as the hero.\n\nIt’s mostly a cute presentation of a very simple story. Younger kids will get a kick out of it … and didn’t seem to be as annoyed at Steve Carell’s odd accent as I was. It comes across as a cross between Russian and German, but is easily enough understood.\n\nDon’t expect the brilliance of Pixar, but it will entertain the youngsters.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. Remember the Alamo! Remember the Cold War! OK, the Alamo has nothing to do with this, but if you can remember Russia as a superpower and the bad guy whom the U.S. spent years and billions trying to out-spy and out-defend, then this story might makes some sense to you. Of course, the story matters little here. What matters is the action and it is actually high octane and quite fun.\n\nAngelina Jolie has always reminded me of the scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid when Strother Martin is testing out Sundance’s shooting skills. When he misses the first target, Sundance asks “Can I move?”. He then proves he is much better when he moves. Angelina is the same. In her films that let her “move”, she is amazing. Think Mr. and Mrs. Smith vs. Changeling. The first she seems a natural, the second she came across as miscast. In this film, she does things no human being could do, but does these things with such commitment, that we actually believe she is capable. Her actions often border on parkour … especially when in an elevator shaft or bounding from truck to truck on a freeway. We accept these stunts because it’s Angelina.\n\nSupport work is provided by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, both who spend much of the movie trying to figure out how Angelina does the things she does … surrounded by their teams of weapons experts. Most of the time, the way she is outnumbered leaves you thinking that if she gets out of this jam, this movie is just stupid. But once she has escaped, you just feel a little more pumped up! That’s a sign of a fun action movie.\n\nSure, the story is ridiculous at most points and the plot holes are more canyons than holes, but it’s kind of nice to re-visit the double or triple spy days, especially when placed within daring stunts and chases that work.\n\nThe director of this is Phillip Noyce, who is best known for a couple of the Tom Clancy adaptations – Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. Mr. Noyce got me hooked 20 years ago on a little film called Dead Calm, starring a very young Nicole Kidman. That is a taut little thriller that takes place mostly on a sail boat in the middle of the ocean. If you’ve never seen it, you should.\n\nSo in regards to Salt, I will say that it’s a fun action-thriller in a twisty little cold war spy setting. Don’t get caught up in the plot details and just enjoy the action sequences by Angelina Jolie. Not very often I recommend ignoring a faulty script, but I actually enjoyed this one.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. Some movies are made as pure visual entertainment. Others are made as a vision of a story. The best combine elements of both. The great ones WOW you with what you see on screen, while keeping your mind focused on the multiple dimensions of a story that just won’t let you jump ahead. The previous sentence is my feeble attempt at describing what happens during Inception.\n\nWriter/director Christopher Nolan turns 40 at the end of this month. He now has 3 instant-classic films to his credit: Memento, The Dark Knight and now Inception. I am not a good enough writer to describe just how talented he his at making films. What I can tell you is that this movie gave me a “runner’s high” … it put me “in the zone”. As a viewer, I felt in perfect sync at each twist and turn.\n\nThere are two pieces of advice I will offer. First, go see the film at a theatre on the big screen. Don’t wait for NetFlix. Second, pay attention to every scene and every line. Trust Mr. Nolan to take you on this wild ride. You may be able to figure out the ending (if there even is one), but you will have missed the real point of the film … how did you get here?\n\nHere is a brief synopsis: Leonardo DiCaprio plays an expert thief. He is a thief who steals ideas by infiltrating the dreams of his targets and snatching their ideas. A very wealthy tycoon played by Ken Watanabe hires DiCaprio for a risky project of Inception – the inserting of an idea into the subject’s mind through dreams, rather than the stealing of an idea. DiCaprio’s team is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (with physical brilliance while lacking gravitational force), Tom Hardy (from Rocknrolla), master chemist Dileep Rao, and new recruit Ellen Page (“Juno” plays a brilliant architect prodigy with a genius of space and dimension). Cillian Murphy plays the target and Michael Caine is DiCaprio’s father in law … the link between who Leo is now and his previous life with his wife, played hauntingly well by Marion Cotillard.\n\nA perfect Nolan touch is Ellen Page’s character name – Ariadne. A quick google finds that Ariadne, in Greek mythology, fell in love with Theseus and helped him escape Minotaur’s labyrinth. The film is full of mazes and is itself a labyrinth punctuated by a stunning and powerful score by Hans Zimmer. You will find yourself bouncing from dream to reality, jumping into another’s dreams, layering dreams upon each other … oh, and watching a mind-bending special effect as the city of Paris is folded over on top of itself.\n\nClear your mind for 2 and a half hours and let a terrific filmmaker take you on a journey through mindspace that we never really pay attention to. The payoff is dream-like. This film was on my “films of interest” list on my First Half recap. If you missed the recap, here is the link: https://moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/2010-first-half-recap/\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. The film is based upon the work of crime novelist Jim Thompson, who is quite famous as a writer and whose works have often been translated to film. This time oft-creepy director Michael Winterbottom is in charge and comes pretty close to creating a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the bits that fall short, very nearly ruin the film.\n\nPsychological crime thrillers can be the most fascinating genre (see Inception), but only when the lead psycho is relatable in some sense and the story is complete. Here, Casey Affleck gives an outstanding performance as the dude you don’t want your daughter to date. There is a deep darkness hidden behind his aw-shucks facade of innocence and cutesy west Texas drawl.\n\nThe violence is expected, yet still shocking, when it first rears its head on poor Jessica Alba. We feel the first punch. What happens in this first encounter catches us off-guard and leaves us wanting to know more background on Affleck’s character. Instead, we are really only spectators in his plan of violence that seems to have no real goal. Think Natural Born Killers. Heck, even Ted Bundy had a real plan!\n\nThe creepiness factor is upped a bit since most everyone associated with the crimes seems to suspect Affleck’s character, but no one knows what to do or how to stop him. Kate Hudson, Elias Koteas and Simon Baker (miscast) give it a go. Personally I wanted more of the Koteas character as well as Ned Beatty, who plays a powerful developer against whom Affleck holds a grudge.\n\nBill Pullman is tossed in near the end to help wrap things up, but mostly the ending is as unsatisfying as the rest of the story. It is uncomfortable to watch Affleck’s character, so devoid of morals and empty of soul, but it feels wasted on a small town deputy sheriff with no vision. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing … but it makes for a much weaker film.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. Well, it’s the best kind of Nic Cage role … very little dialogue and plenty of scenes with him not included. Lots of special effects. Has some similarities to movies like National Treasure (another Jon Turtletaub directorial effort) and The Shadow. Can you tell I am struggling to find the positives?\n\nThe basic story involves Merlin’s three assistants (Balthazar, Horvath and Veronica) and their struggles after Merlin is killed by the evilest of all evil, Morganna (Alice Krige). Of course, that murder happened hundreds of years ago and poor Balthazar has been on a global search for the only sorcerer’s apprentice who can save the world in case Morganna is released.\n\nSince Veronica (Monica Bellucci) sacrificed herself to capture Morganna, it is really important to Balthazar (Cage) that he find this apprentice who can also help revive Veronica, who is his one true love. The bad guy is Horvath (played well by Alfred Molina). He is on a mission to release Morganna so she can destroy the world and choose him as her assistant. Yeah, I know, lots of details that don’t really matter.\n\nThe reluctant apprentice is played by Jay Baruchel. Or someone playing Jay Baruchel. Can’t really tell since every role he takes is EXACTLY the same character. At least here he plays a physics prodigy. Yeah, right.\n\nNext to Molina, the most fun is had when Toby Kebbell (RocknRolla) is on screen. He is a real hoot and these two play well off each other. The other attempt at humor is a weak homage to the Disney classic Fantasia, replete with moving mops, etc. No surprise, the sequence comes up well short of the original and Baruchel just doesn’t have the physical skills to pull it off.\n\nI assume this movie is aimed at 10 year olds and I am just not sure they will understand the story, though I feel confident the big special effects and cool car chase will be enough for a few oohs and ahhs. Those over 10 … enter at your own risk.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. Well, it’s July, so 2010 is half over. Of course, as any movie lover knows, the movie year is only about 40% complete and we always have high hopes for the final 6 months. Have received a couple of requests to do a recap of the first half, but before I do, I’ll provide a little insight into the structure of a typical movie year:\n\nJANUARY – APRIL: “Schlock and Seconds”\n\nThose of us not living in NYC or Los Angeles get to play “catch up” on the Oscar contenders that were released just ahead of the deadline the previous year. That’s the good news. The bad news is that we are also subjected to the latest round of low budget horror films, schlock action films, and weak rom-coms. Luckily, there are some interesting foreign, independent and documentaries films that hit during this time as well.\n\nMAY – JULY: “Big Ad Movies”\n\nIt’s summer blockbuster season … the season for huge advertising budgets, animation and the newest round of computer generated special effects … these films are designed to WOW you with sensory overload (yes, and make LOTS of money)\n\nAUGUST – mid OCTOBER: “The Lost 10 weeks”\n\nTypically, this is the dead season. Not much going on except for those films with production delays and/or deemed unable to compete with the summer crowd. This is a great time to catch up on any films you missed during the first half … or do something other than go to a movie, though I have no idea what.\n\nLate OCTOBER – DECEMBER: “My movie is Important. No really.”\n\nThe serious movie period. The producers of these films tend to believe their films and/or actors are worthy of Oscar consideration. These films are released at year-end because the producer’s believe that most people can’t remember what they had for breakfast, much less what movies they liked in April!\n\nOK, so that provides some perspective to the following recap of the first six months of 2010 films. Please note, none of the films or categories are in any type of order, and if a film deserved to be in two categories, I just picked one. This way I don’t ruin any surprises for the year-end recap.\n\nFIRST HALF RECAP – 2010 Films\n\nBEST SO FAR:\n\nWINTER’S BONE\n\nTOY STORY 3\n\nTHE SECRET IN THEIR EYES\n\nTHE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO\n\nBIGGEST SURPRISES:\n\nCYRUS\n\nPLEASE GIVE\n\nCITY ISLAND\n\nGREENBERG\n\nMOST DISAPPOINTING:\n\nJONAH HEX\n\nROBIN HOOD\n\nBABIES\n\nWORST SO FAR:\n\nPREDATORS\n\nKNIGHT AND DAY\n\nVALENTINE’S DAY\n\nHere are a few UPCOMING FILMS that are of interest:\n\nINCEPTION: Director Christopher Nolan’s mind-bending twister starring Leonardo Dicaprio\n\nWALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS (Wall Street sequel with Michael Douglas, Shia LeBeouf\n\nTHE EXPENDABLES (all star action cast led by Sylvester Stallone and friends)\n\nEAT PRAY LOVE – best-selling book, with Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem\n\nPARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 – sequel to the surprise hit of 2009\n\nMACHETE – for Grindhouse lovers only, by Robert Rodriquez\n\nTHE OTHER GUYS – Will Ferrell comedy (you just never know)\n\nJACK GOES BOATING – directorial debut of Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nTHE KILLER INSIDE ME – Winterbottom’s creepy murder-drama\n\nGET LOW – offbeat dramedy with Robert Duvall and Bill Murray\n\nBURIED – claustrophobic thriller with Ryan Reynolds and a casket\n\nThanks for reading and please pass it along to anyone you think might enjoy.\n\n*** SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES!! ***\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. This is the second of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy, though we have a new director for parts two and three. Daniel Alfredson takes a more mainstream approach to filming and story telling and, of course, he loses the element of surprise we enjoyed in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, one of my favorite films of the year so far.\n\nWith Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist back as Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkvist respectively, it certainly helps to have seen the first film to fill in the character development that this one assumes. We are treated to a more intricate, complex story line in this one, but the fun research part we enjoyed in part one, comes up a bit short.\n\nSwedish acting veteran/legend Per Oscarsson appears as Lisbeth’s first (and trusted) state assigned officer. He plays a small, but vital role and is quite interesting on screen – even at age 83! The story fills in some of the gaps on Lisbeth’s childhood and background but really leaves her a bit short on screen time despite being suspected of 3 murders.\n\nLisbeth’s look is somewhat softer in this one and we get full on views of her eyes, which rarely happened in part one. I believe the movie suffers a bit by making it easier to relate to her as a wronged woman. Still, the story is much better than the average thriller and the two lead characters are more interesting than most. I look forward to the final film of the trilogy … The Girl who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest.\n\nGreetings again from the darkness. If you are a fan of the 1987 original film directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard) and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, you couldn’t help but be a bit excited about this new one since Robert Rodriguez is involved. What a letdown. It plays more like an episode of Lost, or even The Twilight Zone.\n\nWith films from Mr. Rodriguez, we have always been able to count on creativity, ingenuity, humor and excitement. This one lacks all. Now to be fair, the director is actually Nimrod Antal, whose resume includes Armored and Vacancy, both of which are as empty as this one. But Mr. Rodriguez was very involved in the details.\n\nOf course when your cast is minus Arnold, you start with a major handicap. When you replace him with Adrien Brody, you appear to be aiming for disappointment. Sure Mr. Brody did a few sit-ups to prep for this role, but he is no action hero, regardless of how he mimics the Christian Bale Batman voice in order to seem tough.\n\nThe rest of the bad luck cast of characters is rounded out by Laurence Fishbourne, Alice Braga, the great Danny Trejo (a Rodriguez staple), Topher Grace and Walton Goggins (so great as Boyd Crowder in Justified, TV’s best new series this past season). Just to add to the misery, the film score is simplistic and a bit of a joke itself. It certainly misses the excellent work of Alan Silvestri from the first film.\n\nNot much need to discuss the lack of any real new material here. The bad guys are pretty much the same. The weapons are pretty much the same. The cast and script are weaker. The real money with this one lies in a “making of” documentary in which the first “pitch” meeting takes place and the producers are presented with the idea to make a thrilling new action movie … a new Predator movie … starring … Adrien Brody and Topher Grace!"
