The spirit of “l’dor v’dor”, from generation to generation, is felt throughout our community. From our grandparent and grandkid music class earlier this week led by Baby Jam to family traditions of attending Hanukkah parties or camp at the J.\n\nLongtime JCC member Linda Morgan recalls several occasions where generations of her family spent time at the J. She attended SJCC summer camp as a kid, and then her daughter and her granddaughters all followed in her footsteps. “There’s really nothing better,” she says.\n\nShe also remembers attending a fitness class with both her mother and her daughter. “There were three generations of us in an aerobics class – it had nothing to do with Judaism, but it’s what got us here. It’s why we were here. And I’m kind of proud to have a JCC that has done this so successfully for so many people for so many years.”\n\nAs the calendar turns to November and the holidays approach, the J has tons of activities and events to bring your family together. From School’s Out Camp to our family Hanukkah Concert + Celebration to a baseball flick for the whole family (just $5 for J members!), we hope you’ll continue to make the J part of your family’s tradition.\n\nHere are some of the highlights coming up.
