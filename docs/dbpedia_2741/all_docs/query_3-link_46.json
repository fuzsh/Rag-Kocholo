        "text": "Film Series\n\nEVERY MINUTE, FOUR IDEAS: THE FILMS OF ARNAUD DESPLECHIN (Friday through Thursday) The dense, noisy, omnivorous films of this 48-year-old French filmmaker retain a youthful vitality even as they circle increasingly ominous themes of mortality. All of Mr. Desplechin’s feature-length films are included in this retrospective  “Kings and Queen” (Friday, Sunday and Thursday); “My Sex Life” (Saturday and Sunday); “La Sentinelle” (Monday and Thursday); the hard-to-see “Playing ‘In the Company of Men’ ” (Tuesday); and the English-language “Esther Kahn” (Wednesday)  building up to his latest work, “A Christmas Tale,” which opens next Friday. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $12. (Dave Kehr)\n\nKINO 2008 (Friday through Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art’s 29th annual survey of recent German films includes “Cloud 9,” Andreas Dresen’s film about a woman in her mid-60s who finds herself drawn to an older man (Friday and Saturday); “The Wave,” Dennis Gansel’s drama about a misguided classroom experiment in authoritarian rule (Friday and Saturday); Thomas Grube’s documentary “Trip to Asia: The Quest for Harmony,” which follows the Berlin Philharmonic on a tour of six Asian countries (Sunday and Wednesday); Helma Sanders-Brahms biography of Clara Wieck Schumann, “Clara” (Wednesday); a collection of 12 short films, “Next Generation 2007-08” (Sunday and Thursday); and other works. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9480, moma.org; $10. (Kehr)\n\n‘ORPHANS OF THE STORM’ (Tuesday) D. W. Griffith’s 1921 story of the French Revolution, starring Lillian and Dorothy Gish, opens a Tuesday-night series of newly restored films from the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy. At 7 p.m., BAMcinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)\n\n‘THE WILD CHILD’ (Friday through Thursday) Long out of theatrical distribution, François Truffaut’s 1970 film returns for a one-week run in a new 35-millimeter print. Truffaut himself plays the central character, an 18th-century doctor who tries to civilize a so-called wolf boy, found living by himself in a forest. Widely interpreted at the time of its release as Truffaut’s conservative response to the radical ideologies then in fashion in post-1968 Paris, the film is a confident assertion of the Enlightenment values of reason and education. The magnificent black-and-white cinematography is by Nestor Almendros. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $11.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘APPALOOSA’ (R, 1:47) Ed Harris, who directed, stars with Viggo Mortensen, Renée Zellweger and Jeremy Irons in this sly, relaxed western, which is less concerned with gunfighting and law and order than with jealousy, friendship and the perils of frontier romance. It’s a somber shoot-em-up with the mischievous soul of a sex comedy. (A. O. Scott)\n\n‘BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA’ (PG, 1:25) As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” is reasonably diverting. As one released in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane. (Nathan Lee)\n\n‘BODY OF LIES’ (R, 2:06) Ridley Scott’s new movie raises a potentially disturbing question. If terrorism has become boring, does that mean that the terrorists have won? Or, conversely, is the grinding tedium of this film good news for our side, evidence of the awesome might of Western popular culture, which can turn even the most bloodthirsty real-world villains into fodder for contrived and lifeless action thrillers? (Scott)\n\n‘BURN AFTER READING’ (R, 1:36) A predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen with a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8. With George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n‘CHANGELING’ (R, 2:01) Clint Eastwood directs Angelina Jolie in this long, shapeless tale of a mother in distress, based on the true story of Christine Collins, whose young son disappeared in Los Angeles in 1928. There are some effective scenes, but the labored period details, the flagging pace and Ms. Jolie’s exhausting performance get in the way of any real intensity or insight. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘THE DARK KNIGHT’ (PG-13, 2:32) Pitched at the divide between poetry and entertainment, Christopher Nolan’s follow-up to “Batman Begins” goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind. With Christian Bale as the big bat and a spellbinding Heath Ledger as the smiler with the knives. (Dargis)\n\n‘DEAR ZACHARY: A LETTER TO A SON ABOUT HIS FATHER’ (No rating, 1:35) It is impossible not to be fired up by Kurt Kuenne’s incendiary cri de coeur, a personal documentary about the murder of his best friend and a polemical rant against the Canadian justice system for coddling a dangerous sociopath. (Stephen Holden)‘THE DUCHESS’ (PG-13, 1:45) An overstuffed, underbaked portrait of the cosseted, tightly corseted late-18th-century life of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire. Saul Dibbs directs, Keira Knightley stars, and Ralph Fiennes acts. (Dargis)‘EAGLE EYE’ (PG-13, 1:58) Shia LaBoeuf and Michelle Monaghan on the run from something. From what? A ticked-off government computer, apparently. Did I spoil it? Sorry. I mean, you’re welcome. (Scott)\n\n‘THE EXPRESS’ (PG, 2:09) Like “Glory Road,” “The Great Debate” and numerous similar movies, “The Express” packages a real-life story of athletic triumph and social progress into an accessible, rousing melodrama that is no less potent for being almost entirely predictable. (Scott)\n\n‘FEAR(S) OF THE DARK’ (No rating, 1:20, in French) Shot in luminous whites, pulsing blacks and gorgeous grays, this animated anthology showcases six of today’s most talented graphic artists. Exploring sexual insecurity, rural superstition and sociopolitical anxieties, the stories unfold with an inventiveness that’s seldom scary but never less than mesmerizing. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n\n‘FIREPROOF’ (PG, 2:02) In this film aimed at the Christian market, Kirk Cameron plays a firefighter who tries to save his marriage by embarking on a faith-based regimen called the Love Dare, but his wife (Erin Bethea) seems unresponsive. It’s a much better attempt to merge storytelling with faith than is usual for the genre, and the amateur cast is surprisingly good. (Neil Genzlinger)\n\n‘THE FIRST BASKET’ (No rating, 1:26) The little-known history of Jewish participation in, and influence on, the game of basketball is remembered in this functional, if narrowly interesting, history lesson. (Lee)\n\n‘FLY ME TO THE MOON’ (G, 1:30) Three flies stow away on Apollo 11 in this animated feature created start to finish expressly for 3-D. But not, alas, for pleasure or art. (Lee)\n\n★ ‘HAPPY-GO-LUCKY’ (R, 1:58) Happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and for the bopping bloom at the center of Mike Leigh’s generous, expansive new film  a gurgling stream of giggles, laughs and words played by a glorious Sally Hawkins  it’s also a question of faith. (Dargis)\n\n‘HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR’ (G, 1:40) The third chapter of this Disney musical franchise moves smoothly from the Disney Channel to the big screen. If the story is negligible, as long as the film is singing and dancing, it is irresistibly peppy froth set in wholesome teenage never-never land. (Holden)\n\n★ ‘I’VE LOVED YOU SO LONG’ (PG-13, 1:55, in French) The French novelist Philippe Claudel, making his debut as a director, shows sobriety and restraint in this story of a woman making her way back into normal life after serving a prison sentence for the murder of her son. Kristin Scott Thomas gives a remarkable lead performance, and Elsa Zylberstein as her sister is nearly as good. A climactic plot twist cheapens and diminishes the film somewhat, but it is still, for the most part, a powerful and subtle melodrama. (Scott)\n\n‘LAKEVIEW TERRACE’ (PG-13, 1:46) In this silly exercise in mock provocation, Samuel L. Jackson plays a Los Angeles police officer who terrorizes his new neighbors, a perfectly nice interracial couple played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘LET THE RIGHT ONE IN’ (No rating, 1:54, in Swedish) A charming and chilling Swedish love story directed by Tomas Alfredson about a lonely boy and the girl next door who may just happen to be a vampire. (Dargis)★ ‘MAN ON WIRE’ (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit’s 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh’s beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘THE MATADOR’ (No rating, 1:14) Thrust forward by John Califra’s uncommonly stirring score, this story of David Fandila’s quest to reach 100 fights in a single season unspools with more drama than most blockbusters. Blessed with a charismatic leading man and a narrative steeped in blood and hand-to-hoof combat, the film is a Hemingway fantasy. Only the furrowed anxiety of Mr. Fandila’s mother reminds us that beneath the pageantry and, yes, artistry lies a performance that many view as little more than ritualized slaughter. (Catsoulis)\n\n‘MAX PAYNE’ (PG-13, 1:40) In this video-game-based action-revenge spectacle, Mark Wahlberg battles winged creatures, drug addicts and a ruthless pharmaceutical company. Or something. (Scott)\n\n‘MY NAME IS BRUCE’ (R, 1:26) In this silly horror comedy only a cultist could love, Bruce Campbell, the star of countless B-movie thrillers, mercilessly, and for the most part witlessly, spoofs himself. (Holden)‘NICK & NORAH’S INFINITE PLAYLIST’ (PG-13, 1:30) Teenagers falling in love on the tame night streets of Manhattan. As thin as an iPod Nano and as sweetly self-conscious as a Facebook page, but not without charm. (Scott)\n\n‘NIGHTS IN RODANTHE’ (PG-13, 1:37) Richard Gere and Diane Lane fumble like teenagers and mouth some pitiful, platitudinous, risible dialogue in a soggy romance directed by George C. Wolfe and based on a Nicholas Sparks book. (Dargis)\n\n‘PRIDE AND GLORY’ (R, 2:05) An extended family of Irish cops fighting, shouting and weeping in New York. Nothing you haven’t seen before, but not badly directed by Gavin O’Connor, and featuring a fine, quiet performance by Noah Emmerich, who steals the picture from the designated blusterers Colin Farrell and Edward Norton. (Scott)\n\n‘QUARANTINE’ (R, 1:26) The recent resurgence of the pseudo-documentary horror movie continues with this tale of a television news team trapped in an urban apartment building whose residents are harboring a mysterious infection. Cleverly working his claustrophobic setting (and the adapted script from the Spanish movie “[REC]”), the director, John Erick Dowdle, keeps the action tight and the injuries nasty. (Catsoulis)\n\n★ ‘RACHEL GETTING MARRIED’ (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel’s wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you’ll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)\n\n‘RELIGULOUS’ (R, 1:41) The comedian and outspoken religious nonbeliever Bill Maher travels the world interviewing Christians, Jews and Muslims about their beliefs, which he views as dangerous nonsense. (Holden)\n\n‘ROCKNROLLA’ (R, 1:57) In his latest, the director Guy Ritchie pumps up the volume, tilts the camera, flexes the muscle, struts the stuff for some bang bang, blah blah. (Dargis)\n\n‘SAW V’ (R, 1:39) It would be nice to be able to say that the latest installment of the “Saw” franchise is a revolting, nerve-racking trip into the cesspool of the human imagination, since that seems to be the general point of this undying franchise. This time around, however, the result is just plain boring, and even a little tame  albeit by the standards of a genre that helped bring the phrase “torture porn” into existence. (Lee)\n\n★ ‘A SECRET’ (No rating, 1:45, in French) Claude Miller’s adaptation of Philippe Grimbert’s autobiographical novel is a subtle and moving exploration of intimacy and desire in a French Jewish family before and after World War II.
