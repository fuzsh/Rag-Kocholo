BERLIN — Pathe has come on board Guillaume Canet’s “Rock n’ Roll,” a comedy starring Marion Cotillard and famed French singer Johnny Hallyday.

The film, which is currently shooting in and around Paris, is being produced by Alain Attal’s Les Productions du Tresor, the company behind all of Canet’s movies.

“Rock n’ Roll” marks the first collaboration between Pathe and Canet as a director. Pathe is co-producing, handling international sales and will distribute in France. The movie also signals Canet’s return to France after making his English-language debut with “Blood Ties.”

Attal said Canet has requested that the plot of the film remain under wraps. The script of “Rock n’ Roll” is co-written by Philippe Lefebvre, who previously co-penned Canet’s debut “Mon Idole,” a dark comedy, and “Tell No One,” a tense thriller based on Harlan Coben’s novel — both of which were critically acclaimed and commercially successful. Rodolphe Lauga also co-wrote the script.

“Rock n’ Roll” reteams Canet with wife Cotillard, who starred in French ensemble dramedy “Little White Lies” (the highest-grossing French film of 2010 with $44.4 million) and “Blood Ties,” a New-York set drama with Clive Owen and Billy Crudup.

Considered an iconic French singer, Hallyday has been starring in select films over the years such as Johnnie To’s “Vengeance” and Claude Lelouch’s “Salaud, on t’aime.”

Cotillard will next be shooting Robert Zemeckis’ untitled pic with Brad Pitt.
