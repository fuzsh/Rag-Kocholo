        "text": "Tacitus’ account of the treason trial of the historian Cremutius Cordus under Tiberius has long been recognised as a statement about the freedom of speech of a historian under a repressive regime. This paper offers a full interpretation of the passage, Annals .–, seen as part of the tightly woven texture of the beginning of the work. Its main problem is the perceived implausibility of Cremutius’ claim that his praise of Brutus and Cassius ought not to have provoked the emperor’s anger. It is here argued that this can be solved by a new interpretation of the preceding digression on historiography under the empire, a passage often assumed to expose the disingenuousness of Cremutius’/Tacitus’ claim; the concept of figured speech, often invoked, is shown to be irrelevant to the issue. Moreover, as it memorialises Tiberius’ guilt as well as Cremutius’ courageous frankness, the passage is a demonstration of the power of history, in accordance with the programmatic statement in ...\n\nThe emperor Augustus, though not a historian as such, had a profound understanding of how to construct political events into a form a historical narrative through both architectural and epigraphic monuments. In this one way, at least, Augustus shares a resemblance with Tacitus, who took no less care in fashioning his account of the Julio-Claudians than Augustus did in designing for posterity a narrative of his reign. Although Augustus was immediately addressing a contemporary, and often local, audience with his message and Tacitus was reflecting upon past events, both of them were seeking to create an enduring message. This paper investigates particularly how Tacitus responds to the narrative that Augustus constructed through his Mausoleum and its accompanying Res Gestae.\n\nMany scholars have studied how Tiberius relied upon, or was compelled to relate to, the image of his deified adoptive father Augustus (1). But in many ways Tiberius was just as dependent upon the image of his adopted son Germanicus. We have been conditioned by reading Tacitus and other ancient historians to envision Tiberius as considering the death of Germanicus to be one of the happier moments of his reign (see esp. Ann. 4, 1, 1) (2). The documents published after the death of Germanicus present a different view. We can see in the Tabula Hebana, Tabula Siarensis, and Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone how the relationship between Tiberius and these two men was presented to the subjects of the empire, subjects who were devoted to the memory of Augustus and the family of Germanicus. This paper examines the subtle way in which these documents focus not so much on Tiberius as princeps (the present), but as the link between the reign of Augustus (the past) and the dynasty which would continue through the line of Germanicus (the future) (3).\n\nThis volume approaches three key concepts in Roman history — gender, memory and identity — and demonstrates the significance of their interaction in all social levels and during all periods of Imperial Rome. When societies, as well as individuals, form their identities, remembrance and references to the past play a significant role. The aim of Gender, Memory, and Identity in the Roman World is to cast light on the constructing and the maintaining of both public and private identities in the Roman Empire through memory, and to highlight, in particular, the role of gender in that process. While approaching this subject, the contributors to this volume scrutinise both the literature and material sources, pointing out how widespread the close relationship between gender, memory and identity was. A major aim of Gender, Memory, and Identity in the Roman World as a whole is to point out the significance of the interaction between these three concepts in both the upper and lower levels of R..."
