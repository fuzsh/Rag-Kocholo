She was the wife of Germanicus Caesar and accompanied him on his provincial duties. After her husband's death (a.d. 19), she accused Tiberius of having Germanicus poisoned, and thereafter she was consistently on bad terms with the emperor. Exiled to Pandataria (Ventotene) Island in the Bay of Naples, she starved herself to death. Her son Caius Caesar Germanicus became the emperor Caligula.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2024, Columbia University Press.
