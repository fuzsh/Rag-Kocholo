        "text": "This chapter is centred on my work as Latin Editor of Mary Hays’s Female Biography, and will explore how a felicitous combination of interdisciplinary approaches to historical research enabled the ventriloquized ‘voices’ of 30 ancient Roman women (from Agrippina the Elder to Veturia). This task has involved a detailed critical annotation in relation to the ancient testimony and a repertoire of seventeenth-and eighteenth-century references (inter alia, Bayle’s Historical and Critical Dictionary, the Biographium Femineum, LaCroix’s Les Femmes Célébrées); professional historical dialogue with a variegated scholarship across a range of academic institutions (American, Australasian and European); and informed theoretical perspectives from a spectrum of academic elds (gendered history, historical philology, feminist philosophy, post-structural literary critique). This work not only conrms my belief that it is the ongoing responsibility and duty of the historical researcher to pursue, capture, discover, create and transmit how knowledge and understanding of the ancient world is developed, managed and used; it also foregrounds the necessity for students of human history (ancient and modern) to always be open to different perspectives, methodologies and ways of thinking in order to advance our understanding of the nature of who and what we study.\n\nThis article argues that Tacitus’ presentation of the tense relationship between Tiberius and Agrippina the Elder is predicated upon differing interpretations of Augustus’ memory. While Agrippina presents herself as the living imago Augusti and the populace praises her blood connection to the first princeps, Tiberius denies that her ancestry should grant her authority. This argument allows insight into the mnemonic function of women in the Annals and Tacitus’ presentation of the efficacy of the memory and images of imperial family members in general.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this article to attempt a survey of the history of Rome’s involvement with the island of Britain during the early years of provincial expansion and rebellion. Nor is it my intention to rehearse in detail the background and significant events associated with the 1st century CE female rulers of the Iceni and Brigantes, Boudica and Cartimandua; or, more briefly, with the Julio-Claudian women of power and influence, Valeria Messalina and Julia Agrippina. Rather, I want to examine the literary sources that form the substance of the historical record as it relates to the years leading up to the rebellion of Boudica (43-60/61 CE ). I hope to show how these sources intersect with the representations of contemporary females of historical significance and to indicate some of the problems and difficulties encountered in their use. This will entail some comment on the representations in the same sources of the principes Claudius and Nero and their British contemporaries."
