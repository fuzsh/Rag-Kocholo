        "text": "2. Caius Julius Caesar IV. (\"The Julius Caesar\"), one of the Nine Worthies, the greatest general Rome ever produced, born July 12, 100 B.C., in Subura, allegedly by the delivery operation that bears his name.\n\nAccording to Durant,\n\n\"He traced his pedigree to Julus Ascanius, son of Aeneas, son of Venus, daughter of Jupiter: he began and ended as a god. The Julian gens, though impoverished, was one of the oldest and noblest in Italy. A Caius Julius had been consul in 489 B.C., another in 482 B.C., a Vopiscus Julius in 473 B.C., a Sextus Julius in 157 B.C., another in 90 B.C.\"\n\nHe with Pompey and Crassus formed the first triumvirate. He produced many works, of which his commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars alone have been preserved. Pliny records that Caesar \"could employ, at one and the same time, his ears to listen, his eyes to read, his hand to write, and his tongue to dictate.\" He is often called the greatest statesman in the world's history. On the Ides of March (March 15th) 44 B.C., Caesar was murdered at the age of 56. He married in Rome in 84 B.C. (1) Cossutia to please his father; when soon after his father died, he divorced her and married (2) Cornelia, daughter of Cinna; their daughter, Julia, married Pompey. Caesar left no grandchildren surviving. When Cornelia died in 68 B.C., Caesar married (3) Pompeia, granddaughter of Sulla. He finally married (4) Calpurnia, daughter of L. Piso. In his later years Julius Caesar had affairs with many women, often the wives of both friends and enemies.\n\nAccording to Durant,\n\n\"We must think of Caesar as at first an unscrupulous politician and a reckless rake, slowly transformed by growth and responsibility into one of history's most profound and conscientious statesmen. We must not forget, as we rejoice at his faults, that he was a great man notwithstanding. We cannot equate ourselves with Caesar by proving that he seduced women, bribed ward leaders, and wrote books.\""
