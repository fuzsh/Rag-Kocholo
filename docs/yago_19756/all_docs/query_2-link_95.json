        "text": "What if Nero Claudius Drusus, brother to the (OTL) future emperor Tiberius, doesn't fall off his horse while campaigning in Germania and subsequently die in 9 BCE?\n\nOn that note, I wonder what Nero Claudius succeeding with Tiberius as a co-emperor would have done.\n\nDo you mean Drusus the Elder (Tiberius' brother)? Thing is, I put him on the list mainly because Agrippa's sons were young when their dad died, and had to think who else would Augustus turn to if, for example, he died early and his grandsons needed a \"regent\"? Tiberius himself was probably the top choice for much of their minority, but for a few years there (12-9 BC) I'd say his younger brother's star was shining brighter, so realistically he had to be considered.\n\nObviously, if Drusus the Elder lives longer, we have to think again about how that butterflies the fates of Agrippa's sons; also remember, Tiberius was still married to Julia following her second husbands death, and is the older brother on top of that, so it's a bit more complicated than just having Drusus live longer and then get imperial power in a few years.\n\nMy thought was more that if Drusus lived longer, but the two sons of Agrippa still died, then Augustus would leave both Tiberius and Nero Claudius both in power. Rather than Tiberius alone.\n\nWell, Julia's banishment for adultery came seven years after the death of her brother-in-law;* the death of her two elder sons came within the next five years after that; and then, on top of that, Postumus still had to get banished a couple of years after that. Not only would we have to imagine how Drusus' career develops in all this time, and how it continues to compare to his elder brother, but we need to think of why Augustus would decide Tiberius needs a co-ruler to begin with.\n\nIf we're being honest, Drusus the Elder is more of an x-factor than a \"could-have-been-emperor\" in his own right; like I said earlier, it's a bit more complicated than \"Drusus lives longer, time passes, then princep\".\n\n*EDIT ADD: Actually, now that I think of it, wouldn't his brother being alive mean that Tiberius is quite possibly in a different place, mentally, than he was OTL? That could have implications for how his marital issues play out.\n\nRemember also who Tiberius choose to go in self-exile in Rhodes in 6 BC aka three years after Drusus’ death… I can not see this choice changing with Drusus still alive as was dictated by Tiberius unhappiness with his personal life but Drusus‘ survival could very well mean who Tiberius who remain on Rhodes for the remaining of his life (or at least until Augustus‘s death) while Drusus would be put forward as regent first and heir later without any need to call back Tiberius\n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure Tiberius goes into self-imposed exile TTL; if Drusus doesn't die in 9 BC, then it stands to reason he remains Governor of Germania Inferior (and in charge of those legions), meaning Tiberius doesn't step in from summer 9 BC through 8 BC. Assuming the elder brother still serves again as Consul, as he did OTL in 7 BC (and I don't see why he wouldn't), he'd probably be looking to follow it up with a solid governorship somewhere (maybe following up his brother in Germania, maybe going to Syria, etc) -- in part because since his brother's alive, he doesn't have as much pain (for which he can fail to bury in work), and partly because he didn't have to step into his brother's shoes in Germania (so he hasn't tried burying what pain he does have with that kind of work yet). That actually keeps him busy up to circa 2 BC easily enough.\n\nDrusus, for his part, can't stay in Germania forever -- he'll probably leave at the start of (his brother's consulship year of) 7 BC, or possibly 6 BC, or 5 BC at the very latest -- and technically speaking he can't be consul again until 3 BC (since he's already been consul in 9 BC). So he actually needs something to do around this time -- maybe Tiberius could step into Germnia following his second consulship. and Drusus can step into being governor somewhere else (maybe Syria)? It's worth noting that around this time, these two brothers, along with Ahenobarbus (Antonia Major's husband) and Varus (yes, that Varus), are probably the only people Augustus is going to be putting in charge of important provinces with multiple legions to command.\n\nBy the time we get to the point where OTL, Tiberius' marital issues were throwing the imperial family into scandal, we've got a context TTL that is potentially very different.\n\nAs an additional note to the above -- Gaius, eldest grandson of Augustus, would be given a military command at the very young age of 18 (circa 2-1 BC), so the seven or so years following our PoD are pretty important to note there as well. If Tiberius doesn't withdraw from public life during this time (starting in 6 BC), then I imagine he'd be spending a few more years trying to train Ceasar's heir (as he briefly tried to do OTL on campaign in 8 BC). That would also add to the noted differing context.\n\nAnd with the changes over the next few years (9 to 3 BC) established -- how would the years thereafter (2 BC to 4 CE, to 6 or 7 CE), which OTL saw the fall of Julia and her three sons, be changed? At the very least, even if Gaius and Lucius both still die around this time,* Tiberius wouldn't need to be recalled from exile; honestly, I imagine he'd still be high on Augustus' list of potential heirs.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n*Also worth noting -- even if Gaius only lives a couple more years or so, that may be enough for Livilla to become pregnant by him, potentially throwing another great-grandchild of Augustus into the mix.\n\nCONSOLIDATION: There's something else more to keep in mind here -- that in the scandal that destroyed Julia the Elder in 2 BC, it extended beyond Julia simply committed adultery, but involved a faction of powerful aristocrats centered around one Iullus Antonius, son of Mark Antony and Fulvia, which may also have involved a plot on Augustus' life. Honestly, if Tiberius doesn't completely drop out of her life, even if their marriage is still troubled, I don't see Julia getting this deep into a political conspiracy opposed to her father. And if Julia doesn't get exiled, that has implications for her children in the next few years, specifically the early careers of Gaius and Lucius, the marriage of Agrippina, and the fate of Postumus.\n\nOh, and one more crazy detail -- maybe not even worth noting, but I'm going to note it anyway, just because it's so fun/baffling to think about:\n\nYou know how Drusus' eldest son is known to history as \"Germanicus\"? Well, that's because the was the name awarded to his father upon his death, which said eldest son subsequently inherited. Said son's personal name at birth is unknown, but it was either \"Nero Claudius Drusus\" or \"Tiberius Claudius Nero\"; in any event, we do know that the second son, who history came to know as the Emperor Claudius, was born \"Tiberius Claudius Drusus\". I take the time to note all this, because obviously if he doesn't die in 9 BC, Drusus (a) may very well still get the name \"Germanicus\", but live long enough after getting the name that he gets it to stick, and (b) won't have his sons become more known for the moniker than he is.\n\nMeaning -- and I apologize in advance for this -- that the man OTL history knows as \"Drusus\" would TTL be known as \"Germanicus\"; the man OTL knows as \"Germanicus\" would TTL likely be known as \"Nero\"; and the man OTL knows as \"Claudius\" could be known as either \"Tiberius\" or \"Drusus\", depending on what his brother's name was.\n\nRoman naming conventions -- gotta love em.\n\nThinking about this again -- specifically about the few years following the PoD (9 BC to 3 BC) -- I think it’s pretty likely that Drusus ends his command in Germany at the start of 7 or 6 BC, and that Augustus would then offer him command of the eastern provinces (as he offered Tiberius 6 BC in OTL). I expect this is when Tiberius would be offered command of Germany; even if you think he still has personal reasons to want to go into exile, I would think a command like this would give him exactly the kind of distance from Julia he’s looking for (since, if they’re falling out, she’s less likely to follow him to a German camp than to a city in the east). So by the time Gaius is of age to actually do anything, that’s what I expect the two sons of Livia have been up to.\n\nNow, if I'm right about that much, is there anything we can reasonable speculate about how Gaius and Lucius fare in this period, or about events in the next decade (2 BC to 8 CE)? I think there is; specifically, if nothing else, Augustus appointing a \"master of the east\" naturally means that person would be on the scene to handle the matter of Herod the Great's estate, as well as any issues that come from the Parthian Empire. (The latter means the disputes that arose around the ascension of Phraates V and were resolved by a treaty in 1 CE are unlikely to end up with Gaius being sent to the border.) In the more general sense -- and this much is my guess -- but I would think that if Augustus has a family member feels he can trust in Drusus, he may not feel it so necessary to elevate the careers of his grandsons so incredibly quickly (e.g. electing Gaius to the Consulship at the age of 19, etc).\n\nActually, it seems we've hit upon a very interesting question that seemingly hasn't come up on the board before -- namely, what if the Roman Empire had handled the succession question over the Herodian Kingdom differently (after 4 BC)? For example, is it possible they could have decided to ignore Herod's last minute changes to his will, and go with the original plan to give it all to Antipas; or if they do decide to still split it, they keep it mostly together, only splitting off those territories east of the Jordan River (Batanea, Perea)? Aside from the one guy I'm sure we're thinking of, how is the history of the region different if Rome doesn't shortly after this PoD turn Judea into a directly governed territory?\n\nThinking about this again -- specifically about the few years following the PoD (9 BC to 3 BC) -- I think it’s pretty likely that Drusus ends his command in Germany at the start of 7 or 6 BC, and that Augustus would then offer him command of the eastern provinces (as he offered Tiberius 6 BC in OTL). I expect this is when Tiberius would be offered command of Germany; even if you think he still has personal reasons to want to go into exile, I would think a command like this would give him exactly the kind of distance from Julia he’s looking for (since, if they’re falling out, she’s less likely to follow him to a German camp than to a city in the east).

Aside from the one guy I'm sure we're thinking of, how is the history of the region different if Rome doesn't shortly after this PoD turn Judea into a directly governed territory?\n\nIf things continue in the vein you have stated for Rome, I think it's far more likely that Augustus would adopts Drusus-AKA Germanicus Senior-to follow him should he die before his Grandsons are old enough to succeed him. He was apparently far more personable and certainly less dour than Tiberius. If Drusus inherits the Principate upon the death of Augustus, would the German Legion Revolts that happened OTL upon Augustus' death still happen?\n\nFirstly, Germanicus Junior, Agrippina, and their kids, including Caligula, would be in the Eat, not Germany. And, perhaps more importantly, the revolting legionaries would be dealing with Tiberius, not Germanicus Junior.\n\nThis skews literally everything from OTL. Germanicus, Agrippina, and all their kids have a very good chance of surviving to adulthood. And Tiberius' reaction to the legions revolting would be vastly different from what occurred OTL...\n\nSo here's what I'm thinking:\n\n7 BC -- Tiberius serves as Consul, Drusus serves his last years as Commander of the German Legions\n\n6 BC -- Tiberius assumes command of the German Legions, Drusus is named Master of the East\n\n5 BC -- Gaius Caesar (15) begins his military service, serving under Tiberius\n\n4 BC -- Herod the Great dies, Drusus oversees the succession of his kingdom (Antipas gets most of it); Tiberius leads an expedition across the Rhine\n\n2 BC -- Lucius Caesar begins military service\n\n1 BC -- Gaius marries Livilla; Tiberius (with Julia) returns to Rome from Germany; Drusus makes a treaty with Phraates V (three years sooner than OTL)\n\n1 CE -- Drusus returns to Rome from the east; Tiberius serves a third year as Consul\n\n2 CE -- Lucius Caesar dies; Drusus serves a second year as Consul\n\n3 and 4 CE -- Scandal; Tiberius and Julia the Elder were long rumored to be \"separated\"; Tiberius withdraws from public life, as the lack of military command gives him no distraction from his unhappy marriage; subsequently, Julia is exposed for adultery; she is exiled, and Tiberius is on the out of favor with Augustus\n\nWhen we get to 5 and 6 CE, we get several important events -- Agrippina marries the elder son of Drusus, while Aemilia Lepida marries his younger son; meanwhile, Tiberius' son Drusus likely marries, but not into the core Dynasty. For the latter, I'm thinking a daughter of Ahenobarbus, thus creating a familial alliance between the three most accomplished generals in the empire (other than Drusus). It's also around this time that Gaius Caesar dies TTL -- a couple of years later than OTL, but those extra months have a substantial effect, as Livilla is now pregnant with Augustus' great-grandchild. Postumus also likely falls from grace around this time as well. There's also a fire and a food shortage in Rome.\n\nOh -- and also the Illyrian Revolt. And Arminius returns to Germania. The Empire is about to have a period of what could be considered a degree of crisis. Assuming Julia the Younger also falls from grace roughly as OTL, that means the lineage of Augustus now only has Agrippina (married to Drusus' elder son), his infant great-grandchild (born of Drusus' daughter), and technically Aemilia Lepida (married to Drusus' younger son), in the line of succession.\n\nSo now, I'd like to ask a couple of questions about what happens next -- first, supposing, as he commanded legions during this period of crisis, Drusus were to die? Not only how this would affect the succession, but also who does Augustus appoint to deal with to command the legions to deal with the problems in Illyria, Germania, etc -- or would it plainly be Tiberius? And does the latter complicate the former?\n\nAnd that brings me to my next question -- what happens to the Principate when Augustus dies? I don't just mean who \"inherits\", but does the institution he built around himself to rebuild Rome following the civil wars long survive him? Or does the idea of a \"first citizen\" undergo further evolution, different from OTL? How might \"Post-Augustus\" Roman government compare TTL to OTL, given the changes in how we got here?\n\nThanks."
