        "meta_description": "The JPXI features a combination of top appointments from the BFR and JPX Petrucci signature instruments. Premium tonewoods with non-chambered body provide a more focused sound while the sculpted lower horn allows more access to higher frets.  Most notably, the JPXI neck has been streamlined to a symmetric, extra slim profile featuring a flatter 20\" radius with medium jumbo stainless steel frets.  As with the JPX and JP BFR this guitar is equipped with Dimarzio Crunchlab and Liquifire pickups, Piezo bridge, and Music Man synchronized floating tremolo.",
