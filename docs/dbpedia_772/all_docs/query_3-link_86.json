        "meta_description": "Field measurements of riverbed grain size were collected from the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers in California to support research on anadromous salmonids. The grain size estimates included in this dataset were obtained from plan-view digital images of grains on exposed gravel and cobble bars (n = 109 for the Merced, n = 26 for the Tuolumne). The images were used to estimate grain-size distributions using the algorithm of Buscombe (2013). In this dataset we report the median grain size (D50), the 16th percentile (D16) and 84th percentile (D84). The spatial location of each measurement was obtained via a Trimble R10 RTK GPS receiver. The map projection and datum for these data from the Merced River are UTM Zone 11 N and WGS84, respectively. For the Tuolumne River data set, the map projection and datum UTM Zone 10 N and WGS 84, respectively.  The data are provided in shapefile format, with the attribute table for each point populated with six columns: PtNum, Easting, Northing, D16, D50, D84. The units of the spatial coordinates are meters, while the units of the grain size measurements are mm. This ground based grain size dataset was used to fit a stress partitioning term (Pfeiffer and Finnegan 2016) for a predictive D50 model. This model was used to estimate D50 at each cross sections spaced evenly every 15 m throughout in the study area.",
