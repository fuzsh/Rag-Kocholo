Then, with his years running out, John Richardson Sr. began to fill in the blanks. After his father's death in 1998, the younger Richardson sought out de-classified documents and convinced some of his dad's old colleagues to talk, too.\n\nHe tells Jennifer Ludden how he pieced together a secret life for a book called My Father, the Spy."
