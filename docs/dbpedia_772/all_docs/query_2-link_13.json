        "text": "In this article I examine music’s technological mediations, linking this to recent attempts to theorise the shifting nature of contemporary popular music. The basic argument is that we can learn a lot about where we are in the history of popular music by looking at conditions of cultural production, not merely at single styles, techniques or devices such as the sampler. I want to suggest that an examination of recent production techniques and technologies labelled ‘digital’ can tell us significant things about contemporary musical cultures, including how they are meeting broader tendencies towards flexibility and de-materialisation in social practices at large, but that this meeting takes place in an extended moment of cultural acceleration and intensity – a hypermodern moment. This moves music onto terrains that threaten, stretch and play with boundaries between human and machine, as well as real and simulated, although not always in expected ways. Keywords: cultural production, digital culture, mediations, hypermodern, popular music, software\n\nInsects have been used for a diversity of effects in rock music but primarily for their appealing qualities and for shock value. Lepidoptera probably are well represented because of the beauty of butterflies and moths and Diptera for the negative hygienic associations of flies, maggots and mosquitoes. Hymenopterans are the insects most commonly cited, probably because they have both charming qualities and painful associations, such as stinging. Not surprisingly, these applications are similar to those found among films and cartoons. Popular music, however, has more participants (artists) and titles (albums and tracks) than the other media, perhaps allowing a broader range of expression of attitudes toward insects. Overall, insects in music have been used to great effect in eliciting humor, especially the dark and twisted kind, and occasionally to address deeper issues. Little biological information is provided by insect music, the most common exceptions being metamorphosis and curious methods of insect control. As Hogue (1987) cites only eight insect songs from traditional or classical music, the results of this study suggest that rock music has utilized insects to a much greater extent, although the percentage of the total is small. As previously obscure genres, which tend to use insects more, become more popular (witness the rise of Rap music), it is possible that even more insect songs will be heard on the airwaves.\n\nThis book explores the development of a range of cults of popular music as a response to changes in attitudes to meaning, spirituality and religion in society. At a time when fundamentalism is on the rise, traditional religions are in decline and postmodernity has challenged any system that claims to be all-defining, young people have left their traditional places of worship and set up their own, in clubs, at festivals and within music culture. \"Pop Cults\" investigates the ways in which popular music and its surrounding culture have become a primary site for the location of meaning, belief and identity. It provides an introduction to the history of the interactions of vernacular music and religion, and the role of music in religious culture. Rupert Till explores the cults of heavy metal, pop stars, club culture and virtual popular music worlds, investigating the sex, drug, local and death cults of the sacred popular, and their relationships with traditional religions. He concludes by discussing how and why popular music cultures have taken on many of the roles of traditional religions in contemporary society."
