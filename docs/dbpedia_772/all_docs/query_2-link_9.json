He has performed on every tour since 2003 and his first recording with them, âTwo Against Natureâ won the Grammy award for âAlbum Of The Yearâ in 2001.

He was also voted the winner in the Jazz category in 2010, and the Pop category in 2008.\n\nLina Anderberg\n\nLina Anderbergâs story is one of unexpected turns and steadfast determination. Born in a small town in Sweden, Lina had no musical background and discovered her passion for the drums almost by accident. This fortuitous encounter led her to dedicate her life to music, a decision that has shaped her entire career. After honing her skills at one of Swedenâs top music schools, graduating in 2016, Lina quickly made a name for herself in the music industry. She has worked with a variety of artists, playing for thousands of people and performing on live TV, where she reached millions of viewers.\n\nEmmanuel MD Abiola\n\nEmmanuel âMDâ Abiola-Jacobs & Special Guests.. Being raised in the Church, Emmanuelâs musical background begins at age 5 playing Drums and percussion with his family. It was at Church that he discovered his interest in music, but it wasnât until till much later that he began to pursue his love and passion for it. Since then, Emmanuel has had the opportunity to play for countless Gospel Artists and has gone on to play for Award winning Artists within the mainstream music industry, touring the world and playing at some of the biggest venues and festivals. He also ownâs his own project studio, and has recorded on many records as a session drummer.\n\nRueben Spyker\n\nIf you chip away at the exterior of Reuben Spyker, you will find threads of DNA leading to the exciting rhythms and fiery spirit found in flamenco, Jazz music, Funk and mysterious sounds of electronic music. Below the surface youâll find a heart of curiosity fuelling a love of learning, a passion for movement and the philosophies behind true self expression. Whether you catch him at a live performance or a clinic, you are sure to have a memorable experience."
