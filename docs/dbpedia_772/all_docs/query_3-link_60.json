        "text": "This book is a lively, comprehensive and timely reader on the music video, capitalising on cross-disciplinary research expertise, which represents a substantial academic engagement with the music video, a mediated form and practice that still remains relatively under-explored in a 21st century context. The music video has remained suspended between two distinct poles. On the one hand, the music video as the visual sheen of late capitalism, at the intersection of celebrity studies and postmodernism. On the other hand, the music video as art, looking to a prehistory of avant-garde film-making while perpetually pushing forward the digital frontier with a taste for anarchy, controversy, and the integration of special effects into a form designed to be disseminated across digital platforms. In this way, the music video virally re-engenders debates about high art and low culture. This collection presents a comprehensive account of the music video from a contemporary 21st century perspective. This entails revisiting key moments in the canonical history of the music video, exploring its articulations of sexuality and gender, examining its functioning as a form of artistic expression between music, film and video art, and following the music video’s dissemination into the digital domain, considering how digital media and social media have come to re-invent the forms and functions of the music video, well beyond the limits of “music television”.

Mostly the aesthetics are informed by the features and possibilities of digital software and hardware, but also by analog devices, for example slide and overhead projectors on the visual side of things. Even if many forms of visual music explore dance or dance-like characteristics, they do not always feature dancing images. The focus of this essay will be on tendencies in contemporary visual music where images are made to dance in various ways. These tendencies are based on refinements and new developments in software and hardware. In the first part, “The New Elasticity of Images,” the essay examines new possibilities to set images in dance in relation to music; in the second part, “Film Beat,” it explores experiments that simultaneously process image and sound, and their resulting audiovisual products.

Lund Audiovisual Writings, 2017, http://www.lundaudiovisualwritings.org/aesthetics\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS (submission deadline June 30, 2022) When addressing the relationship between photography and sound, Angus Carlyle (2016) drew affinities between field recording practices and those of the New Topographics movement, given that both regard stillness and immersion within the landscape. In his work 'America', Baudrillard (1988, 6) offers a reading on silence, juxtaposed to the sonorities the contours of an image can evoke: «the silence of the desert is a visual thing». Framing our spatial surroundings can indeed allow us to map the silences and noises that shape them, where the presence/absence of the human figure can act as a mirror of intimacy and a scale that accentuates the dimension of the place, whether natural or constructed. In fact, numerous photographers, videographers, filmmakers and visual – and sound! – artists have explored this concept. However, the relationship between sound and image, in photography, entails values beyond the fruition of the place and the landscape. The sound-image synchrony can be understood as an exercise on the visualisation of sound – as well as the ‘sonority’ of the image – that substantiates the approach on the medium as a document indissoluble from its cultural context. It is the object itself, subjected to ‘loss and erasure’ and preservation of the material ‘noise’, that Christoph Cox (2001) establishes as the key-element to the relationship between photography and sound. Therefore, it is relevant to also consider the haptic qualities, as well as the questions on materiality and synaesthesia that the axis photography-sound confines. It become s pertinent to question: what is an image? In what way do photographs act as visual instructions to the sonic experience? Can we discuss synaesthesia when the sight-sound relationship renders meaning? In what manner is meaning dependent on visual literacy and the transmission of references? And what approaches can be devised when the scope is amplified to the discourse between photography and music? We thus invite Photographers and Visual Studies scholars, but also researchers in fields such as Art History, Musicology and Architecture, to offer an interdisciplinary approach to photography and visual sound: on the one hand, as the fruition of the soundscape/landscape as an audiovisual document; on the other, as an exercise on the visualisation of sound and its role in contemporary visual culture and its transmedial manifestations. The key topics we wish to propose for discussion are: — The relationship between photography and sound: transmedial capture of sound and light. — Reframing the New Topographics Movement: capturing soundscapes, atmospheres, and sense of place in man altered environments. — Architectures of Sound: representations and perceptions of space and sound. — Photography as a sonic texture: metaphors, materiality and meaning . — The luminal space and the capture of time, rhythms, and transferences. — Framing visual sound: from oscilloscopes to synaesthesia. — The role of photography in publishing music: visual literacy and the orchestration of an image via album covers. — Visualisation of music: aesthetic, photographic image, and music videos. — Visual identity and musical idioms .\n\nThe notion of the convergence between sound and visuals emerged as an exploration of new digital processes, creative possibilities of media technologies and creation of new artistic artefacts. With advancements in technology, creative audiovisual practices employ explorations in technological processes, software experimentation and creative aesthetics that are pursued by most artists. Music plays a significant role in this combination of art forms, bridging and forming connections and relationships between visuals and sound. With the prominence of music in such practice, music producers have since taken steps to bridge their initial field of music across to an interdisciplinary audiovisual combination. This paper examines this form of audiovisual practice from the viewpoint of a musician - specifically a music producer or one that creates and produces his or her own music. This paper discusses current trends within audiovisual practice, highlighting relevant relationships and integrated technologies, along with the reasons, roles, and impact in terms of the artistic, economic, social and cultural aspects. A practical field research was also conducted in Berlin, Germany, where my findings from volunteering at an audiovisual arts festival are discussed within this paper as well. Future work would involve creating audiovisual works of my own, creating a sense of personal artistic practice in response to the results of this paper."
