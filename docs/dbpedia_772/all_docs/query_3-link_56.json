Spear introduce a groundbreaking new theory of organizational management. Organizations win by using three mechanisms to slowify, simplify, and amplify, which systematically moves problem-solving from high-risk danger zones to low-risk winning zones.\n\nA 2024 Eric Hoffer Book Award Finalist!\n\nDecode the Wiring Secrets behind High-Performing Teams\n\nDevOps, Lean, and Agile got us part of the way. Now, Wiring the Winning Organization gets us over the finish line.\n\nDrawing on decades of meticulous research of high-performing organizations and cross-population surveys of tens of thousands of employees, award-winning authors Gene Kim and Dr. Steven J. Spear introduce a groundbreaking new theory of organizational management. Organizations win by using three mechanisms to slowify, simplify, and amplify, which systematically moves problem-solving from high-risk danger zones to low-risk winning zones.\n\nSlowification makes problem-solving easier to do.\n\nSimplification makes the problems themselves easier to solve.\n\nAmplification ensures problems are seen and solved.\n\nWiring the Winning Organization shows how the decisive factor in high-performing enterprises is organizational wiring that enables innovation, excellence, and greatness to flourish. In this data-driven playbook for excellence, leaders will learn how to achieve greater agility, higher quality, faster time to market, greater resilience, and higher employee engagement and profitability.\n\nThis is the rare leadership book that delivers concrete tools—not platitudes—to convert mediocrity into mastery.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nDozens of real-world case studies and examples demonstrating how leading organizations leverage the three mechanisms to drive exceptional results.\n\nPractical methods and tools for diagnosing areas within your organization that need improvement and implementing changes to enhance performance. The book provides concrete ways to apply the theory in your specific context.\n\nProvides a common language and framework for redesigning workflows, coordinating teams, and structuring communications and problem-solving. This equips you to clearly articulate and spread desired changes.\n\nShares techniques for empowering people at all levels to work smarter, faster, and better by reshaping their daily experiences and environment. This allows more distributed leadership.\n\nProvides approaches for anticipating and mitigating risk, streamlining operations, boosting quality, shortening cycle times, and fostering innovation. The mechanisms work across all key aspects of organizational performance.\n\nOutlines methods for converting frustration and stagnation into motivation and progress by moving people from danger zones into winning zones. This leads to greater job satisfaction and retention."
