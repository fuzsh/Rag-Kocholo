        "text": "AEJ and I went to the UT – Baylor football game this afternoon here in Austin. Like a few weeks ago in Columbus, I was at the game as a guest of the band. (This is not a rough life.)\n\nThe man to thank for the tickets today: Professor Jerry Junkin, Director of Bands at UT Austin. Yes, he always looks this cool.\n\nJunkin does it all.\n\nConductor…\n\n… father…\n\n… and golf cart chauffeur.\n\nIt’s a lot of fun going to these games. Always lots to see — like the pre-game fly-over.\n\nAnd tubas.\n\nA lot of people don’t appreciate the burden of being a tuba player. These are some serious guys. The burdens of tuba are, indeed, heavy.\n\nWhere do I get a “TUBA!” baseball hat?! Somebody? Come on, Christmas is coming!\n\n“Psst… You guys wanna buy some gasoline?”\n\nHere’s the UT mascot. What’s his name? It seems like I should know his name if I’m going to be a real UT fan.\n\nSome of the conductors unintentionally reenact the last scene of Oceans 11.\n\nThe Scarlett Letter was nothing. Commit adultery in Waco, and this is your punishment.\n\nI didn’t have sideline access for this game (like I said, my life is really rough), but we had a great vantage point to take pictures of the guys conducting the marching band in the stands. Here’s Damon Talley, posing for his upcoming album cover, “Jazz Cats.”\n\nRob Carnochan’s album cover is a bit more introspective.\n\nCormac Cannon monitors band security during the game. Whenever they spot Junkin approaching, it’s always “Bertha is On Foot. I repeat, Bertha is On Foot.”\n\nScott Hanna doesn’t take any shit from the clarinets. “Where does the music come from? It’d better F-ING come from RIGHT F-ING HERE.”\n\nI feel like this one should be the cover of an instructional video — something only available on VHS. “Do Re Mi Yi Haw: Teaching the Fundamentals of Texas Music.”\n\nBelt buckle not included.\n\nOh — there was a football game, too. Well, of sorts. It was tied at one point, but when we left, I think it was 45-14.\n\nVictory is sweet. Hanna gloats."
