MCCANDLISH: Growing up in Leland and thinking about where I lived, it seems somewhat like a Mayberry to me.\n\nIt was a very tight-knit community.\n\nPeople knew each other.\n\nPeople really cared about each other.\n\nKEVIN MAGEE: I grew up kind of a latchkey kid and had the run of the town, basically.\n\nI felt like, growing up, that the whole thing belonged to me, and I could go anywhere and do just about anything that I could get away with.\n\nBRANDON TAYLOR: Certain places, you know, we couldn't, you know, we couldn't visit.\n\nI mean, just like these park benches, you know.\n\nThis park was off, off-limits, you know, to Blacks.\n\n♪ ♪ EVELYN GORDON-MURRAY: Leland was divided.\n\nYou had Black Dog, where I grew up, and you had the white section.\n\n(insects chirping) VAN POINDEXTER: There was always a railroad track.\n\nThere was always a creek.\n\nThere was always a road.\n\nThere was always some marker that divided the neighborhoods.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: In 1969, my hometown of Leland, Mississippi, finally had to reckon with something it had been avoiding for years.\n\nROGER MUDD: In 1954, the Supreme Court made school integration the law of the land, a law to be implemented with all deliberate speed.\n\nLast fall, the court ruled that after 15 years, deliberation should end, and speed meant now.\n\nJOHN BELL WILLIAMS: The quality of public education in a great portion of our state has been made an impossibility under conditions inflicted on our public schools by a vindictive, autocratic, arbitrary Supreme Court.\n\nAll Blacks that was involved was nervous about it, because we didn't know what was going to happen next, but we were still trying to do what we felt like was right.\n\nThe only thing I can see this leading to is the destruction of our school system.\n\nThe Negro children, on a whole, are further behind in their studies than our children.\n\nMAN: We've got a psychology running in this state which is very deeply negative about the possibilities of Black and white working this thing out together.\n\nBecause of it, we've managed to stay 50th or 48th for a mighty long time, while we're so busy holding one down and keeping the other just on top.\n\nREPORTER: What are your thoughts about going to school with about half and half white and Black students?\n\nI don't care.\n\nI mean, you know, the same people.\n\nI think we all should be together.\n\nAnd I hope that we could get along together.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: My class was the first in Mississippi to have Black kids and white kids in school together from the first day of first grade to high school graduation.\n\nWe were supposed to be the seeds of a great harvest of racial harmony.\n\nThree decades later, I needed to understand what happened, and why America is still so divided even after all we went through.\n\nI went back to find out.\n\n♪ ♪ ♪ You can't hurry God ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ You got to wait ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Give him time ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ He's a God ♪ ♪ You can't hurry ♪ ♪ He'll

BLACKMON: If you have any vision in your mind of a cotton plantation in the Deep South, the place you are imagining is the Mississippi Delta.\n\n♪ ♪ In the 1960s, Leland was still as harshly segregated as it ever was.\n\nIn those very early years, I just noticed that it was all white over here and all Black over there, and Black folks had more trouble than white folks.\n\nAnd it perplexed me.\n\nI started asking a lot of questions, which seemed uncomfortable to everybody I asked them to, including my parents at times.\n\nAnd so, I couldn't make any sense out of it.\n\n♪ ♪ Later, in middle school, I became aware of a place called Strike City.\n\nStrike City was a settlement just outside of town, created in the middle of the 1960s after a group of Black tenant farmers went on strike.\n\nJOHN HENRY SYLVESTER: The reason we went on strike, I was tired of working for six dollars a day, and I was tired of my wife and kids working for three dollars a day.\n\n♪ ♪ DOUGLAS BLACKMON: They were among the very first African Americans in American history to rebel in this way against a white landowner.\n\nThere was a town oratorical contest sponsored by the Lions Club, and so I decide to write a speech about Strike City.\n\nI went to the library, read stories that had been written in the local papers at the time.\n\nI learned that the strikers were thrown out of their homes, they were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, the men are blackballed from employment.\n\nNone of the men ever work again.\n\nAll kinds of terrible experiences.\n\nSo my little boy essay maps all this out, and at the end says, \"Martin Luther King came along, and the Civil Rights Movement solved everything.\"\n\nThat was the conclusion.\n\n(laughs) And so, the day of the contest, I go in.\n\nAnd, of course, it's a room of about 45 middle-aged white men.\n\n♪ ♪ The other students give their speeches, and then I get up and give my speech about Strike City.\n\nAnd immediately, as soon as I start speaking, I realize that something, something's wrong.\n\nAs soon as I mention Strike City, the men in the room begin to snicker.\n\nI was so confused.\n\nThen as I proceed through the speech, and talk about the courage of the strikers, they go dead silent.\n\nWhen I get to the part about the Ku Klux Klan attacking them, there's no response whatsoever.\n\nI don't win the contest, naturally.\n\nThen afterwards, all the men file by and shake our hands.\n\nBut this one fellow stands back, and waits till the others are gone.\n\nAnd then he comes up to me, and he attacks.\n\n\"Who told you all those things, boy?\n\n\"Where did you get all that stuff, boy?\n\nNothing like that happened.\"\n\nYou know, \"Did your momma and daddy tell you all that stuff?\"\n\n\"They,\" you know, \"They fillin' your head with lies.\"\n\nAnd he gets louder and louder, and I stood there thinking, why is this happening?\n\nWhy is this man so angry at me?\n\nAnd he's yelling and screaming.\n\nFinally, my teacher comes over, bumps into the guy, and says, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nAnd he spins around and takes off.\n\nSINGER: ♪ He'll be there ♪ DOUGLAS BLACKMON: That was the beginning of my quest.\n\nI became obsessed with trying to get to the bottom of, you know, why is this the way that things are?\n\nSINGER: ♪ When you want him ♪ ♪ He's right on time ♪ ♪ ♪ (radio tuning) DOUGLAS BLACKMON: In 1967, my dad was finishing his Ph.D. and got a job at a research laboratory in the Mississippi Delta.\n\nSo my parents, two older brothers, and I moved from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Leland.\n\n(radio tuning) I was three years old.\n\n♪ ♪ For me, that's when this story began.\n\nSARAH BLACKMON: We chose to live in Leland.\n\nWe liked that our children would be able to do things on their own, that they could ride their bicycles around town.\n\nUh, we, we liked the idea of a small town.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: Leland was a busy, growing community in the 1960s.\n\nThe farm economy was strong, particularly for the people who owned large amounts of land.\n\nAlmost everyone made their living, one way or another, off the vast cotton and soybean fields that surrounded us.\n\n(pipe organ playing, people singing) People came from far and wide at Christmas every year to see the decorations on the wide creek flowing through the center of town.\n\n(marching band playing) Every fall, there was football and homecoming parades that wound through town and ended up on the field.\n\n(band playing) Everyone seemed to agree that Leland was a special place, a little wealthier than most, better educated, more tolerant than other places nearby, and it did have a certain unique spirit.\n\n(marching band continues) (crowd cheering and applauding) JAMES LACEY: At that time, Leland had an unusually good school system.\n\nIt was the pride of the community.\n\nI grew up going to the Leland schools.\n\nWe rode school bus number 13.\n\n(laughs) High school-- it was a really good time.\n\nAnd there were 35 people, I think, in my graduating class in 1960.\n\n(whistle blows, crowd cheering) ANNOUNCER: Fourth down coming up.\n\n(crowd cheering) NEILL: Football was the big sport.\n\nEverybody from town was at the game on Friday night.\n\nEverybody rooted for the Cubs.\n\n♪ ♪ It was a community-supported...\n\nThere again, in, in these terms of modern days, it was a white- community-supported, um, school.\n\n♪ ♪ There was a team on the other side of town.\n\nGosh, I hate saying it this way.\n\n(laughs) But that's the way it was.\n\nI mean, that's the way we grew up.\n\n♪ ♪ BILLY BARBER: Breisch High School was the high school for Black people and Black athletes in Leland, Mississippi.\n\nYou know, they did a good job.\n\nThey competed, they...\n\nThey, they played for titles.\n\nWe had one of the best basketball teams in the state.\n\nBasketball, football, track.\n\nWe didn't have a gym.\n\nWe played on the bare ground outside.\n\nWe had a football field.\n\nIt wasn't, you know, with the bleachers and all, but you had a football field.\n\nOh, we had good, some great ballplayers.\n\nHad some great ballplayers.\n\nThey would even have a crowd, a cheering crowd, a supportive crowd.\n\nLoved the mascot.\n\nWe were the, the Braves.\n\nThe Breisch High Braves.\n\nBARBER: You know, you take Breisch High and go back and check the history, they could compete with any team in the state of Mississippi.\n\n♪ ♪ The school was like the center of social life for the Black people in Leland.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: The crazy thing was, racial segregation was illegal.\n\n15 years had passed since the Supreme Court declared in 1954 that segregation had to be dismantled forever.\n\nBut during those years, Leland remained two very separate worlds: one white and one Black.\n\nIn the white version, many people were still enthralled with \"Gone With the Wind\" fantasies about Confederate officers, Southern belles, and ugly racial attitudes.\n\n(people talking and laughing, \"Evalyne\" playing) Then, in 1969, something enormous happened.\n\nThe Supreme Court spoke again.\n\nThere could be no more delays.\n\nAll separate Black and white schools had to be completely combined, almost overnight.\n\nA giant social experiment that would radically change American society was beginning.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King's dream of a nation where the children of former slaves and slave owners would grow up together was finally supposed to be happening.\n\nAnd somehow, all those millions of kids were expected to heal America's racial divide.\n\nIn the fall of 1970, my hometown's first fully integrated class of Black and white first-graders began school together-- on the same day, in the same classrooms, with the same teachers and books.\n\nAnd that was my class.\n\nGORDON-MURRAY: When we started the first grade, I didn't know anything that was going on.\n\nYou know, I was six years old, so I didn't know anything about anything.\n\nWe were excited just to be in school.\n\n♪ ♪ DOUGLAS BLACKMON: As the first day of first grade was coming up, I had absolutely no idea that there was anything whatsoever happening except that school was beginning, and I finally got to go.\n\nThere was no conversation about, you know, anything, you know, being different.\n\nWe were just going to another school.\n\nBe on your best behavior, you know?\n\nLike your parents would want you to.\n\nThere were Black kids in my class.\n\nThat didn't strike me as surprising or unusual, because it was the only thing I...\n\nIt was the only kind of school I knew.\n\nDONALD RICHARDSON: From a, a five-year-old's perspective, there was no difference in the children.\n\nBlack, white.\n\nMCCANDLISH: I didn't really have any awareness of the racial integration.\n\nI think I was just trying to make new friends.\n\nJESSIE KING: It was the very first time I experienced...\n\nThe experience of interacting with the white students was at the school, and I thought it was cool.\n\nBARBER: I came from a Head Start in Strike City that was all-Black.\n\nAnd going to school and, you know, there was some white here and white there.\n\nI mean, it wasn't just something that I saw every day.\n\nKING: We all were receiving the same multiplication facts.\n\nWe were all getting the same vowel sounds.\n\nWe were all reading from \"Sally, Dick, and Jane\" books.\n\nThere was no difference.\n\nIt was school.\n\nIt was first grade.\n\nI was, I was allowed to be a first-grader without the shackles of the responsibility that, \"You are in the first class of integration, \"as a first-grader.\n\nOur hopes and dreams are on your shoulders.\"\n\nI didn't have any of that.\n\nAnd I think that's... That's pretty good, for my parents.\n\nNot to have scared me out of... (laughing): ...scared me out of my wits about, you know, racial situations, being where we're from.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: None of that should have been necessary.\n\nJAMES M. NABRIT, JR.: It is my opinion that the South will comply with the decision of the court and accept it.\n\nI don't think there's any question about it in the South.\n\nPeople in the South are just as law-abiding as anybody else.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: In the years since the Supreme Court decision in 1954, segregation was supposed to have disappeared.\n\nBut in Mississippi and almost everywhere in the South, nothing had truly changed.\n\nWOMAN: I'm against the niggers and the whites going to school together.\n\nI think that, um, we as white people have developed an air of superiority over their race.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: In a few places, like Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas, a handful of Black students were eventually able to enroll in previously all-white schools.\n\n(shouting) DOUGLAS BLACKMON: But soon, huge numbers of white Southerners were fighting tooth and nail to preserve segregation.\n\nVERONICA RICHARDSON: The Little Rock Nine, we were glued to the newspapers and to the television.\n\nWe didn't participate in it too much around here.\n\nI guess it was a little too risky, but we were glued to it and we talked about it.\n\nWe were so happy that somebody did that.\n\nCOLEMAN: Where we were, whatever was going on in Little Rock wasn't about to happen here-- not any time soon.\n\n♪ ♪ (insects chirping) DOUGLAS BLACKMON: No place in America has a more terrible past than Mississippi, with its long abuse of African Americans and violent resistance to racial equality.\n\n♪ ♪ But as a young child, I had almost no understanding of that.\n\nNo one ever spoke of the nightmare lynching in Leland 50 years earlier.\n\nOr the murder in 1955 of a Black pastor on the other end of the county after he began registering Black voters.\n\nOr the church burnings and KKK rallies not far away.\n\nOr the two civil rights workers beaten in Leland during Freedom Summer in 1964, the year I and most of my classmates were born.\n\nI can't remember hearing anything about Emmett Till, the African American 14-year-old brutally killed barely 50 miles from my hometown for supposedly whistling at a white woman.\n\nAnd the grown-ups I knew rarely ever offered any explanation for why Black people all around us suffered such relentless, grinding poverty.\n\nThat was at the heart of racial segregation, and separating Black and white children during the school day was the cornerstone of an entire system of life designed to deny education and services for Black children and to trap their parents in work that made some white people wealthy, but left millions of Black families desperate.\n\nVERNICE SANDERS: My family were sharecroppers.\n\nAny family that lives on a farm, you know, their kids was out there, too.\n\nWe chopped cotton, picked cotton.\n\nIt was a hard, difficult life.\n\nI really wanted an education.\n\nI would get up early in the morning and go out and do work, and then go to school.\n\nBut the boss man stopped that.\n\nHe told my dad that I had to be out there chopping cotton.\n\nAnd so I had to go to school whenever there wasn't anything else to do.\n\nSCOTT: We picked cotton and worked in the field, but we owned our own farm.\n\nWe, we weren't on a white person's farm.\n\n(insects chirping) One day, my daddy had gone to the cotton gin.\n\n(chuckling): And I got on my knees in the cotton.\n\nBoy, he didn't like you to get on your knees.\n\nAnd I prayed.\n\nI asked the Lord, I said, \"Lord, you got to help me to find something else to do.\"\n\nI said, \"I can't stay in this cotton field all my life.\"\n\nSo I made up my mind.\n\nI said, \"I want to go to school.\n\nI want to go to college.\"\n\nSo when my dad came back, I went up to him and I said, \"Dad,\" I said, \"I, I want to go to school.\"\n\nHe said, \"You want to go to school?\"\n\nHe said, \"You go to school.\"\n\nI said, \"I want to go to college,\" I said, \"when I finish school.\"\n\nHe, he hesitated, and he waited a minute.\n\nHe said, \"Well, if you want to go,\" he said, \"I'll help you, if that's what you want to do.\"\n\nAnd he did.\n\n♪ ♪ COLEMAN: I was born and raised here in Leland, Mississippi.\n\nMy father died before I was born, so

That's right, we all went to school together.\n\nBARBER: After college, I left Leland.\n\nI really felt like I was going to do ten years in law enforcement and get out.\n\nBut it kept tugging at me that Leland needed some leadership in law enforcement.\n\nNot to say that I was, I'm the best.\n\nBut I know it was the Lord telling me, \"Go back home to help home out.\"\n\nBrandon and Cedric and Evelyn Gordon told me, said, \"Come on back, come home.\"\n\nI'm still here.\n\nAnd I just think that this is where the Lord wanted me to be.\n\n(congregation singing) DOUGLAS BLACKMON: And I found out that on weekends, Billy Barber has another calling.\n\n(singing) BARBER: Being a police chief is actually not much different from being a pastor.\n\nYou have the same love.\n\nAnd my love is for the citizens, to keep them safe... (congregation singing) ...and just having the love of God, and to love people, and to treat people right and treat people with respect, and, and to try to make the community better.\n\n(singing) (song ends, congregation applauding) (marching band playing) (shouting and cheering) (speaking indistinctly) Play your hearts out-- whatever position... DOUGLAS BLACKMON: Cedric Bush had been a football superstar in high school, the kind of young athlete who actually had a shot at playing professional football.\n\nBUSH: I thought about a conversation with one of my professors.\n\nAnd, um, and he had asked the question, he said, \"What do you plan to do once you're done with college?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Oh, man, I'm going to the pros, \"I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do that, and buy my dad a truck, I'm gonna build Mom a house.\"\n\nHe said, \"Yeah, but what if that doesn't work out?\"\n\nI said, \"What do you mean, if it doesn't work out?\n\nI'm, I'm, you know, I'm good-- I, I'm gonna make it.\"\n\nHe said, \"Listen.\n\n\"Your parents sent you to school to get an education.\n\n\"When you get the education, \"you're supposed to get the knowledge \"and take it back home to help build your community.\"\n\nNow, I never heard that before in my life.\n\nNo, right there!\n\nRight there!\n\n(voiceover): He gave me the greatest tool that I could ever hear as a young man.\n\nI end up coming home.\n\nI went to the school system to coach and teach.\n\nANNOUNCER: Touchdown, Cubs.\n\nBUSH: And then I began my political career and ran for the city council.\n\nI served, uh, one term.\n\nNow, serving as a justice court judge, you do more help to people than harm to people.\n\nSome people just need a second chance.\n\nAnd that's who I am, that's the role I try to play in coming back home to help my community.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: Cedric and his wife also went into business, taking over the old Leland Café.\n\nThey now run the restaurant that wouldn't have let their parents enter through the front door.\n\nThey also started a funeral home at the center of Leland's downtown and in the same building where the segregated Rex Theater had once operated.\n\nBUSH: To be proud owners of this particular building, knowing the history behind it, you can't beat it.\n\nYou can't beat it.\n\nBrandon Taylor and Evelyn Gordon-Murray were elected to the school board.\n\nShe has served more than ten years.\n\nBrandon is president of the board.\n\nTAYLOR: I played basketball at, uh, Baylor.\n\nAnd then I went across seas to Germany.\n\nI could've stayed across seas and played in other countries, but I love, you know, the smalltown feel, the smalltown atmosphere.\n\nThere's nothing like being at home.\n\nWhat made me decide to run for the school board?\n\nMy love for the kids.\n\nI want to make sure the children have someone fighting for them every day.\n\nGORDON-MURRAY: I would like to see our school back like it used to be.\n\nIf we had more whites in our school, you would have the backing of the community.\n\nMAN: ...the stadium, uh, you see the... DOUGLAS BLACKMON: A few years later, after an unexpected drop in the performance of Leland schools and a succession of superintendents who struggled to turn the system around... And, and all great ideas, we welcome... DOUGLAS BLACKMON: ...the board hired another of our classmates, Jessie King, to be school superintendent.\n\nWe need to clear it up.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: In the years since then, student scores in Leland have improved dramatically.\n\nKING: When I was a teacher, and the superintendent said, \"Jessie, what do you want to do in life?\n\nI mean, what would be your dream job?\"\n\nI said to the superintendent, \"To have your job.\"\n\nAnd the superintendent smiled and said, \"You can have it someday.\"\n\nAnd someday came.\n\nI've been the superintendent of the Leland School District since February of 2016.\n\nGood morning.\n\nWOMAN: Good morning.\n\nJust wanted to stop in and see how learning is progressing.\n\n(voiceover): That first year, I walked into some situations that I just did not know existed in the school district.\n\nThe technology was not here.\n\nThe libraries did not have current, um, books.\n\nAnd so we had a lot of challenges.\n\nAnd our kids deserve better, our kids should have better, and our community, I hope, will help us to make it better.\n\nHello, how are you?\n\n♪ ♪ DOUGLAS BLACKMON: For reasons I've never entirely understood, giving that little speech about Strike City to the Lions Club long ago seemed to connect me to that place and the people who lived there even decades after I no longer lived in Mississippi.\n\nThey were self-sufficient, really, on a lot of stuff.\n\nDOUGLAS BLACKMON: I visited more than once over the years.\n\nAnd in the 1990s, I took a cameraman along and did one of the last interviews with John Henry Sylvester, the leader of the walkout, a few years before he passed away.\n\nAnd then, when we went on strike with him that day, we had to, he, he put us all off the place that day...
