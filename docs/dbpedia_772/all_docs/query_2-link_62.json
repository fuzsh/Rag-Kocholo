        "text": "Subpart P is a new group of healthcare specific regulations covering hazardous waste pharmaceuticals generated at healthcare facilities. The EPA now recognizes that healthcare is fundamentally different from other industries that generate hazardous waste. Their regulations have been updated to reflect that change.\n\nWho does this new rule affect?\n\nThese new regulations apply, but are not limited to\n\nhospitals\n\npharmacies\n\nclinics\n\nveterinary hospitals or clinics\n\nwholesale distributors or retailers\n\nPyrophoric, gases, aerosol, unknown, reactive, explosive and shock-sensitive materials\n\nEthers, THF, dioxane and sodium azide\n\nWhat does the EPA consider ‘pharmaceutical’?\n\nprescription medication\n\nOTC (over the counter) drugs\n\ndietary supplements\n\ncompounded drugs\n\ninvestigational drugs\n\npersonal protective equipment (PPE) contaminated with pharmaceutical waste\n\nclean-up material from pharmaceutical spills\n\nany item for which the FDA requires a “drug Fact” sheet\n\nWhen do these rules become effective?\n\nFor the moment, current Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) rules are enforced. Although Subpart P Rule is final, it will not become effective until six months after publication in the Federal Register. Individual States are required to adopt the rule, but they will have the ability to make changes. Actual rules and effective dates will differ by state.\n\nClean Harbors will continue to closely monitor these regulatory changes. For more information and updates, consult our Subpart P FAQs as well as this link.\n\nClean Harbors provides a wide array of Reactive Material Services to ensure secure chemical management and safe disposal of unstable and explosive materials.\n\nClean Harbors has extensive experience working with unstable and shock-sensitive materials, as well as managing disposal of explosives and materials restricted from transportation. With a vast transportation fleet and permitted transfer storage and disposal facilities throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, we provide turnkey reactive material services.\n\nReactive Material Services require specialized expertise and diverse techniques to ensure safety and compliance. Clean Harbors deploys multiple approaches to fulfill these goals.\n\nDownload Fact Sheet (Reactive Material Services​)\n\nContainer Evaluation\n\nClean Harbors has standard operating procedures for the proper identification and evaluation of shock-sensitive, peroxidizable and unknown reactive materials. We follow strict evaluation criteria including age, storage conditions, exposure, contamination and stability.\n\nChemical Stabilization\n\nClean Harbors understands the disadvantages of controlled detonation and has developed sound chemical stabilization techniques that enable us to manage the following types of potentially unstable materials (along with others on a case-by-case basis):\n\nPeroxide-forming compounds\n\nTemperature-sensitive compounds\n\nOrganic peroxides\n\nShock-sensitive compounds\n\nMulti-nitrated compounds\n\nAzides\n\nRemote Container Opening Procedures\n\nOur Reactive Material specialists take every precaution and limit the handling of hazardous and potentially unstable materials. We use specially designed equipment for all reactive remediation and stabilization projects, including pneumatically driven machinery that can remotely open a container.\n\nEngineering Controls and Personal Protective Equipment\n\nOur state-of-the-art engineering controls include devices such as:\n\nTrailer-mounted blast deflection units\n\nPortable remote openers with bomb blanket and safety circle\n\nCustom-designed remote drum openers\n\nATF Type III Blasters day boxes\n\nOur personal protective equipment protects our employees from high heat, flames and explosions and includes:\n\nFire proximity suits\n\nExplosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) protective search suits\n\nRiot helmet, Kevlar® vest, and Nomex® coveralls (standard issue)\n\nUnknown Compound Fingerprint Analysis\n\nOur CleanPack® chemists provide fingerprint analysis for unknown compounds within lab pack-sized containers provided that the materials pass our safety evaluation. If these materials fail the evaluation and are suspected to be shock-sensitive, unstable or reactive, they must be remotely opened and tested before packaging.\n\nClean Harbors provides safe, cost-effective Cylinder and Compressed Gas Management and disposal.\n\nClean Harbors highly trained specialists―who meet rigid personnel qualifications―handle all types of cylinder projects from the removal of a single lecture bottle to large-scale, multi-phase cylinder remediation efforts.
