        "text": "The privilege afforded to anglophone whiteness in English Canada would seem to be at odds with the cliché that Canadian national identity is elusive. As a settler society, English Canada imagines itself relative to the others it defines within a complex process of indigenization. Critical attention has usually focused on the way the indigenous is represented to insist upon the seamless integration of settler cultures into their physical environments and to exonerate them from traumatic colonial histories. Viewing indigenization as a simultaneous abnegation of foreign traits, this essay investigates the signifying process as it relates to ‘exogeneity’, or foreign otherness, in English Canada. A comparative analysis of Ernest Thompson Seton’s Two Little Savages (1903) and Dionne Brand’s What We All Long For (2005) reveals the way in which consistent representations of the foreign – the ‘exogene’ and the ‘exogenous’ – remain integral to the articulation of national identity in English ...\n\nThis dissertation is a comparative study of the establishment of settler colonies in the American Midwest (1778-1795) and French colonial Algeria (1830-1848). It examines how interactions between the Indigenous populations, colonists, colonial administrators, the military, and the métropole shaped their development and advances the theory of settler colonialism. This study centers on the first fifteen to twenty years of conquest/occupation in the American Midwest, focusing specifically on southern Illinois and Indiana, and the province of Constantine, Algeria. Despite differences in geography, relative size of the military presence and Indigenous demographics, the process of establishing settler colonies in both locations followed similar trajectories. The study analyzes the founding moment of initial military occupation in Indiana/Illinois in 1778 and Constantine in 1836-1837 as well as subsequent land policies, settlement, and Indigenous resistance movements. I argue that settler colonies in the American Midwest and Algeria resulted from a bottom-up process in which settler desires for land and greater economic opportunities compelled them to migrate (or emigrate) and stake their claim to these territories. This movement then served as a catalyst for initially makeshift colonial policies that only became systematized over time. The relationship between settlers and the Indigenous populations in both locations, as well as administrators' responses to prevailing circumstances on the ground shaped the establishment of stable settler governments. This research broadens our conceptions of American history and deepens our understanding of the processes by which settler colonies formed and \"worked.\" Settler colonialism's legacy continues to influence geopolitics, national policy decisions, and people's daily lives. Hence, the formation and eventual structures of settler colonies help researchers explain the founding of many contemporary societies and, taken together, recast empire, settler roles, and Indigenous actions within colonial contexts."
