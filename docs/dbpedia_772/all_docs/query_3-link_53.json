Laser interferometers are highly sensitive to changes in the size and index of refraction of the main beam splitter. Using cross-correlated data of the Fermilab Holometer instrument, which consists of twin colocated 40-m arm length power-recycled interferometers, we investigate the possible existence of scalar field dark matter candidates in the mass range between $1.6\\ifmmode\\times\\else\\texttimes\\fi{}{10}^{\\ensuremath{-}12}\\text{ }\\text{ }\\mathrm{eV}$ and $1.0\\ifmmode\\times\\else\\texttimes\\fi{}{10}^{\\ensuremath{-}7}\\text{ }\\text{ }\\mathrm{eV}$. We set new upper limits for the coupling parameters of scalar field dark matter, improving on limits from previous direct searches by up to 3 orders of magnitude.",
