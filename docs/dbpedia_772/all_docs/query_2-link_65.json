        "text": "(upbeat music) - Uptown was the number one place for African Americans to go was to have a good time, cheap, to see all the acts in the country.\n\nYou get the whole Motown review there on one show.\n\n- The Isley Brothers, Donnie Elbert the singer, and The Chantels, Chuck Berry, Frankie Lymon, The Cadillacs.\n\nPeople couldn't wait to go there.\n\n- Georgie Woods, he was just so handsome.\n\nHe was a legend in Philadelphia.\n\nSo just being on a Georgie Woods rock and roll show, you felt important.\n\n- I'll never forget it.\n\nI can see me at the Uptown.\n\nAnd my name was in the marquee.\n\nYou know, I said, \"Wow.\"\n\nI said, \"That's Barbara Mason, right?\"\n\nThat's me.\n\n- When you walk in the door, that smell of that nice fresh popcorn being popping.\n\nI'm telling you that was the greatest thing since peanut butter.\n\n- We did not make a lot of money, but it was the most joyous time in our life because we loved what we did and we loved where we did it.\n\n- The Uptown started in the twenties as a movie theater, and even in like working class neighborhoods, you're getting pretty ornate theaters.\n\nIt is what the movie experience is in the twenties, thirties and forties in the United States.\n\nIt was the chief form of entertainment and it was really an affordable luxury.\n\n- The feel of North Broad Street in the late twenties was a feeling of action and a feeling of change.\n\nPersonal entertainment exploded with the creation of the motion picture industry, and in particular, talkies.\n\nTheater was designed by their firm of Magaziner, Eberhard & Harris, and the leading principle in that architectural firm was Lewis Magaziner.\n\nThe style of the Uptown Theater is a combination on the outside.\n\nIt's been described as an Aztec revival with the brick work.\n\nOn the inside, it is all art deco.\n\nThis image of the foyer with a fantastic art deco lighting fixture, as well as the mural over the doors, is indicative of what they would find once they got through those doors into the main auditorium.\n\n- If you wanted to go up to the balcony, there were two sets of stairs.\n\nYou come in the front door and you go up this way.\n\nThis is an awesome theater.\n\n- Red drape briefs, soft cush seating.\n\nIt was just beautiful.\n\nThick carpet on the floors, beautiful marbling, antique ceilings.\n\nBathrooms were beautiful.\n\n- Because even the lesser spots in the theater got first end treatment.\n\nThere were retiring rooms for the ladies, retiring rooms for the men.\n\nBetween the retiring room for the ladies was a cosmetic room so that they could fix their makeup before they headed back out into the theater.\n\nThe Broad Street subway had just opened the year before, and so while the Uptown was under construction, they actually had a station stop that went directly into the theater building.\n\n- You could take the subway and get off right in the theater.\n\nSo, I mean, that was the sweet thing about it.\n\n- [Bruce] For the first time in history, beautiful, extraordinarily ornate interiors were being created for the general masses, not just for very wealthy or aristocratic folks.\n\n- The Stiefels first got into the entertainment business with movie houses.\n\nThat would've been in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\nWe also had theaters that produced live entertainment and in Philadelphia, they included the Pearl, the Carman, the Roxy, Nixon Grand, the Fays, and of course later, the Uptown.\n\nIt was a 2000 seat venue and it enabled them to showcase a number of the stars whose careers they had been fostering for the prior decades.\n\nPearl Bailey was discovered by one of the Stiefels, Sam.\n\nShe was a school girl in Philadelphia, and he permitted her to practice her act after the shows at The Pearl.\n\nAnd many years later, she came to perform at the Uptown.\n\n- The Chitlin' Circuit existed because of segregation, as simple as that.\n\nIt was a string of theaters and clubs, originally in the South, where black artists played in front of black audiences.\n\n- This series of venues included five major theaters, of which we own three.\n\nAnd we had the Uptown in Philadelphia, The Royal in Baltimore, and The Howard in Washington.\n\nThe Apollo in New York is the best known.\n\nThere was also the Regal in Chicago.\n\n- The Uptown, it was always a famous place to go to because they had vaudeville acts there like Pearl Bailey and the Nicholas Brothers and the Mills Brothers.\n\n- I went to the Uptown as a kid to see Pearl Bailey, but Pearl Bailey husband was Louie Bellson.\n\nAnd I didn't know Louie Bellson was her husband.\n\nHe was the first drummer ever to have two bass drums on the stage.\n\nI was just amazed at that because nobody had ever done that before.\n\n- One of the things that's often overlooked are the terrific gospel singers we had, such as Clara Ward and her singers.\n\nAnd the theater would often pair her with a religious film.\n\nSo I remember seeing, I think it was 1956, \"The Ten Commandments,\" and I can tell you Charlton Heston as Moses and Clara Ward on the same bill made for quite a powerful duo.\n\n- Some of that kind of really important acts were the comedians, and they would perform early, and they, you know, they killed with their audiences.\n\n- I remember seeing many comedians.\n\nRed Fox, Jackie Moms Mabley, and Pigmeat Markham.\n\nPigmeat Markham's act was satirized courtroom decorum, and he had a signature line, \"Here come the judge.\"\n\n- His honor, judge Pigmeat Markham.\n\n- [All] Here come the judge.\n\n- And those of you who may remember the popular series \"Laugh-In\" on TV, he was given a cameo role and every now and again would appear.\n\n- I got to see Moms Mabley, Pigmeat Markham, and Red Fox at the Uptown.\n\nOh my God.\n\nMoms Mabley, she was something else.\n\nYes, she was.\n\n(gentle jazz music) - Well, I think the first thing important to understand about Georgie Woods is he's really a man of his moment.\n\nAnd by that I mean he is part of the Great Migration.\n\nHe's born in Georgia to a segregated world, follows the railroad first to New York and then to Philadelphia, like tens of thousands of millions of others of his generation.\n\n- He was working on a couple of the local radio stations, WHAT and WDAS, and he was hired in 1957 to start producing shows at the Uptown.\n\n- Georgie was the game, black wise in Philadelphia, and you had Jocko Henderson, Kay Williams, Daddy Kay they called him, Lord Fauntleroy.\n\nThey had all these different guys.\n\nThey all meant something, but Georgie was the one that everybody loved.\n\n- The history and the past that Georgie Woods has for me in my life goes way back to my childhood.\n\nHe was on early in the morning, so while we were preparing to go to school, you know, occasionally we'll be listening to some sounds that he played on the radio.\n\n- I used to call him on the air in the morning just to say, \"Thank you, George.\n\nI heard you playing my record last night.\n\nI was listening to the radio and I just listened to WJS all day, all night.\"\n\n- Georgie Woods, like everyone else is looking for a side hustle.\n\nAnd the Uptown was sort of hit wing or one of his side hustles.\n\n- As a disc jockey, you know, he did the job, didn't play that much, so he used that to supplement the funds that we didn't get from the radio station.\n\nSo that's how I got involved in it.\n\nIt was designed to attract people.\n\nAnd I tell you, I didn't have any idea about attracting anybody special.\n\nIt was the idea of attracting people who's gonna pay 50 this and get in and see the show.\n\n- Georgie Woods would come on with his little movements and singing, oh, Mary, don't you...\n\nHe couldn't sing or dance.\n\nIt was so funny.\n\nSo we laughed a lot.\n\nDoc Bagby was the first musical director at that time.\n\nGeorgie Woods' theme song was Doc Bagby's \"Joy Ride.\"\n\nThe \"Joy Ride\" song would come on and you knew the show would start then.\n\n- I remember that song.\n\nIt was wonderful.\n\n(Marilyn humming) (upbeat jazz music) That's enough.\n\n(gentle piano music) - Sam Reed was the house director of the Uptown Theater.\n\nHe ran the band, he hired the musicians.\n\nHis wife was Sarah Dash from Patti LaBelle And The Bluebells, and LeBelle also.\n\nIf somebody comes in like say James Brown, they don't have music so the musicians could play the music and the audience wouldn't go off on 'em because it didn't sound like the record.\n\nThey came close to the record.\n\n(upbeat drumming) Earl Young is the father of disco drumming and house music drumming.\n\nHe was the house drummer for the Uptown Theater.\n\nSam Reed hired him, gave him his first job there.\n\n- Jackie Wilson was on his show, and Jackie Wilson always got his own drummer.\n\nHis drummer didn't show up and I had to play for Jackie Wilson.\n\nHe was doing \"Lonely Teardrops.\"\n\n♪ Lonely teardrops ♪ - [Earl] I played it and he came back with me, thanked me very much and said, \"Oh, you did a good job.\"\n\nGave me a little bonus for it.\n\nIf it wasn't for Sam Reed, I don't think I would be where I'm at today.\n\nWorking at the Uptown, I got to meet everybody.\n\n- Legends of mid-century American Jazz played there, Count Basie played there.\n\nArt Blakey played there.\n\nMiles Davis played there.\n\n- One Christmas show, Miles Davis was there, but he didn't stay because it was Christmas day and the audience was very small and you know, Miles didn't like anything like that.\n\nSo he left the engagement.\n\n- [Speaker] He didn't play?\n\n- Well, he played the first set, but after that he told her, \"Back up, let's get outta here.\"\n\n(upbeat music) - There were a list of established acts already playing at the Uptown and the Apollo, again, before Motown.\n\nThere is black music and black music that crosses over, but Barry Gordy really perfects that.\n\nHe's thinking about how he can create an art form that will appeal to the largest group of people.\n\n- Everybody liked Motown.\n\nMotown was the up and coming guy, the underdog, whatever you wanna call him, and black, black owned, that was all new.\n\nAnd so, you know, people played those records.\n\nWhite kids started listening to the black music instead of white music because it was more to it.\n\nThe harmonies with black roots is far superior to white.\n\nIt's not even a contest.\n\n- When Pat Boone did... ♪ Ain't that a shame ♪ And then when you hear Fats Domino... ♪ Ain't that a shame ♪ You could hear the rhythm, man.\n\nI'm a dancer so I could hear a rhythm beat, and black soul music is a part of my life.\n\nYou see, I could hear the real deal and the phony deal.\n\n(upbeat music) They played a song \"When the Lovelight Comes Shining Through His Eyes.\"\n\nThat was the first song The Supremes ever really had.\n\nAnd I busted it locally in Philly.\n\n- [Mary] We used to come to Philadelphia a lot.\n\n♪ But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes ♪ - First hit was \"Where Did Our Love Go?\"\n\nBut we had recorded like six or seven songs prior to that, and this is all while we were in high school.\n\nSo we were kind of like the local teens who were doing really good, you know?\n\nIn fact, I recall one of my teachers, Mr. Boone, saying, \"Ms. Wilson, I know you are out there singing with that little group called The Primettes, and if you wanna get outta high school, you better pass my English class.\"\n\n- Hi, this is Viani Wilson and you're listening to the Gita with the Eater and the balls with the hot sauce.\n\n- These kids, they didn't make any money with this.\n\nThey would come here and Motown taught them how to dress, how to talk, how to be interviewed.\n\nBarry Gordy came from making cars, assembly line worker.\n\nHe did the same thing with his record company.\n\nIt was brilliant what he did.\n\nBrilliant.\n\n- He just can produce act after act, and what is a place like the Uptown need, but they need a new act every week.\n\n- Martha and the Vandellas was one of my favorite groups at the Uptown.\n\nThe Supremes were okay, but Martha and the Vandellas and the Marvelettes, nobody could touch them.\n\nNot even Diana Ross, in my opinion.\n\n(Marilyn laughing) - It was 75 cents during the day, and I think it was 95 cents at night, to see 10 acts, 10 of the greatest acts you could see in the world.\n\nAnd we just did shows.\n\nWe didn't care who came.\n\n- Stage shows was a big thing back then, you know, and the slate of artists that appeared at the Uptown was amazing to me.\n\nThe joy of seeing the artists perform live and direct.\n\n♪ You know you make me wanna shout ♪ - Isley Brothers would come in and they would fly through the air and the audience would just be pumped up and ready to go.\n\n♪ Make me wanna shout ♪ - Every time they sang \"Shout\", the audience threw their hands up, jumped up and down.\n\nIt was just crazy in there.\n\n- It was like they was never gonna end it.\n\nBut I mean, we were down there screaming and hollering.\n\nIt had to be over half an hour, 45 minutes.\n\n- And it felt like the whole building was jumping up and down.\n\nIt was a completely filled audience.\n\n- Ron Isley, you know, he'd get loose, you know, opening this shirt and throwing a tie and it was just wonderful.\n\nYes, they were the greatest.\n\n♪ Now wait a minute ♪ - [Jerry] Hey, when's the next show, man?\n\n- [Georgie] June 8th, James Brown.\n\n- [Jerry] You putting me on, really?\n\n- [Georgie] I don't have to lie about nothing like James Brown.\n\nThat's my man.\n\n- [Jerry] Who else?\n\nWell with him, you don't need anybody else.\n\n- [Georgie] Well, just James, you know.\n\nJames, the man, you know.\n\nAnd he's the one.\n\nHe's the one.\n\nPapasan Mamasan.\n\n(upbeat music) - James Brown was a mainstay at the Uptown Theater.\n\nHe used to use everybody's coats in his band to do his act of please, please don't go.\n\n♪ Please ♪ - He would, \"Please, please don't go.\"\n\nThey would put the coat around him and they would console him off the stage and before he would hit the wings, he would go, \"Oh baby, no!\"\n\nAnd sling the coat off, right?\n\nThey hit the coat because the cleaning bill was too much for them.\n\nSo he developed the cape.\n\n- James Brown was on the show and a lady was having a baby, and she said on her way to the hospital to have the baby, and she stopped off, said, \"I gotta see the show at the Uptown,\" and the water broke, and that's where the baby was born, in the basement at the Uptown.\n\nShe named her Georgette because she was born here at the Uptown.\n\n- In terms of sheer energy on stage, there were two acts that I recall vividly.\n\nOne was James Brown, who truly was the hardest working man in show business.\n\nAnd if he was the hardest working man in show business, the hardest working woman was Tina Turner.\n\nBut she was absolutely a sensational raw power.\n\n- All of them were my favorite because I liked all of them.\n\nOnce they walked on this stage and I saw the audience react to them, I saw what important role they played in the production of the show.\n\n- The black male acts that were really developing, they really come out of do-op in some ways.\n\nOff the Philly Do-op scene.\n\n- Every street corner had a singing group.\n\nWe used to challenge, you know, we was kids like... ♪ Do do do do op ♪ ♪ Do do do op ♪ So we sang do-op.\n\nSo I said, \"Well look, I'm gonna put me a group together.\n\nSo I got four of my other guys and wrote a song and put a record out.\n\nThe group was called The Exceptions and the record we put out is \"Down by the Ocean.\"\n\nThere was a group called The Volcanoes.\n\nThey needed a drummer.\n\nSo I combined my drums and my singing and we joined together as a group.\n\n- Earl was the drummer.\n\nWe had the late Norman Harris.\n\nRonnie Baker helped us in the recording studio.\n\nLarry Washington, who played the percussion.\n\nMaybe two months later, this song was constantly being played and as people were walking down the street, you could hear 'em just singing part of it.\n\nSo when we did The Uptown, it was like we were part of Motown or something.\n\nThe song was so dynamic.\n\nIt's a great feeling.\n\nA feeling of accomplishment.\n\nThose were good days that'd be with me until a guy calls me home.\n\n- The Volcanoes was a group that was managed by Jimmy Bishop.\n\nHe was a DJ and he was put on shows at the Uptown, and this was his group.\n\n- You're gonna come up and see Jimmy Bishop and you're gonna give him a demo.\n\nIf he likes it, he's gonna go into the studio, record it like, yes, I'm ready.\n\n♪ I don't even know how to love you ♪ - I had written this song called \"Are You Ready?\"\n\nJimmy Bishop said, \"We need to change that to first person.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Why don't we call it, yes, I'm ready.\"\n\n♪ Yes I'm ready to learn ♪ I did not know that the song was going to become what it is today.\n\n♪ Fall in love with you ♪ I went to the Uptown when I was 18 years old.\n\nEven now, I can't tell you how it felt 'cause it was just so sudden, and it was like magical.\n\n♪ I'm glad I fell in love ♪ ♪ With you ♪ - Barbara Mason was the major star, but you had Honey and the Bees.\n\n♪ One day ♪ - Jimmy Bishop at the time had Barbara Mason.\n\nHe did not want a single female, but he was interested in a group, and he liked us and we became his group and eventually he named us Honey and the Bees.\n\nNadine fell to being Honey.\n\nGene Davis, myself and Gwendolyn Oliver comprised Honey and the Bees.\n\nEarly on, when we got a chance to play the Uptown, that's when it felt like we struck another level.\n\nWe got an encore the first time that we performed there.\n\nThat for me was like, oh my God, we are ready.\n\nWe can do this.\n\n- There were several famous kind of white acts that played the Uptown.\n\nGeorgie Woods would play The Magnificent Men on his show, and so they would show up at the Uptown, and when they would come out on stage, they would gasp a little bit.\n\nThey just didn't expect to see a white band.\n\n♪ I know it is just a matter of time ♪ ♪ I'm gonna find peace of mind ♪ - Oh yeah, we love that.\n\n- Famously at one point they are on the road and they backed James Brown.\n\nThey were an example of what Georgie Woods would name Blue Eyed Soul.\n\nHe was thinking about the Righteous Brothers when he first came up with that term.\n\nBut white acts who had a black sound to them, or at least borrowed from black musical traditions.\n\n- And you know, The Temptones, which Jimmy Bishop recorded, Darryl Hall.\n\nThen they went on to become Hall and Oates, you know, with John.\n\n- And Tuesday night was described as Temple Night.\n\nThere was really, I think, a code word that whites were welcome and invited and perhaps the most famous duo of white temple students who found their way to the Uptown are Hall and Oates.\n\n- There was this one old white man, everybody called him Pops.\n\nHe went to every show.\n\nWhen the music would come on, he would go berserk.\n\nHe would be in this chair, but he would be flailing, dancing in this chair.\n\nAnd he had a ball just enjoying the music and the young people.\n\n- On a stage with 10 other acts, and how do you get known?\n\nHow do you get remembered?\n\nAnd they know pretty early on that audiences are gonna remember the way they look and the way they dance.\n\n- You could not get on stage and just sing in the microphone.\n\nYou had to dance.\n\nIf you were boring, you would get booed off the stage.\n\nAt the end of the show, Georgie Woods would say, \"Anybody wanna dance?\n\nCome on up.\"\n\nAnd oh my goodness, the people would run, not walk, to the stage.\n\n- I used to go up and dance on the stage.\n\nWe did a dance called a slop, chicken, and we did a split.\n\nWe did a split on the stage and all that kind of stuff.\n\n- A lot of movements that the young people were doing on the stage at the Uptown were copied by the acts and then made known nationally.\n\n♪ Moving on up ♪ - [Marilyn] George Jefferson, that dance he did was the dance we performed on stage at the Uptown.\n\nGeorge Jefferson made the Philadelphia slop famous nationally.\n\n- And Georgie Woods would let many people come up there and dance because it was good, it was safe.\n\nNo violence or nothing like that.\n\nThose were some of the wonderful days there.\n\n- We have to remember that dance and music are a marriage.\n\nOne did not happen without the other.\n\nDance used to come back as an important part of our community.\n\n- [Olivia] The community was, as my mother would call it, a blue collar community.\n\n- It was a nice community.\n\nWe had all kind of businesses there.\n\nMany of them were black owned businesses like Don's Doo Shop.\n\nHe did everybody's hair.\n\nAll the entertainers came to Don's Doo Shop to get their processes done.\n\n- My mother was the cashier at the Uptown.\n\nEverybody knew that was my mother.\n\nWhen I was in school, they wanted to be my friend simply because they could get in free.\n\nThis is Ms. Evelyn Pope Turpen with Georgie Woods at the VPA Club down the street from the Uptown Theater where the entertainers would go after the show.\n\n(upbeat music) She worked her way up to the first African American female manager of the Uptown Theater.\n\n- The community is gone.\n\nHomes are no longer there.\n\nThe people have passed on.\n\nBut it's very important to keep in minds of the people what the Uptown was really about.\n\n(upbeat music continues) - [Bryant] Civil rights was a natural outgrowth, I think, for Georgie Woods.\n\n- [Marilyn] They had freedom shows where they raised money for the NACP and things like that.\n\n- They talked about Martin Luther King and Malcolm X during that time, and everyone was lordly.\n\nAnd we learned what the Civil Rights Movement was all about.\n\n- On the morning in August, 1963, before King would deliver his famous I Have a Dream speech, Georgie Woods is there with 21 buses that leave from the Uptown Theater and head south to DC for the march.\n\nIn 1964 when riots break out in North Philadelphia, Woods rushes over to the Uptown Theater to try and quell the anger in the community.\n\nIn 1965, he goes to Selma and marches with Dr. King.\n\nHe was involved in starting his own potato chip company and he saw that right as a way to make money, but also as a way to kind of recirculate money within the black community.\n\n- He was our champion, a champion for the people, which we need now.\n\n- [Bryant] And in some ways, the Uptown is destroyed by integration.\n\n- These acts that became big and bigger and bigger, all of a sudden said, \"We can go to the Latin Casino over there in Jersey and make thousands of dollars.\n\nWhy would we want to go make here a hundred dollars?\"\n\nSo that was sort of the demise of the Uptown.\n\n- It's the complicated and ironic story of how integration destroys some really fundamental black institutions, including a place like the Uptown.\n\nAnd those bands who are lower on the marquee, they don't have any places to go after places like the Uptown go out of business.\n\nIt's a kind of sad irony of a certain kind of progress.\n\n- One of the reasons why I wanted this building where I am now is because it was across the street from the Uptown Theater.\n\nAnd when I look out the window, you see the old records, you see the faces, the pictures, it brings back great memories.\n\nI saw James Brown's last concert here.\n\nI saw Billy Paul and, oh, just a array of singers.\n\n- It is so sad that most of the history is all forgotten about.\n\nI joined an organization there with Linda Richardson to try to bring the Uptown, to redo it again.\n\nWe raised a couple million dollars, but there was so much work that had to be done.\n\n- She passed away November 2nd, 2020.\n\nWe are committed to making sure that we're able to reopen the theater and just continue the vision and continue her legacy.\n\n- It's important for us to maintain structures like the Uptown, like Freedom Theater, like the anchor institutions that produce art and culture and create conviviality in neighborhoods, because people want to be able to work, play, pray, shop in their neighborhood.\n\n♪ Oh shaggy baby ♪ - [Bryant] This is a celebration of black excellence, of grace and power and beauty.\n\nThat's an important part of the story.\n\nGeorgie Woods saw himself as a person who was invested in the uplift of his community, playing black music for a black audience, but that also meant helping to create a fairer and more equal world.\n\n- This is the grand jewel of entertainment for Black America right here.\n\nStarted here in Philadelphia with the Uptown.\n\n- [Georgie] Hey Jimmy, let's get all the pretty girls together here at Uptown.\n\n- [Jimmy] Okay, Georgie.\n\nCome on.\n\n(upbeat music) ♪ I don't care ♪ ♪ To satisfy your faults ♪ ♪ Oh
