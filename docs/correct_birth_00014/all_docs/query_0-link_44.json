He has created some of the most timeless, uplifting, and quality music of all time, letting us know how to live and making our world a little bit better. \n\nStevie Wonder once said ‚ÄúJust because a man lacks the use of his eyes doesn‚Äôt mean he lacks vision.‚Äù We give honor and gratitude to an artist who has proven time and time again, through his music and his life, that he may actually possess a more elevated, enlightened vision than many in power today. \n\nLong live Stevie Wonder. üé∂\n\n‚ÄúWe all know sometimes life‚Äôs hates and troubles can make you wish you were born in another time and space. But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it‚Äôs double that God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed. So make sure when you say you‚Äôre in it, but not of it, you‚Äôre not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called hell. Change your words into truth, and then change that truth into love, and maybe our children‚Äôs grandchildren, and their great grandchildren will tell: \nI‚Äôll be loving you, until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky. \nLoving you, until the ocean covers every mountain high.\nLoving you, until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea.\nLoving you, until we dream of life and life becomes a dream. \nBe loving you, until the day is night and night becomes the day. \nLoving you, until the trees and seas just up and fly away. \nLoving you, until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4.\nLoving you, until the day that is the day that are no more. \nLoving you, until the day the earth starts turning right to left\nBe loving you, until the earth just for the sun denies itself.\nLoving you, until dear mother nature says her work is through. \nLoving you, until the day that you are me and I am you\nNow ain‚Äôt that loving you?‚Äù \n-As, by Stevie Wonder\n\nüñºÔ∏è @rhemajordanlabbe\".",
