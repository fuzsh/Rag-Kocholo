        "text": "Isn't he lovely!\n\nStevie Wonder has gone from a teenage soul prodigy, through to adventurous 70s funkateer and beyond, with pop music has massively benefitting from the colossal contributions of his music. The soul legend, who graced us with a performance at the 2023 GRAMMYs, is best known for his huge hits, 'Happy Birthday', 'Superstition' and 'Isn't She Lovely'.\n\nA hugely successful career for Stevie started before he was even a teenager, and he's subsequently become one of the most celebrated artists of modern times. A lyrical genius, smooth vocals and incredible musicianship, his songs have become classics - and rightly so!\n\nWith a colourful personal life and a legendary career, Stevie Wonder has lived a life of only one in a million, and his personal experiences have provided the inspiration of some of the most beautiful and loved songs in the world.\n\nWe've got the low down on everything from how Stevie Wonder's career started to the loves of his life. Read on to find out about the man behind the music...\n\nWho is Stevie Wonder?\n\nPut simply, Stevie Wonder is one the most important figures in music, not just in R & B but also pop music in its broadest sense. Be it his earliest forays with Motown, his pioneering 70s output, or the pop music that followed, Stevie Wonder’s songs are characterised by an unmistakable sense of joy and positivity, even when tackling serious social and racial issues.\n\nStevie Wonder's real name\n\nStevie Wonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins.\n\nHas Stevie Wonder always been blind?\n\nBorn six weeks premature, it’s been speculated that his blindness was caused by excessive oxygen exposure when he was placed in an incubator. It was complications due to this that mean he's been blind from his very early days. Stevie has retinopathy of prematurity which is a condition that causes the retinas to detach and ultimately leave the person blind.\n\nHow old is Stevie Wonder?\n\nBorn on 13th May 1950, Stevie Wonder is currently 74-years-old.\n\nWhere was Stevie Wonder born?\n\nStevie Wonder was born in Saginaw, Michigan in the United States and moved to Detroit when his parents divorced. Stevie grew up in Detroit and later went to the Michigan School for the Blind.\n\nStevie Wonder's parents\n\nIt was perhaps always sure Stevie would be a musician. Stevie's father was called Calvin Judkins but it was his mother, Lula Mae Hardaway, who was a singer/songwriter and encouraged her son to sing in the local choir and to play instruments like the piano, harmonica and the drums.\n\nStevie's piano talents\n\nFrom a young age, Stevie Wonder played a number of instruments including the piano. As a result, Stevie has been hailed one of the most talented piano performers of all time and songs like 'I Wish' and 'Higher Ground' have become firm favourites amongst a mature piano players when they fancy giving the keys a little tinkle.\n\nWhat was Stevie's first song?\n\nWhile he's known for 'Happy Birthday' and 'Superstition' most, Stevie Wonder was a child star and was known as Little Stevie Wonder back then. Stevie Wonder's first song was called 'I Call It Pretty Music But The Old People Call It The Blues- Part 1' and was released in 1962.\n\nThe following year, in 1963, Stevie Wonder would get his first Number 1 with the track 'Fingertips - Part 1'.\n\nAs a young child, he began to sing in his church’s choir and by the age of nine he’d learnt how to play piano, drums and harmonica. He was discovered by Motown two years later, re-named Little Stevie Wonder and released his first two albums, ‘A Tribute To Uncle Ray’ and ‘The Jazz Soul Of Little Stevie’ at the age of 12.\n\nHis breakthrough came with the 1963 live album, ‘The 12 Year Old Genius’. Featuring the utterly astonishing single, ‘Fingertips’, it topped the US singles chart. Stevie went on to score more hits in the 60s, including ‘Uptight (Everything’s Alright)’ and ‘Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours’ as well as co-writing hits such as Smokey Robinson And The Miracles’ ‘Tears Of A Clown’.\n\nAre Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles related?\n\nThey're not, although Little Stevie Wonder's second studio album is called 'Tribute To Uncle Ray' which was a plot by Stevie's management to associate him with the success of fellow blind African American artist Ray Charles.\n\nLISTEN: To Stevie Wonder sing 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours':\n\nWas Stevie Wonder successful in the 70s?\n\nThe early 70s saw Stevie Wonder take greater control over his work and music. No longer content with simply being a singles artist whose albums contained B-sides and filler, he held out for a more favourable contract with Motown. Once secured, Stevie Wonder truly bloomed as a singer, songwriter, musician and producer.\n\nThough 1972’s ‘Music Of My Mind’ wasn’t a huge commercial success, it found Stevie Wonder forging ahead in a new direction with his pioneering synthesiser work. This coalesced with ‘Talking Book’, released later the same year, which contained the smash hits ‘Superstition’ and ‘You Are The Sunshine Of My Life’. Touring with The Rolling Stones also ensured that his music reached a wider audience.\n\nLISTEN: Stevie Wonder's brilliant song 'Superstition':\n\nHis next album, ‘Innervisions’, took things even further. Released in 1973, it housed the hits ‘Higher Ground’, ‘Living For The City’ and ‘Don’t You Worry ‘Bout A Thing’, as well as the ballad ‘Golden Lady’. It would win the GRAMMY Award for Album Of The Year.\n\n1974 saw the release of ‘Fulfillingness’ First Finale’ and more hits in the shape of ‘ You Haven’t Done Nothin’’ and ‘Boogie On Reggae Woman’.\n\nThe landmark album ‘Songs In The Key Of Life’ followed in 1977 and the singles ‘Isn’t She Lovely’ and ‘Sir Duke’ were instant classics that still resonate to this very day.\n\nWas Stevie Wonder successful in the 80s?\n\nWhile the new decade found Stevie Wonder moving into a more pop-orientated direction with hits such as ‘Master Blaster (Jammin’)’ and the ballad ‘Lately’, 1981’s ‘Happy Birthday’ was instrumental in the successful campaign to have the birthday of civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr, become a national holiday. You can find these tracks on the ‘Hotter Than July’ album.\n\nLISTEN: To Stevie Wonder sing 'Lately':\n\nMarch 2023 marked 42-years since the release of 'Lately', with many fans of the singer celebrating the anniversary. One wrote: 42 years ago today (March 13, 1981), Stevie’s “Lately” was released as the third single off Hotter Than July.\n\n'The song is one of the most beautiful ballads ever written by Stevie Wonder. It tells the story of a love he feels dying but just wishes his premonitions miss.'\n\nThe mid-1980s saw Stevie Wonder hit his commercial zenith. The single, ‘I Just Called To Say I Love You’, was lifted from the romcom, The Woman In Red, and became his biggest hit as it climbed to the top slot all over the world.\n\nStevie Wonder's biggest songs\n\nWith such a long career in music, there are a ton of Stevie Wonder songs out there. Popular early days tracks like 'Uptight (Everything's Alright)' and 'Blowin' In The Wind' are considered to be the talent of someone far older than Little Stevie Wonder actually was.\n\nIn 1968, Stevie Wonder released 'For Once In My Life' which has become a worldwide favourite and 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours' followed in 1970. Classics such as 'Superstition' and 'Sir Duke' also came along in the 70s and the 80s saw 'Master Blaster', 'Happy Birthday' and 'Go Home'.\n\nStevie Wonder's songs have been the background music to so many special moments in people's lives that, ultimately, the best Stevie Wonder song is down to you.\n\nTake a look through some of Stevie Wonder's best songs:\n\nWho is Stevie Wonder's drummer?\n\nStanley Randolph is the drummer for Stevie Wonder, also playing for the likes of The Jacksons, Christina Aguilera, and TLC.\n\nHas Stevie Wonder done any collaborations?\n\nGiven his own prodigious output, you’d think he might have wanted a break from time to time, but Stevie Wonder has worked with a whole host of the great and the good from Planet Pop.\n\nHe’s contributed harmonica playing to Chaka Khan’s cover of Prince’s ‘I Feel For You’, Eurythmics’ ‘There Must Be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)’ and Elton John’s ‘I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues’, as well as John Denver’s ‘If Ever’ and Barbra Streisand’s ‘Can’t Help Lovin’ That Man’.\n\nAnd let’s not forget ‘Ebony And Ivory’, his 1982 Number 1 with Paul McCartney.
