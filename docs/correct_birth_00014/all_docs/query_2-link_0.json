        "text": "Singer, songwriter, producer, musician, activist and humanitarian, Stevie Wonder has excelled in a wealth of endeavors, making him one of Detroit's most accomplished and multi-faceted artists. He was born Steveland Hardaway Judkins (his surname later changed to Morris when his mother married) on May 13, 1950 in Saginaw, Michigan. Wonder was blind from birth, but didn't let that stop him from learning how to play a variety of instruments, including keyboards, harmonica and drums, or from singing and writing songs.\n\nHis family moved to Detroit in 1954, and Wonder was discovered by the Miracles' Ronnie White, who arranged an audition with Motownâ€™s Berry Gordy, Jr. Re-christened Little Stevie Wonder, he released his first album, A Tribute to Uncle Ray, in 1962 and topped the Billboard Pop and R&B charts the following year with \"Fingertips -- Pt. 2.\" There was nothing little about Wonder's artistry. He's been a one-man hit factory, scoring chart singles in each of five decades, including number one hits \"Superstition,\" \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life,\" \"I Wish,\" \"Sir Duke\" and \"I Just Called to Say I Love You,\" and winning 25 Grammy Awards, including one for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nWhen he turned 21, Wonder became one of Motown's first artists to take creative control over his career, which led to celebrated albums like Talking Book, Innervisions, and Songs in the Key of Life. In 2005 Wonder released his first new album in 10 years, A Time to Love, which he celebrated with a pre-game performance for Super Bowl XL at Detroit's Ford Field.\n\nWonder has enhanced his legend with tireless social action. He's been an integral contributor to campaigns to battle racism, South African apartheid, AIDS, nuclear power proliferation, drug abuse and drunk driving. He's worked on behalf of the homeless as well as blind and disabled children, and appeared at the 2005 Live 8 concert to raise awareness of global poverty.\n\nWonder was also one of the leaders of the successful effort to turn Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday into a national holiday. The United Nations named him a UN Messenger of Peace in 2009.\n\nRELATED ITEMS IN THE COLLECTION"
