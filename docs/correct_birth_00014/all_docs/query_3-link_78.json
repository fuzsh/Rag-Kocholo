        "text": "He was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins on May 13 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan, but known to the world by the stage name of Stevie Wonder.\n\nAs Little Stevie matured, so did his subject matter, and Stevie Wonder's songwriting began to reflect what was happening in America socially.\n\nStevie Wonder has also taken on political causes, including his work as an activist in 1980 to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a holiday in the United States. In 2009, Stevie Wonder was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. In 2013, Billboard magazine released a list of Billboard Hot 100 all-time top artists to celebrate the U.S. singles chart's 55th anniversary, Stevie Wonder at number six on that list. He's recorded more than 30 US Top 10 hits, received 25 Grammy awards, and has sold over 100 million records worldwide.\n\nStevie Wonder: a legend, an icon."
