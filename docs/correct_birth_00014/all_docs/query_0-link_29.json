        "text": "Career\n\nA friend introduced Stevie to Berry Gordy, Jr., president of Motown Records. Gordy recognized Stevie’s exceptional talent and signed him to Motown in 1961, when Stevie was 11 years old. Gordy gave him the stage name Little Stevie Wonder. Success came quickly, as Wonder’s single “Fingertips (Part 2)” hit number one in the United States on both the pop and rhythm and blues charts in 1963. Shortly afterward, Wonder dropped “Little” from his name. By the time he was 18 years old, he had released enough hits—including “Uptight (Everything’s Alright),” “Nothing’s Too Good for My Baby,” “I Was Made to Love Her,” and “For Once in My Life”—to fill his first Greatest Hits album, in 1968. He followed that up with more hits, including “My Cherie Amour” (1969) and “Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours” (1970).\n\nIn 1971, at age 21, Wonder took some of his Motown earnings and started Black Bull Music, a music publishing company that would give him more creative freedom than he had with Motown. He used two albums that he recorded independently as leverage in negotiations with Motown. Motown subsequently offered him a more open contract that gave him complete artistic control over his music.\n\nWonder had begun experimenting with new musical forms, particularly through his innovative use of the synthesizer, when a serious automobile accident in 1973 almost claimed his life. Despite the personal difficulties it posed, this period yielded some of Wonder’s most notable albums. They include Talking Book (1972), Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness’ First Finale (1974), and Songs in the Key of Life (1976). Hit songs from the albums include “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” “Superstition,” “Higher Ground,” “Boogie on Reggae Woman,” and “Sir Duke.”"
