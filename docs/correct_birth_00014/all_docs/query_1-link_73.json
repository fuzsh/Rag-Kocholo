        "text": "A musical prodigy, Stevie Wonder began playing piano at the age of 4. By the age of 8 he was a skilled musician. At the age of 11 he signed his first recording contract with Motown Records’ “Tamla” label. His first hit was “Fingertips” recorded live at the Regal Theater in Chicago when he was 12. While it was primarily an instrumental piece, it gave the world a glimpse of the musical genius of “Little” Stevie Wonder and a taste of the brilliance to come.\n\nIn his early years, Stevie Wonder was influenced by many big names in the music industry including Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, Jackie Wilson, and King Curtis. Perhaps the one person who had the most profound impact on him was Marvin Gaye. At Gaye’s funeral Wonder remarked, “Marvin was the person who encouraged me that the music I had within me, I must feel free to let [it] come out”.\n\nA prolific songwriter, Stevie Wonder wrote or co-wrote songs for some of music’s most popular artists - a veritable Who’s Who from Motown and beyond; The Supremes, the Marvelettes, Brenda Holloway, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, the Four Tops, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, The Temptations, Ramsey Lewis, the Spinners, Syreeta, LaBelle, Rufus, Minnie Riperton, Roberta Flack, The Pointer Sisters, James Taylor, Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones. The list goes on and on. In 1983 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nAt the age of 21, with support from Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder gained complete creative control over his music. From 1971 - 1976 he entered into what is widely recognized as his “classic period”. In that 5 year span he released five albums - “Music of My Mind”, “Talking Book”, “Innervisions”, “Fulfillingess’ First Finale”, and “Songs in the Key of Life”. (Stevie Wonder’s Classic Period). Rolling Stone Record Guide magazine said his albums “pioneered stylistic approaches that helped determine the shape of pop music for the next decade”. Classic Stevie Wonder songs are sampled today in everything from hip-hip to rap to R&B. Through collaboration, mentoring, or inspiration, Stevie Wonder has had an influence on musicians from the 70s onward. Drake, Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, Janelle Monet, Erykah Badu, Lauren Hill, Tupac, Common, Musiq Soulchild, John Legend, Michael Jackson and Snoop Dogg are just a few.\n\nStevie Wonder’s impact on American music extended far beyond his influence as a singer and songwriter. During the 1970s he was at the forefront of embracing new technologies in music pioneering the use of synthesizers, drum machines, and sampling. His nature documentary soundtrack “Steve Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants” was one of the earliest digital recordings ever released. His use of technology changed the conventions of R&B, and his critical and commercial success and advocacy for the use of technology played a leading role in changing attitudes about the use of electronic music."
