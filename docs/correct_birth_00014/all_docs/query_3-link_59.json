Even Young Boys Incorporated had territory in the Jects. \n\nIf you are going to Afro Nation Detroit this weekend, the Afrobeats festival will be held on the grounds of the former Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects. \n\nI guess they are calling it “Bedrock’s Douglass site” since Dan G owns it. Nasty work. \n\nBut, the Brewsters were the first public housing project in America built specifically for Black people, in the 1930s. \n\nTownhomes were built first along Mack Ave. and then the towers or “14s” went up in the 1950s along I-75. The towers were officially called the Frederick Douglass Apartments and were 14 stories tall.\n\nThose were demolished a decade ago, but a page called @thebrewstersprojects76 was curated to showcase Black life in the Projects in the 1970s. \n\nGive it a follow and remember the history and culture of the Brewster Projects and its Black residents.\n\n#BlackDetroiters #BlackDetroit #Detroit #BrewsterProjects #AfroNation #AfroBeats\".",
