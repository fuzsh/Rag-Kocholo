        "text": "Today, Detroit music legend Stevie Wonder turns 61-years-old. He's responsible for writing and singing some of the best soul songs of all time and has been a fixture in Detroit's musical DNA since he was just a kid recording tunes for the Motown corporation.\n\nThere's no shortage of career highlights under his belt. For starters, considering that he's been a child star ever since he released The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie back in 1962, the man born Stevland Hardaway Judkins is on the verge of celebrating his 50th year as a pop icon next year. It's not easy for anyone to spend 50 years in the music industry but our hometown man has remained a class act the entire time. He's written immaculate albums throughout his career, some of them like Hotter Than July, Innervisions, and Songs in the Key of Life, often considered some of the best records ever created. There's no debating Wonder's genius or the fact that Detroit owes a portion of it's stellar music reputation to his repertoire.\n\nThis city and state has always been stacked with top-notch music talent and it's beyond difficult to argue who the best local musician of all time is. So let's not waste time going down that road. That's another blog post all together. But if somebody did want to start the argument, I think it's without question that Stevie Wonder is in the top 3. Happy Birthday Little Stevie! One of Michigan's finest is 61-years-young today.\n\nAlso, check out a playlist that Houston Press writer Craig Hlavaty put together as a sort of audible cliff notes session for anyone trying to figure out which Stevie Wonder songs they should dive into first."
