        "text": "\"Do you know, it's funny,\" Wonder told The Guardian, \"but I never thought of being blind as a disadvantage, and I never thought of being black as a disadvantage. I am what I am. I love me! And I don't mean that egotistically - I love that God has allowed me to take whatever it was that I had and to make something out of it.\"Â\n\nStevie Wonder, a star is born\n\nWonder showed an early gift for music, singing in the Whitestone Baptist Church choir and learning to play the piano, harmonica, and drums. He partnered with a friend and performed on street corners and at parties and dances.\n\nA school friend, Gerald White, brought his brother, Ronnie White of The Miracles, to check out Stevlandâs talent when the singer was just 11 years old. White was instantly impressed, and took Stevland to meet Berry Gordy, who signed him to Motown's Tamla label under the name Little Stevie Wonder - the rest is musical history.\n\nGordy placed the young singerâs career in the hands of his associate, Clarence Paul, Stevie's designated mentor. Paul, who also produced early Temptations records, co-wrote Wonder's first hit song, Fingertips (1963).\n\nMeeting Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAs a young teenager, Wonder performed with the Motown Revue in Alabama. It was the first time heâd experienced segregation. He later recalled someone shooting at the musiciansâ tour bus, just barely missing the gas tank.Â\n\nAt 15, Wonder attended a Chicago Freedom Movement rally where he met the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., his hero. Kingâs speech on the Montgomery Bus Boycott - an African American protest against segregated seating - had stuck with Wonder since the age of five: âI asked, âWhy donât they like colored people? Whatâs the difference? I still canât see the difference. Want to know why? Because there is no difference.â\n\nOn the evening of 4 April 1968, Wonder was on his way back to Detroit from the Michigan School for the Blind when the news broke on the radio that King had been assassinated in Memphis. His driver immediately switched off the radio and they traveled the rest of the way home in shock and silence.\n\nMourning Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nFive days later, Wonder flew to Atlanta to join thousands mourning the loss of the civil rights hero. At the funeral, Wonder was joined by African-American Congressman John Conyers, who had just submitted a bill to make Kingâs birthday a national holiday but the measure failed to gain popular support. The idea ignited a crusade to commemorate the slain civil rights icon, however, a movement spearheaded by Wonder and some of the biggest names in music including Bob Marley and Michael Jackson.\n\nTo fight the pushback from conservative politicians, Wonder put his musical career on hold and led rallies from coast to coast, galvanizing millions of Americans with his passion and lobbying Congress to pass the bill. Wonder had a vision for a national day of love, peace and unity.Â\n\nHappy Birthday\n\nIn 1980, Wonder recorded and released Happy Birthday as an ode to King and called to make MLK Day an official federal holiday. The song - now lovingly known to African Americans as the âblack versionâ of the traditional song - was included on the album Hotter Than July, which also featured a large photo of King with a call to endorse the holiday: âWe still have a long road to travel until we reach the world that was his dream. We in the United States must not forget either his supreme sacrifice or that dream.â\n\nâ\n\nStevie Wonder: Superstar\n\nThe glorious anthem, characterized by Wonderâs unmistakable sense of joy and positivity, went on to become one of his biggest hits and the soundtrack behind his journey to make MLK Day a reality. Following an incredibly successful tour with Bob Marley, where Wonder would close each show by leading the audience in singing Happy Birthday, the cause for MLK was revived.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan was preparing for his presidential inauguration in 1981, 100,000 people rallied in Washington DC for MLK Day. Coretta Scott King and Wonder both gave testimonies and the bill was finally passed 78 to 22; MLK Day was signed into law in November 1983 and has been officially observed on the third Monday of January every year since 1986. All 50 states had recognized MLK Day by 2000.\n\nA lifetime of philanthropy\n\nWonder considers his contribution to creating MLK Day one of his proudest achievements - more so, even, than his incredible 25 Grammy awards. But this is not the only time in American history when Wonderâs impact was felt by everyone around him and beyond.\n\nIn 1985, Wonder was part of the supergroup USA for Africa that recorded the all-star charity single We Are the World, which helped to raise more than $63m for humanitarian aid in Africa famine relief - and itâs still earning money today. In the same year, he participated in another charity single, Thatâs What Friends Are For, to raise money for the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR).\n\nÂ\n\nStevie Wonder's arrest\n\nWonder was a political lightning rod throughout the 80s. He won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1984 for I Just Called to Say I Love You from The Woman in Red and dedicated the award to Nelson Mandela, who remained imprisoned at Pollsmoor Prison. This resulted in his music being banned by the South African government.\n\nThe following year, Wonder was arrested along with a group of anti-apartheid protestors outside the South African Embassy during demonstrations, stating he was âa conscientious criminal for world equalityâ. Wonder also hired exiled South African musicians to play on the song Itâs Wrong (Apartheid) for his album In Square Circle.\n\nOn top of fundraising for children with visual impairments and disabilities, Wonder served on the President's Committee for charities such as Employment of People with Disabilities, the Childrenâs Diabetes Foundation, and Junior Blind of America. His Wonder Vision Awards Program has a mission to help integrate blind and low-vision people into the workforce. For over two decades, Wonderâs annual House Full of Toys Benefit Concert has been providing toys and gifts to children, people with disabilities, and families in need.\n\nShelter in the Rain"
