        "text": "Born Steveland Judkins Morris in 1950 in Saginaw, Michigan, and blind from birth, Wonder learned piano at age seven and by age nine also played drums and harmonica. In 1954 his family moved to Detroit, where he sang in the church choir and developed an affinity for R&B, particularly Ray Charles and Sam Cooke. He signed with Motown records in 1961 as \"Little Stevie Wonder\" and was marketed as a young \"genius,\" especially after his first hit album in 1963. Like other Motown artists, Wonder's earliest recordings were strictly supervised, allowing little artistic freedom, but resulting in a string of Top 40 hits.\n\nIn 1971, when Wonder reached the legal age of 21 and his contract expired, he financed his own albums so he could maintain artistic control. He began to address the social issues that he cared about. His songs, like much of African American music after the mid-1960s, became more political as they reflected and commented on the charged atmosphere in African American communities and the sometimes-strained relationship between Blacks and whites.\n\n\"Living for the City\" is one of his most poignant songs, dealing with the struggles of a young Black male in New York City. The leading motivation of the Great Migration of the 1910sâ€“1940s was to escape the hard times in the rural south and seek better opportunities in the northern cities, yet many Blacks found that urban life did not fulfill expectations, as related in this song.\n\nAlthough Wonder's productivity declined after 1976, he continues to collaborate with a diverse group of popular musicians, especially in support of social efforts."
