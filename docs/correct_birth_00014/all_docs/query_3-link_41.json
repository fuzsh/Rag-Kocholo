        "text": "Stevie Wonder is one of the most influential Michigan musicians of all time. His illustrious career has spanned over 50 years and counting. He has won 25 Grammys, been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, and received countless other awards. Stevie is a rare case where the accolades, numerous as they are, don’t do justice to what Wonder has done in his life.\n\nWonder’s Michigan roots run deep throughout the state. Born in Saginaw in 1950, Wonder’s journey into music began before he reached the age of five. Stevie Wonder moved with his family to Detroit and lived there for a good portion of his early childhood. Stevie’s talents continued to grow and he signed a deal with Motown Records at the age of eleven. Around the same time, Stevie began attending the Michigan School for the blind in Lansing to study classical piano. Right here in Lansing is where he wrote the classic track My Cherie Amour . As his career began to blossom his influence grew, and the Saginaw native used his new platform to speak out on cultural issues and call for social reform. It goes without saying that Stevie and his Motown sound changed the landscape of music forever. His impact act as an activist has been equally profound and has just as much to do with his upbringing in Michigan as his funk-filled grooves. With the recent unveiling of an 1100 square foot mural on the side of Detroit’s Music Hall Center for the performing arts that was done to commemorate the artist, now is a great time to look back on the legacy of Stevie Wonder.\n\nThe timing of Stevie Wonder’s meteoric rise to fame coincided with the civil rights movement of the 60’s and 70’s. Stevie was an outspoken advocate for the black community and spread his message through his music time and time again. Some of his most notable songs of this sort include Living For the City, You Haven’t Done Nothing, He’s Misstra Know- It-All, and Happy Birthday. The song Happy Birthday was used in the campaign to make Martin Luther King’s birthday a national holiday. Wonder spearheaded this movement with relentless campaigning and eventually in 1983, his goal was achieved with the passing of the Martin Luther King Day bill.\n\nStevie was also heavily involved in other humanitarian causes that include the fights against AIDS, drunk driving, poverty, and apartheid. Stevie’s support of Nelson Mandela resulted in the musician’s music receiving a broadcast ban in 1985 from the South African government. In retaliation he recorded and released a song featuring South African musicians called It’s Wrong(Apartheid).\n\nStevie Wonder’s pursuit of justice and equality has been relentless and all-encompassing. A trailblazer in music and morality, Stevie wonder has undoubtedly left his mark on the world, but what of the cities and state that raised him? Stevie’s legacy in Michigan has been cemented in Saginaw at the Juneteenth memorial site. As for Lansing, Michigan School of the blind closed in 1995 and moved to Flint. The building was re-purposed for housing in 2016. In Detroit, a mural dedicated to Wonder has just been completed and serves as a reminder of the artist and his accomplishments. Although his physical footprints in Michigan have been mostly faded by the waves of time, Little Stevie Wonder from Saginaw has made a lasting impact on the hearts and minds of millions across the world."
