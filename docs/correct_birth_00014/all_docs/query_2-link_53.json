        "text": "1960s\n\nIn 1961, when Stevie was just 11 years old, Berry Gordy, Jr., president of the Motown recording company, signed Stevie to the label. Gordy gave him the stage name Little Stevie Wonder. (Wonder dropped “Little” from his name in 1964.) Wonder’s third single, “Fingertips, Part 2,” hit number one in the United States in 1963. By the time he was 18, Wonder had released a number of hits, including “Uptight (Everything’s Alright),” “Nothing’s Too Good for My Baby,” “I Was Made to Love Her,” and “For Once in My Life.” His career up to that point was enough to fill his first Greatest Hits album in 1968. Wonder followed that up with more hits, including the platinum-selling “My Cherie Amour” (1969) and “Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours” (1970).\n\n1970s\n\nIn 1971, Wonder started Black Bull Music, a music publishing company, so he could have more creative freedom than he had with Motown. The move eventually forced Motown to give Wonder complete artistic control over his music. Wonder produced some of his most notable albums during this period: Innervisions (1973), which featured “Higher Ground,” Fulfillingness’ First Finale (1974), which included “Boogie on Reggae Woman,” and Songs in the Key of Life (1976), which included “Sir Duke.”\n\n1980s and beyond"
