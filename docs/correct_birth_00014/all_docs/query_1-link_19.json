A prominent figure in popular music during the second half of the 20th century, Wonder is one of the most successful songwriters and musicians. A virtual one-man band, his use of synthesizers and further electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&B. He also helped drive the genre into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive, consistent socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Wonder is often hailed as a “genius”, and has been credited as a pioneer and influence to musicians of various genres including rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz.\n\nHappy Birthday Stevie Wonder!!!\n\nwith @rockhistation #quality\n\n#rockhistation #GeorgeHarrison #vinylcollector #RingoStarr #paulmccartney #legends #legendary #guitarists #guitargod #guitarhero #johnlennon #StevieWonder #guitarist #guitarplayer #Beatles #TheBeatles #EricClapton #guitarsolo #electricguitar #drums #thedoors #gibson #lespaul #guitars #gibsonlespaul #guitarcenter #classicrock #rockmusic #royalalberthall @thebeatles @georgeharrisonofficial @johnlennon @ringostarrmusic @paulmccartney\n\n(tag the friends you want to listen with and comment below!)\n\nvia: @ucoofficial @rockhistation\".",
