He was portrayed by T-Pain.\n\nInformation on the rapper\n\nStevland Hardaway Morris, better known by his stage name, Stevie Wonder, was born under the name Stevland Hardaway Judkins on May 13th, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan. He is a blind singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, who is considered one of the most critically and commercially successful musical performers of the late 20th century.\n\nWonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, and he would continue performing and recording for Motown until 2020, when he began to release music under his own vanity label, So What the Fuss Records. Some of Wonder's best-selling songs include \"Superstition\", \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\", \"Higher Ground\", \"Boogie on Reggae Woman\", \"Sir Duke\", and \"I Wish\". Another of his hits, the 1981 single \"Happy Birthday\", helped popularize the successful campaign to make Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday a national holiday.\n\nWonder has recorded more than 30 U.S. top ten hits, received 25 Grammy Awards, and sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the most-awarded male solo artists and one of the top 60 best-selling music artists.\n\nLyrics\n\nVerse 1:\n\nI feel like this is the beginning, (ohhh!)\n\nBut you have sucked for a few thousand years!\n\n(Hey!) I'm a man who comes from a higher ground,\n\n(Hoo!) And I say DC is a whole step down!\n\nI've been spitting out hits since both Fingertips,\n\nSo use the tip of your fingers and read my lips!\n\nHow you gonna talk about a bat being blind? (Why?)\n\nYou need to echo-relocate to the 4th of July\n\nBecause you're Ms. Independent, or at least you try,\n\nBut your first story is you, running off with a guy!\n\n(Okay!) Now let me tell the truth 'cause I know you got the lasso!\n\nYou got that wack flow! Suffering Sappho!\n\nI'm the ceremony master blaster with the bars,\n\nAnd I got more Grammys than your panties got stars!\n\nVerse 2:\n\nYour ignorant questions could never cause as much pain\n\nAs never knowing how stupid you look in your airplane!\n\nYou're a misguided, C-minus-on-the-Bechdel test joke,\n\nAnd my worst song is better than your best TV show!\n\nVerse 3:\n\nYou couldn't walk in my shoes, so stick to your re-boots,\n\nWith plots so thin even I can see through!\n\nIt's not a superstition; I believe you got dissed!\n\nNot even your tiara's coming back from this! (Yeah! Haha!)\n\nScrapped lyrics and lyric ideas\n\nI'm a D, you're a C, you're a whole step down!\n\nYou got the stars and the stripes all up in your tailpiece!\n\nYou look bad; that's what the Superman tells me!\n\nI stick to the truth 'cause I know you got the lasso!\n\nI'm the ceremony master blaster with the rhymes,\n\nAnd they're sealed and signed and delivered on time!\n\nBechdel test (You're gonna fail - you couldn't? pass?)\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nDouble D's under your double W's\n\nPlane? To me, E'THING is invisible!\n\nLass with a lasso\n\nThe wonder twins in your wonder bra\n\n…you can't spot, like a cheetah\n\nA whole step down from me: D.C.\n\nTrivia\n\nTwo previews of Wonder were shown during the end slate of Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe is the first rapper to have two previews in one battle.\n\nHe is the first blind rapper to appear in an ERB.\n\nHe is the sixth rapper overall with a physical disability, after Darth Vader, Ludwig van Beethoven, Stephen Hawking, Doctor Seuss, and Muhammad Ali.\n\nHe was originally going to battle Ray Charles, but the idea was scrapped.\n\nHe closes his last verse by laughing with an autotune effect, a nod to his actor, T-Pain, who commonly employs the same effect to his own music.\n\nThis makes him the third character to be given an autotune effect, after Stephen Hawking and Stedman Graham.\n\nIf Neil deGrasse Tyson's autotuned demo recording is included, Wonder would be the fourth character to be given an autotuned effect.\n\nGallery"
