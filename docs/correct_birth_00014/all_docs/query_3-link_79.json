        "text": "This Day In History: May 13th\n\nWith more than two dozen Grammy awards to his name and over 20 studio albums, it is no surprise that Stevie Wonder is a revered figure in the music industry. He burst onto the scene during the early part of the 1960s and has managed to enjoy a career that spans more than six decades. Here are five things to know about the legendary Stevie Wonder!\n\nThe Origin Story Of Stevie Wonder. Stevland Hardaway Judkins was born on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan. Judkins was born prematurely and suffered from an eye disorder which was made worse when he received too much oxygen in an incubator. This led to blindness from an early age, but it did not inhibit his music abilities. By the age of 10, Judkins was a self-taught Drummer, pianist and harmonica player.\n\nYoungest Artist To Top Billboard Charts. Some of his first productions such as “The Jazz Soul Of Little Stevie” (1962) and “The 12 Year Old Genius Live” were an early foreshadowing of Wonder’s future success. He was signed to Motown Records in 1961 at the age of 11. It didn’t take long for the young performer to gain national attention. In 1963, he became the youngest artist to top Billboard charts with his song “Fingertips.” Wonder followed up by releasing songs such as “Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day” and “You Met Your Match,” and “Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday.” Throughout his career, Wonder has continued to be a fan-favorite. Some of his biggest hits include, “Superstition,” “Living for the City,” and “I Just Called to Say I Love You.”\n\nNo Stranger To Humanitarian Efforts. Despite having a net worth of more than $100 million, Wonder is not out of touch with the harsh realities that some people may go through. He has written and performed songs to help support charities that address disabilities, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, hunger and homelessness, domestic abuse and more. Wonder even led a campaign to make Martin Luther King Day a national holiday. His humanitarian efforts have been recognized by several agencies including the United Nations. In 2009 he was designated as a ‘Messenger of Peace’ with a focus on persons with disabilities.\n\nSo What The Fuss Records. After spending almost 60 years recording with Berry Gordy at Motown Records, the music legend decided to start his own label. In 2020, Wonder launched So What The Fuss Music at the age of 70. He partnered with Republic Records (an offshoot of Universal Music Group) when launching the label. The label debuted with two songs, “Can’t Put It in The Hands of Fate” features Busta Rhymes, Rapsody, Cordae, and Chika as well as “Where Is Our Love Song.” The philanthropist donated proceeds from the singles to Feeding America.\n\nAwards And Accolades. As a reflection of his extensive career, Wonder has amassed a wide array of awards and honors. The Motown star has earned 25 Grammys alone and several Lifetime Achievement Awards (Songwriters Hall Of Fame, Billboard Century Award, City of Detroit, etc). Wonder has garnered other accolades including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Hall of Fame inductions (Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, NAACP, The Apollo Theater, etc) and honorary degrees from colleges such as Yale, Oberlin and Tulane University.\n\nShayla Farrow\n\nShayla Farrow is a multimedia journalist with a Media, Journalism and Film Communications degree from Howard University and a master’s degree in management from Wake Forest University. Shayla discovered her passion for journalism while working as a reporter with Spotlight Network at Howard University. She worked with other campus media, including NewsVision, WHBC 96.3 HD3, WHUR-FM, 101 Magazine, and the HU News Service. Her reporting abilities earned her opportunities to interview industry professionals including Cathy Hughes, movie director Malcolm D. Lee and creator of “David Makes Man,” Tarell Alvin McCraney. Shayla intends to leave her mark in journalism by broadcasting radio and television shows that cover a wide array of topics ranging from politics and social justice issues to entertainment and pop culture. She has worked on a variety of shows, including the Wendy Williams Show, The Joe Madison Show, and The Karen Hunter Show as well as worked as a producer for the NBC News Channel. However, her ultimate career goal is to own a television and audio entertainment platform that provides quality content to viewing and listening audiences."
