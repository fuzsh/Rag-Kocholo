        "text": "Over 30 Benton Harbor youth and a dozen chaperones probably could not sleep -- anticipating meeting legendary American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, and former child prodigy, who became one of the most creative musical figures in the world -- Stevie Wonder.\n\nLast Saturday, their dream became a reality, as they meet, spoke with, and sung for Wonder during a trip to �Songs In The Key of Life� Tour in Indianapolis, IN. The trip was made possible by I�m Saving Myself and Benton Harbor Area Schools.\n\nWonder was born Steveland Hardaway Judkins on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan. He became blind as a result of receiving too much oxygen in the incubator as a premature baby.\n\nWonder showed an early gift for music, first with a church choir in Detroit, Michigan, where he and his family had moved to when he was 4 years old, and later with a bevy of instruments, including the harmonica, piano and drums, all of which he taught himself before age 10. Wonder signed with Motown�s Tamla label at the age of 11.\n\nHe has recorded more than 30 U.S. top ten hits and received 25 Grammy Awards, the most ever awarded to a male solo artist, and has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the top 60 best-selling music artists. Wonder is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King, Jr.�s birthday a holiday in the United States. In 2009, Wonder was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.\n\n.CLICK HERE for more -- including photos.\n\n� Benton-Michiana Spirit News"
