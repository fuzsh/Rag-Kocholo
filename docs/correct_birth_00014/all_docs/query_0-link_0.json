        "text": "SAGINAW — People may know something about Saginaw native Stevie Wonder, the blind pop-music icon born as Steveland Hardaway Judkins in 1950 at Saginaw’s St. Mary’s Hospital.\n\nThey may know how his harmonica playing at age 10 got him an audience with Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr. and launched his brilliant music career.\n\nToday in Saginaw, though, there’s another story being written about the singer.\n\nIt involves the late Lula Briggs-Galloway, a former paralegal and Saginaw County black history preservationist who established the now-closed Juneteenth Creative Cultural Center and Museum, 1314 N. Fifth, in 2003.\n\nThere, she erected a Stevie Wonder monument in 2005 to memorialize the singer's birthplace. Galloway died in November 2008 in San Jose, Calif., leaving the building and monument abandoned.\n\nToday, the monument slowly deteriorates from a lack of upkeep and maintenance at the vacant Juneteenth building.\n\nPeople can still read the 16-inch-by-20-inch brass plaque describing Wonder’s accomplishments, but some of the bricks are now missing from the monument’s base.\n\nSome folks, even from other towns, have noticed.\n\n“This is where Stevie Wonder was born, that’s a big deal. There should be something on that road to let people know,” said Beth Dore, owner of Duso’s Bar, 604 E. Midland Street in Bay City, who said she stumbled upon the monument one day while visiting Saginaw.\n\nShe hopes it can be cleaned and better maintained.\n\nSaginaw’s Mary Washington, founder of the Northeast Neighborhood Association, which covers the territory in which the monument resides, thinks it would be a good idea to send the monument to an active museum, but only if the Juneteenth building and surrounding land remain unused.\n\n“If someone does something with the building, I think it should be kept there to remind people of the history of the neighborhood,” Washington said.\n\nLast year, city officials were in talks about turning some of the city's empty neighborhood blocks into \"green zones.\" The Juneteenth center and monument are located within one of those zones and could face demolition.\n\nWashington is hopeful that the monument would be exempt from removal as a historical site.\n\nBarbara Mausolf, deputy treasurer, said the city is a long way from beginning any work on the green zones.\n\n“We would be more than happy to work with neighborhood groups to preserve their historical markers,” Mausolf said.\n\nThe last time Wonder played a concert in Saginaw was 1986, and he isn’t seen in any regular in community activities like some other Saginaw residents who became celebrities, such as professional basketball player Jason Richardson. That doesn’t make his impact on the city any less, Washington argues.\n\n“(Stevie Wonder) has been around for a long time and made something of himself and he came from here,” Washington said. “Regardless of what people say, he can serve as an inspiration for others that are here.”\n\nAnnette Rummel, chief executive officer of Great Lakes Bay Region Convention and Visitors Bureau, was part of the team that helped Galloway to raise money for the monument in 2005. She agrees that the it an important part of Saginaw’s history.\n\n“A lot of people don’t realize that where that marker was placed was the spot where Stevie Wonder was born,” Rummel said. “History is history and he was born here.”"
