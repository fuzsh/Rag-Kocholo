        "text": "Stevie Wonder is an African American musician and songwriter, known for his many hit singles and acclaimed albums throughout the '60s, '70s, and '80s. His full name is Stevland Hardaway Morris.\n\nNotable Stevie Wonder hits include \"Superstition\", \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\", \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\" and \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\".\n\nAs well as being a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he has won a total of 25 Grammy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life (1950-1964)[]\n\nStevie Wonder was born in Saginaw, Michigan as Stevland Hardaway Judkins, the third of six children. His mother was songwriter Lula Mae Hardaway and his father was Calvin Judkins. His mother divorced his father when Stevie was four and moved all six children to Detroit. When she later remarried, Stevie took her new husband's last name, Morris.\n\nStevie and his childhood friend John Glover occasionally performed on street corners, dubbing themselves \"Stevie & John\". By the age of ten, he had already learned to play the harmonica, drums, and piano.\n\nHe wrote his first original song in 1961 at the age of 11, which he sang to Ronnie White, co-founder of The Miracles. The song was never recorded, but Ronnie White took Stevie and his mother to an audition at Motown Records. He was signed to the label and given the nickname \"Little Stevie Wonder\".\n\nFor his first few albums, he worked with songwriter and producer Clarence Paul. They worked on an album which consisted mostly of Ray Charles covers and another which consisted of instrumental tracks. Little Stevie went on his first tour in 1962 at 12 years old, and his début single \"I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It The Blues\" was also released that summer.\n\nThe two recorded albums, The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie and Tribute to Uncle Ray were released in September and October of 1962, respectively, and a recording of a 23-minute performance by Little Stevie from his first tour was released as the live album The 12 Year Old Genius early in 1963. The live version of \"Fingertips\" was released as a single from this album.\n\nThe 1963 album With a Song in My Heart removed the \"little\" from Stevie Wonder's title, and he was known simply as Stevie Wonder for the first time. This release was followed by Stevie at the Beach in 1964.\n\nEarly Successes (1965-1975)[]\n\nStevie Wonder worked with Sylvia Moy in 1965 to produce the single \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\", which was a success. the album Up-Tight, which featured the song, as well as Down to Earth were both released in 1966.\n\nIn 1967, Stevie Wonder released I Was Made to Love Her and the Christmas album Someday at Christmas. The instrumental album eivetS rednoW and For Once in My Life were released in 1978.\n\n1969 and 1970 saw one release each: My Cherie Amour and Signed Sealed & Delivered. The song \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" was Stevie Wonder's first self-produced song. Also in the summer of 1970, Stevie Wonder co-wrote and played various instruments on The Spinners' hit \"It's a Shame\".\n\nStevie Wonder married to singer-songwriter Syreeta Wright in September of 1970, when he was 20 and she was 26, and they worked together on his next album, Where I'm Coming From, released in 1971.\n\n1972 brought Music of My Mind and Talking Book, the latter of which is known for the chart-topping singles \"Superstition\" and \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\". He toured with The Rolling Stones after this release.\n\nInnervisions was released in 1973 and produced multiple moderately successful singles, including the early release of \"Higher Ground\". Just after the album was released, Stevie Wonder was in a car accident and suffered partial anosmia, but he returned to touring in 1974.\n\nThroughout mid-1974, Stevie wonder worked with his wife on her second studio album, called Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta, which was released in June, as well as working on his own next studio album Fulfillingness' First Finale, released in July. A recording session in which Stevie Wonder participated in March would later be released as the bootleg A Toot and a Snore in '74.\n\nIn 1975, Stevie Wonder held a benefit concert for the Jamaican Institute for the Blind in which he was joined by Bob Marley and the Wailers. This concert was known as \"The Wonder Dream Concert\", but it did not feature a live release. 1975 was the first year in which Stevie Wonder did not release an album in ten years.\n\nMid-career (1976-1990)[]\n\nStevie Wonder released the triple-record set of original tracks Songs in the Key of Life in 1976, which is often viewed as Stevie Wonder's best album. After this ambitious project, Stevie Wonder took a 3-year break from recording.\n\nThe next project he took on was a rather unusual one for popular artists of the era: The soundtrack for a nature documentary; The Secret Life of Plants. The soundtrack was called Stevie Wonder's Journey Through The Secret Life of Plants and consisted mainly of instrumental tracks.\n\nStevie Wonder's 19th studio album Hotter than July was released in 1980, and 1982 saw the release of the compilation Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium with four new tracks.\n\nThe Paul McCartney-Stevie Wonder collaboration \"Ebony and Ivory\" was also released as a stand-alone single in 1982 in March. In 1983, Stevie Wonder performed the theme song for the film The Outsiders.\n\nIn early 1985, Stevie Wonder was part of USA for Africa in recording the charity single \"We Are the World\" for famine relief in Africa, and when his single \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" from 1994's The Woman in Red Soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, Stevie Wonder accepted the award \"in the name of Nelson Mandela\", which led the Apartheid government in South Africa to banish all of Stevie Wonder's music from playing on radio stations.\n\nIn Square Circle was released later that year in 1985, and Characters was released in 1987.\n\nStevie Wonder did several other collaborations throughout the '80s as well, playing harmonica on a few different tracks for various artists, as well as performing a duet with Michael Jackson.\n\nLater years (1991-present)[]\n\nIn the early '90s, Stevie Wonder wrote the soundtrack to the film Jungle Fever, recorded the live album Natural Wonder, and released his 22nd studio album Conversation Peace. He wrote two songs for the Bamboozled Soundtrack in 2000.\n\nHe performed at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Paralympics, the Obama Inaugural Celebration in 2009, the opening ceremony of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games, and many other events in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nA Time to Love is Stevie Wonder's most recent studio album to date, released in 2005. Rumors existed of possible new Stevie Wonder albums in 2008 and 2014, but no releases were seen aside from compilations.\n\nHe performed at the memorial service for Michael Jackson in 2009, and at Etta James's funeral and Whitney Houston's memorial service in 2012.\n\nIn 2010, he also spoke in front of the World Intellectual Property Organization about the need for better copyright laws to improve access to audiobooks for visually impaired people.\n\nToday, Stevie Wonder continues to perform and collaborate with other artists, mostly being featured on harmonica or background vocals.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nMuch of Stevie Wonder's musical inspiration comes from classic soul singers like Marvin Gaye, as well as other artists such as Johnny Ace and Del Shannon.\n\nOutside of music, Stevie Wonder has also campaigned as a social and political activist on various occasions, including having successfully campaigned to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday in the U.S.\n\nIn 1970, Stevie Wonder married singer-songwriter Syreeta Wright, but this marriage only lasted 2 years, as they divorced in 1972.\n\nHis first child was born in 1975, Aisha Morris, to his girlfriend at the time, Yolanda Simmons. Aisha was the inspiration for the song \"Isn't She Lovely\" and has performed and recorded with Stevie Wonder. Stevie and Simmons had a son named Keita in 1977.\n\nHis third child, Mumtaz Morris, was born in 1983 to mother Melody McCulley.\n\nHe married again to Kai Millard in 2001, and they have two sons: Kailand and Mandla Kadjay Carl Stevland Morris. He divorced Kai Millard in 2012, and married again to Tomeeka Robyn Bracy in 2017. They have a daughter named Nia.\n\nIn December 1999, Stevie Wonder said he was interested in pursuing an intraocular retinal prosthesis to partially restore his sight, but this was never done.\n\nStevie Wonder became a vegetarian in January of 2014.\n\nAwards, Honors, & Mentions[]\n\nIn addition to winning 25 Grammy Awards - the most ever won by a solo artist -, including the Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance 6 times, plus a Lifetime Achievement Award, Stevie Wonder won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1985, the Polar Music Prize in 1999, the Billboard Century Award in 2004, and the Montreal Jazz Festival Spirit Award in 2009. He also won a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Civil Rights Museum.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Apollo Theater Legends Hall of Fame in 2011. Upon induction, he was awarded the Songwriters Hall of Fame Johnny Mercer Award. In 2006, Stevie Wonder was one of the first inductees into the Michigan Walk of Fame.\n\nHe received the very first American Troubadour Award, awarded by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2007, and the third Gershwin Prize awarded by the Library of Congress in 2009, presented to him by president Barack Obama, who also awarded him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. He was one of the Kennedy Center Honor recipients in 1999.\n\nIn 2010, Stevie Wonder received the Commandeur dans l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres (National Order of Arts and Letters) medal from the cultural minister of France.\n\nStevie Wonder was honored in 2016 by having a section of the street he grew up on renamed to \"Stevie Wonder Avenue\" and being awarded an honorary \"key to the city\" by Detroit mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nHe is listed by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 9th greatest singer of all time and also at #15th on the \"100 Greatest Artists\".\n\nOn Stevie Wonder's 35th birthday in 1985, he was honored by the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid for his stance against racism in South Africa. On December 3, 2009, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace in honor of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nHe has also received numerous honorary Doctor of Music degrees from various colleges and universities.\n\nDiscography[]\n\n\"Little\" Stevie Wonder (1962-1963)[]\n\nYear of release Singles Albums 1962 \"I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It The
