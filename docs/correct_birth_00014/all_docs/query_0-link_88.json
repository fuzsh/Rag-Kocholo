        "text": "Originally dubbed \"Little Stevie Wonder\", Stevland Morris was born May 13, 1950 in Saginaw Michigan. The middle of six children, Stevie Wonder was born with a dislocated optical nerve causing blindness.\n\nStevie Wonder is an unmatched pioneer of music who's SOUL continues to influence artists across all genres.\n\nHis first major success \"Fingertips\" catapulted his career early in his life. Years later at Crystal Studios he would begin to develop \"Songs in the Key of Life\". This 18th recording by Stevie Wonder would go on to be considered one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nLittle Stevie Wonder\n\nHis family moved to Detroit soon after he was born where he sang in church and other community events. At the age of nine, Stevie became friends with a boy whose older brother was Ronnie White. White was a co-founder and member of The Miracles who were signed to a then struggling black-owned company Motown Records. Ronnie auditioned Stevie and then took him to Brian Holland of Holland–Dozier–Holland for a second audition. Holland then took Stevie to Berry Gordy who he played harmonica and sang for. In 1959, an impressed Gordy officially changed Morris' name to Stevie Wonder.\n\nBlindness, Education & Fingertips\n\nStevie's first record on the Tamla label was \"I Call It Pretty Music\" which quickly became a hit. This was followed shortly by a duet with Clarence Paul called \"Little Water Boy\" and \"Contract on Love\". His fourth release and first million-seller \"Fingertips\", skyrocketed his career solidifying Stevie as an established recording artist at just 12 years old.\n\nStevie's talent allowed him to avoid the pipeline other blind children from poor families fell into. Typically a child would be enrolled into one of Michigan's schools for the blind, learned a trade and worked it for the rest of their life.\n\nWorkin' It Out\n\nStevie would go on to produce several more recordings, embark on tours and make numerous television appearances in the years after “Fingertips” joining the ranks of other Motown powerhouses of the time like the Supremes, Miracles, Temptations, Four Tops, Marvellettes, Marvin Gaye and Junior Walker and the All Stars.\n\nBy 1966 Little Stevie Wonder had grown to a six feet tall Stevie Wonder and the \"Little\" moniker was dropped. Once thought of as a student of another blind singer, Ray Charles, Wonder now had his own proteges and had grown into his distinct style. He had already become a master of several instruments with equally varied vocal ability often becoming so engrossed in his singing and dancing that he had to be removed from the stage.\n\nHe was already on top of the music industry at this time. In 1975 alone he toured 44 states to sellout crowds and received 20 keys to cities. All of the accolades and success only seemed to humble Wonder more. Unlike the average recording artist, Stevie’s compassion and need to illustrate overlooked aspects of our humanity grew deeper. He based many of his classical, Swahili, Jamaican, gospel and funk songs on themes of universal brotherhood and mutual understanding.\n\nConstantly investing in community, Wonder intervened in the potential closing of Shaw University a private Baptist historically black university in Raleigh, North Carolina. When told about Shaw, he set up a concert with several music stars to raise funding and set up an account where he would deposit money and give the school all of the interest. He set up two scholarship funds and established a teachers education program as well.\n\nThese are just a few examples of Stevie’s early philanthropy and interest in educational investments and community empowerment. These ideals were being reflected in his lyrics and musical composition as he embarked on his next album.\n\nIra Tucker, ministrator of Wonder's Black Bull Production was quoted as saying, \"...come July 4, when the world takes a look at us celebrating our bicentennial, in the big apple, they'll see a Black man smiling down on all the people.\"\n\nThe following is a review of Songs in the Key of Life by SOUL Newspaper published November 22, 1976:\n\nHere we have an Event: an album that was truly worth waiting two years for!\n\nStevie seems to be acutely aware that as a performer, he can relay political and philosophical messages that carry weight and credence.\n\nThus, folks who might never be curious enough to read a book on Black history will listen to 'Black Man'and become enlightened. And Black men who are still hung up over the worth and value of their mates may be sensitized by \"Ebony Eyes, which is a loving tribute to Black women. Songs like Village Ghetto Land,\" \"Love's In Need Of Love Today \"Saturn\" and Have A Talk With God\"' also reveal a maturity of thought (as well as being prime examples of Stevie's expertise as a composer and musician)."
