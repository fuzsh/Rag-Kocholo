        "text": "The son of a Protestant pastor and a fighting mother, Steveland Morris (Stevie Wonder) was born on May 13, 1950. Third in a family of 6 children and blind as a result of wanting to come into the world 6 weeks earlier, which cause the blood vessels in the back of his eyes have not formed, and their retinas are lost. Retinopathy of prematurity or ROP is the medical term, which was not helped by the excess oxygen pumped into his incubator.\n\nHis blindness forced him to change his way of communicating with the world, replacing the forms for notes, the light for the melodies and the outlines for rhythms, creating a musical full world of tones. His parents, when little Stevie was 5 years old, separated and moved with his mother and 5 brothers to Detroit, where they survive not without great efforts. His voice - out of the ordinary- causes his mother to enter the choir of the church; Is his first contact with the music.\n\nBut his soul full of rhythm and swing did that it was not late in meeting others \"black child\" of the parish, continuing the steps of \"The Miracles\" and other groups of Rythm and Blues or Jazz, devoting itself to do small shows in the streets of the quarter. There were 5 devilish creatures moving with a few frantic rhythms and interpreting a pagan music.\n\nThis did that a feligresa was denouncing such an \"aberration\" and interrupted momentarily the musical beginning of Stevie, who had to be content to hear music in his favorite program of radio, sundown and to dream with have a piano. The luck, in this case smiled him at the child Stevie, and did that a charity organization it was giving him a drums, which although it was not the dreamed piano, served him to start creating rhythms. It begins to touch with more frequency and takes part in a group with a cousin of his, the one who provides to him an audition for the record company Tamla-Motown, where it is immediately hired on having remained bewildered with this child of 11 years old.\n\nAt that age of 11 year old everyone called him \"Little\", but the fledgling Motown record house -created by blacks to produce black music in a hostile white environment- had given him the nickname \"the boy Wonder\", alluding to the word \"wonderboy\", child prodigy. But one fine day he renamed himself Little Stevie Wonder.\n\nThe Motown launches him and will not take long to reach his first hit -\"Fingertips\"- a dance song recorded in live that makes him get his first gold record and make him a little star. Both the single and the album, The 12 Year Old Genius Live, reach the undisputed number one on the major charts. At this age, 13, Stevie is already a musician and perfect composer beginning to rub shoulders with greats as Marvin Gaye.\n\nThe years go and decides deleted the \"little\" from his stage name, and start recording a series of albums produced by Clarence Paul. His voice was changing to him. He grew a mustache and hoped that the concerts will throw the girls phone numbers.\n\nHis mother worried that the music does not neglect his studies and hired a private tutor to travel with him at that time he had to make some tour. His name was Ted Hull, a graduate of Michigan State University. Together Clarence Paul and Ardena Johnson, an employee of the Motown, they assumed the role of tutor.\n\nThe successes at this time did not give back, and despite the work that had trouble eliminating the tagline of \"little Stevie\" emerged great songs as \"Uptight\", \"I Was Made To Love Her\", \"For once in my life\", \"My cherie amour\", \"Shoo-be- doo-be-doo-da-day\", or \"Yester-me, yester-you, yester-day\". All of them reached the top ten, and helped make Stevie one of the most successful artists.\n\nStevie's compositions which demonstrate a talent and innate qualities of the great composer that exploded in a brutal manner in the next decade, breaking all molds known so far.\n\nThis is the most glorious epoch of Stevie, it came out definitively the addition of \"Little Stevie\" from the moment in which he married Syreeta Wright, which was employed at the distribution department of the Motown, collaborator at compositions of first Stevie's albums of the seventies, his marriage did not last very much, but they kept on being very good friends up to his death in 2006. After getting divorced of Syreeta, one married again another member of the Motown, Yolanda Simmons, with which it has two sons, Aisha Zakiya (February 2, 1975) and Keita Sawandi(April 17, 1977).\n\nStevie took contact and position(attitude) of the social and political situation of the country, interfering face to face in the conflicts of his generation. He found a special connection in the African country Ghana, allocating part of his profits to that country.\n\nStevie met Johanan Vigoda, lawyer, who faced him in the worldly world of the music and the business, his symbiosis with him, they did that Stevie was obtaining a millionaire contract and a creative unimaginable freedom in those moments in a company a company as strong and strict as Motown, Stevie said to him: \"You do the best thing that you could with the business and with the money, I do the best thing that could to give the best product, like that any thing for that you ask will not be\"unreaso le\". The result was gaining ownership of their publishing rights and the master tapes of their recordings. All this with a contract of 37 million dollars for 7 albums in 7 years and an advance of thirteen million, increasing to 20 percent due to royalties on sales.\n\nIn the summer of 73, the vehicle suffered an accident in the one that was traveling with a truck, remaining in comma and there were moments in which he was afraid for his life, it is said that during the period in comma only he was answering moving his fingers when his manager was singing to him to the ear the lyrics of \"Higher Ground\".\n\nAfter a while he woke up, temporarily losing his sense of smell. The accident and his recovery caused a deep impression on him that changed the way he perceived the reality around him, and of course his music.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977 Stevie Wonder gained 14 Grammys including three \"Albums of the year\" continued by Innervisions, Fullfillingness firstfinale and Songs in the Key of Life, for many people one of the best albums of the music.\n\nIt was a period very rich in creativity and awards for Stevie, precursor in the employment of synthesizers and source of inspiration for the future musicians and and contemporaries. He had a parentheses in the year 78, which was been grateful in the collection of the Grammy to the best Album of the year by the winner of this year; \"thank you Stevie for not extracting album and allow me this year to receive it. \".\n\nThe decade begins with a new work of Stevie Wonder, Hotter Than July, it receives the 80 to rhythm of reggae thanks to his new hit, \"Master blaster\" and is opened for a wider hearing. Struggle to get the day of the birth of the Nobel Peace Prize, Martin Luthero King, was considered to be a holiday in the EEUU.\n\nHe does important collaborations as \"Ebony and Evory\" with Paul McCartney, \"Just Good Friends\" with Michael Jackson, along with Dionne Warwick, Elton John and Gladys Knight in \"That's What Friends Are For\" with that he obtains a Grammy, or his collaboration in the proyect Usa for Africa in one of the world's most successful songs, \"We Are The World\".\n\nA Greatest hits double album with the name of Musiquarium, shows us a fine selection oh hits and essentials, plus four unrealesed tracks with a high level.
