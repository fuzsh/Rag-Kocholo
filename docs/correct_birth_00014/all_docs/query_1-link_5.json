        "text": "SAGINAW, MI -- Happy Birthday, Stevie.\n\nBorn in Saginaw May 13, 1950, Stevie Wonder turns 65 today.\n\nThe international music star has not shown signs of retiring, with a few creative projects recently released and others in the works.\n\nTweet or post #HappyBirthdayStevie to celebrate and your message could be featured on steviewonder.net.\n\nHere's six things to know about Stevie Wonder on his 65th:\n\n1.\n\nStevie Wonder was born at the former St. Mary's hospital in Saginaw as Stevland Hardaway Judkins. He later moved with his family to Detroit, where his mother gave him the name Stevland Morris, the Motown Museum reports. He was blind at birth.\n\n2.\n\nA Stevie Wonder monument sits at the location of the now-closed Juneteenth Creative Cultural Center and Museum, 1314 N. Fifth, in Saginaw. The late Lula Briggs-Galloway erected the monument in 2005 to memorialize the singer's birthplace.\n\nThe building is now abandoned and the monument has fallen into disrepair, with some of the bricks coming off of the base. Wonder's cousin, Dorothy Dallas-Walker said in 2011 that she purchased the land from the Department of Natural Resources in 1981 but the sale was rescinded. She said at the time she wanted to obtain the property and monument to give Wonder a proper tribute.\n\n3.\n\nSteveland Judkins Morris was only 11 years old when Motown signed him to a contract in 1961. He released his first album, \"Little Stevie Wonder the 12 Year Old Genius,\" on May 13, 1963, according to the Motown Museum. The album was recorded live and included Wonder's first No. 1 hit \"Fingertips part 2.\"\n\nThe Motown Museum says there are \"numerous stories\" about how he got his now-famous name.\n\n4.\n\nThe year after his first album came out, Stevie Wonder enrolled at and attended the Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, where he studied classical piano.\n\nThe school closed in 1995 following years of declining enrollment and after the school moved to Flint.\n\n5.\n\nWonder says he loves Saginaw.\n\nDuring the August 2012 WONDERfest concert at Ojibway Island, Wonder called by phone and delivered a message that was broadcast to the crowd.\n\n\"I just want to thank everyone,\" he said. \"I am excited about the WONDERfest and I wish I could be there.\"\n\nThen, taking a more serious tone, he talked about the violence in Saginaw.\n\n\"The shooting and killing has to stop, he said, and things have to change. \"People have the right to live and survive,\" he said, closing with \"I hope to see you all soon. I love you, Saginaw.\"\n\n6.\n\nStevie Wonder is still dropping tracks and playing headline shows live.\n\nHe was most recently featured on backup vocals, keyboards, and harmonica on the track, \"California Roll\" on Snoop Dogg's album \"Bush\" released Tuesday, May 12 (Youtube link).\n\nWonder was featured at a May 1 fundraising concert for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's reelection campaign that raised about $2 million for his re-election campaign at a $1,400-per-person concert kickoff also featuring Michelle Branch and Miguel.\n\nWonder will headline Summerfest 2015 at Milwaukee's Marcus Amphitheater on June 27. His most recent concert was in Detroit in November 2014.\n\nWonder's music will provide the soundtrack to an NBC miniseries currently being developed. The TV series about the Underground Railroad is based on stories and a book written by former Detroit News columnist Betty DeRamus."
