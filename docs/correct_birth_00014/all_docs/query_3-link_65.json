        "text": "I was born and raised in Michigan and have spent the majority of my life here.\n\nHowever, I didn't realize how many things our state is known and famous for.\n\nWhen most people think about Michigan they most likely think about Detroit and its nickname the \"Motor City\"\n\nHow Did Detroit Get The Nickname the \"Motor City\"?\n\nDetroit got the nickname \"Motor City\" because it was the global center of the automotive industry in the early 20th century. The city capitalized on the invention of the automobile and became the automotive capital of the world\n\nStaying in Detroit the city also has another famous nickname \"Motown\"\n\nWhy Is Detroit Nicknamed \"Motown\"?\n\nDetroit is nicknamed \"Motown\" because it was the original headquarters of Motown Records, an American record label founded by Berry Gordy Jr. in 1958.\n\nThe name \"Motown\" is a mixture of \"motor\" and \"town,\" which has become a nickname for Detroit due to its long history as the center of the American automotive industry.\n\nWhile the two examples are some big things Michigan is known and famous for there are so many more. I've highlighted just a small sampling below for you to check out.\n\nTake a look and let me know if I missed something so I can update the list."
