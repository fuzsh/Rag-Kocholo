        "text": "Born Steveland Judkins in 1950, Stevie Wonder was a native of Saginaw, Michigan and was raised in Detroit. When he was only 10 years old he was introduced to Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records, and by the time he was 13 Wonder had his first #1 hit (Fingertips---Part2). His career can be divided into two segments: 1963-70 during which time his output was controlled by Motown, and 1971---, the period during which Wonder had artistic control over his recordings.\n\nOriginally a singer and harmonica player, Wonder learned how to play keyboards. bass, and drums, as well. Wonder was one of the first musicians to make extensive use of synthesizers. On many of his later records, he was able to play most of the instruments by overdubbing. Wonder has always been a performer with a great range; ballads, rhythm and blues, and straight ahead rock are all staples of his sound. Although he is occasionally overly sentimental (Isn't She Beautiful), Wonder is also capable of writing songs that have great force (Living For The City). Perhaps his greatest albums, Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale, and Songs in the Key of Life, all date from the early 1970s.\n\nWonder's #1 singles include Uptight (1965), You Are the Sunshine of My Life (1973), Living For the City (1973), I Wish (1976), and Ebony and Ivory (1982)."
