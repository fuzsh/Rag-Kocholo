        "text": "SAGINAW, MI -- In a brief, sometimes unintelligible phone call, Stevie Wonder called the Saginaw WONDERfest a few minutes before 7 p.m. to express his gratitude for the festival celebrating his many achievements.\n\n\"I just want to thank everyone,\" he said. \"I am excited about the WONDERfest and I wish I could be there.\"\n\nThen, taking a more serious tone, he talked about the violence plaguing Saginaw.\n\n\"I want to help make a difference,\" he said, adding that we need to work together as a community \"and I want to come there and be a part of the solution.\"\n\nThe shooting and killing has to stop, he said, and things have to change.\n\n\"People have the right to live and survive,\" he said, closing with \"I hope to see you all soon. I love you, Saginaw.\"\n\nWonder's cousin, Rickie Smith of Saginaw, talked to the legendary singer/songwriter for 30 minutes after the call and announced that he is coming to next year's festival.\n\nWonder, known then as Stevland Morris, was born at the former St. Mary's Hospital and moved to Detroit when he was 4 years old. He released his first No. One hit, \"Fingertips (Part 2),\" when he was 13 and received many accolades, including being named a cultural icon, in the years since.\n\n\"I think it's been a beautiful event,\" said Reggie Williams, a community police officer with the Saginaw Police Department. \"Families came together; you saw parents with children playing in the park and listening to the music.\n\n\"It was a good crowd for the first year and I can see the potential.\"\n\nEngaging young people in the arts and athletics makes his job easier, he said, and positive events such as the Saginaw WONDERland can go far in turning Saginaw's problems around.\n\n\"Keep their minds busy,\" he said. \"It's when our young people are wandering idly that they get in trouble. We'll see more people come out next year after they've heard what it's all about.\"\n\nOrganizers will start working on next year's event soon, said Shanonne Dunlap, general manager of NextMedia Group Saginaw, who had the idea three years ago and started actively planning it 16 months ago with the First Ward Community Center.\n\n\"We had a good crowd, a couple thousand people, though I'm sorry more didn't get to experience it. But I'm happy with the results.\"\n\nThey will review the pros and cons, \"and I'm going to pick Wendy Dore's brain. She's done this so well for the past 20 years.\n\n\"In 2013, we may do a big benefit for Celebration Square in Saginaw. We already have a lot of ideas.\"\n\nWonder protege Harrell Holmes Jr., who closed the show, says he can't wait to go back to Los Angeles and tell Wonder about the weekend.\n\n\"It's been very emotional for me, playing in my hometown for the first time in eight years,\" said Holmes, who is working on an EP, attending the American Musical Eramatic Academy in Los Angeles and will open for the Black Eyed Peas later this fall.\n\n\"I can't wait to tell him how much love there was here, from the young people and the older ones. He needs to see this.\""
