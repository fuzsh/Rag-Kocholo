Marilyn Knowlden (born May 12, 1926) is an American former child actress. She started appearing in Hollywood films in 1931 when she was four years old. She established herself as a freelancer who worked frequently at different major film studios throughout the decade, being cast in films such as Imitation of Life, Les Mis√©rables, and Angels with Dirty Faces. She worked with film stars such as Katharine Hepburn, James Cagney, and Claudette Colbert. In total, six of the films in which she appeared were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, all within the span of seven years.

She retired from film acting when she became an adult, but was active in local theatre productions as a playwright and composer. She is considered to be one of the last surviving actors from the 1930s period of Hollywood's Golden Years.
