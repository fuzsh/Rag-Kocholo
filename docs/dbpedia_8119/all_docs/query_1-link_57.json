Feedback from the directors was that they found her to be very responsive to direction, keen and engaging.\n\nFollowing on from filming Colette has just completed an intensive screen acting bootcamp with Annie Murtagh-Monks….\n\nPrior acting experience has been on rep club stages – Colette was the governess, Miss Prism, in The Importance of Being Earnest. She has also had chorus parts in Oliver! and West Side Story.\n\nHome is with her family in the truly beautiful Albany on the south coast, having been born and brought up in Zimbabwe, lived in the UK for 20 years, and now Western Australia for the past 20 years."
