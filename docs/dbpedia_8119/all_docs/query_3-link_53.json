        "text": "'Anthony Adverse' is a romantic costume drama film made in 1936, directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Fredric March, Olivia de Havilland, Gale Sondergaard and Claude Rains. Based on the 1933 bestselling novel of the same name by Hervey Allen, the movie was criticised as having a rambling, difficult plotline but it received seven Academy Award nominations, winning four Oscars, including Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actress for Gale Sondergaard (in the first year this Award had been made). It lost out for the Best Picture award to 'The Great Ziegfeld'.\n\nAlthough perhaps overlong and rambling by today's standards, 'Anthony Adverse' still stands up very well, particularly because of its brilliant cast of main and supporting players. It is further improved by the wonderful Erich Wolfgang Korngold score and cinematography by Tony Gaudio. Both Korngold and Gaudio won Academy Awards for their efforts in the film.\n\nSearch Amazon for 'Anthony Adverse'\n\nPlot\n\nScreenplay writer Sheridan Gibney makes a manful effort at compressing the long, sometimes rambling storyline of the original novel but the movie plot also tends to ramble and meander and it is easy to lose track of the plot lines.\n\nAnthony is played as a boy by Billy Mauch and as an adult by Fredric March. He is an illegitimate waif, raised by nuns and eventually adopted by a wealthy businessman, John Bonnyfeather played by Edmund Gwenn. Anthony grows up to be a responsible businessman and falls in love with the beautiful Angela Guiseppe, played by Olivia de Havilland. The story line takes many twists and turns following Anthony as he moves from businessman in Cuba to slave trader in Africa to rich benefactor in Paris. Along the way he comes across evil in the form of the Marquis Don Luis,and Bonnyfeather's housekeeper, Faith Paleologus, played respectively by Claude Rains and Gale Sondergaard.\n\nVarious moral messages are learned by our hero on his journey through life, including the evils of slavery and the importance of love. At the end he discovers, improbably, that his missing wife has become a famous opera singer and also the mistress of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nProduction\n\nThe long set of books together called \"Anthony Adverse\" written by American author, Hervey Allen, was published in 1933 and became an immediate worldwide success. Warner Bros. were looking to diversify their movie output into opulent costume dramas and they bought the film rights to the novel for $40,000.\n\nWarners initially wanted to sign up William Dieterle as director but eventually gave the job to Mervyn LeRoy who was Harry Warner's son-in-law and who had already gained a reputation for creating socially aware films.\n\nThe part of Anthony as a boy was originally scheduled for box-office favorite, child star, Freddie Bartholomew who had just had a hit with 'David Copperfield' in 1935. The part was finally given to Billy Mauch as he resembled Fredric March,who played Adverse as an adult.\n\nThe ensuing film was the most ambitious and expensive production ever attempted by Warner Brothers with 78 speaking parts and 98 roles, and also the longest, at 141 minutes. The African Slave Compound alone, built on the studio's backlot, occupied an astonishing twelve acres."
