        "text": "Comparing this with the previous film is inevitable, but inappropriate. It is inevitable both because this version was released just one year after the other and because the former is French and the latter is North-American (this is the most stimulating comparison). It is inappropriate because Bernard made three films based on Les MisÃ©rables, whereas Boleslawski âbetâ only on one 105-minute film. That wager was not a winning one, though. Nonetheless, despite several elisions and arbitrary choices with respect to the original story, the result is acceptable from a cinematographic point of view.\n\nThe first episode of the film focuses on bishop Myriel â known also as M. Bienvenu â but it shows also images from Valjeanâs imprisonment and Javertâs assignment, which reveals details of his past, too. The whole sequence takes 25 minutes out of the total 105. M. Bienvenu is well interpreted by the English actor Cedric Hardwicke who is also the youngest of the actors to have performed in that role in all the versions of Les MisÃ©rables I have seen, including those not listed here.87\n\nAs Jean Valjean leaves the bishopâs house, he stops by a little statue of the Virgin Mary like those typically found at a crossroad on a mountain path. Then, he observes the two silver candle holders the bishop gave him as a present. The nostalgic music that accompanied Valjean since he left the bishopâs house is now complemented by a humming choir that soon explodes into a triumphal âAve Mariaâ (thus, it seems to anticipate the pepla Hollywood would produce in the 1950s and 1960s). Now Valjean takes his hat off, kisses the statue and, finally, starts walking resolutely and steadily while the orchestra theatrically âplaysâ between the tonic and the dominant. Right after an intertitle says: âThus ended the first phase of the life of Jean Valjean.â For the continuation to be worth of seeing one must rely on Javertâs wickednessâ¦\n\nAt any rate, I must admit that the film has a good pace and, all in all, it works, especially if the director does not excessively rely upon episodes like the one I have just described. Fortunately, music cues are less than those usually present in a U.S. film of that time. Of course, only a part of Hugoâs novel could fit in one film. In fact, the encounter between M. Madeleine and the little Cosette (Marilyn Knowlden) is quickly represented, the negotiation to free her from the grip of the ThÃ©nardier family having being cut off. Through editing one jumps from their entrance in the inn straight to M. Madeleineâs buggy driving Cosette back to her motherâs house. Although close to her death, Fantine feels an immense joy in hugging her daughter again. Her past as a prostitute is completely omitted, perhaps to avoid troubles with the censorship. In Florence Eldridgeâs interpretation of Fantine there is a sense of constraint that, as I have already said, Bernardâs Fantine does not have. Instead, the tall and naturally noble Frederic March, despite his make-up as an Ecce Homo,88 is less a convincing prisoner than Baur. On the contrary, Baur is less a convincing M. Madeleine than March.\n\nDespite my hope about Javertâs wickedness one cannot rely on it. He asks to talk privately and urgently to M. Madeleine to reveal him, as a childish pupil would do, that he reported him as Jean Valjean. However, the answer is that Jean Valjean is already in the policeâs hands. This deeply upsets him and dissipates any doubts about Javert being first of all a victim of himself and of his really obtuse and blind faith in the application of the Law. One actually feels more pity rather than resentment toward him. Valjean and the spectators, though, must hold him some grudge when Javert addresses the ex M. Madeleine with bossy, intimidating and derisive words. Those hostile words are the last ones Fantine hears before dying. The event aggravates him so much that he jumps on Javert, chokes him and throws him in pain on the floor.\n\nNow, while the gendarmes on horses persecute Valjean and Cosetteâs buggy at night, North takes the chance to redeem himself from the dull music he composed to accompany Valjeanâs quick conversion in front of the Virgin Maryâs little statue. The piece is intense, very agitated and well-orchestrated but, unfortunately, fades out with no musical logic at all: this is a symptom of the musical ignorance that most of US producers and directors suffered from. Composers like Newman had to silently endure the request of schmaltzy music. On the other hand, there is no doubt that North completely adhered to Hollywoodâs taste since during his career (from 1938 to 1971, one year after his death) he won nine Academy Awards and was nominated twenty-four times!\n\nThe beginning of the third part is somewhat surprising: Valjean has aged slightly and Cosette is now an attractive girl. Unlike Bernardâs Cosette, Rochelle Hudsonâs interpretation is neither doll-like nor contrived. Also Eponine is different: in Bernardâs film she (Orane Demazis) was mildly attractive and quite reserved, here, instead, she (Frances Drake) is both more vulgar and attractive. The barricadeâs episode is preserved but, possibly to make it short, acts only as a backdrop to Valjeanâs rescue of Marius (John Beal). Finally, the episode about Javertâs suicide is hurried as in Bernardâs film, but its development is clearer. However, it is precisely in this episode where the most blatant modes and the most inappropriate juxtapositions are more patent: on the road back to prison Jean Valjean thinks of God and the humming choir comes in again. The excerpt is shorter and quickly bursts into the invocation âSanta Mariaâ that coincides with the shot of Javertâs legs while he is about to commit suicide. Is it an atoning suicide? Perhapsâ¦, but what has âSanta Mariaâ got to do with it? Yet, there is more after this very tasteless audiovisual juxtaposition: once Valjean reaches the place where Javert committed suicide, he observes first the ripples on the waterâs surface and then, while the image is about to fade out, he calms down, looks up to the sky as if he were thinking: âThank God for this suicide.â"
