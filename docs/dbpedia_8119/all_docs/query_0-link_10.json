        "text": "full name: Scott Hastings Beckett\n\nnickname: Scotty\n\nborn Oct. 4, 1929, in Oakland, CA\n\ndied May 10, 1968, in Los Angeles, CA, of undetermined causes\n\nSpecial note: The cause of Scotty's death is unclear. He checked himself into a Hollywood nursing home on May 8th after suffering a severe beating and was found two days later, dead in his room. Investigators found pills and a note, but the coroner ruled that the cause of death was unknown, in spite of an autopsy being performed.\n\nAlso of note: These filmographies primarily focus on the professional lives of the Our Gang kids. Included is information about jobs they held outside the world of show business, but this is mainly to explain what was going on during the times when they weren't in the public eye. Personal biographical details are kept to a minimum, since they're largely outside the scope of this project. We do make a few exceptions here and there, mentioning marriages and divorces, and including some of the more trivial anecdotes (true or untrue) that made their way into the newspapers while they were child performers, but for the most part, it's really about their careers. That being said, it's commonly known among Our Gang fans that Scotty had a very troubled existence as an adult, going through numerous arrests, divorces and suicide attempts, and ultimately dying at the age of 38. And let's face it: This is a very interesting subject when you dive into the details. So to satisfy whatever curiousity you might have about this aspect of Scotty's life, I've linked a separate page that was created just for this purpose, which you can access by clicking here.\n\n1929\n\nOn October 23rd of this year, The Highland Park News-Herald of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Mrs. J. W. Beckett, 156 South Avenue 57, left recently on the H. F. Alexander to visit (for) three weeks her new grandson, Scott Hastings Beckett, born Friday, October 4.\"\n\n1933\n\nScotty and his parents moved to Los Angeles probably sometime during this year. This appears to have been for the purpose of getting his father the medical treatment he needed for whatever (ultimately fatal) ailment it was he was suffering from. This is also where Scotty's paternal grandparents had lived since 1920. But where was Scotty living between his 1929 birth in Oakland and his 1933 arrival in Los Angeles? The answer isn't entirely clear, but it seems that he lived in California for the whole period. One reference mentions his father living in Visalia in 1927, but this was presumably not the case by the time Scotty was born. The same reference says that he then moved to Salinas (where another source says he was an aviator) and then to Los Angeles, but this leaves out at least one other city they reportedly lived in. This would be Mt. Shasta, where Scotty's father worked as a depot manager for an oil company. A 1943 fan letter to Scotty asked him if it was true that he had lived in Mt. Shasta, and he replied that he had indeed lived there at the age of three.\n\nDuring the fall of this year, Scotty entered the movie business. The Detroit Free Press of April 24, 1934, described it this way: \"The ways and means to motion picture fame are devious and strange. Last September Walter Lang, Columbia director, was a patient in the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Hollywood. A little four-year-old tot, Scotty Beckett, strolled into his room. Although Scotty had never seen Lang before, he decided to cheer up the director. He sang 'Shuffle Off to Buffalo' and 'In the Good Old Summer Time.' What is more, he sang them in pig Latin. Lang gave the boy a toy dog, and a great friendship was begun.\" The Venture Free Press of December 28, 1935, stated that it was an assistant director, and that he heard Scotty singing to other patients. The Spokesman-Review of September 4, 1936, stated that \"the nurses delighted in showing young Scotty off to the movie stars who happened to be in the hospital at the time.\" The Modesto Bee of July 28, 1947, stated that both Lang and assistant director Philip Karistein heard him sing. The World Wide news syndicate of August 2, 1942 described it this way: \"The opening chapter finds Scotty, age three, visiting with his mother at a hospital where his father lay dying. A fairly good singer and comedian, Scotty, too young to understand his father's condition, occasionally visited rooms of other patients and tried to cheer them. One day Scotty met Phil Karlstein, an assistant director at Universal, who also was a hospital visitor, and introduced him to his father, who said he hoped some day Scotty would be in pictures, too. After the father's death, Karlstein got Scotty a contract with another studio.\" John Brunas, in his 1970 article that wound up in Leonard Maltin's Hollywood Kids book in 1978, said that it was a casting director who noticed Scotty, and that he then suggested to Scotty's mother that she take him for a screen test. The test was successful and Scotty was registered with Central Casting. On June 1, 1934, Dan Thomas stated in his syndicated column that this all happened 7 months prior, placing it in October 1933 at the earliest. This might be a bit too late, though, considering the release dates of Scotty's first films.\n\nVery early on, Scotty was trained in the Ethel Meglin Studios.\n\nGallant Lady (small part: Deedy at age 2)\n\nprem. Dec. 7, 1933 - 20th Century/UA - 9 reels - Ann Harding feature\n\n©Jan. 1, 1934. Released Jan. 5, 1934. Also starring Clive Brook. Scotty played a younger version of Dickie Moore's character.\n\nI Am Suzanne! (role: child in hospital)\n\nDec. 25, 1933 - Fox - 98 min. - Lilian Harvey feature\n\n©Dec. 20, 1933.\n\n1934\n\nAccording to Maltin & Bann, Scotty interviewed for Our Gang in January of this year. His first day of work in the series was on January 20th.\n\nOn March 20th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Meet filmdom's newest 'gangster.' He is Scott Beckett, 4 years of age, and declared to be one of the most promising of his profession yet to be recruited for membership in Hal Roach's little band of 'rascals' popularly known as 'Our Gang.' The son of Mrs. Ruth Beckett, 'Scotty' yesterday was awarded a five-year optional contract.\"\n\nOn March 21st, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Scott was given a tryout with the juvenile unit during the production of its two most recent pictures. So well did the young man conduct himself that Henry Ginsberg, vice president and general manager of the studio, signed him under exclusive contract.\"\n\nOn March 22nd, the Highland Park News-Herald of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Dickie Moore, Baby LeRoy, Jackie Cooper and all the other juvenile stars of the screen had better look to their laurels. A new child sensation, said to possess even greater possibilities than these young headliners, flashed across the film horizon Tuesday (Mar. 20th) when four-year-old Scott Beckett was signed on a five-year optional contract for Hal Roach's 'Our Gang.' Highland Park can't claim 'Scotty,' but it can claim his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Beckett, who have resided for many years at 156 South Avenue 57. The youngster, whose father is dead, lives with his mother, Mrs. Ruth Beckett, at 1185 Tremaine avenue. Grandma and Grandpa Beckett proudly announced yesterday that Scotty already has appeared with Ann Harding in 'Gallant Lady,' his first picture, and will be seen soon in an Our Gang comedy, 'For Pete's Sake.' They did not announce the terms of his contract, but hinted that it stated 'a pretty good figure.' \"\n\nOn March 28th, the Spokane Daily Chronicle (WA) reported the following: \"The southland's newest 'gangster' is the four-year-old grandnephew of Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Blanchard, W2319 Mallon, Spokane. Mrs. Blanchard has received word that Scott Beckett, son of her nephew, the late Ralph Beckett, formerly of Spokane, has been given a five-year contract with the Hal Roach studio in Hollywood as a member of 'Our Gang' of movie comedy fame. 'They say Scotty has all the charm of Jackie Cooper, Jackie Coogan and Dickie Moore combined,' Mrs. Blanchard said. 'At any rate they seem to have accepted him as a \"reg'lar feller\".'; Scotty's new good fortune is tinged with tragedy, for it was at the hospital when his father was dying last fall that the movie managers first saw him and asked for a test. Ralph Beckett was the son of Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Beckett, well-known pioneers who first came to Spokane in 1889. He was a graduate of Lewis and Clark high school. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1920.\"\n\nOn April 14th, the Evening Vanguard of Venice, CA, reported the following: \"Four-year-old Scott Beckett has been awarded a five-year contract as a full-fledged member of Hal Roach's 'Our Gang.' He is said to possess the whimsical appeal of Dickie Moore, and the alertness of Jackie Cooper, according to studio attaches. Between scenes the other day at Roach's studio where I watched 'The Gang' work, members entertained their mothers, electricians, and cameramen with songs and dances. Scotty sang, 'I Want to Go Back to My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua Hawaii,' and really got in all those DIFFICULT words that you and I stutter over!\"\n\nOn May 2nd, the Daily News of New York reported the following: \"The movie contract which the local courts legalized for 4-year-old Scott Beckett show the child drawing $75 a week now, with raises up to $250 a week before the contract expires in 1939.\"\n\nOn June 1st, Dan Thomas reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Seven months ago 4-year-old Scotty Beckett went to a hospital to visit his father, who was suffering from a serious illness. Once inside, Scotty wandered about the hospital and took it upon himself to cheer up some of the other patients. Among them was Walter Lang, screen director. Lang liked the youngster and as soon as he left the hospital he arranged for a screen test. Today Scotty has just completed his seventh feature picture 'Whom the Gods Destroy,' directed by Lang.\"\n\nOn July 1st, it was reported that both Spanky McFarland and Scotty Beckett had stand-ins, both of which were dummies that were used when shots were being set up. Presumably, these were the same dummies seen in the latter part of \"For Pete's Sake!\"\n\nOn August 14th, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, WA, reported the following: \"Scott Beckett, the attractive little boy who plays in 'Whom the Gods Destroy,' now visible at the Orpheum, is the son of the late Robert Beckett, formerly of Spokane. Robert Beckett was the grandson of Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Beckett, Spokane pioneers, and was brought up in Spokane. He graduated from the Lewis and Clark high school and during the World war served as an aviator. Two aunts, Miss Alma Scott and Mrs. E. C. Blanchard, 2319 Mallon, live in Spokane. Mr. Beckett's widow lives in Los Angeles. It was while young Scott Beckett was visiting his late father in his illness in a Hollywood hospital that a Hollywood director saw the child and recruited him for pictures. He is under contract to Hal Roach but was loaned for the making of 'Whom the Gods Destroy.' \"\n\nOn October 4th, The Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"The Hal Roach 'Our Gang' staged a double birthday party yesterday for 'Spanky' McFarland and 'Scotty' Beckett.\"\n\nOn December 18th, The Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"Fox yesterday borrowed Scotty Beckett from Hal Roach to play the part of Spencer Tracy's son in 'Dante's Inferno.' Bernard and Meiklejohn handled the deal.\"\n\n126. Hi'-Neighbor! (supporting role)\n\nMar. 3, 1934 - Roach/MGM - 2 reels - prod.

The payroll ledger reveals that Scotty's salary was charged to this production during the week ending Aug. 11. Presumably, he took part in the classroom scene that was deleted from the finished film (the one in which Jean Darling did some singing), as he's nowhere to be found in the available prints. It's also likely that the numerous delays in production led to his departure from the cast, since he was soon due to rejoin the Our Gang unit.\n\n1935\n\nOn February 14th of this year, the Brooklyn Times Union (NY) reported the following: \"Undeterred by wholesale visions of damage suits for shattered windows, Comedy Producer Hal Roach blithely announces plans for the national mobilization of 1,000 juvenile 'Our Gang' baseball teams. With 1,000 dozen uniforms already manufactured, and with Master Spanky McFarland, 'Our Gang' star, as national honorary president, Hal Roach's army of diminutive ball players will go into action the major leagues' opening day.\" On February 22nd, The Montclair Times (NJ) carried the same story, but added: \"In the fall, if all goes well, an 'Our Gang' world series is a Hollywood possibility.\" Publicity photos include Scotty with the rest of the boys, all in uniform.\n\nNear the end of March, Scotty's salary was raised to $100 a week.\n\nOn July 19th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Boys will be boys, opines Chester Morris. He was out on location with M.-G.-M.'s 'Pursuit' unit yesterday when two young actors Scotty Beckett and Meyer Bupp, both about 5, started using their fists. Maybe it was the heat. Chester parted them but couldn't learn the cause of the feud. They ceased hostilities when he promised to buy them boxing gloves as soon as the picture is over.\" Meyer was actually Moyer Bupp, better known as Sonny Bupp.\n\nOn July 25th, Dan Thomas reported the following in his syndicated column: \"They were shooting a scene for 'Pursuit' in which Scotty Beckett, tiny comedian borrowed from 'Our Gang,' was supposed to cry. But Scotty didn't want to cry. 'I guess I'll have to spank you to make you cry,' jokingly suggested Director Edwin Marin. 'I guess you will, Mr. Marin,' agreed Scotty to the flabbergasted director. 'But you'd better spank me hard. I don't cry easily.' \"\n\nOn August 13th, The Montclair Times (NJ) reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, diminutive 'Our Gang' comedian, has blasted C. Henry Gordon's reputation for good and all. 'He ain't a bad man at all - he's a swell guy,' says Scotty of the famous screen 'menace.' When the saturnine Gordon joined the cast of 'Pursuit' at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, Scotty took an immediate liking to the screen 'heavy.' Next to Chester Morris, Scotty insists, Gordon is quite the nicest man he's ever met. 'I don't care what he looks like on the screen,' stoutly asserts Scotty, 'or the things he's supposed to do. He's not like that at all. He took me to location in his car, he showed me how to hit a ball with a golf club, and he can tell the funniest stories!' Scotty is the pal of everyone in the company, and is getting a great kick out of the many locations as the studio motorcade is filming the story largely on highways and in auto camps. It is a fast-moving adventure romance in which Chester Morris and Sally Eilers are supposed to smuggle Scotty, center of a guardianship suit, out of the State. Gordon plays the private detective engineering the exodus of the trio.\"\n\nOn August 29th, the Courier-News of Plainfield, NJ, writing about the popularity of current child stars, mentioned Scotty in a list of kids that were well-known by sight, but who hadn't received much 'name' publicity.\n\nOn September 21st, Scotty, along with Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat and Darla, hosted an event at the California Pacific International Exposition at Balboa Park in San Diego, in which droves of young kids could gain admission for only a nickel and meet their heroes. The kids were also scheduled to lead a parade of home-made cars.\n\nOn September 25th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported the following: \"When Scotty, borrowed by M-G-M for 'Pursuit,' was requested by Director Ed Marin to cry, he told the little 6 year old, 'Scotty, you'll just have to feel it down in your heart, and then you'll grow up to be a big actor.' 'I don't want to be an actor,' protested Scotty, 'I want to be a deep sea diver, so on hot days like this, I'll be out in the ocean.' \"\n\nOn October 12th, the Spokane Daily Chronicle (WA) reported the following: \"Twenty-four dahlias in full bloom were 'guests' along with an equal number of children five to seven years old at a novel garden party this afternoon. The party, arranged by Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Beckett, W2319 Mallon, was 'just a little get-together to remind us of our five-year-old grandson, Scotty Beckett, now appearing with Hal Roach's \"Our Gang\" in Hollywood,' Mr. Beckett explained to the Chronicle. 'Each of the 24 dahlias growing in our garden had been named for one of the 24 children who attended the party,' he said. 'There is a stake with the child's name as a support for each of the growing plants.' Scotty Beckett is the son of Ralph Beckett, formerly of Spokane, who died a year ago in Hollywood, just about the time Scotty began to break into prominence in the movies, the grandfather said. 'We lost our son, but we've got our grandson, and we're mighty proud of him,' he added.\"\n\nAccording to child actor Billy Mahan, writing in 1973, he and Scotty vied for the role of Bobby Evers in the Jones Family series, which started with \"Every Saturday Night.\" Billy got the part.\n\nOn November 16th, Scotty's time at Hal Roach Studios came to an official end, though he would return in the 1950s for TV work. With his departure from Our Gang, he would no longer be attending the Our Gang school at the studio. At some point, he went to a private school called Marquand School for Boys.\n\nOn December 13th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Scotty would be working in the upcoming production of \"Anthony Adverse.\"\n\n132.

The picture is from an original story based on Eugene Field's famous poem, 'Little Boy Blue.' \"\n\nOn March 28th, the Portland Sunday Telegram and Sunday Press Herald (OR) reported the following about \"The Case Against Mrs. Ames\": \"The child in the picture is Scotty Beckett - he works a lot in the Hal Roach Comedies. He is the central figure in the court fight (a la Gloria Vanderbilt) and he's darling. Every time director Seiter says, 'Well done, Sonny!' he pipes up with a 'Thank you!' In true star fashion his car awaits on the lot. It's just large enough to seat Scotty but it has a real one-cylinder gasoline motor! He spends part of his lunch hour riding around in it, with a man perched precariously on the back for safety's sake. The man irks Scotty, who explains seriously that he'd like to ride it all by himself, he 'knows how' but they won't allow it! That seems to be a serious problem in his young life.\"\n\nOn March 31st, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (PA) reported the following about \"Little Boy Blue\": \"Chic Sale, who is featured in the picture, presented Scotty with a tiny, canvas-backed director's chair on the back of which was lettered 'MR. BECKETT.' \"\n\nOn April 3rd, a benefit show and fashion parade was presented by the Junior Trouper Club at the Hollywood Masonic Temple. Scotty was among several child actors scheduled to participate.\n\nOn May 16th, Sheilah Graham reported in her syndicated column that 15 boys were tested for the role of Prema Sing in \"The Charge Of The Light Brigade,\" with Scotty winning the role.\n\nOn June 21st, Preston Sawyer of the Santa Cruz Sentinel wrote the following while \"Old Hutch\" was being filmed in his area: \"Little Scotty Beckett, blond, blue-eyed and 6, beloved of the troupe, is the 'babe' of the synthetic family.\" On June 23rd, he wrote: \"Lovable little Scotty Beckett, formerly of 'Our Gang,' and now the youngest of the Hutchens family, approached this scrivener last night in the hotel lobby. 'Thank you, Mr. Sawyer, for the writeup,' said he, his great brown eyes dancing mischievously through perfect lashes. 'But you said I have blue eyes' - And the scribe appropriately faded, amidst the fancied tones of a Major Bowes gong.\"\n\nOn July 31st, The Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"Sam Katzman is negotiating to team Tom Tyler and six-year-old Scotty Beckett in six westerns for his victory program this season. Both are represented by William Meiklejohn. Papers are expected to be signed by the first of the week. Young Beckett played in 'Anthony Adverse' for Warners.\" It appears that Scotty never wound up in these westerns.\n\nOn September 4th, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, WA, stated that Scotty had worked with 'Our Gang' for two years and was now freelancing.\n\nOn November 11th, The Dayton Daily News (OH) reported the following: \"Taking his own life in his hands, Errol Flynn, Warner Bros. star, saved Scotty Beckett, 5-year-old screen actor, from serious injury. It was during the filming of a scene of 'The Charge of the Light Brigade,' which is showing on the screen at the Victory this week. The company was on location above Lake Malibu. The horse on which the child was riding stumbled, throwing other horses in the scene into confusion. Flynn jumped off his mount and grabbed the boy just as he was about to fall to the ground under the hoofs of 25 stampeding horses. The youthful actor was not injured but Flynn suffered leg bruises.\"\n\n142. Divot Diggers (archival sound)\n\nFeb. 8, 1936 - Roach/MGM - 2 reels - prod.

Scotty was one of 15 boys that were tested for his part.\n\n1937\n\nOn January 15th of this year, Scotty was one of the celebrity guests of honor at Highland Park Ebell Club as part of their Husband Night. As the Highland Park News-Herald put in on January 22nd: \"The first one introduced by Mrs. Goldsmith was the diminutive Scotty Beckett, who amazed the audience by his well worded and humorous speech as he stood on a table. Scotty, who has appeared in a number of outstanding pictures such as Anthony Adverse, bids fair to become a starlet of prominence. His lovely mother, his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Beckett and his great aunt, Mrs. T. R. Welch were introduced.\"\n\nOn March 16th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Scotty was among the guests of honor at the Women's Athletic Club.\n\nOn May 21st, the Los Angeles Times reported that Scotty had been cast for \"Walewska,\" which was a working title for \"Conquest.\"\n\nOn June 20th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Freddie Bartholomew had recently thrown a party for Tommy Kelly at the MGM studio's executive bungalow. Scotty was among the hundred or so movie kids that attended.\n\nDuring this year, a comic book featuring the Our Gang kids called The Dandy debuted. Among the characters was Scotty.\n\nOn July 14th, the Oakland Tribune reported the following: \"'Scotty' Beckett, seven-year-old Hollywood motion picture actor, is one up on his playmate, Freddie Bartholomew, now. 'Scotty' did yesterday what every child actor in the cinema city has been wanting to do for some time. He climbed around on the Hawaii Clipper, Pan-American Airways' giant flying boat. It was quite a treat for the little star, for he has spent most of his two weeks' vacation in Oakland lying in bed recovering from a brain concussion. 'Scotty,' whose real name is Scott Hastings Beckett, came to Oakland a little more than a week ago to visit with playmates, with whom he was raised. The youngster was born here, at Merritt Hospital, October 4, 1929. The day after he got here, 'Scotty' was playing on a scooter with an Oakland friend, when the vehicle upset, spilling the little actor on his head.\n\n\"So it really was a happy ending to his misfortune when he got the chance to watch the Clipper land yesterday and to make a personal tour of the craft. He did just the things any seven-year-old would, clamboring up on the aluminum back of the ship, dropping down into the cabin, asking the attendants a host of questions, and he even got to sit in the pilot's seat and hold the controls, right where Capt. W. G. Culbertson had been a few moments before. Principally, though, 'Scotty' slipped one over on his pal, young Bartholomew. And as soon as he gets back to Hollywood, 'Scotty's' going to look up Master Freddie and tell him of the coup. It seems a bit of rivalry exists between the child actors, rivalry that was climaxed several weeks ago at a party.\n\n\"The youngster has an older brother attending U.C.L.A. now, and 'Scotty' intends to go to college himself some day and to study aviation. He would like to be a Clipper pilot. 'He wanted to be a deep-sea diver a week ago,' said his mother, Mrs. Ruth Slavan Beckett. Young 'Scotty' will have Clipper information at his finger-tips when he returns to report to friend Freddie. To prove he wasn't reading Pan-American publicity releases, 'Scotty' had his picture taken with the big ship.\n\n\"The Beckett boy, as Pan-American crew members will testify, is extremely smart for his age. He's in the high fourth grade at school, and while not featured like Bobby Breen or Freddie Bartholomew he has had some good picture parts. He played Prema, the little Indian boy in 'Charge of the Light Brigade'; Frederic March's son in 'Anthony Adverse'; and a host of other similar parts. He was with Greta Garbo in 'Countess Waleska,' to be released soon. He was her son in that, and is now a great friend of the actress. His latest picture, also unreleased, was with Jean Parker in 'Life Begins With Love.' His father, Ralph E. Beckett, an oil man, died four years ago. 'Scotty' and his mother are visiting here with her cousin, Mrs. J. H. Slavan, at 921 East Twenty-first Street.\"\n\nOn July 28th, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Scotty had been cast in \"Wells Fargo.\"\n\nOn August 19th, the Oakland Tribune reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, Oakland youngster, returned to Hollywood from his vacation here to draw the child lead in 'I'll Never Forget' at M-G-M.\" I have no idea what movie this is supposed to be, but it seems to have never been made.\n\nOn October 4th, the Salinas Index-Journal (CA) reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett is a typical Salinas boy, or for that matter, a regular boy in any town. True, he succeeded in Hollywood, and four years of work before the cameras have proven he is there to stay. He has kissed Garbo, palled with Spencer Tracy, held Virginia Bruce's hand and studied with Wallace Beery in the 12 pictures in which he has played featured roles. But all this success can't change Scotty, because he's a regular fellow. He would as soon pal around with a Salinas playmate, as play his favorite game, 'robbers and cops,' with Shirley Temple.\n\n\"Wallace Beery, working with Scotty in 'Bad Man of Brimstone,' said of his fellow worker, 'Scotty is a great actor, because he doesn't act. He is the same before the cameras, and dozens of critical eyes, as he would be playing in a vacant lot with no one except his playmates watching. Though only five when he left Salinas, Scotty remembers one thing particularly well about this city - its rodeos. Aside from being an aviator, his ambition, he would like to be a cowboy.\n\n\"Like other ranchers living within a 25 mile area of Salinas, his parents used to ride into town several days before the rodeo. It was a regular cowboy's convention, he says. And Scotty felt like one of them as he rode into town with his cowboy hat on and a cap pistol in each hand. 'The Bad Man of Brimstone' set at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is the closest thing I've ever seen to a real rodeo,' says Scotty.\"\n\nOn November 20th, Scotty participated in a \"studio tea and talent party\" co-hosted by Clella Van Pelt and Harry Hoffman, the latter being Scotty's guitar teacher. Scotty was among several of Hoffman's students to perform on this day.\n\nOn November 25th, the St. Louis Star-Times (MO) reported that Scotty would be among the kids attending Shirley Temple's Thanksgiving garden luncheon.\n\nWhen You're In Love (role: little boy with whistle)\n\nFeb. 12, 1937 - Columbia - 11 reels - Grace Moore feature\n\n©Mar. 1, 1937.

She had told young Scotty Beckett that she wanted most a ruby ring and a yacht. Scotty gets $1.50 a week for spending money. He took 49 cents and bought her the ruby ring!\" It was later reported that Scotty and co-star Marilyn Knowlden pooled their money together to buy the ring.\n\nOn April 4th, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported on Dickie Jones' 10th birthday party, held recently in the diner of the Santa Fe Chief. Among the guests was Scotty.\n\nOn April 14th, the Harrisburg Telegraph (PA) reported the following: \"Director Ray McCarey prides himself on always being ready with a swift comeback, but during the making of Universal's 'Hell's Kitchen,' eight-year-old Scotty Beckett threw him for a twenty-yard conversational loss. The camera was ready to turn when Scotty piped up, seriously: 'Listen, Mr. Director. Do I do this scene like I was mean, or as if I was just exasperated, like you get sometimes?' McCarey could only stutter after that one!\"\n\nOn July 13th, the Harrisburg Telegraph (PA) reported that Scotty had been added to the cast of \"Listen, Darling.\"\n\nOn September 1st, The Greeley Daily Tribune (CO) ran an article about a visit to the MGM studio: \"Indoors in a wood are Scotty Beckett, a very small boy, and Judy Garland, rehearsing in a cut-away trailer for Listen, Darling. The cameraman is shooting thru the trailer window. The director tells him a couple of times not to breathe on the window, cooled by rainfall amid lightning and thunder. Finally Scotty asks: 'Mr. Marin, where shall I breathe?' A good question.\"\n\nOn September 15th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Hollywood is on the verge of developing a new boy chess genius. He is Scotty Beckett, 8 years old. Scotty, who is the miniature 'villain' in 'Listen, Darling,' has trimmed every chess pretender in the company crew. He took Freddie Bartholomew and Judy Garland into camp with consummate ease and has issued an open challenge to Director Edwin L. Marin, Walter Pidgeon, Mary Astor and the rest of the cast.\"\n\nOn September 20th, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported the following: \"If he were ruler, he'd make it a practice to dress up unemployed extras in the costumes of a picture that had just been completed, like, for instance, Ronald Colman's 'If I Were King.' That, he thinks would make tourists happy and send them home convinced that Hollywood is a land of story books, which it really is to a large extent - inside the gates. Few young men in Hollywood could match the boasts of Scotty Beckett. He has kissed Garbo, held hands with Virginia Bruce, had tea with Joan Crawford. And now he has been hugged by Norma Shearer. However, when asked whether he enjoyed being embraced by such a famous star, he merely shrugged, said that Miss Shearer was 'awfully nice,' but that he'd rather watch a good cowboy picture.\n\n\"Scotty, as you may have surmised, isn't old enough to appreciate the adverntures he has had. He's only nine and he never misses a Saturday Western matinee, which he insists upon attending wearing his cowboy hat and carrying his cap-gun. Appearing as the little Dauphin in 'Marie Antoinette,' which opens tomorrow at the Boyd, with Tyrone Power sharing stellar honors with Miss Shearer, Scotty was the pet of the set.\"\n\nOn October 20th, the Portland Press Herald (ME) reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, finishing 'Listen, Darling' was given his first wrist watch by his mother. He woke up once every hour that night to find out what time it was.\"\n\nOn October 21st, The Evening Sun of Baltimore, MD, reviewing \"Listen, Darling,\" had this to say about Scotty: \"The principals do what they can, but the Indian sign is on them from the very beginning. We except the precocious Scotty, who is everlastingly playing Daniel Boone and comes a cropper when he mistakes a family of skunks for what he argues are striped badgers. Scotty is stellar material for juvenile epics, because, for one thing, he wades through this photoplay with engaging unconcern, and when he is visible makes the elders take a seat away back.\"\n\nOn September 25th, the Harrisburg Sunday Courier (PA) reported the following: \"The entire Our Gang cast arrived on the set of 'Listen, Darling' at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at noon, announcing they had come to attend the birthday party for Scotty Beckett, a former fellow Gangster, who is appearing with Freddie Bartholomew and Judy Garland. Director Edwin L. Marin referred the matter to Scotty's mother. 'But,' protested Mrs. Beckett, 'Scotty's birthday isn't until October 4.' Alfalfa and Porky Lee muttered something about a mistake. Scotty whispered something to his mother and Mrs. Beckett was 'stuck' for ice cream and cake for the mob anyway. Now, she's wondering if there wasn't collusion somewhere in the incident.\"\n\nNo Time To Marry (role: Junior)\n\nFeb. 5, 1938 - Columbia - 7 reels - feature\n\n©Dec. 26, 1937.

The young screen actor has portrayed the role of son to Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Ann Harding, Olivia DeHavilland and Madeliene Carroll on the screen, but he still believes that his real mother is best of all.\"\n\nOn June 2nd, The Southwest Wave of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Popular child actor, Scotty Beckett, received a 'deodorized' skunk for a pet from a fan in Hemet, California. Scotty's mother took no chances on the success of the deodorization operation and promptly returned the animal, but with thanks.\"\n\nOn June 8th, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, 8-year-old screen actor who will soon be seen in MGM's 'Pups and Penguins,' has been invited by the graduating class of the Salinas public school to attend the graduation exercises. Salinas was Scotty's home before coming to Hollywood and the films.\" \"Pups And Penguins\" was the working title for \"Dog Daze,\" Scotty's last film with Our Gang.\n\nOn June 23rd, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, who celebrates his eighth birthday this week, received eight different gifts from eight boys in eight counties of Ohio, Scotty's home state. Upon receiving the gifts Scotty's only comment was, 'Gee, I hope they keep this up until I get to be an old man of 27.' \" This item was in the film section of the newspaper, so it's presumably about the same Scotty Beckett that's the subject of this filmography, but if so, than it's wildly inaccurate.\n\nOn June 24th, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Through the generosity of 'Scotty' Beckett, child motion picture actor, orphans of the Los Angeles Orphans home at 815 North El Centro street will be treated to a gala summer vacation party tomorrow afternoon on the occasion of the annual 'little big brothers day.' A treasure hunt, grab bag, candy, games with prizes donated by 'Scotty,' and many other entertainment features are planned to bring cheer to the 77 orphans ranging in age from 3 to 14 years.\"\n\nOn July 12th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported that Scotty was currently under personal contract to producer Charles R. Rogers. The contract called for Scotty to make two films per year for Rogers.\n\nOn July 13th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, juvenile actor, is selling lemonade to the cast and crew of 'Our Neighbors, the Carters.' \"\n\nOn July 28th, The Southwest Wave of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, 8-year-old child actor at Paramount studios, will be host to Young Gohenee, young son of the postmaster general of India, now making a world cruise.\"\n\nOn August 2nd, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett, 8-year-old actor, is organizing a polo team made up of 8-year-olds, who will go into the fray on pintos.

The paper is four pages and includes all local gossip as well as an 'Advice to Parents' column.

DeMille is not the only Hollywood director who uses bathtub scenes. Appearing for Paramount in 'Our Neighbors - the Carters,' the boy actor had to be 'dunked' into a bathtub seven times for one of Director Ralph Murphy's scenes.\"\n\nOn November 13th, Mr. and Mrs. J.

As the Highland Park News-Herald (CA) put it: \"Receiving at the door was the 10-year-old grandson, Scotty Beckett, of movie fame.\"\n\nOn December 6th, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following about the filming of \"My Son, My Son\": \"At the last minute there was a switch in casting among the children. Scotty Beckett was to have played Rory as a boy, but the sudden illness of Daryl Hickman, who was to have been Oliver, necessitated a quick change. So Scotty was rushed into Oliver's part and Teddy Moorwood was called in to play Rory. The change wasn't upsetting in the least to 8-year-old Scotty Beckett.

Frank Morgan is explaining to his 9-year-old offspring, Scotty Beckett, one of the age-old problems of the world. Even hardened grips are getting a kick out of this scene. They're all hovering close by as the camera rolls. 'You must be strong where others are weak,' says father Morgan to the little fellow. 'Stones hurt most those who throw them. Are you afraid my son?' The child looks up, lips quivering, real tears trickling down his cheeks. (Scotty's a Hollywood lad who can turn 'em on and off). 'No, father,' he says in a small voice, 'not now.' On these words, Director Frank Borzage, who seems strangely affected, too, quietly says 'cut.' There isn't a stir among the grips. A wardrobe woman daubs at her eyes with a square of cloth. But Scotty is immediately out of character. 'Say, Frank,' he inquires. 'Is that a real beard you're wearing or a phoney?' \"\n\nOn February 24th, The Miami Daily News also reported the following: \"Judith Anderson and Scotty Beckett have been dropped from their roles as mother and youngest son in Metro's \"The Mortal Storm\" because, according to the studio, they did not fit the parts. They have been in most of the scenes filmed to date, and the change will necessitate nearly a week's retakes.\"\n\nOn March 11th, Scotty applied for membership in the American Federation of Radio Artists. This may have had some connection to a program called Quiz Kids, which debuted during this year. According to kid actor Billy Mahan (writing in 1973), he was at the same audition as Scotty, an audition that Scotty won, resulting in him becoming a Quiz Kid. According to the application, Scotty was currently living at 1087 Meadowbrook.\n\nOn March 12th, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Gene Reynolds had replaced Scotty in \"The Mortal Storm.\" Of course, shooting had already begun with Scotty, so because of this, some of the reviews of the film later in the year mistakenly identify Gene as Scotty.\n\nOn April 4th, the McAllen Daily Press (TX) reported the following: \"Little Scotty Beckett, appearing in 'The Mortal Storm,' has invented a new game which he does in between scenes of the film. It is 'ping pong badminton,' played with badminton birds and ping pong paddles. To date Scotty has managed to trim all members of the cast who cared to challenge him, including Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart.\"\n\nOn May 9th, The San Francisco Examiner reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett is viewing Mother's Day with no little trepidation. He hopes to honor each of his 'screen mothers' with a gift - or hoped to until he stopped to make up a list that included Ann Harding, Norma Shearer, Olivia de Havilland, Madeleine Carroll, Greta Garbo, Irene Dunne and Josephine Hutchinson, in addition to his real mother, Mrs. Ruth Beckett. After considerable head scratching and lengthy computation the 10 year old lad decided that his allowance would stand the purchase of a package of chewing gum for each of his 'mothers.' \"\n\nOn June 26th, Harriet Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Cute kid actor Scotty Beckett, heading for six weeks of summer camp at Catalina, says when he returns he'll organize a little theater group and call it the sarong circuit.\"\n\nOn July 24th, Louella Parsons reported that Scotty had a front tooth knocked out while surfing at Catalina.\n\nOn September 7th, Film Daily reported in a syndicated piece on a joint exhibitor-newspaper critic poll conducted by themselves, determining the outstanding players in film between May 1, 1939, and Apr. 30, 1940.

Scotty said, 'The nose of a man is very necessary because it serves as a handle for the barber when he shaves underneath it.' \"\n\nOn November 26th, the Grant County Herald of Lancaster, WI, reported the following about Notre Dame's recent game against the visiting USC: \"The mascot of USC is 'Scotty' Beckett, a 12-year-old movie star. He was formerly in the Our Gang comedies, but is now appearing in feature pictures in roles that require boys of his age. He played the part of the dauphin in 'Marie Antoinette' with Norma Shearer, etc. He became mascot of the team when at the first game he attended they won.

The opening chapter finds Scotty, age three, visiting with his mother at a hospital where his father lay dying. A fairly good singer and comedian, Scotty, too young to understand his father's condition, occasionally visited rooms of other patients and tried to cheer them. One day Scotty met Phil Karlstein, an assistant director at Universal, who also was a hospital visitor, and introduced him to his father, who said he hoped some day Scotty would be in pictures, too. After the father's death, Karlstein got Scotty a contract with another studio. Scotty did well. Then recently Karlstein, promoted to associate producer, needed a boy in a picture and thought of the youth. A deal was reached and Scotty now is playing the part of a 10-year-old Prince Leopold at the court of 82-year-old Queen Victoria. And what kind of a salary does this young 'prince' knock down? Just $750 a week, that's all!\"\n\nOn December 28th, Harrison Carroll reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Add to reasons why producers get gray hairs. Scotty Beckett and Bobby Samarzich, two youthful members of the 'Boy From Stalingrad' troupe, went on location in the Santa Suzanna mountains and contracted cases of poison oak.

The day the picture started on location, Scotty, alone of the six juvenile principals, got a case of poison oak for which he had to be treated daily throughout the entire shooting schedule. With his role completed, and recovered from the ailment, Scotty joined his fellow players on the roof of the studio's tallest building, to pose for still photographs. In the midst of it a bee stung him on the right knee.\"\n\nOn March 2nd, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Conrad Binyon and Scotty Beckett who reputedly have done fine work in 'The Boys From Stalingrad,' will also be seen in 'Right Guy' at Columbia.\"\n\nOn June 21st, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported that Scotty had been signed by Universal to appear in \"Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves.\"\n\nOn September 25th, Mother's Day opened at the Geary Theater in San Francisco. Among the cast in this stage play was Scotty Beckett.\n\nOn October 2nd, the San Francisco Examiner reported the following: \"Lots of youngsters look with envy upon the children who act in pictures or upon the stage, thinking their lives are made up of footlights, publicity and fun; but if they knew the work and strict routine of professional children they would count themselves lucky. Consider the case of Scotty Beckett and Jimmie Smith appearing in 'Mother's Day.' They have long parts to memorize and late hours. But most importantly, they have to keep up in all their school work. Scotty and Jimmie are both in high school, and every day they spend several hours with a private tutor who hears their lessons and assigns them home work. Perhaps the boys don't have much fun, but people who see them in 'Mother's Day' at the Geary do. Appearing with Scotty and Jimmie is a notable New York cast, including Leon Ames, Leona Maricle and Mona Barrie.\"\n\nOn October 11th, the Oakland Tribune reported the following: \"Scotty Beckett was given a surprise party by his mother backstage at the Geary Theater on the occasion of his 14th birthday. Young Beckett is in 'Mother's Day.' The other youngsters in the company, Jimmie Smith, Patty Pope and Chick Parnell, enjoyed the party no less than the adults who came to wish Scotty health and happiness and what seems certain, a long run in 'Mother's Day.' \"\n\nIn mid-October, Mother's Day closed its San Francisco run. After this, the company moved to New York and started preparations for the play's Broadway run, during which the title would be Slightly Married.\n\nOn October 24th, The Tacoma Sunday Ledger (WA) reported the following: \"Glamorous gals don't cut any ice with the 12 year old male members of the cast of 'Good Luck Mr. Yates,' the Columbia picture now showing at the Beverly. During a lull in production the kids challenged Jinx Falkenburg, Jeff Donnell, Marguerite Chapman, Ann Savage, Leslie Brooks and Claire Trevor to a basketball tournament to be held on the court which had been constructed on the Columbia lot for scenes in the picture. The losers had to buy lunches for the winners for a week straight. The girls tried hard, but the embryo leading men won two games out of three. 'Chivalry had no place in this tournament,' declared Scotty Beckett firmly. 'We tried to beat 'em.' \"\n\nOn October 25th, Slightly Married opened at the Cort Theater. This was Scotty's only Broadway role, for which he got second billing. After a successful run in San Francisco, New York critics panned it, but gave Scotty good reviews.\n\nOn October 30th, Slightly Married closed after only eight performances.\n\nOn November 5th, The Dunsmuir News (CA) reported the following: \"In reply to a fan letter written by Ed F. Carter to Scotty Beckett when he was appearing in a stage play in San Francisco recently, Mr. Carter received a reply and an autographed photo of the youthful motion picture star. Mr. Carter, in his fan letter, asked Young Beckett if he had not lived in Mount Shasta when he was very small and mentioned several of his pictures he has seen him in and enjoyed. In his reply to Mr. Carter, he wrote he had lived in Mount Shasta and left there when he was three and that he remembered it because 'he had fun there.' The reply was written in a childish handwriting and was the same as that on the autographed picture. He told the Dunsmuir fan the names of his recent pictures - 'Good Luck, Mr. Yates,' 'Boy From Stalingrad' and 'Ali Baba and Forty Thieves.' Upon completion of the stage play in San Francisco, Beckett went to New York.\"\n\nOn November 19th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Scotty would be working in the next Barbara Stanwyck film, \"My Reputation.\" This film wasn't released until early 1946.\n\nOn December 29th, the Bristol Herald Courier (TN) reported the following: \"Bill McKenzie, Bristol youngster who recently passed a Paramount Pictures test in New York City, had another big moment Monday night (the 27th) when he talked over long distance hookup with Scotty Beckett, well-known Hollywood boy actor, who complimented Bill on his Paramount showing.

Mansfield Ave. At the age of 16, he is today enrolled in the freshman class at UCLA, where he will take a liberal arts course. He is two years younger than most of his classmates on the Westwood campus. Except for a brief interval at Los Angeles High School, all of his schooling from kindergarten up has been on film sets under the tutelage of studio teachers.\" Reportedly, Scotty had graduated from high school during this year.\n\nOn March 23rd, The Capital Times of Madison, WI, reported the following: \"Comely Sharon Douglas, who plays 'Babs' Riley on 'The Life with Riley' show over WIBA Saturday nights received a whole bowl of shamrocks from an unknown admirer in celebration of St. Pat's day.

One of them was Jolson himself, another was Larry Parks, who plays him in a current film based on his life; a third was Scotty Beckett, who plays Jolson as a boy in the same picture, and the fourth was Robert Gordon, who played the boy Jolson in the early-day 'The Jazz Singer.' Gordon, known as the 'best Jolson imitator in the world' during his vaudeville days, was engaged to help Parks portray Jolson in the Technicolor music drama, 'The Jolson Story,' now before the cameras.\"\n\nOn August 17th, The Pittsburgh Press reported the following: \"Rita Hayworth is acting as a 'college broker' these days. No sooner had she helped in her brother Vernon's enrollment at Los Angeles City College than she performed the same chore for Scotty Beckett at UCLA. Beckett is the child actor who did almost all grammar school and college 'prep' work on film sets, his last being done when he played Al Jolson as a boy in 'The Jolson Story.'

These 'teen-agers think 90 per cent of the epics turned out nowadays are 'just plain lousy.' The kids oughta know. They've been making movies since the days when a nurse used to feed 'em pablum on the set between takes. They've seen many a movie queen come and go - but they're still around - from Our Gang comedies to juvenile parts. Altogether , they've cleaned up an average of $350,000 each during their careers. Movie-making is the only life they know. But, as far as they're concerned, the 'good old days' were better. The old-timers were Scotty Beckett, 17, Ann E. Todd, 15, Darryl Hickman, 17, Harry Shannon, 17, and Dickie Moore, the only one who shaves every day. He's 22. To a man (with apologies to Miss Todd, who's growing up to be a beauty) they blasted the current crop of movies as 'grade A stinkers.' Even cited names and titles and box-office receipts. 'Personalities are taking over the screen,' Scotty declared. 'In my day (he started in the business at the age of 3) the stars had to do some acting. They don't nowadays. Look at Van Johnson. He's a swell guy, personally, but he sure can't act.' \"\n\nOn August 17th, Ed Sullivan, writing in his syndicated column, gave the results of an informal poll conducted by his daughter, in which she asked young people in the movie colony to give their favorites among their peers. Scotty was rated \"best of the boy actors.\"\n\nOn September 10th, Belle Ayer's Film Fanfare voted Claude Jarman, Jr., for best juvenile actor. Scotty was one of four runners-up, for his work in \"The Jolson Story.\"\n\nOn September 15th, Ed Sullivan, writing in his syndicated column, included this tidbit: \"Starmaker W. Wanger testing Film Daily poll winner, Scotty Beckett for one of the young brothers in Bergman's 'Joan of Lorraine.' \"\n\nOn October 26th, the Chicago Sunday Tribune reported the following: \"Fourteen years is a long time to have been in movies - especially if you're only 18! But that's the story of Scotty Beckett, who divides his time equally on work before the cameras, sophomore studies at the University of Southern California, and tinkering on his souped up car. Scotty (or Scott Hastings, to be formal) considers himself a 'professional son,' because so many of his performances on the screen have been in the role of sons, ranging from his first appearance at 3 as the offspring of Otto Kruger and Ann Harding in 'Gallant Lady' to the child of Cary Grant and Irene Dunn in 'My Favorite Wife.' And naturally he played the young boy in 'My Son, My Son!' His reel life parents number well over a hundred.\n\n\"Among his other roles, Scotty has portrayed many stars 'as a boy,' including Jon Hall, Don Ameche, Robert Cummings, and Louis Hayward, climaxing the series as young Jolson in 'The Jolson Story.' ('I don't really sing - they dubbed in the voice,' he hastens to explain.) Young movie fans remember Scotty as Peggy Ann Garner's date in 'Junior Miss' and as the other man in 'Cynthia,' with Elizabeth Taylor. He recently finished 'The Difficult Years.'\n\n\"Movies are a secondary career with Beckett, now very much tied up with classes and extracurricular activities at U.S.C., where he is majoring in business administration and is a member of the naval R.O.T.C. Now he is too engrossed with school to think much about his ambitions, but he is sure about one thing - after his appearance in 'The Jolson Story' Scotty has high hopes of growing up to look like Larry Parks!\"\n\nOn October 31st, Scotty appeared on the KMPC radio program Teen And Twenty Time.\n\nOn December 4th, Sheilah Graham, writing in her syndicated column, reported that Scotty was set to work in the upcoming \"A Date With Judy.\"\n\nCynthia (role: Will Parker)\n\nprem.

He played the part of Jolson, as a boy, in the flicker. Now he's over 6 feet tall, still growing.\"\n\nOn February 22nd, Ed Sullivan wrote about Heart Night At The Copacabana, which \"played until 3:30 A.M. and paraded the top stars of Broadway and Hollywood under the blinding spell of one Milton Berle.\" Scotty was among those assisting \"choral disciplinarian\" Tony Canzoneri.\n\nOn February 29th, Ed Sullivan reported that Scotty was \"back to the coast.\"\n\nOn March 4th, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported that Scotty won the title role in \"Michael O'Halloran,' which was due to begin shooting on March 15th.\n\nOn March 9th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Scotty would probably be reprising his role from \"The Jolson Story\" in the upcoming production of \"The Babe Ruth Story.\" This, however, never materialized.\n\nOn April 29th, Scotty appeared on the MBS radio program Family Theater in an episode called Their Only Son.\n\nOn June 26th, Hedda Hopper reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Scotty Beckett and Father Harold Fitzgerald became friends during the shooting of 'Michael O'Halloran.' When Father Fitzgerald, who is a teacher at Loyola High School, underwent a very serious eye operation, it was Scotty who drove him to the hospital and took care of him during his stay there.\"\n\nSometime during this year, a 78rpm single was released on the BRT label. The A-side (BT1000A) was a song called \"Judaline\" performed by Scotty Beckett and The Melodiers. It was featured in the film \"A Date With Judy,\" but this was a different version. The B-side (BT1000B) was called \"Bop Goes My Heart\" and performed by Scotty Beckett and The Buddy Bergman Trio.\n\nOn August 6th, the Salt Lake Telegram (UT) reported the following: \"Easiest way to get a poke in the nose is to tell Scotty Beckett to be himself. 'I've been trying for 15 years,' he sighs, 'and I am only 19 now. But at last I've succeeded.' The young actor refers to 'A Date With Judy,' in which he portrays a teen-age boy of an average American family who likes music and girls. He doesn't have to pretend he is a well-known personality as a child or be anything but what he is. 'I have a face that seems to resemble the baby pictures of every star in Hollywood,' he points out. Scotty isn't imagining things, either. In the 15 years since his screen bow he has been Louis Hayward as a small boy in 'My Son, My Son,' John Hall as a fledgling in 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,' Robert Cummings as a young sprout in 'King's Row,' Don Ameche in short pants for 'Heaven Can Wait,' and the adolescent Al Jolson in 'The Jolson Story.' Scotty has been acting on the screen since he was 4 years old. A native Californian, he made his screen debut in the 'Our Gang' comedies, grew up on studio lots, has appeared in more than 40 films, and can boast one of the 'hottest' collections of boogie-woogie recordings in town.\"\n\nOn September 24th, The National City News (CA) reported that Scotty had attended something called the Hi-Debber Jamboree in that city.\n\nOn October 21st, Scotty again appeared on the MBS radio program Family Theater, this time in an episode called The Story Of John Sager.\n\nThere is some indication that Scotty may have been under contract with MGM at this time. He certainly appeared in more of their films than anybody else's during this period.\n\nOn October 23rd, Citizen-News columnist Sidney Skolsky's Movie Boner of the Week was as follows: \"The Best Movie Boner is from Neil Gordon of New York who writes that in 'A Date With Judy,' Scotty Beckett portrays a character called Oggie(sic) Prindle. There's a scene in the picture in which Scotty Beckett wears a sweater with the initils S.B. instead of O.P. on it.&quot On November 2nd, Skolsky reported that Neil Gordon had been wrong about the previous week's Movie Boner: \"The readers...insist that in the picture it was evident that Scotty Beckett, attending Santa Barbara High School, was a letterman and therefore entitled to have on his sweater the initials 'SB.' \"\n\nOn October 27th, Hedda Hopper reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Hearing that Peggy Ann Garner was going to elope with Scotty Beckett, I called to check. She laughed like any 16-year-old, and said, 'His girl friend would be mighty put out if that happened. I have a boy friend, but we're not eloping.\"\n\nOn November 6th and 7th, Scotty took part in the First Annual Lamont Fall Festival, crowning the winner of the Queen's award and escorting her during the festival and also on her trip to Hollywood shortly thereafter. He was also scheduled to do some sort of singing and dancing routine at the festival.\n\nOn December 14th, Scotty won a role in the upcoming Clark Gable/Myrna Loy film \"Any Number Can Play.\"\n\nOn December 20th, Scotty was arrested on a drunk-driving charge, which ultimately resulted in the payment of a fine. On December 24th, Danton Walker of the Daily News of New York speculated the following: \"Scotty Beckett's front page antics (drunken driving charge) may cost him an MGM build-up. He was set for the role of Clark Gable's son in 'Any Number Can Play.' \" However, on December 25th, Ed Sullivan revealed the following in his syndicated column: \"Dear Boss - Metro Producer Arthur Freed, Mervin Le Roy and Clark Gable agreed completely with your analysis of the Scotty Beckett accident. He gets the role of Gable's son in Clark's next flicker. The wire from Clark: 'Have talked to Arthur and Mervin and they have assured me Scotty set for part, as everyone here is in sympathy with the boy. Merry Christmas, Clark.' Then on December 29th, Sheilah Graham shared the following in her syndicated column: \"Good news for Scotty Beckett! After the 19-year-old former child star was arrested on a charge of drunkenness, I checked to see whether Clark Gable would still want him to play his son in 'Any Number Can Play.' 'Of course,' said producer Mervin Le Roy. 'It is the poor kid's first offense.' Now it is up to Scotty to justify this sympathy and keep his nose clean.\"\n\nPantomime Quiz episode (appearance)\n\nMay 16, 1948 - KTLA - 30 min. - TV episode\n\nThis program was still being aired locally in Los Angeles, becoming a network show the following year.\n\nA Date With Judy (role: Ogden \"Oogie\" Pringle)\n\nJuly 29, 1948 - MGM - 113 min. - feature\n\nFilmed around Dec. 1947 to Feb. 1948. ©June 29, 1948.

She received $5750 in lieu of alimony. She and Beckett were married in Las Vegas Sept. 28, 1949. The final decree was entered at Beckett's request, presumably because Miss Baker is now playing in European tennis tournaments.
