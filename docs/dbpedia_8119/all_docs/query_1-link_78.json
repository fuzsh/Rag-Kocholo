        "text": "Manny P. here…\n\nThe James A. Michener Art Museum in Pennsylvania is having a gr and opening of From Philadelphia to Monaco: Grace Kelly Beyond the Icon. The exhibition will run from October 28th – January 26th, 2014.\n\nThis exhibit traces the unique path of the iconic actress took, inviting viewers to discover the life of Grace Kelly (1929-1982) beyond the fairy tale. It brings us up close to the stage and screen legend, fashion icon, princess, United Nations advocate for children, and international spokesperson for arts and culture. Muse of director Alfred Hitchcock and winner of an Oscar for Best Actress in The Country Girl, Kelly left Hollywood to become Grace of Monaco upon her marriage to Prince Rainier III on April 18th, 1956.\n\nFor those interested in Grace Kelly’s life before she became an actress and want to explore beyond the Michener Art Museum’s upcoming exhibit, your first stop should really be in East Falls. There you can see the Kelly family home, Grace’s former school, the site of her first theatrical performance, and the family church. While many of these sites are spread out over the East Falls neighborhood, area visitors can look to the East Falls Historical Society for guidance.\n\nDrawing from Grace Kelly’s personal objects housed in the archives of the Palace of Monaco, the display illustrates her life through letters, photographs, awards, couture fashion, and other personal artifacts, as well as film clips, playbills, home movies, and souvenirs from her acting career. The exhibition is produced by the Grimaldi Forum Monaco and McCord Museum, based on a display at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.\n\nhttp://www.michenerartmuseum.org/visit/ticketing-Grace-Kelly.php\n\nGenerous support is provided by Bucks County Conference and Visitors Bureau, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco, and the Princess Grace Foundation.

The Western boasts other additional influential supporters, including Warren Beatty and Woody Allen, who called Shane one of his favorite American films, and praised its poetry and elegant flow.\n\nConsidered by Allen to be veteran producer-director George Stevens’s masterpiece, it marked the filmmaker’s first foray into color. Shot on location near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the movie’s rich Technicolor cinematography captures the panorama of the frontier during a crucial moment in sagebrush mythology, when civilization was encroaching on the seemingly endless wilderness.\n\nTo honor this Paramount Pictures production’s 60th anniversary, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will screen the iconic flick on Monday, October 7th at the Samuel Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills. It’s part of the George Stevens Lecture Series. The theater is located at 8949 Wilshire Blvd., and you can currently pick up tickets for a modest $5 per cost ($3 if you are an Academy member) online or by mail. Here’s the link if you want to purchase passes to this wonderful event.\n\nhttp://sa1.seatadvisor.com/sabo/servlets/EventSearch?presenter=AMPAS&venue=OSCARS-LINWOOD,OSCARS-GOLDWYN,OSCARS-HIGHLAND,ACADEMY,ACADEMYLAB\n\nEnjoy possibly the finest Western produced in the 1950s, which starred Alan Ladd, Van Heflin, Jean Arthur, and the Oscar-nominated performances of Jack Palance and Br andon de Wilde. It was adapted from Jack Schaefer’s successful 1949 novel.\n\nCue the opening theme…\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nJust before tearing down an old barn in New Hampshire in 2006, a contractor discovered a treasure: seven reels of film that he donated to the Keene State College Film Archives. At least four of those films were considered lost, including Their First Misunderst anding, a 1911 silent short film featuring silent movie star Mary Pickford appearing in her first credited role.\n\nThis production is considered a game changer because the two-reeler helped establish Pickford into becoming the first female star of the Silent Era. Her contracts were central in shaping the Hollywood industry. Before that, film moguls didn’t desire that actors become household names because of this very real fear concerning cinematic budgets. Eventually known as America’s Sweetheart, Pickford co-founded the independent film studio, United Artists, and she was one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In addition to her Best Actress Oscar for Coquette, Mary Pickford received an Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1976.\n\nPickford, then 18, had been known as Little Mary in films. The screenplay was the first written by the actress. The Library of Congress is funding the film’s restoration, and it will be screened at the New Hampshire college on October 11th. MARY PICKFORD ———–>\n\nThis gem compliments so-called lost Alfred Hitchcock silent films touring the country. What makes the Pickford-restoration so vital is 90% of the movies made before 1930 are considered gone.\n\nThe New Hampshire contractor has been invited to the screening. He is expected to attend.\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nThe producers of the 65th Emmy Awards plan on paying tribute this evening to the 50th anniversary of two seminal moments in television history: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22nd, 1963, and the Beatles’ appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9th, 1964. The Emmy segment will explore the tie between them.\n\nAnother segment honoring the passing of creative contributors to the small screen has baby boomers up-in-arms. An extended tribute to the untimely passing of Cory Monteith of Glee will be included with this past year’s deaths of Jean Stapleton, Jonathan Winters, and creator of Family Ties, Gary David Goldberg. This additional segment will compliment the typical In Memoriam moment that has become common during award shows. Yet, the complaint by family and friends of the late Jack Klugman, Larry Hagman, and Charles Durning are crying fowl. Cory Monteith was never nominated for an Emmy during his short television career; yet, Klugman and Hagman are considered pioneers of Television’s Golden Age.\n\nJACK KLUGMAN LARRY HAGMAN CHARLES DURNING\n\nJack Klugman was recognized for his work on several television programs dating back to 1961, including his body of work on The Odd Couple and Quincy M.E. Klugman also was memorable in four iconic episodes of The Twilight Zone. He also found work on such television shows as Actor’s Studio, The Philco Television Playhouse, and garnered an Emmy for his role in The Defenders.\n\nLarry Hagman broke ground for his role as J.R. Ewing in Dallas, and in the genre of situation comedy, in I Dream of Jeannie. Charles Durning was nominated for eight Emmys during his illustrious career, and also had a co-starring role for several seasons on Evening Shade.\n\nThe extraordinary popularity of Glee, coupled with the bean-counter mentality by the Emmy producers in search for a younger demographic, has been cited by the detractors as the reason for this grievous omission during this evenings program. Family members of these pioneers of television have displayed real outrage at the planned festivities.\n\nOutliving your fan-base should never be a reason to be forgotten… or at least omitted from added consideration in my personal estimation. Either way, there is no glee in Mudtown over the obviously youth-centric corporate decision at the 65th Emmy Awards.\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nBob Newhart, among television’s most enduring stars with shows stretching back over five decades, openly wept as he finally captured his first Emmy. The 84-year old talent was honored at Sunday’s creative arts Emmy ceremony for his guest role last season on The Big Bang Theory as Professor Proton, whose silly character was a former host of a children’s science show.\n\nNoted for his straight deadpan and stammering delivery, Newhart came to prominence in the 1960s when his record album of comedic monologues, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, became a worldwide bestseller, and reached number one on Billboard Magazine’s pop album chart. It remains the 20th best-selling comedy album in history. Newhart’s success in st and-up led to his own NBC variety show in 1961.\n\nBob Newhart’s small screen history includes the 1970s The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart in the next decade, and Bob in the 1990s… and six previous nominations. His variety series, The Bob Newhart Show, earned a writing bid in 1961.\n\nNewhart has been in a number of popular films, beginning with the 1962 war story, Hell Is for Heroes, starring Steve McQueen. His movies have ranged from 1970’s Barbra Streis and musical On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, the 1971 Norman Lear comedy Cold Turkey, the Mike Nichols-directed war satire Catch 22, to the 2003 Will Ferrell holiday comedy Elf.\n\nKudos to one of my favorite television personalities… Mr. Bob Newhart!\n\n————————————————————–\n\nSon of Forgotten Hollywood Forgotten History has just been added to it’s 42nd literary branch. It’s housed in the Long Beach Public Library in Southern California. This is the 103rd overall library that carries one of my paperbacks in the Forgotten Hollywood Book Series.\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nThe organizers of the Golden Globes say they will honor Woody Allen for his contributions to filmmaking. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has announced Allen will receive the 2014 Cecil B. DeMille Award.\n\nA tribute to the 77-year-old actor, writer, and director will be included in the 71st annual Golden Globes ceremony set for January 12th. Morgan Freeman and Martin Scorsese are among the previous recipients.\n\nWoody Allen was initially hired as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, earning $25 a week. As a teen, Woody started writing scripts for The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, and other television programs. The talented scribe began penning articles and cartoon captions for magazines such as The New Yorker; inspired by the tradition of prominent New Yorker humorists, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley, S.J. Perelman, and particularly, Max Shulman, whose material he modernized.\n\nHe became a successful Broadway playwright and wrote Don’t Drink the Water in 1966. The next play he created was Play It Again, Sam, which he also starred. Woody Allen’s much-honored cinematic gems include Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Midnight in Paris, which won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for its screenplay in 2011. It was announced in February, 2012 that Allen would adapt Bullets Over Broadway into a Broadway musical scheduled to open in 2013. WOODY ALLEN\n\nWhat a great honor for the immensely talented funnyman. And, so it goes…\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nJames Bond Bingo\n\nThe most popular British spy and the UK’s favorite game in one card!\n\nWhen we talk about iconic film franchises, the first thing that pops to mind is James Bond. The series of 007 spy films made its mark from its first installment (Dr. No in 1962) up to the last (Skyfall in 2012), delivering unpredictable plots and exciting action sequences. The character is well-loved by audiences worldwide, especially in the UK. If you remember, the Queen was a part of the Skyfall promotion in last year’s London Olympics. According to the latest reports, it’s the second highest grossing motion picture series, next to Harry Potter.\n\nThe fan base of the 007 series spans generations, so it’s only a matter of time before someone comes up with various ways of appreciating the films, such as through James Bond Bingo. The combination of Bond cinema and bingo is inevitable. It’s the favorite pastime in the UK, as evidenced in the number of bingo halls like London Palace, the fastest-growing network of bingo clubs around the UK; and the increasing online gamers of FoxyBingo.com. Film buffs have incorporated 007 into the game. The excitement of a James Bond movie marathon, plus the thrill of completing a row on your bingo card is a double whammy. Just for the heck of it, don’t just shout bingo when you’re done Bond Bingo sounds much better.\n\nA 007 fanatic put together items which should be included in your James Bond bingo card. Suggestions from Purple 13: a panoramic view of London, a new spy gadget, exterior shot of an exotic location, dinner in a fancy restaurant, and a very obvious product sales pitch. And, special appearances of important characters in the movie should also be noted, like M and Q, or a cameo by Michael Wilson, who is co-producer of the James Bond movies. Some interesting 007 scenes should also be included, like the following: Bond drives a sports car, Bond attempts a daring escape, Bond kisses a beautiful woman, and Bond kills a bad guy.\n\nThis is a fascinating trend that has shaken-not-stirred the gaming community, worldwide!\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nOrganizers in Roger Ebert’s hometown announced plans Tuesday to raise $125,000 to build a life-size statue of the late famed film critic. The statue would go in front of Champaign’s Virginia Theatre, home to the EbertFest film fest. Ebert, a Pulitzer Prize-winning motion picture reviewer and television personality, grew up in nearby Urbana, and attended the University of Illinois.\n\nThe sculpture will show the famed movie critic sitting in a movie theater chair giving his signature thumbs up. Famed artist Rick Harney of Bloomington will design the sculpture. Ebert’s widow, Chaz, will work with Harney on the memorial.\n\nAlong with a nationally syndicated Chicago Sun-Times column, Ebert became famous hosting a television movie review show with fellow critic Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune. Organizers hope to have the sculpture ready to unveil and dedicate at next year’s EbertFest in April. Ebert died last April in Chicago after a battle with cancer.\n\n———————————————————-\n\nWith October just around the corner, expect a slew of upcoming scary movie screenings. The Old Towne Music Hall at 140 Richmond St. in El Segundo, CA provides a month-long array of weekend chillers. Here’s the schedule:\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nOn Friday, September 20th and Saturday, September 21st, 2013, Julien’s Auctions will host a l andmark auction event with the sale of The Personal Property, Antiques and Memorabilia from the Estate of Bob and Dolores Hope. The auction contains items from Hope’s more than sixty year career in entertainment, including Vaudeville, film, stage performances, television specials, and entertaining the troops for the USO. Memorabilia from Bob’s personal passion for golf, awards, and other artifacts from his many celebrity friends is also represented in this sale.\n\nBob and Dolores Hope shared a 69-year marriage during which they raised a family, and lived in their Toluca Lake and beautiful Palm Springs homes. Property from both homes will be auctioned, including the Hopes’ collection of antiques and artwork. Highlights of the sale include: a photo inscribed to Hope by President John Kennedy, Hope’s personal golf cart, a People’s Choice award, a Red Skelton clown painting, furniture, decorative arts, and other keepsakes from the careers and life of Bob and Dolores Hope.\n\nThe exhibition opened, yesterday, to the public at the Julien’s Beverly Hills Gallery until Friday, September 29th. Please join Julien’s as Bob Hope and Dolores continue to touch the lives of their fans.\n\n——————————————————————–\n\nCal Worthington, who built his fortune from a series of West Coast auto dealerships, and became a television fixture, thanks to his folksy car lot commercials urging patrons to Go see Cal, has died. At one point, Worthington owned more than 23 dealerships in five states.\n\nBorn Nov. 27, 1920, Worthington joined the Army and became a B-17 bomber pilot, flying 29 missions over Germany, and earning the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was presented to him by Jimmy Doolittle, and other honors. After the war, Cal continued to fly a variety of aircraft, including a Lear 35, a twin-engine jet that he based at his sprawling ranch, which is a large producer of almonds and olives.\n\nThe Oklahoma native founded his first dealership in the late 1940s in Southern California, and quickly took advantage of broadcast advertising. Early on, he entered the field of television advertising, buying time for a three-hour live country music show every Saturday and Sunday on KTLA, which eventually was entitled Cal’s Corral.\n\nAs his business empire grew to other western states and Alaska, Worthington starred in a series of television and radio spots that featured him in his ever-present big white cowboy hat and his dog Spot — which would turn out to be animals ranging from tigers to elephants. He also wrestled a bear, rode a hippopotamus and a pig, h andled a snake, and he almost had his h and bit by a lion. Viewers frequently saw him trying to st and on his head, including a stint atop the upper wing of a biplane. He also said he would eat a bug to sell one of his vehicles. All of the nonsensical good fun was set to a banjo tune with the refrain, Go see Cal, go see Cal, go see Cal. CAL WORTHINGTON\n\nAccording to the Television Bureau of Advertising, the car dealer was probably the best known pitchman in television history. The indefatigable Cal Worthington was 92.\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nA Lake Tahoe resort once owned by Frank Sinatra, and frequented by his Rat Pack buddies, is about to undergo a major makeover. The Cal Neva hotel-casino straddling the California-Nevada border will close for more than a year beginning Monday to allow for the multi-million-dollar renovation project. The 219-room, 10-story hotel, and 6,000-square-foot casino will be upgraded in an effort to revitalize the property. A Napa Valley-based development company acquired the Cal Neva in April.\n\nDuring its heyday from 1960-1963, the resort was owned by Sinatra, and fellow Rat Pack clan members Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford often stayed at the locale. They made a number of movies together, including Oceans 11, Sergeants 3, 4 for Texas, and Robin and the 7 Hoods. Stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and Juliet Prowse also vacationed there. In fact, Monroe spent her final weekend at the Cal Neva before she died of a drug overdose in Los Angeles in August, 1962. RAT PACK (w/ Lucy Ball & Danny Thomas)\n\nThe Cal Neva is one of Nevada’s first legal casinos. The present resort was built in 1937, when a fire destroyed the original lodge that opened in 1926. Sinatra renovated the villa, adding the celebrity showroom and a helicopter pad on the roof. He used tunnels to shuffle mobsters and celebrities beneath the resort so they wouldn’t be seen by the general public. The tunnels were built in the late 1920s so liquor could be smuggled in during Prohibition. Sinatra’s gambling license was stripped in 1963 by Nevada gambling regulators after Chicago mobster Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises.\n\nOwners plan to make the hotel a 4-star resort by upgrading rooms with modern amenities, larger bathrooms, and bigger windows offering Lake Tahoe views. Plans call for the redesigned casino to include blackjack and other table games. Public tours of the cabins and tunnels will resume after the project is completed. They hope to reopen the Cal Neva on December 12th, 2014, which would have been Frank Sinatra’s 99th birthday.\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nThe Art Deco Society of Los Angeles will be taking its 30th Annual Hollywood Forever Cemetery Walking Tour on October 5th. Join them as they visit the graves of Hollywood pioneers, stars and movie moguls; folks who created Hollywood, and ones who put the town on the map. Postmortem stargazing will include Cecil B. DeMille, as well as glittering stars of the silver screen: Rudolph Valentino, Fay Wray, Tyrone Power, Marion Davies, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and more.\n\nGuided walking tours will depart from the fountain inside the main gate of 6000 Santa Monica Blvd. every 20 minutes, between 10 a.m. until 12 noon. It’s a 2½ hour tour, so sensible walking shoes, water, and sunscreen are recommended. Tickets are $20 per person for non-members, free to members, in advance (or at the cemetery on the day of the tour).\n\nThis annual tour is the best way to get a true feel of Hollywood’s Golden Age.\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nSir David Frost was a renowned journalist, writer, comedian, and media personality. He attended Cambridge University, where he became the editor of the campus newspaper, Varsity, and a literary magazine called Granta. Graduating from Cambridge, Frost worked for Anglia Television where he honed his television and journalistic skills. SIR DAVID FROST——————>\n\nIn 1962, Frost was selected as host of a satirical comedy show on the BBC. The program was called That Was the Week that Was, and it aired for two seasons. Frost carried the show in a very irreverent fashion, which lampooned politics, society, and the television industry. John Cleese and Graham Chapman, founding members of Monthy Python’s Flying Circus, wrote for the show.\n\nDavid Frost may be best known for his 1977 interview of disgraced President Nixon. An interviewer, producer, and author, Frost made small-screen history by conducting the only televised interview in which Richard Nixon discussed Watergate, and the former president acknowledged he had disappointed the American people. Syndicated on a barter basis, the interviews were broadcast in seventy countries. Peter Morgan (The Last King of Scotl and, The Queen) created the Tony-winning play, Frost/Nixon, based on his interviews. Morgan also penned the adaptation for the 2008 movie. Ron Howard directed the Oscar-nominated motion picture.\n\nIn 1970, Frost was made an officer in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He was subsequently knighted in 1993 by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nSir David Frost died suddenly of a heart attack while on the cruise ship MS Queen Elizabeth, and engaged as a guest speaker during a planned working holiday. The genial talent was 74.\n\nUntil next time> “never forget”\n\nManny P. here…\n\nLabor Day Weekend ’13 has been memorable in the Forgotten Hollywood journey for a number of reasons. In addition to having another stint at CINECON, in which I sold scores of paperbacks from my book series, I set up a Holiday booksigning on December 7th at the Hollywood Heritage Museum.\n\nI also met a child star from Hollywood’s Golden Age, Marilyn Knowlden, who is a devout supporter of my literary work. Knowlden had a ten-year movie career in which she played the cinematic daughter of iconic stars such as Claudette Colbert, Katharine Hepburn, and Norma Shearer. Marilyn captured roles in The Cisco Kid, David Copperfield, Anthony Adverse, Marie Antoinette, Little Women, Les Miserables, and Angels with Dirty Faces. MARILYN KNOWLDEN ——>\n\nThe total capper came by way of an e-mail. Son of Forgotten Hollywood Forgotten History is to receive a Gold Medal from the Readers’ Favorite Award Contest.
