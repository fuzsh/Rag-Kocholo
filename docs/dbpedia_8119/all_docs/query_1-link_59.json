        "text": "This is the story of Jane Soper, written by Mrs. Soper and edited by Lois Ribovich.\n\nJane is all dressed up. The photo was taken around 1925.\n\nJane Black's graduation photo. She graduated in the class of 1940 from Ralston High School, which is no longer in existence.\n\nThey say everyone has a story they would like to tell. This is my story, Jane Black Soper.\n\nI was born in Canadaigua, NY on February 20, 1922.\n\nPictured are members of the Girl Scouts who marched in the 150th Anniversary of Ralston (1987). Mary Jean Black Soper, Jean Knowlden Wall, Marian Twist Micklitsch, Geraldine Wilkinson Boyer, Myrtle Twist Larson Bell\n\nI moved to Ralston in 1924, my father worked for the railroad and was transferred to the Ralston Railroad yard. At that time, it was a large railroad complex, machine shop, etc.\n\nIt was a place trains turned around. There was a ramp where coal trucks backed up and dumped coal onto the trains for fuel. There was also a water tank to fill the engines.\n\nMyself and my husband Jerry at a Ralston School Reunion held in Cascade Picnic grounds in 1974. They were married for over 40 years before he passed away.\n\nBucky Buckwalter was named Grand Marshall of the 175th Anniversary of Ralston and I was named Mayor for the Day. We rode in the parade.\n\nJane in the center with her two girls, Marilyn Route on the left and Bonnie Bryan on the right at a recent Ralston School Reunion.\n\nI'm proud of my growing family. In this photo are my children, Jeremy Soper, Debra Holmes, and Marilyn Route. Standing with me in the back from the left is Kevin Route, grandson; Denny Route, grandson; Bonnie Bryan, daughter; myself; and Jim Bryan, son-in-law.\n\nMy family recently welcomed the fifth generation. I am pictured with my great, great grandson, Holden. In the back is my daughter (Holden's great grandmother) Marilyn Route, his mother and my great granddaughter, Kristin Route, and my grandson, Denny Route, Holden's grandfather.\n\nIn 1937, Ralston's First Centennial, I worked in a hot dog stand with my parents for the PTA (above)."
