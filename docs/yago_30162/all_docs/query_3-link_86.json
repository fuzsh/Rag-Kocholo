        "text": "Amid rain showers of good luck, Princess Noriko of Takamado was married to Kunimaro Senge at the Izumo Taisha grand shrine in Shimane Prefecture yesterday. The smiling bride arrived at the shrine early yesterday morning in a mint green suit and a coordinating hat with flared brim and square crown wrapped in a large silk bow.\n\nFor the wedding ceremony, the 26-year old princess wore a traditional silk costume and a hairstyle that I can only imagine is steeped in symbolic tradition as well. (If anyone can provide further explanation, it would be most welcome).\n\nI believe the only members of the Imperial family in attendance were the bride’s mother, Princess Hisako, and sisters, Princess Tsuguko, and Princess Ayako- all three women wore traditional kimonos, seen below.\n\nAccording to Japanese law, Noriko lost her royal title and membership in the Imperial family with her marriage today and officially became “Mrs. Noriko Senge”. The Japan Times reports that the couple will host 300 friends and family at a wedding reception in Matsue on Monday, while Crown Prince Naruhito, Crown Princess Masako and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be among the guests at a dinner party to be held at a Tokyo hotel on Wednesday.\n\nBecause this wedding ceremony is so different to those we’re used to seeing in the west, I am curious to hear your thoughts (and gently remind everyone to remain culturally respectful in your comments). I’m sure you all join me in wishing Noriko much happiness in her new life."
