        "text": "TOKYO -- Prince Norihito, nephew of Emperor Hirohito and ninth in line to the Japanese throne, has announced his intention to marry a commoner, a spokesman said today.\n\nNorihito, 29, youngest son of the emperor's youngest brother, Prince Mikasa, will marry Hisako Tottori, 31, possibly before the end of the year, an agency spokesman said.\n\nThe marriage of members of the imperial family to commoners, once a rarity, has become fairly common in recent years.\n\nCrown Prince Akihito, eldest son of the emperor and heir apparent to the Chrysanthemum throne, shocked some members of the 2,600-year-old dynasty by marrying a commoner 25 years ago. His wife, Crown Princess Michiko is expected to become the first common-born empress in Japanese history.\n\nThe engagement will be announced officially after approval at a meeting of the imperial family council Aug. 1, the spokesman said.\n\nNorihito, a graduate of Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, works with the Japan Foundation, a semi-governmental international exchange organization, according to an agency announcement.\n\nHis fiancee, a graduate of Cambridge University in England, is a free-lance Japanese-English translator who often works for members of the imperial family.\n\nThe daughter of Shigejiro Tottori, managing director of the Toho Bussan Kaisha trading company, she met the young prince at a Canadian Embassy reception last April, the agency said."
