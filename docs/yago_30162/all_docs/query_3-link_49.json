        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II marries Prince Philip 70 years ago\n\nThe love story of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh has enthralled the British public ever since their wedding nearly seven decades ago on November 20 1947.\n\nIn fact, the Queen and Prince Philip are officially the longest married British royal couple in history. The long line of royal weddings is often marred by divorce, death and beheadings.\n\nBut lasting this long in marriage is not unique to our Queen, and there are several other similar love stories in other royal families around the world.\n\nQueen Anne of Romania and King Michael I – 68 years\n\nIn November 1947, exiled King Michael I of Romania met the beautiful Anne Marguerite while visiting London for the wedding of then Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nThe two became infatuated with each other and continued to meet on chaperoned outings in London until Michael plucked the courage to propose.\n\nThe royal nuptials were held on June 19 1948, in the gilded throne room of the Royal Palace in Athens, Greece.\n\nKing Michael and his Queen have five daughters together, all of whom have married and have children of their own.\n\nQueen Anne sadly died at the age of 92, in a hospital in Switzerland on August 1 2016.\n\nREAD MORE: THE QUEEN AND PHILIP’S ROYAL MARRIAGE IN PICTURES\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It included a foolproof prenuptial agreement on Bernard’s role in the royal family.\n\nJuliana and Bernhard married on January 7 1937, after the Prince shed his German nationality and became a naturalised Dutch citizen.\n\nTheir first-born daughter, Princess Beatrix, took the throne after Queen Juliana abdicated in 1980.\n\nThrough the mid-1990s, the Queen struggled with illness and eventually succumbed to Alzheimer’s Disease. She died in March 2004.\n\nPrince Bernhard died soon after in December 2004, after losing his battle with cancer.\n\nKing Albert II of Belgium and Queen Paola – 60 years\n\nKing Albert II, the sixth king of Belgium, was smitten when he first met the breathtaking Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria in 1958.\n\nRecounting how the two first met at the Belgian Embassy in Italy, Queen Paola said: \"We were both shy, so we only talked a little.”\n\nWe were both shy, so we only talked a little\n\nQueen Paola of Belgium\n\nThe couple finally overcame their shyness when Albert proposed to his wife-to-be. The Belgian public was quickly swayed by the engagement.\n\nAlbert and Paola initially planned to marry in the Vatican, but after some deliberation and pressure from the public, they chose to marry in Brussels in 1959.\n\nThe King and Queen have two sons and daughter together, and an astonishing 12 grandchildren.\n\nThe Belgian King abdicated in 2013, passing on the reins to his son Philippe, and continues to live happily with his wife.\n\nREAD MORE: QUEEN PAOLA OF BELGIUM IN PICTURES\n\nEmperor Hirohito of Japan and Princess Nagano Kuni – 65 years\n\nThe 124th emperor of Japan, played a controversial role in World War Two with his faithful Empress Kojun by his side.\n\nOn January 26, 1924, Hirohito married his distant cousin Princess Nagano Kuni.\n\nTogether the couple had a total of two sons and five daughters who all outlived their parents.\n\nFollowing his death in 1989, Emperor Hirohito was succeeded by his son Akito.\n\nThe Empress outlived her husband till 2000 when she died at the age of 97, and was laid to rest next to the Emperor within the Musashi Imperial Graveyard."
