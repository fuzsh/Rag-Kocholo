        "text": "Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 33\n\nThank you very much, Alex and Diak, for the information. Now pulling together all of these books...I had a good laugh at the \"This is the Byzantine way--get used to it!\" I'm finding this out more and more. As I learn more and more, I find I have to refer to more and more books! Heck, even at Liturgy, I have to go between 2 or 3 books: for the readings, then the Tropars, etc. (if a feast day or proper), and then the \"Divine Liturgy of +St. J.C.\" 'missal'. It makes it very difficult to bless yourself when your fingers are stuck in a book trying to hold your place! Lots of paper cuts to the forehead!\n\nThanks again you guys! Sorry I haven't written back for a bit. Vacation and new job have occupied my time. I also lost my place of where I posted these questions. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...\n\nPeace and prayers,\n\nRich\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 348\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by Orthodox Catholic:\n\nUkraine was historically a \"holding tank\" for all sorts of sects, including the Socinians!\n\nThese groups were not persecuted in Ukraine, there was plenty of wheat and bread to go around and they were left alone.\n\nIt has little to do with Ukraine as such. It\n\nwas general characteristics of all the Commonwealth of Both Nations (Polish Crown and\n\nGreat Principality of Lithuania united in one state).\n\nQuote\n\nEven the Pochaiv Lavra at one time published the Old Believer liturgical and catechetical books (see Met. Ilarion Ohienko's work on the Lavra where he includes an entire list of these books).\n\nBasilians of Suprasl Lavra printed many books for\n\nOld Believers too.\n\nQuote\n\nThe Old Believers had quite the devotion to the three-bar Orthodox Cross and believed, unlike the Niconian Church, that this was the only valid Cross. They regarded the one-bar Cross as \"Latin Chrismo.\" In Ukraine, no one was going to argue with them over what kind of Cross they preferred!\n\nThe story is more complex: Old Believers' cross\n\nmust be not only three-bar, but also \"vosmikoniechnyi\" (a cross with 8 \"ends\").\n\nUkrainian three-bar crosses often have 7 \"ends\".\n\nQuote\n\nCertainly, not only Andrew Sheptytsky, but Patriarch Joseph the Confessor also promoted the Old Rite within the Ukrainian Catholic Church and the Patriarch was accepted as the spiritual pastor of a number of Old Believer groups in Siberia - he made mention of this several times when he got out of captivity.\n\nVery interesting. Could you tell more about it or/and provide a source?\n\nQuote\n\nFor the Patriarch, his Church was not only for Ukrainians, but was the Church of Kyivan-Rus' that includes Belarusyns, Russians, Siberians, Old Believers etc.\n\nWe Ukrainian Catholics have lost this vision in our self-imposed ethnic limitations.\n\nSo we have to regain that vision as soon as possible!\n\nHowever, \"Belarusyns\" don't exist, but \"BYELARUSY\"\n\ncertainly do!\n\nSincerely,\n\nsubdeacon Peter\n\n[ 06-28-2002: Message edited by: Piotr Siwicki ]\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 33\n\nHee hee hee!!! Subdeacon Randolph, If I had a swiveling analogion, I'd either break it, send books flying, or hurt myself (or others).\n\nNow here's my next question, sort of on subject, but dealing with the liturgy itself. I was visiting my parents in VA, and attended the little Ukrainian Catholic Church there. They had a very basic Ukrainian Divine Liturgy Book, and also the Ruthenian Divine Liturgy book. They said the main prayers from the Ukrainian, the topars and other propers from the Ruthenian, and then prayed parts in Old Slavonic, also taken from the Ruthenian book. Is it permissable to do this? I read the Ukrainian tropars, etc. and compared them to the ones in the Ruthenian book, and while the translations are essentially the same, the wording, in some cases, is very different. Could you please help me out and explain this to me? Or is this a more \"relaxed\" Ukrainian parish/priest (it was very small, the nave of the church was about the size of a large living room!)\n\nThanks!\n\nRich\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 7,461\n\nLikes: 1\n\nRich, that's the 10,000 hryvni question. It's mix and match time, baby! In some Ukrainian parishes, the only English translations for propers other than regular weekdays, the Eight Resurrectional Tones and panakhyda that anyone has access to are Ruthenian sources such as the Byzantine Seminary Press (Pittsburgh) translations or the Uniontown Basilian translations. In the UGCC there is no uniformity in usage of propers, with only some uniformity in the Eight Resurrectional Tones, weekday propers and Panakhyda. Even these have variations, for example the Eparchy of Parma has its own English Divine Liturgy book which has many propers translated in their own version. Also in Canada some parishes have their own English versions, such as St. Demetrius in Toronto and St. Elias in Brampton.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are some better English translations than the Ruthenian texts out there, you just have to look, find, and practice singing them and see what works. I have also used New Skete, Jordainville, Mother Mary/Kallistos Ware, Holy Transfiguration Monastery, St. John of Kronstadt Press, Melkite Menaion, Archbishop Raya, Isabel Hapgood and various OCA texts among others over the years in addition to the Ruthenian texts.\n\nI have found in general the UGCC Synodal English translation of the Eight Tones and weekday propers that are in the little blue pew books sings much better in the Galician chant used in the Ukrainian Catholic parishes than the Ruthenian translations of the same, which are generally meant to be sung in Prostopinje, the Carpatho-Ruthenian chant style.\n\nTo avoid boring everyone to death here you can e-mail me privately and I can go into greater length and explanation about this topic and resources that might be of interest to you. I can babble incoherently like this about this stuff for days, just ask my wife"
