Rubchak's critical essay analyses Antonych's poetry book by book and comes to the following conclusion: \"From his second book onward, Antonych was carefully orchestrating every collection by excluding much more material than he included. His selections were not motivated by quality alone... They were motivated by the persona that Antonych was carefully constructing - the persona of the poet as Orpheus. The haunting poem \"The Home Beyond a Star\" is its crowning chord. This poem proclaims the unity of earth and horizon, of immediacy and distance, of transcendence and immanence. But above all it proclaims the unity of poetry and the world.\" There is an unsigned bio-bibliographical note on the back of the book's cover which says about Antonych and this collection of his poetry: \"Probably the most striking aspect of his work is the richness and vividness of his visual imagery, which helps to create an engrossing symbolic system that unites his work. The poems collected here cover his entire creative spectrum, including religious, metaphysical, urban, and pastoral themes.\"\n\nFor identifications of individual poems see Index.\n\nB002.

Krushelnysky [sic] characterizes this book about the freedom fighters of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) as \"a book about real people and true, in historical sense, events which took place in the '40s of this century and which the author has experienced, for he himself had been a participant in them.\"\n\nB004. Chornovil, Viacheslav. The Chornovil Papers. / Compiled by Vyacheslav Chornovil. New York: McGrow-Hill [�1968]. xxi, 246 p. maps.\n\nContents: Foreword / Zbigniew Brzezinski. Introduction / Frederick C. Barghoorn [pp.ix-xvi]. Maps [pp.xvii-xix]. About Vyacheslav Chornovil. Part I: The petition of Vyacheslav Chornovil. Part II. The misfortune of intellect: Portraits of twenty \"criminals\"/ Materials compiled by Vyacheslav Chornovil. Appendix: Partial list of published works of the \"Criminals\".\n\nViacheslav Chornovil, a Ukrainian journalist born in 1938, was assigned to cover the trials of Ukrainian intellectuals in Lviv in 1965. He was, in the words of the editorial note on p. xxi, \"outraged by the court's disregard of Soviet law\". As a consequence, he compiled a collection of documents: letters, petitions, diaries and biographies of these intellectuals who were sentenced and deported to Mordovian hard-labor camps. These documents were smuggled out of the Soviet Union and were first published in Ukrainian in Paris under the title Lykho z rozumu (1967). The translation of these documents appears in this book as Part II. The Misfortune of Intellect: Portraits of Twenty \"Criminals\" [pp.77-226]. Among the twenty intellectuals are a number of Ukrainian writers and literary scholars: Bohdan Horyn', Mykhailo Horyn', Myroslava Zvarychevs'ka, Dmytro Ivashchenko, Mykhailo Masiutko [Mykhaylo Masyutko in text], Valentyn Moroz, Mykhailo Ozernyi [Mykhaylo Ozerny], Mykhailo Osadchyi [Mykhaylo Osadchy], Anatolii Shevchuk, Sviatoslav Karavans'kyi [Svyatoslav Karavans'ky]. A supplement to \"Misfortune of Intellect\" contains Ivan Dziuba's [Dzyuba] speech in Babyn Yar on 29 September 1966. The bibliography of published works on pp.227-246 lists some early published works of these writers [with Ukrainian titles in English translation]. Brzezinski in his brief foreword stresses the importance of the national question in the USSR. Barghoorn's introduction provides a political background for Ukrainian dissident movement. Chornovil's \"Petition\" is addressed to the Public Prosecutor, to the Head of the Supreme Soviet and to the Chairman of the State Security Committee at the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR and brings to their attention what he considers to be \"wanton disregard of socialist legality\" and \"violations of the elementary principles of justice\". The book jacket of the hard cover edition has Chornovil's black and white portrait on the back cover, as well as some excerpts from critical comments about the book.\n\nB005. Chyzhevs'kyi, Dmytro. Comparative History of Slavic Literatures. / Dmitrij Čiževskij. Tr. by Richard Noel Porter and Martin P. Rice. Ed., with a foreword by Serge A. Zenkovsky. [Baltimore]: Vanderbilt University Press, 1971. xi, 225 p.\n\nChyzhevs'kyi, in the words of his editor Serge Zenkovsky, \"presents the development of Slavic literature against the background of succeeding literary periods, schools and movements. In each period, he discusses first a literary era, determining its philosophic content, themes, and styles, and then studies the achievements of the Slavic peoples in the given period.\" Chyzhevs'kyi discusses in this book the literatures of the following Slavic peoples: Bulgarians, Croats, Czechs, Poles, Russians, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Sorbs, Ukrainians, White Russians. They are discussed side-by-side under chapters devoted to specific periods. Ukrainian literature in chapters III. (The early Middle Ages) and IV. (The late Middle Ages) is ascribed to the Russians, i.e. the literature of the Kyivan Rus': sermons, saints' lives, chronicles, the Slovo o polku Ihorevim, etc. Ivan Vyshens'kyi is mentioned briefly in the chapter on the Renaissance, Skovoroda, Velychkovs'kyi et al. - in the chapter on the Baroque. A couple of sentences are devoted to Kotliarevs'kyi, Kvitka-Osnovianenko and Hulak Artemovskyi in the chapter dealing with classicism; Shevchenko and P. Kulish are mentioned in a comparative context in connection with romanticism; Panas Myrnyi, Nechui-Levyts'kyi, Franko and Kotsiubyns'kyi in connection with realism; Oles', Ryl's'kyi and Tychyna in connection with neoromanticism (modernism).\n\nB006. Chyzhevs'kyi, Dmytro. A History of Ukrainian Literature (from the 11th to the end of the 19th century). / Dmytro Čyževs'kyj. Translated by Dolly Ferguson, Doreen Gorsline and Ulana Petyk. Edited and with a foreword by George S.N. Luckyj. Littleton, CO: Ukrainian Academic Press, 1975. xii, 681 p.\n\nContents: Foreword / George S.N. Luckyj [ix-xi p.] Transliteration table. Introduction.

Abbreviations of names of periodicals, collections and series. Index of names and titles / Alexandra Chernenko-Rudnytsky.\n\nThis first comprehensive survey of Ukrainian literature in English is an expanded translation of a work published originally in 1956 under the title: Istoriia ukrains'koi literatury vid pochatkiv do doby realizmu. The author, a world renown Slavist and literary scholar, approaches history of literature through stylistic analysis claiming that \"Stylistic analysis revealed that changes in style were the best and most intrinsic criteria for the periodization of literature.\" \"In spite of the great variety of literary styles in European literature,\" says Chyzhevs'kyi, \"it is not difficult to isolate the two basic types with opposite characteristics: love of simplicity, on the one hand, and a preference for complexity, on the other; a preference for clarity based on definite rules of an established framework, on the one hand, and a predisposition to incomplete, fragmented, 'free' form on the other. Similarly, it will be observed that there is either an inclination towards clarity of thought or its opposite - disregard for clarity, based on the belief that 'depth' is more important even if the reader does not always completely understand it; there is an attempt to establish a normalized, 'pure' language or its opposite - a search for a unique, original language, a predilection for verbal games and the use of dialecticisms and jargon; there is an inclination to precision or its opposite - a desire to provide the most complete expression even if this does not contribute to accuracy; there is an attempt to attain an overall impression of harmony or its opposite - tension, movement, dynamism. Representatives of these two differing types of literary styles value different literary qualities: clarity or depth, simplicity or ornamentation, peace or movement, limited or unbounded perspectives, well-defined norms or movement and change, unity or diversity, traditionalism or novelty, etc. On the one hand, the dominant ideal is calm, harmonious beauty; on the other, beauty is not the sole aesthetic value of a literary work - other values are equally important and ugliness finds a place in the aesthetic sphere.\"\n\nG.S.N. Luckyj in his foreword, while praising Chyzhevskyi's method (\"based primarily on literary analysis, without becoming narrowly formalistic\") and pointing out Chyzhevs'kyi's \"constant regard for deeper cultural and social influences and undercurrents\" and his \"most illuminating\" \"concept of modern Ukrainian literature as 'incomplete' and as a product of an 'incomplete nation',\" expresses also a critical view that \"Alternation of styles alone does not explain the breaks in the literary tradition of Ukraine.\" Luckyj warns the reader that while Chyzhevs'kyi's \"discussion of Ukrainian Baroque or Romanticism shows not only great erudition, but an ability to relate these literary periods to other Slavic and non-Slavic literatures\", his last chapter on Realism, prepared especially for the English edition, \"is treated as a transitional one\" and will need to be supplemented by other volumes dealing with 20th century Ukrainian literature.\n\nSee also the book length critique of Chyzhevs'kyi's work by George Grabowicz Toward a History of Ukrainian Literature [cf. A405, ULE, 1980-1989, B040].\n\nB007. Condemned by History. A collection of pamphlets and articles. [Compiled and introduced by Taras Mihal. Tr. from the Ukrainian by Anatole Bilenko]. Kiev: Dnipro, 1978. 213 p.\n\nTranslation of Pryrecheni istoriieiu: zbirnyk pamfletiv i statei. The contributors to this book - Rostyslav Bratun, Iurii Mel'nychuk [Yuri Melnichuk], Mykola Toporovs'kyi [Mikola Toropovsky], Iaroslav Halan, Petro Kozlaniuk [Kozlanyuk], Volodymyr Beliaiev [Volodimir Belyaev], Mykhailo Rudnyts'kyi [Mikhailo Rudnitsky], Volodymyr Vil'nyi [Volodimir Vilny], Taras Myhal' [Mihal], Iurii Smolych [Yuri Smolich], Fedir Malanchuk, Antin Khyzhniak [Anton Khizhnyak] and Vasyl' Mykytas' [Vasil Mykitas] - are well known Soviet Ukrainan writers or critics. The book itself, however, is not a collection of literary sketches, but a piece of political propaganda, an attempt to discredit the activities of \"Ukrainian bourgeois nationalists\", both at home and abroad. Only two articles have some relevance for Ukrainian literature: i.e. \"Sanctities disowned\" by Iurii Smolych (pp.192-201) which tells the story of Platon Stasiuk who brought a sample of the \"sacred earth from Shevchenko's grave\" in order to have it placed under the newly errected Shevchenko monument in Washington, but was rebuffed by the Shevchenko Memorial Committee. The second article with literary relevance is \"Engaged by fascism\" by Vasyl Mykytas' (pp.209-214), which attempts to discredit the �migr� Ukrainian novelist Ulas Samchuk residing in Toronto, Canada.\n\nB008. Cooper, Henry R., Jr. The Igor Tale: an annotated bibliography of 20th century non-Soviet scholarship on the Slovo o polku Igoreve. White Plains, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe; London: Mansell, 1978. 130 p. (Columbia Slavic studies).\n\nThis bibliography on the Slovo o polku Ihorevim attempts a comprehensive coverage of books, articles and book reviews in various languages published since 1900 in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany (both GDR and FRG), Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Benelux, Scandinavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. There are, in addition, a few entries for other countries, some unpublished dissertations, as well as a three-page listing of bibliographies on Slovo published in the USSR. The author's introduction surveys the world-wide Slovo scholarship and sets out the scope of his bibliography. The bibliography itself is arranged according to the following categories: 1. Bibliographies; 2. Texts, translations and commentaries; 3. Linguisitc analyses; 4. Literary analyses; 5. Historical analyses; 6. Reviews of Soviet scholarship. All entries are numbered and most entries have cryptic one sentence annotations. An index is provided which makes the retrieval by author and title possible. The appendix contains the original text of Slovo o polku Ihorevim - in Roman Jakobson's fifth reconstruction.\n\nB009. De, Olexander. Stalin: Persona Non Grata. A verse-play in three acts. London: Mitre Press [c1969]. 102 p.\n\nThe author's own English version of his play in verse published originally in Ukrainian under the title Persona Non Grata: Portret (London: Chaika, 1967. 123 p.). Olexander De is the pseudonym of Alexander Barchuk, who writes both in Ukrainian and in English.\n\nB010. De, Olexander. Without Tears. Poems. London: Mitre Press, 1966. 67 p. port.\n\nWithout Tears, according to a bio-bibliographical note on the front flap of the book's cover, is Olexander De's first book written in English. As such it is, outside the scope of this bibliography, except for a section entitled \"Free translations of Ukrainian popular and folk songs\" included on pp. 59-67, the contents of which is as follows:\n\nWhite chestnut trees (White chestnut trees and dancing light) / A.S. Malyshko. Our Miner's Estate (At the Miners' Estate when I) (Ukrainian folk song). Marichka (Like a silver ribbon, runs along the valley) (Ukrainian popular song).

Domazar, Serhii. Castle on the Voday. / A novel by Serhij Domazar. Sydney: Zeta Press, 1971. 225 p.\n\nTranslation of Zamok nad Vodaiem. A note on the verso of the title page identifies the novel as one published originally \"in the Ukrainian literary magazine Sucasnist, then as a book in 1964...\" Apparently, the author's own English translation, revised by Douglas Watson and Joyce Challis. There is no introduction or preface of any kind and no bio- bibliographical note about the author. Two brief excerpts from reviews of the Ukrainian edition by H. Kostiuk and Vadym Svaroh appear on the back cover.\n\nB013. Dovzhenko, Oleksandr. \"Earth\" / a film by Alexander Dovzhenko. Classic Film Scripts: Mother, a film by V.I. Pudovkin; Earth, a film by Alexander Dovzhenko. New York : Simon and Schuster [1973]. 102 p. [\"Earth\": p.59- 102]. illus.\n\nTranslation of Zemlia. Title on cover: \"Two Russian Film Classics: Mother / Pudovkin, Earth / Dovzhenko\". A note on p.4 says, among other things: \"The versions of the two great Russian classics presented here are taken from the scenarios originally published in Russia and intended in each case as a literary rendering of the film....The version of Earth, translated by Diana Matias, is taken from a volume entitled Zemlya: Knyiga-Film, edited by Yu. Solntseva and G. Maryamov, published in Moscow in 1966.\" Credits listed on p.57 show Dovzhenko as both the author of the scenario and director. An untitled note by the translator, Diana Matias, says the following: \"Dovzhenko originally wrote the script of Earth in 1929 when the impact of collectivisation on the Ukrainian village was a moment of its recent history... Of this first shooting script only isolated fragments have survived. The scenario published here not only reverses the usual script/film order, but is separated from the cinematic work by an interval of some twenty years. Dovzhenko himself described it as 'a kind of literary equivalent' of the ideas he had put into his film... What chiefly distinguishes this version is the introduction of a narrator through whom events and characters are personalised; this is particularly strongly felt in the introductory passage centring [sic] on the death of grandfather Semyon. The interest of this innovation in relation to the film lies in the fact that the narrator is both film-maker and spectator at once, and therefore opens the way for comment on the choices which brought certain images to the screen and reflections on their form. Implicitly too, there is an element of hindsight in the narrator's stress on the film's 'muteness' and its implications for the film-maker, actors and spectator; the intervening years had seen a major transformation in cinematic techniques and the effects of sound on the art of scenario writing was a question which prompted one of Dovzhenko's relatively rare excursions into theoretical writing. Originally written in Ukrainian, this version was completed by Dovzhenko four years before his death in 1956.\" The book contains 23 b/w illustrations from the film Zemlia.\n\nThe film directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin is based on the novel of Maxim Gorky. The author of the scenario is Nathan Zarkhy. In some libraries, therefore, this book may be found under the entry for \"Zarkhi, Natan Abramovich. Mother.\"\n\nB014. Dovzhenko, Oleksandr. The Enchanted Desna. A film story by Olexandr Dovzhenko. [Tr. from the Ukrainian by Anatole Bilenko. Illustrated by Olexandr Ivakhnenko. Kiev: Dnipro, 1979]. 73 p. illus.\n\nTranslation of Zacharovana Desna. The unsigned one-page introduction about Dovzhenko and his films says, among other things: \"In 1942, in his diary, Dovzhenko made the first entries about his childhood, which he later used in the autobiographical story The Enchanted Desna (1954-1955)... The Enchanted Desna is a real poem about the making of man, about the inner beauty of those who work on the land, and about the charming nature of the author's native countryside. The whole book is imbued with deep lyricism and gentle humor. There is no exaggeration in saying that by writing this realistic and philosophical story Olexandr Dovzhenko provided readers with a key to understanding his works.\"\n\nB015. Dovzhenko, Oleksandr.

Chronology. Filmography. Notes. Index.\n\nTranslation of Oleksandr Dovzhenko's notebooks and diaries from 1941 to 1956 as collated from various Soviet Ukrainian and Russian sources. In his extensive introduction Carynnyk discusses Dovzhenko's life and work, analyzes his films and surveys the existing international acclaim by film critics. \"Taking the whole of Alexander Dovzhenko's output, writings as well as films, one realizes quickly that he was a stubbornly single-minded man,\" says Carynnyk. \"Posessed of a strongly mythopoeic imagination, he had the ambition to create a vast synthesis, both literary and cinematic, into which he could fold history, mythology, and personal beliefs. Few film directors have produced so unified a body of work as Dovzhenko.\"\n\nB016. Drach, Ivan. Orchard Lamps. Edited and introduced by Stanley Kunitz. With woodcuts by Jacques Hnizdovsky.

Notes to the poems [pp.69-71]..\n\n\"Drach's mind generates so much light that he is capable of making even the homeliest objects radiant,\" writes Stanley Kunitz in the introduction. He finds in Drach's work \"a vein of Slavic mysticism... not always distinguishable from a romantic drift towards afflatus and murkiness. The best of his poems begin with brilliant perceptions, or concrete instances, and climb, with an explosion of images, towards the realm of the transcendent.\"\n\nThis book of translations originated \"as a workshop project in the graduate writing program of the School of the Arts at Columbia University and continued, as a voluntary commitment, for an extended period thereafter.\" The introduction acknowledges the assistance of Bohdan Boychuk and Jaroslav Rozumnyj who supplied the literal translations from the Ukrainian.\n\nThere are 16 full page woodcuts by Jacques Hnizdovsky in text; another woodcut is used for the book's cover. However, one woodcut listed in the contents of illustrations as appearing on endpapers is absent from this paperback edition. Two snapshots of Drach and of Drach with Kunitz appear on the paperback's back cover. Another edition of Orchard Lamps, published by Exile Editions in Toronto in 1989, has exactly the same contents, but has a different design for the cover and for the title page, contains one extra woodcut by Hnizdovsky, and has a couple minor changes, including two typographical errors (on the title page and in contents).

Kiev: Ukraina Society, 1976. 136 p.\n\nTranslated from the Ukrainian by George Sklyar. Copyread and edited by Gladys Evans. The booklet deals mostly with the cultural interaction between the peoples of the USSR, the so called \"rapprochement of nations\", and with a polemic against Ukrainian \"bourgeois nationalists\". Ukrainian literature is surveyed in two chapters on Soviet Ukrainian culture on pp.79-116. \"This brochure\", says Dziuba, \"points out the place Ukrainian socialist culture holds within Soviet culture, some of its most significant attainments, the ways and means of its interaction with other national cultures within a supreme, complete whole - the single socialist culture of the Soviet people.\" \"There was a time in the past\", says Dziuba, \"when I entertained profoundly erroneous, fallacious ideas with regard to certain aspects of the aforementioned subject - namely, the condition of Ukrainian culture and literature, as well as the national question in general... Upon realizing the baselessness and falsehood of my outlook.... I made a definite rebuttal of my views...[in a statement published in Literaturna Ukraina, on 9 November 1973]. But I still feel obliged to return to this subject in order to enlarge my knowledge of the factual situation and better understand it from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint.\" [See also B018, B019, B020].\n\nB018. Dziuba, Ivan. Internationalism or Russification? A study in the Soviet nationalities problem. / Ivan Dzyuba. Pref. by Peter Archer. Ed. by M. Davies. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson [�1968]. xix, 240 p.\n\nTranslation of Internatsionalizm chy rusyfikatsiia? Archer in his preface characterizes the book as \"a study of the relationship between the Russian and the Ukrainian peoples... \", as an \"example of the frustrated aspirations, the restrictions upon choice, and the consequent resentments generated by a failure to understand why people care for a national and cultural inheritance.\"\n\nIntroductory article entitled \"The author and his book\" provides a biography of Ivan Dziuba and a report on the reaction to Dziuba's work abroad and at home. Originally, this book, according to the introduction, was meant to be \"a thorough examination of the historical background of the nationalities problem, of the Leninist policy on it, and of its subsequent abandonment, and the means whereby it should be restored\" and it \"was presented to the leaders of the Communist Party and the government of the Ukrainian SSR.\"\n\nThe publisher's note on the front flyleaf says, among other things: \"This study, emerging as it does from the USSR, is remarkable for its courageous statement of the facts combined with the depth and scope of its scholarly analysis, and I. Dzyuba's own immediate and constant experience of the problems discussed lends to his work an authority which that of outside experts can never have.\"\n\nB019. Dziuba, Ivan. Internationalism or Russification? A study in the Soviet nationalities problem / Ivan Dzyuba. Pref. by Peter Archer. Ed. by M. Davies. 2nd ed. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson [October 1970]. xx, 263 p.\n\nTranslation of Internatsionalizm chy rusyfikatsiia? [cf. Annotation to the first ed. B018]. There is an added \"Postcript to the second edition\" on pp.233-250. The unsigned postcript discusses the reaction in the USSR to the publication of the first English edition, especially the book by Bohdan Stenchuk, first published in Ukrainian and then translated and published in English [Bohdan Stenchuk: Shcho i iak obstoiuie I. Dziuba (Shche raz pro knyhu Internatsionalizm chy rusyfikatsia). Kiev: URSR Tovarystvo kul'turnykh zviazkiv z ukraintsiamy za kordonom, 1969, 196 p. = B. Stanchuk [sic]. What I. Dzyuba Stands For, and How He does It? (Once more about the book Internationalism or Russification). Kiev: Ukrainian SSR Association for Cultural Relations with Ukrainians Abroad, 1970. 196 p.]. Says the editor: \"...it is natural to regard Stenchuk's book as an officially-sponsored reply to Dzyuba aimed at his readers abroad. In content and purpose patently a denunciatory review of Dzyuba's work, it runs into practically half the length of his book. This fact alone demonstrates how seriously Dzyuba's book is taken, since it was deemed to need the counterblast of these dimensions\". The postscript refutes one by one Stenchuk's accusations. Stenchuk's book, according to this postscript, was not made available to the general Soviet reader, but nonetheless it marked \"the beginning of an intensive campaign against Dzyuba in the Ukrainian SSR\". In this connection an article in Literaturna Ukraina (5 August 1969, p.4) by L. Dmyterko and the proceedings to stript Dziuba of his membership in the Writers' Union of Ukraine are analyzed in some detail. Dziuba's statement addressed \"To the Presidium of the Writers' Union of the Ukraine\" dated 26 December 1969 is printed in an English translation on pp.248-249.\n\nB020. Dziuba, Ivan.

For 1st and 2nd English editions see B018 and B019. This paperback edition has a note about the author and excerps from reviews of the book on the back cover. The excerpts characterize the book as \"a penetrating philosophical and historical analysis of ... the abandoned principles of the Leninist nationalities policy and the corruption of the ideals of true internationalism...\" Dziuba is characterized as one who \"won fame as a literary critic\" who wrote the book in late 1965 \"in defense of arrested Ukrainian dissidents who argued that official Soviet policy discriminated against non-Russian minorities. In March 1972 he was expelled from the Writers' Union, and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to five years imprisonment. After giving in to heavy pressure to recant his ideas, he was released in November 1973.\" Holubenko's preface [pp.v-xxiv] characterizes the book as \"an impressive marshalling of evidence from a Marxist-Leninist point of view to demonstrate the devastating political, social, economic, and cultural effests of Stalin's nationalitities policy, and the continuation of these policies by succeeding post-Stalin regimes\" and provides [on pp.xvi-xxiii] a biography of Ivan Dziuba.

The only English language material in the book are the editor's preface signed by Omeljan Pritsak [pp.5*-8*] and, instead of an introduction, the essay by Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi translated by Zenon Kohut. Litopys samovydtsia, one of the monuments of Ukrainian historiography known as the \"Ukrainian Cossack chronicles\", according to Pritsak, was written by an unknown author sometime between 1672 and 1702. Hrushevs'kyi's essay [pp.9*-16*] discusses the importance of the Cossack chronicles in general and states: \"...even while losing significance as historical sources for the seventeenth century events described in them, these works did not suffer as historico-literary monuments of their time. On the contrary, with the deepening study of the dynamics of literary creation and, more broadly, of the cultural and social processes of seventeenth-century Ukraine, the relative importance of the historical works produced in this epoch increased.\"\n\nB023.

Fox Mykyta: Ivan Franko's Ukrainian classic. English version by Bohdan Melnyk. Illustrated by William Kurelek. [Montreal]: Tundra Books [�1978]. 148 p. illus.\n\nIvan Franko's long poem Lys Mykyta retold in a free English prose version by Bohdan Melnyk, with black and white drawings [of which 48 are full page] by the well-known Canadian Ukrainian artist William Kurelek. A note on the front cover flap describes this as \"the first English version of Ivan Franko's 1890 classic\" and says about Franko's work: \"Lys Mykyta is one of The Best of the Best children's books of the world, listed by the International Youth Library, Munich and heads every list of the best of Ukrainian literature for both adults and children. Older readers will appreciate the strong social and political satiric elements reminiscent of Swift and Voltaire.\" The back cover has the following characteristic of Lys Mykyta: \"To Ukrainian children it is as well known as Mother Goose is to English children, but it is also so cherished by adults that many know the whole poem by heart - 607 stanzas of six lines each, a total of 3,642 lines! Obviously, any work so intensely loved is more than just a good story that amuses and intrigues. To Ukrainians, Lys Mykyta represents the independence and effectiveness of the individual. Fox stands alone and wins against all odds; he never surrenders to fear or pessimism, even with the mob clamoring for his death and the noose tightening around his neck; he turns the weapons of his attackers back upon them and does it with style and wit; he shows that the individual counts and can triumph no matter how powerful or numerous the enemy.\" There is, by way of an introduction, a poem \"From the translator (I am inviting you hereby)\" on p.7. and extensive biographical notes about the author, the artist and the translator on unnumbered pages at the end of the book. Franko is characterized in the biographical note as \"a great writer of the Ukrainian revolutionary, democratic movement\", who although \"a nationalist\", \"remained politically non-doctrinaire and took a critical attitude toward Marxism\". William Kurelek, an artist who died in 1977 at the age of 50, is characterized as \"an exceptional figure in art, both in Canada and abroad\" who from the 1960's on \"enjoyed steadily increasing critical and financial success.\" The translator, according to the biographical note, was born 1914 in Western Ukraine, emigrated to Canada after World War II and became a Canadian citizen in 1956.\n\nB028.

He learned Ukrainian and began to translate works of Ukrainian literature. \"He felt a natural and spiritual kinship with Franko\", says Manning. Cundy, born in Manchester, England in 1881, was brought as a boy to Canada. In 1937 he moved to the United States and died there in 1947. Manning's preface characterizes Franko as \"the spokesman for his people\" who \"used his pen as a weapon\" \"as poet, novelist, dramatist, literary critic, scholar, political pamphleteer...\" as a poet, says Manning, \"... Franko undoubtedly reaches the heights in his philosophical poems, in Cain, in Ivan Vyshensky, and in Moses. These need not fear comparison with the great poems of other languages and literatures and belong truly to the literature of the world.\" Percival Cundy's detailed and extensive biographical study of Ivan Franko focuses on what Cundy considers the three outstanding characteristics of Franko, the man: \"his indefatigable industry, his social consciousness and sense of mission, and the undaunted courage he displayed all through his life.\" Cundy's translations of Franko's poetry are accompanied by brief introductory commentaries and interpretations.

The translator claims in his preface that he \"decided to reproduce the original's rhyme and rhythm schemes\". He also supplied explanatory footnotes. Rudnytzky in his introduction characterizes Franko's poem as \"a novella in poetic form\" and discusses the historic and literary sources of Pans'ki zharty. In his opinion, the \"strength and the beauty of the work lies in Franko's realistic depiction of the milieu and his warm and vibrant portrayal of the people in it\" and in \"the well developed speech pattern of each individual character, which reveals to us the very soul of the person involved.\n\nB030.

Manning.\n\nManning claims in his preface that Franko reached the heights of his achievement in his philosophical poems \"Kain\", \"Ivan Vyshens'kyi\" and \"Moisei\". \"These need not fear comparison with the great poems of other languages and literatures and belong truly to the literature of the world. In each of them there is a well told story with vivid imagery but there is more to them than that. Far more, for the kernel of the poem is not the mere external course of events which Franko describes but they are in a sense personal meditations on that strange conflict that goes on in the mind of a democratic leader, the need for communicating his ideas to the people around him and his equally compelling urge to follow his own course to the end, regardless of their petty interference.\" Vasyl Lev provides a biography of Franko and a listing of his books and other important works. Vera Rich's translation of the poem \"Moisei\" (Moses) includes all 20 cantos of the poem and a parallel text in Ukrainian for the Prologue [Proloh (Narode mii, zamuchenyi, rozbytyi)]. Percival Cundy's translations include the translator's commentaries on individual poems which are, apparently, together with the translations, reprinted from Ivan Franko, the Poet of Western Ukraine [cf. ULE: Books and Pamphlets, 1890-1965, B20]. Cundy's translations are of the following poems: Hymn (Vichnyi revoliutsioner). Narodnia pisnia (Hlian' na krynytsiu tykhu, shcho iz stin mohyly). Kotliarevs'kyi (Orel mohuchyi na vershku snizhnomu). Naimyt (V ustakh tuzhlyvyi spiv, v rukakh chepihy pluha). Kameniari (Ia bachyv dyvnyi son. Nemov peredo mnoiu).

Bass stresses the theme of \"the struggle of all working people against capitalist exploitation\" in Franko's work. For the ten short stories included in the present collection, says Bass, \"burning social themes may well serve as the common denominator...\"\n\nThe book contains English translations of the following short stories: Olivets'(Olovets') Rubach.

The introduction provides a biography of Franko and brief descriptions of his works. Says Kyryliuk about Franko the poet: \"He was the first of the Ukrainian poets to introduce into poetry the image of the revolutionary proletarian who in the struggle for freedom champions the noble ideas of humanity\". Franko's prose works, according to Kyryliuk, \"are a significant landmark in the history of Ukrainian letters\" and his portrayal \"of the workers' intolerable conditions under capitalism, the evolution of their social consciousness, and their attempts at a concerted class stuggle\" are \"more profound and convincing\" than those of some other writers in world literature, such as Gaskell, Dickens, Spielhagen, Prus and even Zola. A b/w portrait of Franko with a caption from his own writings appears on p.[5].\n\nThe collection includes translations of the following Franko stories: Olovets'. Lisy i pasovys'ka. Rubach. Chuma.

Says Pritsak: \"Whereas, the Kievan Chronicle, according to D. Čyževs'kyj, represents the apex of the Kievan 'monumental' style, the Galician- Volynian Chronicle stands out as one of the best examples of the 'ornamental' style which originated in Galicia in the second half of the 12th century and included the well-known Igor's Tale...\"\n\nB034.

Kolasky, a Canadian Ukrainian Communist, went to the Ukrainian SSR in 1963 to study at the Kyiv university, became disillusioned by the Russified reality and started collecting material on the discrimination against Ukrainians and the Ukrainian language. The book discusses the nationality policies of the USSR, the law on education under Khrushchev, and citing a variety of sources and personal experiences provides data on elementary, secondary and higher education. The appendices contain a number of statistical tables.\n\nB045. Kolasky, John. Two Years in Soviet Ukraine. A Canadian's personal account of Russian oppression and the growing opposition.

Franko the poet. Ivan Franko and world literature.\n\nKolesnyk presents Franko's life against the background of social and political conditions in Galicia and claims that \"The historical significance of Franko's efforts lies especially in the fact that he was a spokesman for the liberation aims of the working masses...\" According to Kolesnyk, \"Franko affirmed that to fight for the national liberation of his people alone would mean to betray the trust of the workers; for that would mean replacing 'foreign' masters with those of his 'own' race who would be even more cruel and more greedy. He called on the workers of all nationalities to join forces in the freedom struggle...\" Kolesnyk surveys Franko's short stories and novels, provides brief summaries of their plots and brief critical comments, always stressing the works' social and political aspects; Boryslav smiietsia (Borislav is Laughing) is called \"one of the first prose stories in the literary world to deal with the working class struggle\". Dlia domashn'oho ohnyshcha (For the Home Hearth) and Osnovy suspil'nosti (Fundamentals of Society) are characterized as protests \"against an exploiting society\" pointing to \"the only way out\" - to \"social revolution\". Kolesnyk considers Franko \"a talented playwright\" and singles out Ukradene shchastia (Stolen Happiness) as Franko's best play. Kolesnyk analyzes one by one all of the eight books of poetry published during Franko's lifetime. In his view, the second (1893) edition of Z vershyn i nyzyn (From the Heights and the Depths) \"should be considered his best\": \"It breathes of the spirit of revolutions... Its lyrical hero is a revolutionary..., an internationalist and friend of the people, but a deadly enemy of feudal or capitalist enslavement.\" Ziviale lystia (Wilted Leaves), says Kolesnyk, shows the \"strength of Franko's talent as a lyric poet... his ability to remain personally aloof, and yet seeing the facts of life through the eyes of an artist...\" Mii izmarahd (My Emerald) reveals a balanced approach to everything, a mood of quiet peace and sober reasoning...\" The last chapter discusses Franko's work as a literary scholar and translator. Fragments of poetry are quoted throughout the book. The longer pieces are: Perhaps Genoa will for years recall [6 lines, p.11]. I dreamt of a new brotherhood of mankind [9 lines, p.15]. Blessed be the man who, caught in decadent billows [8 lines, p.42-43]. Call for revolt rings far and near [10 lines, p.101]. From their assemblies they will drive you out [11 lines, pp.105- 106]. We all believed that with our hands and by a common effort [5 lines, pp.108-109]. A moment more, and Joshua's call [8 lines, p.128].\n\nB047. Kotsiubyns'kyi, Mykhailo.

He was at his best in the socio-psychological short story with its tense, energetic beginning and abrupt end. Skillful representation of human motives and feelings brings his stories in line with best modern writing.\" Kotsiubyns'kyi, in Kalenichenko's view, was \"an innovator not only in the sense that he introduced new subjects and ideas into Ukrainian literature; he also created new forms of artistic expression.\"\n\nB048.

Sonata Pathetique.\n\nA translation of the seven-act play Patetychna sonata written in 1930. Lindheim in his introduction provides a detailed analysis of the play which he considers \"powerful, complex and unconventional\", towering above the other Soviet historical epics of the time \"because of the brilliance of its technique and the integrity with which it explores the central issues of revolution and nationalism\". According to Lindheim: \"... Sonata Pathetique is not a reactionary tract repudiating revolution... Rather, the play discloses the conservative impulses and forces in its characters. These impulses keep them from responding openly to the opportunity revolution provides to reject the past, to move beyond previous failures and accomplishments, and to liberate themselves from all the old aesthetic, social, political, religious, and philosophical assumptions -... so that new and different conceptions of man and society, uninvestigated possibilities of life, can be voiced and explored. From this perspective the revolution proves degrading and destructive rather than elevating and creative, because revolutionary idealism either is swamped by a sentimentalism that refuses to jettison the ballast of the past or is subverted by a fanaticism that, doubting man's heroic stature and creativity, cannot acknowledge that 'man's reach should exceed his grasp'. The revolutionary dream to create a new man and a new environment for him is, therefore, fated to remain unfulfilled, since both the ideals and the actions of the dreamers fail to match the radical thrust and scope of their aspirations.\"\n\nB050.

Translators' notes [pp.123-125].\n\nAn abridged translation of the novel Chorna rada, written originally in 1845-46. According to the translators' note, the text was condensed from the original 50,000 words to 40,000. The introduction provides a detailed biography of Panteleimon Kulish and an analysis of Chorna rada, which was written, according to Romana Bahrij Pikulyk, under the influence of Ukrainian historical chronicles, and in the best tradition of the novels of Sir Walter Scott. P. Kulish, says Bahrij Pikulyk, considered his novel a Ukrainian answer to Gogol's Taras Bulba; both Taras Bulba and Chorna rada are novels about the Cossack wars, but Chorna rada is more firmly grounded in history and depicts the conflict not only as one between two nationalities and religions, but also as one of opposing classes. \"... the significance of The Black Council cannot be overestimated, says Bahrij Pikulyk. \"It is a great cultural, linguistic, stylistic, historical, but most of all literary, achievement.\"\n\nB051.

The rest of the book deals with post- revolutionary Soviet Ukrainian playwrights. The plays of the 1920's by Iakiv Mamontov, Myroslav Irchan, Vasyl' Mynko [Minko] and Mykola Kulish are dealt with in Chapter 2. While seventeen pages are devoted to Kulish and he is characterized as \"a genuine talent who, with tremendous artistic mastery showed the complex and dramatic events which took place in the winter of 1921-1922...\" only four of Kulish's plays are discussed: \"97\" (singled out as his \"perhaps the most successful play\"), \"Komuna v stepakh\" (A Commune in the Steppes, which, in the author's opinion \"did not match, as to its artistic level, the tragic heights of \"97\"), \"Maklena Grasa\" (\"reveals the vices of the bourgeois system\") and \"Patetychna sonata\" (Sonata Pathetique, \"original in form and content\" \"although possessing certain miscalculations on the part of the author\"). Kulish's other plays, \"Myna Mazailo\", \"Narodnii Malakhii\" are not even mentioned by title, let alone analyzed. Kisel'ov devotes whole separate chapters to Ivan Kocherha, Ivan Mykytenko [Mikitenko], Oleksandr Korniichuk [Olexander Korniychuk], Oleksandr Levada, Mykhailo Stel'makh, Mykola Zarudnyi [Zarudny] and Oleksii Kolomiiets'[Olexiy Kolomiyets]. Kocherha's plays \"Iaroslav Mudryi\",(Yaroslav the Wise], \"Svichchyne vesillia\" [Svichka's Wedding], \"Maistry chasu\" [Masters of Time], Mykytenko's \"Dyktatura\" [Dictatorship - \"artistically convincing\"), \"Kadry\" [Cadres], \"Sprava chesti\" [A Matter of Honor], \"Dni iunosti\" [The Days of Youth], \"Divchata nashoi krainy\" [The Girls of Our Country - \"optimistic social comedy\"] are analyzed in considerable detail. Korniichuk is characterized as a \"genuine innovator, investigator of new life phenomena, and of new types of human characters\" whose works have \"vivacity of plot, colorfulness of characters, richness of lexicon, genuine popular humor and optimism of intonations.\" Korniichuk's plays \"Platon Krechet\", \"Kalynovyi hai\" [Guelder-rose Grove], \"Kryla\" [Wings], \"V stepakh Ukrainy\" [In the Steppes of the Ukraine], \"Storinka shchodennyka\" [A Page in the Diary], \"Pamiat' sertsia\" [The Memory of the Heart] are singled out for the author's special attention. Levada's \"Faust i smert'\" [Faust and Death], \"Zdrastui, Prypiat'\"[Hello, Pripyat!], \"Storm over Hawaii\", \"Kamo\", \"Mariia\" [Maria], \"Persten' z diamantom\" [A diamond Ring], says Kisel'ov, deal with the moral, ethical and psychological aspects of space exploration, ecology, the use of nuclear energy and show the playwright's \"constant attempts to add ideological connotation to dramatic conflict\". Stel'makh is described as \"a truthful and, consequently, a severe artist\" and the analysis includes his plays \"Duma pro liubov\" [A Ballad of Love], \"Kum koroliu\" [The King's Godfather], \"Na Ivana Kupala\" [On John the Baptist Day] and \"Pravda i kryvda\" [Truth and Falsehood]. Of Mykola Zarudnyi's plays the focus of discussion is on \"Vesna\" [Spring], \"Veselka\" [A Rainbow], \"Take dovhe, dovhe lito\" [Such a Long, Long Summer] and \"Pora zhovtoho lystia\" [The Season of the Yellow Leaf]. \"Colorfulness and originality\" in Kisel'ov's view, are characteristic features of O. Kolomiets's plays, especially of \"Faraony\" [The Pharaohs], \"Dvadtsiata hodyna\" [The Twentieth Hour], \"Please Give Me the Floor Today\", \"Planeta spodivan'\" [The Planet Speranta] and \"Odisseia v sim dniv\" [The Seven Day Odyssey].\n\nAmong the book's many illustrations - which include group portraits and scenes from various stage presentations - there are also full page portraits of the following writers and actors: I.

Luckyj, George S.N. Between Gogol' and Ševčenko: polarity in the literary Ukraine: 1798-1847. M�nchen: Wilhelm Fink [Published for the Centre for Russian and East European Studies, University of Toronto], 1971. 211 p. (Harvard series in Ukrainian studies, v.8).\n\nLuckyj characterizes his book in his introduction not as a study of Nikolai Gogol and Taras Shevchenko and their works, but as an attempt to see the Gogol-Shevchenko relationship \"within the context of a special cultural dilemma\", namely that of a choice between Russia and Ukraine. Gogol, a Ukrainian by birth, became a Russian writer, as if to indicate that the political absorption of Ukraine by Russia should be followed by Ukraine's cultural dissolution \"in the Russian sea\"; Shevchenko, on the other hand, \"succeeded in establishing modern Ukrainian literature and in infusing it with a distinct intellectual content.\" The focus of the study is on this dilemma, which is presented against a background of Ukrainian intellectual history. \"Gogol's role is reduced to the one he played in Ukrainian-Russian relations...\" Shevchenko's \"career is surveyed up to his arrest in 1847\". \"The world of ideas in which these two lived,\" says Luckyj, \" is entered through their life stories, their friendships and their day-to-day activities.\" The author attempts \"to achieve a new synthesis\", not to discover new and hitherto unknown material. In his concluding remarks Luckyj says: \"Ševčenko's followers sustained Ukrainian national ideals often at the expense of entering the mainstream of European literature. Living in the shadow of Russia, Ukrainian intellectuals were often aware of Gogol's continuing presence. Yet to them he became a symbol not so much of \"the road not taken\" as of the lasting potentialities of Ukrainian genius.\"\n\nContents: Introduction. Part One: I. Historians and folklorists. II.
