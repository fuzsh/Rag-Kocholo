        "text": "Protopresbyter Mirone Klysh (1932-____)\n\nand\n\nPreoteasa Lillian Klysh (born Kapetz) (1934-2019)\n\nMirone may be spelt Miron, Myron.\n\nEarly life of Mirone R Klysh\n\nMirone R Klysh was born on 30 August, 1932, in Johnson City, New York, USA. His parents, Theodore and Emilia (born Warska) Klysh were Ukrainian immigrants to the USA. Mirone was raised in an Orthodox Christian family, in the bosom of the Orthodox Christian Church.\n\nHe received his public school education in the Johnson City School System, and he graduated from high school in 1949 with high honours.\n\nHigher education\n\nAfter taking a year of post-high school courses in the Johnson City High School, Mirone enrolled in the Chemical Technology Department at the New York State Technical Institute in Binghamton, New York. He graduated with honours in 1952. Having worked as a co-operative student at Ansco Film, he found employment there.\n\nHowever, seeing the need for a 4-year degree in chemistry, he took courses at Harpur College (now Binghamton University) in Endicott, New York, from 1952-1954. There, he was the sports editor of the student newspaper, and he played on the basketball team for 2 years.\n\nHaving grown up as an active member of Saint John’s Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Johnson City, New York, he became inspired to study towards the holy priesthood through the example and prayers of his parish priest, Father Franko Lawryk, who served that parish for 42 years. However, in order not to be accused of going to the seminary so as to avoid military service (which was at that time compulsory) during the Korean War, he volunteered to serve in the US Army from 1954 to 1956.\n\nSaint John the Baptist Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Johnson City, New York\n\nIn September, 1956, having completed his military duties, Mirone enrolled in the Faculty of Theology of Saint Andrew’s College in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nWhile he was a student in Winnipeg, Mirone met his future wife, Lillian Kapetz, who was by that time a teacher.\n\nEarly life of Lillian Kapetz\n\nLillian Kapetz was born on 15 June, 1934. She was the daughter of William (Wasyl) and Anne Kapetz of the Roblin, Manitoba region.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Roblin, Manitoba, Lillian had begun her teaching career as a “Permit Teacher” in Portage Creek, Manitoba. Lillian then completed a year at Normal School (the school for training teachers), after which she taught in Moline, Neepawa and Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nHaving become a teacher, Lillian continued to teach for decades afterwards.\n\nMarriage, 1959\n\nMirone and Lillian were united in Holy Matrimony in Roblin, Manitoba, on 10 October, 1959.\n\nThis beginning was itself a challenge, since it took place in the midst of an unexpected blizzard. From then on, they lived and worked as a true team.\n\nIn due time, they received from the Lord 3 children : Marianne, Myron, William.\n\nDiaconal ordination, 1959\n\nOn 8 November, 1959, Mirone Klysh was ordained to the Holy Diaconate by Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada.\n\nDiaconal service\n\nDeacon Mirone Klysh was conferred the L.Th. Degree by Saint Andrew’s College in 1960. Again, he graduated with high honours.\n\nAfter his graduation from the seminary, Deacon Mirone and Lillian Klysh moved to the USA.\n\nPresbyteral ordination, 1960\n\nOn 28 August, 1960, Deacon Mirone Klysh was ordained to the Holy Priesthood by Metropolitan John (Theodorovych) in Saint John the Baptist Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Johnson City, New York.\n\nSaint John the Baptist Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Johnson City, New York\n\nPastoral service\n\nFrom then on, Father Mirone and Dobrodika Lillian together carried the Cross of the Holy Priesthood for the glory of God and His Holy Church. “Dobrodika” is a Ukrainian word, meaning “good lady”.\n\nThe Priest Mirone Klysh was then assigned to serve in the headquarters of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA in South Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n\nThere, on 4 January, 1961, their daughter Marianne was born.\n\nPennsylvania, 1961\n\nIn March, 1961, the Priest Mirone was transferred, and assigned to serve in the parish of Saint Andrew in Blakely, Pennsylvania. However, Father Mirone quickly perceived the need for Ukrainian Orthodox priests in North America to have a post-secondary education. Therefore, he petitioned for the blessing to continue his education in graduate studies.\n\nSaint Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Blakely, Pennsylvania\n\nFurther education in Canada, 1962\n\nWith the blessing of Metropolitan John, Father Mirone enrolled at United College, now the University of Winnipeg in graduate studies in September, 1962.\n\nAt that time, in order to support these studies, Dobrodika Lillian returned to her teaching profession in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the same year. Later on, Dobrodika Lillian continued her studies by pursuing a degree in education at the university. Once she had graduated, she found herself to be in a more advantageous position for teaching opportunities.\n\nAlthough the remainder of his pastoral service was to be in Canada, Father Mirone remained a citizen of the USA as well as being a Canadian citizen.\n\nTransfer to Canada, 1962\n\nIn 1962, Metropolitan John (Theodorovych) transferred the Priest Mirone Klysh to the omophor of Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), and to the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada. Father Mirone then served Ukrainian Orthodox parishes in rural Manitoba and in Pembina, North Dakota.\n\nDuring 1965-1967, Father Mirone also served as Dean of Residence at Saint Andrew’s College.\n\nOn 17 December, 1965, their son Myron was born.\n\nOn 25 May, 1967, the Priest Mirone Klysh was conferred the M.A. degree in History/Slavic Studies from the University of Manitoba, and he then began studies towards a Ph.D. degree in history. He was a speaker of the Ukrainian and English languages, which was an advantage in many situations besides his academic pursuits.\n\nPastoral and other work\n\nFor many years, Father Mirone had spoken about the need for an Orthodox Christian parish in Winnipeg which would function completely using the English language. This would provide the full life of the Church and the Orthodox Christian Faith in the English language. The opportunity came when a small number of families of mixed Romanian-non-Romanian marriages requested that he serve them in English. With the blessing of Metropolitan John, Bishop Valerian (Trifa) of the Romanian Orthodox Episcopate of America (in The Orthodox Church in America) received him.\n\nFounding the parish of Saint George, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1970\n\nIn 1970, Bishop Valerian (Trifa) assigned Father Mirone to be the “temporary administrator of the parish”, which was named Saint George Romanian Orthodox Church. It became a parish of the Romanian Orthodox Episcopate of America within The Orthodox Church in America.\n\nWith this change, there was also a change in title for Dobrodika Lillian. Now, in the Romanian Episcopate, she became known as “Preoteasa Lillian”. This is a term which is equivalent to the Greek “presbytera” or the Balkan Slav “papadia”, which all mean, simply, “priest’s wife”.\n\nTheir son, William (Vasyl), was born shortly after this move, on 12 May, 1971.\n\nBetween 1977 and 1978, Father Mirone occasionally served also in the parish of Saint Elijah in Lennard, Manitoba. In addition, he cared for other communities from time to time.\n\nOne of Father Mirone's great concerns during the 1980s was the visible disunity amongst Orthodox Christians in Canada. This resulted in the formation of the \"Canadian Council of Concerned Orthodox Christians\". This group met for many years, and it included clergy and lay persons from amongst almost all the Orthodox dioceses in Canada. In part because of their meetings, conversations and prayers, more and more events began to occur in which Orthodox Faithful were able to pray together, and to engage in various projects together. It may be said that the experience of the faithful people opened doors for the bishops to take steps towards greater co-operation also.\n\nFather Mirone served in several community and religious groups in Winnipeg, and as a chaplain. The chief of these was the \"Winnipeg Orthodox Clergy Association\" (WOCA), in which he actively participated in various capacities during many decades. The eventual inclusion of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in the fold of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1990, and also the inclusion of all the Orthodox clergy of all jurisdictions in the clergy association, were a joy for Father Mirone.\n\nThroughout all the years before and during the time of service at Saint George’s, Father Mirone’s wife, Preoteasa Lillian was fully involved in the life of the parishes along with her husband. She was especially involved as a church-school teacher. More recently, she has provided great assistance to her husband as his computer secretary. Above all, she has maintained contact with the parish members by telephone and by e-mail.\n\nFostering priestly callings in others\n\nIn the course of their pastoral/parental service at Saint George's, Father Mirone and Preoteasa Lillian encouraged the study and spiritual/theological formation of younger men who were responding to the Lord's call to them to prepare to serve as priests. One of these, Michael Lupu, became a long-time priest in Calgary, Alberta. There were several others. As an example, there is that of the young and newly-married couple Stacey and Trudi Richter.\n\nThey met Father Mirone and Preoteasa Lillian before 1995, at a time when they were at the beginning of encountering the Orthodox Christian Church. Their encounter the Klysh family and with their parish family helped them to know that they had found the pearl they sought [see Mathew 13:44-46]. They began catechetical studies with Father Mirone. Father Mirone's catechetical work took an unexpected turn, since Stacy and Trudi had found work in the far north of Manitoba (at Leaf Rapids), 1,000 km distant. Father Mirone undertook to travel by bus to Leaf Rapids on a regular basis in order to complete their instruction and formation.\n\nAfter Father Mirone had received the Richters into the Orthodox Church in 1996, he continued their distance education, formation and study, which led to Stacey's decision to enter Saint Andrew's College in Winnipeg as a student of theology. In 2000, Stacey was ordained to the Holy Diaconate, and in 2001, to the Holy Priesthood. All along, Father Mirone and Preoteasa Lillian were serving as living examples of how to serve Christ in the Church in the context of pastoral responsibility.\n\nFather Mirone, Lillian Klysh ; Father Stacey, Trudi Richter\n\nFather Mirone Klysh : main mentor of Father Stacey from earliest days in the Orthodox Church in Winnipeg\n\nSaint Arseny Institute, Winnipeg, 2003\n\nWhen it was proposed that a theological institute be established, Father Mirone was very much involved in its development from the beginning. The result was the establishment in 2003 of the \"Saint Arseny Orthodox Christian Theological Institute\" (SAOCTI). It is an English language theological school under the authority and direction of Archbishop Irénée (Rochon), the Archbishop of Ottawa and Canada.\n\nThe Institute was opened in September, 2003. Its purposes are to educate laity in the Orthodox Christian Faith, to train singers, readers, sub-deacons, and deacons for the Church, as well as to provide graduate-level Orthodox theological studies for both laity and those working towards ordination to the priesthood. It is the purpose of the institute to encourage as many people as possible to learn more about the Orthodox Christian Faith. Therefore, the institute aims to keep fees as low as possible. Staff members strive to provide personal attention to the goals, backgrounds, circumstances, and interests of students. This is done through the sacrificial contributions of many people – of time, money, prayers, and other supports in order to accomplish the goals of the Institute. In 2019, Father Mirone remained in the leadership of the institute and he remains amongst the teachers.\n\nSaint Arseny Institute graduates, 2004\n\nSaint Arseny Institute administration, 2005\n\nRetirement, 2016\n\nAfter 55 years of active priesthood and 45 years as the parish priest of Saint George’s Church in Winnipeg, Protopresbyter Mirone Klysh retired from active service on 1 January, 2016. He continued, however, to serve in the parish as Emeritus Parish Priest, and he continued to participate actively in other projects. Meanwhile, Father Mirone and Preoteasa Lillian moved from their long-time home into an apartment.\n\nFather Mirone preaching the homily at the retirement day Divine Liturgy\n\nRetirement Divine Liturgy ; 2 views of the retirement head table and dinner\n\nIn 2019, Preoteasa Lillian began to suffer from an illness that affected her breathing.\n\nNevertheless, on 10 October, 2019, Preoteasa Lillian and Father Mirone Klysh celebrated in Winnipeg their 60th anniversary of marriage.\n\nThen, on 19 October, Preoteasa Lillian's health deteriorated, and she was admitted to hospital.\n\nRepose of Preoteasa Lillian, 2019\n\nOn Sunday morning, 20 October, 2019, Preoteasa Lillian Klysh fell asleep in the Lord in Winnipeg.\n\nOn Sunday evening, 27 October, 2019, at 7:00 p.m., a prayer-service was offered for Preoteasa Lillian Klysh at Saint George's Romanian Orthodox Church in Transcona, Winnipeg, Manitoba. The service was presided by the Priest C Michael Ungrin.\n\nOn Monday morning, 28 October, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., the Funeral Service for the Burial of a Lay-person was offered at Saint George's Romanian Orthodox Church in Transcona, Winnipeg, Manitoba. The service was presided by the Priest C Michael Ungrin.\n\nFollowing the funeral services, the body of Lillian Klysh was interred at the Glen Lawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nFollowing the repose of Preoteasa Lillian, Father Mirone continued to live and serve as before (as much as possible). He continued to pray for and to nurture those around him.\n\nProtopresbyter Mirone Klysh\n\nReflections\n\nAt the time of her repose, Preoteasa Lillian Klysh had “carried the Cross of the Orthodox Priesthood” along with her husband for 59 years, which service included 46 years at Saint George's Orthodox Church in Winnipeg (Transcona).\n\nDuring her years of service, Preoteasa Lillian fully utilised her teaching skills as a Church School Teacher for most of those years, especially in organising arts and crafts activities. For many years, she prepared and directed the annual Christmas programme. During the pre-Paschal Lenten season, Preoteasa Lillian would bring out all the necessities for writing “pysanky” (Ukrainian Easter eggs). Her family were not the only beneficiaries of her skill and knowledge. Over the years, she presented workshops on the writing of pysanky in various parishes, schools, nursing homes, and other places, often with the assistance of her daughter Marianne.\n\nPreoteasa Lillian also took a personal interest in all members of the parish, especially in their times of need. In doing so, she cared for the parishioners in a way similar to how she nurtured and supported her personal family.\n\nFather Mirone was a pioneer in establishing an English-speaking parish and in promoting the use of the English language in Orthodox worship and education in Canada. In the course of his more than 50 years in the priesthood, he has gained a wealth of pastoral wisdom and understanding for the benefit of the many who have been taught by him. He has mentored a good number of younger priests after their ordination.\n\nFather Mirone Klysh has always been concerned to live and to teach in accordance with the Holy Gospel. He kept the service and worship of the Lord first in his life and in his teaching (as did Preoteasa Lillian). It was in this way that he taught throughout his life, and it was on the basis of this priority that he undertook the use of the English language in liturgical services. It was on this basis that he campaigned for bringing about visible unity amongst Orthodox Christians in Canada. It was on this basis that he took the lead in the establishment of the Saint Arseny Orthodox Christian Theological Institute in Winnipeg for the benefit of all Orthodox groups in Canada.\n\nSaint George Romanian Orthodox Church, Transcona, Winnipeg, Manitoba\n\nReferences\n\nBugea, Eleanor, “Romanians in Canada”, pp. 65-66.
