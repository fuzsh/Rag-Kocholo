        "text": "Bohdan Bociurkiw Memorial Lecture, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, Edmonton, Alberta, February 11, 2015. Since 2009, leaders of the Russian and Ukrainian churches have composed narratives defining the features of their ideal civilizations. The current turbulence afflicting Ukraine has shaped the revisions of these narratives and elicited forceful counter-narratives in a series of statements defining what it means to belong to a given Church. In this lecture, Nicholas Denysenko will present the development of the varying narratives through the lens of the rhetorical questions, \"who is to blame?\" and \"what is to be done?\" to demonstrate how Church leaders depict the \"other\" church communities in an informational battle. The lecture occurs in four parts. In the first part, Denysenko foregrounds the presentation by summarizing the Russian religious narrative known as the Russkii Mir. The Russkii Mir is a pastoral initiative developed and launched by Patriarch Kyrill in 2009 that defines the Moscow Patriarchate as an Orthodox civilization cultivating the traditional values of Holy Rus’, embracing the core peoples of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and open to anyone whose values cohere with the Russkii Mir. The Russkii Mir holds a privileged place for Ukraine and Kyiv, and is presented as an Orthodox alternative to the temptations presented by globalization, a place where one can embark on the path to sanctity. Part 2 presents a revision of the Russian narrative which defends the Russkii Mir in the wake of the Maidan and ensuing war in Ukraine. Both Patriarch Kyrill and Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev contributed to the revision of the narrative by asserting that illegitimate Church groups both caused the violence in Ukraine and posed a serious threat to the safety and freedom of the loyal adherents to the Russkii Mir in Ukraine. The Russian hierarchs appealed to the highest episcopal authorities in the catholic and Orthodox Churches to intervene on behalf of the canonical Orthodox in Ukraine, and in so doing, blamed the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic Church (UGCC) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) for preaching hatred. Part 3 presents the first Ukrainian counternarrative communicated by the UOC-KP. The UOC-KP responded to the Ukrainian crisis externally and internally, by equating Russian President Vladimir Putin with the biblical figures Cain and Pharaoh, and calling upon their own adherents to refrain from acts of corruption, which would place them in the company of the biblical figure Judas Iscariot. The UOC-KP’s counternarrative assigns blame to Putin and the Kremlin, depicts the UOC-KP as a communion of sanctity, and describes the Russkii Mir as a false promise resulting in slavery. Part 4 presents the second Ukrainian counternarrative belonging to the UGCC. The UGCC’s counternarrative proclaims the Church’s absolute solidarity with all Ukrainians regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or language, and defines the UGCC as a Church of new martyrs who are prepared to be with the people until the end, like the Heavenly Hundred of the Maidan. The lecture concludes with a reflection on how Church leaders might adopt a course of rapprochement to model peace for civil society. The primary step is for Church leaders to adopt narratives that call upon all of their people to repent without reference to the sins of the perceived antagonists, so that enemies might be converted into friends.\n\nIn this essay, I will examine the dynamics of intra-Christian division currently unfolding in Ukraine. My aim is to develop a working thesis which has two parts: first, to illuminate what is at stake for global Orthodoxy when we examine the Ukrainian Church situation. The theological task is not to resolve a minor disruption, but to contribute to a lasting peace. The second part is to view the contemporary Ukrainian picture through the lens of the modern history of Orthodox Ukraine. My conviction is that an honest historical examination can yield patterns enriching understanding, which is a sine qua non for our common theological task. My essay has three parts. The first part summarizes the intra-Christian divisions in Ukraine through the lenses of ecclesial legitimacy and identity. This section draws from selections of narratives developed and communicated by the three most influential Churches in Ukraine: the Moscow-Patriarchate (UOC-MP); the Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP); and the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic Church (UGCC). I will illuminate the diverse perspectives on each Church's ecclesial legitimacy and identity through primary documents and external analyses. The second part of my presentation connects the present images of ecclesial legitimacy and identity with their historical antecedents, drawing primarily from late-19 th century and twentieth century sources. The final section of the essay discusses the patterns contributing to the situation in light of the task of contemporary Orthodox theology.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Constitution, the country is secular, where its churches and all religious organisations are separated from the state and the legislative process. According to theologian Gennadiy Druzenko, in the regional scope, Ukraine might be described as one of the most religious countries in Europe. Demonstrated by the history of the Ukrainian Church, dating back to the time of the Kyivan Rus, when its Prince Volodymyr the Great received Christianity from Constantinople in 988. It was one of the most remarkable events in the creation of the Ukrainian state, that united the Ukrainian people spiritually. However, it further served as an instrument of manipulation and basis for lies from the Russian side so as to justify its right to exert control over Ukraine. This current paper aims to analyse the role of the Church in peace mediation versus conflict promotion in the case of Ukraine, addressing such issues as: - Official relations between and within different churches in the country and show impacts of this in reality; - The official position of the UOC KP and UAOC towards the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, the illegal annexation of Crimea, possible future reconciliation and current geopolitical challenges, reactions to fake news and disinformation; - The official position of the Church, position on the ground and the reaction on the discrimination against LGBT, religious and ethnic minorities; - Based on these points we will analyse whether the Church promotes peace or encourages conflicts in Ukraine, trying to answer whether the Church as an institution could serve as a powerful peace actor or not.\n\nThere is an ancient tradition within Christianity whose worship and culture are distinctly Eastern, Byzantine/Greek, and Orthodox. In Ukraine there are four large Churches that are part of this tradition: the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC), the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), the Ukrainian Autocephalist Orthodox Church (UAOC), and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP). All of these Churches have the same commitment to salvation through Christ, the same belief in the reality and efficacy of the Holy Mysteries (or Sacraments), the same (or very similar) Rite of Worship, and the same (or very similar) ecclesiology (e.g. “apostolic succession”). Ironically, they also profess the same commitment to fulfilling God's desire that “we all be one as He is one” (St. John 17:22b). This is ironic because none of these groups, despite their common beliefs, culture, and purpose, are in communion with one another. Instead, they have parallel structures and often act more like competitors than brothers in our Lord Jesus Christ. In this paper, I describe the common genesis of these Churches and the five “moments” that led to their division, how their disorder asserted itself in America, how some of these divisions in America have been overcome, and how this reconciliation provides reason for our hope of closer ecclesiastical cooperation and even unity in Ukraine."
