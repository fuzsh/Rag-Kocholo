        "text": "The article examines the first four synods of the Church of Kyiv, which occurred after the acceptance of Christianity in 988 the Kyiv Russ. The solutions of these synods are not only important for the history of the Church, but also especially significant for the codification of the particular law of the UGCC. This is the first Council of bishops of the Kyiv Church who are trying to do their right and to solve various issues and challenges that stood before them.\n\nIn 988, under the leadership of Kinyaz Viladimer, Russians accepted Christianity through the Patriarchate of Constantinople and entered a new phase in their history. With Christianity, the Russians were introduced to writing and, most importantly, to religious texts. At the same time, this religious conversion also led to the acceptance of the belief of chosenness, which had spread to Christianity from Judaism. Nestor, a Russian priest who lived in the 12th century, wrote in his work that although Russians were the last community to accept Christianity, they would undertake important missions in the future. He also attributed a mission to the Russian society by referring to the biblical passage that the feet will be the head and the head will be the feet. However, in the mentioned centuries, the Eastern Roman Empire was still the center of Orthodoxy. For this reason, the Russian Orthodox Church would remain for many years as a Metropolitanate under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. However, the increasing Ottoman pressure on Constantinople from the 1400s onwards created several historical opportunities for the Russians. In particular, the Byzantine agreement with the Pope of Rome in Florence in 1439 mobilized the Russian Church. Using this agreement as a pretext, Moscow severed its relations with Constantinople. In 1453, the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the center of the Orthodox world, opened a new page in Russian Theo-politics. Russian priests believed that Nestor's prophecy had been fulfilled and Moscow developed the concept of the Third Rome. Appearing in the 16th century, the Moscow-Third Rome concept soon became the ideological basis for the formation of the Moscow kingdom. In this article, the concept of Moscow Third Rome, which is one of the important turning points in Russian history, is analyzed through an analytical method. The background of the concept, the conditions that led to its emergence, its historical development and its reflections on the present day are emphasized.\n\nMuscovite Russia initiated an era of empire-building with the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan’ in 1552, creating new challenges for the Russian Orthodox Church with the addition of Muslim, Turkic Tatars and Chuvashes, and animistic, Finno-Ugric Maris, Mordvins, and Udmurts. The traditional historiography has presented the conquest as an Orthodox crusade against non-believers. However, the early years of the Orthodox Church in the region reveals a different history, in which the Church was driven by two different initiatives and neither was conversion. Secular economic support enabled the new churches, monasteries, and convents to secure Muscovite control over the region, whether it be from assisting the physical defense of the territory or by developing the region’s resources. At the same time, the Church began a dedicated effort to create a spiritual, Orthodox aura among the tsar’s new lands and peoples. Combined, these initiatives succeeded in making the Russian Orthodox Church integral to Muscovite political centralization over its expanding frontiers, paralleling the contemporary developments of confessionalization in Western Europe. While the conversion of the tsar’s new subjects was not the primary goal of the Church, its overall success along Muscovy’s frontier ultimately positioned its members to pursue the conversion of the local population once its earlier initiatives had succeeded."
