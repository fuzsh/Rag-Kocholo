        "text": "On 10 July, 1885, Theodot Nykyforovych Khoroshy was born in Fedorovka, 80 km from Chyhyryn (Chigirin), in Ukraine. At that time, it was in the Oleksandriya County of the Kherson province of the Russian Empire. Later, it was called \"Protopopivska,\" but it was eventually de-registered.\n\nTheodot Nykyforovych was born into the Cossack family of Nikifor and Anastasia (born Mazur) Khoroshy. The parents were serious Orthodox Christians, as were their whole families. Thus, there were monks in their family who lived ascetically on Mount Athos. A nun of their family was a tutor and choir-conductor at the Chyhyryn Monastery. A grandmother of Theodot had also become a nun in the same monastery.\n\nTheodot was thus raised within the Russian Orthodox Church at that time, and he began his early education in his village. During his formation, his favourite book was a twelve-volume collection of the Lives of Saints.\n\nDuring this time, he quickly learned how to read and write music, and he even began to write compositions on religious themes such as akathists.\n\nIn 1905, after he had graduated from school in his native village, he organised a choir in the village of Nerubayka (now Novoarkhangelsk district of Kirovograd region).\n\nHigher education\n\nLater, Theodot entered the pædagogical seminary in the town of Shamivka in the Kherson province of Ukraine.\n\nIn May, 1907, he passed the final exam at the teacher's seminary in the town of Shamivka in the Kherson province (now Znamyansky County of the Kirovohrad Oblast) [The opening of a \"church-teacher school\" in Shamivka, Alexandria County, was reported in the \"Kherson Diocesan Gazette\" in October, 1900.]\n\nHe then became a singing teacher in the village of Sosnivka in the Kyiv province (now Oleksandrivsky County of the Kirovohrad Oblast).\n\nIn 1909, during the summer, Theodot entered the courses for deacons for higher-level choir-conducting at Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kyiv.\n\nMarriage, 1909\n\nDuring the summer of 1909 Theodot Khoroshy was married to Christina Bevz in Kyiv.\n\nFurther education and experience\n\nDeacon Theodot (Khoroshy) was assigned to serve in Kaniv in the Zaporozhskaya Sich. In 1915, Deacon Theodot entered the 5th year of the Kyiv Theological Seminary as an external student.\n\nIn 1917, he graduated from the Kyiv Theological Seminary. In 1917, he also graduated from the Kyiv People's University. According to Fedor Shepel, Theodot graduated from the Kyiv People's University in 1917 rather than from the Saint Volodymyr University. However, after the 1917 revolutions, the names of institutions and places became fluid for a time. Although it is not necessarily clear, according to others, \"Kyiv People's University\" was one of several names later given to the Imperial University of Saint Volodymyr.\n\nIn 1917-1918, in particular, Deacon Theodot attended lectures entitled \"Ukrainian Culture\" by Professor Ivan Ohienko (the future Metropolitan Ilarion). After graduating the Kyiv People's University, Deacon Theodot combined his studies with diaconal service in Kyiv parishes.\n\nDuring the years of his studies, Deacon Theodot had managed to translate the Liturgical Psalter into Ukrainian. (It was published by the All-Ukrainian Orthodox Church Council in 1919.)\n\nBefore World War I, there had been a movement which promoted the translation of liturgical and scriptural texts into Ukrainian and Russian.\n\nRevolutions of 1917\n\nIn February and October, 1917, there were 2 revolutions in the Russian Empire. The first brought the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of a Provisional Government. The second, the Bolshevik Revolution, brought the end of the Russian Empire and the beginning of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\n\nTheodot enthusiastically welcomed the liberation struggle of the Ukrainian people which was associated with the revolutions, and he worked vigourously in the realm of promoting its spiritual revival.\n\nPresbyteral ordination, 1920\n\nOn 24 April, 1920, Deacon Theodot Khoroshy was ordained to the Holy Priesthood by Bishop Dimitriy (Verbitsky) of Uman.\n\nPastoral service\n\nDuring the following months, the Priest Theodot Khoroshy served as the rector of a temple in Ternivka, near the town of Smila, in the Cherkasy province. It was not easy for him at a time when the ungodly power of the Soviet communists ruled. He repeatedly spoke out against atheists during public debates.\n\nIn 1921, the Priest Theodot joined the non-canonical Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) that formed when Ukraine declared its independence during the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn March, 1923, Father Theodot was assigned to serve as Dean of the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin in Cherkasy.\n\nAfterwards, he became the chairman of the Cherkasy District Council of the newly-formed UAOC. This district was large, with 110 parishes.\n\nFor his dedicated and successful work for the UAOC, he was elevated to the dignity of archpriest, and he was awarded the right to wear a mitre during liturgical services.\n\nArrest and concentration camps, 1919-1937\n\nHowever, the period of the Ukrainian National Revival did not last long. In the late 1920s, Ukrainisation was curtailed. The UAOC did not escape repression. Almost all her clergy were shot or sent to concentration camps.\n\nAs the Bolshevik government continued its war against the Church, the communist authorities (GPU) arrested Father Theodot in March, 1929. He was interrogated until the end of April, 1930. The authorities demanded that he renounce his priesthood, for which he was promised freedom and various benefits.\n\nFather Feodot did not comply. On 30 April, 1930, he was condemned to 8 years in concentration camps in the far north of the Soviet Union: first on the Kola peninsula at the White Sea, then on Kond (the Gulag’s “Island of Death”), and a year later he was sent to Solovki.\n\nIn the late autumn of 1932, he was transferred to the camps of Ukhta-Pechersk (a distance of 800 km/497 mi traversed on foot), and he arrived in December. He he did not die from exhaustion due to the fact that the camp doctor took him as his assistant, and he instructed him in pharmacy and patient care.\n\nSuffering of his wife and of his son\n\nAs for the wife of Father Theodot, Christina, in March, 1930, she attempted to save herself and her son Gregory by divorcing her husband. She lived in Leningrad. In 1943, she and her son appeared in Kirovograd, seriously ill and swollen from hunger. She had somehow managed to escape from besieged Leningrad and to arrive in Tashkent. From there, she left for occupied Kuban, and then from there to Ukraine. After this, with the displacement of Ukrainians into Germany, she and her son emigrated to Munich in Germany, where she reposed on 3 March, 1949.\n\nRelease from exile, 1937; return to pastoral service\n\nIt is noteworthy that Father Theodot was released from his exile in 1937. The significance of this release lies in the fact that during the years 1937 and 1938, a very, very large number of bishops, priests, deacons, monks and nuns perished in the camps (mostly through being shot to death).\n\nNevertheless, after his release, Father Theodot wandered for a time in the Donbas region. He then settled and established himself in Kirovohrad (formerly Yelisavetgrad), where he was taken to a place where many priests from Odessa had been settled. Once, when Father Theodot had gone to a neighboring village, all the priests were taken out of the city and they disappeared without a trace.\n\nWorld War II, 1941\n\nIn the course of World War II (1939-1945), after the arrival of the Nazi German Army and the Nazi German occupation of Ukraine in 1941, the area gained relative religious freedom for a time, since the occupiers initially tolerated the revival of the Church for political reasons.\n\nDuring this time, Father Theodot participated in the organisation of a \"Higher Church Government\" (referring to the reconstruction of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church/UAOC).\n\nAt this time, Father Theodot was in Kirovohrad. He helped the Church. He organised and then led (as a dean) the Kirovograd Region. He became the rector of the UAOC parish in Kirovohrad which he founded (which operated in the so-called Greek Cathedral of Kirovohrad), The Communists had previously turned it into a granary. Soon, this \"Sobor\" could no longer accommodate all the Faithful. Believers turned to Father Theodot for help. He was often asked to send a priest to a new parish of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.\n\nWhen the question arose about the need for the appointment of new hierarchs for the revived UAOC, Father Fedot was one of the logical candidates.\n\nMonastic tonsure, 1942\n\nIn March, 1942, at an assembly of clergy and parish representatives in Kirovograd, Mitred Archpriest Theodot Khoroshy was chosen to be a candidate for the Holy Episcopate.\n\nWith the blessing of the Administrator of the Warsaw Metropolia in the freed Ukrainian lands, Archbishop Polikarp (Sikorski) tonsured Father Theodot to be a monk. He, himself, chose his new own name, Michael (after the Archangel Michael).\n\nEpiscopal ordination, 1942\n\nOn 12 May, 1942, with the blessing of Archbishop Polikarp (Sikorski), at Saint Andrew’s Cathedral in Kyiv, Hieromonk Michael (Khoroshy) was ordained to the Holy Episcopate by Archbishop Nikanor (Abramovich) of Kyiv and Chyhyryn, along with Bishop Igor (Guba) of Uman.\n\nAll the 4 above-mentioned bishops were ordained in this same year in Kyiv.\n\nEpiscopal service\n\nBishop Michael (Khoroshy) was assigned to be the Bishop of the Kirovograd Diocese. Under the attentive care of Bishop Michael, the Kirovograd Diocese developed and grew quickly.\n\nIn November, 1942, Bishop Michael was elevated to the dignity of archbishop.\n\nHowever, even during the German occupation, the Church was still under threat, and priests and bishops often suffered.\n\nWhen the German authorities began to intrude into Church matters, Vladyka Michael was transferred to the Mykolaiv (Nikolayev) Diocese. For some time, he also took care of Kyiv.\n\nThen the Nazis substantially changed their church policy, and they began to repress the Church, even to the extent of the execution of priests. Even under these difficult conditions, Bishop Michael did a considerable amount of work for the development of the Church.\n\nAfter the turning point in World War II and the apparent collapse of Nazi Germany, Archbishop Michael was forced to leave the diocese in November, 1943, and to emigrate westwards in November, 1944. He emigrated thus since he would inevitably face repression in Ukraine by the Soviet Communist authorities, probably execution, once they took power.\n\nDisplacement; exile, 1945\n\nAs the Soviet armies advanced westwards in 1945, Archbishop Michael (Khoroshy) became a refugee, and he travelled across Europe, through Odessa, Akerman in Bessarabia, Galicia, Warsaw, Slovakia, Vienna, and then to Germany. He moved to Germany along with the entire UAOC episcopate.\n\nIn Germany, he experienced the destruction of Dresden on 14 February, 1945, during a bombing raid by Anglo-American aircraft and a terrible fire.\n\nNevertheless, in Germany, Vladyka Michael was able to continue his pastoral work for the Ukrainian Orthodox, particularly amongst the captives, expatriated workers, and refugees.\n\nAfter the war, Archbishop Michael took an active part in the organisation of the UAOC in exile. With the blessing of Metropolitan Polikarp (Sikorski), Archbishop Michael was given the responsibility of looking after the Ukrainian Orthodox flock in camps in Bavaria, with its headquarters in Munich (the Bavarian capital), which he did very fruitfully.\n\nThus, in February, 1951, he arrived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (the Church’s Headquarters). However, with the concurrent arrival in Canada of Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), the UGOCC Consistory decided to install the senior bishop, Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), as “Metropolitan of Winnipeg and the Central Diocese, Metropolitan of All Canada, and Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada”. Archbishop Michael was at that time named \"Deputy Metropolitan\".\n\nArchbishop of Toronto and Eastern Canada, 1951\n\nAfter the enthronement of Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko), it was agreed that Archbishop Michael would go to Toronto, Ontario. Archbishop Michael arrived in Toronto on 15 August, 1951. It was a city without a bishop’s residence, chancellory offices, nor any sort of eparchial administration. Everything had to be built.\n\nA meeting in September of both priests and representatives of parishes called for an Ad-hoc Advisory Council to be formed. This council was dedicated to finding a building which would serve for the residence and chancellory. In order to secure the purchase of a residence, a collection was conducted throughout the parishes.\n\nThe first Clergy Conference and first Eparchial Assembly took place on 7-8 December, 1951. On 9 December, 1951, Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko) led the service of the enthronement of Archbishop Michael (Khoroshy) in Saint Vladimir's Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral at 400, Bathurst Street, in Toronto.\n\nThis recently-completed Temple then became the official cathedral of the Eastern Eparchy, and Vladyka Michael became the first Bishop of Toronto and the Eastern Eparchy. The Eastern Eparchy at that time consisted of 21 parishes and missions. The parishes of Eastern Canada were served by 17 priests, of which 8 were from the new immigration.\n\n— Archbishop of Munich (of Ukrainians in Bavaria (UAOC)) 1945-1950.\n\n— Archbishop of Toronto and the Eastern Diocese (UGOCC) 1951-1972 ; 1975-1977. Preceded by : Bishop Platon (Artemiuk). Succeeded by : Bishop Nicholas (Debryn).\n\n— \"Acting Primate of the UGOCC\" 1970-1972.\n\n— Metropolitan of Winnipeg and Canada (UGOCC) 1973-1975. Preceded by : Metropolitan Ilarion (Ohienko). Succeeded by : Metropolitan Andrew (Metiuk).\n\n— Former Metropolitan of Winnipeg and Canada 1975-1977.\n\nReflections\n\nMetropolitan Michael always had a keen concern for the spiritual education of his faithful, and especially of the children. He wrote theological works, translated into Ukrainian the “Psalter”, the “Horologion” (the “Book of Hours”), and a number of other works. He also composed music for the services of Vespers, Matins, and the Divine Liturgy. He was a confessor of the Orthodox Faith and a zealous arch-pastor. He was known for his humility and zeal for the development of Church life. However, he was known most of all for his life of prayer. Many people who remember the spiritually uplifting experience of services presided over by Metropolitan Michael echo the words that Metropolitan Andrew (Metiuk) later said at his grave-side : “He was a great intercessor before our Lord God, and for his people and his Church”.\n\nDuring the 25 years of service of Vladyka Michael, 19 majestic and large \"sobors\" were built in eastern Canada.\n\nIn 2020, Fedor Shepel wrote an article \"Metropolitan Myhailo (Khoroshy) and Kirovohrad Region : What they have in common\". In the introduction, he said :\n\nAt one time in the book 'Nobody Wanted to Die or be Repressed : Yelisavet-Zinovievsk-Kirovo-Kirovograd' I had to mention the church figure Mikhail Khoroshy (Good) in connection with the biography of those executed in Kirovograd in 1944 by Soviet punitive authorities and rehabilitated as a 'victim of political repressions' in 1993 by the poet and priest Mykola Gagaliy. Later I read about Mykhailo (Khoroshy) in Volodymyr Bosk's 'Historical Calendar of Kirovohrad Region'. The local historian wrote about him in particular : 'In 1941-1943 he was the rector of the parish of the Greek Cathedral in occupied Kirovohrad, and from 12 May, 1942, he was the bishop of Yelisavetgrad. On 31 May, 1942, he offered a solemn service on the occasion of the 130th anniversary of the construction of the Greek Church. Therefore, it is not surprising that I was interested in the speech of Fr Yuriy Mytsyk, delivered by him not so long ago at the sixth interregional conference \"Chyhyryn region in the history of Ukraine\" and dedicated to the biography of Mykhailo (Khoroshy). I think the following excerpts from this speech will be useful to local historians and historians of our region.\n\nLittle has been written about Metropolitan Michael. Even in émigré literature. There is little information about him in the archives of the Consistory of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) in Canada (Winnipeg)'.\n\nMr Shepel supplied information in that article, many details of which are included in the biography. He also commented that :\n\nWe will add that according to materials of 'Kherson Diocesan Newsletter' where there was a speech about church elders and parish guardianships at Alexander Nevsky church of the village of Fedorivka (Efimove), since its construction in 1895, peasants with characteristic surnames are mentioned : Sila Mazur Khoroxhy ; Omelyan Mazur.\n\nAfter his arrival in Canada in 1951, Vladyka Michael gained a reputation as a deeply religious, honest, loving, modest, merciful bishop, a zealous worshipper.\n\nMetropolitan Michael became a well-known theologian : author of a three-volume \"World Epic\" (in poetic form, he retold the history of the Old and New Testaments) ; \"The Psalter\" based on explanations of the Holy Fathers of the Church ; \"Explanations of difficult Places in the Gospel of John\" ; monograph \"Spiritual World\". However, in the memory of the Orthodox believers of Canada he is known primarily as a worshipper. As a composer, the bishop wrote : 5 concertos, \"Vespers and Matins\", \"Holy Liturgy with 4 Cherubic Hymns\", music for Taras Shevchenko's \"Muse\", and more.\n\nAwards\n\n• Shevchenko Medal\n\n• Medal of the Century of Canada\n\n• Honourary Doctorate in Law from the Ukrainian Free University (UVU) in Munich\n\n• Honourary Doctorate in Theology from the College of Saint Andrew in Winnipeg, Manitoba\n\nWritings\n\n• \"World Epic\" (3 vols.)
