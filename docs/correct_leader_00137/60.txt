Fiji's last democratically elected prime minister Laisenia Qarase has been found guilty of corruption in the High Court.

Laisenia Qarase was removed from office when Commodore Frank Bainimarama staged Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years in 2006.

Qarase was later charged with nine corruption-linked offences by the newly formed Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The charges relate to his employment as a director of an investment holding company.

He held the position before becoming the country's prime minister.

Fijian media reported that three assessors had returned a guilty verdict on the charges.

Justice Priyantha Fernandowill is expected to hand down his judgement on Tuesday.
