        "text": "Just over one year later, Mr Qarase, an ethnic Fijian, has demonstrated his political acumen by winning office at the head of his own newly created party, the nationalist Soqoso Duavata ni Lewenivuana, taking 31 out of 71 parliamentary seats.\n\nHis campaign focused on indigenous Fijians' fears of political domination by the minority ethnic-Indian population which already controls much of the islands' economic life.\n\nThe softly spoken former banker first spelled out his programme in July 2000 when he issued his blueprint to move Fiji forward from the political coup, promising political priority for native Fijians and affirmative action to advance and accelerate their development.\n\nBut he insisted no one will be disenfranchised or excluded in his planning a common future. He said ethnic Indians, who make up 44% of the population, would not be left out in the cold when the new constitution was drawn up.\n\nAiling economy\n\nUntil last year, Mr Qarase, 59, had been better known as a banker than as a politician.\n\nHis career has seen him managing the Fiji Development Bank before leaving public service in 1998 to head the Merchant Bank of Fiji.\n\nOne year later he became a senator, nominated by Fiji's powerful Great Council of Chiefs.\n\nBefore the May 2000 coup, Mr Qarase was a constant critic of the government of ethnic-Indian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nAs a banker he is acutely aware of the detrimental effect the coup has had on the country's economy.\n\nFiji's economy has been undermined by the crisis, with sugar production halted, tourist resorts closed and thousands of jobs lost following trade bans."
