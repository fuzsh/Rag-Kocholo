        "text": "Written By : SUN FIJI NEWSROOM. The case against former Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was called at the High Court in Suva yesterday.\n\nThe abuse of office case brought against him by the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption was called for mention before Justice Daniel Gounder.\n\nSuva lawyer Tevita Fa represented Qarase while FICAC was represented by prosecutor Paul Madigan.\n\nJustice Gounder has adjourned the case to July 1 when a hearing date is expected to be set.\n\nQarase had pleaded not guilty to five counts of abuse of office.\n\nIt is alleged that in May 2004, Qarase, while being Prime Minister, Minister for Fijian Affairs and chairman of the Native Land Trust Board abused powers held by his office to gazette regulations which went against the interest of the Fijian Affairs Board.\n\nIt is alleged that the gazette gave NLTB the powers to invest trust funds held by the trust board.\n\nIt is also alleged that Qarase, while being director of the Fiji Development Bank in 1992 allocated shares to companies owned by his family members without declaring his interest and relationship with the companies."
