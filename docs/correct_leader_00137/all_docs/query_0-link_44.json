        "text": "Since gaining independence from Britain which colonized it since 1789, in 1970, Fiji has had three constitutions – interspersed with periods of military or interim government rule. The constitution instituted in 1970, negotiated with the British, did not vary much from the Colonial Constitution of 1966. This Constitution was a product of the decolonization process that characterized this decade as Britain sought to give colonies more independence. During the 1960s Fijians were given a greater role in the administration of the island. In 1965 a constitutional conference held in London sought to pave the way for Fijians to take control of their own government and negotiate a deal between the two major ethnic groups. The resulting document expanded the franchise, previously exercised only by Europeans and selected Indians and ethnic-Fijians who had up to that point been represented by chiefs. Land rights guaranteed by the Deed of Cession were given constitutional protection. Fijian chiefs were given an effective veto in all important matters affecting the status of Fijians and in changes to the Constitution itself. Voters were classified according to ethnicity: Fijian, Indian, or General, which included citizens of any non-Fijian, non-Indian ethnicity. Legislative representatives were elected from the Indo and Fijian rolls. The Constitution gave power to Fijian politicians so long as they remained in partnership with the general voters and, critically, so long as the Fijian vote remained unified. Like the Constitution of 1966, the Independence Constitution had a bicameral legislature. The House of representative was elected by ethnic roll call and the Senate was appointed. The House had a membership of 52. With respect to the composition of the Senate, seven members were appointed by the Prime Minister, six by the leader of the opposition, eight by the Great Council of Chiefs (a purely Fijian body), and one by the Council of Rotuma. The appointment procedure into the Senate meant that ethnic-Fijians would almost be guaranteed a majority. A parliamentary system was established; with a Governor-General representing the Queen of England as Head of State.\n\nFiji faced its first constitutional crisis in 1977, when the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP) narrowly won the parliamentary elections. Ethnic Fijian Governor General Ratu Sir George Cakobau called on Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's Fijian Alliance to form a caretaker government, pending new elections scheduled for September of that year. Splits within the NFP and its hesitation to take office also exasperated the situation. In September, Mara’s Alliance Party won and took control of the government.\n\nFiji’s second constitutional crisis and first two coups came in 1987. The two coups resulted from ethnic Fijian concerns that Indo-Fijians dominated the government. Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka led the two 1987 coups. The first coup, in May 1987, disposed the Timoci Bavadra led government. In October of that same year, Fiji’s second coup rejected Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of State of Fiji. Fiji’s long formed name changed from the Dominion of Fiji to the Republic of Fiji. The military coup caused the exodus of thousands of Indo-Fijians, who faced ethnic discrimination at the hand of the government. In 1990 the interim government promulgated a new Constitution which sought to strengthen ethnic Fijian control of the country. Under this Constitution the positions of President and Prime Minister could only be filled by ethnic Fijians. Thirty-seven of the seventy parliamentary seats could only be filled by ethnic Fijian. This meant that ethnic Fijians retained a majority of seats in parliament. The constitution abolished all forms of non-racial voting. In 1992 Rabuka became Prime Minister under the 1990 Constitution. However, he could only do so with the aide of the Indo-Fijian dominated Fiji Labor Party (FLP) and later the NFP. FLP and NFP exacted from Rabuka a speedy constitutional review, which the 1990 constitution mandated.\n\nIn 1995 Rabuka established the Constitutional Reviewed Commission. The review process resulted in Fiji's third and current constitution, the 1997 Constitution. The Constitution sought to balance ethnic representation in Fiji's government. It led to the election of Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minster, Mahendra Chaudhry, in 1999. However, Fiji experienced another coup on the anniversary of the election of Chaudhry's People Coalition government. Led by George Speight, rebels took control of parliament on 19 May 2000. They held Chaudhry, other ministers, and staff hostage for fifty-six days. President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara denounced the coup, but dismissed the government. Mara sought to take executive control for himself and declared a state of emergency. Like in 1987, the rebels claimed fears of an Indo-Fijian dominated government. On 29 May 2000 President Mara left office, questions remain as to whether he was deposed or resigned. The military led by Commodore Vorege (Frank) Bainimarama assumed control and abrogated the Constitution. With the backing of the Great Council of Chiefs, the military installed an interim government headed by Laisenia Qarase. Ethnic Fijians dominated this new interim government. The 2001 elections produced no clear majority but Qarase was appointed as Prime Minister. The Supreme Court declared Qarase's government unconstitutional in 2003.\n\nThe following year saw Vice President Ratu Jope Seniloli and four other prominent figures convicted for their part in the 2000 coup. In 2005 Qarase supported a bill granting amnesty to perpetrators of the 2000 coup, the Reconciliation Tolerance and Unity Bill. This moved further strained the already tense relationship between the government and the military. In late 2006 Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase with a deadline set for December 4. The demands focused mainly on the removal of three bills dealing with the 2000 coup and land rights. His demands also included the resignation or removal of Fiji Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes and the dropping of police investigations into whether his threats were seditious. Bainimarama wanted Qarase to remove other senior government officials whom he felt had connection with the 2000 coup. The government promised to make certain concessions, but the military remained suspicious and felt that the promised concessions were not enough. The military then called for Qarase's resignation. On December 5 the President signed legal papers dissolving the government out of necessity. On December 6, 2006 Bainimarama announced that the military had officially taken over the government. In 2009, the Court of Appeals ruled the 2006 coup illegal sparking another constitutional crisis. President Ratu Josefa Iloilo abrogated the constitution, dismissing all office holders under the Constitution. These included judges and the governor of the Central Bank. He then appointed Bainimarama as Prime Minister and imposed Public Emergency Regulation. Epeli Nailatikau replaced Iloilo as President in 2009. Bainimarama lifted the Public Emergency Regulation in 2010. Bainimarama also announced nationwide consultation for a constitution building process.\n\nIn 2013, Fiji adopted a new Constitution, marking the end to a two year controversial constitution making process which the government perceived as part of the long term solution to Fiji’s protracted political crises and instability. Prime Minister Bainimaramara described the country’s recent history as “a vicious pattern [of] elections followed by ineffective governance, followed by coup, followed by elections and then another coup, with the cycle continuing and Fiji’s overall situation regressing further and deeper.”\n\nAfter several previous attempts, a draft constitution was released to the public of Fiji for comment in March 2013. After considering public comment, the 2013 Constitution was given assent by the President 6 September 2013 and called for elections by 30 September 2014. In response to public comment, the new constitution strengthens protection of certain communally owed lands, increases property rights, creates a single constituency, and establishes a Parliamentary system.\n\nThe 2013 Constitution purports to address some of the greatest challenges of the past. For example, the document finally addresses the deep ethnic divide in Fiji. Each voter has one vote of equal value, and votes are cast for political parties and independent candidates, who are given seats in Parliament based upon the proportion of the vote rather than on ethnicity. Further, the Constitution places no restrictions on the ethnicity of persons wishing to hold political positions.\n\nHowever, the document continues to face criticism. Chapter 10, for instance, grants immunity to government officials, including the President, police force, and judiciary, for any involvement in the government following the 2006 coup. Critics also fear that the creation of a single, national constituency will favor larger political parties and that the built-in rigidity of the Constitution may allow laws passed by the current government to remain in effect.\n\nThe Executive\n\nThe President heads the executive as Head of State and Commander In Chief of the military. He/she is presented with any Bill passed by Parliament for assent and is given 7 days to reject the Bill or it will take the force of law. In order to qualify for nomination to the office of President, a person must have a distinguished career in any aspect of national or international life, hold only a Fijian citizenship, cannot be a member or office-holder in any political party, nor can he/she be a candidate for another office. The nominee must also have a clear criminal record for the 6 years preceding the nomination. Upon vacancy of the office of the President, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition each nominate one name, which are then presented to the Speaker to put on the floor of Parliament for a vote. The President may serve up to two three-year terms. The President may resign his/her position. Alternatively, the Prime Minister may initiate investigation proceedings should the question arise as to the President´s ability to perform the functions of office or as to misbehavior. Upon the request of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice is to establish a tribunal or medical board, upon whose advice Parliament must rely when determining whether to remove the President from office.\n\nThe Constitution also establishes a Prime Minister as the head of government and chairperson of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is the leader of the political party that wins more than 50% of the total number of Parliamentary seats and is responsible for keeping the President generally informed about the issues relating to the governance of Fiji. The Prime Minister may resign from office or may be removed by a vote of no confidence in Parliament. The Prime Minister selects the Ministers of the Cabinet, all of whom are accountable to Parliament. The only Constitutionally-mandated Cabinet Minister is the position of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is appointed by the Prime Minister and is the chief legal adviser to the Government. The Attorney-General must have at least 15 years of experience as a legal practitioner and cannot have been found guilty in any disciplinary proceeding.\n\nThe Legislature\n\nParliament makes up Fiji’s legislative branch of government, vested with the power to make laws for the State. Any member of Parliament may introduce a Bill, with the exception of Money Bills, which may only be introduced by a Cabinet Minister so vested with such authority. Parliament must approve any international treaty or convention by which the State would be bound. Members of Parliament are elected by a multi-member system of proportional representation. A political party or independent candidate must receive at least 5% of the total number of votes in order to receive a seat in Parliament. Parliamentary candidates may be nominated by a registered political party or as an independent candidate. The first general election under the 2013 Constitution will yield a Parliament consisting of 50 members, and future elections will maintain the ratio of members to population as represented in the first election. Unless Parliament is dissolved—by the President on advice of the Prime Minister or by Parliamentary resolution—Members of Parliament serve 4 year terms.\n\nThe Judiciary\n\nThe judiciary of Fiji consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Magistrates Court, and such other courts as created by law. The Supreme Court sits at the top of the judicial hierarchy as the final court of appeals and has original jurisdiction to hear and determine constitutional issues. It is headed by the Chief Justice as President of the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal consists of a Judge appointed as the President of the Court of Appeal and other Justices of Appeal. The Court of Appeal determines appeals from the final judgment of the High Court regarding the Constitution and its interpretation or other judgments as prescribed by law. The High Court Consists of the Chief Justice, other Judges of the High Court, Masters of the High Court, and the Chief Registrar of the High Court. The High Court has unlimited original jurisdiction over any civil or criminal proceedings and original jurisdiction over matters arising under the Constitution and its interpretation. The High Court may hear appeals from lower courts. The Magistrates Court consists of the Chief Magistrate and other Magistrates appointed by the Judicial Services Commission. The authority and jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court and other courts is conferred by written law."
