        "text": "The state Fiji’s in:\n\nA chronology of economic / politically significant events since independence\n\nOctober 10, 1970\n\nFiji becomes an independent nation within the British Commonwealth after 96 years as a colony.\n\nApril 12, 1987\n\nCoalition led by Dr. Timoci Bavadra defeats Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara’s Alliance Party. Antipathy between descendants of Indian migrant sugar workers and indigenous Fijian islanders is a prominent feature.\n\nApril 14\n\nDr. Bavadra announces a cabinet comprising mainly Indian Fijians.\n\nApril 23\n\nProtest marches are held petitioning the Governor-General for constitutional changes to ensure Fijian leadership.\n\nApril 26\n\nMr. Apisai Tora, formerly Communications Minister under Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, announces a civil disobedience campaign.\n\nApril 27\n\nAlliance Party’s leading Indian member quits, believing Fijian party supporters are destroying the multi-racial character of the party.\n\nMay 4\n\nFive buildings, including the Attorney General’s offices, are petrol-bombed in Lautoka.\n\nMay 6\n\nPermission is denied for a rally of government opponents when Parliament reopens on May 8.\n\nMay 10\n\nFijians of all parties are invited to join a Fiji United Front to give outnumbered indigenous Fijians a united voice.\n\nMay 14\n\nLieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka and 10 armed men march into the House of Representatives, overthrowing the elected, Indian-dominated government of Prime Minister Bavadra.\n\nSeptember 22\n\nGovernor-General brings Bavadra and Mara together to form an interim bipartisan government.\n\nSeptember 25\n\nRabuka’s troops stage a second coup and he annuls the 1970 Constitution.\n\nOctober 7\n\nRabuka declares Fiji a republic.\n\nOctober 16\n\nFiji is thrown out of the Commonwealth.\n\nJuly 25, 1990\n\nPresident Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau decrees a new constitution establishing a bicameral legislature. Great Council of Chiefs appoints senators and president for a five-year term.\n\nJune 2, 1992\n\nRabuka is sworn in as Prime Minister.\n\nFebruary 28, 1994\n\nRabuka retains prime ministership in a snap election.\n\nSeptember 1996\n\nA Constitutional Review Commission headed by former NZ Governor-General Sir Paul Reeves recommends Fiji adopt a non-racially biased constitution, calling for a return to cross-communal voting. Brij Lal is one member of a 3 person Commission that produces a report of over 800 pages, written on the basis of 694 recommendations. The Great Council of Chiefs wholly endorses the report.\n\nSeptember 30, 1997\n\nFiji is readmitted to the Commonwealth.\n\nJuly 27, 1998\n\nNew constitution includes cross-communal voting and establishes the first human rights commission in the South Pacific.\n\nDecember 1998\n\nRabuka announces that his ruling Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei Party has formed a coalition with the Indian dominated National Federation Party and the mixed-race United General Party.\n\nMay 18, 1999\n\nFiji’s defeated Prime Minister formally resigns, ending 12 years in office and making way for an Indian-dominated Government.\n\nFormer trade unionist Mahendra Chaudhry is sworn in as Fiji’s Indo-Fijian Prime Minister after the Labour Party wins the first general election under the 1997 constitution.\n\nMay 2000\n\nThe Taukei Movement, an underground political organisation instrumental in the 1987 coups, stages two anti-government rallies in two weeks.\n\nMay 19, 2000\n\nGeorge Speight, the son of a Fijian opposition MP, tries to overthrow the Government and is committed to revoking the 1997 constitution. The President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, declares a state of emergency in the hope of restoring law and order. Speight declares this ‘illegal’.\n\nJuly 13, 2000\n\nHostages are finally released; no one has been killed.\n\nSpeight is jailed, and moved to an island off the coast of Suva. Treason charges (still pending) are laid.\n\nMahendra Chaudhry embarks on a world tour.\n\nLaisenia Qarase is appointed as the head of an interim Government with no specific constitutional commitments.\n\nAugust 8 and October 2000\n\nEnd, respectively, of the derogation deal agreed in 1999 and the import credit scheme. [*]\n\nSeptember 14, 2000\n\nStory in the New York Times gives details of George Speight’s ambitious plans for a Fijian mahogany industry worth approximately $100 million. The Chaudhry government had threatened these plans, favouring a British company rather than the Americans with whom Speight was associated, and was accused of “selling out landowner interests to curry favour with the British and protecting sugar cane farmers.” (Britain could help with important sugar subsidies, but they wanted Commonwealth Development, the British Company, to get the timber concession). Speight had meanwhile been trying to bring together landowners and had positioned himself as executive of a new land trust. There were major landowner protest marches against the Chaudhry government in late March and on 19 May, the day Speight captured the parliament.\n\nNovember 15, 2000\n\nHigh court Justice Anthony Gates upholds the 1997 Constitution, calling for the appointment of a multi-party Government by the ousted President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara.\n\nReturn to Main Article\n\nENDNOTES\n\n* Central to many concessionary trade agreements such as SPARTECA are the so-called ‘Rules of Origin’ criteria. These allow various items to be taken into account in estimating what constitutes ‘local content’. It is necessary to show that 50% of the cost price of goods is ‘local content’; where this 50% rule is relaxed it is called a ‘derogation’. New Zealand relented to pressure from Fiji and relaxed to 45%. Australia also granted a 6% derogation for one year in 1998. [Back]\n\nSources: The Sydney Morning Herald, The Fiji Times, FijiLive.com"
