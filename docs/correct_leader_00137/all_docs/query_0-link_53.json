        "text": "Laisenia Qarase was Fiji's Prime Minister in 2000-2006. In his own words, he tells of his rise from village obscurity to public service, from bank management to the high office of Prime Ministership.\n\nAfter two election wins, his SDL Government was subsequently couped in 2006 - a crisis that led to Qarase's eventual imprisonment as PRISONER 302 in 2012 for 243 days. Here, he tells us why, and what impact that politically-contrived fall from grace had on him and his family personally, socially, financially and politically. Laisenia Qarase writes clearly with authority, humility and deep authenticity of the one who has 'been there'.\n\nThis is a book which will inspire, and from which there is much to learn.\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\nStarting this book was the beginning of what can only be described a rollercoaster ride of an election here in Fiji!\n\nI wasn't in Fiji during the 2000 or 2006 Coups. So this book certainly provided some insights into what was happening behind the scenes during these times and the events that led up to them.\n\nQuite enjoyable!"
