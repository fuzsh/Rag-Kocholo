        "text": "Fiji's military commander announced today that he had taken control of the country, confirming the South Pacific nation's fourth coup in less than two decades.\n\n\"As of 6 o'clock this evening, the military has taken over the government, has executive authority and the running of this country,\" Commodore Frank Bainimarama told a televised news conference.\n\nMr Bainimarama said he had invoked special powers under the constitution to assume some powers of the president, and was using them to dismiss the prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, from office and appoint an interim replacement. He said he would surrender presidential powers next week, and would ask the country's great council of chiefs to restore them to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who he expected would then appoint a full interim government.\n\nElections to restore democracy would follow some time after that, he said. Mr Qarase said earlier that he had been placed under effective house arrest, and that he was powerless to stop the military takeover.\n\n\"What they want to do, they have the power to do it, the firepower to do it,\" he said earlier today. \"If they want to carry out an illegal act ... that is their choice, but I'm not going to resign.\"\n\nArmed troops surrounded Mr Qarase's house and manned checkpoints at government buildings and other points throughout the capital, Suva.\n\nMr Bainimarama has been threatening to \"clean up\" Mr Qarase's government for weeks, and in recent days demanded that he resign or be ousted.\n\nThe takeover has already been condemned internationally.\n\nThe prime minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark announced in parliament that defence ties with Fiji were being severed and that Fijian officers and their families would be barred from entering New Zealand. Mr Bainimarama is believed to have children studying there.\n\n\"This is an outrage, what is happening in Fiji today,\" she told reporters in Wellington.\n\nThe Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said Australia would impose similar conditions if it was confirmed that Mr Qarase had been removed, adding that two international groups - the Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies, and the South Pacific Forum - would consider suspending Fiji.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, John Howard, said earlier that Mr Qarase had asked Canberra to send troops to try to prevent the coup, but that he had rejected the request. \"The possibility of Australian and Fijian troops firing on each other in the streets of Suva was not a prospect that I for a moment thought desirable,\" he said. Mr Bainimarama has warned any foreign intervention would be fiercely opposed by the Fiji military.\n\nIn a gesture that the government was clinging to power, about half a dozen ministers were with Mr Qarase in his house.\n\nFiji, with about a population of around 900,000 people, is among the richest and most developed nations in the South Pacific, attracting up to 400,000 tourists a year to resorts built on idyllic beaches.\n\nThe coup is the fourth in 19 years, as the country has lurched from one political crisis to the next since the military twice grabbed power in 1987 to ensure political supremacy for indigenous Fijians among a population that includes a large ethnic Indian minority.\n\nGunmen angry those advantages were being eroded seized parliament in a 2000 coup that brought Mr Qarase, a moderate nationalist, to power in a deal brokered by Mr Bainimarama. Mr Qarase has since won two elections.\n\nMr Bainimarama and Mr Qarase have long since fallen out. Mr Bainimarama wants the government to repeal legislation that would pardon conspirators in the 2000 coup, and quash other bills he says unfairly favour indigenous Fijians, and to drop sedition investigations into senior military officers.\n\nMr Qarase had offered to suspend the contentious bills, but says he cannot agree to any demands that go outside the law."
