After a military coup in 2006 the country is governed by a military junta. Fiji became a republic 1987, and even if Queen Elizabeth II no longer have a constitutional role she is still hailed as Paramount Chief by the Great Council of Chiefs.\n\nBackground\n\nFiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized his opponents, crippled Fiji's democratic institutions, and refused to hold elections.[1]\n\nEconomy\n\nFiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies though still with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with 400,000 to 500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights, and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased significantly. Fiji's current account deficit reached 23% of GDP in 2006.[2]\n\nPresident\n\nEpeli Nailatikau (₩) ( - )\n\nParamount Chief\n\nElizabeth II (₩) ( - )\n\nPrime Minister\n\nFrank Bainimarama (₩) ( - )\n\nNation\n\nFiji\n\nFijian Polities\n\nDominion of Fiji (1970-1987)\n\nMicronesian Polities\n\nGuam (From 1898)\n\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (From 1978)\n\nNeighbouring Nations\n\nNew Zealand (Commonwealth realm)\n\nSamoa\n\nTonga\n\nTuvalu (Commonwealth realm)\n\nVanuatu\n\nReferences"
