        "text": "On August 4, 2006, Fijian Vice President Joni Madraiwiwi and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase met with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing.\n\nLi said that Fiji was the first Pacific Island country to establish diplomatic ties with China. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations over 30 years ago, the China-Fiji relations have progressed steadily and seen a frequent exchange of high-level visits and a deepening of political mutual trust, he said. Bilateral cooperation in such fields as economics and trade, culture and education has been fruitful and both countries have maintained good coordination in regional and international affairs, he added.\n\nMadraiwiwi and Qarase said that the China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum which was successfully held in April provided a good platform for China and Pacific island countries to reinforce their economic and trade cooperation. They appreciated the sincerity shown in China's efforts to actively implement measures to support island countries to develop economy and thanked for China's support for and assistance in their country's construction over the past years. They noted Fiji is willing to broaden the mutually beneficial cooperation with China in such fields as agriculture, trade, investment and tourism to push for in-depth development of bilateral ties for the benefit of both peoples. The Fijian leaders also reiterated their country's adherence to the one-China policy.\n\nOn the same day, Li held talks with his Fijian counterpart Kaliopate Tavola and the two sides exchanged in-depth views on bilateral relations as well as regional and international issues of common concern."
