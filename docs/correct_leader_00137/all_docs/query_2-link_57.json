It is all about trying to resolve the differences that now confront our country.”\n\nBut his rival said that the military was planning a peaceful transition to an interim government.\n\nBainimarama has repeatedly threatened to remove Qarase’s government unless it drops three pieces of legislation, including a bill that would grant amnesty to those involved in a 2000 coup.\n\nThe prime minister has bowed to most of Bainimarama’s demands, including suspending the three bills, but Bainimarama is still not happy.\n\nHe has accused Qarase of having people associated with the 2000 coup by armed indigenous nationalists in his government and high public offices.\n\nFiji has suffered three coups and a bloody but unsuccessful mutiny, during which Bainimarama was almost killed, since 1987."
