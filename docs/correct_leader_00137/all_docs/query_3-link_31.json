        "text": "After staging a military coup and taking power in 2006, Frank Bainimarama now appears on track to be Fiji's next democratically elected prime minister when the country votes on September 17. Take a look back at the eight years since the last time Fiji went to the polls.\n\nThe 2006 Fiji coup traced its history to the coup in 2000, the third in the country's history, and the first time Frank Bainimarama took power.\n\nHe relinquished control to a civilian government led by Laesenia Qarase, who went on to win elections in 2001 and 2006.\n\nThe six years between the two coups saw a high level of tensions between the military and the civilian government.\n\nThe Qarase government faced repeated calls to resign. By the end of 2006 he was forced from power, Fiji had its fourth coup, and Frank Bainimarama was once again in charge.\n\nMay 2006\n\nFiji's last election ran from May 6 to 13, 2006.\n\nAhead of the poll, military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama criticised the timing of the election, and urged Fijians to vote for candidates based on policies, rather than ethnicities, which have traditionally defined election results.\n\nLaisenia Qarase's SDL party retained a slim majority, winning 36 of the 71 seats.\n\nRelations between the military and the SDL party devolved over the controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which would have offered pardons to some involved in the 2000 coup.\n\nSeptember 2006\n\nRelations between Mr Qarase and Commodore Bainimarama continued to decline, as the military commander criticised the government's leniency towards coup supporters.\n\nIn October, Commodore Bainimarama gave Mr Qarase a three-week ultimatum to take steps, including dropping two controversial bills - one relating to the 2000 coup and another covering indigenous coastal rights.\n\nMr Qarase and president Ratu Josefa Iloilo attempted to remove Commodore Bainimarama, who was inspecting Fijian troops in Iraq, from office, but their nominated candidate declined.\n\nIn November, Mr Qarase held talks with Commodore Bainimarama in New Zealand, but no resolution was reached.\n\nOn returning to Fiji, Mr Qarase conceded to some of the ultimatum's demands, but Commodore Bainimarama stood firm and several government officials, including Mr Qarase, went into hiding.\n\nDecember 2006\n\nCommodore Bainimarama said he had taken control of Fiji, and the president dissolved the parliament.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand declined appeals for assistance from Mr Qarase.\n\nFiji's membership of the Commonwealth was temporarily suspended, and local media faced censorship.\n\nJanuary 2007\n\nCommodore Bainimarama took on the role of interim Prime Minister, and announced plans for elections to be held by 2010.\n\nApril 2007\n\nAfter Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs refused to endorse his government, Commodore Bainimarama sacked the body.\n\nTen months later, he reconvened the body and appointed himself as chairman.\n\n2008\n\nCommodore Bainimarama announced elections promised for 2009 were being postponed, saying electoral reforms he wanted to put in place were not ready.\n\nLeaders of the Pacific Islands Forum warned Fiji it would be suspended if it did not show progress towards elections.\n\nApril 2009\n\nFiji's Appeals Court ruled the 2006 coup was illegal and the military regime appointed afterwards was invalid.\n\nIt ordered President Ratu Josefa Iloilo to appoint a new prime minister.\n\nPresident Iloilo repealed the Constitution, sacked the judges and reappointed Commodore Bainimarama as interim prime minister.\n\nThe president promised elections would be held by September 2014.\n\nMay 2009\n\nFiji was suspended from the Pacific Islands Forum.\n\nCommodore Bainimarama outlined plans for elections in 2014, after a new constitution to be completed in 2013.\n\nSeptember 2009\n\nFiji was fully suspended from the Commonwealth over delays to the election timeline.\n\nAugust 2011\n\nThe annual conference of Fiji's Methodist Church was cancelled after the interim government said it went against public emergency regulations.\n\n2012\n\nEmergency laws that had been in place in Fiji since 2009 came to an end ahead of preparations for drafting a new constitution.\n\nFiji's interim government was accused of interfering in the drafting of the constitution by the Constitution Commission.\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nAmid delays in release of the draft constitution, Commodore Bainimarama said Fiji would get a new flag to reinforce a new identity.\n\nMarch 2013\n\nFrank Bainimarama confirmed he would stand for election in Fiji's next polls.\n\nAugust - September 2013\n\nThe Fijian government released and signed into law the final version of the country's new constitution, which paved the way for elections in September 2014.\n\nThe new Constitution called for a single-chamber 50-member Parliament, with elections to be held every four years.\n\nIt also included stronger protections for communally-owned i'Taukei, Rotuman and Banaban lands, and called for the compulsory teaching of the i’Taukei and Fiji Hindi languages at primary school level.\n\nFebruary-March 2014\n\nFrank Bainimarama handed over control of the country's military to his second-in-charge, Land Force Commander Brigadier Mosese Tikoitoga.\n\nThe now Rear-Admiral Bainimarama stepped down to focus on his campaign for his newly-formed Fiji First Party, with elections announced for September 17.\n\nAustralia moved to 'normalise' relations with Fiji, joining New Zealand in easing travel sanctions against senior members of the interim government.\n\nAugust - September 2014\n\nWrits were issued for Fiji elections, and the elections office unveiled the list of official candidates for the election.\n\nAn international team led by Australia, Indonesia, India and Papua New Guinea was invited to observe Fiji's elections.\n\nPre-polling began ahead of the September 17 election.\n\nFinal opinion polls a week out showed Frank Bainimarama's party with a strong lead."
