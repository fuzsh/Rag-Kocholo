        "text": "In Canberrra John Howard, the prime minister of Australia, said he had turned down a request from Qarase for military help.\n\n“I did not think it was in Australia’s national interest to\n\nbecome involved. The possibility of Australian and Fijian troops firing on each other in the streets of Suva was not a prospect that I, for a moment, thought desireable,” Howard said.\n\nAustralia had sent three warships to the waters off Fiji in case it needed to evacuate its nationals from the country.\n\nBainimarama had warrned that his soldiers would oppose with force any attempt at foreign intervention in the crisis.\n\n‘Clean up’\n\nBainimarama has been engaged in a long-running stand-off with Qarase’s government, claiming it is corrupt and has been soft on those behind a previous coup in 2000.\n\nBainimarama has said elections will be\n\nheld to restore democratic rule\n\nHe has repeatedly warned that unless Qarase agreed to a series of military demands he would carry out a “clean up” of the government.\n\nOn Monday troops moved in to disarm the country’s police tactical unit, the only division of the police allowed to carry weapons.\n\nBainimarama said the move was intended to avoid the police using their weapons against the military.\n\nIn the following hours large numbers of troops were deployed across Suva, setting up roadblocks and checking vehicles, apparently looking for members of Qarase’s government.\n\nRoadblocks were also set up in other major towns, including the main tourist hub of Nadi.\n\nQarase, who won a second term in office in May elections, had said earlier that Bainimarama’s threats to topple him amount to treason."
