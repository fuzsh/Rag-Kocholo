        "text": "Suva was again alive with rumours, particularly that the Coalition Government was about to break up and that Chaudhry, unpopular in his own party, was going to be dumped. Rumours of pending coups were also common by April 2000, although this was hardly a surprise in a town given to a high degree of political gossip and experience of earlier coups. Among the best informed it was just a matter of time. Daily Post editor Mesake Koroi was alert to more than just rumour. A Lauan, he was later to become an adviser to Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, with whom he had a chiefly tie. A couple of columns in April were prophetic. On 8 April 2000 he noted the reemergence of Tora had driven the devil's fear into the Indian community in Nausori, north of Suva. Shop owners told him people were no longer buying goods and those on leasehold land were scared. On 17 April 2000 he asked how genuine was Chaudhry's resolve to help the indigenous Fijian community, saying he had created a lot more foes than friends. He blamed the land issue: 'Land is also regarded as sovereignty, something to be defended to the death, like honour.'\n\nKoroi said Fijian political thinking had been unpredictable and split and noted Mara had twice fallen victim at elections: 'But will history repeat itself again through another disruption of parliamentary rule? I hope not. But the signs are that [Chaudhry] is in for a rough ride unless he moves as far away from the land issue as soon as possible.' He added that 'the same players are again at work'."
