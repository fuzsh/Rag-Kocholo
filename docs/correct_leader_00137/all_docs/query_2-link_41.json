        "text": "Chinese President Hu Jintao said in Beijing Wednesday that China is ready to work with the Fijian side and push forward bilateral relations under the guidance of the China-Fiji joint declaration.\n\nHu told visiting Fijian Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase that there are many favorable conditions for the growth of bilateral relations as the two countries are both developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, trusting each other politically and conducting mutually beneficial economic cooperation.\n\nChina and Fiji established full diplomatic relations 29 years ago. Hu noted that bilateral relations have had fruitful results in such areas as economy, trade, culture and education.\n\nChina appreciates the one-China policy upheld by the Fijian government and its support of China's reunification cause, he said.\n\nQarase said his current visit to China has been fruitful as the two sides have reached consensus on strengthening cooperation in different areas.\n\nThe prime minister pledged that Fiji will continue to uphold the one-China policy and believes bilateral relations will have new development in the coming years.\n\nQarase arrived in Beijing Monday for a six-day working visit to China, his second as prime minister since 2002. He has met with Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during his stay in Beijing.\n\nAside from Beijing, Qarase will also visit Xi'an in northwest China and Guangzhou in south China.\n\nChina, Fiji issue joint press communiqué\n\nChina and Fiji issued a joint press communiqué in Beijing Wednesday. The full text of the communiqué is as following:\n\nJoint Press Communiqué Between the People's Republic of China and The Republic of Fiji Islands\n\n1. At the invitation of Premier Wen Jiabao of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase of the Republic of the Fiji Islands paid a working visit to the People's Republic of China from 28 June to 3 July 2004.\n\nDuring his visit, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase met President Hu Jintao and Chairman Wu Bangguo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China and had talks with Premier Wen Jiabao. The two sides exchanged views in depth on bilateral relations and international and regional issues of common interest and reached consensus on a wide range of issues.\n\n2. Leaders of both countries believed that the Joint Statement Between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands on Consolidating and Promoting Friendly Relations and Cooperation signed on 27 May 2002 in Beijing is a historic document with realistic significance. It set the framework for the development of their bilateral relations in the new century. The two sides expressed satisfaction at the progress made in recent years in their friendly cooperation in all fields and pledged to uphold the guideline and principle laid out in the Joint Statement, continue to implement the related agreements and take their bilateral relations to a new high.\n\n3. The two sides expressed satisfaction at the frequent exchange of visits maintained at present between their leaders and officials. They are ready to press ahead with official and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation on all fronts and at all levels in a bid to increase mutual understanding and friendship.\n\nThe two sides were satisfied with the agreements signed during this visit on economic and technological cooperation, phytosanitary cooperation, believing that the consensus reached in these agreements and this joint press communiqué as well as during the Beijing consultations between officials of the two foreign ministries in November 2003 will give a new boost to their expanded cooperation of mutual benefit.\n\n4. The two sides reiterated the importance of stronger bilateral trade and economic cooperation, agreeing that their mutually beneficial cooperation driven by economic complementarity has lifted the well-being of the two countries and peoples. The two sides reaffirmed their readiness to continue exploring new areas and approaches in trade and economic cooperation with a view to fully tapping its potential and enriching the bilateral ties.\n\nThe Chinese side reassured its support for the Fiji government's effort to grow its economy and deliver a better life for its people and pledged continuous economic and technical assistance within its capacity, to which the Fiji side expressed gratitude.\n\nThe two sides agreed to promote comprehensive development of bilateral relations by enlarging cooperation in areas such as culture and education, science and technology, tourism, health and human resources development.\n\n5. The Fiji side reiterated its government's commitment to the one-China policy, recognizing the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legal government representing the whole China and Taiwan as an inalienable part of China. The Fiji side is opposed to any attempt to create \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan\", to \"Taiwan independence\" and to Taiwan's participation in international and regional organizations that are only open to sovereign states. The only relations Fiji will maintain with Taiwan are in the promotion of unofficial economic and commercial ties.\n\nThe Chinese side highly appreciates the position of the Fiji side. The Chinese side congratulated the Fiji government for its achievements in reducing domestic conflicts, developing national economy, and promoting regional cooperation. China holds the view that Fiji's economic development and social progress will help maintain and promote stability and prosperity in the South Pacific region.\n\n6. The two sides highly evaluated their productive cooperation in international and regional affairs and agreed to enhance coordination and cooperation in the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the Pacific Islands Forum and Forum Parliamentary Assembly, the South Pacific Tourism Organization and other international and regional organizations so as to jointly safeguard the interests of the two countries as well as other developing countries.\n\n7. Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase expressed, on behalf of the Fiji government and delegation as well as in his own name, sincere thanks to Premier Wen Jiabao and the Chinese government and people for their warm welcome and gracious hospitality during his visit.\n\nDone in Beijing on 30 June 2004.\n\n(Xinhua News Agency July 1, 2004)"
