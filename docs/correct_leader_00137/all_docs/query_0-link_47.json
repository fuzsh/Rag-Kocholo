        "text": "The European Parliament,\n\n- having regard to its resolution of 6 July 2000 on the situation in Fiji and the Solomon Islands[1],\n\nA. continuing to watch closely the ongoing political crisis in Fiji after a coup on 19 May 2000 led to the suspension of Parliament, repeal of the Constitution, resignation of the democratically elected Prime Minister and of the President, and imposition of martial law on 29 May 2000 by the Fijian Army,\n\nB. whereas on 3 July 2000 an Interim Civilian Administration was formed in Fiji under a new Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase; whereas the military continues to retain executive authority and is now recruiting an extra two hundred soldiers,\n\nC. welcoming the release of the hostages, including the deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and other cabinet ministers, but regretting the continued delays in bringing the rebel leader George Speight and others to trial, including the rebel Peceli Vuniwa and three soldiers who have also been charged with treason after the murder of a Fijian policeman during the coup,\n\nD. gravely concerned about the continuing tension between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians as Fiji's two major Indo-Fijian political parties - the deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudry's Fiji Labour Party [FLP] and the National Federation Party [NFP] - refuse to take part in the interim government until the 1997 multi-racial constitution is restored,\n\nE. whereas continued uncertainty over the democratic future of Fiji aggravates the economic crisis in Fiji as unemployment rises with the textile industry predicting forty per cent bankruptcies, and a rate of inflation that looks set to double by the end of the year,\n\nF. whereas the Fiji Human Rights Commission estimates that thousands of people still remain displaced on Fiji's two main islands, with over 500 Indo-Fijians still in a refugee camp in Lautoka,\n\nG. whereas the next Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group Meeting in New York on 15 September 2000 must consider applying further sanctions if Fiji does not provide an internationally acceptable plan for the restoration of democracy,\n\nH. noting that continued ethnic and racial tensions in Fiji and the Solomon Islands will undermine European Union confidence in the aim of the fourteen-nation Pacific Island Forum to establish a Pacific Regional Trade Agreement [PARTA],\n\n1. Takes note of the arrest of George Speight and sixteen aides, along with the decision by Fiji's Chief Magistrate Salesi Temo to keep those accused of treason in prison until the next court hearing on 15 September 2000;\n\n2. Strongly condemns the stirring up of ethnic tensions and the destruction of Fijian-Indian property, noting that Fijian Indians make up 44% of Fiji's population of 800 000;\n\n3. Urges the Interim Civilian Administration and Fiji's new Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase to work towards returning Fiji to full democracy and towards ending the crisis which is crippling Fiji's economy: delaying sugar production, dramatically reducing activities in the tourist sector and putting thousands out of work after recent trade bans;\n\n4. Notes Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's recently stated aim to return Fiji to constitutional parliamentary democracy, including the provision and protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens and groups, and also the judicial equality of all citizens and their protection under the rule of law administered by an independent judiciary;\n\n5. Urges the Commission to continue to monitor developments closely, not only in Fiji and but also in the Solomon Islands and across the South Pacific region in view of the increase in religious and ethnic tensions in the area;\n\n6. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the applicant states and the ACP States, and to the constitutional authority of Fiji."
