        "text": "Fiji's military chief Commodore Bainimarama Tuesday announced that he had seized control of the government at a press conference held in the capital Suva. \"As of 6 o'clock this evening, the military has taken over the government, has executive authority and the running of this country,\" said the military chief.\n\nThe move comes after the president Ratu Josefa Iloilo called upon him to find a legal solution to the crisis and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's refusal to resign.\n\nBainimarama said he had assumed the powers of the presidency, and was thereby dismissing Qarase from office and appoint an interim government.\n\nHe maintained that while he was in control, he would ask the Great Council of Chiefs to appoint Ratu Josefa Iloilo as President at its next meeting.\n\nBainimarama said Jona Senilagakali would become caretaker Prime Minister until an interim administration is appointed.\n\nIn an earlier address, Laisenia Qarase said he would not resign as the elected Prime Minister.\n\nBainimarama said the takeover was \"not permanent\". The commander urged all Cabinet ministers in the Qarase government to resign within a month, adding that \"the Constitution will remain.\"\n\nSo far Suva is stable with no sign of chaos after the army chief announced military takeover, Xinhua's witness said Tuesday.\n\nJin Renwu, a Chinese restaurant owner, said his restaurant had seen several diners and that no-one appears afraid of the coming government transition.\n\nJin's Sichuan Restaurant is located in the central district of the city. He revealed that some neighboring stores had shut from noon onwards while others remained in business.\n\n\"But there are fewer people on the street than before,\" said Jin.\n\nFei Mingxing, the Political Counselor of Chinese Embassy to Fiji, told Xinhua that the embassy has informed the Chinese in Suva to take measures against particular situations.\n\nOver 7,000 Chinese live in Fiji, most of them in the capital Suva. Fei said the embassy is monitoring the situation in Fiji and will make every effort to help Chinese citizens.\n\nTension has been rising for weeks in Fiji due to a standoff between the army chief and the prime minister.\n\nBainimarama said Sunday the Prime Minister has to resign to allow the military to clean up the Government. Soldiers have entered Qaraseâ€™s home, who said he is under arrest.\n\nHowever, Bainimarama said he has no intention to hurt Qarase and other ministers.\n\n(Xinhua News Agency December 5, 2006)"
