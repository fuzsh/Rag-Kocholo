        "text": "Fiji was today suspended from the Commonwealth, three days after its democratically elected government was overthrown in a military coup.\n\nThe decision was made by foreign ministers from the UK and eight other nations at an emergency meeting in London after Laisenia Qarase, the country's prime minister, was forced from office by the military in the republic's fourth coup in 20 years.\n\nThe Ministerial Action Group, which brings together the foreign ministers of nine Commonwealth countries elected to deal with serious or persistent violations of its fundamental political values, unanimously demanded the restoration of constitutional rule and democratic government \"with immediate effect\".\n\nCmdr Frank Bainimarama seized power on Tuesday, installing a military medic as prime minister.\n\nIn a statement, the secretary general of the Commonwealth, Don McKinnon, said that they had agreed that the takeover was a \"serious violation of the Commonwealth's fundamental principles\".\n\nThe suspension means that representatives of the military regime are barred from taking part in Commonwealth meetings and activities, including get-togethers of its heads of state.\n\nThe ministerial action group (CMAG) called on all other Commonwealth countries to take \"appropriate bilateral and multilateral action\" to encourage a speedy return to democracy.\n\n\"Such measures should be directed at the military regime to the fullest extent possible,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"However it also stressed the need to have regard to the economic welfare and wellbeing of the Fijian people in deciding what action to take.\"\n\nMr McKinnon said that the Commonwealth would remain \"engaged\" with the new military rulers in an effort to press forward the restoration of democracy.\n\nHe pointed out that it appeared to have been a \"very unpopular coup\" on the ground, with many ordinary people seeing it as an argument between the military and some of the government.\n\nIt was also important that the Commonwealth gave its support to those people pressing for new elections.\n\nHe said that, while the military takeover had been bloodless, an angry backlash might result in the situation turning violent.\n\nUnder Commonwealth rules, there is a two-year time limit for the restoration of democracy in such situations.\n\nBut the Commonwealth hopes to see things move more quickly than that, said Mr McKinnon, who may embark on a mission to Fiji.\n\nThe UK suspended military co-operation with Fiji earlier this week and has put in place contingency plans to protect the expatriate community should the security situation worsen.\n\nThe foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, who did not attend today's meeting, has condemned the \"wholly unconstitutional\" takeover as \"a major setback to the process of democracy in Fiji\".\n\nBritain was represented at today's meeting of CMAG by Lord Triesman, the junior Foreign Office minister."
