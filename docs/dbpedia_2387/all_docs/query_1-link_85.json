B. Von Rosenberg, Wednesday night. Funeral services were held Friday.\n\nFive children, Mrs. George Mauer of San Francisco, Cal., Mrs. A. E. Von Rosenberg and Mrs. Alfred J. Heintze of La Grange, Charles Kainer of Beaumont and Ed Kainer of La Grange, survive.\n\nSubmitted by Rosemary Ermis\n\nLa Grange Journal, Thursday, February 1, 1934\n\nGrandmother Kainer Passes Painlessly Across the Divide\n\nWednesday evening, at 8:45 oâclock, Grandmother Annie Kainer answered the summons, and as if drifting into natural sleep, calmly left the scenes of the day and journeyed hence.Â A death that was peaceful, was inspiring; she seemed to realize that her journey to another world was on.Â At the time of her passing her spiritual adviser, Rev. S. A. Zientek, priest in charge of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, her niece, Miss Annie Kainer of High Hill, and her daughter, Mrs. Louise Heinze were at her bedside; Dr. F. J. Guenther, family physician, was also present.\n\nMrs. Kainer had been in delicate health for many months, yet in her daily life, she maintained her disposition to carry on, and was the recipient of careful nursing and attention from her daughter, Mrs. Martha Rosenberg and her niece, Miss Kainer.Â For Comfort she never suffered, and although such moments of irritation materialized, and frequency of early memories throttled her vision, she remained the same, kind, âMutterâ Kainer that has characterized her kindness to others in the many years she lived in La Grange.\n\nDeath designated its approach as it wills; last Wednesday the day was ideal, real Spring, the mocking bird perched on the trellace near the Rosenberg home and sang lustily; Mrs. Kainer occupied a cozy seat on the porch and for once, with all indications good, her daughter absented herself with her husband from home; before their return the voice of the mother became silent.Â The homecoming, after a few hourâ absence may be surmised, in its touching effect.\n\nFriday morning religious services were held at the home, the body was taken to the Sacred Heart church, mass was held and Rev. Zientek, in calm voice and much affected, paid a worthy tribute to the departed woman.Â Inspiring were his words as he pictured her neighborly life and friendliness to others; not for worldly gain, or prestige, but for the pleasure that it gave her to do something for others.Â Such was the life she had lived, and at a sacrifice to herself.Â The body was buried at the side of her husband who had preceded her in 1907.\n\nComing to America when a mere child, with her parents, Mrs. Kainer spent her childhood days in Fayette County near to High Hill.Â Here, after she grew to womanhood she was united in marriage with Jos. Kainer, and the union was blessed with nine children.Â The family came to La Grange in 1898, from Schulenburg, and continued to reside here.Â Adolph, a son died in 1899; Jos. The eldest son, died as the result of injuries received in an automobile wreck in 1923.Â One child died in infancy, another at the age of fourteen years.Â The mother bore these afflictions with a fortitude that was to be admired.Â When old age came to her, and the management of her hostelry became too heavy, she discontinued the Kainer Hotel and made her home with daughter, where she continued to live until she passed to her reward.\n\nMrs. Kainer is survived by the following children: Mrs. Geo (Anna) Mauer of San Francisco, California; Mrs. Alf J. (Louise) Heintze, Mrs. Alex E. (Martha) Von Rosenberg and Edw. Kainer of La Grange, and Chas. Kainer of Beaumont.Â There are seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.Â Mrs. Kainer was 83 years, 7 months and 19 days old when her earthly journey ended.\n\nInclement as was the weather on the morning of Friday, the friends of the family gathered and p aid their last respects, accompanied the body to the Sacred Heart Church and to the cemetery.Â Weather conditions may have significance, we do not know, but as the thunder roared and the rain fell, the voice of her spiritual adviser came clear and strong, and acquiescence was the more pronounced, to His will.Â It may also be mentioned, in form as reference, that Mrs. Kaiser died shortly after her last, beautiful prayer; at each dayâs close, she uttered the same prayer: âI want to go home.âÂ May it not be said: âHer prayer was heard?â\n\nTranscribed by Connie F.
