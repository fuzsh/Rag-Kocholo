R. and Mary Richards, was born in Martinsburg, N. Y., November 16, 1876. When she was but a child the family emigrated to Iowa, settling on the old stock farm near Otranto. In 1900 they moved across the line into Mower county, Minnesota. Here she was married, October 21, 1908, to Andrew Stiley. After their marriage they made their home in Carpenter, Iowa. Here, ten years ago, a little son, Richard A., was born to them.\n\nIn May 1917, they moved to Hinsdale, Montana, which has since been their home. In this new home another little baby boy was born unto them; but he only tarried for a little, then answered the call of the Good Shepherd, who said \"Suffer the little ones to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.\"\n\nFor about three months Mrs. Stiley has been in failing health; the last five weeks of which have been spent with relatives in the vicinity of her girlhood home.\n\nShe passed from the scenes and loves of this life into the Great Beyond October 1, 1922.\n\nIn addition to the husband and son, Richard, who mourn a true wife and devoted mother, there also remain two brothers, Robert, on the homestead in Mower county, Minnesota, and E. B., across the line in Worth county, Iowa; also four sisters, Mesdames Susie Schuyler, Osage, Iowa; Maggie Brown, Austin, Minn.; Belle Wuest, Malta, Montana, and Elle Gibson, Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nMany other relatives and a host of friends \"rise up to call her blessed.\"\n\nThe funeral services were largely attended, conducted from the old home above mentioned, Wednesday, October 4, at 2 p. m. Rev. William Galbraith, who was Mr. and Mrs. Stiley's pastor at Carpenter, Iowa, where they were members of the M. E. church before they moved to Montana, brought the Scripture message from Job. 17:11, \"My days are past, my purposes are broken off.\"\n\nMembers of the Dahl family of Lyle, Minnesota, rendered beautiful the messages in song.\n\nThe body was laid to rest in the beautiful Woodbury cemetery. The wonderful collection of floral offerings was but a slight token of the esteem in which Mrs. Stiley was held, in a large circle of friends.\n\nSource: The Glasgow Courier, Glasgow, Montana, 13 Oct. 1922, page 3, column 2.\n\nCredit: Mitch Helle 9/2015\n\n©2015 MNGenWeb\n\nMrs. George DeVore Funeral Held In Albert Lea\n\nFuneral services for a former Lyle resident, Mrs. George (Ada) DeVore, 63, of Albert Lea, Minnesota, who died at St. Mary's hospital in Rochester, were held December 14 at First Presbyterian church in Albert Lea, with the Rev.

The last day and night he had no pain. He had his right mind until noon before he died, and was ready and anxious to go. After that he did not talk and seemed to sleep himself away. He had been a member of the M. E. church about 50 years and was looked up to and respected by friends and neighbors as an upright conscientious Christian.\n\nHis remains were brought to the residence of John Bryan, the neighbor nearest the old homestead, by his son Jon Harris, where the funeral services were conducted by Rev.

On the 26th anniversary of his birthday, he was married to Miss Mary Twiner, it being the 21st anniversary of her birthday. In deference to the wishes of his father, they remained in Wales until after his death, and set sail from Liverpool with their seven children, July 18, 1845, for New York City, where they arrived after the usual voyage of five weeks. They went as far west as Burlington, in the territory of Wisconsin. Here they endured all the vicisitudes incidental to frontier life. Two children were born there, one of whom died in early infancy.\n\nIn 1856, Mr. Watkins and family emigrated to Mower county, Minnesota, settling upon the homestead in Austin township, June 21. In June 1862, Mr. Watkins made a public profession of religion and was baptized by Rev. H. I. Parker, in to the fellowship of the Baptist church in Austin, of which church he remained a member to the time of his death. Mrs. Watkins died May 1, 1865. Since that time Mr. Watkins has made his home with his children, principally with his son David upon the old place.\n\nHe died peacefully Sunday noon, Dec. 18, leaving behind to his children and friends, the priceless legacy of a good name and noble christian example. His funeral services were held at the Cedar City school house, Wednesday, Dec. 21, Rev. W. E. Stanley, of Austin, preaching the sermon and Rev. A. Trowbridge giving a memorial address.\n\nFather Watkins, as everybody loved to call him, left eight living children, Mrs. Mary C.

P. Kittridge, was held at Cedar City school-house, Saturday, January 29th. Although the day was very stormy, yet there was a large number of people gathered to pay the last tribute of respect to the departed, and to sympathize with the bereft husband and motherless children, who mourn the loss of a good, faithful wife and mother. The sermon was preached by Rev. Alfred Cressey, of Austin, and several of the Methodist choir, by request, went down to assist in the singing.\n\nMrs. Kittridge had the measles about two years ago, and was very sick, a cough settling upon her lungs and never leaving her. Mr. Kittridge, it will be remembered, was in partnership with Mr. Lambert about two eyars, and last spring, his wife, who was then in failing health, wanted to go back to her home in the country, so in June the partnership was dissolved, and Mr. Kittridge, with his little family, moved back to the farm, which is about a mile south of Cedar City. She was confined to the house but a short time. She leaves five children, the eldest eleven years, the youngest but three. Mr. Kittridge and his motherless babes have the sympathy of many friends in this sad bereavement, and may the Father of the afflicted be his comforter and support.\n\nSource: The Mower County Transcript, 2 Feb. 1881, page 3, column 3\n\nCredit: Mitch Helle, 9/2015\n\nNOTES:\n\nFrom cemetery listing for Cedar City Cemetery, on MNGenWeb/Mower:\n\nKittridge, Mary Ann 4 JAN 1852 - 27 FEB 1881\n\nKittridge, David P. 31 JUL 1835 - 28 AUG 1885\n\nSee Findagrave memorial for \"Mary Ann Kittredge,\" for photo of her tombstone.\n\n©2015 MNGenWeb\n\nCARTER.\n\nAt the home of his son in Lyle township late Thursday night, March 12, 1896, John.
