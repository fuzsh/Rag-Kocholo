        "text": "Direct to Bureau of Naval Personnel Entries by Name:\n\nA-C\n\nD-G\n\nH-M\n\nN-R\n\nS-Z\n\nThe original Bureau of Naval Personnel (bp) entries for those Navy personnel who died in combat have mostly been transcribed by Don Kindell, Navy History Researcher from Ohio, an old colleague and friend to whom I have long been indebted. Six groups totalling some 31,000 names (bp1 to bp6) are listed here, and added to the main US Navy Lists - see table below.\n\nThe US Navy Memorial (nm) site has the casualties for many of the larger ships, and \"On Eternal Patrol\" (ep) has carefully researched all submarine losses, so faced with the 14 volumes of the Bureau of Naval Personnel entries, priorities were set. For example, the first three groups included the Battle of Savo Island, small craft such as PT-boats, Yard minesweepers, landing ships and craft etc., Armed Guards, Medics serving ashore with the Marines, SeaBee and UDT personnel, many of the aircrew lost in the Pacific, some light cruisers, and destroyer escorts.\n\nAlthough not strictly combat losses, and therefore apparently not included in the Bureau volumes, the three destroyers that went down in the December 1944 typhoon off Samar, as well as losses due to other marine causes, have also been added, using the POW/MIA Agency (pm) and HMS Cavalier destroyer (dd) sites.\n\nNote: 1941-1942 Philippines Campaign casualties and subsequent POW deaths. The BuPers records were made available in 1947 by which time only a limited amount of information would have been available. It is there important to access recent research on these losses.\n\nNotes: dd = declared date of death; only some casualty codes are known at present; dates missing from the BuPers lists have been added from the POW/MIA Agency (not identified) or from other identified sources.\n\nOnly the first three groups (bp1-bp3) have been arranged by by DATE, but will form the basis of a more complete list of Navy casualties by day, month and year.\n\nDirect to Main US Navy Lists by Name:\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nIJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM N O PQ R S T UV W XYZ\n\nBUREAU OF PERSONNEL ENTRIES BY
