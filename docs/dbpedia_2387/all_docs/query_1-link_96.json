He was crossing the pasture of Mr. Chas. Lidiak at the time and evidently expired just as he was going through a barbed wire fence. Mr. Lidiak, we understand, saw Mr. Sebesta as he was crossing the pasture and remarked upon the fact that he was walking along so spry.\n\nFrom what facts we can glean Mr. Sebesta had eaten heartily at breakfast time, seemed hearty and cheerful, and later in the morning decided to walk over to the home of a neighbor, and was en route there when he was stricken by some heart trouble and probably died instantly. The body was found about 11:30, we understand, partially resting on the barbed wire fence, and with a couple of cuts from the barb showing on his face.\n\nHe was tenderly picked up and carried to his borne, after inquest proceedings had been conducted by Judge A.. J. Ratliff, who returned a verdict of death from natural causes. Funeral arrangements were made and the body laid to rest in St. Michael’s Cemetery Tuesday morning at 9 o’clock. Rev. Jos. Szymanski conducted the funeral services.\n\nHe was a man of jovial disposition, a hard worker, true to his family and friends, a splendid neighbor at all times, and his untimely death is deeply and sincerely deplored.\n\nPall bearers were Chas. Lidiak, Wm. and Frank Ripper, Frank Pavlik, Sr., Frank Humplik and V. Rataj.\n\nMr. Sebesta was 83 years old at the time of death. He was born in 1850 in Moravia, Europe, and served several years as a soldier in that country. He came to this country early in life, first following railroad life. He was with the old Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railroad when it built into Weimar, liked the location and decided to stay here. Here he followed the trade of brick mason, and was one of the builders of the opera house, Herder store, Townsend rock building, Dr. Potthast residence in the western part of town, and many other structures. He farmed along with his trade of brick mason. He first located in the Borden section, afterward in Ammannsville, and finally in 1911 located in the Osage section, where he lived up to the time of his death.\n\nAt the age of 32 he was united in marriage to Miss Amelia Brovec of the Holman section. To this union nine children were born, six of whom survive. The survivors ae his widow and Mrs. Joe Ulbrich, Mrs. Emelia Mikus of Three Rivers, Emil Sebesta of Cameron, John Sebesta of Weimar, Chas. Sebesta of Columbus, and Mrs. Christina Machart of Weimar; also sixteen grandchildren. Had he lived a short while longer the couple would have celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.\n\nWeimar Mercury, November 24, 1933, page 1\n\nSebesta, Leroy Joseph\n\nCouncilman Leroy Sebesta Dies\n\nColumbus City Councilman Leroy Joseph Sebesta, 72, passed away Saturday, October 2, 2004, at MD Anderson Hospital after a short illness with cancer.\n\nSebesta's death came as a blow to those with whom he served on the City Council.\n\n\"To me, the city has lost one of its most loyal supporters,\" said Councilman Richard Heffley, a long-time friend of Sebesta. \"Leroy loved the city of Columbus and his wisdom will be deeply missed.\"\n\nHeffley's sentiments were echoed by other members of Council.\n\n\"He loved this city and did a lot for the city,\" said Councilman Milton Wavra.\n\n\"He loved being on the City Council,\" said Councilman Brian Berger. \"He really cared about this city.

His achievements as a civil engineer were very satisfying but his greatest enjoyments were in retirement where he had been using his skills, knowledge and experience to better the community he and his wife so love, and spending time with the friends and grandchildren he cherished.\n\n\"The fact that he loved this city and came back says a lot for him,\" Frnka said.\n\n\"He dedicated a lot of his time to the city and had a lot of affection for the city,\" Dungen said. \"That was apparent by his moving back to his hometown.\"\n\nIn 2001, he was elected as a Columbus city councilman and was re-elected in 2003.\n\nHe was a member of St. Anthony's Catholic Church and the Knights of Columbus Council 2971, where he was recently elected as grand knight.
