        "text": "First, browse the full list of upcoming Byrne Seminars. Our current course list includes section numbers for each seminar below the course description.\n\nFall Semester\n\nYou can choose to register for a Byrne Seminar when you select your other classes. Typically, this happens at an advising day over the summer. Similar to your other classes, Byrne seminar registration is done through WebReg. Enter the subject code “090” and the course number “101” to get a list of Byrne Seminars for the semester.\n\nIf you do not select a Byrne seminar during the summer, you may register through the Add/Drop week in any Byrne Seminar that still has openings.\n\nSpring Semester\n\nYou can register for a Byrne Seminar through WebReg. You may find the Online Schedule of Classes useful in determining which courses are open and will fit best into your schedule. Enter the subject code “090” and the course number “101” to get a list of Byrne Seminars for the semester.\n\n*Note that SEBS sections begin with “11” rather than “01” and will be found at the bottom of the page.\n\nCitizenship, Institutions, and the Public\n\nJonathan Holloway (President, Rutgers University)\n\nWe live in an era of extreme political polarization, increasing social instability, and declining faith in the nation’s institutions and the virtues of civil discourse. How might we, as individuals, chart a path out of this troubling state of affairs? What role can we play in confronting the accumulating challenges in our society? What should we reasonably expect of our institutions and what do these institutions owe us? What are our responsibilities to be good civic actors when we are confronted by a public discourse—the arena where political rhetoric, corporate news, social media, advertising, and opinion culture interact—that appears uninterested in speaking to our common values?\n\nThis course addresses these questions via a series of conversations with distinguished leaders from the corporate, political, non-profit, media, and faith communities, all of which help constitute “the public.”\n\nCourse Number: 01:090:101:01\n\nWe invite Rutgers–New Brunswick faculty to teach a Byrne First-Year Seminar in the 2024-2025 academic year. This program, which will celebrate its 17th anniversary in 2024, connects full-time Rutgers faculty with our new students as they begin their undergraduate study. We are excited about the long-term potential of these seminars to reshape our students’ sense of what Rutgers means as a research university. Connecting students early-on with our faculty make a significant difference in the ways they define their academic and career goals. We hope that many of the outstanding scholar-teachers across the New Brunswick/Piscataway campuses will join us.\n\nComplete Your Application\n\nQuestions? Contact James Register at byrneseminars@rutgers.edu or call 848-932-6971.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nByrne Seminars are taught by full-time faculty and/or senior administrators. Courses range in topics meant to arouse the intellectual curiosity of our undergraduates and introduce first-year students to the resources of Rutgers.\n\nThe following are requirements of all Byrne Seminars. Failure to meet the requirements will result in the cancellation of the course.\n\nCourses must meet for 1.25 hours once per week for 10 weeks, or for 2.5 hours once per week for 5 weeks.\n\nThere is a 20-student maximum in each seminar; 10-student minimum.\n\nAll instructors must review, sign, and return the Byrne Instructor Agreement by the established date.\n\nThe individual listed on the Instructor Agreement must be the person who is teaching the seminar. Our office must be notified if any changes are necessary.\n\nUsing the syllabus template, instructors must submit a copy of the syllabus to our office by the established date. Posted office hours must be included on the syllabus.\n\nRequests for seminar enhancement funding must be submitted via our website by the last week of September for the fall semester, or last week of February for the spring semester.\n\nGrading and Course Material\n\nThe course syllabus must clearly demonstrate how grades will be assigned and include a grading rubric. Students who are successful in the Byrne Seminars will earn one academic credit; therefore, the assigned work must be reasonable. Attendance and class participation are essential and should make up at least 50 percent of the course grade. To earn a passing grade, students should not miss more than two class meetings.\n\nReading: Based on successful seminars, we recommend a maximum of 30 pages of reading per week. Students should be asked questions based on the required readings which will prompt discussion during class.\n\nWriting or Presentations: Based on successful seminars, we recommend a maximum of 5-7 pages of formal writing, 15-20 minute presentations, opportunities for group work, or some combination over the course of the entire semester.\n\nCompensation\n\nAs of the 2024–2025 academic year, faculty and senior administrators will receive $2,500 research stipends. Faculty who co-teach a Byrne Seminar with one other colleague receive $2,000 each. Research funds will be transferred into your account via journal entry within 30 days after the completion of the course. The account information and the name of your business contact person must be sent to Senior Program Coordinator James Register by the established date. Please note that research funds will not be transferred until our office has received the signed agreement, a copy of your syllabus, your account information and your business contact person.\n\nThe Office of the Provost has set aside a limited amount of funds which may be used for field trips, outside speakers, and special events. Requests for seminar enhancement must be submitted via this online form. Funding is available on a first come, first served basis.\n\nField Trips\n\nAll field trips for which you want support from the Office of the Provost must be approved beforehand. All students are required to participate in the field trip. A trip itinerary and waiver forms must be submitted no later than two weeks after the seminar start date. Appropriate transportation for your trip, NJ Transit tickets or a bus, will be arranged. Instructors will also be reimbursed for admission fees/tickets and for reasonable food requests depending on the duration of the trip.\n\nOutside Speakers\n\nOur office will pay up to $250 toward a speaker’s fee for outside guests only. Rutgers employees are not eligible for guest speaker compensation. For payment of speakers and honoraria, the name, and contact information of speaker; date of speaking engagement; course information including the course name, date, time, and location; expectations of the speaker, such as name of speech or topic discussed, question and answer, discussion, book signing, etc.; and the agreed-upon cost of speaker, invoice, and W9 form are needed."
