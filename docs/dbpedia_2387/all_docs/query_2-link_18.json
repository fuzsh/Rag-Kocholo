        "text": "Glenn W Simon\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nWe searched the National Archives Catalog and located the Muster Rolls of U.S. Navy Ships, Stations, and Other Naval Activities, 1/1/1939 - 1/1/1949 in the Records of the Bureau of Naval Personnel (Record Group 24) that may include the muster rolls for the USS Thatcher in the 1940s. We also located the Logbooks of U.S. Navy Ships and Stations, 1941 - 1983 in Record Group 24 that might be of interest to you. Some of these records have been digitized and may be viewed online using the Catalog.\n\nYou may also wish to search the World War II War Diaries, Other Operational Records and Histories, ca. 1/1/1942 - ca. 6/1/1946 and the World War II War Diaries, 12/7/1941 - 12/31/1945 in the Records of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (Record Group 38) for information about the USS Thatcher. Many of these records have been digitized and may be viewed online as well.\n\nPlease contact RR2R at archives2reference@nara.gov for access to any non-digitized records or for more information about the series listed above.\n\nFinally, we also suggest that you search the website of the Naval History and Heritage Command for additional resources related to the USS Thatcher during World War II. You may contact them directly for further assistance.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your family research!\n\nDonald M. Simon is listed in the USS Thatcher's November 1944 Report of Changes as transferring from the USS St. Louis to the USS Thatcher on Nov. 10, 1944.\n\nDonald M. Simon is listed as a crew member on the December 1944 and March 1945 Quarterly Muster rolls of the USS Thatcher. On May 20, 1945, Simon was injured during a kamikaze attack and was transferred to the USS Gosper for treatment that same day. I could not find any record of him returning to the Thatcher.\n\nThe following is the USS Thrasher's After Action Report for May 20th, 1945:\n\nThe other May 20th casualties included:\n\nABBOTT, Milton G 606 39 31 CRT(AA)(T) Chief Radio Technician KIA ANDERSON, Louis C. 955 60 35 S2c Seaman, Second Class Transferred to USS Gosper (APA170) for treatment BIELOT, John 642 92 26 F1c Fireman, First Class Missing BRACKETT, William E. 955 60 12 S2c Seaman, Second Class Missing BREITMAYER, John W. 244 73 84 RdM2c Radarman Second Class Transferred to USS RELIEF (AH1) for treatment CARVER, J F 575 84 96 S2c Seaman, Second Class KIA CHABOT, Roland E. 2048462 RT2c Radio Technician, 2d Cl.

Two sailors were injured during the attack. It seems that many of the USS Thatcher's crew were on leave while the ship was being repaired."
