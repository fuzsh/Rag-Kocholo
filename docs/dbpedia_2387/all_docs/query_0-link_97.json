Jansa and his wife have reared a large family of children, having two grown sons, but lately they have not been getting along well, and both decided to separate. They had a settlement here some weeks ago, she paying him some money and he leaving. A few days since they began living together again, and Saturday the family was all together and seemed to be getting along nicely.\n\nWord was sent here early yesterday morning that Mrs. Jansa was found in bed dead by her children, shot through the head, and that Jansa was gone.\n\nMrs. Jansa had nine living children and two small ones were in bed with her when her husband did the shooting. A big hole was shot in her right cheek and the thumb of her right hand was shot off. He also tried to kill his oldest son, but the boy made his escape.\n\nAfter shooting his wife, Jansa gave the gun to his 12-year-old boy and asked him to shoot him.\n\nA crowd of about 50 citizens of Engle and neighboring farms hunted all morning for the missing man, who was caught about 100 yards from the house in the tall grass. He had a gun and six-shooter when found.\n\nThe child states Jansa made him move in the bed so he could shoot his wife while the lad was pleading with him not to commit the deed.\n\nJansa claims a family row was the cause of the killing and seems to realize the awful deed he has committed.\n\nThe prisoner is about 60 years of age and talks good English. He confessed that he did the shooting when he surrendered.

Edward Burleson, of Texas.Â His grand-father was an old Revolutionary soldier, and lost his life in the defense of the city of Charleston, during that struggle.Â His father, Robert Jarmon, raised a regiment of Tennesseeans, not far from Nashville, and commanded the same, as Colonel, in the battle of New Orleans.Â The deceased himself was a young soldiers (sic) in the little band of heroes that defended that city.Â Stephen Jarmon was a cotemporary and acquaintance of Generals Jackson, Houston, Crockett, and others of that period, and belonged to that old style of men which is now rapidly passing away.Â He was an old backwoodsman, and spent the best portion of his life amid the hardy and exciting scenes of the frontier.Â During the late war his sympathies and active assistance were given with great liberality to the South, and his efforts to assist the Confederate cause remained a matter of pride and satisfaction to him up to the closing scenes of his life.Â His beloved wife, Mrs. Eliza H. Jarmon, with whom he lived happily for more than 50 years, still survives him, and with children, grandchildren, and other relatives and friends, mourns the loss of the good old man.\n\nTranscribed by Donna Baker\n\nANNIE NEE JASEK\n\nColorado County Citizen, March 20, 1980, Page 2\n\nFuneral services for Annie Nee Jasek of Fayetteville were held March 1q3 at St. Maryâs Catholic Church near Ellinger under the direction of Henneke Funeral Home.\n\nInterment was at St. Maryâs Cemetery.Â The Rev.
