An international charter was granted on January 1, 1915 to the Rotary Club of Piqua, Ohio, No. 135. The Piqua club was the fifth club to be organized in the state of Ohio. The original fifteen charter members elected William K. Leonard as their first president.\n\nThe weekly meetings of the club began at the Piqua Men’s Club in 1914 and have since been held in churches, the Favorite Hotel, the YMCA and the Elks Lodge building. Currently the meetings are held at Edison State Community College. Rotary has sponsored numerous fund raising events including Charity Balls, Rotary’s Rollicking Revues, dinners and auctions. The club held the first Rural-Urban meeting ever organized by a Rotary Club. The Piqua club has also been active in supporting local Boy Scout activities, the movement to build the National Guard Armory in the city, the movement to establish a City Commission-City Manager form of government, a student loan program, a foreign exchange program and various city cultural and artistic programs.\n\nAs of November 2014 the Piqua Rotary Club is still an active organization in Piqua. The club currently meets on Tuesdays at noon at Edison State Community College. The weekly meetings consist of a lunch, a brief business meeting and a wide variety of presentations, programs and speeches by club members and outside speakers.\n\nCONTAINER LISTING\n\nSERIES I: BOARD OF DIRECTORS MINUTES\n\nBOX 1\n\nFile\n\n1 Board Minutes, November 1914-August 1918 (Missing July-December 1917)\n\n2 Board Minutes, January 1919-December 1924\n\n3 Board Minutes, ___ 1925-December 1928\n\n4 Board Minutes, February 1929-December 1932\n\n5 Board Minutes, January 1933-December 1936\n\n6 Board Minutes, January 1937-December 1939\n\n7 Board Minutes, January 19407-December 1942\n\n8 Board Minutes, January 1943-December 1945\n\n9 Board Minutes, January 1946-December 1950\n\nNote: January 1951-June 1958 are not part of the collection.\n\n10 Board Minutes, January 1958-December 1962\n\n11 Board Minutes, January 1963-December 1964\n\n12 Board Minutes, January 1965-December 1966\n\nSERIES II: WEEKLY REGULAR MEETING MINUTES\n\nBOX 1\n\nFile\n\n13 Meeting Minutes 1914\n\n14 Meeting Minutes 1915\n\nBOX 2\n\nFile\n\n1 Meeting Minutes 1916\n\n2 Meeting Minutes 1917\n\n3 Meeting Minutes 1918\n\n4 Meeting Minutes 1919\n\n5 Meeting Minutes 1920\n\n6 Meeting Minutes 1921\n\n7 Meeting Minutes 1922\n\n8 Meeting Minutes 1923\n\n9 Meeting Minutes 1924\n\nBOX 3\n\nFile\n\n1 Meeting Minutes 1925\n\n2 Meeting Minutes 1926\n\n3 Meeting Minutes 1927\n\n4 Meeting Minutes 1928\n\n5 Meeting Minutes 1929\n\n6 Meeting Minutes 1930\n\n7 Meeting Minutes 1931\n\n8 Meeting Minutes 1932\n\n9 Meeting Minutes1933\n\n10 Meeting Minutes 1934\n\n11 Meeting Minutes 1935\n\n12 Meeting Minutes 1936\n\n13 Meeting Minutes 1937\n\n14 Meeting Minutes 1938\n\n15 Meeting Minutes 1939\n\nBOX 4\n\nFile\n\n1 Meeting Minutes 1940\n\n2 Meeting Minutes January-July 1941\n\nNOTE: Meeting Minutes, August 1941-June 1942 are not part of the\n\ncollection.\n\n3 Meeting Minutes, July-December 1942\n\nSERIES III: NEWSLETTERS (ROTOPIQUAN)\n\nBOX 4\n\nNOTE: Newsletters from November 1921 to April 1922 can be found in\n\nSeries V, scrapbook.
