        "text": "Milton F. Pavlic (1909–1942) was a United States Navy officer killed in action during World War II for whom a U.S. Navy high-speed transport was named.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMilton Frank Pavlic was born in Trieste, Italy, on 27 December 1909 and grew up in Rittman, Ohio. During the 1927-1928 academic year he attended Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, as a pre-medical student.\n\nPavlic was appointed a midshipman on 25 June 1928. He attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and was commissioned as an ensign on 2 June 1932.\n\nAs an ensign, lieutenant, junior grade, and lieutenant, Pavlic served aboard the battleships USS New York (BB-34) and USS Mississippi (BB-41), the destroyer USS Tracy (DD-214), the destroyer tender USS Melville (AD-2), and the destroyer USS Barney (DD-149), and from 17 June 1940 to 9 March 1942 he served at the Naval Academy. He then helped fit out the new battleship USS South Dakota (BB-57), and was on board her when she was commissioned on 20 March 1942. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 15 June 1942.\n\nSouth Dakota served in the Pacific during World War II and fought in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and in the Guadalcanal campaign. In the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal early on 15 November 1942, South Dakota's task force engaged a force of Japanese warships and was badly damaged in the action. Lieutenant Commander Pavlic died in the battle.\n\nAwards[]\n\nLieutenant Commander Pavlic received the Purple Heart posthumously.\n\nNamesake[]\n\nThe U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Pavlic (DE-669) was named for Lieutenant Commander Pavlic. During construction she was converted into the high-speed transport USS Pavlic (APD-70) and was in commission from 1944 to 1946.\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]"
