        "text": "92k Namesake Milton Frank Pavlic was born in Trieste, Italy, 27 December 1909 but spent his youth in Rittman, Ohio. In 1927 started his academic career at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio as a pre-med major, however, patriotic calling drew him to the Navy after his first year since it seemed more fun to break bones then to mend them. Peter was appointed Midshipman 25 June 1928, and commissioned Ensign 2 June 1932, and Lieutenant Commander 15 June 1942. He served in New York, Mississippi, Tracy, Melville, and Barney. From 17 June 1940 to 9 March 1942, he served at the Naval Academy; then helped fit out South Dakota and was on board the battleship when she commissioned 20 March 1942. South Dakota sailed to the Pacific and fought in the Santa Cruz Islands, and at Guadalcanal. In the fierce Naval Battle off Guadalcanal early on 15 November, South DakotaÂ’s Task Force engaged a force of Japanese warships. She was badly damaged in the action. Lt. Comdr. Pavlic died in the battle and posthumously was awarded the Purple Heart Medal.\n\nPhoto form the United States Naval Academy \"Lucky Bag Yearbook - Class of 1932\""
