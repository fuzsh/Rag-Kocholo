Here's one of those snakes who has dragged more women than there are numbers on a slip-stick. Not only is he successful with the fairer sex, but he never has had much trouble with the academics, as can be understood from a look at his class standing. You can be certain he'll always put out the straight dope. Good luck, Kreeps.\n\nBaseball 4, 3, 42; Stars 4; Log 4, 3; Movie Gang 4; P. P.O.\n\nThe Class of 1942 graduated on December 19, 1941, less than two weeks after the United States entered World War II. The class had previously been scheduled to graduate in February 1942."
