        "text": "BERKELEY SCHOOLS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI am the parent of two school-age students in Berkeley public schools. I take the upcoming BUSD election very seriously. Unfortunately, most of the candidates don't. On Oct. 1, I e-mailed each of the candidates, asking them their position and opinions on the biggest elephant in the room in BUSD—unauthorized out-of-district students. Sadly, three of the four candidates have ignored my question. Only one, Beatriz Leyva-Cutler, bothered to respond. If the candidates won't answer fair questions from a parent/voter, how can we trust them to make fair and open decisions with millions of tax dollars and the precious resources that are our children? Berkeley parents and voters—demand answers from these candidates and demand attention to the serious issues facing our schools.\n\nPeter Shelton\n\n•\n\nLINDA MAIO AND ANTENNAS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe Oct. 9 article \"Court Orders Maio To Testify\" is informative and eye-opening. Linda Maio has caused enormous suffering for people on the southside in the past three years by approving cell-phone antennas on the UC Storage building owned by Patrick Kennedy. She was later rewarded a loan by Mr. Kennedy. This is really shameful. Linda Maio must resign.\n\nI remember distinctly that when the City Council was voting on the antennas, she said, \"My heart is with the people, I want to vote no, but I vote yes.\" She should have said, \"My heart is with the people, I want to vote no, but 45K is coming from Patrick Kennedy, so I vote yes.\"\n\nThis is selling out the people of Berkeley. I have been witnessing how people have been struggling since 2002 to stop cell-phone antennas. Bates, Maio, Moore, Capitelli, Wozniak, and Terry Doran have been consistently approving these antennas. You wonder whether they do so in return of loans, gifts, etc.\n\nNow I know how I am going to vote. For Mayor, my vote goes to Shirley Dean. For council seats in Districts 2, 4, 5, and 6, my votes go, respectively, to Jon Crowder, Jesse Arreguin, Sophie Hahn, and Phoebe Sorgen. Hopefully, we will bring the power back to the people and stop behind-the-door deals between the city officials and those who have cash.\n\nMina Davenport\n\n•\n\nSHIFT POWER FROM FEW TO MANY\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nIn 1933 Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act to control the financial speculation which had caused the 1929 Stock Market Crash. In 1999 Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealing the Glass-Steagall Act that has resulted in the current market crash.\n\nThe Republicans and the Democrats are now blaming each other for this crash; however, the 1999 bill was passed in the Senate: 90-8-1 and in the House: 362-57-15 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe recent bailout bill which helps Wall Street but keeps Main Street disenfranchised was passed in the Senate: 74-25 and in the House: 263-171.\n\nUntil the late 1970s Democrats still represented the workers’ interests and Republicans represented business interests, but it is evident that both parties are now vassals of the business interests. They have co-opted political debate so that the only issues that the voters can weigh in on are social issues but they have no say in the economic issues which are the basis of power. The people need to turn to politics and work to shift the power from the few to the many; otherwise, as can be seen, the politics will turn on us.\n\nAkio Tanaka\n\nOakland\n\n•\n\nTHE ADDISON\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nWhere will the hundreds of residents of the proposed The Addison project shop? There is the Grocery Outlet for the budget-minded, and Fourth Street for those few left with disposable incomes. This deal ought to be quite interesting.\n\nPhil Allen\n\n•\n\nSOUTH BERKELEY TABLEAUX\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nOn a recent sunny Berkeley weekday morning, blue, bright, clear and crisp, I could not help but think of the sad irony seeing a group of young people lounging in the Tot-Lot of our neighborhood park swathed in plumes of pot smoke as they idled by while toddlers played gleefully on the slides and stairs of the play-structures oblivious to the wafting clouds of second-hand elective pollutants. Add to this the adjacent Neighborhood Drug Watch sign so lovingly adorned with new posters, to wit: \"Neighborhood Watch, Police Not Welcome.\"\n\nNow, I am not going to bore you by drifting off into the obvious lectures, regarding this all too common occurrence in Berkeley, about how Berkeley citizens are currently being murdered and maimed over this \"harmless\" substance, or how these young people should be engaged in constructive academic or vocational pursuits, or how drug use at a young age stunts mental, emotional, and physical development, or that, while the tides come and go, that we really are not , in this period of American history, endangered by the presence of Police in our neighborhoods, etc.\n\nBut I will bore you by submitting a question to the Abeyant Leadership currently dictating policy for the citizens of Berkeley:\n\nWhat vested interest do you have in avoiding and dismissing neighborhood concerns about the serious problems that afflict our young people, keeping them at risk, marginalized, and unprepared to participate on an equal level to take advantage of the prosperity our society still (despite current economic woes) engenders, especially in a town with the intellectual, financial, and visionary resources at your disposal?\n\nJohn Herbert\n\n•\n\nHISTORICAL OBSERVATION\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nBack in 1929, when the stock market crashed, some depressed CEO s and bankers, feeling disgraced for having brought the country into financial chaos, jumped out of tall Wall Street buildings. The result: \"Plop!\" Today, CEO s and bankers jump out of Wall Street buildings securely strapped to golden parachutes. The result: \"Whoopee!\"\n\nRobert Blau\n\n•\n\nCHECKING UP ON TOM\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI met a friend for tea at Peet's Friday morning and on the way back down Solano I stopped at Colusa to pick up my weekly Planet. There were none. A little odd, as it just came out yesterday, but I would pass another at Ensenada and Solano. None again. Hmmm. Oh well, I had another chance as I was getting on BART in North Berkeley a little later. Really? None here either? It wasn't until the afternoon dog walk past Strawberry Design center that I finally found one. Ohhhh, the Planet endorsed Shirley Dean! Time to check Tom's garage?\n\nJackie Simon\n\n•\n\nLIES, DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI can't figure out if Berkeley Transportation Commissioner Rob Wrenn hasn't read the Bus Rapid Transit draft environmental impact report or if he is willingly parroting AC Transit's deceptions about the project.\n\nIn his Oct. 2 letter to the Daily Planet, Mr. Wrenn accuses me of “misrepresenting” the draft EIR. I guess Mr. Wrenn has read as far as the executive summary of the report, since that's what he quoted in his letter. Too bad he didn't read the entire report. Then he would have understood what Mark Twain is supposed to have said about statistics and lies.\n\nMr. Wrenn is right about one thing. The EIR does say that BRT would “increase corridor ridership 56 percent to 76 percent.” The key word in that sentence is corridor. In other words, ridership along the International Boulevard-Telegraph Avenue corridor would increase.\n\nHad Mr. Wrenn bothered to read the chart on page 3-26 of the EIR, however, he would have seen the entire ugly picture. As a result of BRT, AC Transit ridership is projected to increase between 3.7 and 6.2 percent. BART ridership, on the other hand, is projected to actually decrease, somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 percent as a result of riders switching to BRT. The resulting net increase in total transit usage in the East Bay would be between 0.7 percent and 1.4 percent.\n\nHow did Mr. Wrenn and AC Transit get to that “56 to 76 percent” increase? By counting people who switch to BRT from other bus lines or from BART. These are not new transit riders. By switching from one bus line to another they do nothing to reduce greenhouse gases. People who switch from BART to BRT will, in fact, generate more greenhouse gases, not less.\n\nHere is the fabled bottom line, direct from the EIR: Without BRT, transit use in the East Bay is projected to be 659,800 trips per day by 2025. With BRT, the number of trips is projected, at a maximum, to be 670,100. That's a 1.4 percent increase. This number is so small that the draft EIR says that the energy savings from BRT would be “negligible.” This number is so small that the projected decreases in air pollutants are nearly zero (0.03 percent to be precise).\n\nSo who's “misrepresenting” the draft EIR, Mr. Wrenn? And tell us again, Mr. Wrenn, if you would, why we should spend $250 million on a project which is expected to do, essentially, nothing?\n\nJim Bullock\n\n•\n\nGET WITH THE PROGRAMS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThere is a disconnect between the on-air program messages at KPFA and the actions of the management toward staff and volunteers. This inconsistency was revealed to the public when management and personnel at the radio station called the police on Nadra Foster during a dispute. This decision resulted in the police brutalizing Nadra, who is a long-time, black woman programmer.\n\nKPFA radio, 94.1 FM, has many programs denouncing racism and the prison, military industrial complex. Among these programs are Hard Knock Radio, Flashpoints, JR and the Block Report, Without Walls, Critical Resistance, and Mumia Abu Jamal's Commentaries from Death Row. Reporters address the abuses of the police and of the dominant culture. The economically powerful and privileged use the police as a tool to control political dissent and to oppress people of color.\n\nPolice are not a solution to resolving our conflicts or solving any problems at the radio station. We should utilize alternatives such as sensitivity training, NVC-Non Violent Communication, and Conflict Resolution. These approaches, which have also been presented on-the-air, could be facilitated at teach-ins and community meetings. Additionally, management and staff should be familiar with de-escalation techniques and should have trained community support available if disputes and difficulties arise.\n\nManagement, with paid and unpaid staff, need to support the intention of KPFA in the studio, as well as on the air, by utilizing alternative approaches to calling the police. We need to do as we say at KPFA. Management, there is a better way—get with the programs.\n\nBeverly Dove\n\n•\n\nPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI really want to know from presidential nominees how a low-income individual can survive, unlike rich people who have plenty to throw away and waste. I heard the Republican candidate say that a $5,000 government credit will enable people to buy health care of their choice in the open market. I am a dedicated teacher with limited means. Is $5,000 the total amount I will have to pay? The government credit must make sense not just for rich and upper-middle class people, but for poor people as well.\n\nRomila Khanna\n\nAlbany\n\n•\n\nMEASURE KK\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI just realized that many politically powerful people and organizations are opposing Measure KK!\n\nWhy am I surprised and upset? Answer: I live near Telegraph Avenue. The prospect of losing two out of the four lanes of traffic to busses only was unpleasant. Probably the most important problem to me is losing most of the parking on Telegraph. Parking is already tight near here because of Cal students. Neighbors like me and merchants on Telegraph have worked hard to put KK on the ballot—the merchants for customer parking, the neighbors for local parking near our homes.\n\nIf you do think of voting no on KK, please think that if it wins, it will decrease customers for the merchants on Telegraph, and, worst for the local residents, it may keep us from having visitors! (In most cases, it will not affect your life at all.)\n\nJulia Craig\n\n•\n\nSCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThank you for devoting space in your Oct 9 issue to school board candidate statements. Local school boards make important decisions that affect every family in their community, yet it's often hard to determine which candidates offer the best solutions. I confess to not voting for local candidates in the past who are running for positions such as school or park district boards because I just didn't know enough to make an informed choice.\n\nHaving read the statements of the three school board candidates who chose to present their case to Berkeley residents, I was very impressed with Priscilla Myrick's knowledge of the issues and her prescriptions for improvement.\n\nI don't understand why the schools in my hometown of New Delhi are so much more rigorous than those in Berkeley. New Delhi schools have less funding, more students and extreme poverty. But the academics are highly valued and produce better results than many U.S. schools, including my adopted town here in Berkeley.\n\nThe United States needs well-educated students now more than ever.\n\nKavita Mohindroo\n\n•\n\nOAKLAND'S MEASURE N\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nOakland Measure N provides inequality for charter school teachers\n\nAt the last Oakland School Board meeting, State Administrator Vincent Matthews explained that it was his concern for \"equity\" that lead him to make $1.8 million charter school tax a part of Measure N.\n\nState Administrator Matthew could have placed the question of funding Oakland’s corporate charter schools on the ballot as a separate measure and provided “equity” for charter school taxpayers. The Oakland voters could then have decided if they wanted to fund “successful charter school programs.”\n\nInstead of going to the public with a straight forward request to fund Oakland corporate charter schools, he buried the charter schools’ request for local funding in a parcel tax designed to fund Oakland Public teachers’ pay increase.\n\nUnder Measure N, all the parcel tax money for Oakland Public Schools must go to pay for Oakland teachers’ salary increase. Yet, each charter school administration qualifying for the money gets to decide how to spend the money at its school.\n\nMeasure N leaves charter school teachers behind. If State Administrator Matthews truly wanted equity, why didn’t he at lease write Measure N to provide equity for Oakland’s charter school teachers and ensure they too get a raise?\n\nInequity for charter school teachers is only one of many reasons to vote no on Measure N Nov. 4.\n\nJim Mordecai\n\nOakland\n\n•\n\nNATIONAL COMING OUT DAY\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nLast Saturday, Oct. 11, was National Coming Out Day! This happens once a year, every year, but this year it is of extreme importance with the upcoming election, and Proposition 8!\n\nIn an unprecedented display of solidarity and diversity, in April of 1993, an estimated one million people came together for the National March on Washington for GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender) rights!\n\nOne of the highlights of that day came when Martina Navratilova gave an emotional speech on the importance of coming out and on the need to be open and honest about one's sexual identity.\n\nThe parts of her speech that moved me the most, and that I believe are the most pertinent to the issue of the marriage amendment known as Proposition 8 coming up for a popular vote this Nov. 4, I quote below:\n\n\"What our movement for equality needs most, is for us to come out of the closet! We need to become visible to as many people as possible, so that we can shatter all those incredible myths that keep us in the closet!\n\nOur goal is not to receive compassion, acceptance, or worse yet, tolerance, because that implies that we are inferior, we are to be tolerated, pitied, and endured! I don't want pity, do you? Of course not! Our goal must be equality across the board. We can settle for nothing less, because we deserve nothing less!\n\nOne's sexuality should not be an issue, one way or another. One's sexuality should not become a label by which that human being should be identified! My sexuality is a very important part of my life, a very important part of my being, but it is still a very small part of who I am!\n\nBeing homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual is not good or bad. It simply is.\n\nSo now we are here today so that one day in the hopefully not-too-distant future, we will be referred to not by our sexuality, but by our accomplishments and abilities, as all Californians, Americans and people everywhere have the right to be!\n\nMelissa Etheridge, k.d. lang, Elton John, Greg Louganis and many, many others have come out of the closet, including recently, Clay Aiken! Each and every one had something to lose by that action, and each and every one could have made all kinds of excuses not to come out, but they didn't!\n\nSo, now, I urge all of you who are still in the closet to throw away all the excuses!\n\nIf we want the world to accept us, we must first accept ourselves! If we want the world to give us respect, we must first be willing to give ourselves respect! We must be proud of who we are and we cannot do that if we hide!\n\nBy coming out to our friends, family, employers, and employees, we make ourselves personable. We become human beings, and then we have the opportunity to show the world what we are all about—happy, intelligent, giving, loving people. We can show our moral strength, dignity, character.\"\n\nWe can be ourselves! I urge you to come out now and be true to yourself and tell your family, friends and everyone you know to vote no on Proposition 8, and that to do otherwise they will be hurting someone they know and love—you!\n\nRobert Sodervick\n\nJustice and Equality for All\n\nSan Francisco\n\n•\n\nHEALING AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe KPFA management talks “healing” from their recent police incident. But more is required here, there’s also gaining progressive understanding of the social forces involved.\n\nThere’s a historic struggle to change the present objectification approach to madness/’mental illness’ to a humanistic model based on community values and responsible self-expression, a struggle that falls within the framework of Kuhn’s “paradigm shift” in science. Ignoring that is—politically—like ignoring gender role, ethnicity, or the exploitation of labor.\n\nSome 15 years ago, Berkeley Mental Health came together around a “denial” strategy regarding “paradigm shift,” and moved systematically to break every ongoing initiative in sync with the historic change process. Wendy Georges was fired from the Berkeley Food Project, sell-out deals were offered the prominent client/survivor activists (I refused mine and was personally threatened by BMH).\n\nA general climate of stigma/discrimination promotes what activists call the “freedom train” problem. Are the ‘crazy people’ invited; is there a role for our values in the progressive movement? Or do people practice what Martin Luther King, Jr. called the “behavioral science” that accommodates or embraces oppression, denying torture, when dealing with us?\n\nKPFA has had programs related to this concern. Once a leader of the client/survivor movement helped run Youth Radio, for instance. Yet—like most progressives, KPFA management and programming still does not take the stigma/discrimination process into account. Recently for instance Phil Zimbardo, a progressive social psychologist who is still confused about the “freedom train,” was shamelessly praised on the Morning Show when interviewed about his new book (on the behavioral science of attitude management). I shuddered when I heard that.\n\nThe August 20 incident showed the face of racism, many say. It also showed the face of denial, what—by civil rights metaphor—is the “watermelon” approach to the movement to bring the client/survivor activists into the freedom train. Where is principle hiding?\n\nIn September, the American Psychological Association voted 60 percent by referendum ever to ban psychologists from involvement in torture in the service of national security. The questions implicit in King’s advocacy for reforming “behavioral science” so as to promote “creative maladjustment” based on the values of freedom and dignity are now, at last, on the table: When does \"treatment\" mean \"torture\"?\n\nAndrew Phelps\n\nFormer Chair, Berkeley Mental Health Commission (1990-93)\n\nP.S.: King's 1967 speech to the APA can be found at www.apa.org/monitor/jan99/king.html.\n\n•\n\nBURIAL GROUNDS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nLast Tuesday's publication of the Daily Californian mentions that archeological tests are been done near the proposed athletes' complex near Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe mentioned place is a sacred burial ground for the Muwekma Ohlone who inhabit the Bay Area from San Jose to beyond Berkeley and the San Francisco Peninsula. For instance, the Moscone Center and the Presidio National Park in San Francisco, the Bay Bridge ends, Emeryville Shopping Mall, Fourth Street in Berkeley, the University of California campus at Berkeley, and many other places in the Bay Area contain sacred burial grounds. The oak grove and Memorial Stadium, where a waterfall existed, are also burial grounds.\n\nOn Thursday, June 19, the Daily Californian reported, \"Ohlone tribe member Andrew Galvan agreed with the university's claim that native burials at the site are unlikely, saying that he is \"unaware of any proof saying current burials exists in that area.\" But allow me to let you know that Andrew Galvan is a not an Ohlone representative, he is three quarters non-native mexican, half quart sicilian and less than half quart Ohlone, therefore he is not even Ohlone, and obviously, neither by spirit.\n\nAndrew Galvan is a divisive figure among the Ohlone community who since his early age has been a traitor to his almost non-Ohlone controversial identity. During the Alcatraz Occupation of the 1970s he wrote a letter and sent to president Nixon opposing the Native American Alcatraz occupation. As a teenager he was a franciscan seminarian and his brother Michael is a priest. Andrew Galvan has promoted the saint hood of father Junipero Serra who was the cause of the great devastation of California's Native Nations including the Ohlones. I remember when Andrew Galvan opposed the Ohlone Nation for the repatriation of the 13,000 human remains by UC Berkeley, such incident happened at the International House Auditorium 20 years ago.\n\nAndrew Galvan has a B.A. in history from the California State University at Hayward and co-owns an archeological firm that has repatriated over 5000 human skeletal Ohlone remain and charges $60 an hour during excavations where construction will disturb Ohlone sacred burial grounds. For instance, he charged the county of Contra Costa $58.000 for 12 skeletal remains during a project of Big Break Regional Shoreline in the year 2002. He reburies the remains at the Ohlone Indian Tribe, Inc. cemetery in Fremont where he has denied the access to Ohlone tribe members who are looking for federal recognition.\n\nThe list goes on and on with this alleged \"Ohlone,\" (see the San Francisco Weekly, Nov. 21, 2007 article for more information about Andrew Galvan misrepresentation).\n\nWell, the University of California at Berkeley is alleging that the current archeological tests at the oak grove are being supervised by a \"representative of the local Ohlone tribe is on site every day to oversee the excavation.\" But they don't give the name of such \"Ohlone.\" Who is he/she? Most likely the traitor and renegade Andrew Galvan, curator of Mission Dolores.\n\nI must add that Chancellor Birgenau of the University of California at Berkeley is another traitor to the Native American community for not protecting the oak grove and the sacred burial Ohlone ground and for not returning the 13,000 human Ohlone remains for proper reburial. Ironically, chancellor Birgenau alleges to be a Canadian First Nation Native.\n\nBernardo S. Lopez\n\n•\n\nVP PALIN\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nImagine if you will: President John McCain all of a sudden keels over, and Vice President Sarah Palin has become the leader of the free world. That is inexperienced and figurehead Sarah Palin is now the commander in chief of the United States. Palin was selected in the 2008 presidential election to attract millions of evangelical voters to the GOP ticket.\n\nPresident Palin has transformed the Supreme Court into a fundamentalist sounding board with the addition of more anti-abortion and anti-gay justices. Roe vs Wade is a memory and women no longer have freedom of choice over their own bodies.\n\nAmerica is experiencing a population explosion as the Palin administration pushes its \"abstinence only\" policy on the country. Sex education in the schools has been banned under the threat of lost funding.\n\nUnder President Palin, \"Onward Christian Soldiers\" has become the battle cry of the foreign policy and he economy is still stumbling along under Bush-like ecomomic policies. Far fetched?\n\nRon Lowe\n\nNevada City\n\nTHE HERETIC HAS GOT TO GO!\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nOn behalf of our entire community, I wish to express shock, outrage and profound disgust that the word “G-d” (I can’t bring myself to spell out that odious term) may have been uttered in one of our public school classrooms. How can we tolerate in our midst a public school teacher who not so secretly cleaves to the heresy of creationism?\n\nIt’s not enough that this teacher has been allowed personal leave since this blasphemy against Science and Reason. The damage already done to these impressionable young minds by the denial of Evolution and the Big Bang (it’s not a “theory”) may be irreparable!\n\nWhat’s the school district’s answer to this thought crime? To “seek some form of discipline against her.” We demand a more public form of excommunication! We may have a true “witch” on our hands here and only a public “witch trial” will suffice to reestablish the purity of our community’s dogma. Yes, we demand a new “Scopes Trial,” “A G-d Trial” of the “Infidel Martin”!\n\nEdna Spector\n\n•\n\nCORRECTION\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nRegarding Richard Brenneman’s Oct. 2 story “Commission Spurns DAPAC Parking, Traffic Proposals,” I want to clarify that I did not have the opportunity to serve on the DAPAC committee, as Mr. Brenneman states. My appointment to the Planning Commission began after DAPAC had completed its work.\n\nRoia Ferrazares\n\nPlanning Commission\n\nDistrict 2\n\n•\n\nWATER CONSERVATION\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nIt is hard to swallow EBMUD’s complaints that its customers are not conserving enough water. I have been taking short showers, flushing the toilet with water I catch in the shower, haranguing my teenagers, etc. Yet in the past few weeks I have ridden my bike past block after block of enormous lush green lawns in Lafayette and Orinda. On top of that, I always see several yards being watered in the heat of the day on every ride. I really don’t think the few gallons I am saving makes much of a difference in the whole scheme of things. When EBMUD gets serious, maybe its customers will too.\n\nEric Weaver\n\n•\n\nRIGHT GAL FOR THE WRONG JOB\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nWhen I saw Sarah Palin look into the TV camera, flash her cosmetic eyelashes, and say so sincerely, “Change is coming, and John McCain is the leader of that reform,” I could almost believe her. Except I wasn’t born yesterday. I’ve seen McCain fight to remove government regulation and oversight for 26 years, which has dumped us in the financial firestorm that is now melting our economy.\n\nSen. Biden reminded debate viewers that the so-called “maverick” voted for George Bush’s budgets, which piled up over $3 trillion in debt. McCain voted for Bush’s exclusion of 3.6 million children from the S-CHIP health care plan. He supported Bush’s war in Iraq from the beginning, and voted billions of tax breaks for the most wealthy corporations and CEOs.\n\nBut even if Palin really does believe that McCain would bring change, he couldn’t do it single-handedly. He’d have to use many of the same Republican operatives and lobbyists that are so deeply entrenched in Bush’s administration. These are the birds he’s flown with all his career, from Alaska to Arizona, to K Street in DC.\n\nAs for Palin’s debate performance: She was chipper; she was smiley. She dodged the questions she couldn’t answer, and she stayed on message. And, gosh darn it, she sounded sincere. Sarah Palin would be a perfect presidential press secretary. Too bad she got bumped up to a responsibility she’s not ready for.\n\nBruce Joffe\n\nPiedmont\n\n•\n\nBIRGENEAU\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nRecently, my daughter, a UC Berkeley student, tried to sign up for a P.E. class. Not only were all the classes full, all the waiting lists were also full. Meanwhile, while the regular students are neglected, Birgeneau is spending an incredible amount of time, energy and money on the High Performance Center for elite athletes whose main purpose is entertainment. I entirely agree with the Boyce’s letter to Chancellor Birgeneau in which they voiced their concern about how the mission of the university is being diverted from education to spectator sports. Now more than ever, given the growing consumption of fast food and weight problems, students need to be participating in physical activities, not watching from the sidelines. I’m sure Birgeneau would insist that spectator sports are necessary to increase donations, but I am sure many people prefer to donate elsewhere due to the university’s emphasis on football instead of education.\n\nSally Levinson\n\n•\n\nNEW MANTRA\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe old tried and true mantra, “Capitalism cannot be successfully regulated,” has now been replaced by an even more terrifying truism: “Globilization will never be sucessfully regulated.” Looks like we are in a pickle without a paddle. Looks like old Karl was right on.\n\nRobert Blau\n\n•\n\nDONA’S LEGACY\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI’d like to reply to Frank Greenspan’s Oct. 2 letter. Dona Spring’s death left a huge hole in our hearts and leaves us without a progressive candidate in District 4. We all have mentors, a caring parent, or a teacher that is no longer with us. In making an important decision, I often ask myself “what would my mother do,” or as an artist, I might ponder what my mentor had taught me. This does not mean I don’t think for myself; I am simply remembering the important things I have learned from those who are no longer with me.\n\nI support Jesse Arreguin for District 4, for many reasons, and one of them is because he has shown he does think for himself and yet will still carry on the work that Dona started. He has many supporters both in his district and from other progressive leaders.\n\nI am a warm pool advocate (my mother taught me compassion), and I believe among other issues, he is a strong proponent for the disabled community.\n\nMy biggest fear is that the progressive candidates will split the vote and Terry Doran will dance in and be sitting in Dona’s chair. We cannot let this happen. It is a time for Berkeley to come together and make sure that we continue our reputation as a city who cares about our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nLori Kossowsky\n\n•\n\nMEASURE VV\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThank you for the balanced review of Measure VV in your Sept. 15 “Analysis of Regional Ballot Measures.” Here’s additional information to help inform voters in November.\n\nAC Transit provides a critical service to 227,000 daily riders in Alameda and Contra Costa counties; 60,000 riders are youth who depend on AC to go to school and after-school programs (school buses are extremely limited in the East Bay).\n\nLast winter AC Transit proposed to raise youth passes from $15 to $28 a month, senior passes from $20 to $28 a month. These extreme increases would have burdened some of the area’s neediest populations. Higher fares mean that many families cannot afford to send their children to school everyday; or senior citizens have access to necessary goods and services. Measure VV keeps fares low for both youth and seniors.\n\nAlthough nearly one-third of AC Transit’s riders owns a vehicle, they choose the bus as an affordable alternative. Not only can Measure VV keep fares affordable but also attract more riders and continue to help reduce traffic and air pollution.\n\nSince Measure VV guarantees funds be used for operating costs only, the current fleet can be maintained without cutting service. We need reliable and affordable public transit for all people if we are to meet current and future environmental challenges. Measure VV spreads a small burden across a large population and helps everyone.\n\nSummer Brenner\n\nYouth Transportation Coalition\n\n•\n\nDORAN HAS HOMEWORK TO DO\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nWhile reading the Oct. 2 Daily Cal article “Downtown Redevelopment Plays Major Role in Election,” I was flabbergasted to see District 4 candidate Terry Doran quoted as saying he thought a denser downtown would help decrease greenhouse gas emissions. “The greatest contributor to greenhouse gases is driving cars,” said Doran, “that’s another reason why I support these larger structures downtown.”\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, all transportation—including cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes—accounts for just 27 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. On the other hand, construction and operation of buildings produces 48 percent of such emissions.\n\nDoran’s plan to tear down existing downtown buildings and construct new, far larger ones, would not only not help decrease greenhouse gas emissions—it would contribute to them in a major way.\n\nIn the words of Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation: “Any new building represents a new impact on the environment. The bottom line is that the greenest building is one that already exists. We cannot build our way out of this global warming crisis. We have to conserve our way out. This means we have to make better, wiser use of what we’ve already built.”\n\nThat’s a good reason to vote no on Measure LL in November.\n\nTerry Doran, you have some homework to do.\n\nDaniella Thompson\n\n•\n\nMEASURE KK\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nIn defending Measure KK, Bruce Kaplan goes to some ridiculous lengths to convince readers that the measure is “pro-transit.” Among other things, he rehashes many of the now-familiar arguments about the evils of the proposed East Bay Bus Rapid Transit project—why it won’t really improve public transit, why it isn’t really green, and so on. There’s no need to go over that familiar territory again.\n\nBut Kaplan does introduce a couple of novel ideas that deserve attention.\n\nHe says, “I know that most of the city’s political elite have come out against the measure.”\n\nThink about that. The entire City Council—Mayor Tom Bates and all seven current councilmembers—is opposed to Measure KK. Is that the city’s political elite? Where is Sarah Palin when we need her? You just can’t trust those elites any more, can you? Never mind that we elected all of them, and that the essence of democracy in our country is something called representative government. Down with the “elites”! Yes, indeed.\n\nAnd then there’s Kaplan’s reference to all the neighborhood opposition to the BRT project and support for Measure KK. They include “CENA, Willard, Le Conte and Northeast Berkeley, the Council of Neighborhood Associations (CNA). These organizations represent the folks that actually live here in Berkeley. They understand how detrimental the presently proposed plan would be if allowed to go forward.”\n\nLet me tell you something about those organizations. I’ve talked with many friends who live in the neighborhoods the organizations supposedly represent, and what they’ve said to me is they find the organizations so conservative and negative that they don’t want to have anything to do with them. “You should go to their meetings and express your views,” I’ve argued. “They represent you!”\n\nBut I can understand their reluctance.\n\nHere’s what a friend who lives in one of the above-mentioned neighborhoods wrote to me in an e-mail: “Nobody beside a small inner circle e-mail list was notified that the neighborhood association was even discussing BRT. In the past, we used to have a newsletter and notices of meetings which were dropped at over 1,000 doors. People throughout the neighborhood were told what was going to be discussed at the next neighborhood meeting and had a chance to come and speak. Now, only a few insiders know about meetings if there are any. The last time there was a widely distributed neighborhood meeting notice was a few years ago when I distributed it and posted it myself.”\n\nHank Resnik\n\n•\n\nSAY NO TO EXTREMISTS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe Daily Planet again brings forth the radical anti-Israel ideologues to justify vandalism, graffiti, and swastikas as some kind of legitimate and civil protest in the city of Berkeley. In the Looking Glass world of the Israel haters: gay and women’s rights are of no concern, free press and free speech are dismissed, multiparty democracy is equated with the political system in China, and peaceful efforts for coexistence are cynically belittled. Meanwhile those who censor free speech using Nazi symbols to literally cover up the truth are elevated. Their victims are then called Nazis!\n\nAmericans understand this kind of swiftboating, big lie propaganda technique. If people think that Israel is like China, then I might urge them to visit both countries and peacefully hand out leaflets protesting government policies, except I would hate to see someone end up in a Chinese jail. Israel, on the other hand, is a democratic country with freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Unlike the United States, in Israel, citizens—both Jewish and non-Jewish—deal daily with serious terrorist threats without the fearmongering and attack on civil rights that is going on here.\n\nIsrael and Palestine have serious problems. The solutions will come through efforts toward moderation, coexistence, and civil rights, not through bombs, violence and repression. Americans can best help Israel and Palestine by supporting peaceful coexistence and saying no to extremists on both sides.\n\nRabbi Jane Rachel Litman\n\n•\n\nBLUESTAR\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nWe at BlueStarPR (a non-profit located in San Francisco) are astounded that you would publish readers’ letters justifying graffiti equating a swastika with a Jewish star accompanied by anti-Israel ravings. By any reasonable definition, these letter are gross examples of hate speech. This is not my opinion but rather an undeniable fact according the official definition of anti-Semitism by the European Union. The European Union is hardly a part of the Republican Party and has often found itself in very contentious disagreement with the State of Israel. I urge you to consider the conclusions of its 2005 Brussels meeting of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) on anti-Israel expression and anti-Semitism.\n\nFirstly, the European Union declared that denying Israel’s right to exist is anti-Semitism.\n\nThey have also determined the following acts or statements to be anti-Semitism:\n\n• Denying the Jewish people’s right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor.\n\n• Applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.\n\n• Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.\n\n• Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.\n\n• Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.\n\nHowever, they concluded that criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic.\n\nI call each individual resident of Berkeley to personally adopt this European resolution in its entirety. Berkeley should strive to live up to its own standards and avoid sinking into that morass of hatred where the authors of those offensive letters seem to permanently dwell.\n\nPin Altman\n\nBlueStarPR\n\n•\n\nKNOB AND TUBE WIRING\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nWith interest—and with some bemusement—I read Matt Cantor’s column about knob and tube wiring in last week’s issue of the Berkeley Daily Planet. I found the piece generally informative, but I question the accuracy of a couple of Cantor’s assertions. In particular, I do not believe that, “If you have a house built before 1950, there is a good chance that it contains some knob and tube wiring.” The fact is that the use of knob and tube wiring was almost non-existent after the 1930s (at the latest) in almost all parts of the country. By the 1920s, fabric or cloth covered bundled wiring had been invented and gradually superceded the more antiquated system.\n\nI know of absolutely no instances where knob and tube wiring was used in post-war housing, at least in the Midwest and in the east. My observations come from long years as a general contractor dating from the early 1950s on. I have worked on wide variety of wood-framed, steel-framed, and concrete buildings ranging from three hundred year old New England saltboxes to many urban residential and commercial structures in Boston, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.\n\nWhile I concur that knob and tube wiring was a reasonable system when it came into usage in the late 19th century, I take issue with Cantor’s claim that it currently constitutes a safe alternative to armored cable or Romex. While I believe that it is possible to permit existing knob and tube runs to remain active in certain out of the way locations such as in basements, I cannot believe that a single licensed electrician in this country would install it, even where the codes would allow its use. And even if the required components were available, training employee in its proper assembly would be out of the question, I would think.\n\nFrom a 21st century perspective, I view knob and tube wiring as a fascinating anachronism—and an integral part of American construction history.\n\nMiltiades Mandros\n\n•\n\nANTI-SEMITISM IN\n\nBERKELEY\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI am a university student and I am greatly concerned about the recent racist defacing of a poster.\n\nAs a student of an American university, I consider myself very lucky. The university in America plays a unique role and ideally should be serving as the epicenter for free speech and expression. A place where top minds and aspiring youth hungry for knowledge can cut their teeth and explore the realms of academia in a safe and diverse environment. Not just a racially diverse or culturally diverse environment (although those are both important, too) but also ideologically diverse. A place where people can discuss different opinions in a respectful and open manner and feel free in doing so is a beautiful place indeed.\n\nOn the other hand, when there are those cowards who would seek to intimidate or eliminate other view points just because they are different, and that is a dangerous and terrible thing. When there are those who would seek to use the most vile and genocidal image of the modern era in order to stifle the free speech of others, that is beyond sickening.\n\nI hope that the true idea of freedom, freedom of thoughts, words and beliefs, can be made whole in Berkeley and elsewhere. I hope that that this type of thuggery is not accepted by the community at large, and as other hate movements are, only exists as a fringe group that represents no one but the sick twisted individuals who would stoop to this type of thing.\n\nJonathan Brostoff\n\n•\n\nHATEFUL LETTER\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI was very disappointed that you published the obviously hateful letter regarding Israel and the defacing of the positive message in the Blue Star posters. You make decisions every day on what to publish and not publish. Surely this crossed the line. Please reconsider in the future.\n\nPeter Logan\n\nSan Francisco\n\n•\n\nHISTORICAL VACCUUM\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nMarc Sapir’s commentary on graffiti and Israel is written in a historical vacuum. His comments are borne of humanistic concerns but fail to take into account the historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Conditions are what they are today primarily for one reason and one reason alone: anti-Semitism.\n\nBefore the birth of Israel, Jews suffered thousands of years of persecution, and prior to the establishment of the state of Israel, the Arabs had joined the Nazis as allies in their attempt to destroy the Jewish people. With the end of World War II, the nations of the world almost unanimously supported a division between adversaries, Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews. This division resulted in the formation of two separate nations, and was necessary to ensure the safety of the Jewish people. Borders were drawn by UN consensus and they were not perfect. Jews remained on Arab land, Arabs remained on Jewish land; Arabs received more land, Jews received major port access, and so on. Jerusalem was split between the two peoples.\n\nTrue to form, however, the area’s Arab countries could not tolerate a Jewish country in their midst, and thus ensued yet another attempt to eradicate the Jewish people. During the violence that followed Palestinians on Israeli lands fled to Palestinian lands, and Jews on Palestinian lands fled to Israeli lands. After turning away the Arab aggressors, the fledgling Jewish state was faced with the continual threat of annihilation by Arab countries surrounding it as evidenced by three additional Arab-initiated wars. With two subsequent intifadas Israel has necessarily developed a survival mentality that persists to this day. Hence, the current situation.\n\nDespite Sapir’s hard-edged finger pointing, Israel has been forced to react to its circumstances. There has not been one Israeli leader since 1948 who hasn’t said that when the Arab leaders decide that they will accept Israel’s right to exist, and genuinely and permanently want peace and co-existence, Israel would rejoice and negotiate fairly and equitably on all matters. At that very moment conditions for Palestinian Arabs would improve.\n\nSo, it really is a question of what comes first, the chicken or the egg. Those who harshly criticize Israel fail to appreciate Israel’s raison d’etre, its reason for existence. Instead, they attribute what they perceive as nefarious designs to some baseless notion of Israel realpolitik.\n\nCan Israel really do anything differently under these circumstances? Nothing substantive. In a dispute, it is not enough for one party to want peace. Both parties must want peace. Take with a grain of salt Sapir’s use of words such as Zionism, colonialism, segregationist, and racism. They are buzz words that only reflect continuing anti-Semitism when applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nBarry Gustin\n\n•\n\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nIt is a sad statement on the editorial policy of your paper when an objective article about the defacing of an advertising poster is followed by a virulently anti-Israel reader commentary. When one of your reporters acknowledges the presence of anti-Semitic graffiti on a poster promoting peaceful co-existence in Israel—the swastika is a symbol for the annihilation of the Jewish people—somehow this is soundly discounted in a subsequent op-ed piece. Leaders from the university and City of Berkeley have decried this hateful act of graffiti as intolerable in a city that is committed to diversity and pluralism. Clearly, most would recognize that by equating a swastika with a Jewish star, a line is being crossed between criticizing Israel and demonizing the Jewish people. Regardless of politics, it was a missed opportunity by your paper to show support and humanity for those in the Jewish community who felt violated by this act. An editorial denouncing this hateful act, as we hope you would have written for other communities similarly attacked, would have been the appropriate response.\n\nMyrna David\n\nEast Bay Regional Director\n\nJewish Community Relations Council\n\nOakland\n\n•\n\nBETTER STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER MONEY\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThose of us who feel now is not the time for additional new taxes in Berkeley are not opposed to funding the libraries, the fire fighters and other essential services. Our opposition to Measures FF, GG and HH is based on the premise that these essential services should be funded first out of the general fund, rather than by special taxes.\n\nIn the “good times” of 2004, Berkeley voters were clear that they opposed new taxes. One message our elected representatives didn’t seem to get from those votes was that they should look to other funding sources to leverage city money in funding these essential services.\n\nMany of our neighboring communities have been much more active in going after grants from both public and private sources for funding essential services. For the libraries, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will pay for new computers and librarian training. For police and firefighters, new radios that allow interagency communication can be purchased with Department of Homeland Security matching funds.\n\nThe other thing our elected representatives should have taken from the 2004 vote is that better management of the funding they do have is needed.\n\nThat might mean less generous raises for city employees. That might mean looking at alternative means of delivering services such as employing an outside contractor to provide paramedic services, rather than rolling expensive firefighters for every call. That might mean controlling overtime by city staff, especially in the fire and police departments. At some point it becomes cheaper to hire additional staff than to pay one person the salary of two people.\n\nIn the past we have approved many special taxes. We thought we could get improved streets, parks, EMT and other services. Instead, what our elected representatives did, was for every penny we added as additional taxes, they took away City funding. This is why, although we are paying for more taxes, we don’t receive better services.\n\nOur elected representatives have ignored the critical need to identify and adequately fund essential services, before making hard decisions about the many nice-to-have services. A no vote on Measures FF, GG and HH will make it clear that essential services must be our city’s top priority and must be funded first.\n\nVincent Casalaina\n\n•\n\nTROY DAVIS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nPlease consider the importance of the case in which Troy Davis will be sentenced to death without overwhelming proof of his guilt and a lot of evidence as to his innocence. We must not continue to allow disparities in racial and economic equality be the cause of wrongful death. We must do everything we can to preserve our dignity as a nation and avoid this brutality on the part of a flawed judicial system. Nobody would want this to happen to someone they knew and yet the possibility only increases the more we become desensitized to these travesties of justice. Regardless of one’s position on the death penalty we should all reasonably agree that we need to be safe as citizens from wrongful execution. We cannot ignore this any longer for humanity’s sake.\n\nGeorgia’s judicial system has so far failed to consider the compelling new evidence of Mr. Davis’ innocence and either exonerate him or at least grant him a new trial and let a jury decide if he is guilty or innocent.\n\nThe case of Troy Davis highlights some of the many problems that death penalty supporters have no answers for: the risk of innocent people being executed, inadequate counsel, and racial and economic status disparities.\n\nThe Troy Davis case also is an example of a less obvious problem with our criminal justice system—that the ever-increasing number of procedural hurdles erected by courts and legislators to deny death-row inmates relief and expedite their executions has seriously eroded the system’s ability to correct its mistakes.\n\nHad Troy Davis had adequate resources to defend himself, this miscarriage of justice might not have occurred. Like virtually everyone else on death row in this country, Troy Davis is indigent. There are no millionaires on death row.\n\nMeagan Mosher-Stockinger\n\n•\n\nFIXING THE PROBLEM\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nMost authors assert, and I agree, that, “It’s the collapse of the housing bubble that is the root of the economy’s problem.” How then to fix the problem becomes the issue.\n\nI believe that the vast majority of homeowners want to retain their ownership and stay in the house they acquired regardless of their mortgage terms. Problem is that many of them can no longer make their monthly mortgage payment. If I’m right in this then the answer should be sought in reducing such monthly mandated mortgage payments and doing so without dumping on the banks or us taxpayers.\n\nHow to do so? I suggest that all existing home mortgages—and that means all—be redrawn to read 6 percent fixed interest rate for a period of 60 years, the only exception being those mortgages at a fixed current rate that may be below 6 percent which would retain the lower interest rate.\n\nDoing so would significantly reduce the monthly cost to the borrower and would allow the lending agency to retain mortgages at full value as originally contracted. It would pull homes from the market that are only there because the owners are financially distressed, thus strengthening the housing market and raising home prices. Thus, it would serve to encourage banks and other financial institutions to again make loans. Of course, those who wish to pay off a mortgage in less than 60 years would, at no penalty cost to themselves, be able to do so. Further, this extension in the life of the mortgage to 60 years should be accomplished at no cost to the borrower—if there is a cost it ought to be met by the current holder of said mortgage or by an agency of the federal government.\n\nIrving Gershenberg\n\n•\n\nLAMENT FOR MY STOLEN TOYOTA\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nAccording to the Oakland Police Department, there were 9,923 car thefts in that city in 2007. This statistical fact might be of little general interest, unless your car happened to be one of those thefts. In my own case, Aug. 27, 2008 is a day of infamy—the day my 1999 Toyota Corolla vanished from the face of the earth. Or rather, disappeared on 10th and Fallon Street, directly across from the Oakland Museum. I had parked on Fallon Street at 9 a.m. that morning, as a friend and I were taking a museum trip to Bodega Bay. What a glorious trip it was—but marred on our return at 6 p.m. by the jarring discovery that my car had totally vanished, nowhere to be seen!\n\nAs fortune would have it, a young Alameda County deputy sheriff drove by, noticed two distraught females and offered his assistance. Driving in his patrol car, we cruised up and down Fallon Street, looking for my beloved Corolla. But it was a hopeless search. Not even an urgent prayer to St. Anthony (patron of lost things) came up with the missing vehicle. Whereupon the deputy sheriff made out a lengthy report, then gallantly drove my friend and me back to our home in Berkeley. Never say chivalry is dead!\n\nWhat followed this disaster was a month of sheer hell. To begin with, when I notified my apartment manager about the theft, she gave me the distressing news that since the thief had access to my garage gate remote device and knew my address, this posed a serious threat to the security of our 60-apartment building, necessitating the re-keying of the building. I gather I will have to bear this expense!\n\nStill shaken by the theft, I nonetheless left the next morning for a week in Santa Fe—not the best of timing, but the trip had been planned months in advance. Wouldn’t you know, the Hayward Police Department found my car in that city the very next day— a total wreck. So, while I was enjoying the beauty of Georgia O’Keeffe country in beautiful Santa Fe, my bundle of bolts sat in a towing garage in Hayward the entire six days for a bill of $733.00!\n\nAh, but my troubles were just beginning. Filing a claim with my insurance company involved endless signing of affidavits, “total loss” forms, notarized documents, faxing, etc., etc.\n\nHowever, I must credit my insurance company with handling all this tedious red tape with dispatch and understanding. So, if there was anything good emerging from this nightmare, it was the very generous settlement the company made on my claim—so good, that by adding $300, I’m now the happy owner of a 2003 Toyota Corolla. But, darn it, I still miss my little blue 1999 Corolla!\n\nDorothy Snodgrass\n\n•\n\nREFLECTING ON THE BAILOUT\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe dust has settled a bit on the passage of the $700 billion bailout. Actually, it is more like a $1 trillion plus bailout when you add in the $200 billion for the Freddie Mae and Freddie Mac takeover, the $85 billion bailout to American International Group (AIG), and the $30 billion guarantee to JP Morgan to bailout Bear Stearns. Whether the bailout or bailouts were the best strategy for solving the financial crisis is now a moot question now. Clearly though, the bailouts are no quick fix for the problem.\n\nThe original bailout plan was a political strategy of the Bush administration through its surrogate, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to use the shock of a financial crisis to attempt to rush through a pro-corporate plan to off-load private debt onto the government/taxpayers. Luckily, public outcry forced Congress and the Bush administration to add an executive pay cap, Congressional oversight, equity for taxpayers, increased FDIC insurance protection for bank depositors, and some middle-class tax relief. But the bailout does not address the underlying causes of the financial crisis: lack of transparency, no accountability, and deregulation.\n\nForgotten are the failed or floundering businesses, who did not or will not get bailouts, and the resultant job losses.\n\nThe bailout is just the first step. The next president and Congress will be faced with some difficult fiscal decisions. The financial crisis could be used as an excuse to reduce or eliminate funds for health care, social services, education, etc. Privatizing social security will be on the table again. And of course, the free marketers will be demanding less, not more, regulation, and tax relief to “get the economy moving again.” Sen. McCain is a stay-the-course candidate, a devout deregulator, favors privatizing social security, and will, like Bush, continue to budget billions of dollars each year for the Iraq war with no timeline for an exit.\n\nEven though Sen. Obama advocates change, he would be under tremendous pressure from the right to stay the course. Remember, he and many of his fellow Democrats voted for the bailout and they succumbed to pressure to vote for lifting the ban on off-shore drilling. If elected, will he be able to resist the pressure from the free marketers and be, as promised, a stalwart leader for needed change?\n\nCongress listened to the public outcry over the bailout. It forced Congress and Bush to agree to some significant changes to the original Paulson bailout plan. The public’s job is not done. We must keep the pressure on the next administration to fix the underlying causes of the present financial crisis so it doesn’t happen again. To maintain the status quo is not the answer.\n\nRalph E. Stone\n\nSan Francisco\n\n•\n\nALBANY MAYORAL RACE\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nIf we wish to prevent Albany from becoming another Berkeley we must not reelect Mayor Bob Lieber. I like Bob and I voted for him in 2004.\n\nHowever, Bob has become the most autocratic and divisive person as mayor that I have seen in the 40 years I have lived in Albany. That includes the council in the 1970s that had three members recalled. If we want Albany to continue as a city that works, we must put the main source of the divisiveness of the last four years behind us: We must not reelect Bob.\n\nSeveral things caused me to change: You can see them in past videos of council meetings at www.robertlieber.net or Albany’s web page www.albanyca.org under Albany Rewind. Please copy and share these videos with your friends to see Bob’s behavior.\n\n1.In late 2007 Bob after serving one year refused to rotate the mayor position as has almost always been done. He would not follow tradition nor give a single inch in retaining power.\n\n2. Bob wants to radically change Albany into another Berkeley where he was born, raised, and works. You see an unprecedented seven charter amendment measures on your November ballot, more than the City of Oakland!\n\n3. After the Charter Review Committee voted three times against his Measure Y to create 16-year council terms and a directly elected mayor, Bob arrogantly put it on the ballot himself with the aid of Council members Wile and Atkinson—only three people deciding for a whole city!\n\n4. At the July 21 council public meeting for Bob’s Measure Y, Bob silenced the Charter Review Committee person reporting to the public and council on the concerns they had with Bob’s Measure Y.\n\nTo silence the person reporting to the public and the council is the action of a dictator not a mayor. I told Bob I was ashamed of him. Every councilmember except Joanne Wile subsequently apologized to the committee for Bob’s act.\n\nBob lacks the maturity, temperament and judgment to be mayor. He does not listen to constituents. His idea of democracy is to allow speakers to speak only two or three minutes with his countdown clock. He then does whatever he wants regardless of citizen input.\n\nIf you want Albany not Berkeley, if you want broad based community consensus government instead of divisiveness, please replace Bob with either Peggy Thomsen, Farid Javandel, or Nick Pilch. Bob can best serve Albany in some other capacity than mayor.\n\nJames D.

Those are the people especially in construction that we need to get back working, earning, spending and paying taxes.\n\nWe just went through a real roller coaster ride on gas prices without too much difficulty suggesting that a 10-15 cent per gallon increase in taxes on fuels could be tolerated by just about all of us. That money put into the Transportation Fund would generate many thousands of new jobs rebuilding roads and other updating of transportation. The Minneapolis bridge collapse had a follow-up report that some other bridges might be at risk, so let’s get that tax increase to get repairs done and people back to work. In addition cleaning up of some environmental and health problems could be part of the program especial electrification of railroads, which can still use the electric part of diesel electric engines through a third rail pickup. That would stop the GHG and particle emissions of those engines.\n\nSome money could be put into developing hydrogen as a fuel for transportation as well. Five different catalysts have been reported to use sunlight energy to split water. Unfortunately, big oil and energy have paid only lip service to hydrogen fearing huge write-offs if just water and sunlight can provide a clean fuel. China is one country with a report on a catalyst, so it may soon be the world leader in clean energy. Meanwhile, we keep wasting more money on subsidies for bioethanol and “clean coal” misconceptions, the latter of which Obama has regrettably put into his campaign.\n\nAgain, we can increase fuel taxes to generate jobs and stimulate the economy; Let Speaker Pelosi know at www.americanvoices@house.gov about this way to get Americans back working.\n\nJames Singmaster\n\nFremont\n\n•\n\nKLATT’S RECIPE FOR TROUBLE\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nPeter Klatt’s call for a $35 annual user fee for our public libraries is a recipe for trouble.\n\nImplementation will quickly draw complaints from those who use the library only twice a year (i.e. $17.50 a visit), compared with users who come often enough to pay only 10 cents a visit.\n\nFees for services tend to be small when instituted, then grow. Note the University of California tuition—students paid $320 a year just before the Regents instituted tuition, which was only $600 the first year. By 2003 it was over $8,000 a year.\n\nThe first couple of times the library fee is raised there will probably be fewer users, as happens when bus companies raise fares. With fewer visitors, Klatt and company will raise high the banner of abolition for libraries, at least neighborhood ones.\n\nThe abolition of local libraries would hit hard at those who don’t drive, including the children who need an after school refuge in this era when mom no longer says, “Go out and play with the other kids on the corner.”\n\nAs the library joins an increasing number of services with fees, complaints will rise about things still free, and about fees that some anti-tax cadre thinks aren’t high enough. For instance, Klatt asks in his last Planet missive, “Does Vincent think he can get a free birth at the Berkeley harbor?” Well, no, and I hope don’t drive Klatt ballistic, but, as crash pads go, our fine city marina rents births for as low as $137 a month and has showers, washing machines and other amenities for those with dinghies as well as yachts.\n\nTed Vincent\n\n•\n\nSTIMULUS PACKAGE\n\nFOR GARDENS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nI am constantly witnessing the mirroring of my life experience in the garden, as if it runs in a parallel consciousness or is a holographic representation of my awareness. Or I just notice things.\n\nOur gardens seem to be constantly in need of an economic stimulus package or bailout program to create the effects we desire. By contrast, nature’s garden doesn’t employ a gardener and will not fall apart with us going away for two weeks’ summer vacation.\n\nOur garden economy craves fertilizers and manufactured chemicals to correct “Conditions.” Nature’s garden encourages biodiversity. With built-in redundancy and multi-sourcing, it attracts microorganisms and insects to convert what we call “Green Waste” into fertilizer and good soil structure. No fertilizer purchased, and no dump fees. It draws natural predators to keep populations and consumption in balance.\n\nBy contrast, our gardens are more driven by the market forces of fashion, nostalgia and expediency. Color sells well, and there is the neighborhood to think of!\n\nMeanwhile, in their spare time, the wildlife pundits that visit our lawned gardens ponder our schizophrenic regimes of accelerator and brake. We apply water and fertilizer to grow grasses native to another region, then work hard to cut and throw them away. We might even “outsource” this work to a professional!\n\nJust as with our nation’s economy, fundamental change will need to be implemented to create fairness, sustainability and enjoyment. These changes to our thinking around gardens are evolving slowly, and we may be offered “Incentives” through climate change and water-mindfulness. Even so, nature’s garden is very patient, as evident in the post-fire evolution from bare earth to forest.\n\nI believe there is great hope for our future as we humans embrace our connection to all of Creation. May our awareness move us from economic sanctions against our very selves through our disconnection with nature to a heart-centered trust in a “Banking System” that has supported our physical and spiritual growth since time began.\n\nDavid Mudge\n\nMartinez\n\n•\n\nGREEN PARTY ENDORSEMENTS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nThe Green Party of Alameda County has published an 18-page voter guide containing analysis and recommendations for all races and ballot measures in northern Alameda County. The Guide can be viewed as an online pdf , at: www.acgreens. org or paper copies are available at many local libraries, as well as (24-hours a day) on the porch of our office at 2022 Blake St., Berkeley (half a block west of Shattuck).\n\nFor example, we have endorsed a yes vote on Measures R, T, Y, Z, AA, BB, CC, EE, FF, GG, HH, II & JJ, VV and WW, and on Propositions 2, 5 and 12; and a no vote on Measures N, P, Q, S, X, DD, LL and NN; and on Propositions 1A, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Our voter guide lists and explains the rationale for, and the gradations of, our endorsements, as well as also providing information about the 5 local measures where we did not make an endorsement (U, V, W, KK and OO).\n\nIn addition, our two-page newsletter is also included inside of the guide.\n\nGreg Jan\n\nGreen Party County Councilmember\n\nOakland\n\n•\n\nHYSTERICAL RESPONSES TO IDEAS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nRegarding the teacher who espoused creationism: Wouldn’t it be great if the 8-year-old children (note the age segregation) who were preyed upon by a teacher who had—maybe—different ideas from their folks’ and community’s, had skipped home talking with each other (you remember when we used to walk to school?), or even went to after-school care, talking about what the teacher said—“what do you think about that!?” “I think (this or that) about it.” “Well, I don’t know, how about (this or that)? etc. etc...and then gone home and said much of that with folks at home—or passed by a neighbor with whom they had a passing, caring acquaintance and quipped about it with them—and thought and heard other ideas because no one needs to learn creative thinking!— another commodification—like the rest of teaching; another product to be owned: teaching; sold on the market—teacher; providing the product history, science, physical ed, music!\n\nWhat if knowledge actually belonged to us all, with us all self-respecting and respecting others’ thinking, instead of learning to disdain it; to have only the right ideas as part of one’s experiences; with us all in our natural roles as teachers and students all our lives, in mixed formations—by age, by all manner of accidental, intentional association, instead of fitting the model that ends up serving the system of oppression the extends beyond third grade onto attempting, by our owners, to control the world.... these being necessary for an actual flowering of ourselves/us all in a kind, meaningful instead of the cramped world of today?\n\nI’ve asked some of the present school board candidates, as I did when I offered as a candidate two years ago: Given that children in the United States form a block of people segregated from the general society as well as from each other by age, marginalized in their relation to society—not allowed to participate as productive, usual members; forced into an uncomfortable faux elitist separation from folks, the relationship that creates the eventual various levels of servitude to the social system, prescribing at which level they will serve, be oppressed by, or operate the system, how do you plan to change the customary, formalized, segregated relationship?\n\nPlease do not offer remedial programs as a response. That’d be totally ducking the question.\n\nNeeding more funds—well, I suppose. But, what’d you do with them?\n\nNorma J F Harrison\n\n•\n\nLEGACY IN GOOD HANDS\n\nEditors, Daily Planet:\n\nLori Kossowsky’s letter expressing concern about continuing Dona Spring’s legacy made me smile, and gave me hope.\n\nI’m hoping many people feel the same way about supporting the issues about which Dona was passionate, but I’m supporting L A Wood as my choice to do exactly that in District 4.\n\nAll of the candidates for District 4 are honorable and dedicated people. But there is no question that only one of them has the most years of experience with the widest spectrum of community issues, the most dedication even when an issue is far outside of the community’s awareness, and has put the most effort into the most important work a human being can do; educating the community so that they understand the issues and can make the best decisions on their own behalf.\n\nIt is L A Wood and the group of concerned community members who joined with him who made it possible to confront the polluters in Berkeley with independent data. And it is L A Wood whose beautiful, heartbreaking films captured Dona Spring’s eloquent assessment of the Memorial Stadium tree-sit confrontation as “a crime scene of their (UC’s) own making” shortly before she passed away.\n\nI’m delighted by the honorable tenor of the contest so far in District 4. In my opinion, Dona Spring’s remarkable legacy is in very good hands.\n\nCarol Denney\n\nTHURSDAY, OCT. 9\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\n“Residency Projects, Part 4” Works by Adriane Colburn, Taraneh Hemami, and Leslie Shows.
