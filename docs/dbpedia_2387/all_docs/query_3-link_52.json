Writer to Writer Mentorship Program Booth.\n\nAWP Booth 1011, AWP Bookfair, West Hall, LA Convention Center.\n\nAWP's Writer to Writer Mentorship Program matches new writers with published authors for a three-month series on the writing life. Writer to Writer is open to all members, but we particularly encourage two underserved segments of our membership to apply—those writers who have never been associated with an MFA program and those writing from regions, backgrounds, and cultures that are typically underrepresented in the literary world. Now in its second year, more than 150 people have taken part in this experience. To learn more, please visit AWP's Bookfair booth, where you will be able to talk with past program mentors and mentees. Diane Zinna, the program's director, will also be there to answer your questions.\n\nNine o'clock a.m. to Ten-fifteen a.m.\n\nPanel Discussion R106. We Read Joan Didion in Order to Live: Five Writers on Learning from a Master. (Jody Keisner, Kelly Daniels, Anna Redsand, Cody Todd, Stephan Eirik Clark)\n\nGold Salon 1, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nPanelists will pay tribute to “the woman who owns California” while sharing technical and personal lessons gleaned from her essays and memoir. Topics will include the unmasking of received wisdom in Slouching Toward Bethlehem, courting moral ambiguity in her early essays, an exploration of grief in Blue Nights, the idiosyncratic \"I\" in hybrid true-crime/gonzo journalism, and how place, specifically California, fosters writerly persona in Where I Was From.\n\nPanel Discussion R107. West by Southwest: New and Established Lit Mag Editors on the Political Economy of Place. (Andrew Tonkovich, Dagoberto Gilb, Michelle Franke, Oscar Villalon)\n\nGold Salon 2, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nStarting a new literary arts journal in the West, or maintaining one for three decades, means understanding audience and place, and political and literary expectations. As respected and enduring regional lit magazines ZYZZYVA and Santa Monica Review celebrate three decades, two excellent newer journals, Rattling Wall and Huizache, arrive with their own respective missions to challenge, complement, and re-envision the possibilities of little magazines in a difficult if rewarding literary locale.\n\nPanel Discussion R108. Crashing Through: Confronting Writing Barriers and Rebooting Your Work. (Robin Black, Dylan Landis, Natalie Baszile, Steven Schwartz)\n\nGold Salon 4, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nWe have all faced obstacles in writing. Interference has many sources, both psychological and external: taboo subjects, craft challenges, despair, rejection, constraints in our nonwriting lives, fear of angering others. A diverse group of fiction and essay writers talks about their equally diverse and highly specific techniques for becoming unstuck, from using timers to meditation to writing with partners—and for turning obstacles to opportunity for taking major leaps forward in craft.\n\nPedagogy R109. Creative Writing for the Underserved: Ideas, Inspiration, Revelation. (Jamie FitzGerald, Leilani Squire, Mike Sonksen, Michael Kearns, Dorothy Randall Gray)\n\nDiamond Salon 6&7, JW Marriott LA, Third Floor.\n\nSome of the most dedicated practitioners of the art of writing are those who teach writing workshops outside of academia in underserved communities, often for little to no recompense other than the satisfaction of opening minds and hearts to the power of words. This panel brings together writers with collective experience teaching foster youth, seniors, homeless, and veteran populations. Each panelist shares best practices, what motivates them to do what they do, and how it enriches a writing life.\n\nPanel Discussion R110. What's Love Got to Do with It?: Desire in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. (Jessica Alexander, Rachel Levy, Michael Shum, Jaclyn Watterson, Jose De La Garza)\n\nRoom 402 AB, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nIn 1911, E. M. Forster wrote of his weariness of the only subject he could treat—the love of men for women. For a novelist in the Victorian era, it seemed impossible to reconcile the rift between narrative convention and homosexual desire. Discussions of narrative conventions still typically elide considerations of their socially restrictive underpinnings. This panel includes both queer and nonqueer identified writers to promote dialogue about the ways that desire informs our aesthetic choices.\n\nPanel Discussion R111. Poets on Craft: “The Furious and Burning Duende.” (John Murillo, Sandra Beasley, Mahogany Browne, Danielle Barnhart, Jacqueline Jones Lamon)\n\nRoom 404 AB, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nLorca tells us that the artist is possessed by duende, a malign spirit that burns the blood like powdered glass. This panel asks if poets can or should summon duende at will. Is it fleeting and ephemeral, or can it be harnessed as an instrument of craft? Five poets who have written about and with duende share their experiences invoking the dark, elusive creative force. We promise fiery exchanges on this evocative subject.\n\nReading R112. Flash Fiction International: Readings from the Book. (Robert Shapard, Ethel Rohan, Berit Ellingsen, James Claffey, Mónica Lavín)\n\nRoom 405, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThese authors from Norway, Mexico, and Ireland read their stories and comment on origins. Flash fiction has become a global phenomenon, and this anthology showcases the diversity of structures, styles, and narrative strategies employed by writers from different cultures. The presentation focuses on unusual character development, the role of scene setting, and the issue of translating metaphor into English. Finally, it reflects on just how large the world of small fiction can be.\n\nReading R113. The New South: A Reading in Three Genres. (Devin Latham, Dr. David Jamie Poissant, Adam Vines, Carrie Jerrell, Jamie Quatro)\n\nRoom 406 AB, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nWith Faulkner's South paved into history, what defines Southern literature today? Do contemporary Southern writers still make use of old tropes like familial loyalty, racial tension, and heavy religion set in a humid landscape of live oaks and wisteria? Does the urban and suburban South require new settings and themes? This reading features five Southern writers reading fiction, nonfiction, and poetry that illuminates and redefines Southern literature today.\n\nReading R114. Land of Upheaval: A Literary Journey Through Haiti's Modern History. (Hector Duarte Jr., M.J. Fievre, Fabienne Josaphat, Katia D. Ulysse)\n\nRoom 407, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nIt is the destiny of the people of Haiti to suffer, President François Duvalier once said. The panelists share first-person and third-person accounts of the days of Papa Doc Duvalier, the tumultuous times of President-Priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the 2012 earthquake tragedy. The panel discusses how myths and tales about Haiti have been used for political ends. Three authors. Three voices. Three slices of chaotic Haitian history.\n\nPanel Discussion R115. The Active Politics of Queer/Feminist of Color and Indigenous Feminist Publishing Movements. (Lisa Moore, Felicia Montes, Audrey Castillo, Kim Tran, Casandra Lopez)\n\nRoom 408 A, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nQueer/feminist of color and indigenous publisher-activists have historically demonstrated their commitments to amplifying the voices of transgressive artists and writers in the US publishing culture that relentlessly attempts to erase us. This gathering of queer/feminist of color publishers from As/Us, Mujeres de Maiz, RedBone, and Third Woman addresses the politics that undergird our impetus to publish alternative writing/thought and how we understand publishing as a form of activism.\n\nPanel Discussion R116. News from the California Writers' Conferences: Building and Sustaining a Creative Community. (Nan Cohen, Andrea Bewick, Lisa Alvarez, Karen Lewis, Cintia Santana)\n\nRoom 408 B, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThree of California's oldest craft-based conferences, with over one hundred years of combined operating experience, differ in structure but share a vision of a creative community that continues to support writers long after participants go home. The Napa Valley Writers' Conference, Mendocino Coast Writers' Conference, and Community of Writers at Squaw Valley will share strategies for conference participants, alumni, faculty, and staff to build and sustain a writers' community beyond the conference week.\n\nPanel Discussion R117. Welcome to the Party: Asian American Open Mics in Southern California as Sites of Resistance. (Janice Sapigao, Eddy M. Gana, Jr., Myca Tran, Stephanie Sajor, Sean Miura)\n\nRoom 409 AB, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nAs community organizers of Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) open mics in Southern California—Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Santa Ana—we give brief histories of our respective spaces. We discuss the practical, artistic, and sociopolitical intentions of encouraging and continuing work for our communities and neighborhoods. We share how Los Angeles/Southern California is part of a nationwide network of AAPI artists creating and sharing stories and narratives in collaborative space.\n\nPedagogy R118. What Our Speech Still Disrupts. (Katharine Haake, Rebbecca Brown, Marjie Stewart, Kate Kostelnik)\n\nRoom 410, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nFifteen years have passed since the publication of LA-based writer Katharine Haake's text What Our Speech Disrupts. While the theory wars are over, their impact still resonates. Haake's work—on the intersections of writing, theory, and pedagogy—is unfortunately out of print. Nonetheless, it still illuminates the marginalized spaces occupied by women, minorities, and students. Teachers and writers—among them, Haake's former student and Haake herself—discuss the book's impact on their work.\n\nPanel Discussion R119. Loving the Tug of War: Tales from the Trenches of Collaborative Translation. (Ming Di, Ellen Doré Watson, Gabriela Capraroiu, Mario Bojórquez, Alí Calderón)\n\nRoom 411, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nWhat takes precedence in translation—the source language or the target language? How useful is the author as collaborator? What do we need to know to translate well into or out of a language we weren't born to? Can informants give us enough of the guts and taste of the language and culture for us to get a poem or story right? A group of highly diverse translators of Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Romanian, and English share the highs and lows of collaborative translation.\n\nPanel Discussion R120. Printing the Forked Tongue: Bilingual Publishing After Gloria AnzaldÃºa's Borderlands/La Frontera. (Britt Haraway, elena minor, Diana Lopez, Maria Miranda Maloney, Raina J. León)\n\nRoom 501, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nGloria AnzaldÃºa demanded her freest expression, whether in Spanish, English, and/or the in-between. The literary world had trouble keeping up—and, to an extent, still does. There are contemporary publishers that take up her challenge and seize an opportunity to create open spaces for language. Whereas AnzaldÃºa was told to wash the linguistic richness off of her tongue, these editors encourage writers to blossom into their natural language palate and create their best words in the best order.\n\nPanel Discussion R121. Book Launch Confidential: Marketing Made Smarter, Not Harder. (Lynne Griffin, Michelle Toth, Eve Bridburg, Michael Blanding, Tasneem Zehra Husain)\n\nRoom 502 A, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nAuthors—no matter how they are published—must be active players in cultivating an audience using the tools available today. Yet without crystal clear goals and an honest assessment of skills and resources, the path forward can be driven by anxiety, instead of a personal strategy for success. Using a logic model, writers can learn to draw on strengths as they align activities with values and priorities, becoming advocates for their work while finding energy and joy in the process.\n\nPanel Discussion R122. Demystifying the Market: Multiple Paths to the First Book. (Casey Thayer, Nancy Reddy, Bri Cavallaro, Richie Hofmann, Malachi Black)\n\nRoom 503, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nIn a dizzying poetry marketplace, how do writers determine where to submit? Authors of books from Copper Canyon, Milkweed, Alice James, the Akron Series of Poetry, and the University of New Mexico discuss the three main avenues open to first-book poets: contests, open reading periods, and solicitation from presses. Drawing on a range of personal experience, they talk candidly about the merits of each option, offering advice on manuscript submission, the revision process, and promotion.\n\nPanel Discussion R123. Story by Design: Visual Narratives. (Zach Dodson, Keith McCleary, Alexandra Chasin, Stephen Farrell, Samantha Gorman, Warren Lehrer)\n\nRoom 504, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThere is a secret history of designed works in fiction, from Tristram Shandy to House of Leaves. Incorporating the tools of design, authors can create works of visual literature in which typography, image, and visual sequence are integral. Starting from writing and print design, these designers-as-authors, interactive storytellers, professors, and publishers of visual narrative explore the design thinking behind these works. This panel is a writer's bridge to the visual and interactive realms.\n\nPanel Discussion R124. The Science of Story: Creative Nonfiction and Cognitive Science. (Sean Prentiss, Jessica Hendry Nelson, Nancer Ballard, Dave Madden)\n\nRoom 505, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nNew research in cognitive/neuroscience illuminates how and why creative nonfiction works. Panelists explore why our perception of time slows during crisis and how to replicate crisis on the page (showing) and why the best nonfiction engages the prefrontal cortex through introspection, reflection, and speculation (components of telling). This panel examines elements of creative nonfiction and offers suggestions on how we can use science to improve our writing and writing lives.\n\nPanel Discussion R125. Short Nonfiction: A Genre for Building Literary Careers. (David Weinstein, David Groff, Jabari Asim, Sarah Seltzer, Tim Denevi)\n\nRoom 506, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nWriters of all genres benefit from publishing short nonfiction. In book reviews and op-eds, countless opportunities exist to be seen and heard—and to pave the way to book publication. Panelists at all stages of their careers discuss how to build authority in today's nonfiction landscape. Along with practical advice on breaking in, they emphasize the nuances of producing, pitching, and promoting different forms within the genre—of value to both the writer and the culture at large.\n\nPanel Discussion R126. Making Monsters: Exploring Otherness in YA/MG Literature. (Jeramey Kraatz, Kirsten Hubbard, Stephanie Kuehn, Micol Ostow, Samantha Mabry)\n\nRoom 510, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThe recognition and ownership of one's own monstrosity, in terms of being extraordinary, can be powerful and liberating. On the other hand, being labeled as a monster can strip a person of her humanity, the results of which can be devastating. Five young adult and middle grade authors representing sci-fi/fantasy, magical realism, and contemporary fiction discuss the literal and figurative monsters in their stories and how the idea of monstrousness relates to the experience of growing up.\n\nR127. AWP Program Directors Plenary Assembly.\n\nRoom 511, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nAll AWP program directors should attend and represent their programs. The trustees of AWP will report on AWP’s new projects and on important statistics and academic trends that pertain to creative writing programs and to writers who teach. The plenary assembly will be followed by regional breakout sessions.\n\nPedagogy R128. Making Connections: Creativity in the Composition Classroom. (Xinqiang Li, Joyce Meier, Leonora Smith, Stephanie Amada, Curtis VanDonkelaar)\n\nRoom 512, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThis panel discusses the use of creative content and international writing traditions in the composition classroom. Viewing the classroom as a creative space affords connections to writing for students and instructors who come to the university with differing expectations of what writing is and can be. These moves help to create cultural bridges for domestic and international students and to nourish the creative and scholarly lives of instructors.\n\nReading R129. Multiple Feminisms: Celebrating Ten Years of Switchback Books. (Hanna Andrews, Stefania Heim, Morgan Parker, Marisa Crawford, Jennifer Tamayo)\n\nRoom 513, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nSwitchback Books was founded with the vision of being an inclusive feminist poetry press, and with a mission to seek out groundbreaking work by woman-identified writers. This tenth-anniversary panel brings together a diverse group of Switchback poets who will speak on the connection between feminist perspective and aesthetic choices, reflect on Switchback's editorial process, consider the evolution of the press within the larger field of contemporary feminist writing, and read/perform from their work.\n\nPanel Discussion R130. Then We Came to the End. (Marie Mockett, Heidi Durrow, Hasanthika Sirisena, Allison Devers, Sunil Yapa)\n\nRoom 515 A, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nHow do you know when you are at the end of a story? Western stories are said to finish in one of two ways: a wedding or a funeral. The Japanese psychoanalyst Hayao Kawai has said that the preferred ending to a story in Japan is with a beautiful image. So, is the ending to a story partly a cultural preference? Does every story have one perfect ending?\n\nPanel Discussion R131. Affrilachian Poets: 25 Years of Redefining Appalachia. (Mitchell L. H. Douglas, Ricardo Nazario Colon, Ellen Hagan, Kamilah Aisha Moon, Keith Wilson)\n\nRoom 515 B, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nCentral to the purpose of the Affrilachian Poets is redefining what it means to be from Appalachia. To that extent, it has members from the 13 states found within the Appalachian region. This panel explores notions of place and culture within the group, celebrating its 25th anniversary and allies it has made along the way.\n\nPanel Discussion R132. What Does It Mean to Be a Latino? (Maria de Lourdes Victoria, Carmen Bernier-Grand, Donna Miscolta, Teresa Luengo Cid)\n\nRoom 518, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThis panel of Latino authors will explore the question of what it means to be a Latino in the United States. Whether you are an author creating a \"Latino character\" or a publisher wishing to publish \"Latino literature,\" or a librarian wondering whether a book fits within the \"Latino\" category of your catalog, this presentation will help you understand more about the rich and unique histories of the various groups of people that have been part of the US landscape for centuries.\n\nTen-thirty a.m. to Eleven forty-five a.m.\n\nPanel Discussion R133A. Coming-Out Narratives: Beyond Queer 101. (Chelsey Johnson, Justin Torres, James Hannaham, Lucy Corin, Charlie Jane Anders)\n\nGold Salon 1, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nEvery queer person has a coming-out story (or several), and queer and straight writers alike have shown an enduring fascination with writing them. As coming out remains the dominant queer narrative in America, by its sheer hegemony this trope often becomes a generic move. Five LGBTQ writers discuss what compels and/or bores us about these stories; why we write them or don't; what distinguishes a great coming-out narrative from a tepid one; and what writers get wrong when they write them.\n\nPanel Discussion R133B. Learning the Craft of Children's Literature in an Adult World. (Eliot Schrefer, Donna Freitas, Rebecca Chace, Patricia McCormick, Kathi Appelt)\n\nGold Salon 2, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nAs more writing programs add children's and YA tracks within larger pools of MFA students, it's not easy to figure out how best to teach—and learn—the craft of writing for younger audiences. Where are the traditional MFA program structures useful to those writing for children, and where are they potentially a challenge? How do we keep the highest standards for writing for children, all while defending it against those who would consider it simpler?\n\nPanel Discussion R134. Creating Opportunities for Writers of Color: A Continued Urgency. (Reginald Flood, Diem Jones, Elmaz Abinader, Angie Chuang, Angela Narciso Torres)\n\nGold Salon 3, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nWillow Books, an award-winning publisher of writers of color, and VONA/Voices, a foundation for writers of color, discuss why their missions have a renewed relevancy. Key writers, editors, and administrators discuss the current climate in publishing, in social media, and in the political world that makes creating these opportunities more vital than ever. They discuss their inspiration, their challenges, and how their work has contributed to the inclusivity of writers of color.\n\nReading R135. SoCal Magical Realism. (Heather Fowler, Ben Loory, Bonnie ZoBell, Andy Roe, Daniel Olivas)\n\nGold Salon 4, JW Marriott LA, First Floor.\n\nMagical realism has trickled up the coast from Latin America to the Golden State. Set in reality with magic introduced matter-of-factly, it's less of a genre than a style. Five SoCal writers mix it up with magical elements, most set in SoCal, some speculative. Each reads a sample of work and discusses what magical realism means in his or her writing, followed by a Q&A.\n\nPanel Discussion R136. From the Margins: Literary Magazines Supporting Writers of Color. (Jyothi Natarajan, Ron Kavanaugh, Melody Nixon, Janice Sapigao)\n\nDiamond Salon 6&7, JW Marriott LA, Third Floor.\n\n“It isn't hard to find writers of color,” Roxane Gay wrote in a 2012 blog post. “All you have to do is read.” In this panel, editors from five literary magazines dedicated to publishing writers often marginalized by the publishing industry talk about what it looks like to publish voices from the periphery. Topics include where they find new emerging writers of color, where they situate their work in the landscape of literary publishing, and what kinds of writing they're looking for now.\n\nPedagogy R137. Class Matters: Considering Class in the Classroom. (Adam Penna, Christina Marrocco, Stephanie Lindberg, KateLynn Hibbard, Mary Lannon)\n\nAWP Bookfair Stage, LA Convention Center, Exhibit Hall Level One.\n\nHow do we reach out to students with different class backgrounds in our classrooms, welcome them to creative writing workshops, and encourage them to make the literary world their own? Five writers with working-class roots share how their own stories of coming to voice and their own experiences teaching a wide range of students inform their teaching philosophies. Strategies for students, common pedagogical challenges, and best practices applicable to classrooms at all levels are discussed.\n\nReading R138. Literary Orphans Presents: Burning Down the Walls: The Art and Importance of Writing Essays That Can Change the World. (Anna March, Megan Stielstra, Michele Filgate, Jamia Wilson, Ashley Ford)\n\nScott James Bookfair Stage, LA Convention Center, Exhibit Hall Level One.\n\nEssays concerned—directly or indirectly—with the social crises of our time are receiving unprecedented readership. In that context, this panel will discuss the role of the essayist as citizen, issues surrounding personal disclosures in the socially conscious essay, their own call to create change, as well as their own recent works confronting topics such as race, feminism, queer identity, and abortion. Handouts will include a reading list, suggested markets/editors and helpful craft suggestions.\n\nReading R139. The Chapbook Across Genres. (Kate Asche, Allison Linville, Lawrence Lenhart, Leah Maines)\n\nRobert Muroff Bookfair Stage, LA Convention Center, Exhibit Hall Level One.\n\nThough commonly known as a poetic artifact, the chapbook form enjoys increasing recognition for its presentation of fiction, creative nonfiction, and hybrid works. This panel, composed of independent and university presses and journals, will explore the unique and compelling nature of the chapbook form across genres. What are its advantages and limitations over presenting work as single pieces and as book-length collections? Panelists will share resources for engaging with the chapbook form.\n\nPanel Discussion R140. Rewriting the Iconic West: Native and Latino Writers on Crafting Change. (Toni Jensen, Stephen Graham Jones, Tim Hernandez, Erika Wurth, Ito Romo)\n\nRoom 402 AB, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nFrom the cowboy on horseback to the detective on the dark city streets, the fictional icons of the West loom both familiar and large. Their stories have the ease of familiarity, but what if the stories you want to tell shift the vantage point? What if your hero is the one shot by the cowboy, the man turning the corner to avoid the detective? A diverse set of writers discusses strategies for telling the West's iconic stories through a wide range of viewpoints and in diverse cultural contexts.\n\nPanel Discussion R141. In Case You Think You Don't Belong Here: Imposter Syndrome and AWP. (Samantha Dunn, Jessie Carty, Aubrey Hirsch, Margaret LaFleur, Carmen Machado)\n\nRoom 403 A, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nAWP can be an overwhelming event. With so many writers, publishers, presses, literary journals, and academic programs in attendance, it is easy to feel like you don't belong. This feeling has a name: Imposter Syndrome. A panel of writers addresses this phenomenon and discusses ways to overcome it while offering some practical advice and strategies for getting the most out of the conference, no matter your place in the literary landscape.\n\nReading R142. Raising Lilly Ledbetter: Women Poets Occupy the Workspace—an Anthology Reading and Celebration.

Garcia, Casey Rocheteau)\n\nRoom 504, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nWhile the mixed-race population explodes in the US, there is no definitive mixed-race/multiracial experience.

(Aviya Kushner, Colleen Kinder, Curtis Bauer, Jennifer Acker) Gold Salon 1, JW Marriott LA, First Floor\n\nThis panel explores cities as sites of rebellion and revolution—personal and communal—as well as regeneration and arrival.

(Kathy Flann, Becka James, Glen Retief, Paula Barran)\n\nAWP Bookfair Stage, LA Convention Center, Exhibit Hall Level One.\n\nStudents seldom submit a draft memoir intending to bring police to their door or to forfeit their agency over reporting harm done to them.

(Janice Gary, Sue Silverman, Melissa Febos, Marilyn Bousquin, Laura Bogart)\n\nRoom 404 AB, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nGreat storytelling shows how a character grows and changes.

The inclusivity of “queer” has been contested by those who felt instrumentalized or excluded by the term.

Four poet-editors discuss their experience at the intersections of queer identity.\n\nPanel Discussion R181. From the Drudges: Sustaining a Writing Life from Outside of Academia. (Jen Fitzgerald, Rodrigo Toscano, Alyss Dixson, Ashaki Jackson)\n\nRoom 408 A, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThe lion's share of prizes, grants, fellowships, and accolades originates in academia and is awarded to academics.

What do collaborations of art, words, and music teach the collaborators about their own work?\n\nReading R185. The Poetry of Comics. (Erica Trabold, Bianca Stone, Gabrielle Bates, Alexander Rothman, Catherine Bresner)\n\nRoom 411, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nThe combination of text and image holds the power to create indivisible meaning on the page. Just as poets ground their work in the arrangement of words, ordered by such elements as sound or sense, most cartoonist-poets gravitate toward comics' foundational device of juxtaposition. The tradition of comics has created generous, exciting spaces for the poetic, lyric, and hybrid. In this panel, artists showcase and read from works that live at the intersection of the visual and the poetic.\n\nPanel Discussion R186. From the Inside: Writers of Color on Editing and Diversity.

We might not want to have a beer with them, or they with us, but our imaginations are driven, our craft sharpened by their work—for this panel, by Aeschylus's deft motifs, Dante's metatextuality, Herbert's dedication, Larkin's distinctions, and Rushdie's elaborations.\n\nPanel Discussion R188.

Do we owe them the same or different privacies on the page and online from those we preserve for other family members?

Do we have literary heroes or heroines who have answered these questions with eloquence before us?\n\nPanel Discussion R189. This Ends Now: Fiction in the Time of Crisis. (Martha Southgate, Ravi Howard, Asali Solomon, Brian Gilmore, Sanderia Faye)\n\nRoom 503, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nIf you want to change the world, pick up your pen and write–Martin Luther.

From 50/50 in 2020 to Little Black Dress, Inc., to the Kilroys, organizations working towards gender parity in theatre are all across the US. Yet the stats remain the same: Less than twenty percent of all plays produced in the US have been written by women. Representatives from LAFPI, San Diego Playwrights, and GGOT share strategies and discuss what else we might do to make gender parity in theatre a reality.\n\nPanel Discussion R191. People Are Afraid to Merge in Los Angeles. (Bridget Hoida, Jenn Rossmann, Reina Prado, Sharon Gelman, Liz Gonzalez)\n\nRoom 505, LA Convention Center, Meeting Room Level.\n\nLiterary Los Angeles is often the subject of surface-deep satire, but the focus on zip codes in the Hollywood glare leaves other stories undertold.

What makes a successful essay of this kind, for the writer and for the reader? How can writers craft and place essays that both are meaningful in their own right and acquaint the reader with them and with their books? The five writers on this panel explore, along with the audience, the place of the book-related essay in a writer's life and career.\n\nPanel Discussion R194.

Five poets who translate, sample, and co-author collaborate here to discuss the innovations, advantages, and artistry of working with other writers—both living and dead.\n\nPedagogy R195.
