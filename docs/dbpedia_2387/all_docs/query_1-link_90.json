Thanks also to nurses Dawn and Rachel for the wonderful care they gave to John, and to Joan Yazbac who tried so hard to save John and was so compassionate.\n\nJohn had a saying he lived by, “Don’t judge someone until you’ve walked in their moccasins.”\n\nGood night and sweet dreams, my love.\n\nKevin C.

She was always working hard, taking care of the children, then grandkids and always working on the farm. She enjoyed cooking, canning, gardening, reading and doing word puzzles. She also enjoyed crafts and sewing (somebody always had something to mend and she could fix just about anything). In her younger years, Elaine and Jerry loved to polka dance and were so smooth and graceful on the dance floor (when the knees permitted).\n\nShe loved a good game of sheepshead with her family and long phone conversations when visiting in person didn't permit. There were many conversations with her daughters about cooking, new recipes and cookbooks. She taught all of her children the old world ways which developed our love for cooking. Thank you for that.\n\nShe took great pride in her grandchildren and now her great grandchildren. They could always count on her to cook or bake their favorites. They could even phone in lunch requests to Grandma and she would have it ready for them on lunch breaks. She loved a good campfire, side pork on the fire pit and a good glass of wine. But mostly she loved spending time with family.\n\nElaine will be deeply missed by her three children; Phyllis (Kenny) Deprez, Mike (Roberta) Dufek and Deanna (Terry) Jorgenson; seven grandchildren; Lucas (Leigh) Deprez, Eric Deprez, Jeremy Dufek, Jamie Dufek, Christopher (Tiffany) Dufek, Danielle Jorgenson and Talia Jorgenson (significant other Nik Van Beek); three great grandchildren Elaina (Elaine's namesake), Stella and Scarlett; Mary Beth Dufek (mother of Mike's children); two sisters Carole (Joe) Boulanger and Rita Boedecker; sister-in-law Evelyn Steiner and many nieces and nephews.

As the oldest sibling, he loved to give advice, whether it was about saving, being frugal (“don’t buy what you want to eat, buy what’s on sale”), or about honesty (“better to have someone steal $100 from you than to take a penny from them”).

He helped Julia choose the college major of Paper Science and was so extremely proud of her career and life accomplishments, including the love she found with her husband, Andy.\n\nHank was blessed with 3 grandchildren, who were the light of his life. He visited on a weekly basis, and babysat regularly, often asking how much he was allowed to pay for his babysitting fun. Papa Hank provided many adventures for his grandkids, including teaching them to fish, going to cottages, playing “candy math,” inventing backyard games, and telling wonderful bedtime stories that were filled with morals of humility and kindness. He loved to have sleepovers with the kids and also made special time for one-on-one activities, including teaching moments, secret fishing trips, chess matches, McDonald’s visits, or Red Room lunches. His love and pride for his grandchildren was unparalleled.\n\nHank was preceded in death by his father, Kenneth Anderson, and his aunts and uncles.

He was 81 years old.\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Norman began piano lessons at the age of six, added violin soon after, and turned to the horn at age thirteen. His first horn teachers were Odolindo Perissi and Sinclair Lott, both members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. During high school, Norman won a scholarship to the Aspen Music Festival, where he studied with Joseph Eger. In 1955, he auditioned for Erich Leinsdorf, then music director of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, and won his first professional post as fourth horn there. He was its youngest member and in succeeding years played second and third horn.\n\nWhile in Rochester, Norman attended the Eastman School of Music and performed and recorded with the Eastman Wind Ensemble under Frederick Fennell. Studying with Morris Secon and Verne Reynolds, he graduated in 1961 with a bachelor’s degree and a performer’s certificate in horn. During his eleven-year tenure in Rochester, Norman served three years with the United States Military Academy Band at West Point as well as five years on the faculty of the Interlochen Arts Academy as instructor of horn and a member of the Interlochen Arts Quintet.\n\nIn June of 1971, at the invitation of music director Georg Solti, Norman joined the Chicago Symphony as assistant principal horn, just in time for the Orchestra’s first tour to Europe. In 1975, he was named second horn, the position he held until his retirement in 1997 (he continued to play as a substitute or extra until June 2006). Norman appeared as a soloist with the Orchestra on a number of occasions, and in March 1977 he—along with colleagues Dale Clevenger, Richard Oldberg, and Thomas Howell—was soloist in the recording of Schumann’s Konzertstück for Four Horns under the baton of Daniel Barenboim for Deutsche Grammophon.\n\nIn 1970, Norman chaired the International Horn Society’s organizing committee and served as its first secretary and treasurer. He continued on the advisory council, contributed many articles to The Horn Call, and was elected an honorary member in 1996. From 1973 until 1998, Norman served as associate professor of horn on the faculty of Northwestern University.\n\nIn his retirement, Norman, and his wife, Sally—a thirty-year veteran of the Chicago Symphony Chorus—made their home on Washington Island in Wisconsin, where he performed with the Washington Island Music Festival. They were longtime members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Alumni Association, regularly attending annual reunions. Norman also continued his research into the lives of U.S. orchestra members, a project that he started while studying at Eastman, and his collection of material on the subject is likely the largest private collection of its kind in the world. In 2012, Norman’s book The Horns of Valhalla—the story of horn players Josef and Xaver Reiter—was published by WindSong Press Limited.\n\nNorman is survived by Sally, his beloved wife of fifty-seven years; and their son Eric, principal timpani of the Fort Wayne Philharmonic.\n\nA memorial service to honor Norman’s life will be held at a later date. Burial will be in the Washington Island Cemetery.\n\nCasperson Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements. Expressions of sympathy, memories, and photos of Norman can be shared with his family through his tribute page at www.caspersonfuneralhome.com.\n\nMyra J.

Wendy had a beaming personality with a cheerful smile that warmed the people she met. She cared so much about others, as demonstrated by her favorite line she would ask people she saw; “How are you?” As she spent time at Children’s Hospital, her hope changed from going to UWGB to traveling to foreign countries to help children with medical needs.\n\nWendy is survived by her parents: Hans & Beth (nee Kukor) Lux, Jr. of Washington Island; four sisters: Bryn (Steve) Eisfelder of Santa Clara, CA, Kyra, Rylee, and Hayden at home, and four brothers: David Lepley of Scottsdale, AZ, Evan, Zachary, and Joseph at home; grandparents: Hans & Emmi Lux of Milwaukee; aunts: Sue Semrow of Waukesha and Sherry Korner of University City, MO, and one uncle: Jeff Lux of Cudahy; other relatives; and friends\n\nShe was preceded in death by her grandparents: Julius & Genevieve Kukor.\n\nA gathering of friends will be held on Saturday, January 12, 2019 at Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church on Washington Island from 11:30 am to 12:30 pm.

She lived each day with intention and purpose—whether the purpose was to prepare for one of her book groups, volunteer with the Peninsula Music Festival or Björklunden, or test yet another soup recipe she’d spotted in The New York Times. She might reorganize the 15 binders of family history she’d compiled or finish a sweater she was knitting for a friend. She might spend the morning watching her bird feeder, bird book in hand. She was known to answer calls for emergency knitting assistance—like the time she recently helped a friend finish a pair of socks for a niece’s birthday.\n\nGretchen and her twin brother, John, were born on October 21, 1930, to John and Florence Wilterding in Neenah, Wisconsin. She spent her childhood in Menasha—along with John, her sister, Nancy, and younger brother Mark—where adventures included camping in her beloved Door County. She loved music and played several instruments including piano; she even had a stint with a jazz band called Sharps and Flats.\n\nGretchen studied history at Lawrence College and in 1950 married Jacob “Cap” Louis Pawer, Jr., a Navy fighter pilot. She gave birth to Jacob III (“Jake”) in 1953. When Cap was killed in the Korean War, Gretchen returned to Menasha. She married John Vogel Maring in 1955 and raised children Jake, Nancy, John Jr., and Charles in Neenah. Her children were inspired not only by her talents, but by the way she treated everyone she met with equal kindness and respect. She and John retired to Door County, where she proceeded to befriend basically everyone.\n\nGretchen recently made us swear we would never “bore people” with a list of her accomplishments. Suffice it to say, she won multiple awards for volunteerism and served on many boards. She was a voracious reader and loved the arts, as well as working in her garden. She will be greatly missed by her extensive family and community of friends.\n\nIf you’d like to honor Gretchen, share a recipe or feed the birds outside your window. Make someone feel special and see their own talents; she did that for all of us. Gretchen will be cremated, and a celebration of her life will be held at a later date: details will be announced in the future.\n\nCasperson Funeral Home in Sister Bay is assisting the family. Memories may be shared through her tribute page at www.caspersonfuneralhome.com. Donations can be made in Gretchen’s name to The Clearing Folk School, Peninsula Music Festival, and Björklunden. The family would like to thank the first responders from the Sister Bay/Liberty Grove Fire Department and the wonderful staff at Door County Medical Center and Unity Hospice.\n\nLeon Arthur Stephenson, 78, of Green Bay, was summoned to his heavenly Home believing God’s promise of eternal life on Friday, December 28, 2018.\n\nLeon was born June 17, 1940 in Sturgeon Bay, the son of the late Arthur Levi and Stella Gertrude (Felhofer) Stephenson. Leon attended Sevastopol Consolidated School and furthered his education at Stout State college (UW Stout) where he was granted B.S. and M.S. degrees. He received the Medallion Award for wrestling and was inducted into the UW Stout Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989. On June 13, 1964, he was united in marriage with Berdella Ann Kiehnau at Zion Ev. Lutheran Church in West Jacksonport.\n\nHe spent his entire teaching career – more than 50 years – at Preble High School. Leon coached wrestling for 15 years and taught an NWTC adjunct adult woodworking class for more than 34 years. Leon also served on the curriculum committee and judged woodworking projects for NWTC. He retired from Preble in 1995 and from NWTC in 2012.\n\nHe was a member of Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church in West Jacksonport. Leon’s faith was important to him and he bore the illness of his later life patiently, without complaining. He was a kind, mild mannered, soft spoken gentleman of his word. He was a skilled woodworker, always striving for perfection in all that he did. Leon’s last major project was an advent wreath stand for Zion church.\n\nLeon enjoyed snowmobiling, especially a trip to Canada with Sno-Decker Tours. He was at peace sailing the bay of Green Bay on his sailboat, Uncle’s Toy. He enjoyed taking friends out to the middle of the bay for Sunday brunch on the boat. Antique cars were another passion. He enjoyed having friends ride in the parades in Door County in his 1927 Chevy Sedan. He LOVED a parade and would often invite children to hop on the running board and toot the horn. His pride and joy was his 1937 Chevrolet Coupe, “Black Beauty”. He was the 3rd owner and he owned it for over 30 years.\n\nHe liked to get out in the woods and joined in making firewood each Thanksgiving weekend with family. Leon loved to get up early and watch the birds at the feeders and the water fowl on the bay. He always took time to reflect on the day as he watched the sun set over the bay.\n\nLeon and Berdella traveled extensively together, including two trips to Alaska. Along the way, he always looked forward to hiking the trails in the U.S. National Parks. They camped out of the back of the pickup truck for 36 years in a cap that he outfitted for them, until they bought an RV. They traveled to Europe for a cruise on the great rivers of Europe and toured Costa Rica and Guatemala.\n\nHe loved children and cherished his role as uncle. The neighborhood children sought him out, ringing the doorbell to ask if Mr. Stephenson could come out to play. They were all treated to snowmobile rides and inner tubing on the bay ice. He made the ride more exciting by shoveling up snow speed bumps. The children loved to spend time in his shop in the summer. There were always plenty of nails to pound into soft pine boards to make designs to paint. They also learned how to use a hand saw. He worked to inspire creativity and to share his love of woodworking.\n\nLeon will be missed by his brother, Elton (Dee) Stephenson; sister, Jane (Ron) Splingaire; sister-in-law, Joyce Stephenson; nieces and nephews, Larry (Cheryl) Stephenson, Beth (John) Barnott, Sherri (Scott) Tomb, Jeff (Heather) Stephenson, Andrew Splingaire, Julie (Cory) Behnke, and Timothy Splingaire; great-nieces and nephews, Ashley Stephenson, Jake Bernott, Alex and Austin Tomb, Brooke and Emily Splingaire, and Josie and Lainie Marie Behnke; the Kiehnau family: sister-in-law, Marilyn DeNamur, nephews, Michael (Karla) DeNamur, David (Terri) DeNamur; niece, Sarah DeNamur and great-nephews, Christopher Ray and Charlie Basch.\n\nLeon was welcomed Home by his parents, Arthur (2007) and Stella (Felhofer) Stephenson (2009); brother, Eugene (2009); sister-in-law, Betty (Haen) Stephenson (2014); and brother-in-law, Gary DeNamur (2018).\n\nLeon’s beloved wife Berdella passed away on December 30, 2018 and they are surely now reunited in heaven.\n\nA service in celebration of Leon and Berdella’s lives will be held at Zion Ev. Lutheran Church in West Jacksonport at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, January 4, 2018 with Pastor Peter Lindemann officiating. Burial will follow in Zion Ev. Lutheran Cemetery, alongside his wife, Berdella.\n\nFriends may call from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m., Thursday, at Huehns Funeral Home in Sturgeon Bay with a devotion immediately following at 7:00 p.m.\n\nSpecial thanks to his caregivers who treated him with love, compassion, dignity and respect during his arduous journey.\n\nWilma A.

Barbara was born December 14, 1928, in Westport, CN, to the late Laurence and Ruth (Thorne) Moomau. Barbara graduated from Staples High School in Westport in 1946. She went on to attend and graduate from Women’s College of the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. After graduation, Barbara made the trek westward as a young single woman to Green Bay for a position with the local YWCA. It was while in Green Bay that she met her future husband, Lloyd Wright, on a blind date. Barbara and Lloyd were married January 24, 1953, and enjoyed 45 years of marriage together. They started their family and lived in Green Bay for several years. They moved to Kewaunee in 1957 when Lloyd took a position with Leyse Aluminum. They made Kewaunee their home for the rest of their lives. After Lloyd, Barbara’s greatest love was being a mother to her children. She was one of the most encouraging and accepting parents a child could have. While not afraid to be the occasional enforcer, she was most comfortable and effective in providing nurturing and guidance to her children as they each navigated the triumphs and travails of growing up. She was not afraid to often inject a little (or a lot of) crazy silliness into family life, in spite of her family’s occasional embarrassment. Quirky mis-matched outfits and earrings, flashing holiday necklaces, holiday headbands at any time of year, and the occasional “goosing” were all part of her nurturing efforts and keeping any family get together memorable. As if that didn’t keep her busy enough, Barbara also kept the family fed with the thousands of loaves of bread that she baked, and by keeping the fruit cellar full of the jars and jars of cherries, raspberries, peaches, beets, corn and beans she annually canned, and the innumerable jellies and jams she made.\n\nBarbara’s heart and true calling was in helping the youth and elderly in the community. When her family was young, Barbara was an active Girl Scout Leader for many years, and was part of organizing the Kewaunee Youth-Go club that met above the downtown fire station. As the children grew up and eventually left home, Barbara began working at the Kewaunee Nursing Home. She was a committed and dedicated volunteer and part-time employee at the home where she served as an “Activities Director”. She would have done this job for free she so enjoyed it. She truly loved spending time with the residents regaling them with her infectious and quirky personality, her unique “work” outfits of mis-matched bold colored socks and earrings, her boisterous laugh, her desire to speak with any and everyone. She so enjoyed wanting to bring joy and happiness to everyone in the home.\n\nBarbara was diagnosed with dementia in her later years which gradually affected her memory and physical and verbal abilities. But it never affected her core of a kind and happy spirit. She maintained her upbeat and positive outlook throughout, welcoming every visitor with a warm and open smile, quick to laugh, and always, always remembering to ask about each and every member of the family.\n\nThe family wishes to extend our sincerest thanks and appreciation to Kathy Goija, Ken Secor and the entire staff at Silver Leaf Manor. Their patience, kindness and understanding shown in caring for our mother and the challenges she sometimes presented will not be forgotten. We would also like to thank MaryKay Messmann and the care giving staff at Linden Manor for their assistance and care for our mother while she was a resident there. And, finally, we wish to thank Unity Hospice for their compassion, care and understanding.\n\nBarbara is survived by five children: Larry (Sue) Wright, Appleton; Elizabeth Rucinski, Green Bay; Sarah Wright, Chicago; Mary (Jeff) Serafico, Sturgeon Bay; and, Carrie (Pat) Dorn, Luxemburg; twelve grandchildren: Nicholas (Emily) Wright, Brittany Wright (Deavon Mitchell), Daniel Wright, Madeline Wright, April VanderHeyden, Ashley (Jeff) Kempton, Dennis Rucinski, Adrian Serafico, Stella Serafico, Scarlet Serafico, Matthew Dorn and Sawyer Dorn; and eight great-grandchildren: Caleb Wright, Anna Wright, Vera Wright, McKenzie Loberger, Caden Loberger, Jon Loberger, Jr., Braelyn Kempton and Charlie Kempton.\n\nBarbara was preceded in death by her husband, Lloyd, Sr., her daughter, Ruth, and her son, Lloyd, Jr. A granddaughter, Alyssa Dorn, a step-granddaughter, Alaya Serafico, and a special family friend, Brian Linzmeier, also preceded her in death.\n\nFriends may call after 4:00 p.m. Friday, January 4 at Buchanan Funeral Home, Kewaunee. Visitation continues on Saturday at St. Agnes Episcopal Church, Algoma after 10:00 a.m. until the time of services at 11:00 a.m. conducted by Fr. Rob Hoppe.\n\nIn Lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the family to be given to a charity to be determined later.\n\nLove you Mom. We miss you already, Larry, Liz, Sarah, Mary and Carrie."
