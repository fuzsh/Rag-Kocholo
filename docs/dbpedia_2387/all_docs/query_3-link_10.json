The funeral was very largely attended by relatives and friends. Mrs. Haught is survived by her husband and three sons, J. S. Haught, F. M. Haught, and G. W. Haught, besides a number of grandchildren and scores of other relatives. Mrs. Haught had passed her three score and ten years at the time of her death. She was Miss Elizabeth Inghram before her marriage. I am informed that her people, Jacob Burgett and his two sisters, Polly Inghram and Betsy Paul, came to Masontown 70 years ago from Burgettstown, Washington county, Pa. The writer remembers the little log house in which they lived on South Main street. One story log houses were common in those days. Lizzie Haught, the subject of this sketch, was a woman of service all her life. Doctor Shively said to the writer, She was a great mother. She belonged to that class of women who are always willing to lend a helping hand in time of need. She was a good home maker. Some of her grandsons saw service in the World War and her husband, a veteran steamboat engineer, took charge of a steamer to help out during the war, notwithstanding his advanced age. She was an old time mother who made her home a place of welcome to all. She will be sadly missed by her family.\n\nThe Morning Herald, Uniontown, PA, Thursday, July 22, 1920, page 7, column 3\n\nContributed by Brenda Turner Blake < blakeb28 at yahoo.com>\n\nElizabeth HAUGHT ( -1934)\n\nMRS.

The Ferguson disaster comes as a sad memento to the Hill Farm horror of 13 years ago, for the statements of the mine experts show that the shouldering Hill Farm fire probably fired a body of gas in the old working at Ferguson. These are the dead, missing and injured.\n\nTHE DEAD\n\nJames McGurk, 22 years old, son of Fire Boss, John McGurk.\n\nWheatly Foster, 21 years old and single.\n\nMike Samandre, married, wife and family in the old county.\n\nJoseph Ocklan, 27 years old and single.\n\nPeter Sekora, 32 years old and married, wife and three children.\n\nJohn Sedravia, 39 years old, has wife and family in the old county.\n\nCharles Vera, 42 years old, has wife and family in the old county.\n\nMike Sekora, 22 years old and single.\n\nAndy Kootsar, 38 years old and married, leaves wife and three children.\n\nMike Havarsjack, 24 years old, leaves wife and family in the old country.\n\nRijack Baleslaf, died at the Cottage State Hospital Sunday afternoon, 28 years old and single.\n\nWilliam Foster, aged 48 years, died at the Cottage State Hospital this morning. Remains will be sent to his home near Dunbar.\n\nTHE MISSING\n\nMichael Bene, a Slav\n\nTHE INJURED\n\nJohn McGurk, 39 years old, wife and five children, thought to have been fatally burned, cannot recover.\n\nJohn Foster, 19 years old, serious burns about the body and face in a dangerous condition, will not recover.\n\nAdam Linka, fatal burns, cannot recover.\n\nJoseph Doviac, seriously burned about the body and face, condition considered serious.\n\nJohn Patrick, badly burned, will recover.\n\nJohn Marchich, severely burned about body and face.\n\nJohn Korchusch, seriously burned.\n\nFred Longden, slightly burned.\n\nThe explosion occurred 10 minutes after the night shift had gone into the slope on Saturday evening. Because the mine is almost worked out only 21 men were employed in it. The work was 1100 feet from the mouth of the slope. The men were working in the entries near the main heading drawing ribs and letting down the roof. In about six months the mine would have been closed up. The miners had gone to their accustomed places and were just beginning the labors of the night when with a rush and uproar the blue flame of death swept up the slope entries and enveloped them. Some were hurled along the passages and crushed against the side of the mine. Others not in the direct path of the flame were overcome by the deadly black damp which followed the explosion.\n\nOToole, the engineer at the main house saw the smoke and dust roll out of the mouth of the slope and knew that an explosion had happened. He tied down his work whistle and its shrill wail carried the news of terror over the countryside. Then John McGurk staggered out shrieking for help. In a few minutes the mouth of the slope was crowded with miners and a rescue party hastily formed. Headed by Robert Nelson, brave miners went into the place of death and assisted the injured to the outside. The dead were brought out with them.\n\nMorgue and Hospital\n\nMorgue and hospital were combined for the time being in the little black smith shop outside the mine. Here Drs. McKinney, Colley and Warne of Dunbar were called and gave the survivors first aid. The burned men were swashed in oiled cloths, and prepared to be sent to the Cottage State Hospital here. Three of them, however, preferred to be taken to their homes. Among these was Fire Boss John McGurk, who is badly injured.\n\nThe Pittsburg, McKeesport & Connellsville railway supplied a special car to bring the injured to the hospital, and the car made a record run over the road. The entire staff of the hospital was summoned, and as soon as the seven injured arrived they were given the best attention that the medical profession can offer. Sunday afternoon, however, Rijack Beleslaf, a Polishman, died, and after midnight this morning William Foster breathed his last. More deaths are expected at the hospital almost any time.\n\nUp at the improvised morgue, Undertaker J. M. Burhans of Dunbar assisted by D. C. Fortz, cleaned up the bodies, and prepared them for burial. One by one they were dressed and laid on slabs on the floor of the shop. Almost all this work was done Saturday night.\n\nIdentifying the Dead\n\nWith the dawning of day, Sunday, crowds began to gather at the Ferguson mine. The idly curious mingled with the heart broken friends and relatives of the dead. Rapidly the work of identification went on. The names of the men who were first identified by their numbers were secured at the office of the Dunbar Furnace Company and the bodies labeled and numbered. All day long crowds thronged the scene of death. Canvas was hung up on the blacksmith shop windows to keep away the morbidly curious. Shortly before noon Sunday, Robert Nelson and a rescue party went in to search for the missing man, Michael Bene. Outside at the manway, a crown waited for tidings of him. When the rescue party came out in the evening however he had not been found. Something that looked like his coat had been found in one of the passages.\n\nThis morning a party in charge of James Conroy and James Palsley again entered the mine. They are making a thorough search and expect to bring the body of Bene out with them. The mine is not on fire and no further danger is anticipated for the present.\n\nThis morning, Dr. McKinney of Dunbar, reports the condition of John McGurk somewhat improved. He had bad burns but his physician hopes that he has not inhaled the fire and thinks he has considerable chance for life. The condition of the two foreigners who are at their homes are somewhat improved.\n\nRemainder of article is unreadable.\n\nThe Courier, Connellsville, PA, Monday Evening, November 23, 1903, page 1, column 1\n\nContributed by Brenda Turner Blake < blakeb28 at yahoo.com>\n\nAnna C.

The day's work was about completed and William was filling out a wagon which was about half loaded. To do this he was \"robbing a stump.\" There had been a fall of coal there and assistant mine boss Wilson had advised the workmen not to draw any more from that point until today. William Hawk disregarded the advice and the chance proved fatal to him. When the fell started David and Peter rushed to his rescue. David held the slate up for a bit when a second fall came and crushed him to death instantly. Peter was also caught and was badly bruised but not fatally. William was finally taken out from under the slate but died half an hour afterwards. Coroner Taylor came down and in company with Mine Inspector Conner upon looking into the matter decided that the company was not to blame and that no inquest was necessary. This is the first fatal accident at the Percy Mine for 20 years.\n\nThe Hawk brothers lived in Yauger Hollow, were old employees of the company and substantial citizens of the community.

He had been ill for several months, his condition becoming critical about the first of the year. Mr Hawker had lived retired for some years past and with the exception of 10 years, spent at Fayette City, he had resided near Dunbar all his life. He was well known in that community.

His obit was contributed to the Fayette County USGenWeb Project. (2)\n\nAll Western Pennsylvania is today a house of mourning, because of the death of the gallant commander of the Tenth regiment, Col. Alexander Leroy Hawkins. In this grief, too, a whole state, and more, joins, for the valor of the colonel had reached far beyond the bounds from which his now famous regiment comes.\n\nCol. Hawkins was a typical soldier, born to lead, and he asked his men to go only where he himself led the way. He was the embodiment of courage and chivalry, and his care and forethought for his soldiers caused him to be affectionately known among them as \"Pap Hawkins.\" Though not a Regular army officer, he knew more about drill, tactics and real war than most of those who hold West Point diplomas, and this jealousy of his superiors at Manila, and his refusal to take any snubs from them, doubtless explains the tardiness of official recommendation for his promotion.\n\nThe death of Col. Hawkins comes at a time that renders it peculiarly sad. He had survived the hardships of the Philippine campaign and was homeward bound, soon to enjoy the greeting of family and receive the plaudits of neighbors and friends, perhaps high honors of state from his fellow citizens. All is cut short by the last enemy, and joy is turned to mourning.\n\nThe preparations for receiving the Tenth will go on, but the glad welcome will be tempered with sorrow that the boys return home not following their loved commander, but bringing his body.\n\nThe leaderless Tenth will be welcomed home with subdued acclaim, and all will mingle their rejoicing with praises of the gallant deeds of the hero of two wars, who gave the best he had to his country and laid down his life on the altar of patriotism.\n\n(August 3, 1899 handwritten at bottom of obit)\n\nBasil HAWKINS ( -1936)\n\nBASIL HAWKINS\n\nDROPS DEAD WHILE\n\nON WAY TO WORK\n\nBasil Hawkins, 50 years old, of Pechin, dropped dead of a heart attack at Mount Braddock at 6:30 oclock this morning while enroute to his work at the Liberty Powder Company.

He was born in Georges township, in this county, September 6, 1800. In 1824 he married Eliza Springer, the second daughter of Jacob Springer. They had ten children, one of whom died in infancy, and Sylvester C., and Emily, wife of Archibald Skiles, of Iowa, died after they were grown. Albert S., and Jacob S., reside at Fairmont, West Va.; Chauncy B., in Benton county, Iowa; Napoleon B., in Saline county, Nebraska; Elizabeth A., wife of John Custead; Albina S. wife of Milford Shipley; and Mary A., widow of F. K. Martin, deceased, reside in Monroe. At the age of nineteen, Benjamin Hayden taught school at Crow's School-house, in Springhill township, afterwards at B. Brownfield's School-house, and also at Monroe. He was for several years a clerk at Redstone Furnace. From September 1, 1827, to March 1, 1829, in partnership with Hon. John Huston, operated Hampton Forge, at the mouth of Indian creek, on the Youghiogheny. From 1831 to 1862, a period of thirty-one years, he was continuously engaged in the mercantile business in the village of Monroe, since which time he has been engaged in no business. His father was John Hayden, who was born on Staten Island in 1749 and who was the father of twenty-two children, twelve by his first marriage and ten by his second, the subject of this notice being the second son of the second marriage.\n\n[2011 note: John Hayden was actually born in Morristown, NJ, according to John's application for military pension, as recorded in the Hayden Family Mag, a quarterly written and published from 1929 - 1933 by Benjamin's brother Henry's grandson Charles Hayden, son of Enoch. There was a Staten Island connection however: Benjamin's grandmother Lydia (Casted or Kierstede) Hayden was christened and married (to William Hayden) on Staten Island (Lydia may have been born in Queens).]\n\nThese last ten children were all born on the farm now owned and occupied by F. Laughead, in Georges township. Benjamin Hayden had but a meagre opportunity to obtain an education, nevertheless he was a fair scholar, though he never attended school but three months. He was a man of considerable information and of unyielding Integrity, and having taken his stand on any subject, he could not be removed therefrom without the most undoubted testimony. His remains were interred in the graveyard near Monroe, on Monday, August 27, where a large concourse of friends and relatives had convened to perform the last act for a kind husband and father.\n\n(2011 note: Monroe, PA (previously known as Woodstock) is now known as Hopwood, PA.

He was sent immediately to Pittsburgh where he was accepted and assigned to Company K, 116th Pennsylvania Regiment of Volunteers.\n\nTwo weeks later he was on picket duty on the Rappahannock and on May 10 he engaged in his first real battle at Po River, Va. He was later transferred to the First Division, Second Army of the Potomac, under command of General Hancock.\n\nMr. Hayden participated in numerous important battles of the war his 16th birthday having been spent in the thick of Battle on the front. He was wounded twice and only recently was decorated with the Purple Heart Medal.\n\nIncluded among the battles Hayden is credited with on his Honorable Discharge were the Battle of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864; the siege of Petersburg where he was in the lines for three months, and others. He was present at Appomattox and participated in the Grand Review in Washington, D.C., after the war.\n\nMr. Hayden relates that during one of the battles he and Plummer Hall, also of Ohiopyle, came upon a wounded soldier and upon going to him found him to be Zed Collins, also of Ohiopyle, and a close friend of both. Collins, a member of the 140th Infantry, was carried to the rear by his two friends. After Collins' recovery the two \"cronies\" met often in the lines, Hayden said.\n\nDuring the war, Private Hayden's parents, Abraham and Ana Hayden, removed from Ohiopyle to Farmington, and it was to the new home there that John R. returned following his discharge July 14, 1865.\n\nMr. Hayden will be 88 on September 17, next should be live.\n\n(88th Birthday Article)\n\nJoseph HAYDEN ( -1905)\n\nJOSEPH HAYDEN DEAD\n\nUniontown's Oldest Citizen Passes\n\nQuietly Away on Wednesday Morning.\n\nHE WAS IN 93RD YEAR OF HIS AGE\n\nHis Father and Himself Had Unbroken Record of Voting for\n\nPresidential Candidates from Jefferson to Parker - Witnessed Great\n\nBrownfield-Campbell Debate\n\nUniontown's oldest person, Joseph Hayden, aged over 92 years, died\n\nat an early hour Wednesday morning, May 3, 1905,\n\nat his home on Union street.\n\nMr. Hayden received a fall almost a year ago which resulted in a fracture of the hip and since that time he had been confined to his home. Death resulted from ailments incident to old age. The deceased was born July 9, 1812, in Georges township and was a son of John Hayden, a revolutionary soldier and one of the pioneer settlers of Fayette county and the first to make iron west of the Allegheny mountains. John Hayden was the father of 22 children, of whom 12 were sons and Joseph Hayden was the sole survivor of this large family.\n\nAn unbroken record of father and son having voted in every presidential election from the beginning of the government up to the present time was represented by Joseph Hayden. His father, John Hayden, voted in every election from the beginning of the government in 1789 up to his death, July 24, 1836, the same year that his son Joseph was first old enough to vote in a presidential election and thus carry forward uninterrupted the record of voting. Joseph Hayden voted at every election since 1836, or 13 in all, casting his vote last year for Alton B. Parker. He was always a Democrat. Many years ago Mr. Hayden was a candidate for county commissioner and as an evidence of his popularity although there were 14 candidates in the race and Wharton was not his home township yet he received every one of the 90 votes cast in that township, but was defeated for the office by a plurality of seven votes.\n\nAlthough born two years after the murder of Polly Williams at White Rocks Mr. Hayden in his childhood heard the story of the murder so often and it was so impressed upon his mind that in his old age he frequently remarked that he could remember things that happened before he was born. In those early days of the last century, a murder was unusual and created great excitement and it was the leading topic of conversation for several years and Mr. Hayden heard the story time and again until it seemed that he knew it as if he were there when it happened. Polly Williams was buried about 200 yards from Joseph Hayden's father's house and the sandstone marker over the grave could be seen from the front door of the Hayden house.\n\nBesides being the oldest person in Uniontown, Mr. Hayden was the only person living here who was present at the Redstone Association meeting in the old Redstone church at Smock when Alexander Campbell and Rev. William Brownfield had their memorable debate in 1826 which led to Campbell leaving the Baptist church and founding another church. Mr. Hayden also remembered the visit of Gen. Lafayette to Uniontown May 28, 1825 and many other important events in Uniontown and Fayette Co. Mr. Hayden had for many years been a member of the Baptist church. He was early married and his wife died years ago. There are surviving a daughter Miss Mary, at home, and a son Ayers Hayden who is past 70 years of age, and lives at East Liberty, near Vanderbilt. Another daughter lives in Missouri. Mr. Hayden during the greater part of his life followed farming.\n\nThe funeral will take place Friday at 2 p. m. from the Baptist church with services by Dr. H. F. King. Interment in White Rock cemetery.\n\n(2011 note: Joseph's wife (who predeceased him) was Elizabeth Beals. Joseph's parents were the Rev War veteran John Hayden and his 2nd wife Mary (Snider or Sniwebney) Hayden who died Oct 13, 1863, age 90, daughter of Henry Sniwebney. John and Mary had at least 12 children: Henry, Benjamin, Susan, Catherine who married John Holtzman, Lydia, Samuel, Joseph, Jacob, Mary, Abraham, Squire Ayers, and Agnes. John Hayden and his 1st wife Charity Gard had at least 10 children. John received a veteran's pension until his death in July 1836. Mary received a widow's pension from Sept 5, 1849 - Oct 14, 1863.\n\nRef: 1.
