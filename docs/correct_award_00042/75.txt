Robert Hofstadter won the 1961 Nobel prize in physics for his pioneering work in scattering 20 -GeV electrons from nuclei. (a) What is the $\gamma$ factor for a 20 -GeV electron, where $\gamma=\left(1-v^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{-1 / 2}$ ? What is the momentum of the electron in $\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ ? (b) What is the wavelength of a 20 -GeV electron and how does it compare with the size of a nucleus?
