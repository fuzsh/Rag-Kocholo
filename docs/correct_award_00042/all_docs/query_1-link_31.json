        "text": "Count Bernadotte, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen and students. I must admit that in this distinguished audience I feel very much like a student myself. But it is a great pleasure to be here and to be able to talk to you. I want to talk today about a problem in which man has been interested for a long time, namely the composition of matter. Now Professor Bohr has already in his general remarks foreshadowed many of the things that I want to say. Men have tried to understand for a very long time what matter is made of. And Rutherford and Bohr and many others have given us a beautiful picture of the atom. And in recent years one has been getting a picture of the nucleus which lies at the centre of the atom. But I don't want to talk about either of those subjects today. I would like to talk about what lies inside the nucleus, namely the individual protons and neutrons. Now of course you will see from what I say that this is a very difficult problem and we are really no where near a final answer. Perhaps the modest contribution in the words of Professor Bohr that we have made is to show that the subject is complicated. In other words that the proton and the neutron are probably some kinds of world in themselves. And we are only at the beginning of an understanding of what they are really made of. Some of the things that I have just mentioned I will try to illustrate now in my talk. The plan of my talk is to give you a kind of a general outline and try to present the main ideas first. The main ideas are really very few in number and so I would like to try to suggest them to you. And then I will show you a series of slides which I hope will illustrate the points I am going to make at first. So that is the general procedure I plan to take. Unfortunately the black board which I should like to use is very small so I will just sketch a few things there and fortunately I have some of the formulas reproduced on slides so that you'll be able to see them more easily. I wonder if I may ask for the lights, thank you. Now the general method that is used is really just an extension of older methods. And the method is related very much to the idea of electron diffractions, say in molecules. One uses a high energy machine which is a source of electrons, in this case a linear accelerator. This is the work at Stanford that I'm going to report on. The beam of the electrons is in a sense diffracted by the proton or neutron. And it is that the beam of electrons is as we say scattered. And for example if one has an electron beam coming this way, let us say with energy E and is scattered by a nucleon of some finite size, let us say a proton or a neutron, then it is deviated and is scattered. And we call this the angle of scatter. Now you tell about what is in this body by the angle of distribution of the scattered electrons, in other words you put a measuring instrument here and you measure how many electrons, let's say energy e', are scattered into this spectrometer. And then you move this spectrometer around and find the angle of distribution. This is the standard method of setting small objects. It turns out that this energy and this energy are related by something very close to the usual Compton formula so that e' over e form an elastic collision in which this body is not disturbed, it's not broken off. It is given by this expression, you will see this again on the slide where m is the mass of the struck nucleon. So in elastic collision some of the energy is given to the projected nucleon and the other energy stays with the electron. With this spectrometer you select the energy. You select the electron for this energy so that you know they will elastically scatter. Now if you then arrange to do this properly you will get an angle of distribution. Using the Dirac theory and the usual ideas about quantum electrodynamics, Mott, quite a long time ago developed a formula for the scattering process. And the cross section, d/sigma, d/omega, which represents the intensity of the...(inaudible 7:16) angle, was shown by Mott to be given by a formula like this. The important thing about this formula is that it was developed for a point charge. The point charge was assumed to have no magnetic moment. So that it's simply an electrical point charge. The electron which is being scattered does have a magnetic moment and a spin and that is all included in this Mott formula. This is a familiar formula really, this is a relative factor and this is introduced by relativity and by spin. If the object - let us say the object is still an electrical one, if it's still an electrical one, then it can be shown that if the object has some finite size or has some component structure inside it, you can represent that structure by multiplying this cross section by what we call a form factor. At this form factor you multiple the square of the form factor. This quantity Q is the momentum transfer that you have. This is a finite representation of a scattered process. Here you have an electron and here you have a nucleon and there is a transfer here of a proton, a virtual proton with momentum Q. Q is actually given by this very important quantity, by this fraction. This gives you a simple idea of what is happening. In other words if you have not a point, but you have a finite structure then you reduce the cross section by this quantity, S^2. And this is the form factor which gives you the fraction structure that you see for example in molecules, it is the same type of quantity that shows up in say the formula for diffraction from slits in optics. Alright now I've introduced most of these quantities that I need, there is only one other thing to say here. By the way, if I call the quantity ...(inaudible 10:00), this will allow me to keep the next formula simple. Now within ... (inaudible 10:12) complexity in the problem. The proton is well known as an...(inaudible 10:16) moment? It is not something that is elaborately sharp... (inaudible 10:20). Now how do you take this into account? In other words the meaning is that the proton has in it some kind of magnetism which is also able to scatter the electron. Not only does the simple Coulomb force scatter electron, but the magnetic moment. And the distribution at magnetic moment inside the proton accounts for the scattering process. So when you describe the proton you have to describe it in terms of so to speak its electrical behaviour and its magnetic behaviour. Now it's a little more complicated than that. In the Feynman diagram that I drew, the proton is described not by one form factor but by two form factors. At one and at two, this is called the Dirac form factor and this is called the Pauli form factor. The first one is kind of an electrical form factor and this one is a magnetic form factor. This refers to the distribution of an ...magnetic momentum proton. The proton as is well known, a magnetic momentum, the nuclear magneton given by a Dirac part and a Pauli part. And this describes how this moment behaves as a function of momentum transfer and this describes how that behaves. This... (inaudible 12.07), since it has a value of 1.79 for the proton and it has minus 1.91 value for the neutron. In the case of the neutron there is a zero here, static value you might say is zero. Now you notice that at this point, at this vertex where the electron turns the corner, I have not indicated any form factor at this time. Now it may very well be that there is some form factor there. In a way that would indicate some break down in electrodynamics or some change in the way calculation should be performed. As far as anybody knows and the latest experiments on the G minus 2 value over mu meson all these things support the idea that this electron vertex should just have a form factor of unity. At least as far as the small distances are concerned in this problem or at least when you consider, When you stay within the range of ...(inaudible 13.18) we are talking about. So I will assume that the electron behaviour is perfectly normal and goes with, you might say an infinitely small distribution of electricity and magnetism. But on the other hand the proton is thought to have a distribution both of its electrical charge and its magnetic moment. Now by standard methods you can show that the cross section which is really an extension of Mott formula, is given by the quantity which I had before sigma ms times. I think this is in the way. This isn't very important because you will see it on the slide but I simply wanted to indicate, I know you can't see this. You'll see it on the slide. Alright I simply want to point out that both F1 and F2 are contained in this expression. And further more that the cross section is a quadratic form containing F1 and F2. So that for example if you measure this cross section and you make a plot in the F1, F2 plain, then you will get an elliptical ark, something like that because it turns out to be an ellipse. According to the ideas of quantum electrodynamics, these quantities which describe the structure of the proton are thought to be functions only of the invariantal meson transfer Q. If you use that idea then you can find F1 and F2 quite simply because if you measure the cross section at two values on the energy available but both corresponding to the same value of Q, then you can get another ellipse and this time the intersection will be a corresponding value of F1 and F2. That is the method essentially that has been used. There are equivalent methods, you could plot this as a function of tangent square Theta over two and then by, if you look at this hard enough you will see that by looking at the slope and the intercept you can again find the values of F1 and F2. Now both of these methods are equivalent and actually I will show that the results are obtained by both methods. Alright now suppose, by the way this is a formula called Rosenbluth formula and it was developed in 1950. Now suppose, very well, suppose I use this and suppose I find the form factors F1 and F2 for the proton. And let us say I go on by methods that I will describe to you in a little while, and find the corresponding F1 and F2 for the neutron, suppose I do this. And suppose I end up with four functions which describe the proton and the neutron, f1, let's say f1p, f2p, f1n and f2n. These will be the proton form factors and these will be the neutron form factors. And all of these will be functions of the momentum transfer Q. Now in a way that will be an answer to the problem because those are phenomenological descriptions of the proton and the neutron. And I won't bore you with the details but it turns out that you can use those functions in almost all cases that are known where you have problems that involve the proton and the neutron. In other words you don't have to have a picture, a model in other words of the proton and the neutron. It's sufficient to have these phenomenological form factors. That is of course one way of looking at the problem and you can say that as soon as you determine these four functions you're finished, at least the experiment is finished. Of course in some way you want to find an explanation of why these behave in the way they do. I mean as you will see later if you plot Q^2 this way, lets say F1 looks like this and F2 looks like that and there will be corresponding plots for the neutron. Why do they look this way. And of course there are always physicists who will ask the question but I do want to, physicists who will ask the question well what do the proton and neutron look like at least in qualitative form, in the quantitative model. Now some of the answers to those questions can be given although for relativistic reasons the idea of using a model is not a correct idea. However it may be that heuristically to some new ideas about the understanding of the proton and perhaps for that reason it's worth thinking about. But in any case one would like an explanation of the behaviour of these form factors. I'm not a theoretical physicist so I'm not going to be able to give you an airtight description of the theory from this point on. But I would like to give you an experimentalist's view of this theoretical problem. Now the theoreticians prefer to talk not about F1 and F2 or the corresponding ones shown here, but they prefer to talk about linear combinations of the form factors. For example they like to talk about a scalar form factor which is F1 PE plus F1N divided by two. And they like to talk about vector form factors which would be F1 PE minus F1N over two. And there are corresponding ways to find form factors in the case of the magnetic distributions. Now they have easier ways of talking about F1S and F1 and about these quantities themselves because they think of the nucleon as merely one kind of body with two orientations in isotopic spin space which correspond then to the proton and neutron. This is similar to the ideas about ordinary spin. Let us take this one for example, F1V. Now the dispersion theory indicates and I believe that there are other ways of getting the same result. In fact this result has some, even some intuitive appeal. When you look at the Feynman diagram which I drew already, this being the proton or neutron. The dispersion theory experts write this form factor typically as an integral over a certain function called the strength functions. Where M is a parameter ..., which refers to the total momentum for energy transferred by the virtual photon in its interaction with the nucleon. This integral was carried from twice the mass of Pi meson^2, this is the first thing that can happen, to infinity. And this strength function describes how strong that particular interaction is for any value of the momentum transfer. Or for the virtual process that occurs. This even has some kind of intuitive understanding to it because if you transfer proton with rest mass, with a value of rest mass not zero, you will have a denominator of this kind, this is know as the propagator. If the mass is zero the propagator is 1 over 2^2. And if ... is 1 over 2^2 plus n^2. So this has some kind of a significance which finally ends up in giving a form factor as a function of 2 ...over M and M disappears and you have this as a factor of Q. The interesting thing is this. Of course if G, if this strength function has any form whatsoever you can't tell much about the problem. But usually there are all the same kinds of simplifications that give the first approximation to the problem. And you can see more approximation in this case. If this G function turned out to be a delta function, in other words a sharp P, a certain value of M you could take this out of the integral and you would get simple results of a form 1 over 2^2 plus whatever appropriate value corresponding to that resonance. Then it would never be that simple, there will always be, if you plot G, let's say against 10^2, there may be a reference here but actually there'll always be some kind of a tail or some kind of a pre-structure in here. So the first idea is simple to say, let's imagine this is a delta function and you approximate all the rest of this intervall some constant. Now if you do that you get a result that looks like this. You get this little formula that looks like that. And this is the Clementel-Villi form factor. And we have been using this Clementel-Villi form factor for years in trying to understand the shape of our form factor curves. We had no understanding of why we were doing this. And now with using these ideas and using the fact that in fact resonances have been discovered just in this nature, one has at least a kind of rough approximation to the answer. Now these resonances are known and have been discovered in the last year or two. The Rho resonance and the Omega resonance. This one corresponds by about 780 MeV and this one about 750 MeV. And this corresponds to roughly speaking a combination of three Pi mesons in some kind of excited state. And this corresponds to two Pi mesons. This one is very nearly like the... function this one is more spread out but still fairly sharp. So therefore there seems to be some ready made kind of explanation for this formula. However I emphasise that these ideas are only in a primitive state now. And we cannot yet see all the implications that are involved. For example if we investigate our form factors and use the two known values of the resonances that have been found and are known to apply to this problem, they have the right quantum numbers in other words. We can't get a reproduction of our form factors, but if you modify the values of these masses slightly you can get a very good description. Now how can you modify the values if they're given by nature. Well the point is that, maybe the point is that if you want to make a simple assumption that they were delta functions, but in actuality as Professor Heisenberg has already pointed out, these tails may contribute to the problem. And I understand in some recent calculations of Wong and Paul at La Jolla in California show that in fact the effective values are reduced by about, just about the proper amount to account for the experimental results. I don't want to go through all details, this isn't the proper place for it. But I have tried to give you a little bit of a picture of the theory. Now if you want to talk in terms of models only to get some kind of an idea of what a proton and neutron would look like, let's say in ...clouds where the model ideas may not be too bad. One can make a Fourrier inversion of the form factors. In a well known way to get the charge distributions. And I will show a slide to that effect towards the end. There is one other thing I would like to say. At the very end of my talk I will show some quite new data which have not been analysed as yet. Well they have been analysed but only very approximately. And this represents I think a new approach to the problem which may be of considerable help to us. In the case of the deuteron, well let me say, when you study the neutron you don't have a target where you have free neutrons. You can't get following neutrons. So you have to use the neutrons by moving around inside the deuteron. And there is a theory for the deuteron. Now it turns out that the theory is pretty good for deuteron. And the part of it that you have to use is really quite good in these studies. Nevertheless the neutron is a bound particle and it's not the same as a free particle, such as the proton. The question comes up then suppose if you perform the same kind of experiment that you do in the case of a free proton on either the proton or the neutron when they're bound inside the deuteron. Will you get the same form factors. In other words here I have a free proton and here I have a proton inside the deuteron. Now I perform similar experiments, will I get from the second step the same formula as I did from the first step. Well the way in which you can perform the experiment is to take an electron beam and here you have a deuteron consisting of a proton and neutron. And let the electrons scatter this way and pick up the proton in coincidence with the electron. And then you know you have a particular event in which the electron has struck the proton except for exchang... and you're collecting the two at the same time so you know you've dealt with a very primitive type of phenomenon in the deuteron. Now we have done such experiments, have just designed the experiments and looking at the deuteron in very close detail. One would also like to do these experiments by taking the electron and looking at the neutron, too, and that's a very difficult thing to do. At least with our apparatus because of our... Now I will show you some of these results at the end of my talk. And an explanation of the results would take me too long .... So I think now I'll try to go rapidly through a number of slides which will illustrate the things that I have been talking about. May I have the first slide please. Now you can see on a large scale the Feynman diagram that I was drawing before. This is the electron line and this is the proton line or it could be a neutron. And this is the expression that comes into the real calculation that you must make. This is F1 and this is F2. May I have the next slide please. Now this is a diagram, a Feynman diagram which shows a particular interaction in which the Rho mesons, the Omega meson is produced virtually and this corresponds to one of the, it corresponds to the Delta function I drew in the strength function plot. This is just typical, you could have two lines here and have the Rho meson. May I have the next slide please. Now here is the Rosenbluth scattering formula, I hope you can see it better than on the blackboard, all the figures are very much bigger. Here is the momentum transfer, this shows the values for the proton. And you can also apply this formula to helium three. And we have done experiments on helium three. I cannot describe them here in which you see the distribution of magnetism in helium three and the distribution of electricity in helium three. And they are both different. And these are very interesting results and again I haven't the time to talk about them here but I can discuss them in private. May I have the next slide. Now this is just a simple diagram of the apparatus and shows that you have the beam coming in. You strike the target here which can be liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium or it could be polyethylene containing hydrogen and carbon. And you have two spectrometers, one here and one here. A large one and a small one. And you can pick out scattered electrons going into this spectrometer. And for example protons going into this spectrometer. You can do the two coincidence. And this is how the coincidence experiments were done. Now the next slide please. This gives you an idea of the order of magnitude of the apparatus. Unfortunately it is big and clumsy and hard to handle. This is one of the spectrometers. And it weighs about 200 tons. It contains here a shield weighing about 40 tones. And inside this shield is a detector. In fact there are a number of detectors in there and I'll show you a picture of them in a moment. Here is the smaller spectrometer, this weighs about 30 tones with a heavy shield up here too. And here is the target. The electron beam comes from a long distance in front of this machine. This is a Faraday cup. It's different from the usual Faraday cup since it weighs about 10 tones. This spectrometer and this spectrometer both rotate around this, on this rail, independently. May I have the next slide please. This one is upside down I'm afraid but it's alright, if you think of it just turned around, this is the liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium target. And this is where the hydrogen goes for example, this is where the deuterium goes. Now when you put this, you see there are very thin walls here. They're one ml of stainless steel, the walls in this target. And when you put the chamber in the vacuum and have the liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium in these target vessels the walls bulge. And it's fairly difficult matter to measure the thickness and so we have put a wire on here which hangs down. Let me turn this around. And you can site on the position of the wire by optical means and find the thickness of the target. This has turned out to be a rather difficult problem, it's a simple thing but it's hard to do. But anyway we have done it optically so far and we're trying to develop a mechanical method of doing this at low temperatures. That's what makes it complicated, it's in a vacuum at low temperatures. May I have the next slide please. Now this is the detector, this is a multi channel detector. In most of our earlier work we just used one counter, but now you see we're using ten. There are ten counters here and ten photomultipliers. So you get ten pieces of data at once. And this gives us a great difference in the potential accuracy of our results. We have not yet gotten the full accuracy but we're on the way. And it's possible for us to think of a 100 channels by using semi conductor type detectors but we haven't done this yet. May I have the next slide please. Now this is a sample of old data showing a hydrogen peak which one obtained for a polyethylene target. Here is the hydrogen peak, it's a polyethylene peak but it contains hydrogen and carbon. And this is a background study made with carbon. And from the difference you can get the hydrogen area and you get the hydrogen cross section. Now may I have the next slide please. Now this is a sample of our new results. And you see our background is almost zero. In fact the background here is coming in a large part from the wire that we put on, it just so happens that we put a thick wire on by mistake instead of a thin wire. And so about half of this background was due to the wire and the other half was due to the steel walls. But you see now you can see this tail quite well and so you have a nice idea of what a proton peak looks like. Now this should enable us to get the results at much higher accuracy than we've had before. But as I say we're only beginning these studies now and I can't show you any real final results...(end)."
