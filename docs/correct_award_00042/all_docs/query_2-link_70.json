        "text": "Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 (together with A. Aspect and J. Clauser)\n\nAnton Zeilinger received a doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1971 for his work on \"Neutron Depolarization in Dysprosium Single Crystals\" under the supervision of Helmut Rauch. From 1974 to 1989, he worked half-time as a visiting scientist at the ILL, performing various experiments to test fundamental predictions of quantum mechanics. Here, Rauch and Zeilinger successfully achieved a direct observation of fermion spin superposition, measured at the neutron interferometry station S18. During the same period, they also demonstrated the sign change of the wave function of fermions under rotations of 360 degrees. These outstanding experiments marked the beginning of a long series of quantum experiments at the instrument S18 up to the present day.\n\nAfter spending some time as a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Anton Zeilinger held positions at TU Wien (Austria), TU München (Germany) and the University of Innsbruck (Austria). During this period, he applied the concept of neutron interferometry to very cold neutrons, aiming to gain greater sensitivity due to a much longer wavelength, and to take advantage of different systematic effects compared to the perfect crystal neutron interferometry at S18. These experiments were conducted at the ultra-cold and very cold neutron facility PF2. For them, the beamline PF2/VCN was entirely rebuilt and equipped. The activity led to a precise measurement of the gravitational phase shift of neutron wave packets, and the experimental demonstration of the Scalar Neutron Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n\nAnton Zeilinger’s research then turned towards experiments using mainly photons. The list of scientific highlights is long, ranging from the demonstration of the quantum teleportation of a photon, the development of techniques for quantum entanglement and the teleportation of quantum states to important contributions to quantum information technology and quantum cryptography, as well as matter wave interferometry experiments similar to the ones with neutrons, but using atoms and even bucky balls.\n\nThe neutron work of Anton Zeilinger is also described here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Zeilinger#Neutron_interferometry>;\n\n1- Van Der Zouw G., Weber M., Felber J., Gähler R., Geltenbort P., Zeilinger A. \"Aharonov-Bohm and gravity experiments with the very-cold-neutron interferometer\" (2000) Nucl.

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.40.416\n\nNobel Prize in Physics 1994 (shared with B.N. Brockhouse)\n\nClifford Glenwood Shull was awarded the Nobel Prize, together with Bertram Brockhouse, for his pioneering work on the development of neutron scattering at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, long before the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) came into being. Shull's main collaboration with the ILL was in the years 1982 to 1988. Quantum mechanical predictions for matter-wave diffraction are extremely important for physics as a whole. Shull was therefore closely involved in a series of highly accurate diffraction experiments using very cold neutrons (VCN) and the comparison of the results achieved with theoretical predictions. The measurements were performed on beam H18 at the ILL and they confirmed the accuracy of the predictions [1].\n\nHis co-author, Roland Gähler, remembers him as \"the most impressive experimenter I ever met. He gave the impression of having an infinite amount of time for measuring everything, and by taking his time he was finally quicker than all the others, because he had to do everything only once.\" [2]\n\nNobel Prize in Physics 1992\n\nGeorges Charpak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the multiwire proportional chamber, making several important discoveries in particle physics possible, in particular the observation of the W and Z bosons. A MWPC operates in proportional mode. At the same time, a CEA-CENG (DN and LETI) team was developing a Multi Wire Counter which operated in ionization mode. This detector performed less well than the MWPC, in particular the detection efficiency and count rate capability were lower. In the early stages of this development work (in the 1970s), the ILL and LETI (CEA-CENG) teams therefore collaborated with Charpak on the MWPC [1]. For about ten years, Charpak also acted as an expert for the ILL for neutron detector projects.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics 1991\n\nOne of the great achievements of Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (University of Orsay, France) is his famous “reptation” model [1], which describes the serpentine motion of a polymer chain within a “tangle” of surrounding polymer chains. The first experimental confirmation of this model came in 1990 from neutron spin-echo (NSE) experiments on the ILL instrument IN11 [2]. This is because the reptation motion of long molecules is so slow that, at that time, only NSE spectrometry was capable of observing it. Later on, on the basis of NSE observations of the motion of a single molecule within a polymer melt [3], the initial model was further refined to better account for the mechanisms limiting the topological chain confinement in polymer melts.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics 1989 (shared with N.F. Ramsey and H.G. Dehmelt)\n\nWolfgang Paul (University of Bonn and CERN) won the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physics (jointly with Norman Ramsey) for inventing the so-called \"Paul traps\" or \"ion traps\" based on the use of a quadrupole electric field to store charged particles in a small volume.\n\nPaul had the idea to extend his trap to the neutron, which is electrically neutral but has a magnetic dipole moment. His work can be summarised as follows [1]:\n\n\"In this case, sextupole rather than quadrupole fields were needed to act on the magnetic moment of the neutron. He built such a trap, NESTOR [2], which was installed in a neutron beam at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble. Paul, and a small team from Bonn, which included his two sons Stephan and Lorenz, both physicists, carried out a precision measurement of the lifetime of free propagating neutrons [3,4] and determined its gravitational mass by seeing the neutrons fall inside the trap. Knowing the exact neutron lifetime is relevant to particle physics, in particular to precision tests of the Standard Model, as well as in astrophysics, because it governs the near equilibrium of protons and neutrons in the primordial phase of nucleosynthesis. The experiment was carried out in 1989 and resulted in the most precise measurement of the lifetime of the neutron at this time.\"\n\nSuperSUN, a new Ultra Cold Neutron (UCN) source, is being built (2022) at the ILL which makes use of a sextupole magnetic trap inherited from the pioneering work of Wolgang Paul and his collaborators.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics 1989 (shared with W. Paul and H.G. Dehmelt)\n\nNorman Ramsey collaborated with the ILL from 1973 to about 1990. Together with his collaborators, he did some impressive work using the high neutron flux provided by the ILL's reactor, and this played a major role in the success and development of experiments with cold and ultracold neutrons (UCN) at the RHF. Historically, Ramsey experiments with neutrons began at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They were moved to the ILL to take advantage of the higher fluxes available at the ILL: the H18 beam tube, PN5 (IH3 beam tube), the first ILL UCN source and then the even more powerful “Steyerl turbine\" (PF2). A famous aspect of Ramsey's work is the search for a neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM), which still represents one of the main applications of the famous “Ramsey technique” (separated oscillatory field method) for which he obtained the Nobel Prize in 1989. A non-vanishing value of the nEDM would violate time-reversal invariance and this would help to understand the apparent matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. The search for a neutron electric dipole moment still continues today with, for example, the panEDM experiment which is currently being built on SuperSUN, an advanced new UCN source. Ramsey and his collaborators also measured the neutron magnetic moment with great accuracy and this is very important for all the neutron physics and techniques where magnetism is involved. Ramsey's contribution to the observation of parity non-conserving neutron spin rotation is another example of the wide spectrum of fundamental physics experiments in which he was involved.\n\n----\n\nTwo of Ramsey's collaborators (Geoffrey Greene and Bob Golub) gave us a their recollection of the work with him at the ILL.\n\nTwo of Ramsey's PhD students were awarded prestigious prizes for work which included research conducted during their time at the ILL.\n\n2020 - Geoffrey Greene was awarded the prestigious Bonner Prize by the APS. \"Geoff Greene’s lifetime is inextricably linked to that of the neutron.\" He worked at the ILL with Ramsey from 1975 (magnetic moment of the neutron, search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron). In the mid-eighties, he collaborated (as member of the NIST group around Dick Deslattes) with H. Bőrner, E. Kessler and S. Dewey on the installation at the ILL and first measurements with the double crystal spectrometer GAMS4 (now decommissioned). He stopped active participation in research at the ILL in 1995.\n\n2021 - Blayne Heckel was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. He worked at the ILL with Ramsey from 1980 to 1983 on the instrument S43 (H142 neutron guide) and collaborated with the ILL until 2014.\n\n1- Ramsey N.F. \"Electric dipole moment of the neutron\" (1990) Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science 40, 1-14.

Hofstadter); Röntgen prize 1961\n\nRudolf Ludwig Mössbauer is best known for his 1957 discovery of recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence, the so-called \"Mössbauer effect\", the basis for Mössbauer spectroscopy, which is unique in its sensitivity to subtle changes in the chemical environment of certain nuclei in solids.\n\nHe was the ILL Director from 1972 to 1977 but afterwards was involved in particle physics experiments. For example, he was part of the team that first measured a negative deviation of the reactor antineutrino production rate [1] now known as \"the reactor antineutrino anomaly\". The study of the latter culminated almost 4 decades later in the search for a sterile neutrino with the STEREO experiment at the ILL [2]. Mössbauer was also involved in the search for the axion [3], a search which still continues today at the ILL and in other labs."
