        "text": "Robert Hofstadter\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1961\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for his pioneering studies of electron scattering in atomic nuclei and for his thereby achieved discoveries concerning the structure of the nucleons”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nWork\n\nMatter is composed of atoms with small nuclei surrounded by electrons. Robert Hofstadter developed apparatus for studying nuclei’s internal structure. A high-energy electron beam from an accelerator was directed towards nuclei and by examining the scattering of the electrons, he could investigate how charges were distributed. He could also investigate how the magnetic moment within the nuclei’s protons and neutrons was distributed. Nuclei were thereby proven not to be homogeneous, but to have internal structures."
