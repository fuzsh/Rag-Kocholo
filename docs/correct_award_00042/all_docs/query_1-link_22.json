He is also known for his accurate prediction of two types of meson, which are subatomic particles consisting of one quark and one antiquark: the omega-meson and the rho-meson.⁠\n⁠\nHofstadter contributed to the development of nuclear medicine, specifically the use of gamma ray spectroscopy techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET). These medical imaging techniques are used for the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer as well as neurological conditions. He created a thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector, for which he filed a patent in 1948. This type of detector remains a popular tool for gamma ray spectroscopy to this day.\".",
