        "text": "STARK, Johannes, German physicist, * 15.4.1874 Schickenhof, in Thansüß, district of Amberg, † 21.6.1957 Traunstein. S. became a professor in Hannover; in 1909 he went to Aachen, in 1917, to Greifswald and in 1920, to Würzburg. He founded the “Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik” in 1904 and discovered in 1905 the (optical) Doppler effect in so-called channel rays and in 1913 the Stark effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1919. In 1933 he became the president of the “Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft”. He was a friend of P. Lenard and a supporter of “German physics”; thus he dismissed quantum theory and the theory of relativity as “the product of Jewish thinking”.\n\nHOFSTADTER, Robert, American physicist, * 5.2.1915 New York. H. is a professor at Stanford University, California. He has considered problems of molecular structure and has contributed to the development of scintillation and crystal counters. H. proved that the proton and the neutron have a finite extension and structure. By examining electron scattering by atomic nuclei he succeeded in finding the charge distribution not only for the proton and neutron, but also systematically for many other nuclei of the Periodic System. For this research, H. was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, together with R. Mössbauer.\n\nBRIX, Peter, German physicist, * 20.10.1918 Kappeln/Schlei. B. was a professor from 1957 to 1973 in Darmstadt, then director at the Max-Planck-Institute für Kernphysik in Heidelberg. Together with Kopfermann, he examined the isotope shift and built the first German electron linear accelerator in Darmstadt with which he and his colleagues measured accurately the charge distribution of atomic nuclei."
