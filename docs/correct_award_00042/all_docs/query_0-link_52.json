        "text": "Richard E. Taylor, a Canadian-born experimental physicist who shared the 1990 Nobel Prize for the discovery of quarks, one of the fundamental particles in the universe, died on Feb. 22 in Stanford, Calif. He was 88.\n\nStanford University, where he worked, announced his death but did not cite a cause.\n\nThe discovery of quarks, in the late 1960s, was a ground-shaking event in physics. It paved the way for the development of the Standard Model, the classification system for all known elementary particles and forces.\n\nBefore their discovery, “we had this vast collection of particles and did not know how they were put together,” Martin Breidenbach, a professor of high-energy research at Stanford, told The Stanford News. Among these were composite particles called hadrons.\n\nThe Standard Model that resulted, he said, “was a way of basing all the hadronic particles we knew about, including protons and neutrons, on more fundamental particles called quarks, and once that was clear, this whole big mess fell away.”\n\nThe discovery of quarks was unexpected, though the experiments by Dr. Taylor and others that revealed them were built on previous research, particularly that of Dr. Robert Hofstadter, another Stanford physicist and Nobel laureate.\n\nDr. Hofstadter’s research, like that of physicists before and since, was designed to explore the inner workings and architecture of the subatomic world, which had first been revealed by Ernest Rutherford in the early 20th century.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
