        "text": "Congratulations to Professor Sue O'Connor, who has been elected as an International Fellow of The British Academy üëè Professor O'Connor has been recognised for her contribution to the humanities and social sciences. Her career as an archaeologist has taken her across the world, from the misty moors of Cornwall to the Buccaneer Archipelago in the Kimberley. Read more here: https://brnw.ch/21wLnbZ\n\nWe all know someone like this in the ANU community ‚Äî an extraordinary individual who somehow makes the impossible feel possible. Who is creative, passionate, and inspiring in more ways than one. If you have found yourself nodding or pausing to reflect on a person who immediately comes to mind, we want to hear from you. Whether it‚Äôs a friend, family member or colleague, nominate someone exceptional for a 2025 ANU Alumni Awards and shine a light on their stories and work. Self-nominations are welcome too, because sometimes that extraordinary someone might just be you. üëè Nominations close at midnight on Saturday 31 August 2024. Click the link below for the details: https://lnkd.in/gjMjcEKA\n\nAnyone who has watched Parliamentary Question Time knows it‚Äôs not for the faint-hearted. But is the robust debate undermining efforts to change the culture? ü§î In their new book Toxic Parliaments, launching today, Marian Sawer and Maria Maley argue that the long-standing Westminster tradition of adversarial chambers runs counter to efforts to make our parliaments more diverse. Read an excerpt here: https://brnw.ch/21wLkJk\n\n'Our DNA. Our people. Our stories. Our way.' The ANU NCIG (National Centre for Indigenous Genomics) harnesses the science of DNA to improve the health and well-being of Australia's First Peoples. üëè The centre's mission is far from easy and it takes a remarkable team to make it possible. For the past five years, former Chair and Associate Professor Glenn Pearson has steered NCIG. Now, the centre is looking for an Indigenous Australian leader to guide transformative projects and safeguard Indigenous genomic data.

The alliance will advocate for the major economic reform laid out in the landmark Murru Waaruu Outcomes Report - informed by consultation with First Nations leaders and experts, industry and government officials. ‚ÄúAt its simplest, the report calls for a new fiscal relationship with First Peoples, one based on Indigenous wealth creation, not welfare,‚Äù says Professor Peter Yu, Vice President (First Nations). ‚ÄúWe have before us an important opportunity to deliver, for the first time in Australia, an effective national Indigenous economic empowerment strategy that involves Indigenous communities as economic partners in our national economy.\" National Native Title Council First Australians Capital Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation Read more üîΩ https://lnkd.in/gJ_QHTqb\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited by the talent that‚Äôs here at ANU. As a senior leader in the sector, it‚Äôs about enabling the levers and institutional conditions so great people can do great work.‚Äù Professor Rebekah Brown joins ANU as Provost and Senior Vice-President after more than a decade in academic leadership at Monash University. As Provost, she oversees the University's academic mission, including advancing research and teaching. \"The close relationship with government and the close relationship with the community means ANU has opportunities to have a significant impact,\" Professor Brown says. \"And I wanted to be part of that.\" Read more about Professor Brown here: https://lnkd.in/g6tVRxyw\n\nIn line with the 2024 NAIDOC Week theme of ‚ÄòKeep The Fire Burning! Blak, Loud and Proud,‚Äô the ANU community recently came together for a powerful tree scarring ceremony performed by Paul Girrawah House. House, a Ngambri and Ngunnawal custodian, welcomed everyone onto Country with a smoking ceremony. Then, as the winter sun peered through the trees and the local birds danced around the smoke, the carefully selected tree was slowly transformed as part of a reclamation of Ngambri (Kamberri) Country for First Nations peoples. For those who missed the ceremony, we recommend walking down to the International Sculpture Garden on campus to get a better look at this special tree.\n\nAnd just like that, we have our 2024 graduates. üëèüéì 2,337 graduates walked across the stage this week, supported by proud family members, friends and pets. We wish our grads all the best for this next, new exciting chapter of life. Congratulations everyone!\n\nThe ANU Reconciliation Lecture is about fostering meaningful dialogue and addressing critical issues affecting Indigenous communities. We are pleased to share that Ms Selina Walker, a Ngunnawal woman, emerging elder, and proud granddaughter of Senior Ngunnawal Elder Aunty Agnes Shea OAM, will give this year's address. Selina was awarded the ACT Barnardos Mother of the Year in 2017 and the ACT Australian of the Year Local Hero this year for her dedication in supporting ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We look forward to seeing you there! If not now, when? üìÖ Thursday 18 July, 4pm üìå Superfloor, Marie Reay Teaching Centre, Kambri üéüÔ∏è Register here: https://brnw.ch/21wLebc\n\n‚ÄúMy curiosity for knowledge, fuelled by my experiences of poverty and disability, led me to delve into policy framing, evidence-based decision-making, and global governance.‚Äù For Upul Sanjaya Weerasinghe, the road to obtaining his Master of Public Policy at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy has been far from easy. Growing up in a rural village in Sri Lanka, Sanjaya had to trek through 10 kilometres of rugged terrain to attend school. This experience became more challenging when, in his youth, he started to lose his vision. The support of his younger brother Dhanushka has been integral to his education journey. Now, Sanjaya is on a mission to give back to his community and help break down barriers to inspire meaningful change. Please join us in congratulating Sanjaya on his graduation!
