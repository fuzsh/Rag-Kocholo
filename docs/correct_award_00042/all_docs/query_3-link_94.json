        "text": "Abstract:Non-invasive angiography is provided through use of monochromatized synchrotron radiation in a dichromographic procedure. A small quantity of an iodinated compound is introduced into the blood stream of a patient. An X-ray picture of a blood vessel such as the coronary artery can be produced by directing synchrotron radiation from a storage ring source at first and second selected wavelengths or energy levels through the blood vessel, detecting the attenuated radiation to obtain first and second signals representative of the attenuated radiation, and logarithmically subtracting the two signals to essentially eliminate all background contrast. Due to the K-absorption edge of iodine the resulting signal will emphasize the blood vessel containing the iodine. Abstract:A new high Z scintillator capable of generating light radiation upon exposure to nuclear radiation such as gamma rays, beta rays, protons, mesons, X-rays, etc. wherein said scintillator is transparent to said light radiation and consists of a major amount of thallium chloride and a minor amount of an iodide containing compound."
