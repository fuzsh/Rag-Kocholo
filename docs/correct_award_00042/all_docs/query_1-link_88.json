Aside from some physical similarities (glasses and squinting eyes) I haven't found them similar at all.\n\nLeonard and Sheldon are named (but maybe not character insipred?) after Nobel Prize winners Robert Hofstadter (1961 in Physics with one other scientist) and Leon Cooper (1972 in Physics with two other scientists).\n\nWell there are enough similarities between Seinfeld and The Bing Bang Theories that somebody already has compared them.\n\nhttps://suggestsmagic.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/big-bang-theory-is-a-seinfeld-copycat/\n\nBoth George and Leonard share more features that just the looks: they both are obsessive, specially with details, not confident about themselves, they both get frustrated quite fast, had issues keeping steady relationships, even certain body language gestures are quite similar.\n\nBut to be honest there is no way to know if someone borrowed George features and characteristics in order to create Leonard, even if the writers were asked because they will never accept it if it was the case."
