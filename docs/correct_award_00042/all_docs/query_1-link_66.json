        "text": "2023\n\nPierre Agostini | Ferenc Krausz | Anne L'Huillier\n\n“For experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.”\n\nSince the late 1980s, researchers have been conducting experiments designed to track the ultrafast motion (43 miles per second) of electrons and grasp the dynamic behavior of these subatomic particles. Through their independent efforts and combined work, Agostini, Krausz and L'Huillier developed breakthrough techniques to capture, in real time, electrons' rapid movements using short pulses of light called \"attosecond pulses.\" NSF is proud to have supported Agostini's exploratory research and particle motion experiments over the course of two decades. These laureates' collective discoveries have opened another door into the world of electrons, helping to better understand the fundamental laws of physics, while paving the way for the creation of new technologies.\n\n2022\n\nAlain Aspect | John F. Clauser | Anton Zeilinger\n\n“For experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.”\n\nThe groundbreaking work of all three researchers has revealed the strange nature of quantum entanglement and paved the way to a new field of research: quantum information science. Their fundamental discoveries provided a new understanding of nature at the quantum scale and a foundation for new technologies such as quantum computers, secure communications and networks that transmit information through entanglement. NSF is proud to have supported Zeilinger's experiments demonstrating quantum entanglement as well as Aspect's collaboration with researchers in the U.S.\n\n2021\n\nSYUKURO MANABE | KLAUS HASSELMANN | GIORGIO PARISI\n\n“For the physical modelling of Earth's climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming” and “for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales.”\n\nMaking sense of systems that function from randomness and disorder is not only a challenge, but also essential for understanding some of the most important phenomena of the world. Manabe developed the first-of-its-kind general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes that paved the way for the critical work of limiting the impact of human-caused climate change. NSF is proud to have supported Manabe's research on large-scale atmospheric circulation in the early 1980s through awards at Princeton University.\n\n2020\n\nANDREA GHEZ | REINHARD GENZEL | ROGER PENROSE\n\n“For the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity” and “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.”\n\nThe Nobel Assembly has awarded half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics to Roger Penrose for his work on black hole formation and jointly awarded the other half to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for discovering the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. NSF provided support for the work of all three laureates. During a period in the early 1980s when Penrose, of the U.K., served as a professor at Rice University, NSF supported his investigations applying twistor theory to general relativity, and he was co-PI on several awards for theoretical work on classical and quantum gravity. NSF also supported Genzel in the same period, providing him a presidential young investigator award for development in infrared and submillimeter astrophysics.\n\nNSF's supported Ghez's work with several awards related to her Nobel prize. In 1994, NSF provided her with a young investigator award. Subsequently, NSF supported the projects through which Ghez developed her Nobel-winning findings about our galaxy's supermassive black hole. With NSF support and use of the NSF-funded Keck Observatory, Ghez also sustained a 24-year observation of a star orbiting the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, the most comprehensive test so far of general relativity. Ghez discussed her work in an interview with NSF.\n\n2019\n\nJAMES PEEBLES | MICHEL MAYOR | DIDIER QUELOZ\n\n“For contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth's place in the cosmos.”\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded jointly \"for contributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth's place in the cosmos,\" with one half to James Peebles \"for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\" and the other half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz \"for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\" NSF supported Peebles' work on gravitation, relativity, and cosmology with 17 awards over a 20-year span. Peebles' long career has included much theoretical work on the early universe. Some of his most cited research was conducted with the support of NSF funding.\n\n2018\n\nARTHUR ASHKIN | GÉRARD MOUROU | DONNA STRICKLAND\n\n“For their groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics.”\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physics 2018 \"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\" with one half to Arthur Ashkin \"for the optical tweezers and their application to biological systems\" and the other half jointly to Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland \"for their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.\" Laser physics is a field for which NSF investments have had significant impact. NSF made several grants to Mourou and his collaborators, including funds to support a biological physics facility at the University of Rochester and two centers at the University of Michigan, the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (originally an NSF Science and Technology Center) and the FOCUS Physics Frontier Center. NSF Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding also helped transition technology developed in Mourou's labs to commercial applications, including a transformative new approach to LASIK eye surgery.\n\n2017\n\nRAINER WEISS | KIP THORNE | BARRY BARISH\n\n“For their work detecting gravitational waves -- ripples in space and time created by the motion of massive objects in the universe.”\n\nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to Rainer Weiss of MIT and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish of Caltech. The three scientists led the development of the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), in which NSF invested $1.1 billion. The first detection occurred in September 2015, confirming one prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity, which he published more than 100 years ago, and led to the identification of large black hole binary systems. LIGO is an example of risky but potentially revolutionary science funded by NSF, as it was one of the largest experiments NSF has ever funded. Funding supported construction and operational costs for the instrument, and research awards to individual scientists studying data obtained by LIGO.\n\n2016\n\nDAVID J. THOULESS | F. DUNCAN M. HALDANE | J. MICHAEL KOSTERLITZ\n\n“For theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter.”\n\nThouless was awarded one half and Haldane and Kosterlitz shared the other half of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work at the forefront of condensed matter physics. Using topological concepts -- topology is a branch of mathematics -- they \"opened the door on an unknown world where matter can assume strange states,\" noted the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences press release. Thouless of the University of Washington has received support from NSF since the 1980s, including #02001948. Haldane of Princeton University also received multiple awards from NSF, including #9196212, and he is part of the Princeton Center for Complex Materials, a NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC). Kosterlitz of Brown University received multiple awards from NSF in the 1980s and 1990s, including #9222812.\n\n2012\n\nSERGE HAROCHE | DAVID J. WINELAND\n\n“For ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.”\n\nHaroche and Wineland were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. They independently invented and developed methods for measuring and manipulating individual particles while preserving their quantum-mechanical nature, in ways previously thought unattainable. Haroche, of the Collège de France and Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, received support from NSF as a principal investigator (PI) and co-PI in the 1980s, when he was at Yale University. Wineland, of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Colorado Boulder, was selected for a Graduate Research Fellowship in 1965.\n\n2011\n\nSAUL PERLMUTTER | BRIAN P. SCHMIDT | ADAM G. RIESS\n\n“For the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe through observations of distant supernovae.”\n\nPerlmutter of the Supernova Cosmology Project of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California, Berkeley; Schmidt of the High-z Supernova Search Team, Australian National University; and Riess of the High-z Supernova Search Team, Johns Hopkins University and Space Telescope Science Institute revolutionized our understanding of the universe. In 1998, as key members of two research teams, they presented findings that the universe is expanding at an ever-accelerating rate. The acceleration is thought to be caused by \"dark energy,\" so-called because little is known about it. NSF played a role in the foundations of the work, as numerous NSF-supported groups and instruments contributed to the discovery. NSF-funded researcher Robert Kirshner was a key player, and both Schmidt and Riess worked in his group when they were graduate students at Harvard University. Schmidt and Riess were supported by Kirshner's NSF grants during the period in the 1990s when key supernovae observations were made. Later, the Supernova Cosmology Project, led by Perlmutter, and another team--the High-z Supernova Search Team, led by Schmidt in which Riess played a major role--examined the amount of light that was being emitted by a particular type of supernova, called Type-Ia supernova, in order to determine the distance of these stars. The work of the Supernova Cosmology Project was partly supported by NSF through the Center for Astroparticle Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. The two independent teams found that the light of over 50 distant supernovae was weaker than predicted--the supernovae, still set in their galaxies, were fading as they were being pushed away at an accelerated rate. Crucial observations of supernovae were made using the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) Blanco 4-meter Telescope operated by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO), which is funded by NSF. NOAO's Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Gemini Observatory also played important roles either in the discovery phase or in follow-up observations.\n\n2008\n\nYOICHIRO NAMBU\n\n“For the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics.”\n\nNambu's theories permeate the Standard Model of elementary particle physics which unifies the smallest building blocks of all matter and three of nature's four forces in one single theory. Nambu, of the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago, received NSF support for research on theoretical elementary particle physics from the 1974 (7408833) to 1999 (9901194).\n\n2006\n\nJOHN C. MATHER | GEORGE F. SMOOT\n\n“For the discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation.”\n\nMather, of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and Smoot, of the University of California, Berkeley, shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work studying the infant Universe and contributing to a better understanding of the origin of stars and galaxies. Using the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite launched by NASA in 1989, they analyzed the cosmic microwave background radiation that is a relic of the \"Big Bang.\" The detection of extremely small variations in the temperature of the radiation offered a clue to the distribution of matter in the early Universe. An NSF-funded summer physics program following 11th grade inspired Mather to become a scientist and he received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 1968. NSF supported Smoot's research for more than 20 years.\n\n2005\n\nROY J. GLAUBER\n\n“For his contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence.”\n\nGlauber received half of the 2005 Nobel Prize in physics. His analysis of quantum effects in laser optics laid the foundations for modern applications such as quantum cryptography. NSF supported Glauber's research with several grants in the 1970s.\n\nAffiliation: Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.\n\nTHEODOR W. HÄNSCH\n\n\"For their contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique.\"\n\nThe other half of the physics prize went to John L. Hall of JILA (a research laboratory) and HÃ¤nsch for their contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique. Their work has made it possible to measure frequencies with an accuracy of fifteen digits. NSF funded HÃ¤nsch from 1977 through 1985.\n\nHÄNSCH\n\nAffiliation: Max-Planck-Institute.\n\n2004\n\nDAVID J. GROSS | H. DAVID POLITZER | FRANK WILCZEK\n\n“For the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction.”\n\nGross, Politzer and Wilczek received the prize for their work related to the strong force, which binds quarks into protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Both Wilczek and Politzer were supported by NSF graduate fellowships while they conducted their Nobel-recognized research. NSF support for Gross spans many years, beginning at Princeton University where Wilczek was his graduate student, and since the mid-1990s at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. NSF has supported the KITP since its creation in 1979 and supported Wilczek when he was a member of the KITP in the 1980s.\n\n2003\n\nANTHONY J. LEGGETT\n\n“For pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids.”\n\nLeggett was honored for his groundbreaking work in explaining the behavior of atoms in superfluids. Leggett, whose research NSF has supported over the past 20 years, formulated a theory to explain the complex superfluid behavior in the rare form of helium.
