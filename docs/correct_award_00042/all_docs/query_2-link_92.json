        "text": "==quote from AP==\n\nGerman Wins Nobel Chemistry Prize\n\n6 hours ago\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Gerhard Ertl of Germany won the 2007 Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for his studies of chemical processes on solid surfaces.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said his research helps to understand how catalysts in automobiles work, fuel cells function and even why iron rusts.\n\n==endquote==\n\nI think that US dominance in hard science Nobels (physics, chemistry) may be slipping and there may be a shift towards more European Nobels.\n\nThe US physics establishment (at least outside astrophysics) may have lost its way----there was an interesting letter by J C Philips, a physicist at Rutgers University, in the recent issue of Physics Today about this (\"American Physics Implosion\")---discussing the cultural difference between physics in Europe versus US. Losing touch with reality. Media culture.\n\nWhether that is true or not, I get the feeling that the Nobel committee may be trying to send some messages:\n\n1. physics can contribute to information technology (your hard-drive) and to saving the planet (the catalyst in your car, the catalyst in fuel cells, more efficient materials). Remember that Nobel specifically said the prize was to recognize science benefit to humanity, and I guess that could include the planet humanity depends on as well\n\n2. the European science establishment has grown a lot and knows how to do international integration (ESF, the Euopean science foundation) and has a common language (English) and is leading bigtime science in a new way---the US scientific establishment needs a kick in the pants and a little shaking up. And it is time to expect a bunch of European Nobels.\n\nOf course this is just my two cents from the peanut gallery. But I was glad that Physics went to a French-German duo and that Chemistry went to a German and I hope that betokens some kind of change.\n\nfourier jr said:\n\n...Dick Cheney should start privatizing universities & labs to get more people into science again.\n\nto get more people into massage science? (or whatever else the consumer market dictates)\n\nfundamental science is an aristocratic phenomenon, I expect, rather than a market-capital-driven---or even a weapon-driven---phenomenon.\n\nelites compete for prestige, respect, honor, and some kind of undefinable greatness (a place in history that e.g. Grisha Perlman has even though he didnt take the money)\n\n===================\n\nactually, where I'm coming from is not just this one year.\n\nI see most of the progress in Quantum Gravity over the past 5 years happening outside the US (Canada, UK, Europe) and I see most of the fresh talent (PhD student and postdoc talent) outside the US----all except for the one US university that has a nonstring QG group, namely Penn State.\n\nSo going forwards I don't see how the US is going to be able to compete in that field when the big discoveries come. There seems to be a shift in creativity and in creative science management. A kind of European resurgence----remember how it was say from 1830-1930? The old pre-eminence.\n\nGokul43201 said:\n\nYou know a stringy person would look at the same data and conclude that the US is indeed headed in the right direction. ;)\n\n\"right direction\" or \"not right\" is not exactly the question, Gokul. I am speculating as to whether we are going to see a shift to more of the physics and chemistry Nobels going to Europe, or outside US.\n\nInstead of the way it has been in past where such a lot of them went to US scientists.\n\nthe fact that people get Nobels doesn't necessarily mean that they are \"right\" or \"not right\" except in the view of the Nobel committee.\n\nBasically we will just have to wait and see if the distribution of nobels in these fields is shifting.\n\n=============================\n\nI like your point about how different people foresee the future differently. Stringy-minded people probably would predict, and have been predicting, that some of their heros get the Nobel for string theory!\n\nI, because of a different perspective, would not predict that and would be surprised if it should ever happen.\n\nBut my ideas are not definite enough to actually predict---I don't have opinions about the awards---except that I have a vague feeling that the age of US dominance in the prizes is now passing."
