This year theme is “Harness innovation to reduce the malaria disease burden and save lives.”\n\nMalaria is a potentially fatal disease but used to be treated effectively with chloroquine and quinolines. In the 1960s, as a result of a failed attempt to globally eradicate the disease, the malaria parasite started developing resistance to these drugs and new treatments needed to be found. In 1964 China began confidential research into new antimalarials to tackle this challenge. A young scientist named Tu Youyou was asked to head up and build a research group searching for antimalarial drugs among traditional Chinese medicines. Her work led her to the plant Artemisia annua from which she extracted an active agent called artemisinin, or Qinghaosu (青蒿素) in Chinese. Today this antimalarial is used to treat millions across the globe. Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2015 “for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against Malaria.”\n\nApril 23, 2022: Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck was born on April 23, 1858 in Kiel, Schleswig, Germany.

The first one is a complete mess and shows only a hint that it might have worked. The second one is better but still messy. Then you do it the third time for the book.

That is why there is always a fourth time.” – Sydney Brenner (2002 Medicine Nobel Laureate)\n\nJanuary 5, 2022\n\n“In science creativity is the process of of putting together things that seem disparate.

And if you give up, you never get there.” – Mario Capecchi (2007 Physiology or Medicine Nobel Laureate)\n\nJuly 23, 2021\n\n“One of the most important things as a scientist is that you have to be an optimist.
