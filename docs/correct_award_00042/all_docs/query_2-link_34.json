So… I forgive you.\"\n\n―Leonard to his mother, The Maternal Conclusion\n\nLeonard Leakey Hofstadter[1][2], Ph.D., is one of the main protagonists of The Big Bang Theory. He is an experimental physicist at the California Institute of Technology who formerly roomed with Sheldon Cooper in Apartment 4A. Now he and his wife Penny live in that apartment. They also formerly lived in Penny's (now Sheldon and Amy's) apartment Apartment 4B. Originally from New Jersey, Leonard attended Princeton University[3] and was twenty-four years old when he received his doctorate with a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics. Having lived with Sheldon for 1 decade as of Season 6, he and Leonard are best friends; however, Leonard can become very agitated by many of his eccentricities and often feels obligated to explain Sheldon's behavior and serve as a mediator between him and other people in situations – he's been described as the straight man of the series. While Leonard, along with his geek friends and fellow scientists, is somewhat socially inept, Leonard would like to be better accepted outside of his social group. Leonard is better-adjusted than his companions, being more willing to try different things. He appears to be best suited as a leader of the group, with Sheldon commenting how Leonard is the \"Captain Kirk\" of their landing party. The romance between him and neighbor Penny, with their on-and-off relationship has been the major force for drama until Shamy started.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life (Before the series-2007)\n\nLeonard was born on May 17, 1980, in New Jersey to Alfred and Beverly Hofstadter (same month that Mt. St. Helens' erupted and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" came out). Not much is known about his early life. He has two siblings: a younger brother named Michael and an elder sister whose name we don't know (\"The Maternal Capacitance\", S2E15). He says that his brother was mean to him which probably means he has a bad relationship with him.\n\nAt age five, Leonard dressed up as The Hulk, using his mother's make-up and made-up muscles (balloon muscles) with a bra of his mother's to stop them from sagging. He had dressed up as The Hulk cause he was always mad at his mom and he wanted to smash his way out of the house. At age six, he walked in on his mother and father naked. She was swatting his father's bottom with Leonard's brand new ping-pong paddle and Leonard thought it was a dream until years later (\"The Raiders Minimization\", S7E4). From that same age, he had been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl (\"The Large Hadron Collision\" (S3E15)).\n\nAt age eight, his mother humiliated him by making him give back a ribbon at a science fair. He said it was his first science fair and that he had to give the ribbon back because he had done \"Do Lima Beans React Better to Classical Music?\", (\"The Pants Alternative\", S3E18). At age ten, he built a hugging machine to compensate for lack of affection which his father used to borrow (\"The Maternal Capacitance\", S2E15). His father was an anthropologist who spent more time with a 2000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy than with Leonard, who then expressed contempt towards him when he recalled this fact in \"The Fish Guts Displacement\", (S6E10).\n\nHe did not celebrate his birthday or Christmas as a child (\"The Peanut Reaction\", S1E16) due to his mother having the family study the holidays for their \"anthropological and psychological implications on human society\" and only celebrating achievements in the family (\"The Peanut Reaction\" (S1E16) & \"The Maternal Congruence\", S3E11). The family wrote research papers for Christmas and they were returned graded with his stocking. (\"The Santa Simulation\", S6E11) he always got a C. As Leonard was a geek, he was bullied badly as a youth and he stopped growing in the eighth grade. Throughout his childhood, his mother constantly conducted tests on him. One Easter his mother sent him out on an Easter egg hunt without putting out any eggs to see how long he would search for them (Took til June to figure the scheme out) (\"The Raiders Minimization\", S7E4). Before he went to Princeton, his parents put him in advanced placement classes and sent him to learn cello, \"getting me beaten up enough\", as he described himself (\"The Hamburger Postulate\", S1E5). Johnny Galecki does play the cello. Leonard had his first kiss at age 19 to a girl named Geraldine Coco (not Cuoco).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Leonard attended Princeton University and got his doctorate at age 24. In 2003, he met Sheldon Cooper, with whom he began sharing an apartment, but not before meeting Howard Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothrappali. The 4 guys became a group and hung out often. On June 30, 2004, Leonard and Howard made a Girlfriend Pact. The pact was that when one of the two got a girlfriend, they would have that girlfriend set the single guy up with a female friend of her own (\"The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary\" (S3E5)).\n\nSeason 1\n\nLeonard's starting having a discussion with his longtime best friend Sheldon as they plan to make donations for cash and the attention of the receptionist, Althea Davis. They meet their new neighbor Penny and she discusses her life causing her to get emotional. Leonard goes with Sheldon to retrieve her tv, costing them their pants to her unpleasant boyfriend Kurt. Leonard says he and Penny will have smart and beautiful children. (Pilot)\n\nLeonard comes to talk Sheldon out of cleaning Penny's apartment, though reluctantly helps Sheldon clean her place. When Penny's mad at them, he tells Sheldon to apologize, though he blows things. Leonard makes the effort himself, though Penny forgives him. (The Big Bran Hypothesis)\n\nLeonard has his first date with Penny, causing him nervousness and Sheldon to think he and Leonard are getting a cat. He goes on the date, hitting his head and suffering a concussion. Leonard doesn't reveal his true feeling to Penny yet, as he's not ready. (The Fuzzy Boots Corollary)\n\nSheldon gets fired, leading Leonard to call his mother for backup. She proves much more successful than Leonard in getting him to apologize to Eric Gablehauser, the president of the university and get his job back. (The Luminous Fish Effect)\n\nLeonard and his friends lost in paintball to teens and meet Penny, who invites them to her Halloween party. Initially, they all wanna be The Flash, though they decide to all change. Leonard eventually confronts Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt shortly upon him coming to the party, leading to Kurt getting mad and scaring Sheldon as he lifts Leonard. Penny furiously demands he put Leonard down, leading her to have a stressful and tearful night. Leonard then comforts her and taunts Kurt prior to shutting the door. (The Middle-Earth Paradigm)\n\nLeonard loses a game of Tri Dimensional Chess to Sheldon, who brags about his victory. Penny returns from Nebraska, mentioning her family was sick, worrying Sheldon, who starts panicking and makes Leonard mad when he reveals he's been peeing in a measuring cup. Sheldon gets sick himself, causing Leonard to rush out of the apartment and spend the day with his friends. Leonard makes a mistake with his glasses, leading to Penny catching him and unhappily leaving him to take care of Sheldon. Leonard, hoping to come with her, crashes his head and gets a concussion. He ends the episode sitting with Sheldon, not able to stand without puking. (The Pancake Batter Anomaly)\n\nSheldon gives all the right answers while practicing with his friends for The Physics Bowl Quiz, to which Leonard tells Sheldon he's making the game no longer fun without competition and had him removed from the team as a result. He recruits Leslie to join him, Raj, and Howard against Sheldon and his team. Leonard and his friends are in the lead, when Sheldon's pride costs him and his team the victory against Leonard's. (The Bat Jar Conjecture)\n\nSheldon's sister Missy Cooper comes to visit and Leonard gets competitive with Howard and Raj to date her. Sheldon makes a deal with Leonard to eat cheese without farting to date Missy, which Penny and Missy catch. Sheldon ends up kicked in the genitals and the only one Missy wants to see is Raj, whose medication starts wearing off once he visits. (The Porkchop Indeterminacy)\n\nPenny plans to throw Leonard a surprise party, to which she blackmails Sheldon. Leonard has to take Howard to the hospital when he risks his life for him via eating nuts, causing Leonard to miss the party. Leonard, solo with Penny, wishes to learn her birthday. (The Peanut Reaction)\n\nIn the season finale, Penny's just had a rough date and is not in a good state of mind. She's very snappy at Leonard, though eventually, they go out on a date. Leonard goes to Sheldon for help and he proposes Schrödinger's Cat. Sheldon says if Leonard screws things up, he'll likely be a grumpy old man without kids, reminding him of several Scooby Doo villains. Penny says the cat's alive and they go out on a date to find Sheldon fighting with Chen.\n\nSeason 2\n\nIn the season premiere, Leonard's caught by Howard and Raj on his date with Penny and Sheldon tells Leonard he wasn't interested in what they were doing. Sheldon, having learnt a secret from Penny, decides to leave when his stress overwhelms him and he doesn't know how else to keep the secret. Sheldon returns once Raj and Howard kick him out of their homes and Sheldon, under the influence of weird milk, tells Leonard Penny never graduated from community college out of insecurity. Leonard insults Penny and she gets mad and leaves.\n\nSheldon gets Penny addicted to Age of Conan, which she starts hounding him to get help with. Eventually, Sheldon starts threatening Leonard to take action or he'll be a difficult roommate for Leonard, who makes many failed efforts to stop her addiction. She wakes up to her senses once she accepts a quest with Howard, who she's not fond of. (The Barbarian Sublimation)\n\nHoward designs a space toilet which he needs help to stop from malfunctioning. Leonard gives Stuart bad hints for his date with Penny, who doesn't wanna discuss her date with Stuart. He then jumps in joy once he learns she called Stuart Leonard. (The Classified Materials Turbulence)\n\nSeason 3\n\nLeonard and Penny recover from an awkward night and Howard and Sheldon make Leonard mad when they inappropriately discuss Leonard and Penny's sex life in front of them. Leonard and Penny have an argument and a rough night, then Leonard meets up with Sheldon, Howard and Raj, while Sheldon and Howard have a bet. They don't pay much attention to Leonard and ditch him, causing him to call them easy to replace with three better friends. The episode ends with Penny kissing Leonard. (The Jiminy Conjecture)\n\nIn \"The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary\", while in bed, Leonard tells Penny about his Girlfriend Pact with Howard meaning that if one of them got a girlfriend, she would set the single one up with one of her friends. Later, Howard meets Bernadette who is not able to find anything in common with Howard until they both find out they have overbearing mothers.\n\nLeonard And Sheldon wager kites with Howard and Raj in a kite fight and Leonard focuses lots on his issues with Penny, embarrassing Sheldon and risking them defeat. Howard gets distracted by a female jogger, costing him and Raj their victory and Sheldon claims Raj's special kite that his brother sent him from India, leading Howard and Raj to a temporary split in their friendship. Leonard goes to ask Penny if she's embarrassed of having him near his friends, to which she says she isn't. Leonard says if he and Penny are gonna be a couple, Leonard should be friends with her friends and she invites him to watch the game with her next Saturday. Sheldon eventually teaches Leonard about football at his request and he watches a game with Penny, who persuades him to go kite fighting with Sheldon. (The Cornhusker Vortex)\n\nLeonard wants to go with Penny rather than Sheldon to Switzerland for Valentine's Day, leading Sheldon to torment him relentlessly. When Penny gets sick, Leonard tells Sheldon he can come, though goes with Raj, who's much more enthusiastic than Leonard on the vacation when Sheldon's sick too. (The Large Hadron Collision)\n\nSheldon has a trial for running a red light the day he's supposed to see Stan Lee at Stuart's store and is mad at Penny for making the guys miss out on Stan, to which Leonard and Raj look at him and Leonard says he, Howard and Raj will still be seeing Stan and they all refuse to go with Sheldon and Howard correctly predicts Sheldon will go to jail. While waiting to get their comic books signed, Leonard gets a phone call and reveals Howard's predictions came true. Howard And Leonard go out for gelato with Stan and get compliments on their comic books, unlike Raj, who made a scene. Sheldon's mad at Penny for all his issues that day and she decides to make things up to him. While talking to Stuart, Penny gets permission to bring Leonard to a wedding Stuart's going too. Once she and Sheldon go to see Stan Lee, he trespasses into Stan's house and the police offscreen escort Sheldon out of Stan's house and Sheldon gets a restraining order, which he brags about to his friends. Sheldon reveals he's scheduled for a hearing. (The Excelsior Acquisition)\n\nLeonard's relationship with Penny starts getting rocky when he tells her he loves her and she doesn't say the same back. When they go bowling with Sheldon, Leonard's pressuring of Penny costs Sheldon's team the match to Wil Wheaton's when she leaves. Eventually, she snaps and breaks up with Leonard, despite Sheldon's efforts and Wil reveals to Sheldon he broke them up. The guys are then humiliated in Stuart's store. (The Wheaton Recurrence)\n\nSeason 4\n\nLeonard learns Sheldon's planning to be a parent with Amy Farrah Fowler, who he met in the Season 3 finale. Howard's efforts to masturbate with his robot hand lead to an accident with his penis and Leonard has to go with Raj to help him. Once Penny threatens to tell Mary Cooper, Sheldon's religious mother of his plan, Sheldon changes his mind, which he tells Leonard, who learned that Howard just had the same incident once more. (The Robotic Manipulation)\n\nLeonard and his friends have a science conference to go to and Leonard drives the lead car. Penny comes to sleep with Leonard because Howard was acting like an ass in front of Bernadette, who was in Penny's bed and Amy was impossible for Penny to sleep with. Leonard's mischief leads Sheldon to switch rooms with Raj and the science conference is a rough time for the group. The episode ends with Bernadette and Howard unhappy with each other as Raj pukes in the other car, while Sheldon mentions he was spying in his game of I-Spy the aluminum rims on a cop car, which is gonna pull Leonard over for speeding. (The Love Car Displacement)\n\nSheldon calls the cops on a theft in his World of Warcraft game and mentions the FBI hung up on him. The guys go on a quest to hunt down the thief once Howard finds the crook and Sheldon gives him a rare praise. Penny ends up the real man in the group when she kicks Todd in the groin and forces him to return the stuff. Sheldon says they were successful and gets a look, because Penny was the one who forced Todd to surrender. (The Zarnecki Incursion)\n\nLeonard's playing Wii Sports with Sheldon who mentions gossip he got from Amy that Bernadette's thinking of splitting with Howard. He tells Raj's sister Priya Koothrappali, who startles Leonard via telling him Raj likes Bernadette. Howard, however, plans to propose to Bernadette and she accepts, to which everyone save Raj is happy with her accepting his engagement ring. (The Herb Garden Germination)\n\nIn the season finale, Leonard gets made fun of in The Cheesecake Factory and learns Bernadette got a doctorate. He then turns the jokes to Howard, who says the focus is on her. He plays a game with Priya, causing Raj discomfort and deciding to leave his apartment. He finds Raj in his bed, scaring him, though the two settle down and agree Raj can bring girls if they're ok with that. Penny tells Raj, who was temporarily Sheldon's roommate that splitting with Leonard was a big mistake and Leonard finds out Priya's returning to India. Leonard, back home, finds out that Raj slept with Penny, leading to all eyes on them.\n\nSeason 5\n\nLeonard ends his relationship with Priya after learning that she slept with her ex-boyfriend. In the 100th episode, he reconnects with Penny and they resume their relationship, establishing a \"beta-test\" to ensure that they don't face the same problems as the last time they were together. At the end of the season Leonard asks Penny to marry him for the first time.\n\nSeason 6\n\nPenny nearly breaks up with Leonard because to her, the relationship seemed boring. However, she visits him at work and is re-impressed with how smart he is and their relationship seems to take off from there. They become more committed to, and dependent upon each other during the rest of this season. Penny eventually admits to Leonard that she loves him and soon faces serious issues when Sheldon's new assistant develops a crush on Leonard, but the issues diminish when Leonard assures Penny that he's not turning his back on her. Leonard leaves for a North Sea expedition in the season finale, with the two of them now comfortable enough in their relationship to say they love each other.\n\nSeason 7\n\nUpon his return from the trip, Leonard and Penny's relationship starts to get very serious. They do plenty of gestures for each other and at the end of the season they become engaged to be married.\n\nSeason 8\n\nLeonard and Sheldon come up with a new scientific theory that gives them recognition, while at the same time, Penny and Leonard's relationship continues to improve, including a minor situation regarding finances and living arrangements that won't upset Sheldon. In the last episode of the season, thanks to some prodding by Sheldon to set a date for their wedding, Leonard and Penny take off to Las Vegas to get married.\n\nSeason 9\n\nSheldon vanishes at the mention at the mention of his birthday party, to which Leonard wonders where that info was for a long time. Sheldon then mentions his issues with birthdays and his friends get him to reluctantly agree at the cost of Amy owing him big time. While discussing a present for Sheldon with Howard and Raj, Leonard asks Stuart for Adam West's phone number and they drive him while discussing the best Batman actors and meet Stuart at Leonard's apartment for Sheldon's party as well as many other people. Sheldon gets uncomfortable with tons of people there and eventually returns with Penny's help, apologizing for his behaviour and everyone complimenting Sheldon, with Stephen Hawking singing to Sheldon. Leonard convinces a reluctant Hawking to sing with the group as a whole for Sheldon. Adam asks who's taking him home. (The Celebration Experimentation)\n\nLeonard and the guys are going to a film screening and Leonard has Penny pick up his mother from the airport. While at the theatre, Stuart is hired by Sheldon to run errands for him with Amy, who wishes for Sheldon and not Stuart. Leonard and Howard make fun of Raj's chair while Sheldon has to handle things personally. When someone else comes, Leonard tells Sheldon said guy's just joining his friends, though Sheldon makes a scene and quotes Rosa Parks, with Leonard eventually succeeding in getting Sheldon to stop. (The Line Substitution Solution)\n\nIn the season finale, Leonard tells Penny about the scene Sheldon made at the theatre and Penny discusses having a second wedding ceremony for Beverly. Leonard says their marriage was spur of the moment and they dislike Beverly. Eventually, Penny convinces a reluctant Leonard to do this for themselves instead and Penny excitedly says she never thought she'd marry LEONARD of all people twice. Sheldon invites other people to the wedding and includes himself in Leonard and Penny's relationship, to which Penny isn't happy he's inviting these people. While picking up Beverly, she's mad at Leonard for inviting Alfred without notifying her and Leonard says he was wrong to say there was 0 excuse for Alfred's behaviour, claiming there's 3. Leonard and Sheldon's mothers are very distant from each other, causing Penny and Amy discomfort. Alfred and Leonard have a much better relationship than Beverly and Leonard and Leonard introduces Alfred to Mary and the others there. Alfred and Beverly are snarky toward each other and Leonard tells them to stop. Beverly and Alfred grow fond of each other and the group has dinner without Howard, Raj and Bernadette, as Howard got in trouble, much to Bernadette's frustration. When Sheldon and Leonard are uncomfortable without the ability to reach their parents, Penny bursts out laughing.\n\nSeason 10\n\nLeonard and Penny post an awkward night have Sheldon worrying that Leonard and Sheldon might be family. Leonard and Penny do everything they can to reassure him that nothing's happening and the next morning's not much more normal. Sheldon and Beverly snap at each other for the first time and Sheldon makes many inappropriate comments regarding Alfred and Mary, to Mary's displeasure. Leonard says the wedding ceremony will be special and Beverly's not having a great day. During the ceremony, Penny and Leonard mention everything they love about each other and Bernadette pronounces them husband and wife, calling Sheldon the weird other husband. Leonard's parents manage a near minute of peace on the way to the airport. (The Conjugal Conjecture)\n\nIn \"The Fetal Kick Catalyst\", Penny is signing autographs for fans of the first and second Serial Ape-ist movies where the fans think that she is a terrible actress and can't believe that the nerd Leonard is her husband. The fans sit around Leonard as he tells his story how he won the hot actress, which makes them think of him as awesome.\n\nLeonard and Penny finally have their own apartment: Apartment 4A, with Sheldon having moved out to live with Amy in Apartment 4B, first as a living experiment (The Cohabitation Experimentation), but then permanently (The Veracity Elasticity).\n\nSeason 11\n\nIn \"The Proposal Proposal\", Leonard is happy about Sheldon and Amy's engagement. Bernadette suggests that Leonard and Penny should have a baby in order to try and calm Howard and Bernadette's worries about having another baby so soon, but Leonard and Penny declined.\n\nIn \"The Retraction Reaction\", Leonard is interviewed by Ira Flatow on NPR, but screws up in the interview. Later, it seemed that he was right about what he said.\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Metric\", Sheldon picks Leonard to be his best man for his wedding. He and Penny are Shamy's wedding party.\n\nSeason 12\n\nIn \"The Decision Reverberation\", Leonard starts to be more confident in himself and talks President Siebert into making him a co-lead on a new experimental physics project.\n\nIn \"The Maternal Conclusion\", Leonard's mother comes to visit him. He's initially very happy, though her real reason to visit destroys Leonard's pleasure. Eventually, Leonard returns to confront her for all the issues she caused him for years, though ultimately gives up and decides to forgive her. They hug as she cries over the heavy emotions she has during her last scene in the show.\n\nIn the series finale, Penny learns that she's pregnant. While preparing to take The Elevator, shortly post said elevator receiving fixing, the group has an issue, to which Leonard has an idea on how to solve. Sheldon compliments Leonard, though Leonard isn't insanely happy to be called a valuable part of his entourage. When Sheldon's worrying Penny's sick, she says she's pregnant and Sheldon just dismisses her pregnancy as an ailment he can't catch. Leonard's very mad at Sheldon for blowing off Penny's pregnancy and treating his friends poorly, causing him to tell Sheldon he and his Nobel Prize is meaningless to him. In the hotel, when Sheldon selfishly dismisses Howard and Bernadette's meltdown, the four consider leaving, though ultimately, they stay. Sheldon, with Amy's help, has a change of heart and acknowledges how much his friends mean to him, leading Penny to cry tears of joy. The series ends with Leonard, Penny and their friends other than Stuart, Denise and Bert, having dinner.\n\nCareer\n\nLeonard is a senior experimental physicist at the California Institute of Technology and has been published in several peer-reviewed journals. His honors include the Newcomb Medal. When he started at the university seven years ago as of the third season, he conducted classified government research on military rocket fuel capable of generating over 8,000 kN of thrust. His work often includes the use of high-powered lasers, and his research topics have varied from Bose-Einstein condensates and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to cosmic radiation and dark matter. According to Sheldon, most of his work is extremely derivative.\n\nWith Sheldon, he co-authored a paper entitled \"Paradoxical Moment-of-Inertia Changes Due to Putative Super-Solids\", to be presented at an Institute for Experimental Physics topical conference on Bose-Einstein condensates. The findings contained therein show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the solid becomes a super-solid, a previously unknown state of matter, and the moment of inertia changes.\n\nTo study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, Leonard designed an experiment using a helium-neon laser. When the university received a new free-electron laser, he required access in order to perform his X-ray diffraction experiment. Subsequently, he procured a big government grant to see if high-powered lasers can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles, though he considered the concept improbable. After progress with his ongoing research regarding high-energy lasers, he worked on a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking.\n\nHis investigations into dark matter were rendered useless by Dr. David Underhill's observation of high-energy positrons, the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter. Yet, together, they examined the radiation levels of photo-multiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector. He later attempted to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians. Likewise, he has grown isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection and built, with the aid of Howard Wolowitz, a multi-wire proportional counter for detecting cosmic particles.\n\nLeonard has carried out a series of anti-proton decay experiments with negative results. His experiment consisted of twenty thousand data runs and no statistically significant results.\n\nDr. Hofstadter's tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect reached an interesting point when examining the phase shift due to an electric potential, wherein he set up the voltages using tunnel junctions. Though, given the parameters of his experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture of the nano-fabricated metal rings was qualitatively no different than an experiment already conducted in the Netherlands per Sheldon and Penny. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect. On the other hand, collaboration with Dr. Arthur Jeffries on a paper about nano-vacuum tubes was promising.\n\nSince Stephen Hawking knew Dr. Hofstadter's research, Leonard was invited to join the professor's team, which sent an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. Leonard spent a period of four months looking into the possibility that one could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water, as the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest.\n\nBased upon a theory from Leonard, Sheldon wrote a paper detailing a theory that space-time is like a super-fluid. The paper was well received by the scientific community that included Professor Stephen Hawking. The theory is discussed in article in \"Scientific America\" and \"Physics Today\", the former didn't mention Leonard. Also, Leonard and Sheldon were invited to the University of California at Berkeley to lecture on their work, but missed it after they were detained for an incident at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch headquarters.\n\nIn \"The Retraction Reaction\", Leonard is interviewed on NPR and describes all these theories, but admits that physics hasn't found anything new recently. He gets called into Janine Davis' office and is told to issue a public retraction non his comments. After all the guys gets depressed and wonder what they are doing professionally after it seemed that Leonard was right, they go to visit the grave of Richard Feynman which rekindles their love of science and working at it for the fun of it.\n\nIn \"The Novelization Correlation\" Leonard is writing a book about a physicist solving a murder at the CERN collider in Switzerland.\n\nIn \"The Grant Allocation Derivation\", he has to distribute some excess grant money which he takes very seriously. After turning down many requests looking very decisive, he can't decide between the last three so he buys himself a new laser.\n\nIn \"The Decision Reverberation\", Penny again tells Leonard that he should stand up for himself more. Leonard decides that he wants to be the principle investigator on a plasma physics study so he prepares a proposal and plans to threaten to quit if President Siebert will not accept his proposal. Penny is worried because she doesn't want to move. Even though President Siebert turned him down, Leonard does get called back and offered a different job as co-lead on a photo entanglement project. Leonard is happy and Penny is very proud of him.\n\nCharacterization\n\n\"My name is Doctor Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you.\"\n\n—Leonard Hofstadter, The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization\n\nAlthough Leonard feels at home with his geek colleagues, he is reluctant to let others know about his recreational activities (such as Klingon Boggle), as he does not like to be seen as a geek and wants to be more social. Sweet, thoughtful, kind, intelligent, mature, sardonic and socially awkward, but well-meaning, Leonard also seems to be the most well-adjusted and sensible one of The Social Group, and is quick to try new things apart from his geek friends.\n\nDespite his reasonable nature, he can sometimes display selfishness, normally putting his needs before his friends' well-being, as told by Sheldon Cooper who is the only one to realize this. During the group's expedition to North Pole he tricks Sheldon into thinking that he had definitively proven slow moving magnetic monopoles when in reality it was simply static from him switching the electric can opener on and off as he they wanted to kill Sheldon. When they return from the North Pole he is totally humiliated among his scientific peers. Sheldon fled to Texas to live with his mother, Leonard, despite the trick being his idea, wanted Raj and Howard to go to Texas without him to convince Sheldon to come back, just so that he could have first sex with Penny (\"The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation\"). Another example is when he refuses for Zack Johnson to be Superman for the comic book store's costume party because Zack has actual muscles (\"The Justice League Recombination\"). Another example of Leonard's selfishness was when he was sleeping with Raj's sister Priya, and didn't seem to care how Raj felt about the situation (\"The Cohabitation Formulation\").\n\nA lifetime of being denied and refused praise and acclaim that he unavoidably deserves (Because his mother had absolutely little regard or admiration for him and often demolished his infrequent moments of happiness as a child, and Sheldon relentlessly unknowingly demoralizes him and his accomplishments out of egomania and sheer apathy) has led to Leonard yearning for recognition for his intelligence, compassion and determination. He becomes extremely bitter when he discovers that a major science paper that he and Sheldon cooperatively wrote was published with only Sheldon's name (which was obviously Sheldon's fault due to Sheldon being an arrogant credit hog). He also admits to Sheldon that he is an egotist who needs his big ego to be constantly validated from people who are much less smarter than he is while presenting their paper to a class of graduate students.\n\nAs a result of how he was raised (Unloved and under-appreciated, due to the lack of love from his parents, his mother's views of raising children as obviously opposed to his father's), he was not as intelligent as his siblings and his mother having been unloving, unsupportive and neglectful altogether and treating Leonard as a personal science experiment instead. Leonard was seen as not any happier than Sheldon (who grew up loved) and frequently insecure and sometimes unhappy. But that soon changed during his second relationship with Penny. She made him more confident during their relationship (Since Penny always gave him lots of love and affection and Leonard was only in love with her the day they first met) and by the time they were married, Leonard was much happier than he had ever been in his life, having married the love of his life, as said by Amy and Bernadette in \"The Separation Oscillation\" (even his mother thought that perhaps she was wrong that they shouldn't be together due to Penny's education status, but when she saw how happy Leonard had been since their marriage, which she had never seen before, she thought they were a good couple together).\n\nAmong the main characters, he generally has the least amount of difficulty interacting with \"ordinary\" individuals, as compared to Sheldon (who is unable to grasp social norms), Raj (who is unable to talk to women outside his family unless under the influence of alcohol until the end of season 6), and even Howard (who is often seen as \"creepy\" when flirting with women) since Leonard is the only one of them interested and quite adept in building interpersonal and social relationships with other people. Compared to his friends, he is also relatively the most successful with women.\n\nBetween Sheldon and him, Leonard is the only one who feels that he \"should do something\" when Penny begins to recount her recent breakup. Leonard usually blurts out the wrong things in front of women when he is nervous, such as when he's trying to invite Penny to lunch and mentions that curry is a natural laxative, or, as in \"The Plimpton Stimulation\" where he can't decide what to say he will often combine thoughts. i.e. \"Hi-lo,\" instead of \"Hi,\" or \"Hello.\"\n\nDespite his attempts to reject his geek status, Leonard owns, among other things, Star Wars hygiene products, an expensive Superman comic book collection, a \"Battlestar Galactica\" Colonial warrior's flight suit, and a light saber that he calls a \"glow stick\".\n\nLeonard is indicated to be proficient in literature, history, and music as well as the sciences - he is able to solve a woman's crossword puzzle in a matter of seconds (the answers were mostly literary in nature) and he can play the cello.\n\nHaving lived with Sheldon for many years, they are best friends, and he is obligated to explain Sheldon's irrational behavior and serve as a mediator between him and other people in many situations; however, Leonard often gets very irritated by much of his behavior. For instance, when Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Leonard gave Penny the phone number of Sheldon's mother so she would call her son and scold Sheldon for his behavior, thus ending the fight, as shown in the episode \"The Panty Piñata Polarization\".\n\nLeonard is also upset that Sheldon dislikes his favorite show, \"Babylon 5\", which Sheldon refuses to allow to be watched in his apartment. Like everyone, he dislikes his friend's habit of rattling off different trivial facts. Leonard's IQ of 173 is not as high as Sheldon's and the latter has scoffed at Leonard's whiteboard theories as common enough to be \"scribbled on the wall of every men's room at MIT.\"\n\nLeonard seems to get along well with Howard. Leonard and Howard even have a Girlfriend Pact, which Leonard invoked in \"The Desperation Emanation\" so that Howard would help him get a girlfriend. In \"The Peanut Reaction\", Howard tried to make Leonard's birthday a surprise, going as far as getting himself hospitalized, proving to Leonard how much Howard cares for him though Penny also proposed him the phone number of one of her slutty friends. Leonard also seems to get along well with Raj. Although Leonard does get irritated by much of Raj's impulsive and eccentric behavior, as in \"The Griffin Equivalency\" where Raj became pompous and self-absorbed after being chosen to be in People magazine.\n\nLeonard has a lot of conditions. He is lactose intolerant, asthmatic, bespectacled due to myopia, prone to carsickness and migraines, gets a bloody nose after jogging, suffers from sleep apnea, allergies and a lot of ear infections, and possesses a genetic predisposition to heart disease. Leonard's primary health concern is his lactose intolerance. He avoids eating even small amounts of dairy products (including cheese, yogurt and butter), as well as melon and desserts at The Cheesecake Factory, for fear of his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal and resulting in the emission of a noxious gas that Sheldon maintains can be weaponized. This digestive trait is often the subject of teasing. According to the pilot episode, he cannot process corn either.\n\nLeonard is somewhat neurotic, insecurely tilting his head as he speaks nervously, as well as avoiding eye contact and squinting. When under great stress, his voice is elevated to a high-pitched whine, when he lies or gets sweaty. At times, Leonard's demeanor seems very low energy and somewhat irritable. Clumsy, he often bangs his head, which induces vomiting. Leonard is incredibly sensitive about his height (he stopped growing in eighth grade), although he enjoys pointing out that Howard is shorter.\n\nLeonard is usually seen wearing his characteristic black-framed glasses, neutral-colored jackets or vests over a hoodie, low-cut black Converse sneakers, brown trousers, and physics-themed t-shirts. Along with his fashion choices, including mismatched color schemes, he sometimes applies an absurd amount of hair gel; however, his girlfriends often buy him new clothes, and he has put aside his corduroy suit for formal occasions to don a fancy silk shirt and vest or blazer, much to Penny's approval. His formal suits style improves with time. He always wears his hoodies because Sheldon has the thermostat set so low.\n\nOver the course of the series, despite retaining his geeky habits, Leonard's confidence has grown and he has become more socially adept throughout the series. Leonard is also somewhat charismatic and a good leader in certain situations, which Sheldon shockingly recognizes.\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nLeonard is a short and a little thick man, originally in his late twenties but he's in his late thirties at the end of the series. He is 5' 5\" (1.65 m) with brunette hair and brown eyes. Penny thinks that his eyebrows are weird. His wardrobe includes black thick-framed glasses, a large variety of colored and patterned sweat shirts with hoods worn under a neutral colored jacket, brown trousers and low-cut black Converse All Stars sneakers. Like Sheldon, Leonard often wears physics-themed t-shirts (under his other layers), but he has a much wider selection; many of his t-shirt themes deal with social issues such as renewable energy (wind farms) and recycling, as well as animal issues (rescue programs and themes around endangered species). Leonard's wardrobe has its own section on the Wiki. Sheldon once said, male members of Leonard's family get bald very early, yet neither Leonard or his father are bald nor have lost much hair.\n\nAppearances\n\nAppearances\n\nThe Big Bang Theory Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Tot Season 1 17 Season 2 23 Season 3 23 Season 4 24 Season 5 24 Season 6 24 Season 7 24 Season 8 24 Season 9 24 Season 10 24 Season 11 24 Season 12 24\n\nAppearances\n\nYoung Sheldon Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Tot Season 1 M 0 Season 2 M C 1 Season 3 0 Season 4 I M 0 Season 5 0 Season 6 0 Season 7 0 Appeared M = Mentioned Did not appear Not aired/Not available V = Voiced C = Cameo F = Flashback I = Indirectly mentioned P = Pictured\n\nFamily\n\nAll of the members of Leonard Hofstadter's family are accomplished scientists, apart from his younger brother, Michael, who is a successful law professor. Leonard is actually the least successful of his family in their respective fields.\n\nHis mother, Beverly, is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who has a personality identical to Sheldon's, including strict speech patterns, lack of social conventions, and attention to details. She is mainly responsible for the difficult childhood Leonard had. Due to his mother's views, Leonard never celebrated his birthday during his childhood, and when she visited him, she didn't see the point of viewing his unoriginal research since it had already been done.\n\nShe never gave him any sort of approval growing up and one time humiliated him when she forced him to give back an award at the school fair because it was too similar to his brother's earlier project. In \"The Pants Alternative,\" Leonard suggested the reason that his brother is 8\" taller than him is due to his mother's lack of nurturing him as a child. In \"The Engagement Reaction.\" Leonard had mentioned to Penny that when he was young he built a \"hugging machine\" with two self-constructed remote-controlled arms in order to compensate for the lack of affection from his mother; the saddest thing was that his father used to borrow it too. Beverly also mentioned to Howard that Leonard's brother (Michael) and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is, but she was not proud of them as they weren't \"her\" accomplishments. When he was six, Leonard had walked in on his naked parents while his mother was spanking his father's bottom with his new ping-pong paddle. Leonard had thought that that incident had been a nightmare of his youth. When Leonard told her about his engagement to Penny, she was willing to accept it because Sheldon was fond of Penny. In return, Leonard has a huge desire to harm his mother or have bad things happen to her, blames all the horrible stories and issues of his childhood on her, considers all her books to be garbage and as a result of his upbringing, Leonard is desperate to please others and has sometimes been quite insecure until Penny made him more confident, as said by Amy and Bernadette in \"The Separation Oscillation\". Beverly attends Sheldon's birthday party and gets hit on by Barry Kripke to Leonard's discomfort. Later, she visits and Penny tries to bond with her, resulting in a vow renewal ceremony since Beverly was disappointed about not receiving an invitation to their Las Vegas wedding. Leonard infuriates her by inviting his father. In \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Leonard's father says that even though he and Beverly don't bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. In the \"The Maternal Conclusion\", Leonard realizes that his mother will never change and he forgives her. She says that helps and they have a truly motherly embrace.\n\nLeonard's brother, Michael, is a Harvard University law professor and is engaged and later married to the youngest appellate court judge in New Jersey history. Leonard also says that his brother is eight inches taller than him. Later in Season 8, it is revealed that he had recently argued a case before the Supreme Court. He never appeared in the program.\n\nLeonard's sister, whose name is unknown is a cutting-edge medical researcher working with adolescent gibbons to cure diabetes. She has even gone as far as successfully growing a human pancreas in one. Leonard also says that she is 38 years old and married in Season 4. She never appeared in the program.\n\nLeonard's father, Alfred, is briefly mentioned as an anthropologist. Sheldon pointed out that Leonard's middle name, \"Leakey\", comes from famed archaeologist Louis Leakey with whom Leonard's father had worked, which Leonard finds humiliating. Although his relationship with his father is unknown, it is implied due to Beverly's nature that Leonard prefers his father over her. In Season 3, his father had an affair, which resulted in their divorce. In \"The Convergence Convergence\" Alfred appears and he and Leonard appear to get on really well, is happy for the couple and is very fond of Penny. After sniping with his ex-wife, he and Sheldon's mother really get cozy and disappear into their hotel together, an idea that Leonard and Sheldon do not like, although it's revealed in the next episode \"The Conjugal Conjecture\" that they didn't sleep together, but plan on still seeing each other in the future.\n\nLeonard's now-deceased Uncle Floyd was briefly mentioned in \"The Maternal Capacitance\" as the only person from his childhood of whom he had fond memories. In \"The Codpiece Topology,\" though, he mentions his Aunt Edna, a very hairy woman, is sweet and would tickle him when they hugged. The closest thing he ever had to a birthday party was when his grandfather died on his birthday, so he got to see his cousins and have his favorite German chocolate cake.\n\nThere is male pattern baldness in his family. According to Sheldon, when his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. At Thanksgiving, his grandmother with Alzheimer's had an episode where she took her clothes off in the apartment; Leonard describing the worst part as when she carved the turkey. This took place before the series started.\n\nIn \"The Itchy Brain Simulation,\" Leonard showed Penny a sweater that an aunt had made for him when he went off to college. It is bright red, very itchy and had \"Lenny\" spelled out on the front. At the same time as the sweater, his brother got a car from her.\n\nIn \"The Celebration Experimentation\", Beverly mentions that Sheldon was at her 60th birthday get together along with Leonard's siblings and he knew nothing about it. Penny counters that since their wedding was in Vegas, she did not get an invitation. Beverly is thankful for that. She backtracks on the wedding invitation a the end of the season.\n\nIn \"The Explosion Implosion\", after Penny answered a phone call from Beverly for Leonard, the pair developed a close bond with Beverly dishing on her recent amorous activities. Amy was jealous of Penny's close relationship with Leonard's mother, while Leonard was more annoyed that his mother told Penny she was proud of her - something Beverly has never said about him. When Leonard confronted his mother, Beverly told him how great Penny was, that out of all of her children's spouses, Penny was the best one and admitted she was proud of Leonard - if only for marrying well. Beverly also noticed that Leonard was trying hard not to cry, so she let him hang up quickly since Leonard was already being driven to tears.\n\nIn \"The Maternal Conclusion\", Beverly visits Leonard and Penny asking nice and truly interested in Leonard's new physics project. Later she admits that she is doing research for a new book which makes Leonard blowup. Finally he forgives her which makes both of them feel much better and they end in a true loving embrace.\n\nFamily Members\n\nFather: Alfred Hofstadter\n\nMother: Beverly Hofstadter\n\nBrother: Michael Hofstadter\n\nSister: Unnamed\n\nUncle: Floyd\n\nAunts: Edna, Nancy, Unnamed\n\nCousins: Unnamed\n\nGrandfather: Unnamed\n\nGrandmother: Unnamed\n\nWife: Penny Hofstadter (née ?)\n\nChild: Unborn\n\nFather-in-law: Wyatt\n\nMother-in-law: Susan\n\nBrother-in-laws: Randall, Unnamed (via Penny's sister), Unnamed (via his own sister)\n\nSister-in-laws: Lisa (via Penny), Unnamed (via Michael)\n\nNephews: Neil, Jeffrey, Scott, William, Richard (all via his sister)\n\nNephew: Unnamed (via Penny)\n\nUnnamed nephews/nieces (via Michael)\n\nUncle-in-law: Unnamed\n\nCousin-in-law: Unnamed\n\nPaternal Grandfather-in-law: Unnamed\n\nPaternal Grandmother-in-law: Unnamed\n\nMaternal Grandmother-in-law: Unnamed\n\nMaternal Grandfather-in-law: Unnamed\n\nRelationships\n\nPlatonic\n\nSheldon\n\nSheldon is the best friend of Leonard, as they live together and are accustomed to tolerating each other's quirks ever since Sheldon put out an ad for a roommate with a list of criteria to follow. When Leonard first met Sheldon he had a bunch of rules that Leonard had to follow. Despite Sheldon sometimes making remarks to the contrary, he appreciates Leonard and assures Leonard that his friend will not die alone. He even once told Leonard that he platonically loves him, when Leonard had to face his old high-school bully, Jimmy Speckerman. When Penny asks Leonard why he deals with Sheldon, he explains that Sheldon has actually saved his neck a few times, such as when he stopped him from being incinerated by his own improperly formulated rocket fuel and didn't tell on him to the landlord, the police or the Department of Homeland Security. This incident also lead to the destruction of the elevator, as Sheldon had just enough time to put the explosive contents of the container into the elevator before it exploded. Leonard also, more than all of Sheldon's other friends understands him the most, as viewed in many scenes where when all hopes failed to get Sheldon to participate in something, Leonard will be the last resort to come up with something successful. When Penny and Sheldon had a spat due to Penny sitting in his spot and touching his food and later refused to apologize to him, which resulted her being banished from the apartment, Penny came up with her own set of revenge, including banishing Sheldon from the Cheesecake Factory and messing up with Sheldon's Laundry Night. When things got really ugly between the two, a fed up Leonard secretly gave Penny Sheldon's mother's number, telling her it is Sheldon's Kryptonite. The feud ended after that, with Sheldon, clueless to the fact that it was Leonard who helped Penny, told Penny that she played well. Another instance was when Penny tried her hands at opening her own business by selling Penny Blossoms. When they had to stay awake all night to help Penny meet her order, a sleepy Sheldon refused coffee and decided to head to bed instead, leaving the rest to finish up by themselves. A frustrated Penny looked on to Leonard to do something and Leonard did, by saying to Sheldon that without his insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail, which prompted Sheldon to change his mind and drink coffee. In \"The Septum Deviation\", Sheldon objects to him have elective nasal surgery due to the risks of surgery indicating that he really cares for Leonard despite his condescension. Sheldon and Leonard have co-authored at least two scientific papers together.\n\nIn \"The Proton Displacement\" (S7E07), Leonard explains why he puts up with Sheldon and takes Sheldon as his friend:\n\n\"Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he is not doing it on purpose. It's just how he is. He is also loyal and trustworthy, and we have fun together...You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person that I have ever met. He is a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.\"\n\nIn \"The Space Probe Disintegration\", Leonard tells Sheldon that his attitude is why he and Penny are not living together. After a tearful period thinking about them him moving out, Sheldon lets him go one night a week to stay at Penny's. Sheldon still sleeps on her couch that night.\n\nIn \"The Skywalker Incursion\" the guys drive up to George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch headquarters to see if they could get in. They can't so Sheldon rushes the gate, gets caught by being tased and almost gets the two of them arrested. Leonard is mad, but still calls it an adventure.\n\nIn \"The 2003 Approximation\", Leonard finally moves out to live with his wife Penny; however, in the end Penny agrees that they will spend at least half their night back in Leonard's old room.\n\nIn \"The Convergence Convergence\", Sheldon's mother and Leonard's father find a connection, may have spent the night together and Leonard could end up Sheldon's step-brother. When Leonard toasts Sheldon on his birthday in \"The Celebration Experimentation\", he calls Sheldon his brother.\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Metric\", Sheldon and Amy test their friends for positions in their wedding party. The gang gets pissed and no one wants to be in their wedding. Later Leonard tells him that his best man is his own choice and Sheldon choses him.\n\nIn \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Leonard is very happy for his buddy Sheldon when he is about to get married. He is also happy that Sheldon was now legally Amy's problem, but Sheldon says that that is not going to stop him from being his problem. After the wedding ceremony is delayed, Leonard checks up on them and finds Sheldon and Amy inventing Super-Asymmetry which also gets Leonard fascinated and involved. Penny has to come and get the three of them to start the wedding.\n\nIn \"The Citation Negation\", Leonard helps Sheldon with the footnotes in his Super-Asymmetry paper and finds an old untranslated Russian paper that states that Super-Asymmetry is not worth pursuing.\n\nHoward\n\nHoward meets Leonard in a flashback in \"The Staircase Implementation\" and they are best friends. Howard told Penny that both he and Raj liked Leonard, not Sheldon. Leonard has helped him quite often, and Howard faced an allergic reaction partly to provide Leonard's first birthday party. Though, Howard finds Leonard's worries over Penny humorous sometimes, and they like to post embarrassing things about each other on YouTube and Twitter. The two of them made a pact that if either one of them ever got a girlfriend, the other one would set up the single guy with one of her girlfriends. When it comes to agreements and women, they frequently fight. Leonard does enjoy poking fun at Howard's height, although he is only a quarter of an inch taller (\"and don't you forget it!\"). In \"The Conference Valuation\", Leonard spends the weekend at Wolowitz's playing board games and conducting development tests on Howard's kids. Leonard has some deja vu because he sees that Sheldon treats the kids the same way Beverly treated him, testing him all the time.\n\nRaj\n\nLeonard and Rajesh Koothrappali meet at the university in a flashback in \"The Staircase Implementation\" and they are best friends. Made clear in \"The Jerusalem Duality\", both Raj and Howard like Leonard. Though, Raj takes delight in Leonard's problems with Penny and becomes somewhat adversarial with him when he dates his sister, Priya. Despite his tendency to tease Leonard about his girlfriend issues, he is supportive of his and Penny's relationship and frequently attempts to get him to break up with Priya (sometimes employing subtle manipulative techniques, such as feeding his paranoia about the two women comparing notes about his sex life). Raj feels jealous when Leonard and Howard use his ideas for fun and exclude him. Raj has said that Leonard only hangs out with him if he has no other options, and has missed him (\"The Spaghetti Catalyst\"). When Sheldon and Penny were indisposed, Leonard took the very appreciative Raj with him to Switzerland for a visit to the Large Hadron Collider after both Penny and Sheldon fall sick [as seen in \"The Large Hadron Collision\". They normally try to help each other. In \"The Date Night Variable\", Raj hangs out with Leonard and Penny on their date and gets thrown out when he tries to get Penny to tell Leonard that she loves him. In \"The Cooper Extraction\", Amy points out to the gang that most of them would not know each other if Sheldon had not been part of their lives. Since Leonard is not in Apartment 4A, Raj envisions them living together; however, Leonard is fat due to Raj's cooking and Leonard's loneliness.\n\nBernadette\n\nLeonard and Bernadette have a warm relationship. They became friends shortly after Penny introduced her to Howard. She became interested in Leonard's experiments, but they are only best friends, as Howard and Bernadette are in a relationship (even though Howard felt threatened). Leonard is impressed how she can get Sheldon to do things such as go to bed, but then her mother ran an illegal daycare center and she was used to dealing with stubborn children (\"The Einstein Approximation\"). In a daydream of Raj in \"The Thespian Catalyst\", Leonard comforts Bernadette after he and Raj hear about Howard's accident when he was on his scooter and hit by a truck and she started crying. In \"The Scavenger Vortex\", Leonard and Bernadette are matched in their scavenger hunt and she keeps pushing him around because she is very competitive.\n\nBut despite problems, Bernadette and Leonard truly love and care for each other, and Bernadette even shows her love for Leonard in \"The Conjugal Conjecture\" where she officiates Leonard and Penny's re-wedding ceremony when she says \"The love we have for them\" with the 'we' referring to herself and the guests and the 'them' referring to Leonard and Penny.\n\nAmy\n\nAmy and Leonard did not get on very well at first, but now they are best friends, with Leonard finding her judgmental and obnoxious like Sheldon and Amy seemed to always look down on him. Leonard slowly warmed to Amy, though they rarely hang out alone. Leonard found it odd when Amy stayed late at the apartment, even after Sheldon had left, oblivious to the fact Leonard would have preferred to be alone. Their relationship improved gradually. Finally, in \"The Pulled Groin Extrapolation\", Amy invited Leonard as her date to a wedding she was about to attend, explaining that Sheldon was a terrible guest at a previous wedding because there were no physicists his age there. They ended up enjoying each other at the wedding and Leonard commented that Amy really knows how to make a guy loosen up and have a good time. When Amy called Sheldon while drunk in \"The Isolation Permutation\", Leonard and Sheldon went to see her at the liquor store parking lot at Leonard's insistence. Leonard ended up being the person helping Amy up and walked with her as they made their way to send her back to her apartment. Amy giggled when she said that he had found \"second base\". In \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\", Stuart asked Leonard to be the guy who checks in with Sheldon regarding his response to him asking Amy out. In \"The Status Quo Combustion\", Leonard lets Sheldon go on his train trip and Amy explodes, hitting him with a pillow for letting him go. When Leonard stayed with Amy and Bernadette at a bar after they had lied to Sheldon and Penny, Leonard wondered why he and Amy didn't hang out together more often. Amy said it was weird when they did.\n\nThe two of them share some similarities: both have PhD's, both wear glasses, both had difficult childhoods caused by their mothers who they don't like (Leonard's being unaffectionate and Amy's being strict), they have both been hugged by Sheldon and he would hate to lose them, both have connections with Harvard (Leonard's brother Michael is a law professor and Amy was a student) and they are very devoted to their main lovers (Leonard = Penny & Amy = Sheldon).\n\nIn \"The Celebration Experimentation\", Sheldon ran into the bathroom after being overwhelmed by the birthday party they were throwing him. Leonard and Amy argue over who knew him better to talk to him. Leonard has known him longer, but Amy and Sheldon have seen each other naked. Penny goes instead.\n\nIn \"The Solo Oscillation\", Sheldon throws Amy out of the apartment so he can have some quiet time to work. She hangs out in Leonard and Penny's apartment and starts to bond with Leonard. They were both spelling bee champions and they bore Penny with a night of them trying to stump each other with spelling words. The next night they start reenacting old high school science projects like creating hot ice and building a wave front out of Popsicle sticks.\n\nStuart\n\nLeonard and Stuart are very friendly with each other and Leonard regularly visits him at the comic book store. Stuart has also invited Leonard over to his store for parties. Stuart went on two dates with Penny, which of course irritated Leonard to no end even though she and Leonard were not currently in a relationship. The first date was in \"The Hofstadter Isotope\". The second date in \"The Classified Materials Turbulence\", Stuart looked to Leonard for advice in dealing with Penny. Leonard tried to avoid giving him advice but finally broke down. The advice, however, turned out to be exactly how Leonard had been trying to woo Penny for the last two years - thinking that if it didn't work for him; it wouldn't for Stuart. After the date, Leonard felt really bad and finally caught up with Stuart to apologize when Stuart actually appreciated the advice and it worked great right up until they were making out and he said, \"Oh Penny!\" And instead of saying, \"Oh Stuart!\" she called him Leonard. While acting sorrowful for Stuart, Leonard was overjoyed that Penny still liked him. Throughout the rest of the series, Leonard has been shown to be very close and friendly with Stuart. In the series finale, Leonard expresses concern when Bernadette's father accidentally broke one of Stuart's ribs while hugging him.\n\nEmily Sweeney\n\nLeonard and Emily were on good terms, but haven't been seen alone together.\n\nWyatt\n\nWyatt is Penny's father and Leonard's father-in-law. Wyatt is very fond of Leonard. He sees him as the first smart boyfriend Penny has dated, while all her other boyfriends Wyatt considered losers, while Leonard is seen by Wyatt as a friendly, caring person and a successful accomplished academic. They first bond over playing Wii fishing and he begs Leonard to get back with Penny.\n\nSusan\n\nSusan is Penny's mother and Leonard's mother-in-law. Like her husband, Susan is very fond of Leonard.\n\nMary Cooper\n\nBased on her mature, kind, caring and loving nature, Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mother, appears to be Leonard's female equivalent. Leonard always likes Mary and looks up to her as he always finds his mother to be pathetic. She is the mother Leonard wished he had. In \"The Convergence Convergence\", Mary says that she has always had a special place in her heart for Leonard, taking care of Sheldon for years. It is likely she could end up becoming his stepmother because in that same episode she appears to have hooked up with his father. However, nothing happened between Alfred and Mary, much to Leonard and Sheldon's relief. Though everyone is disturbed at the thought of them still planning to maintain a friendship.\n\nBert\n\nIn \"The Geology Methodology\", Bert asks Sheldon to collaborate with him on a dark matter project involving meteorites which Sheldon likes, but is embarrassed to tell others about. When Bert learns this he stops working with Sheldon and replaces him with Leonard.\n\nIn \"The Meteorite Manifestation\", Bert wants Raj's help cutting open a meteorite with a band saw. Leonard wants to do it with his laser, but Bert declines. Leonard gets angry that he is left out. He dreams that he steals the meteorite, cuts it open turns into to a flesh eating zombie.\n\nGeorge Cooper Jr.\n\nLeonard and Sheldon visit Texas to ask his brother to come to \"Sheldon and Amy's Wedding\". Leonard helps them reconnect and George does come to the wedding. Leonard also found out that George did for Sheldon a lot of the same things that Leonard does like explaining his behavior and driving him around. Leonard and George Jr bonded and become fast friends putting up with Sheldon. George Jr. appeared again in \"The Tam Turbulence\", where he talks to Leonard, Howard and Raj via webcam about Sheldon's childhood friend Tam, whom they are curious about.\n\nRomantic\n\nLeonard is usually mildly shy around women, but unlike Sheldon, he actually cares about having a girlfriend. He is the most successful of the main four to get into relationships. Although, quite shy around women at first, not really the 'outgoing' type when it came to relationships, he soon got better with women over time. Also he believed that he had to do anything the woman wanted to stay in the relationship until Penny set him straight. He is actually his most confident when he is in a relationship, examples include:\n\nBeing very natural with Alice and indirectly asking her out when he was in a relationship with Priya. (\"The Good Guy Fluctuation\")\n\nActing very kind (and oblivious) to Alex, unknown to him that she was flirting with him, while he was in a relationship with Penny. (\"The Higgs Boson Observation\", \"The 43 Peculiarity\" and \"The Egg Salad Equivalency\")\n\nAs Howard recounts, Leonard's relationships record prior to Stephanie Barnett, excluding the woman with a PhD in French Literature, is approximated by the geometric progression\n\ny = 27 d a y s 12 n {\\displaystyle y = \\frac{27days}{12^{n}}}\n\nwhere n = 0, 1, 2; twenty-seven days with Joyce Kim, two booty calls with Leslie Winkle (2.25 days), and a three-hour dinner with Penny which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down (4.5 hours). His relationship with Stephanie should have ended after twenty minutes (22.5 minutes for n = 3).\n\nJoyce Kim\n\nMain article: Joyce Kim\n\nJoyce Kim was one of Leonard's relationships that was widely talked about in his social circle, but was never seen until a flashback in \"The Staircase Implementation\". A North Korean spy who attempted to get information on the US government project Leonard was working on (a type of Rocket Fuel). The relationship lasted only 27 days before Joyce defected back to North Korea\n\nPenny\n\nMain article: Leonard and Penny\n\nLeonard is instantly captivated by the presence of Penny during the \"Pilot\", and from that moment he sets his mission to date her. By the end of the pilot episode, he has already announced to Sheldon \"our babies will be smart and beautiful.\" Sheldon is quick to add, \"not to mention imaginary\" though by series end, Penny is pregnant.\n\nHis infatuation with Penny becomes the major force that drives the series during the first season. They did go out to dinner one night with Penny thinking that the other guys were going to join them and Leonard making excuses for them. She asks later at her door if this night was a date; however, Leonard denies it though he doesn't mean it. At the season one finale, Leonard finally managed to ask Penny out, and they had their first date after Penny has a bad breakup.\n\nSubsequently, they broke up because Penny felt she wasn't as smart as Leonard would like and that she'd need a college degree to date Leonard. On another occasion, during the visit of Leonard's mother, Leonard and Penny came very close to having sex, but he ruined the moment by talking about their childhood issues with his mother and her father, respectively.\n\nIn the second-season finale, when the guys were going on a 3-month scientific expedition, Penny finally showed strong interest in Leonard, but kept her feelings a secret. Out of hearing range, Penny admits to herself that she wishes for him to stay.\n\nIn the third-season premiere, Leonard and Penny finally started a romantic relationship kissing him as soon as he returned and making love for the first time. They remain to have a stable relationship and even had the blessing from his mother during her second appearance during the episode, \"The Maternal Congruence\".\n\nThe relationship eventually came to an end during \"The Wheaton Recurrence\" after Penny was not able to tell Leonard that she loved him as well (Although, Penny had been manipulated by Wil Wheaton to end the relationship and rush out, forcing Sheldon's team to forfeit a bowling match.) Leonard and Penny decided during \"The Spaghetti Catalyst\" that they should stay friends even though they broke up (for Sheldon's sake).

He told Howard and Leonard to keep their women in line. Leonard responded that he should not be the person to do that since he was no longer Penny's boyfriend.

Penny actually had to pay for her own ticket after Leonard pointed out that they were not on a date and sex was off the table. Later at Brady's Beer they start to argue and interfere with the people they are trying to flirt with. Back at home Leonard told that he did not think they were ready to go out as friends and apologized for his behavior. Penny apologized too, but said that she liked the take-charge and cocky Leonard.\n\nOn the spur of the moment in \"The Recombination Hypothesis\", Leonard asks Penny out on a date after he imagined what getting back with her might be like. Their real date ends successfully and they agreed to take their relationship slow in \"The Beta Test Initiation\", by treating it as a Beta test and present Bug reports to each other to settle any issues arising.\n\nIn \"The Friendship Contraction\", things seem to move along well with their second attempt at a relationship. During a blackout at the apartment, Leonard decided to hang out at Penny's and they had wine, played with a bubble wrap, and attempted to make out before being interrupted by Sheldon.\n\nIn \"The Werewolf Transformation\", Penny learns the game of chess and beats Leonard the first time she plays.

Acting she get upset, then lets him do it realizing that he is a wild stallion that needs to run free.\n\nIn \"The Launch Acceleration\", Penny suggested that they move up their relationship and get intimate; however, Leonard ruins the mood when he asks her to marry him.

Penny tells him that she cannot believe that he cannot trust her and that he embarrassed her in front of Cole who knew who he was since his picture is on her refrigerator. Penny continues to tell him that he is the one she is with and accidentally mentions that he knows that she loves him. Leonard is stunned and tells her that that is the first she ever said that. Penny rushes off to work before she starts crying.\n\nIn \"The Egg Salad Equivalency\", after Alex asks Leonard out to dinner and didn't tell Penny about it, she begins to feel really insecure about their relationship. Leonard apologizes by showing up at her door playing a little ditty on his cello. She decided instead of feeling bad, she would do something about it.

Then she buys some geek glasses to look smart, which does have a positive effect on Leonard as he takes her into his bedroom.\n\nIn \"The Spoiler Alert Segmentation\", Sheldon really makes Leonard mad and he says that he wants to live with Penny and not some crazy person.

Penny feels that all the efforts never meet the expectations and she will end up disappointed. At dinner, Penny sees an old boyfriend proposing to the girl that broke them up.

Later after they barely say good night, Leonard tells Penny that she ruined the whole evening. Penny finally admits that she has commitment issues. She is so happy right now that she knows they are going to eventually get married and since it is forever, that scares her. Leonard then puts the responsibility of proposing on her and that she should do it when she's ready. In the end, she does ask him to be her valentine.\n\nIn \"The Closure Alternative\", Penny was concerned about the passion Leonard showed for science, comics and various television shows while she had no passion in her life. Her dreams had always been to become a famous movie star and live a glamorous life. Anything less than that she felt was settling. Her epiphany comes that she is passionate about her boyfriend Leonard and all her wonderful friends.\n\nIn \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\", Leonard takes a job working on a Stephen Hawking expedition in the North Sea for four months over the summer. Penny will miss him, but knows that it is a good opportunity and sends him off. At the airport, she is fussing over him like a wife sending him off on a business trip. She also has to watch Sheldon over the summer, too.\n\nIn \"The Hofstadter Insufficiency\", Leonard hurts Penny because he seems to be having such a great time on the ship; she thinks that he is not even missing her.

It works until Amy and Sheldon find them together after they think that Penny is cheating on Leonard.\n\nIn \"The Raiders Minimization\", Penny purchases a psychology that Beverly Hofstadter has written about all his problems growing up.

Leonard mentions that Penny never does anything like that, except for sex which doesn't count. Penny is determined to romance Leonard. Raj can only suggest that she cook for him or reenact a scene from a romantic movie. Finally after a candlelight dinner, Penny puts on some romantic music, spreads rose petals into her neatly cleaned bedroom and presents Leonard with a first edition of his favorite book from when he was growing up, \"The Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy\". Unfortunately, Leonard had already purchased the book after they had seen it in a used bookstore together. Penny gets upset telling him about all the thoughtful things he had done for her and shows him her collection.\n\nAn airplane ticket, a rose given to her \"just because\" and the eleven-page letter he wrote her after the first time they slept together. Leonard was very touched that she kept all these things. He then kisses her, showing that Penny did do something romantic.\n\nIn \"The Thanksgiving Decoupling\", Penny reminisces about a Thanksgiving she had in Las Vegas with former boyfriend Zack Johnson which included one of those silly fake weddings. Penny appears devastated when her friends inform her that the wedding was real and she is Mrs. Zack Johnson. Penny and Leonard argue about how quickly she should get her annulment so Penny invites Zack over to their Thanksgiving dinner at Howard's mother. Zack appears as dimwitted as ever telling them that breaking up can be hard on the kids which they don't have. Finally, Penny and Leonard make up and she tells him that the next time she gets married it will be for real, for life and (jokingly) or for money and lovingly strokes his chin.\n\nIn \"The Cooper Extraction\", Amy points out to the gang that most of them would not know each other if Sheldon had not been part of their lives. Penny feels that Leonard would never have successfully asked her out at the Cheesecake Factory, while Leonard suggests that she would have ended up with Zack. In the Zack story, he spent all the rent money on some magic beans. Leonard might have moved in with Raj; however, he thinks that he would be eating Raj's cooking too much and would be overweight since he didn't have a girlfriend. In Stuart's fantasy, he ends up with Penny.\n\nIn \"The Hesitation Ramification\" and \"The Occupation Recalibration\", Penny gets a part in the TV series \"NCIS\" and is very disappointed when her scene is cut and not aired. Frustrated and tipsy, she sees her life crumbling when Leonard reminds her that she still has him. She agrees with him and probably to show some advancement in her life, she kneels down and proposes to him. All Leonard can utter is \"Umm\", much like when he wouldn't succumb to her drunk advances after her Halloween party in \"The Middle-Earth Paradigm\".\n\nPenny gets very upset since she doesn't think he wants to marry her. After she storms out, Leonard is afraid to ask her if their relationship is now over. The next day/episode he does visit Penny who assures him that they are still together and that he did the right thing not agreeing to her proposal because she was a mess. Now she has rethought her career and decides to quit the Cheesecake Factory and focus all of her time on acting. Leonard does support her though he is obviously worried about her to give up her only source of income. The proposal count currently is two to one.\n\nIn \"The Table Polarization\", the gang wants to add a dining room table to Apartment 4A which Sheldon objects to. Penny gets Leonard to pick out a dining set that she likes and gets Leonard to stand up more against Sheldon. Sheldon objects to Penny changing Leonard to stand up against him. Penny points out that Amy has changed Sheldon who agrees and then decides to break up with Amy.\n\nIn \"The Mommy Observation\", Penny seems to feel that if she were a successful actress and had to move around, Leonard would leave his job even if it was a tenured position to follow her since she would be making more money. They get complimented when Stuart says that they are the best couple he knows.\n\nIn \"The Proton Transmogrification\" Penny asks Leonard to marry her to get their marriage proposal rejection score from 2 to 1 to even.

Penny wants to start making smarter decisions about her life. She says that they could get married and Leonard asks her to be serious. Leonard asks her if he is a smart decision, like choosing a healthy boring bran muffin. Penny doesn't care what pastry he is because she is CHOOSING HIM. Leonard is still talking about being a pastry like a strawberry Pop Tart that she is excited about. Penny tells him to forget about it. Leonard does want to marry her, but feels that she is just feeling sorry for herself because she was fired. Penny explains that it may seem that way, but getting fired made her think that fame and fortune is not what is going make her happy. Leonard wants to know what she needs. \"You, you stupid Pop Tart!\" Leonard finally says that he guesses that he is in, which also bothers Penny. Leonard then retorts that it is an excited \"I guess I'm in!\" and they agree that they are engaged which seems somewhat anti-climactic.\n\nTo change the mood, Leonard pulls a ring out of his wallet that he has had for a couple of years, gets down on one knee and asks Penny formally. Penny says \"yes\" and he slips the ring on her finger that still has ape hair glued to it and they embrace.\n\nIn \"The Status Quo Combustion\", Leonard and Penny announce their engagement; however, the gang is more excited about Raj and Emily hooking up. Leonard goes searching for the missing Sheldon and finds him at the railroad station leaving town to think about all the changes in his life. Leonard wants him to come home, but Penny convinces him that he should let him go.\n\nIn \"The First Pitch Insufficiency\", they go on a double-date with Shamy where Sheldon is bragging about their relationship is so much better than theirs. Shamy has an 8.2 out of ten for relationship stability based upon well-proven criteria. Leonard looks at it; however, Penny doesn't want to take the test. She already has his doubts and doesn't need them confirmed. They are engaged and still have very little in common which scares her. It also scares Leonard, but he still wants to face all their problems together. His reassurance really touches Penny and Amy who would like Sheldon to say things like that.\n\nIn \"The Prom Equivalency\", Amy and Bernadette throw a do-over prom on the roof of the apartment building. Penny is at first reluctant to attend the party because they always disappoint her, but Leonard tells her that he really wants to take the most beautiful girl to the prom, this time. She wears her old red prom dress. The roof is decorated wonderfully and Penny really gets into the mood. While others are still getting there, Penny and Leonard dance along without any music on the roof. First, they conclude that they probably would not have approached each other if they had been at the same prom. They are both definitely in a romantic mood, while Penny is also glad they aren't having the drama normally seen at proms.\n\nIn \"The Space Probe Disintegration\", Leonard tells Sheldon that his attitude is why he and Penny are not living together. After a tearful period thinking about them him moving out, Sheldon lets him go one night a week to stay at Penny's. Sheldon still sleeps on her couch that night.\n\nIn \"The Commitment Determination\", Sheldon keeps pushing them for a wedding date. The couple insists that they aren't in a hurry, are in a good place emotionally and are concentrating on their careers. Thinking about the wedding details they decide on a small church wedding dressed in black tie tuxes and no releasing of butterflies. Suddenly Penny smiles and sits closer to Leonard. She tell shim that she's free that night. They could go to Vegas and just get married. Leonard agrees. Sheldon is happy for them, but still doesn't want them to sit in his spot. Driving to Vegas, Penny is very happy and glad that they took their time to get to know each other. No surprises and no regrets. Leonard has one regret, from where he was drunk and made out with a woman on his North Sea expedition. Penny was not happy, but still wants to marry him.\n\nIn \"The Matrimonial Momentum\", Leonard and Penny are at a wedding chapel, and decide on their wedding package, which includes a live stream that allows their friends to watch from home. In the chapel, the minister asks Leonard and Penny if they had prepared vows. Penny is surprised that Leonard has and he says that they are made from atoms that have travelled over 14 billion years to create them so they can come together as a couple and make each other whole, which overwhelms Penny. Penny sweetly says that he is the love of her life and her best friend and improvises, quoting the lyrics to 'You've Got a Friend in Me' from the Disney film \"Toy Story\". The minister asked if that was from \"Toy Story,\" Penny says it was and Leonard loves it. Leonard gets misty-eyed and confirms that he does. Leonard and Penny are pronounced man and wife. Unfortunately, Stuart and Howard are the only ones remaining who catch it, due to Sheldon insulting Amy, causing her to finally break up with him, causing most of the group to leave. Leonard decides to carry Penny across the threshold into the suite, but huffs and puffs as he carries his wife into the hotel room. They kiss, but Penny still can't stop thinking about Mandy, the girl on the boat. Leonard again insists that the kissing wasn't that great, especially since he also chipped her tooth. Penny wants to know if he feels guilty. Leonard jokingly says that he does not feel guilty because the girl had dental insurance. Leonard then adds that he does feel guilty when he sees her every day at work, freezing when he quickly realizes his mistake. Penny is now truly shocked that he never told her this fact. Instead of spending the night in Vegas, they return to their apartments, still fighting. Leonard sadly spends his wedding night with Sheldon, who isn't surprised at all.\n\nIn \"The Separation Oscillation\", Leonard finally confronts Mandy, his kissing buddy from the North Sea, about the incident and it doesn't seem to mean much to her. Leonard also realizes that he really was trying to sabotage the relationship. He talks with Penny and tells her. She too realizes the she has been trying to sabotage their relationship. Leonard then confesses, \"I've loved you from the moment we met and I will keep loving you until the end of time.\" Penny is very touched and tells him that that was the most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to her. He follows with getting down on one knee and asks, \"Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?\" She accepts and they reconcile, kiss and head into the bedroom to formalize their marriage.\n\nIn \"The 2003 Approximation\", Leonard finally moves out of his apartment and eventually moves in with Penny into her apartment. The sleeping arrangements are still a little complicated. Even though they are living together in 4B, they sometimes sleep in 4A, in Leonard's old room. This is due to Penny having a change of heart at the last minute after feeling sorry for Sheldon who was having a hard time dealing with his breakup with Amy and Leonard moving out. In \"The Helium Insufficiency\" it is also apparent that Leonard is still maintaining an office in 4A.\n\nIn \"The Valentino Submergence\", Leonard and Penny go out to dinner for Valentine's Day but the wait is at least one hour and they suffer through an unsympathetic maitre d'.
