        "text": "\"Precision flying was the order of the day. Mustangs of the four Territorial Air'“Force squadrons and Vampires of 75 Squadron, based at Ohakea, made several runs over the field in various formations. Qualified observers said the flying of these machines was as good as any in the world.\n\nAfter the heavier aircraft, a Hastings of 40 Squadron, three Bristol Freighters of 41 Squadron, and Dakotas and Devons of 42 Squadron had taken off and flown past, the Vampires appeared in three close flights, all in perfect formation.\n\nA Bristol Freighter came back to show how supplies are dropped by parachute, and it was hardly away before the Harvardaerobatic team had taken off.\n\nArmy Guns\n\nAcross the field from the public, and probably unnoticed by most, the Army had placed batteries of 3.7 in and Bofors anti-aircraft guns. Territorial Mustangs staged a surprise low-level attack on the field and were met by clouds of black smoke and the bangs of blank cartridges from the guns.\n\nAerobatics were shown by four units during the day. The first was the Mustang, then the Harvards, and next the team of four Vampires from 75 Squadron. Leading this highly-skilled flight was Flying Officer S. Mclntyre, of Wellington, with Flight Lieutenant M. Beavis, RAF, Sergeant-Pilot J. E. Shaw, of Wellington, and Sergeant-Pilot A. Dyer, of Auckland.\n\nWith the exception of Flight Lieutenant Beavis, who is on exchange to the squadron, all the pilots in this team have served with 14 Squadron in Cyprus. Their flying on Saturday was of the highest order: one senior officer was heard to say that he had not seen any team in Britain which could do better.\n\nThe final effort in the flying programme by New Zealand pilots was a highly spectacular rocket-firing run by three Vampires. The searing roar of the rockets firing, the thuds and clouds of dust as they struck the earth, and over all this the shrill whine of the jet engines, brought the show to a fine close.\n\nAustralians’ Display\n\nThen it was the turn of the Australian visitors to the station to show off their machines. The Canberra, the first of the type built in Australia, and piloted by Flight Lieutenant C. G. Kilsby, with Flight Lieutenant G. Hughes as navigator, rolled off along the runway with a loud, but dignified roar. Slow runs and high speed runs, punctuated with tight, banking turns, showed off the high manoeuvrability of the machine.\n\nThe huge dark blue Neptune, piloted by Flight Lieutenant R. E. Graham, was astonishing. Its wheels had hardly cleared the runway before it banked away to fly low over the field, jinking from side to side; and then it climbed away so sharply that it seemed almost to go straight up. The Neptune’s landing was delayed slightly by the departure of the Governor-General for Auckland in the Royal Dakota.\n\nBoth before and after the flying display No. 4 hangar on the station, where the static exhibition of the work done by ground units of the Air Force was placed, was packed tight. For the first tune since Air Force stations have held special open days each section arranged a stall and created within the hangar a scene rather like an industries fair. Every stand was manned by helpful airmen, and the thousands of visitors gained an excellent impression of the work done on Air Force stations."
