        "text": "No. 82 Wing is the Royal Australian Air Force's strike and reconnaissance wing. It is headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and operates the F/A-18F Super Hornet multirole fighter and Pilatus PC-9 forward air control aircraft. The wing was formed in August 1944, flying B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. After the war it re-equipped with Avro Lincolns and, from 1953, English Electric Canberra jets. Both saw action in the Malayan Emergency; the Canberras were also deployed in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971. Between 1970 and 1973, as a stop-gap pending delivery of the long-delayed General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, the wing flew leased F-4E Phantoms. It then operated the F-111C for the next 37 years through numerous upgrades, augmented in the mid-1990s by ex-USAF G models, before retiring the type in 2010.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n1.1 World War II\n\n1.2 Cold War and after\n\n2 Notes\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nHistory\n\nWorld War II\n\nSee also: B-24 Liberators in Australian service\n\nNo. 82 (Heavy Bomber) Wing—the RAAF's first—was formed at Ballarat, Victoria, on 25 August 1944.[3] Comprising Nos. 21 and 24 Squadrons, both equipped with B-24 Liberators, the wing became operational on 11 January 1945. By this time it was headquartered in the Northern Territory, and came under the control of the RAAF’s North Western Area Command (NWA). Based at Fenton Airfield, the wing's aircraft sank seven Japanese ships in the Dutch East Indies during March.[4] On 6 April, all of its available Liberators joined B-25 Mitchells of No. 79 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. Anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, as well as attacks by enemy fighters, resulted in the loss of two Liberators, and the crews' standard of aerial gunnery was criticised afterwards. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the following day.[5] Later that month, No. 23 Squadron, having recently converted to Liberators from Vultee Vengeances, was added to the wing's strength.[6]\n\nThe Liberators of No. 82 Wing played both a tactical and a strategic bombing role in the Borneo Campaign to free the Dutch East Indies from Japanese occupation, beginning with the lead-up to Operation Oboe One, the invasion of Tarakan on 1 May 1945. During the month a detachment relocated from Fenton to Morotai, attacking targets in Celebes and Balikpapan prior to Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan.[7][8] In June, while the final Allied offensive of the Borneo Campaign got under way as Operation Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan, the remainder of No. 82 Wing transferred from NWA to the command of the Australian First Tactical Air Force in Morotai.[9] In the middle of the month the wing dropped 120 tons of bombs on Balikpapan's oil fields and surrounding areas, as well as coastal defence sites.[7] During July it bombed targets at Celebes and Borneo, losing five Liberators for the month. Just before the end of hostilities in the Pacific, the recently established garrison headquarters No. 11 Group unofficially directed the wing's operations.[10] Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, No. 82 Wing's Liberators were converted to transports and used to repatriate RAAF personnel from the South West Pacific.[11]\n\nCold War and after\n\nNo. 82 Wing moved to its present location at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in 1946.[12] No. 482 (Maintenance) Squadron was formed in May that year to be responsible for repair and upkeep of the wing's aircraft.[13] Its flying complement now included Nos. 12 (formerly of No. 85 Wing), 21, and 23 Squadrons, but these were renumbered Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively in February 1948. By this time the wartime Liberators had been replaced by Avro Lincoln heavy bombers.[14][15] During 1949–50, some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the Royal Air Force gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the Soviet Union. From 1952 to 1956, the Lincolns flew observation flights in connection with British atomic tests in Australia.[16]\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, No. 82 Wing aircraft were heavily involved in overseas deployments. Between 1950 and 1958—for the first two years under the control of No. 90 (Composite) Wing—the Lincolns of No. 1 Squadron were tasked with the prime responsibility for the Commonwealth's bombing campaign against Communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency.[17][18] In December 1953, No. 82 Wing took delivery of the RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra, which over the next five years re-equipped all three of the wing's squadrons.[19] The new bombers were acquired partly for their capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the RAAF seriously investigated but never implemented.[20] Following the re-equipping of Nos. 2 and 6 Squadrons with the Canberra, a Lincoln Conversion Flight was formed in July 1955 under No. 82 Wing to provide training on the older bomber for crews preparing to deploy to Malaya for service with No. 1 Squadron; it disbanded in March 1956.[21] Canberras from No. 2 Squadron relieved the Lincolns of No. 1 Squadron in Malaya during 1958, and saw extensive action in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971. During the latter conflict they flew almost 12,000 sorties and delivered over 76,000 pounds of bombs, for the loss of two aircraft to enemy action.[22] Between 1970 and 1973, while awaiting the delayed delivery of General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bombers, Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms, while No. 2 Squadron continued to operate the Canberra until disbanding in 1982.[19][23] Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and highly regarded by its RAAF crews.[24]\n\nIn June 1973 the wing accepted its first F-111Cs, which it continued to operate over the next 37 years through numerous upgrades, including the Pave Tack infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, and advanced digital avionics.[25][26] Roles within the wing were demarcated such that No. 1 Squadron was the lead strike unit, while No. 6 Squadron was primarily tasked with flying reconnaissance missions using specially modified RF-111Cs, and providing crew conversion training. In 1992 an order was placed to augment the F-111 force with 15 ex-USAF G models, operated by No. 6 Squadron.[26][27] As \"the region's pre-eminent strike aircraft\", the F-111 has been described as the most important acquisition in the RAAF's history.[28] The closest they came to being used in anger, however, was during the Australian-led INTERFET intervention into East Timor in September 1999. Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, to support the international forces, and remained there until December. From 20 September, when INTERFET began to arrive in East Timor, the aircraft were maintained at a high level of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. In the event, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by the RF-111Cs from 5 November through 9 December.[29]\n\nNo. 482 (Maintenance) Squadron merged with Amberley's No. 3 Aircraft Depot to form No. 501 Wing in December 1991, the squadron's disbandment taking pace in June the following year.[13] From 2001, Boeing Australia performed all F-111 maintenance under a contract to the Federal government.[30] In February 2002, No. 82 Wing came under the control of the newly established Air Combat Group (ACG), formed by merging Tactical Fighter Group and Strike Reconnaissance Group. The merger altered the wing's responsibilities, as it transferred lead-in training for the F-111s to No. 78 Wing at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, and put No. 82 Wing in charge of the strike capability of No. 81 Wing's F/A-18 Hornets, also based at Williamtown. No. 82 Wing's role was reiterated as \"precision strike and reconnaissance\"; the Forward Air Control Development Unit (FACDU), flying Pilatus PC-9s, was added to its strength.[31][32] FACDU was merged with the RAAF Special Tactics Project in July 2009 to form No. 4 Squadron.[33] In 2007, the Australian Government decided to retire all of the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets as an \"interim\" replacement, pending the arrival of the under-development F-35 Lightning II.[34][35] No. 82 Wing began re-equipping with the Super Hornet in 2010, and the last F-111s were retired on 3 December that year.[36][37] Also in 2010, the wing became home to No. 5 Flight, which is responsible for training personnel to operate the RAAF's two IAI Heron unmanned aerial vehicles based at Kandahar in Afghanistan.[38] In 2011 the RAAF acquired a third Heron, based in Australia and operated by No. 5 Flight for training purposes.[39]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAir Power Development Centre (September 2008). \"Superbase #1: RAAF Amberley Past to Future\" (PDF).
