        "text": "U.S. Pacific Command's Professional Development Reading and Movie List\n\nCOM PACOM Professional Development Reading List (PDF)\n\nAdm. Harry Harris, Jr. U.S. Navy, U.S. Pacific Command, OCT. 11, 2016\n\n“I hope you have time in your busy lives to read books and watch movies, both for personal enjoyment (my #1 reason!) and for some professional development. This list is a selection of good books -- novels and non-fiction -- and movies that tries to reflect the breadth and depth of issues that cover what we all do at United States Pacific Command (USPACOM). There are thousands of great, good, and not-so-good books and movies about the Indo-Asia-Pacific out there, but I wanted to keep the list manageable, relevant and, importantly, fun. I deliberately left off some of the tomes that students might confront in graduate school or Professional Military Education/War College, such as anything by Clausewitz, Thucydides, and Mahan. As essential as they may be, none of them kept me up at night! I hope that you'll take the time to discuss these works within your professional and personal circles.
