Road transport to RAAF Amberley.\n\nWas used for ground training including fuel tank de-seal/re-seal training.\n\nDespite its historical significance 63-9768 was scrapped and its fuselage buried at Swanbank landfill site near Ipswich 11/2011. 67-0106 A1-151 F-111A Ex USAF.

The fuselage ended up in its final resting place, on jacks, and the teardown inspection is about to begin. The inspection was designed to help identify fatigue & corrosion problems which may impact on the Australian fleet through to the (then) planned withdrawal date (PWD) of 2020. The teardown will mean dismemberment of the fuselage down to the individual component level with extensive Non Destructive Testing and fractography on all structurally significant parts and previously identified DADTA control points. It was envisaged to take between 2 to 3 years to complete the project, all parts were stored until the F-111's withdrawal date.\n\nAircraft scrapped although some components are believed to be in the hands of private collectors. 67-0107 A1-152 F-111A Ex USAF\n\nRetired to AMARC 17/07/91 (Inventory No. AAFV0066).\n\nIdentified by RAAF as an attrition aircraft, but failed fatigue test prior to delivery.\n\nAirframe remained in at AMARC.\n\nSold to HVF West, Tuscon 01/08/2008 and scrapped 68-0246 B1-18 FB-111A Ex USAF FB-111A.\n\nRetired to AMARC 01/07/91 (Inventory No. AABF0008)\n\nWhen F-111G A8-291 suffered a towing accident at Amberley in 1996 the forward fuselage of FB-111A 68-0246 was imported from the AMARG boneyard intended to be used in the repair of A8-291\n\nThe forward fuselage was delivered to RAAF Base Amberley during 1997. It was complete with all cockpit equipment, Forward Equipment Bay equipment, and radome equipment in place.\n\nAs things turned out the nose wasn't needed and it was left sitting on a pallet in Hangar 410, its equipment stripped and put into the F-111 spare parts inventory\n\nSpent some time with 278SQN as a training aid\n\n2007 mounted on a trailer to aid mobility\n\nDuring 2007, the stripped and derelict 68-0246 fuselage section was transferred to 23SQN at Amberley. 23SQN members restored the fuselage section including fitting out the cockpit and fitting electrical equipment to enable operation of the interior lighting system, exterior lighting system and the intercommunications system\n\n23 Squadron's motto is \"Dauntless\" so the Dauntless Pig was born.\n\nDauntless Pig served as a recruiting aid and when the F-111s retired it went on display at RAAHC\n\n11/2014 to FAAM Nowra and displayed for a while before going into storage at Point Cook.\n\nWhen the trade of A8-132 for A8-134 came about the former had already been converted for gate guard duties. This included a completely sealed cockpit with stripped out interior and blacked out glazing.\n\n06/2018 Transferred to Edinburgh were fortunately Dauntless Pig was able to donate her vital bits to enable A8-132 to be returned to her former glory.\n\n08/2018 Dauntless Pig moved into storage at Wagga, maybe to be a future restoration project?\n\n.\n\nRest of aircraft remained at AMARC,\n\nSold to HVF West, Tuscon 02/03/2009 and scrapped"
