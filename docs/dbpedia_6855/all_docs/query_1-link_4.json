Type Aircraft History A84-1 B.2 Built by English Electric 08/05/51 c/n 71015 (one of 631 built by English Electric Co. at Preston).\n\nAllocated RAF serial WD935.\n\nSeventh production B.2.\n\nDelivered to Vickers Armstrong's Guided Weapons Division test section 08/08/51.\n\nIt was selected to be the missile launch platform for the Red Dean missile trials.\n\nRAAF Serial A84-1 allocated 27/11/51 pending aircraft being loaned to Weapons Research Establishment (WRE) for trails on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defense.\n\nRAAF crew Geoff Tuck & Geoff Wilson did a training flight on this at Hurn 5/12/51 prior to delivering A84-2 to Australia.\n\nModified to carry missiles under wings.\n\nConversion completed 10/53 with first test flight with missiles 01/54.\n\nOn 21/09/55 it suffered brake failure after landing at Wisley airfield and ended up damaged in a field.\n\nWD935 remained in the UK and the A84-1 serial was not applied.\n\nServed with RAF untill going into store at St Athan 23/11/71.\n\nAllocated Instructional Airframe serial 8440M in 1976.\n\nSold at auction in 09/89.\n\nScrapped 23/11/89.\n\nNose section on display at the South Yorkshire Aviation Museum Aeroventure Park, Doncaster, UK. A84-2 B.2 Built by English Electric 29/05/51 c/n 71024\n\nAllocated RAF serial WD942.\n\nDelivered to Vickers Armstrong 28/09/51.\n\nAircraft loaned to WRE for trials on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence and allocated RAAF serial A84-2.\n\nGeoff Tuck & Geoff Wilson ferried this aircraft from Hurn to Laverton 12/03/52.\n\nFlight time to Darwin was a record 20hr 20 mins & to Laverton in 24.20. Average ground speed 450 knots.\n\nGeoff Wilson adds \"My logbook continually referred to A84-2 but I am pretty sure it carried only the WD942 number. I recall I used callsign MP-RGD on the flight home. Comms were a lot of fun - several times we arrived before the departure signal was received and Bombay would not accept that we were cruising at 48000ft or that we had a groundspeed of 450-500 knots! They reckoned my Morse Code was in error! Jets were very rare over India in 1952. The Indonesians were unbelieving also.\"\n\nThe starboard tiptank nose was crumpled by a bird strike in the Laverton circuit area.\n\nIn 05/52 the aircraft was taken to Woomera to commence the Blue Boar TV Guided Bomb trials.\n\nIt may have worn its RAAF serial during this time.\n\nDuring 10/53 it lent an nose wheel oleo to Canberra A84-201 which was competing in the London to Christchurch Air Race.\n\nIn 03/55 it was modified for proposed use in the flight trial program of the Red Dean air to air missile.\n\nHowever in early 1956 the Red Dean missile was cancelled and the aircraft was returned to its standard configuration.\n\nIt was returned to Air Ministry charge 06/12/56 and reverted to its RAF serial WD942.\n\nIt remained in Australia and was held on a custodial basis at DAP Parafield from 21/12/56 to 21/01/57.\n\nIt was loaned to de Havilland's at No.12 Joint Services Trials Unit at Woomera until it was returned to the UK 03/10/57.\n\nWent to the MoS Air Weapons Research Establishment at Shoeburyness 16/04/62.\n\nBelieved destroyed on the weapons range. A84-3 B.2 Built by English Electric 27/02/53 c/n 71179.\n\nAllocated RAF serial WH710.\n\nAircraft loaned to WRE arriving at Woomera on 02/06/53.\n\nAllocated A84-3 on 13/06/53. Not known if RAAF Serial was applied.\n\nIt was returned to RAF 07/58.\n\nThis aircraft was later converted to a U.10 drone and returned to Australia.\n\n(Also see RAF serials Canberra page.). A84-125 B.2\n\nMk.21 Built by English Electric c/n 71053.\n\nDiverted off RAF contract (serial WD983).\n\nAllocated to RAAF 16/03/51.\n\nConflicting reports have this aircraft was flown from the UK by either SQNLDR Peter Raw & FLGOFF Bill Kerr or SQNLDR P Fisher and FLTLT J Sharp\n\nMichael Hamerston adds \"I can confirm that A84-125 was not ferried by SqLdr Raw in 1952. His first Canberra flight was with Cuming on 22 April 1953 in preparation for the Air Race. You may be interested to know that Peter Raw took delivery of both A84-201 and 202 from Avalon on 1 July 1953 and 27 August 1953 respectively. Both were flown to Laverton for use by #1 Long Range Flight. On a flight to Perth (pilot, Peter Raw) on 29 August 1953, 201 diverted to Kalgoorlie. The following day, 201 completed Kalgoorlie-Perth-Laverton. It flew again on 3 September (pilot, Peter Raw) after an engine change (presumably the cause for diversion to Kalgoorlie).\"\n\nFrom 05/53 it was used by No.1 Long Range Flight at Laverton in the preparations for the entries in the 10/53 England to New Zealand Air Race.\n\nIt was later converted by GAF to Mk.21 trainer configuration, first flight 09/02/59, re-delivered 10/06/59.\n\nEntered RAAF Amberley restoration hangar 01/03.\n\nWas held for the proposed but stillborn NASMA.\n\nOn static display Amberley Airshow 10/04\n\nCurrently at RAAF Amberley, Qld.\n\nA84-125 is another Canberra we do not have an RAAF Aircraft Status card for.\n\nToday the tail shows ARDU markings showing through from under the 2 Squadron flash.\n\nAs the second Canberra bought on charge it is almost certain to have served with ARDU as did A84-307 before it and A84-201 after it.\n\nA84-201 Mk.20\n\nMk.21 First Australian built GAF Canberra.\n\nFirst flight was on 29/5/53, piloted by John Mills.\n\nFitted with Avon Mk.1 RA.3 engines.\n\nAircraft equivalent to RAF B.2 specification\n\nThe GAF Canberra Mk.20 is often referred to by the technically incorrect designation B.20. This is from a British based system and the RAAF official documentation refers to the Australian built Canberra bomber as Mark 20 and the trainer conversion Mark 21 (Marks 22 to 24 were also allocated for further GAF produced Canberra but these were not built).\n\nDelivered to RAAF 02/07/53.\n\nMichael Hamerston adds \" Peter Raw took delivery of both A84-201 and 202 from Avalon on 1 July 1953 and 27 August 1953 respectively.

Cat.5 damage.\n\nApproved for conversion to components \"in situ\" 10/65.\n\nBruce Budd adds \"I was an ATC officer on exercise in Darwin at the time with fighters from Williamtown. Although I didn't see the incident, I was on the field some minutes later. The aircraft was taking off on the northerly runway (I don't remember the number) and suffered compressor stalls on at least one engine just before lift off. I think that there was a crosswind component on the runway. It was carrying 4 x 1,000lb live bombs. The pilot aborted the take-off but was unable to stop before the end of the runway. The aircraft continued off the end of the runway wiping out various ILS installations before dropping over a small concrete wall and breaking its fuselage just in front of the bomb bay as it came to a halt. As it did so, at least 2 of the bombs broke loose and came to rest some distance from the aircraft. The crew evacuated the aircraft very quickly, the pilot swearing that he had the nav's bootprint on the top of his helmet. I don't think this was ever substantiated. Fortunately the aircraft didn't burn, the ejection seats didn't fire and the bombs did not explode. However, Darwin was closed for some considerable time while the bombs were disarmed and the runway swept clear of a large quantity of metal shavings from the Canberra's brakes.\"\n\nJohn Tyrrell, who was a Flying Officer at the time adds \" I was the navigator in A84-213 when it crashed on takeoff in Darwin. FLTLT Peter Jones was the pilot. I jettisoned the navigator's hatch - the top half of the compartment - and left that way. Peter left the same way some time later.\"\n\nRemains were taken to Leanyer Range, Darwin for use as a target.\n\nStill present in 1975 however all traces had been removed by 1984.

Pinches ejected near Quang Tri, Vietnam at 14,000 ft and 290 kts, suffering various moderate to serious injuries and were rescued 27 hours later. RAAF Ejection number 39.\n\nA report at the time states \" On 14 March 1971 Wg Cdr Downing was flying Canberra Bomber A84-228 with 32334 Flight Lieutenant (Flt Lt) Allen John Pinches when their aircraft was hit by two SA-2. Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). Downing and Pinches were both able to eject out of the aircraft, which had suffered critical damage but were not rescued until 27 hours later. The two Australian airmen were winched to safety by a US Army rescue helicopter and taken to the hospital at Quang Tri as both had sustained injuries on ejection. Wg Cdr Downing had a fractured kneecap and Flt Lt Pinches fractured vertebrae in the lower back. Later, after being transferred to a hospital at Da Nang and then Vung Tau, the two were flown back to Australia for a protracted convalescence.\" A84-229 Mk.20 First flight 22/11/56.\n\nDelivered 23/04/57.\n\nServed with 6 Squadron\n\nServed with 2 Squadron based at Butterworth Malaysia.\n\nServed with ARDU at Laverton in a variety of paint schemes\n\nNoel Fenton reports \"When Canberra A84-229 was at ARDU (1959), it was undergoing trials (deployed to Darwin) relating to the venting to atmosphere of the fuselage fuel tanks. Unfortunately, the test engineer (we used to call him NASA as at that time, everything NASA did, did not work) installed the vents incorrectly, ie., the wrong way around. During flight tests, instead of venting to atmosphere, No3 fuselage fuel tank was pressurised and expanded into the bomb-bay fouling the elevator and rudder control rods and caused the 'freezing' of control of the elevator and rudder. The pilot (a USAF Major on exchange to ARDU) landed the aircraft using the electric trim on both control surfaces. As well, the fuselage also 'expanded' giving what we called a Canberra with an 'area rule' fuselage. It was disassembled in Darwin and flown to Avalon in a Hercules for major repair and modification after which it was returned to ARDU. As well, I can recall the testing of the fitting of bomb hangers and supports (for 500 pound iron bombs) on the wing-tips in lieu of the tip-tanks to 229 in 1966. Initially, there were a few problems relating to stress at the wing-tip, but these were overcome. The bombs were dropped using the wing-tip fuel tank 'dump' button and was prior to Canberra being deployed to Vietnam. There are many 'photo's of Canberra in Vietnam showing this fitment.\"\n\nNoted at Edinburgh 26/04/79 wearing 2 Sqn tail fin flash\n\nStruck off 1982 at Amberley.\n\n06/82 allocated to RAAF museum in airworthy condition.\n\nIn exchange for A84-229 Aero Nostalgia provided a Lockheed Ventura for the RAAF museum.\n\nAero Nostalgia was unable to take delivery and it remained at Amberley from 1982 untill 1990 when Steve Picatti purchased it from Aero Nostalgia and ferried it to USA 08/08/90 as N20AN. Now N229CA.\n\nAppeared at Oshkosh 07/1991.\n\nReturned to Australia to appear at the 1991 RAAF Richmond airshow, 1992 Avalon International Airshow and perform at the Adelaide Formula One Grand Prix on 05/11/92.\n\nReturned to USA during 03/93.\n\nReported as subject of legal dispute and ownership changed to Tom Leek.\n\nReportedly damaged when it suffered an accidental landing gear retraction whilst parked.\n\nRegistered to Jack Stringer of California 28/03/00.\n\nNoted in Australian Aviation 11/04 as being parked in the GA area of Redding Airport, California as of 04/08/2004.\n\n06/2018 It would appear that 229's flying days are over. It is still parked at Reddding Airport and it has been announced that 229 will become a static display at the Redding Veteran's Museum painted black to represent an RB-57A.\n\nFurther more its spare CAC built Avon 109 engines have been acquired by Air Atlantique of Coventry UK to be fitted to Canberra WK163\n\nA84-229 is another Canberra we do not have an RAAF Aircraft Status card for. It may of gone with the aircraft to USA.\n\nWe would be grateful for a copy of it.\n\nA84-230 Mk.20 First flight 20/12/55.\n\nDelivered 27/01/56.\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Malayan Emergency.\n\nTook part in the RAAF's first jet bombing mission 03/09/58.\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Vietnam as part of USAF 35th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Phan Rang Air Base. Arrived 16/04/67 after a 2 hour flight from Butterworth, Malaysia.\n\nReturned to Darwin 04/06/71.\n\nDuring 1972/73 it was modified for cartographic survey missions (see below)\n\nStatus card shows approval granted for free issue to RAAF Assosiation 26/10/83.\n\nLast Flight 07/11/83 from RAAF Base Amberey Qld. to RAAF Base Pearce, Bull Brook W.A. Crew was; Pilot SQNLDR N Williamson, Navigator FLTLT F Delandelles and Maintenance SGT. D Gardner. Wings taken off by members of the RAAF based at Pearce, placed on trucks and transported by road from Bull Brook to Bull Creek on 17/11/83. It was then rebuilt by the same team of men and put on display in the Museum's North Wing. No restoration work has been carried out by the Museum and as far as they know no special work was carried out before its delivery to RAAF Pearce. It was fully airworthy on arrival there.\n\nThe rear fuselage currently fitted appears to be that off A84-248.\n\nJim Grant of the RAAFA adds \"The change of the rear fuselage is a minor mystery as you can see the overpainted numbers 48 behind the numbers 30. However there is no record in the maintenance manuals that this change actually occurred which leaves us with the option of poor record keeping or a mistake during repainting at some time\"\n\nA rear fuselage marked A84-230 is fitted to A84-248 at Willowbank Qld and this is definitely a different fuselage section as the camouflage paint lines do not align at the fuselage joint. (see images of A84-248).\n\nCurrently on display RAAF Association Aviation Heritage Museum of WA - Bull Creek. A84-231 Mk.20 First flight 30/05/56.\n\nDelivered 19/06/56\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Vietnam as part of USAF 35th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Phan Rang Air Base. Arrived 16/04/67 after a 2 hour flight from Butterworth, Malaysia.\n\nDisappeared 03/11/70 in poor weather during a skyspot mission over South Vietnam. Crew MIA; FLGOFF Michael Herbert (Pilot) & PLTOFF Robert Carver (Nav).\n\nAfter many years of countless missions without the loss of an aircraft and its crew 2SQN suffered its first loss. Missing after a night time bombing operation in the Da Nang area, Vietnam. Flying as Magpie 91 the pilot. FLGOFF Herbert, last reported that he was flying at 22,000ft after just having released his bombs over a target under the direction of a USAF (not USMC as reported previously) Captain Bill Hanig working from OL-24 (Operating Location) located at Phu-Bai. His callsign MILKY. Acknowledging a transmission from the controller, releasing Magpie 91 at 20:22hrs (no heading or direction given to Phan Rang as previous mentioned), the aircraft was not heard from again. Standard procedure was for aircraft to head east then track south to Phan Rang. With the co-ordination of the US 3RD Air Rescue and Recovery Group, and despite an intensive 3 day search, which saw the squadron fly 38 sorties. The aircraft had flown a total of 4193.35 flight hours at the time of its loss.\n\nIn 2009 Operation Magpies Return found the crash site in the rugged countryside of Quang Nam Province, Vietnam, near the Laotian border. The remains of FLGOFF Michael Herbert and PLTOFF Robert Carver have been recovered and returned to their families in Australia. A84-232 Mk.20 First flight 31/05/56.\n\nDelivered 09/07/56.\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Vietnam as part of USAF 35th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Phan Rang Air Base. Arrived 08/67.\n\nReturned to Darwin 04/06/71.\n\nDuring 1972/73 it was modified for cartographic survey missions (see below)\n\nIssued to GAF for restoration and display 06/85.\n\nServed as gate guard at Avalon Airport Vic.\n\nIn 09/2006 Marc Chapman sent us this condition report.; \"Unfortunately 232 has deteriorated dramatically since the pictures taken in 2004 were posted on this site, I made an extensive inspection of 232 and although largely complete she isnt fairing well, during my inspection I noted the following: Extensive corrosion in tail section of fuselage underneath the tail plane and also rear fuselage has apparently filled with water but has not tipped up due to bracing of rear fuselage. Paint has peeled off the fuselage leaving the skin exposed to the elements. Moss noted growing at many places on the airframe, particularly at the fuselage/wing joint and along the trailing edges of the wings. Rearmost perspex window in Nav's compartment is broken allowing birds to nest in the cockpit. Corrosion evident in main and nose wheel bays, also all tyres except port main wheel cracked and flat. Birds nesting in port engine bay. Corrosion evident around cockpit area, and perspex has crazed and clouded but thankfully thus far has escaped the attention of vandals (mainly due to the main security post being not more than 50m away methinks) After making my inspection of 232 I talked for a while with the security team and a couple of the workers from the airport and all confirmed that nobody is responsible for maintaining the appearance of 232 and there has been no work done on the aircraft for many years, sadly it seems she is being left to rot.\"\n\nThankfully the 90th anniversary of the RAAF saw A84-232 receive a much needed external restoration for static display at the 2011 Avalon air show. She was repainted in her Vietnam era camouflage scheme.\n\nAfter the air show it once again was left sitting out in the open suffering the elements.\n\nIt deteriorated to such a degree that another repaint was needed in 02/2015 in preparation for display at the 2015 Avalon air show.\n\nA84-232 was supposed to be stored inside one of Avalon's disused hangars but these are now fenced off from airside and leased out for non-aviation commercial uses. Last see once again sitting out in the open.\n\nReceived a further cosmetic touch-up in preparation for the 2017 Avalon Airshow\n\nStored at Avalon Airport A84-233 Mk.20 First flight 18/07/56.\n\nDelivered 07/09/56 at a cost of £490,000.\n\nTo 1 AD 25/06/57.\n\nTo 82 Wing 04/11/57.\n\nTo 3 AD 19/11/57 for mods.\n\nTo 82 Wing 11/04/58.\n\nTo 2 Sqn 02/05/58.\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Malayan Emergency.\n\nTook part in the RAAF's first jet bombing mission 03/09/58.\n\nTo 82 Wing 13/10/58.\n\nTo 3 AD 26/05/60 for E Servicing.\n\nTo 82 Wing 22/09/60.\n\nTo GAF Avalon 01/05/62 for mods.\n\nTo 82 Wing 06/12/62.\n\nTo GAF Avalon 09/10/63 for corrosion rectification.\n\nTo 3 AD 30/01/64 for E Servicing.\n\nTo 82 Wing 07/05/64.\n\nTo 2 Sqn 11/01/66.\n\nTo 82 Wing 15/07/66.\n\nTo Parafield 28/10/66 for mods.\n\nTo 82 Wing 28/03/67.\n\nTo 3 AD 16/03/67 for E Servicing.\n\nTo 2 Sqn 14/07/67.\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Vietnam as part of USAF 35th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Phan Rang Air Base.

Destroyed 07/82.\n\nBarry Wilson comments: \"I was Trials Manager for the Karinga/CBU-58 cluster bomb trials at Woomera in 1980-82. I had to get actual aircraft for target damage assessment and originally had a couple of Dakotas. However, aircraft preservation groups prevailed and they were withdrawn and replaced by two Canberra Mk20. These were located at Evetts Field in two target complexes - one for each munition type - along with many other real military targets. The aircraft were never destroyed. They were hit many times by sub-munitions and suffered several gaping holes, but were largely intact. I see mention of 4 or 5 Canberra being destroyed there. My trials finished in 1982 and there may have been a Phase II later in 1983, but to 1982 only two Canberra were employed. The one ending up at the Woomera missile park sounds plausible.\"\n\nA nosewheel door was on display at Classic Fighter Jets Museum, Parafield.

Arrived at Phan Rang Air Base 16/04/67 after a 2 hour flight from Butterworth, Malaysia.\n\nOn 09/02/71 WNGCDR John Downing and SQNLDR B A Johnson were providing close air support for troops engaging the enemy. On the last of 5 bombing runs the aircraft was hit in the nose by shrapnel from one of its own bombs, narrowly missing the crew, partially severing the elevator cable s and embedding itself in the IFF panel. Their actions that day saw Downing and Johnson awarded the American DFC ( which suprisingly they never recieved!).\n\nOn 07/04/71 this time crewed by FLGOFF S Fenton and PLTOFF Murphy 234 provided close air support to an US Army Infantry company in contact with a large enemy force. Despite the close proximity of friendly forces and heavy ground fire 6 single drop bombing runs were made without any US casualties. The enemy suffered 80 lost and retreated. The heroics of these actions influenced the Temora Aviation Museum's choice of identity for their Canberra.\n\nReturned to Australia 05/71.\n\nReported as struck off 27/07/73 at Amberley but this must be incorrect.\n\nDuring 1972/73 it was modified for cartographic survey missions (see below)\n\nNoted at Edinburgh 26/04/79 wearing 2 Sqn tail fin flash\n\nOffered for Tender in 05/84.\n\nPurchased by Neville Mason 06/85.\n\nThe front fuselage is displayed at the RAAF Museum, Point Cook Vic.\n\nThe rest of the aircraft turned up at in pieces at Capalaba in 1989, their current location is unknown however it is likely they were scrapped.\n\nTemora Aviation Museum's Canberra is painted as A84-234. It is an ex-RAF TT.18 serial WJ680. Registered VH-ZSQ\n\n10/2017 entered Temora's maintenance hangar for overhaul for an expected return to airworthiness in 2018.\n\nIn July 2019, the Temora Aviation museum, handed over a number of their warbirds including this Canberra.\n\nA ground engine run was conducted at the Temora Air Force display in March 2021. The aircraft has been restored to an airworth state but is still awaiting final sign off from the RAAF before it will return to the air. The date for this is unknown.\n\nA84-235 Mk.20 First flight 03/09/56.\n\nDelivered 22/10/56.\n\nServed with 2 Sqn in Vietnam as part of USAF 35th Tactical Fighter Wing.

The one thing I can remember of this crash was Dad saying that the starboard engine was still at absolute screaming full throttle when the aircraft finally came to a stop after the crash. The fuel cut-off switches would not work from the cockpit so the pilots couldn't turn it off! It ran that way for a full 15 minutes or so with the pilots and rescue crews all looking on in disbelief. Finally one of the engine fitters armed with a hacksaw walked onto the wing and opened an inspection hatch and cut through the fuel line of the 'never say die' engine\".\n\nConverted to components in situ 06/60\n\nAccording to the Commonwealth gazette 13/10/60\"Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the following Awards in recognition of the brave services rendered by the undermentioned following the crash of a Canberra aircraft at Butterworth, Malaya, on 8 March 1960.
