It is specifically focussed on determining optimal basing arrangements for Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy assets in the North Western Region of Australiaâs strategic interest, the Indian Ocean region.\n\nGiven the considerable cost of basing construction and long term maintenance, determining an optimal basing arrangement is not a trivial problem. Poor choices would impose serious constraints on the ability of the ADF to operate in the Indian Ocean and deny options in supporting United States alliance commitments, while incurring unnecessary and large expenditures of resources during a period of fiscal challenge, coinciding with a period during which the ADF force structure sorely needs to be recapitalised.\n\nGiven the importance of this strategic problem, the study explores the full range of critical problems which must be addressed in producing the best possible outcome, in terms of long term capability and flexibility.\n\nThe central conclusion this study draws is that a deep and comprehensive upgrade of the basing infrastructure in the Pilbara and Kimberley is essential to permit Australia to maintain its strategic position in the region, safeguard the economically important energy and resource industries of the North-West, and that further important strategic advantages can be gained by the construction of modern hardened basing infrastructure in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and on Christmas Island.\n\nMoreover, there are other important strategic and political payoffs in such basing upgrades. These include enabling and supporting âMilitary Operations Other Than Warâ, better supporting Australia's principal ally the United States, and in directly facilitating the growth of Australian Industry by providing dual use capabilities in key basing locations.\n\nOf equal importance, basing upgrades will require that the fragile environment in this geographical region be respected and carefully addressed in any base upgrade or new construction planning.; Published: 25th February,  2012.",

Mostly this is a byproduct of the remarkable speed, scale and scope of China's military capability growth, but also a byproduct of a concurrent parallel growth pattern in capabilities across Asia, in response to China's growth. In many respects, this represents incremental escalation of the âcreeping arms raceâ which has characterised the military environment in Asia since the end of the Cold War.\n\nAustralia can no longer assume that these changes are not relevant to her strategic position, and the Australian Defence Force Posture Review (ADFPR) which is to report in early 2012 is an important step forward in aligning Australia's posture to a changing region.\n\nThis study explores the problem of determining an optimal basing arrangement for Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy assets in the Indian Ocean region, in considerably greater depth and detail than is feasible in an effort such as the ADFPR, which by its nature is constrained.\n\nGiven the considerable cost of basing construction and long term maintenance, determining an optimal basing arrangement is not a trivial problem. Poor choices would impose serious constraints on the ability of the ADF to operate in the Indian Ocean, deny options in supporting United States alliance commitments, and incur unnecessary and large expenditures of resources during a period of fiscal difficulty, when the ADF force structure is being recapitalised.\n\nTherefore, this study aims to explore the full range of critical problems which must be addressed in producing the best possible outcome, in terms of long term capability and flexibility.\n\nThe strategic context is explored in detail, both in the regional context, and in the context of the exceptional growth seen in the Pilbara and Kimberley. The historical background to Australian, United States and British basing in the Eastern Indian Ocean is surveyed.\n\nStrategic considerations for basing in the Pilbara, Kimberley and Indian Ocean Offshore Territories are explored and analysed, and best outcomes identified. Specific environmental and operational problems for key sites are analysed, including critical environmental constraints.\n\nFinally, the ADFPR Interim Report recommendations are tested against the findings of this study.\n\nAdditional reference material is included in a series of Annexes, including a discussion of airbase hardening problems and options, and extant United States island basing arrangements.\n\nThe Strategic Importance of the Indian Ocean SLOCs\n\nThe industrialisation of Asia began with Japan during the 1920s, and has been an accelerating process as South Korea, Taiwan, and most recently mainland China have pursued industrialisation, with India following. These Asian nations collectively now account for much of global manufacturing activity, in areas ranging from heavy industries such metal processing and shipbuilding, down to the operation of high density microelectronic foundries.\n\nA key characteristic of industrial economies is that they are insatiable consumers of energy and raw materials. This reality was observed first during the industrialisation of Europe, then during the industrialisation of North America, and most recently, during the industrialisation of Asia.\n\nThe consequence of this is high per capita energy consumption in most if not all industrialised nations, spread across transportation, industrial manufacturing, and consumer markets.\n\nOther consequences of industrialisation are a strong drive to individual ownership of housing and automobiles. In turn this yields higher energy consumption and thus increased demand over time as a result.\n\nIt is often not well understood that one of the major motivations underpinning the Great War was intensive competition over colonial raw materials and energy, between the established colonial powers, and latecomers on the European continent.\n\nThe Second World War, while most commonly explained as a clash between diametrically opposed ideologies, was motivated in a large part by German and Japanese demand for raw materials and energy, controlled at that time by the Western powers and Soviets. The German drive to Stalingrad, and the Japanese occupation of South East Asia, were both intended to secure energy supplies.\n\nThe grand geostrategic plays of the Cold War involved the West and Warsaw Pact nations fighting across the developing world. Underpinning these ostensibly ideologically motivated conflicts was a contest for the control of key naval chokepoints, and very frequently, access to local energy or mineral resources. While Soviet rhetoric was centred in ideology, practical strategic choices were clearly driven by other agendas, as demonstrated by the Gorshkov doctrine, which clearly stated that âthe interdiction of merchant shipping and its associated escorts is the most important constituent part of the efforts of a fleet aimed at undermining the military/economic potential of the enemyâ [1].\n\nThe three great conflicts of twentieth century were thus at the most fundamental level the result of competition over access to energy and resources.\n\nFigure 1. Primary Indian Ocean SLOCs (C. Kopp).\n\nIt may be argued, that the Indian Ocean is at this time carrying more maritime traffic than any other water body of its size. Much of this traffic comprises oil tankers and LNG tankers travelling to and from Persian Gulf terminals, enroute to Europe, and importantly, the industrial economies of the Far East.\n\nRodrigue's detailed study of the global shipping infrastructure shows that Asia is now the predominant destination for Middle Eastern petroleum/gas product. Even one decade ago Asian consumption of Middle Eastern oil was of the order of twice that of the European Union [2].\n\nMost of the crude oil and LNG produced in the Persian Gulf and destined for Asia is shipped through the Straits of Hormuz, past the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, and then via the Straits of Malacca, Sunda or Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago, and thereafter via lanes in the South China Sea, or lanes east of the Philippines, to terminals in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.\n\nContainer ships carrying manufactured goods from Asia to Europe and Africa will also traverse these shipping lanes, as the shortest great circle path is the cheapest route in terms of fuel consumption, a major cost factor. Minerals and ores mined in Africa and destined for Asia will also travel via the Indian Ocean sea lanes.\n\nThese traffic patterns in shipping will persist for at least two decades, until Persian Gulf oil and gas reserves are exhausted and other regions become dominant POL and LNG suppliers to Asian economies.\n\nPersian Gulf oil reserves have crossed the âpeak oilâ point and these oilfields are now declining in output, as they are progressively exhausted. Recent and well publicised discoveries in the Americas of oil and gas in offshore locations, and onshore oil and gas bearing shales, could well see a return to the global dominance of the Americas as the world's biggest energy producing region [3].\n\nImportantly, in situ known reserves are not a measure of immediate or near term production capacity, and until these discoveries are further developed, the Persian Gulf will remain a critical energy producing region, with all of the strategic consequences that entails.\n\nAsia's lack of self-sufficiency in fossil fuels is a pivotal strategic vulnerability for all of these nations, but especially China, where the nation's sheer size drives up the demand for energy to fuel its transportation infrastructure, and military machine.\n\nChina has some domestic oil reserves in East Turkmenistan, and is contesting access to some seabed reserves across the South China Sea. China is also initiated construction of the world's largest Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuel plant, intended to use coal as a feedstock [4].\n\nFor the foreseeable future China will remain heavily dependent upon oil and LNG imports, with Iran and likely Australia key LNG suppliers. At this time more than 50% of China's oil imports arrive via the Indian Ocean, from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Angola. Current projections suggest that two thirds of China's oil consumption will be imports by 2030, while currently half is imported [5][6].\n\nThe unavoidable strategic reality is that any nation or alliance which can control the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean can hold much of Asia hostage, including China. Control of the western Indian Ocean closes the chokepoint at the Arabian Sea, while control of the eastern Indian Ocean closes the chokepoints in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\nThe means via which the chokepoints at the eastern and western extremities of the Indian Ocean might be closed are manifold: by coastal missile batteries, land based air power, submarines, surface warships, naval mines or some combination of these measures, with much the same strategic impact. The flow of crude oil and LNG can be constricted, controlled or completely halted by the controlling party.\n\nIn historical terms, the Royal Navy was the first to hold a dominant position in the Indian Ocean, displaced during the Cold War by the US Navy replenishing from Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territories, and the Soviet Voenno-Morskii Flot operating from Goa in India. The Soviets long sought a land accessible port in the region, but failed to secure one [7].\n\nReflecting the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean, China has invested heavily in âspecial relationshipsâ with both Pakistan and Burma, and has actively cultivated Iran despite the political risks involved. The is frequently described as the âString of Pearlsâ strategy, whereby a chain of bases is built along China's most critical strategic SLOCs.\n\nBurma has seen upgrades to its airfields and ports, paid for by China, well in excess of any domestic needs. More recently, China commenced construction of an oil and LNG terminal at Kyuakpya in Burma, in the Bay of Bengal, connected by pipeline to Kunming in China. This facility will reduce the recurring shipping cost, but also bypass the eastern chokepoint [8].\n\nReports emerged in 2011 suggesting that China may seek naval basing in Pakistan, at the deep water port of Gwadar in Baluchistan, a former enclave of Oman purchased by Pakistan in 1958. The port was subjected to a major upgrade in recent years and is capable of accommodating vessels with a draft of up to 14 metres [9] [10].\n\nIndia has always maintained a strong naval and maritime patrol capability, intended in part to blockade Pakistan in time of war. India has upgraded facilities in the Andaman Islands, to extend its footprint. It recently ordered new P-8I Poseidon LRMP/ASW aircraft in the US, abandoning a long established relationship with Russian suppliers.\n\nThere can be little doubt at this time that competition for control of the Indian Ocean is now well established.\n\nA Strategic Perspective on the Indian Ocean\n\nThe greatest challenge Australia must confront in coming decades will be maintaining a secure strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region. The industrialisation and economic growth of Asia is an ongoing process which will not cease in the foreseeable future. The inevitable byproduct of economic growth will be ongoing high military capital equipment investments across Asia.\n\nThe defacto unregulated supply of Russian and Chinese built high technology weapons, which are sold both for profit and strategic influence, creates an environment where any nation in Asia, or elsewhere, can procure almost any advanced system, and the digital technology employed in the construction of such systems removes most if not all of the training and support impediments which hampered the effectiveness of Soviet era weapons during the Cold War, and immediate post Cold War period [11].\n\nAn important aspect of the military modernisation of Asia has been a significant increase in the effective operational reach of weapon systems.\n\nTo emphasise this point, a Kilo class SSK with a cruise missile armament is not a reverse engineered Romeo class U-boat, and a new-build Sukhoi Su-35S Flanker with F-111 class range is not a 200 nautical mile radius MiG-21 Fishbed or clone thereof.\n\nThrough most of the Cold War period distance protected Australia from most capabilities deployed in Asia. This is much less the case today - any number of weapon systems deployed in Asia can now cross Australia's sea-air gap with no difficulty, and strike at military installations, infrastructure and northern population centres.\n\nIt is now inevitable that the coming decades will be a period of strategic competition across Asia, involving nascent China and India, smaller nations across Asia, and the United States. Much of this competition will be driven by access to energy, be it in situ seabed reserves, or SLOCs employed for importing energy from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe intensity of this competition should not be underestimated. In September of 2011, an editorial in a major Chinese Communist Party newspaper, the Global Times, stated: âthe South China Sea is the best place for China to wage warsâ as âof the more than 1,000 oil rigs there, none belongs to China; of the four airfields in the Spratly Islands, none belongs to China; once a war is declared, the South China Sea will be a sea of fire. Who will suffer the most from a war? Once a war starts there, the Western oil companies will flee the area, who will suffer the most?â.[12]\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, Australia has had the indulgence of not having to confront the risk of a high intensity regional conflict. The consequence of this is that Australia's Defence planning drifted into a âcomfort zoneâ where minimal force structure and infrastructure, geared around Indonesia's capabilities, became the accepted norm.\n\nThe use of Indonesia's capabilities as a force structure benchmark remains a common predilection in Canberra Defence circles, in practice, even if public statements claim otherwise. This has been, in every respect, a mistake, as Indonesia is not a representative example of the uptake of advanced Russian and Chinese weapons technology in Asia. It does however provide a justification for minimising capability and avoiding proper short, medium and long term planning choices especially in force structure planning.\n\nAs much as the idea of Australia being a niche or boutique provider of specialised capabilities, such as Special Forces or airlift, to United States led coalition forces may be appealing in some circles, it leads to a deep distortion of planning priorities and loss of focus. One parliamentarian remarked to this author, that â...becoming America's Gurkhas will do nothing for Australia's strategic position, or improve America's strategic posture in the Indo-Pacific regionâ.\n\nTo properly and robustly address the changing strategic environment will require considerable thought, much planning, and careful investment, both in capabilities and infrastructure.\n\nThe determination of what investment is appropriate must reflect strategic needs, as well as Australia's assets and vulnerabilities in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nWestern Australia and the Indian Ocean\n\nWestern Australia and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, then British and now an Australian offshore territory, played an important role during the Second World War, as a staging area and basing area for air and naval operations across South East Asia.\n\nWestern Australia was a critical strategic asset during that period. It was also an asset with few vulnerabilities, as the North-West was very sparsely populated with an economy dominated by agriculture, specifically cattle stations.\n\nRAAF and naval basing in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions were the only significant targets the Japanese could damage, as there were no assets of strategic economic importance in the state.\n\nThat was 70 years in the past. At this time is the North-West has become one of Australia's most valuable economic assets and sources of export revenue, with a growing population.\n\nWestern Australia has become a major centre for the resource industry, on a scale without precedent. The state is a major exporter of iron ore, oil/condensate and LNG, gold, nickel, alumina, diamonds, manganese, chromite, tantalum, lithium, copper, vanadium and rare earths. These are strategically important raw materials and valuable exports from Western Australia. [13][14].\n\nCommodity AUD Billion Iron Ore $57.3 Crude Oil and Condensate $12.4 LNG $8.7 Gold $8.2 Nickel $4.6 Alumina $4.0 Others $6.0 Total $101.2 Table 1. Western Australiaâs mineral and petroleum resources in order of value for 2010â11 (Department of Mines and Petroleum, Government of Western Australia).\n\nIron ore has been a major export from the Pilbara region, for many decades, and the known reserves are expected to last for decades. Decades of sustained infrastructure development and heavy industrial manufacturing, especially shipbuilding, have seen strong and ongoing demand in Asia, especially China.\n\nThe Kimberley region is claimed to produce almost a third of global diamond production, and is often regarded to be the largest single supplier globally. The Kimberley region is also home to other mineral mining operations, and the Ord river irrigation scheme supports tropical crop farming.\n\nFigure 3. Western Australia (1936).\n\nFigure 4, 5: Above, below: the Barrow Island oilfield was the first major energy industry development in the Pilbara, operated by W.A. Petroleum (WAPET), later absorbed by Chevron (Â© 1979 - 2012 Carlo Kopp).\n\nFigure 6. Chevron Gorgon LNG plant under construction on Barrow Island (Chevron).\n\nWithout any doubt the jewel in the crown of the North-Western economy is however the gas and oil industry.\n\nThe first major oilfield in the North-West was opened on Barrow Island, near Karratha, and peaked in production output during the 1970s, yielding mainly light crude oil and some gas.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Woodside Petroleum developed the North Rankin A gasfield, using an offshore platform, seabed pipeline and large LNG production facility on the Burrup Peninsula, north of Karratha.\n\nIt was followed in 1995 by the Goodwyn A platform, which routes its production output to the North Rankin A platform, and then to Karratha.\n\nWA Petroleum (WAPET), later subsumed by its parent Chevron, is now developing the Gorgon gasfield, with a major LNG facility under construction on Barrow Island. It is being followed by the Chevron Wheatstone project, which will ship gas from a platform northwest of Barrow Island to an LNG plant under construction near Onslow.\n\nFigure 7. (via Department of Mines and Petroleum, Government of Western Australia)\n\nCurrent planned production rates for these facilities are of the order of 50 million tonnes of LNG annually, with Wheatstone alone having expansion potential to 25 million tonnes annually. These production rates are well in excess of Malaysian and Indonesian LNG production, and will rival the production rate of Qatar, at this time the leading global LNG exporter.\n\nFigure 8. Rendering of Chevron Wheatstone LNG plant under construction at Onslow on the Pilbara coast (Chevron).\n\nFigure 9. Woodside Burrup Peninsula plant (Woodside Petroleum).\n\nFigure 10. LNG tanker at the Woodside loading facility near Karratha (Woodside Petroleum).\n\nFigure 11. Woodside Pluto production platform (Woodside Petroleum).\n\nThe North-West Shelf gas and oil industry is a major national export revenue earner, and enables a range of other industries, such as ammonia production and alumina refining. A substantial proportion of Western Australia's electricity, used by industry and residential consumers, is generated from North-West Shelf gas.\n\nThe gas and oil industry are of enormous strategic value, but also present direct and indirect strategic vulnerabilities.\n\nAn opponent intending to damage Australia's economy, or the economy of any nation heavily dependent upon imports from Australia, could produce significant effect by stopping LNG and condensate exports, an effect exacerbated by the flow-on effect of other industries in Western Australia which depend on gas supply to operate. Closing down North-West Shelf gas production closes down alumina production, and gas supply to manufacturing and residential users in Perth.\n\nLesser but still significant damage could be inflicted by threatening or interdicting SLOCs, thus preventing export product from the mining and gas/oil industries from reaching its destinations, mostly in Asia.\n\nIn strategic terms Australia is thus presented with a confluence of growing strategic exposure due to the increase in the economic importance of the North-West, while increasing strategic competition over the Indian Ocean and its critical SLOCs increases the strategic importance of the North-West for siting military basing infrastructure, especially airfields.\n\nIt is critical to observe that the LNG infrastructure in the North-West Shelf region is highly vulnerable to attack using Precision Guided Munitions, which have proliferated widely across Asia over the last two decades.\n\nLNG storage tanks, when full or near full, store energy comparable to that in a tactical or strategic nuclear warhead, albeit not released as quickly.\n\nNevertheless, an armour piercing, concrete piercing or shaped charge cruise missile warhead could easily penetrate the shell of such a tank and cause an uncontrollable fire. Other infrastructure, such as offshore platforms, LNG trains, condensate scrubbing and storage facilities, and LPG plant, is also vulnerable.\n\nA major concern historically, with uncontrolled fires in such facilities is the BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) which is not unlike a Fuel Air Explosive (FAE) bomb in effect, levelling buildings and tearing apart infrastructure, while causing flash burns and fires. This can significantly increase the damage footprint of a fire in a petrochemical facility.\n\nThe radar contrast of these large facilities, constructed with steel and concrete, is sufficiently good that pilots used same as navigation references even thirty years ago.\n\nThe regional proliferation of modern submarines, armed with ASCMs, and often LACMs, means that any nation with the motive could inflict significant damage upon the North-West Shelf infrastructure with one or two SSK sorties. Moreover, if the perpetrators did not admit the attack, they could be very difficult to identify.\n\nMore overt, but no less difficult to defeat would be modern aircraft armed with ASCMs or LACMs. Later models of the Sukhoi Flanker flown from any number of sites in the Indonesian archipelago have the reach to hit these targets. LRMP aircraft and tanker supported bombers could also strike from the Asian continent [15][16].\n\nChina's intended deployment of multiple aircraft carriers adds an additional consideration to this problem. While the intended air wing composition of these vessels is yet to be seen, and thus their intended role is yet to be understood, changes in the composition of such an air wing to provide a robust force projection capability could be effected in a small number of years. At this time the yet to be understood role of China's carrier battle groups adds considerable uncertainty to the strategic equation in the short, medium and long term.\n\nMore than often any mention of such vulnerabilities in the Australian defence debate typically elicits arguments about the motives and agendas of regional nations, inevitably concluding that India, China, Indonesia and other nations have no immediate motive to attack, and therefore the vulnerability should be ignored.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality of past conflicts is that neutral nations and non-participants have been attacked for any number of reasons. War materiel, such as energy products, minerals and metals, have been âfair gameâ on the high seas, in times of war, regardless of the flag flown. it is unfortunate that in times of conflict, neutrality is not an effective defence, and motives for attacks range from strategic necessity, through intimidation, to simple spite.\n\nThe unavoidable conclusion is that Australia will need to develop the capability to deny other nations opportunities to launch attacks upon the Western Australian economic infrastructure, and opportunities to interfere with shipping of resource industry products from Western Australia.\n\nAustralia's Indian Ocean Offshore Territories\n\nAustralia's two Indian Ocean offshore territories, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island are both valuable strategic assets.\n\nNeither island territory has been a major feature of the ongoing defence policy debate, or in recent media focus, until Christmas Island became home to an immigration detention facility, and public statements were recently made about increased Defence use of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.\n\nDiscovered in 1609, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands were initially a privately owned asset, granted to the Clunies-Ross family in perpetuity by Britain in 1886, with jurisdiction transferred to Australia in 1955, and the Clunies-Ross family losing control of the islands by the late 1970s. The economy was since initial colonisation based on palm tree plantations, but more recently eco-tourism, especially for divers, has become prominent.\n\nThe Cocos (Keeling) Islands are in geological terms a horseshoe shaped coral atoll situated on top of an extinct volcanic seamount, itself part of a submerged mountain range. The central lagoon is very shallow, and unusable for warships without deep dredging. Like other similar atolls, Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territories being a good example, average elevation above sea level is very low, and usable surface area both limited, and broken into multiple islands and islets.\n\nThe largest two islands surrounding the atoll, both inhabited, are the West Island or Brown's West Island, and Home Island in the north-east of the atoll. The total land area of the atoll is only 14 square kilometres, almost exactly half the land area of Diego Garcia, and much is covered with a former but no longer maintained commercial palm tree plantation. The local environment is typical of tropical coral atolls in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and is home to a wide variety of marine flora and fauna.\n\nFigure 12. Map of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (Central Intelligence Agency).\n\nChristmas Island was discovered in 1643, and settled by the Clunies-Ross family in the late 1880s, at which time they established a phosphate mine. The island was transferred from British to Australian jurisdiction in 1957 â 1958, with Singapore being paid compensation for lost earnings through phosphate mining.\n\nThe Christmas Island economy was dominated by phosphate mining until 1987, upon which most revenue was produced by a casino resort operated between 1993 and 1998. The resort is now active again as a tourist destination. Christmas Island has been repeatedly the focus of media attention, initially over casino operations, then the MV Tampa asylum seeker controversy, and most recently, the immigration detention facility established at a cost of AU$400 million, with a AU$30 million annual running cost, according to Amnesty International.\n\nFigure 13. Map of the Christmas Island (Central Intelligence Agency)\n\nUnlike the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island is a substantial volcanic island with a total land area of 135 square kilometres, of which much is elevated 200 to 300 metres above sea level, with steep cliffs along much of the coastline.\n\nThe Geoscience Australia summary states: âThe island is the summit of a submarine mountain, which rises steeply from sea level to a central plateau. The plateau reaches heights of up to 361 metres and consists mainly of limestone and layers of volcanic rock. Surrounding the island is a narrow tropical reef which plunges steeply to the ocean floor. Within 20 metres of the shoreline, you can find some of the steepest drop-offs in the world reaching a depth of about 500 metres within about 200 metres beyond the edge of the reef.â\n\nMuch of Christmas Island is covered with rainforest, and the long term geographical isolation has led to the evolution of a wide range of endemic species of plant and wildlife, including a number of endangered species. The island's ecology is in considerable difficulty, detailed further. In geological terms Christmas Island is similar to Guam, but about one quarter of the size of the latter.\n\nThe Pilbara and Kimberley during the Second World War\n\nIn geostrategic terms, Western Australia provides the ADF or an ally such as the United States, a major advantage in providing secure land accessible basing locations capable of covering the eastern Indian Ocean chokepoints in the Indonesian archipelago, and South-East Asia. Moreover, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands provide valuable Forward Operating Base (FOB) locations for LRMP/ASW/ASuW aircraft, submarines and strike aircraft, as well as diversion runways for long range maritime strike operations deep into the Indian Ocean.\n\nDuring the Second World War, a chain of airfields constructed across the Pilbara and Kimberley regions were used for exactly this purpose, including major airfields at RAAF Learmonth (Potshot) and RAAF Corunna Downs in the Pilbara, and RAAF Truscott in the Kimberley.\n\nFigure 14. Consolidated B-24J-CO-174 A72-40 GR-K of 24 SQN RAAF being loaded prior to a strike sortie, circa 1944.\n\nFigure 15. Consolidated B-24L-CO-10 A72-116 of 7 OTU RAAF based at Tocumwal, NSW.\n\nFigure 16. Consolidated B-24D-53-CO Liberator S/N 42-40369 âShady Ladyâ of 528th BS, 380th BG, stranded on a salt pan on the Anjo Peninsula in August, 1943. Until RAAF B-24 squadrons reached full strength, the 380th BG was the mainstay of the deep strike effort in the theatre. The depicted aircraft is unusual for two reasons. The first is that it was an in theatre modified B-24D with a Consolidated A6A nose turret retrofitted in Townsville, and the ventral ball turret replaced with a pair of .50 cal guns. The second reason is the circumstance of the photograph. This aircraft was flown as part of an unescorted 12 aircraft long range strike from Fenton in the Northern Territory, against the critical POL refinery and harbour in Balikpapan, Borneo, on the 13th August, 1943. These sixteen hour duration raids involved low altitude bombing and strafing of targets, at ranges similar to the well known Ploesti raids flown from North Africa. With fuel depleted, âShady Ladyâ attempted a landing on a salt pan, but the soft surface caused the nosewheel to collapse. The crew were rescued by local Aboriginal people and Benedictine monks from the Drysdale mission, who later assisted with moving repair crews and components to the site, so the aircraft could be repaired and flown out [17] (US Air Force).\n\nRAAF and US Army Air Corps aircraft, including B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, attacked coastal targets and Japanese shipping across the region from these bases, with RAAF Truscott and Corunna Downs used as Strategic Forward Operating Bases (SFOB).\n\nRAAF Truscott, still in use for commercial operations as Mungalalu Truscott Airbase, was built on the Anjo Peninsula in 1944 to replace the inadequate airfield at Drysdale station. It was used as a staging base for long range B-24 raids against targets in Java and Borneo, as well as ASW patrols, and RAAF Spitfire LF.VIII fighter squadrons rotated through the base to provide defensive cover.\n\nRAAF Corunna Downs, abandoned since the 1940s, was built as Strategic Forward Operating Base for B-24 strikes into Java and Sumatra. Located near Marble Bar, it was the largest bomber base in Western Australia.\n\nThe primary strike force available between early 1943 and early 1945 was the USAAC 380th Bomb Group, comprising the 528th, 529th, 530th, and 531st Bombardment Squadrons, all under RAAF operational control. The 380th was supplanted upon its departure to the Philippines in early 1945, by 12SQN, 21SQN, 23SQN, 24SQN, 25SQN, 99SQN and 102SQN RAAF equipped with B-24J/L/M Liberators. Corunna Downs and Truscott were frequently used to stage 380th BG B-24s based at Darwin, and later 25 SQN B-24s based at RAAF Cunderdin, and 23 SQN, 24 SQN B-24s based in the Northern Territory [18].\n\nOnslow, located between Exmouth and Karratha, and currently planned to become a major LNG processing site, was the location of a major naval fuel oil and aviation fuel depot, which supported Learmonth/Potshot and Corunna Downs [19].\n\nRAAF Learmonth was constructed initially as a fighter base to protect the US Navy submarine replenishment facility at Exmouth, designated Potshot, but also hosted bomber deployments. Exmouth is now home to the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station which provides VLF relay capability, and RAAF Learmonth was redeveloped into the current RAAF bare base.\n\nRAAF Truscott (1945) RAAF Corunna Downs (1945) Port Hedland (1945) Broome (1945) RAAF Learmonth (1945) Carnarvon (1945) RAAF Cunderdin (1945) USAAC Middle Swan\n\nFigure 17.

Pelican Point at Crawley on the Swan River was the site of a Catalina seaplane base, used by Qantas and US Navy PBY squadrons VS-6, VP-11, VP-21, VP-22, VP-33, VP-34, VP-52, VP-101 and VP-102. The ferry is turning into what used to be a takeoff run area for the PBYs (Â© 2011 Carlo Kopp).\n\nFigure 21. The Consolidated PBY Catalina played an important role during the Second War War, used for ASW patrols, maritime reconnaissance, minelaying, combat search and rescue, and the insertion and extraction of special forces units. The depicted HARS PBY-6A is painted to represent RAAF 43 SQN A24-362 OX-V used for combat search and rescue and minelaying, based in the Northern Territory (Â© 2011 Carlo Kopp).\n\nFremantle became a major logistical hub, and staging port for naval units. Perth hosted numerous training and logistical units, and a base for Catalinas carrying mail and passengers across the Indian Ocean, at Crawley on the Swan River, adjacent to the University of Western Australia campus. Less known is that a number of US Navy maritime patrol squadrons equipped with PBYs rotated through the Crawley base, providing ASW coverage of the Fremantle / Perth area.\n\nThe primary military airfield in close proximity to Perth was RAAF Cunderdin, which hosted RAAF âCity of Perthâ 25 SQN B-24L/M Liberators, P-40 Kittyhawks, and some USAAC B-24s tasked with LRMP/ASW duties. A major airfield was constructed for USAAC operations at Middle Swan late in the war, now Caversham, but it did not see significant use, the associated satellite runways have mostly since been overbuilt through suburban growth.\n\nFigure 22. Fleet Base West - HMAS Stirling at Garden Island. In the foreground, HMAS Waller, in the background, SSGN-726 USS Ohio (U.S. Navy).\n\nAustralia's Indian Ocean Offshore Territories during the Second World War\n\nAustralia has made little use of the strategic position of either Indian Ocean offshore territory since it gained control of them a half century ago. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands have been employed on a regular basis as a Forward Operating Base (FOB) for refuelling P-3 Orion Long Range Maritime Patrol (LRMP) aircraft, especially during the late Cold War period when Soviet fleet movements needed to be closely monitored.\n\nDuring the Second World War both Indian Ocean offshore territories were deemed important enough for military use. Christmas Island was invaded and occupied by the Japanese in March 1942, following several raids by Japanese submarines, surface warships and naval aircraft. The British garrison collapsed when the Indian troops stationed on the island mutinied and then killed the five British military personnel on the island. A very small garrison of Japanese troops held the island until October, 1945, when the Royal Navy arrived and British forces secured the island.\n\nThe Cocos (Keeling) Islands were intended to play a much larger role in Commonwealth military operations conducted by South East Asia Command (SEAC) during the Second World War. Operation Zipper was a planned joint force invasion of South East Asia by the Commonwealth XIVth Army, to retake Malaya and Singapore, occupied by the Japanese in 1941. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands were identified as the most suitable location for a Strategic Forward Operating Base (SFOB), from which the Royal Air Force could perform sea control using LRMP aircraft, and launch strategic bombing raids using heavy bombers. In 1944 logistical and construction units of the XIVth Army landed on the islands and commenced clearing of West Island and the construction of the airfield. This effort was designated Operation Pharos [20].\n\nRoyal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire LF.VIII aircraft were shipped by sea to the airfield, borken down in crates, and reassembled at the airfield. The Royal Air Force 136 SQN, previously distinguished in operations flown over Burma, was redeployed from India in April, 1945, to operate the newly delivered Spitfires. The Spitfires were to provide air defence and escort capabilities. Royal Air Force 136 SQN was operationally ready in June, 1945.\n\nDeHavilland Mosquito PR.XXXIV long range photoreconnaissance aircraft of 684 SQN, based in India, deployed to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands once the Spitfire unit was ready. The Mosquito PR.XXXIV employed an additional bomb bay fuel tank to provide sufficient operating radius to perform pre-strike photoreconnaissance over Malaya, and bomb damage assessment.\n\nWith the Cocos (Keeling) Islands established as a secure operational base, SEAC redeployed two Royal Air Force heavy bomber squadrons from India, 231 Group's 99 SQN and 356 SQN, in July, 1945. Both units were equipped with Liberator B.VI (B-24H) bombers. The intended full deployment of 231 Bomber Group did not eventuate due to the collapse of Japan, with the remaining squadrons still located at bases in India.\n\nDue to the persistent risk of German U-boats and Japanese submarines, and the ongoing effort to interdict Japanese surface traffic in the Indonesian archipelago, SEAC deployed detachments from 160 SQN, 203 SQN and 321 (Netherlands) SQN, in 222 Group, for LRMP tasks, from their bases in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). The latter were equipped with Liberator GR.VI (B-24G/H/J) and GR.VIII (B-24J) aircraft.\n\nThe Royal Air Force Liberators were highly active in the last weeks of the war, attacking Japanese shipping targets in Java, and bombing and strafing the Japanese airfields at Benkeolen in Sumatra, also credited as the last Royal Air Force strike sortie of the war. Less known is that the Liberators performed covert supply drops for special forces operating in Malaya.\n\nA major strike on Singapore was cancelled as Japan's surrender became known. Thereafter the Liberators were used to drop supplies to Allied POWs, and later used as makeshift transports for evacuations of Allied POWs. A 203 SQN GR.VI was lost to Japanese fighters on the 14th August, 1945, near Rakata Island in the Sunda Strait [21].\n\nWith the collapse of Japan following the B-29 nuclear attacks, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands SFOB never attained its intended operational tempo or intended role as the primary bomber base for the defunct Operation Zipper.\n\nThe RAF airfield was redeveloped into the existing West Island field.\n\nStrategic Considerations for Indian Ocean Basing Infrastructure\n\nHistorically, Australia's fundamental strategy was constructed around the concept of denying the use of the sea-gap to potential opponents in Asia, reflecting the experience of the Second World War, where Japanese access to basing in what is now Indonesia permitted Japanese aircraft to attack targets across northern Australia. Until recently, Australia had a robust capability to implement this strategy, using submarines, but especially F/RF-111C aircraft armed with AGM-84 Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, and Paveway guided bombs.\n\nThe evolving strategic environment requires a fundamentally stronger strategy, as at this time the Australian continent is within the reach of a number of weapon systems which are not reliant upon basing in Indonesia to achieve strategic effect.\n\nIn 2008, Kopp et al proposed a revised strategy, labelled âregional denialâ [22]:\n\nâIn strategic terms this means that Australia should centre its future military strategy on âregional denialâ with the aim of denying operations in the sea-air gap, above and around the Australian continent, and also denying the basing of combat forces and facilities in the northern archipelago.\n\nTo implement such a strategy, Australia will need to fundamentally rethink its approach to air power, naval power and land force capabilities.\n\nCurrent and future capabilities for the RAAF will need to be focussed in two key areas. One is persistent air dominance and the related capability to kill cruise missiles and their launch platforms. The second is in providing long range strike capabilities with sufficient weight of fire to render regional basing unusable in combat. Maritime patrol and Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities need a complementary focus and will also require growth.\n\nCurrent and future capabilities for the RAN will also need to be focussed in two key areas. The first is in Anti-Submarine Warfare, requiring surface combatants and submarines which are suitable for this task and sufficiently numerous. The second capability is in providing organic cruise missile defences for surface warships and escorted shipping.\n\nCurrent and future capabilities for the Army will need to include Surface to Air Missile, and in the future Directed Energy Weapon, defences against cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and other guided weapons, to protect critical military and industrial infrastructure, and population centres. The Army will also need to assume responsibility for protecting such targets against Special Forces attack. Another important future role for the Army is providing covert insertion and extraction means for Infantry and Special Forces operating across the region. Sufficient capabilities should be available to deploy, sustain and extract useful numbers of Infantry and Special Forces troops.â\n\nImplementing this strategy requires both suitable force structure investments, but also suitable basing infrastructure to support the types of platforms and required sortie rates. Provision of Anti-Submarine Warfare and long range strike capabilities are the most challenging, the former due to range and persistence requirements, the latter due to range and the need to penetrate modern air defences [23].\n\nThe heavy use of Northern and North-Western Australian bases through the Second World War, by the RAAF, USAAC and US Navy, reflects the advantageous geographical placement of these sites relative to areas which are geographically of strategic interest in South East Asia.\n\nThe geostrategic importance of these key areas of South East Asia has increased since the 1940s, but the geography remains unchanged. If the intent is to operate military platforms across these areas, the optimally placed locations in terms of range and coverage are those sites in the Pilbara, Kimberley and Northern Territory which were employed for basing during the 1940s, or proximate locations. This is depicted in Figure 23.\n\nNo differently, the British 1940s investment in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is a reflection upon the excellent geographical location, for any operations intended to cover the chokepoints of the Malacca and Sunda Straits, and the major sea lanes skirting Southern India.\n\nIn this context, the great circle distances (Refer Figure 23) range between 600 nautical miles and 1,500 nautical miles, which is well within the capabilities of LRMP aircraft, tanker supported tactical fighters, and naval surface and subsurface assets. Attempting to cover the same geographical footprint from the Pilbara or Kimberley mostly doubles the required distances, which doubles transit times, doubles fuel burn, and mostly halves achievable sortie rates.\n\nFigure 23 (Â© 2012 Carlo Kopp).\n\nThis is true for aircraft, but is an even greater challenge for naval assets, be they surface fleet or submarines, as their transit speeds are less than 10 percent the transit speeds of aircraft.\n\nFuel aside, replenishment of expended munitions is a major issue, especially for the Navy. While the Navy has the option of underway replenishment from logistical ships, these must be escorted in and out of contested waters, and protected from aerial, surface warship and submarine attack during replenishment. This is not feasible if within the reach of hostile land based strike aircraft, without unusually heavy commitment of protective land based Combat Air Patrols and tankers.\n\nFigures 24 and 25. Wide area and regional maps of Australia's strategic air defence environment in the Indian Ocean region. Blue contours denote combat radius envelopes centred on airfields, red contours denote JORN coverage for the three radar systems at Laverton, WA, Alice Springs, NT and Longreach, QLD (C. Kopp).\n\nFigure 26 (Â© 2012 Carlo Kopp).\n\nBasing sites located in the Pilbara, Kimberley, but especially the Cocos (Keeling) Islands represent valuable assets under such conditions, as they can be used to replenish submarines and surface warships with munitions and fuel, and if needed, crew. Moreover, these bases significantly increase available time on station during LRMP sorties.\n\nConsidering operations deeper into the region, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands also dramatically reduce the demand for tanker aircraft, where tactical fighters need to be deployed. The old adage about âunsinkable aircraft carriersâ applies, with the added capability for high volume logistical resupply.\n\nIf Australia intends to protect its outer Western maritime approaches, and perform both maritime denial and sea control operations in the Indian Ocean, then the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are ideally located. Moreover, the location offers the potential for air strikes into South East Asia, Burma, and the South China Sea, with sufficient tanker support. While the latter may appear âvaluelessâ in the current peacetime regional environment, any major shifts in the political and military alignment of regional nations away from the US Alliance could change that assumption literally overnight.\n\nTherefore, the safest strategy for Australia is to properly develop the military potential of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as a naval replenishment site, and an air force âStrategic FOBâ along the lines of the SEAC effort in 1944 â 1945.\n\nIt would demonstrate across the region that Australia has the intent and means to defend its sovereign territories and broader strategic interests in the Indian Ocean.\n\nChristmas Island could play a similar role, although it is located within 260 nautical miles of Jakarta, and thus is highly exposed in any military situation where Indonesia is occupied by another power, aligns itself with another power, or actually becomes an adversary in its own right. Contemporary tactical ballistic missiles, ground launched cruise missiles and even the smallest tactical fighters can easily reach Christmas Island from any number of sites in Java.\n\nThe reciprocal dimension of such proximity is that Christmas Island would easily permit high tempo air operations into Indonesia's heartland, a reality which will not be lost upon the TNI leadership in Jakarta. Any significant development of the military potential of Christmas Island would require some very adept diplomacy, and possibly the offer of training facilities and weapons range access on the island for the TNI-AU. If Indonesia becomes embroiled in a regional conflict to its north, a major basing facility on Christmas Island for ADF and US Air Force assets could be invaluable â the critical political dimension is whether Indonesia wishes to remain aligned with the US and Australia in the long term.\n\nThese considerations apply to Australian strategic needs in the context of defending Australia's immediate interests in the region, during a period of increased strategic competition across the region.\n\nAn additional dimension to consider is that of the strategic needs of our principal ally, the United States.\n\nThe United States had an excellent basing network across the Pacific during the Cold War, including multiple bases in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, the Marianas and Hawaii, with leased access to Britain's Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.\n\nTwo decades after the Cold War the North Asian bases are demonstrably indefensible against Chinese air assets, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The large Subic Bay and Clark bases in the Philippines were closed down at the end of the Cold War [24].\n\nWhile Diego Garcia and Guam have become central basing âhubsâ, the remaining bases are of limited utility due to their exposed locations. A crisis in South East Asia or the eastern Indian Ocean would present major challenges, especially for tactical air and tanker aircraft basing. This would be true of a conflict, as much as a major natural disaster.\n\nIn the context of supporting United States operations in Asia, well developed air and naval basing infrastructure on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, Pilbara and Kimberley would become a valuable capability in its own right, which Australia could offer the use of in a major contingency. These sites would provide a genuine basing capability âgap fillerâ located between the major bases in Guam and Diego Garcia.\n\nMilitary Operations Other Than War\n\nWhile the primary purpose of military basing is to prevail in military conflicts, or deter such conflicts, especially against nation state opponents, it is not the sole purpose of such installations. Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW) are also of considerable importance, especially where civil authorities in Australia, or other nations are limited in their capacity or capabilities to deal with particular contingencies.\n\nMOOTW potentially span a wide range of contingencies, encompassing domestic and foreign contingencies, and ranging across deterrence, stability operations, disaster relief and any other contingency where military capabilities are employed for other than combat operations. United States joint doctrine states: âMOOTW focus on deterring war, resolving conflict, promoting peace, and supporting civil authorities in response to domestic crisesâ.\n\nTwo particular categories of contingency are of importance and of interest in the context of the Pilbara, Kimberley, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island - natural disasters and the broader category of supporting law enforcement and enforcing border controls.\n\nThe first type of contingency, natural disasters, may arise either within Australian territory, or within the immediate region, and often require high intensity logistical and personnel surge deployments to effect relief and rescue efforts.\n\nWithin Australia, the most likely natural disasters observed in the âdeep northâ are the result of cyclones, which can be accompanied by severe flooding, and serious infrastructure, and housing damage, arising due to extremely high wind speeds, intensive rainfall and severe sea surface and coastal surge conditions. The best known example of this class of contingency is Cyclone Tracy, which largely destroyed Darwin in December, 1974, and resulted in the greatest single airlift operation in Australian history, when military and civilian aircraft were employed en masse to move much of the population of Darwin to temporary accommodation in other Australian states [25].\n\nWhile Tracy was unusual in the statistical sense that it was both a large cyclone, and it hit the single largest population centre in the north of the nation, it will, inevitably, not be the last such event, whether in Australia, or in South Asia or South-East Asia. The largest such disaster was in Bangladesh in 1970, when Cyclone Bhola wrought havoc upon low lying coastal areas, resulting in high initial loss of life, and subsequent further losses due to starvation and disease, following flooding, famine and the propagation of waterborne diseases. The subsequent 1991 Bangladesh cyclone was of similar scale and lethality.\n\nStrategically sensitive South-East Asia is especially of concern as a location for large scale natural disasters.\n\nWhile cyclones are by far the best known of the likely contingencies, monsoonal flooding without widescale wind and sea surge damage is also a common occurence in this region, and possibly a more frequent contingency in the future with the coincidental circumstances of anthropogenic deforestation and increasing climatic instability. Deforestion can degrade the capacity of the local environment to absorb large short term rainfall, resulting in turn in catastrophic mudslides and faster rainfall runoff, often in excess of the capacity of natural and manmade drainage mechanisms.\n\nTectonic instability in South-East Asia produces by global standards an unusually high frequency of earthquakes, with coincident tsunamis if the epicentre is located on a seabed, as well as an propensity for high volcanic activity levels.\n\nActive volcanoes in the region have produced most media attention due to disruptions in air travel arising from ash clouds, and several instances where widebody aircraft were at serious risk of loss following ash induced damage to engines and windshields. The best example of the latter was British Airways Flight 9 in 1982, which lost power over Indonesia due to ash ingestion.\n\nAsh clouds are arguably the least severe of the possible outcomes produced by regional volcanic events.\n\nThe eruption of Krakatoa in the Sunda Strait, in 1883, produced not only large immediate loss of life due to severe local tremors, pyroclastic clouds, lava flows, tsunamis and ash fall, but also more widespread damage due to ash destroying crops, and weather disruption globally. The large scale eruption of Krakatoa in 535 AD has been implicated in much greater damage, on a global scale, resulting in large scale crop and pasture failures, in turn resulting in large scale population displacements. More recently, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines resulted in intensive ash fall on Clarke AFB, effectively disabling the base [26].\n\nA major volcanic eruption in the near region has enormous potential for damage effects, both locally, and given population density, elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe tsunami of 2004 with its epicentre near Aceh in northern Sumatra resulted in massive loss of life, mostly in Indonesia and Thailand. The exemplary rescue, relief and aid operation, under Operation Unified Assistance, in which United States and Australian military forces played a pivotal role, presents a historical case study of the value of military assets in disaster relief. Refer Annex C.\n\nMOOTW is not however confined to disaster relief, rescue operations and evacuations, although these are the most visible, largest and often most valuable contributions military capabilities can make.\n\nBorder control operations, especially piracy, smuggling of people, contraband goods, arms and narcotics, and illegal immigration have been persistent problems at any ocean boundaries between developed nations and the developing world. All are byproducts of weak or underdeveloped law enforcement and border control mechanisms, and present expensive problems for the victim nations in question.\n\nNotable recent examples on the global stage include persistent problems with seaborne illegal entries in Europe from Africa, persistent large scale piracy on the high seas near the Horn of Africa, especially involving lawless Somalia, and ongoing problems of piracy and terrorism in South East Asia. The nexus between criminal organisations and terrorist movements, where criminal activities are often used as a funding mechanism for terrorism, is an issue in its own right.\n\nMilitary assets have been used in border control operations where civil authorities have lacked specific capabilities for the task, or where the scale of the problem has exceeded civilian agencies' capabilities.\n\nEnhancement of basing in the Pilbara, Kimberley, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island, especially where an airbase and naval replenishment facility, with logistical infrastructure, can be co-located, provides a high value capability for MOOTW, especially for dealing with both domestic and near region natural disasters.\n\nKey initial imperatives in natural disasters are damage assessment using ISR systems, rapid delivery of aid supplies and rescue personnel into the disaster area, and rescue and evacuation of disaster victims. Basing of suitable capacity on the mainland can be employed as staging and operational basing for disaster relief forces deployed into the area, and are especially useful for logistical buffering of incoming bulk aid supplies. The capacity to refuel from high volume fuel storage permits high sortie rates for helicopters and airlifters tasked with supply drops and rescue operations.\n\nIn northern Australia, well hardened military basing with integral water, sewage and electrical generation systems and capacity for accommodating thousands of military personnel, where located in close proximity to population centres, would also present the option of using these sites as sheltered locations for the civilian population during extreme weather events such as cyclones, and as evacuation transit sites following disasters.\n\nIn border control operations, military basing with robust capacity is valuable for forward basing equipment and personnel, provision of high capacity connections into the C3 network, but also for staging evacuations of detainees.\n\nIn conclusion, over the long term, the certain need to conduct MOOTW within the âdeep northâ and near region present compelling reasons why major enhancement of basing in the Pilbara, Kimberley, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island should be pursued. Unlike the conduct of war, where certainty of future outcomes is often in dispute, the need to conduct MOOTW is a well established reality of that geographical area, and the only uncertainties fall into exactly where and when MOOTW will need to be conducted.\n\nStrategic Basing Design Requirements\n\nThe Second World War was fought in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) using mostly temporary airfields constructed using Perforated Steel Planking (PSP) and tents for operational work areas and personnel accommodation, or temporary anchorages. The Cold War, a four and one half decade long standoff, saw the introduction and long term use of often well hardened, permanent basing. The Post Cold War conflicts which culminated in the invasion of Iraq in 2003 were mostly fought from well hardened permanent basing infrastructure, built to Cold War period standards.\n\nCold War air and naval basing, constructed in Europe and Japan, presents a good case study for the future regional environment, as it was mostly built to be resilient, robust, durable and equipped for sustained long duration operations.\n\nFuture major contingencies in the region could take three basic forms:\n\nA short duration standoff or MOOTW, which could last for weeks or months;\n\nA prolonged âCold War-likeâ standoff which could last for years or possibly decades;\n\nHigh intensity conflict which could last for weeks or many months;\n\nHigh intensity conflict which could last for many months or years, until one or both sides are exhausted.\n\nOnly the first type of conflict is âpermissiveâ in basing demands and compatible with lightweight âbare-bonesâ basing and temporary structures, assuming that Precision Guided Munitions are not employed.\n\nUnder all other circumstances, forces may need to be forward deployed for months or years, and even if high intensity combat operations are not conducted, basing may need to be used intensively and repeatedly for shorter durations.\n\nGiven the increased strategic competition across the region, there will be persistent potential for smaller regional disputes to escalate, upon which larger regional players, i.e. the United States, China and India, would inevitably become involved.\n\nThis has important implications for Australia's future basing infrastructure across the northern arc of the continent, as well as basing infrastructure which might be constructed on offshore territories.\n\nThree primary design considerations are prominent:\n\nThe ability to survive attacks using a range of Precision Guided Munitions;\n\nThe ability to sustain prolonged high intensity operations or months, or even years;\n\nThe ability to support all ADF platforms which might need to use the base, or in an escalated contingency, United States platforms;\n\nThese considerations apply regardless of whether the base is continously occuppied, in the manner of RAAF Tindal, or transiently occuppied, in the manner intended for RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Scherger [23].\n\nAn additional consideration in basing design is the local climatic environment, which follows a seasonal monsoonal pattern, with a dry season and a wet season. The latter is characterised by monsoonal deluges, and often very intensive tropical cyclones. The latter can see gusting wind speeds of up to 220 KT (Barrow Island 1996), intensive rainfalls of hundreds of millimetres in days, sea waves of up to 20 metres (North Rankin A, 1989), and storm surges of up to 4 to 5 metres [27].\n\nA common practice in the mining industry across the Pilbara and Kimberley is to evacuate most personnel before a cyclone arrives, after most equipment is stowed or otherwise secured. This is not an option for a military base during operations, as a major vulnerability will exist until the base is reoccupied and operations resume.\n\nAccommodating the seasonal monsoonal/cyclonic environment in the Indian Ocean region results in an implicit need for base infrastructure hardening, regardless of the risks inherent in a threat environment dominated by Precision Guided Munitions.\n\nMoreover, basing must be designed with storm water drainage capable of accommodating extreme rainfall intensities during cyclones, as well as fresh water and sewage systems which cannot be disrupted under such conditions.\n\nThe need for persistence, i.e. the ability to sustain operations for weeks or months, also has important implications. On-base fuel and munitions storage must be sufficient to accommodate large short term surges in usage/expenditure, while replenishment may be weeks away.\n\nProvision of fresh water for supporting hundreds or thousands of personnel during deployments of months or possibly years of duration, replenishing warships, and washing down aircraft will present issues at most locations of interest. While artesian bore water is often used by the mining industry, it is not an inexhaustable resource, and often requires heavy treatment. On island locations, water lens effects between salt and fresh subsurface water impose hard limits on available bore water. Therefore, where basing is in close proximity to the coast or located on an island, the installation of a desalination plant with adequate capacity is the only environmentally and operationally viable solution.\n\nSewage presents analogous problems, and environmental risks where there is a possibility of flooding during the monsoonal/cyclonic season, and resulting uncontrolled escape of effluent.\n\nSolid waste from mess halls will need to be incinerated, given the propensity of native wildlife to feed on garbage dumps with resulting environmental impacts resulting from atypical population growth rates. Waste management and recycling is a necessary measure in all environmentally sensitive sites [28].\n\nWhile the seasonal monsoonal/cyclonic environment imposes many unique needs in base construction, operations and maintenance, many of these are not dissimilar to traditional hardening needs in basing built to withstand or resist bombing attacks. A Hardened Aircraft Shelter, submarine pen, or bunker capable of surviving a supersonic concrete piercing warhead will survive any conceivable cyclone. The design and placement of shelters is discussed in Annex A.\n\nAnother important consideration in basing design is sizing for platforms. In airfields, this is primarily an issue in terms of runway surface strength and length, in naval wharfs, the draft available and strength of the wharf structure. These constraints determine the size of the aircraft or warships which can use the facility.\n\nThe possibility that any regional contingency may escalate, to the extent that United States assets might need to deploy into larger Australian bases, dictates a need to size runways for the full spectrum of United States aircraft types, and wharfs/piers for the drafts of all United States warships and logistical vessels, the latter including RORO ships and prepositioning vessels.\n\nAn airfield capable of sustained high tempo operations by the full spectrum of military aircraft at high gross weights dictates the use of a US Air Force AFH-32-1084 âheavy loadâ compliant MOB arrangement, an example of which is runway 6R/24L at Andersen AFB, Guam, with dimensions of 11,204 x 200 ft. / 3,415 x 61 m, and a rigid concrete surface with a strength rating of PCN 99 /R/A/W/T [29][30].\n\nThe same rationale leads to a requirement for major naval replenishment facilities compliant with a MIL-HDBK-1025/UFC, with a pier plumbed for POL, and capable of Roll-On Roll-Off transfers of vehicles and materiel [31].\n\nOne advantage which accrues from this philosophy is that it yields greater freedom to the ADF in the longer term, in acquiring platforms, as basing infrastructure sizing is not a constraint.\n\nStrategic Constraints for Indian Ocean Basing\n\nThe relative importance of Australia's bases across the Pilbara, Kimberley, Northern Territory and Indian Ocean Offshore Territories depends in large part on what strategic priorities are assumed, in what type of conflict.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the priority in basing was initially in the Northern Territory and Cape York, to provide support for operations in New Guinea and the Solomons. As the Japanese forces in New Guinea and the Solomons collapsed, the Pilbara and Kimberley gained importance, as the focus of strike operations shifted to Java, Borneo and Malaya.\n\nThe need to protect, across a wide range of scenarios, the Pilbara oil and gas industry, raises the strategic value of basing infrastructure in the Pilbara. The future development of the offshore Browse and Bonaparte Basins in the Kimberley will see its priority increase in time. These vulnerabilities exist in addition to the Timor Sea oil and gas industry, which raises the priority of Kimberley and Northern Territory basing.\n\nIf we assume that the principal purpose of basing across the North-West is the defence of the oil, gas and mining industry infrastructure, then equal priority needs to be accorded to all of these geographical areas, in terms of basing air defence fighters, LRMP aircraft, and supporting submarines on ASW patrols. This leads to the conclusion that the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal bases be upgraded to support sustained operations by RAAF fighters, tankers and future P-8A Poseidon LRMP aircraft or Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV/UAV).\n\nSuch an upgrade strategy is viable, given adequate AEW&C, Tanker and escorting air cover is available, if the strategic posture is reactive, in the sense that an attacker has freedom of choice in choosing the time and place of an attack. Under conditions where the JORN OTH-B system can provide early warning, a fighter CAP, Wedgetail AEW&C and tanker would be launched to effect an intercept. A clever opponent can reverse direction and fly home before the intercept can be effected, resulting in a mission kill against the defending side. This âbait and switchâ tactic can be played ad nauseum, literally at the expense of the ADF in aircrew hours, fuel burn and maintenance.\n\nAn important and very general consideration in the use of air power is that transit time from a base to an area of combat operations is time during which assets are unproductive, yet incurring full operating costs. Operational economics always favours basing at the shortest practical distance. Staying out of the reach of opposing air power and ballistic missiles favours the converse.\n\nThe âbait and switchâ tactic becomes non-viable if RAAF fighters are based on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island, as the attacker has to contend with the possibility of repeated engagements, as intercepts may be initiated from the island air basing against both inbound and outbound attackers.\n\nWhat the Indian Ocean Offshore Territories offer is depth in the defence of the sea-air gap. An opponent must first overwhelm the bases on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island before they can even consider attacks against targets in the Pilbara and Kimberley. In effect, military airfields emplaced on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island extend Australia's defensive depth in the sea-air gap out to well beyond 1,000 nautical miles.\n\nThis model is predicated on the use of a wholly reactive strategic posture, which may be politically inevitable in any dispute which has yet to escalate into full scale combat operations.\n\nThere are also clear advantages in the use of airfields in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island if the strategic intent is denial operations in South East Asia, involving air strikes on shipping and land targets. While such targets are within reach of tanker supported fighters operating from RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal, sortie rates will be constrained by both distance and cruise speeds.\n\nThe advantages in the use of airfields in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island for basing LRMP aircraft are equally pronounced, as time on station increases with decreasing distance to the patrol area. Submarines performing ASW patrols in the Indian Ocean could replenish fuel, expended munitions and swap personnel with minimum loss of availability but using facilities in the Pilbara and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.\n\nIn air operations, high sortie ranges involving either long range fighter sorties or long duration fighter sorties, both of which require tanker support, are very demanding in fuel burn, which presents the need for high volume fuel replenishment, especially for tanker aircraft. Consumption for a fighter squadron supported by tankers can run into hundreds of tonnes daily at high operational tempo.\n\nThe strategy followed in some NATO nations, and some Persian Gulf nations, was to lay POL pipelines between oil refineries located near major ports, and major airbases. This permitted high volume sustained aviation fuel supplies to these bases, enabling in turn intensive operations using tankers [32].\n\nThe high volume production of natural gas in the Pilbara and Timor Sea, and future production in the Kimberley, opens up the option of aviation fuel production within the region, using either condensate, or Fischer-Tropsch technology gas-to-liquid (GTL) synthetic crude as feedstock. The main prerequisite for a POL pipeline is that a large LNG plant be located within a reasonable distance of an airfield [33].\n\nWithin the immediate future, such plant will be located near Onslow and Karratha in the Pilbara. As the Browse Basin is developed, the Broome/Derby area is likely to acquire an LNG plant.\n\nAn important benefit of a domestically produced synthetic aviation fuel supply is that it can be sold in peacetime to support domestic civilian and military air operational across Australia, and does not incur the wartime risks associated with imported aviation fuel supplies from refineries in Asia, which could be interdicted or otherwise denied.\n\nThe alternatives for the ADF are thus replenishment by sea, using tanker vessels, or the provision of synthetic aviation fuel plant and pipelines to carry aviation fuel to bases. While replenishment by sea presents the lowest peacetime infrastructure investment, it also incurs the greatest wartime risks and costs, as shipping is susceptible to air and submarine attacks. Conversely, a synthetic aviation fuel plant in reasonable or close proximity to an airfield falls within the defensive footprint produced by fighters and LRMP aircraft operating from that airfield.\n\nThe question which then arises is whether it is better to route long pipelines to extant airfields, or construct new airfields in close proximity to established LNG infrastructure?\n\nRAAF Learmonth presents an interesting case study. A synthetic aviation fuel plant co-located with the Chevron facility being constructed at Onslow would require a pipeline of 66 to 120 nautical miles of length, depending on whether it is routed across the seabed or on land only.\n\nThe alternative is the construction of an airfield within 25 nautical miles of Karratha, and locating a synthetic aviation fuel plant on the Burrup Peninsula. While RAAF Learmonth is a dual use airfield, already carrying civilian traffic, its 170 nautical mile distance from Karratha, which is the local population centre, presents pragmatic difficulties in the use of RAAF Learmonth as a âhubâ for civilian air traffic into the Pilbara. If we consider benefits other than in military operations, a new airfield constructed close to Karratha would yield a much better return on investment than routing fuel from a synthetic aviation fuel plant to the extant RAAF Learmonth site.\n\nWhat is abundantly clear is that strategic considerations make a exceptionally strong case for the following basing enhancements:\n\nUpgrades of the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfield runways and taxiways to permit unrestricted operation by all military aircraft types in ADF and United States operational use;\n\nExtensive airfield runway and taxiway hardening, water, stormwater, sewage and waste management upgrades to the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields to permit sustained long duration operational use in combat, or other operations;\n\nHardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS) for the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields capable of surviving hits by a range of modern concrete piercing Precision Guided Munitions;\n\nHardened weapons storage magazines for the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields, capable of holding prepositioned munitions for several weeks of combat ops, and capable of surviving hits by a range of modern concrete piercing Precision Guided Munitions;\n\nHardened personnel accommodation for the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields capable of sustaining several hundred personnel each for several months of combat ops, and capable of surviving hits by a range of modern concrete piercing Precision Guided Munitions;\n\nHardened high delivery rate fuel replenishment and storage infrastructure for the extant RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields, and capable of surviving hits by a range of modern concrete piercing Precision Guided Munitions;\n\nA âdual-useâ large throughput synthetic aviation fuel plant in the Pilbara, located near the Burrup Peninsula or near Onslow, to manufacture in-situ aviation fuel;\n\nA submarine fuel and munitions replenishment facility in the Pilbara region;\n\nA submarine fuel and munitions replenishment facility in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands;\n\nA hardened airfield of similar configuration to the upgraded RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields, located on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands;\n\nA hardened airfield of similar configuration to the upgraded RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields, located on Christmas Island;\n\nThere is also a strong case for constructing a âdual-useâ airfield, of similar configuration to the upgraded RAAF Learmonth, Curtin and Tindal airfields, in close proximity to Karratha, for wartime use as a tanker Main Operating Base and logistical âhubâ, and to provide peacetime access for large or long range commercial aircraft into the Pilbara region. Given the high utility of such an airfield to commercial interests in Western Australia, funding should be contributed by the State Government.\n\nBasing Development of the Pilbara and Kimberley Regions\n\nThe Pilbara and Kimberley are on the verge of another major surge in economic growth, with ongoing oil and gas industry growth, and robust performance in other resource industry sectors.\n\nIncreased construction activity required to implement infrastructure to support the energy and mining sectors will inevitably present synergies which should be exploited where possible to reduce the cost and accelerate the timelines of basing facility improvements.\n\nA case study of a lost opportunity was the construction of the Darwin to Alice Springs railroad extension. No effort was made to exploit the presence of construction personnel and equipment, and lay down a railway spur to RAAF Tindal to provide low cost replenishment of fuel and movement of materiel into the base.\n\nNo less importantly, the extant civilian airfield infrastructure in the Pilbara and Kimberley is mostly an artefact of the 1940s, with a number of airfields constructed around the remnants of wartime installations.\n\nBoth the Pilbara and Kimberley have considerable potential as eco-tourism destinations, but growth in this sector is critically predicated on the availability of airfield infrastructure capable of handling heavy commercial transports, especially the Boeing 747 series and new Airbus A380, which are the backbone of low cost high volume tourist air transport.\n\nThe only substantial airfield between Darwin and Perth is RAAF Learmonth, which is impractical for high volume tourism due to its location, but also limitations in fuel replenishment capability, essential for long range airliner operations. From a strictly commercial perspective, a major civilian or âdual-useâ airfield located in the Pilbara or Kimberley is essential if the potential long term tourism revenues are to be realised.\n\nOther synergies exist and should be exploited.\n\nThe former RAAF Truscott base remains operational as Mungalalu Truscott Airbase, primarily to support offshore gas platforms and local community needs. A runway upgrade compatible with higher gross weight commercial Boeing 737-800 series transports would enable the use of this location as a diversion site for RAAF P-8A Poseidon, Wedgetail AEW&C aircraft, as well as RAAF fighters. An upgrade compatible with commercial Airbus A330-200 would enable the use of this location as a diversion site for RAAF KC-30 tankers, and U.S. Air Force KC-135R and KC-46A tankers. The Anjo Peninsula also has potential as an eco-tourism location, which will not materialise until commercial air traffic can easily access the area.\n\nThere is no major commercial airfield in close proximity to Broome and Derby, which could be used during future infrastructure development to exploit Browse Basin gasfields. Robust development and upgrading of RAAF Curtin would present the opportunity to make it the âdual-use hubâ airfield, permitting heavy airlifter access into the area, and thus cost recovery over time.\n\nRAAF Learmonth is within 3 nautical miles of the Cape Range, which runs along the North West Cape, and provides terrain elevations in excess of 200 metres AMSL. This may present opportunities for the construction of superhardened underground hangars, by tunnelling horizontally into hillsides. Tunneling hangars into hillsides is a very effective airbase hardening technique, used extensively by Switzerland, China and the former Yugoslavia. Spoil produced by tunnelling could be exploited during base upgrades.\n\nAnother synergy which should be exploited is the deployment of the National Broadband Network (NBN) across the Pilbara and Kimberley in coming years. This would present opportunities for secure high bandwidth links into basing infrastructure.\n\nBasing Development of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n\nThe Cocos (Keeling) Islands are a coral âhorseshoe atollâ very similar in most key respects to Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territories, but much smaller in available footprint, with a very shallow lagoon. Therefore, the islands could be developed in a similar fashion to Diego Garcia, using identical or similar construction techniques, albeit on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe Diego Garcia base is a logistical Main Operating Base (MOB) hosting prepositioning ships, POL (Petroleum Oil Lubricant) storage, and an airfield which has been used for heavy bomber strike operations since 1991, but especially during the initial air campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in 2001.\n\nThe principal limitations of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands when compared to Diego Garcia are threefold:\n\nThe first two are that land area of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is only one half that of Diego Garcia, imposing practical limits on the scale of any installation, while the central lagoon is unusable due to its shallow depth.\n\nThe third limitation is that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are within 600 nautical miles of Sumatra and Java, and thus within easy reach of large tactical fighters, or air/sea launched cruise missiles, necessitating significant base hardening and concrete shelters if a base is to be viable for use in wartime.\n\nAn unhardened base on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands would be a liability more than an asset in a modern war, given the global proliferation of smart munitions. Resupply under air attack could also present problems â daily aviation fuel burn alone for a larger deployment would be of the order of hundreds of tonnes or greater.\n\nDiego Garcia presents a good case study for any future development of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for ADF and potential United States basing in a contingency, with the caveat that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is not suitable as a logistical MOB, and would be only used as a Strategic Forward Operating Base.\n\nWhile the existing Cocos (Keeling) Islands runway is adequate for the P-3C Orion, it is borderline for fighter operations due to length limitations, and lacks the surface strength for sustained high tempo operations by heavy aircraft, be they civilian transports, heavy military airlifters, or tankers.\n\nSurvivability in combat dictates dual runways, even if one is only used as a taxiway operationally. The latter, given the need for ~700 ft separation between parallel runways, makes redevelopment of the existing airfield infeasible unless the southern part of West Island is enlarged by landfill into the main lagoon, North Lagoon and South Lagoon.\n\nThe northern part of West Island, currently a defunct palm plantation, would be viable for dual runway construction, and requires only partial landfill in the Northern Lagoon to provide full runway lengths, refer Figure 27.\n\nThis would permit use of the legacy airfield as a redundant fighter runway, or storage area.\n\nThere is sufficient area available for up to 44 Hardened Aircraft Shelters for fighters. Hardened storage for aviation fuel and munition warstocks, and hardened personnel accommodation, would be required, as the Diego Garcia model of moored prepositioning and other logistical ships presents a major vulnerability in wartime. Hardening is essential from both an operational perspective, and to survive seasonal cyclones in situ.\n\nFigure 27. Concept diagram for Cocos (Keeling) Islands redevelopment. This and similar basing arrangements are viable for high tempo combat operations, while providing peacetime eco-tourism potential. Environmental impact is minimised by siting the airfield on the unused coconut plantation, and placing the wharf outside the central lagoon (C. Kopp).\n\nA naval replenishment facility with a MIL-HDBK-1025/UFC compliant pier plumbed for POL, and capable of Roll-On Roll-Off transfers of vehicles and materiel, modelled on Diego Garcia although much smaller, is also feasible at Port Refuge, located at the northern tip of Direction Island, where the seamount falls off rapidly, affording deep anchorage and covert submarine access. Covered âsubmarine shedsâ would be preferable to permit covert replenishment.\n\nA âring roadâ causeway on short pylons would be required to permit road access from the Direction Island wharf to West Island, providing also hardened protection for electrical and optical fibre cables, and POL and water pipelines to a desalination plant.\n\nGiven that the primary purpose of a naval base on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands would be replenishment of warships and submarines, rather than high volume logistical prepositioning of materiel, demands would be much less challenging than at Diego Garcia. Any limited coral dredging near Port Refuge would need to be performed very carefully given the potential for wider environmental damage to the fragile coral ecosystem in the lagoon, if performed poorly.\n\nThe latter is not only intrinsically important, given the value of the islands' fragile habitat, but also given the peacetime potential of the islands as a eco-tourism destination. A port capable of berthing cruise ships, and an airfield compatible with long range airliners, provide a critical enabler for eco-tourism, offsetting some infrastructure costs over the longer term. Environmental considerations are discussed below.\n\nBasing Development of Christmas Island\n\nChristmas Island, given its geological similarity to Guam, presents few problems in development as a major airbase location.\n\nThe abundance of dense and tough volcanic rock on the island permits the construction of a well hardened or superhardened airbase facility with no difficulty.\n\nThe existing Christmas Island airfield site could be readily expanded in the south or south-west direction into a parallel 11,000 ft x 200 ft runway arrangement. The result would be similar to Andersen AFB on Guam, with a runway terminating over a cliff with 900 ft AMSL elevation.\n\nFigure 28. Flying Fish Cove at Christmas Island, with a visiting RAN FFG-7 (Â© Commonwealth of Australia 2011).\n\nFigure 29. Norris Point container facility at Christmas Island (Â© Commonwealth of Australia 2011).\n\nFigure 30. Redevelopment of the existing YPXM airport site into a dual 11,000 ft PCN100 runway system for civil and military use does not present unusual challenges given local terrain (Â© Commonwealth of Australia 2011).\n\nA naval replenishment facility presents significantly greater challenges, as the island has no large natural harbour. The existing Flying Fish Cove facilities built for phospate loading could be expanded and redeveloped, but the site cannot become another Apra Harbor, and severe problems arise seasonally with high sea states.\n\nAn alternate container loading facility exists at Norris Point on the eastern tip of the island, but it is also not a protected harbour.\n\nWithout major development, such as the construction of an artificial seawall, Christmas Island would be viable only for some naval resupply and replenishment activities, under favourable weather conditions, but would not be viable as a naval FOB.\n\nChristmas Island was the intended location for the construction of a major spaceport, with a launch facility at the island's South Point, to be operated by Asia Pacific Space Centre (ASPC) Pty Ltd. It was intended that a major airfield upgrade be performed to support the spaceport.\n\nThe proposal did not eventuate, it appears due to undercapitalisation. The location is suitable for launches into both equatorial and polar orbits.\n\nThe development of a major airfield compatible with 747-400 and A380 airliners would be a critical enabler for the local tourist industry, offsetting infrastructure costs over the longer term.\n\nA detailed study covering a runway upgrade to 8,700 ft (2.65 km) length, with an improved surface to accommodate heavy Boeing 747 and Antonov 124-100 aircraft, was performed by the Department of Transport and Regional Services in 2001, the intent being to provide the capability to support the proposed spaceport.\n\nThe DOTAR submission to the Public Works Committee in 2001 stated [34]:\n\nâNone of the environmental investigations carried out for the preparation of the EIS revealed any significant environmental impediments to the construction of the airport upgrade. Overall, the environmental impacts are considered to be minor.â\n\nAs a hardened military airfield with a âdual-useâ role would inevitably have a larger footprint than the proposed upgrade assessed in 2001, careful consideration will be required to accommodate local environmental constraints, given the fragility of the local ecosystem.\n\nEnvironmental Considerations\n\nThe Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island are acknowledged to be environmentally sensitive, and are widely regarded to be national assets. Both are home to national parks, the Pulu Keeling National Park and the Christmas Island National Park. Both locations host a number of endangered wildlife species, but also a large number of common species found across the atolls and islands of the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIndeed, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are a very typical tropical Indian Ocean atoll, very similar to those found in the Chagos Archipelago of the British Indian Ocean Territories, the Maldives, or some parts of the Seychelles.\n\nConversely, Christmas Island is a volcanic seamount, with a tropical rainforest habitat, and due to geographical isolation, a large number of endemic species. The uniqueness of the wildlife has led to this island being sometimes labelled as the âGalapagos of the Indian Oceanâ.\n\nThe original ecosystems of both the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island have suffered severe damage resulting from human habitation. In the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the native vegetation was mostly replaced with coconut plantations, with only North Keeling Island retaining the original Pisonia forests which covered both atolls. On Christmas Island, open cut phosphate mining led to the destruction of swaths of native rainforest.\n\nMuch greater damage has been produced by invasive introduced species, especially the Yellow Crazy Ant Anoplolepis gracilipes, which is a problem species across the north of Australia, and common pests such as domestic rats, and feral domestic animals. Super colonies of the Yellow Crazy Ant, and the mainland Giant Centipede, Ethmostigmus rubripes, have produced serious environmental damage on Christmas Island, and are implicated in the likely extinction of one endemic species, and serious population losses in others.\n\nAny military facilities to be constructed on either of these sites will require very careful environmental management and planning to ensure that no further damage is produced to the local habitats and especially any endemic species. Moreover, logistical areas of airfields and naval berths must be robustly quarantined from the local habitat to ensure that invasive species which may be âhitch-hikingâ on airlifted pallets, containers or vehicles cannot easily gain access to the rest of the local habitat.\n\nOne advantage of military facilities is that access is inherently controlled, and thus unwanted human access can be largely denied. As a result, hunting, fishing or simple vandalism can be prevented, and feral animal species excluded or eradicated, the latter practice implemented on Diego Garcia. Moreover, controlled access presents opportunities for habitat repair, by replacing introduced vegetation with species previously destroyed. The latter is frequently not appreciated by many radical environmentalists, who have failed to see military installations for the opportunities they present in environmental repair and control.\n\nA military facility will require sewage installations, and a water desalination plant, with capacity to support up to several thousand personnel in a contingency. If implemented correctly, such installations would reduce existing stresses on groundwater supplies, and extant sewage systems.\n\nLarge long term installations involving large numbers of personnel and heavy construction activities over a long period of time can be managed without significant environmental damage. The best case study of regional relevance is the oilfield on Barrow Island, a gazetted A Class Nature Reserve since the early twentieth century. Chevron, formerly WA Petroleum, have operated a substantial oilfield on Barrow Island since the 1970s, and more recently, have commenced the construction of a major LNG plant.\n\nFigure 31. WA Petroleum operated Lufkin oil pump on Barrow Island in 1979. The white protective guard rail beside the pump was retrofitted to ensure that the endemic Barrow Island Euro, Macropus robustus isabellinus, did not have access to the area beneath the rocker arm, where these small kangaroos could suffer injury (Â© 1979 - 2012 Carlo Kopp).\n\nWith a vested interest in retaining access, the company imposed stringent protocols for personnel working on the island. It is not well known that since the late 1970s, all refuse on the island was incinerated to deny its use as a food source for scavenging or predatory species, to ensure that the population balance between species was not perturbed. The company retained high profile advisors to ensure that the environment was carefully monitored, and any unwanted problems rectified [35].\n\nCocos (Keeling) Islands Environmental Considerations\n\nThe principal challenge in the installation and long term operation of a major military airfield on West Island and a naval replenishment site on Dimension Island is ensuring that the fragile habitat of the central lagoon is not damaged.\n\nThis lagoon is home to numerous coral species, a wide range of fish and sea snakes, but importantly is a safe haven for numerous species of sea turtle, especially the endangered Hawksbill sea turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata, and Green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas. Several hundred Hawksbill turtles, and thousands of Green turtles, are estimated to live in this lagoon [36].\n\nA major consideration in the environmental management plan for the construction of the Rumah Baru jetty was ensuring that turtles were not injured by lagoon seabed dredging [37].\n\nDredging presents other risks, specifically as a result of silt carried by currents into areas not being dredged, and causing the death of coral species through suffocation. There are a range of established techniques for dredging to prevent such collateral damage from arising [38].\n\nThe concept for a naval wharf at Direction Island obviates this problem as it is emplaced outside the lagoon proper, with its supporting pylons located on the seabed outside Port Refuge. Subject to exact wharf placement, there may be no requirement for any dredging other than to emplace supporting pylons.\n\nInternal transport of heavy or bulk materiel between Direction Island and West Island could be implemented in two ways. One is transport across the lagoon using either a barge or an LCAC (Landing Craft, Air Cushion), the other is by constructing a âring roadâ around the atoll.\n\nBoth of these options were assessed and rejected during the initial studies which led to the eventual Rumah Baru jetty project, on the basis of cost and some unspecified environmental concerns [39].\n\nA ring road implemented as an elevated causeway connecting the islands of the atoll would not produce large long term environmental impact, as seawater flow between the islets of the atoll would not be impaired by the concrete pylons supporting the prefabricated concrete spans. While this is a costlier option than procuring and operating barges or LCACs, it also does not disturb the lagoon ecosystem, and presents no boatstrike risks to turtles or other marine life [40].\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the transfer of bulk aviation kerosene from a Direction Island terminal to storage tanks on West Island. A six or eight inch pipeline could be laid across the lagoon at low cost, but the long term risk is that saltwater corrosion would result in fuel leaks into the lagoon over time. Embedding the POL pipeline in a âring roadâ minimises pipeline exposure, and permits frequent access for inspection and repairs if required. Moreover, the concrete provides significant tolerance to bomb damage in wartime, and simplifies repairs and recovery.\n\nThe construction of a hardened airfield installation on the northern portion of West Island will not yield significant impacts if properly managed. The vegetation is primarily a coconut plantation. What a hardened airfield does present an opportunity to do in appropriate areas, is the revegetation and thus replacement of the extant introduced plant species with the original species, such as Pisonia grandis, which are still present on North Keeling Island.\n\nAt the time of writing a small scale revegetation effort was under way, by Parks Australia [41].\n\nChristmas Island Environmental Considerations\n\nChristmas Island has suffered serious environmental damage over time, as a result of phosphate mining, but especially the impact of invasive species producing âecological cascade failuresâ across multiple parts of the ecosystem [42].\n\nBeeton et al paint a bleak picture of the ecological situation on Christmas Island: âThe Island has extraordinary terrestrial, subterranean and marine conservation values that are being diminished by management deficiencies and threats that are pervasive, chronic and increasing. Unfortunately, these problems will not have simple solutions. ... The EWG's recommendations set out the long-term and substantial changes that will be required for the successful future management of Christmas Island and its surrounding seas as a single ecological entity. We warn that a 'business as usual' approach in future will mean that management will fail and the extraordinary n"
