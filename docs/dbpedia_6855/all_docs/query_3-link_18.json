        "text": "First, what does ‘doesn’t work’ mean?\n\nI have a reasonable amount of experience with PPG and other physiological signals, however I do not have that specific ttoolbox (and I have no reason to use it because the code I use works foo me).\n\nSecond, what information do you want from that signal?\n\nI notice that in contrast to PPG traces that I am used to, the dicrotic notch seems to be missing. That indicates to me that there could be aortic insufficiency, or that the PPG is taken suitably distally that the vascular system dynamics filter it out.\n\nThe picture at the top is a ppg signal with good signal processing. When this signal is applied to Pulseallyse, features such as sis peak, dic notch, di peak are pulled out well in units of 1 segment, and onset is also well detected.(In the case of this signal, I got it from the Internet and don't know the exact way to process it.)\n\nThe picture at the top shows me directly applying hpf (fc=0.5hz) and lpf (fc=10hz) to raw ppg signals and using them for Pulseanalyse tool. The peak is not detected correctly, and the onset is also not being able to measure correctly. In the above picture, the high quality ppg signal is measured well, while the ppg signal I processed is not detecting the high quality signal either."
