        "text": "2014 marks the centenary of military aviation in Australia. To commemorate this I am writing a six-part series of articles on the key stages of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF): The Early Years – 1914 to 1939 (World War One and the interwar years), World War Two – 1939 to 1945, The Cold War begins and the Korean War – 1945 to 1953, South East Asian Conflicts – 1950 to 1972, Peacekeeping and Modern Conflicts – 1973 to 2014 and finally The Future (the re-equipping of the RAAF).\n\nFollowing decades of conflict, entering the 1970’s saw a shift in roles for the RAAF. This modern era has seen RAAF involvement in many peacekeeping duties (including in the Sinai and East Timor) and humanitarian operations along with major changes in the aircraft fleet. Conflict reared its ugly head again by the 1990’s with the Gulf Wars and Afghanistan War.\n\nThe men and women of the RAAF contributed with professionalism and skill in all these fields of peacetime and combat operations. They continue to do so in 2014 in the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) militant terrorist group in Iraq (they are also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIL. They were originally an extremist splinter group of al Qaeda).\n\nARRIVAL OF THE F-111\n\nThe RAAF placed an original order for 24 General Dynamics F-111C long-range all-weather strike bomber in 1963 but due to long development delays with this highly sophisticated swing wing aircraft with terrain-following radar (which allowed automatic blind low-level flight), the first operational example was not delivered until June 1st, 1973 and the last on December 4th, 1973. As a stop-gap measure No. 1 and 6 Squadrons at RAAF Amberley received 24 new McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II fighter bombers in September/October 1970 that were leased from the USAF until the F-111C could be delivered.\n\nWith the arrival of the F-111C, the leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II aircraft were returned to the United States in 1973. Only 23 were returned though as 1 had unfortunately been lost in an accident in 1971 with the sad loss of both crew members.\n\nThe F-111 was a formidable aircraft capable of flying at Mach 2.5 at altitude, Mach 1.2 at low-level and could carry a heavy payload including air to ground missiles, guided bombs, unguided bombs and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The F-111 was also modified to carry AGM-84 Harpoon anti-shipping missiles.\n\nIn 1979/1980 four of the F-111C aircraft were modified for reconnaissance duties whilst retaining their strike capability and were designated as RF-111C (these were operated by Number 6 Squadron until 2010). The reconnaissance platform was considered one of the best tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the world and won a number of flight competitions up against US and NATO allies during Red Flag exercises held at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.\n\nAn additional 4 F-111C were delivered in 1982 to replace attrition aircraft and in 1992 15 surplus USAF F-111G aircraft were purchased to increase the overall fleet (they were operated from 1993 to 2007). Between 1977 and 1999 eight F-111’s were destroyed in crashes (7 C models and 1 G model) sadly with the loss of 10 air crew.\n\nAlthough never used in combat by the RAAF (excluding reconnaissance over East Timor in 1999), over the years the avionics suite of the F-111’s were upgraded to ensure they remained a deadly asset and deterrent in the modern field of combat. Weapons systems upgrades included Pave Tack forward-looking infra-red radar and a laser target designation pod enabling targeting in all-weather, day or night. These upgrades enabled the F-111 to remain in service with the RAAF for almost 40 years and the last F-111 was retired in 2010 (they were replaced by the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet). She was affectionately known as “The Pig” and 13 are today displayed in various museums in Australia and Hawaii (the rest sadly had to be destroyed as part of an agreement with the United States).\n\nEVACUATION OF SAIGON 1975\n\nThe RAAF probably thought their involvement in Vietnam had ended with the withdrawal of Australian Defence Forces from the Vietnam War in 1972. Unfortunately leading up to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government and the fall of Saigon on April 30th, 1975 a humanitarian crisis was at hand that required peacetime intervention. In March 1975 as part of a program coordinated by the United States, 8 RAAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules and 2 Douglas C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 100 personnel participated in airlift operations to relocate displaced Vietnamese civilians that were fleeing communist North Vietnamese forces. This RAAF force was known as Detachment S. Initially they were based in Saigon but as the situation became more dangerous they were relocated to Bangkok, Thailand and flew into Vietnam each day. By the end of the war Detachment S had relocated 1,100 refugees and carried 900 tonnes of cargo including emergency food and medical supplies.\n\nIn addition the Australian Government made a decision to rescue Vietnamese orphans from near Saigon before they fell into the hands of the North Vietnamese (the United States also aided in rescuing orphaned children and it became known as Operation Babylift). The first RAAF mission was on April 4th, 1975 when 2 C-130E Hercules transport aircraft landed at Tan Son Nhut airport near Saigon from the Butterworth air base in Malaysia. With the aid of volunteer doctors and nurses they evacuated 194 children to Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nA second top-secret mission was undertaken with the deployment of 3 RAAF C-130E’s from No. 37 Squadron. They flew into Ton Son Nhut from Bangkok on April 17th, 1975. 2 of the aircraft were to extract 77 orphans (mostly babies and toddlers) and the third flew in Australian volunteer nurses and medical staff to assist the children and provide medical attention as required. This was dangerous work as the aircraft faced potentially heavy anti-aircraft fire coming into and out of the airfield. The last of the Australian Embassy staff had assembled the children and despite the airfield coming under attack during the evacuation all 3 aircraft and all the orphans were safely airlifted out of Saigon then to Bangkok (1 child sadly died on the flight – all the kids were very dehydrated when they were first evacuated). A specially prepared Qantas Boeing 747 awaited them to return the children, nurses and medical staff back to Australia. The children received full medical attention and were adopted by Australian families for a better life.\n\nOther Detachment S aircraft also airlifted the last of some 80 Australian civilians (mostly embassy staff and their families) out of Saigon on April 25th, 1975 (they also evacuated embassy staff and families from Phnom Penh, Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge took over there that same month). The last Australian military personnel evacuated from Vietnam were 4 RAAF Air Defence Guards that same day. Amazingly they had to wait at the airfield with just a pistol and 4 rounds each as the enemy fast approached, until a Hercules could land and get them out of there. They had no idea what was happening as they had no means of communication so it in an understatement that it must have been a huge relief to see that big Herc appear!\n\nIn early May 1975 as part of a United Nations operation, 2 No. 37 Squadron C-130’s designated Detachment N began transporting cargo around South East Asia and conducted the evacuation of Australian embassy staff from Vientiane, Laos in early June 1975 before that nation also fell to communist forces. The Detachment N mission ended in June 1975 after flying 91 sorties for the United Nations.\n\nNEW AIRCRAFT ENTER RAAF SERVICE 1978 TO 1982\n\nOrion\n\nThe Lockeed P-3 Orion long-range maritime patrol aircraft with a 15 hour operational endurance replaced the earlier Lockheed P-2 Neptune in RAAF service. No. 11 Squadron first received 10 P-3B variants from January 1969. No. 10 Squadron received 10 of the newer and more capable P-3C variants between February 1978 and January 1979. Both squadrons were based at RAAF Edinburgh in South Australia when they began Orion operations and remain there today (given the size of the country, this relatively central base allows for rapid deployment anywhere in the country). The P-3C was equipped with improved avionics and sensors and signified a major leap in patrol capability and submarine detection. The P-3C was also able to fire AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles to further increase its offensive capability. In 1982 10 more P-3C were ordered to replace the earlier P-3B models (they were sold to Portugal).\n\nIn addition to patrolling the Australian coastline. From 1981 onwards a detachment of Orion aircraft from both No. 10 and 11 Squadrons has been deployed to the Butterworth Air Force Base in Malaysia (once an RAAF base) to assist in maritime patrol as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) with Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis base has had a long RAAF association since 1957 and the Malaya Emergency (1948-1960). Following the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan and increased naval presence in the Indian Ocean, one of the key roles of the Orion’s at Butterworth during the Cold War was monitoring and tracking Soviet nuclear and diesel submarine and ship movements (destroyers, cruisers and transports) from the South China Sea, through the Straights of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean. This was known as Operation Gateway and the Soviet craft were heavily monitored between 1981 to 1989 to deter their military presence and aggression away from regional bases and shipping.\n\nRAAF Orion aircraft would fly very low and close to the ships on multiple passes taking photos and gathering intelligence. One famous mission was the “persecution” as the RAAF put it, of a Soviet “Echo II” nuclear powered cruise missile submarine between February 21st to 25th, 1982. During that period No. 10 Squadron Orion’s tracked the sub with radar and the dropping of sonobuoys basically just harassing it out of the region!\n\nFrom 2002 onwards the P-3C fleet received significant improvements with upgrades in avionics and sensor equipment including digital multi-mode radar and electro-optics detectors (infra-red and visual). The aircraft were then re-designated as the AP-3C and continue to serve the RAAF today.\n\nBoeing 707\n\nIn 1979 the RAAF lacked long-range transport aircraft and purchased 2 ex-Qantas Boeing 707 aircraft to fill this transport void (including VIP transport of the Australian Prime Minister and visiting dignitaries such as Queen Elizabeth II). They were assigned to No. 37 Squadron at RAAF Richmond in New South Wales to operate alongside the C-130 Hercules. In 1981 the 707’s were transferred to No. 33 Flight, which became No. 33 Squadron in 1983 with the addition of 2 more ex-Qantas 707’s. In 1987 all 4 of the Boeing 707 aircraft were converted to be dual transports and air-to-air refueling tankers by Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) and Hawker de Havilland. Special fuel delivery tanks were fitted along with wing mounted hose and drogue pods, which were essential to refuel the new F/A-18 Hornet fighter. The first of these converted tankers was delivered in 1990.\n\nIn 1988 an additional 3 Boeing 707 aircraft were obtained (ex-Saudia Airlines). 2 were used as transports and 1 was purely for spare parts to keep these aging aircraft flying (the Qantas examples were all delivered to the airline circa 1965). Sadly 1 of the additional transports was lost with its 5 man crew in a crash off the coast of Gippsland in Victoria on October 29th, 1991. The 707 fleet conducted numerous transport and refueling missions for the RAAF including transporting personnel to United Nations peacekeeping duties and deployment to the Persian Gulf region in 1998 to refuel Coalition aircraft operating over Iraq. On June 30th, 2008 the last Boeing 707 was retired from RAAF service (they were old and failing noise and pollution requirements by that stage of their career!).\n\nPEACEKEEPING 1970’s TO 1980’s\n\nSince first established the RAAF has supported numerous United Nations peacekeeping operations from Asia to the Middle East. In the 1950’s this was predominately combat missions but following this period they became more oriented to peacekeeping duties.\n\nKashmir 1975 to 1979\n\nAs part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation, Australian military observers were deployed to the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan from 1952 to 1985 (the peacekeeping operation still continues today with other nations contributing observers). These two nations have had numerous disputes which have resulted in combat in this region since they gained independence from Great Britain in 1947.\n\nFrom March 1975 to late November 1979 the RAAF played a small role by providing a de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou transport from No. 38 Squadron to support the observers. This aircraft was a huge time saver in quickly delivering personnel, equipment and supplies in rugged mountainous terrain that would take many hours by road otherwise. One key mission for the aircraft was to transport the UN Chief Military Observer to visit various observation stations along the ceasefire line. Every 6 months the aircraft was rotated with another from Australia and the squadron flew 1,800 hours in the Kashmir supporting the UN.\n\nThe Middle East 1976 to 1979\n\nA significant deployment was in Egypt at Ismalia from 1976 to 1979 as part of the second United Nations Emergency Force II (UNEF II) to monitor a cease-fire agreement in the Sinai desert between Egypt and Israel following the Yom Kippur War fought from October 6th to 25th, 1973. The RAAF deployed 45 air and ground personnel with 4 Bell UH-1H Iroquois that were painted white with UN markings from No. 5 Squadron. The helicopters flew observers around the region to monitor the ceasefire and also carried supplies and equipment as required. By the time the detachment finished their mission and returned home in October 1979 they had flown 10,000 sorties and transported 22,500 passengers!\n\nThe Middle East 1982 to 1986\n\nIn early 1982 No. 9 Squadron deployed 8 Bell UH-1H Iroquois helicopter with crews and support personnel to the Sinai in Egypt as part of the United Nations Multi-National Force and Observers (MFO) to monitor the Israeli withdrawal from the region (after decades of conflict Egypt and Israel had finally made peace). The squadron deployment remained in the Sinai desert until 1986. The helicopters flew observers around the region along with carrying supplies and equipment for the operation.\n\nCHANGING OF THE GUARD\n\nThe F/A-18 Hornet Arrives\n\nWith the Dassault Mirage IIIO fleet ageing, the RAAF looked at both the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighters as a replacement. In 1981 the F/A-18 was selected and deliveries were made from 1984 to 1990 of 57 F/A-18A single seat fighters and 18 two-seat F/A-18B combat capable training variants (the last F/A-18B was delivered in December 1988). The first 2 aircraft were manufactured in the United States with the remaining 73 being licence-built at the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) in Victoria. The first Australian assembled airframe (A21-103) took off on its maiden flight at Avalon airport on February 26th, 1985.\n\nThe first 14 Hornets were delivered to No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (2OCU) at RAAF Williamtown (NSW) for immediate instructor pilot training which commenced on August 19th, 1985. On August 29th, 1986 No. 3 Squadron at RAAF Williamtown received the first Hornet’s for operational service. Hornet’s in No. 77 Squadron become operational at RAAF Williamtown in May 1987 and were followed by No. 75 Squadron in September 1988 at RAAF Tindal, Northern Territory (the last Mirage IIIO squadron).\n\nAlthough at Mach 1.8 the F/A-18 was slower than the Mach 2.2 Mirage IIIO it was significantly more advanced, maneuverable and capable given it was fitted with modern weaponry, a pulse-doppler look-down shoot-down radar, inertial navigation system, a heads-up display and since 1991 a forward-looking infra-red (FLIR) pod that were all firsts for the RAAF. At the time, this aircraft gave Australia a significant regional technology edge in air defence.\n\nThe Hornet has participated in many military exercises with allied nations, has seen operational service during the Gulf Wars, Afghanistan and provided air defence for Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings, G-20 Summits and the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Australia. In addition aircraft are frequently deployed to Butterworth Malaysia and Singapore to participate in air defence commitments to the five-power Integrated Air Defence System (IADS) that involves Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nFirst Female RAAF Pilots\n\nWomen had been part of the RAAF for decades but never as pilots (although many were qualified as such). They served in various ground roles in the Women’s Air Training Corps (WATC April 1939 to March 1941) which then became the Women’s Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAF March 1941 to 1947 when disbanded) and then the Women’s Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF 1951 to 1976). During their time in the WRAAF women enlisted for 4 years and as a real sign of the times received only two-thirds of the equivalent men’s pay and were discharged from service upon getting married!\n\nIn 1977 the WRAAF was fully integrated into the RAAF. Women in the RAAF then received equal pay and privileges but still were not allowed to fly. This all changed in 1987 though when the first women entered the RAAF 144 Pilots Course at Number 2 Flying Training School at RAAF Pearce, Western Australia and graduated on June 30th, 1988. They were Flight Lieutenant Robyn Williams and Pilot Officer Deborah Hicks. Williams was the dux of the course and went on to become a flying instructor in 1992, the first RAAF female test pilot (flying with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit at RAAF Edinburgh) and Australian project lead on the C-130J program in the USA from 1995 to 2000 becoming a Wing Commander and returning to Australia that year. Hicks served with Number 34 Squadron flying VIP transports, promoted to Flying Officer in 1990 she left the RAAF in 1990.\n\nIn other significant firsts, Wing Commander Linda Corbould became the first female Commanding Officer of a squadron in 2003 with No. 36 Squadron (they flew C-130’s transports during that period and since 2006 fly the C-17 Globemaster III) and in 2014 Squadron Leader Marija Jovanovich became the first Australian in 25 years to graduate from the USAF Test Pilot School and only the second ever female RAAF test pilot.\n\nSquadron Leader Marija Jovanovich completed the intense 48 week USAF Test Pilot School course at USAF Edwards AFB in California after 2,500 hours of academic training and 120 hours flying 23 different aircraft types from leading edge combat aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon to a crusty old Antonov An-2 Colt biplane! Quite a prestigious achievement indeed which resulted in a posting to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at RAAF Edinburgh.\n\n“It was the most difficult, the most demanding but ultimately the most rewarding course I’ve ever done.” – Squadron Leader Marija Jovanovich\n\nRAAF Helicopters transfer to the Army\n\nThe first helicopter to fly with the RAAF came into service in 1947 (Sikorsky S-51 Dragonfly) and after almost 40 years of helicopter operations a Defence Force decision was made In 1986 to transfer all battlefield helicopter assets from the RAAF to the Royal Australian Army. The last helicopter to fly with the RAAF was formally retired in 1990.\n\nIn 1989 to 1990 the RAAF transferred 25 Bell UH-1H Iroquois to the Army’s No. 171 Squadron and Aviation School at Oakey and No. 5 Aviation Regiment at Townsville (they had been in service since 1968 and all were retired in 2007). RAAF No. 9 Squadron received Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk helicopters In February 1988 but after conversion training they relocated to Townsville, Queensland for formal transfer of the helicopters, crews and ground personnel to form the Australian Army 5th Aviation Regiment (by 1991 they had received 39 Blackhawk’s).\n\nRAAF No. 12 Squadron had operated 12 Boeing CH-47C Chinook heavy lift helicopters in an Army support role since 1974 (Australia was the first foreign customer for the Chinook). They were used in many roles from general transport to airlifting damaged helicopters and retrieving World War Two aircraft wrecks from Papua New Guinea to be restored in museums and the like. 2 were involved in accidents in 1975 and 1985, with the first one being repaired and put back into service in 1981 while the latter was relegated to a training aid in 1986. In 1989 the government decided to reduce costs by withdrawing the 11 remaining Chinook from operations but it was soon decided that the new Blackhawk helicopters could not replace their heavy lift capability. A subsequent agreement was made to sell 7 Chinooks to the US Army for $40,000,000 and trade the other 4 C models for the newer D model. The CH-47D’s were received by the Australian Army in 1991.\n\nPEACEKEEPING 1990’s\n\nUnited Nations Missions 1990’s\n\nWith the end of the Cold War in 1991 the 1990’s became a very busy period of peacekeeping duties for the United Nations. The Australian military were involved in various UN missions in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and regional non-Un missions in the Pacific region. The RAAF provided logistics (Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Boeing 707 for transporting personnel and equipment), communications, air traffic control and medical support to UN operations in Cambodia (1992), Somalia (1992) and Rwanda (1995). In a regional deployment between 1997 to 1998 to support peace talks to end the civil war in Bougainville, members of the RAAF operated there in a medical capacity and as part of the Peace Monitoring Group. Then in 1999 East Timor erupted into chaos.\n\nEast Timor 1999\n\nEast Timor was a former colony of Portugal. In 1975 Indonesia invaded East Timor and ruled in a repressive manner for the next 24 years resulting in many deaths of the East Timorese from violence, starvation and disease. In 1999 under some persuasive pressure from the Australian government, Indonesia offered East Timor a referendum for independence or the option to be an autonomous province of Indonesia.\n\nThe United Nations assisted in facilitating the August 1999 voting process and during this period law and order was maintained by Australian police. Pro-Indonesian militia used intimidation and violence to attempt to deter voters but despite this 95% of eligible voters turned out and more than a 75% majority voted for independence from Indonesia. The nation then exploded with the pro-Indonesian militia committing acts of violence, atrocity and destruction killing many East Timorese and rendering thousands homeless. Indonesian military and police forces in East Timor stood by and did nothing to stop this violence.\n\nThis was unacceptable and resulted in an international outcry. Indonesia bowed to pressure and in September 20th, 1999 and let the United Nations authorised and Australian lead International Force East Timor (INTERFET) under the command of Major General Peter Cosgrove into East Timor to negate pro-Indonesian militia forces and restore law and order (INTERFET was a multinational peacekeeping operation of 22 nations including New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, USA and Portugal provided 9,908 personnel with half the troops provided by Australia. This was known as Operation Warden) . This was complicated by the fact that regular Indonesian forces were still in the former province of Indonesia and tension between INTERFET and Indonesian troops was high (they did not withdraw from East Timor until October 31st, 1999). INTERFET was far better armed and organised than the militia and soon took control of the port, airport and capital of Dili. The next step was control of the surrounding countryside to enable the East Timorese to return to a normal life. With the worst of the military situation settled, in February 2000 INTERFET handed over the operation to the United Nations to help the fledgling nation continue to recover and develop (Australian forces remained within this UN force).\n\nRAAF involvement in East Timor included the movement of troops, equipment and supplies aboard 13 Lockheed C-130C Hercules from No. 36 and 37 Squadrons and 3 de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou transports of No. 35 and 38 Squadrons. DHC-4 aircraft were based in East Timor during Operation Warden along with other RAAF detachments including No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron.\n\nMaritime patrols were conducted by 5 Lockheed AP-3C Orion aircraft from No. 10 and 11 Squadrons and reconnaissance flights were conducted by General Dynamics RF-111C aircraft from No. 6 Squadron operating out of RAAF Tindal in the Northern Territory. These recon flights were conducted with Indonesian diplomatic approval and started on the October 31st, 1999 withdrawal of Indonesian forces from East Timor and were the first time the F-111 had been used operationally in its then 25 years of service with the RAAF (these missions continued until December 9th, 1999 when INTERFET had control over the violence in East Timor).\n\nDiplomatic tensions were high in 1999 between Indonesia and Australia (and remained tense for a number of years there after). As such during the conflict 12 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C Hornet fighters from No. 75 Squadron and 10 F-111C strike aircraft from No. 1 and 6 Squadrons along with various support aircraft including 3 Pilatus PC-9A Forward Air Control (FAC) aircraft, 3 Boeing 707 tankers and a Dassault Falcon 900 VIP transport were deployed to RAAF Tindal to act as a deterrent and in preparedness for any escalation in the conflict by Indonesia. Luckily they were not required to go into combat\n\nAFGHANISTAN, IRAQ AND THE WAR ON TERROR 2001 TO 2012\n\nOperation Slipper (Afghanistan)\n\nSeptember 11th became a date of infamy in the western world when in 2001 the Al Qaeda terrorist group hijacked passenger aircraft to attack the World Trade Centre in New York City and the Pentagon in Virginia killing almost 3,000 innocent people. The international response condemned the group and military action by coalition forces was implemented against them and the Taliban government in Afghanistan that supported them to destroy their ability to attack on such a massive scale ever again.\n\nCommenced in 2001 and completed in December 2014, Operation Slipper was the Australian Defence Force contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. In addition to combating terrorism, other duties included maritime patrol in the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) and to monitor and control pirates in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe RAAF deployed 4 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet fighters and seventy personnel from the famous No. 77 Squadron to the Indian Ocean base of Diego Garcia (a territory of the UK) on November 9th, 2001 until February 10th, 2002. The squadrons role was to provide combat air patrol cover for coalition forces based there, including USAF heavy bombers like the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress that were involved directly on combat sorties in Afghanistan.\n\nNo. 77 Squadron was replaced by No. 3 Squadron from February 10th, 2002 until the deployment returned to Australia on May 21st, 2002. The threat to the island was minimal and nothing much happened out there other than being scrambled a few times for what proved to be false threats. The deployment did free up US and UK combat aircraft though, which enabled them to operate closer to the front.\n\nThe RAAF also deployed 2 No. 33 Squadron Boeing 707 tanker/transports and support personnel from RAAF Amberley to Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan to provide air-to-air refueling of Coalition aircraft operating in the region from March to September 2002. Their efforts contributed to a Meritorious Service Citation for sustained outstanding service in warlike operations.\n\n2 RAAF Lockheed AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft were deployed from 2001 to 2012 to the Middle East and 3 Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports were deployed to the region to support the mission of the Australian Defence Force throughout Operation Slipper. Personnel were also deployed to the RAAF Control and Reporting Centre at Kandahar International Airport in Afghanistan.\n\n3 RAAF IAI Heron remotely piloted aircraft were deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2009. In support of the Australian military and coalition partners, the Heron detachment completed more than 27,000 hours conducting real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions during Operation Slipper. The final IAI Heron mission was remotely flown from Kandahar on November 30th, 2014 and the detachment left Afghanistan in December 2014.\n\nOperation Falconer (Iraq) 2003\n\nIn the Second Gulf War the RAAF supported Australian and Coalition forces in the fighting with Iraq. 620 RAAF ground personnel along with 14 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet fighters (predominately from Number 75 Squadron), 2 Lockheed P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft and 3 Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports were committed to the fight under Operation Falconer in February 2003. After Iraq failed to comply with UN resolutions Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced on March 19th/20th, 2003 with coalition attacks on key Iraqi targets. The RAAF Hornet fighters were used to conduct Combat Air Patrols, close air support and strike attacks when required (between March 20th and May 2nd, 2003).\n\nThis marked the first time since 1960 during the Malaya Emergency that RAAF fighters had been used in offensive operations (all other fighter operations and deployments had not seen combat since then) and on March 22nd, 2003 Hornet A21-22 dropped the first bomb from an RAAF aircraft on an enemy target since 1972 during the Vietnam War (by Canberra bombers back then). Key Iraqi targets during this period included strikes on the 10th Armoured Division Headquarters and a facility used by the Iraqi Intelligence Service using laser guided bombs. Most of the missions conducted by the RAAF Hornet fighters were for close air support on targets including Iraqi airbases, artillery and tanks as the Iraqi Air Force was effectively grounded very early in the conflict. The Hornet fighters flew 350 sorties and dropped more than 120 Laser Guided Bombs during Operation Falconer.\n\nOne significant mission during this conflict was to provide close air support to the Australian Special Air Service (SAS) and 4RAR Battalion Commandos as they assaulted and captured Al Asad airfield on April 12th, 2003. This was a key Iraqi airbase and marked the first time RAAF aircraft had provided close air support for Australian troops since the Vietnam War. According to the Sydney Morning Herald the Australian troops captured 57 Soviet-made MiG fighters, helicopters, anti-aircraft batteries, helicopters and 7.9 million kilograms of munitions following the capture of the base.\n\nThe RAAF C-130’s provided an airlift capability to coalition forces during the conflict but following the capture of Baghdad they started to transport supplies for humanitarian aid in Iraq. The majority of RAAF assets returned to Australia at the end of the conflict in May 2003.\n\nPEACEKEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS 2000’s & 2010’s\n\nSolomon Islands 2003 and 2006\n\nDuring civil and political unrest in the Solomon Islands in both 2003 and 2006 the Australian Defence Forces deployed to the island as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Island (RAMSI) to restore law and order. In 2003 RAAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft transported military, police and civilian personnel from fifteen countries to the capital of Honiara to aid RAMSI and repeated the mission again in 2006. RAAF No. 38 Squadron also deployed de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou aircraft to provide logistics support. They operated from Honiara airport and facilitated rapid deployment between the islands.\n\nSudan 2005 to 2011\n\nThe United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) between 2005 and 2011 was conducted to aid in peacekeeping operations with the separation of the nation into North and South Sudan following the declaration of independence by South Sudan in 2005. The RAAF contributed to this mission with the deployment of Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft to transport UN personnel, equipment and supplies.\n\nHumanitarian Missions 2002 to 2014\n\nThe RAAF was busy in this period providing humanitarian aid in response to natural disasters and acts of terrorism around the world. These included Medical evacuations of victims of the Bali bombings in 2002 from Indonesia to Australia, transporting medical staff and equipment to Iran (2003) following a devastating earthquake, Thailand (2004) following the Boxing Day tsunami and Pakistan (2005) following another devastating earthquake. Disaster relief was also provided at home by the RAAF including during Cyclone Larry that hit north-eastern Australia in 2006.\n\nMore recently the RAAF provided air bases and AP-3 Orion and C-130 Hercules aircraft to aid in the still to be resolved multi-nation search of the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean. This was known as Operation Southern Indian Ocean and 7 other nations (China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, the UK and the United States) contributed to the search including flying 344 missions over 42 days searching across more than 4.5 million square kilometres of the ocean’s surface operating as far as 2,000 kilometres from Perth in Western Australia (the mission ended April 29th, 2014)! The air mission was unsuccessful and continued as a more cost-effective surface search. The RAAF received worldwide coverage for their efforts in leading the search to find the wreckage of MH370 in the vastness of the Indian Ocean.\n\nCURRENT RAAF INVENTORY\n\nAs of 2014 the RAAF operates a modern fleet of aircraft that originated from either the United States or Europe. Predominately the aircraft are from Boeing (including McDonnell Douglas which they took over) and Airbus Industries.\n\nTRAINING AIRCRAFT\n\nPotential pilot candidates who pass the RAAF selection process and Officer Training School at RAAF East Sale are sent to the ADF Basic Flying Training School in Tamworth, New South Wales to commence the Basic Flying Course. The basic training is provided by civilian contractor BAE Systems Australia (since 1999) using the Pacific Aerospace Corporation CT-4B Airtrainer.\n\nThe RAAF formerly operated 37 CT-4A Airtrainer’s from 1975, then added an additional 14 in 1980. The trainer was removed from RAAF service in 1992 and basic training was then conducted by civilian contractors.\n\nPilatus PC-9/A\n\nThe primary training aircraft of the RAAF is the Pilatus PC-9/A two-seat, single-engine turboprop trainer. The PC-9 was first delivered to the RAAF in 1987 and the last was delivered in 1992 (67 were ordered and 65 remain in service) and the first training course was conducted on the type in 1989. They replaced the Aermacchi MB.326 jet trainer. The PC-9 is primarily operated by No. 2 Flying Training School (2FTS) at RAAF Pearce in Western Australia for advanced pilot training and the Central Flying School (CFS) at RAAF East Sale in Victoria for the training of flying instructors.\n\nThe FTS receives pilots who have completed the Basic Flying Course at the ADF Basic Flying Training School then they undertake the Advanced Flying Training Course flying 130 hours in the PC-9. Pilots that pass this final course are then assigned to operational squadrons for further training (according to the RAAF only one-third of the graduates are considered suitable for the rigours of fast jet flying. They progress to fighter training on the Hawk 127).\n\nJoint Terminal Attack Controllers\n\n4 modified Pilatus PC-9A(F) aircraft are based at the Forward Air Control Development Unit at RAAF Williamtown in New South Wales to train Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (Forward Air Controllers) to coordinate air support for ground troops. These aircraft are painted in a low-visibility grey scheme and are fitted with smoke grenade launchers to mark targets for air strikes from fighter aircraft.\n\nThe Roulettes\n\nThe RAAF Roulettes demonstration team (formed in 1970) have flown the Pilatus PC-9 since 1990 (replacing the Aermacchi MB.326 jet). They fly aerobatic performances in 6 PC-9’s (with a spare) all over Australia. The Roulettes pilots are all flying instructors and the team is part of the Central Flying School (CFS) based at RAAF East Sale. In over 20 years of controlled but extreme demonstration flying, the team has only lost five aircraft in accidents (3 Aermacchi MB.326 jets in two separate mid-air collisions in 1983 and 1988, sadly resulting in the death of 2 pilots in the 1983 incident, a PC-9 in a mid-air collision in 2005 and another following an engine failure in 2011). The Roulettes are the public face of the RAAF and highly popular around the nation, forming a highlight of any air show (a great recruiting tool).\n\nHawk 127\n\nThe BAE Hawk 127 is operated by the RAAF as a lead-in fighter trainer to prepare pilots for operational conversion to the Hornet and Super Hornet fighters. The trainer is fitted with modern avionics and systems to familiarise pilots with combat jet flying including an integrated communications. navigation and attack system, head-up display (HUD), multi-function displays (MFD) and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The first of 33 Hawk aircraft RAAF entered service in 2000 and are operated by No. 79 Squadron at RAAF Pearce and No. 76 Squadron at RAAF Williamtown.\n\nNo. 79 Squadron conducts the 14 week Introductory Fighter Course which includes general flight training, navigation training and flying with instruments, at night and in formation. Graduates then progress to No. 76 Squadron to commence a 20 week course in air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons training. (the Hawk 127 can be fitted with Mk.82 bombs, AIM-9M Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and a 30mm cannon). If successful the graduated pilots then move on to the operational fighter squadrons.\n\nCOMBAT AIRCRAFT\n\nClassic Hornet\n\n55 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet multi-role fighters and 16 F/A-18B’s two-seat training variants (fully combat capable) are currently in RAAF service (delivered 1984 to 1990). Over the years the “Classic Hornet” has received numerous weapons and avionics upgrades along with airframe strengthening to keep them capable of engaging effectively in the field of modern combat. The Hornet fighters will remain in service until the full introduction of the Lockheed-Martin F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter which is planned to first arrive in Australia in 2018 and enter full RAAF operational service between 2020 and 2023 (more on the F-35A in my next RAAF post).\n\nThe F/A-18 is operated by No. 3 and 77 Squadrons, and No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (2OCU for pilot training) which are all based at RAAF Williamtown (NSW), along with No. 75 Squadron based at RAAF Tindal (NT). Each squadron is allocated 1 or 2 F/A-18B’s for training, 1 is with Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at RAAF Edinburgh for weapons/avionics testing and the remainder equip 2OCU for pilot conversion training.\n\nThe Hornet is capable of carrying a wide range of air-to-air/ground weaponry to supplement its M61 nose mounted 20mm cannon. These include the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM), Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM), Mk. 82 bombs and even AGM-84 Harpoon anti-shipping missiles if required.\n\nSuper Hornet\n\n24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet strike fighters (known as the “Rhino”) are operated by the RAAF. The Super Hornets were delivered for operational service between 2010 and 2012 with No. 1 and 6 Squadrons at RAAF Amberley (QLD). They achieved full operational service in December 2012. Originally 12 of these highly sophisticated strike aircraft were purchased as an interim solution to cover the gap of the retirement of the F-111 in 2010 and the introduction of the Lockheed-Martin F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (from 2018). The Super Hornet has proven to be very popular and is so effective that more were ordered and they will be retained and operated alongside the F-35A with most of the Super Hornet fighters also being fitted out for electronic warfare in the future (more on that in my next RAAF post).\n\nThe F/A-18F Super Hornet is larger than the F/A-18A Hornet and carries a much larger weapons payload for both air and ground attack missions. Weaponry includes the standard M61A2 nose mounted 20 mm cannon along with AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), AGM-84 Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, AGM-154C Joint Stand-off Weapon (JSOW) and Guided Bomb Unit GBU-54 Laser JDAM munitions. Very capable indeed (this capability has already been tested in combat and proven highly successful – see below)!\n\nAIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL\n\nWedgetail\n\n6 Boeing E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft (AEW&C) were delivered to No. 2 Squadron between 2009 to 2012. These aircraft are based off the Boeing 737 airframe with highly sophisticated avionics and a radar mounted on the spine of the airframe. The Wedgetail has added a sorely needed asset to the RAAF inventory and now allows total control of Australian air space (in conjunction with ground radar) to track and vector friend or foe."
