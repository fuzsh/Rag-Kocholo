        "text": "My discussion of selected work on the history of technology is informed by three themes. First, the end of World War II marks a period in which, as historian Barton Hacker observes, “military authorities have come eagerly to accept or even promote … the introduction of new weapons.” Military authorities’ adoption of the idea that “doctrine might drive and control technological change” makes the post-World War II period very different from the past two hundred years of military history. Indeed, the idea that military technological change might be controlled and directed had ample precedent in the development of new industries in the late nineteenth century organized around telecommunications, photographic, electrical, and chemical technologies that exploited then-recent scientific discoveries. Industrial leaders recognized their dependence on science, and established research components—industrial research laboratories—to routinize scientific research to develop improved processes and products. Post-World War II military leaders applied an existing and proven approach to improving products and processes. The second theme concerns the post-World War II role of knowledge and analysis in making decisions and policy about public expenditures on inventive activity and technology development. In my view, the appropriate perspective on the role of knowledge and analysis in inventive activity concerns the co-evolution of institutions and military, social, political, and economic organizations; not whether a law-like generalization can be offered regarding the role of knowledge and analysis in individuals’ efforts to invent or apply technology. This theme echoes the views of prominent military historians. For example, Barton Hacker notes that “the concept of military technology has grown beyond hardware to embrace ideas and institutions; organization, management, and doctrine have become as much a part of the field as weapon development.” Alex Roland adds that the military is a social institution and it “plays an enormously important … complex role in the development of science and technology.” My third theme concerns Frederick Pohl’s observation: “A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.” In other words, insight comes from describing and tracing interactions and contextual relationships—not just the technology itself. Pohl, an acclaimed science fiction writer, implies a better story involves examining interactions among inventions, modes of behavior, cultural history, political and social institutions, military organizations, and legacy stock of equipment, infrastructure, and hardware and social technologies. In my view, developing a capability—concepts, methodologies, organizations, and working relationships—to examine, assess, and predict “traffic jams” of naval (and, more broadly, military) operations requires overcoming challenges to the many ways the historical and analytical communities interact and work. This difficult task is worth pursuing to make discourse about national security questions more rigorous, and to increase the value to senior leaders of the products produced within the historical-analytical community.\n\nThe scope of this abstract is to pursue and increase the quality levels of the military instrument to enhance the effectiveness, operational capabilities and overall employability by providing a timely information representation and a catchy and tailored visualization and communication support. The impact of information and communication on civilian/military maritime operations should be addressed in a social and political perspective. The success of communication, both indoor and outdoor, is essential for achieving goals. A fully informed and favorable outdoor and indoor environment supports and facilitates the achievement of military objectives. Communication must be multimedia, multiplatform and multilevel. Communication to be strength, must represent information in a simply and clear way through short text elements integrated with interactive visual representations: they capture at best the audience attention, without compromising the efficacy of the information content to be transmitted. Online availability through user-friendly and intuitive interface, enabling a positive user experience, is strongly recommended. Language should be natural for not military audience, and glossary should be available. Information should be manually categorized for not military audience. Communication results should be measured through a validation and verification process."
