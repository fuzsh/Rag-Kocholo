        "text": "When you run into a problem with Photoshop CC, like the program wonât do what you want it to, or Photoshop simply wonât do anything, try these quick fixes to troubleshoot:\n\nWhen Photoshop tools donât work\n\nDeselect. Unless youâre trying to work within an active selection, press Command+D (Mac) or Ctrl+D (Windows) to deselect. An active selection elsewhere may be restricting your work.\n\nReset the tool. Right-click on the tool icon at the left end of the Options bar and select choose Reset Tool from the drop-down menu.\n\nCheck the Layers and Channels panels. Make sure you have the correct layer active and that the layer (not a layer mask) is active. Check the Channels panel to make sure you have the color channels active.\n\nWhen Photoshop commands arenât available\n\nYou move the cursor to the menu and click, only to discover that the command you want is grayed out! Your next stop should be the ImageâMode menu. Check to make sure that the imageâs color mode and color depth are appropriate for the command you want to use. (Many of Photoshopâs filters, for example, can be used only with 8-bit/RGB images.)\n\nFixing Photoshop\n\nWhen Photoshop just wonât work properly, try replacing the Preferences file by using this procedure:\n\nOpen Photoshop and save your custom goodies. Choose EditâPresetsâPreset Manager to save sets of styles, brushes, and other such bits and pieces you created. Use the Save Actions command in the Actions panel menu to save any sets of custom Actions.\n\nReview your Preferences. Open Photoshopâs Preferences and go through each pane, noting your preferred settings so that you can restore your work environment later.\n\nQuit Photoshop. You then restart the program like this:\n\nOn a Mac: Hold down Command+Shift+Option and restart Photoshop. When prompted, release the modifier keys and confirm, that yes, you do want to replace the Photoshop settings.\n\nOn a PC: Restart Photoshop and then immediately press and hold down Ctrl+Shift+Alt. When prompted, release the modifier keys and confirm, that yes, you do want to replace the Photoshop settings.\n\nMany of Photoshop CCâs creative filters use foreground color, background color, or both, and you should select these colors before you get into the Filter gallery. Use this list for important Photoshop filters and the colors they use:\n\nFilter Color(s) Filter Color(s) ArtisticâColored Pencil Background SketchâGraphic Pen Foreground + background ArtisticâNeon Glow Foreground + background SketchâHalftone Pattern Foreground + background Brush StrokesâAccented Edges Foreground + background SketchâNote Paper Foreground + background DistortâDiffuse Glow Background SketchâPhotocopy Foreground + background SketchâPlaster Foreground + background SketchâReticulation Foreground + background SketchâBas Relief Foreground + background SketchâStamp Foreground + background SketchâChalk & Charcoal Foreground + background SketchâTorn Edges Foreground + background SketchâConte Crayon Foreground + background TextureâStained Glass Foreground\n\nTwo filters that are not in the Filter Gallery use Foreground and Background colors. They are: FilterâRenderâClouds; and FilterâRenderâFibers."
