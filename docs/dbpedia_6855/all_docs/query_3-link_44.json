        "text": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of NBA 75, er 76 Voting\n\nBy Peter Vecsey\n\nWhere’s Ford Frick’s vote-voiding common sense when we need it?\n\nSaratoga Springs--One of the best things about writing on an irregular basis, free from pressure to produce on any semblance of a deadline (also one of the worst things), is being able to camp at Lake Placid for however long it takes after something rubs me raw. This is done to avoid tackling issues unprofessionally, insensitively…or by the facemask.\n\nReady or not…\n\nAlmost a month has elapsed since the NBA completed its announcement of the league’s all-time Top 75 players, which became 76 due to a deadlock (pending essay competition) elected by an illogical 88-person panel.\n\nIn retrospect, it was the soundest portion of the process.\n\nPerhaps I’m ill informed, but I thought the original number of voters was 75. Fifty voted for the Top 50, so I figured 75 would vote for 75. At the abysmal least, the extra 13 makes no symmetrical sense. I’m left to deduce a whirlwind of campaigning for the commissioner’s approval must’ve ensued behind the screens by people craving to get credit for something so theoretically sacrosanct.\n\nSeeing my name, even today, amid the select 50 voters on page 8 of “The NBA At Fifty” book remains a cherished career acknowledgment. Hence, I altogether understand any fervid desire to be recognized for judging the Top 75, er, 76.\n\nIt doesn’t make me any less aroused, though.\n\nI probably should’ve camped out longer on (in?) the lake.\n\nYou screw with the sanctity of the voting, you screw with the sanctity of the vote.\n\nLet’s turn the page to 1996. U wit me, G?\n\nWhen the chosen 50 voted for the NBA’s half-century Supreme Court, the marquee players from the assembly were ultimately bestowed with lithographs signed by the 49 living legends (Pete Maravich died Jan. 5, 1988), extravagant commemorative rings and splashy, custom-made leather jackets.\n\nIt’s safe to say a bunch of rich people now own a large number of those lithos, or maybe only an obsessed couple of memorabilia magnates do.\n\nGeorge Gervin, I’m informed, was one of the first to cash in on his lithograph, pocketing 120G. Its sale painfully hammered home one of a plethora of financial lifetime mistakes I made by not lunging at Sam Battistone’s offer to buy one (of the 100 made) in ’97 for $15,000.\n\nThe signed lithographs were the brainstorm of the former Jazz owner. Thus, he could do whatever he wanted with some of them (don’t know how many); the league controlled the majority of the remaining 50, and every now and then, one or two would show up for sale at the NBA Store.\n\nDespite an additional dozen deaths among the elite Top 50 since that luminous list was formed, the price has dropped (seems like the opposite would be true, but that’s what I’m told by someone who deals in such souvenirs) to the 30-40G range. Makes me feel only twice as stupid.\n\nMany royal jewels also have changed hands, so to speak. One Top 50 player, I hear, sold his, as well as his Hall of Fame and championship (no ‘fingering’ Charles Barkley for this) rings. He then notified the NBA, HOF and the title team his stuff had been stolen. Replicas were made and the legendary lowlife then tried to sell them as originals to one of the above-mentioned moguls. The buyer was aware! He stuffed the cash back in his briefcase.\n\nAuction houses already are standing by for beseeching calls subsequent to All-Star Weekend (‪‪Feb. 18-20) in Cleveland, where the 2021 Supreme Court will be honored and showered with correspondingly gaudy gifts.\n\nNot coincidentally, the ‘96 Top 50 (had it been 51, Dominique Wilkins would not have fumed 25 years for being defectively denied royal recognition) event also was staged in Cleveland.\n\nTime out for a story:\n\nNBC assigned me to interview unhinged ex-Cadavers’ owner Ted Stepien whose board room behavior forced the NBA to adopt a salary cap and a rule forbidding teams to trade No. 1 picks in consecutive years, I spent several hours at his home. When David Stern got word of Sunday’s halftime feature from network sports boss Dick Ebersol, it was summarily squashed.\n\nI have it in case Donald Sterling or Robert Sarver would like to hear if anything he said sounds relatable.\n\nWhile not on the subject, it’s worth noting that Bob Lanier was the lone Top 50 voter of consequence not to achieve prominence. He voted for the Top 75 as well and again was bypassed.\n\nA convincing case could be made that Lanier should’ve made both lists—the latest at the very least—but that would’ve taken thoughtfulness (i.e. responsibility) rather than plagiarizing a 25-year-old cheat sheet.\n\nThis is where I stop rationing pablum.\n\nThe conspicuous hindrance for Lanier and many others (see below) was that two-thirds of the outcome was essentially fixed by the Silver’s NBA bequeathing the 37 living members of the Top 50 a vote. Six turned it down--Bob Cousy, Larry Bird, Tiny Archibald, Karl Malone, Kevin McHale and Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nUnconsciously, if not unconscientiously, the NBA’s padding of the ballot box principally dictated the advancement of the Top 50. They were prohibited from naming themselves, but there’s minimal doubt they only had eyes, and ayes, for each other!\n\nA jesting Cousy told me he decided at the last minute to demur when alerted he couldn’t vote for himself.\n\nOf course, they supported each other! Their fierce loyalty was to majestic past performances and blood-spattered competition among themselves, not the 30 squads of snipers feasting on projectiles from above the beyond in today’s predominately no-touchy-no-feely league.\n\nThat explains the 31 voters’ rationale. Silver’s savants should’ve cut the number in half, but obviously wanted fortification the first 50 years of history was sufficiently represented.\n\nI begrudgingly accept that clumsy guesswork. What I find downright unacceptable was the conclusion by numerous media voters and innumerable lazy bones to rubber stamp the harebrained determination.\n\nOne columnist I respect inordinately told me he voted for the full 50 because of not wanting to disrespect the decision-makers, as if they wouldn’t have appreciated how players upgraded regarding agility, strength, outpost accuracy and any other skill and physical element you care to mention.\n\nIf the same 50 voters had a say in the latest poll, guaranteed their votes would’ve radically changed, it says here.\n\nAnother columnist wrote he deferred in numerous instances to wise men who knew old-testament players with whom he was unfamiliar. Why stop there? Why not just transfer the bouncing ballot to the sagest soul he could find?\n\nYet another columnist extensively researched the project (I’ll give Steve Aschburner, via ‪NBA.com, that). He discovered that six of the 10 on the 25thAnniversary Team—anointed by six owners, three general managers (including Red Auerbach) and league publicity director Haskell Cohen—were not among the 11 chosen for the 35th.\n\nIn 1980, the Professional Basketball Writers Association picked the team. Bill Russell, Cousy, Bob Pettit and George Mikan were the lone leftovers, while Dolph Schayes, Paul Arizin, Joe Fulks, Sam Jones, Bill Sharman and Bob Davies were scratched.\n\nThe four joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Julius Erving, John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West on the 35th, who were selected regardless of position or completion of careers (unlike the 25th, explaining the absence of Wilt, Elgin, Oscar and The Logo).\n\nSo, Aschburner knew there was a Supreme Court-changing precedent. He also understood that keeping the Top 50 intact would cost many meriting modern-era players their rightful place in history. I know this because we discussed the ramification beforehand.\n\nAschburner E-ZPassed the Top 50 anyway.\n\nWhy? His hackneyed logic was employed by more of my bunko-balloting brethren than should have been allowed by law, and segment void of qualifications (see below) to vote in the first place.\n\n“For the prestige and honor to endure, that one and this one had to last,” Aschburner wrote. “That’s when I decided I had to keep the first 50 intact and add 25.”\n\nA 40-year savvy NBA courtside veteran, Aschburner always has had it goin’ on. In this case, he was dead wrong! This was not an ‘add 25’ term paper…it only became one to those who dis-serviced it.\n\nClearly, the league failed to make it unassailably clear that 1996’s version of the high court was not a lifetime gig.\n\nAschburner allowed also he endorsed the entire 50 because he didn’t want to insult the families of anyone forsaken.\n\nHuh?!\n\nWhat about the families of the players who were stiffed back then, I scornfully retort? What about the hurt feelings of Walt Bellamy’s family, as a prime odious omission?\n\nShortly after Bells died Nov. 2, 2013, I spoke to his wife, Helen, for a Finals program tribute I wrote on NBA family members—players, coaches and owners--who died that year.\n\n“Walt never said a word about not becoming a Top 50 honoree, but it hurt me,” she said when I wondered how he felt about being ignored. “I’m not an envious person and I’m not selfish, but Walt was better than some that made it. I had to turn it loose.”\n\nNever to be corrected!\n\nIn the mindlessness of the majority, the Top 50 preamble was so pristine—no deletions and a scant two additions, Bob McAdoo and Dominique--that our task became choosing a Top 23 from the past 25 seasons.\n\nI could’ve saved a lot of time and effort had I realized the list was written on tablets.\n\nArizin, who died Dec. 12, 2006, wasn’t aware of that, either. Nor was the Hall of Fame forward—a made man on three NBA anniversary lists—so full of himself he felt remotely irreplaceable. Too bad the 88 recent voters didn’t get to hear his voice of reason before senselessly and sightlessly prancing to the polls.\n\n“In his opinion, at that time (1996-97), there were 15 players whose omission from the list would have impugned the integrity of the entire list, 15 players were non-debatable, locks, his son, Michael, has repeatedly told me.\n\n“He felt that any one of the remaining 35 in the Top 50, while all great players, could have been replaced by a great player who was not included in the Top 50 without in any way affecting the integrity of the entire list.”\n\nAnd yet Aschburner preached the list was so sanctified it could never be revised.\n\nThink about how many stars are stranded on the shoulder of NBA history for the next 25 years until the Century Commission is in session.\n\nNikola Jokic will be 51 by then, Luka Doncic 47, Klay Thompson 56, Tony Parker 64, Manu Ginobili 69, Grant Hill 74, Joe Dumars 83…to give you a stiff whiff of some affronted players I supported, as well as Dennis Johnson and Bellamy.\n\nAdvocates of Medusa Howard claim he got screwed. Had they caught sight of Bellamy having his greatest games against Chamberlain and Russell, often outscoring and outrebounding them early in his career, they’d summarily switch allegiance.\n\nOther than Bill Walton again getting swept in on a misguided current (Mike Pence declined to certify Medical Bill), the most unjustifiable admissions to this versions of the Supremes, I accentuate with steadfast conviction, were Carmelo Anthony and Reggie Miller.\n\n“You mean to tell me, the ninth-leading scorer in NBA history doesn’t rate inclusion on the list?” Mark Jackson squawked.\n\nIn 20 seasons, Anthony’s teams parsed past the first round twice in 13 playoff appearances, I counted. I’m not saying he had to win a title, but if you want to make my list, you’ve got to carry your teams deep into the playoffs often, if not always, and escort at least one to star-stained heights (The Finals) on bent and battered wings, whatever it takes.\n\nGranted, Miller refutes the above stipulation. Nevertheless, there’s an exception to every rule. His 8.9 second, 8-point burst that beat the Knicks, shenanigans with Spike Lee and TNT exposure got him into the Hall of Fame and the Top 76.\n\nMiller scored a lot of points.\n\nGave up a lot of points.\n\nAn overabundance of reinforcement for Anthony and Miller meant D.J. or Klay, or Dumars, or Ginobili, or Parker got written off.\n\nIt’s gruesome to grasp voters deemed Anthony and Miller more important in the scheme of success than players with multiple titles who doubled as diametrically deft defenders.\n\nI never pretended my choices were perfect (Top 50, now and life in general), but there’s no denying how many clueless voted for Walton, Anthony and Miller rather than Manu, Parker, D.J., Dumars and Klay--thrice a league champion and a military-grade marksman.\n\nGuess Manu didn't give up his body enough coming off the bench his whole career. Guess his innumerable game-winning shots were meaningless. How stupid were the voters not to see what he meant to the Spurs’ supremacy!\n\nParker was intimately instrumental to the four championships as well. Gregg Popovich turned the keys over to him (one Finals MVP) and Tim Duncan was all for it.\n\nDumars was in three straight Finals, won ‘em twice, one Finals MVP and accrued consequential conquests of the (Jordan) Bulls and Celtics.\n\nD.J. was Finals MVP when the Sonics beat the Bullets in ’79, six times First Team All-Defense, three times Second Team. The Hall of Fame stiffed him well over a decade before getting it right with a posthumous proclamation.\n\nAn obtuse Top 75, er, 76, panel has insulted his memory and irrevocably hurt his family’s feelings.\n\nCited by Larry Bird as the best clutch shooter he ever played with, he and Johnson were fairly-significant parts of two Boston banners that were raised to the Rastafarians.\n\nWalton crashed the Top 50 & 75 as a result of winning the MVP in the Trail Blazers’ lone franchise championship in 1977. A second title was won as a Celtic in 1986 when he won the Sixth Man award. Walton subsequently won the 1978 regular-season MVP while appearing in just 58 games; the Blazers were 50-10 when he got injured.\n\nNobody on either Supreme Court played fewer minutes than Grateful Red. He’s not even close to the accomplishments of Klay, Dumars, D.J., Manu, Parker and countless others, whose glittering pro careers persisted far longer, and ring collection is larger.\n\nThe Diamond Jubilee vote was not supposed to be about college achievements. It was about honoring the players who did it right and established everlasting, longed-for legacies.\n\nTime to admit, I suspect, that I lied sundry paragraphs earlier. The league’s manifest lack of a distinct direction was inexcusable, but far tougher to take was its suspect segment of appointed electorates. We’re almost about to get to 15 women and Ahmad Rashad who were gifted votes.\n\nAt first, I blamed the NBA for Phil Jackson’s arresting absence from the poll, along with a horde of eminently qualified coaches, players, GMs and reporters. As it turns out, he was indeed asked to participate, as I learned from the Zen Hen’s text.\n\n“There was too big a list (75), too many decades (8). If one had a pre-3-point line, or 1980 as Era of Modern b-ball, I would have voted. Bobby Davies, for example was a favorite of Red (Holzman). It was a tough task and really not important to me.”\n\nLess than an hour later, Jackson sent an unsolicited addendum.\n\n“Started thinking about those guys left off that could play—Davies, his backcourt partner (at Seton Hall and Rochester‘s Royals) Bobby Wanzer, Cliff Hagan, Jim Pollard, Jack Sikma, Gus Williams, Bernard King, etc., etc., a challenging list to make choices.”\n\nJackson liked my response.\n\n“It wasn’t easy for those of us who tried to provide some historical perspective, as opposed to simply promoting the entire Top 50 to the Top 75.”\n\nEr, 76.\n\nI was not alone, but lonely. Mike Breen busted his brain doing homework on the Top 50 players, investigating the serious slights that had occurred, and measuring those from the 1990s until today who appeared to earn entry.\n\nThe Boston Globe’s Gary Washburn also understood Mission Unfeasible.\n\n“While the contributions from all-time great players should be acknowledged, there is no way all previous Top 50 players should have been chosen for the Top 75.”\n\nWhen the fridge full of frozen envelopes was counted, an extensive inventory of modern- and early-era players got seriously shafted.\n\nSue me for reiterating!\n\nI find Adam Silver and his wokeforce incomprehensibly guilty. They loaded the dice with a predisposed body of Top 50 (31) players, pandered politically to former league executives and genuflected to gender.\n\nThink about it; nearly 18% of the voters for the best male players in NBA history were females. Only one—creditable veteran, Jackie MacMullan—is an actual reporter, practiced at delving into an undertaking this complicated.\n\nI take it back; Japan’s Yoko Mayaji covered the NBA, I’m told, for 34 years.\n\nMainly from Japan!\n\nI can name a silo full of non-voting male journalists who, in fact, attended practices, exhibitions, regular-season games, press conferences and playoffs on an unswerving basis more often and longer than Mayaji.\n\nMark Heisler is one. He’s in the Naismith Hall of Fame, but never got a call from the NBA. Same goes for Harvey Araton. Fran Blinebury voted for the Top 50 but got the brush-off this time after 40-plus seasons of duty. Mike Monroe covered the ABA and the NBA until recently. Steve Bulpett’s coverage of the Celtics dates to Larry O’Brien’s term as commissioner. Dan Shaughnessy, Leigh Montville, Ira Berkow, Jonathan Feigen and Ric Bucher must’ve been penalized for being overly experienced.\n\nGet back to me if you need additional samples.\n\nWas this three-quarter century Prix Fixe Menu really the apt occasion to show the world how ‘progressive’ the NBA is at the expense of infinitely more certified lifers on every level?\n\nClearly, fashioning a woke women’s vote was the intention of Silver and his group grope, the league having barnacled onto that bandwagon years ago.\n\nParty favors such as these furthermore endeared it to social and political promoters, demonstrating its awareness to the plight of females.\n\nSomething to that effect. Please don’t quote me.\n\nUnrelated, I’ve learned the league plans to do away with the term “offensive foul” at the risk of offending anyone.\n\nYou got that right; the NBA does not care…if active and retired NBA players and coaches feel insulted that active and retired WNBA women got votes.\n\nDoes not care whatsoever that exceedingly less knowledgeable voters jumped the line in front of those exceptionally more acquainted and qualified to evaluate NBA eras.\n\nDoes not give a Flying Wallenda that 14 of 15 women ‘earned’ votes for no other reason than they’re women!\n\nI wonder how many active and retired NBA players got votes during this past season when the WNBA picked its Top 25?\n\nWas the list even revealed? If not, why not? If so, that should answer my question.\n\nI’m also curious how the WNBA/women TV analysts managed to compare epochs of ever-changing skills and rules when Phil Jackson reckoned it impossible.\n\nOf course, they couldn’t. I’m willing to wager all the money you’ve recently lost betting spreads and over/unders, the NBA’s latest encouraged, commercialized craze.\n\nFor the first 70-something years of its existence, the NBA banned any connection to the corruption and temptation that gambling on games poses to those involved, particularly referees, you might recall.\n\nThen, suddenly, when profits decisively dropped due to China—which copped an attitude regarding a single tweet supporting Hong Kong dissidents and pulled the NBA’s TV deal—combined with the onslaught of the coronavirus, and millions of Americans distancing themselves from the league’s in-fans’-faces political slant, the 30 owners adopted an addiction as decadent and devastating as illegal drugs and alcohol.\n\nEvidently, the NBA does not care that its perverted policy will sooner than later sentence hundreds of thousands of kids, whose phones are their bookies, to lives attending Gamblers Anonymous.\n\nWe now return to my irregularly scheduled primary grievance.\n\nDown the backstretch, I could cut myself a sliver of slack by pretending I have no quarrel with Hannah Storm, Ann Meyers and Nancy Lieberman getting votes. Yes, they’ve paid decades of dues along NBA sidelines and in the TV trench mouth.\n\nHowever, if Storm deserved a vote, Pat Williams, Paul Silas, Dick Motta, Richie Guerin and Phil Chenier are far more deserving.\n\nIf Lieberman deserved a vote, Del Harris, Norm Sonju, Rick Sund, Garry St. Jean and Richie Adubato are far more deserving.\n\nIf Meyers deserved a vote, Eddie Doucette, Stu Lantz, Ralph Lawler, Al McCoy, Bill Worrell and George Blaha are far more deserving.\n\nIf Doris Burke deserved a vote, Mark Jackson, if not Jeff Van Gundy, and Dick Stockton are far more deserving.\n\nIf Rachel Nichols deserved a vote, Hubie Brown, Kenny Smith and Scott Hastings are far more deserving.\n\nIf Becky Hammon deserved a vote, Larry Brown, Dick Barnett, Henry Bibby, Jim Cleamons, Dave Twardzik, Gar Heard.Tim Grgurich, Pete Carrilare far more deserving.\n\nIf Candace Parker deserved a vote, Don Nelson, Danny Ainge, Jack Sikma, Cliff Hagan and Clifford Ray are far more deserving.\n\nIf Carol Blazejowski deserved a vote, Donnie Walsh, Steve Patterson, John Gabriel and Mitch Kupchak are far more deserving.\n\nIf Cynthia Cooper deserved a vote, Charlie Scott, Jeff Mullins, John Lucas, Calvin Murphy and Downtown Freddie Brown are far more deserving.\n\nIf Kara Lawson deserved a vote, Doug Moe, George Karl, Butch Beard, Mike Dunleavy, Bernie Bickerstaff, Kevin Loughery and Fred Carter are far more deserving.\n\nIf Sheryl Swoopes deserved a vote, Gail Goodrich, Eddie Johnson, Jim Barnett, Geoff Petrie, Rick Carlisle and Jerry Sichting are far more deserving.\n\nIf Sue Bird deserved a vote, Cheryl Miller is more deserving.\n\nIn wrapping up this manifesto, I find it hard to believe O. J.’s best man got a vote, much less was able to fill it out for 75 players without the help of a teleprompter.\n\nApparently, there was a software glitch after Rashad wrote “My main man” 75 times…\n\n…or Michael Jordan 175 times.\n\nHow does Silver explain Jim Gray not cracking the NBA’s balloting? Check bounce?\n\nIn closing, allow me to restate what an honor it was to be part of the Top 50.\n\nAllow me, also, to deny being part of the Top 75.\n\nI’m guessing this probably abolishes my chance of an invitation to vote for the Top 100. Then again, maybe the woman commissioner will gift some undeserving males votes.\n\n*****\n\nI did something here I’ve never done before. I gave Michael Arizin a preview of my vitriol a couple days before Monday’s presentation. His slightly edited reaction follows. I respond respectively. Almost.\n\nArizin: Your rant on automatic Top 50 carryovers was a little confusing to me. You were frustrated that 31 of the surviving Top 50 members were allowed to vote because…\n\n…In your opinion, the “31” voted as a block in favor of their peers. I don’t have that data. But who better to judge the older players?\n\nPerhaps, I was reading more into it than I should, but for me, it woulda been helpful if you gave your opinion of how many of the Top 50 (not names) should have been carried forward….so that the “no interest in history” contingent of today don’t assume that 40 were “gratis picks,” I suspect you would have retained at least 80% of the original 50?\n\nOn a different note, I shed no tears for Jokic, Doncic, Thompson, Parker, Ginobili or Hill…only for Dumars having to wait for the Top 100. Dad & Cousy were 70 and Schayes 72 at the time of the Top 50.\n\nVecsey: My point is, by giving a block of votes to 31 people when only 75 slots were available, significantly slanted the vote. There are plenty of older coaches, players, scouts and radio/TV broadcasters, as I catalog, scrupulously capable & coherent to judge eras, though Jackson feels differently. Voters from eight eras should've been as proportionate possible.\n\nAs noted in a previous column, I voted for Shaquille O’Neal four years into his career in 1996. Saw enough. Didn't have to see anymore. He belonged on Top 50. Had Shaq suffered a career-ending or debilitating injuries, as Walton did, shortly thereafter, my decision would've proved to be regretful. At the same time, Walton's chronically-injured career was long over when elected to the Top 50. Preposterous he made it, while Maurice Stokes, Connie Hawkins, Brandon Roy, Ralph Sampson and Bernard King weren't vaguely considered for The Supremes.\n\nI feel the same way about Joker and Luka. I've seen enough. They belong. Their multi-talents are on par with 90% of the players on the Top 75.\n\nThe players you named who were 70 or older when the Top 50 were crafted, either made the Top 25 and/or Top 35. Klay, D.J., Dumars, Ginobili and Tony Parker got royally stiffed. Grant Hill, not so much.\n\nFYI: After much deliberation and trepidation, I subtracted nine players from the Top 50.\n\nIf I were pleased with my submission, I would reveal my select 75. However, I felt I’d committed multifarious mistakes minutes after completion.\n\nOn the other hand, I don’t mind disclosing a no vote for James Harden. Couldn’t stomach watching him play in Houston, and know Rockets’ teammates couldn’t stand watching him play either, while on the court together.\n\nBasketball's Last Set Shooter, and Coach of Milwaukee's 1971 Title Team - Larry Costello Deserves A Place In The Hall\n\nBy Peter Vecsey\n\nYou know those signs at the polling places that read ‘No Electioneering Beyond This Point’?\n\nWe’re not beyond this point, so I’m electioneering.\n\nThat the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame finds itself odious with omissions and commissions is hardly news. To be fair (for the first and last time in this epistle), any such sports shrine is not immune.\n\nThis exclusion is beyond egregious, however.\n\nThat’s where I come in.\n\nAs a member in shameless Springfield standing, it’s my civic duty to create a crescendo in the clarion call for Costello…\n\n…as in Larry Ronald Costello.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks’ hoisting of Larry O’Brien’s trophy for the first time in a half-century provides the textbook stumping grounds.\n\n(Hold the ‘caught-ya’ texts; I know the hardware wasn’t named for Larry in 1971 since he didn’t get top billing of the NBA until the summer of ‘75)\n\nBack to the other Larry, who is best remembered as the coach of those marauding 1970-71 Bucks.\n\nContrary to what many must erroneously think, Costello was not a one-trick pony. Not to say the Hall isn’t swarming with those. But that’ll have to wait for another column. I did not come to bury others today in this space, rather to praise Lawrence Roland Costello.\n\nI’m committed not to do a number on why so-and-so is in the hallowed Hall while the Costello clan has been awaiting a call for decades.\n\nThere’s no ‘tale of the tape’ comparison needed to reopen and bolster Costello’s cold case.\n\nEnlisting the help of John W. Tailby’s self-published (2010) biography/position paper (specifically with regard to testimonials), here are some of the humble highlights.\n\nLong before finding his way to the NBA, the 6-foot-1 Costello—a native of Minoa, New York —was a star at Niagara.\n\nAt the place best known for the falls, the spray starch and Calvin Murphy, Costello left as the school’s all-time leading scorer.\n\nPlaying in the Western New York Little 3 Conference (Niagara, Canisius, pre-Bob Lanier St. Bonaventure), Costello’s Purple Eagles went 46-12 his junior (18.2 ppg) and senior (15.3) seasons.\n\nAssists were not a compiled stat back then, but suffice to say he shared the wealth with Ed Fleming, Charlie Hoxie, Hubie Brown and Frank Layden.\n\nNiagara went to a pair of National Invitation Tournaments, back when the N-I-T was N-O-T second banana to the N-C-A-A, after which he toured the country with a college All Star team in a dozen game series (7-5) against the talent-loaded Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nCostello arrived in the NBA in 1954, a spare-parts rookie (second round/12th overall selection) with the Philadelphia Warriors and among the last of the set-shot masters. After spending a year with the 4077th in Korea he returned, becoming both a workhorse and a star.\n\nAfter another season in Philly, Costello was sold for the princely sum of five grand to the hometown Syracuse Nationals, which allowed him to move back into his childhood bedroom.\n\nThat very same amount, 5G, had bought Dan Biasone--the creator of the 24-second clock—the franchise in 1946.\n\nProving you can go home again, Costello began a string of eight consecutive seasons of double-figure scoring while perennially among the league leaders in assists and free-throw percentage. He twice led the league in the latter category.\n\n…and his defense?\n\n“People ask me who gave me the most trouble. It wasn’t Oscar Robertson or Jerry West. Larry had that animal determination.” - Bob Cousy.\n\nCostello returned to Philly when the Nats were sold and relocated there for the 1963-64 season. However, a tendon injury forced him to retire the next season.\n\nWhat to do? Coach a from-scratch high-school team at his alma mater (reconfigured East Syracuse-Minoa) to an Onondaga (NY) county championship, just failing in sectionals for the state title.\n\nPrior to the ’66-‘67 season, Costello’s former Syracuse coach, Alex Hannum, now running the 76ers, implored him to come to Philly.\n\nAt 35, Costello ran a pristine point for the juggernaut title team, spearheaded by Wilt Chamberlain. Dippy had more help that season—Hal Greer, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson, Billy Cunningham, Wali Jones, Matt Guokas and Billy Melchionni—than any other until he hooked up with Lakers’ Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Gail Goodrich and Happy Hairston\n\nThe 76ers were 38-4 when Costello again ruptured an Achilles tendon. They finished 68-13, beating Cincinnati, Boston and San Francisco for the championship.\n\nHow tough was Costello? He returned to play, albeit sparingly, seven games before the regular season ended and saw some daylight in the playoffs.\n\nWhile Costello did return for 28 games (17.6 minutes) with sporadic contributions in ‘67-’68, his days in short pants were over.\n\nIt was off to Milwaukee and the birth of the Bucks, where Costello was hired as player-coach, but never donned a uniform. Suggesting that the team’s increased win totals (27 to 56 to 66) were strictly due to a fortuitous flip of the coin (for Lew Alcindor) and the acquisition of one of the game’s greatest guards (Oscar Robertson) would for shit-sure shortchange the influence of the coach.\n\nBy all accounts and descriptions, Costello was a scrupulous tactician, as well as an innovative practice and preparation freak. It took the Bucks another nine presidents to (theoretically) get invited to the White House.\n\nCostello’s .589 regular season winning percentage (430-300) was tied for 14th-best all-time with Erik Spoelstra and Mike Budenholzer (before Tuesday’s beatdown of Brooklyn) for coaches with at least five seasons worth of workload.\n\nHis .617 post-season percentage (37-23; Milwaukee lost the ’74 Finals to Boston in seven) is 10th all-time.\n\nAfter his NBA career ended, the Costello caravan briefly saw him coach The Chicago Bulls the Milwaukee Does of the Women’s Professional Basketball League (first US women’s pro league) for one season as well as Utica College.\n\nThe Utica job was part challenge, part favor, requested by his former high-school coach (Dr. Tom Sheldon) to shepherd to program from Division III to Division I.\n\nCostello was at Utica for seven seasons—six as a D1 independent—and save for a 4-22 first season at the adult table, his teams always won in double figures. His departure after the ‘86-‘87 season coincided with the school’s stepping back to Division III.\n\nSo, in a Hall that embraces all basketball contribution, here was a man who coached men in the pros, women in the pros, high schoolers and collegians.\n\nCostello died in December of 2001 at the age of 70.\n\nIt shouldn’t have come to ‘better late than never,’ but it has.\n\nThe gatekeepers owe it to Larry Costello and his family to make sure I don’t have to write this again.\n\nThe reviews are/were in…\n\n“He’s a man totally dedicated to basketball. He simply wants to get the job done.” - Lew Alcindor (1971)\n\n“I’m not quite sure what sort of player or man you are looking for to grace the Hall, but he will always make my team.” - Wilt Chamberlain\n\n“Larry was a tenacious opponent, both offensively and defensively. He gave ground to no man defensively.” - Tom Gola\n\n“Having played with and against him, I can assure you he was an outstanding player. He also provided the important intangible of being the complete team player.” - Paul Arizin\n\n“Being associated with Larry taught me the meaning of hard work and team effort. I knew he could score more than most of his teammates, but Larry played to win.” - Billy Cunningham\n\n“Larry was a marvelous backcourt player both at Niagara and later as a professional with Philadelphia and Syracuse. I think it was a great tribute that he was coaxed out of retirement in 1966 at the age of 35 and became floor general of the team many consider the greatest of all-time, the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers. Later on, I fully began to appreciate Larry’s talents as a coach. He always had his teams well-prepared and ready for anything.” - Red Holzman\n\n“ …add my name to the growing list of supporters for the induction of Larry Costello to the Basketball Hall of Fame. I have coached against many members already elected and I say Larry had one of the great minds of the game. I consider what he did to enhance (Lew Alcindor’s) game one of the great tactical moves of several generations of coaches. He found more ways to get him the ball than I wanted to coach against.” - Tom Heinsohn\n\n“It was a thrill to play the guard position with him as we were teammates with the Syracuse Nationals and Philadelphia 76ers. Larry was the quickest and fastest player I have seen.” - Hal Greer\n\n“…and Larry’s playing and coaching careers were exemplary. He excelled as few have as a leader, teacher and proponent of the game.” - Julius Erving\n\n“Definitely a player of (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s) ability has a lot to do with winning, but I think Larry Costello was more responsible with winning in those days than Kareem. You win because of a good system. It was Larry Costello’s system that had the Bucks winning.” - Lucious Allen\n\n“I think the induction of Larry Costello into the Hall of Fame is long overdue. He has been a credit to basketball in every sense of the word.”- Rick Barry\n\n“If ever a player epitomized the ideal basketball player as far as morality, work ethic and coachability, it was Larry Costello.” - Alex Hannum\n\n“I (had) known Larry since we were seniors in college and feel he would be an excellent addition to the Hall of Fame. He not only had an outstanding career as a player for 12 years, but won the NBA title in 1971.” - Bob Pettit\n\n…and last, but certainly not least…\n\n“The purpose of this letter is to recommend Larry Costello for the National Basketball Hall of Fame. I have known Larry for over 20 years and have only regard for his knowledge and abilities. He is a gentleman and would be a proud addition to the Hall of Fame.” - Jerry Colangelo (March 21, 1991)\n\nColangelo was the owner of the Phoenix Suns at the time. Since 2009, he has been Chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nI am unavailable for comment regarding the above two graphs.\n\nHere’s the Reader’s Digest recap of Costello’s credentials…\n\n—collegiate star (check).\n\n—six-time N-B-A All-Star (check).\n\n—NBA title-winning player (check).\n\n—NBA title-winning coach (check).\n\n—Naismith Hall of Famer (check back with me when the oversight committee finally takes care of that).\n\n****\n\nOn January 16, 1985, Utica College lost to Marquette, 55-53, in overtime. The game was played at the MECCA, where Costello coached the Bucks.\n\nUtica was in its fourth year of Division One while Marquette was eight years detached from winning the 1977 national title.\n\nIt was the lone time 6-8 Utica senior DJ Carstensen remembers “coach going around the locker room after a loss, shaking everyone’s hand, recognizing the effort that was given.”\n\nDJ is Costello’s most zealous HOF activist and staunchest advocate for Costello as a coach and superior human being. A referee for the last 16 NCAA tournament, DJ was a three-time team captain.\n\nLarry is on his lips whenever the whistle isn’t between them.\n\nIn the Milwaukee Journal the next day, Costello was asked about the talent gap between Utica College and more established Division I programs.\n\n“We’ll never accept it. We’ll never do that,” he declared. “You’ve always got a chance in this game. You don’t step on the court otherwise. You can’t play that way. I’m proud of my kids because they fought.”\n\nHe was the ultimate competitor,” DJ lauded, “and it didn’t matter where he was coaching at, or who he was coaching.”\n\nBlack Mamba, Big Fundamental, Big Ticket and Rudy T\n\nBy Peter Vecsey\n\nThe Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2020 enshrinement is set for Saturday evening, with honorees reminded to keep those acceptance speeches short as not to interfere with the start of the play-in playoffs.\n\nThe fact the long-delayed shindig is being held in a casino with Michael Jordan as a (Kobe) presenter is nothing if not coincidence.\n\n‘Ahmad [Rashād], take my luggage to the room while I find a blackjack table.’\n\nThink Jordan had anything to do with Isiah Thomas being snubbed as a serial presenter?\n\nAm I the only one to notice presenters for each inductee are about to outnumber team assistant coaches?\n\nBefore Jerry Colangelo steps aside for Junior Bridgeman, or John ‘Why’ Brown, perhaps he’ll consider using play-in presenters for the 2021 class, to be announced May 16th.\n\nIn the meantime, a reminder that no inductee becomes officially legit until he/she is exonerated by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.\n\nThe smart money is betting big on Bill Russell gaining entry as a coach despite the fact his record was 179-207 (6-9 in the playoffs) when he wasn’t coaching himself with the Celtics--three seasons, two titles.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning K.C. Jones managed to do okay for himself once he left Russell’s domain (522-252, .674 regular season; 81-57, .587 playoffs). Calmly and cunningly, he channeled the Bullets and Celtics to five Finals.\n\nFYI: Jones and Russell are the lone African-American coaches to have won multiple (two) championships. One is being accommodated by the HOF. The other continues to be obtrusively overlooked by its unidentified cluster of committee members.\n\nTherapy has alleviated my affinity for anonymity. Rick Adelman, Paul Pierce, Jay Wright, Marques Johnson and Michael Cooper were prominently printed on my uncounted absentee ballot. Since Satch Sanders’ initiation in 2011, I’ve rehabilitated my repentant judgment and converted to a passionate proponent of rewarding vital role players, and coaches who make a meaningful difference in developing players.\n\nIt says here, Springfield should’ve embraced Paul Silas five years after he retired from playing in 1980, certainly in combination with his later contribution/impact as an assistant/head coach wherever he went.\n\nAnd who won more playoff games with last-second stilettos than Robert Horry?\n\nI won’t even try to regurgitate my argument for Willie Wise, James Jones, Mack Calvin, Freddie Lewis, Ron Boone and Donnie Freeman, whose glory days were mostly served in the ABA. Colangelo snobbishly told me years ago, after Louie Dampier was voted to the HOF by his appointed seven-person ABA Committee, he doesn’t believe any others have HOF credentials.\n\nI ‘decorously’ dissented.\n\nColangelo took exception. “If it weren’t for me, none of the players who played almost exclusively in the ABA (Roger Brown, Mel Daniels) would’ve gotten Hall of Fame recognition.”\n\n“You mean, I’m supposed to thank you for doing what’s right?”\n\nClearly, none of the above will reap definitive respect until Chairman Colangelo relinquishes his pompous command post.\n\nAs for this weekend’s revered group, Kobe and Garnett are the reason the NBA required a high-school diploma to seek employment, and I was forced to take an equivalency exam.\n\nAlmost from the jump, Bryant, an all rookie choice and an All-Star his second season, was well worth the price of admission, even for those of us who weren’t obliged to pay.\n\nSo many subplots to sift through:\n\n—Fans’ hostility/ harmonic convergence with Kobe;\n\n—his love/hate/love connection with the Lakers;\n\n—-his adulation/aversion for Jerry West;\n\n—his affection/disconnection with Phil Jackson;\n\n—his feud and arranged TNT settlement with Shaquille O’Neal;\n\n—his breakup and makeup with his parents, Pam and Joe;\n\n—his sexual assault arrest;\n\n—his marriage separation and reconciliation with Vanessa;\n\n—that 60-point unearthly grand finale;\n\n—and those five titles in 20 seasons, augmented by a procession of trappings, marvels and myths.\n\nAllow me to dispel a couple. Don’t ask me why I choose them exactly, except it’s interesting how Kobe was the same person at 18 as he was at 28 and 38….and how details get distorted.\n\nAs a rookie Kobe had improved significantly from training camp when he showed up limping from an ankle sprained playing pickup in Venice Beach. It kept him from seeing any daylight in his first game and limited him to five minutes in Game 2. Hence his first pro point occurred against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. One and done.\n\nKobe remained an irregular throughout the season, but earned important minutes closer to the playoffs while chomping for additional responsibility. By the last month, he’d become a crucial component.\n\nIn the final stages of their-win-or-get-wasted Game 5 of the ‘1997-98 Western Conference Finals against the Jazz in Utah, Kobe, by default, received an on-court commission. Shaq fouled out at the 1:46 mark, LA up 87-84. Horry had been ejected for allegedly swinging a fist at somebody (horrible call). Byron Scott was injured in Game 2 and Nick Van Exel-who’d downed 7-7 from beyond the arc in Game 2-hurt his foot with about four minutes left, now having trouble overcoming John Stockton’s defense.\n\nTheir bench depleted, the Lakers still hung tough to deadlock matters, 89-89. After Stockton tied it, Karl Malone missed a jumper from 15 and Greg Ostertag committed a turnover. Eddie Jones appeared to have an open layup to put LA up two, but Greg Ostertag came off Elden Campbell and snuffed Jones for his ninth block.\n\nVan Exel’s strip of Ostertag gave the Lakers the last possession. A time out was called with 11.3 seconds remaining. Kobe came straight to Del Harris and avowed, “Coach, if you let me have this shot, I’ll drain it for you.”\n\nWhat coach wouldn’t want to hear that!\n\n“The thought that went through my mind was this,” Harris told me the following season. “I said, ‘the kid’s 18. This is a moment here. He is either gonna make it or miss it. If he makes it, it’s gonna do a lot for him. If he misses, he’ll at least know there was a white-haired guy who I thought didn’t know anything, believed in me.’\n\n“And I believed him. And I still believe him. And I’d give him that shot again. I just wanted to make sure we’d get the last shot of regulation. And I wanted a good shot. I knew Kobe could get one off and we’d have a chance to tip. Thing is, he waited too long and missed a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer from 14-15 feet .”\n\nThe Jazz prevailed in overtime.\n\nDecades later, memories fogged, people claim that shot by Kobe was an air ball and that he aired out four treys in overtime.\n\n“Fact is, we got behind and Kobe rushed two but also scored our only basket (a layup) in the final five minutes.” Harris remembered recently. “He only aired two but was 0-6 for the game from 3-point range.”\n\nLegend contends, according to countless reports over the years, Kobe and his father found a gym after the season-ending loss hoisting hundreds of long-distance springers.\n\nThat might’ve happened when the Lakers landed in Los Angeles (I never remembered to ask him), but there was no gym visit in Salt Lake City. There was a charter to catch. To this day, Harris doesn’t know if Joe attended Game 5 or met Kobe at the airport.\n\nOn to Garnett, who toiled for years doing superior work with suspect support, not unlike my ‘staph’.\n\nI’m pulling punches, as the Counterfeit Ticket well knows. However, his acting was so real in ‘Uncut Gems’, I’m gonna momentarily bypass his grievous faults.\n\nTraded by Minny HaHa to Boston after 12 seasons, Garnett had a bit more success than Joe Kapp, winning one title.\n\nThis just in: Billy King believes Garnett should go into the Hall as a Net.\n\nTim Duncan, as the standings bear out, made Gregg Popovich the smartest man in the room by being the smartest man in the room.\n\nProof that a college degree is actually worth something, he hung around Wake Forest in time for the Spurs to win the lottery, lose Bob Hill and give Rick Pitino a valid excuse to return to college coaching.\n\nHere’s Duncan’s career in a nutshell: No words, no tats, no errors.\n\nThe guy killed opponents and closed captioning at the same time.\n\nBetween the three of them—Kobe, Garnett and Duncan--that’s 48 All-Star Games, or about the same number I’ve avoided watching.\n\nWhich brings us to Rudy Tomjanovich — in under the radar as a coach, but a five-time All Star as a player (17.4 ppg, 8.1 rpg) as well.\n\nWon those two Chris Christie ‘bridge’ championships while Jordan was telling people to go fungo yourself.\n\nHad Tomjanovich actually coached Charles Barkley to a title, he would’ve been elected via Vatican white smoke.\n\nContrary to common credence, Tomjanovich’s most impressive coaching did not occur in 1994 when the Rockets beat the Knicks in seven games after trailing 2-3. Nor in 1995 when they short-sheeted Shaq and the Magic, 4-0. Did not happen in the 2000 Olympics, when the United States won the gold in Sydney, Australia, though, granted, Rudy did have to overcome the incessant meddling of assistant Larry Brown.\n\nIt says here, and I underline, Tomjanovich long ago deserved to make the Hall of Fame off his National team’s third-place accomplishment in the 1998 FIBA World Cup of Basketball in Greece.\n\nBecause the NBA was in lockdown, the USA was prohibited from using its players. Rudy volunteered to coach and was joined by Del Harris and Lon Kruger. Tryouts were held in Chicago. With one exception (David Wood), those selected were exclusively former college players whose pro experience was gained in the CBA and Europe. Brad Miller, undrafted out of Purdue, turned the opportunity into long-term profitable NBA career.\n\nThe high scorer (10.7) was Jason Sasser. Last week, he competed at the highest level in a Masters Tournament (64 teams from all over the country) in Miami and Deerfield; his team, the Raiders, won the Over-40 tournament.\n\nSyracuse’s Wendell Alexis-who I favorably compared to Chris Mullin when they battled in the Big East-Jimmy Oliver, Jimmy King, Trajan Langdon & Co. won seven of nine, losing by two points to both Russia (on a controversial call, of course) and Lithuania. Yugoslavia (9-0) triumphed, Russia was second and Rudy’s 7-2 outfit convincingly beat the host Greeks for the bronze medal.\n\nUSA Men’s Basketball decision makers were so overwhelmed by Tomjanovich’s achievement, they put him in charge of the men’s team at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad. It was undefeated, 8-0.\n\nThank you to Frank Drucker for his contributions to this post.\n\nThe Man, the Myth and the Logo\n\nBy Peter Vecsey and column castigator Frank Drucker\n\n\"If there is one player, I would have liked to play against in his prime it would have been Jerry West. He was a great clutch shooter, he could jump, he was tough, and he was quick. I would have liked to test myself against him at his best.\"\n\n“How would I have done?”\n\n\"We'll never know. From what I have read about Jerry and from what others have told me, he played the game a lot like I did. He was a great scorer, but he also played good defense. Could he have stopped me? I don't think so.\"\n\nCould I have stopped him?\n\n\"I don't know. But it would have been a great matchup.\" For The Love Of The Game: My Story By Michael Jordan. Edited by Mark Vancil. 1998\n\nHuge thanks to column castigator Frank Drucker for digging through the treasure troves of stories and anecdotes on The Logo.\n\nOf the 75 seasons the National Basketball Association has been doing business casual, Jerry West has been intimately involved for 61 of them.\n\nA fly-by-night Lego Logo he isn’t.\n\nFor West, who turns 83 later this month (May 28th), has made palpable palm prints over four franchises, the pair In Los Angeles sandwiching Memphis and Golden State.\n\nWhere to begin in a six-decade sojourn with so many chapters, so many verses, so much wine and so much song…even when he didn’t always get along?\n\nWest’s staggering stat sheet doesn’t require rehashing here. If you’re unfamiliar, take two aspirin and call Dr. Naismith in the morning.\n\nWhat has made the man so complex is that or all the time he’s spent either pursuing or achieving success, it seems there’s been just as much time being unable to enjoy it.\n\nEven going into a phone booth (dating myself, sue me) and morphing into the suave silhouette of the league is something West hasn’t embraced.\n\nAs a Laker player non-pareil, it was the Celtics who were the bane of West’s existence.\n\nAs a player, West went to The Finals nine of his 14 years. The Lakers lost eight, the first six to the Celtics.\n\nHe then found a way to get even. As the Purple Reign’s general manager, he oversaw Showtime, then purloined both Kobe and Shaq, turning the Lakers into the bane of everyone else’s existence.\n\nHowever, West’s Laker tenure—as player, then coach, then GM—saw its share of acrimony.\n\nWest feuded with then-owner Jack Kent Cooke toward the end of his playing career, admitting years later that had there been free agency, he would’ve hightailed it out of Hollywood.\n\nIn 1976-77, Lakers were 53-29. Won 7-game series v Warriors, Got swept in Western Conference Finals by eventual champion Blazers. Owned Portland in regular season. Didn't have Kermit Washington (dumped after punch decimated Rudy Tomjanovich's face) or injured Lucius Allen.\n\nAs GM, he had Bryant and O’Neal both want out, the latter eventually getting his wish (though after West left for the Grizzlies).\n\nDuring an historic 18-year run in the Lakers front office, both as general manager (1982-1994) and executive VP of basketball operations (1995-2000), West’s teams captured four NBA Championships (1985, 1987, 1988, 2000) and made eight trips overall to The Finals. Additionally, following his departure after the Lakers’ 2000 NBA title, the team that he'd built completed its three-peat by capturing two additional titles in 2001 and 2002.\n\nOverall, West was affiliated in one capacity or another with the Lakers for seven of their Championships in Los Angeles (four as an executive, two as a special consultant and one as a player).\n\nAfter leaving the Lakers in 2000, West joined the Memphis Grizzlies as the team’s president of basketball operations in 2002. Two years later, in 2003-04, the Grizzlies engineered one of the greatest turnarounds in league history, winning 50 games and making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Following that season, West was rewarded with the NBA’s Executive of the Year award for the second time in his career. Overall during his five-year stint in Memphis, the Grizzlies made three Western Conference playoff appearances, but did not a single game.\n\nA Force in the Playoffs: Jerry West's points in the 1965 playoff series v Bullets, Western Conference Finals:\n\nGame 1 - 49\n\nGame 2 - 52\n\nGame 3 – 44\n\nGame 4 – 48\n\nGame 5 – 43\n\nGame 6 – 42\n\nA trip down memory lane with an adoring son:\n\nLakers legend gets own statue and tribute from son\n\nBy Peter Vecsey\n\nFebruary 18, 2011\n\nLOS ANGELES — One of the things I loved most about my father was him being unafraid to show me his faults once we became co-workers.\n\nFor the first 16 years as a newspaperman, a N.Y. Daily News door my father opened when I was a junior in high school, we often would spend five days a week together on the job, in the car, eating out and playing cards. He had the amazing capacity to help every bookmaker in the building to run a profitable business.\n\nBecause of those shared experiences, I like to think our connection was deepest of the five children.\n\nRyan West, a Lakers’ scout, is the sole son of five — David, Mike, Mark and Jonnie — to have worked with his famous father. Because of all the time he spent with his dad traveling around the country scrutinizing college players, gushing basketball and being privy to private pain, he, too, likes to think his relationship is deeper than his brothers.\n\nWho better to offer close-quartered perspective on Jerry West as we celebrated yesterday’s unfathomably overdue tribute to the former Lakers’ player, coach and executive. His statue was unveiled outside Staples Center flanking Magic Johnson, Chick Hearn, Oscar De La Hoya and Wayne Gretzky . . . and flaunting the preposterous omissions of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Elgin Baylor.\n\nOver the years, I have written many League Logo anecdotes — remarkable, hysterical and outrageous things I have seen or heard about him since the late 1950s when he and Oscar Robertson ruled college basketball.\n\nAnd then there are the emotional, heart-wrenching stories he has confided to me about teammates and his life growing up in West Virginia, the son of an angry, drunken, child-beating coal miner.\n\nJerry’s soon-to-be-released autobiography — “West by West; My Charmed, Tormented Life,” written with Jonathan Coleman — will plunge into that darkness and much more.\n\nIn the meantime, in an e-mail, I asked Ryan if he would be comfortable giving us an unfiltered look at his father.\n\n“Wow that’s a tough one, he’s so crazy,” he responded initially before sending me several follow-ups that evening and the following morning.\n\n“Well, he’s brutally honest, which at times can be tough and hard to hear,” he wrote. “But at the end of the day I appreciate the fact that he was straight forward with me.\n\n“I remember one time we were in New York on a scouting trip for the Big East Tournament and he asked me to meet him in the lobby at 11 a.m. I got out of the elevator at 10:58 and he was upset because I was late. He’s always on time, a complete perfectionist.\n\n“I remember the summer when he was trying to sign Shaq,” he wrote. “I was glued to his side throughout the whole process. If I was in my room and the phone rang I ran into his room and listened to every conversation. I saw him go through so many highs and lows that summer and when it finally looked like it was going to get done I’ve never seen him so excited.\n\n“And after they signed him I saw him drop down into deep depression because Orlando had accused him of tampering. I think of anything negative that ever affected him during his time as an executive that was probably the most hurtful thing because he is moral and honest and always followed the rules, and he was so hurt that someone questioned his character like that.\n\n“The funny thing with him is, he seems to function the best during chaos,” Ryan wrote. “When everything is cool and calm that’s when he goes crazy.\n\n“I think maybe the saddest thing for me to see was after the Lakers finally won the championship in 2000 after completely rebuilding the team when Magic retired. He couldn’t enjoy it. The stress and pressures of winning got to the point where he couldn’t take it anymore.\n\n“I will never forget when we won that year he did not come to Game 6 at Staples. My mom [Karen] and little brother [Jonnie, now playing for West Virginia] and I were at the game. We celebrated in the locker room after the game and the whole time I was saying to myself my dad should be here enjoying this, he put this all together.\n\n“After we arrived home hours after the game [we were trapped inside Staples because they were rioting outside], I ran upstairs into his room to give him a championship shirt and hat and he was in a horrible mood. He said nothing about the game or the riots. He looked at me and said I need you to run an errand in the morning and got back into bed. I wanted to hug him and share it with him, but he wanted no part of it. It was then that I knew that he needed to retire because he couldn’t enjoy winning anymore. All I’ve ever wanted is to see him happy and enjoy his life, and it’s hard because he’s so all over the place.”\n\nRyan, 31, is too young to have seen his father run full speed up court, stop short, ascend to a high-priestess plateau and flick in a flawlessly formed jumper from wherever. Didn’t see him coach, either; Karen was pregnant with him when he was finishing up a mostly unpleasant 3-year commitment.\n\n“I was born June 9, 1979,” he wrote. “The first time the Lakers ever beat the Celtics for the championship was on my birthday, June 9th, 1985. My mother was having a birthday party at our house during the game. My Dad was in the house watching the game and the cable went out I believe some time during the second quarter. Obviously, he was a nervous wreck. He had to listen to the rest of the game on the radio.\n\n“That was the only championship ring he would wear, because it represented the Lakers’ victory over the Celtics — we were not allowed to wear green in our house growing up. He is still haunted to this day by all those losses to Boston — on my birthday.\n\n“We were at the Chicago pre-draft camp when we were both working for the Grizzlies. Most of the time when we did dinner it was my dad and I, and all the Laker guys — Mitch Kupchak, Bill Bertka, Ronnie Lester, Gene Tormohlen.\n\n“So, we were at dinner and out of nowhere he gave this speech in front of everyone which was extremely embarrassing because I don’t like being the center of attention. He took his 1985 championship ring off and gave it to me. I was so touched it almost brought me to tears. After that day I have never seen him wear another ring.”\n\nWest factoids:\n\nJerry was the first ever draft pick of the Los Angeles Lakers #2 overall, behind Oscar Robertson, Cincinnati's territorial choice.\n\nExec of year with Lakers in 94-95 and Grizzlies in 2003-2004.\n\nDrafted James Worthy with his first pick as a GM in 1982.\n\nSelected Nick Van Exel in 2nd round, 37th overall in 1993.\n\nDrafted the often overlooked underrated star of his era Eddie Jones 10th overall in 1994.\n\nDrafted Kyle Lowry in 2006 with 24th pick, who was traded Feb. 19, 2009 as part of a 3-team transaction.

While his much-saluted triple-double preeminence makes it impossible for contemporary (i.e. largely oblivious regarding NBA history) fans to overlook, the majority, having only witnessed his meticulous wide-ranging efficiency in grainy film snippets, can’t comprehend such greatness.\n\nWhat’s more, their captivation with Michael Jordan forbids them from facing the unfathomable reality: There once was a 6-foot-5 guard – the league’s first big playmaker – who was as shrewdly competent and uncompromisingly competitive.\n\nIn the minds of many, Jordan’s six championship rings to Oscar’s one abruptly ends all comparisons. The disparity certainly seems to separate the two of a kind. Except for Scottie Pippen, Michael’s crowned Jordanaires were transposable. Oscar didn’t cash in until late in his career when he joined forces with Lew Alcindor/Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nConversely, His Airness didn’t have to combat Bill Russell’s Celtics, or Wilt’s 76ers, or Bob Pettit’s Hawks. Meaning the more facts and figures factored into the equation, the more indivisible Jordan and Robertson become.\n\nFor example, if you combine Oscar’s first five NBA seasons, he averaged a triple-double. The Elias Sports Bureau has done the math – 30.3 points, 10.4 boards and 10.6 assists. He’s actually one-tenth of a rebound shy of averaging a triple-double for six seasons.\n\nAdditionally, “whomever he defended felt like he was bench pressing a California mortgage,” duly notes former Bucks play-by-play connoisseur Eddie Doucette.\n\nThis is why numerous antique dealers of league lore – Wayne Embry and Al Attles, to name two – unequivocally identify The Big O as the game’s all-time No. 1 passer and perfectionist as well as its supreme being.\n\nAs dumb luck would have it, I caught the full fragrance of Oscar’s majesty at his first recital at the old Madison Square Garden, 50th Street and Eighth Avenue. It was the 1957-58 season and he was a sophomore at the University of Cincinnati, in town to play Seton Hall. I was a high-school sophomore and had been given a ticket to see four college teams that meant nothing to me; the attraction was the stimulation of being at the Garden and the next day bragging to friends about being there.\n\nMan, was that ever the place to be that night. Gushing points like an open hydrant, this guy I’d never heard of before saturated the stat sheet for 56 points. I had no idea a player could be so flawless in so many facets.\n\n“Oscar was an illusionist in sneakers, so smooth and clever on the floor that it was difficult for the average fan to appreciate how accomplished he was,” recalls Doucette, who, just out of college, first saw Robertson with the Cincinnati Royals and later had the opportunity to call the final three seasons of his career in Milwaukee.\n\n“I watched his every move from warm-ups to game’s end and never ceased to be amazed at how anyone 6-5 and 225 pounds could slip, unimpeded, through cracks meant only for shafts of light,” Doucette marvels still.\n\n“There was no flash, no sizzle, no soaring dunks that would elicit ‘oohs’ and ‘ahs.’ Oscar was an economy of effort. You’d never see him work on shots in warm-ups that he wouldn’t use in games. Everything was 18 feet and in. He made his way to the hoop like a safecracker hopscotching a laser grid attempting to get to the vault.”\n\nAttles’ first look at Oscar is indelibly etched in his memory bank. Both were 1960 draftees. Early in their rookie season there was a doubleheader in Syracuse – Celtics vs. Royals and Warriors vs. Nationals. Attles and Philly backcourt partner Guy Rodgers grabbed adjoining seats and focused on the already highly acclaimed Big O.\n\nAlmost immediately Oscar did something Attles had never witnessed before. As he came down court on a semi-break, K.C. Jones tried to intercept him, while a trailing Sam Jones tried to head him off at the pass from the opposite side.\n\nRevved up by the recollection, Attles says: “Oscar dribbled by both of ’em. That got K.C. into a heated rush. Oscar quickly stepped in between them and quickly stepped out. Bam! K.C. and Sam banged heads. I’d never seen anything like it.\n\n“I’m not telling you something I heard. I’m telling you something I saw.”\n\nTurning to Rodgers, Attles groaned, “We’re going to have a big problem with this guy.”\n\nAttles’ nickname is The Destroyer. Nobody, no matter how big and bad, wanted a piece of the Newark native. Manhandling opponents (teammates, too, when provoked) was the ticket he punched nightly to ride season upon season.\n\n“But I never rattled Oscar. He never blinked at full-court, hands-on pressure,” Attles says in awe. “And I never blocked his shot. He was never concerned about his defender. He always looked straight ahead at his teammates.”\n\nRobertson’s aplomb for getting teammates involved in the first three quarters played into Attles’ defensive game plan. He knew Oscar would look to score only four to six points in the first quarter, the same in the second and maybe eight to 10 in the third. If the verdict was in doubt in the fourth quarter, he’d go off for 12 to 18.\n\n“If I was lucky, I’d be in foul trouble long before then,” Attles says. There was one time, though, when Attles and Rodgers trapped Oscar near midcourt and stole the ball to preserve a win.\n\n“Listen to me,” Attles says, laughing. “Here I am talking about one incident. Once in my whole career I got the best of Oscar.”\n\nIf his grandkids know better, they won’t admit to getting tired hearing that story.\n\nEmbry vividly remembers Oscar’s outburst of 56 vs. Seton Hall. It was thoroughly expected. At the time Embry was playing for the Royals. For over a year he’d gained first-hand knowledge of Oscar’s oppression.\n\n“If you were any kind of a player, UC was the place to scrimmage in the offseason or on off days. Typically, winners would stay on the court,” Embry says. “It didn’t take long to realize we needed to get our wins early before Oscar showed up.”\n\nThe leading scorer for the Royals when Robertson arrived on the UC campus was Jack Twyman. Shortly afterward, the future Hall of Famer challenged the unflappable freshman to a little one-on-one.\n\n“Jack’ll kill me for giving you this,” Embry cackles, “but he hasn’t won a game yet. Oscar waxed us all.”\n\nEmbry and Robertson later became Royals teammates and roomed together. That is when Wayne really found out how driven Oscar was to excel and why he had total command of the game’s rudiments.\n\nOscar would carry a ball with him wherever he went. In fact, nobody but him was allowed to shoot his ball in pre-game warm-ups or practice, ever, honest.\n\nEmbry’s revelations about Oscar are endless. Each afternoon on the road he’d lie on the hotel bed shooting his ball into the air for a couple of hours, a perfect rotation and follow-through every time.\n\nFlushing out every last impurity from his system was a prime objective. So was staying ahead of arch-rival Jerry West. When Oscar wasn’t contending on the court, he was contending off it.\n\nLate one season Embry awoke from his afternoon nap to see Oscar studying the sports pages of the New York Post – in those days the only paper to carry a spread sheet of NBA stats.\n\n“I know what they all think,” Oscar said to Embry. “They all think West is going lead the league in scoring. But I’ve figured out I need to get 48 points against the Knicks to pass him. You had better set me some massive picks tonight, big fella.”\n\nIn 1970, Embry became Bucks GM, the league’s first African American to have that position. His initial trade, instigated by owner Wes Pavalon, was for Oscar, who still dominated his position and controlled court proceedings more than the coach. He told Larry Costello what would work and what would be good for the team.\n\nCostello liked Oscar but was uncomfortable with that arrangement.\n\n“I told Coz to let it go,” Embry says. “I told him to let Oscar do what he does best and coach all the other players. I told him to be thankful he can walk into the locker room and see No. 1 in one corner and No. 33 in the other. It should make you feel good you’ve now got a chance to win it all.”\n\n**********\n\nPart 2:\n\nNovember 30, 2007 | 10:00am\n\nSO FAR, I’ve received 172 e-mails regarding Sunday’s Oscar Robertson column, the biggest reader reaction of 2007 exempting last June’s Bill Russell perspective. January’s name-dropping piece of players and coaches responsible for pushing me into this profession elicited roughly the same response from many people in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s.\n\nClearly, we old folks have incurred little trouble making an Internet transition. My computer definitely helped to coordinate strewn thoughts, prolonging my attention span and enhancing my staying power on one subject.\n\nWhat’s just as clear is that there are a lot of excitable basketball fans out there, not just the elder generation, mind you, with a craving for the history of the game.\n\nThis is precisely why NBA TV initiated a half-hour weekly series, “The Vault” which spotlights – with footage, interviews and studio viewpoints by yours truly, Gail Goodrich and Fred Carter – former players and title teams who may or may not get sufficient credit for their accomplishments.\n\nRobertson and Elgin Baylor were first. The ’79 Sonics were next. This Sunday (6:30 p.m.) the focus is on Mark Price, Andrew Toney and Paul Westphal.\n\nHow’s that for a shameless plug? Lucky for you, had I not established a policy early-on in life never to read or a write a book, I’d probably be promoting a novel I just knocked off in this very sentence, or at least take out an advertisement for it on the same page.\n\nBut back to the Big O; I can’t put him away without sharing some interesting info that was sent my way off that column.\n\nThanks to John F. McMullen and Dick Vitale, my consciousness was reawakened to the fact Robertson had outscored Seton Hall, 56-54, the first time I saw him play as a University of Cincinnati sophomore. Numerous other readers swear they attended the doubleheader at the old Garden that momentous evening, too, and I believe ’em all, because each story offered vivid details.\n\nGuess who else was present Jan. 9, 1958? None other than Long Beach High School’s Larry Brown, accompanied by his older brother.\n\n“Cincinnati was recruiting Larry,” e-mailed Herb Brown, currently a Hawks assistant. “Following the game we went to the dressing room. Later we walked to the hotel with the coaching staff and Oscar, who was cradling a basketball. Connie Dierking, from Valley Stream, was the starting center on that team.\n\n“The next day Jimmy Cannon wrote a ‘Nobody Asked Me But’ column about the game. He noted that only about 8,000 people were at the game, but in light of Oscar’s 56 points, every basketball fan in New York City will claim they were at the game.”\n\nOscar constantly carrying around “his ball,” and allowing nobody to shoot with it, is an enduring image rendered by those who knew him best.\n\nOn the first day of training camp of the 1965-66 season, a 12th-round draft choice (No. 88) out of Benedict College, S.C., rebounded Oscar’s ball and shot it.\n\n“Hey, get your own ball, don’t shoot mine,” Oscar scolded Bob McCullough, fresh from scoring 36.5 his senior year, second in the country to Rick Barry.\n\n“Whatcha mean, your ball? Your name Spaulding?”\n\nRobertson and McCullough commenced to exchange harsh words. Wide Wayne Embry was forced to intercede on his teammates’ behalf. He explained to the rising rookie the Royals’ facts of life, but McCullough didn’t want to hear it. This was not the law of his land on the asphalt jungle of New York City, where loose balls and women were up for grabs. He was waived the very next day.\n\nMcCullough went back to Harlem and eventually succeeded the deceased Holcolmbe Rucker as tournament commissioner and started Each One, Teach One, a free-of-charge instructive clinic for children.\n\nEach summer in the late ’60s, early ’70s, Embry, who’d become an NBA GM, visited the playground on 155th Street and Eighth Avenue to scout street and ABA talent.\n\n“I’d always make a point of needling Bob,” Embry said, laughing. “I’d tell him, ‘Imagine the pro career you could’ve had if you’d only thrown Oscar his damn ball.’ ”\n\nIn August 1987, I had the pleasure of experiencing Oscar’s purist spirit directly. I had been invited to suit up for the annual Maurice Stokes benefit, old-timers only (a first for a writer), at Kutscher’s CC.\n\nOscar and Pete Maravich, 40 and frisky, was the starting backcourt of our squad. Cazzie Russell, Bob Cousy, Bob Davies and Kevin Loughery were on the other side. Midway into the first period coach Dolph Schayes sent me in for Oscar. You should’ve seen his face contort at the blasphemous substitution.\n\n“No (bleeping) way am I going to be replaced by a sportswriter,” Oscar steamed as he stormed back on the court. “No (bleeping) way that’s gonna happen.”\n\nI understood perfectly.\n\nHowever, had Satch Sanders not gone out on the floor and cajoled Oscar to the sidelines, I would’ve been deprived of the biggest thrill of my sporting life . . . besting the surreal split second in the Rucker (Harlem Professional) Tournament when I delivered a no-look pass on the run to Julius Erving for a bombastic aghast.\n\nLate in the second half at Kutscher’s I found myself on another fantasy fastbreak, a sportswriter and Pistol Pete skipping the night fantastic, with only one man to beat.\n\nMaravich delivered a pass only his kind of showmanship could provide, and he hit me square in the hands in textbook stride with an around-the-back pass; I thank God to this day I was able to convert it into a lefty layup.\n\n“Don’t ever say I didn’t give you anything,” Pistol said.\n\nFive months later, Jan. 5, 1988, while playing pickup ball in Pasadena, Calif., Maravich died of heart failure.\n\nSlick Stories - In Memory of Slick Leonard\n\nBy Peter Vecsey\n\nDamon Runyon was a Slick Leonard character.\n\nI should probably stop right there. Daring to amplify and illuminate that declaration when Slick is not here to deny or confirm the stories I’m about to blab, could get me in trouble with his immediate family spread densely throughout the state of Indiana.\n\nAt the same time, anyone who knows anything about Slick knows everything you’re about to read is unassailable. Still, many may feel it’s too soon following his passing last Tuesday at 88 to exhume the 98-proof quintessence of the man.\n\nOn the other hand, I can opinion with complete certainty Slick would not only unequivocally approve of toothsome stories about his life being re-told in some cases, divulged in others, he’d encourage the courage to do so.\n\nHow can I be so sure? Robin Miller supplied proof positive when we spoke Sunday. At 19, with no journalistic background, he began covering the Pacers for the Indianapolis Star after a year of answering phones in the sports department.\n\nBeen there, done that, and so has everyone in the Vecsey family.\n\nDuring that year of manning phones, Miller, not knowing his place, would call Slick at home (“841, 1520”) and question him about the last game, or the upcoming one. “I’m 18, what I know what I’m supposed to do or not supposed to do. Even though it was an off day, and I asked him countless dumb questions, he always talk to me for ten minutes or so.”\n\nThat formative relationship rapidly developed into the real deal when Miller began hanging around the Pacers on a regular basis. The hallowed Hoosier welcomed ‘Jimmy Olsen’ into his company, and the cub reporter was given free rein to enter the locker room at halftime. He even sat in on two team meetings.\n\n“Slick taught me how to read a racing form, took me to my first strip club, and I learned how to use the word fuck as a noun, a verb and an adjective.”\n\nA few years ago, Miller authored ‘We Changed the Game’ (with Bob Netolicky and Pacers’ founding father Dick Tinkham) about the team’s nine-year existence of mischief and misconduct. He stayed in constant touch with Leonard.\n\nAbout a week before Slick died, Miller, undergoing cancer treatment in a clinic, called him in the hospital where Leonard’s long-damaged heart was functioning at 40 percent capacity.\n\n“Hey, Robby, need any money? You gotta take care of your grandkids. How come I didn’t have this kind of (pension) money when I could’ve spent it on something worthwhile? Doesn’t do me any good now.\n\n“I got an idea, Robby; when you’re finished with your treatment, why don’t you pick me up and we’ll go to the races in Anderson. You can drop me home at night.”\n\nWhen Roger Brown died, his eulogy was held at Market Square Arena. George McGinnis was first to speak but stopped abruptly when he began to cry. Mel Daniels got up and cried even more. It was Miller’s turn.\n\nAs he was about to get up, Slick mockingly asked, “You’re not gonna start crying, too, are you? We’re here to celebrate his life. Let’s put some life into this.”\n\nAt last, the evidence I initially promised.\n\nGiven Slick’s unrestricted permission, Miller told a story that’s supposed to stay in the locker room. About the time a beautiful woman emerged from the stands before a game and approached Brown, who was on the layup line, so to speak.\n\n“If you take the first shot of the game, I’ll know we’re going to get together later tonight,” she said suggestively.\n\nOff the opening tap, Miller recounted, Brown “hoisted a 40-footer…an air ball.”\n\nLast week, as Miller was getting ready to hang up, Slick said, “I love you, Robby.\"\n\n“I love you, too.”\n\n*****\n\nIn Ted Green’s six-year-old must-devour documentary (‘Heart of a Hoosier’) about Slick Leonard, Hall of Fame coach Branch McCracken insisted his Indiana University players do not smoke, drink or gamble.\n\n“Those were Bob’s three favorite occupations,” wryly noted Green, the narrator.\n\nOne night, a game of quarter and a half stud poker was underway at a den of iniquity when a police raid took place. Everyone made a mad dash for the exit except Slick. “I stuffed the quarters and half dollars in my pocket.”\n\nThe next morning’s paper listed the rounded up participants. Leonard’s name was not among them. His sigh of relief wasn’t exhaled before McCracken arrived at his room. He ordered Slick to be in his office at 3 o’clock.\n\n“He tore me apart. He really reamed me,” Slick recalled in the doc. He said, ‘If I ever have to call you in here again, only one of us will walk out.’\n\n“And you know which one that’ll be,” Slick retorted “as I took off. I know he was laughing after I left. From then on, I was the team leader.”\n\nIn 1953, Slick converted the free throw that ultimately decided a 69-68 win over Kansas (think Dean Smith) for the NCAA title. At the 27-second mark, he’d been fouled driving to the halo. He claimed to be a decent free throw shooter, but gagged the first try.\n\n“The pressure was on for the first one. I thought the pressure was really on now.”\n\nNothin’ but macreame!\n\nA misfired corner shot with two seconds remaining elevated the two-time All American to pinup status. Interviewed at midcourt, McCracken said Slick had “ice water in his veins.” Slick chuckled. “It felt more like warm water running down my leg.”\n\n****\n\nBob Netolicky played on two of the three Pacer championships coached by Slick. Like many of the players, he tested Leonard, physically and verbally.\n\nThe most aberrant skirmish between the pair occurred in Duluth, Minnesota soon after Slick replaced Larry Staverman 13 games into the ’68-69 season. Wielding a hockey stick found in the locker room, Slick chased Neto, accused of cruising in the first half.\n\n“I escaped by locking myself in the bathroom. He broke the hockey stick against the door.”\n\nAnother season, Slick, decked out in his customary leisure suit (only its color changed day to day), wrestled with Neto in the mud and the scrubs outside a hotel in West Hempstead as the team checked out.\n\nDecades before Latrell Sprewell twice choked P.J. Carlisemo at Warriors’ practice, Slick engaged in a shoving match with an especially reluctant George McGinnis outside a bar. McGinnis pushed Slick so hard to the ground, his comb over flipped sides, says an eyewitness. No problem. Slick got himself upright and returned to the bar with McGinnis and resumed drinking.\n\nIncensed by something Slick said at practice, Mel Daniels pinned him against the wall by the throat until he lost consciousness.\n\nYet, to Mel’s dying day, he pledged unending allegiance to Slick. If ever needed, he vowed to do anything, or be anywhere, for him.\n\nSame for McGinnis, who says Slick was like a father to him. George’s dad had died in a construction accident. Slick shouldered the role and expressed his love for him.\n\nMeanwhile, Neto was so happy the Pacers reacquired him he eagerly accepted backing up McGinnis, being steadily berated by Slick and trying unsuccessfully to drink him off the barstool for money, a bet Daniels failed to cash either.\n\n“Foster Brooks got all his routines from Slick,” Neto maintains. “If we were on a losing streak, he was likely to stop in a bar before a game and have a few pops or more.\n\nBilly Keller remembers what happened when the Pacers lost a few straight. “He’d have sunglasses on, and hang out far away from us at the end of the airport terminal. Then he’d come late to the bus, and wouldn’t talk to us. He let us know he wasn’t happy.”\n\nSlick’s competitive spirit would be fable fodder except there was nothing imaginary or exaggerated about it. Keller recalls an exhibition in Slick’s birthplace, Terre Haute, against an NBA team.\n\n“He was real angry at us and didn’t mince words. Then he kicked the chalkboard so hard it tipped over and reversed itself. It hit him in the head. He was about ready to fall. After helping him, we got the hell out of the locker room cause he started throwing balls.”\n\nNetolicky vividly recollects the Pacers losing three or four straight and the upshot. Slick felt the players were panicking. He had them dress early for a home game, and they just sat in the locker room while he read them the riot act individually and collectively.\n\n“We’re a family, and we’re getting away from what life is all about,” Slick seethed. “Starting tonight, we’re going to have a team prayer. We’re going to pray for each other. Understand?! Now, bow your mother fuckin’ heads.’”\n\nIt’s not like Neto is revealing secrets. Slick drank (and smoked) a lot almost to the end of his life. Then again, he probably stopped only when Nancy was on patrol. He also fought a lot throughout his playing and coaching careers. Furthermore, often drank with the person he’d just fought, friend or foe.\n\nI’m unsure of the exact year, 1973, perhaps, but I’ll never forget the brawl in Indianapolis pitting the Pacers against Al Bianchi’s Squires. It raged so out of control, the police were forced to get intimately involved. They took their lumps. Which got Bianchi and several players arrested and escorted downtown to get booked.\n\nPacer executives futilely tried to intercede. David Craig, the Pacers’ long-time team trainer, told me “Slick went to the police station and tried to bail out his friend Bianchi. He no doubt wanted to have a drink with him.”\n\nCraig was hired by Slick shortly after graduating college. They met at Sandy’s Pound Tavern, 38th& Collins, directly across from the Pacers offices.\n\n“Do you know who I am?” Slick asked.\n\nCraig assured him he did.\n\n“Well, I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m from Indiana University, and I’m thinking about hiring a kid from Purdue. Let’s have a drink. Not long after, he informed Craig he’d been hired.\n\n“Be here tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.”\n\n“Will you be there?”\n\n“No, that’s why I’m hiring you.”\n\nCraig wound up working 38 years for the Pacers, 35 as head athletic trainer, and three in the front office.\n\n“Slick was one of the most natural leaders I ever met. Players knew he cared. That’s why he could get the most out of them. He pushed them hard. And he loved them.\n\n“He’d give you hell, and then buy you a beer,” Billy Keller said.\n\nCraig said it best: “Slick had an ability to put an arm around a player’s shoulder, and one foot up his ass.”\n\n****\n\nOne shoulder Slick declined to massage was Rick Mount. From the start of training camp, the Hoosiers’ remarkable guard seemingly had it in for the state’s and Purdue’s all-time seamless shooter. Even before, actually, at the off-season press conference to announce his signing.\n\nTeam president Mike Storen drafted Mount (3,800 season tickets were sold overnight) over the obstreperous objections of Slick, intent on keeping his championship rotation in tact.\n\n“I asked Storen why Slick didn’t attend,” Mount told me in an interview in September 2017. “I was told he didn’t want me here. Then I don’t want to be here.”\n\nStoren refused to trade Mount. Then went to Kentucky and “left me holding the bag.”\n\nMount said he came to camp in great shape, but pulled a hamstring. In 66 games, he averaged a mere 12.6 minutes. “I could’ve gone to Seattle. Lenny Wilkens saw me play in an all-star game in Memphis and said he wanted someone he could pass to. I wanted to stay home.” The Sonics instead drafted Downtown Freddie Brown.\n\nIn Mount’s first rookie scrimmage, “I hit six threes. After each make, Slick would say, “We’re not at Purdue now, Mount.\n\n“What does that mean?” I asked.\n\n“You’re gonna sit here and eat shit?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“You’re just gonna sit here and eat shit.”\n\n“I’m in trouble now, I said to myself.”\n\nStill, the following season, Mount averaged 14.3 points and 2.9 assists in 27.3 minutes, playing a vital role in the team’s title.\n\nMount was traded to Storen’s Kentucky in year three (14.9 ppg).\n\n“People say, ‘let it go.’ Mount told me during our 2-hour lunch in 2017, an hour from Indianapolis where the ABA was conducting its 50threunion. He had not! Rick refused to attend, knowing Slick would be there.\n\n*****\n\nDavid Benner worked eight years as a Pacers’ beat writer. The last 27 he has been the team’s publicity director.\n\n“As a kid, my father would take me to a Pacers’ game every once and awhile, and I’d say to myself, ‘Man, I wouldn’t want to play for that guy.”\n\nThat guy being Slick, a ranting, raving tyrant.\n\n“Once he was done with coaching, and joined the broadcast side, Slick became the sweetest human being ever. ‘Hey, Benny, how you doing?’ And he’d give me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. He was that way with everyone.”\n\n“Slick never met my mother or father,” Benner said. “But he took the time to come to both their funerals. Obviously, we were friends. Friends do that. Still, it says something about this guy, who is a legend in this state, and, obviously, without him, we don’t have the team we have today. It says everything you have to know about Slick.\n\n“My family wasn’t the only one he cared enough about to come and pay his respects. When he passed, when we got the news, for me, and a lot of other people were in tears. Thinking about stuff. Thinking about his philosophies on life. How we continued our education being around him. The sincerity of it all.\n\nHe was quite a character.\n\nMcGinnis, Neto and Darnell Hillman, were invited by Nancy Leonard to speak at Wednesday’s small family ceremony.\n\n****\n\nAfterthought: If we’re gonna write about Slick Leonard, we gotta talk to someone who actually saw him play. That would be Del Harris, born in Plainfield, IN, five years later than Slick in Terre Haute.\n\n“I definitely saw him play in college, during Indiana’s championship year. He had a step back (I copied as a kid) that transitioned into a set shot. He had great footwork. He’d jab step with a bounce in, then create space by faking right foot, right hand, step backward and shoot two-hander. The defender had to give a little or else he’d go all the way. He also had kind of a jump shot, where he’d fold his legs, a ‘50s and ‘60s thing, not like the straight legged shooters of today.”\n\nJust thought I’d throw a little basketball in there since this is supposed to be a basketball column.\n\n*****\n\nGail Goodrich turns 78 April 23. Today marks five years since the passing of Brooklyn's own Dwayne Alonzo \"Pearl\" Washington. Pearl would've been 57.\n\nPuttin' The Rock In The Hoop\n\nToday's Hoop du Jour is presented by Peter Vecsey (brain drizzle), Frank Drucker (author) and Jason Javaherian (researcher).\n\nLater this month (April 22, 1989) marks the 32nd anniversary of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s final regular-season game.\n\nThe Lord of the Rims went 5-6 from the Fabulous Forum floor for an efficient ten points.\n\nThus ended his ‘regular season’ stats, the point total a nearly-symmetrical 38,387.\n\nThat hasn’t been surpassed since. Though, it says here, one or more prolific pursuer might’ve purloined the perch had an influx of impairments not arisen.\n\nHell, even ‘Cap’ wasn’t immune.\n\nLet’s go there first.\n\nCoin-flipped from Westwood to Wisconsin, then-Lew Alcindor made his NBA regular-season debut October 18, 1969 at the age of 22…barely 48 hours after the Mets won the World Series.\n\nHe went for 29 (and 19 rebounds) in a coming-out party at the expense of the Pistons, a decent start to an ‘irrelevant’, two-decade (six Milwaukee, 14 LA) career.\n\nA deacon of durability, the Centrifugal Force only went AWOL twice of note, missing 17 games (1974-75) largely from unsanctioned bout with a basket stanchion during preseason and 20 (‘77-‘78) after his fist organized a meet-and-greet with Kent Benson’s face in the season opener.\n\nAt the time, a Lakers’ source informed me Kareem Did Not break his right hand when he coldcocked Benson in retaliation for elbowing him in the solar plexus. I was told it happened in his Milwaukee hotel, the Pfister.\n\nAccording to the source, Kareem busted up the room, including a television set and table. His injury was sustained during that outburst, which was covered up by team officials and hotel employees.\n\nTake those 37 games and multiply them by Abdul-Jabbar’s averages during the two seasons (30 and 25-ish, respectively) and we’re at about 1,010 points.\n\nAdd those to the aforementioned 38,387 and we’re at a hypothetical 39,487.\n\n...and lest we forget Kareem did not have any season short-sheeted by a strike, lockout, rule changes, pandemic, dog ate his homework, etc.\n\nPlaying until 42 wasn’t bad, either.\n\nCap’s curse takes control from here on in.\n\nKarl Malone (36,928) sits at No. 2 on the hit parade. The Mailman, another who rarely recoiled from his appointed rounds, as in at least 80 games in 17 of his 18 full (the operative word) seasons.\n\nSpeed-bumps...a 50-game lockout season (‘98-‘99, he played in 49) and his fairly-forgettable finale--42 ring-chasing games for ‘03-‘04 Lakers, ‘lowlighted’ by a MCL tear and subsequent misdiagnosis just as Malone was bearing down on Kareem\n\nGive Malone his nearly 24 points per game for 32 games during the abbreviated assemblage and that’s an additional 768 (37,696)\n\nI adamantly refuse to remember his Lakers loitering, so there.\n\nFeel free to speculate the stats had common-law court mate John Stockton hung around for another year, perhaps enticing Malone to stay put.\n\nThen again, we could argue that Malone’s penchant to use varying opponents as elbow macaroni should’ve sent him to deserved detention for far longer than one game at a time, seven total.\n\nThink about it, Malone was suspended a single game and fined 10G for fracturing the face (40 stitches, Dec. 14, 1991, shelving him for three games) of Isiah Thomas with an errant (no such thing) elbow. Today’s sentence would be ten or more games.\n\nLeBron resides at No. 3 (35,283) though has hit pause at the moment due to a right ankle sprain he probably would’ve shook off overnight a few years ago. His current age is 36 years, 103 days.\n\nJames’ journey began with the chronological straight-outta-high-school advantage. He needs 3,105 points to abdicate Abdul-Jabbar, or about 1½ seasons’ work at a shade over 25 points per game.\n\n...or longer.\n\n...or not at all.\n\nThis already-truncated (72 games) season has seen LeBron miss 13 and counting. Reports have him out another three weeks or so. Only two seasons removed from taking his talents to Tinsel Town, and missing gaggles of games with a groin malfunction (I hate when that happens), duress and desire are about to intersect.\n\nNo disrespect, but Father Time and AARP have placed courtesy calls.\n\nStill, LBJ may very well overtake Kareem even without full health, as long as it’s nothing crippling. But he must produce a high scoring standard in the next three seasons. The 3,105 can be had even if he averages a mere 41 games a season at 25 ppg. A fourth year, one in which he will turn 40, with the same number of games he has played (41) this year would put him at 39,383, roughly a thousand more than Kareem.\n\nAt the same time, nothing is guaranteed at 40, unless you’re Kareem.\n\nSitting at No. 4 (33,643) is the late, great Kobe Bean Bryant.\n\nAs with James, Bryant arrived having taking no college prep courses, leapfrogging from Lower Merion into the unwanting arms...\n\n...of the Charlotte Hornets. Briefly.\n\nStymied at the start of his career (seven starts his first two seasons), Kobe’s career began with a DNP against Phoenix. Next, at home versus Minnesota...six minutes, no points.\n\nIt wasn’t until the bright lights of New York City when Kobe was able to score. He converted a free throw at the World’s Most Famous Arena, every kid’s dream.\n\nThere were four times in a six-season stretch (‘99-00 to ‘04-‘05) that he maxed out at 68 games played.\n\nOf course, the Lakers were three-peating during that time, but that’s not the issue here.\n\nBryant’s bandwagon was derailed in mid-April of 2013, tearing an Achilles against Golden State.\n\nSubsequently, he played in just 25 percent (41 of 164) of LA’s games the next two seasons.\n\nIf you want to buy the premise of a healthy Bryant playing 70 games in each of those seasons and averaging 27.3 point (his previous full-season number), that’s 3,822 points.\n\nThen subtract his actual 865 points and you get 2,957. Add that to his above total and the ‘new’ figure is 36,600.\n\nKobe flaunts the greatest disparity in league history—59 points—between his free throw at the Garden and the 60 he manufactured in his go-away game, and it’s guaranteed to be his to forever have and hold.\n\nOther Non-bandage blockades...A pair of work stoppages (‘98-99, ‘11-12) caused the league to forego 48 (32 & 16) games. Of the 116 games during those seasons, Bryant appeared in 108.\n\nSitting at 32,292 points, some guy named Jordan resides at Number Five.\n\nAs the leader of the six-ring circus, his career has been thoroughly analyzed by those of us in desperate need of thorough analysis.\n\nWhat if his minutes hadn’t been massaged upon returning (after missing 64 games) from a broken foot three games into his sophomore season?\n\nWhat if he hadn’t bolted to the Birmingham Barons, thus missing 1¾ after the Bulls’ third title?\n\nWhat if Chicago management hadn’t made 1997-98 so uncomfortable for Phil Jackson he was compelled to leave?\n\nWhat if Jerry Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause had not dismembered The Jordanaires after that second three-peat?\n\nWhat if His Airness hadn’t hibernated a second time, missing a trio of years before taking a Wiz for two?\n\nHitting .202 for the Barons in 1994 cost Michael 4,763 points We arrive here using his ‘92-93 season average (32.6) and the average games played (81) in his eight healthy seasons.\n\nThe lump sum would have given M. J. close to Kobe’s projection of just about 37,000.\n\nThat’s still 1,300 or so points shy of Kareem, but with Jordan, there’s always more to the missive.\n\nJordan’s second retirement came after he played back-to-back-to-back 82-game seasons, averaging 28.7 points in the Last Dance.\n\nHad he come back the following season(s)—Chicago clothing or not—an 82-game season at 28.7 would’ve meant 2,357 points, leaving him at the top spot with a thousand-point cushion.\n\nWait, there’s an Air Jordan asterisk afloat. The ‘98 lockout would’ve reduced (for this purpose) him to 1,435 points (50 games).\n\nBut to truly do Jordan right, let’s take away the 3,015 points he earned with the Wizards and proceed as if he hadn't stepped away a second time.\n\nRemember, he put up those numbers after three full seasons absent from action. If we give M. J. the 1,435 in the lockout-shortened year and give him the full year of 82 games (1999-2000), that’s another 2,357 points.\n\nJordan then would have hit 37,832 at the end of ‘99-‘00, 555 points shy of the record.\n\nHe then would have needed to play a third season (2000-2001), as opposed to the two closeouts in the District.\n\nIf you’re scoring at home (get help), going off the 28.7 a game, a 37-year-old GOAT would have broken the streak in the twentieth game of the 2000-2001 NBA season. You can look up who “they” played.\n\nHad Jordan played every game that season (as he did as a 40-year-old his actual last), he would have padded the record by 1,779 points and become the first ever to 40,000. 40,166 to be not-quite-exact.\n\nSpeed bumps...Did you not just read this?\n\nWhew, my abacus and I are tired.\n\nAs a bonus, current contenders/pretenders...\n\nKevin Durant (23,530). He’s 32, going through an injury-plagued 13th season after missing all of the last one.\n\nHe’d need seven 2,000-point seasons to come close to Kareem. To give you an idea of what that takes, two seasons ago, a healthy Durant played in 78 Golden State games (age 30), averaging 27 points. His point total was 2,027.\n\nDurant thus would have to play supreme ball over complete seasons, averaging 2,000 a year post-Achilles. A freshly-turned 39-year-old Durant needs to play into that 20th season, score 2,000 (77 games 27 ppg), to sit at 37,530.\n\nThat’s still 800 shy of the Sky Hook.\n\nJames Harden (22,022). At 31, he’s 11 months younger than Durant, 1,500 fewer points in one less season.\n\nIn 12 years, Harden has put up beaucoup numbers, making a run at another 2,000-point season now, though may come up short with ten fewer games on the schedule.\n\nThis would be his seventh in a row. He dropped 2,818 points in 2018-2019, winning the MVP the prior season with 627 fewer points. If Harden averaged 2,200 a year the next five (11,000), he’d enter the season turning 38 at 33,000 or so points, needing an additional 5,500 to pass Kareem.\n\nHis current streak of 2,000-plus points certainly gives him a boost, but he will most probably, like many before him, need a miracle in the stretch run.\n\nDid you know?\n\nMost of us view the greatest assist and steals man the league has ever seen to be just that, but John Stockton ranks 52nd on the NBA’s all-time scoring list with 19,711 points.\n\nIn 53rd place, with 19,655, Bernard King.\n\nElgin and the Lakers’ Cornfield Angel\n\nBy Peter Vecsey\n\nWhile the masses clustered to venerate Elgin Baylor’s glorious game in death after decades of habitually omitting him his rightful residence among the elite players in planet history whenever the topic was raised and reasoned, I choose to look at his passing from an incongruent angle.\n\nMy paramount thought upon hearing Boneaylor had transitioned was, if not for pilot Harold Gifford’s inestimable expertise and experience, the 6-5 inflight gymnast, owner of the NBA’s third highest scoring average behind Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan, would’ve perished 61 years ago along with everyone else on a Lakers’ gas-drained, lights-out DC3 charter forced to land during a snowstorm in a Carroll, Iowa, cornfield.\n\n“Yes,” Gifford concurred when contacted at his home outside Minneapolis. “I had something to do with Baylor completing his legacy and enjoying everlasting fame. But I benefited, too.”\n\nGifford is 97, a categorically coherent 97. Numerous times he put me to shame with his fine-tuned faculty to name names, only occasionally pausing to dig deep into the distant past.\n\n“I’m still perking, and I still have all my original parts,” he responded to my compliment about his impeccable memory bank.\n\nDuring several extended conversations we’ve had over the last few days, he bombarded me with dozens and dozens of details of that five-hour and 40-minute scramble that began in distress upon takeoff from St. Louis after a loss to the Hawks en route to Minneapolis, and came within Gifford’s ripened reflex of calamity when he scarcely avoided treetops.\n\n“Elgin was a very private person,” Gifford said when asked what, if anything, he recollected about Baylor. “I was never able to contact him over the years.”\n\nGifford does remember him being very apprehensive about flying. Remembered him coming into the cockpit and asking how high they were flying, or where they were. Chicago, or some such distinguished place was p"
