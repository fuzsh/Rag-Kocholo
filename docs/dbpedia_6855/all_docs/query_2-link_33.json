        "text": "History\n\nNarrative Summary\n\nUnlike the Australian Flying Corps that served during WW1 and was a branch of the Army, the Royal Australian Air Force was established in 1921 as an independent air arm modelled on the Royal Air Force in Britain.\n\n1920 Australian Flying Corps disbanded. 1920 Australian Air Corps (AAC) established. 31 March 1921 AAC renamed the Australian Air Force. 31 August 1921 Royal prefix added – Royal Australian Air Force. 1939-1945 RAAF units serve in Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as the Pacific during WW2. 1950-1953 RAAF units participate in the Korean War. 1964-1972 RAAF units particpate in the Vietnam War. 1999 Peacekeeping operations in East Timor begin. 2003 RAAF units participate in the Second Gulf War/Iraq War. 2010 RAAF detachment begins operating UAVs in Afghanistan. 2014 RAAF units join the coalition to combat extremist forces in northern Iraq.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nAll RAAF aircraft and helicopters are currently active.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nTake delivery of 14 Lockheed Martin F-35s.\n\nMarkings\n\nNational Insignia\n\nRAAF aircraft oringinally used the same national insignia as the Royal Air Force of the British Empire – i.e. a red/white/blue roundel in the normal six positions. In June 1942 it was decided to paint out the centre red disk from the roundel to avoid any possible confusion with the Japanese national insignia. This resulted in a white disk with a thick blue outline. For aircraft supplied by the USA, a quick conversion of the national insignia was to replace the central star marking with the white/blue roundel and leave the side bars unchanged.\n\nIn late 1945 the roundel reverted back to the RAF pattern. In 1947 the central red disk of the fuselage roundel was replaced by a red kangaroo – the wing roundels were unchanged. From September 1956 the kangaroo marking was adopted for all roundel positions. In the 1980s a low-visibility black or grey version was introduced.\n\nA red/white/blue fin flash has been carried on the fin or rudder from the creation of the RAAF, but was replaced by a white/blue fin flash in the period 1942-1945. The service titles ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE are carried on the fuselage sides of transport aircraft.\n\nAircraft Serial Numbers\n\nAircraft operating with the RAAF carry serials with a prefix identifying the basic aircraft followed by an individual aircraft number, e.g. Hawk A27-28.\n\nThe prefix numbers have been issued in three different series:\n\nFirst Series (1921-1934)\n\nThe first series ran A1 to A12, but A5 was allocated twice, due to the Vickers Vimy not being delivered.\n\nSecond Series (1935-1960)\n\nThe second series ran A1 to A100. Some aircraft types delivered from the UK retained their RAF serials in RAAF use.\n\nThird Series (1961-Present)\n\nThe third series currently runs A1 to A69. The 24 F-4E leased by the RAAF in the early 1970s retained their USAF serials, but were allocated the RAAF designator A69 for administrative purposes. Some prefixes have not been used to avoid confict with RAN ‘N’ prefixes.\n\nUnit/Base Codes\n\nA Royal Air Force-style unit coding system was used 1939-1945. Details to be added.\n\nAircraft\n\nAircraft Designations\n\nNone – Manufacturers designations used\n\nCurrent Aircraft Inventory\n\nTable of Current Service Aircraft\n\nAll-Time Aircraft Used List\n\nAll-Time Table of Aircraft Used\n\nAircraft NOT Used\n\nTo be added.\n\nAircraft Losses and Incidents\n\nTo be added.\n\nOrganisation\n\nMain Headquarters\n\nAir Force Headquarters, Russell Offices, Canberra, ACT.\n\nOrganisational Structure\n\nThe RAAF flying units come under Air Command, which made up of 4 Groups – Surveillance & Response Groups, Air Combat Group, Air Mobility Group and Air Training Group. Each Group is sub-divided into 2 or 3 Wings of 1-4 Squadrons each.\n\nCurrent Order of Battle\n\nTable of Current Order of Battle\n\nHistorical Orders of Battle\n\nList of Historical Orders of Battle – to be added.\n\nAll-Time Flying Units List\n\nUnits Listing\n\nAir Bases\n\nCurrent Air Bases\n\nSee current order of battle.\n\nAll-Time Air Bases Used List\n\nTo be added.\n\nAircraft-Carrying Ships\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm was not formed until 1947, so before that time shipboard aircraft were owned by the RAAF. A list of ships RAAF aircraft operated from will be added.\n\nMore Information\n\nBooks\n\nNone known.\n\nMagazines\n\nTo be added\n\nWebsites\n\nwikipedia: Royal Australian Air Force\n\nOfficial website\n\nFacebook: Royal Australian Air Force\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force Association\n\nAustralian War Memorial: RAAF\n\nAny photographs illustrating this operator would be welcome.\n\nThis page
