Inexperienced in the art of writing for the public, it is probable that he has fallen into many errors, which, with more time, he might have avoided; but works of the nature of this admit of little delay. Narratives of voyages of discoveries lose much of their interest if the publication be long deferred.\n\nThe principal object which the compiler had in view, was to unite the documents confided to him, so as to present a faithful description of the country over which the party travelled, and of the few adventures which interrupted the monotony of a journey through a wilderness.\n\nIt may be well to state, that the historical part of the narrative, together with the topographical and much of the descriptive matter, has been\n\nviii\n\ndrawn from Major Long's notes. Mr. Colhoun's manuscripts, besides contributing to the same departments, and yielding the astronomical observations, have been very valuable in furnishing the greater part of the references to older writers. The comparisons between the observations made by our party and the assertions of former travellers, are almost entirely due to that gentleman. From Mr. Say's notes, all that relates to the zoology and botany of the country traversed has been obtained, as well as much of the matter relating to the Indians. This last department has been completed from the compiler's own notes, which have likewise furnished the geological observations. Besides which, the journals kept by each of the gentlemen have frequently completed the observations made by some other member of the party. It has been deemed unnecessary to state, in all cases, by whom the observations were made or recorded. This has, however, been done whenever the facts appeared sufficiently interesting to require that the names of the observers should be annexed to them.\n\nAs Major Long's report to the War Department presents a concise summary of the general features of the country visited by the party, it has been thought advisable to introduce it as a conclusion to the narrative. Having been ordered to the Ohio to make an experiment to improve its navigation,\n\nix\n\naccording to the provisions of a late act of congress, Major Long was absent from Philadelphia during the preparation of that part of the manuscript which follows the three first chapters of the first volume. This may account for some of the inaccuracies which the work will be found to contain: it is hoped that by his presence they would have been avoided.\n\nThe compiler has found it impossible, in the description of the scenery of the Mississippi, &c. to avoid the introduction of several words, which, although they are not sanctioned by the dictionaries, seem to be characteristic and essential in such descriptions: of this nature are the words — bluff, prairie, &c. The term creek, being used in different acceptations in England and America, has been avoided in all cases, though with some inconvenience. The word run will, it is believed, be found but once in the body of the work. Lest any false impression should be drawn from the introduction of the term estuary, it may be proper to state, that it has been inadvertently used in several cases to designate the outlets of streams where the tides do not reciprocate. In compiling from notes written by many persons under the disadvantages of fatigues, hardships, and privations, it is not easy, however it may be desirable, to avoid the use of all objectionable terms; for these and other inaccuracies which the work may,\n\nx\n\ncontain, the compiler must plead in excuse the difficulties to which he has previously alluded.\n\nThe greater part of the Appendix will be found to have been prepared by Mr. Say. The loss which he experienced of the skins of many birds, quadrupeds, and fish, which he had collected, has prevented him from describing several new animals. It is believed, that if none of the shells collected had been lost, the amount of new species described would have been much greater. The plants preserved by Mr. Say were placed in the hands of Mr. Lewis D. Von Schwcinitz, who kindly undertook to describe them: the result of his valuable observations will be found in the Appendix. With a view to give an idea of the climate of the country described, as well as to compare it with other places whose climate has been ascertained by older observations, the interesting tables prepared by Dr. Joseph Lovell, surgeon-general of the United States' army, have been introduced, with his general observations upon the same. They are compiled from the records kept at the various military posts. The climate of Philadelphia has been established by the results of the observations made by Mr. Reuben Haines, at his residence in German-town, six miles from Philadelphia; the great care which Mr. Haines bestows upon his observations, make them a fit term of comparison for all others. The introduction of these tables\n\nxi\n\nhas superseded the necessity of recording the variations of temperature observed by our party — they were principally noted by Mr. Seymour.\n\nIt may be proper, however, to state that, valuable as are the results contained in the meteorological tables, they can only be considered as approximations, because an uniform method of making observations has not yet been adopted. Those who are conversant with thermometrical observations know what influence the situation in which the instrument is exposed, and the materials of which it is constructed, exercise upon the results which it indicates, and how guarded we ought to be in adopting comparisons made with different instruments, and placed in different situations. Of the influence of the materials, the party had an opportunity of convincing themselves, by placing two of Mr. Keating's thermometers in the same situation with that of the surgeon at Fort St. Anthony. The latter instrument consisted of a glass tube attached to a brass plate, on which the graduation was marked. One of Mr. Keating's was known to be a good instrument; it had been made in Paris, and had its graduation on a slip of paper enclosed in a glass tube: the other thermometer was a small pocket one, made by Mr. Fisher, of Philadelphia, and was provided with an ivory plate. The usual exposure of the surgeon's thermometer was to the south-west: the two others\n\nxii\n\nwere placed near it. The results are indicated in the following table:\n\n..............................................Fisher's...........French.................Surgeon's.\n\nJuly 4th, at noon ..........................91°..............89° .......99° Fah.\n\nDo. at 3 o'clock P.M. .................96° ..............96° .......106° do.\n\nDo. at 8 do..................................78° ..............78°.......78° do.\n\nJuly 8th, at 4 do............................119°.............118°.....128° do.\n\nThis proved that when exposed to the direct rays of the sun, or to their reflection by the parade ground, the thermometer with the brass plate was uniformly ten degrees higher than that made entirely of glass, though at other times it stood at the same elevation. At the time these observations were made, the surgeon was absent.\n\nAt Fort St. Anthony, the thermometer was exposed to the south-west; at other posts we have seen it facing the east. Sometimes the instruments were protected from, at other times they were exposed to, the rays of the sun. There can be no doubt that some variations must arise from these causes; and we think it, therefore, desirable, in order to give the greatest value to the observations made at all the garrisons in the United States, that the surgeons should be provided at the public expense, with instruments of uniform and approved construction; and that the observations should be made under circumstances as nearly similar as the great diversity in the situations of these posts will admit. Notwithstanding the\n\nxiii\n\nvariations produced by the causes to which we have alluded, we consider these tables as being very interesting, inasmuch as they afford the first comparative results upon the United States in general; embracing an immense extent of country, and including great diversities of climate.\n\nWe deem it but justice to state, that the observations which Messrs. Say and Keating made concerning the manners, &c. of the Indian tribes which they met, were greatly assisted by the valuable notes, furnished to them by the American Philosophical Society, and which where chiefly prepared by Peter S. du Ponceau, Esq., one of the Vice-Presidents of the Society; Professor Robert Walsh, Jun., one of the Secretaries; and by Dr. Samuel Brown, Professor of the Practice of Physic in the Transylvania University.\n\nIn conclusion, the compiler has much pleasure in acknowledging the great obligations under which he lies to George Ord, Esq., one of the Vice-Presidents of the Academy of Natural Sciences, and one of the Secretaries of the American Philosophical Society, for his assistance in the preparation of this work. Mr. Ord's perusal of the greater part of the manuscript, previous to its being put to press, has preserved it from many of the inaccuracies which it would otherwise have contained.\n\nW. H. K.\n\n1\n\nNarrative of an Expedition to the Source of St. Peter's River, &c. &c. &c.\n\nCHAPTER I. Departure from Philadelphia. Geology of the Alleghanies. Cumberland Road. Wheeling.\n\nThe success which attended the expedition to the Rocky Mountains, and the important information which it imparted concerning the nature of the valley drained by the Missouri and its tributaries, of which nothing was known but what had been observed by Lewis and Clarke, induced the government of the United States to continue its endeavours to explore the unknown wilds within its limits. The first object which appeared to it deserving of investigation was the tract of country bounded by the Missouri, the Mississippi, and the Northern Boundary of the United States.\n\nThis triangular section includes about three hundred miles of longitude, and seven hundred of latitude. The late expedition, under the command of Governor Cass, had explored the southern shore of Lake Superior to the mouth of St. Louis river, and the water communication between Fond du Lac and the Mississippi, which river\n\n2\n\nhe ascended to the Upper Red Cedar or Cassina Lake, and then descended to the mouth of the Wisconsan. By this journey much light was thrown upon the history of the Upper Mississippi, which had been previously known only through the fascinating, but imperfect, and in many instances, fabulous accounts of old travellers, and through the hasty observations of the late General (then Lieut.) Pike, an officer whose zeal made him overlook difficulties which would have arrested a less hardy explorer, but who unfortunately was not provided with the means of making accurate observations.\n\nAll the later travellers who had visited the Upper Mississippi concurred in mentioning a river, discovered at the end of the 17th century, and known by the name of the St. Peter. This river, which empties itself into the Mississippi at a short distance below the Falls of St. Anthony, had not been visited by any traveller but Carver, whose account of it, published about the year 1778, contains many circumstances which might induce us to question the accuracy of his report.\n\nThe extent of the fur trade carried on by the British and American trading companies in that part of the country, the report of the easy communication between the head of the St. Peter and that of the Red River, whose waters running into Lake Winnepeek finally empty themselves into Hudson's Bay, and the various contradictory reports of the quality of the soil and the nature of the country on Red River, resulting from the conflicting interests of the two rival British companies, made it an object of interest to our government, to obtain correct information concerning the country which lies on the St. Peter and the Red River to the 49th parallel of north latitude, as well as to ascertain the\n\n3\n\nnature of the country along our, as yet unsurveyed, northern boundary.\n\nAccordingly, it was determined in the spring of 1823, by the Executive, \"that an expedition be immediately fitted out for exploring the river St.Peter's and the country situated on the northern boundary of the United States, between the Red River of Hudson's Bay and Lake Superior.\"\n\nThe command of the expedition was entrusted to Major S. H. Long, and he received orders from the War Department, dated April 25, 1823, of which the following is an extract: —\n\n\"The route of the expedition will be as follows: — commencing at Philadelphia, thence proceeding to Wheeling in Virginia, thence to Chicago via Fort Wayne, thence to Fort Armstrong on Dubuque's Lead Mines, thence up the Mississippi to Fort St. Anthony, thence to the source of the St. Peter's River, thence to the point of intersection between Red River and the forty-ninth degree of north latitude, thence along the northern boundary of the United States to Lake Superior, and thence homeward by the Lakes.\n\n\"The object of the expedition is to make a general survey of the country on the route pointed out, together with a topographical description of the same, to ascertain the latitude and longitude of all the remarkable points, to examine and describe its productions, animal, vegetable, and mineral; and to inquire into the character, customs, &c. of the Indian tribes inhabiting the same.\"\n\n4\n\nThe advanced state of the season admitting of no delay, the necessary preparations for the expedition were hastily made, and the party left Philadelphia on the 30th of April — consisting of STEPHEN H. LONG, Major United States' Topographical Engineers, commanding the Expedition — THOMAS SAY, Zoologist and Antiquary — WILLIAM H. KEATING, Mineralogist and Geologist — SAMUEL SEYMOUR, Landscape Painter and Designer. Messrs. SAY and KEATING were likewise appointed joint literary journalists to the expedition, and charged with the collecting of the requisite information concerning the names, numbers, manners, customs, &c. of the Indian tribes on the route.\n\n5\n\nThe party travelled in light carriages from Philadelphia to Wheeling, where they disposed of them and purchased horses in exchange. This part of the journey was performed in eleven days. The usual route through Lancaster, Columbia, York, and Gettysburgh, was travelled. Here they left the Pittsburgh turnpike-road and reached Hagerstown in Maryland by a cross road; from Hagerstown they continued along the Maryland turnpike-road to Cumberland, where it unites with the national road, upon which they travelled to Wheeling.\n\nFrom Philadelphia to Wheeling, the Geologist has an opportunity of observing almost every formation, from the old primitive to the coal strata. On leaving Philadelphia, the primitive soon disappears, and is replaced by the transition limestone, which is of a blue colour, very much intermixed with quartz in veins running through the mass. There are also patches of white limestone which are observed in sundry places, and which, being of a highly crystalline character, might almost induce us to rank this limestone as primitive.\n\nWe find occasionally breaking through the limestone, hills composed of amphibolic rocks; this accident is more frequent as we approach the Brandywine. These hills are very readily discernible from the undulations of the limestone country, by the difference in their outward form, which in the limestone hills is mammillay, constituting low and rounded swells; while the amphibolic hills are steep, and covered with a wilder vegetation. Beyond Lancaster, the rocks assume a slaty appearance, which increased as we approached the\n\n6\n\nSusquehannah. At Columbia we had an opportunity of observing the rock as it is laid bare in the bed of the river. It there appears to be the red sandstone, and is that mentioned by Mr. Maclure in his observations on the geology of the United States. It constitutes part of a red sandstone formation, which crosses through the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. This formation extends in a general northeasterly direction. The rock appears to be nearly horizontally stratified, but from the slight inclination which it presents to the north, the strata are presumed to extend in a north-east and south-west direction.\n\nThe limestone and red sandstone, with its accompanying red slate, alternately appear on the west side of the Susquehannah. The limestone is generally found in the valleys, and the sandstone upon the acclivities of the hills, which are generally crowned with small patches of trap. This rock occurs, however, only upon the higher hills, where it seems to have protected the sandstone from decomposition.\n\nOn approaching Millerstown, the country assumes a more broken appearance; the limestone ceases, and the indications of crystallization are visible in the rocks. Millerstown (sometimes called Fairfield) is situated on the eastern side of, and at no great distance from that ridge which is generally called the South mountain, and which may be considered as the most eastern of the parallel ridges, which constitute the great chain of the Alleghany mountains, at least in the southern part of Pennsylvania. In the vicinity of this place, there are masses of a calcareous breccia, in every respect similar to that found on the Potomac, and which has acquired of late a well-merited celebrity, on account of its having\n\n7\n\nbeen used for the beautiful columns which adorn the interior of the Capitol, in the City of Washington. This breccia, which is too well known to require description, consists of fragments of limestone of many kinds, differing in texture, colour, &c, all imbedded in a calcareous cement. Some of these fragments have a fine saccaroidal or subsaccaroidal grain, while others are compact. There are also fragments of white quartz intermixed with those of limestone. The breccia appears to form partial deposits in the coves or valley basins of that vicinity.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of this town there are numerous indications of the existence of large deposits of copper. The ores of this metal have been found in many places, and excavations were commenced as far back as the year 1798. Some of the ore obtained at this place was sent to England, where it is said to have been worked to advantage. An attempt was made last year to resume the operations, but with no great success. The want of a person qualified to determine as to the best spots at which to commence the excavations, may be considered as the principal obstacle existing at present to the success of these works. The ore hitherto extracted is not sufficiently rich to warrant works to any great extent, but some specimens which were analysed last year in Mr. Keating's laboratory in the University of Pennsylvania, yielded as much as thirty per cent. That the smelting of this ore could be made profitable, if a sufficiency of it were obtained, appears from the circumstance, that a ton of the ore which was sent to Centre county, to be reduced at one of the iron works, yielded about three hundred weight of metal.\n\n8\n\nThe ore discovered in this vicinity varies, but is for the most part a mixture of the oxidule, (red oxide,) with the green carbonate, the hydrate, the copper pyrites, the sulphuret of copper, and grey copper ore. The whole of it appears very much intermixed with siliceous matter. These masses of copper ore are in a talcose slate — they are to be observed every where. Doubts exist as to the manner in which they lie; the sides of the excavations had sunk in so much, at the time the party passed through, that it was not in their power to determine that question: from the information which was received, it would appear probable, that the ore has been worked, in one place at least, on a vein running nearly east and west. The rock, as has been observed, is a talcose slate, which in some places appears to be penetrated with copper pyrites. These mines all lie in a hill known by the name of Jack's mountain; upon the top of which a porphyritic rock occurs. The crystals are of felspar; the cement is of a red colour, and appears to be compact felspar, (petrosilex palaiopetre of de Saussure;) besides the crystals of felspar, there are some of quartz and probably of mica. This porphyry appears principally upon the east side of the mountain towards the top — no indications of stratification were observable. The porphyry constitutes probably a subordinate formation in the talcose slate which reappears on the crest of the hill, and is there very abundantly studded with small crystals, which are presumed to be epidote. In descending on the west side of Jack's mountain, the blue limestone reappears, very distinctly stratified, the strata running north-east and south-west; it dips in most places about 80° to the south-east. The dip varies, however, being only in\n\n9\n\nsome places about 30°, as may be very distinctly observed in the excavations made for cellars, &c. at Hagerstown.\n\nThis town is pleasantly situated in Washington county, Maryland, on the great turnpike road which leads from Baltimore to Cumberland. We saw here specimens of the white marble which occurs at Boonsborough, about ten miles south-cast of Hagerstown. It is said to exist there in considerable quantities on the west side of the South mountain, not far from its foot. It was at first mistaken for gypsum by the people of the neighbourhood, and very abundantly applied to manure their lands, and it was only after its inefficacy had been demonstrated by experience, that its true nature was ascertained. This marble is of the finest white, with a subsaccaroidal grain, and may become of great use in buildings; it is, however, too fine-grained for statuary purposes. An analysis of it was made with a view to ascertain its purity; it was found to consist entirely of carbonate of lime, with little or no foreign admixture. It certainly belongs to the primitive formation, and corroborates the opinion we had formed at Millerstown, that the primitive rocks reappear to the west of the red sandstone formation; a circumstance not noticed in the geological observations of Mr. Maclure. It is probable, however, that the appearance of the primitive here is but partial, and confined to certain localities, where it rises through the incumbent strata of transition rocks. There is an extensive cave or grotto in the blue limestone, about seven miles to the east of Hagerstown, which has not yet been fully explored.\n\nFrom Hagerstown to Cumberland the mountains are numerous, and the works which have been executed for\n\n10\n\nthe road have in many places laid the rock bare, so as to make its structure apparent. We there see a great variety in the nature of the rocks, all of which however are observed to belong to the transition or secondary; the former being observed near to Hagerstown, and passing gradually into the latter, which occur very distinctly in the vicinity of Cumberland. At first, the blue limestone, with a considerable, though varying, dip to the south-east, is seen gradually passing into a slaty rock, which finally predominates, and is a transition clay-slate, probably the Grauwacken-shiefer of German mineralogists. This however is found in parallel directions, alternating, as is believed, with this limestone, on a distance of several miles. After which, as we approach the North mountain, a sandstone of apparently very ancient formation, and which we feel inclined to refer to the red sandstone formation, occurs. It frequently acquires a reddish colour and, being in a great measure composed of quartz, assumes in some places the appearance of an eisenkiesel. Its stratification is very distinct, extending from north-east to south-west, and dipping to the northwest. This stratification is not visible on both sides of the mountain. The eastern slope being carried upon the crests of the strata, which are very brittle, a sort of soil is soon formed from the fragments of the rock, which entirely conceals it from view, but on the western slope it is very well marked. On the summit of the hill numberless fragments of trap rock are strewed in every direction. To the west of this ridge we again strike the clay-slate, which continues along the valley of the Potomac, being interrupted by the appearance of the blue limestone in the transverse valleys of the Big and Little Conolaway Creeks. This slate differs very much from\n\n11\n\nthat described above as constituting the North mountain. The latter is a quartzose, the former an argillaceous slate; and the difference of dip is sufficient to distinguish them.\n\nThis clay-slate is formed of alternate layers of a very schistose mass and a more compact one. The layers vary in thickness, many of them, however, not exceeding a few inches. In the more compact layers there are indications of a globular structure consisting of concentric shales.\n\nThe slate is soon succeeded by a sandstone, which constitutes several of the mountains known by the local appellations of the Sideling-hill, Town-hill, &c. It is not possible to determine with precision the spot at which the sandstone of coal formations commences, indeed we think it probable that no such limit exists in nature. The process may have continued without any marked interruption from the time at which the transition formations were produced, until the coal and its accompanying strata had commenced to be formed. We observe, in most cases, that the slate and reddish sandstone occupy the base of the higher mountains, and constitute the whole of the lower ones; while the crest of the high hills is formed of a sandstone which in every respect resembles that of the coal formations. There seems likewise to be a difference in the organic remains contained in these rocks, for in the lower ones there are only vegetable inpressions, (chiefly stems,) while in the superior strata, shells belonging to the genus Terabratula or Productus, are very frequently met with.\n\nWe had an opportunity of ascertaining that the slate which occupies the whole valley of the Potomac, in this\n\n12\n\ndistrict, varies in its dip; sometimes inclining to the south-east, and at other times to the north west. In one spot we observed the change in the dip produced by a very gentle undulation, without any disturbance or interruption of the stratification. Incumbent on this slate, is a limestone of a bluish colour, presenting signs of organic remains, and constituting Martin's Hill, which is one of the highest in the range. This limestone appears at first to be horizontally stratified, after which it assumes an inclined position, and on ascending becomes nearly vertical, while the top of the hill is crowned with large masses of limestone, quite free from stratification, and presenting only a very irregular division. Upon the summit of the mountain the limestone is cavernous, and contains many organic remains, among which the Terabratula and Productus are chiefly discernible. It is filled with veins of crystalline carbonate of lime, which in some places assumes regular forms.\n\nFrom Cumberland to Wheeling the geology of the country is much simplified. The coal formation predominates without any interruption. It consists merely of alternating strata of slate-clay, sandstone, limestone, and coal. Of these the sandstone is the most abundant; it is generally fine-grained, composed principally of fragments of quartz connected by a siliceous cement. In some cases there is much mica, and at times a little felspar, so as to constitute in local formations a regenerated granite, not unlike that observable in the coal basin of St. Etienne in France; but these are rather mineralogical curiosities, and can scarcely be considered as forming a feature in the geology of this part of the route. The stratification is nearly horizontal, and is very distinct wherever the slate-clay is found;\n\n13\n\nbut where this rock is deficient, the sandstone loses its stratified character, or at least ceases to present it in a distinct manner.\n\nThe sandstone frequently alternates with the slate-clay and it is not uncommon to observe a real passage of the one into the other; in some cases, as in the neighbourhood of Cumberland, the slate-clay is very rare.\n\nThe limestone is compact, of a greyish or brownish colour, very argillaceous, emitting a strong argillaceous odour when breathed upon; it occurs in parallel stratification with the above mentioned rocks, and exists very abundantly all over the country, where it may be seen in many places alternating with the other strata; but we know of none where this can be so well observed as on the west bank of the Monongahela, in the neighbourhood of Brownsville, in those places where the road has been dug into the hill.\n\nThe coal has not yet been found to the eastward of Cumberland, but west of this town it occurs almost everywhere; it is found in beds which vary in thickness from an inch to several, sometimes ten, feet. It appears that these beds extend over the whole country, for the same may be traced for miles without any sensible alteration in its appearance. There are various beds at different levels and of different qualities, and it is from this circumstance, probably, that the coal of one neighbourhood is considered preferable to that of another, because they work upon beds at different levels; yet it may be also that in some cases they work upon one and the same bed, the quality of which may he improved or impaired from accidental circumstances. Small excavations are made in numberless places, so as to answer the wants of the consumers. It is generally\n\n14\n\nobtained at the mouth of the pit for five dollars per hundred bushels, and is sometimes sold as low as four cents per bushel. In the town of Cumberland it usually sells for about ten dollars per hundred bushels.\n\nThe abundance of timber in that district, and the thinness of the population, have not yet rendered coal the exclusive fuel used, and it was not until we approached the vicinity of Wheeling that we found coal exclusively used in lime and brick kilns.\n\nThe most common disposition of the strata presents the sandstone as the lowest member of the formation; above it is the coal, which is itself covered by the slate, and the limestone covers the whole, and becomes itself a substratum for a superior bed of sandstone, &c.\n\nThe only substances of any importance which accompany these rocks, are iron pyrites, and probably the white pyrites. These minerals are so abundant through out the rocks, that they in many places produce a very rapid decomposition and destruction, that render them unfit for many uses of domestic economy; thus many of the beds of coal which would otherwise prove valuable, are so completely pervaded with pyrites that it is impossible to use them as fuel in private houses. This will probably ever prevent their being applied to metallurgical purposes. The pyrites not only penetrate the coal and its accompanying slate, but they extend even into the sandstone, to which they in many cases impart a tendency to decomposition, so great as to render it unfit for use as a building-stone. To the universal diffusion of this mineral we must attribute the circumstance that the country about Wheeling abounds in mineral springs, strongly charged with sulphates of iron and alumine. Indeed it is a matter of considerable\n\n15\n\nsurprise, that with such an abundance of vitriolic matter at hand, and with an inexhaustible store of coal in immediate contact with it, no attempt has yet been made to derive advantage from it, by converting it into green vitriol, alum, and sulphate of alumine. No doubt can be entertained of the facility with which this might be effected, and of the great advantage which would attend it. There is no place, we think, where chemical manufacturers of every kind could thrive to such advantage as at Wheeling. With coal mines even in the very heart of the town, with a constant and never-failing navigation, by means of which the products of its industry may be sent to a certain market, backed by a rich agricultural district to support the excess of its population, Wheeling seems destined to rise to a great affluence, becoming in a manner the emporium through which all the commerce between the east and west must pass.\n\nWe were much disappointed at not finding in the rocks as many organic impressions as we had expected; we could discover no shells in the rocks, though we have reason to believe that the limestone must in some places abound in them.\n\nIn the sandstone there are many vegetable impressions, apparently of palms. The vegetable matter has completely disappeared, leaving only an impression, which, although very distinct, was not sufficiently well characterised to allow a determination of its nature. This sandstone is of a greyish colour, middling-sized grain, and appears to be very micacious in some parts, while in others it consists of quartz nearly pure. The impressions are not very large, seldom more than ten or\n\n16\n\ntwelve inches long, and lie parallel to the stratification of the rock. At the hill over which the national road passes, in the immediate vicinity of Wheeling, the sandstone is about fifty or sixty feet in height, divided into layers of variable thickness: over this is a stratum of coal, eight feet thick. In this coal, as well as in the accompanying slate, there are many remains of vegetables converted into pure charcoal, and entirely free from bitumen. These, though numerous, are too imperfect to allow of determining the species to which they belong. This bed, as well as the other parallel ones, when not too much intermixed with pyrites, is worked by galleries running into the hill. The works are very carelessly carried on and the waste of coal is great. The propping is very rough and unsafe; frequent accidents occur from this circumstance. The ventilation is not understood, and many works have been abandoned from the foulness of the air, no attempt being made to correct it. No inconvenience has as yet been experienced from the inflammable gases; but the carbonic acid and the gaseous oxide of carbon are very abundant.\n\nThis bed of coal is separated from a superior one by a bed of slate-clay of about three feet in thickness, which from its unsoundness is always worked at the same time as the upper and lower beds of coal; although the upper coal be but six or eight inches thick and of a very inferior quality; but in this manner a safer roof is obtained for the excavation.\n\nThe limestone is considerably affected by the pyrites, and being in some places, as we were informed, magnesian, it gives rise to sulphate of magnesia, which might also probably be worked to advantage. The pyritous\n\n17\n\nbeds of limestone are only such as come into contact with the coal, the superior strata are said to be quite free from it.\n\nThe only circumstance worth mentioning concerning the coal mines is, that they have frequently been on fire, and that there are many indications of conflagrations at a remote period, probably caused by the spreading of the fires lighted at the surface by the Indians, to facilitate their hunting. From these conflagrations the slate is, in many places, observed to be quite altered in its appearance, so as to resemble porcelain jasper in its characters.\n\nNo iron ore has been found in this neighbourhood, and we looked in vain for indications of the argillaceous carbonate of iron, so usually to be met with in coal fields. We were informed that, at some distance from the town, large quantities of iron ore had been discovered, but which, from the characters ascribed to it, we were induced to believe were not the argillaceous carbonate, but the oxide and hydrate of iron.\n\nHaving thus presented in one connected view the various geological observations which were made on this part of the route, we return to notice the other interesting circumstances which attracted the attention of our party.\n\nThe route which we travelled is far more interesting to the general observer than that to Pittsburgh; the country along the Potomac offers many very fine views, among which none is more remarkable than that from Sideling-hill. The ranges of mountains, as they then present themselves, strike the traveller in the most favourable manner. The freshness of the vegetation is peculiarly grateful to the eye in the commencement of\n\n18\n\nMay, and contrasts beautifully with the deep blue of the distant mountains. At times the road winds along the valley; and again it crosses the ridges, offering the greatest variety of scenery, and affording to the artist many views worthy of his pencil; for while the bottoms abound in rich and smiling prospects, the mountainous parts arrest the attention by their bold and gigantic features, and by the antique forests which cover them.\n\nThe season in which we commenced our journey was not very favourable to the proper display of vegetation: the frost had not yet disappeared in the mountainous districts, and the very heavy rains, which had fallen in great abundance this spring, had retarded all the products of the earth to an unusual degree; but the fine blossoms of the dogwood-tree (Cornus florida), which every where met the eye, amply compensated the want of other flowers.\n\nArt has done little to add to the charms of the natural scenery, except in the construction of a road. The question of the propriety of opening, at the national expense, a communication between the Ohio and Potomac, had been so much the subject of discussion, as to make us desirous of observing the mode in which it had been executed, and the too favourable idea, which we are, perhaps, always led to form, of what carries with it a national character, together with an account of the immense expenditure incurred in the making of this road, had prepared us for a magnificent work. We were therefore somewhat disappointed at the state in which we found it, as it is very inferior in execution to the Maryland-road, which connects with it. There is in the whole of the national road but little to justify the high eulogiums which have been passed upon it. The\n\n19\n\nimmense expense, amounting to nearly two millions of dollars (Sp. D. 1,995,000), which has attended its construction, can only be accounted for by a reference to the difficulty of making a road across high and steep ridges, which perhaps had not been sufficiently explored, to ascertain the lowest levels and the most accessible points; and, as we think, to the injudicious manner in which the original contracts were given out. We were credibly informed, that in most cases the original undertakers did nothing themselves, but portioned out their contracts to a second set of contractors, and in some cases it happened that the third or fourth set alone performed the work, the other contractors sweeping away immense sums without any labour. Had the route been properly divided into small lots, and these given only to such as were really qualified to execute the work, no doubt can exist that a considerable saving would have been obtained. The letting of it out into large sections had the disadvantage of making it an object of speculation, and of alarming many who would otherwise have offered themselves as contractors.\n\nAnother cause of the great expense which attended it, was the location of its western end in the valley of Wheeling creek, instead of carrying it over the high land. Some difference, of opinion exists in the country as to the propriety of this selection. We were informed by many, that this location had been made, rather with a view to benefit private interests, than with a careful regard for the public good. Certain it is, that the number of bridges which were required in the route through the valley, added very considerably to the\n\n20\n\nexpense of the road. There are no less than seventeen bridges over the main creek, within thirteen miles of this valley road. It is but justice to observe, that the bridges are, for the most part, substantial, well-built, and even elegant in their construction. A circumstance which enhanced much the expense of the valley road, was the necessity of propping it in many places by a stone wall or parapet, amounting in the aggregate to at least one-fourth or one-third of the distance. The road has, however, along this route, the advantage of being carried almost on a dead level, and in other parts, where it crosses the mountains, it must be acknowledged that the ascents are better regulated than on any other road we have ever travelled. But a great defect which prevails throughout the whole route, and which we had not expected to meet with, is that of using stones of too large a diameter on the road. After all the improvements which have been, of late years, made in this important\n\n21\n\nbranch of engineering, and after the very just celebrity which the M'Adams' roads have obtained in England, we had hoped that the suggestions of this able engineer on this subject would have been more closely adhered to. Whatever may have been the defects or the mistakes which attended the location or execution, no doubt can exist as to the importance of the work itself, or as to the soundness of the policy which led to it. By the opening of it, the nation has gained a great deal; it has ascertained the practicability and the expediency of entering largely upon a system of internal improvements, the necessary consequence of which must be, to unite by closer bonds the distant parts of our vast country; and of all improvements, none can be more important, than such as tend to connect the waters of the Gulf of Mexico with those of the Atlantic. Immediately allied to this subject, is the possibility of making a water communication between the Ohio and Potomac. At a time when, by a broad and liberal policy, the executive of the United States has been authorized to apply to the consideration of this important object the united talents of the civil and military engineers of our country, and when a full and able report upon the practicability of this connexion may be expected from those most competent to decide upon it, we shall be excused from embodying here the imperfect information which a transient visit through the country has allowed us to collect.\n\nWe found some interest in that part of the route which lies near Smithfield, as being the scene of some of General Washington's earliest military operations. The ruins of Fort Necessity, constructed at that distressing season when the French troops, with their savage allies, extended themselves along the banks of the Ohio, and oppressed\n\n22\n\nour frontier settlements, are still to be seen in what are called the Big Meadows, about fifty miles west of Cumberland. This fort was erected in the year 1754, and after having been defended with great valour, was surrendered in the campaign which preceded Braddock's defeat (Marshall's Life of Washington, vol. ii, p. 9), and the remains of it, still to be traced, show that the ditch was inside of the embankment, which comports better with Indian warfare. The fort stands about a quarter of a mile to the south-west of the road, and it is difficult to trace its outline, but from the observations we made it would appear as if it had been triangular, and scarcely one hundred feet in length. It is said that when\n\n23\n\nWashington first entered it his force amounted to six hundred men, but that having advanced on his march towards Fort Duquesne, he was abandoned by a considerable proportion of his men; and this circumstance, together with the information which he received, that the French were advancing against him with reinforcements, obliged him to abandon for the time his contemplated march, and to return to Fort Necessity, which he was engaged in repairing when the enemy made his appearance. The country in the vicinity was probably at that time destitute of timber, the growth upon it not being very large. A fine brook which flows near it, has retained the name of the unfortunate general, who, in the ensuing campaign, paid for his rashness by the loss of his life. Indeed, it is said, that the remains of General Brad-dock were interred within two miles of this fort, near the old road called Braddock's road, and at the spot where he died, during the retreat which closed this disastrous campaign.\n\nIn this vicinity there is a blowing spring, which is situated in an excavation on the side of a hill. The stream of air, which issues from a crack or crevice in the rock, is very considerable, and sufficiently powerful to extinguish a candle. By placing our ears near the crevice, we heard very distinctly the sound of water running under ground, probable upon a rocky and unequal bed; it runs out at a short distance lower down. This stream of air is doubtless produced by the same cause, which is made to operate in the construction of the water blasts, used in metallurgy. We had no means of collecting and examining the gas which escapes, but we had no reason to believe it other than atmospheric air.\n\n24\n\nThis section of our route does not offer to the zoologist much subject of observation. The wild animals which formerly roved over this part of our country have been driven further west, or completely cut off by the advance of civilization, and the domestic animals which now occupy their place have nothing to characterize them. We cannot, however, omit noticing the extraordinary size and strength of the Pennsylvania waggon horse, which yields in these particulars to but few breeds. There are several appellations by which the different breeds of this useful animal are distinguished in Pennsylvania, such as the Conestoga, the Chester line, &c. but these are principally of a local import. The usual height of farm and waggon horses is about sixteen hands, or five feet four inches, measured according to the usual custom. We were credibly informed that horses, seventeen, seventeen and a half, and even eighteen hands high, are by no means rare. A few have been known to exceed that size; and we were told that one, the largest ever known in the country, had attained the gigantic size of nineteen hands, or six feet four inches. As a proof of the great strength which they sometimes attain, it is said that an experiment was once tried in the city of Lancaster, which resulted in a single horse's dragging around the court-house, on the bare pavements, without the intervention of wheels or rollers, two tons of bar iron, which had been bundled together for this experiment.\n\nThe town of Wheeling appears to be in a flourishing condition, and the increase in its population has been very great, since the completion of the national road. Business has taken a new direction; instead of centring\n\n25\n\nas it formerly did in Pittsburgh, it now goes principally to Wheeling, which has the advantage of a much more permanent navigation all the year round. The population amounts at present to upwards of two thousand. The situation of the town is pleasant; the river here is about five hundred yards wide; and there is opposite to the town a large and beautiful island, nearly three quarters of a mile wide. The town is divided into the old and the new; the former is built upon a narrow bank, which extends between the river and the ridge of hills on the eastern shore; the new town is built a little below the old, on the river, and has a wider field to expand upon, owing to the junction of the lateral valley of Wheeling creek with that of the river. We regretted to find brick resorted to as a building material, not only in the construction of private houses, but even of churches and other public edifices, while a beautiful sandstone, admirably adapted to the purposes of architecture, and which might be obtained at a very low price, remains unwrought.\n\nThe weather was so unfavourable during the three days that we remained here, as to preclude the possibility of ascertaining by astronomical observations the latitude and longitude of this town.\n\nIn our walks along the banks of the river, which are covered with a vast deposite of alluvium, and which present, in this vicinity at least, no section of rocks, we were struck with the immense number of pebbles partaking of the nature of primitive rocks, which are strewed along the surface of the ground. They are not, it is true, of a large size, and their smooth and rounded surfaces attest that they have travelled far from their native sites. In examining our imperfect geological\n\n26\n\nmaps to endeavour to assign to them an origin, we feel at a loss to decide whence they may have been brought. We find no primitive formations nearer than those on the north side of our great lakes, which, from the aspect of the country, may be supposed to have given rise by their destruction to these extensive alluvia of primitive débris. Among these pebbles, chiefly of granite, gneiss, sienite, &c. we observed a rock formed of felspar, quartz, and handsome crystals of translucent garnets, which appear to be very abundantly disseminated throughout the rock.\n\nThere is in Wheeling a glass-house, which we visited; the glass made here is very good; the sand which they use is brought down from the banks of the Alleghany, and appears to consist of silex nearly pure; the alkali added is principally unwashed ashes. We were somewhat surprised at hearing, that the clay used in the manufacture of their crucibles was brought from Germany, indeed we consider this very improbable, as a clay very well adapted to this purpose is found in many parts of the country. The atmosphere in the glass-house was extremely foul, owing to the sulphurous vapours disengaged from the coal.\n\nThe hills in the neighbourhood of the town are covered with masses of clay, sand, &c. which, as soon as they become penetrated with moisture, slide along the\n\n27\n\nupper surface of the rocks, even where their inclination is but small. This feature is observable only on the northern slopes, the southern are much more abrupt. We were at first induced to attribute it to the effect of the winter frosts, but Colonel M'Ree, who has examined its appearance with care, attributes it principally to the action of moisture.\n\n28\n\nChapter II.\n\nZanesville. Salt and Iron Works. Columbus. Piqua. Indian Antiquities. Ohio Canals. Fort Wayne.\n\nHAVING spent three days in Wheeling, and changed our mode of conveyance, in order to accommodate ourselves to the state of the roads/rendered almost impassable for carriages by the unusual quantity of rain which had fallen this spring, we crossed the Ohio in a team-boat, propelled by two horses. The river is here divided into two branches by the aforementioned island, which is about three quarters of a mile wide; over the first branch of the river a team-boat plies constantly, and corresponds with a common ferry-boat on the other branch. The Ohio road is carried along the valley of a rivulet called Indian Wheeling, and is rendered extremely unpleasant to travel, by the frequent crossings of that brook. It was, however, so bad at that season of the year, that many preferred travelling up the bed of the creek to following the road. It has been observed by all travellers, that the Ohio runs in a valley, the average breadth of which does not exceed a mile and a half, the sides being lined by ranges of hills, which are generally termed the River Mountains; these vary considerably in height, generally ranging between three hundred and five hundred feet. After these are ascended, the country is rough, but the hills comparatively small. These are, however, very steep, probably owing to the nature of the stratification, which is horizontal throughout the\n\n29\n\ncountry; for it is a fact, which general observation confirms that those hills which are composed of rocks horizontally stratified, are generally steepest in their ascents, and present a tabular form at their summit. The coal formation of Wheeling is very extensive; the exact limits of this coal basin have not yet been traced with accuracy, but, as far as we are able to judge from the information, obtained upon a country as yet but thinly settled, and in which the natural sciences have been little attended to, it would appear that it probably reaches as far to the north-east as Lawrenceville, in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, and perhaps may be considered as connected with that lately discovered in Tioga County (New York), near the head of Seneca Lake. The coal found in that place is, as we were informed, abundant, of an excellent quality, and well characterized as bituminous. The eastern limit may be taken to be formed by the main ridge of the Alleghany Mountains. Its western and southern limits we are not prepared to decide upon, but it is probable that its breadth bears but a small proportion to its length.\n\nAt Zanesville we had an opportunity to observe the geological features of the country to advantage. The bed of the Muskingum is deeply incased, and the stratification is laid bare for a considerable distance. It there presents the same features as in the vicinity of Wheeling, but the order of stratification and the character of the rocks are somewhat different.\n\nA very fine break presents the following section: commencing at the lowest rocks, there is a sandstone of a tolerably coarse grain, filled with remains of vegetable substances converted into charcoal, in some cases Partaking of a bituminous character, so that a gradual\n\n30\n\nand invisible, but certain transition from the charcoal to coal manifestly takes place. These remains are, however, as far as we saw them, so much impaired, as to make it impossible to assign to them any particular place in fossil botany, though of their vegetable origin no doubt can exist. In remarking upon their position, we ascertained, that they generally lay in the direction of the stratification, very seldom intersecting it. Besides fragments of charcoal and coal, we found impressions of plants, some of which were tolerably well characterized. In one instance a phyllolithos (Martin) was collected in a very good state of preservation.\n\nThe sandstone in a few cases assumes a somewhat micaceous appearance, consequently a more slaty structure, and thence resembles that hereafter to be noticed. The rock immediately superincumbent is presumed to be a bed of clay-slate; though the junction being concealed, and the relative positions of the rock being only judged of by the general level of the country, it was not in our power to decide in a positive manner whether or not there were any other strata interposed between these two.\n\nThis clay-slate is very brittle, and easily divisible; on exposure to the atmosphere it very readily crumbles, and lays open to view concentric globules of argillaceous carbonate of iron, in every respect similar to those observed in other coal formations.\n\nThe iron ore is found in rounded or oval masses, somewhat flattened in the direction of the stratification; it appears to be quite abundant, and we doubt not, if made the object of exploration, would be found sufficiently so to justify the erection of iron works on a large scale.\n\n31\n\nResting upon the slate-clay, we observed a bed several feet in thickness, composed of a dark grey limestone very compact in texture, but presenting at the same time a slaty structure, and divisible in layers parallel to the stratification. This limestone is replete with organic remains, chiefly belonging to the Encrinite, Terebratula, Productus, &c. among which we also found a shell belonging to the genus Trochus or Turbo. These shells are very abundant in the rock; they are found, as far as we could judge, irregularly disseminated, and adhering so closely that it is impossible to separate them, or to divide the mass into specimens which shall exhibit their characters uninjured; but being for the most part formed of calcspar, they resist decomposition better than the compact limestone, in which they are imbedded, and from this circumstance the best specimens are found protruding from the weathered surfaces of the rock.\n\nThis bed offered great interest to the two naturalists of the expedition, to the one as zoologist, to the other as geologist. Mr. Say thought he beheld in it the confirmation of an opinion which he had long entertained, that, of all fossils, the Encrinus is that which resists decomposition best. Without pretending to dispute the correctness of the observation, as a general one, Mr. Keating thought the present instance did not confirm it, and that there were many spots where the bivalves (Terebratula and Productus) indicated a greater degree of hardness and solidity, by resisting the effects of the weather better than the Encrini. This we notice as being perhaps the only time that the two naturalists differed in their observations on the same fact, when coming under the notice of both.\n\n32\n\nUpon this limestone lay a bed of coal, of about two feet in thickness, and apparently of a very good quality. Some works of no great amount were undertaken here not long since, which are unattended to at present. We were told, however, that in other parts of the country this coal is worked to advantage. Coal is the usual fuel in the town, being worth from four to six cents per bushel.\n\nIt is covered by a bed of slaty rock, which in some cases assumes a decided appearance of slate-clay, and in other points runs into a micaceous sandstone, not unlike the micaceous parts of that noticed as the lowest stratum visible in this vicinity, and like the former it is filled with vegetable impressions of a very undecided character.\n\nOver this slaty rock another bed of limestone occurs, the characters of which, resembling in every respect those of the stratum under the coal, require no further description. The superior bed, as well as the inferior one, is rich in impressions of Encrinites, Terebratula, Productus, &c. which shells retain their pearly lustre, and even in some cases their animal matter.\n\nThe limestone is covered with a fine vegetable mould, and affords a rich soil, not inferior to any of the limestone bottoms of Pennsylvania. We had no means of ascertaining what rocks lay below the first bed of sandstone observed in this break, but from what we could discover in the bed of the canal now digging in the neighbourhood of this town, we believe it to rest upon a sandstone, in every respect similar to that described in the first chapter, as existing in the neighbourhood of Wheeling, and we have every reason to believe that the same alteration of strata which exists there, would be\n\n33\n\nfound in like manner here, and that if shafts were sunk, inferior strata of coal might be reached.\n\nZanesville is a pleasant and flourishing town, situated at the junction of the Licking creek, and Muskingum, about ninety miles above the confluence of the Muskingum and Ohio. As a manufacturing town it possesses great advantages. A dam built across the two streams, a short distance above their junction, gives it a command of water power which is calculated to set in motion very extensive mills and manufactories. It was the observation of these natural advantages, that induced the late Mr. Zane to fix upon it as a seat for a town, and the rapid growth of the place has raised it to a rank among the most thriving towns in the state of Ohio. A number of manufactories have already been established here, which appear to be conducted with spirit and enterprize; among these a manufactory of cut nails belonging to Mr. Reeves deserves notice. The iron for the manufactory is prepared by him from the pigs by the process of puddling and rolling. Glasshouses, in which both green and white glass are made, exist here; it is said that the clay from which they\n\n34\n\nmake their crucibles, and which is found at a short distance from the town, is excellent. Within four miles of Zanesville, on Licking creek, there is a furnace at which an hydrated oxide of iron is worked. The difference in the price between cast iron and pigs is so great as to enable them to convert the whole of their produce into hollow ware, which is readily disposed of at seventy dollars, while the pigs command only thirty dollars a ton. Bar iron, and that not of the best quality, is sold for one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The little iron, refined in this vicinity, is generally of an inferior character. The experiment of manufacturing the iron by rolling, as is done at Reeves' establishment, has not been attended with sufficient success to lead to a more general introduction of this process. We conversed with several intelligent iron masters on the subject, with a view to obtain accurate information on the advantages of this method over that of hammering, the result of which was, that the product obtained from rollers was not so uniformly good as that obtained by hammering, which, in the opinion of our informants, was owing rather to the defect of the workmen than of the process. The management of rollers is probably not well understood by them. We have taken occasion to record this information, because it appears to us that every thing that can throw a light upon the manufacture of iron is interesting. We consider the question of the propriety of using rollers as a highly important one, and as one not yet settled. We know that a strong prejudice exists in this country against the rolled iron, and that the results of experiments made in Pennsylvania are rather unfavourable; but we likewise know, that the process is very extensively carried on in England,\n\n35\n\nwhere it has met with a decided preference in many instances; and the economy which attends it, must make it very desirable that it should prove successful. Experience shows that all innovations in the arts meet with objections; and the failure of those who attempt to repeat them without proper care or knowledge, is not unfrequently attributed to the imperfections of the process, instead of being charged to the inexperience of the operators.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact, that, with the admitted superiority of the British over American castings, no attempts have been made to work the same ore, and by means of the same fuel, which have proved so successful when used abroad. It is a truth, with which every person who feels an interest on this subject is conversant, that the clay ironstone is the principal ore used in England; that it is smelted by means of coke; that the products are extremely advantageous; that results equally favourable, if not more so, have been obtained in Silesia from the same ores; and that experiments which have been made on the same subject in France, have been attended with the happiest results. We may therefore wonder, that so much of this valuable ore is allowed to remain unwrought, in the midst of the very fuel which ought to be used to smelt it; and that a preference should be given to the hydrates and oxides of iron, worked with charcoal, very frequently to great disadvantage.\n\nThe furnace which we visited near Zanesville was built in 1809, and was, as we were told, the first erected in the state of Ohio; its inside is lined with fire-bricks, wade of the clay which is used for crucibles in the glass house; and the proprietors informed us that it was their\n\n36\n\nintention to make large bricks of the same materials for their hearths, as all the stones they had heretofore used had proved defective, and had obliged them to suspend their operations under a year's blast, at a time when the rest of the furnace was in a very sound state. This experiment, if successful, will be attended with great advantages to the country. The clay has been analyzed in Mr. Keating's laboratory in the University of Pennsylvania, and found to contain about seventy-two percent, of silex, with alumine, little or no lime, and no metallic oxide.\n\nThe iron ore used here is a hydrated oxide, which yields in castings about thirty-three per cent. It smelts very readily of itself, requiring but a slight addition of about three per cent, of limestone. Among the great improvements which have been made at this place, is the connexion formed, by means of a canal with locks, between the upper and lower level of the Muskingum. The company who erected the dam were bound by their charter to keep a lock navigation in repair, and their improvements, which have removed all obstacles to the navigation, will doubtless prove very valuable, as they have afforded them a very extensive water-power. Salt was some time since obtained at Zanesville, and all along, the Muskingum; but of late the works here have been abandoned, the springs being too weak. It appears that those below are very productive; it is calculated that one hundred gallons of water from these will generally yield about a bushel of salt, weighing fifty pounds; hence the water must contain upwards of six percent, of salt. The establishments, as they are generally made in this country, contain twenty kettles of the capacity of ninety gallons each, costing together\n\n37\n\nabout seven hundred dollars; of these kettles or pans, fourteen are used for evaporating and six for crystallizing the salt. During the evaporation a sediment is formed, which is supposed by some to consist of loam and lime; no experiments have as yet been made to ascertain its nature. No use has ever been made of it; but it would doubtless prove very valuable in agriculture. The depth to which they bore varies much; it is generally about two hundred feet. In some cases the auger-holes, which are about three inches in diameter, have been sunk to seven hundred feet. The expense of course varies according to the depth, but the work is generally undertaken at from one dollar and fifty cents to two dollars per foot. In one instance, where the boring extended to upwards of one hundred feet, it was performed for seventy-five cents per foot. The whole capital required to put up salt-works in this neighbourhood is estimated at four thousand five hundred dollars; and when the work is prudently conducted, the business is considered very good; though the price of salt is at present very low.\n\nIt was in boring for coal, a few years since, that a deception was practised, which made considerable noise in the country, and produced much mischief in Zanesville and its vicinity. It appears well ascertained, at present, that the silver said to have been found in one of the auger-holes bored on the banks of the river, had been thrown in by some evil-minded persons. The pretended discovery induced many to speculate largely upon the mine, before the detection of the plot, whence they incurred great losses; this event occurred in the year 1819.\n\nThe banks of the river are strewed with vast numbers\n\n38\n\nof pebbles, much rolled, and evidently carried from a great distance. They consist principally of quartz, in some cases hyaline, in others partaking of the nature of jasper, agate, semiopal, &c.; fragments of granitic and amphibolic rocks are also to be met with here and there. Specimens of petrified Retipore and Favosites striata, Say, and of a new genus of the Polypiers lamelliferes of Lamarck, were also observed on the shore. These petrifactions are siliceous and rolled, and bear the appearance of having been removed far from their original situation. Specimens of the Favosites striata are also common in this vicinity.\n\nWe observed near the bank of the river a considerable accumulation of common flint (quartz silex), which consisted of irregularly shaped blocks of silex, apparently nodules, which had been imbedded in a rock, in the manner in which the same substance lies in the chalk of the neighbourhood of Paris; its colour is black. Upon inquiry, we were informed that these blocks are gathered from the fields, where they are found loose and scattered; they do not carry with them the appearance of much attrition. They are used in the glass-houses in the preparation of fine white glass.\n\nAmong the features which strike the traveller, as he contemplates the scenery of Muskingum, none contribute more to give a character of originality to the landscape, than a rude bridge thrown across the river, in which the architect has contrived to connect three forks or arms, one of which reaches to the cape formed by the junction of the Muskingum and Licking creek, while the other two establish a connexion between the\n\n39\n\nopposite banks of the Muskingum, below the junction of the two streams. This presents an uncouth mass, contrasting well with the magnificence of the scenery. The bridge appears destitute of solidity, and will probably be soon replaced by a more elegant and permanent one. It is thus that the rude works of the first settlers in the west are disappearing gradually, and making way for the more improved structures of civilized life.\n\nHaving remained half a day in Zanesville, we continued our journey towards Columbus, which we reached on the 19th. The route between these two places offered us but little interest; to the mineralogist it presents none at all, being level, flat, and covered with an alluvium. We were informed that coal had been observed in many places, but in no instance of a quality to warrant its extraction; and that no where had it been worked beyond five miles west of the Muskingum. Our road, which led us through the valley of Licking creek, was very even. The rocks were always concealed from view, except in one or two places, where abrupt cliffs rose at too great a distance from the road to permit us to decide upon their nature; but their general aspect appeared to connect them with those observed in the vicinity of Zanesville.\n\nOur attention was, however, soon directed in another channel. The country about the Muskingum appears to have been at a former period the seat of a very extensive aboriginal population. Every where do we observe, in this valley, remains of works which attest, at the same time, the number, the genius, and the perseverance of those departed nations. Their works have survived the lapse of ages; but the spirit which prompted\n\n40\n\nthem has disappeared. We wander over the face of the country; wherever we go, we mark the monuments which they have erected; we would interrogate them as to the authors of these mighty works, but no voice replies to ours, save that of the echo. The mind seeks in vain for some clew to assist it in unravelling the mystery. Was their industry stimulated by the desire of protecting themselves against the inroads of invaders, or were they themselves the trespassers? Did they migrate to this spot, and if so, whence came they? who were they? whither went they? and wherefore came they here? Their works have been torn open; they have been searched into, but all in vain. The mound is now levelled with the sod of the valley; the accumulated earth, which was perhaps collected from a distance into one immense mass to erect a monument deemed indestructible, over the remains of some western Pharaoh, is now scattered over the ground, that its concealed treasure may be brought to light. Every bone is accurately examined, every piece of metal or fragment of broken pottery is curiously studied, still no light has as yet been thrown upon the name and date of the once populous nation which formerly nourished on the banks of the numerous tributary streams of the Ohio.\n\nSuch were the reflexions suggested to us by our visit to the numerous mounds and Indian works which abound in this part of the country, the first of which we observed in the small village of Irville, situated eleven miles west of Zanesville. This mound was about fifteen feet in diameter, and four and a half in height; it appears to have had an elliptic basis. Our guide told us, that he was present when it was opened, and that there were a number of human bones, and among others a tolerably\n\n41\n\nentire skeleton, which lay with its head to the north-west; the arms were thrown back over the head. Besides the bones, there were numerous spear and arrow points, and of the latter we picked up one on the spot. There was also a plate of copper of the length of the hand, and from five to six inches in width; it was rolled up at the sides, and had two holes near the centre; its weight, we were told, might have been about a quarter of a pound, but it was probably greater: for it must have been very thin, if, with these dimensions, it weighed so little. What could have been the use of it, except as an ornament, was not determined; indeed, the inhabitants of that part of the country are so much accustomed to dig up bones, and remains of the Aborigines, that they are very careless about observing or recording the objects found, and the circumstances under which they were discovered. We were told that pieces of copper, and even of brass, had been frequently collected. The copper may easily be accounted for, without a reference to a higher degree of civilization, or to an intercourse with nations more advanced in the arts. The existence of native copper, strewed upon the surface of the ground in many places, will easily account for the circumstance of its being used by the natives as an ornament, in the same manner as the Copper Indians of the north have been known, from the earliest days of their discovery by white men, to adorn their persons with it: but we cannot account for the discovery of ornaments of brass, unless we admit an intercourse with nations that had advanced in civilization. The existence, therefore, of fragments of this alloy in mounds, appears to us doubtful; for, if true, the Indians who constructed them must have been much more refined than we can suppose they were; or they\n\n42\n\nmust have had intercourse with civilized nations. The erection of these mounds, which appear to be in a great measure contemporary, was certainly much anterior to the discovery of this continent in the fifteenth century; and, therefore, it is not from Europeans that these pieces of brass were obtained, if, again we repeat it, they have been found in these works.\n\nBesides this mound, there are many others in the immediate vicinity of Irville, some of which are of very great dimensions. We observed one, near the road, which had been but recently excavated at its summit; it was perhaps thirty-five or forty feet high. These mounds were for the most part overgrown with bushes; and from the scattered and irregular manner in which they lie, we could discover no order or plan in their relative positions; it does not appear that they were intended to be connected with any work of defence, but it is more probable that they were erected as mausoleums, and that the difference in their size was intended to convey an idea of difference in the relative importance of those whose bones they covered. We were informed that this valley and the neighbouring hills abound in excavations resembling wells; we met with none of these; they are said to be very numerous, and are generally attributed to the first French adventurers, who, being constantly intent upon the search after the precious metals, commenced digging wherever they observed a favourable indication. Not haying seen any of these, we could not pretend to express an opinion upon their origin; but, from the number in which they are represented to be, as well as from their dimensions, they appear to us far exceeding the abilities of those to whom they are attributed, and to have required a much more numerous\n\n43\n\nand permanent population than these adventurers are Known to have brought over with them. We would, therefore, prefer the opinion which ascribes them to the same nations that erected the mounds, and who may have sunk these wells, either for purposes of self-defence, according to the usual mode of Indian warfare, or as habitations, in the manner known to be practised by some Indian tribes (vide Harmon's description of the Carriers), or finally, for some other cause as yet undiscovered. Their great depth, which is said at this time in many cases to exceed twenty feet, may be considered as an objection to the opinion which we have advanced. The supposition of Mr. Atwater, that these wells, which he states to be at least a thousand in number, were opened for the mere purpose of extracting rock crystal and hornstone, appears to us too refined; whatever may have been the advances of these nations in civilization, we have no reason to believe that they had carried them so far as to be induced to undertake immense mining operations, for the mere purpose of obtaining these articles (ArchÄologia Americana, vol. i. p. 130.)\n\nNewark is a pleasant little town, situated at the fork of Licking and Raccoon creeks, about twenty-five miles from Zanesville. Within a short distance of it are some very fine remains of Indian works, which we missed seeing, having been misinformed as to their real position; but we had less cause to regret this, as an excellent description of them has been published by Mr. Caleb Atwater. From his account of them, it would appear that these works must have covered several miles of country, and that they were perhaps connected with other works,\n\n44\n\nsituated at a distance, by parallel walls extending over a space of thirty miles. Of the labour bestowed upon them, an idea can be formed from the circumstance, that among these works there \"is a circular fort, containing about twenty-six acres, having a wall around it, formed by the ground which was thrown out of a deep ditch on the inner side of the wall; this wall is now from twenty-five to thirty feet in height.\" (ArchÄol. Am. i. 127.)\n\nIn the vicinity of Newark we observed an orchard every tree of which was propped, having, as we were told, suffered much from a violent south-westerly gale on Easter Sunday of this year. The fact would not have appeared to us worthy of notice, but for the observation that this gale of wind, which was felt very extensively throughout the country, was observed to have a different direction in different places; at Philadelphia it is known to have been from the north-east. It may be a question, whether these two gales were in any manner connected, and, if so, why they happened to proceed from different directions.\n\nAt Newark the party fell in with Captain John Cleves Symes, a man whose eccentric views on the nature of the globe have acquired for him, not only in America, but also in England, a temporary reputation. The partial insanity of this man is of a singular nature: it has caused him to pervert, to the support of an evidently absurd theory, all the facts, which, by close study, he has been enabled to collect from a vast number of authorities. He appears conversant with every work of travels, from Hearne's to Humboldt's; and there is not a fact to be found in these which he does not manage, with considerable ingenuity, to bring to the support of his favourite theory. Upon other subjects he talks sensibly,\n\n45\n\nand as a well-informed man. In listening to his expositions of his views of the concavity of our globe, we felt that interest which is inevitably awakened by the aberrations of an unregulated mind, possessed probably of a capacity too great for the narrow sphere in which it was doomed to act; and which has consumed itself with the fire which, if properly applied, would doubtless have illumined some obscure point in the science which it so strongly affects. In another point of view, Captain Symes has a claim to our best sympathies for the gallantry with which he served his country during the war.\n\nFrom Newark to Columbus the road passes through a moist and heavily-wooded country, well calculated for the growth of the beech tree, which was found here superior in size to any previously observed. This part of the route lying remote from any navigable streams, is almost destitute of population; and it was only when we came to the immediate vicinity of Columbus, that we again found ourselves in the midst of civilization.\n\nThe spot upon which the metropolis of Ohio now stands, presents a remarkable instance of those rapid changes which are so often to be met with in our western states. In 1812 only a single log cabin could be observed, where now a population of fifteen hundred inhabitants is seen enjoying all the comforts, and carrying on all the business of an old settlement. The situation of Columbus is, however, far from presenting advantages that can equal those of many other western settlements. Much difficulty and division appears to have prevailed in Ohio previous to the location of the seat of government; and this spot was probably selected by a sort of compromise, rather with a view to its central situation than from any great local advantage. It stands on\n\n46\n\nthe left bank of the Scioto, at about half a mile from Franklington, whose site on the right bank was thought too low and unhealthy.\n\nThe party were here joined by Mr. Colhoun, who had travelled from Washington city, by the national road, to Wheeling, and thence proceeded to Columbus, where he waited for the arrival of the expedition. Some further arrangements, required to accommodate ourselves to the country through which we had to travel, occasioned in this town a delay of one day, during which we experienced a remarkably heavy thunder-storm, which was accompanied by a wind apparently like a hurricane, its direction shifting at every moment; this produced much damage in the town, and among other things carried off both the gable ends of a house, the wind forcing a way for itself under the roof.\n\nThe banks of the Scioto are covered with pebbles, apparently from primitive formations; no rocks were visible in place, but the limestone used in the town, and which is filled with organic remains, is said to be found in the vicinity; it appears to be similar to that observed at Zanesville.\n\nThe wealth of Ohio has been so often the subject of discussion, that we felt an interest in ascertaining how far the reports circulated were correct. We found that, in fact, the produce yielded by agriculture so far exceeds all demands for it, that it has become a sort of dead stock in the hands of its owners. The price of grain has fallen so low, that the only mode of disposing of it consists in distilling it into whiskey, of which the price is twelve and a half cents per gallon, and when retailed in small quantities it sells at the rate of twenty-five cents per gallon. Such prices must of course be a check upon all\n\n47\n\nindustry, and at the same time productive of much mischief by offering a temptation to intoxication, which too many find it impossible to resist.\n\nThe weather had already set in very warm, the thermometer usually standing at noon at upwards of eighty degrees. Observations for latitude and longitude were commenced here, but were interrupted by the storm.\n\nWednesday, May 21st, the expedition left Columbus on its way to Piqua, situated on the Miami, about seventy miles west of Columbus, and likewise in the state of Ohio. The intermediate country is but thinly settled; the soil is black, and not very deep, seldom more than eight inches; it lies upon a bed of sand and pebbles, which are evidently the detritus of granitic rocks, similar to the large boulders observed every where throughout the country. No rocks to be met with in place. Although the country is very high, being probably, from the best measurements which have been made, at least three hundred and fifty feet above the surface of Lake Erie, and consequently upwards of nine hundred feet above the surface of the ocean, it is very wet, being swampy, with occasional open woods and soft marshy prairies, very unlike those that are described by travellers as existing to the westward, and which we afterwards met with on the St. Peter, &c. The whole of this part of our route led us irresistibly to the conclusion that we were travelling upon the bottom of some lake, whose waters had, at a comparatively modern period, broken their bounds and found their way to the ocean. It is true, that, in the present state of our geographical and geological knowledge of the valley drained by the Mississippi, it is impossible to assign any probable limits to this vast internal ocean; we know too little of the true direction of the different\n\n48\n\nchains of mountains, which extend throughout this section of our country, or of their respective heights, to allow us to trace the limits of that powerful dam which formerly kept the whole of our western country underwater; nor can we attempt to show in what places and from what causes the dam was forced: but the mere inspection of the high plains, which form the centre of the state of Ohio, must satisfy us, that they doubtless owe the characters which they now present to the recent sojourn of water. The country is covered with a very heavy growth of wood; many of the trees are upwards of five feet in diameter. These forests consist chiefly of oak, ash, elm, hickory, sugar-maple, black-walnut, beech, tulip, wild-cherry, &c. The cotton-wood tree and the garden-coral honeysuckle were first observed here in great abundance; the tulip, or Liriodendron, is the tree which attains the largest size. The soil, though good, is not of the first quality, and it is generally observed that the dark black soil, which predominates, is inferior in quality to a chocolate coloured one which is occasionally met with. The average produce of the best crops of Indian corn amounts to about fifty bushels per acre; a good crop of wheat yields about thirty bushels. The increase of population in this district is far from being as rapid as it promised to be; the want of a market, the unhealthiness of all the marshy lands, and the constant impulse to an emigration further to the west, have prevented many settlements being\n\n49\n\nmade, remote from the streams. Wild and unimproved land may be had, in most places, at two dollars per acre, and there is still some public land, belonging to the United States, which may be purchased at one dollar and a quarter per acre. The surface of the country presents some slight undulations. The only stream of any consequence which we met between the Scioto and the Miami, was Mad River, a tributary of the latter. The name which it bears was given to it on account of the wildness of its scenery, and of the agitation of its waters, resulting from the roughness of its bed. This is one of the most romantic streams which the western country presents. Instead of the wide, and frequently dry bed, in which the other streams run with a slow and lazy pace, Mad River descends in many parts of its course through a narrow and contracted channel, with the rapidity of a torrent. Notwithstanding the uncultivated and uninhabited state of the country, we saw but little game; this consisted of a few deer and wild turkeys, which, however, kept so far from our course as to prevent our firing at any.\n\nThe town of Urbanna is small, but neatly laid out. We met here with a family of emigrants lately removed from New Jersey, for the purpose of raising the Palma Christi, and manufacturing from it castor oil, which they propose sending to the eastern cities, by the way of New Orleans; they have already planted twelve acres of it, and, from the experiments which have been made, anticipate much success in this culture.\n\nWe stopped for a day at Piqua, a small town situated on the west bank of the Miami river, and on a spot which appears to have been the seat of a numerous Indian population. The river is navigable for keel boats, a few miles above the town, during half the year. The town\n\n50\n\nis built in a semicircular bend of the river, so that its streets, which are rectilinear, and parallel to the chord of the arc, are terminated at both ends by the water. The spot is one of the most advantageous in the country for a large population; the situation is very fine for defence against aggressors; and we find that, with their accustomed discrimination, the Indians had made this one of their principal seats. The remains of their works are very interesting, and being, we believe, as yet undescribed, we surveyed them with such means as were at our disposal. They consist for the most part of circular parapets, the elevation of winch varies at present from three to five or six feet, but which bear evident marks of having been at one time much higher; many of them are found in the neighbourhood of the town, and several of them in the town itself. The plough passes every year over some parts of these, works, and will probably continue to unite its levelling influence, with that of time, to obliterate the last remains of a people, who, judging from the monuments which it has left behind, must have been far more advanced in civilization than the Indians who were found there a century or two ago; and of whom a few may still be seen occasionally roving about the spot, where their fathers met in council.\n\nWe observed one elliptic and five circular works, two of which are on the east bank of the river, the others are on the west. The ground appears, in all cases, to have been taken from the inside, which forms a ditch in the interior; its depth cannot of course be ascertained at present, as it is in great measure filled up, but it must have been considerable. The area, within the ditch, probably retained the level of the surrounding country. The parapet may have been from three to\n\n51\n\nfour feet wide, but from slow decay it appears much wider. The first which we visited (A.) is situated at about a quarter of a mile to the south-west of the town, and half a mile westward of the river; it appears to have been the most important of all, and forms, as it were, the centre round which the others were disposed. Its form is circular; its diameter is about one hundred and fifty feet: it has a gateway from eight to ten feet wide, which faces the river. Immediately connected, and in close contact with it, to the south-south-east, there is a small circular work (a), the parapet of which is considerably higher; its diameter is about forty-three feet; it has no gateway or opening whatsoever. It has generally been considered as intended for a look-out post; but this opinion appears incorrect, from the circumstance that it is not raised high enough for this purpose; that its size is much greater than what would be required for a mere post of observation; and finally, that its construction essentially differs from that which is recorded by Mr. Atwater and other observers, as belonging to such posts of observation. There is nothing to support this opinion but its situation, which is in the most elevated part of the plain. We, however, think it more probable that it was considered as a strong hold, which should be resorted to in the last extremity. This opinion accounts for all the characters which we observe about it. Its situation, near the main fort at the centre of the works; its smaller dimensions, which, while they would admit a considerable force, would permit it to be defended more easily than the extensive works with which it is connected: the height and thickness of its Parapet confirm this belief. The circumstance of there\n\n52\n\nbeing no gateway is an additional proof for us, that it was intended to be used like the citadel of a modern fortress, as the last spot in which the remnants of a defeated army might be concentrated in order to make a decisive stand against their aggressors.\n\nProceeding in a direction south sixty-five degrees east from the first work, at a distance of about seven hundred and sixty feet, we find another fortification (B.), which, like the former, is partly situated in a ploughed field, but which passes also over a by-road. In this old work, the white man has built his barns, stables, &c, and appears anxious to hurry on the destruction of what would, if uninjured by him, have resisted the assaults of time. The parapet of this fort is not quite so elevated as that of the former; its dimensions are larger, being about two hundred and twenty-five feet in diameter; it has a gateway fronting that in the first fort, and similar to it. If any covered way ever existed by which these two works were connected, it has disappeared, no trace of it being at present visible.\n\nTaking again the first fort (A.) as a centre, and proceeding from it in a course north eighty-five degrees east, we find another circular enclosure (C), distant seven hundred and fifty feet from the first, and about five hundred and forty feet in a northerly course from the second; its parapets are higher than those of the other two; its diameter is about one hundred and fifty feet; it is provided with a gateway fronting that of the first fort. Between the second and third forts (B. and C), and near the bank of the river, there are remains of a waterway (W.), formerly connected, as we suppose, with the third fort; these remains consist of a ditch dug down to the edge of the river; the earth from the same having been thrown up principally on the south side, or that\n\n53\n\nwhich fronts down the river; the breadth between the two parapets is much wider near the water than at a distance from it, so that it may have been used either for the purpose of offering a safe passage down to the river, or as a sort of harbour, in which canoes might be drawn up; or perhaps, as is most probable, it was intended to serve both purposes. This water-way resembles, in some respects, that found near Marietta, but its dimensions are smaller. The remains of this work are at present very inconsiderable, and are fast wasting away, as the road which runs along the bank of the river intersects it, and, in the making of it, the parapet has been levelled and the ditch filled up; this is much to be regretted, as this work, if it could be seen in its perfect state, would perhaps discover the motive which led to the erection of these fortifications, the attacks against which they were intended to provide, and the means by which the resistance was to be effected. But the largest of the works on the western bank still remains to be noticed. This work (D.) is of an elliptical form, and of great eccentricity; its conjugate and transverse diameters measuring eighty-three and two hundred and ninety-five feet; it is situated six hundred feet in a direction north forty degrees east from the first fort, its transverse axis extends nearly east and west; we observed no gateways. This work is almost effaced; its parapet does not rise quite a foot above the ground.\n\nWe crossed the river in a canoe, and landed at the foot of a very steep hill, about one hundred feet high. On the top of this hill, remains of a fort (E.) in a very good state of preservation, are to be seen; it lies in a direction north sixty degrees east from the first fort which we visited, and is one hundred and twenty-three\n\n54\n\nfeet in diameter; it is placed in a very commanding position, on the brow of the hill which has unfortunately been partially washed away, and has carried down with it about one-third part of the works. There is at present but one gateway visible, which is on the east side, and is about six or eight feet wide. This part of the works is one of the most interesting, it having as yet received no injury from the hands of man. It is covered with trees of a very large size. Upon the top of the parapet we found the trunk of a tree, which had evidently grown long after the rampart had been constructed, and probably long after it had ceased to be the theatre of bloodshed and of assault. The interior part of the trunk was very much decayed; but we counted two hundred and fifty concentric layers in what appeared to be less than the outer half: whence we concluded that this tree was certainly upwards of five hundred years old at the time it was cut down. These works all bear the impress of a very remote antiquity; in some cases, trees of a very large size are seen growing upon the trunks of still larger trees. We have, as we conceive, no data to enable us to refer them to any definite date; but we are well warranted, from all their characters, in assigning to them an antiquity of upwards of one thousand years.\n\nAt about fifty rods to the north-north-west of the last-mentioned work there is another, which is circular, and of a much larger size. It has two gateways, one fronting east, and the other west. We did not see this last, but we are indebted to some of the inhabitants of Piqua for a description of it.\n\nAbout these forts there are, as might be expected, many Indian arrow-heads, and other remains to be found;\n\n55\n\nthose which we saw present however nothing peculiar. We observed both the war and the peace arrow-head, or that which is used in hunting, and which is distinguished from the war arrow-head by the absence of the acute shoulder, with which the war-arrow is always provided, in order to cause it to remain in the wound, from which it cannot be extricated without much danger and pain to the patient: whereas that used in hunting is such as can be withdrawn without difficulty. For the same reason, while the latter is attached to the arrow very firmly, the war head adheres to it but imperfectly: so that after it has entered into the body, if the arrow be withdrawn, the head remains buried in the flesh. Among other things found near these fortifications was a piece of broken pottery, which was considered as of Indian manufacture; but on examining it closely, we immediately recognized it to be a fragment of a small earthen crucible, and from its appearance we believe it to be of French manufacture, as it resembles more the French than the German crucible. Taking this into consideration, and bearing in mind that the first French settlers in this country were constantly looking out for ores of gold, silver, &c, we entertain no doubt that this, instead of being of Indian manufacture, is a fragment of a crucible probably imported from France, and used in some, docimastic experiment.\n\nWe had an opportunity the ensuing day, on our way to Fort St. Mary, to see the remains of an old Indian work, which consists of stones apparently resulting from the destruction of a stone wall which is supposed to have been erected by the same nation. It is situated about three miles west of Piqua, on a bluff, elevated about thirty feet above the level of the valley of the\n\n56\n\nriver. The wall, which is considered by some as having been erected for purposes of defence, stood near the brink of the hill, facing to the south-cast. It has been completely thrown down, but its limits may be very distinctly traced by the stones which lie on the ground forming an ellipsis, whose axes are respectively fifteen hundred and nine hundred feet. This work is stated upon the authority of Col. Johnston, to enclose an area of seventeen acres. The longest axis extends in an cast and west line; the distance of the nearest point of the ellipsis to the river was estimated to be about seven hundred yards. At its south-eastern part, it is supported by a circular earthen fort, similar to those, previously described, and measuring about thirty-six yards in diameter. The stones of which the wall was built are all rolled, mostly granitic; few of them are calca"
