        "text": "Callsigns of Australian Army, Airforce, and Navy aircraft\n\nPAGE NAVIGATION:\n\n| Australian Defence Force (ADF) aircraft types | ADF squadrons | ADF aircraft callsigns |\n\n| ADF Airfields and frequencies | RAAF HF frequencies |\n\nADF AIRCRAFT TYPES\n\nOperational ADF Aviation Sqns/Units\n\nAIR FORCE | ARMY | NAVY | CONTRACTOR\n\nADF CALLSIGNS\n\nA tradition of Australian squadrons is to maintain some of the same callsigns regardless of newer aircraft being introduced.\n\nSome current squadron callsigns listed date back several decades.\n\nCallsigns marked \"confirmed\" have been either logged by our listeners in the previous 12 months, or are sourced from (unclassified) ADF documents and defence sources.\n\nOther callsigns listed are from my previous logs dating back to the 1990's. I have updated the aircraft type to reflect the current equipment in use by the SQN that the callsign was originally used by.\n\nThis list includes Australian Air Force, Army & Navy aircraft, as well as Royal Singapore Air Force units based in Australia, along with other callsigns heard on MHFCS.\n\nFORMATIONS\n\nRAAF formation flights use a single word callsign designated for formation flying.\n\nIndividual aircraft in the formation are identified by a number. An aircraft which has broken from formation would then identify itself with the single word callsign followed by it's assigned number. E.G. Formation callsign ADDER, aircraft broken formation callsign ADDER ONE ONE.\n\nIndividual aircraft who join to form a formation are identified by the lead aircrafts callsign with the added suffix COMBINE.\n\nArmy formation flights will append the following names to the unit callsign - indicating a formation flight and its size/composition: BLACK, BLUE, GOLD, RED, WHITE, YELLOW.\n\nNavy formation flights follow the same format as army flights, BLACK, BLUE, GOLD, RED, WHITE, YELLOW, with the addition of the suffix CUB used solely in 816 SQN.\n\nOPS FREQUENCIES\n\nThe Ops frequencies listed may or may not be confirmed, and should be considered not reliable.\n\nThey are listed only for your reference.\n\nOps frequencies are still in the same band although may employ encryption or use frequency hopping.\n\nDue to security protocols, domestic training and exercise flights do not normally use encryption - so you may be able to monitor UHF OPS frequencies for some of these aircraft in Australian airspace.\n\nFrequently Used Unencrypted\n\n234.900, 238.200, 253.600, 256.500, 287.800, 356.500, 278.200, 288.600, 301.100, 301.500, 314.600, 321.200, 324.600, 335.800, 375.400 -\n\nYou can also monitor aerodrome ATC, area CTAF frequencies, the inter-pilot frequency of 123.45 MHz, or 127.9 MHz for most air shows.\n\nConsult ERSA for area frequency listings.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nV\n\nW\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nWILLIAMTOWN BASE UHF FREQUENCIES\n\nThis list has NOT been recently verified and is considered out of date. It is shown here for archival/reference purposes only.\n\nList updated 17/11/2023"
