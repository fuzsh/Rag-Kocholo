        "text": "A2-1022 was one of the early B model Iroquois aircraft purchased and flown by the RAAF and in itself, was not all that special. The RAAF bought the B Models in 3 batches, the 300 series were delivered in 1962, the 700 series in 1963 and the 1000 series were delivered in 1964. A2-1022 was of the third series and was just an Iroquois helicopter, an airframe with an engine, rotor, seats etc, much the same as all the other sixteen thousand or so that were built by the Bell helicopter company all those years ago  it was nothing out of the ordinary. So why did so many people give up their Friday to come and stand around in the hot sun for an hour or more just to see this one?? The reason they did was because there is quite a story associated with this particular aircraft and as is usually the case, the story is more about the people who flew it, flew in it and who fixed it  not about the aircraft itself.\n\nIt belonged to 9 Squadron which arrived in Vietnam, in a roundabout route, in June 1966 with 8 of this type of aircraft and was given the task of providing tactical air transport support for the Australian Task Force. When it arrived in June 1966, 9 Sqn was not fully equipped to wage war. The Defence Department had insisted the squadron would be given several years' notice before being sent into a conflict but it was given only 12 weeks before being deployed and thats a big ask on the men who flew and worked the aircraft and it was a big ask on the aircraft itself. When they arrived in Nui Dat, only two of the eight Iroquois were fitted with armoured seats and none had door gun mounts. None of the aircrew had chest protectors. By the time they were called on to supply D Company, all aircraft had been fitted with armoured seats and had door gun mounts fitted. Unfortunately, this early non-readiness was to cause some friction between the RAAF and the Army with the Army labelling 9 Sqn a bunch of chickens as it reasoned theyre here, so they should be able to provide assistance as and when required. In ensuing months, once up to speed, they did, 9 Squadron conducted themselves honourably and courageously, but the damage was done and the classification stuck.\n\nAt dawn on the early morning mortaring on the 17th, B Company 6RAR was sent out to locate the mortar positions, estimated from compass bearings of the firing sounds to be near the Long Tan rubber plantation some 3000metres northwest of the deserted village of Xa Long Tan. They had no rations or sleeping gear and expected to be back in base by noon. They located five vacated 82mm mortar positions and were told to remain out overnight and be relieved on the 18th. Delta Company was assembled early on the 18th from security duties and ordered out to relieve B Company and continue the search for maybe 50 enemy of the local D445 battalion. B Company sent 48 men back to base for leave, there being no obvious threat at Long Tan. After relieving B Company at 2pm, D Company pushed carefully into the rubber and contacted a small VC patrol which fled east. 11 platoon followed up, to be met by enemy who had moved forward to investigate the intrusion. The action developed into a company defensive battle. Soon more than 2000 enemy troops had enveloped the 108 soldiers of D Company and a fierce battle followed. The soldiers were running low on ammunition and without a new supply they would have been overrun in a very short period of time. Visibility was poor and teeming rain and a low cloud brought on an early darkness.\n\nYou can download a fact sheet on the Long Tan battle HERE..\n\nTo read a background report on the battle, written by Harry Smith, click HERE.\n\nLate in the afternoon, as the Battle raged, Australian Army Commander Brigadier David Jackson (right) became a very worried man. Harry Smith had requested ammunition resupply by helicopter so Jackson urged Group Captain Peter Raw, who was the Task Force's senior RAAF officer to get his helicopters into the air to resupply his troops, but because of RAAF Canberra policy, 9 Sqn helicopters were not then permitted to fly into dangerous areas, Raw hesitated. 34 year old pilot, Flt Lt Frank Riley suggested strongly that the supply flight go ahead and Raw eventually and reluctantly authorised the mission and the aircraft were loaded with the precious ammunition. They were all aware that they could lose at least one aircraft and it was agreed that two helicopters be loaded, just in case. One of those helicopters was A2-1022.\n\nJust before 6pm the two Iroquois were airborne. A2-1020 was piloted by Flt Lts Frank Riley with co-pilot Bob Grandin (right) and down the back were LACs Dave Bluey Collins (crewy) and John Stirling (gunny). A2-1022 was piloted by Flt Lts Cliff Dohle (left) (recently deceased) and Bruce Lane and down the back were Bill Harrington, (Cpl crewy) and Brian Hill (LAC gunny). Both aircraft carried Army munitions personnel as well. The two choppers, both overweight, had planned to fly in company but were separated because of the conditions. In the rapidly fading light, A2-1022, laden with nearly half a tonne of ammunition, was the first to drop its precious cargo to Harry Smith's Delta company  which was just five minutes' flying time from Nui Dat. Bruce Lane was later to say We flew very low, as low as we could and after about five minutes we came to a hover. The blokes in the back just pushed the ammunition out then we got out of there as fast as we could.\"\n\nThe ammunition arrived in the nick of time, saving Delta Company from almost certain annihilation. Frank Riley was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in the supply flight but so many of Harry Smith's troops on the ground, went unrecognised by officialdom (see HERE).\n\nIt was then Harry Smiths turn to address the gathering. Harry was born in July 1933, in Hobart Tasmania, and although that's south of Oatlands, being a Tasmaniac automatically makes him a damn good bloke.\n\nHe was Nashoed in 1952 and liked the Army so much that after his term was up, he applied for officer school in the regular Army, was accepted and was sent to Officer Cadet School at Portsea in Victoria. In June 1966, having reached the rank of Major, (thats Sqn Ldr in the real money), he was posted to Vietnam as the OC of D Coy, 6RAR. On 18 August, after the shelling of Nui Dat, he led the soldiers of D Coy out on patrol to look for the enemy but ran into a huge force of North Vietnamese at Long Tan.\n\nUnder his command, D Coy fended off a numerically superior force, with at least 245 Vietnamese confirmed as killed and another 300 believed wounded. 15 Australians were given bravery awards, but many of these had been downgraded from the original nomination. Smiths leadership of his men during the fierce fighting saw him recommended for the Distinguished Service Order, but he instead received the Military Cross. On 14 August 2008, after years of campaigning for better recognition for his men who fought in the Long Tan battle, several of them had their bravery awards upgraded and his own Military Cross was rightly upgraded to the Star of Gallantry.\n\nClick HERE to see the video of Harry being presented with the MC - unfortunately, there is no sound.\n\nOn 9 March 2011 at the Maryborough Military and Colonial Museum, (Qld) he was presented with the Star of Gallantry by local MP Paul Neville. Many of the Long Tan veterans were in attendance for the ceremony.\n\nWithout his leadership, it has been strongly suggested that things would have been very different and Australian losses would have been far greater. A lot of 6RAR blokes owe him an awful lot!\n\nHe retired from the Army in 1976 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Wng Cdr).\n\nBruce Haigh\n\nPosthumous examination and recognition of exceptional acts of bravery during active service is fraught with pitfalls.\n\nStrong claims have been made over the years by concerned and well-motivated individuals and organisations that a number of Australians who performed extraordinary acts of courage during wartime hostilities and whose acts went unrecognised or were insufficiently recognised, should now, after proper consideration and deliberation, be awarded posthumous VCs.\n\nThe Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal has been set up by the Australian Government to ascertain whether certain individuals, who are said to have carried out exceptional acts of bravery during active service, but who remain unrecognised, should now receive that recognition in the form of a posthumous Victoria Cross.\n\nThe Victoria Cross of Australia was instituted in 1991 and is a direct descendent of the British Victoria Cross which used to be awarded to eligible Australians. Those often cited for posthumous recognition of the VC include Private John Simpson, of Gallipoli fame, and Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean. As Les Carlyon points out in his book, Gallipoli, Simpson did not easily fit the mould of hero, such as people like Albert Jacka, Harry Murray, Arthur Blackburn and ''Snowy'' Howell.\n\nOrdinary Seaman Sheean, aged 19, was a loader on the Australian-built Corvette HMAS Armidale, when it was attacked and sunk by Japanese planes in the Timor Sea in December 1942. Sheean refused to abandon ship, strapped himself to the gun he normally serviced, shot down a Japanese bomber and went down with the vessel.\n\nThe Australian historian G. Hermon Gill, who wrote the official history, Royal Australian Navy, 1942-1945, says the ship's captain, Lieutenant-Commander David Richards, RANR(S), singled out Sheean for special mention in the Report of Proceedings of HMAS Armidale and Ordinary Seaman R. M. Caro in an account of the action, detailing the incident and the exceptional bravery of Teddy Sheean.\n\nOf course we have to be careful at what is driving this push to redress forgotten recognition. No doubt there is a strong sense of righting an injustice, of giving credit where credit is due, and properly so. But we also have to be mindful and careful of recent trends to jingoism, overblown nationalism and xenophobia.\n\nIn seeking to anoint heroes we have to be careful that we don't airbrush from the picture undesirables who might not fit the public perception of the type of person who should be worthy of elevation.\n\nHistorian Peter Stanley in his book, Bad Characters, says of the First AIF that, ''It should come as no surprise to find that even VC-winners went absent, caught VD and came before courts-marshals Other VCs ran up against the AIF's disciplinary code as much as their less distinguished comrades.\n\nJohn Leak, for example, who received a VC for his conduct at Pozieres in July 1916, later had a troubled time. In 1917 he burst into the sergeants' mess at Wareham demanding a drink and refusing a sergeant-major's order to leave, and then went AWL twice. The second time, in November 1917, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life, an extraordinarily harsh sentence. He admitted in his defence - honestly but foolishly - that he ''could not stand shell fire''. Joe Maxwell, the AIF's second-most highly decorated soldier after ''Mad Harry'' Murray, caught VD and was repeatedly in trouble with his superiors in the 18th Battalion. Even in the year in which he was awarded the DCM, MC and VC (and commissioned), Maxwell faced military and civil charges. Maxwell, still only 22, did little else with his life except write the racy and candid memoir, Hell's bells and Mademoiselles.\n\nI hear you say, my sort of man, but is he the sort of man likely to be awarded a posthumous VC by a committee or tribunal? With the new wave of jingoism, Leake and his sad story have been airbrushed out of our history. The Australian War Memorial, in their publication, Wartime Issue 32, Inspirational Bravery, which talks about bravery in battle and awards contains the following sentence, ''In one case an Australian Victoria Cross winner of 1916 was charged with desertion the following year.'' What is wrong in mentioning his name? It seems to me that both Leake and Maxwell might have been suffering from post-traumatic stress, something unrecognised then. Why not say so and give him the dignity he deserves. Not all heroes can fit into or behave according to a schoolboy stereotype.\n\nBut the posthumous recognition of outstanding acts of wartime courage seems to me fraught with other possibilities. If the upside is for the Commonwealth, after consideration, to give an award for bravery hitherto unrecognised, surely the logical downside is to remove honours and awards unjustly, unfairly or dishonestly conferred.\n\nShould Lieutenant-General Henry Gordon Bennett be posthumously stripped of his rank and all awards for deserting his troops of the 8th Division, when they were taken into captivity by the Japanese on Singapore?\n\nBennett slipped the noose and came back to Australia, ostensibly to explain and elaborate on Japanese tactics to a nation facing the prospect of invasion, but more likely to keep himself in the running to be commander in chief of the Australian Army, a post he coveted. Bennett's superior officer and the man in charge of the campaign, General Percival, stayed with his troops and went into captivity.\n\nShould Field Marshall Sir Thomas Blamey be posthumously returned to the rank of general for his appalling handling of the Kokoda campaign, where he allowed the arrogant, over-bearing and vain US General MacArthur to bully, not only senior Australian officers including Blamey, but also the Australian prime minister, John Curtin?\n\nStuart Braga, the biographer of Major-General ''Tubby'' Allen, in the book Kokoda Commander, says, ''In this culture of utter dependence on the Great Man, Curtin did not insist on the collaborative spirit of MacArthur's appointment being met Curtin's failure to insist on an effective joint staff at MacArthur's GHQ cost the Australian Army dearly. It was relegated to a subordinate role for the whole of the Pacific War, and employed on campaigns of minor significance. ''\n\nTo protect his career Blamey stood by and watched this development, saying and doing nothing to advance Australian strategic input. He complied with a directive from MacArthur to go to New Guinea and take control of the Battle for Kokoda. Blamey sacked Generals Potts, Allen and Rowell, which pleased MacArthur but ruined three fine military careers and made no difference to the campaign. To top it off, at a parade in Port Morseby of the gallant 21st Brigade who had fought an outstanding, gallant and now recognised text book retreat along the Kokoda Track, Blamey accused the men of running away from the Japanese; it was all the officers could do to hold their men in check.\n\nFinally, should Chester Wilmot, of the ABC, be given a posthumous award for his honest reporting of the campaign, which Blamey so loathed that he had him withdrawn from PNG?\n\nWhere does one draw the line?\n\nIn the cases under consideration by the tribunal and others that might arise from the precedent created, why not institute a special posthumous award that can be issued by the Parliament of Australia for bravery and courage not previously acknowledged or recognised?\n\nLetter to his CO from a Captain\n\nanswering his CO's \"Request for further information.\"\n\nSir,\n\nIn your icy, indeed hostile, telephone call of yesterday, you requested a report about the alleged proceedings involving my soldiers. As the reports from the local authorities and the head of the Australian legation were undoubtedly a complete fabrication, I welcome the opportunity to put the truth of the matter forward.\n\nYour kind offer to \"buy a round of drinks\" for the troops at the end of the deployment was taken and the CSM ensured that appropriate quantities of libation and food were purchased against your credit card , with festivities being held in my hotel suite. An enjoyable evening ensued but insufficient supplies had been obtained, so several members of the company left for further purchases at a local bar.\n\nIn a truly magnanimous gesture, ten bar girls from that establishment helped carry the beer back to the hotel. To demonstrate our appreciation of their assistance, we served them some cool drink. They then offered to show us some local culture, and, in order not to offend, we allowed them to dance.\n\nThe banging on the walls of my room had, by now, quite honestly, become invasive, and it was disturbing the dancers, so we arranged an amusing little deterrent. LT Brown's impersonation of a Police Officer was quite clever as he goose-stepped to each room and harangued the occupants with a very witty diatribe about disturbing hotel guests. I personally heard nothing of his alleged threats to life or limb in as claimed by the sister of the local Police Chief whose room was, unluckily, next door.\n\nI suspect that this woman was the sneak who called security and hotel management but I absolutely refute that the shout \"Stand To, enemy approaching!\" was made. The simple coincidence of security arriving just as we stood the double bed on its side across the door to make the dance floor bigger is obvious. The major damage to the room occurred when a group of gate crashers, whom we could not know were hotel security, forced their way in just as most of us happened to be leaning against the bed watching the dancing.\n\nThe subsequent events in the foyer of the hotel are an equally vicious distortion of the facts. I was explaining the importance of the post activity celebrations to the General Manager of the hotel, and stating that other guests were obviously fabricating their stories of the noise and drinking, when CPL Smith and several others from HQ Coy (in keeping with their pursuit of physical fitness) organised the race up the drapes which hang along the foyer wall. It says little for the workmanship that the fittings were torn from the wall before most of the company was even halfway up.\n\nAt this stage SGT Williams, our Orderley Room SGT attempted to rescue the situation with her depth of knowledge of local culture. Her rendition of the Fertility Dancing Maiden in the foyer's 'Pool of Remembrance' was nothing short of breathtaking. Normally this dance is performed wearing just a sarong skirt but SGT Williams' extra step to \" Au Natural\" was a bold step forward. Unfortunately, during one intricate step, SGT Williams slipped and fell beneath the fountain, but we were lucky that SSGT Johnson had the great presence of mind to strip to avoid getting his uniform wet, leapt in to help.\n\nThe tiles of the pool were very slippery and it took nearly ten minutes of threshing about before he could actually complete his rescue. Such concern was there for these two exemplary member's safety, that the many of company jumped in to assist, and I deny that this massed rescue attempt could be construed as a 'Water Polo' game!\n\nOrder had nearly been restored when the fire started. I prefer CPL White's version of events that the drapes had caught fire from being against a light fitting, and that he dropped his cigarette lighter whilst trying to escape the flames. Had hotel management fulfilled their responsibilities and used fire retardant material instead of velvet, the fire would not have spread to the rest of the hotel.\n\nThe responsible attitude shown by my soldiers in assisting the bar staff to carry out drinks from the cocktail party is to be commended, not condemned, and the attempt by many male members to extinguish pockets of fire using natural means has been totally misrepresented in some quarters.\n\nI made an official protest about these matters when the head of the Australian Legation visited us at the Police Station the next morning. However, not only did Ambassador Downey not attempt to refute the preposterous allegations made against me and my soldiers crew, but also failed to secure our release immediately.\n\nI trust that now I have outlined the correct version of events, we may allow ourselves a discreet smile as to the lack of social sophistication of some of these developing nations and put all this behind us. In my opinion my soldiers behaved in accordance with the finest Australian Army traditions.\n\nYour most obedient servant,"
