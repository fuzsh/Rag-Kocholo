        "text": "LAKEVILLE — Nate Levesque had to work a little harder than usual, but that was just fine with Apponequet's ace right-hander in a 9-0 South Coast Conference win over GNB Voc-Tech on Friday.\n\n\"I felt good out there and I got stronger as the game went on. I tried to stay ahead in the count and trust my defense,\" said Levesque, a 6-foot-4 senior who will continue his baseball career at Franklin Pierce College in the fall. \"My slider was working down and in and that kept (the Bears) off balance.\"\n\nLevesque, who played center on the Lakers' basketball team in the winter season, finished his complete-game effort against the Bears with 102 pitches, a number that was a little higher than normal, but he was able to hang in there and tough it out on a raw and windy day.\n\n\"Nate usually doesn't throw that many pitches, but we know we're going to get a good effort from him every time we roll him out there,\" Apponequet coach Jim Cabucio said. \"He has good command of his pitches, and he throws strikes.\"\n\nLevesque worked on getting bigger and stronger in the offseason, where his fastball improved from 84 to 89 miles-per-hour. He also worked on improving his mechanics.\n\n\"I needed to tweak some things here and there,\" Levesque said. \"I still have some work to do, but I feel good about this season. I think we have the experience and talent to go a long way.\"\n\nVOTE: Baseball Player of the Week for April 8-14\n\nAgainst the Bears, Levesque finished with a three-hitter, eight strikeouts and two walks. He also helped himself with a pair of pickoffs — one at second base to end the top of the first inning, and one at first base for the first out in the seventh.\n\n\"Nate is a very smart player on the mound,\" Cabucio said. \"He's always in the game mentally and he always knows what the situation is.\"\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED\n\nThe Lakers opened the scoring in the bottom of the second on a two-run single to center field by catcher Peter Rubini that was set by a nicely-executed sacrifice bunt by right fielder Seth Richards. They added an unearned run in the third to make it a 3-0 game and put three more runs on the board in the fourth on a hit-and-run single to right by second baseman Cameron Sylvia and a clutch, two-out, two-run single by third baseman Camden Cyr.\n\nPinch-hitter Conor Tripp knocked in a run with a single in the fifth to make it a 7-0 game and the Lakers capped their scoring with a pair of insurance runs on wild pitches in the sixth.\n\n\"We got some timely hits when we needed them,\" Cabucio said. \"We were patient at the plate, and we put the ball in play.\"\n\nSEASON PREVIEW: Meet the top 30 high school baseball players from the SouthCoast to watch in 2024\n\nWHAT IT MEANS\n\nThe undefeated Lakers improved to 5-0 overall and 2-0 in the SCC. .... The Bears dropped to 2-3 overall and 0-2 in the conference. ... Both teams return to action for league games on Monday. Apponequet hosts Case and GNB Voc-Tech hosts Somerset Berkley.\n\nGNB VOC-TECH STATS\n\nAmir Cartegena reached on a one-out single in the second inning and Illiam Santiago followed with an infield hit. The Bears' other hit came on a leadoff single in the fourth by starting pitcher Jhaden Reis. ... Reis allowed nine hits in five-plus innings of work, with three strikeouts and one walk. Cartegena did not allow a hit after taking over from Reis with no outs in the bottom of the sixth. He notched a strikeout, walked two batters, and picked an Apponequet runner off first base. ... The Bears finished with one stolen base and they made two of their three errors in the bottom of the third inning.\n\nAPPONEQUET STATS\n\nCenter fielder Justin Serrecchia had a pair of singles to lead the Lakers' nine-hit attack. ... Left fielder Ryan Levesque added a double and the Lakers also got a single from designated hitter Brody Joly and an infield hit by first baseman Lucas Tremblay. ... The Lakers committed three errors and they finished with one stolen base.\n\nCOACHES CORNER\n\n\"We just haven't been playing well lately. We have some players coming back from injuries and hopefully that will get us back on track. We're not hitting the ball with runners on base. We need to start getting some big hits so we can put some runs on the board.\" —GNB Voc-Tech coach Matt Semaio\n\nGNB Voc-Tech 000 000 0 —0\n\nApponequet 021 303 x — 9\n\nWP - Nate Levesque (3-0); LP: Reis (0-1)\n\nHRs - None"
