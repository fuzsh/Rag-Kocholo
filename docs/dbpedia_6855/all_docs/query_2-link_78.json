        "text": "In October 1963 the Australian government announced the purchase of the then untested General Dynamics F-111. The aircraft ordered were due for delivery in 1968 to replace the RAAF's fleet of Government Aircraft Factory built English Electric Canberra bombers. However by 1969 continuing problems with the F-111 programme and a possible delivery date of 1974, if at all, meant an interim type was required as the Canberra's were running out of airframe hours. Air Vice Marshal C F Read led a team to the United States to examine proposals for a interim strike aircraft in May 1970. To the delight of many senior RAAF officers and aircrew, Read recommended the Mc Donnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II ahead of the Grumman A-6 Intruder and the British Blackburn Buccaneer.\n\nIn June 1970 the Australian government announced the unusual step of leasing twenty four Mc Donnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II's at a cost of US$34 Million over a two year period inclusive of spares and training. A little known feature of the agreement was that under U.S law, leased equipment could be demanded on the asis ofextraordinary contractual actions to facilitate the national defense\".he U.S could demand the return of the Phantom's at any time! The agreement also contained an option for Australia to buy the F-4's at US$12 Million each, should the F-111 program be cancelled.\n\nOn October 25th,1972 six RAAF Phantom's flown by USAF crews from the 388th TFW returned to the United States along with KC-135A Stratotanker support. Five Phantom's returned to the US in November 1972, six more departed on June 6th 1973 and another four returned on June 21st,1973. The last official RAAF Phantom flight was June 20th,1973. Finally on June 22nd,1973 the last two Phantom's departed for their US home. After only 2 years 9 months and 3 days the Phantom's RAAF tour of duty was complete.\n\nThe RAAf did not deploy it's Phantoms during its involvement in the war in Vietnam.\n\nRAAF F-4E on delivery from the US to Australia.Note the full load of tanks and travel pod\n\nRAAF F-4E high over the Pacific heading for Australia bring refuelled by a USAF stratotanker.\n\nRAAF Amberley in the early 1970's with Hercules, Orions, Caribou, Huey, Canberras, Mirages Phantoms.\n\nRAAF Pearce,WA with a full compliment of auxiliary fuel tanks.\n\nRAAF Amberley along with replacement General Dynamics F-111C.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, St Louis Missouri,prior to delivery to the RAAF.\n\nOver Clontarf,QLD.\n\nWGCDR Lyall Klaffer and AVM Brian Eaton about to board an RAAF F-4E in 1973.\n\nLyall Klaffer served in Korea from 8 July 1950 to 7 April 1951 flying a Mustang in 105 operations over Korea.

Klaffer is also the only RAAF pilot to fly over Hanoi during the Vietnam War whllst based at Ubon,Thailand during the late 1960's.\n\nRetired an Air Commodore, OAM AFC MID* DFC(US) Air Medal (US)\n\nPilot Officer Lyall Robert Klaffer, of 77 Squadron RAAF, after returning from a combat mission in one of the unit’s P51 Mustang fighter aircraft\n\nSQNLDR Lyall Klaffer with fellow crew members from the 16th TRS,USAF on the SQNLDRs last day at Tan Son Nhut Air Base South Vietnam\n\nSQNLDR Lyall Klaffer RAAF and COL Victor Cabas USAF, the 363rd TRWs CO\n\ncelebrate 1,000 Hours flying time by SQNLDR Klaffer in the RF-4C.\n\nAir Vice Marshal Brian Alexander Eaton, CB, CBE, DSO & Bar, DFC joined the RAAF in 1938\n\nIn 1943 he departed Australia for North Africa fearful that the fighting would be over before he arrived. He posted in to No. 1 Middle East Training School in January 1943 prior to taking up duties with No. 3 Squadron RAAF, which was then engaged in the Battle of Tunisia.\n\nEaton's combat career began inauspiciously, when he was shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his P-40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20 mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, \"I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised.\" Eaton brought his crippled aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88 mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me 109 that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, 80 miles away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: \"I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling.\n\nOn 16 February 1944, the day after the contentious destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No. 3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No. 239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No. 3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No. 1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt.[He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7 April, in recognition of his leadership of No. 3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy\n\nFlying Kiityhaks and Mustangs Eaton was unofficially credited with shooting down as many as seven enemy aircraft during the Mediterranean campaigns, but was never listed among Australian flying aces. Many of the missions that he undertook with No. 3 Squadron and in command of No. 239 Wing were ground attack or anti-shipping sorties, rather than air-to-air combat. He was also known as a leader who, when opportunities did arise to engage other aircraft, would attempt to manoeuvre his rookie pilots into position to make a \"kill\", rather than take the shot himself. On 12 June, he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for \"Outstanding skill and leadership against heavy odds\". His war service also earned him the US Silver Star.\n\nIn 1951 he landed a Vampire jet fighter at Point Cook with one flat tyre and one wheel retracted, after its undercarriage had become jammed. The plane skidded off the runway but Eaton was able to walk away, reportedly remarking \"Well, I didn't wreck it\"\n\nI\n\nSquadron Leader Brian Eaton, Commanding Officer of No. 3 Squadron RAAF by Kiityhawk fighter.\n\nWing Commander Eaton in a No. 77 Squadron Meteor during a visit to Korea, October 1951"
