Air gunner, F/SGT ROGERS, A.J., Air gunner, SGT WHITEHEAD, A.D., ARM/A.G., F/SGT MORRIS, R.M., Flight Engineer and CPL MADDEN, D.W., passenger, took off in Liberator A72-80 from Truscott Strip, Western Australia, leading a formation of four aircraft on an armed shipping sweep. Shortly after take off, S/Ldr STRAUS called Truscott tower on V.H.F. indicating that he was preparing for an emergency landing. Owing to low altitude it was apparent that S/Ldr STRAUS could not locate the strip. For 23 minutes after take off the aircraft was airborne and during this time various messages from the aircraft were received by Truscott tower and V.H.F. homing and by the remainder of the aircraft in the formation. None of these messages informed the exact cause of the distress but all that was received was that the aircraft could not gain height. At 0713 hours a message was received that S/Ldr STRAUS was about to ditch in Vansittart Bay. Following this the crews of the remaining three aircraft saw A72-80 ditch with wings level but at a fairly high rate of descent. The aircraft caught fire on impact with the water and disintegrated. ..\"\n\nOnly three bodies were recovered - F/Sgt Rogers on 23rd, S/Leader N.H Straus on 29-3-45, and F/Lt C.D. Parry-okenden on 31-3-45. A72-81 44-41454 B-24L-5-CO ? ? Served with 7 OTU.\n\nServed with 24Sqn.

T\n\nhe crew as well as the Liberator survivors were force to abandon the aircraft. By this time Shilling had been shot down & abandoned a blazing aircraft twice in the same day. Shilling was eventually rescued and survived the war.\n\nCrew of A72-81; FLGOFF S.L. McDonald (Pilot), PLTOFF K.A. Brown (2nd Pilot), FLGOFF P.A. Mouatt (Nav), FLGOFF A.G.

On the downwind leg of the circuit the captain was unable to see the flarepath. On turning into the wind the flarepath was not visible above 700 feet. The aircraft was then well to the left of the strip and in communication with the flying control officer in the tower who advised the captain that he was west of the strip. The aircraft acknowledged the message and indicated that another circuit would be made. The undercarriage was then retracted on orders from the captain. Without warning the aircraft swung violently to port. FLTLT Cambridge endeavoured to correct this. He noticed then that the fuel pressure of numbers 1, 2 and 3 motors had dropped to zero and the fuel pressure in number 4 motor was fluctuating. Power was increased on number 4 motor in an endeavour to maintain height. It was impossible to keep the aircraft straight and it was losing height rapidly. It was then about 200 feet. The captain switched to intercommunication and warned the crew that a crash landing was imminent. The wheels were still fully retracted and 20 degrees flaps were down. Headlights were switched on. The aircraft crashed through trees and landed on an even keel. The trees helped to retard speed and the final impact was not very severe. Fire broke out in the nose and under the flight deck, presumably caused by the auxiliary power units smashing on impact. Sgt Francis had his foot jammed in the waist (gunner's area). He was freed eventually by FLGOFF Coward and PLTOFF Rhodes. The aircraft was well ablaze now. PLTOFF Rhodes carried out SGT Jennings, dangerously injured, to safety. FLTLT Scanlon, also dangerously injured, had managed to throw himself out of the aircraft and was carried to safety by FLTLT Cambridge and WOFF Crawford. FLGOFF Coward was slightly injured. FLTLT Parkinson and FLGOFF Pitt were missing from the muster. These officers were stationed under the flight deck and it was evident that they were killed. Subsequently their remains were recovered. The balance of the crew were not injured except for minor lacerations, bruises and abrasions. The crash took place at about 2355 hours. Half to three quarters of an hour later a Tiger Moth from 21SQN helped guide ground parties to the scene of the smash, some two miles from the strip through roadless, timbered boggy country.\" The very next day saw the Squadron bury the two crew members at the Adelaide River Cemetery.\n\nAircraft Crew: FLTLT A.A.

Served with 12 Sqn.\n\nTaking off at night from Truscott airstrip the aircraft became airborne approximately halfway down the strip. It is believed the aircraft became airborne early due to a noticeable hump in the airstrip causing the aircraft to suddenly climb approx. 20ft. According to the witnesses who were part of a working party directly in front of the aircraft when it became airborne, the aircraft apparently veered left moving rather slowly, gaining little speed or height. The aircraft then rose to about 40ft and then fell sharply to the ground a short distance away from it's initial point of take off. With fire crews quickly making their way to the scene any hope of finding survivors was lost when a number depth charges the aircraft was carrying exploded. 20 May 1945.\n\nCrew; FLTLT F.L.
