        "text": "In a neon-drenched dreamscape where synths pulse like ultraviolet rays, Shannon Hemmett emerges as LEATHERS, a musical force poised to electrify the pop landscape. Her debut album “Ultraviolet,” set to drop on August 16, 2024, promises a sonic journey through the liminal spaces of modern existence, where fantasy and reality blur in a haze of glossy beats and nocturnal atmospheres. Hemmett, a multifaceted artist with roots in graphic design and photography, has crafted not just an album, but an entire aesthetic universe that beckons listeners into her carefully constructed world of contrasts and contradictions.\n\n“It’s been a long time coming, and we’re so excited to finally have it out in the real world,” Hemmett reveals, her voice brimming with anticipation. “Ultraviolet explores all kinds of contrasts: light and dark, fantasy and reality, feminine and masculine, creation and destruction. I hope people will put it on and listen to it from start to finish; we carefully considered the track order so it flows like the soundtrack to a film.” This cinematic approach to album composition reflects Hemmett’s holistic vision for LEATHERS, where every element, from sound to visuals, contributes to an immersive experience.\n\nThe album’s title, “Ultraviolet,” serves as a perfect encapsulation of the project’s essence. Hemmett explains, “I felt it suited the nocturnal, glowing-in-the-dark atmosphere of the album.” This choice of title not only evokes the album’s sonic palette but also hints at the hidden depths and unseen energies that permeate Hemmett’s work. Like the ultraviolet spectrum itself, her music reveals layers of meaning and emotion that might otherwise remain invisible to the naked eye or ear.\n\nLEATHERS’ journey to “Ultraviolet” has been a gradual evolution, with roots tracing back to the “Reckless” EP that first captured the attention of music lovers and industry insiders alike. Reflecting on this progression, Hemmett notes, “The songs on Ultraviolet were written over a period of five years, sometimes more. I feel the vocals and the lyrical content evolved the most, showing more command and confidence. We’ve experimented with elements of darkwave, dream pop, shoegaze, and synth-pop, and we’ll continue to explore those textures on upcoming material.” This willingness to blend genres and push boundaries speaks to Hemmett’s artistic fearlessness and her commitment to sonic exploration.\n\nThe creation of “Ultraviolet” was not without its challenges, as Hemmett candidly shares. “I recently revisited some of the early demos, and it’s wild to hear how far the songs come from the idea stages to completion. The foundation is always there, but then you have to sculpt and carve away at the details until it’s done. There are so many decisions to make when writing songs that it’s difficult to know when a song is actually finished. You just have to trust your gut and listen for what the song wants to be.” This insight into her creative process reveals the meticulous care and attention to detail that Hemmett brings to her craft.\n\nThe album’s latest single, “Divine,” offers a glimpse into the pressure-cooker environment that can sometimes fuel creativity. Hemmett recounts, “Divine was the final single we completed for the album. We had the demo in progress for a few years, but it didn’t have any lyrics or vocal melodies up until the very last moment. We were under some pressure to complete the song to meet the deadline for the album. Sometimes pressure is the ultimate inspiration!” This anecdote not only highlights the unpredictable nature of the creative process but also showcases Hemmett’s ability to thrive under pressure.\n\nLEATHERS is very much a DIY project, with Hemmett taking on multiple roles beyond that of musician. She elaborates, “I’ve taken on lots of skills required to support the project, which means being my own in-house photographer, video director, social media and content creator, as well as handling any admin tasks like tour management and visa applications.” This hands-on approach ensures that every aspect of LEATHERS aligns with Hemmett’s artistic vision, creating a cohesive and authentic brand identity.\n\nWhen it comes to balancing electronic and organic elements in her music, Hemmett approaches the studio as a playground of sonic possibilities. “We love experimenting with different sounds and instruments all the time,” she explains. “We always try to serve the song; if that means playing an original Juno-60 or recording a bunch of cutlery crashing on the floor, we’ll do that.” This willingness to blend the synthetic with the organic contributes to the rich, textured soundscapes that define LEATHERS’ music.\n\nVisually, LEATHERS inhabits a world where disparate influences coalesce into a striking aesthetic. Hemmett describes it as “The photography of Helmut Newton meets the films of David Lynch meets the design aesthetic of 4AD records.” This fusion of high-fashion sensuality, surrealist mystery, and indie music iconography creates a visual language that perfectly complements the music’s atmospheric depth.\n\nHemmett’s background in graphic arts plays a crucial role in shaping LEATHERS’ visual identity. She reflects, “As a music fan, I think it’s super cool when a band’s visual aesthetic pairs well with their sound. Some of my favorite examples of this crossover include Joy Division/New Order and Peter Saville, Depeche Mode and Anton Corbijn, and Duran Duran and Patrick Nagel. By engaging all the senses, you can create a more immersive experience for the listener, and I definitely wanted to have that element in my own music projects.” This holistic approach to art and music ensures that LEATHERS offers a complete sensory experience.\n\nPhotography plays a central role in Hemmett’s creative process. “I went to school for photography, and it’s been such a helpful skill to have as a musician,” she shares. “I shoot nearly all the visual material for LEATHERS myself. I really enjoy self-portraiture as an art form; I feel it allows me to express myself in an authentic way.” This integration of visual and musical arts culminates in a LEATHERS Lyrics and Photobook, a project Hemmett describes as “really special, containing 50+ pages of original photos and design created by me. I can’t wait to share it with the fans.”\n\nThe influence of David Lynch’s cinematic vision is evident in LEATHERS’ atmospheric sound and visual aesthetic. Hemmett elaborates, “I love Lynch’s cinematic vocabulary: the atmospheres, the jewel-toned colors, his repetition of meaningful symbols. There are secrets in his films, and I like that he doesn’t give everything away to the viewer. I’m definitely inspired by that.” This appreciation for mystery and symbolism adds layers of depth to LEATHERS’ work, inviting listeners and viewers to engage in their own interpretations.\n\nLiterary influences also shape Hemmett’s songwriting, particularly the works of J.G. Ballard. She explains, “Ballard had a futuristic vision about the ways that technology would affect our daily lives. He predicted that we would eventually use technology to be seen as successful and thriving by our peers but actually be deeply miserable and morally bankrupt beneath our public-facing personas. This identity crisis and the attention economy are something I find interesting to explore in my art and music.” These themes of technological alienation and the dichotomy between public and private selves resonate throughout LEATHERS’ work.\n\nThe choice of “LEATHERS” as a moniker for her musical project carries significant meaning for Hemmett. “To me, the name LEATHERS stands for a type of armor, something you can wear for protection,” she reveals. “It’s a fortress for self-expression.” This concept of music and art as both a shield and a means of authentic expression encapsulates the dual nature of Hemmett’s work: simultaneously vulnerable and empowering.\n\nHemmett’s experience as a keyboardist in the acclaimed Vancouver post-punk band ACTORS has significantly influenced her approach to LEATHERS. “With ACTORS, we tour a lot, and it’s been amazing to be able to perform for audiences all over the world,” she reflects. “That experience on stage has been invaluable and helped me develop a strong on-stage persona when performing with LEATHERS.” This seasoned stage presence adds another layer of depth to LEATHERS’ live performances, promising audiences a captivating and polished show.\n\nAs “Ultraviolet” prepares to make its mark on the music world, Hemmett stands at the forefront of a new wave of artists who blur the lines between music, visual art, and technology. Her multidisciplinary approach and attention to detail promise an album that is not just heard but experienced. With its blend of ethereal synths, pulsing beats, and Hemmett’s haunting vocals, “Ultraviolet” is poised to carve out a unique space in the electro-pop landscape."
