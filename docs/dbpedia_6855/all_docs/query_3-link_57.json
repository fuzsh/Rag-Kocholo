'--' is a standard way of doing this, which indicates to the program that all of the following arguments should not be interpreted as switches but just regular data.

If you're using it to start a Cygwin process, and you want to have an argument with spaces in it (as is the case with any nontrivial -c) then you will have to be very careful with how you use quotes to ensure that the Cygwin->Windows->Cygwin conversion of the argv[] works correctly.

Peter, beware that the need for quoting isn't just for spaces, but for any shell and cmd metacharacters (they are different). So, for example, any use of '^' or '&' or '>' needs to be properly quoted *after* the conversion Brian mentioned.

I don't know how easy or hard it would be to add that feature to cygstart, but depending on what program you are running you may be able to acheive it in a different manner. For example, instead of `cygstart foo', you could try `cygstart bash -c \"printf %b '\\e]0;bar\\a'; foo\"' to change the title to bar before running foo. - -- Life is short - so eat dessert first!
