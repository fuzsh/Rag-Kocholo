Cardinals, now always bishops, number about 150. They serve as the chief counsellors to the Pope. The Supreme Pastor is further assisted by the Roman Curia -- Curie romaine, which consists of:\n\n(a) Office of the Pope, including the Secretariat of State or the Papal Secretariat, within which is the Section for Relations with States, which replaced the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church.

When assigned to particular sees, they are individually responsible for the teaching, sanctification and governance of their particular jurisdictions of the Church. The Synod of Bishops, directly responsible to the Pope, acts as a system for communicating on questions of importance between the Pope and the bishops and among the bishops themselves.\n\nThe Papal territorial possessions are called the State of Vatican City, situated within the city of Rome (Italy) and occupying 108.7 acres. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world. Papal authority is recognized as supreme by virtue of a Concordat reached with the Italian State and ratified 7 Jun 1929. Included in Vatican City are the Vatican Palace, various museums, art galleries, libraries, apartments, offices, a post office and St Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe term Holy See stands for the central authority of the Church, which transcends, although includes, the sovereign State of Vatican City. Thus, the Holy See represents a world wide community and not only the citizens of Vatican City. Since the Holy See does not have the political, commercial, strategic interests of other countries, the focus of all its initiatives is always the \"human person\", its dignity, rights and duties. In keeping with this principle, the Holy See is mainly concerned with issues concerning human rights, justice, religious freedom, development and peace; it attempts to present, always respectfully but without fear, the principles of the Gospel.\n\nRelations with Inter-Governmental Organizations\n\nAvailable with paid subscription only.\n\nType I Classification\n\nAvailable with paid subscription only.\n\nSubjects *\n\nAvailable with paid subscription only.\n\nUIA Org ID\n\nXF8042\n\nLast News\n\n2010"
