As originally conceived, Nora was supposed to be a little bit like Katharine Hepburn. But I had my own definite idea of what I wanted her to be - more like Lauren Bacall. So I walked into the audition, and like Sinatra, I did it my way. After I finished my reading, the powers-that-be all sat there with their mouths hanging open. You could hear a pin drop. So, with this experience safely behind me, I headed home, confident that I wouldn't be hearing from One Life to Live. But here I am.\"\n\nHillary Bailey Smith was born in Massachusetts and raised in Palm Beach, Florida. She returned to Massachusetts to attend boarding school.
