        "meta_description": "Hillary B. Smith, who plays Nora Buchanan on ABC Daytime's \"One Life to Live,\" stops by BuzzWorthy Radio to chat about Venice, OLTL, and Fumbling thru the Pieces.\n\nSmith attended Dana Hall School, Pine Manor College and Sarah Lawrence College. At Sarah Lawrence as a senior, she performed in off Broadway and Broadway productions, including The Heidi Chronicles.\n\nSmith began her on-screen career in the genre of daytime drama, starring in the role of Kit McCormick on The Doctors (1982), and one year later, taking over the role of Margo Montgomery Hughes on As the World Turns, a role she would play from 1983 to 1989.\n\nShe married Philip Webster Smith III in 1983. They have two children, a daughter, Courtney and a son, Philip (who originated the role of Margo's son, Adam Munson). After taking maternity leave from acting after the birth in 1988 to her son, Smith returned to daytime television, originating the role of Llanview District Attorney Nora Hanen Buchanan on ABC's One Life to Live, a character she has played since 1992. Almost immediately after her debut, Smith, in the role of Nora, became a centerpiece of the show, particularly for her involvement in the OLTL multiple-Emmy Award winning Marty Saybrooke rape trial storyline.",
