County District Attorney George Gascón and interim police chief Dominic Choi. The suspects charged with Wactor’s murder are Robert Barceleau and Sergio Estrada, both 18.\n\nThe most serious charge is for Barceleau, who was charged with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of killing in the commission of a robbery, which could lead to a life-without-parole prison term. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both with allegations he was armed with a firearm.\n\nEstrada, was also charged with murder, but without the special circumstance allegation. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both also allegedly while armed with a firearm. Estrada is also facing a life sentence.\n\nThe two other suspects were also formally charged, Leonel Gutierrez, also 18 was charged with attempted robbery and grand theft by embezzlement, both with allegations he was armed. Meanwhile, Frank Olano, 22, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the killing, along with receiving stolen property and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Barceleau, Estrada and Gutierrez remain in custody in lieu of $2 million bail each, while Olano must post a $1 million bail.\n\nWactor was killed May 25 in the early morning hours in downtown Los Angeles after his shift as a bartender at the Level 8 bar/restaurant. He, and co-worker, Anita Joy were walking to their cars, when Wactor came upon the thieves trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle and was shot in the chest and died in Joy’s arms.\n\nSo, are you glad Johnny’s murderers have been officially charged?
