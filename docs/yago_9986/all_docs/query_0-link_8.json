        "text": "BO BUCHANAN\n\nPLAYED BY ROBERT S. WOODS\n\n(1979 - PRESENT)\n\nBo Buchanan is the youngest son of Asa Buchanan and brother of Clint. Currently, Bo is Llanview's Police Commissioner, but he has had a varied career as a Green Beret, Oilman, TV Producer for Fraternity Row, as well as a Newspaperman, Racecar driver and Music mogul.\n\nSince coming to Llanview in 1980 to join his father Asa in running the East Coast division of Buchanan Enterprises Bo has suffered many personal losses. Bo's relationship with Asa has often been rocky because they have very different ideas of right and wrong. Bo quickly became alienated by his father's devious business practices. Bo had a major business coup when he bought Lone Star Records out from under his father, Asa and managed the career of Becky Lee Abbott, a promising young country-western singer.\n\nHis first Llanview love interest was TV talk show host Pat Ashley whom he took to Paris on a romantic trip - OLTL's first overseas location shoot. In 1983, he fell in love with Delila Ralston, but they decided not to pursue a romantic relationship after his mother's deathbed confession that Bo's father was not Asa Buchanan, but Yancy Ralston which meant Bo and Delila were cousins.\n\nDelila married Bo's father, and Bo slept with Becky Lee Abbott, who became pregnant with his son, Drew. Later Bo and Delila discovered they weren't really related, and they decided to get married. but, Bo divorced Delila in 1984. Wanting to escape to a more normal life, Bo took a job working in the Lord-Manning factory under the fake name \"Bill Brady\". He became involved with the O'Neill family and dated the eldest daughter, Didi O'Neill. Didi was injured in a car accident and went blind, and Bo proposed to Didi. She became his wife in 1985.\n\nLater in 1985, Bo, a former Green Beret, left for Vietnam in search of MIA's. In 1988, Bo and Didi were held hostage in England while Patrick London assumed Bo's identity in Llanview by using plastic surgery to make himself look like Bo. Unfortunately, while being held hostage, Bo's wife, Didi was electrocuted, and died in Bo's arms. In 1990, he married Sarah Gordon, who was kidnapped by Carlo Hesser and presumed dead in a plane crash. While searching for Sarah, Bo was almost seduced by a federal agent, Alex Olanov who was obsessed with Bo and stalked his fianc√©e, reporter Cassie Callison. . In 1991, he married Cassie, but he was still in love with his missing wife, Sarah. Just after Bo and Cassie said their \"I do's\", Sarah made an appearance. Bo stayed married to Cassie, out of a sense of honor and duty but eventually he and Sarah reconnected and Cassie had their brief marriage annulled.\n\nSarah's death from a hit and run accident in 1992 left Bo desperately sad and depressed to the point that he considered committing suicide. Nora Hanen Gannon, the attorney for Sarah's estate eased Bo's pain and loss. Bo and Nora became engaged in 1993, but their wedding was delayed while Nora was operated on for a brain tumor. After the surgery, Nora was temporarily blind, and was stalked and threatened by her former client, convicted rapist Todd Manning, who had an axe to grind with Nora. Bo rescued Nora, brought her back to Llanview where she was operated on once again, and her sight was restored.\n\nOn June 1, 1995, Nora became Nora Hannen Gannon Buchanan when she married Bo in a rock-and-roll themed wedding, presided over by legendary rocker, Little Richard.\n\nNever one to stay idle for long in 1996, Bo joined Patrick Thornhart to defeat a group of Irish terrorists known as the Men of 21. Bo assumed the identity of Major Austin, a munitions expert and penetrated the organization but was almost killed by a double-crossing agent. Suffering from a gunshot wound, Patrick left his sickbed and helped Bo diffuse a bomb at The Palace, the hotel and restaurant owned and managed by Renee Divine Buchanan, Bo's most recent stepmother.\n\nIn 1998, Georgie Phillips came to town as Nora's personal assistant. Georgie quickly insinuated herself into Bo and Nora's lives in every way possible with the intention of breaking them up. Georgie also tried to make Bo jealous of Nora's professional relationship with her old lover, Sam Rappaport by making it seem that there was more than just friendship between them.\n\nGeorgie failed to seduce Bo so she worked to convince his stepdaughter, Rachel Gannon that Bo was the married man she had been seeing. Bo gave Georgie an ultimatum and told her she had one week to get out of Llanview. Georgie then digitally altered a photo of herself and Bo to make it look like they were in Bo and Nora's bed together making love. Georgie then demanded that Bo meet her at the Buchanan lodge. Nora also went to the lodge and assumed the worst when she saw Georgie kissing a man in the shadows. A short time later, Georgie was discovered murdered. Nora suspected that Bo had slept with Georgie, but he was eventually able to make her believe the truth and they reconciled.\n\nEvidence pointed to Bo and he became the prime suspect in Georgie's murder. Bo was thrilled when his son Drew returned to town and graduated at the top of his class at the police academy.\n\nDrew confessed to Bo that he had been having an affair with Georgie and that he was the father of the baby she had been carrying when she was killed. Drew insisted to Bo that he hadn't killed Georgie. In the hope of giving his son, more time to find the real killer, Bo shocked his friends and family when he confessed to killing Georgie. At this same time, Todd's Buchanan paranoia and his persecution complex kicked in and was convinced the Buchanans were trying to pin Georgie's murder on him. To clear himself and make the real killer confess Todd held all the possible suspects hostage at the lodge. When it looked as though Kevin was going to kill Todd, Rachel came forward and confessed to killing Georgie. Bo and Nora were shocked, but they presented a united front to defend Rachel.\n\nLater on, Bo was devastated when his only son, Drew was shot and killed by Nurse Barbara Graham in 1998. Once again grieving a serious loss, Bo took off on his boat in the middle of a violent storm and it seemed he would die at sea. Using a ham radio, Nora contacted Bo and lied, telling him that she was pregnant. This gave Bo the will to live and he returned to Llanview, but was hospitalized with a serious case of pneumonia. At this same time, Sam Rappaport's jealous ex-wife, Lindsay altered the results of Bo's fertility tests to make it look like Bo couldn't father more children. Nora was distressed to that Bo couldn't father a child and wanted to tell him that she wasn't pregnant, but things spiraled out of control. Nora didn't want to break Bo's heart with the news they wouldn't be having a baby. Desperate to get pregnant, Nora turned to her former lover, Sam. After his initial refusal, Nora and Sam slept together with the hope of getting Nora pregnant. Nora became pregnant and she planned on raising the baby as hers and Bo's.\n\nLindsay saw Sam and Nora go into the cabana and was consumed with jealousy and resentment that, Nora, the woman who seemed to have it all, including the love of Lindsay's ex-husband, was going to also have Sam's baby. At the Woman of the Year Awards, Lindsay showed up drunk and revealed that Nora was really carrying Sam's baby. Bo moved out on Nora, although they were both pained by the separation.\n\nSeveral months later, Nora learned the truth about Bo's fertility tests and realized baby Matthew might be his son after all. Nora then decided to have Matthew's DNA tested, but Lindsay bribed the lab technician into making sure Sam stayed Matthew's father.\n\nWith his marriage to Nora over, but unwilling to admit he still had deep, unresolved feelings for her, Bo started a relationship with Lindsay Rappaport. Lindsay's constantly tested Bo's patience because of her lack of self-esteem and her resentment of his ex-wife, but Bo seemed to truly care for her and they planned to get married on Valentine's Day this year. Lindsay found out she was pregnant by Bo and she planned to tell him the happy news on their wedding night.\n\nAs Bo and Lindsay were about to exchange wedding vows, Nora entered St. James church and told Bo the truth about Lindsay tampering with the results of his fertility test. Lindsay confessed her deceitfulness to Bo and also said she was pregnant with his child. Bo refused to believe that Lindsay was pregnant and she gave him back his ring. Bo and Lindsay's relationship was over but Bo was also furious with Nora and questioned why she had exposed Lindsay's secret on what was supposed to have been his wedding day. Bo remained distanced from Lindsay and harbored resentments towards Nora.\n\nBo was upset by all the shocking news shared with him by both Nora and Lindsay. One night he found himself at Rodi's and RJ Gannon was there as well. RJ started harassing Bo, who had reached his breaking point and began punching RJ relentlessly. RJ accused Bo of police brutality and Bo stormed off into the night. Bo hopped on his motorcycle and ended up at a roadhouse outside of Llanview. Bo met a beautiful unknown woman, who later turned out to be Dr. Melanie McIver, Lindsay's sister. Melanie accidentally ran over Bo's motorcycle in the parking lot and came in to confess. After Bo initially shared his anger about his mangled motorcycle, Bo and Melanie, who was also feeling despondent over her marriage, ended up having a one night affair fling before he returned home to get his life back in order.\n\nAfter Will Rappaport's trial Bo and Nora were on the same train taking Will to Statesville Prison Nora asked Bo forgive her for ruining his wedding and interfering in his relationship with Lindsay. Bo still had deep and unresolved feelings for Nora, but he couldn't forgive what she had done. Later, the train derailed and Nora was trapped in the wreckage. Bo desperately tried to rescue Nora but was unable to free her. After going to get more help, Bo was devastated when he returned to see the car Nora was trapped in engulfed in an explosion. Nora was presumed to have died in the fire and Bo was consumed with guilt for not granting her his forgiveness when she had asked for it."
