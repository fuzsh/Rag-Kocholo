        "text": "Wednesday, December 24, 2008 12:54 AM EST | By Scotty Gore\n\n(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — With a huge new storyline for his character in the offing, Eddie Alderson has been placed on contract with “One Life to Live.”\n\nSince 2001, Eddie Alderson has played the squeaky clean Matthew Buchanan, son of Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan and District Attorney Nora Hanen. Seldom seen outside of family gatherings and holidays, Matthew wasn’t much more than a background character. But all that is about to change as Matthew enters the realm of Llanview High School. Facing puberty and peer pressure, the young Buchanan teen looks to have a rather stressful freshman year of high school.\n\nWith the start of Matthew’s big storyline getting underway in early 2009, fans can expect to see more of the 14-year-old Alderson. So much more in fact that a spokesperson for “OLTL” has announced that the younger Alderson, who is the kid brother of co-star Kristen Alderson (Starr Manning), has been signed to a contract with the daytime sudser.\n\nWhile we can’t give specifics of Alderson’s upcoming storyline, SON can tell you that Matthew will be dealing with some typical teenage problems, including being offered drugs. In addition, “OLTL” is in the process of casting other teens that will interact with Matthew in the coming months. Among them are an adversary named Justis and an admirer named Becca. Also, Michelle Robinson makes another appearance as the Llanview High Principal on January 13th.\n\n“One Life to Live” airs Weekdays on ABC. Weeknights on SOAPnet. Check local listings."
