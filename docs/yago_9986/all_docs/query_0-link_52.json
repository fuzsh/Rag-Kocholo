        "text": "ONE LIFE TO LIVE’s Nora has been in a coma since mid-October, and much has happened in the small (but certainly not dull) town of Llanview. No doubt her friends and family will bring her up to speed, but who knows what kind of spin they will put on events? So, in the spirit of truth, justice and the American way, Soap Opera Weekly is offering Nora the Cliffs Notes version of what went down during her involuntary time off.\n\nDear Nora,\n\nYou must familiarize yourself with two words: Spencer Truman.\n\nPractically single-handed, this handsome, charming, egocentric and extremely skilled surgeon has dissected the lives of many Llanview residents. Though details of his real motives remain fuzzy, Spencer seems to be intent on destroying the Buchanan family. He has a connection of some sort to Asa. Spencer left him a photo of a blonde woman that gave Asa a heart attack! Now that you, dear Nora, have come back, Spencer will have lost a little control of his life — but only a little.\n\nTodd went through a living (and dying) hell while you were sleeping. He was arrested, prosecuted and convicted in the death of Margaret Cochran and her son Todd Jr. Your galpal Evangeline did her best to save her client, and was one of the few people who watched (okay, she didn’t exactly watch, but more on that later) him put to death. In the nick of time, John showed up with Margaret alive and well. Spencer brought Todd back to life. You will probably be involved in some of the fallout from this crisis. Todd lost a lot during these months, including his fiancée, Blair, to — you guessed it — Spencer.\n\nYour friend Evangeline has missed you terribly. In addition to losing Todd’s case, she broke up with John. What else did she lose? Oh, right, her sight. She was in the church for Michael and Marcie’s wedding when a tornado hit and the church collapsed. Cris has been by her side, and it appears they’re becoming more than friends.\n\nCris, you ask? Wasn’t he…er, dead? Well, no. During your absence, we all learned that the man at Statesville was not John Doe, but actually Cris. This came as a big surprise to many, most notably Cris’ widow, Natalie. There was a big hostage showdown at the prison; Carlo Hesser was involved. Fortunately, justice prevailed. Cris is now a free man, though Natalie has chosen John over him.\n\nYour son Matthew has also missed you terribly. He did get close to Bo’s new girlfriend, Paige, though that relationship hit the rocks when Paige kept secrets from Bo — secrets that involved her ex-husband, one Spencer Truman. Bo almost died when he was shot during the Statesville riots, but a fab surgeon saved his life. Yes, Spencer Truman.\n\nYour former in-laws, the Buchanans, had a rough winter. Jessica and Tess (her alter) struggled for control. Tess just gave birth to Nash’s daughter, Brennan. (This story adds a whole new dimension to “Who’s the daddy/mommy” problems.) Jessica is facing her childhood abuse, and Nash and Antonio are both on tenterhooks wondering what will happen once the Jessica/Tess integration is complete.\n\nDorian and David almost got married, but David broke it off at the last second. Apparently David’s brother (yup, Spencer Truman) threatened to tell Dorian that David had committed murder many years ago. Though this was later explained to Dorian, it didn’t save the relationship. Dorian has set her sights on Clint, which isn’t making Viki happy. It was revealed that David had shot John McBain’s father, Thomas McBain, who also was a cop. Paige was a drunken intern who was in the operating room when Thomas was being treated. She screwed up, and Thomas died. And Spencer covered up the whole thing.\n\nThough you probably were not aware of this, many people came to visit you, including Bo, Evangeline, RJ, and even Lindsay popped by, if only to monitor the level of RJ’s attentiveness to you. You know Lindsay; jealously runs through her veins like blood.\n\nAs for the big events, you missed a wedding, a tornado and a funeral. As we mentioned, Marcie and Michael wed, a tornado destroyed the church and collapsed the rectory. That was bad enough, but inside the rectory, Kelly and Duke were making love. Duke died as a result of his injuries, but Kelly survived. (Guess who did the surgery…?)\n\nAs a result of all this drama — and the fact that he’s sterile — Kevin has been drinking a lot. Fortunately, Clint has been there for his son, but all the stuff with Jessica has taken up a lot of his time. It’s good to see Clint, though. His time in Springfield did him well.\n\nAnd, finally, there’s Spencer Truman. Though everyone suspects he’s been behind many recent tragedies, there is no evidence to prove it. Yet…."
