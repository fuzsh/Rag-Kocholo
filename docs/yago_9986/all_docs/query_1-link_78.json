        "text": "It is what you think it is. A series of chapters in which our friendly neighborhood Spidey gets laid by several women from across the DC and Marvel universes. I might add some other fandoms in here for future chapters, but I haven't decided yet..\n\nFeel free to leave suggestions in the comments, and I'll see what I can do about them.\n\nCinematic Universes not included.\n\n(WORK IN PROGRESS)\n\nNot me, but make it the wild west.\n\nGumpa runs a saloon, the gang are outlaws (but for the betterment of society obvi), and White's a run away from the twin's father's ranch. Tawi runs a dangerous gold mine and is threatening to take over trade routes in the region. Can the gang take him down or will they go down guns blazing?\n\nAll thanks to the August 2024 Country prompt list by the wonderful allourheroes and TitanPandora.\n\nPandemics are fairly common in human history; every hundred or so years, a disease wipes out a decent chunk of humanity, then it phases out and humanity moves on. In recent centuries, pandemics have proved to be mere hiccups on population graphs, with advances in science allowing for effective treatments to be developed within months. There was no way a mere virus could end the world in this day and age.\n\nOr at least that’s what Izuku thought until the world ended four years ago. Now humanity has to adapt to a new world where they are no longer at the top of the food chain, and for the past four years, Izuku has considered himself to be pretty good at it. Despite the extenuating circumstances, he and his mother have been able to live in relative peace—that is, until his world is turned upside down once again and he and his mother are forced to flee their sanctuary. Will Izuku be able to adapt to the apocalypse’s challenges one final time while keeping the one he loves safe?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nyou're finally getting your dream job, working with some of the best dancers in the business, but a job change means a break in your healthcare coverage and suppressants these days are expensive. going into heat at the studio pretty much seems like the worst case scenario, but you find yourself in the care of two alphas who won't let you go through it alone.\n\nAfter being sent home to the Human Realm for the second time, Cayrie makes a big move to further her study in magic. It's sure to be interesting with Solomon as her teacher, and she's in for a big surprise when she settles into her new home in NYC.\n\nWill she succeed in passing the Sorcerer's trials? Only time will tell.\n\n**Covers S3 (Ch.41-60) of OG Obey Me\n\nSynopsis: Imagine if every story that has ever been written or even just imagined was based on a real Universe or Reality. Kyle Cinagra is a lonely little boy, born from the dreams of Higher Dimensional beings. With the power of the Dreamscape, he can scour through different Planes, Dimensions and Universes to achieve his goals...\n\n[This story has about 680 chapters written thus far. The first actual sex scene is around chapter 200-ish. Though there are some other sexual scenes and descriptions of nudity, et cetera, throughout the story. If you want to be spoiled, you can look at the tags and relationship tags, though I ran out of 'room' to add more tags, so there are a lot of things left out.]\n\nWritten by Darth Cinagra\n\n\"Do you want me to walk you to your common room?\"\n\n\"No, it's fine. I know the way back.” Luna smiled.\n\nHarry looked at her face. That wasn’t his point but he decided not to push. \"Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.\"\n\nLuna nodded, \"I can't wait. Again, thank you.\"\n\n\"Good night, Luna.\"\n\n\"Good night, Harry Potter.\"\n\nAnd like that, they went on their separate directions.\n\nWhen Ethan Hart is sent to the Bang-a-Rang to await help from Doris, he doesn't expect to fall in love with Matty, the River Phoenix who recruits him.\n\nWhen Matty recruits Ethan, he never expects new feelings to arise for anyone other than Johnson, the revelation hitting much too soon after a betrayal from months ago sent him spiraling.\n\nWhen Johnson sees his lover start to feel for someone else, he tries to put a stop to it before he loses him forever, but does he really have to? Do they all even want that, and can a promise be held and strengthened instead of broken for once?\n\nPart 2 of You Make Me Wanna Stay, this is a complete canon rewrite of season 1 strictly from the Phoenixes' POVs, following the three as a previous relationship is tested, and their new relationship is challenged at every turn as Ethan discovers what it means to be loved by Matty and Johnson while his loyalty to Doris wavers.\n\nTalented violinist Wren Cotter is scouted for a transfer from her university to an elite private academy. All seems good and well until she meets her fellow students. Vampires and magic? Such things may seem intimidating, yet Wren continues to stay true to herself and strive to become a renowned composer, doing everything in her power to ignore the fact that she now lives in a den of supernatural beings. Though as the days go by, she gets closer to those around her, eventually finding herself receiving the attention of four vampires who are inexplicably drawn to her.\n\nThe Immortal Quartet is a NA LGBTQ+ paranormal romance novel, with big emphasis on the G and T in LGBTQ+, that touches on topics like polyamory and pansexuality, trauma and familial relationships, self-discovery and a sprinkle of gender dysphoria. Follow Wren's journey as she struggles to develop trust and falls in love amidst fluff and humor filled encounters, helping herself and her loved ones recover from trauma.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished. As Umi discovers when she rescues Shiomi. Neither Shiomi nor the jealous, vengeful ghost that stalks her appreciates the act. Something they both make clear. As for Ume’s partner, Tomo, he is less than thrilled at the intrusion of an unpleasant third into their relationship. “I know I told you to find someone who would appreciate your advances, but I really question your taste.”\n\nPercy shows up at camp and becomes the resident Himbo. He's hot, he's got a big dick and all the girls are interested in him and with his Greek God parentage he's got enough libido to keep up with all of them. Every chapter that isn't the prologue/epilogue will be smut. Come for the smut stay for the little bit of plot. All characters are 18+ and none of this is cannon\n\nJames Potter is ready to abandon his intimidating reputation—and finally move on from his insane infatuation with that persnickety, ginger prig. Lily Evans is not the same person she was before the summer holiday and is willing to set her differences aside regarding that snobbish, buggering toadstool in order to please her new best friend. Sirius Black broke an oath, repeatedly, and will stop at nothing to keep the other Marauders & his ex-lover from learning the truth. Marlene McKinnon, god dammit, is reinventing herself as someone entirely separate from her childhood best friend, James Potter, and the mystery bloke that broke her heart. Remus Lupin is an unforgivable monster who doesn’t deserve to be loved. Emmeline Fitzgerald has been in love with Remus Lupin since the fourth year. Peter Pettigrew is accustomed to hiding his true self from his closest friends. And Mary Macdonald does not know her true self outside of gossip, drama, and a toxic relationship. Beginning at the start of sixth year and told from multiple POVs, Secrets May As Well Be Lies is a melodramatic, mostly-canon, and comedic tale of how the Potters fell in love—and the inevitable, tumultuous downfall of those they love most."
