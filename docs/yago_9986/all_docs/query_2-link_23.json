        "text": "By\n\nGH Executive producer, Frank Valentini promised an exciting announcement today and he delivered one less than an hour ago.\n\nValentini, through a video on his Twitter account shared the news that Daytime Emmy winner, Hillary B. Smith is coming to General Hospital as Nora Buchanan! Smith played Nora on One Life to Live for many years, from 1992-2012 and again in 2013 on Prospect Park’s online reboot of the series.\n\nFrom the looks of the video teaser, Nora Hanen Gannon Buchanan will be counsel to someone in need of expert legal advice! Could she end up actually prosecuting or defending Franco (Roger Howarth)? If so, this would not be the first time that Smith and Howarth have worked together in an on-screen legal courtroom battle. For Smith, won her Emmy for Nora trying to bring Todd to justice for the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) on One Life.\n\nWith the hiring of Smith, this is the first time since the rights to One Life to Live are back with ABC that GH has been able to utilize a character from the beloved soap opera since the protracted legal battle with Prospect Park. There is no word yet as to how long Smith will be staying in Port Charles, if its for a guest-star arc, recurring, or on contract is yet to be revealed.\n\nWatch the video annoucement featuring Rebecca Budig (Hayden) of Smith coming to GH as Nora Buchanan here.
