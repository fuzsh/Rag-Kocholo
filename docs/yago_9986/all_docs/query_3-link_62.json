        "text": "As much as we love the zoo and all our area parks, when temperatures push past 90 degrees, many of us are ready to head indoors. Of course, the movies are an option, as is bowling, and even playgrounds at malls still exist (and are free).\n\nBut when you want something a little different, we have you covered. Here are some ideas on where to take the kids for indoor fun during St. Louis’ summers. This list is by no means exhaustive, so let us know your favorite spots. Note: There is a fee associated with most of these places.\n\nUnion Station and the Aquarium\n\nFrom the minute your kids arrive at Union Station, they will feel like they are on a vacation. Start with a tram ride. A driver picks you up at your car and tells jokes on the way to the entrance of the St. Louis Aquarium, which opened in 2019.\n\nInside, the nods to historic Union Station are evident, from the gorgeous grand lobby to the fish swimming inside a tank made to look like the clock face on the Union Station tower. Kids will love “Journey” in the train car with its digital “windows” and fun narration by John Goodman. Then the real fun begins: otters, tanks where you can touch jellyfish (or just watch them, mesmerized), stingrays and more sea life. There’s a kids area where they can blow off steam and then the highlight: the sharks. A 250,000-gallon tank — the aquarium’s largest — holds 60 sharks and stingrays and other fish. The daily talks offered there entertain and educate.\n\nAfter the aquarium, Union Station has several other indoor activities to entertain kids: there is a mirror maze, a selfie studio and a ropes course with a zipline. Heck, even the cars on the Ferris wheel are indoors and air-conditioned for the brave.\n\nAnd don’t forget to stop in at the Soda Fountain. Kids will love the candy emporium in there as well as the Freak Shakes. You know the ones, piled high with nonsense like a Pop-Tart, brownie or kaleidoscopic lollipop.\n\nCity Foundry\n\nMuch like the aquarium, the City Foundry offers several indoor attractions in one. First, visitors will love being able to choose their own restaurant from among the 17 inside the food hall. There’s even a life-size chess board where kids can play.\n\nHave lunch there before you hit the big indoor attractions: Puttshack, the Museum of Illusions and Sandbox VR. At Puttshack, you don’t need to keep score of your minigolf game because some magic inside the balls tracks your putts for you. It’s all very high tech, and kids will get a kick out of the course’s special effects. Sandbox VR lets you explore six immersive VR worlds with your friends. You can visit space, a haunted mansion and more. Nothing is as it seems at the Museum of Illusions, which opened in May. Illusions include one that makes a person look very tall and another person look very short or one that makes it look like you’re doing a handstand on a table at a local diner.\n\nThe Armory and other social houses\n\nSure, the Armory is, basically, a big giant bar, and the crowd is definitely more adult most of the time, but until 6 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, kids are welcome with an adult. And admission is free during that time. With 250,000 square feet of space, there is plenty of room for eating and drinking as well as games such as corn hole, giant chess, giant checkers, horseshoes, table tennis, washers and much more. There’s even a slide and a see-saw in addition to arcade games plus duckpin bowling. This concept (mostly free games and food and drink) is repeated at a variety of social houses throughout St. Louis, such as Westport Social and Dogwood Social in Ellisville; O’Fallon, Missouri; and O’Fallon, Illinois. Check age requirements before you go.\n\nIndoor amusement parks\n\nThere are a handful of places in the region that offer everything from bumper cars to laser tag to video games and much more. We’ll call them indoor amusement parks. Some of our favorites are Amp Up Action Park in Town and Country, which has go-karts, axe throwing, a ropes course and more; Main Event in Chesterfield, which adds laser tag, bowling and a ropes course to its array of video games; the Edge in Belleville, with laser tag, go-karts, bumper cars, VR rides and bowling; Incredible Pizza Company in Sappington, which has rides to go along with its go-karts and bumper cars; and Kokomo Joe’s in St. Peters, which has kiddie rides, escape rooms, bowling, go-karts and more. Just opened last fall, Joe Edwards’ Magic Mini Golf in the Loop has whimsical holes, some of which have St. Louis or Delmar Loop themes. You’ll also find a Ferris wheel, pinball and more.\n\nVideo games\n\nYes, you are trying to get your kids off their devices, but pinball and some old-fashioned arcade games offer something a little different. The Soda Museum in St. Charles has a basement full of pinball machines. Two Plumbers Brewery + Arcade in St. Charles allows kids to play its games from noon to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Dave & Busters in Maryland Heights is like Chuck E. Cheese for grownups and older kids. For that matter, don’t discount the fun kids have at Chuck E. Cheese (locations in Fairview Heights, South County, St. Charles and Ellisville). And kids can completely get off screens at Pieces Board Game Bar and Cafe in Soulard with shelves and shelves of board games, new and classic.\n\nTrampoline parks\n\nGive kids a trampoline, and you’ve got hours of fun and a lot of energy burned. When SkyZone opened in Chesterfield nearly 20 years ago, it started a trend. Now you can find locations in Fenton, Fairview Heights, Ballwin, and soon Shrewsbury and O’Fallon, Missouri. Other trampoline parks include Altitude Trampoline Park in Glen Carbon; Bounce U in Chesterfield and South St. Louis County; Rockin’ Jump in Brentwood, Shrewsbury and O’Fallon, Missouri; and Urban Air Adventure Park in Sunset Hills and Cottleville.\n\nPlay museums\n\nWhen you want kids to burn off energy, but playgrounds are just too hot, try play places such as City Museum, the St. Louis Science Center and the Magic House. The National Museum of Transportation has indoor exhibits and a kids play area with loads of train tables. All are iconic St. Louis destinations every kid should experience at some time. But there are other, smaller play museums, too. There’s Play Street Museum at the Streets of St. Charles, Myseum in Town and Country and the Edwardsville Children’s Museum in Edwardsville. Try Slick City, the new slide place in Chesterfield or Ultimate Ninjas in Chesterfield, with a variety of obstacle courses. And while it’s not the sort of place you would usually think of playing, the St. Louis Art Museum offers Family Sundays with a theme and an art project.\n\nIce skating\n\nMost rinks in the area are open for summer with open skates, and all rinks are brrrr cold, so when it’s so hot you can’t seem to cool down, they are a perfect place to go. Our favorites include the Centene Community Ice Center in Maryland Heights and the St. Peters Rec-Plex. See our guide to area ice rinks here. Roller or inline rinks in the area are another option.\n\nEscape rooms\n\nOlder kids will love escape rooms, in which a group of people are locked in a room requiring them to solve a series of puzzles within a certain amount of time to find the key to unlock the room. These are great for families, but do typically require advanced registration. At Escape the Room downtown, kids 10 and over can play with adults so long as it’s a private party or 14-and-older can play in any room with a chaperone. Mastermind Room Escape, with locations downtown and in St. Charles, are recommended for ages 8 and up and feature such rooms as “Cursed Castle” and “Stadium Scare.” At St. Louis Escape, also downtown, the recommended age is 12 and up.\n\nIndoor pickleball\n\nPickleball is all the rage, and even young kids are getting involved. We saw a variety of pickleball summer camps, and now kids can continue their play. St. Louis offers a number of indoor facilities: Padel + Pickle in Olivette has eight pickleball courts and six padel courts, which are somewhat larger. Chicken N Pickle in St. Charles has six indoor courts. Padel Up in Lake Saint Lous offers Junior Pickleball on its indoor courts for ages 8-12 on Wednesdays and Missouri Pickleball Club has junior play on Mondays on its indoor courts. Many rec centers and YMCAs also offer pickleball and other indoor sports.\n\nLibraries\n\nThough most items on this list have a cost associated with them, libraries offer entertainments for kids free of charge. Even small branches, like the Kisker branch of the St. Charles City-County Library, have smart boards for kids to draw on and play tables. At the newly open Clark Family branch of the St. Louis County Library, the Stephany and Richard Kniep Children’s Space features a large playhouse, a fire engine and other interactive learning activities. A teen space offers a 3D printer, recording studio and games. The St. Louis Public Library’s Barr, Central and Julia Davis branches offer digital maker space for free. Nearly all branches and small local libraries offer some type of kids programming, from story times to playdates.\n\nGame Show Battle Rooms\n\nA place unlike any other, though it definitely requires some forethought and a reservation, Game Show Battle Rooms in Chesterfield offers a chance for you and a group of friends to participate in live-action games, such as their version of “Family Feud” and “The Price is Right.” You’ll need a group of at least six people, and though it is recommended kids be 10 and up, playing with adults, Battle Rooms now offers a kids show with questions designed for kids 10-15.\n\nStay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nAmy Bertrand\n\nFeatures editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
