        "text": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers are sad to announce that Kristen Alderson’s Brother, Eddie Alderson, of One Life To Live, has cancer. General Hospital spoilers reveal the shocking news we have learned today. Kristen Alderson’s (ex- Kiki Jerome, (GH), ex- Starr Manning, OLTL) twenty-two-year-old brother, Eddie has been diagnosed with lymphoma cancer on Friday, and is immediately beginning chemotherapy; his sister Kristen never leaving his side.\n\nEddie is trying to keep things upbeat and with keeping a positive attitude. He admits that the journey will not be an easy one, announcing on his Instagram that together with friends and family, he will beat this.\n\n“Just a bump in the road on this crazy ride we call life!”\n\nFans of ABC’s One Life to Live will remember Eddie in his role of Matthew Buchanan from 2001 to 2012. Son of the beloved couple Nora Hanen (Hillary B. Smith) and Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods), a role that earned him two nominations for Young Artist Daytime Emmy Award.\n\nHe isn’t the first OLTL actor/actress to share publicly that they are fighting cancer. Three months ago, Kassie DePaiva (ex- Eve Larson, (Days), ex- Blair Cramer, (OLTL) shared that she has Acute Myeloid Leukemia.\n\nBoth General Hospital’s Kristen Alderson and her brother, Eddie promise to keep fans up-to-date on his illness and treatment. All of us here at CDL are hoping for the best, and wish Eddie the best as he travels through this difficult health journey. Eddie and his family, the Aldersons will remain in our thoughts. We will report any updates on this story and more as soon as possible."
