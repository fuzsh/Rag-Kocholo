        "text": "At the end of the last chapter, Bo surprised Nora by telling her they would be making a trip to Chicago to ring in the New Year...\n\nChapter Eleven\n\nNow all he needs is a hat! Lenny Hanen said to his little granddaughter. Where is his hat? Let me see \n\nNora plopped the snowmans hat onto Lillis head while Len wasnt looking.\n\nWhen he turned around he asked, Have you seen my snowmans hat, Miss Lilli?\n\nShe giggled, snowflakes swirling about her cherub face.\n\nAh...you have! Let Saba (Grandpa) lift you up  He lifted her high in his arms. Now put the hat on our snowman.\n\nLilli planted the brown suede hat on the snowmans frosty head.\n\nGood job! Look at that! Isnt he handsome? You made your very first snowman!\n\nLilli grinned from ear to ear her blue eyes shining.\n\nIt was the last week of December, and Nora had been spending a few days with her parents in Chicago while Bo was in Llanview, Pennsylvania on BE business. He had dropped her off a few days prior but was expected back today.\n\nAre you getting cold, Sweetie? Nora asked. Why dont we go in. Savta is making hot cocoa for us.\n\nWhats dat? Lilli asked.\n\nLen looked at Nora in shock. My poor grandchild doesnt even know what hot cocoa is?!\n\nWell, Dad, we live in Texas. Its hardly the climate for hot cocoa even in the winter. Then she explained to Lilli, Hot cocoa is like chocolate milk only its warm.\n\nLilli was not impressed. I wanna ride da sled, she said wriggling to get down from Grandpas arms.\n\nNora looked at her. Arent you cold, Lilli? Your cheeks are getting pink.\n\nLilli grabbed Lens hand and pulled him toward the sled. Come on, Saba.\n\nLen looked at Nora. Go on inside. Ill bring her in soon, he said quietly.\n\nNora didnt argue. As her father pulled Lilli on the sled, she slipped into the welcoming warmth of the house and the comforting aroma of Selmas kitchen. Selma handed her a mug of hot cocoa while they watched Len playing with Lilli through the window.\n\nNora smiled. Dad has to be freezing, she commented. Hes just going to have to tell her that play time is over and bring her in.\n\nOh, Len is loving this. He was always the one who played with you girls in the snow if you remember.\n\nI remember, Nora said fondly. And he would stay out with me longer because Susanna would get cold and come in early. She wasn't very hardy as I recall.\n\nSelma laughed. Well, at least you had a sister. I cant help it if she wasnt as rugged as you. Thats what Lilli needs...a sibling to play with. Have you thought about that?\n\nYes, Mom, Nora began the conversation she knew would eventually arise and had been dreading. But before she could be questioned any further, she heard an Anybody home? echoing from the front foyer.\n\nBo! She quickly put down her mug and ran through the kitchen and into the foyer where she found her husband brushing the snow off his hat and coat.\n\nHey! she said throwing her arms around his neck kissing him.\n\nHe laughed and met her kisses with his own. Here. Just a minute. Let me get this wet coat off. He hung it on the hall tree then pulled her back into his arms. Mmmm...Ive missed you, he whispered kissing her.\n\nIve missed you too, she whispered back melting against him. After a very warm greeting he asked, Wheres my girl?\n\nShes in the backyard playing with Grandpa. In fact, come with me, she said pulling him by the hand to the back door. You can save the poor soul. Hes probably half frozen but doesnt want to make Lilli come in.\n\nNora opened the door and Bo poked his head out, Lillikins!\n\nDaaddyyy!!! she shouted scrambling off the sled and to the door. Bo scooped her into his arms.\n\nHey! Hows my girl?! Daddy missed you! he said holding her close.\n\nLook at my snowman, Daddy!\n\nI see! Thats a great snowman! Did Grandpa help? he asked helping her off with her boots and snow clothes.\n\nA lil bit...but mostly I made im, Lilli answered as Lenny gave her an incredulous look that sent the others into gales of laughter.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nBo turned the radio knob trying to tune in a station as they drove to Salvadore's the next evening. It was New Years Eve. Rita and Vinnie had invited all the old neighbors to a party to ring in the year 1948.\n\nFinally lyrics to a song floated above the static\n\nMaybe its much too early in the game\n\nAh, but I thought Id ask you just the same\n\nBo reached for Noras hand and sang the few lyrics he knew to the song What are you doing New Years, New Years Eve?\n\nThis is a new song, he told her. Have you heard it?\n\nNo, I havent, she answered.\n\nThe song continued...\n\nWonder whose arms will hold you good and tight\n\nwhen its exactly twelve oclock at night\n\nwelcoming in the New Year, New Years Eve\n\nI heard it quite a bit on my drive back from Llanview, Bo said. I like it...made me think of you. He glanced her way and she smiled.\n\nDaddy, Lillis voiced piped from the backseat. Do dey have kids to play with?\n\nThey have a little boy. Hes younger than you, but Im sure hell share his toys.\n\nContent with that answer, Lilli was quiet again.\n\nBo sang along with the radio\n\nMaybe Im crazy to suppose Id ever be the one you chose\n\nOut of a thousand invitations you received \n\nHe squeezed Noras hand. You look beautiful tonight. How did I get lucky enough to get you anyway?\n\nWell  She gave him a sideways glance. You acquired a black eye for me, so...I felt sorry for you and let you follow me home, she said playing with his hand.\n\nHis eyes met hers. And I became quite a pest, as I recall .bothering you at the library \n\nNora smiled, remembering. Yes, she agreed, but...Im glad you did.\n\nMe too, Mrs. Buchanan...me too.\n\nOh, but in case I stand one little chance\n\nHere comes the jackpot question in advance\n\nWhat are you doing New Years\n\nNew Years Eve?...\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nWhen they arrived at Salvadore's there were hugs and handshakes all around. Mick quickly challenged Bo to a game of pool while Vinnie finished the cooking and Rita and Nora got the kids acquainted.\n\nIt wasnt long before Lilli was leading little Sal by the hand or crawling on the floor behind him. Sal, at 15 months, chuckled at everything Lilli did causing her to become quite the entertainer...jumping, skipping, and twirling around...anything to make him laugh. Nora peeked at her namesake, seven-week-old Nora, who slept peacefully in a bassinet in the corner of the room.\n\nOh, Rita! Your babies are beautiful! She hugged Rita again. Im so happy for you.\n\nWhile Nora and Rita visited, Mick badly beat Bo at billiards and, of course, harassed him about it.\n\nWhat happened to your skills, man? Im surprised at you!\n\nDont be so cocky, Bo shot back, Im just not warmed up yet.\n\nMick laughed, but his face quickly sobered as the door of Salvadores opened again ushering in a winter wind bearing a very pregnant Lena and her husband. They watched as she hugged the girls then introduced her husband to them.\n\nMicks heart skipped a beat. He hadnt seen Lena since he arrived home from the front. Bo noticed his change in mood.\n\nYou okay, Mick?\n\nYeah...Im fine...whose turn is it anyway? My turn to take a shot? he asked.\n\nYes, Bo answered.\n\nNeither of them noticed the little fingers draped over the edge of the pool table. As luck would have it, the ball missed the side pocket but clipped the pinky of that little hand that was draped over the edge. Lilli let go of the table and puckered up before running to her Daddys side.\n\nBo picked her up chuckling at the absurdity of it all, but Lilli held her pinky and cried. Bo soothed her, Aw...youre okay. Let Daddy see it \n\nMick felt terrible as he was the one who had made the doomed shot. Im sorry...I didnt see her fingers there \n\nDont worry about it. Shes always climbing or hanging on something. Shes fine.\n\nNora walked up about that time.\n\nTheres Mommy. Mommy kisses always make things better, Bo told Lilli. Then to Nora, Her pinky got clipped by a pool ball.\n\nWell, let me see. Oh...youre right, Daddy. This finger needs kissed! She kissed it, then took Lilli out of his arms. Bo kissed Lillis forehead and tousled her auburn curls. Mick observed the scene silently.\n\nI just came over to tell you guys its time to eat, Nora said, so come on.\n\nGood! Im starving! Bo exclaimed. Coming Mick?\n\nYeah...Ill be right there.\n\nMick watched Bo walk away with his family. He observed all the others laughing, talking, and finding a seat at the table...and he'd never felt so alone in his life.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nAfter dinner, the children played while everyone shared wine and stories around the table. Bo and Nora regaled them with stories of ranch life including Nora learning to drive and fighting the fire in the stable.\n\nSpeaking of fires, Vinnie began looking at Lena, why dont you share your fire story, Lena?\n\nLena gave Vinnie a look. Youre never going to let me forget that, are you Vinnie?\n\nProbably not since it nearly burned down my home and place of business, said Vinnie laughing.\n\nLena looked at him smugly, Well, I paid for the damages, didnt I? And besides, it paid off for me in the end, she said looking at her husband. Frank wrapped an arm across the back of her chair.\n\nVinnie started laughing and telling his version of the story until Lena interrupted him\n\nNo! It wasnt like that at all, Vincent! I was teaching myself to cook and fell asleep! It wasnt that I couldnt follow the recipe!\n\nDid the recipe tell you to bake that chicken for 7 hours?!\n\nI fell asleep, I tell you!\n\nEveryone was laughing as Vinnie continued. Next thing I know, I wake up to sirens outside my house! Someone reported smoke billowing from a window. Firemen are shouting and trying to break my door down \n\nThat would be me, said Frank.\n\nYes, Lena said, Frank and his firefighting crew came to our rescue. Thats how we met. Frank put out the fire in my apartment and then...he kindled another one...with me, Lena teased looking at Frank.\n\nWhat can I say? Frank said. A firefighters job can be very rewarding.\n\nEveryone laughed. Everyone except Mick who was pouring himself another drink. About that time, the phone rang at Salvadore's.\n\nThat may be the station, Frank said. I gave them this number if they needed me.\n\nIt was indeed the station. Frank hurriedly dismissed himself, giving Lena a brief kiss. Rita excused herself also deciding it was time to put little Sal to bed and feed her fussy baby. Nora took Lilli by the hand and proceeded to join her for some girl talk.\n\nComing Lena? Nora asked.\n\nIll be up in a bit, Lena said.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nLittle Sal was exhausted and went down with very little trouble. Rita returned to the living room to find Nora trying to quiet the fussing baby with Lilli tugging the hem of her dress.\n\nI wanna hode er, Mommy! Can I hode er?\n\nNot now, Sweetie. Shes hungry. Maybe Miss Rita will let you hold her after she feeds her.\n\nOf course you can, Rita assured her holding the now squalling baby to her breast.\n\nLilli played quietly until the baby finished nursing. Okay, Miss Lilli. Come sit on the couch.\n\nLilli crawled obediently onto the couch and held her arms out. Rita laid baby Nora gently into her outstretched arms. Nora sat beside her and propped a pillow under her arm to help support the babys head. Lilli looked at the baby with a grin.\n\nWhat do you think, Lilli? Nora asked softly.\n\nShes little, Lilli said smiling.\n\nYes, she is. You were little like that once, too, responded Nora.\n\nAt that moment, Bo and Vinnie came into the apartment. Bo looked at Lilli.\n\nLillikins...what do you have there? he asked.\n\nA baby... she replied grinning from ear to ear. Come see, Daddy. Im hoding her. She likes me!\n\nWell, she sure does! Bo told her. Thats because youre holding her so nicely.\n\nMmhmm, said Lilli, nodding her head. I want a baby, Daddy. Can we get one?\n\nBo glanced at Nora and fumbled for the words to say. Finally he answered, Well see, honey...let Daddy think about it, okay?\n\nThinking her Daddy was just dismissing her request, Lilli resorted to her usual tactic for getting what she wanted, Ill ask Papaw, she whispered to herself. Papaw will get me one \n\n* * * * * * *\n\nLena slowly made her way to the pool table where Mick was drinking beer and playing a lone game.\n\nHey, Micky, she said quietly.\n\nHe looked up.\n\nAre you planning to ignore me all night? she asked him.\n\nHe leaned over the table to take another shot which he missed terribly. Im not ignoring you, Lena.\n\nLena made a face. Oooh, what happened there? You couldve made that shot. Rack em up, Mick. Ill play you a game \n\nNo... Mick began.\n\nWhy not? For old times sake? Lena chalked a pool cue. Come on, Mick, are you afraid Ill beat you? Im at a disadvantage, ya know, with this belly in my way.\n\nMick glanced at her very pregnant appearance and clenched his jaw. He didnt say anything but racked the balls. Do you want me to break? he asked.\n\nSure.\n\nThey began the game. Mick was uptight which was affecting his game. Lena noticed but kept chattering...making small talk. Shes acting as if nothing has happened, he thought. ...as if we parted the best of friends...as if I didnt do anything to hurt her\n\nIn spite of the chatting and the bulky belly interfering with her shots, Lena was still playing an impressive game. She was always a formidable opponent, but especially tonight when Micks mind wasnt on the game.\n\nIn little time, she deposited the eight ball and wrapped it up.\n\nWanna play again, Mick? she asked cheerfully.\n\nNo, Lena. No, I dont!\n\nHe looked up and their eyes met. She could see anger there.\n\nWhy dont you stop chattering about trivial things and just ask me all of the questions that are really on your mind?! he said angrily.\n\nFine! Her eyes met his with a fire of their own. I thought we had a good thing going Mick! Then you left for the front and I stopped hearing from you. I was scared to death...afraid something had happened to you. Oh...I wasnt fool enough to think you were being faithful to me...I knew you better than that, but to find out you were married! I didnt expect that. I really expected that you would come home and that I would forgive you and wed pick up where we left off. I was willing to do that because I loved you! You knew I loved you! And you didnt even have the decency to write to me and tell me it was over! She held the edge of the pool table for a moment. I need to sit down, she said moving to a nearby table.\n\nHe grabbed his beer and followed her. Are you okay? he asked.\n\nYes. She looked up at him. Yes. I really am okay. Fine, in fact. He knew by the way she said it that she didnt mean physically. He sat down at the table with her.\n\nWith head hanging low, he said, Im sorry, Lena. I truly am.\n\nShe looked at him. Tell me about her.\n\nWhats the point? he asked. What will that accomplish?\n\nIt will help me to understand why you tossed me aside...why what she had to offer was better than what you had with me!\n\nMick ran his hand through his hair. It wasnt better. Havent you heard? I was played for a fool.\n\nHe took another swig of beer and continued. She charmed me and I fell for it. But...she didnt really love me...just wanted a free ride to the States. Not knowing that, I fell for her, married her, and brought her back here. Not long after we arrived, I found her in bed with another Brit...a man from her past. She followed him here... We divorced of course.\n\nLena looked at him sympathetically. In spite of what hed done, she still felt for him. Im sorry, Mick.\n\nDont be. It serves me right. He looked at her. I really did have a good thing with you...I was just too stupid to realize it...took you for granted...Im sorry, Lena. I cant tell you how sorry I am can you ever forgive me?\n\nShe took his hand across the table and nodded. With tears in her eyes she said, I forgive you.\n\nBut its still too late, isnt it?  he asked staring at their hands.\n\nYeah...its too late  she said softly.\n\nMick nodded. They sat in silence until he spoke again.\n\nFrank seems like a good guy, he said.\n\nFrank is a wonderful guy...Frank is a gentleman...and the first man in my life who has ever respected me and treated me like a lady.\n\nMick played with her hand. And you love him ?\n\nShe smiled. Yes...I love him. Its a different kind of love...different from what you and I had...but, I do love him, Micky.\n\nSo, youre happy then? he asked her.\n\nYes. Im happy.\n\nGood. I want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy.\n\nShe squeezed his hand.\n\nSo...youre having a baby. When are you due?\n\nLena laughed. Im having two babies...twins. Theyre due in March.\n\nMick gave her a lopsided grin. Well, you would have twins...always have to top everyone else!\n\nLena rolled her eyes and laughed. So...what are your plans, Mick?\n\nIm moving to Maine and going into a fishing business with my cousin.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah...thats what I plan to do next, I guess.\n\nWell...I wish you the best, Mick.\n\nThe same to you...and your family.\n\nShe glanced at the clock. Its nearly midnight. We should join the others to ring in the New Year.\n\nI guess youre right. He kissed her hand and helped her to her feet. Lena?\n\nShe looked at him.\n\nIm glad we talked. Thanks.\n\nShe nodded and smiled.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nLater that night, Bo and Nora rang in the New Year in their traditional manner. After, as they lay in each others arms, they reflected about the evening they had spent with old friends.\n\nNora was quiet. Bo pulled her closer and rubbed her back and shoulders. You okay? he asked her quietly.\n\nIm fine, she responded.\n\nCouldnt have been an easy night for you...Lena pregnant and Rita with a new baby.\n\nNora snuggled her head closer. Actually...it didnt bother me so much. Im so happy for Rita. She finally has the babies she has wanted for so long. And Lena...shes being doubly blessed. Seems ironic that shes having twins after giving up her daughter so long ago.\n\nBo looked at Nora. Lena had a daughter? When?\n\nOh...I forgot you didnt know. Its not common knowledge. She had a baby girl at fifteen and gave her up for adoption.\n\nI see, Bo said.\n\nSo...Im happy for them both, she continued. I guess the only thing that bothered me was Lilli holding the baby and asking for one.\n\nI know, honey. That bothered me too. Someday though .I really believe its only a matter of time \n\nMaybe  Nora said quietly, then added, I dont want to talk about it.\n\nBo rested his chin in her hair and held her tight. Okay, he said softly.\n\nAfter some silence she spoke again, Im really tired. Maybe we should get some sleep.\n\nYeah, I guess youre right, Bo agreed.\n\nBut, instead of snuggling close as she usually did, Nora sat up and fluffed her pillow, then rolled to her other side. Bo was left staring at the ceiling in the dark."
