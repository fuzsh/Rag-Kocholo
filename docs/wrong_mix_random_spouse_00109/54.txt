About this Performance

George Gershwin’s Cuban Overture premiered on a program like this one in New York City, 1932. It was the first all-Gershwin concert in history—featuring greatest hits concert like Rhapsody in Blue, An American in Paris, and a medley of popular tunes for piano and orchestra. The composer wrote, “It was, I really believe, the most exciting night I have ever had.”

Nearly a century later, former LA Phil Associate Conductor Lionel Bringuier recreates the night with Gershwin’s iconic classical, jazz, and Caribbean rhythms, while celebrating Rhapsody in Blue’s 100th anniversary alongside French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Broadway star Tony Yazbeck, and Isabel Leonard—“opera’s most in-demand singer” (Town & Country).
