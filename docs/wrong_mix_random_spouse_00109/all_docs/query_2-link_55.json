        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC (February 12, 2024) —The new concert specialELTON JOHN & BERNIE TAUPIN: THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS GERSHWIN PRIZE FOR POPULAR SONG will premiere on Monday, April 8, 2024 at 8 PM ET on PBS stations nationwide (check local listings). The 90-minute program honors the longtime singer-songwriter duo as the two iconic artists receive this year’s distinguished recognition from the Library of Congress. The music special will be recorded in Washington, D.C., in March 2024. Elton John and Bernie Taupin will be presented the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden and a delegation of Members of Congress amid a tribute concert featuring renowned musical artists. Talent performing will be announced at a later date. The program will also stream on PBS.org, via the PBS app. It will be televised on the American Forces Network to audiences of service members and civilians at the U.S. Department of Defense and diplomatic locations worldwide.\n\n“Our long-standing partnership with the Library of Congress illuminates the incredible contributions made by exceptional songwriters and performers,” said Sharon Percy Rockefeller, President and CEO of WETA. “Our viewers can anticipate a delightful evening celebrating Elton John and Bernie Taupin’s songwriting partnership and the duo’s influence on the music industry for nearly six decades. We are excited to honor these collaborators’ extraordinary contributions to popular music.”\n\n“Elton John and Bernie Taupin have written some of the most memorable songs of our lives. Their careers stand out for the quality and broad appeal of their music and their influence on their fellow artists,” said Carla Hayden, the Librarian of Congress. “More than 50 years ago, they came from across the pond to win over Americans and audiences worldwide with their beautiful songs and rock anthems. We’re proud to join PBS viewers in honoring Elton and Bernie with the Gershwin Prize for their incredible impact on generations of music lovers.”\n\n“We are very proud of our partnership with the Library of Congress to share the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song,” said Paula Kerger, President and CEO of PBS. “As America's largest stage for the performing arts, we are thrilled to give people once again a front-row seat to this extraordinary show and to spotlight the exceptional artists paying tribute to the legendary Elton John and Bernie Taupin.”\n\n\"CPB is proud to support the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song and this year’s honorees, Elton John and Bernie Taupin,” said Patricia Harrison, President and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. “In his Emmy-winning performance last year at Dodger Stadium, Elton John said, ‘I became successful first in America, so I want to thank you for that. Without America, I wouldn’t be here. Thank you for all the years of love, generosity, and loyalty.’ We are all grateful that Elton John and Bernie Taupin shared their gift with America and the world. Their songs have been part of our lives. Congratulations.”\n\n“The history of contemporary popular music has been enriched for over a half-century because of these two remarkable artists who saw the value of utilizing their respective strengths in marrying great lyrics and incredible melodies together,” remarked Ken Ehrlich, Founder and President of Ken Ehrlich Productions. “Their legacy contains some of the most resonant songs of any generation, and to honor them with the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song will result in a remarkable live event and exciting PBS show. I can't wait to put this on the stage and the screen this spring.”\n\nRecording artist Elton John and lyricist Bernie Taupin joined creative forces in 1967 and went on to pen timeless standards such as “Your Song,” “Tiny Dancer,” “Rocket Man,” “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” and “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.” In addition to ballads, the duo created sensational rock hits, including “Bennie and the Jets” and “Crocodile Rock,” which became their first No. 1 single in the U.S. in 1973.\n\nElton John: Six Decades of Music\n\nToday, John is among the top-selling solo artists of all time, with over 70 Top 40 hits over six decades, including nine No. 1s and 28 Top 10s on the Billboard Hot 100. He has sold more than 300 million records worldwide. John holds the record for the biggest-selling physical single of all time with Taupin’s rewritten lyrics for “Candle in the Wind 1997,” which sold more than 33 million copies after the sudden death of Princess Diana. In 2018, he was named the most successful male solo artist in Billboard Hot 100 chart history. In America, John holds the record for the longest span between Billboard Top 40 hits at 50 years.\n\nIn 1992, John established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which continues to lead the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The foundation has raised more than $565 million for HIV/AIDS grants that have funded more than 3,000 projects in more than 90 countries to care for patients and provide education for AIDS prevention. His music and charitable service have been honored with a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II; the Légion d’honneur, France’s highest award; and the National Humanities Medal awarded by President Joe Biden at the White House in 2022.\n\nSince launching his first tour in 1970, John has delivered more than 4,000 performances in more than 80 countries. His work has spanned recording studios, stadiums, stages, and screens — always with music that resonates with new generations of audiences. Disney’s The Lion King, carried by John’s tunes, continues to be one of Broadway’s longest-running shows.\n\nIn January 2024, John won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special for his show Elton John Live: Farewell from Dodger Stadium, making him just the 19th performer to achieve rare EGOT status, having also won five GRAMMY awards, two Oscars for his work on The Lion King and with Taupin on the movie Rocketman, and a Tony Award for the score to the Broadway musical Aida.\n\nBernie Taupin: Artist in Words and Pictures\n\nWhile their work as co-writers has been intertwined for decades, Taupin often preferred to stay behind the scenes. In their first two years, Taupin and John mostly wrote for other artists. Their first album, Empty Sky in 1969, was followed by Elton John in 1970. That second album, including the single “Your Song,” would help define their style for soaring ballads and rock songs. Taupin’s narrative songwriting, influenced by folk music, blues, and country, offered the words to help John’s melodies soar.\n\nIn addition to his work with John, Taupin has written hit songs for other artists, including Starship’s “We Built This City” and Heart’s “These Dreams,” as well as songs for Alice Cooper and Brian Wilson. In 2006, he earned a Golden Globe for “A Love That Will Never Grow Old” from the movie Brokeback Mountain.\n\nTaupin moved to Southern California, became a U.S. citizen, and developed a love for the American West. He competed in weekend horse shows and hosted a competition for cowboys at his Santa Barbara ranch. All along, he continued to write for John from a distance, and he also wrote and made music with his Americana band, Farm Dogs. Taupin also turned to another of his passions — painting abstract and contemporary mixed-media — and he considers art his full-time career.\n\nThe 1975 album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy has been called their autobiographical album as alter egos, with the song “We All Fall in Love Sometimes” describing their partnership, which would survive as one of the most important relationships of their lives. Taupin and John were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2023, John inducted Taupin into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBestowed in recognition of the legendary songwriting team of George and Ira Gershwin, the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song is the nation’s highest award for influence, impact, and achievement in popular music. In making the selection for the Prize, the Librarian of Congress consulted leading members of the music and entertainment communities, as well as curators from the Library’s Music Division, American Folklife Center and Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division. The Gershwin name is used in connection with the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song courtesy of the families of George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin.
