        "text": "STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nIn the 1920s, it was not uncommon for the Gershwin Brothers - composer George and lyricist Ira - to have two shows running on Broadway at the same time. They were that prolific and that popular. This season, 75 years after George's death, it's happening again, with \"Porgy and Bess\" and \"Nice Work If You Can Get It.\"\n\nJeff Lunden reports this is no coincidence. Both shows were generated by the Gershwin estates, the heirs to the Gershwin fortune.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nJEFF LUNDEN, BYLINE: Neither George nor Ira Gershwin had children, so their heirs are nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews. And these family members are charged with looking after intellectual property that is not only highly-loved, but immensely lucrative; a multi-million dollar a year responsibility.\n\nMICHAEL STRUNSKY: It's our job to search out and find uses for this treasure trove of music. And both the George Gershwin family and the Ira Gershwin family take this responsibility very seriously.\n\nLUNDEN: Michael Strunsky, Ira Gershwin's nephew, is trustee of his uncle's estate. He used to be in the construction business. Strunsky says sometimes, they make decisions to license Gershwin songs for films or ads.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF A UNITED AIRLINES AD)\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC, \"RHAPSODY IN BLUE\")\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Come fly the airline that's uniting the world. Come fly the friendly skies.\n\nSTRUNSKY: Those are business decisions that any business organization might make. I think, in many ways, the estates are business organizations.\n\nLUNDEN: On Broadway, right now, are two shows which come directly out of the estates' desire to keep the Gershwin legacy in the spotlight. Although \"Porgy and Bess\" premiered on Broadway in 1935, its home has been in the opera house, where an uncut version of George Gershwin's masterpiece runs almost four hours.\n\nThe Gershwin estates wanted to create a Broadway-friendly version. They worked with the DuBose Hayward estate. He authored the book the opera was based on and collaborated with George and Ira on it. Director Diane Paulus was hired and she brought in Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks and jazz composer Diedre L. Murray to adapt the opera. Paulus says all three were given...\n\nDIANE PAULUS: The encouragement, from both the Gershwin and the Dubose Heyward estate, to look at the libretto and look at the characters and strengthen what is there in a way that would make the piece viable, as a musical theater version on Broadway.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"PORGY AND BESS\")\n\nANDRA MCDONALD: (as Bess) (Singing) I loves you, Porgy. Don't let him take me. Don't let him handle me and drive me mad...\n\nLUNDEN: Their version of \"Porgy and Bess,\" which stars Audra McDonald, runs about two and a half hours. There are some significant changes made to the music and drama. The reigning dean of musical theater, Stephen Sondheim, wrote a scathing letter to The New York Times, before the show opened its pre-Broadway tryout in Boston.\n\nDirector Diane Paulus.\n\nPAULUS: It was a little bit hard when we hadn't even opened the show and we were being attacked. Because it felt like wait, we haven't even done it yet.\n\nLUNDEN: But when the show did open on Broadway, some critics had problems with it. Anthony Tomassini, of The New York Times, points out that in the original version, \"Summertime\" is sung as a solo lullaby by Clara, which underscores that the living is not easy in the African-American community of Catfish Row. But in this version, it becomes a duet, with her husband Jake.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"PORGY AND BESS\")\n\nJOSHUA HENRY: (as Jake) (Singing) Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky...\n\nANTHONY TOMASSINI: So, now it becomes a nice sentimental romantic duet for a married couple. It's nostalgic. To me, it's less gritty, less modern, less contemporary, more stereotyped.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, \"PORGY AND BESS\")\n\nJOSHUA HENRY AND NIKKI RENEE DANIELS: (as Jake and Clara) (Singing) With daddy and mamma standing by...\n\nTOMASSINI: That's not just a directorial touch, that's a rewriting and re-conceiving of the music\n\nLUNDEN: But Ira Gershwin trustee Michael Strunsky heartily approves of the changes. He points out the new version of \"Porgy and Bess\" is meant to co-exist with the operatic version.\n\nSTRUNSKY: This is the first version that has ever been truly accessible for \"Porgy and Bess.\" And although everything isn't perfect, you know, the audiences express their joy every night.\n\nLUNDEN: Joy is what director Kathleen Marshall and her collaborators on the other Gershwin show are going for.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nLUNDEN: \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" has bootleggers, naughty chorus girls, Matthew Broderick, Kelli O'Hara, and lots, and lots and lots of Gershwin tunes.\n\nKATHLEEN MARSHALL: The thought was that \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" is sort of a Gershwin comedy fest. So it feels like that kind of wonderful, sort of absurd screwball comedy from that era, but then hopefully with a nice dose of romance and heart, at the same time.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"S'WONDERFUL\")\n\nLUNDEN: The show is partially the brainchild of trustee Michael Strunsky, who saw a version of the Gershwin Brothers 1926 musical \"Oh, Kay\" done in San Francisco almost 20 years ago. He convinced the other heirs to hire playwright Joe DiPietro to write a new libretto, which has morphed into something almost entirely different.\n\nLike the current version of \"Porgy and Bess,\" director Kathleen Marshall says the team on \"Nice Work\" was given kind of carte blanche by the estates to do as they pleased.\n\nMARSHALL: They basically gave us permission to use everything in the Gershwin catalogue, except for \"Porgy and Bess\" and \"Of Thee I Sing,\" which, of course, is a kind of its own complete show.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME\")\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Singing) Won't you tell him, please, to put on some speed. Follow my lead. Oh, how I need. Someone to watch over me.\n\nLUNDEN: Michael Strunsky says the Gershwin estates will soon be watching over another project, a stage adaptation of \"An American in Paris.\"\n\nFor NPR News, I'm Jeff Lunden in New York.\n\nINSKEEP: You can see scenes from \"Nice Work If You Can Get It,\" at NPR.org.\n\nWe're glad you're listening to this local Public Radio station.
