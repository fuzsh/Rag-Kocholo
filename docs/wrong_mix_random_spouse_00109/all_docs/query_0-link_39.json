        "text": "Earlier this week, Curbed NY broke the news that the NYC duplex penthouse where songsters George and Ira Gershwin lived in the 1930s has been listed for sale. It is here where the brothers composed Girl Crazy, the musical that would go on to launch Ethel Merman's career and eventually be made into a movie three times, including one starring Judy Garland. Inside the three-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom co-op—the floor, which the brothers used to occupy fully, has since been divided into three units—there's a master suite, open living/dining room, a home office, and a marble bath. Outside, there's a terrace overlooking the Hudson River and Riverside Park below. The mellifluous life is ripe for the taking for $2.5M; head to Curbed NY for additional photos and the floorplan porn.\n\n· George & Ira Gershwin's UWS Penthouse Hits Market for $2.5M [Curbed NY]"
