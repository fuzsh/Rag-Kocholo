        "text": "Home to one of Broadway’s longest-running — and most well-loved — shows, The Gershwin Theater is where a most popular type of magic happens on stage. As the largest theater on Broadway, you’ll find not just the enchanting performances of Wicked within its walls, but also the American Theater Hall of Fame in its lobby.\n\nThe theater opened in 1972 with the original name of the Uris Theater, but was renamed in honor of two names even the non-theatergoers will recognize: George and Ira Gershwin. Many a famous show has graced its stage since, and most recently, the theater has been defying gravity for over two decades with the spellbinding tale of Wicked.\n\nThe Gershwin Theatre box office is located (along with the theater) at 222 W 51st St. in Manhattan’s Theater District, and is open Monday through Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and Sunday from 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.\n\nWhat Events Are Coming Up at Gershwin Theatre?\n\nSee upcoming events and buy tickets for Wicked right here on Ticketmaster.\n\nGershwin Theatre History\n\nThe Gershwin Theatre opened in 1972 after being designed by Broadway mainstay Ralph Alswang. Originally named the Uris Theatre, the venue is located on the second floor of Paramount Plaza (what used to be the Uris Building, hence its original name), with the American Theater Hall of Fame placed in the lobby and rotundas.\n\nAs the Uris, the venue’s first production was 1972’s Via Galactica starring Raul Julia. During its early days, the theater hosted concerts by the likes of Sammy Davis Jr.; the trio of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie; Barry Manilow and Paul Anka, as well as the 1975 Grammy Awards. It also staged the 1977 revival of The King and I and the original Broadway production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\n\nThe theater was renamed in honor of George and Ira Gershwin in 1983, the same year it hosted the Tony Awards for the first time. The venue’s first production under its new moniker was 1984’s Mame starring Angela Lansbury. Major Broadway shows in the ensuing years included the original productions of Singin’ in the Rain (1985), Starlight Express (1986), Meet Me in St. Louis (1989), a 1993 revival of Camelot and more.\n\nIn 2003, the Gershwin welcomed audiences to the Emerald City for Wicked, the untold story of the Witches of Oz.
