        "text": "Act I\n\nIt is 1927, and we are in the midst of a riotous bachelor party for the oft-married Jimmy Winter (“Sweet and Lowdown”). Outside, a trio of bootleggers—Cookie, Billie and Duke—are trying to figure out where to hide the 400 cases of gin they have stashed on their boat. As a stranger approaches, Duke and Cookie rush off. A drunken Jimmy staggers on and comes across the pants-wearing Billie and is immediately smitten. He explains his plight—he must marry someone respectable or his mother will disinherit him, so he’s marrying a woman he doesn’t truly love. Billie isn’t all that interested in his tale of woe, until he reveals that he has a huge Long Island beach house that he never uses, so she swipes his wallet to discover the address. Jimmy assumes Billie is falling for him, but Billie insists that love is for suckers. Jimmy vehemently disagrees (“Nice Work If You Can Get It”). Jimmy passes out, and Billie reflects on this interesting man unconscious on the ground before her (“Nice Work If You Can Get It - Reprise”). Cookie and Duke rush back on, and Billie tells them that she found a place to store their bootleg—a Long Island beach house! A police whistle pierces the air, and the bootleggers scatter. Senator Max Evergreen and Chief Berry enter, along with Duchess Estonia Dulworth, who has brought along her Vice Squad and vows to rid society of its greatest evil (“Demon Rum”).\n\nThe next morning, Billie, Cookie and Duke have stored their 400 cases of gin into the cellar of Jimmy’s ritzy beach house. Eileen Evergreen, the finest interpreter of modern dance in the world, enters with Jimmy. They were married that morning, and they are on their honeymoon, though Eileen has yet to allow Jimmy to touch her. Cookie, disguised as a butler, enters and they naturally assume he’s their servant. They send him off, and Eileen tells Jimmy that she’s ready for the honeymoon shenanigans to begin—as soon as she takes a bath. She exits into the house as Billie enters, stunned to see Jimmy. Jimmy has no memory of meeting her last night, and as Jimmy flirts with her, Billie confesses that she’s never been kissed. Strictly for educational purposes, Jimmy kisses Billie, and she realizes what she’s been missing (“Someone To Watch Over Me”).\n\nFour and a half hours later, Eileen is still bathing (“Delishious”). In the ritzy living room, Cookie and Billie devise a plan for Billie to distract Jimmy from the 400 cases of gin in his cellar. Billie runs off as Jimmy enters, followed by a gaggle of chorus girls who invite him for a group swim, which Jimmy almost accepts (“I’ve Got To Be There”). Eileen enters with a flourish, and just as she is about to let Jimmy touch her, he receives a telegram revealing that his last wife refused to sign their annulment, and an irate Eileen storms off to get her father. That night in Jimmy’s ritzy bedroom, Billie breaks in and tries to seduce him, badly (“Treat Me Rough”). Chief Berry, who has been pursuing Billie, barges in to arrest her. But Jimmy convinces him that Billie is actually his newest wife (“Let’s Call The Whole Thing Off”) and Billie and Jimmy are forced to spend the night together in his bedroom.\n\nThe next morning, Jeannie, a happy-go-lucky chorus girl, comes upon Duke, a lug from New Jersey, and mistakes him for an actual English duke. Duke, who is perpetually nervous around women, tries to escape, but Jeannie does everything in her power to get him to notice her (“Do It Again”).\n\nIn the ritzy living room, Jimmy and Billie realize that they are hopelessly in love (“‘S Wonderful”). But Eileen returns with her father—the ultra-conservative Senator Evergreen—and her aunt—the Duchess Estonia Dulworth—to demand that Jimmy and Eileen have a legal wedding. Jimmy has no choice but to marry Eileen, and Billie pretends to be a cockney maid so she can stick around and guard the bootleg. As Eileen beelines towards the cellar to get the wedding china, Jimmy and Cookie frantically distract the wedding party away from the basement (“Fascinating Rhythm”) as the curtain falls.\n\nAct II"
