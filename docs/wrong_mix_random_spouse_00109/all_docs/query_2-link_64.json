        "text": "After a three-year delay, Royal City Musical Theatre (RCMT) is excited to present the riotously entertaining musical Crazy for You at the Massey Theatre from April 27 – May 14, 2023.\n\nIt’s a classic romantic comedy; a fun tale about a boy, a girl and a theatre in need of salvation, filled with witty one-liners and colorful characters caught up in a classic romantic fable.\n\nAdding to the excitement, RCMT is thrilled to have Vancouver’s own Todd Talbot play the lead role of Bobby Child. The wacky plot has a light hearted script with some sensational tap dancing, a collection of the most beloved tunes and show stopping numbers of George and Ira Gershwin, including the romantic “Someone To Watch Over Me” and “Shall We Dance”, “I Can’t Be Bothered Now” and the high-energy dance number, “I Got Rhythm”.\n\nMusic and Lyrics by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin\n\nBook by Ken Ludwig\n\nCo Conception by Ken Ludwig and Mike Ockrent\n\nInspired by Material by Guy Bolton and John McGowan\n\nOriginally produced on Broadway by Roger Horchow and Elizabeth Williams\n\nOriginal Broadway Choreography by Susan Stroman\n\nDirector & Choreographer – Valerie Easton\n\nMusical Director – James Bryson\n\nVocal Direction – Patrick Ray\n\nPerformance Dates: April 27 – May 14, 2023"
