Love to Joby and Diz.\n\nCREATIVES\n\nGEORGE GERSHWIN (Music) was born in Brooklyn on September 26, 1898, and began his musical training when he was 13. At 16, he quit high school to work as a “song plugger” for a music publisher, and soon he was writing songs himself. “Swanee,” as introduced by Al Jolson, brought George his first real fame and led to his writing a succession of 22 musical comedies, most with his older brother, Ira. The Gershwins’ shows include Lady, Be Good!; Oh, Kay!; Strike Up the Band; Girl Crazy; and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Of Thee I Sing. From his early career George had ambitions to compose serious music. These ambitions were realized in some of his masterpieces, among them “Rhapsody in Blue,” “Concerto in F,” “An American in Paris” and “Second Rhapsody.” In the late ‘20s George became fascinated by the DuBose Heyward novel Porgy, recognizing it as a perfect vehicle for opera using jazz and blues idioms. George’s folk opera Porgy and Bess opened in Boston on September 30, 1935, and had its Broadway premiere two weeks later. In 1937 George was at the height of his career. In Hollywood, working on the score of The Goldwyn Follies, he collapsed and on July 11 died of a brain tumor. He was not quite 39 years old.\n\nIRA GERSHWIN (Lyrics), the first songwriter to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize, was born in New York City on December 6, 1896. In 1917, The Evening Sun published his first song (“You May Throw All the Rice You Desire but Please, Friends, Throw No Shoes”). Four years later, Ira enjoyed his first major stage success, Two Little Girls in Blue, written with another Broadway newcomer, Vincent Youmans. In 1924, Ira and his brother George created the smash hit Lady, Be Good! and went on to continue their remarkable collaboration through a dozen major stage scores, producing such standards as “Fascinating Rhythm,” “The Man I Love,” “ ‘S Wonderful,” “Embraceable You,” “I Got Rhythm,” “But Not for Me” and others far too numerous to mention. During his long career, Ira also enjoyed productive collaborations with such songwriters as Harold Arlen, Vernon Duke, Kurt Weill, Burton Lane and Jerome Kern, with whom he created his greatest song hit of any one year, “Long Ago (And Far Away).” Ira Gershwin died on August 17, 1983, in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nJULIANNE BOYD (Director) is the Founder (1995) and Artistic Director of Barrington Stage Company (BSC) where she has directed many productions, including the critically acclaimed West Side Story (2018) and the 2017 hit production of Company, starring Aaron Tveit.
