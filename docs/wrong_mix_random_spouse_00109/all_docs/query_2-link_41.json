        "text": "Dave Grohl has added a new accolade to his musical resume.\n\nOn Monday, the Student Alumni Association declared Grohl as the 2024 Spring Sing George and Ira Gershwin Recipient. The 19-time Grammy-winner and two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee will appear in person to accept the award May 17 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center.\n\nThe multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter is most known for his musical involvement with bands like Nirvana and Foo Fighters. Alongside Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic, Grohl served as a core member of Nirvana from 1990 to 1994 as the grunge rock band’s drummer. After the passing of Cobain and the end of Nirvana, Grohl founded Foo Fighters, which released its self-titled debut album in 1995. The alternative rock group has since released 10 subsequent studio albums with Grohl as the band’s lead vocalist and guitarist.\n\nThe lifetime achievement prize – which honors artists with significant contributions to American music and culture – is awarded yearly at SAA’s annual talent competition. While no recipient was named last year, film composer and music producer Hans Zimmer received the honor in 2022.\n\nThe award is named after brothers George and Ira Gershwin in honor of the songwriting and composing duo’s contributions to UCLA and beyond – including the donation of their song “Strike Up the Band” to the university. Other past recipients include Tom Petty, Julie Andrews, Anthony Kiedis and Lionel Richie.\n\nComposed of both group and individual performances, this year’s Spring Sing will feature 12 acts. All tickets – including $8 student tickets – went on sale at noon on Monday via the Central Ticket Office."
