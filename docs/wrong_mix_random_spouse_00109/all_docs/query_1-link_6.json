        "text": "The stage setup for the Gershwin's current show, Wicked, is rather high, meaning that the front rows BB to EE have poor sight lines.\n\nIn fact, the whole front of the orchestra is below the front of the stage, so many features of the backdrop cannot be seen. This is also true of seats on the wings of the orchestra.\n\nA higher position, ideally the front mezzanine, is better if you want to get the full effect of any show in the Gershwin Theatre.\n\nLandlord: Nederlander Organization\n\nOfficial Ticketer: Ticketmaster\n\nNotes:\n\nThe Gershwin Theatre is the largest theatre on Broadway as it seats 1900 people, which is a huge amount of people for a Broadway show.\n\nThis means that this theatre only works for large musical productions. Shows need to well financed and have staying power to make this huge theatre hum.\n\nElevator: Yes\n\nEscalator: Yes\n\nDisabled Access Notes:\n\nWheelchair accessible seating can be located in the rear of the third floor orchestra and fourth floor mezzanine sections. Neither of these locations require steps and can be accessed via the main lobby elevator.\n\nTheatre staff will be available to help any patrons who require assistance to reach their seats.\n\nThe Gershwin Theatre opened as the Uris Theatre in 1972 and, on account of its colossal size, has been used almost exclusively for musicals since that time.\n\nFor a period in the mid-'70s, it also was frequently used for booking concert and dance acts, such as Sammy Davis, Jr., Johnny Mathis, Rudolf Nureyev, Dance Theatre of Harlem, and Frank Sinatra.\n\nLargest Broadway Theatre\n\nMention the Gershwin Theatre, and the word \"Enormous!\" is the first thing a theater regular will have to say about it. At 1,900 seats, the Gershwin is the largest of the Broadway theaters, but it's not just the seating capacity that makes it seem so mammoth.\n\nBuilt into what was once known as the Uris Building (the theater, too, was called the Uris when it opened), the Gershwin Theatre takes up six stories. From the entrance lobby, you have to take an escalator up just to get to the orchestra level.\n\nRenamed Gershwin Theatre in 1983\n\nThe Uris was renamed the Gershwin Theatre on June 5, 1983, in honor of the famous brothers George and Ira Gershwin, who created such classics as Of Thee I Sing and Porgy and Bess.\n\nNotable Past Productions\n\nNotable past productions at the Gershwin Theatre include Via Galactica, Seesaw, Gigi, Treemonisha, Bing Crosby on Broadway, Sweeney Todd, The Pirates of Penzance, Singin' in the Rain, Starlight Express, Meet Me in St. Louis, and Wicked.\n\nThe Gershwin has also had the wonderful habit of hosting revivals of musicals in which the original stars returned to play the memorable roles that they created, like Yul Brynner in The King and I, Rex Harrison in My Fairy Lady, and Angela Lansbury in Mame."
