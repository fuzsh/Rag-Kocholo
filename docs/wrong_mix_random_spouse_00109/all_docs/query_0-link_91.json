The Gershwin has served as a traditional theatre for the majority of its existence, though the venue was a concert hall from 1974 to 1976.\n\nThe theatre was renamed to honor composer and lyricist duo George and Ira Gershwin during the 37th Tony Awards on June 5, 1983. The Gershwin has the largest seating capacity on Broadway at 1,933 seats, and it houses the American Theatre Hall of Fame in its lobby.\n\nHow to get to the Gershwin Theatre on Broadway\n\nThe Gershwin Theatre is closest to the 50th Street subway stops on the C, E, and 1 lines. The theatre is also equidistant from the 7th Ave/W 50th St. and 8th Ave/W 50th St. bus stops on the M50 line.\n\nRestaurants near the Gershwin Theatre\n\nPopular restaurants near the Gershwin Theatre include Junior's (American), Saar (Indian), Lillie's Victorian Establishment (British/pub food), and The Blue Dog (American).
