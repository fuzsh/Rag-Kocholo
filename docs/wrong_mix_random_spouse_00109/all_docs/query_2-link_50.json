        "text": "“a winning combination of Leonard Bernstein and Bill Nye the Science Guy, an infectiously enthusiastic explainer of the inner mechanical workings of music…”\n\n—The New York Times\n\nBetween 1918 and 1937 the Gershwin brothers produced more than 700 songs together for theater and film that helped invent the modern musical. An enormous number have become classics, performed and recorded by generations of performers. But why? What has made these songs survive? Come hear the stories and explore the music of some of their most enduring and groundbreaking songs including “I Got Rhythm,” “Someone to Watch Over Me,” “You Can’t Take That Away from Me” and “Love is Sweeping the Country.”\n\nFor over 30 years, Rob Kapilow has brought the joy and wonder of music – and unraveled some of its mysteries – to audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Characterized by his unique ability to create an “aha” moment for his audiences and collaborators, whatever their level of musical sophistication or naiveté, Kapilow’s work brings music into people’s lives: opening new ears to musical experiences and helping people to listen actively rather than just hear.\n\nTicket & Visitor Information"
