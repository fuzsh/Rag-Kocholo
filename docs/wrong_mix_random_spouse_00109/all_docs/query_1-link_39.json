        "text": "While George Gershwin created some of the most famous melodies in music history, his brother Ira Gershwin is celebrated for his brilliant lyrics. The George and Ira Gershwin Critical Edition will be the first-ever scholarly edition of the music and lyrics of George and Ira Gershwin.\n\nConductors, musicians, performers, scholars and the audiences alike will gain greater insight into the Gershwins’ original material. In many cases, the critical edition will offer the first performance materials to accurately reflect the creators’ vision.\n\nEach volume will include an introductory essay focusing on the genesis of the compositions, as well as a critical commentary explaining all editorial decisions regarding the presentation of the works.\n\nThe project was made possible by the partnership of the School of Music, Theatre & Dance at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) with the Heirs of George Gershwin and the Ira and Leonore Gershwin Trusts. In addition, the project was supported by individual donors and a grant from the United States National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nThe critical edition will comprise more than 60 volumes (divided into 10 series) and will be published by Schott Music.
