About the Gershwin Theatre

Named for the great brothers - composer George and lyricist Ira - the Gershwin Theatre New York is one of Broadway's jewels, located in midtown-Manhattan at the bottom of the Paramount Plaza building. It features one of the largest stages on Broadway and admits almost 200 more audience members than the second-biggest venue, the Broadway Theatre. It is perfectly suited to large-scale productions and since 2003 has been the home of smash-hit musical Wicked.

Set designer Ralph Alswang is responsible for the building’s modernist Art Nouveau style. From inside you’ll see the venue's sweeping rotunda which was specially designed to display Broadway's own Theater Hall of Fame: the names and photographs of the brightest and best who've trodden the boards in New York's theaterland. The stage itself is 80 feet wide with a 65-foot-wide, adjustable proscenium arch.

Originally opening as the Uris Theater on November 28, 1972, the venue spent two years as a concert hall. Legendary performers like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby graced its stage. Its 1976 hosting of Porgy and Bess ushered in a new era of hit musical productions which continues to this day. In addition, the Tony Awards have been hosted at the Gershwin on several occasions.

These days, on most evenings and less frequent matinees, the foyer spills over with theatergoers heading to see Wicked at the Gershwin Theatre. The musical set a new box office record for the venue and was then the highest one-week box office gross income earned by any show throughout Broadway history.
