        "text": "How does a national currency acquire the status of an international or key currency? This question is being asked anew as the deutsche mark takes on increasing importance on the global scene. The postwar world was dominated by two currencies, the US dollar and the pound sterling. But, as explained by Robert Aliber, they “became international currencies neither by Act of Congress (Parliament) nor by Act of God, but rather because they met various needs of foreign official institutions and foreign private parties more effectively than other financial assets could” (The Future of the Dollar as an International Currency, New York, 1966).\n\nOne of the factors underlying the adoption of a managed floating exchange rate system in 1973 was the desire to move away from the dollar standard that characterized the Bretton Woods fixed rate system. Although the international monetary order continues to be dominated by the dollar, in recent years we have seen the gradual move toward a multicurrency system. Other currencies—including the deutsche mark and the yen—are being increasingly used internationally. This article explains the characteristics of an international currency and the factors that affect them, before discussing the extent of the internationalization of the deutsche mark in recent years."
