        "text": "This Sunday, Germany celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The festivities will be rather spectacular for a nation that remains understandably skeptical of nationalistic displays. In Berlin, starting this Friday, three days’ worth of tours, readings, and concerts are planned, all of them centered around an elaborate display of eight thousand lighted balloons that will stand along a nine-mile stretch of the city, tracing the path where the Wall once stood. On the afternoon of November 9th, Berliners will fasten written notes to the balloons and release them into the air, transforming the former border into a floating ribbon of light. A characteristic message from a “virtual balloon patron,” posted on the event’s Web site, reads, “I hope that my children understand what it is to live in a city that is no longer surrounded by a wall.” Many of the notes stress the importance of remembrance in an era when there are few visible remnants of the city’s division.\n\nA lot has changed in Berlin, and throughout eastern Germany, since November of 1989, when a G.D.R. bureaucrat flubbed a question about new travel regulations on live television, making it sound like East Germany would open its borders. When he replied to a journalist that the policies were effective “as far as I know, now—immediately,” thousands flooded the border crossings. (Amy Davidson wrote about the incident, and the anniversary, in the magazine.) In the early nineteen-nineties, East Berlin still smelled of the noxious fumes emitted by its state-produced automobile, the Trabant, and of the brown coal that was the G.D.R.’s only domestic energy source. Its buildings were stark and modernist compared with the West’s neoclassical frills, and its roads and bridges were more deteriorated.\n\nThe German Federal Republic had experienced a period of tremendous growth in the nineteen-fifties and early nineteen-sixties, known to German economists as the Wirtschaftswunder, or “economic miracle.” The boom was the result of several auspicious events. Most Americans have heard of the Marshall Plan, which dedicated billions of dollars to rebuilding Europe after the Second World War. By 1952, Germany had received about 1.4 billion dollars in Marshall Plan funds. It was a smaller portion than France or the United Kingdom received, but the moral boost that the aid provided—plus the presence of several hundred thousand stationed American soldiers, spending U.S. dollars—contributed to West Germany’s postwar growth. Even more significant to the country’s recovery, though, was the introduction of the Deutsche Mark, in 1948, followed by a long period of industrial growth and low inflation in the fifties and sixties.\n\nWith the opening of the borders, in 1989, East Germans soon began to share in the material fruits of decades of Western prosperity. After reunification, with the help of the equivalent of 1.6 trillion euros from the federal government and private German firms, eastern Germany experienced a growth spurt, too. Since 1991, unemployment in the region has fallen by about half, and wages have grown much faster than in the western part of the country (as would be expected). The per-capita G.D.P. of Germany’s eastern states, as a whole, today ranks just behind Italy and Spain.\n\nThe changes are visible, too. These days, the two halves of Berlin are mostly indistinguishable; a recent Washington Post article suggests that infrastructure investment throughout eastern Germany has been so successful “that western Germans are grumbling and demanding equal attention for their comparatively decrepit bridges, roads and railways.” Last month, the state-owned banking group KfW reported that the differences between eastern and western Germany, as measured by factors such as per-capita G.D.P. and employment rates, are finally within the range of regional differences found in other industrialized countries like Canada, Japan, and the United States.\n\nIn an attempt to gauge just how far eastern Germany has come, the study’s authors looked at the economies of West Germany between 1950 and 1956, and of the eastern German states from 1991 to 1997. “Starting from the same level of real G.D.P. per capita, the two economies grew similarly strong,” KfW’s chief economist, Jörg Zeuner, told me, adding that they also grew for similar reasons. The growth, he said, “led us to say that we’re looking at a kind of second economic miracle.”\n\nThe improvement was significant, but “miracle” might be overstating the case. Per-capita G.D.P. in the eastern states, boosted by investments from the West, started to level off after 1997, whereas the original West German “economic miracle” described growth that persisted for more than a decade. And although the regional differences have lessened, the former G.D.R. still lags behind western Germany in virtually every economic metric. Labor productivity and levels of industrialization are both significantly lower in eastern Germany, and median wages are still twenty per cent lower than those in western states for the same work. Most notably, unemployment remains persistently high. In 2005, it rose to more than eighteen per cent; in 2013, the latest year considered in the KfW study, unemployment in eastern Germany was 10.3 per cent, compared to six per cent in the west.\n\nEastern Germany also remains “a workbench of the west,” to use one national newspaper’s phrase, meaning that the region provides labor for industries whose headquarters and highest-paid employees are in western Germany. Volkswagen has opened a large automotive plant in the eastern city of Leipzig, for instance, but keeps its headquarters and main research department in the western city of Wolfsburg, which, not coincidentally, is the richest city in Germany. This state of affairs is due, in part, to the process of reunification, Uwe Blien, who is a department head with the country’s Federal Employment Agency, explained to me. When a Soviet-bloc country such as the former Czechoslovakia dissolved, Blien said, shares of its nationalized firms were often distributed among its citizens using a voucher system. (These shares weren’t worth much, and a handful of wealthy private buyers often managed to collect the majority of them.) In Germany, though, established firms from the west spent billions buying up the state-run industries.\n\nThe result has been double-edged. On the one hand, eastern Germany saw improvements in living conditions and wages far in excess of those experienced by other countries in the Eastern Bloc, thanks to the influx of money from the western half of the country. On the other hand, western ownership meant that regional inequalities have been exacerbated. “Most innovations today are done in the west,” Blien told me, “not because east Germans are not clever enough, but due to the process of unification, which gave the west German firms a larger role.” Today, only ten per cent of Germany’s large companies (those with over five hundred employees) are based in the east, according to the KfW report. The region has also declined in population by more than ten per cent since 1990, the result of a low birth rate and migration, and now accounts for only fifteen per cent of Germany’s people. Its population is aging faster than that of the west, as well.\n\nWe can still celebrate the Wall’s fall, and the reunification of a divided people, without exaggerating the economic advantages it conferred. Without a doubt, most citizens of the former G.D.R. enjoy a higher quality of life than they did on November 8, 1989, the day before the division between West and East Berlin collapsed. A glance around the rest of the former Eastern Bloc, where unemployment and poverty tend to be higher, suggests that eastern Germany was lucky to have had a strong western state to support its transition to a market economy. Yet regional inequalities persist, and people struggle to find work. With Germany facing the threat of another recession, it does not seem likely that the gap between east and west will close anytime soon. “This process is not completed yet,” Blien told me. “There’s a convergence, but it’s a slow one.”"
