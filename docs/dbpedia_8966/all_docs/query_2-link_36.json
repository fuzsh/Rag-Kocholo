        "text": "I need people to move themselves about the various virtual rooms, but I don't want them to have the power to close rooms! This should be for the host only. Since, any person who wants to act rogue and dislikes virtual environments can close the rooms, blame it on the technology and say that zoom isn't fit for purpose. You can't identify who has closed the rooms. And of course everyone denies it. Not useful when you have a large number of externals in your virtual environment that you're trying to impress. How can I give feedback to zoom to get this changed??? I can understand that you may want a second admin person to help the host, so they need the power, but to give everyone the same power is not useful. We can't stop making everyone co-host as there are far too many people to move about. They need to do it themselves. We really need another role - one that allows people to move about so they can see the breakout rooms, but no other powers."
