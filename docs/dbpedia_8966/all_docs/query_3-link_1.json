        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: January 1990 in Leipzig - since the fall of the Berlin wall many East Germans continue to leave their country. But most want to stay should the prospect of a better life become reality.\n\nBERND-LUTZ LANGE: \"When people started shouting 'If the Deutschmark comes, we stay, if it doesn't, we go to it.' Bonn suddenly realized that, dear God, that is a possibility, that tomorrow there could be three million people standing in the streets here.\"\n\nLOTHAR DE MAIZIÈRE: \"Here in West Berlin, we witnessed currency exchange offices running an exchange rate of 1 to 20. But at the same time we saw West Berliners exchanging one Deutschmark for 20 GDR Marks to go to East Berlin and empty the shops there, to put it mildly. And around 2,000-3,000 people left every day. We soon said that we had to instill hope for people to stay. I remember talking to Kohl and telling him 'If it goes on like this, you will have to send the Army to Leipzig at Christmas, so I still have someone to operate the trams.'\"\n\nNARRATOR: On the 1st of July, 1990 the Deutschmark becomes the official currency of the GDR. It is an important step towards unification.\n\nGDR CITIZEN: \"We will soon be united.\"\n\nKLAUS VON DOHNANYI: \"I always thought that it wouldn’t be possible to have German unity without monetary unity.\"\n\nKORL-OTTO PÖHL: \"It would have been fine to wait a year or two. But maybe not. The people simply wanted to have the Deutschmark. It’s hard to say with hindsight. In any case, this was one of the reasons for my resignation later.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Over night, shelves fill with goods from the West. But goods from the East are rejected.\"\n\nBÄRBEL REINKE: \"That can’t go well, it can’t go well, if you don’t buy something that you make in your own country, if nobody buys this any more, then you don’t need to make it any more and nobody has any jobs.\"\n\nNARRATOR: In just a short space of time almost one million jobs are lost. Critics begin to voice concerns about the speed and manner of reform. The GDR economy has been in terrible condition for a long time and without a future. But many of those affected are not really aware of it.\n\nDOHNANYI: \"The real problems were what will happen with the jobs, what will happen with the markets that supported most of our jobs. And these were mainly markets in the East and this was a really difficult time.\"\n\nDE MAIZIÈRE: \"Ten years later some economic research institutes worked out how this could have been done step-by-step. But as Vaclav Havel said, you can only jump across the ditch in one leap, not two.\"\n\nNARRATOR: But first, there were celebrations on the 1st of July, 1990. It is the myth of the Deutschmark."
