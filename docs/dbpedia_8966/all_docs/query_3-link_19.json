        "text": "From one day to the next, a topic that most people had previously considered far more utopian than the idea of a common European currency thrust itself into hearts and minds around the globe: Germany reunification. In late November, Kohl presented a 10-Point Plan to the German parliament to set up a German-German confederation so that \"the German people can regain their unity by their own volition.\"\n\nA Mitterrand Temper Tantrum That Lasted Several Hours\n\nGermany's Western allies, who hadn't been consulted on the issue, were therefore all the more critical of Kohl's plans. Was the German chancellor plotting behind their backs to take Germany off on a course of its own? Did he intend to set up a new German behemoth at the heart of Europe?\n\nWhen Mitterrand heard about Kohl's declaration, he \"threw a small temper tantrum lasting several hours,\" as his advisers smugly noted. The French president imagined a new superpower rising up on the eastern border of his country, a force whose currency would dominate the entire continent, and whose political might would shatter postwar harmony in Europe.\n\nIt soon became clear to what extent France's head of state felt he had been betrayed. German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher rushed to Paris to explain Bonn's new domestic policy.\n\nIt would be a memorable meeting. For three-quarters of an hour, from 5:45 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., Mitterrand beseeched his guest to such an extent that the man whose job it was to take notes of the encounter, German Ambassador Franz Pfeffer, chose to adopt an unusual stance. \"On account of the significance of the discussion,\" Pfeffer wrote in the introduction to his minutes, he had \"not summarized the topics addressed.\" Instead, \"an account of the insistent repetition will highlight the main thrusts of the argument particularly clearly.\"\n\nThat is certainly no exaggeration. Pfeffer's protocol, classified \"strictly confidential,\" shows more clearly than almost any other historical document how closely Mitterrand's approval of Germany's reunification was linked to German concessions on monetary union.\n\n'Germany Is Currently Dragging Its Heels'\n\n\"Germany can only hope for reunification if it is part of a strong community,\" Mitterand declared. However, Mitterrand complained, Germany did not seem to be especially community-minded at that time. \"You don't have to be a psychologist to recognize that Germany is currently dragging its heels on economic and monetary union,\" he lamented. In Mitterand's eyes, all Germany's arguments on the issue clearly suggested its attitude was \"We're in no hurry.\"\n\nIn view of the forthcoming European summit, Mitterrand insisted Bonn make concessions. And he followed up his demand with a thinly veiled threat: \"If, having swallowed up the communist eastern half of the country, Germany begins flexing its muscles within the overall European project, it will find that fellow member states in the (EEC) will be less friends than partners with their own reflexes,\" Mitterrand said. For this reason, he said, Germany faced a \"very important choice\" at the summit in Strasbourg.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher immediately understood what the dire insinuations meant: Mitterrand was threatening to veto Germany's reunification. If push came to shove, Bonn would find itself opposed not only by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who made no bones about her dislike for a greater Germany, but also by Mitterrand.\n\nPreparing for Economic and Monetary Union\n\nGenscher was therefore at pains to appear reasonable. He flatteringly said he had had the honor of having had \"a series of talks with the French president\" in the past. But, he added, he considered this one to be \"the most important.\" He then made Mitterand a not insignificant promise: \"What we need to do in Strasbourg,\" Genscher said, \"is to decide on the intergovernmental conference to prepare for economic and monetary union.\"\n\nOver the next few days, frantic negotiations were conducted between the Chancellery in Bonn and the French government in Paris. Letters were exchanged, calls were made, timetables were amended and possible wordings were discussed. In the end, the Germans agreed to hold the planned conference at the end of 1990, as France desired. At the same time they scaled back their demands for political union. Two days before the summit in Strasbourg, the chancellery told the French government, \"It is OK.\"\n\nThat may have been what their staff believed, but it was certainly not the case. When Kohl and Genscher entered the conference room in Strasbourg on Dec. 8, 1989, the atmosphere was more than icy. One head of state after another rejected Germany's appeal for speedier unity.\n\nThe Germans had a hard time convincing their EEC partners to bless German reunification, and when it came the lukewarm approval was riddled with reservations and conditions. By contrast, the French timetable for monetary union was given the nod in principle. There was no discussion of the issue of political union.\n\nBut Kohl was still not sure whether he had the French president's endorsement of German reunification. In early January, the two statesman met at Mitterrand's country retreat of Latché in southwestern France. The two men spent several hours wandering along the Atlantic coast. Afterward, it was clear that they had reached an agreement about the principles of the two forthcoming unification projects. \"Mitterand stopped opposing Germany's reunification after Latché,\" says Joachim Bitterlich, Kohl's advisor at the time.\n\nA Moment of Great Pride\n\nFrom then on things moved very quickly. In the summer of 1990, representatives of East and West Germany signed the unification treaty, and on Oct. 3, the eastern states that had previously made up the communist German Democratic Republic joined those of the Federal Republic of Germany. In December, EEC heads of state and government met in Rome for the start of the intergovernmental conference on European monetary union. When, in February 1992, they signed the Maastricht Treaty on the introduction of the euro, it was a moment of great pride for Hans-Dietrich Genscher. \"For me this act symbolized the fulfillment of the promises I had made during the reunification process that a united Germany would continue to pursue the politics of European integration in a determined and no less dedicated manner,\" Genscher wrote in his memoirs.\n\nSo was relinquishing the deutsche mark the price of reunification?\n\nThis question is not easy to answer definitively, not least because important decisions about the euro were only taken at a later date -- for instance in 1992, when only a wafer-thin majority of the French electorate approved the Maastricht Treaty in a referendum.\n\nNevertheless it is hard to deny that the collapse of the communist regime in East Germany represented a decisive step toward the adoption of the common European currency. Before the fall of the wall, European monetary union had been an ambitious EEC project like so many others. Afterward it was the central political tool with which to bind the expanded Germany to the European community.\n\n\"European monetary union may not have come about had it not been for Germany's reunification,\" says former Bundesbank President Karl Otto Pöhl. \"Kohl knew that he had to promote European interests in order to make reunification acceptable,\" says former Mitterand advisor Hubert Védrine. Bernd Pfaffenbach, then a high-ranking Chancellery official under Kohl, adds, \"The German position had previously been that European political union must precede monetary union. But the German government sacrificed that position in the course of the negotiations.\"\n\nIn the end it was a concession that primarily benefited the two leaders. By permitting Germany to expand eastwards, Mitterand helped Kohl become the \"Chancellor of Unity,\" as he would later be dubbed. This in turn put Kohl in a position to relieve Germany of its dearly held currency, one of the greatest triumphs of the Mitterand presidency.\n\n'There's Nothing to Support This Theory'\n\nAlthough there is much evidence to back this theory up, the members of the German government at the time still insist this was not the case.\n\nTheodor Waigel walks through the wood-paneled foyer of the International Club in Berlin. In his hand he carries a black briefcase. Waigel was Germany's finance minister when the wall came down and when the euro was conceived. Both were big decisions, and he is convinced that they were the correct ones.\n\nWaigel is about to give a speech to a group of Berlin businessmen. He doesn't have much time. And yet he can't resist the temptation to comment on what he sees as the muddled theory that Germany relinquished the mark in exchange for being permitted to reunify. He says former German President Richard von Weizsäcker asked him about it when the two men met on a TV talk show a few years earlier. Waigel had therefore explained what had really happened.\n\n\"There's nothing to support this theory,\" Waigel says. \"The euro was introduced exactly according to the timetable envisaged.\" But hadn't reunification considerably contributed to the launch of the euro? Alluding to concerns by Britain, France, the United States and Russia that the Germany they had defeated in World War II could one day be a threat again, Waigel says, \"Perhaps monetary union helped allay some of the Allies' fears.\""
