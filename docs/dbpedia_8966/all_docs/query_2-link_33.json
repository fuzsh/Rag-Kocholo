        "text": "Hi,\n\nAs mentioned in my post, File Extensions is set to the \"On\" position in my dropbox.com settings. I believe I've tried all sorts of different scenarios with no resolution. Looks like Dropbox is not going to work for me. I could use Selective Sync, but that's not really what I'm looking to achieve. Thank you for your reply.\n\nHey @skverskk, welcome to our Community!\n\nOne more thing that you might want to check is this post from our Community manager.\n\nIf this doesn't help the situation at all, let me know and we'll have a closer look into this.\n\nThanks!\n\nMegan\n\nCommunity Moderator @ Dropbox\n\ndropbox.com/support\n\nDid this post help you?

In fact, that was one of the first things I tried. I'm pretty sure I've read multiple posts and suggestions throughout the Community Forum. I'm at the end of my line. Google Drive, presently, works for me. I initially un-installed it, thinking it might be clashing with Dropbox, but made no difference. So, I gave Dropbox it my best shot and it just doesn't seem to want to work in my environment. Thanks again for your response.\n\n-Ken\n\nHey @skverskk, would you mind sending me a couple of screenshots of your Dropbox folder, and specifically what you see when right clicking on a file/folder there?\n\nMegan\n\nCommunity Moderator @ Dropbox\n\ndropbox.com/support\n\nDid this post help you?

We're working on a solution now. Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nOk. Well that sounds promising. So, I assume there's going to be a quick solution, or more of a longer term solution? Well, in any event, thanks for jumping in. Hope yo hear more from you, soon. -Ken"
