        "text": "The former East German Mark, aka Ostmark, was the currency of the GDR/DDR/East Germany when Germany still was a divided country. It was officially valued by the East German government at parity with the West German Deutsche Mark, but, due to inflation, it was practically worthless outside East Germany. In 1964, the East German government instituted a Zwangsumtausch (forced exchange, or Mindestumtausch - minimum exchange), whereby most visitors from non-socialist countries were required to exchange a set amount of West Deutsche Mark (or other hard currencies, like Dollars) for East German Marks at a ratio of 1:1. Starting in 1980, Western visitors were required to exchange at least 25 DM for East German Marks per day. On the black market, the actual exchange rate was more like 5-10 East Mark for 1 West Mark. After Reunification in 1990, East Germany went to West German currency, then to the Euro."
