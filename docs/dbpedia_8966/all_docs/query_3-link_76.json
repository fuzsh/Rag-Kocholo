Alliance for Germany, which supports Germany being reunified within the scope of the Basic Law, wins the most votes (48 percent). The alliance was a coalition of opposition parties: the CDU (a former bloc party whose leading candidate was Lothar de Maizière), the German Social Union and the Democratic Awakening. The newly founded Social Democratic Party in the GDR (SDP, though it has changed its abbreviation to SPD by the time of the election) wins 21.9 percent of the vote. Lothar de Maizière becomes prime minister of the GDR.\n\nPolitics, East\n\n00:44\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nFebruary 1990\n\nEvictions trigger riots\n\nOn 13 February 1990 a group of squatters occupy a former department store to save it from being demolished. The building stands on Oranienburger Strasse and dates back to the early 20th century. The new residents rename it Kunsthaus Tacheles and turn it into an art centre that becomes a popular tourist attraction. Members of the alternative scene occupy other buildings throughout the city. A lot of squatters from Kreuzberg move East after reunification. When police clear a number of squats in Mainzer Strasse, riots break out and last for days. The clearance is one of the largest police operations in Berlin’s post-war history.\n\nPolitics, Culture, East\n\n01:42\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nJanuary 15, 1990\n\nDissolving the Stasi\n\nThe GDR’s secret service (Stasi) is being dissolved. Protestors storm its headquarters in East Berlin. For decades the Stasi spied on its own citizens and hounded political opponents. Its staff included numerous full-time spies as well as so-called “unofficial collaborators”. After the Wall fell, the GDR government initially had no plans to dissolve the Stasi. It is largely thanks to the Central Round Table and the citizens’ committees that the Stasi (which by then had been renamed the Office for National Security) was eventually abolished. Carlo Jordan represented the Greens at the Round Table.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, Opposition, East\n\n01:44\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\n1990\n\nChipping away at the Wall\n\nThe Eastern Block is gradually disintegrating. One of the most obvious signs of the change is the roaring trade going on at the Wall. People are chipping away at the concrete and selling the chunks, often with a certificate of authenticity. The Berlin Wall has become one big souvenir. Alwin Nachtweh was one of the entrepreneurs keeping souvenir hunters supplied with pieces of the Wall. He talks about how illegal traders avoided the authorities, and how East Berliners would try to sell him their old uniforms. Some of them, he says, had their whole lives in a plastic bag.\n\nEveryday Life, West, East\n\n01:52\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nDecember 31, 1989\n\nNew Year at the Brandenburg Gate\n\nBy the time 1989 draws to a close, Berlin has changed beyond all recognition. The Wall is no longer the fearful thing it once was. The Brandenburg Gate, once a symbol of the divided city, opens up to pedestrians. After 28 years of separation, Berliners from both sides of the city see in the New Year together at the Brandenburg Gate.\n\nEveryday Life, West, East\n\n00:26\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nNovember 10, 1989\n\nWilly Brandt at Schöneberg town hall\n\nOn 10 November 1989, the day after the border opens, Willy Brandt is in West Berlin. The former chancellor served as Mayor of Berlin between 1957 and 1966, which means he was in power during the early years of the Wall. Brandt joins Chancellor Kohl in speaking at a rally outside Schöneberg town hall, where a crowd of Berliners have gathered. In his speech, he says: “From the war, and from the discord between the allied powers, grew the line that eventually divided Europe and Germany. Berlin reproduced this line in numerous ways. But now here we are, and I thank God that it has happened in my lifetime, watching as the two halves of Europe begin finding their way back to each other.” His famous words, “What belongs together can now grow together”, were not actually part of this speech. Also present at Schöneberg town hall are Walter Momper (Mayor of Berlin) and Hans-Dietrich Genscher (West Germany’s foreign minister).\n\nPolitics, West, East\n\n02:14\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nVideo subtitles:\n\nVTT Subtitle\n\nEBU-TT Subtitle\n\nNovember 10, 1989\n\nHelmut Kohl at Schöneberg town hall\n\nOn 10 November 1989, the day after the border opens, Chancellor Kohl gives a speech at a rally in West Berlin in front of Schöneberg town hall. The building was the seat of the Mayor of Berlin from 1949 to 1991. Also present at Schöneberg town hall are Walter Momper (Mayor of Berlin), Hans-Dietrich Genscher (West Germany’s foreign minister) and Willy Brandt (former chancellor). Chancellor Kohl has to try and make himself heard above the noise of the crowd. In his speech, he underlines the importance of German unity, talks about a united Germany in Europe and takes time to remember all those who lost their lives at the Wall. He calls for the country to reject radical ideas and voices, and to remain calm and act wisely in the days and weeks to come.\n\nPolitics, West, East\n\n04:38\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nOctober 02, 1990\n\nAllied control ends\n\nAllied control in Berlin has been governing relations between the occupying powers and West Germany since 1949. This control, along with Berlin’s special status, comes to an end in early October 1990, when the GDR becomes part of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Two plus Four treaty is signed on 12 September 1990. It returns full sovereignty to Germany, giving the country sole control over its domestic and foreign affairs.\n\nPolitics, West\n\n00:56\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nOctober 03, 1990\n\nGermany reunited\n\nOn 3 October 1990, just 329 days after the Wall fell, the GDR officially becomes part of the Federal Republic of Germany. The country has been reunited and Berlin is once again Berlin. The GDR actually began assuming large parts of West Germany’s economic and legal systems on 1 July 1990. When the Deutsche mark became the sole currency in the GDR, East Germany was as good as part of the Federal Republic. On 23 August, a special meeting of the People’s Chamber (the GDR’s parliament) agreed to the GDR joining West Germany under Article 23 of the Basic Law.\n\nPolitics, West, East\n\n01:02\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nJune 26, 1963\n\nKennedy and Khrushchev in Berlin\n\nThe Cold War is raging. US President John F. Kennedy arrives in West Berlin in the morning of 26 June 1963. As he drives through the walled-in city, excited Berliners line the streets and give him a rapturous welcome. Children are given the day off school and businesses are closed. A reported 1.5 million people have come out to get a glimpse of Kennedy. His visit culminates with a speech in front of Schöneberg Town Hall, at that time the official seat of Berlin's mayor Willy Brandt and his successors. It is here that the young president and bearer of hope for West Berliners utters the legendary words \"ich bin ein Berliner\" to huge applause and cheers from the crowd. Just two days after Kennedy, the GDR authorities retaliate by inviting Kremlin leader Nikita Khrushchev on a state visit to East Berlin. But the East Berliners' enthusiasm for Khrushchev is muted in comparison...\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, West, East\n\n03:59\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nDecember 17, 1963\n\nFirst border pass agreement\n\nFor the first time since 1961, small gaps start to appear in the Wall. The border pass agreement is signed on 17 December 1963, 28 months after the Wall goes up, allowing West Berliners to visit their relatives in the other part of the city over Christmas. More than 700,000 West Berliners take advantage of this long-awaited chance to see their loved ones on the other side of the Wall. Some 1.2 million cross over to the East between 19 December and 5 January. GDR post office workers are responsible for processing the permit applications. Although they are state employees, they do not represent East German public authorities like police or customs officials. As a result, the Federal Republic views the border pass agreement as an administrative agreement which does not signify recognition of the GDR. The SED regime, on the other hand, does everything it can to give the agreement the character of an international treaty. A total of four border pass agreements are negotiated up until 1966.\n\nEscaping, Contemporary Witnesses, Politics, West, East\n\n02:43\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\n1965\n\nStudio at the Barbed Wire\n\nWest Berlin's authorities mount illuminated display boards on the GSW housing association high-rise near the Wall in an attempt to provide East Berliners with news from the West. The Studio at the Barbed Wire was launched by the Berlin Senate in 1961 in cooperation with the American sector's radio station, RIAS Berlin: their goal is to provide information and news across the Wall in response to the propaganda blaring out of the GDR's speaker vans. This sparks a conflict dubbed the \"speaker war\", which does not end until October 1965. Wolfgang Göbel was responsible for designing the display boards on the GSW housing association high-rise back then.\n\nBorder, Contemporary Witnesses, Politics, West, East\n\n01:54\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\n1966\n\nDivision of the evangelical synod\n\nThe evangelical church is fighting against moves to divide its diocese which still encompasses the whole of Berlin. In February 1966 Kurt Scharf is appointed as the new bishop. However, he cannot visit his East Berlin parishes, as he is refused access to East Berlin. Instead, he retains informal ties to Christians in the East. Meinhard Schröder, then a theology student, talks about his connections with Christians in the East.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, West, East\n\n01:35\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nNovember 04, 1989\n\nStefan Heym speaks on Alexanderplatz\n\nOn 4 November, 500,000 people gather at a rally on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin. It is the biggest non-state-organised demonstration in the history of the GDR. The crowd calls for democracy, constitutional laws, and freedom of speech and the press. A group of East Berlin stage actors were the first to have the idea of a rally, and the event sees more than 20 speakers step up to the microphone. Among them are politicians like Günter Schabowski, Stasi official Markus Wolf, theologian Friedrich Schorlemmer, lawyer Gregor Gysi, university rector Lothar Bisky, authors such as Christoph Hein, Stefan Heym and Christa Wolf, playwright Heiner Müller, and the actors Steffie Spira, Ulrich Mühe and Jan Josef Liefers. The poet Stefan Heym is also among those to speak.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, Opposition, East\n\n03:51\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nNovember 04, 1989\n\nJan Josef Liefers speaks on Alexanderplatz\n\nOn 4 November, 500,000 people gather at a rally on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin.

Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik is easing tensions. On 21 December, the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR sign the Basic Treaty. It is part of a strategy adopted by the West German government under Chancellor Willy Brandt, aiming to normalise relations with the GDR. The FRG acknowledges Germany's partition, but also includes a clause stating the objective of reunification.\n\nPolitics, West, East\n\n00:28\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nJune 01, 1968\n\nPrague Spring\n\nEast Berlin in the early summer of nineteen sixty-eight. Alexanderplatz is a huge building site: socialism is getting a makeover and the GDR capital is set to become a modern showcase of the Republic. In June 1968 18-year-old Toni Krahl, who will later front the rock band City, travels to Prague and is impressed by what he finds there: \"socialism with a human face\". However, on 21 August 1968 half a million soldiers from the Warsaw Pact countries invade the CSSR, crushing the Prague Spring. The authorities in East Berlin welcome the intervention and convict 1,200 people who take to the streets in protest, including Toni Krahl.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, Opposition, East\n\n04:00\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nNovember 04, 1989\n\nChrista Wolf speaks on Alexanderplatz\n\nOn 4 November, 500,000 people gather at a rally on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin.

Eight million people descend on the city, transforming Alexanderplatz into a huge festival arena. The GDR, with its new head of state and Party leader Erich Honecker, wants to present a cosmopolitan image. Free love, long hair: a colourful chaos. Suddenly almost anything seems to go in the GDR capital, turned upside down for nine days. West Berlin sports teacher Gunnar Rohn talks about his experiences at the festival. A different kind of provocation is coming from East Berlin's cinemas: the film The Legend of Paul and Paula escapes a ban by the skin of its teeth. It is to become one of the most successful DEFA films of all time.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Culture, East\n\n03:24\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nNovember 04, 1989\n\nRally at Alexanderplatz\n\nOn 4 November, 500,000 people gather for a rally on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin.

When Erich Honecker enters office, he not only promises flats, stable prices and a better supply of goods. He also \"treats\" GDR citizens to 150,000 pairs of blue jeans, a product imported from the West. This much-coveted item of clothing is only available at the Centrum Warenhaus on Alexanderplatz.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Everyday Life, East\n\n01:19\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD"
