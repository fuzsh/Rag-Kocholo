        "text": "One of the earliest animation techniques, cut-out animation is a form of stop-motion in which the characters or props are cut out from materials such as paper, cardboard, photographs or fabric. The shapes are placed flat on a background and moved manually, with each movement captured by a camera which, when edited together, gives the impression of movement.\n\nA brilliant pioneer of cut-out was the German director Lotte Reiniger, who created the first feature-length - and oldest surviving - animation, The Adventures Prince of Achmed in the 1926, which was made using her distinct style of cut-out called 'silhouette animation'. Named due to the black on white material she used, it created a charming, otherworldly shadow effect that was very experimental for the time.\n\nSince then, many filmmakers have been inspired by Reiniger's unique approach, and in fact, cut-out remains a great method for budding animators to start with today, due to its simple but effective process. Although it can now be replicated using computer systems, there are various examples of the traditional cut-out method that can be found in modern animation. Here is a list of notable uses of the style from Lotte Reiniger to Monty Python and modern-day short animations."
