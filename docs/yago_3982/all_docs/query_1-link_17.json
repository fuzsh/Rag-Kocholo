        "text": "Often hailed as the first full-length animation film in the history of cinema, this is also pioneering animator Lotte Reiniger’s most extraordinary work. Reiniger developed a highly sophisticated silhouette animation technique inspired by Chinese shadow theatre. Intricate hand-cut silhouettes were combined with shimmering backgrounds created with wax and sand set on back lit glass. Colour-tinting further enhanced the luminous effect. Amongst her collaborators were her husband Carl Koch, who acted as her production manager and photographer, and the filmmakers Walter Ruttman (Berlin, Symphony of a City) and Berthold Bartosch (L’idee) who created backgrounds and special effects. The story from the Arabian Nights allows full rein for Reiniger’s elaborate and ingenious work - magical-flying horse, wicked sorcerer, djinns, ogres, monsters and wondrous kingdoms abound. This version has been restored with a new recording of the original orchestral score. Intertitles with English subtitles.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s.
