        "text": "Join MAD for a screening of The Adventures of Prince Achmed. Widely considered to be the earliest surviving, and possibly first, feature-length animated film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed is the work of film director and pioneer of animation, Lotte Reiniger. Adapted from One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales, the film follows the story of a young prince whisked away to a magical island on a flying horse. There he fights monstrous creatures, falls in love with a goddess, meets a boy named Aladdin, and fights sorcerers across lands.\n\nThe screening will begin with an introduction from New York City-based illustrator and art director Abby Walsh.\n\nAbout the artist\n\nAbby Walsh is a New York-based teaching artist and maker.
