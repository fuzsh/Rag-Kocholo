        "text": "Lotte Reiniger s enchanting 1926 animated masterpiece The Adventures of Prince Achmed is all about magic from the flying horse our hero rides into a series of wondrous adventures to the glorious phoenix who removes her plumage to reveal that she is the Princess Peri Banu of Wak Wak in disguise.\n\nThrow in Aladdin and his magic lamp, an evil sorcerer, a caliph, an emperor, demons, and a powerful witch of the fiery mountains and you have a timeless story of love, jealousy, revenge, and transformation.\n\nBut the film s real magic comes from the meticulous and wildly imaginative hand-made animation with which Reiniger created this first-ever animated feature film! Combining silhouette puppets, stop-motion animation, and a host of other innovative techniques assisted by the great animators Walther Ruttmann, Gerthold Bartosch and Alexander Kardan, Reiniger spun a fairy tale from One Thousand and One Nights into a dazzlingly beautiful and lyrical film. Seen in this high-definition restoration featuring the original briliant color tinting and toning and Wolfgang Zeller s magnificent orchestral score, The Adventures of Prince Achmed is mesmerizing and utterly seductive.\n\nTWO DISC SET WITH BONUS FEATURES\n\nThe Secret of the Marquise, 1921 The Flying Coffer, 1921 Dr. Dolittle: Lion s Den, 1923 (German and English versions) Dr. Dolittle: A Trip to Africa, 1923. Dr. Dolittle: Cannibal Land, 1923 The Death-Feigning Chinaman, 1928 The Caliph Stork, 1935 The Magic Horse, 1953 Aladdin and His Magic Lamp, 1954 The Star of Bethlehem, 1956 The Lost Son, 1974"
