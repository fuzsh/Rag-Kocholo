Embodying the role of Scheherazade, the female storyteller of the Arabian Nights tales, Reiniger employs her scissors to snip and stitch together her own version of the source material, featuring a cast of mythical and familiar characters, including an evil sorcerer, Aladdin, the fairy princess Pari Banu and the benevolent Witch of the Flaming Mountain.\n\nWorking between 1923-1926 in a tiny shed in Potsdam, Reiniger’s small team included her husband Carl Koch and the pioneering filmmakers Berthold Bartosch and Walter Ruttmann, celebrated director of Berlin: A City Symphony (1927), who provided innovative special effects and backdrops. An ambitious project, the final version of Prince Achmed was the culmination of 250,000 frames.\n\nAlmost a century old, as well as a pioneering example of the silhouette animation technique, the animation draws on some distinctly modern themes and ideas, such as the male gaze and voyeurism, and queer representation on screen.\n\nThe post-film discussion will be led by Deptford Cinema volunteer Tashi Petter, who is also a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, working on a doctoral thesis on Lotte Reiniger.\n\nTea, cake and other refreshments will be available."
