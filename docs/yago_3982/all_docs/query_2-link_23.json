        "text": "Long before Walt Disney, there was Lotte Reiniger, pioneer of silhouette animation, her beautiful works of art astonishing the world. Her picture, ‘The Adventures of Prince Achmed’, from 1926, is the first feature-length animated film, some 10 years before Disney’s ‘Snow White’. Her inventive skills and eye for detail even to this day continue to amaze, a true trailblazer of the film industry, making more than 60 films in her career. Lotte redefined cinema and forever changed the way movies were made. This is the story of how the first feature-length animated film came to be and how it changed the world…\n\nThe Puppet Theatre\n\nBerlin. June 2nd, 1899. Lotte Reiniger was born to Carl Reiniger and Eleonore Lina Wilhelmine Rakette. As a child, Lotte was fascinated with the ancient Chinese arts of paper cutting of silhouette puppetry, even making her own puppet theatre so she could put on her own shows for her family. At just six, she started making her own cut-outs and it brought no end of joy to those who watched little Lotte dazzle with her boundless imagination and enthusiasm for the craft. She would spend hours making paper characters, using them to stage dramatic retellings of fairytales, including Snow White.\n\nLotte’s generation was the first to grow up with cinema. Only a few years before she was born, cinema was invented and growing up in a place such as Berlin ensured that Lotte had access to the world’s very first short films. It influenced her greatly and she decided, as a child, to make a career from her silhouette world, wanting to bring it to the big screen through the use of stop-motion animation.\n\nAs a child, Lotte embarked on the painstaking process of photographing each of her famous paper puppets frame by frame, performing tiny movements at every step of the way. It created the illusion of movement, decades before the likes of Aardman Animations would make their name in stop-motion features such as Wallace and Gromit. It was the same principle, but instead of clay, Lotte brought her creations to life through silhouette.\n\nI could cut out silhouettes almost as soon as I could manage to hold a pair of scissors. I could paint, too, and read and recite; but these things did not surprise anyone very much. But everybody was astonished about the scissors cuts, which seems a more unusual accomplishment. The silhouettes were very much praised, and I cut-out silhouettes for all the birthdays in the family. Did anyone warn me as to where this path would lead? Not in the least; I was encouraged to continue.\n\n– Lotte.\n\nThe Exceptional Talent\n\nLotte’s parents were cultured people and they did indeed encourage her exceptional talent. She was entirely self-taught in her craft. In 1915, Lotte attended a lecture by film director Paul Wegener. She was astonished by the fantastical possibilities of animation. Lotte, by then, harboured ambitions to become an actor, convincing her parents to allow her to enrol in the acting group to which Paul belonged, known as the ‘Theatre of Max Reinhardt’.\n\nShe began her career with the group making costumes and props, working backstage primarily. In her spare time, she doodled away with her silhouettes, making cut-outs of the actors around her. Paul was enchanted by her wonderful creations. He knew she had talent and, in 1918, he promoted her to animating wooden rats and the animated intertitles for his movie, ‘The Pied Piper of Hamelin’, which featured many of Lotte’s silhouettes.\n\nThey say do what you love and that was what brought Lotte great acclaim. It led to her admission in the Institute for Cultural Research, a highly experimental animation and short film studio. It was here she met Carl Koch, her future creative partner… and husband. This was a land of the avant-garde artist, Lotte surrounded by many at the vanguard of animation. It was her personal nirvana.\n\nWegener saw me cutting silhouettes behind the stage… and he became interested. He liked my silhouettes; he thought they showed a rare sense of movement. He therefore introduced me to a group of young artists who had started a new trick film studio. Here I first began to photograph my silhouette figures, just as drawings are photographed for the cartoon film, and I was successful in making a film with my shadow figures.\n\n– Lotte.\n\nIn 1919, Lotte directed her first movie, ‘The Ornament of the Enamoured Heart’, just five minutes long, a story of two lovers and an ornament that reflects their moods. The movie was critically acclaimed and it would open up many, many doors for Lotte, who was just 20 years of age…\n\nThe Rise\n\nLotte’s distinctive style of art in her animations was radically different to many other artists of the 1920s and the 1930s, in particular in relation to her characters. In the 1920s, characters often relied on facial expressions to express emotion or action, but Lotte’s characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions. She often utilised the technique of metamorphosis in her animations, helping her to tell the often fantastical tales of her fairytale stories. She knew animation could be used to show things that could not be replicated in reality, considering animation’s separation form the laws of the ‘material plane’ to be one of the medium’s greatest strengths.\n\nFor this, her characters were rarely biologically correct, but expressed a fluidity unseen in cinema at that point. It was central to her ideal of expressionism. Her animation stood out, however, because she was doing it with cut-outs in silhouette. It was, in essence, early stop-motion animation. Her short silhouette animated films were always met with critical acclaim and lauded as art. Whilst not many of them survive today, there was no doubt that Lotte was something extraordinary.\n\nHer breadth as a multi-talented artist and filmmaker was apparent for all to see. By the mid-1920s, she had produced six short films, all produced and photographed by Carl, now her husband. They often featured incredible scenes, such as a silhouette falcon in a dream sequence in one short. Among her earliest movies were ‘Cinderella’ and ‘The Sleeping Beauty’, both in 1922. She loved a fairytale or two.\n\nHer courage and the spirit of her hard work cemented her inclusion in the avant-garde animation community of culture rich Berlin. Her work harked back to a more innocent age. Jean Renoir, a close friend and passionate admirer of Lotte’s work, described her films as a ‘visual expression of Mozart’s music’. She was. And she was a pioneer, too.\n\nWhen the story is ready, the music is chosen, and the soundtrack recorded, then the work for the picture itself begins. Figures and backgrounds are laid out on a glass table. A strong light from underneath makes the wire hinges… disappear and throws up the black figures in relief, while the background appears as a more or less fantastic landscape in keeping with the story.\n\n– Lotte.\n\nIt was in 1923, however, when the world would be brought to the attention of Lotte’s unquestionable genius. It was then she would make the very first feature-length animated movie…\n\nThe Adventures\n\nLouis Hagen approached Lotte in 1923. He had bought a large quantity of raw film stock as an investment to fight the spiralling inflation costs of the 1920s. He wanted Lotte to produce a feature-length animated film. This had never been done before. The difficulties that came with it were apparent for all to see. Lotte said later on:\n\nWe had to think twice. This was a never heard of thing. Animated films were supposed to make people roar with laughter and nobody had dared to entertain an audience with them for than 10 minutes. Everybody to whom we talked in the industry about the proposition was horrified.\n\nRegardless, Lotte was up for the challenge. The movie was to be, ‘The Adventures of Prince Achmed’. And Lotte would make the movie with just five people. A crew of five. She designed and animated all the silhouettes herself, all by hand, photographing the animation frame-by-frame in a friend’s garage. It took five years to complete. But at least it gave her plenty of time to experiment with a number of technical and artistic innovations.\n\nShe colour tinted her film stock to create multi-coloured backgrounds and incorporated background designs from avant-garde filmmaker Walter Ruttmann. Most significantly of all, she developed a technique designed to give the illusion of depth, to make the animation appear… well, three-dimensional. She placed her silhouettes on different horizontal planes stacked at alternating levels before photographing them from above. This was the direct influence of Disney’s multiplane camera, without which Disney may not have succeeded as it was the multiplane camera techniques that critics praised most of all in his movies. After five years of hard work, ‘Prince Achmed’ was ready to be distributed, but for one year, Lotte could not find a distributor. But when she did, my God, the critics loved it…\n\n‘Prince Achmed’ premiered in Paris, no less, and it became an overnight sensation. It was met with critical and popular success. One critic described the film as, “Visual poetry, a miracle to be experienced.” It is now considered one of the most important movies ever made. Lotte animated her features with expert care and attention to detail, her exceptional skill and precision winning her praise. It was to be Lotte’s only feature-length movie and considering it took her five years, I don’t think you can blame her.\n\nBut make no bones about it, Lotte had forever changed the landscape of cinema and pushed the boundaries of animation to brave new heights, with many of her techniques and styles adopted by Disney. She may not be a household name today, but in her time, few were greater.\n\nAfter the Prince\n\nLotte would now concentrate on short films. And on sequences to be inserted into other people’s short films. When funding was a problem, which it often was in those days, Lotte would illustrate books and commercials, including animating a Nivea skincare advertisement in 1922. But she never abandoned what made her name.\n\nIn 1926, she travelled to Egypt and then to Greece in 1936. On her travels, she studied ‘shadow play’ as well as the traditions of silhouette representation of the human figure. Much of what she learnt on her travels and explored influenced her greatly. In 1928, she animated another film, ‘Doctor Dolittle and his Animals’. I know, the amount of the well-known titles she directed is incredible…\n\nIt was one year later when she co-directed her first live-action film, ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’, the story of a shadow-puppet troupe and featured a 20 minute silhouette performance. Altogether, Lotte made mor than 60 films in her career, of which 40 survive. Her intricate, imaginative techniques won her many plaudits, but she was also engaged by live shadow puppetry, sometimes recorded in film and used in live-action films. In 1933, for example, she made a shadow play sequence for the movie ‘Don Quixote’. She made another sequence for the 1937 movie, ‘The Broken Bridge’, and another for, ‘La Marseillaise’ in 1938.\n\nLotte’s productions are exciting and strange, from fairytales to parodies of opera and even those advertisements. They are filled with contradictions, satirical commentary and, often, strong erotic undertones, as seen in, ‘The Little Chimney Sweep’ in 1934. Belinda, a young, pretty protagonist, is abducted by a gangster after the two have watched a passionate erotic stage play. Lotte wrote all her own scripts.\n\nIn fact, there was little she did not do.\n\nThe War\n\nWith the rise of the Nazi party, Lotte and Carl decided to leave Germany but few other countries would grant them visas. Few other countries trusted Germans, even though Lotte and Carl were in no way affiliated with right-wing politics. They spent much of 1933 and 1934 moving from country to country, staying for as long as visas would allow.\n\nWith the advent of the talkies, Lotte and Carl began to experiment with adding music to their productions, managing to make 12 films in this period, a few based on popular operas. But then World War II hit. They stayed with Visconti in Rome. Lotte turned her back on her homeland, Germany, saying, “I didn’t like this whole Hitler thing and because I had many Jewish friends whom I was no longer allowed to call friends.” The situation was worsening rapidly. Italy declared war on Germany in 1943 and with it, the embassy of Rome ordered Lotte and Carl to flee. And so they did, heading off in a rush to Venice.\n\nOn Christmas Day, 1943, Lotte and Carl travelled back to Berlin. They were now trapped. There would be no escape from Germany now. Why? Lotte’s mother was incredibly sick. Despite the fact Lotte knew she was now under the command of the Nazis, who forced her against her will to make propaganda films for them, she risked it all to be with her mother. Her mother was all alone. I think it was a tremendously courageous decision.\n\nUnder the rule of Hitler, Lotte was forced to make propaganda films, working under stringent and limiting conditions to please the German state. Worse still, many of the negatives of her movies were stored in her studio in Potsdam and most were destroyed in the war, Potsdam almost obliterated. Among them, Prince Achmed. Luckily, prints existed elsewhere. But by war’s end, Lotte was tired. She was filled with stress and anxiety. Germany did not feel like home anymore. She didn’t want to be there. And so, in 1948, she left Germany. For good.\n\nLotte and Carl settled in London where Lotte did her best to get back to doing what she did best. She made a few short advertising films and in 1950, she designed a logo for ‘TALK’, the quarterly magazine for the National Deaf Children’s Society. The chair, Freddy Bloom, was astonished by Lotte’s talents. The logo, albeit modernised, is still used to this day. Not long after, with Louis Hagen Junior, who funded ‘Prince Achmed’, Lotte founded Primrose Productions and, over the next two years, produced more than a dozen short silhouette films based on the Brothers Grimm fairytale, and others, for the BBC. Lotte and Carl settled in the Abbey Arts Centre, an artists’ estate in north London.\n\nThe couple became British citizens in 1961.\n\nNever Alone\n\nTragically, Carl passed away in 1963. He and Lotte had enjoyed 42 years of marriage. Lotte entered a period of seclusion, after which she returned to Berlin. In the mid-60s, she started making movies again. In those 10 years alone, she became a near-recluse, but by the late 1960s, her early work experienced something of a revival, prompting Lotte to return to moviemaking. Many in Germany were keen to mend the bridges broken with war and it led to the rediscovery of her work in West Germany and recognition, too. In 1972, she was awarded the Filmband in Gold of the Deutscher Filmpreis. Not long after, in 1979, she received the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. When she died, she did not die alone and in obscurity, but celebrated and appreciated for the phenomenal artist and pioneer of film that she was.\n\nLotte died in Dettenhausen, Germany, on June 19th, 1981, not long after her 82nd birthday. What she left behind was a legacy of work that continues to influence filmmakers to this day. Many makers of animated movies since Lotte’s death cite her among their influences, with the makers of Fantasia using Lotte’s techniques and style, as did the makers of The Princess of the Frog. Disney made their name using Lotte’s multiplane technique, whilst the makers of ‘Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events’ (2004) were inspired by Lotte’s work for their credits. The sheer number of creatives who have been inspired by Lotte and her pioneering techniques is endless. Her influence is still felt to this day.\n\nShe made over 60 films, many of which are lost, but her involvement in many movies of the silent era and the talkies is extensive. Few others have taken a specific animation technique and made it her own. Nobody has rivalled her since she died, the history of silhouette animation beginning and ending with Lotte. She took the art of shadow plays from ancient China and adapted it with exquisite perfection for cinema. The fantasy narrative she brought to screen expertly captured the imaginations of children everywhere, but today, Lotte’s name has largely disappeared from sight.\n\nThat said, she is making a comeback. Social media stars today are posting clips of Lotte’s phenomenal work and once more, excitement is building around Lotte’s imaginative storytelling. She is starting to gain more and more recognition as one of the most crucial pieces in the puzzle of film and animation history. New audiences are discovering her work and are falling in love with her innovative animation style. Nearly a century after her heyday, the name ‘Lotte Reiniger’ is getting the recognition she surely deserves.\n\nHer work is undoubtedly brilliant but one must never forget that she was one of the great innovators in movie history, who proves the notion that early cinema was a man’s world was clearly not true. Without her, where would cinema be? Where would animation be? Lotte is a legend of the screen.\n\nHer work is surely invaluable.\n\nThere remains a good deal to say about the artistic problems of this type of film, about its future and about its value. But I am content to leave these matters to those people whose profession it is to bother about such problems. I feel that I do better to concentrate on the films – and on making as many as my good luck allows. Each new film raises new problems and questions, and I can only hope to live long enough to do justice to them all.\n\n– Lotte.\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost KT: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nImages (click on them to enlarge): 1) Lotte Reiniger, 2) Lotte making one of her movies, 3-4) Two stills from 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed'.
