Anderson\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed deserves to be a landmark. And it would be if it were better known.\n\nTV GuideTV Guide Staff\n\nGerman filmmaker Lotte Reiniger's ground-breaking, silent, animated fantasy feature used cut-out paper silhouettes to tell a tale that combines pieces of several stories from The Arabian Nights: Tales from a Thousand and One Nights.\n\nBoston GlobeGlobe Staff\n\nThe picture Is fully as fantastic and as entrancing as the characters about whom the story revolves.\n\nNew York TimesMordaunt Hall\n\nIt may not be exactly new to perceive silhouette figures on the screen, but it is quite another matter as they are offered here.\n\nSan Francisco ExaminerWesley Morris\n\nA rapturous animated kaleidoscope with a more abstracted visage of the 1001 Arabians Nights tale than you could dream.\n\nHartford CourantWalter Brown\n\nCertainly there is more to appeal to an active young imagination, (even like my own) in the \"acting\" of a convincing silhouette hero in a fairy-story than there is in the undeniably flesh-and-blood attributes of impersonation of a player."
