        "text": "Time\n\n7:00 pm\n\nThe Nevada City Film Festival presents The Adventures of Prince Achmed with an Original Score Performed by Gyan Riley\n\nFriday, October 6, Doors 6 pm, Show 7 pm\n\nTICKETS: $35/GA, $15/Ages 18 and Under\n\nThe Nevada City Film Festival presents the world premiere of composer and multi-instrumentalist\n\nGyan Riley’s original live score to one of the most iconic and visually enchanting films of all time –\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed – Friday, October 6, at the historic Nevada Theatre.\n\nWhen The Adventures of Prince Achmed premiered to German audiences in 1926, it was hailed\n\nas the first full-length animated film. Taken from the tales known as the Arabian Nights, the film\n\ntells the story of a young prince tricked by a wicked sorcerer into mounting a magical, flying\n\nhorse for a direct course to his own demise. Soaring headlong into a series of wondrous\n\nadventures, and joining forces with the likes of Aladdin and a fabled witch, the prince evades\n\nhis fate by saving a beautiful princess and battling with the sorcerer’s army of monsters.\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed was created by German filmmaker Lotte Reiniger, who\n\npioneered the technique of silhouette animation – using intricate cut-out shadow puppets shot\n\nframe-by-frame against thin sheets of lead – a method she used to create over 40 fairy-tale\n\nfilms. This cinematic treasure has been beautifully restored with color tinting.\n\nRiley, who grew up in Nevada County, has been called by the New York Times, “a one-man\n\nAmerican music machine, amicably ranging across the fields of jazz, world music, and post-\n\nminimalism.” He is currently engaged as the 2023 composer in residence at the Lou\n\nHarrison House in Joshua Tree.\n\nThe uniqueness of the oldest animated film, directed by a woman at the onset of cinema’s\n\ngolden age, and screened at the oldest, continuously operated theater on the West Coast of the\n\nThe US is not lost on Riley, who says these are why he accepted the invite.\n\n“I am excited about this event, especially at the historic Nevada Theater. And I’m not\n\nsure I’ve ever played there…what an honor!”\n\nThrilling, sensuous, and dazzling, Prince Achmed will amaze and enthrall audiences of all ages.\n\nLabels\n\nLive\n\nOrganizer\n\nNCFF\n\nPhone\n\n(530) 362-8601\n\nEmail\n\ninfo@nevadacityfilmfestival.com\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://nevadacityfilmfestival.com/\n\nSince 2001, the Nevada City Film Festival (NCFF) has brought top independent film, music, and comedy, along with attracting thousands of attendees, international filmmakers, and industry guests, to the historic town of Nevada City, California. Nevada City is known for its sophisticated and supportive arts and cultural scene and makes screening a film here a positive, encouraging, and exciting experience. NCFF is often referred to as the “Sundance of the Sierra” for its emphasis on fiercely independent cinema that showcases innovative, progressive, and exciting new voices in film. In 2019, NCFF was named for the second time by Moviemaker Magazine as one of the top 50 film festivals in the world worth the submission fee for filmmakers. In 2020, NCFF was named by USA Today as the #3 Best Festival in the US.\n\nRelated Events"
