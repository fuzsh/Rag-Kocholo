        "text": "Cut!: How Lotte Reiniger and a Pair of Scissors Revolutionized Animation\n\nby C. E. Winters; illus. by Matt Schu\n\nPrimary, Intermediate Greenwillow 40 pp.\n\n1/23 9780063067394 $18.99\n\nWith a refrain of “snip, snip, snip!” the story introduces readers to German film pioneer Lotte Reiniger (1899–1981). Lotte’s adolescence coincided with the dawn of cinema, a time when movies “were silent but filled with magical sights.” She utilized her Scherenschnitte (“scissor cuts”) skills to create her own paper-cut puppet shows, eventually seeking the ­guidance and partnership of cinema professionals. Success with early stop-motion experimentation, along with acclaim for a groundbreaking four-minute animated film, led to a wealthy patron. Reiniger, assisted by her husband and a small crew, worked for nearly three years to complete a sixty-five-minute animated movie titled The Adventures of Prince Achmed, which mesmerized audiences. Schu’s exquisite digital illustrations possess a strong sense of illumination and depth, often suggesting a tactile quality, as if constructed from paper. Visually, much of the book is shadowy and dark, particularly around the perimeter of pages, simulating the experience of watching a shadow puppet play; however, bursts of radiant color spotlight (literally and figuratively) key areas of interest. A helpful author’s note identifies the Chinese origins of paper cutting and Reiniger’s specific contributions to filmmaking (some of which are often incorrectly accredited to Walt Disney). Additional back matter includes a timeline, a bibliography, and a glossary. See also Robinson’s Out of the Shadows: How Lotte Reiniger Made the First Animated Fairytale Movie (rev. 3/22)."
