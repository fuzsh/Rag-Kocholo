        "text": "Join us for a film screening of The Adventures of Prince Achmed by Lotte Reiniger accompanied by a live music soundtrack performed by Chris Davies.\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed – Lotte Reiniger’s 1926 silhouette animation is the oldest surviving animated film in the world. The exquisite film – made from card and entirely cut by hand – took three years to complete. Originally created as a silent film, the animation has a new soundtrack composed by musician, Chris Davies.\n\nCome along to watch this beautiful fairytale on the big screen and listen to Chris’ live music accompaniment. The film is a PG certificate and runs for approximately 60 minutes.\n\nPre-film snacks will include: vegetable samosa, vegetable pakora, pani poori and gulan jamun."
