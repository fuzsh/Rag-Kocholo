        "text": "Out of the Shadows: How Lotte Reiniger Made the First Animated Fairytale Movie\n\nFiona Robinson. Abrams, $18.99 (48p) ISBN 978-1-4197-4085-5\n\nRobinson (The Bluest of Blues) serves up a thorough, absorbing biography of Lotte Reiniger (1899–1981), an animation pioneer virtually unknown in North America, paying homage by illustrating partially with the meticulous cut-paper technique used by the animator herself. Berlin-born Reiniger is “a modern girl who loved traditional tales” as well as a specific new technology: silent film. Combining two concepts—flat, rod-style “Chinese puppets” received as a gift, and the art of Scherenschnitte—she begins creating moving figures that she stages in her own fairy tale dramas. An alliance with an actor leads to collaboration and finally to her own films—including the first feature-length, stop-motion animated movie. Robinson’s intricate illustrations use a variety of visual techniques, including cut-paper silhouettes and replicas of silent film “intertitles.” Dense text details aspects of film technology, especially the assembly that makes stop-motion possible, but elides age-appropriate explanations of what back matter contextualizes as “orientalism” in Reiniger’s work. Reiniger’s determination inspires in this visually arresting picture book, as does the reminder that animation started with very simple tools. Back matter includes an author’s note. Ages 6–9.
