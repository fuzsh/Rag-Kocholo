We pay homage to her life and work, and reflect on why she never received the recognition she deserves. We animated this film in a 2D silhouette style as a tribute to Lotte’s groundbreaking style. This film has been viewed over 7 million times around the word on various platforms as well as being screen at Annecy and Cannes Film festivals amongst others.\n\nMusic by Alex Harwood. Made for the BBC."
