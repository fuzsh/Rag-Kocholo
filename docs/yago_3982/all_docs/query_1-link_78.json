        "text": "by Allan Fish\n\n(Germany 1926 66m) DVD1/2\n\nAka. Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed\n\nSearching for Peri Banu\n\np Lotte Reiniger d/anim Lotte Reiniger collaborators Walter Ruttmann, Berthold Bartosch, Alexander Kardan, Walter Türck ph Carl Koch m Wolfgang Zeller voiceover Henrietta Garden\n\nThe history of animation has so long been dominated by the more conventional form known as cartoons, that any other style of the art has been overlooked. There have been many masters of animatronics and stop-motion animation, some of them working as animators, some as special effects co-ordinators. Names such as Ray Harryhausen, Willis O’Brien, Wladyslaw Starewicz, Nick Park and Jan Svankmajer are well known, but not so many people would have heard of Lotte Reiniger, even though hers is a name that should be on the tip of everyone’s tongue.\n\nReiniger worked as an animator from the turn of the twenties, and early in that decade, still in her mid twenties, she and Carl Koch moved to Potsdam where she began work on this film, which would turn out to be the most awe-inspiring achievement in animation to that date. Forget Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature length animated feature was this, Reiniger’s version of the Arabian Nights, a fantastic film in more ways than one. Its story is almost irrelevant, for it’s the artistry that matters here. Reiniger was a supreme silhouette artist who devised Prince Achmed as a feature length film told entirely by silhouette animation. Needless to say it was an incredibly long and laborious process, one which took her and Koch some three years before its first showing in 1926. The response was ecstatic, and she went on to make other films in the same style, though at smaller lengths, everything from Cinderella to Dr Dolittle. Yet eventually she went to England to live and drifted into obscurity, her masterpiece only surviving because a print was kept by the British Film Institute. Restored today, it’s a truly splendorous achievement. One could really imagine this accompanied by the Rimsky-Korsakov ‘Scheherezade’ suite would be something extraordinary, but it does have the advantage of retaining the original Zeller score from the twenties. It’s like an oriental shadow play caught on film, with tinting adding to the atmosphere in spades. Each of the characters is quite wonderfully characterised, and their movement within their backgrounds is quite sublime. Though he may never have seen it, this is a film one could have imagined Norman McLaren liking. One can also be sure that Walt Disney saw it. (Indeed Reiniger’s film has an animated wizard’s duel decades before that in Disney’s The Sword in the Stone.)\n\nEighty years on some people might complain of Achmed that it doesn’t move at much of a pace, and this is true in one respect. Yet Achmed is rather a film one must not bring pre-conceptions to, a film to relax into and savour every frame. It’s the sort of film that will just leave you open-mouthed in admiration of its detail, its ambition and its supreme artistry. Favourite moments abound, from the spectacular wizard’s duel to the decapitation of a many headed monster, and to the delicate moment where the prince spies Peri Banu bathing naked. The lustre of the imagery is complimented by a truly wonderful design, with intricately detailed silhouettes of palaces, forests, monsters, heroes, villains, princesses and caliphs. We can be grateful that we live in a time when such gems as this can literally come out of the ether and into public approval and long overdue rapturous acclaim. This isn’t a great film because it’s the first animated feature, it’s a great film because of its artistry, which would be undiminished regardless of its historical context. More of Reiniger’s work should be available, though much of it is lost. The effort and time she and Koch put into her baby merits our attention, the love and care lavished as obvious now as then. In her field of animation, she is the only real master; she is literally the alpha and the omega of cinematic silhouette animation. Honour the film and honour her, for it and she merit it."
