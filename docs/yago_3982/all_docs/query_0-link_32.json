        "text": "One of the screenings we watched during class was “The Adventures of Prince Achmed”, and it was made by a German artist by the name of Lotte Reiniger. This animated film was done using entirely, very detailed cutouts that she hand-made. For the special effects that were seen in the hour long film, she used the multi-plane glass, soap and background paintings. This following video demonstrates the steps Lotte Reiniger followed in order to make the great animation that Achmed was. It shows how her drawings were brought to life and every step she took in order to achieve her final piece.\n\nI really enjoyed watching this animated cutout film because it contained so many detailed scenes, as seen on minute 3:05, when Achmed walks inside the room filled with women. These detailed environments can also be observed in minute 6:30, when Achmed lands on the new world filled with flying women, where he then meets the woman he wants to marry. These scenes don’t seize to amuse me since I know they were all done by hand cutting paper and creating different planes to create depth even though its all 2D.\n\nEven though this animation was a little too slow for me, I still enjoyed observing every detail within it, but most importantly I enjoyed watching how the story progressed, and how Achmed found himself solving yet another problem he kept running into along the way. I really wish they had voice overs for this film instead of having an all text scene, where the viewers had to read in order to understand what was actually going on. This for me, took so much from the actual film because it drew me away from the environment and the actions that were happening on screen. This artists is indeed a very talented woman, capable of depicting emotion in simple yet very detailed cut-outs."
