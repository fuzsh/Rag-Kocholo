        "text": "Special $5 general admission as part of our Family Films Series!\n\nWhen THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED premiered in Germany on September 23, 1926 it was hailed as the first full-length animated film. More than seventy-five years later, this enchanting film still stands as one of the great classics of animation — beautiful, mesmerizing and utterly seductive.\n\nTaken from The Arabian Nights, the film tells the story of a wicked sorcerer who tricks Prince Achmed into mounting a magical flying horse and sends the rider off on a flight to his death. But the prince foils the magician’s plan, and soars headlong into a series of wondrous adventures — joining forces with Aladdin and the Witch of the Fiery Mountains, doing battle with the sorcerer's army of monsters and demons, and falling in love with the beautiful Princess Peri Banu.\n\nTHE ADVENTURE OF PRINCES ACHMED features a silhouette animation technique director and animator Lotte Reiniger invented which involved manipulated cutouts made from cardboard and thin sheets of lead under a camera. The technique is similar to that utilized with Wayang shadow puppets, though Reiniger's cutouts are animated frame by frame, not manipulated in live action.\n\nThis cinematic treasure has been beautifully restored with its spectacular color tinting and with a new orchestral recording of the magnificent 1926 score by Wolfgang Zeller. Thrilling, sensuous and dazzling, Prince Achmed will enthrall children and film enthusiasts of all ages.\n\nDirector Lotte Reiniger. 72 minutes. Not rated, from 1926. Silent with musical accompinament and English intertitles."
