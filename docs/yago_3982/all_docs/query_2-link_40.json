        "text": "Lotte Reiniger is perhaps most famous for creating the earliest surviving animated feature film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926). Her immediately recognisable animation style uses delicate silhouettes to conjure the storybook images of the range of fairytales and fables she adapted, which still thrills children and adults alike.\n\nTh BFI is delighted to present The Adventures of Prince Achmed in a beautiful dual format edition, as well as a comprehensive two disc package of her Fairy Tale Films."
