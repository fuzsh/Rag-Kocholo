        "text": "Tom Teasley, a world-renowned percussionist, creates an exciting soundtrack for this magical 1926 silent film. The first animated feature-length film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed, was created by German visionary Lotte Reiniger using a silhouette technique inspired by shadow puppetry. In the film, a wicked sorcerer tricks Prince Achmed into riding a magical flying horse, which he then uses to embark on many adventures. While travelling, Achmed falls in love with the beautiful Princess Peri Banu, and must defeat an army of demons to win her heart. Teasley’s innovative world music score is based upon his collaborations with musicians in the Middle East during his work as a Cultural Envoy for the U.S. State Department."
