        "text": "NEW TRAILER\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed Trailer from jack lockhart on Vimeo.\n\nChris was commissioned by the National Media Museum to compose an original new score for the groundbreaking animated film ‘The Adventures of Prince Achmed’. This new work was performed live for the opening night of the Bradford Animation Festival 2014.\n\nWatch a short edit from that night\n\nThe Film\n\nLotte Reiniger’s beautiful 1926 silhouette animation ‘The Adventures of Prince Achmed’ brings to life magical tales from the ‘Arabian Nights’. The earliest surviving animated feature film – preserved in the BFI National Archive – it has been hailed as one of the world’s most innovative and influential animations. Three years in production and made in card cut entirely by hand, Reiniger’s exquisite shadow characters move intricately through colourful worlds of demons, witches, beautiful princesses and flying castles.\n\nChris’s creative process:\n\n“After the first viewing I was completely enchanted and excited by the opportunity to work with this wonderful film; running at sixty-five minutes I knew it was a mammoth undertaking but couldn’t wait to get started. The film is silent so unrestricted by language, I watched it a few times with the original orchestration, then again, this time with the sound off and ideas started to come. First rooting it sound-wise where the story takes place, beginning in the Middle East, what sounds, instruments, rhythms take you to the Caliph’s palace? Then there’s an African sorcerer, a spirit island, a journey to China, a fire-witch in a fire-mountain…then Aladdin appears…just incredible. The more I watched, the more I became absorbed in creating the sound worlds of the journey, and falling more in love with the beauty of the animation; I was already starting to think of a life for this beyond the animation festival.”\n\nListen to a soundtrack edit\n\nInstruments used in this production:\n\nClassical guitar, oud, darbuka, gong rack, bass drum, djembe, tin whistle, bowed psaltery, xylophones, thumb piano, zither, crystal singing bowl, bamboo flute, soprano saxophone, rattles, shakers and bells, voice, sequencing and computer programming.\n\nTestimonial\n\n“Lotte Reiniger’s brilliant ‘Adventures of Prince Achmed’ is a true animation gem. Historically it is an important work in the animation canon – and within the global film community. Moreover, when coupled with musician Chris Davies’s new score, Reiniger’s work leaps anachronistically to present day and back again. It’s as if you’re watching the film as it should be viewed – in the 1920s. His accompaniment is a work of art in itself. I recommend it wholeheartedly.”\n\nMark Shapiro – Studio Laika\n\nListen to two full recorded tracks\n\n“What an evening!\n\nLike something from the Manchester International Festival!\n\nThe visuals were fantastic – the cut out and animations – and the music, just stunning – so well matched to the content of the story and characters. That was a real highlight of everything I’ve seen this year. Congratulations to the fabulous musician and to all who made it possible for us to see, I was completely mesmerised from beginning to end – in fact I didn’t want it to end!”\n\nPat – who saw the performance at The Vale, Arts and Cinema.\n\nYou can book Chris to perform this live for you, please contact him for more information.\n\nEmail ~ chris@musichris.co.uk\n\nMobile ~ 07835 368813"
