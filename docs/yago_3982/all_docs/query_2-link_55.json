        "meta_description": "Out of the Shadows    is an innovative picture book biography about an unsung hero of early animation.      Lotte Reiniger (1899–1981) was a German film director and animator best known for  The Adventures of Prince Achmed , which was released in 1926 and is the oldest surviving animated movie. (It came out a full 11 years before Disney’s  Snow White !) As a little kid, Reiniger loved reading fairy tales and fell in love with puppetry. At school, she learned about  Scherenschnitte , or papercuts, which helped her create her signature style of silhouettes. She grew up to make more than 40 films throughout her long career, most of which were fairy tales that used her stop-film animation technique of hand-cut silhouettes. Reiniger is now seen as the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation and the inventor of an early form of the multiplane camera.     With art inspired by Reiniger’s cut-paper style and a text that uses a fairy-tale motif that mimics her movies, author-illustrator Fiona Robinson’s  Out of the Shadows  is a sweeping tribute to one of most important figures of animation, whose influence still resonates today.     “Every spread offers an exceptional visual experience, regularly amplifying aspects of the narrative.”— Horn Book Magazine  (Starred Review)",
