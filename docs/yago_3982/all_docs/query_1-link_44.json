        "text": "That doesn't much bother Achmed, who is \"young, and brave, and eager for adventure.\" After discovering how to control his magic mount, he lands on a mysterious island, where he discovers true love with the exquisite Princess Peri Banu, ruler of the spirit land of the Waq Waq.\n\nBut the sorcerer ain't done yet. Transforming himself into the most evil kangaroo ever seen on film, he tricks the prince again, kidnaps Peri Banu, and sells her to the emperor of China (another symptom of the strong strain of racial-sexual anxiety that runs through the film). Then the sorcerer goes back for the prince's sister.\n\nAs the film explains, \"Great was the might of the African Sorcerer,\" so Prince Achmed continues to get his butt kicked until he wises up and enlists allies--the fearsome Fire Mountain Witch, plus Aladdin and his famous lamp. With magical help, the prince bests a staggering array of supernatural baddies, from the vengeful spirits of the Waq Waq to a hilariously carnivorous elephant with giant fangs.\n\nAnyone who imagines that shadow puppets captured frame by frame on film cannot tell a compelling story has not seen The Adventures of Prince Achmed.\n\nThese characters are often more fun to watch than those found in the most finely detailed computer animation from Pixar. Especially good is the African Sorcerer, whose insectile body goes through incredible contortions as he scuttles through the scenery or transforms into various terrifying creatures.\n\nReiniger's film also offers stunningly dramatic visuals that make very effective use of background color. In one notable scene, the prince watches Peri Banu and her maidens as they shed their magic flying cloaks to bathe in a lake. This enchanting interlude is heart-stopping in its ethereal black-on-blue beauty.\n\nThe only disquieting thing about this film (besides the racial stereotypes) is the troublesome questions it raises about 21st-century animators.\n\nSeventy-five years after the debut of The Adventures of Prince Achmed, filmmakers have amazing technical innovations at their disposal. But most of them have a lot to learn from an old-fashioned storyteller named Lotte Reiniger. 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed' screens Sept. 28-29 at 7 p.m. at the Sonoma Film Institute, Sonoma State University, 1108 Darwin Hall, 1801 E. Cotati Ave., Rohnert Park. $4.50. 707/664-2606.\n\n[ North Bay | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
