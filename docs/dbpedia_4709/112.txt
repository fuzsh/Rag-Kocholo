Here’s hoping that the flightaware staff can come up with a way to just type the 3 letter airline code and flight number to track a flight (instead of typing ‘southwest airlines 2247’ just type swa 2247). There are times when viewing an airport that a flight is shown that I am not familiar with the airline code and not all codes are easy to decipher. Thanks for a great site!!!
