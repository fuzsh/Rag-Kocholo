        "text": "I need better antenna to hear the doctor side of the conversation...But the patient report heard perfectly. Ive had a scanner for almost 300 years now. How come I've never heard about this kinda frequency before. Love finding new odd ball stuff.\n\nwould that make your scanner the oldest known scanner if its 300 years old? LOL And would that make you a vampire?\n\nIs 128.9 a local or regional or nationwide frequency?\n\nI was on Southwest flight 2305 on Wednesday night from Dallas to Las Vegas. We left at 6PM Dallas time and about 30 minutes into the flight I became so ill that I passed out, when I awoke I immediatly started vomiting, my wife is a nurse and was seated across the isle from me. She took my vitals and relayed them to the flight attendent who had a headset plugged into the overhead. A doctor recomended I lay down but the plane was completely full so they had me lay down on the floor in the front galley. The flight crew and the pilot kept checking on me, they were great. I layed on the floor until we were ready to land, then returned to my seat. When we landed in Vegas they had Paramedics ready to check me out. My vitals were normal so it was determined that I had food poisoning. There was another flight #257 that left Dallas at 5:15 PM that was headed for Phoenix, I am curious if you heard my emergency or there was another one. I tried to determine wich flight was WN1110 but could not remember tail number for my flight. Southwest treated me great, I am a frequent flyer with them. I vomited for over 3 hours but I feel fine today."
