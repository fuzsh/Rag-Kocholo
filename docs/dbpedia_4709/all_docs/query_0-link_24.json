        "text": "IATA Code: WN\n\nICAO Code: SWA\n\nInternational Call Sign: Southwest\n\nMileage Plus: Rapid Rewards\n\nHeadquarters: Dallas, Texas\n\nSet up in 1971, Southwest Airlines is usually referred to American Southwest Airlines, to avoid confusion with Japan Southwest Airlines (present Japan Transocean Air), Air China Southwest Branch and UK Air Southwest. It is the founder of low cost airlines in civil air transportation service. In United States, it has the most domestic routes and has created many records in American civil aviation such as the highest net profit rate, the highest credit grade and the lowest debt running rate. From the point of traveling volume, it is the second largest airlines in USA and the third largest airlines in the world.\n\nPolicy of Management\n\nSouthwest Airlines always provides the good service that the passengers expect. It offers low ticket, safe and frequent flights, comfortable cabins, first-class Mileage Plus, smooth check-in, friendly customer service and memorable travel experience. It only opens the domestic point-to-point flights, no long distance flights and no international flights. The low price policy makes it a real fast airbus. There is no distinction between business class and economy class and passengers do not need to take seats by number, which saves much boarding time. Besides, the time of waiting for the luggage is shorter than any of other airlines.\n\nCompany Culture\n\nSouthwest Airlines emphasizes on the value of stuff coming first. It keeps on encouraging every employee working for it. Like a big family, it is full of love, care and active atmosphere. The leaders put forward a clear aim of the company: make money, offer every employee a secure job and make more people travel by air.\n\nHubs\n\nThe top 10 airport hubs of Southwest Airlines (By 2007)\n\nAirport\n\nNumber of Planes Leaving Port Per Day\n\nNumber of Departure Gate\n\nNumber of Arrival Cities (Nonstop Flight)\n\nYear of First Flight\n\nMcCarran International Airport\n\n241\n\n21\n\n53\n\n1982\n\nChicago Midway International Airport\n\n228\n\n29\n\n47\n\n1985\n\nPhoenix International Airport\n\n200\n\n24\n\n42\n\n1982\n\nBaltimore Washington International Airport\n\n172\n\n26\n\n40\n\n1993\n\nHouston Hobby Airport\n\n146\n\n16\n\n29\n\n1971\n\nAuckland International Airport\n\n144\n\n11\n\n21\n\n1989\n\nDallas Love Field Airport\n\n137\n\n14\n\n16\n\n1971\n\nLos Angeles International Airport\n\n122\n\n11\n\n19\n\n1982\n\nOrlando International Airport\n\n116\n\n14\n\n33\n\n1996\n\nSan Diego International Airport\n\n103\n\n10\n\n16\n\n1982\n\nSouthwest Airlines uses three types of Boeing 737 aircrafts.
