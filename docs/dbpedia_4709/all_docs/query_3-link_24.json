Always been curious!\n\nThere is an ICAO and IATA for both airports and airlines.\n\nUse this as a simple guide. I am using an example flight, Salt Lake City to San Francisco on Delta.\n\nIATA Airports:\n\nSLC - LAX\n\nICAO Airports:\n\nKSLC-KLAX\n\nIATA Airlines:\n\nDL1117\n\nICAO Airlines:\n\nDAL1117\n\nIn America, it is more basic. But in Europe, it can be complex. For example, EasyJet 1310 can be said in IATA as U2 1310 (U2 for their code). As ICAO, it is EZS51UQ. Now this May seem random, but it is not.\n\nAccording to FR24, that in order to arrive at alphanumeric call signs, certain airlines append a character to the flight number. Basically, airlines can remove a number, and replace it with a corresponding letter. So (for simplicity purposes), we can say A=1 and Z=26. Using that, we can say that United flight 9426 can be written as UALJ4Z. So Aer Lingus flight 174 becomes EIN17A (or Shamrock One Seven Alfa over the radio)."
