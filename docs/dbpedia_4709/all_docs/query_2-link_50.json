Coding has gone haywire when the same number can refer to different things on different days. (Try that in a warehouse) I needed to see when flight SW 3536 was going to get into Hobby Airport, Houston. The first quesion asked was, \"From what airpoprt?\" I did not know. Does it matter? Flight SW 3536 should only come in at the same scheduled time from the same airport, or list of airports, every day, or every so often. I was told that it could come from different airports on different days. What's up? That is a bad coding structure, I assure you; difficult information; confusing; not helpful; difficult to operate.\n\nOne of the ways I find out where a flight I'm taking is coming from is to look at the gate number Its's leaving from, then check arrivals to see what flight is landing at that gate and where it came from. Now you can work backwards from that.\n\nJust a thought."
