        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nBeijing Capital Airlines is provider of scheduled passenger air travel services in the China market and in the international market to and from China. Our mission is to connect Beijing China and the world. We are committed to offering a high level of customer service and providing a dignified, positive and safe flight experience for all passengers. As carrier, we recognize the role we play in advancing accessibility, and have long tried to make air travel as accessible as we can.\n\nDuring the course of its consultation and feedback process, Beijing Capital Airlines has acknowledged that there are barriers in its services to persons with disabilities. In this Accessibility Plan, Beijing Capital Airlines summarizes the actions it will be taking to remove and prevent the barriers faced by persons with disabilities during air travel.\n\nAt the outset, Beijing Capital Airlines recognizes that its passengers with disabilities may face certain barriers within the airport terminal, which fall within the scope of the airport authorities. This Accessibility Plan has identified only those barriers to the extent that Beijing Capital Airlines is able to meaningfully address them to assist its passengers with disabilities from the point of check-in, to using the airport lounge, to navigating the airport, to boarding the aircraft and during air travel. To the extent that Beijing Capital Airlines is not able to make changes within the scope of the airport authorities, Beijing Capital Airlines does not address these barriers in this Accessibility Plan.\n\n2. Key Terms\n\nTwo important terms are used throughout the Accessibility Plan which are defined in the Accessible Canada Act (ACA).\n\nA barrier is “anything – including anything physical, architectural, technological or attitudinal, anything that is based on information or communications or anything that is the result of a policy or a practice – that hinders the full and equal participation in society of persons with an impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment or a functional limitation.”\n\nA disability is “any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment – or a functional limitation – whether permanent, temporary or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society.”\n\n3. Commitment\n\nBeijing Capital Airlines is committed to ensuring equal access and participation for all people. We are committed to the principle of inclusion, to meet the needs of people who would be facing barriers and will do this by identifying, removing and preventing barriers. Beijing Capital Airlines will treat persons with disabilities with dignity and provide equal opportunities as well as barrier-free access.\n\n4. Feedback Process and Contact Information\n\nThis Accessibility Plan was developed with the feedback from customers, employees and other stakeholders as part of its consultation process. Beijing Capital Airlines is committed to receiving continued feedback as to the barriers experienced by persons using its services.\n\nFor the purposes of providing Beijing Capital Airlines with feedback on this Accessibility Plan or any other feedback concerning accessibility, you may be contact us, anonymously or by including your name and contact information, through following means:\n\nEmail us at lzh-han@jdair.net or Call +86 898-95375.\n\n5.

Design and delivery of programs and services\n\nOur customers’ journeys involve many phases, such as booking a reservation, getting from the check-in counter through the airport to the gate, getting on and off the aircraft, and traveling on the aircraft.
